- The ancient “your-mother” joke: http://www.antiquitatem.com/en/a-joke-2000-years-old-augustus/
Folding his arms around his knees, Castiel tilts his head back against the wall, and closes his eyes.
Beside him, Dean takes an unsteady breath, and Castiel goes on, rescuing him from having to form a reply.
Dean’s overconfidence might be tiresome when he jokingly applies it to his own more obnoxious qualities, but Castiel can’t deny that it makes him feel incredibly good when Dean directs it toward him. Sometimes, he thinks about the fact that Dean always seems his most sincere when they’re alone and he’s encouraging Castiel, and has to take a few deep breaths to keep from going out of his mind with the happy-giddy-wild feeling it instills in him.
Dean goes abruptly silent for a moment.
“Not that I’m complaining,” Dean adds.
“They do something to the blood. I had to make sure it was still yours.”
“You think there’s more pictures in the other records?” he wonders aloud, and Charlie goes back to the trunk, carefully sliding records from their sleeves to check.
“Told you to keep your eyes on the road,” Dean teases, and Castiel rolls his eyes as he shifts back into drive.
“We couldn’t stop it,” Jack tells him. “Everyone just kept disappearing.”
“Okay,” he says, a dim hope unfurling in his chest at the thought that he might still be able to help Castiel track this man down. “Thanks for the help, Sammy.”
“It wasn’t a
As often as he’s been tempted to throw out the planned surprise in favor of instant gratification in the days since, he’s glad he stuck to the original plan.
“Whoa, hey. Wait. What’s going on?”
Dean kneads his fingers into the backs of Castiel’s thighs and presses his lips to his stomach. Lets them linger and darts his tongue over warm skin. Castiel sinks his hands into Dean’s hair, hesitant and gentle, and Dean tilts his face up to look at him before he pulls back slightly, though his hands continue trailing up and down his legs.
Castiel’s phone buzzes again a moment later.
“It’s been following us since Nebraska,” he says, eyeing the minivan and gripping the steering wheel with tense, bruised knuckles. “It switched hosts, but it’s the same one. I can see its teeth.”
It’s cold again.
“What?”
To clarify, it’s not Lucifer we’re looking for. Just his child. 👶 We already know where Lucifer is.
swim in this lake, right? It’s not just for fishing?”
Somehow, John looks at him and still sees his son. Dean doesn’t know whether to be thankful or furious. He doesn’t know if he wants to be spared when his mother and brother were not, but he gets no choice, and John bundles him back into the car, and they drive. They drive for miles.
Dean grimaces.
“Will you let me?”
“Yeah. In my time, these records are all up in the attic in the same chest your jacket was in. Just wrote a note for Charlie on one of them to prove I’m not crazy.”
drive my car. I don’t even really like Sam driving my car.”
“You smell gas?” Henry asks, startled, and Castiel shakes his head.
“So she heard something?”
Dean had just turned seventeen when he first picked it up.
“Yep.”
Castiel listens to it all as if through a wall. His breath grows more and more shallow.
“Yeah. It’s nothing serious.”
“Deloreaned?” Castiel squints, and glances at Hannah who frowns along with him.
“I was kinda hoping you could help me with something.”
One moment, the air filled with sound and fury, the sky swarming with angry spirits, screaming as they’re dragged down through the ruptured earth and into Hell, and the next—nothing.
“I, uh. Don’t really know how to answer that,” Dean admits.
— grazing on the bluestem grass, is a white-tailed deer. Her ears flick from side to side as she snuffles along the ground, and they watch her in silence for almost five minutes before a loud group of campers further down the bank startle her away.
“I set it to play my entire library at random. Grandpa got me into all the classic jazz and blues stuff when I was young.”
Dean dips his hand into the water, swirling it around and skimming over Castiel’s submerged forearm with his fingertips. “Water’s not too hot?” he asks.
Finally, Castiel eases the truck off the road, rumbling downhill and into a small clearing by the water. The space is flanked on two sides by a thicket of bur oak and hackberry, and the edge of the lake scattered with giant chunks of limestone. Castiel maneuvers his truck as far down as he can go, turning around so the nose is pointed back the way they’d come.
Shit sorry. Friend of the Winchesters?
He’s glad to hear that Dean sounds sheepish, but Castiel still doesn’t open his eyes until he hears him close the bathroom door. He heaves himself up out of the tub and takes a breath before looking at his reflection. His cheeks are burning scarlet, the blush spreading all the way down to his chest.
It’s only a moment before Henry Winchester, a gangly young man of nineteen and the son of Castiel’s landlord, arrives on the other side. He pulls the door open with a smile.
The last time he woke up in his bed, he’d had a nervous flock of butterflies in his stomach, because—
Sam shakes his head.
“Oh my
“There was nothing there for me,” Castiel says. “You know that. I
“So…”
Shifting forward, Dean’s chest bumps against Castiel’s knee, and he tilts his chin up as Castiel leans down meet him.
— please, just— too much—
“Sugar,” he says finally. “And honey.”
“Come back,” Dean murmurs, his palm sliding up Castiel’s chest and around the back of his neck. “Kiss me again.”
There are men, Castiel knows, who came back from the war with scars in their minds greater than those on their bodies. Standing in his empty attic, looking for the strange visitor who clambered up the ladder not thirty seconds ago only to vanish into thin air, it occurs to him for the first time that he might be one of them.
idea,” Castiel says, his nose scrunching a little as he smiles. “But not the best one, either.” He touches Dean’s shin. “Here, climb onto my shoulders. I’ll carry you the rest of the way.”
“So you’re rocking the boat.”
“No, it’s alright. I understand.”
Charlie is already nodding, and she quickly searches something on her phone before nodding even more, turning the screen to show him.
big enough to hold an accordion”, he takes a moment to find the best approach.
“Close your eyes.”
“What if I don’t, though?”
Cas closes his eyes and let's out an unsteady breath. He nods. Licks his lower lip. Opens his eyes again and looks over at Dean.
He’s not expecting the voice to come from behind him.
Charlie just smiles at him as she heads back to the living room, phone in hand.
letting it do its thing.”
But despite his effort, he can’t find even one good reason to argue that wouldn’t expose the truth before they’ve hashed it out. Neither, it seems, can Dean.
, but it’s close enough. Castiel nods. Bartłomiej gives a small smile, gesturing for Castiel to come into the room properly.
He was
It’s started to drizzle again when he steps outside, making the early morning air smell fresh and cool. Dean has come to wait under the awning with two duffle bags and his laptop slung across his shoulders, Castiel’s coat and jacket hooked over a suit bag on his forearm.
“Thank you for allowing me into your home,” he says, though he wonders if any of them speak enough English for the phrase to mean much.
Cas does, and Dean feels it in every molecule of himself, like light that warms him from within. “C’mon, sweetheart,” he breathes against Cas’ mouth, winding his arms around Cas’ shoulders, pulling him in. “Want you closer. Please. Need you.”
“Danger Zone it is. Take it downstairs and wait in the living room.”
, reaching up to the high shelf of his closet to grab a faded old duffel bag.
“And Novak?”
“Yes,” Castiel tells him, and puts the phone in the console under the radio, turning his hand under Dean’s and linking their fingers together. “I’m good.”
“Didn’t even notice this,” he says.
Castiel glances at him with a sardonic brow and hopes it’s convincing.
“What the hell Cas?”
Dean rolls his eyes.
“No— it’s actually—” Dean yawns, blinking a few times as he reads the message again. “It’s good news for once, if you can believe it.” He quickly types something in reply before he looks up, still a little sleep-bleary. “It’s Donna. You haven’t met her yet, I don’t think.”
“Both,” he agrees. His voice barely sounds like his own, but he’s distantly aware that even though she interrupted his attempt at calming down, she’s distracted him enough that he’s starting to feel a little better anyway.
For a while, Castiel just listens while Dean details his plan for the following day’s fishing expedition. As far as he’s concerned, the most important part of fishing is the time he gets to spend with Dean. He’d just as soon sit on the edge of the water without the rod if it meant he could enjoy Dean’s company.
“Quit judging me and just look.”
“I think...”
“—so it’s gonna raise questions if some other agency is suddenly showing up to give him the third degree, y’know?”
“You’re welcome,” Castiel snaps back.
He feels foolish for doing so, but he writes Dean a letter.
“Five— goddamn—” his voice cracks, his good hand lifting to reach out. “Sammy. Sam, I’m so sorry. You were just a kid, I— are you—”
As they’d told Donna, nephilim aren’t exactly a frequent occurrence, and the amount of lore available on them is negligible at best. Still, he wants to be sure they have as much information as possible if there’s a chance they’re going to catch up with Kelly soon.
“You included angels in the list, Dean. How was I supposed to take it?”
For a moment, Dean looks incredibly caught out, but it shifts quickly into a grin that’s almost prideful.
His good hand is inches from the doorknob before he hesitates.
“Maybe,” he admits. “But if we stick to interviewing civilians and avoid actually running into any feds or local cops, we should be fine. And really… I’m not sure what else we can do. This guy Parker has already spoken to an agent—“
Near the ceiling, there’s a single narrow window, and the moonlight that filters through its dusty pane catches on the buttons on Dean’s jacket, reflects bright in his eyes as he turns to look back at Castiel.
“It’s… in my time, it’s still not… it’s not perfect. But I don’t have to hide it. My family knows, my friends know. Dad was the only one who had any kind of problem, but Mom laid down the law pretty hard. He’s gone now, anyhow. And I mean, I haven’t brought anyone home in a while. Like… years. I was nineteen the last time I seriously dated anyone--this girl I went to school with, Lisa. And I a friends-with-benefits thing with this guy named Victor back in Lawrence after I got discharged, but not since I moved here.”
“Yes?”
“We can try.”
“I have two older brothers, but I haven’t spoken to either of them in years, and I don’t intend to.”
Reaching out, Castiel touches the crook of his elbow.
“Yeah, but we won’t still be on the phone, then. Gimme a sneak preview.”
and hadn’t wanted to put it down.
But he doesn’t.
“If it helps, I can assure you that you’re not,” Castiel offers, and Parker gives him a look suggesting that it does not, in fact, help. Dean just shrugs at him in a way that seems to say,
Dean glares at him.
Now, he pulls his door shut sharply, relishing the way that the heavy thud startles Sam into lifting his gaze.
“Alright, what d’ya got?”
It’s the silvery-warm color of pre-dawn sky, stretching out between them like a reaching hand. The sight makes him falter in his step.
, than giving her the space to know him for herself. It certainly didn’t give her the chance to say anything in return.
PHEW. Okay. This has been a mountain of nonsense. I can’t imagine anyone got this far, but if you did, thanks again! More stuff coming soooooon.
Dean sighs.
Dean sits on his bedroom floor for almost an hour after she leaves before he remembers how long that translates to for Castiel, and the thought of him spending even another minute agonizing over Dean finding the letter has him on his feet and racing to grab the jacket.
“If only,” Dean smirks, bright-eyed as he shuffles forward, shifting his hands higher until his fingers slip beneath the edge of Castiel’s underwear. He plucks at the fabric, pulling it taut and then letting it loose, over and over, until Castiel is hard and aching. The sensation is at once too much and nowhere near enough. It’s maddening. Castiel’s mouth falls open and his eyes sink closed, and when Dean finally pulls his cock out and
“Dean, you’re never gonna convince me that you time traveled.”
“Interesting theory.”
Dean wonders despite himself, and Sam’s heavy footfalls carry him into the room just in time for Dean to let out another helpless sob.
, the sign reads—and Dean realizes that wherever they are, it’s nowhere he knows. He’s not even sure which direction they’re headed in, or what John intends to do when they get to where they’re going.
From the other end of the bench, the elderly woman narrows her watery eyes in his direction. Castiel fights off the knee-jerk, cornered-animal impulse to tell her to mind her own business, and offers a tight smile instead.
He’s relieved by Dean’s returned good mood, but can’t quite shake the feeling that there’s something more they need to talk about.
When he reaches the door, Jack pauses to look back at him.
flows through the thin walls of the tent. In the dim glow of filtered firelight, Castiel opens his eyes and sings along.
{iii}
“Honestly?” Castiel says quietly before he drains his glass and returns it to the table with a hollow clink. “I’d rather not.”
“Hey. What are you doing?”
Dean’s been keeping track by scratching a mark for each day into the soft wood of the staircase railing so that he knows how quickly he’s going through his supplies. It’s harder when they stay in one place like this. With no receipts to scavenge, no billboards to read, no cars to count, he can’t keep track of time unless he makes note of the sunset.
“I don’t care if it’s the smart thing. I want to be selfish. I want to be foolish and reckless and--”
He’s already been waiting for several hours, but though he knows it’s likely that Dean won’t be here until much later in the evening, he can’t help but count the minutes as they pass.
Castiel has lived through more nightmares than he cares to think of, but this one--being unexpectedly naked in the presence of a virtual stranger--is so mundane when compared to the rest that he’s more mortified by his own reaction to Dean’s sudden appearance than he is by the situation itself.
chill.
With a level of determined focus he once reserved for practicing guitar or figuring out an engine problem under Bobby’s watchful eye, he makes his way from room to room, making sure the symbols are drawn as precisely as possible around every point of entry.
Dean looks over his shoulder to read it.
“Last week I traveled back in time and met him in 1945.”
“I didn’t—Dean? Dean, what’s wrong?”
“Do you want me to kiss you?” Castiel asks, though he knows the answer.
“What are we supposed to do?”
“They must have,” Dean says. “Or she wouldn’t have kept doing them.”
Dean stares at him. “I’m not having this conversation here.”
Charlie looks at him with suspicion.
“Well, let’s go.”
“On second thought—” Dean pushes to his feet with an undignified grunt and kicks off his shoes. “Too old to be kneeling on the floor. Scoot back.”
Dry tufts of bluestem scratch against his bare calves when he jumps out of the driver's seat and stretches his back. Across the hood, Dean’s already stripping his overshirt off and preparing to run to the water, cool weather be damned.
“I’m sorry, Cas,” he finally says. “I can’t give it.”
Bao Jianhong had been a scholar in life—a perpetual student even once reaching the top of his field—and his hunger for knowledge, for the joy of learning, did not ease once he passed through to the afterlife. The little corner of heaven that was his library was cluttered but comfortable, and the light that shone through the tall windows was gold as the hour before sunset, glittering off dust motes and making the whole space warm and welcoming. Even the smell of the place was soothing—lignin permeating the air with a faint hint of vanilla as the books on all their rows of shelves aged according to Jianhong’s memory.
“Magic jacket is all I got. Did you piss off a wizard?”
For a moment, it looks like Dean might say no, but then he nods and slips his hands into his pockets and starts walking. Cas falls into step beside him.
“Good question,” he says, then huffs out a laugh. “Last week, kinda. But... I don’t know. I really like him, Charlie. More than I’ve liked anyone in a long time, y’know? But there’s… complications.”
“I set out a spare toothbrush for you on the sink,” Dean says after a moment, and Castiel turns to look up at him.
“It’s not that.”
Castiel follows him moments later, watching for the chutes of his men below him. He doesn’t see a single one. He hopes it’s just because of the smoke.
“She’s—“ Dean pauses, corrects himself before John starts to suspect that he’s in any way doubtful. “
With pursed lips, Rowena stares at him for a long moment before she finally nods.
He pauses as he brings the car to a stop, the traffic outside at a standstill as the tow truck driver hops out to set up several orange cones. Castiel takes the opportunity to face Dean fully. The truck’s blinking lights reflect in Dean’s eyes. Castiel aches at the disbelief he still sees there.
“Can I ask you something?”
“I'm sorry, Mary,” John says, and his eyes are wild, his face red as his hands.
“You boys have earned it,” Mary tells him.
A nervous sweat gathers on Dean’s neck and soaks into his hair where it’s grown a little too long to manage, and it makes his entire body tremble with cold. His skin itches. His scalp itches. His throat tingles, discomfort rapidly edging into pain. He ignores it all. He can’t risk any unnecessary movement or sound, not while the strangers are still in the house.
Dean shifts his broken wrist out of the way as he uses his good hand to latch the belt. The fact that it’s not already fastened makes him feel slightly better about the fact that he can’t remember getting into the truck. The dull ache in his temple—and a bump, he finds as he gingerly lifts his fingers to graze over it—draws forth a vague memory of his head smacking against the roof as he was shoved into the passenger seat.
When Dean wanders back up from the water, it’s a little after eight o’clock, and the sun has almost completely disappeared over the horizon. The firelight makes him seem to glow as he approaches. With his heart in his throat, Castiel watches him, almost hypnotized by the way he moves. It’s certainly not news to him that Dean is attractive, but it still catches him off guard sometimes.
“Do you want my opinion?”
“Tonight,” Dean murmurs.
Castiel hands over the bait and tackle box, and Dean sets to work attaching the lures and baiting their hooks with careful, practiced fingers. It should be disgusting to watch as he spears the slimy bait, but Castiel is well past denying that there’s very little Dean could do to dissuade him from thinking he’s incredible.
This time, when he gets Cas back, he's keeping him.
“Hello, Hannah,” Castiel says. “Do you recognize me?”
With every passing moment, the silence grows more obtrusive, and Castiel is at a loss for how to breach it. They’ve been on the road for almost an hour before Sam finally speaks.
“Parker, I’m sure I don’t need to remind you that obstructing a federal investigation is—“
“I—you saw all that?” Dean croaks, and Cas hums in response.
“I’m sorry,” he tries to say, but halfway through the word his breath catches in his throat, so he swallows and tries again. “I needed to—how is he?”
hurt he thinks. It should hurt like hell.
The way Dean had looked at him earlier that night had him feeling recklessly hopeful, and he’d been halfway convinced that they’d arrive at the Rexford Motor Inn, and their hands would touch as they walked to the room, and some understanding would pass between them.
“He’s home,” he says, then amends. “Well,
“Many have come before. Why should you be granted the gift of eternal life when they have not?”
Looking in through the door with North Street Finery printed on the glass, Dean can see a customer standing on the step stool. Beside him, scratching measurements into a yellow pad is a man more familiar than Dean can reasonably understand.
Castiel smiles, pleased.
Pulling off, Castiel looks up at him, and Dean finally lets go of the pillow to reach down and touch his face. When he swipes his thumb over Castiel’s lower lip, Castiel catches it with his teeth, biting down gently. Dean’s eyes focus on the action as if he’s committing it to memory. Perhaps he is. Castiel can’t help but hope so.
“Could you do it again?”
First established in 1863 when Normal, Illinois, was still North Bloomington on the map, Needle and Thread began it’s life as North Street Finery. The pride and joy of siblings Harvey and Harriet Winchester, a tailor and a dressmaker respectively, the shop sat on a busy corner opposite a general store and a tavern. Harvey’s son took over in 1885, and for over a century the shop was run and owned by the Winchester family.
to stay away, that you chose someone else…”
The rhythmic hum of the sewing machine is almost hypnotic, and Dean lets it lull him into a state of calm in which thought becomes all but non-existent.
“Any news?”
“Didn’t we agree to skip the big conversations?”
“I wish you could see yourself,” Cas tells him. “How beautiful you are like this.”
It’s not what he wants. Not who he wants to be.
“Uh, yeah… no problem.”
“Just--”
There’s no real attic beyond the manhole, he finds—just a crawlspace that he can barely squeeze into. Dean pulls himself along on his belly, trying and failing to avoid putting strain on his wrist as he moves toward the one hole in the roof that he can see, over by the chimney.
“I hope so.”
“We can’t,” he says with regret. “Not now. Not here. But if you still want to try, when it’s safe, when we’re home…”
“Hmm?”
“I know things have been rough. I know I’ve… I haven’t been fair to you. Everything kept blowing up, but it wasn’t fair of me to blame you. Even… Jack, even what happened with— with mom. I
” Sam’s voice breaks on his brother’s name, and he gulps in a breath before he continues. “
“I spoke with him for a couple of hours last night, and he was coherent and rational for most of that conversation. But… I’ll be honest with you all—Dean’s not in great shape. Psychologically speaking, the past five years have done some serious damage. When the paramedics tried to move him from the basement where he was found, he panicked and fought them off to the point that he fell back down the stairs, and he’s fractured his collarbone and broken his arm in the process.”
He hears Castiel’s startled yelp before he sees him.
He’s still sitting there when he hears a creak from the attic, and followed by a few shuffling footsteps and a knock against the ceiling.
At Dean’s gesture, Castiel leans forward to speak, angling toward the phone so that he can be sure it hears him.
Two gray concrete walls, two red brick. A desk, a bed, a narrow bookshelf. A table with two chairs, where Dean had spent several late nights trying to convince Cas that his insomnia was, in fact, a feature and not a bug.
Eventually he drifts off, and dreams of flying to the moon with Dean as his co-pilot.
“We’re gonna figure out how to get you back home, Cas. I’ve got a plan.”
This is the first time Dean has so much as mentioned any potential change to that plan, and it’s enough to make his chest feel tight.
“Then why did she—?”
“Yeah, I bet you did,” Dean grins and wriggles his brow. “You tell Eileen I said thanks next time you see her.”
“No, I think I’ll leave most of them for Sam. These should do for now.”
He pictures it in frantic flashes; himself on his knees, Cas’ hand in his hair, tilting his head back as he strokes himself, just out of reach. Cas spreading him out on the floor, shifting that same tight grip from his wrist to his knee and pushing Dean’s thigh to his chest so Cas can slide into him deep without letting him look away. And—Dean twitches in his jeans at the sudden, dizzying thought—Cas teasing him without a touch, just his grace, that cold-hot-electric tingle that runs through his body every time Cas heals him, focused and intent under his skin.
The attic awaits.
“I’d only been back a few weeks,” Castiel nods.
“That’s not gonna work every time you want to distract me,” he says.
Castiel spells it aloud, and Charlie gets to work. Dean wanders into her kitchen and makes them all coffee without a word, and returns to sit beside Castiel on the couch while they wait.
‘Figuring something out’ proves more difficult than expected.
“Yeah?”
Dean might react poorly. Worse, he might react
“Sure about that?”
Tilting his face into the crook of Cas’ neck, Dean holds on, holds still, putting off the inevitable separation for as long as he can. He wants to keep Cas like this, just for now. Just a little while longer. Hold him inside, safe and
“No, you said that watching it was ‘a level of masochism just shy of self-immolation’,” Dean says, dropping his voice in an admittedly—irritatingly—accurate impersonation, and then snorting when Castiel scowls at him. “What? You did.”
WAR HERO MISSING
“I remember,” Hannah says, thumb tracing the red thread. “My mother, she was
, he thinks. Pressing a kiss to his shoulder, Dean runs his hand down the length of Cas’ spine and looks up to meet his eyes. Cas is smiling back at him. Dean hopes it’s the first of many to come.
No, he thinks as he steadies his gaze on their lead plane and presses the button on his interphone. Red is far too great a color for War.
“You really can’t figure it out?”
Belphegor herds them all into the library like an overexcited sheepdog, and Rowena follows behind with the measured pace of a queen to give them their instructions:
Dean wants him to break the spell.
With every word that passes his lips, he feels as though he’s excising another tumor. Cutting out the malignant rage that’s been festering in him for longer than he can remember and freeing himself from its control.
Castiel blinks, slow.
“Nah. Let’s go visit those lemurs before they kick us out.”
“Yes, I know how it sounded.”
Sam’s cell phone starts to ring before he can respond, and while he answers, Dean’s longing reaches a fever pitch. It’s only seconds before hurt and anger and confusion and fear all wind together to wrap around it, turning the need to something bitter and awful, and when Castiel unravels it all he’s ruined by what he finds. Dean wishes the longing weren’t there at all. On some level, he’s thinking that his life—that all of their lives—would be easier if he didn’t feel this way about Castiel in the first place.
This time, an engine is lost along with a decent chunk of fuselage.
“Is it not essentially the same joke you made at my expense?”
“You seem nervous,” Dean tells him, and Castiel laughs aloud.
“I’m thinkin’ we could do the bass for lunch, then saugeye for dinner,” Dean says over his shoulder as he crouches down to wash his hands in the lake. “What d’you think?”
Pressing a little more firmly against Dean’s sweat-damp skin, edging closer to the place where Dean wants him, Castiel stares at him expectantly.
Three hours with nothing but the stuttering radio of Jo’s dinged up old Corolla to distract him leaves far too much space for Castiel’s thoughts to run wild, and by the time he arrives in Kansas City on Monday morning, he’s just about buzzing out of his skin.
For a moment, Dean just watches him. The way he stops every few feet and checks the sky like he’s expecting to see something looking back.
As though it’s always been this easy. Maybe it has been.
You thought you were
“What are you--” Castiel starts, his voice rougher than ever, and Dean kisses him again before he answers.
“Yeah, Cas?”
He almost writes
“Almost.” He gestures for Dean to stand by the statue. “I want to get a photo of you first.”
“It depends.”
“Will that be enough time?”
It would be easy for Dean to feign ignorance. To pretend that he doesn’t know the answer, to skirt the truth and push it down and let the pain of holding it alone slowly poison him. It would be easy. But taking the easy route is what got him here. It’s what stopped him from ever being honest with Cas while he still had the chance. He’s not going to keep making that mistake.
“What?”
Dean’s in the bathroom, toothbrush hanging from his mouth as he digs through the medicine cabinet in search of a fresh bar of soap, when he hears his cellphone ding. It’s pretty late for most people he knows on a Monday, so with a frown he finishes up and makes his way out across the entryway into his bedroom.
“Yeah, yeah.”
Clicking on them only makes the video lag more, and while they load Dean watches his brother talk out of sync with the audio.
They’d driven for two days straight after that. Looping back and forth over state lines and into small town after small town on the hunt for whatever arcane sign John needed to prove to himself that a location would protect them.
Dean narrows his eyes.
Something about the sight of them all sends Castiel back to an afternoon several years ago, sitting with Dean on a pair of park benches in a small midwestern town. They’d barely known one another back then. Dean had made him laugh.
Before Castiel can reply, the waitress is back, delivering Dean’s breakfast with an embarrassed look on her face that can only mean she overheard the last part of their conversation.
“Don’t let me forget to grab your dad’s fishing stuff before we go,” he tells Dean. “He said we could borrow it.”
“But you didn’t.”
“And you’re the idiot who likes me anyway. Deal with it. Ten and two, by the way.”
Laughing, Mary lightly shoves at the side of his head through the window.
In the end, curiosity wins over comfort, and he sucks in a sharp breath as he slowly makes his way across the lake, biting down on the inside of his cheek when the water level rises.
Ruqayya only nods.
Castiel just holds it out toward him, staring until Dean sighs and rounds the truck to take it back. He tosses it back through the open driver’s side window.
Sometimes, in those dreams, Dean’s arms would rise to wrap around Castiel just as tight. His hands would press warmth into Castiel’s shoulders and the back of his neck, and his breath would shift the hair behind Castiel’s ear, and his heart would pound
Shuffling closer, into the space between Castiel’s splayed legs, Dean runs his hands back down over his chest and presses his mouth to Castiel’s throat. Something swoops in Castiel’s pelvis at the feeling of Dean’s lips, warmth spreading as Dean kisses him again and again, trailing to his shoulder and then his chest as Dean’s hands wander low over his stomach.
“Usually salad practically gives me hives, but this has converted me.”
“I love Dean with everything I have.”
Shrugging, Dean pushes up from the mattress and heads for his still-packed duffel, digging through it until he finds the old first-aid kit inside. Though he’s making every effort to appear nonchalant, Castiel can see how much he needs to do this. How much he needs to do something. It’s there in the way he sorts through the contents of the kit, picking things out and reading labels before tossing them to the side; in the way he carefully sets the bandages he wants on his desk. He’s focused. Determined.
“That explains it,” Sam says.
Castiel pushes open the door, and Dean gets a whiff of beer and cigarettes. Castiel looks over at him as he holds the door, waiting for Dean to head inside. He raises an eyebrow in question. Dean shakes his head.
“Yeah,” Dean says.
He knows everything John has told him, and knows that as long as John believes it, he has to act like he believes it too.
“I’ll wait.”
“Yeah,” Dean says. “He’s obviously pretty important to Cas, so--”
Dean stares at him for a long moment, and Castiel watches as a bead of sweat makes a slow trail over his throat, his chest. His Adam’s apple twitches on another shaky swallow. Under his skin, the demonic smoke obscuring his soul crackles with electricity. Castiel wants to rip it out of him with his bare hands.
The guilt of that realization isn’t something he can stand to look at too closely. Dean doesn’t know how he has room for all the different kinds of guilt inside of him, but every single thing sits like a stone, heavy in his gut.
“Yeah. He says he can help, but he’ll need his laptop, and he’s not gonna get back to the bunker ’til about two,” Dean replies, thumbs moving rapidly as he types his response. He looks up when he’s done, and tosses his phone onto the bed. It bounces a few times before it settles.
“For all we know, she’s playing both sides,” Dean says, and shuts the laptop with an irritated groan. He pokes it back into the bag at his feet. “At least we’ve got something to go on, I guess.”
“Dammit.”
s, Dean shuffles closer to the glass, cupping his hand around his eyes to watch lightning crackle through dark cloud.
“Well, tell the museum thanks if she knows anything,” Dean says.
“No,” Hannah insists. “These are for hope, and guidance, but not for--” she claps her palm over her fist, making a solid
Everything feels hopeless. Pointless. Dean doesn’t know how to save the world when there’s nobody left in it. Doesn’t know if there’s even any reason left to try. He’s not sure what possesses him to start walking toward the town, but he’s halfway down the road before he knows it.
After all—if the Winchesters are even home, if they even agree to speak with him, he can’t presume to impose upon them for any longer than they offer. He should have called. Should have given them some indication that he was coming.

“Damn, you’re right. Didn’t think of that.”
If Cas’ face is any indication, it looks as though he’s given up trying.
“I’ll give you everything you want,” Castiel tells him, and tilts out of reach when Dean lets out a needful sound and tries to kiss him again. Hums a low sound of rebuke. “But I still need you to ask.”
“Yeah,” Dean says. His voice comes out a little rough, and he clears his throat and repeats his reply. “I’m good.”
“So what were all the records in the trunk?” she asks once he’s done, and Dean frowns.
He cries for his mother, and for Sam, and for Cas, and for himself. He cries for John, too, or what’s left of him. He cries until his head aches, until snot is running down his face, and his chest hurts, and he coughs and chokes on the dust around him. And when he finally stops, when he finally climbs back down into the house and drags the ladder back outside to climb onto the roof and patch the hole, he does it with an emptiness in his core that he’s not sure he’ll ever be able to fill again.
Twenty-five thousand feet above Kampinos Forest, Lieutenant Castiel Novak sees nothing but a sea of gray. Smoke obscures the treetops. If he’s very lucky, that same smoke will obscure the sight of his plane from the ground.
“It’s a great help, Donna,” Castiel says.
“...did you seriously just compare Cas to
“Yeah, I kinda don’t feel like heading back just yet anyway,” Dean admits, and looks back out the window. Castiel follows his gaze, and his eyes settle on the building across the street. It’s one of Red Cloud’s two motels—a dingy little place that seems mostly occupied by truckers taking the opportunity to sleep in a full-sized bed before they get back on the road, if its parking lot is anything to go by. It’s likely less comfortable than most of the places the Winchesters have stayed in over the years, but it would afford them the privacy needed to talk, so Castiel thinks it would do just fine.
He just didn’t think they’d ever get here.
Did he believe that Dean cared about him at all? Did Dean ever make it clear enough to Cas that his presence was imperative to Dean’s happiness? Probably not, he realizes, or he couldn’t have done this. He wouldn’t have been happy in those last moments if he’d known that Dean would be so hurt by his loss.
The silence only seems more intense as they move through the bunker. Every footstep seems thunderous; every squeaking hinge an alarm designed specifically to raise Sam from slumber, to send him barrelling out into the hallway to tell Castiel in no uncertain terms that he’s fooling himself if he thinks he and Dean can have this, that they’re making a mistake, that this is doomed from the start, destined for failure, destined to crash and—
He plans to pull out the chair beside him, but instead he just sinks down right where he is and presses the knuckles of one hand against the floor. Grounds himself as best he can. Castiel is silent for a long while, and Dean tries to remember the breathing exercises he learned in the short time he spent seeing a therapist.
“I’ll gladly accept any alternative descriptions, but that’s what you just described.”
“That’s not new. I always miss my wings. But right now the feeling is particularly strong.”
“Did Dean see?” Bobby cuts in before he can finish, and Victor shakes his head.
“No, seriously. It’s
Dean’s heart pounds.
“I regretted not taking a picture last time,” Castiel tells him. “I want to remember you.”
Dean can’t remember a lot about those first days after Jack was born—his head had been spinning, sick with grief—but he does have flashes. Moments. Jack mirroring his every action in that motel before he learned to be more subtle about it.
In two more years, he thinks to himself, Dean would have been declared dead in absentia.
“You’d want that?”
do is follow orders. Do as he’s told. Get it done.
“We should be safe here for now,” John says, wiping his hands on his jeans. Black smears on blue denim. “Just while I get some rest, and then we need to keep moving.”
“I’m thinking.”
It’s not until he pulls away and notices the dark color of the pillow Dean’s laying on that he realizes something is amiss.
Glancing over at Jack, he sees the furrow in his brow and blurts out the first thing that comes to mind.
For a long moment, Dean looks at him, studies him. His tongue darts out over his lower lip.
He doesn’t elaborate or wait to see if Cas is following him; just turns and heads back inside to wake Sam.
Not even a whole day. It seems impossible.
“Where you going?”
With a look at the empty bottles on his nightstand, he lets out a slow breath, and comes to a decision.
For a while, they sit side by side, just listening as the songs change. From What Is This Thing Called Love?, it jumps to Blue Oyster Cult’s Don’t Fear The Reaper. Some of the lyrics to Led Zeppelin’s Lemon Song make Castiel lift his brow, but he doesn’t comment. Al Green, Prince, more Led Zeppelin, Bob Seger, Motorhead, Queen, and another Led Zeppelin song play before Castiel clears his throat to speak.
“You mean—”
The charm works like a—well. It works exactly as it’s supposed to.
be able to keep up, after all.
“Magic jacket,” Dean says with a shrug. “I’ve honestly got no idea how it works, but... that’s the gist.”
thinking it, right?”
Maybe if he’d just—
From his place in the passenger seat, Castiel can see the faint shape of his own mouth on Dean’s neck, peeking out past the edge of his dress shirt collar. He hadn’t meant to leave a mark, but when Dean had emerged from the bathroom in a cloud of steam, hair dripping wet onto his bare shoulders, a too-small motel towel slung loosely around his hips—he’d been helpless to stop himself from slamming the laptop and crossing the room.
Dean’s hands ache with the need to reach out and offer Cas comfort, but still he finds himself veering into hostility. Mary is dead because Dean trusted Jack, and the only reason he ever let his guard down around the kid is standing there with a forlorn crease in his brow.
“So, you’re not mad?”
For a long few moments, Sam studies his face as though he’s going to see something more than what’s on the surface, and Dean feels a mounting sense of dread at the thought that his brother is going to try and start psychoanalyzing him. But Sam just lets out an unsteady breath, and nods his concession.
“I thought a lot about how you might taste, if I took you into my mouth.” Tilting his head in thought, he reaches between them to touch Dean’s erection. Watches the shape that Dean’s mouth makes when he teases his fingers through the dark hair at the base; the way his eyes flutter when he skims them up to the wet tip; the way he bites at his lips and squeezes his eyes shut when Castiel shifts his hand low again to rub his knuckles against Dean’s perineum. “The sounds you might make if I stimulated your prostate with my fingers before I fucked you. Would you enjoy that?”
Castiel smiles and traces his fingers over the bow of Dean’s lips.
“Of course.”
Castiel
It’s not as though he’s new to the experience of physical desire. He’s felt it before, as an angel and as a human, and even acted on it as recently as this morning when he’d been seconds from climbing onto Dean’s lap before his injury had thrown a figurative wet blanket on the moment they were sharing. But that had been instinctual, almost involuntary in how deep-seated the compulsion was. In every instance, it’s been an indecipherable kind of hunger. A vague, restless need that he’s only ever managed to satisfy through trial and error. This is different. This desire is conscious, and specific, and agonizing beyond belief.
The receipt says
“He told me about the note you put up on the door. That you only took it down after Colorado. That you— that you took it as a rejection, to see me there.”
“Yeah, good plan.”
His eyes are pleading, his tone soft. Sam’s been strangely gentle with Rowena for a while now, and when he’s got the time to spare, Dean’s going to give that the analysis it deserves. For now, though—
“You absolutely did, and you know it.”
as the likely time until Dean’s next visit, but he can’t seem to help himself.
Dean wriggles his brow again and tilts his chin back into the bathroom. Pointedly. His eyes are still sleepy despite the coffee, and there’s a crease on his cheek where he’s had it pressed up against Castiel’s coat overnight. He looks completely ridiculous.
Not long after Castiel struck out on his own and moved into a little brick house a few blocks away from Bobby’s garage, he’d started having a recurring dream where Dean would arrive at his door.
Dean lowers his hands to his sides and exhales, and slowly, Castiel takes in the sight of his body.
“Here,” she points, and he steps closer to see. “You put
Slowly, he flips through the records until he finds the one Charlie picked, and he slides it from the sleeve.
“I was fighting for
, he’s—
, it follows the same line—rain showers with perfect water pressure. Baking an apple pie from scratch with a perfect crust. Spending long nights under the stars with the people he loves. Road trips to nowhere. Toes in the sand. Composing mixtapes that flow perfectly from one song to the next, to tell a truth that he can’t manage to put into words.
They dance anyway, a swaying shuffle, and Castiel’s heart pounds hard as they shift closer together. When he’s finally pressed to Dean from hip to chest, the thin stubble of his jaw catching against the same on Dean’s cheek, he takes a long, deep breath and releases it, squeezing Dean’s hand in his own.
“Sure.”
It’s been deeply enjoyable, and something about being able to feel the subtle grooves in the steering wheel where Dean’s hands have rested more often than they haven’t, about knowing that he’s being trusted with something that Dean is so attached to when Dean has always had so little to call his own, has made Castiel feel close to him in a way that he never anticipated.
Castiel doesn’t reply, and Dean takes an unsteady step forward and almost slips again. He swears under his breath and looks for a safe place to step. Jumping down is just asking for a sprained ankle.
and Castiel listens to him for a little while longer before wiping the dirt from his hands and pushing to his feet.
“You love me,” Dean says.
“Well, I stand corrected,” Dean says with a laugh, turning to head for the exit.
He used Sam’s library card to borrow it, and finished it three days later. He borrowed
“There were fawns!”
Dean gets the distinct impression that he hadn’t expected to encounter anyone out here.
If he were being honest, he’d admit that not only did he hate the last movie in the series, he also hated the four that preceded it. But when given the choice between seeing an excruciatingly predictable horror movie in Dean’s company, or spending the evening at home alone while his best friend went out with Benny after the movie instead, it was a no-brainer.
“Yeah,” Dean breathes out, then laughs, slightly hysterical. His fingers flex on Castiel’s wrist. Castiel looks down at his hand, then back up at Dean as he nudges in closer and pulls him into a hug. “Yeah.”
Dean swallows hard and nods. Pushes out another breath.
you had time to send me pictures of some stupid dinosaur but couldn’t pick up the phone to tell me that literal satan spawn is on the loose??
“I know.”
“Fuck off.”
Dean just blinks at him.
He’s noticed that Cas has been doing that sort of thing more, lately. Leaning, sitting, fixing his hair in the rearview. Little things. Human things. Dean’s also been trying
The drive to Sycamore takes a few hours--just long enough for Dean to start worrying. There’s always a chance that he’s wrong. Maybe Castiel won’t be there. Maybe he

Dean rolls his eyes, spreading his arms in the water to keep afloat.
, and her eyes… they turned yellow.”
,” he sighs. “You’re right. We’re gonna need to swing by the bunker, anyway. I didn’t exactly pack for a hunt, and as much as I want to strangle him right now, we should at least let Sam know where we’re headed.”
Sam adds, “
“Seems a little unfair, if you ask me.”
“You asked what about all of this is real?” Cas says, his voice verging on desperate. “
“Not without suppressing my grace entirely, but that would also mean I’d stop healing. So,” he shrugs, then smiles. “And if I’m being entirely honest, it’s usually… nice. Having that connection. Knowing that you’re thinking of me.”
“What about Carl?”
He tugs gently on Dean’s hand and smiles.
If he had watched Dean reading them and laughed.
“Huh,” Dean says.
“You got a thing for old dudes all of a sudden, or--?”
“Good.”
The sound is anything but an incentive to stop, and Castiel briefly entertains the idea of torturing Dean with compliments for the rest of the drive. It’s incredibly tempting. He could carry on for hours, and Dean would be helpless to stop Castiel from talking, and then when they finally reach their destination he’d channel his frustration into the kind of kiss that reminds Castiel what flying feels like.
“Okay. Okay, good,” Sam’s shoulders sink with relief as he pats the side of Dean’s face. He glances up at Jack, hovering by the table, before he meets Dean’s eyes again. “Dean, what happened?”
“Oh,” Castiel says, and though Dean can tell he’s itching to know what the stories were, he doesn’t ask. “Well, a man found me. He let me into his home to rest until I could move on, and his wife, Agata, fixed my jacket.”
“I don’t need a dress,” she says, then shakes her head. “Well, I do. But I’ll trust you to choose the right stuff to make it out of. This is for Queenie.”
“That’s real coffee,” he says, breathing deep.
The silence between Dean and Sam stretches on for so long that he almost flinches when Sam speaks.
His thighs are thick and flushed pink. Castiel wants to bite them.
At his best guess, he’s gotta be pushing 60 hours without sleep at this point. That can’t be good for anyone, and it’s sure as hell catching up to him.
They fall silent, and Dean taps the phone on his knee.
“You haven’t seen this design before, though,” Dean says, disappointed, and Sam hums again.
*************************************************************
In the late 1980’s, Henry’s two young grandsons spent a week getting under his feet while their parents were away on a much-needed vacation. For those seven days, while Sammy sprawled in his playpen smashing lincoln logs together and not building much of anything, seven-year-old Dean followed his grandparents around the little shop, learning everything he could.
There’s a moment of hesitation before he steps forward. Castiel accepts a somewhat awkard hug from him before rubbing at his eyes.
The thought of actually telling Castiel out loud that he’s from the goddamn future is so laughably ridiculous that Dean can’t bring himself to do it. He looks at the phone in his hand and figures it’ll do. He holds it up.
“Of course,” Castiel tells him, and pushes to his feet. “I’m gonna…”
Several million years of practice at being a vigilant observer of humanity, capable of detecting even the slightest change in air pressure or the quietest sound from rooms away, and yet the cool leather of Dean’s boot pressed against the back of his ankle is all it takes to allow a not-remotely-stealthy waitress to walk right up and pour him a cup of coffee without his notice.
Impatient, John grips him by the wrist and drags him forward, and Dean winces as John slices through the meat of his palm again, staring intently as blood wells. After a moment, John’s entire body seems to sink with relief, and Dean pulls his hand back, stripping his flannel off to wrap around his bleeding palm.
Disconcerted as he is, he doesn’t have much of an appetite, and only makes his way through half of the beans before he gives up and returns to the attic again. He searches every last inch. There’s nowhere for the man to have disappeared to, and no sign of this attached attic that he’d claimed to have come from.
“I think there’s a shelter down on Oak street…” Charlie says as she types. “Maybe Pine? Sycamore? Willow? It’s definitely a tree name.”
“I know, it’s not that. I just… I dunno. I don’t think I’m cut out for it, Cas. I’m not that smart. I bet every single one of my teachers starts wondering who let this idiot into their class once they start grading my finals.”
“Fine. They taste like ass.”
She’s walking with her arms spread wide—not quite stumbling, but unsteady—and there’s a glowing cloud of souls swirling around her, within her, growing brighter with every spirit that she absorbs.
“So you don’t want to see them?”
As though Castiel is precisely where he should be in time and space; as though this moment, and this moment, and
“Fasten your seatbelt,” John says, and despite the blood, despite the manic look on his face, his voice sounds entirely level. Entirely calm. If Dean closed his eyes, John’s voice might be able to convince him that this is just a normal night. That they’re on their way to Sam’s lacrosse game, or heading over to Ellen’s place for a BBQ. “I think I shook them, but I can’t be sure.”
“What?”
Castiel can’t help but huff out a laugh himself, and Dean’s gaze drops to his mouth. It’s not the first time that’s happened. It’s not even the first time Castiel has noticed. It’s different now, though.
“Still. I… man, this is why I—“ Dean cuts himself off, shaking his head, and—somewhat inexplicably—an aching wave of longing stretches across the space between them. He lets out a heavy breath and returns to their previous topic. “Anyway. The Secret Service route is still our best shot at getting in the door, but maybe we can call the truth plan B? We’ll be prepared to tell him if we need to, but avoid giving the guy an existential crisis if we can.”
“Shut up, you know what I mean. I was kinda worried that things would be different if we ever did this, but we’re the same. Still us, just… more. I dunno. I’m just glad nothin’s really changed.”
“Well, she’s been keeping an ear open for anything that seems nephilim related, and it paid off. She has a lead on Kelly Kline.”
“Would that be okay with you?” Castiel asks when Sam makes no move to speak. He’s surprised by the way Sam’s expression softens.
Sliding his hand to Castiel’s cheek, Dean steps close and kisses him. The camera presses uncomfortably into his stomach.
“I missed you every fucking day,” he says at last. “Every goddamn second.”
“What do you mean,
“You’ve known Kelly since you were teenagers?”
Still, they encouraged him to speak to John himself. It wasn’t until his high school guidance counsellor pointed out that when it came to his future the only person Dean should care about disappointing was himself, that Dean finally decided to follow his own path.
knew?”
“Hey!”
The same man from before lurches up from where he’d apparently been reclining on the couch and stares at Dean with wide eyes.
“No, it’s just— look, we’ll draw attention if we’re dressed like feds, that’s all. And seeing as we’re already going to stand out by being there and not looking at the animals, we should probably try to blend as much as we can.”
“I don’t wish you any harm,” he says, the Arabic words feeling as unpracticed to him now as English was for his first few days on Earth.
Dean pulls off with a wet pop, gliding a fisted hand over the spit-slick skin.
“I’m sor—“ Castiel tries to say again, and Dean cuts him off.
“He heard your parents on the phone with me. I think they bribed him into silence with a trip to the zoo.”
“My taste is questionable at best.”
There’s just something so vindictive about the way he’d played along all those years ago—
It’s not as though he’s gone that whole time without getting himself off this way—in the first couple of months after they moved into the bunker, he’d taken full advantage of the previously unheard of level of privacy that having a room of his own afforded him, and had some particularly adventurous solo sessions—but with someone else? God no.
“So much for making it up to me,” Castiel says between laughs.
Letting go of him is almost impossible, but when he does Castiel takes his hand. He doesn’t say a word; just leads Dean across the landing and into his bedroom. Dean hesitates at the door, and Castiel takes a shaky breath before finally meeting his eye.
The look Sam gives him seems desperate. Castiel doesn’t make him ask again.
“Cas?” Dean whispers, and from his tone it seems that it’s not the first time he’s spoken. “Cas, buddy. We gotta get up.”
He scrapes the heel of his boot against the scratchy concrete underfoot, presses the fingers of his right hand against the cold metal of the bench he’s sitting on. Rubs his left against the stubble on his chin. He’s about to list the fourth sensation in his mind when a voice startles him.
Castiel isn’t exactly
A couple of yards back from the water’s edge, there’s a fallen bur oak that’s perfect for sitting on. Castiel settles down on it to finish eating the orange he’s calling breakfast. As he does, he watches Dean tread lightly a few feet away from the lake, searching for movement and scouting out the best place to cast his line.
When he finally does manage to inhale, the sound of it seems to make the world around them come unstuck. Dean turns and walks back into the bunker, slamming the heavy door behind him. Sam just stands there, expression frozen somewhere between ruth and fury.
Castiel shakes his head, but Sam stands, picking up both mugs.
He’s not sure why he thought they might. Despite all the direction changes, John isn’t driving erratically anymore. Since he tested Dean’s blood, he’s been sticking to the limit, indicating at every turn.
“Yep,” Sam says, lips popping on the P as he leans back in his office chair and crosses his arms. He’s got the same look on his face that he had when he was thirteen and had dirt on Dean that he was waiting for a chance to spill.
“Yeah, this is Robert Singer.”
, but I don’t remember the words. It was so long ago,” she shakes her head. “So long. I remember that it meant to bring the wearer of the coat to the person who needed him most, but that’s all. There is no reason why it should have worked in this way,” she tells them. “I’ve never... none of my mother’s other zagavory came true, not like this.”
Dumping the bowl of noodles on the table, he drops to his knees in front of the shelf and pulls the records out one by one, inspecting each closely before he finally finds Dean’s neat handwriting on the inner label of his Glenn Miller album.
“What
Dean makes an incredulous sound.
Dean seems to hear every version.
Dean isn’t in his room when Castiel heads inside.
stories that Sam was obsessed with for a few months when he was 13. Books where you’re given the illusion of autonomy, but ultimately doomed to wind up with one of a few predetermined endings no matter which page you turn to at the beginning. All the lines already written. All the possibilities set out in a facsimile of free choice.
“Makes sense.”
“So,” she says, curling her socked feet up onto the cushion and looking at Dean as he slumps down at the opposite end. “Any ideas?”
His mouth tastes of dried blood; his tongue feels swollen and thick in his mouth. He can’t—
“Here,” he says.
“Just... maybe if you know how his life turned out, it might help give you some closure.”
Dean frowns.
“It hurts some, though, right?”
Dean glares up at him, though his heart isn’t in it. More than anything, he’s pissed at himself for still having so much trouble with asking. With just saying what he wants when he knows Cas won’t hesitate to give it to him.
He’s been scared in his life more often than not, but with everything else, he’s pushed ahead anyway. This, though. The thing with him and Cas has always felt impossible, despite the fact that he’s 99% sure he’s not on his own. After all, there’s only so many times that you can see someone choose you, personally, over literal Heaven before it becomes clear that there’s some deep feeling there.
, Cas had said.
“If you go back to sleep, I’m gonna put the first fish I catch in your sleeping bag.”
Castiel’s breath catches, and he strains hard against Dean’s hand, braced around his chin as though he’s worried Castiel might not stay upright without it. He tilts his head to open his mouth against it. Digs his teeth in, just a little, while Dean works him open. Faster and deeper with every push.
“You should hold down the fort,” Dean says the moment Sam ends his call, and keeps right on talking when his brother looks as though he’s going to argue. “Don’t think I haven’t seen you wincing every time you’ve moved that shoulder wrong.”
Dean hesitates, his eyes flicking over to Castiel. As they’ve been talking, his muscles have been tensing, preparing for a fight. Sam might not realize it without being able to see for himself, but he’s treading on dangerous ground. Dean looks like he’s one wrong word away from breaking something.
With his hands on Dean’s waist, working under his jacket to pull him closer still even as he breaks their kiss, Castiel does what he hadn’t been brave enough to do in Rexford. He tells Dean the truth.
“Have you had much trouble here?” Castiel asks, dipping his head in gratitude as Bartłomiej trades the bowl of dirty water for a mug of hot tea.
The motel Castiel chooses for them in DC is nicer than the places the Winchesters usually stay.
“Don’t strain yourself.”
Because he can’t shake the all-encompassing fear that, at best, they’re in a choose your own adventure. One of those
Castiel huffs under his breath and shoves his hands deeper into the pockets of his coat. He jumps when Dean’s elbow digs into his side.
As you can probably tell from the wordcount, this chapter got away from me. I'll tell you why in the end notes, but as a hint: note the rating change.
“I won’t do it unless I know you want me to,” Castiel tells him, which is admittedly a half truth—he already knows that Dean wants him to, after all. He just wants to hear him say it, and he’s already beginning to find that there’s something unexpectedly thrilling about this dynamic Dean had ached for.
In his head, Dean sings
he sings in his head, his chest trembling.
“Later.”
This is definitely an all hurt, no comfort chapter. Tread lightly. Warnings in the end notes if you need them!
“I thought…”
“Thank you, Dean.”
He’s got no ideas, so he doesn’t move. Couldn’t move if he tried.
“Anything. Unless it’s embarrassing, and then you’ll have to buy me a drink first.”
Castiel doesn’t get a chance to answer, because between one moment and the next, Dean’s mouth is sealed over him, tongue teasing lightly at the sensitive skin of the glans. The heat of his mouth is almost unbearably good. Castiel can’t keep still as Dean sinks lower, the ridges of the roof of his mouth dragging over him. He grips Dean’s hair tighter, and shifts his hips in helpless movements that he couldn’t control if his life depended on it. Dean makes a pleased sound that vibrates through his skin.
In the passenger seat, Dean clenches his fists against his thighs and ignores the now-familiar shooting pain that runs through his wrist with the motion. It aches with the cold.
When he tries to remember why he’s actually here, it’s harder. Despite his effort to recall details about the djinn, the desert, his slow trek to Syria, he finds himself struggling to dredge up much more than the vague shape of each memory.
“He’s right.”
Before they leave, he takes the pen that Dean had been using to add his own message to the bottom of the page.
Now, Castiel realizes that he may have been slightly biased in that assessment, but he doesn’t particularly care.
He wants to break something, or scream, or throw up, but at the same time—he can’t. He just feels hollowed out and foolish, and overwhelmingly like he should have realized that this was coming. It never made sense that Cas should choose them—choose him—over Heaven, and now it’s crystal clear that he didn’t. He was being coerced the whole time.
Soon was cut off before it could arrive, blocked by crisis after crisis after crisis, and Dean had put it on the back-burner, replaced
“What exactly would you do to prove you’re an angel, anyway? I know you don’t like using the mind whammy on people, but I don’t think letting me stab you to prove you’re not human is going to go over too well this time.”
Things might not be amazing yet, but Dean can’t imagine having to up and leave town because of who he is.
They have time to figure it out.
. Surely his face has been on the news by now. Surely someone is looking for them.
, he’d thought. He’d made his peace with it. Being near Dean was enough, if being with Dean was not an option.
“You wanna find us a diner near a copy place while you’re waiting?”
“You’re sure?” Bobby asks after a long pause, and whatever the reply is, it makes his hand shake as he reaches for a pen and scrawls something down on the back of the nearest invoice. Castiel feels his heart in his throat. If something has happened to Ellen, or Jo, or Sam— but Ellen is next door in the house, and Sam and Jo had called Bobby less than an hour ago, so— “Yeah. Yeah, of course. And you’re absolutely sure it’s him?”
“Just—c’mon. Please,” Dean all but growls, and Cas squeezes his thighs, fingers digging in as he draws out of Dean slow.
“Call me if you need anything, okay?”
“Yeah.”
, Dean. There’s nothing you’re incapable of. Hold on for me.”
“Don’t use my name as a verb.”
designed, too?
She narrows her eyes, but does as he says. As soon as she notices the faded handwriting, her mouth falls open.
. What-- how did you-- I was holding this the entire time.”
“Not nearly often enough, no.”
Charlie squints.
He irons out the creases and hangs each piece in a Needle and Thread garment bag, ready to go, before tidying the space and flipping the sign on the door to closed.
While he sets the record onto the turntable, Charlie reaches under the chair and pulls out a photograph, dusting it off. Her eyes light up.
is scrawled across it in black marker. Fitting, he thinks, and slots it into the tape deck.
Cas is gone, and Dean’s entire frame of existence is focused on that one awful, inescapable fact.
In his mind, it’s Cas that he calls. He’s only ever known two phone numbers by heart—his own, and the Novak house—and only one of those is still functioning.
“Yeah, well whoever convinced you to, uh… they, um…” Dean trails off as his search for a snappy comeback sends him stumbling into the metaphorical woods. “Shut up.”
--to Henry, he’s cut back to only one a day. Even then, he’s been butting it out when it’s only halfway done.
Dean lifts his brow, fixing Cas with a crooked grin that probably looks a lot more confident than he feels right now.
“So, you’re… like,” Dean pauses to chew on the inside of his cheek. “Are you, uh… into him? Or dating him, or whatever?”
“Of course it did.”
“I wanted to tell him,“ Dean cuts him off. “But he just…”
“I can’t accept this.”
“No idea. Can’t find any record of him getting married or having kids in any state. There was an engagement notice from before he shipped out, and one of the other files I sent is a letter he wrote to the woman he was engaged to, but the letter, uh… well I don’t think they were still planning to get married.”
It’s showing footage of something called the International Space Station, and watching it makes Castiel feel like the whole world has tilted on it’s axis. The bathroom door still squeaks, he thinks when he hears Dean coming back. At least something is the same.
Jack is dead. Mom is dead. Belphegor clears his throat, impatient, and Dean wants to be sick. There’s no time.
While most of the evidence doesn’t offer much more detail than what she relayed to them over the phone, the CCTV footage pulled from a parking lot in Arlington is another story.
“‘Kay,” he says, turning to head back toward the path without waiting for Castiel to say anything else. It makes Castiel inordinately nervous.
Dean leans down and kisses him, using his grip in his hair to tilt Castiel’s head back. His tongue dips into Castiel’s mouth, a slow tease, before he deepens the kiss. Sucks Castiel’s lower lip between his own and bites down, just a little, until Castiel lets out a low, pleased hum.
Castiel trails off with a shrug. It’s still difficult to think of Hael--she had been a shy, creative girl right up until the end, when her moods suddenly began to swing from one extreme to the other, and all her interest in art and photography had fallen to the wayside. Castiel still has her camera and her car, both of which she hastily gave to him when she became aware of how dire her diagnosis was.
“That was the key,” Castiel says.
Dean smirks, eyes glinting with amusement, before he seems to have some idea that has him biting down on the inside of his cheek and looking Castiel up and down. Castiel knows that look by now. He’s seen it several times since yesterday. He narrows his eyes.
—or any of the others, really—look like the result of a damned chemical leak, but moving them to an uncompromised location is probably a good start. He nods to himself. “Right. When are we heading out?”
To save himself from choosing, he pulls up the box closest to him, and sits down on the floor to dig through it, sorting the contents into trash and donations, with one significantly smaller pile he’s calling finders keepers.
exactly,” he says. “But I have liked to imagine all the different ways I might be able to please you, if I ever had the chance.” He shifts to bite softly at Dean’s hip; soothes over the skin with his tongue. Dean’s whole body is taut with tension. “All the ways you might please me. Would you like me to tell you about them?”
,” he says with a knowing smile. “The socks are metaphorical.”
As he sees it, though, he’s just survived falling from the sky: it would be a waste of his good fortune if he were to go and break his neck leaping from the tree that caught him.
“You can’t drive, Dean.”
•	I’m going mad!!!
“You’re biased.”
Dean nods, because he’s right. He does. He blames himself, too, but that’s not something he can look at directly. Not yet. Maybe not ever. He thinks Cas knows that, but he can’t bring himself to ask. Can’t seem to say anything to him that isn’t intended to hurt.
“Look at the record,” he tells her as he flops down beside her, and she wrinkles her nose.
“Your eating habits, for one. You chew with your mouth open. And I could do without seeing you spit bad coffee back into the cup ever again.”
Dean huffs.
Hands twisting in his pockets, Dean plasters on a smile that Castiel doesn’t buy for a second and tilts his head in the direction of his house.
Sometimes, it was something external; an interruption just as he was gearing up to speak. More often than not, though, it was… something else. A pressure in the throat. A feeling that it wasn’t right, even while he felt otherwise certain that it was.
It was less than that, Castiel knows. He did the precise calculation himself, not long after he’d arrived in Boulder. The bar where he worked downtown was three hundred and seventy nine miles from the bunker, but the room he’d rented for the first few months was two miles closer still.
“Hmm?”
When she finally pulls into the lone vacant accessible space outside the police station, none of them move a muscle.
“I didn’t think you’d miss me at all.”
“No.”
Swallowing around the lump in his throat, Castiel tries for a comforting smile, and does the most selfish thing he’s ever done in his life.
Close to one in the morning, he spots Dean sitting on a log by the remains of a fire at the center of camp, picking idly at the bag of Skittles he’d packed for the trip and referred to as “trail mix” to irritate his brother. Sam is nowhere to be seen now. Dean appears to be doing little more than quietly passing the time.
Overhead, the bare bulb that hangs from the ceiling reflects yellow light off the windowpane, obscuring Dean’s view just enough to make him nervous. Despite the little voice in his head that sounds a lot like John, telling him to
“You with me?”
Dean grins at him, then his smile falters.
Castiel can barely breathe for the way it crushes him. To be loved and wanted and needed but simultaneously wished away.
Closer still, he sees more signs of the neglect and malnourishment he’s survived. Torn, brittle fingernails. Dry lips. Patches of rough skin around his temples and his nose. It all fills Castiel with a directionless rage that he has no outlet for.
“I suppose?”
Dean releases him before he can figure it out, teasing his fingertips back and forth a couple more times as he leans in for another kiss, and Castiel clings to him through it. He’s vaguely aware of lifting his hips again as Dean tugs his underwear down, and then Dean’s rough palm is wrapped around him, stroking, his thumb gliding over the wet head, dragging down to smooth over—
But they’d stopped in the park, and he’d
Words won’t come. Castiel is fairly certain that his heart is in his throat.
Time gets harder to track after that.
Castiel misses their close physical contact almost immediately, and Dean must feel the same, because his hand shifts back to briefly squeeze Castiel’s wrist before letting go to thumb at the screen.
he thinks.
“Dean.”
With a shuddering breath, Parker nods and continues.
He sounds desperate, and Castiel feels the same.
(When he thinks about what he really wants for
He lifts his hand, almost touching but stopping just shy, and Castiel can’t help but wonder if he’s reliving the previous evening. If he’s seeing beyond the raised red flesh around the still-broken skin of the lance’s point of entry, his mind’s eye supplying vivid memory of the toxic black bile that had bled sluggishly from him last night.
“Are you alright?” he asks.
“I’m pretty sure I saw full crew records in the stuff Eileen dug up last time,” Sam says. “Should be easy enough. I’m not sure if we’ll get a chance to check for the next couple of days, though. There’s this big exhibit coming in tomorrow, so Eileen’s gonna be swamped.”
“Mm, except we’ll be passing through Danville by like eight, and I’m definitely gonna want to stop by
“Yes.”
Not that long ago, Cas had come to Dean’s room to tell him, grinning, that Jack had just asked Sam if he grew his hair long as a “fashion statement”, or if it was just because he liked it that way.
“You’re stunning all the time, actually.”
“Yeah, you’ve got your work cut out for you there,” he says, then turns serious. “And I— listen, I meant it when I said I’m okay with you staying. I’ve missed you, too. But Dean… look, he’ll be pissed I told you, but when the angels fell and you went missing? He was a mess, Cas. That first month, he barely slept. Barely ate. I couldn’t get him to work a case if his life depended on it. And even when I did finally get him out of the bunker… it took months for him to start acting like himself again. He was
“Present events suggest otherwise,” he just barely manages to say as Dean runs his palms back up his shins and over his thighs. His hips twitch forward of their own volition. “You seem to like me quite a lot.”
Dean had said back then, though he didn’t believe a word, and John had seen the lie for what it was. He’d cut more symbols into Dean’s skin.
“Yeah, well you’ve got a funny way of showing it.”
“No?”
“If I could ever manage to convince you so wholly of your worth, I’d consider it a success.”
under his skin.
Swallowing, he nods, pushing himself up and away, pressing his eyes shut to block out reality for just a moment, just to hold on to the dream for a little while longer. It was imperfect, but
He’d thought about it in sharp detail. Imagined confessing to Dean, telling him how the first thing he’d felt when the angels stopped falling was the overwhelming desire to hear Dean’s voice. To see him. To hold him. To breathe him in.
Staring out at Dean on the front step of Hannah’s house, it occurs to Castiel that this is the first time they’ve been apart for an equal amount of time. One month.
“Don’t worry, Mom. I’ve got an eye on him,” Dean says, directing a sly wink toward Castiel. Castiel shakes his head.
As it was, he’d felt himself sinking into a depression. With no family left to speak of--his most recent argument with his uncle Marv had been a big one--and nobody who knew him as more than a passing acquaintance, he’d lacked even the most basic human contact for months. Before Dean, he couldn’t remember the last time someone had hugged him.
“Yeah?” he asks, and Cas nods, feverish as Dean dips his fingers under his belt.
“But you don’t
“Djinn,” he says to himself, and turns in place to inspect the ruins around him, searching for any sign of movement among the slabs of broken sandstone and cement. They’re here, he realizes. They’ve been here for a long time. The undercurrent of the energy he tracked here suddenly makes sense. That strange bitterness that he could not place was their power, woven into the tree and the rubble that surrounds it.
He could do it. He could open the door. Cross the street. Go into the truck stop. Call for help. Eat something. Breathe.
“I checked Sam’s shoulder again,” Cas says without preamble, Dean lifts his eyes from where they were fixed on his hands.
“Deputy Hayley Kim,” she says, sticking out her hand for Jules and Paul to shake. “You the EPA agents?”
Dean doesn’t respond to the question directly; just looks at Castiel with a determination in his eyes that leaves no room for misunderstanding, and says, “I’m going to bed. You should come with me.”
“Don’t,” Dean says, eyes bright with mirth. “Just—whatever innuendo you were about to attempt, just. Don’t.”
“Maybe what?”
“First things first,” Dean says, rubbing at his stinging eyes with both hands. “We’ve gotta come up with something new to tell people. Deputy Kim is getting suspicious, and I don’t think the Sheriff’s wife is really buying that he’s just too busy to pick up the phone.”
“Here goes, I guess,” Dean says, and together they head inside.
Leaning heavily back against the door behind him, Cas pulls at the buttons of Dean’s overshirt, slipping them loose, one by one. Dean glances down to watch his long fingers at work. He wants Cas to put those fingers in his mouth, to press them against his tongue, to drag them down his chest, and—
“Have you been in to see him yet?” Mr Wyatt asks.
Sam telling Castiel to get out. Sam telling Dean he’s delusional, that Castiel isn’t even human, that what they’re doing is reckless and foolish and pointless. Sam telling them both that they’re making a mistake.
When Dean’s alarm blares at eight o’clock, his eyelids feel like sandpaper. It’s tempting to call Charlie and ask her to reschedule, but the costumes she’s coming to organize will likely keep him busy for the next week, and as soon as he’s done with those he’s got three different bridal parties scheduled to come in.
Leaning over to turn up the volume on a Soundgarden song he knows Dean likes, he glances over at his best friend and wonders if there’s anything better than this. Just the two of them on the open road.
“Sorry. I really didn’t think it’d take so long, and then I, uh… I waited until Sam went to bed,” Dean says. He actually looks a little ashamed to admit it. “Kinda felt like a teenage girl sneaking out to meet the hot quarterback.”
The record slip cover, the old turntable he’d had in his room, the rough edge of the half-price sale sticker that he could never quite peel free. The cassette deck he’d sat before for hours as he—
“Whether you’re real or not.”
—John still isn’t here, and he’s got nothing to protect himself, and he’s so thirsty that he can’t see straight. He can’t think, he can’t think.
Many thanks to Maria and her nature knowledge for checking this over (and for being an excellent cheerleader, as always)
Because I might as well plug a couple of fandom things while I have your attention:
Castiel is already on his feet.
As soon as they get back to the apartment, Dean finds himself in exactly the same position he’d suggested the bar as an escape from. He can’t bring himself to complain.
Dean shakes his head again and mutters under his breath, so quiet that Castiel doesn’t think he was supposed to hear.
“We should make an effort to see them on our way out, then,” Castiel says, then—knowing Dean will be more likely to agree if he doesn’t think he’s getting some kind of special treatment—adds; “I’d also like to see the lemurs, if we have time. They’re very resourceful creatures.”
“Too much?”
“Your photoshop skills have improved,” she says.
“Nah, it’s fine.”
Castiel squeezes him again, and Dean laughs, his bare stomach jumping under Castiel’s hands.
“Fuck off,” he says aloud, just in case Chuck can hear him, and tears the paper down.
Dean knows more about John’s demons now than he did back when this started. He knows how the acrid filth of them mingles with condensation and cloud, thunder drowning out the sound of them shifting under human skin, lightning making everything buzz with the same energy that they carry, letting them hide in plain sight. He knows how their faces shift beyond the skin of the people they possess. How their black eyes watch every movement. How their rotting flesh hangs, out of sight beyond a veil that only John can perceive the presence of.
“This clueless angel act is gonna backfire on you one day, Cas.”
,” Agata says, pressing her hand over Castiel’s heart, and looks to her husband for help with the corresponding word in English.
Dean hums, almost transfixed as he touches Castiel’s stomach, and only shifts away from the scar to touch the tattoo on his ribs.
The toilet flushes, and the tap runs, and then Dean opens the bathroom door, still drying his hands on a white towel as he leans against the frame.
His eyes prickle even as he says it, and he looks away from Dean toward the park’s edge, where a few unfamiliar kids from another school are jumping their bikes over a gutter and laughing loud. He envies their uncomplicated happiness, and hates them for it. He hates himself even more.
“I’ll make it up to you tomorrow,” Dean tells him, sitting down beside him and warming his hands over the fire. “Found a good spot about ten minutes away, though—there’s a pretty big drop off about eight feet out, plus there’s plenty of cover, and I saw a couple of birds circling overhead before it got too dark, so there’s definitely
Castiel snorts, leaning back out into the hallway to find Sam poking his head out of his own bedroom, his floppy hair hanging in front of his grinning face.
Resting his hand on the tree’s gnarled trunk, he closes his eyes and pushes his grace below the surface. It weaves through the porous bark, down through the charred surface and into the fibers of the wood, slipping down between the grains before it bounces back to him, setting off something like a static shock under his skin, tainted with something blue and sharp, metallic and cool, like cloud and stone entwined.
It takes a full week for Castiel to reach Syria.
“Oh,” Castiel’s grin is sheepish. “I thought you were pointing out their mother.”
“Yeah.”
Pulling back, Castiel heaves out a breath and nods, gesturing toward the kitchen.
If the waitress notices him stumble over what to call Dean, she doesn’t acknowledge it, and merely gives him a smile and nod as she heads toward her station.
“The plan changed, Dean. Something went wrong. You know this. Something always goes wrong.”
Dean swallows, hard, and sucks his lower lip into his mouth. Bites down on it as he lets out a long, shaky breath.
“Try to get some sleep, okay? I’ll be back tomorrow,” he promises, and squeezes Dean’s good hand when he reaches out. He gets the distinct feeling that Dean’s trying for the closest thing they can manage to a hug right now.
“You were thinking very pointedly in my direction, and I suspect that our physical connection made the prayer stronger.”
“What?”
“Dean? Cas?”
“If you’re so sure I’m going to hate this movie, why’d you even ask me come?”
Thanks as always to Maria (aeli_kindara) for allowing me to upset her with these words first. Any mistakes are my own :)
“No, not really.”
“Well, um... maybe we could make that a resolution. You know what a New Year’s Resolution is?”
Castiel gulps. He can’t believe that only an hour ago, he’d been worried that Dean might be too embarrassed to touch him. Now that the dam has broken, he wonders if he’ll be able to keep up.
Worse still, that something has happened to Dean.
“I’ll give you that,” he says, and shuffles a little closer, resting one hand on Castiel’s leg for balance. “Still didn’t plan on bein’ on my knees today.” He squeezes Castiel’s thigh and bites the inside of his cheek, eyes flashing in the low light as he meets Castiel’s gaze. “Or maybe I did.”
Though he’s worked hard at ignoring the truth of his feelings and the knowledge of what they mean for far longer than he cares to think of, he can’t do that anymore. Not now. Not with the words out in the open like this.
“It’s just…” Dean chews on the inside of his cheek, careful as he considers his words. He doesn’t want to encourage John’s paranoia, but if it’s the only way to keep them from freezing to death, it’s a concession he’ll have to make. “It’ll be harder to protect ourselves from… from
Shaking his head, Dean sets about digging through the zoo security system’s saved files for the videos he needs to copy. The fingernails of his free hand drum an uneven beat across the tabletop.
“You don’t know that.”
“Aye,” Rowena says, eyes narrowing. “But what does that—”
The room lurches. The bed drops an inch.
Cas waits, and Dean chews on the inside of his cheek for a moment before he explains.

“I remember it all,” Dean tells him. “The blood. The—
“That’s what Agata said. Completing the circle would complete the blessing. That must be why you were sent here. The jacket is trying to return to me.”
His mind is a tangled mess of need; his chest cracking open with a longing so deep that he’s dizzy with the desire for Cas to just take what he wants. He
“For real?”
“I missed you, too.”
Castiel’s brows lift in surprise.
Dean laughs.
“Cas, are you
“Yeah, I’ll be good. And yeah, I want you to.”
Then again, maybe not.
and it doesn’t explain Dean’s sinking mood since they left the movie theater.
Flipping it back around, he finds a name printed onto the left breast above the pocket, and around it is an unfinished circle of deep red embroidery cotton, thick stitches curving two thirds of the way around.
Saying so takes a lot out of him. Castiel can feel it in the way his soul hums and reaches out, so close to the surface that he can almost see it. His own soul, still there from his time as a human, reaches back.
“Prove it,” he says.
of Sam’s bedroom door clicking sharply shut.
“I’m putting you both on notice,” Dean says, but his hand still settles comfortably on Castiel’s lower back as they make their way across the parking lot, so Castiel isn’t particularly concerned.
It’s a tight squeeze—all the lions are up toward one side of the enclosure, and they’re only really visible from that corner. Dean steps aside, making space for a little girl to hop up onto the ledge where he’d been standing.
“I want to.”
As he drinks the tea slowly, watching Agata repair the hole in his jacket, Bartłomiej tells him how the main village of Sieraków to the north was attacked, and how their home and the few around it were targeted shortly after. He describes the days before Warsaw was captured. How the Axis forces had made their way through the forests nearby.
Something in the way the light glints off the branches reminds him of a place he’d visited years ago. A lake with a pier in a snow-dusted valley in Oregon, quiet and secluded under the light of a crescent moon. He’d thought at the time that it was a place that Dean would like, and wondered if he’d ever have occasion to show it to him. He hadn’t realized why he’d wanted to, at the time.
“Okay,” he says through a yawn, lips brushing Castiel’s chest as he presses close. “Tomorrow, though. Gonna make up for it. Probably twice.”
And they can’t even do that, he realizes—not even the Sheriff’s office would have that many sets of handcuffs in storage.
Crouching in front of him, Sam is wild-eyed but trying to hold himself together, and it sets off the part of Dean that is hard-wired to make sure his brother is safe. Forces him to center himself. Focus.
“Agata,” Castiel says immediately. “I don’t know her last name, but she lived in a Polish village called Sieraków during the war. Her husband was named Bartłomiej. They’d... I don’t know if they’d still be alive. But they had a daughter named Hannah.”
When Sam finally starts the car up again and eases them back out onto the road, Castiel closes his eyes and swallows down the hurt, dislodging the lump in his throat enough to speak.
“Okay,” Dean tells him, following when Castiel pulls him further into the room. “Whatever you want, Cas.”
Dean’s face falls.
“Jury’s still out, hey?” he asks, and Castiel shrugs a little. Dean grins. “Yeah, same here, man. I’m still not convinced I haven’t discovered some new facet of PTSD that the meds don’t help with.”
“You’d be able to get into MIT, too, you know,” Castiel tells him. “If you wanted.”
Objectively, Castiel thinks that this is an absurd thing for him to say. Dean has earned a million kisses, a hundred million,
“There’s no moving on from this,” he says.
A hundred and sixty three days have passed for him. That’s not
Pursing his lips, Sam passes them over, grimacing at a twinge in his shoulder from the slight movement. Dean looks at him pointedly.
“Did you— I mean, do you— are you, like. In love with him?”
He ends the call soon after, and returns to the attic. The jacket is sitting where he left it, and on the floor nearby is the petal he’d peeled from his boot. As absurd as it seems, he’s sure that the jacket had something to do with it. He remembers slipping it on before the mirror suddenly shifted, and how it was only when he took it off that the man he’s trying not to think of as Castiel disappeared, along with his apartment.
Ellen bursts out with a near hysterical laugh. Bobby reaches over and grips her hand in his own, squeezing it while she nods, steadying herself.
A sign advertising a cook-off in Crowell, evidently the “Wild Hog Capital of the World”, and an abandoned brick elementary schoolhouse in Close City. A white brick church somewhere south of Tahoka. A convoy of silver Airstream campers parked along the side of the road near Carlsbad, New Mexico, when they snake over the border. More overgrown stretches of vacant land scattered with rusted farm machinery and beat-up cars than he can count.
“Thanks,” Parker says, wrinkling his nose. “I just hope it’s gone before my wife gets back from Dallas.” His eyes widen. “Oh
“I don’t want to think about it,” he admits, and Dean looks at him in confusion.
At that, Castiel lets his smile break free, and Dean shakes his head with an embarrassed laugh. It’s absurd that he’s so self-conscious about the mere suggestion of what Castiel knows he wants to do. Dean’s always painted himself as more of a lotus-eater than a shrinking violet, and even knowing how little truth there was to his self-styled image of an uninhibited libertine, Castiel never expected him to be
The door wrenches open before he can get any further, and it’s enough to make his heart stop. His skin prickles. He tastes acid.
“Nineteen seventy-nine,” Dean says, and chews on his lip before he adds. “The year I was born, actually.”
For now, he leaves the thread alone and looks for any other distinguishing marks. Besides a faint stain in the lining that looks to be blood and a small tear in the right cuff, it’s in almost perfect condition. There’s a row of what looks like seventeen flies drawn around the inside collar, and a single tiny puncture hole in the front, and Dean sets the jacket aside to dig through the trunk in the hope that whatever pin had been there might simply have fallen off.
“You’re--”
He smiles now, remembering the moment.
“Whoa,
Not even twenty-four hours have passed since they first kissed outside the bunker, but as Dean’s mouth moves against his own, Castiel feels as though he’s been missing this forever. As though kissing Dean is something he’s been trying to find his way back to since before he knew his own name, blinking into awareness in the bright, holy light that made him.
“Dean?” Castiel says, ducking his head to try and catch his panicked gaze. “Hey, it’s okay—you’re safe now, remember?”
“So it would seem,” Castiel agrees, casting a bemused look over at Dean. “I’m glad to meet you, Charlie. Dean’s told me a little about you.”
“You do know that wasn’t a sentence, right?”
“Pretty sure it’s a letter from Cas.”
Backing off, Sam gives Dean some room, and sits on the edge of the table beside Jack. It doesn’t help much, but it’s something. Having a few feet of space. He can’t bear to see their faces while he tells them what he has to tell them. In all honesty, he can’t bear for them to see his right now either, but at this point that ship has sailed.
Between one second and the next, they’re both underwater, splashing and kicking their way back to the surface. Castiel can barely breathe he’s laughing so hard.
. Slowly, the tremors in his chest subside.
Forgive my unsteady hand in this note, but I just met a creature so striking that I scarcely believed he existed outside the cinema screen until he addressed me by name. I never thought myself capable of swooning--and yet!
“I’ll be in my room,” he says.
“You’re as bad as Ellen. I have
He sits down in the hallway, back pressed to the door to mirror how Dean must be seated on the other side. He imagines that he can feel Dean’s body heat through two inches of oak, and soaks it in greedily.
“That was the plan,” Dean says, and waves his hand toward the bag in invitation when Castiel hesitates to look through it. “But you said you missed good food, so...”
Dean slams the trunk.
Now, he wonders now how many times he’s unwittingly let Chuck force his hand because the stakes hadn’t seemed all that high, because he hadn’t recognized that the compulsion, the anger, the righteousness was coming from someplace outside of himself.
, he’d said as he’d keyed it in, giving Cas a wink.
“On a weekend.”
Dean feels like his own voice is locked somewhere in his throat, so he nods in lieu of attempting to reply. John doesn’t seem to notice.
Dean’s hand drifts down to settle between Castiel’s legs almost as soon as he’s lying down, and his touch is slow and soft and perfect. It takes an incredible level of self-restraint for Castiel to catch his wrist and pull away. Kissing Dean again is the compromise he allows himself.
you, Dean. Completely. There is nothing that you could ask of me that would be a burden.”
Castiel rolls his eyes, his memories flicking seamlessly back to the hunt in Nevada, all thought of the djinn in Syria, of the mission to find the fruit, of the unreality of this entire situation--gone. He pushes lightly at Dean’s chest.
A dozen or so chairs are stacked along the walls, and the faint scent of instant coffee lingers in the air. Ahead, Dean maneuvers through a tight gap between tables toward a dark red door. When they make their way inside, it’s to find a cramped storeroom, where a thin bedroll and blanket has been set out for Dean on the floor alongside several unlabelled boxes and a shelf of cleaning supplies. His backpack sits at one end like a makeshift pillow.
For a long moment, Castiel considers him. He can’t deny that it hurts to learn that Sam has so little faith in the two of them, but he does appreciate the fact that he cares so much.
“Humor me, Sam. Please.”
He’s been lying to himself for over a year already, and he’s exhausted from it.
“Aren’t your toes freezing?” he asks.
“It?”
“I have been. Crowley left today, though, so I’m just…”
Castiel nods on an exhale, and Dean bridges the distance between them to pull him close, pressing his lips to the skin below Castiel’s ear.
“How? It can’t visit Earth unless it’s summoned.”
Dean stands with his nose half an inch from the glass to watch them, letting out a startled but amused gasp when a lanky cub tumbles off of the log she’d been napping on and immediately starts swatting at the sleep-twitching tail of her sister.
Dean swallows hard and fights off the need to clear his throat.
A gust of wind outside sends leaves and stones scattering, rattling against the side of the building, and he whips his attention back to the building storm.
“Mm.”
He trails off, shaking his head and looking out the window.
. No way.”
Remarkably, Dean cracks another smile. It’s shaky, watery, weak, but
“We’re nearly there,” he says, but he still hasn’t told Dean where “there” is.
“Give me your hand.”
“The Empty was here?”
Telling his dad about his plan was the only remaining hurdle. But before he could, near the end of Dean’s senior year, John’s heart gave out. Fresh out of school, Dean found himself signing up for the military in a misguided attempt at making his dead father proud.
Jack is staring at them from across the room, hands tense on the back of the chair in the middle of the Devil’s trap, and Dean can’t meet his eyes. Can’t let himself see him crying. He just heads for the door, walking as fast as his body will let him, desperate to get out, to catch his breath, to
“I don’t consider it wasteful.”
The continuous
“Like when?”
As soon as Dean’s grip loosens, Parker scrambles free and lurches for the door. He makes it about three paces before Dean catches hold of him again.
Washington state,” Dean says slowly. “You’re-- dude. Cas. That’s like an hour away from the bunker.”
“Hey!” Dean shouts after him when he pops back out of the water, and Castiel swims faster.
Castiel feels the corner of his mouth tick up.
Dean prays again,
“What’ll it be?”
“He knows where I am. But we’re no longer together.”
“Technically, they cut me out. My parents, too. The only family I still have any contact with is my uncle, Marv, and that’s only because he’s a relentless gossip who likes to interfere. He comes by occasionally, always unannounced, and is near impossible to get rid of until he’s managed to eke out some new piece of information to take back to my father.”
Even still, he’s artless about it sometimes.
“Your brother sent me,” Belphegor says, finally, sounding more put-upon than he has any business being. “A few of those hunters you called turned up. He’s going with them to start clearing out the bodies.”
Dean huffs.
Dean laughs, the muscles of his back jumping under Castiel’s palm, but he doesn’t argue. Just curls up under the covers that Castiel pulls back over them both.
Frowning, Castiel takes his eyes off the road for a second to look at him.
Dean wants to ask.
“It’s perfect.”
Charlie is just settling down onto the couch when Dean walks into the living room, and she looks up at him with a raised brow. It’s only been a few seconds for her. The thought is absurd, but in light of everything else, Dean’s not wasting too much time being thrown by it.
Despite the sudden ambush, there’s little Castiel can do but keep going. He grips the yoke tightly as his men scramble to locate the source of the rocket, and Andy manages to fire in the right direction twice before Angel Eyes is hit square in the nose by a cannon shell.
When Jack comes in for a tight hug, Castiel puts down his heavy duffel bag to return it.
Dean snorts.
There’s always been something in the way. An apocalypse, a near death, an actual death. Something. When he came back from the Empty, miraculously alive again against all odds, he’d thought to himself, it’s now or never, and Dean had barreled into him, fingers pressed to the back of his neck as they’d embraced in a dimly lit alleyway, and Castiel had felt love radiating from him like light from a star, and still nothing had changed.
John is outside, walking away from the car in a straight line. His careful, measured paces are at odds with the way he’s muttering to himself again, and he’s gripping a hunting knife at his side. It glints in the patchy moonlight.
“Sammy’d say the same thing,” he adds. “I just, uh. It’s been a while, is all.”
Dean just waves his hand.
As he pulls Dean close, kissing him soundly on the front step, Castiel’s heart pounds hard as he thinks to himself;
“I hardly even touched you and you flinched."
When he eventually makes his way back down to the landing, there’s a distinct boot print in the water that spilled from the vase that had been sitting on his side table. He wriggles his own bare toes against the floor runner and takes several deep breaths.
Parker doesn't look any less terrified.
He’s still not really sure what stopped him the last time, or the time before, or the dozen times before that.
Castiel would gladly kiss him until neither of them could remember their own names. But tonight, he wants to give Dean everything he wants, everything he needs, and his prayer had been clear.
Back before the surgery, John had been sick, and he’d been tired, and he’d been sad, but he’d still been
His fingers close around the strap of the duffel. Determination, then.
shit. Not exactly in my wheelhouse.”
“What do you mean?” he asks, hoping he’s misunderstood, and sees Dean shrinking in on himself in response.
“How?” he asks.
It only takes him a couple of minutes to find everything, but he takes his time anyway, hoping that Castiel will find a way to bring up the reason for their visit before he heads back into the living room. When he finally carries out a tray with the teapot and some cups, he finds Castiel crouched on the floor beside her chair, her hand gripping his tightly.
It had taken more than a little subterfuge, and several strategically placed phone calls to Dean’s house when he knew he was busy at his guitar lesson, but all of that had been a cakewalk compared to the agony of keeping his newly-acquired unrestricted driver’s license a secret for the past week and a half. He almost gave in on day one, but his impulse to drive directly to Dean’s house from the DMV had, thankfully, been thwarted by a well-timed flat tire.
, and the Mustang Castiel had been tailing is knocked clean out of the sky in a burst of flame.
“I used to come out here a lot as a child,” he says, and Dean opens his eyes to look over at him. “I grew up in Decatur, just west of the lake. My… I think my parents are still there.”
They deserve to take small indulgences from time to time, and now that it’s occurred to him, Castiel is determined to make them do so in any way he can—up to and including the quality of the mattress he’ll be sharing with Dean as they travel across the country on the hunt for Kelly Kline.
. It’s ridiculous that anyone should wear so many layers, and he tells Dean as much as he watches him stagger loose-limbed from the bed to pull his socks off.
Dean’s muffled voice leeches out through the narrow gap around the hinges. Castiel freezes in place like a thief in a pantomime.
“I think so, yes,” Hannah says. “I can show you how. You can do it whenever you like.”
Above him, the tree’s trunk is still blackened with soot, but new growth has burst forth at an alarming rate. It’s covered in glossy green leaves, and there isn’t a single branch without a round, purple fruit weighing it down toward the Earth.
Dean looks back at him in disbelief.
“Were you serious about teaching me to perform vehicle maintenance?” he asks Dean when he returns from the restroom a few minutes later.
“A blessing, to find
Castiel nods, unbuckling his seatbelt--such a clever invention, and one he’s surprised wasn’t thought of sooner--and climbing from the car. He can feel Dean hovering, his hand just shy of touching the small of Castiel’s back as they make their way toward the building. He finds himself wishing Dean would close the distance.
Of course, he knows that more often than not, it comes down to money. His own brief time as a human taught him just how far every dollar needs to stretch when you don’t have a lot to spare, and even the seemingly limitless bank account full of stolen funds that Charlie had set up for the brothers before she died can’t be relied upon to last forever.
Sam stops and looks at him in confusion.
“What? Say it.”
Dean keeps glancing toward the sound.
Still, Dean’s brow raises further.
“Stop giving me reasons to.”
They end the call shortly after that, and though Dean is exhausted, he can’t relax. He wanders around the apartment, snacking out of agitated boredom, until the sight of every room starts to drive him mad. It’s already getting late, but he can tell that sleep is a long way off.
“Be sure of what?”
, he thinks, and curls his fist around Cas’ tie to hold him in place. God, he wants there to be a next time.
It was a desperate addition, but he knows that it was fruitless in the end. Dean knew his meaning the moment he’d spoken, and the plural of the second phrase only highlighted the singular of the first.
Looking up, he sees Dean approaching, shaking his head at his phone before he slips it back into his pocket.
“Yeah?”
“Is Sam here?” Ballard asks.
Dean picks it up. Turns it over in his hand and runs a thumb over the tiny ribs of the ancient fish. Wonders where Cas found it. If he’d touched it this same way. If there was a story behind it, something Cas had wanted to share but never had the chance.
They both fall silent as they wait for the computer to do whatever it is that it’s doing, and Castiel finds himself people-watching to pass the time. The picnicking families on the nearby patch of grass; the shrieking children running circles around them in some seemingly lawless game of chase; the teenagers lazing under a nearby tree and awkwardly flirting with one another.
Dean stretches after he ends the call, tilting his head from side to side until his muscles loosen and his joints pop. He groans at the sensation.
“Lupin just taught Harry how to cast a Patronus,” Jack says.
Henriksen offers a tired smile.
Taking a seat at the table, Cas looks at Claire’s message again. He flicks through the others, too. Looks at one from Sam telling him to call Dean after Mary left; one from Dean asking him if he’s still playing good-cop bad-cop with “the king of the douchebags.”
When he knocks on the door, flakes of blue paint cling to his knuckles.
Castiel steps outside and pulls him close. He’s warm and solid and perfect in Castiel’s arms, and his heart aches with how much he’s missed him.
“He’s a doctor,” Donna says, and there’s the sound of shuffling paper, and a loud slurp as she takes a sip of something on the other end of the line. “Uh… Dr Parker Thompson. She wanted to know if he could run some tests on her baby without it going on any official records.”
Dean is already nearing the dilapidated mess hall he’s been set up in for the night—the camp only has so much space for sleeping quarters—and Castiel hurries to catch up. He slips through the door behind him and into the dark.
Still, as Dean watches, he can see that the ground is sealing back up, healing over like a scab. Something is wrong. The air tastes toxic. Metallic. Ashy. He wants to be sick.
Pushing out a heavy breath, Castiel nods.
“He’s right, Castiel,” Mary adds, shooting a wary glance at Dean as he makes his way over to where they stand. “You can barely walk straight.”
“Touché,” Dean says, but to Castiel’s surprise, he takes a breath and pushes on. “Seriously though. The past month has sucked. I really needed something like this.”
“Did you—“ Dean stops. Castiel waits. He doesn’t go on.
At some point between leaving the park and being dragged into his dad’s truck, it must have slipped from his pocket. For all he knows it’s melted on the floor of the house, the cellulose sending acrid black smoke curling toward the ceiling until the ceiling crashed down on top of it.
She closes her eyes, waiting, and Castiel reaches out. Inside, the djinn’s mind is a swirl of chaotic blue. He chases every strand, every word, every story, searching each truth for the hint of a lie. There is none.
“No car in the driveway, curtains closed. Looks like nobody’s home, but the interview transcript Donna sent said he would be off work all week. Maybe he’s just running errands?”
“What about?”
Castiel’s stomach lurches. He tastes bile. Johnson is only nineteen years old. Castiel is just barely twenty-five himself, and it’s at times like this that he remembers it.
John’s feet crunch over gravel as he circles the car. The driver’s door creaks as he pulls it open. Slams shut.
“Let me rephrase that,” Castiel says, voice a little strained thanks to the slight constriction of his throat. “Do you think you
“All the times when we came close to admitting that this—” he gestures between them, “—was more than either of us were letting on. All the times when we nearly did something about it.”
“It’s an incredibly long and complicated story, but the archangel Michael is intent on bringing an apocalyptic war to this world. The ritual I intend to carry out will give me and my friends the means to stop him, and we need fruit from the tree of life to complete it.” He glances back at the charred tree, empty of leaves or fruit. “But it seems that we’ll need to find a new way. What happened?”
“Do you feel that?”
They return to the couch after they’ve eaten, and though their conversation is stimulating, Castiel’s eyes start to droop around 2am. He startles awake when Dean reaches across the couch to pat him on the shoulder.
“...Gilda’s horse?”
“I killed him.”
, he thinks as he pushes back to his feet and begins to unbutton his shirt, but as far as he can tell, there’s nothing beside the strange thought that seems out of the ordinary.
“Yeah,” Dean says, and types something else before locking the phone and sticking it back in the console. “Just more of the same bullshit, and honestly…We need to be focusing on the nephilim. Let’s just get through this job, and we can deal with Sam when we’re done.”
, is what he says, but when Cas drags Belphegor back into the crypt, and they all agree to the demon’s half-baked plan, it sure as hell feels like it.
The taste of bile is still heavy on his tongue. His head spins. He backs up a step.
Castiel sends up a silent prayer for the safety of its crew. Angel Eyes’ own right side is struck again by another cannon shell before he’s even reached
“But I will if you want me to,” Castiel says. “And I suspect that you do.”
So Castiel blinks at him, feigning confusion.
“No.”
While he’s waiting, he makes two cups of coffee—the second mostly for show—and looks at Dean through the window. He’s standing by the open trunk of the Impala, rolling his neck from side to side and grimacing as he digs his knuckles in. Castiel sighs.
It’s pitch dark when Castiel wakes the next morning.
“I won’t,” he promises. “I just—Dean, it’s difficult to know what you need from me. And I want to be what you need.” Castiel spreads his hands helplessly between them. “I just don’t know how.”
Dean’s whole body is still oversensitive, balancing on a razor's edge of too much, but the way Cas is looking at him has him craving more against all his better judgement. Biting at the soft swell of Cas’ lower lip, he squeezes around Cas’ cock again, loving the heat of him, the way he moves. How tightly he’s holding on as Dean lifts his hips and sinks back down.
The words leave his mouth of their own accord, and in a way it feels as though someone else said them. He’s been half-thinking about telling Dean since it happened back in February, but every single time the possibility has crossed his mind, he’s decided that it’s too big a risk.
it gets—louder, deeper, more resonant—but with something unmistakably wrong underneath it. A bitterness sinks into his teeth and sets him on edge in a way that isn’t helped by the constant current of fear and anger and helplessness that presses in on him from all sides in this place.
. He lost his soul because of them, because he was trying to save them, and—
“So far. Hey—should I bring my guitar?”
Dean seems thrilled by the reaction, and he laughs to himself as he uncaps a tube of antiseptic. He’s the picture of smug satisfaction, clearly pleased with himself for making Castiel flush. Like many moments they’ve shared over the past nine years, it feels like a challenge. For once, Castiel decides to take it.
But most of all, he wants Castiel to take the burden of decision out of his hands. He wants to be freed from the pressure of making the right choices, of making any choices at all. He wants to trust Castiel to take care of him; wants Castiel to trust himself enough for the both of them.
, and Dean just feels a kind of soul-deep warmth that starts somewhere in the center of his chest and expands ever outward. It spreads to the tips of his fingers and the soles of his feet; fills him until he’s overflowing with it.
“What’s with the other bit?” she asks after a moment.
Castiel isn’t sure that he’s ever hated an inanimate object quite as much as he hates the bell over the door at the Red Robin truck stop. Each time it rings, he feels a low, anticipatory swoop in his stomach—a hopeful flutter that is repeatedly followed by dismay when every newcomer is revealed to be a stranger. It happens a dozen times, maybe more, but he still looks up every time and curses the bell for each disappointment.
Sure, he also wants to visit him just for the hell of it. He’s big enough to admit that the guy interests him, that he’d like to get to know him more as a person and less as a name on a page, and if anyone asked, he wouldn’t deny that Castiel is easy on the eyes.
He gets to his feet.
“Hello, Jack,” he says.
Side by side, they descend the stairs, making their way back down Parker’s driveway toward the Impala.
Ruqayya smiles, and it’s genuine this time, though her eyes grow sad.
Dean hums his agreement as he takes his first sip. By the time they step into room five, he’s already drained the cup.
Is he sulking?
His eyes crinkle at the edges, and Cas feels warmed to the core.
He’d stood there in that cemetery, his finger on the trigger, and he’d wanted to do it. A part of him had wanted to do it. He’d looked at Jack and seen nothing but another monster who’d taken his mother away—gold eyes instead of yellow—and he’d
Making his way back toward his room, Castiel tries to dampen his angelic hearing as much as he can, but it’s easier said than done. In spite of his efforts, he hears Sam putting their two mugs down on the counter; Dean opening the cabinet to take out another; the scrape-whine-rattle of the top drawer as one of them pulls it open to fetch a teaspoon.
“Was it my use of profanity, or the thought of the act that made you lose control?”
Tell him I’m sorry :(
“Told you, Cas,” Dean says, scribbling in the corner of the page until the ink starts flowing. “You’re not the one who needs to apologize here.”
Dean whistles low as he drops everything he’s carrying onto their bed.
It doesn’t help that Cas still seems so intent on pretending that they’ve had any say at all in their lives until now. Dean can’t stand it. Somehow, it just cuts deeper, to know that Cas is still even remotely convinced by the story. The big lie.
It’s a lie, of course. But even the thought of admitting that he’s only calling to cure his loneliness is embarrassing, and he can’t bring himself to do it.
“He was alo extremely attractive, now that I think of it. I suppose that might have influenced me to make the connection.”
“What are we still doing here?”
Dean thinks for a moment, then shakes his head.
He has no memory of climbing from the car, nor of walking through the glass doors of the building, but suddenly he’s following Ellen and Bobby across the speckled linoleum of the waiting area, past a woman arguing with the officer at the front desk about a traffic violation. They can see Sergeant Diana Ballard through the door leading into the Sheriff’s office, talking to an officer Castiel doesn’t recognise, and Special Agent Victor Henriksen.
“You never try to hurt me, either,” Dean points out. “Not really.”
Castiel’s whole body stiffens in Dean’s arms, pulling away, and it breaks Dean’s heart.
“I don’t see how,” Castiel tells him, though secretly he thinks it already has. Dean didn’t even
“Sure, I bet that’ll work.
“Not coming.”
them,” she suggests with a meaningful wriggle of her fingers. Dean shoots her a sharp look.
“Then what are you waiting for? Start driving. You can be here by midnight.”
“—you should try to avoid making it hurt in the first place.”
Dean hip checks him as he sets off down the street, turning to walk backwards while Cas catches up to him.
After all, he’d had the thought in the beginning that he was only using his desire to know about the owner of the jacket as an excuse to call his brother.
“Will you stay the night?” Castiel asks.
“Are you alright?” he asks. Dean exhales heavily.
“I could say the same to you.”
“Depends. You bailing?”
He cups Dean’s jaw, drawing him into another kiss.
“Yeah. You can drive. I want you to drive. Sorry,” he huffs a laugh, rubbing at his neck. “I told you I’d probably fuck this up with knee-jerk bullshit.”
Not now that he knows the taste of them, the shape of them, the weight of them on his tongue. Not now that he knows the feeling of simultaneous dread and relief that comes from standing on the precipice and leaping right off; of grasping at the nearest handhold at the last possible moment, too afraid to fall all the way, too afraid to fall alone.
“It was an instinct, yes. But you
“You would do that?”
“Shut up, I’m hungry,” Dean huffs, giving Castiel a look of feigned offense that does little but make Castiel want to kiss him. Admittedly, most things that Dean does make Castiel want to kiss him, but that’s a problem he’s given up trying to solve.
“Not a hundred percent, but I was pretty sure. Gaydar’s a wonderful thing.”
“Gotta— outside. Air. I can’t—”
“Why are you here?”
Something moves upstairs, scrapes over the floorboards,
“Anything.”
“About hunting?” Dean asks, surprise clear in his voice. “That’s a big step.”
“You can sing that tune all you want, Dean, but I’m pretty sure you haven’t slept right all month.”
“Even by our standards,” Castiel agrees.
Time slips. Starts. They pass through Galveston, and then somehow they’re in Dallas. Fort Smith, Arkansas. It’s just after dawn—another day, Dean’s losing track—when a new sign welcomes them to Louisiana, and John speaks for the first time in hours.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says when he pulls back. “Didn’t mean to leave so long between visits. What’s it been, like... six months?”
Licking into Cas’ mouth in a filthy slide that has Cas tightening his hold around Dean’s wrist as his thrusts grow more erratic, Dean’s mind spins through the ways they could be together. All the ways that Cas could dismantle him.
Dean figures they have until the end of the day at the latest before the deputy stops accepting their story and goes looking for the sheriff herself.
Now, as he crouches down to unzip the bag, he’s a little worried that he was wrong. The guy ropes are all tangled together in a big lump, for one thing. One of the poles has a sizable bend in it, and the fly cover has a vague mildew smell that makes him wrinkle his nose. Worse, it looks like Daniel had thrown out the set-up instructions at some point between then and now, and Castiel can barely remember where to begin.
Reaching out, Castiel catches Dean’s wrist in one hand and his fingers in the other, expending a shimmering wisp of grace to work the splinter free. He’s not sure what compels him to make such a show of it — he could have healed the minuscule injury from where he’s sitting without touching Dean at all — but he can’t help himself.
“But it would be permanent, wouldn’t it? Dean wouldn’t be able to come back, and neither would I.”
Usually, they only move from place to place once the sun has gone down. It’s easier for John to steal a new car when nobody is awake to notice them skulking around; easier to creep through the streets when there are shadows for them to hide in.
you already said you’d do it, no take backs
“No one likes a smart-ass, Cas.”
Castiel smiles, skimming his fingers over a light constellation of freckles above Dean’s left pectoral, slipping against the thin sheen of sweat that’s gathered there.
“A hundred and twenty days,” Castiel says, and Dean stops counting. “Though, that’s assuming a full forty-eight hour period in your time, so if you visited a little earlier in the day it might be closer to a hundred.”
“Please tell me it’s better than Red Cloud,” he says, inhaling the steam that rises from the cup.
He grabs one of the coffees as soon as he’s within reach.
Dean shoves at him lightly, pushing Castiel back toward the bathroom. Castiel hits the sink and leans against it, staring at Dean as he drops to his knees in front of him to pull the jeans the rest of the way off. Castiel raises his brow, lifting one foot and then the other to help him in his task.
“Why the hell not?”
“Nah,” Dean says. He leans in, kissing Castiel once, before pulling away and gesturing toward the nearest bed. “Just don’t want you distracting me. Sit down?”
“Fine. But you’d better stow your crap. I don’t want either of you getting killed out there because you’re too pissed at each other to do your job right.”
This time, when another long moment of silence results in Rowena being the only one to raise her hand, Dean doesn’t bother to argue.
“That’s because I chose him,” Jack replies, his tone matter-of-fact and at wholly odds with the troubled look on his face. It throws Dean for a loop. He blinks.
It’s deliberate in a way that ultimately just draws more attention to his absence, and Castiel wonders how long they’ll be able to keep it up. How long they’ll manage to avoid the topic before the vacuum it creates pulls them both to pieces.
Castiel wants nothing more than to reach out to him. To comfort him however he can, but he doesn’t have the right. Not yet. Maybe not ever. He still has to try.
Castiel squints at him. Dean rolls his eyes.
“Belphegor was a demon.”
“It’s fine.”
When Bobby puts the phone down, he stares at it for a long, agonizing moment before he finally lifts his head to meet Castiel’s eyes. Castiel knows what he’s going to say before he even opens his mouth. He can feel it, singing thrumming
Cas works his fingers through Dean’s belt loops and tugs him closer, only to breathe against his lips, “Then ask.”
Dean squeezes his arm, moving his hand back and forth a couple of times as he tries to wake him, and in his half-asleep state, Castiel thinks that he’ll gladly lie here another ten minutes if it means Dean will keep touching him like that.
“Dean, do you want… personal space?”
“So. You hated it.”
Castiel’s brow furrows.
He fills the bag until it’s almost overflowing, letting out a startled noise when another fruit rapidly springs into existence inches from his hand.
“One slightly flat tire doesn’t make it a—”
“Weren’t you bored?”
The woman relaxes a little and looks at Castiel.
The woman who answers the door when they knock is in her seventies. As soon as her eyes fall on Castiel her hand flies to her mouth.
Dean snaps his mouth shut, casting a sidelong glance toward him.
“Yeah?”
Dean just blinks at him for a moment before he nods.
He swallows against the sick feeling in his throat. He has no time for his own encroaching panic. His men need him.
Nodding, Castiel stands, holding it out.
He wants to feel worthy.
“It’s just better when you’re here,” Dean says eventually.
“Can you just,” Dean hesitates, clicking his teeth together. “I dunno. Tell me about one of your fucked up brothers. Help me put this crap in perspective.”
“Right. Molecules.” Dean frowns. “We gotta work on that.”
“Of course, Cas,” she says, a relieved tone to her voice. “I’m so glad. But— you said your grace is still healing? Does that mean you’re at risk?”
Castiel feels like he might vomit. They’re losing altitude, fast, and their chances of getting out of range of the enemy and landing before they crash into the dense forest are slim to none.
Pain. Liquid fire shooting through his veins, out out out from the still-healing wound from Ramiel’s attack and spreading, shattering, splintering like shrapnel that reaches the very edges of his body and beyond, into the ether, where even his wingtips curl with it, aching. Burning.
“Don’t make me kick you out of the driver’s seat before I’ve had time to commit the sight to memory.”
“Something to look forward to,” Castiel smiles, and Dean grins over at him.
He leaves it in shreds on the foyer floor.
So he’d checked the spines of the nearest books for their authors, hoping he’d find novels with familiar names like Vonnegut or Kerouac, or texts on supernatural beings and urban legends, or
Looking down at him, Castiel smiles. Dean glances up and flushes redder than the morning sky.
The sense of relief that rushes through Castiel’s senses is short-lived—a lead is just the first step, after all, and they still don’t know what they’re actually going to do once they catch up with her—but Dean’s excitement is enough to buoy him.
Dean is waiting for him by the door. He looks just as tense.
“About what?”
He’s not certain how he knew to say so, but when he tries to remember the conversation he’s just referenced, it’s all there, as sharp and clear as any other memory he could try to pull forth. He remembers Sam calling him as he’d sat behind the wheel of his truck, waiting for the driver ahead of him to place their order at a drive-through burger joint on the other side of Rock Springs, Wyoming. He remembers Sam’s voice, how irritated he’d been as he’d told him,
Not the feeling—that has been there for years, poorly concealed and just below the surface—but the action that echoes it. Dean has never done something like this, and Castiel has never been brave enough to try it himself. He’s still not, he realizes as he looks down at their hands tangled together and tries to strategize a safe response.
The closer he gets, the
Dean can’t really blame them. This isn’t just a handful of people they need to keep on lock, after all—it’s a whole damn town. Short of cuffing the lot of them to the high school’s fence, there’s not a whole lot that they can do to keep them from wandering back into town once they really get tired of waiting.
“Sure, if you wanna make it sound ridiculous.”
Castiel is just as disturbed by the thought as Dean is, but if it comes down to it, he’ll do what needs to be done. He’ll do what Dean cannot. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s had to set his personal principles aside for the greater good, though he wants to believe they’ll find a solution before he’s forced to do it again.
, and Dean had written back to say
Sam looks surprised, but he can’t feel what Castiel can. There’s tension rolling off Dean in waves, and the squeeze he delivered to Castiel’s shoulder communicated everything that he couldn’t say out loud—he’s still with him, and he’s going to talk to Sam. He’s going to tell Sam. Now.
“I want you to, uh… call the shots. Wanna be, y’know,” his eyes dart away, and Castiel can tell that what he says next takes a lot out of him. “Good for you.”
“Can we get an extra side of bacon?” Dean asks the waitress, completely oblivious to Castiel’s internal crisis. “We’re gonna share.”
Sleep doesn’t come easily. He’s still wide awake after an hour, running his fingertips over Dean’s chest as he lays curled against him. Dean drops a soft kiss to the crown of his head.
Castiel only smiles wider.
Dean is silent for a while after that, swinging slowly as he considers everything that Castiel has said. Castiel has always appreciated that about him; behind the brash and careless exterior that Dean performs for the world, he’s got an incredible capacity for thoughtfulness. He only wishes that Dean were comfortable enough in himself to let everyone else see it.
On some level, he’s aware that the dehydration and hunger are probably making his mind slip again—it’s happened before, when he’s been sick and feverish, exhausted from blood loss, from lack of sun or mental stimulation, too much salt and not enough sustenance—but it’s better to be safe than sorry.
“Sure,” he says. “With regular people, or people who are actually…”
Dean’s got nothing. He looks around at the others, all staring up at the sky with matching expressions of hopelessness, and knows that they’re screwed. More than usual.
“So. What now?”
“Not photoshop.”
“Holy shit,” he says.
“You are
“Oh--shit, I’m sorry, Cas.”
“He will be,” Dean says, and nods toward the dinosaur, an amused look crossing his face. “Old friend of yours?”
Castiel holds his gaze for a few seconds, and Dean gives him a shaky smile.
She kicks up stones as she goes, and a little further away, Castiel sees two fawns scrambling along after her, half-hidden in the vegetation.
“Get in the car, Cas. I wanna get to Danville before the dinner rush.”
“Whoa,
“I guess not, no. But still.”
“You—”
“Fucking you did feature in several of my fantasies,” he agrees, and Dean lets out a low sound, his hips twitching up and making his erection bump against Castiel’s chest, trailing wet against his skin. It’s almost enough to distract him from his task, but he holds firm. Lifts his brow and looks up at Dean’s face. “I believe I told you to stay still.”
The phone keeps buzzing, and buzzing, and buzzing, and he doesn’t pick it up, but it doesn’t matter. Whatever Sam has to tell him, Dean can’t help him. Either he’s calling because his attempts at protecting their friends has failed, or he’s calling because he’s saved everyone.
“Thank you. I’ll keep that in mind.”
“Let me know when you need a refill,” she says with a wink.
Dean drops the pen on the table, turning to look at Castiel with a tight smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes.
“Honestly? I have no idea. Only one way to find out.”
“What is your name?” she asks.
He leads her up into the attic, then points toward the trunk of records.
Before he’s been able to properly consider the idea of massaging Dean’s shoulders, Dean catches Castiel looking at him and points an accusing finger.
“You do realize that the shower is several feet to my left,” he adds.
“It was good to see you, Dean,” Castiel says, and Dean’s palm slips against his, warm and dry. It’s a comforting feeling, having Dean’s hand in his.
want to stay. Dean, I
“Is everything okay?
“Missed you today,” Dean murmurs, and it seems as though the words spill from him without his control. His walls crumbling away, nerves already dissipating even with this one small gesture. Castiel smiles.
Dean counters. “Don’t think I’ve forgotten what you were like at that—what did you call it? A den of iniquity? And now you’re giving me all these sly looks, and this morning you’re just casually offering
There's still a chance. Those three dots, if nothing else, say that Cas isn’t entirely done with him. There’s still a chance. Dean has a chance.
"That sounds like an excellent idea, Dean."
A short chapter to wrap up the prompt. This is it for now, but please let me know if you want more!
He decides to skim the rest of the corporate fluff and get to the real message of the email. He hears the shop door open with the electronic dings of the bell, but doesn't look up, too intent on getting to the bottom of everyone's tension.
He hears a not-so-subtle clearing of a throat just as he reads the first line of contact info. *Castiel Novak, VP of Sales*
Jo hands them their drinks without interrupting the conversation, then moves just out of earshot. At least Dean Hope's she can't hear the next thing out of his mouth.
He sends it, then after a moment of consideration he starts a new message.
"Yeah. She wants donuts, so I gotta stop at the Gas 'N' Sip."
He doesn't wait for a reply, just locks up the apartment and heads out to the car.
He pulls Castiel on top of him in one smooth motion, surprising a laugh out of the man. But behind the amusement in his gaze, there's a heat that sends goosebumps down Dean's spine. He feels strong hands trailing down his chest, but foreplay is the furthest thing from his mind as he gropes for the lube and strip of condoms he remembers putting on the nightstand before they fell asleep. They're both ready when he rolls the condom on and lines them up. There is a slight burn and stretch, but he revels in it, his breath hissing out between his teeth until Castiel is buried to the hilt, pressing their foreheads together when Dean wraps his arms around his neck.
"Well, Castiel...my offer stands" he throws his drink back and pulls out his wallet to settle the tab, "Wanna get out of here?" The corner of Castiel's mouth quirks up in a half-assed grin, and he knows he's sealed the deal. He knows he's going to catch hell from Ellen, but if Castiel looks as good Naked as he does wearing a trenchcoat in a bar, then he'll take the ass-chewing a hundred times over.
“It’s fine. I have other friends.”
“This is what they meant,” he mutters without explanation, and shifts forward to kneel on the back seat as he pulls Dean forward by his bloody hand. Roughly, he pushes Dean’s t-shirt sleeve up, wiping the edge of his knife against his jeans before he presses the tip to the skin of Dean’s shoulder. “I’m sorry, Dean. I can’t risk it. They told me.”
Because that’s what this is, he realizes.
Dean falters, trails off, and Castiel regards him for a moment before he speaks.
Blinking, he mentally replays Dean’s question before he answers. There’ll be plenty of time to kiss Dean later. Focus.
The next town they stop in is the kind that even tumbleweeds avoid. A dusty little flyspeck in north-eastern Nevada with a cemetery bigger than its main street. John follows the overgrown railroad tracks for a few miles, then turns onto a dirt road.
🙄ok cas
and what’s with the casual friday outfit??
“I know. They only sought to protect the tree. I regret that I was not here to reach an understanding earlier.”
“Better late than never,” Dean says. Looking around the bustling cafeteria, he searches for any sign of a tan trench coat, but comes up with nothing.
“Already taken care of. I made campfire nachos.”
Victor hesitates.
“Rowena. Please.”
, John had promised before he left, siphoning holy water into a flask.
Dean’s words cut off with a sharp cry, and though he tries to twist away, he’s trapped against the car door. He stops struggling after less than a minute, once he realizes that John isn’t trying to kill him.
________
“Just. Wanna touch you,” he says, and Castiel looks down to see his fingers are tense where he’s still gripping the bedroll, right where they’d been when Castiel first told him not to move. It seems like forever ago.
“I’ll endeavor to keep that in mind,” Castiel says, circling Dean’s nipple, still wet from his tongue. “But you never answered my first question. Do you want me to tell you what I imagined doing with you?”
His vision starts going spotty before he realizes that he’s not breathing properly, and then there are hesitant hands on his face. Warm, dry palms.
Dean’s chest is aching, his throat closing up. Charlie’s cool hands on his cheeks bring him back.
“Hah, you think I’m
to. Do you trust me?”
“What?” Castiel asks, feigning cluelessness that Dean clearly doesn’t buy. He drops his hands to level Castiel with a sceptical gaze.
Please note that there is an image containing text in this chapter -- I have included a transcript of this text in the end notes :)
Castiel raises his brow, challenging, and Dean purses his lips in an attempt not to laugh. He fails, and shakes his head.
Dean rubs at the back of his neck.
The bunker looks just as it did the last time he was here.
Dean’s smile fades. He didn’t really have a plan when he came in here. He feels hollowed out. Like someone scraped his insides away and left him with nothing.
“Kiss me.”
“If you want me to.”
“Do you think it...” Castiel trails off, uncertain of how to ask. If he even should. Dean is quiet and patient, and that’s enough to strengthen Castiel’s resolve. “You think it ever gets easier?”
Dean wasn’t sure how to tell him that people aren’t that much better now, so he didn’t. He just nodded and held his weathered hand and told his grandfather that he’d do his best. It’s all he could do.
“Ophaniel was your—”
“Dean, whatever you decide to do, you’re going to be great at it. Just... please tell me next year if you’re overwhelmed, okay? I want to help.”
“Mm,” Dean hums. He sweeps one hand a little lower, thumb tracing the waistband of Castiel’s pants. The muscles of Castiel’s stomach and thighs twitch as he feels his arousal shift into high gear, heat pooling in his groin. He shifts, restless.
And maybe that’s the key.
. I did everything I could to find you and bring you home, and you just. You never even
Dean seems unconvinced. He nudges Castiel a second time.
“Getting into your dream school?”
“Yeah, maybe not. What d’ya want to talk about, then?”
They’d known there was a chance of side effects, of course.
Cas rarely used his own bed, except when he’d been injured, and on a couple of occasions when he’d claimed to have spent the evening meditating. Dean still thinks he was just embarrassed to admit that he enjoyed sleeping; he’d needled Cas about it until Sam told them to shut up or find somewhere else to go annoy each other.
The closeness, the vulnerability of being equally exposed, of bare skin pressed together from knee to chest; the heat of Dean hard against him, the physical evidence that yes, Dean wants him here, now, just like this—Castiel feels certain that he’ll never stop wanting to feel this way for the rest of his existence.
It’s almost too much, though Dean’s still hard he feels overstimulated and lost, and it only takes a few more strokes before he’s coming, covering Castiel’s fingers as they keep on moving, milking him of every drop.
“I knew he was interested because he
Within minutes of leaving the bunker, Dean is already planning their pitstops.
He’d fought it, he’d
A reckless part of Cas wants to just say it. To let the words he can feel on the tip of his tongue tumble out. He doesn’t.
Instead he just presses his lips together and looks back at that same point on the opposite wall. Stares at it like it might hold some answer that will hurt less than reality and wills himself to just stop. Breathe. Focus on something he can control.
“Every camera has its own folder, and none of them have useful names. I won’t know which one I need to open until I’ve already opened it. And even then, there are probably a whole lotta cameras in the hospital area.”
Castiel nods, lighting up and taking a deep pull.
“Thank you,” he hears himself saying, and Dean leans back a little to look at him like he’s lost his mind.
Dean stops. Through the door, Castiel can hear him breathe in heavily.
He spends a solid chunk of the early morning patrolling the perimeter of the town with Belphegor before they give up and head back to the school around nine. If Dean’s being honest with himself, his suggestion that they go check up on Rowena’s progress is nothing more than a thinly veiled excuse to get away from the demon whose mannerisms and expressions are all horrifically wrong on Jack’s familiar face.
“Whoever convinced you that this level of confidence was remotely charming was deceiving you.”
“This is a salon,” he says, finally stepping through the door. Inside, it’s hazy with smoke. On a narrow stage at the rear, a trio of musicians stand close together, the double-bass player plucking out the notes of something fast and energetic as Dean and Castiel make their way toward the bar. “In… um. In 2008. It’s not a bar. It’s a hair salon with a manicurist in the back. My friend Charlie is dating one of the stylists.”
“I’ve never said
“I didn’t want—”
he sings out loud, voice rasping and small. The footsteps start up again. Something heavy scrapes across the floor overhead. Someone. Someone is here. Someone is here.
Like something in him is waking up.
He tosses it over, and Dean catches it easily in his free hand. When he realizes what he’s holding, his mouth falls open wide.
He sees everything they’ve been in the decade since they met. Everything they’ve fought for together, and fought against for one another, and he knows that they were both fools to think that giving in to this could ever break them. That giving in to the want they’ve both felt for so long would ever do anything but make them stronger. Better. More.
When Dean is finally bare before him, beautiful in the soft filtered moonlight, Castiel wastes no time in hauling him close again, slotting their legs together and holding on tight.
It is bleak and crushing, a fog that won't stop rolling in. Like the ash that is left behind after another town is razed. Like the skin of those lost; faded and dull.
“I mean. Shit, that sounded-- look, I’m kinda buzzed right now. I just mean-- we’ve gotta hang out more. Not just when the world’s ending.”
Clicking his teeth together, he heads back into his room and digs through his closet to find something more era-appropriate. It’s a damn good thing he has such an affinity for vintage clothing, because it only takes him ten minutes to throw something passably 40’s style together. The pants are perhaps a little too fitted, but the shirt and tie are perfect. He ums and ahs over a pair of suspenders for a few minutes before leaving them in the closet, and heads for the bathroom to look himself over.
“Yeah,” Dean says, and Castiel slips his thumb along his lower lip to hold him back when he tries to lean in again. “Yes.”
They’re not even back to the car yet when both of their phones buzz, and they look to find that Claire has sent a picture message to both of them, along with Sam, Jody, Donna, and Alex.
“You’re ignoring a very obvious solution.”
“Yeah, but did you eat pancakes?”
“Sure sounds like something you’d say,” Benny pipes up.
She's not AT the zoo, but we believe that she's somewhere nearby holding a woman captive.
When he’d moved into Carl’s apartment, he’d furtively checked again, and found the distance hadn’t changed. It had been a comfort to know that he was so close, even as he’d been riddled with guilt every time Carl touched him.
“I’m an angel,” Castiel says, hoping that will calm him down a little. It doesn’t. He’s not sure why he thought it might.
Dean takes a deep breath.
“Is it supposed to rain?” Dean asks, rubbing at his hair with a towel.
possessed after all.
His skin, once freckled and warm from long days in the sun, is waxy and anemic. His hair is long and lank, hanging down past his shoulders, and the set of his mouth seems unaccustomed to smiling.
It makes Dean’s toes curl.
“Fuck,” Dean says, trying to kiss him again. “Let me--”
“Still. You’ve gotta tell me shit like this.”
“It could work,” Cas says, though there’s a hint of concern creasing his brow. “But what would we do with the crystal afterwards?”
“Hold on, okay?” Dean says, and Castiel nods, leaning forward until their foreheads are touching, his hands linked around the back of Dean’s neck. “Here we go.”
“Am I the hot quarterback in this scenario?”
“Quit eavesdropping, brat!”
Dean picks a point on the wall behind them to look at, and tells them everything. Tells them about going to Billie’s library; about her single-minded desperation to kill Dean for what he’d done to her. How she’d claimed that Chuck was to blame for the people disappearing. How she’d stalked them through the bunker and crushed Dean’s heart with a thought. He doesn’t mention that it still feels like her vise grip is squeezing tight around it.
“No,” Jack says after a moment, and Dean nods.
“That rumor’s still going around?” he asks.
He wonders, not for the first time, how hard it would really be to run for help now that John seems to be avoiding the weather. How far he could get before his legs gave out. But thunder shakes the roof above him. Rattles the windowpane as the rain grows heavier, wind throwing it hard against the glass where it runs in rivulets.
The knock at his door frame is perfunctory at best. Sam’s knuckles are still resting against it when he pushes the door open and sticks his head inside. Dean glances up from the book that he hasn’t so much been reading as staring at, exhausted and somewhere between drunk and hungover--it's hard to say, given his habits over the past few days. “Have you spoken to Cas?”
“No, it’s okay.”
When Dean pulls him into a hug, pressing chest-to-chest in the cool water, Castiel is so grateful that nothing has changed that he forgets to be conflicted about it.
He buys bread and rice and tinned tomato soup, the thought of cooking anything more involved for himself to eat alone making him think of Dean again, and avoids the temptation to buy another packet of cigarettes. Since Dean told him about what happened--what
“I think he’s hurt,” Jack says, his hand still resting lightly on Dean’s back. “I don’t know what happened.”
“Can I ask,” he says after a moment. “You mentioned combat fatigue earlier… you’ve been at war?”
“On what?”
When they reach Dean’s room, it’s a little past noon, and he’s propped up against several pillows, his broken arm pressed to his chest as he gazes blankly at an old Dukes of Hazzard rerun on the tiny TV screen. He’s wearing Castiel’s sweatshirt. The sight makes something ache in Castiel’s chest.
“Do you need a photo of me?”
“I’m here,” he says, voice raw as Dean finally reaches out to touch him, his hands tugging at Castiel’s shirt and slipping underneath. “I’m right here.”
It wasn’t a hardship, exactly.
“I didn’t say anything.”
a hunt at the zoo?? wild. what are you hunting?
It doesn’t take long for the fish to cook, and once the flames are licking over the sides of the shallow pan, it smells so good that they’re both ravenous. But Dean’s too eager when he lifts it from the fire, and as he turns to put it down on the flat rock they’ve been using as a makeshift table, it slides right out of the pan and directly into Castiel’s washing bucket with a splash.
“I thought you just meant you needed me to help.”
He tosses his phone back onto the bed as he looks around for his clothes. Castiel points out his boxer briefs, hanging off the back of one of the chairs by the window.
“Dean, what are you--”
Dean grumbles out a reluctant
Whatever it is,
“As Dean said earlier,” Castiel pipes up, “it can best be described as a wardrobe malfunction.”
“Cas,” he says, eyes fixed on Castiel’s face with a gravity that is frankly absurd given that the topic of conversation is nachos. “You’re the goddamn best.”
Looking over at him from the passenger seat, Dean looks almost hopeful, and Castiel realizes he should’ve just shown him the message.
“Last night. Just for a little while. He’s okay.”
Dean’s afraid to ask questions, or to even answer, so he opens the door. Climbs out. He moves slowly. Carefully. No sudden movements. He closes the door.
“It felt like dying, Cas. Like being—
“So,” Dean says, pausing to clear his throat. “You got any plans for today?”
“You don’t have to--”
_______
Without any kind of conscious decision, Castiel’s legs carry him back the way he’d come; down the hallway, into the elevator, through the crowded foyer and out into the biting cold. He sucks in a deep breath as soon as he gets outside. It splinters like glass in his lungs, but it’s cleansing all the same.
Dean gestures back toward the records.
“Take a look,” she says.
“Thank you, Donna,” Castiel adds, and smiles when Donna replies.
“It’s not.”
“So, uh… everyone’s gone up the hill behind the bunker to wait for the fireworks,” Dean tells him, gesturing vaguely with his thumb. “There’s a bit of a cliff where the trees end. You can see for miles.”
Dean chews the inside of his cheek and lifts a shoulder, far too casual.
, I need to call Ally.”
“What? No. Jesus. Cas, this is—what did I just finish saying to you? Don’t fucking
“Please, just. Leave it alone. For now, I’ll—”
*************************************************************
Maybe he just needs to get used to it.
Most likely, he rationalizes, Dean had asked if Castiel had managed to get Sam away from the fire. He doesn’t realize he’s still standing there overthinking it all until Henriksen taps him on the arm.
“Get out of the car.”
Sam doesn’t reply, but Castiel can see him thinking. A crease forms in his brow as he gnaws insistently at the inside of his cheek. Castiel refrains from continuing until Sam has had time to process.
“This morning. You weren’t up yet.”
“Little light reading for the road trip?” he asks, dropping his bags on the floor and coming closer. The sharp, sweet scent of toothpaste lifts on the air as he gets closer, and Castiel has the wildly distracting thought that he’d like to find out if mint still tastes cool on Dean’s mouth, or if his warmth cancels it out.
“You want me to take a look at that before I head out?”
Reaching out, Castiel slides his palm over Dean’s chest, up to his shoulder, and Dean’s hand rises to settle over it.
The drive home to the bunker takes all of thirty-two minutes. Dean spends every last one of them with his fingers so tense around the wheel that his hands cramp. There’s dirt under his nails, leftover from the hours-long clean up in the cemetery, and the heavy fetor of death clings to him.
It’s only a handful of minutes before Dean has the tire full and the truck ready to go, and with Sam present, Castiel regrets being unable to say goodbye the way he’d like to. Instead, he climbs into the driver’s seat and turns the ignition. Dean knocks his knuckles against the hood.
Dean looks a little like he’s been kicked in the gut. Castiel winces.
“Take as many as you’d like,” Ruqayya says.
Dean stares back at him, and swallows hard, and for a moment it seems to work. He takes a deep breath.
They’re both just looking at him, waiting, and Dean knows he has to keep going. Has to tell them what happened. But it’s personal, and it’s fresh, and Dean— he’s rudderless at sea.
Castiel winces. He doesn’t want to lie to her, but he doesn’t want to make her worry when it wouldn’t do any good. Looking up at Dean, who’s in the middle of giving Garth directions to a storage locker with a curse box he deems “
“No, no, no, no, no—” Dean’s face is covered by his good arm, his whole body shaking as he mumbles under his breath, mouth pressed to the fabric of his borrowed sweatshirt. “No,
Suddenly, his eyes are bright with tears, and Castiel thinks he’s done too much. Shown him too much. That he’s frightened Dean with the reality of how Castiel sees him. Overwhelmed him with the sensation of how it feels to love him, to know him.
“Mmhmm. Steak and broad beans. Just before I heard you, I was... craving someone’s company. Since I’d returned home from Poland, I hadn’t seen anyone. I’ve never really made friends easily, and of the three I’d had before the war... well, the only one still alive was Daphne, and she’d moved to Colorado. It had been months since I’d seen anyone I could be myself with.”
“It, uh. It was last night. Almost midnight? I was watching TV, and it just… it came in through the fireplace.”
Dean watches as he slips a length of wire from his tool bag and works it into the tiny gap around the window. He wriggles the lock until it pops open. In another circumstance, Dean might have thought it was kind of cool that his dad knows how to break into a car. It seems like the kind of skill that an action hero would have. He wonders if that’s what John feels like right now.
“Dr. Parker Thompson?” Dean asks, and flips his badge open when Parker nods. Castiel follows suit. “I’m Special Agent Reed, and this is my partner Special Agent Anderson. We need to speak with you regarding your recent contact with Kelly Kline.”
“Soon,” Dean says.
“He’s supposed to stick by me,” Dean says.
Dean feels Castiel’s open mouth pressed against his back, gasping into Dean’s skin as his movements become urgent, unmeasured. Reaching back, he grasps Castiel’s ass to keep him close. It tenses with every thrust, faster, faster, until Dean feels him lock up, body taut as he spills over Dean’s thighs.
Dean huffs.
He’s known the mechanics of sex for eternity; has even had occasion in recent years to put some of his knowledge to the test. None of it has prepared him for the way it feels to be taken apart and put back together by someone who loves him.
“Yeah, I guess not. Could’ve been worse, though. At least you weren’t on the can,” Dean says, then scrunches up his nose as he appears to realize that he’s led them into even less comfortable territory. “Uh. Anyway.”
His hands slide over Dean’s legs, hooking under his knees and pushing until Dean’s thighs are pressed to his chest, his cock trapped between their stomachs and leaking against his overheated skin. Cas kisses him again, his movements steady and deliberate, never speeding up.
try to return to his own time by breaking the spell, but it didn’t work. Maybe he doesn’t actually want to see Dean.
“Trap them?” Dean repeats. “Really?”
“Oh, wow, Dean-- check it out!”
“What good is having a friend from the future if he can’t tell me everything is going to be okay?”
“I didn’t,” he argues, though he’s not even sure why he’s bothering at this point, just digging in his heels out of pure stubborn pride. “I just said the violence was excessive.”
Dean pulls back a little to look him in the eye, and Castiel tries to steady himself. He takes a long breath and pushes it out in a deep sigh.
Dean barely sees the staircase, his vision is swimming so badly, but soon he’s back in his living room. Castiel’s living room. The couch is still warm from Castiel laying on it.
“Yeah, probably. Tomorrow’s gonna be a bitch.”
Finally, after everything, they’d ended up here, in an abandoned house on a dusty plot of land, tucked out of sight and mind on the outskirts of some unknown town, miles from any prying eyes. While John stood by and instructed him, Dean had installed a crude bridge in the house’s dated fuse box, and they’d shifted what few possessions they had into the basement. John carved symbols onto every surface to keep them safe.
The look Sam gives him is proof enough that his attempt at feigned indifference to the topic is about as convincing as the Federal Bikini Inspector badge Dean had given him a million years ago, but mercifully, he doesn’t press further. He does linger for a moment, though, so Dean stares hard at the page in front of him. Wills him not to notice or mention the empty bottles crowding Dean's bedside table. On the page, the words swim, meaningless, blurry. He keeps staring at them until he hears Sam sigh and walk away.
Do you need help?
“Apologies.”
“No, not at all.”
The sensations alone would be enough to bring him close to the edge, but combined with the sight of Dean kneeling over him, his free hand spread over the blankets and moving in sympathy with the one wrapped around the base of Castiel’s erection, his eyes looking up to watch Castiel watching him, it’s too much, too much,
“You know what I mean.”
He does not mention that he saw him die. That he was dragged back down into Hell by the demons that had chased after Castiel as he’d carried Dean up through the ice-cold smoke that surrounded the fifth circle.
It’s absurd how adamant Dean is about Castiel not using his grace to help with his discomfort. He wonders if he’d allow Castiel to help him if he simply used his hands by human means.
So once the door has closed, before Dean can move too far away, Castiel catches hold of his wrist. He’s relieved when Dean lets him. His pulse races under Castiel’s touch, suddenly twice as fast as it was, and Castiel tilts his head to watch his reaction as he links their fingers together.
“Just let me put the rucksack down.”
“Once. In a bar in Chicago a couple of months ago. It was very crowded, though, so I couldn’t really get close enough to see what was going on.” He chews the inside of his cheek for a moment, following Dean upstairs. “To be honest, I didn’t try all that hard to get a better look. It was a boxing match. Fighting for sport lost a lot of it’s appeal for me after seeing men fight for their lives overseas.”
“I did. She just thought it was photoshop.”
“The longer I put this off, the harder it’s gonna be.”
. And Cas, who has on occasion waited patiently in an uncomfortable motel armchair for eight freaking hours, whose entire concept of time is grossly skewed by the fact that he’s a million fucking years old, has firmly placed that ball in Dean’s court.
The theater is mostly empty, and they head straight for the back row, where Dean kicks his feet up onto the seat in front and pulls a half-full box of Red Vines from the deep pocket of his jacket. He holds the box out to Castiel and shakes it in offer.
Reaching for a notepad on the coffee table, Cas jots down the numbers, asking Dean for specifics as he does, and quickly calculates the conversion rate.
He looks at the photo again, and feels a pang of sympathy. He’s not certain, but it seems likely that Castiel and this mystery man had been in love with one another. It would explain the second article, with its terse phrasing and complete lack of detail on the content of Castiel’s farewell letter.
Bill nods, thankfully not too concerned by Dean’s weak excuse to leave, and Dean heads down the corridor to the front of the school.
“I knew it,” he says. “You laughed at me, but you’re just as interested in fellatio as I am.”
“Um... actually. Maybe don’t scroll back too far. I had a friends-with-benefits thing with this cop named Victor back in Lawrence, and uh... well, let’s just say you won’t enjoy those pictures anywhere near as much as I did.”
Also, I somehow ended up referencing a lot of things in this chapter, so for those like me who enjoy seeing where things were pulled from:
He’s guilty that he survived. That he couldn’t protect Sam. That he was out at a movie with Cas when everything went wrong. That he was dragging his feet on the walk home while Mary was dying. That Cas had to witness any of it.
“Why are you apologizing?”
In his periphery, he sees Dean nod and step a little closer before the book is unceremoniously yanked out of his grip.
“Yeah,” he says, and presses a kiss behind his ear. “Let’s go get a drink.”
Dean can’t deal with either possibility right now.
So he'd thought, this could be it. He'd take Cas out to see a shitty horror movie, and the two hours of close contact would bolster his confidence enough to get him through the terrifying act of laying it all on the line on their way home.
When he finally finds the Tree of Life, it’s standing among the crumbled remnants of a long-abandoned town, and it’s ruined. Burned. Dead.
The abbreviation means nothing to Castiel, and he frowns as he tries to remember if he’s heard it before.
“Thanks for digging all this up, man.”
“Dude, it was just
This isn't that.
"It's alright, Dean," he murmurs. "It's okay."
“By letting me take care of you, you dick.”
Exhale.
Nance was Old Doug’s old friend, but I kept her after the divorce.”
They stay like that a long time, kneeling and wrapped around one another, just holding on. It’s only when Dean yawns heavily against Castiel’s shoulder, almost fifteen minutes later, that Castiel leans back a little to meet his eyes.
Sam’s words hit Dean like a hail of buckshot.
