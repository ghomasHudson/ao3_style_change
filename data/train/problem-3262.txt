“I think I deserve a kiss before that...” Eddie cupped Buck’s face in both hands and slowly leaned into him.
Buck walked through the crow and saw a guy laid on the floor. Another guy was crouching by the side and pushing the guy laid on the floor.
“I'm gay.” Castiel interrupted Buck, said it calm while standing up. The secret that had been hidden for many years could not be kept at last. He knew Dean well and he knew how angry Dean would be as he had lied to him for ten years. He deserved it.
“Sorry guys, I'm gotta leave...” Castiel picked up his beige trench coat and prepared to leave.
“Give me twenty minutes.” Dean whispered against Castiel’s ear with rapid breathing.
Castiel’s parents were divorced when he was a little boy. Although he had two elder brothers, he was the only one who lived with his busy mother. Maybe because of his childhood longing for a father's love, he soon realized that he was only interested in boys instead of girls. Also, he was so eager for having a family with the one he love. Balthazar is ten years older than Castiel. Castiel was still a student and studying speech therapy when they met. They decided to move in together six months after they had met. Castiel met Balthazar's parents for the first time two months after they started living together. He still remembered how nervous he was, barely eating anything at dinner and just smiling and answering all of the questions from Balthazar’s parents. He was naive at the time, thinking he would be with Balthazar for the rest of his life, but all he got in return were so many betrayals and endless frighting with Balthazar.
Castiel was so shocked that his eyes were wide open and his mind was strike blank. He was totally stunned and muted, and he had no idea how to react to his best friend’s question. When Buck told Castiel that he was introducing him a firefighter, Castiel immediately thought of Dean, but Buck also said the guy is a bi-sexual with a child, so he was sure it couldn’t be Dean. He didn’t ever think Dean would have shown up here, and Dean didn’t know Castiel is gay neither. When they first met, Castiel wanted to come out to Dean, but sadly no opportunities at all.
*****************************************
“I won’t do this alone.” Eddie put down the beer to the table. “I’ve an idea, maybe I also pick out a friend over and make it become a gathering to meet a new friend? What do you think?”
“Here, it will cheer you up. It’s a… birthday present. But don't get too excited, it’s not too much, you know I'm a poor student who just graduated…” Buck handed Eddie a paper bag.
“Best friends.” Dean raised one eyebrow, and deliberately raising his voice. “Did he tell you about this?” Dean was still angry with Castiel for keeping his secret. Also, he thought that it was not the Eddie’s business, and he felt more upset when he knew that Castiel had told Eddie.
“Hello, uh… you probably don’t remember me. I’m Dean Winchester, and I was one of the firefighters who were there on the day of your accident.”
“A new deal?” Buck frowned. He was confused by Eddie’s series of actions. He couldn’t figure out what Eddie was trying to do.
“Hey, hey what happened?” Buck said it gentle to the guy beside the guy laid on the floor.
“Oh, no, I’ll be fine on my own.”
“Ouch! Dean! Not here. Everyone would see it.” Castiel said with a little shriek.
After turning off the lights in Christopher’s room, Eddie looked back at his son. “Me too.” Eddie whispered and closed the door.
“You’re fucking crazy!” Buck turned to Dean and glared at him, then he tried to grab Dean’s collar, but Eddie stopped him.
“Meg's just my good friend, she is just a cover-up...” Castiel couldn’t look at Dean in his eyes.
“Eddie, I’m sorry... about all of this... I’m sorry anyway.” After that Dean left the changing room like he was running away. The thought of meeting Castiel filled Dean’s mind. He didn’t know what he was going to say to Castiel, but he knew he had to meet him.
“Well, I don’t hate it, I just can't understand why guys like dicks…” Castiel recalled there was a time Dean said that, so he decided to keep his secret from Dean. He had been loving Dean not long after they met, and he was afraid that confessing to Dean would affect their friendship. It became even more difficult for Castiel to talk about it after they became best friends.
“Dean… wait…” Castiel’s cock was getting hard, and he really wanted to make love with Dean, but he knew he couldn’t go on without figuring out what was happening, so he pushed Dean away.
“If there’s no disasters in the world, and we don’t need firefighters anymore… You will lose your job, Dean.” Castiel cocked his head to the side.
“He properly be okay because of you.” The paramedic gave Buck a kind smile. It’s an amazing, exciting and indescribable feeling that Buck have never experienced. At this moment, Buck finally has understood why Eddie chose to became a firefighter, and he made a big decision.
“Yeah. Cas also said that you’re his good friend. But you didn’t answer to his phone calls these few days, and I guess you even didn’t read his texts, right?”
“Cas doesn’t know how to play. It’s more fun playing with Buck. Cas is... like a teacher.” Christopher said it slowly and smiled shyly.
“Cas... where is he?” Buck questioned as he followed Eddie to the changing room.
“Hey, dude, I’m sorry for ruining your dinner last Friday.” Dean has just finished wearing his uniform.
After a while, he found the door open, and he raised his head.
Happy tears filled Castiel’s eyes and he leaned forward and kissed Dean before they fell. This time Castiel didn’t object to Dean unbuckling his belt. Dean took off Castiel’s boxers, pants and socks with a little roughness and threw them to the floor.
Dean reaches forward again but Castiel catches his wrist. “Your turn.” he says simply. Dean glances up quickly but just nods once more, settling back into the bed. Castiel kneels down before him, an altar of his own, takes his time undressing the finest thing in all creation. He is less careful with Dean, tugging at his clothes until he is rid of them and down to his boxers. He maneuvers them onto the bed, Dean pliant under his hands.
“Yes, Dean?” He rubs circles into the small of Dean’s back and presses kisses into Dean’s hair.
“Let this be your only warning. Heaven knows who you are; Heaven knows
“Cas, you’re an idiot.” Dean grins and kisses him again. “So what you’re saying is-”
“Yes?”
“Alright, so we’re just gonna look for any trace of those people for now, okay? As much as I wanna gank this sucker and head home, I don’t like the way those clouds are looking at me.” Dean says as soon as he cuts the engine, head tilted to peer out the window towards the sky. He reaches into the backseat when he’s finished talking to grab for the backpack.
Dean pauses and Castiel tightens his jaw. He continues to focus on the fire with his eyes, but his mind is entirely turned towards Dean. Because whatever Dean wants, he will give him. It doesn’t matter what he asks for, it’s his. Castiel would fall forever, would die a hundred times and come back a hundred more to give Dean the world.
“Well, that was a waste of time.” Dean huffs, sliding into the booth at the downtown diner. The seats are comfortable for how old they are; cracked leather dotting around the permanent indents where they sit.
“Yes, Dean. I love you.” Castiel says it again, reveling in the way it feels on his tongue, the way his chest tightens with it. He dares to reach up and places a hand tentatively on Dean’s shoulder. Once more, his dam breaks.
They do get one helpful comment however, spilled from the mouth of an alternative looking teenager. She spoke of how her mother’s best friend went missing when they were her age, along with a few more of their friends. Her mother hadn’t gone with them on the trip that day because she had been feeling under the weather - the lucky sickness, she had called it. There wasn’t much that rescuers could do and after weeks of searching and a few more locals disappearing, they called off the searches, asking that no one enter the woods unless you were a seasoned hiker. And now, even the seasoned hikers no longer go out there.
“Don’t worry, Cas. I get it. I read you loud and clear.” Dean grits through his teeth. Castiel wonders whether there are tears in Dean’s eyes or if he merely feels them threatening his own. Dean steps away, walks towards the door and throws on his boots faster than Castiel can turn. It feels like he’s lagging behind, like Dean is moving faster than the seconds can tick by and he can’t catch up. Dean’s coat is on him a moment later and the door is pulled open in his palms before he can blink. “I’m going to get more sticks for the fire.” He says, and shuts the door behind him with a loud bang.
“That’s great, Rowena. I’ll help you get started!” Sam hurried, stepping out of the room but lingering in the hall.
Dean straightens up and takes a defensive step backwards, back towards Cas who steps forward to meet him at his side, angel blade in hand. The streetlamp outside sputters for a moment, not committed to lighting up the enclosed space before deciding to give up entirely. Darkness covers the room and it’s less than a second before the other party takes a swift few steps towards them.
Want churns deep in his gut, flaring up the pain in his limbs and adding to it in the most sickeningly sweet way. Dean tightens his grip on Cas’s wrist and pulls his battered face to his own without a second thought. Artificial air rushes out of Cas’s lips in revelation and it only takes the angel a fraction of a second to catch up. Lips crash together as they kneel in graveyard dirt. When Cas breaks away, Dean is panting and there is smeared blood on both of their lips.
“Uh, I was distracted, what did you just say?" Eddie and Castiel seemed to have a good time during dinner. Castiel is a regular guest at Buck's bar, they've known each other for over three years, and it’s the first time he had seen Castiel laughed so much, Eddie seemed to be entertaining Castiel with his incredible rescue stories. Eddie also seemed to like Castiel very much.
Dean kissed Castiel all along his chest and almost every inch of Castiel’s body. He then gave Castiel a hand job. Dean felt a sense of success in watching Castiel release from his hands and body, turning pink and making those delightful moaning sounds, making his penis get a little harder. Kissing and touching were no longer enough for Dean, so he decided to get out of bed, find his jeans on the floor and get a condom and disposable lube from the pocket of it.
“Oh, Dean… Oh…I’m coming…” Castiel grappled the bed sheet tightly, closing his eyes and groaning, and the precum was all over his cock.
“Hi, Dean.” Eddie said hi to Dean and opened his locker next to Dean’s. Dean was just putting on his uniform.
Buck saw Eddie’s smiling face and figured out Castiel may be the right guy for him. Although he was happy for Eddie, he couldn’t fight unpleasant and sour feeling at the bottom of his heart...
“you still remember it?” Castiel whispered and hung his head. He couldn’t believe that Dean did still remember their deal.
“Well, but it doesn't mean I’m 'homophobic. I… prefer my partners not to have the same equipment as me. I just can't understand gay men.” Dean lowered his eyes and whispered.
“Hey, did you dream of something?” Dean stroked the stubble on Castiel’s chin with his finger.
When Dean was back on the bed, he asked Castiel to lie on his back. He caressed Castiel’s hair and neck, and left many kiss marks on his back. Dean slipped on a condom and tore the package of lube and made sure his finger was covered with it, then he swirled and pressed outside the hole before slipping his middle finger into the little sweet hole. The wet finger was surprisingly easy to work with, and it didn’t take long for him to try putting his second finger and rotating them slowly. Dean knew the structure of the human body, and he curled his fingers slightly to explore deeply to the spot that would make Castiel gone crazy. When Castiel suddenly jerked up and screamed, Dean knew he had found it, and made the corners of his mouth turn upwards. He started to massage Castiel’s prostate gland in a circular motion with gentle pressure while he kissed Castiel’s thighs and lower abdominal. It made a return of Castiel’s erection and let him scream more and more.
be so hot, it just
“We’re back at the motel.” Castiel reiterates into Dean’s skin. Dean is flushed and flustered and chokes back a few noises before he’s able to say anything back.
“And why shouldn’t you have said it? Huh? You can’t tell me it was a lie. You can’t say you didn’t mean it. I won’t believe you.” The fire from the room was on his tongue and he felt it flicked into the words as he spoke. “No, you don’t get to take it back now. I said it back, you idiot.” The heat was in his cheeks too. Dean whipped his head up to look at Castiel and he must have felt the intensity from where he was sitting across the room.
Dean knocks his head back against the wall with a groan. “Cas…”
And still, despite everything he has seen, Castiel would never see anything more beautiful than Dean. Because Dean was love personified, and after all, there was nothing more beautiful than love.
“Dean.” Cas says again. This time, the look in his eyes is nothing but that all-encompassing, soul-devouring
The moment he entered, Dean whipped his head up from where it was laying in his hands. Their eyes met, and Castiel felt the usual pang of longing that had grown so comfortable in his chest. Every time he looked at Dean, every time he spoke to him, he felt it. Most of the time, he even felt it when he was far away and hadn’t heard his voice in days. Now, it felt supercharged, like the answers to all his questions were almost in his grasp, there if he only reached a little further.
“No.” Dean says, still chattery and far too quickly. “No, Cas, you gotta save that for when you really need it.”
Cas, I want y-” The hand was determined to stop Dean’s mouth. Castiel however, was reeling.
his name, a prayer, not actually spoken from his lips but pleaded through the press of hands on his hips. Castiel tilts his head down and connects their lips once more. Dean deepens the kiss immediately, desperate for as much as Castiel would give him. He presses his hips against Dean’s, ripping a groan from him. Castiel smiles in satisfaction against Dean’s mouth as he repeats the motion.
Castiel pulls off for a second, just briefly, to look him in the eyes as he trails his tongue from base to tip. When Dean closes his eyes, his bottom lip between his teeth again, Castiel brings him back to that edge and pushes him over.
And so, they walk again, feet carrying them carefully over the increasingly slippery ground up to the clearing in the distance. Each step is labored, painful in his boots. He can’t imagine how Dean feels.
When Dean finally opens his eyes, his breath is still coming in pants. “You- let me see you.”
may be human, but we do happen to have a little pet. Jer, why don’t we show these guys what’s waitin’ for ‘em?” The man’s grin never falters despite how much Castiel wishes it would.
Castiel tries to grasp at those words, to pull them from his chest like a loose string from the seams of his clothes, but the string breaks and his mouth fails him. Dean looks at him, reflections of flames in his eyes even with his back turned to the fire and Castiel feels his gut churn.
“For what? You didn’t get us into this mess.” Dean replies. The fire can’t answer, so it only makes sense that Dean does.
“We’re back at the motel.” he tries again, as if that is all of the information required to get his point across. Castiel looks over to him to search his features for clues and sees the flush in his cheeks. His mouth twitches up in a smile.
Dean tastes divine, sun-kissed and heady on his tongue. When he says Castiel’s name, it’s in prayer, lips sealed as comes. Castiel could live in that moment forever; the taste of him in his mouth and his voice reverberating in his head, behind his ribs.
“I could have saved you, before.” He keeps his eyes on the flickering of the flames in front of him. To look to Dean now would surely kill him.
*****************************************
“Are you done? Then you can go.” Dean folded his arms over his chest. Castiel knew the look of rejection in Dean’s face, and he was about to explode.
“When you turn twenty-one, I'll order you beer.” Eddie shrugged.
*****************************************
“I drove for nearly twenty hours. I’m still exhausted though I’ve taken a nap.” Dean took the seat next to Castiel without any hesitation. He looked like a mess.
“Chris, Buck and I have something to talk about, so get something to eat with Carla.” Eddie knelt down and talked to Christopher.
Dean never thought Castiel was gay. When they were in Lawrence, Castiel introduced Meg to him as his girlfriend. Although Dean didn't like Meg, he thought it’s Castiel’s personal choice, and Dean didn’t make any comment. Castiel said that he and Meg are in a long distance relationship after he have moved to L. A., but Dean has a doubt about this because Meg only came to L.A. once during past five years as he knew.
“Soda? seriously?” Buck frowned.
“Maybe... because you’re like that?” Sam muttered.
“We went for coffee and talked for a long time on Sunday. We both felt like we had a good connection, so we are planning to let Cas and Christopher meet on my next days off. If everything goes right, we’ll be together.” Eddie said it calm and looked at Dean without any hesitation.
*****************************************
“Call 911!” Buck shouted to a large crowd of people. “spread out and get him some fresh air!”
Dean couldn’t see the face of Castiel’s groom because he has his back to Dean. Dean just knew that the guy is wearing a white wedding suit similar to Castiel’s. Also, he has short dark blonde hair and maybe a little bit higher than Castiel. Castiel looked at his groom and his face was full of happiness.
“Cas, we need to talk.” Eddie said it with a serious look.
“Let’s make us a couple from now on.” Eddie said this in a serious tone. “No deadline.” He quickly added.
“I want to play TV games with you, when will you come to my home?”
One and half months ago
Dean opened his eyes and found it was dark all around. He could not figure out what happened as the last moment he was kissing Castiel and the next moment he could only find complete darkness. He rubbed his eyes and finally he knew that it was a dream. He looked at the clock on the cabinet beside the bed. It’s five past eight p.m.. He has slept for a couple of hours and now he believed that he could make a decision without any hesitation.
“Right. Okay.” Castiel stepped inside carefully, slowly latching the door shut behind him so as to hopefully give Dean a bit of peace of mind that their conversation would not be overheard.
Dean just grins a little wider. “That’s the one. Now come on, we’re burning daylight here.” He shuts the trunk, locking away the other weapons safely before handing Castiel the spare machete.
“Wings, Cas. Show me your wings.” Dean says it out loud this time and is surprised at how wrecked his voice sounds already. Cas just blinks again.
He can’t say those things though, not now, so he says he’s fine and hopes Dean believes him.
he was. He was sculpted and defined but not overly buff. His tanned skin was torn and bruised, sticky crimson stains splattered all over. His hair was disheveled as ever and Dean was going to make it his personal goal to defile this angel in the most
“Then surprise me, Pizza Man.” Dean grinned devilishly at him, a hand on either hip. Castiel’s cock twitched at the shift in his voice, the low rumble hitting him in his lower abdomen. He felt the growl at the back of his throat more than heard it and he shifted them a little to get more comfortable.
Cas seems to get it this time, a grin that borders between nervous and excited plastered on his face. Cas doesn’t officially answer him, but that’s alright. Dean watches the angel like a hawk as the final pieces of tattered clothing fall to the floor. The sight of him-
The downside to beginning to feel was feeling too much.
Dean just nods and tosses one of the torn bits of tent into his backpack before throwing it around his shoulders again.
“I love you, too.”
He wants Dean to feel him as much as he had needed to taste him, so he removes the last piece of clothing keeping them apart and crawls back to where he was sitting before, legs framing Dean’s torso.
“Cas?”
“Then we’d better get a move on. C’mon.” Dean groans as he steps out of the warm sanctuary of the vehicle and out into the crisp morning air. By the time they make it a few feet into the woods the cold hurts his face and, angel or not, Castiel already regrets not making Dean buy them gloves and scarves when they were at the store.
would you take off that trench coat already? It drives me
Instead of answering, Castiel raises his hand to Dean’s chest. He presses his palm over Dean’s heart and dares to extend a small bit of grace towards him. Dean responds immediately; his soul reaching out to grab at wisps while his body gasps for air.
As soon as his ass hits the concrete, the demon is over him, knees pushing hard bruises into his stomach as his temporary fists pummel his face. The wet crack of bone sounds through the mausoleum as pain flairs underneath his eye. The demon steps back and for the briefest of fleeting seconds Dean thinks they might just leave, that maybe this isn’t as much fun as they had hoped and that they would go find fun elsewhere. But, they were demons, and he was a Winchester with his angel; this was the epitome of fun for abominations like them. That was made evident by a hard, steel-toed boot connecting with his ribs. Dean cries out under the splitting hurt of it all. Another few kicks follow in swift succession; a floating feather of a thought whips around in his head about how it could be so much worse or how he could die here or maybe a mix of both. Another kick to the ribs and this time he’s sure they are broken too.
Castiel has never been bothered by Winter. Every Winter from the dawn of time has offered a fresh start at its resolution, and he has no reason to believe this one will be any different from the others now etched into time. But his millenia old bones feel different now; still with Grace but departed from Heaven, Castiel feels the seasons change in his chest, beneath his long borrowed ribcage now stamped with seals of his own. This body is his, and with it, Castiel will feel the seasons change with him.
“I thought we were going to have a wonderful sex.” Dean’s face became clouded.
“Cas, you’re so fucking hot, how could I have never noticed?” Dean knelt on the edge of the bed and looked at Castiel naked.
Dean has so many short-term relationships and one-night stands during these ten years. His longest, and the most serious relationship lasted no more than two years. He thought he would have a family with Lisa, but it didn’t work out, so he decided to move to Los Angeles for starting a new life. The reason why he chose to move here was because he wanted to be in the same city with Sam, his younger brother and also his only family member. Besides, meeting Castiel again was so surprising and exciting since he moved to L. A.
Eddie put down the frame, picked up the beer and walked to his bedroom. He turned on the light in the room and went to the bedside and sat down. He took a sip of beer and opened the drawer of the small cupboard beside the bed. He took out a piece of paper napkin with a plan between him and Buck. He had been staring at the paper napkin for a long time.
“Uh, I don't have a problem with this... you know, about the same-sex relationship thing, but don't you think it's better to find Christopher a mother instead of another father?” Dean frowned slightly.
“Can I... come in?” Castiel bowed his head, not daring to look at Dean’s face.
“I told you we’d be late.” Castiel has been nagging since the moment he got on the Impala. It was because the twenty minutes Dean said he would spend, turned into almost an hour, leaving Castiel with no time to fix his hair, making it look messy.
“What do you mean by that?” Dean squinted at Sam.
“You know I’ve got two full time jobs, firefighter and dad.  I don’t have time to plan for a date.”  Eddie took a sip of the beer holding in his hand.
“Buck, do me a favor, don’t let me die alone.” Eddie took a sip of champagne, put his glass down and gave Buck a serious look.
“For friendship!” Castiel smiled to Dean and they clinked their beers.
This evening Castiel visited Eddie’s home again.
“It's... No way! You printed it out? That football game... it's really good.” Eddie looked at the photo and smiled, as if recalling the football game. He looked rather happy.
“Oh, so it was a dream about me, that’s why you were smiling so much.” Dean threw Castiel a wink. “By the way, do you know what I haven’t told you yet?”
“I knew I can’t move on if I stay at Lawrence. I needed to break this cycle and I couldn’t do it from Lawrence, so I chose to leave. But when Sam said you were moving to L. A., I knew I was done. I couldn’t escape from you anymore. But it's been ten years, and I couldn’t wait... wait for someone who didn’t even know I loved him.” Castiel had felt a lump in his throat and barely being able to breathe. He knew it was the end.
Inside, it looks like any other barn. There is old hay strewn about on the ground and the long abandoned stalls look broken and battered. Tilting, Castiel was able to see multiple hammocks hanging from the beams. All were filled and if he counted correctly, there were at least 12 of them.
Cas moves again, slowly pulling himself almost all the way out before fully seating himself back inside. Dean is so close to utter destruction he almost doesn’t notice Cas’s hands. One leads its fingers back around his cock, slowly but surely finding a steady rhythm with his thrusts as he hits his prostate
“Yeah, or the son of a bitch could be a glutton after all that fasting. C’mon, you saying it wouldn’t want a bite of this? I’d be tasty.” Dean holds out his arms as he asks the question, raising his brows and tilting his chin down to motion to his body. Castiel couldn’t say whether or not Dean would be tasty to a monster, but he’d be a liar if he said he hadn’t thought about tasting the man in another sense of the word. Thankfully, Dean wasn’t asking about
Dean is holding his gaze intently when he motions with his head to start stepping back. He wants them to go around back, see if there is any place where they can peek through the walls to get a glimpse at what they’re up against. As always, Castiel follows Dean’s every step.
After close to two hours of driving, they finally come upon a run-down barn past the outskirts of town. There are beer bottles strewn about the yard, but they look old, crushed and abandoned likely when the barn itself had been. There is an eerie feel to the air here, like if you were to step in a puddle, the soft reverberations on the water would be enough to wake whatever slumbered here.
- was too good to be true. Dean had imagined what Cas would look like in wet dreams and wet showers, but he couldn’t have pictured how utterly
“Dean-” it comes out as a ragged whisper between kisses. Dean leans back, but leaves his hands against his face. They’re warmer now too.
“Did you kill those people?” Castiel asks, voice unwavering despite his nerves over Dean’s safety.
“For saying all that. I shouldn’t have done that to you.”
, Cas- I want you to fuck me.”
“We are.” Castiel agrees. He’s pretty sure he knows where Dean is going now, but if it’s what he thinks, he wants Dean to say it. He’s got to ask for it.
“For me?” There is unease there, apprehension. Dean’s fingers slow their ministrations and Castiel is finally able to open his eyes once again. He tilts his head back towards Dean, his forehead almost touching Dean’s own, and meets his eyes.
“You don’t have to say anything, Cas. I needed to say it. I understand if you want to leave. I-”
he wasn’t sure he would ever get enough of this. He pulled almost all the way out and slowly thrust back in, hitting the spot that makes Dean see stars.
Cas was so frustratingly, devastatingly handsome and Dean has been able to ignore his wants, his longing for so long, but in the dim light of the cemetery, covered in blood, he was intoxicating.
His mind shouts at him. He stands up in one fluid motion, fueled by the consuming need to see Dean safe. When he is back on his feet, he goes to size up his opponents and-no, wait, this isn’t right. Panic fills his hollow chest and he realizes, by the unmistakable glow coming from each of the figures, that they are undeniably
“Well , are you going to get in here or not?” Dean grumbled as he flopped down onto his bed.
“Cas...” Dean whimpered against his lips and it took all of Castiel’s restraint not to devour him on the spot. Without a word, Castiel pressed his lips on Dean’s in a heady kiss, rolling his bottom lip in his teeth as he shrugged the flannel off of Dean’s shoulders. He had waited so long for this and he needed as much of Dean as he could get right now.
“Wouldn’t still be in this mess if I did, Cas. I would have ganked that bitch so fast. Or maybe just asked them to take it back, you know? As if it’s ever that easy. Why can’t it ever be that easy, Cas? Just once I thought we had an easy salt-and-burn and of course this happens and now Sammy called you here to babysit me like he doesn’t know how much you drive me crazy. I-” again the hand swings over his mouth, forcing the end of that thought process he had been pouring out for him.
Cas crawls on the bed after him and catches his sticky mouth in his again. Desperate, needy, and harsh kisses are drawn from his lips, the bite of teeth dragging at the already cracked and broken skin. It was pure desire in the carnage of each other. Heaven’s most divine leaving pools of red in his conquest of him. With each bite, each kiss, each insanely maddening brush of hips Dean was going out of his mind with pleasure. It buzzed in his system, burned better than any whiskey he has ever tasted.
“Have you spoken to the police already?” Castiel inquires, eyes scanning over the borrowed pages. They told of the people gone missing; there were quite a few - all visitors, all went up for a hike and didn’t make it back. There were stories from longer ago as well; those pages were yellowed with age but they spoke the same tale. Left for a hike, didn’t make it back. Like the ones before, taken in previous Winters that Castiel could picture in his mind by the telltale marks of the year, there were no bodies found. Unlike the years before, all the victims were visitors to the town. At least, it seems, the people around here learned. If only tourism wasn’t such a booming business.
“It doesn’t matter if it makes me lose my job.” Dean shrugged.
Dean misses Castiel. He remembered the last time he saw Castiel, and he was so painful with all the hard feelings in his heart. He never thought his best friend would fall in love with him, so when he heard Castiel’s confession, he really didn’t know how to respond. When Castiel left his apartment that day, he fell to the floor, tears flooding out of his eyes uncontrollably. He felt so sad that a little voice in his mind told him to go after Castiel, but he knew he couldn’t because he wasn’t gay and he couldn’t possibly fall in love with Castiel. He told himself that since he couldn’t respond to Castiel’s love, he should let Eddie make Castiel happy. Although Dean would hear that little voice telling him how much he missed Castiel from time to time, he always ignored it.
“Dean, I didn’t mean to hide anything from you, and I’m really sorry. I just came here to tell you that Eddie and I are together... and I don’t want you to hear about it from him.” Castiel turned around and prepared to leave after saying his words.
“Well, he is playing both teams, but I guess he prefers chicks. He will surely get his hands on if he sees someone good, why would he introduce to me then?” Eddie opened the door of the restaurant. “Also, he works at a gay bar, and the guy he wants to hook me up with is one of the regulars who they’ve known each other for few years... guess that guy is not his cup of tea.”
“Come on, you know that I’m always gonna be here for you. Alright, I can tell you’re obsessing over this already... I’ll make you a deal. If ten years we’re both still single and neither of us have found anybody, we’ll be boyfriends, a couple, together forever.” It was a banter for Buck, who just wanted to comfort his best friend.
Instinctively, Castiel crosses the barn, a shout tearing its way out of his throat. Time seems to slow as Dean’s name is ripped from his lips; he’s on his knees behind Dean, cradling his limp form in his arms as the first bullets fly from their barrels.
“Oh, Baby, how I missed you.” he sighs, brushing his hand through the bits of snow still melting on her hood. Castiel helps get her cleared off and soon they are piled in with the backpack discarded in the back seat.
“That was… something else, Cas.” He said, a wistful grin on his lips that Castiel wanted to kiss away. So he did.
“You- what are you?” Castiel takes a twinge of satisfaction from the way his voice now wavers.
He follows Dean’s tracks, further and further into the trees. There are patches of snow that have been dug through, a sign Dean had stopped in search of kindling for the fire. Those stops had to have cost him time; there’s no way Castiel is that far behind him, so why can’t he hear him?
Cas is on him the second they materialize behind the safety of a locked door. Despite the injuries, Cas pushes him down on the bed,
“That was so good, Cas, where the Hell did you learn how to do that?” He huffed drearily into the stale air.
“You haven’t slept at all?” he asks, voice still low. It was making Castiel’s stomach feel some type of way and that needed to stop.
“Cas, I like you.” Dean says, the words coming out raspy and strained. “Fuck, it’s more than that. I… Cas, I love you.”
“Nah, if they’re here, they’re asleep. Now would be the best time to hit ‘em anyway. No use in wasting time. Maybe we can wrap this up quick and I can finally make you watch that movie I’ve been hounding you about.” Dean turns his head towards Castiel, a bright smile beaming in his direction. If he needed to breathe, it would take his breath away.
Dean’s hand smacks down on the table and then, mouth still upturned, he says, “Let’s go then.”
“Cas, we gotta talk.” Dean voiced, finally pulling his hands from the towel. He didn’t check to make sure Castiel was following as he trudged out of the library and down the hall. Castiel cast an anxious glance in Sam’s direction, but he just gave him a shrug before turning to talk with Rowena.
“Son of a bitch.” he says in an exhale. “How much do you want to bet those bastards faked everything out in those woods? Fake your death and relocate, fine, but did you
“Yes, everything. I want your mouth on my cock, I want you to fuck me until I can’t see straight, fucking come
As his gasps faded into more normal breathing, Castiel slowly pushed a finger in. He went in slow, breath hissing past Dean’s teeth until he went knuckle deep.
Castiel was right though; once he felt this, there was no way he could ever give this up. He wants to pull Dean close, to hold him against his chest and feel his holiness in his palms forever, but Dean groans about the mess and Castiel finds himself getting up to grab something to clean them up with. The torn scrap of tent makes for a good enough towel.
Dean visibly swallows; his jaw clenches and his throat works despite no sounds coming out. Dean’s hand finally brushes against feathers and Castiel shivers at the touch. His eyes close, his head tilts back just slightly, needless breaths rush from his lungs. His wings burn, flares and pockets of pain cover them in a way he hasn't felt since he fell. And yet, through divots of agony, Dean’s calloused hands feel
That didn’t make sense. If Castiel hadn’t done something wrong, then he wouldn’t feel so terrified to touch him again. He wouldn’t feel like he was walking on ice trying to talk to him.
The dam breaks. Dean is against him, pushing as much of his body against Castiel’s as he can manage. Their mouths slot together again, hard presses of tender lips aching for more. He swipes his tongue along the seam of Dean’s mouth, reveling in the way he opens up for him. A needy sound comes from Dean’s throat and Castiel is undone.
“Everything?” he asks, a low whisper. Dean shivers and nods; Castiel grins. “Good boy.”
Dean hums around his fingers, pleased with himself, and Castiel leans down to take another kiss from him. He can taste himself there and it’s downright sinful the way they taste together.
“Hello, boys.” The voice comes from a woman, her stance just in front of another three currently occupied bodies. They shift behind her, feigning the need to pop joints.
“No, but I don’t exactly need to sleep, Dean. It’s fine. You do need sleep though, so please try to get some.” It was a last ditch effort really, even though it was partly the truth. He didn’t
Castiel didn’t need to ask again. He wrapped his lips around Dean’s cock and sucked him into his mouth. He felt so big and so warm pressed into his lips and the spit in his mouth leaked down the side of him. He tasted good,
“Cas… oh my god.” the words come out in a single rush of air through red tinted lips. They’re puffy and bitten and Castiel wants to taste them, so he does. He kisses Dean until he can’t breathe, until they’re both smiling and laughing into each other’s skin. It’s perfect, golden.
. Thoroughly defiled by the heavenly host in the most righteously damning way.
“The Pizza Man taught me quite a few things, Dean. You would be surprised.” Castiel managed a sly grin, something he wasn’t used to doing but felt right nonetheless. Dean huffed out another tired laugh.
“Yeah.” Dean replied before he finished his question, leaning up to the bedside table and pulling open the drawer to grab a small purple bottle and a condom. He dropped them on the bed next to him and got comfortable again. Castiel paused to take in the full sight of him. The Righteous Man was spread out under him, open and wanting Castiel to take him. He was beautiful. Breathtaking. The freckles dotted across his face and sprinkled on his chest were more mesmerizing than the night sky and Castiel was sure he could get lost counting them all. He dragged his eyes over everything, how perfect his legs looked on either side of him, how gorgeous those glass green eyes were all lidded and full of lust. Suddenly, looking wasn’t enough. He leaned down and planted a kiss on Dean’s lips, hot and heavy. Dean immediately tangled his fingers in Castiel’s hair again, drawing a moan out from him. He ground his hips down onto Dean’s, his erection pushing against Dean’s spent cock, ushering in another wave of blood to his and proving to Castiel he was ready.
That’s when he hears it - a shuffle, a slip, thuds and scrapes and breathes heaving from exhausted lungs - and his stomach drops.
to choose a place like this?” Dean turns away from them and back towards Castiel. “You know, it makes me wonder if the old cases were the same way or if there really is a Wendigo still out there.”
“Do you understand how hard it is to be near you and not touch you?” Dean blinks back, a flash of hurt turns into confusion. “Dean, all I want is to be close to you.”
He came, hard, cock surrounded by Dean. ‘Ohh! Dean!” The moan was loud, but he couldn’t care. Didn’t have the capacity for it. He rode out the orgasm as he pushed into him, nearly collapsing when it was finally over. He huffed, spent and blissed, and pulled out, tying off the condom and tossing it in the little trash in the corner. He laid down next to Dean and peppered kisses in his hair.
“No. That’s not what I meant. I couldn’t care less what happened to them. Cas, what did you do? Just now, to me, what happened?”
Anything Dean could suggest would sound good to Castiel, so while the question was unnecessary, Castiel answers anyway. “Yes. Maybe we can get more proof to your suspicions before subjecting ourselves to the wilderness.”
Stepping down the metal stairs, he called out into the expanse of the map room and further into the bunker. “Sam? Dean?” He was met with silence, but despite the lack of direct answer, he heard shuffling about coming from somewhere. Once at the bottom of the stairs, he heard the shuffling more clearly and figured it was coming from the kitchen.
“Yeah… so just - just close your eyes for a minute, alright?”
Castiel has felt the seasons change since the dawn of time. He has walked the Earth throughout many eras, but always distant. He has seen the best of Summers and the worst of Winters. He’s felt the world be born again in the Spring just to die in Autumn. He has always thought the seasons were the most beautiful thing; the way they change and shift as time passes.
“Cas-?” Dean doesn’t finish and instead brings his coated fingers into Cas’s view. His eyes are heavy lidded, lust-blown and starshined and so, so blue. Eyes contrasted by the bright red of the slowly drying blood on his face makes Dean weak.
Light spills in, illuminating pushed up clouds of dust that swirl in the air in front of his vision. Eyes quickly jump from corner to corner, desperate to catch on the creature that was supposed to be lurking there. But that was the key word, wasn’t it?
to sleep, no matter how much he wishes he could get some at the moment, and Dean
They discuss the case more over food, but there isn’t really much more to decide. When they finish up, they head over to the store for provisions - food, flares, the usual things you’d buy for a hike, more flares - and then they return to the motel.
“Fuck, Cas, oh God, I’m gonna- fuck- I’m gonna come, Cas,
“We are.” Dean manages, grinning as Castiel places rough, biting kisses into his shoulder.
Another finger presses deep into him before Dean’s litany of cries comes to a stop. It hurts, it all
“What? For what?”
“What does?” Dean asks, now firmly seated on the raised concrete. The human’s leg brushes against his own; Castiel does his best not to mention it.
“Cas, I-”
A loud
Neither of them spoke for a minute, the air heating up in the room in mere seconds. It felt like they were burning up in here, an invisible flame somehow marking the distance separating them. Dean took in a shaky breath.
“I mean, curses are bad, right? Telling the truth was probably about the best thing that could have happened to me.” He laughed, and Castiel could feel it. He smiled into Dean’s shoulder and nodded his agreement.
“I need it now.”
Castiel is so unsure where this tension came from. He was so sure they had been on the same page earlier that he felt like he was getting whiplash. He couldn’t stand this hot and cold. He hated it. They both had said something monumental and it was unfair for the tides to turn so quickly.
They break the contact and their eyes slowly fade back to their natural colours. Dean’s are just as beautiful on their own, but Castiel would by lying if he said he didn’t love the reflection of his Grace behind his irises.
Castiel pulls away, panting. “You’re an idiot.” he breathes, not caring that Dean is standing there, stunned and lost for words. “I have loved you from the moment I laid my hands on you, Dean Winchester, and I’ll love you far after this world is gone.”
Without pulling away from the kiss, Castiel felt for the bottle and startled Dean with the
The line goes dead before Castiel can answer, but that’s alright. There wasn’t much more that needed to be said. His phone lights up a few seconds later, the text detailing the case and where to meet taking up the screen. With no need for a GPS, Castiel notes the city and starts his car. At least the long drive will be illustrated; bare bark blurring outside of his windows. Winter may be the dead season, but there is nothing near the comfort of such elegantly white calm. Winter is still, and so Castiel moves within it.
“Hell yeah. Well, let’s head out, circle the town, scout for abandoned buildings and whatnot. Maybe we’ll even gank these bloodsuckers before bedtime.” Dean grins, speaking with excitement. Castiel nods and follows Dean back out. They give obligatory waves to the woman that let them through and slot themselves back in the car once more.
“How can I see them?” Dean’s voice remains low, breathless; his fingers card through broken feathers, uncaring of the way they get smeared with crimson streaks.
“Oh, I see! Oh dearie, this is a simple spell. I’m sure you’ll have all the necessary ingredients in house, actually. Shouldn’t take me more than twenty minutes to get it all fixed up for you, boys.” Her accent coated every word in a thick syrup they were accustomed to by now. Every one of them let out a breath, relief flooding through the room. “We can discuss my payment when we’re finished.” She added, grin as prominent in her voice as it was on her mouth.
At the top, they see it. The trees break away, revealing a frozen over path up to a large cabin. It’s wood appears to be rotting in places; the roof threatens to cave in if the snow gets too heavy. There were bushes there once, thriving and bright in the Spring but shriveled and dying in the snow as they stand. Around the cabin, the windows appear fogged, dirty and smudged from lack of cleaning. Even the wood that holds it up seems worn, but it’s sturdy enough, Castiel thinks, and it’s a break from the wind and snow.
“Guess we’ve got at least a little bit of luck.” Dean laughs, walking back from the kitchen over to the couch. Castiel follows, seeing a hallway that brandishes two doors. He’s sure they’ll investigate further once they’ve warmed up.
it, but the cold is seeping into his bones in a way he’s not yet used to and reprieve from the chill would still be preferable. There is water and snacks in there, flares and material for fire, but where they are now, the ground is wet and covered and there’s no way they could camp here and survive.
Another moan spills from Dean’s lips and Castiel groans in return. It’s too much, having him here, naked and pleading for Castiel to take him apart. He kisses him again, open mouthed, right under the head of his cock. He ends up smiling against him when Dean groans louder than before.
Seasons change; leaves fall to the ground to gather in crisp piles that beg to be pressed under the weight of your heels. Those leaves get blown away; they decay and get lost to the soil only to be covered up by eventual snowfalls. Snow melts under the warmth of the sun and new leaves grow in place of the old ones. It continues on, in circles like that; a never-ending flow, always the same progression throughout the years. Castiel has seen many seasons- all of them, in fact- and yet every time he watches the first leaves of autumn disconnect from their branches and float to the ground, he can’t help but to feel a beautiful sense of calm.
Dean was growing as impatient as Castiel and in a second he was taking off Castiel’s blazer and undoing the buttons on his shirt, leaning up to place kisses on his neck at every step. Castiel was growing heavier with want every second and his need to feel Dean under him was getting hard to contain. Growling, he helped Dean out of his own shirt.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel says.
“I have to agree.” Castiel spoke after leaving Dean’s now puffy lips alone. Dean turned in his grasp, pressing his back up against Castiel’s chest and letting out a blissful sigh.
They were surely both grinning like fools, but exhaustion was quickly taking over. Wrapped in each other, sleep took them, and for the first time, there were no nightmares or monsters in their dreams. Only sweet kisses and lovely truths.
“Cas, please…” Dean rasped between kisses, his hands roaming over Castiel’s cloaked back. “Coat, please take it off.” Castiel stepped back and let it fall from his shoulders. They were both painfully aware of the tightness in their pants as well as the frustrating amount of clothing they seemed to routinely wear.
and Castiel is helpless to deny him. In a moment his fingers are slicked and pressed up against him, adding hints of pressure when Dean moans.
“Yeah, you’re probably right.” Dean agrees.
He finds a small nub hidden in the feathers and tentatively presses his fingers against it, pulling an all new, utterly destroyed sound from his lover’s lips. Listening to Cas was even more intoxicating than kissing him. It was like he was high, soul soaring somewhere beyond his body trying to catch the noises that floated away from him. When he pulls his fingers away from the nub, he notices they’re wet.
“I love you.” Castiel confessed, standing in front of Dean’s pushed back chair. The air was electric, charged with everything they’ve felt for years.
“I am an Angel of the Lord, boy,” Castiel grinds out, reveling a little selfishly in the way the man starts to tremble, “and you have just incurred the wrath of Heaven.”
It was far too cold to be out. Breath puffs in compact clouds that fly away from their lips and dissipate into the darkness above them. They shouldn’t be here; they
“It saved us; saved me. It felt right.” he replies, an easy smile dancing on his lips.
Dean grumbles at the canned food this time, telling Castiel how he’s going to be sure to take them for a real meal as soon as they get back into town. He asks if it’s a date, and though Dean turns away, cheeks tinted a lovely pink, he says it is.
“Guess we didn’t get so lucky, huh?” Dean says, pulling Castiel’s awed attention away from the growing sheet of white.
“Please Cas, fuck,” he panted, “I’m close Cas, please, may I?”
“Yes, Dean?” He tries not to look, tries to keep his eyes on the fire and away from the burning pull of Dean’s skin.
of you. Before you, I was like every other Angel, unfeeling and doubtless; but you, just being near you gave me the freedom to love. I would have never known what love could feel like if it wasn’t for you. So yes, Dean, I love you. I love you more than the fall of Autumn leaves, and if you asked me to, I would leave everything behind to stay by your side. You are love, Dean, and I am love because of it.”
The woman smiles again. “If you had a town myth that actually kept rowdy children out of the forest, would
Castiel pauses, letting his eyes open back up to meet Dean’s - a mistake, truly, as the lovely summer green of his irises are visible even in the dim of the room.
“Then what do I do?” he asks again. He’ll do whatever Dean asks, but he won’t let him die. If there’s no other way, he’ll heal him and let him be pissed.
“All ready to order?” She asks, her singsong voice keeping the air light.
“Cas!” comes Dean’s voice, labored and shaken. Castiel doesn’t waste a moment looking at the ground and just follows the sound. Dean’s shouts for him grow more frantic as he gets closer and - is that water?
Heaven is an angel falling in every way imaginable. Heaven is love and lust, sin and blood. It is the soft kiss from the one you love after healing hands pull you apart. Heaven is a motel room in rural Illinois. But most of all, Heaven is the two of them, bound by fate and destinies discarded. There’s simply nothing better than this.
“Cas, if you don’t fuck me right now, I’m not gonna last. Please, Cas- “ A sharp intake of breath cut him off as Castiel pulled out and pushed back in one more time. “
He wants to snap their clothes off, to touch Dean right this instant, but he also wants to savor this, to draw it out and watch Dean squirm and beg. Castiel straightens back up and first discards his trench coat. Dean swallows hard as the suit jacket follows into the growing pile on the floor.
“Whatever you want, Dean.”
All five of the missing people are seated at the booth at the other end of the diner. Castiel’s jaw just drops.
Castiel takes him in again, lips wrapped tightly as he moves. His moan is desperate, close to an edge Castiel wants to hear him tip over. He wants to taste him on his tongue; wants to feel Heaven’s greatest weapon be undone in the mouth of his own tainted divinity.
“Fuck-” Dean breathes, sharp. His hand flies to tangle in Castiel’s hair, guiding his lips around his cock. Castiel hums around him as Dean nearly falls apart. He’s trying to keep himself still, to not fuck into Castiel’s throat, but Castiel just takes him deeper. He can feel him at the back of his throat and at Dean’s next moan he pulls off, leaving him shining and covered in saliva, to lap at the tip.
He grins.
The drive is less enjoyable than the last two, lasting much longer and with no real destination to look forward to. Castiel shifts in his seat ever so slightly and is thankful that Dean fails to notice. Being cramped up in a vehicle when his wings were usually spread out was not pleasant, but he would continue to keep that to himself. Manifesting them would only make it worse, wings corporeally tucked behind him would undoubtedly be
“What do you want, Dean?” he asks as the tie finally falls from his fingertips to the floor. Dean’s eyes watch it land before snapping back up to meet his own. His lips are parted beautifully, shallow breaths escaping in short bursts.
“C’mon Cas, don’t hold out on me now.” Dean laughs. It’s a sweet laugh; cute, but not what Castiel wants to hear, so he waits. He keeps the pressure at his rim, pumping himself slowly while he watches Dean’s wide eyes.
Castiel was left to his own thoughts in the kitchen, only Dean’s half empty beer bottle to accompany him. The tightness in his chest was almost unbearable now. Dean hadn’t lied about loving him, he couldn’t have. Castiel was pretty sure he had liked the kiss as well if those sounds were anything to go by. So why had Dean seemed upset? If that’s at all what that was; there was no way to be sure.
Cas runs his fingers over Dean’s chest, soft circles trailing over newly sealed skin. His wings are gone now, back in their own realm Dean isn’t privy to and he realizes something. He places his hand over Cas’s to stop the movement, a swelling feeling in his chest overtaking him. His heart was racing and Cas must have felt the shift because he’s looking up at Dean through his lashes, ocean eyes searching his own.
“Does that mean something?” Castiel asks, hiding his knowing smile against Dean’s throat. He feels Dean’s heartbeat pick up under his lips and scrapes his teeth along his pulse point to feel him shiver in his hands.
“I want-” he cuts himself off to whine as Castiel moves back against him, holding his squirming hips against the wall. “I want you to-
“I did what I had to do, Dean. You are alive and that is all that matters to me.” Castiel is aware of how that sounds, but Dean is in his arms and his fingers are but inches from sensitive feathers and Castiel can’t find it in him to take any more steps back from this. Whatever Dean wanted he would hand over in a heartbeat.
They sit by the fire until the colour comes back to their features and the feeling returns to their fingers. They sit together, Dean with the blanket around his shoulders, until the sun no longer peeks through the dusted windows.
“You know I -mm -ly, I really li -mm -im. I can’t help that I’m in lo -mm.” Dean was trying so hard to stop himself now it was beginning to get painful to watch. His face was so red and his fingers were white from the pressure he was putting over his mouth. He kept going, though by this point his hand was so tight over his lips, Sam couldn’t make out a single word. He wanted to laugh, tease his brother about how much he had to say about the topic of Cas, but he figured it better to just go ahead and follow through on calling him. So, he returned that slight upturn of an evil grin and walked out of the kitchen, leaving Dean behind to talk to himself.
Castiel wants to hold him, to press desperate kisses into his chilled skin, to apologize and risk losing him to prove to Dean he was wrong. But keeping him alive is more important, so he keeps pulling him, dragging him over the ice and back onto land. When they’re away from the water, Dean’s breathing gets louder.
“Dean, please.” he started, daring to meet Dean’s eyes from across the table. “Don’t say anything you’ll regret.”
“Well, the sun's up now. I think that the morgue ought to be opening soon. Breakfast before bodies?” Dean questions, a hint of hope in his tone. He knows Castiel doesn’t eat; just like he knows he could never tell him ‘no’.
“Do what? Want to leave? I said it was okay, Cas I get it. I-”
A flash of panic comes over the demon’s face before it reels itself back in. It must know it’s done for, that at this point there’s no winning. Cas has managed to kill the other three all on his own but he knows Cas won’t step in for this one unless Dean really needs it. The demon grits their teeth and charges at him again, astonishingly managing another cheek-shattering blow to Dean’s face. Blood drips from several lacerations on his face and body now but it’s less painful than before. He can feel the break of skin over his broken ribs, the deep, deep gash in his thigh, the torn edges of his face and knuckles, but there’s a gleaming lust for the kill in his eyes now and despite taking another few blows for good measure, Dean smiles through it.
. The innate desire they both have been stamping down for years. “If you don’t want this, tell me right now. If I touch you for one more second I’m going to rip these clothes off of your body before you can catch your breath. So tell me right now, Dean, do you want this?” Cas’s voice is firm, demanding of respect, but also low and grumbly, threatening to shake just from the struggle of holding in the lust. It made Dean want to come in his pants right there.
“Everything?”
“Hey, Dean?” he started, settling back against the wall and tilting his head in feign innocence, “If it’s cool with you, I think I’ll call Cas first.” The mention of Castiel seemed to make his brother stand up straighter and he noticed the change in his grip on the bottle. Sam’s smirk only grew as he continued on. “If I’m going to get anything done with Rowena on this, I need to be sure you’re not going to bother us. I’m sure Cas can keep you company.”
Dean stills, throat working overtime to come up with a response. Castiel just gets up from the bed, leaving him to fumble over his words as he searches for lube. He knows Dean keeps some in his bag, there were a few times he had snooped through their belongings out of curiosity and he was all the more thankful now, prize in hand, that he had been so nosey all those years ago. He crawls back up onto the bed, settling between Dean’s parted legs.
Castiel picks up the pace, ignoring each shifted pile of snow in favor of the prints pressed firmly into the ground.
Castiel nods; even if he had to wait a lifetime for that, he would. Whatever Dean gives him is more than enough, but there is one thing he wants. “Let me taste you.” He says, watching Dean’s eyes as they flutter closed. It’s a question, despite his format. He wouldn’t move an inch unless Dean wanted him to.
“Wha-? How did you-?” Comes the scratchy voice of the man in charge. Dean huffs by his side, a mere few steps in front of him, and Castiel starts looking for an escape. Unfortunately, the crowd in the barn decide escape is not an option.
Snow still falls, quickly trying to cover up the tracks that Dean left only minutes before. He couldn’t have gotten too far. Not that fast. Castiel is only minutes behind him - surely he’ll catch up.
“I, uh- no?” Castiel hears Dean clear his throat, feels him settle in just a little bit closer. They were always so much closer these days. Castiel prefers it that way, if he is honest. Though he shouldn’t, he quite often finds his mind wandering into uncharted territory, to Dean. He remembers how it felt to piece this man together, to hold his soul in his then-burnt palms, to sew together the fabric of him. He remembers the lengths he went to to assure each freckle was in the right place and how he had been unable to refrain from leaving a piece of himself with Dean when he returned him to the living. As often as he remembers Hell, so too does he think of the now, of the future. So badly does he want, yet always he denies himself even the thought of what it would be like to truly see him again. Dean’s soul was pure, brighter than the sun that kept this solar system in its orbit. Dean was breathtaking; he was the essence of beauty itself, the very core of everything he himself found holy. Nothing could ever compare to his divinity.
