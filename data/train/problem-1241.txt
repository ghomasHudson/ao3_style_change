It's a once in a lifetime opportunity, to closely study the effects he has on another's blooming. He takes meticulous notes whenever a new bud appears, or petals open or close. He hasn't seen any of the blossoms actually drop, hasn't even noticed any of them gone missing after a shower or sleep or day spent apart. He gives each stem an alphanumeric designation, and refuses to think of it as "naming them".
"What happened to 'amazing'?" John protested, rapidly regathering his wits.
Sherlock swallowed heavily and attempted to come back online.
"Should've written you another card," John mutters, then gives himself a quick shake. He shores himself up, setting his shoulders and firming his jaw, then takes a steadying breath and overturns Sherlock's reality like it's a shoddy balsawood table.
“C-  ca- ca-” Sherlock was near to hyperventilating while shaking his head -  shaking from head to toe in fact - and John began inching toward panic  at this completely unexpected turn the conversation had taken.
Standing just outside the tub, John gets to work on every bit of Sherlock that can't be easily reached, which ends up being most of him. Even the short walk from bed to bath has taken its toll, and the exercises he's been participating in have kept him limber but not done anything toward regaining muscle tone. Sherlock finds that he can wash his arms, torso, groin, and upper thighs - with small breaks in which to rest - but that getting a foot up to scrub at will take too much exertion.
84. I should like to nibble on your fingers some time when we're on the couch, watching telly (oral fixation, you know)
“What a day…” he muttered, and fell back into the couch  cushions with one arm thrown across his eyes. “I want…oh hell, what I  honestly, truly want is to eat disgustingly greasy noodles with scalding  hot tea, and then to be cuddled and petted while I stare at some  uninteresting documentary or nature program on the telly and try to I  forget for a few hours that I can’t save everyone who walks into my exam  room.”
Later, Sherlock had thought a thought.
about it; who the bloody hell could even compete?!”
"Upset, but not at you," John says, rubbing his thumb slowly across a sharp cheekbone. "It's just a painful thought, is all, and I'm sorry you had it. Thank you for telling me, though. I am very, very glad you did."
, but surely John has seen enough of Sherlock's body to take a decent guess at his measurements, no matter where he falls on the "show or grow" scale?
After the guests depart, Sherlock is ravished on a lounge chair, in the shower, and again in bed by a rather jealous John, and privately decides to barge in on "Boys' Night" more often.
, just, um...my reply to your note, is what I should've said." He pauses to make sure Sherlock is breathing properly again, and then shakes his head ruefully.
Reservations! Ha! He has none, not anymore. He's finished,  he's succeeded, and now he's going to see John. It's going to be fine. Everything is going to be fine, all fine. He's giddy with relief and drunk on hope.
Partner? Also technically true, but it was so even Before. There needs to be a better word for it, for him, for them; one that encompasses not just the work they do together, but everything else.
Everything grew easier after that first experiment.
"Yeah, I know, ridiculous," John sighed.
Sherlock has insulted John in almost every way possible. Lineage, career, achievements, stature...nothing is sacred. But John still stays, and John still blooms for him.
"I don't know," is as good as he can come up with, in the end. Psychiatrists and psychologists and therapists of all types have had him under their care but never did him much good that he can recall. Then again, Sherlock had been bribed, coerced, and threatened into most of those appointments; there had been a distinct lack of engagement and effort on his end, to put it mildly.
dots that connected it all…
"You don't have to use past tense," Sherlock finds himself saying, superiority making him magnanimous. "I understand that it's not something you can just shut off, like gas and electric."
Nearly two thousand pounds out of John's pocket later, he demands to know what in the bloody hell he's paying for. When he's told that it's up to him to decide what he wants out of his care, John gets even more frustrated.
Sherlock drags their entwined digits closer so that he can press a kiss to John's knuckles, then settles their hands right where they are, over the right lobe of John's liver. His curls are given an answering peck, and then the story is picked back up in a more Watsonian fashion.
“Says here,” John read off his phone, “that when Donovan asked ‘where’s the boyfriend’ you said I was at the dentist’s.”
"The forecast calls for rain again, tonight," Mycroft mentions. "Do be sure to wrap up well, if you decide to nip out for some takeaway or a brief walk through the park."
He opens the next few boxes with a sort of blank determination, only taking just enough time to catalogue the contents before moving on.
Discussing the details of how Sherlock is to be publicly resurrected is where the discussion threatens to assume a distinctly pear-like shape. The basic strategy that Mycroft introduces is received well enough; private conversations with their chosen inner circle first, either all at once or in quick succession to avoid whispers and leaks, and then a press conference to alert the rest of the world. Once that is accomplished, the two men may freely venture out as they wish.
"No."
Congratulations on a job well done! At first, I was completely convinced of your sincerity. It wasn't until the firewall incident that I began to have any real suspicions, but soon after that, I began to think.
of what we have now; what you needed and I was  able to provide, all those years ago. And this is enough for me, at  least I tell myself so, over and over and over.”
"Hold on, you can't just jump out of the bed and into the tub," John says firmly. He's smiling but still it's more a command than a teasing scold, and Sherlock settles, half chastened, half champing at the bit. "Let me get a few things ready, and then I'll come back and help you up."
"So...ready for our next adventure?" John asks, all twinkling eyes and eager grin.
“Yep. That’s just when I’m worried you’ll get hurt or something. Mostly you just make me happy. And tea. You make me tea.”
"You're feeling better," John comments, when they've finally settled down into a mess of sweaty limbs, out of breath and too warm, and the button on John's denims pressing uncomfortably into Sherlock's hip bone but neither of them particularly motivated to untangle.
Tell me you love me while we're naked in bed together
Sherlock blinks, glances at his notecards still lying in the other man's palms as if to make sure that he had in fact given them to him, and then has to think.
"Why are you so calm and collected?" he complains, then lets his face crinkle up into a moue as John only chuckles at him. It was a serious question; the man's serenity strikes him as nearly preternatural.
This initial clarification-explanation-revelation is so stunning that it takes a good minute of fierce focus and mental review to even comprehend the rest of what John had said, not just acknowledge that noises are coming out of his mouth. He is offering Sherlock a return to the precious camaraderie that they had before, but also the option of becoming more.
John is quirking his eyebrows in a manner that means, "I am expecting a response and I am not getting it."
64.	Tell me I'm amazing

John turns in his seat, craning his neck at the commotion near the kitchens. There hasn't been a crash or scuffle, but there's something in the sudden flurry of voices that's raised his hackles. Mary calls his name, but he ignores her for the moment, narrowing his eyes at the way the diners nearest the hallway are exclaiming and gesturing. The manager fast-walks over with a sort of angry elegance, but then startles and whirls around, nearly tripping over his own feet.

he hungry?
Downsizing is both more and less complicated than John foresees. Solving crimes doesn't require Savile Row and he's got enough money that he doesn't care if the properties go for less than market value, but he finds himself unexpectedly conflicted that he a) has no idea how many staff he's got maintaining the places for him who may be facing unemployment and b) actually cares about this. He goes back and forth on the emotional sliding scale; feels happy to discover that he cares about what happens to people, realizes he's an arse for not having cared before, congratulates himself for growing up a bit, feels pathetic that he's still needing to take steps towards minimum basic requirements for being a decent human being at his age, and et cetera.
He gazes in stupefaction at having written the words down. At having the occasion to do so. The temerity. The hope. And then he frowns because the phrase is so pitiful, so worn out compared to what it's meant to convey. He gnaws at his bottom lip a while, and then expands on his opening sentence.
"I do," he finally forces himself to say, because John was
…watch him, bright and beaming and beautiful…
“…John?”
“I lied; I have one more question,” he mumbled into  Sherlock’s shoulder. “If I, um, if I promise to break things off with  Mary, can I move back in?”
“One YEAR, you cock!”
Sherlock is unwell. He’s uncertain of whether he is ill, injured, or poisoned, and that in and of itself confirms his less-than-stellar health. His mind palace is too far away to reach, no matter how hard he tries. Indistinct, hazy as through a fog, only ever a vague blur.
"Be careful, Sherlock. You know how Mummy worries."
He is panicking.
Sherlock decides to ring tech support.
(There's always something.)
"All done?" John's eyes are flicking curiously between the cards and Sherlock's slump back into the pillows.
Regards,
The pause stretches out so far as to be taken as an answer, and sturdy hands begin to press the cards back down and withdraw, spurring the body to action even if the mind is lacking in perfect resolve and readiness.
John giggles while gesturing grandly at the many scattered components of future experiments waiting to be designed.
“Six months!”
"What about becoming flatmates with a madman the day after we'd met?" John asks, grinning.
Sherlock Holmes may pride himself on never making guesses when it comes to the Work, but in emotional matters, he's far lazier. (Uncertain, unpracticed, and afraid.) And so naturally, he ends up making a rookie mistake;  gathering unfamiliar data, assuming he understands what it means, and then theorizing before the data set is anywhere near complete. He fills in knowledge gaps with deductive reasoning, and that might work if he were trying to posit a theory that could be applied to a generic cross-section of Londoners. But when trying to figure out one particular John H. Watson and how the man relates to one W. Sherlock S. Holmes, it's a modus operandi that's very much doomed to failure.
“Right, you’ve got your Work to keep you happy.” John nods along in Sherlock’s right armpit. It tickles a bit.
28.	Dig your thumbs into my lower back and rub in small circles

, damn it!"
“I  am open to experimentation,” Sherlock replied tersely, after a short  sigh and audible grinding of his teeth. “Based on the results, I would  be willing to negotiate and perhaps expand my definition of what is and  is not ‘my area’.”
It strikes him, just before he settles into the task, how glad he is to have woken up wrapped firmly in John's presence. The idea of his feelings being reciprocated has been a dream so long desired and yet despaired of; a few kisses and a declaration is not enough to destroy a hopeless yearning that's had years in which to solidify. Had he woken up back in bed, and alone, he might have worried that the entire day had been a dream. Even now, with his head pillowed on John's shoulder and John's heartbeat steady under one palm, he is fluttering back and forth between something like giddiness and stunned disbelief.
"Mrs. Hudson's on holiday with an old friend, also courtesy of Mycroft. Not sure who or where actually; like I said, couldn't be arsed about the details. Spot on with the mold in C, and they're actually doing a renno, not just banging on pots to sound busy. Maybe there're some construction blokes mixed in with security, or some of the agents are handy with a hammer? Dunno, quite frankly don't care. As for me, I've had a little crisis and am off in the hills somewhere, hiking and trying to find myself or some bollocks like that."
the reasons? Er…Jesus this sounds stupid but…basically I’m asking if you’re in love with me. Um. At all.”
“You’re  beautiful. I could watch you play forever.” And then, to forestall any  doubt of his meaning, John added, “I love watching you play. I love  watching you, period. You’re always beautiful to me, whether you’re  scribbling notes or in your Mind Palace or picking the celery out of  your cashew chicken.”
"It's all right. I understand, really. You don't have to apologize." John sandwiches the clinging fingers on his forearm with his unrestrained hand and smiles, kind and caring. But Sherlock is already shaking his head at the very first syllable, and the only reason he allows John to get the entire ridiculous, fallacious, baseless reassurance out is that there's still some mysterious obstruction clogging up his throat.
"Hold on a mo'," he says hastily, and heaves himself off the couch, to Sherlock's chagrin. He curls his fingers tight atop the blanket, the almost-touch prickling along the backs of his hands.
Once he's patted dry and deodorized and his dressings deemed intact, Sherlock laboriously climbs into pants and pyjamas and lets John wrap him in a robe and two pairs of socks as well. He begins perspiring a bit, but decides it's better than risking a chill or muscle cramps.
“We drank from the wrong vials,” Sherlock blurts. “The neutralizers are still in the centrifuge.“
"Not ready yet?" John asks, unknowingly summarizing the thoughts whirling about under dark curls. It's quietly, softly asked, but Sherlock still startles, making John's curious, inquiring expression edge over into concern.
2.	Kiss me again, with your head tilted the other way
Sherlock perks up.
He becomes aware of his legs again when they buckle, and remembers the caning when he fetches up clumsily against the wall. The pain of burst stitches gives him some clarity, and he manages to shake his head when a staffmember stops in concern, asking...asking something. It must be in English but for some reason Sherlock can't parse it. He slides inelegantly down to the floor and tries to deduce the reason for a sudden shriek. He thinks that's the sort of thing he used to be interested in.
5. Kiss my neck, just over my jugular vein
"A bit..." Sherlock begins, and gets all the more fussed when he can't come up with a proper description of how he feels. Every word he can think of - discomposed, unsettled, uncertain - sounds too negative for the gift he was given, and finally he settles on a tentative "...off balance?"
They share a conspiratorial grin, and Sherlock wants to jump on every bit of furniture in the room while hollering his glee at having such a perfectly pugnacious and pugilistic protector. Or at the very least, he wishes he was strong enough that the mere thought of doing so doesn't make him want to lie down. He settles for mourning aloud that Mycroft's no doubt had all the footage destroyed, and delights in the snicker it draws from his knight in woolen armor.
John stutters to a halt, lifts his head out of his hand to look at the armful of Sherlock he's got now, knelt between his legs and collapsed into his lap and muttering something into the folds of his jumper.
(John
Greg bows out on the grounds that he's already committed himself body and soul by virtue of working as John's head of security, and has nothing left of himself to give. Also he's not sure he can think of anything that will top Dan's loudly declared willingness to stop by the office whenever John needs his cock sucked.
have done something (terrible? wonderful?) to John, and it keeps taking Sherlock's breath away. Instead of knee-jerk reactions and emotion-fueled decisions, there are carefully considered, measured responses being given him that Sherlock feels in no way deserving of.
Please find enclosed a flash drive which you and Mycroft may find relevant to your interests.
He might succeed, and not being able to predict outcomes makes Sherlock a bit uneasy.
When he shuts the doors to his Mind Palace and opens his eyes, it's with an unexpected weariness, as if the work he'd done had made use of his muscles as well as his memory. He's actually tempted to let his eyelids slip shut again so that he can resume napping, but John is sitting by the bed, forearms resting on his knees, hands clasped, and steely blue eyes fixed on Sherlock's face.
(See the end of the chapter for
(My request?)
What if John met a buxom heiress?
6. Kiss my jaw
"Married to your work, you said, and I was already...I mean we'd just met but...it stung, more than it should've. So I always made sure I responded first after that, whenever anyone mistook us for more than friends. Always jumped to make it clear that we weren't. I didn't want to have to hear it again, d'you see?"
J: ...
Instead of letting him have the last word, John snatched up the argument and stomped right after him. The twists and turns of this conversation were a bit beyond him, but he remembered one thing at least; Sherlock was wrong and he was right.
This is...this is intolerable, that John Watson should have ever felt this way even once, that Sherlock had perhaps had a hand in making him feel small or unworthy. He wants to destroy everyone who ever dared to sneer down their noses at this man and also abase himself at John's feet to offer worship.
Some things have changed. They only have to dodge CCTV cameras (and sometimes the Met), because John no longer has a security detail. He also doesn't have to miss out on any interesting cases for work, which is good. This gives the two men many more opportunities to get on each other's nerves, which is not as good. John still storms out sometimes, but he's getting better at checking his temper before it can master him, and Sherlock has learned to keep his mouth shut and give his companion a minute when he grinds out from behind clenched teeth that he needs one.
"It's nothing," he eventually answers, getting back to the topic at hand. "Just trying to acclimate myself. Or rather, I am attempting to acclimatize. I suppose it's more accurate to say that I am adjusting to the entirely new realm of a romantic relationship, rather than adjusting to the addition of kissing to our existing partnership."
“Would you rather I didn’t marry Mary? Don’t correct my grammar; just…just nod or shake.”
"Well done, Sherlock," Mycroft says quietly, which is surprising enough. But he gives Sherlock a subtle but genuinely proud smile and glances at the folder, but then at John as well, and it sinks the younger Holmes into a flustered silence.
"No surprise there, considering. Right, well, finish that, take a nap, and then I'll wake you for lunch," John replies.
"Stylist?"
"Three months later and I've got a table booked at the Landmark and a ring in my coat pocket," John says, and the lopsided smiles have melted away now, leaving behind tight lines of remorse etched 'round his mouth. "She was the best thing to happen to me since I lost you. And it wasn't just gratitude; I did love her, at least as much as I could. I wanted to make her happy."
"They don't, at least not in the way you're clumsily implying. My work and methods are interesting, and John's enough of an arsehole himself that my personality doesn't put him off, is all. We get on quite well, really."
It feels like they're reaching for each other.
"Why's that?"
Sherlock takes stock both physically and mentally - his emotional status is pushed hastily aside for now, too tangled and messy to sort out at a moment's notice - while raising himself up to a less spinally taxing position. John is perched near him; no longer pressed close, but not so far away as he'd been directly after the shower, either.
56.	Borrow my shampoo and conditioner so that you smell like me (the condition of your hair will be improved as well; it's a bit dry at times)
“Anyone with tits and a heartbeat!” Sherlock sneered, and then shouldered rather rudely by on his way to his bedroom.
The detective could have been stroppy and selfish and demanding and dangerous, and the blogger would have given back just as good as he got. Friends could have invaded each other's personal space and flatmates could have declared war on each other's habits and hangups. But they are too wounded and weary just now to bear what had passed for normalcy between them.
“Will  this do for now?” he asked, faux-nonchalant, and aggressively forced  himself into the corner that John was still half-occupying.
72.	Let me use your arm as a pillow
Sherlock blinks, spiraling thoughts and emotions jolted off to the side, leaving him only puzzled for a moment. John looking unperturbed but for some mild impatience is not one of the potential outcomes he's considered. (Fever dream? Structural damage to the Mind Palace? Alternate universe?)
Finally released from their house arrest, they'd indulged in fresh air and takeaway in an empty corner of Regent's Park, whispering in the shadows and scurrying from cover to cover in an exaggerated game of hide and seek whenever someone began to wander too close. They'd tossed their empty containers in a convenient skip down a random alley and then had a delicious snog against a brick wall for afters. And then they'd walked home, bounded upstairs giggling, and stared at each other in the living room...had stared and stared and stared, breathing hard and smiling uncontrollably, until something inside Sherlock had snapped and sent him crashing into John's arms, kissing the man like he'd never get another chance.
They prefer to text.
His favorite variation is when he's lying in bed, head pillowed on John's arm, with both hands wrapped around John's free hand while they trade kisses until one of them falls asleep.
The last thing he remembers with any real clarity is how comfortingly warm John is, how lovely to wrap around, like a hot water bottle except filled with grief and guilt. After that it's a jumble of surreal nightmares weaving themselves in and out of the terrifying ordeal of discovering that he's got two older siblings who are smarter than he is. He wonders at his parents for having the courage - or temerity - to conceive him.

“Here, let’s get you sat up a bit and I’ll get you some water. Your mouth’s probably all cotton and crust.” John is competent and calm, supporting him this way and that and tucking extra pillows behind his back (prickle of stitches, the dullness of thick dressings and the pull of adhesive tape, an unpleasant tightness and itching from wounds already closed and drying). John flicks the IV line, taps thoughtfully at the monitor, and then sits on the edge of the bed, leaning over to pick up a glass that’s sitting ready on the bedside table.
"What?!"
But before he can do anything, before he can even draw breath for a whimper, John pulls away and to the side, buries himself in the crook of Sherlock's neck and heaves out a lung-emptying sigh. It's warm and damp and under any other circumstances would ride the line between curious and unpleasant. As it is, he finds it intimate and comforting. Without much thinking about it, he releases his fistfuls of John's shirt and wraps the man in a firm hug, mirroring the one he himself is enveloped in.

“Right, here’s what’s going to happen,” John declares, pulling the glass away when Sherlock turns his head slightly from the next offered sip. “I’m going to give you a very brief update on the past few weeks–
He calls it patience, instead of fear.
Fade is a natural product of bloom, and it shouldn't hurt, except that Sherlock exerts such tight control over his affections that they rebel against him in their own way. The vines are thin and the foliage unobtrusive, but the roots run thick and deep and snarling. The more petals he rips away, the more his skull aches.
John takes a freezing cold shower to wake himself up while forcing himself through twenty sets of a breathing exercise to calm himself down, apologizes to a wide-eyed housekeeping staffmember when he finds her already sweeping up the aftermath of his temper tantrum, and then calls Dr. Hughes.
"Sherlock Scott Holmes."
Thank you for your patience, dear readers.

.  And it makes me feel alive too, just being by your side. But I also  love watching you when you’re calm.

"One thing I have never lacked, Mrs. Hudson, is confidence," he says dryly, but she piffs and flaps her hand dismissively.
Mycroft rather looks like John's suggested that the government functionary pop out of a cake whilst wearing a spangly sash that reads "Sherlock's alive!".
There are parts of the list that John cannot do aught about until Mycroft releases them from lockdown and recalls Mrs. Hudson from her vacation, but Sherlock goes ahead and relays them anyway.
, real, not a dream) and guiding him to drink.
"No change from this morning. The pain is still at a two, and I was careful not to overextend my shoulder..." He trails off as he notices John shake his head. Had he misunderstood the question somehow?
“I'll  just take that as a ‘no’, shall I?” the detective sniffed, turning back  to his phone with an offended air, though apparently unwilling to put  in the effort of actually flouncing away in a snit.
“Because of course people wouldn’t be able to simply quaff a full dose of each neutralizer all at onceJohn
Sherlock's heart rate is still elevated and there's no hiding the slight sweat still gleaming upon his skin, but he's got his breathing under control at least, and in front of Mycroft is not how he wants to decompress and debrief. He gives John a simple nod and smile, and while it's not entirely convincing, it's good enough for the moment.
(Yours.)
Locked together as they were, Sherlock  couldn’t actually nod or shake his head, and John was probably squeezing  him too tight for speech to boot, but the detective shuddered and  sobbed and hugged him back, and that was good enough for the moment.
Sherlock screamed into the Union Jack cushion.
"So," Sherlock says with a tentative nod at the tidy stack. "Am I meant to read those, or listen?"
at me like they were wondering why I was there, and my pride -
John rubs his leg with a few grumbles and Sherlock slowly stretches out his back, reveling in the fact that he can do so without any alarming twinges or spasms. The only ongoing issues that significantly limit him are nerve pain in his shoulder and the need to get back into fighting form, and those simply require more time and cardio to sort out.
53.	Take a bath with me
While dinner is cooking, Sherlock has tea, John opens a beer, and they trade smiles across the stretch of floor every time John has to retrieve something from the refrigerator or turns to the kitchen table for a sip of Guinness. Egg noodles drain and the chicken finishes up in the pan as John helps Sherlock to the loo and back, and then they collaborate in engineering a pile of pillows and cushions optimal for back and hip support while viewing a movie together.
John breaks the silent exchange of stares with tea and accompanying cakes and inane chat. Milk and sugar, slices and forks; John dutifully small-talks his way through the entire ceremony of playing the good host, and the Holmes brothers cautiously draw nearer each other as the meeting begins.
“I may have made a slight–”
John bolts out of his chair.
I’m so sorry. I didn’t  know what it was like to really lose someone who was so much of my life.  But I know now and I know it’s too late and you’re so angry but John
"Oh," he blurts in realization and relief.
“Yes you are! But drugs are bad, Sherlock.” John is smiling up at him but trying to frown at the same time, which makes him look rather constipated.
Sherlock nods, then listens and fidgets, more delighted than he thought possible at this very simple next step in his recovery. The offer of a proper wash seems like a door thrown open; just a few feet of space in and of itself but promising an entire world more. If he can get up - with assistance - and take a shower, that means no more round-the-clock bedrest. No more bedpans, no more getting rolled this way and that to avoid bedsores, no more being manipulated through endless repetitions of passive exercises and getting wiped down with as little interaction as if he was still unconscious.
John absently scrolls back through his text history with Doctor Hughes. Though the messages seem sparse and scattered, as most of John's appointments have presumably been by phone or video call, there's enough for John to fall into a bit of a reverie. Sherlock wants to offer the standard penny rate for some thoughts, but his mouth is full of bread and cheese and garden stuffs at the moment. Choking on a drool-damp chunk of bread or slobbering bits of tomato onto the table would be highly unpleasant and might put John off of kisses for the afternoon, and that is just not on.
"Oi, I've kept you fed," John protests as he sets their lunch down on the coffee table.
And while Sherlock is certainly not looking to groom the man into anything more than whatever it is he already is, he's self-aware enough to admit that he's more tactile with John than anyone else. The consulting detective drags John everywhere, not just by dashing off and expecting the other man to follow, but literally by the wrist, the elbow, a bit of sleeve pinched beween fingers.
"Well, I've shaved it off obviously," John snorts.
"Humor me," he says, with a sigh that  seems heavy with years of disappointment. His tone somehow combines a  plea, a command, and a decree that it shall be. "My full name is  Gregory..."
Later that night, he drinks a light dinner and lays himself out on a couch because his bed is too empty and cold, and hopes Dr. Hughes is good at his job.
John swore and bolted up and over, grabbing (
In a contradictory fit, Sherlock finds himself seized with the urge to ask for something absolutely outrageous, just to see how far and wide John's "whatever" stretches. (Let's move to France tomorrow; we'll grow lavender and keep bees and raise chickens, and you have to kiss me good morning and good night every day until one of us dies of old age. I'll gather honey and learn to make scones, and if I get stroppy you can make me eggy toast and thus remind me that you are to be appreciated.) With a frown and huff, he forces himself to take the self-prescribed smallest of small steps, promising himself more if only he'll be patient.
” Sherlock finally cried, gripping at John in turn. “I can’t, I
Sherlock stared, then shut his mouth when he realized it had dropped open. (His transport was getting quite unruly.)
Sherlock's first instinct is to scoff and sneer and reply in the negative. He's grateful, now, for the half-masticated bite of sandwich keeping him mum. He forces the food down and overcomes the instinctual urge to react defensively, and tries to think of how to answer honestly.
The toast is unbuttered and there's little enough salt on the egg resting atop it that Sherlock could probably count the crystals if he could be arsed to wait a minute, but the first bite is still a religious experience. Once he's sunk his teeth into it, he has to close his eyes and stop everything - even chewing - to let a wave of gratitude wash over him.

Or perhaps they're already three years into their romance, but only just now learning to celebrate it together.
Sherlock crams two biscuits into his mouth and glares.
“Take  your time,” he offers, moving one hand from its fistful of dressing  gown to comb soothingly through dark curls instead. “I’ll be right here  when you’re ready.”
= = = = =
But the hand persists and pursues, and only checks his temperature. There’s a brief, barely-there caress of his curls and a faint memory stirs, of being small and sick and scared.
“Nothing,” came the muffled, alarmingly stuffy-nosed reply.
This admission puts John in much the same state, and Sherlock regrets the loss of eye contact as the other man coughs and rubs at his neck, as if it's a muscle twinge that's bothering him instead of embarrassment. It's more a reflex than a retreat, however, and soon enough John's gaze is fixed on him again, steady and sure. The brave soldier.
It's too much.
"Thank you," John interrupts, in a tone that's expressing "shut up Sherlock" much more than actual gratitude. (He's missed even that.) "And no you're not. This is fine, Sherlock. More than."
As his wounds continue to heal, more and more dressings are thrown away but not replaced, and Sherlock keeps a pleased tally as the days go by. The regular plasters, gauze squares, and protective films must have been permanently peeled away while he'd been sedated, and now he only has a few silicone sheets taped across the burns on his back.
The warmth of John's hands on his wrists. "Asking as your friend."
Sherlock wrinkles his nose, though it's tempered by a smile. The happiness to be found in being silly together is quite ridiculous. He's turned into a sentimental sop and does not give one good God damn about it.
Once he'd grabbed a fistful of collar but it had triggered a fight reflex in John, and Sherlock had been forcibly reminded that he was dealing with a military man not yet out of his prime.
The few minutes turned  into rather a lot of minutes, as they let a heavy sort of silence creep  over them both, broken only by Sherlock’s hitching breaths and scattered  sniffles. They both held one empty glass each, and sat knee to knee on  the sofa, staring at nothing.

"Clara only gave your sister three kisses," he notes.
"What do you mean why?! I'm the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company; people are constantly throwing themselves in my path to kiss my arse, and here I am, looking around and hoping someone'll come and be my friend like some snotty year one just transferred in!"
. Prides himself on it, in fact. And while he has possibly shagged more people than he'd ever hurt or healed in Her Majesty's service, he has never nor will he ever commit adultery.
John had no speeches  planned, he’d not dreamed of this moment. But he couldn’t have fought  his way through all the battlefields of his life without instinct, and  it served him just as well in peacetime as it did in war. He knew what  Sherlock was asking, and knew what Sherlock needed to hear.
Mrs. Hudson minds their daughter so they can indulge in gnocchi and wine. John takes his hand at Angelo's, kisses him in the park, and when he's got Sherlock pinned to the bed, whispers,
)  the window quite badly, there. Some few social gatherings with whatever  other groomsmen John wished would have to be organized, and of course  the penultimate event; the stag do. He felt himself come back to life a  bit at the thought of getting John fitted for a proper suit and walking  him through all of the options of style and cut and how silk hugged and  wool hung. He lingered a bit over the thought of a sensuously soft  cravat nestled under John’s chin, then moved on to the need to  coordinate colors with the florist, who would also need to be someone he  could entrust with the decoration of the church, where he would stand  just behind and to the side of John, and…
"That's do-able," John agrees, looking relieved. Had he been anticipating the return of Stroppy Sherlock, and a demand for roast squab, a rich port, and a pack of Sterlings for pudding?
"Mm, no." Sherlock ponders topics while John pretends to be disappointed. He's not got much practice at this playfulness, and quickly gives up on formulating a funny suggestion. Asking himself what things he truly wishes to find out next about his John yields better - or at least more numerous - results.
"Didn't think you were," John replies good-naturedly. "But you'll get there eventually, and I was going to get condoms and lube anyway, since I figured we'd get
John let these thoughts chase each other merrily around in his mind while his pulse and breathing gradually slowed. Once he felt settled, though not entirely calm, he weakly tossed his phone onto the bed and sighed, hands on his hips.
John takes great satisfaction in painstakingly transcribing each of Sherlock's requests to its own index card. The cards also display the date each request was first fulfilled, and any notes he thinks to add.
Sherlock dismisses this with a fond scoff, doing nothing to stem the tide of heartfelt praise falling from his lips. John may as well enjoy it while it lasts; he cannot recall the last time he eulogized anyone in such a manner and it may never happen again. This is, in fact, a salient point. Sherlock is the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet. That John, the bravest and kindest and wisest human being he has ever had the good fortune of knowing, should not only stay long enough to be known, but also give Sherlock his loyalty and love...well. The languages that he knows are one and all too clumsy to properly express how he feels.
“No, silly silly John. I have the Work to keep me
Sherlock nods. Wonders what the protocol is for asking for another kiss. Is it like a formal meal, where you subtly signal a desire for seconds by clearing your plate instead of leaving one bite behind? Or is it more along the lines of supper parties, where the families take turns extending invitations?
Ever curious, Sherlock strains his eyes at the phone in John's hands as he casually reaches for another sandwich, trying to decipher the text John is composing. Instead of Marcus, now there's a group text called "Baker Street Brute Squad" on the screen, and John is requesting that Sherlock be provided with a new mobile, or at least a temporary one to use while they are sequestered.
“I already tested their interactions with each other and the chemicals were perfectly stable.”
Sherlock suddenly becomes religious, as he feels what must be his soul attempting to ascend out of his body. As soon as he is recovered, he is going to build a shrine, no, a temple, and dedicate it to the worship of one John Hamish Watson.
loved ones. I never stopped believing in you, and I never will. I never
"Am I now?" he asks, and pretends to fall upon Sherlock like a wild animal, all growls and nips, startling a laugh out of him that seems even louder for its unexpectedness. They tussle a bit, giggling and shushing each other, mindful of Mycroft's minions below them, and eventually sort the tangle of limbs and pillows and sheet-wrinkles out so that they're both comfortable.
He puts the puzzle aside for the time being, however, and nods to John's suggestion of tea and toast and yes, yes, you may have an egg on your bread. Even when the other man disappears into the kitchen, Sherlock stays put on the couch instead of attempting to get a peek at the papers. John's declaration of loyalties renewed is still too fresh, too dazzlingly new, for Sherlock to do otherwise than proceed on the same plan with his heart as he is with his digestive system; with extreme caution.
“Random stranger. Literally bumped into him at a gallery. He looked at me like he was looking at the art, and it wasn’t appreciative. Then he called me - what was it - a touch-starved, love-famished skeleton of a child hiding behind money, playing with lives because no one ever taught me to play with blocks.”
He seemingly
(Perhaps the back and forth rule applies to sessions of kissing, not individual kisses. Must research.)
[docent voice] And here we see Mycroft Holmes, who has already shown a penchant for meddling in Sherlock's affairs, now messing about with John's. Could his reluctance to allow John's employees into France merely be an older brother's protective instincts? Or could it have anything to do with the memory stick that Irene Adler-Halstead gave to him after she took a job with the DGSI? Who can tell? [/docent voice]
Eleanor Dunaway may be the one billing him four hundred and seventy-five quid per hour, but Martha Hudson is the one who manages to finally kick over John's basket of issues and make him start sorting the shit from the shine.
I know and my best friend.”
“Not anything,” Sherlock muttered, frowning and looking away now, fiddling with the cigarettes in his hand.
"Charming," Mycroft sighs. "I can see how you've managed to capture Mister Watson's gaze despite the glitterati littering his empire."
"Well nothing sounds good and I'm not fucking hungry," John snaps.
Sherlock quirked his eyebrows up and drew breath to speak.
24.	And honey
Like the wonderful breathlessness of being held tight in those sturdy arms. "I love you".
The John-you’re-being-disappointingly-ordinary “oh” only serves to ratchet up the tension in the room, and Sherlock attempts to diffuse it somewhat.
“He’s infuriating,” John continues, grinning idiotically despite himself. It’s fine; her office has blackout curtains and top of the line soundproofing, and he pays her well to keep his secrets.
“I’m so sorry John I’m
S: Too pedestrian? I coooouuuuld...um...cut you into some cocaine and snort you? I'd probably want to get high if I was grieving your loss.
"Let me phrase it a different way," Dr. Hughes says, still smiling that calm, serene, yoga and Xanax smile. "What does it matter?"
"Well, maybe all that was a bit heavy for afters, yeah?" John says, levity forced but not unnatural, and at his vague gesture Sherlock notices the notecards stacked neatly on the coffee table. No clue, no evidence, no carefully concealed motive has ever looked so enticing. His hand twitches toward them before he can stop himself.
"All right?" John asks, smiling still, keeping Sherlock anchored.
It would almost seem casual and careless, except for how insistently they keep seeking each other out again.
I gained access to your phone and made sure of who, what, when, where, and why. I probably shouldn't have risked sending you that text, but I couldn't resist teasing you a bit. Agent Halstead scolded me the whole way to the airport.
"Oh...love, no," John says, but Sherlock won't let him continue. Refuses to be drawn up into his lap, too; just wants to kneel at his feet and repent. So John slides down and joins him, presses kisses into his hair, and wraps him up in all the forgiveness and grace that he can't extend to himself.
He cut off his retroactively embarrassing rambling and  glanced up, only to find that his frown had transferred itself to  Sherlock’s brow. But instead of scathing sarcasm at all this romantic  dribble, John merely got a shrug.
51.	Light a fire, arrange a blanket nest in front of the fireplace, and spoon me in it
The living room is fully dark now; the telly off, the street quiet, and the sun still hours away from pressing hopefully against the curtains. John is a warm, solid presence from nose to kneecap, like a custom body pillow designed to keep Sherlock contentedly still. Wary of waking his living, breathing bolster, Sherlock keeps mum and motionless while deciding how to while away the time.
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
living here. Especially after reading through that file. All I could think about with any clarity, any calmness, was that I had to return that...that unimaginable devotion as best I could. And that meant coming back to you, instead of moving forward with Mary."
“Mm?”
"Doctor Watson, this is hardly--"
“Drugs are bad,” John intones.
. Today is a lifetime's worth of Christmases and locked room murders all come at once. He could live the next ten hours - perhaps more, maybe even a whole day - contented with only replaying those syllables in his Mind Palace, with the notecards cradled to his chest. But John keeps talking, and he has to quickly file the new soundbyte away so that he can pay attention.
"I hate that I did that to her. I still think I made the right decision. Stringing her along until she got fed up and dumped me wouldn't have made anyone happy. Bottom line though, is that she deserved better. My only excuse for the whole mess is I honestly thought you were gone."
John turns the list into a new project, getting the security team downstairs to procure him a recipe box for the archival of it. Sherlock's reply-to-a-reply-to-a-note is secured with an elastic band and given a place of honor at the front. After a moment of thought, Sherlock puts John's reply-to-a-note in there as well. They find a place for the box on a shelf in the (their?) bedroom, after some strategizing over where it is least likely to be blown up, accidentally knocked into a fire, shot, or splashed with chemicals.
John quirked an eyebrow at how Sherlock seemed to freeze in place, like a robot (
"As much as it would delight me to act for Doctor Watson in this matter," Mycroft interjects dryly, "I'm afraid it makes little sense for me to be co-hosting a holiday party with Mrs. Hudson. You do, after all, wish to ensure that everyone actually attends, and my extending the invitation hardly assures the success of such an endeavor."
Sherlock's echoing "obviously" is rather weak. He's still busy grimacing at every moustache he conjures up in his mental gallery, though he puts a pin in the scruffy beard look for later consideration. There's a soft sigh then, which draws his focus back up and away.
Priorities taken care of, John's manners reassert themselves, and he turns back to offer Mycroft a chair and a cup of tea. While John puts a tray together in the kitchen, the brothers pick each other over across the coffee table, light eyes darting this way and that, lingering over a wrinkle, sharpening over a fingernail. It's soothing in its own way, the ease with which they settle into this initial sortie even after all this time apart. After a few seconds, however, Sherlock finds himself collecting data merely for the comfort of finding Mycroft as familiar as ever he was, and not because he is searching for ammunition with which to arm himself. This discovery is made palatable by the nearly simultaneous observation that his brother's sharp gaze has softened, and that he seems to be simply enjoying the sight of Sherlock looking quite healthy and whole.
John ruminated on this and various tangential thoughts, and then blurted,
turned into fodder for a whole new array of jokes.
"Yours," Sherlock confirms. "All yours."
Some of the new blooms were Sherlock's, it seems.
fine. More than, in fact. You’re my best friend and a literal  life-saver and just…I don’t know what I’d do without you, Sherlock.  Really. And thank you, by the way, for the offer. For worrying. For  wanting to help.” John swiped a hand down his face, sighing into his  palm.
It's not the dreaded, dizzying, terrifying moment he'd once feared it would be. He trusts his knowledge of John - his observations and the reasonings built upon them, all the evidence and yes, now, his
so brilliant and caring and just...oh hell,
John's gone from unburdening himself to burning himself at the stake, so Sherlock wants to draw this session to a close. Or at least to redirect all this blame to where it belongs. Gone is his comfortable sense of security, the hubris that accompanies unexpected happiness; he recalls what sent John stumbling into Mary's arms in the first place, and is suitably chastened.
"Do I even have a phone?"
My apologies for the delay in getting this chapter up. I deleted and rewrote it so many times that at times I had to stop and re-read previous chapters to remind myself where I'd been going with all this. *headdesk*
"It's best not to brush curls. It make them all...well," Sherlock waves a hand at the frizzy pompom that his head has become. "Pat and scrunch with a towel, not scrub, and then I usually finger-comb some product in and let them air dry."
Being called
68.	Let me trace all the edges of your scars with my fingers
John asks, later, if that's all right. Sherlock boggles, then nods.
“The neutralizers will work! I know they will! I wouldn’t have been compromised at all, so I would have been completely capable of safely and effectively drawing a blood sample!”
"Inviting someone on your payroll over for dinner and debriefing probably doesn't count either, Sir," he notes. And then, because sincere efforts by emotionally stunted men should be rewarded no matter how pitiful they are, Greg offers assistance and advice. Probably the real reason he was invited, now that he thinks about it. The executive has advisors and solicitors and subject matter experts galore, but no one he's really close to.
The yoga, in particular, ensnares Sherlock in a complicated love/hate relationship. Something touted as soothing and meditative has no business turning out to be so arduous. He's always sweating profusely ten minutes into the session, and every pose that he wobbles and flails and falls out of only reminds him of how badly worn and weakened his body is.
"Does the list have orgasms on it?" John is grinning cheekily now and stroking a line down Sherlock's neck that leaves all sorts of delicious shivers in its wake.
They curl around each other, nosing and nudging into each other's curves and concavities, two puzzle pieces determined to lock together despite being mismatched. John takes his pulse and smells his hair and takes wet, tasting kisses from his neck, and Sherlock holds fast and lets him.
“Good,” John replies simply. “I love you too.”
to me. If there is
"Not...ready," Sherlock strangles out, opting for a hasty half-truth served with a side of misdirection. Even this little dishonesty sits uncomfortably in his chest, however. The habit of simple honesty has had time enough to sink in, and on top of this, John's wondrous, precious, miraculous note seems to lie heavy on his lap now, judging him severely for repaying the gift with such a craven spirit.
Back to normal.

John finds out more of Sherlock's requests.
John.
By  mutual and silent agreement, the intimacy experiment was kept private.  John didn’t presume outside the flat or when they had visitors, and he  didn’t notice Sherlock angling for anything during those times either.  But when it was just the two of them at Baker Street, Sherlock circled  him like a touch-starved cat trying to pretend aloofness, and John  indulged in going into all-out Infatuated New Boyfriend mode.
loved, and by John, but he couldn’t bear to have the declaration desecrated in such a way.

Sherlock glances to the side, blinking. He'd been prepared to argue this point down entirely on his own, and is pleasantly surprised to find the practical, pragmatic soldier so firmly on his side of the discussion.
(John is
38.	Run your hand up my calf
He hangs about Baker Street, helping Sherlock unpack and re-clutter the flat. Mrs. Hudson creaks her way upstairs at least once per day with some excess of baked goods of which John always forces Sherlock to eat a proper share. The blond also takes it upon himself to order meals in at appropriate times, as he cannot cook worth a damn and Sherlock refuses to even try. John can't easily forget the way the other man wolfed down food whenever they managed to meet up at hotels, and how it wasn't enough to keep him from wearing thin. Sherlock has always been on the slim side, but in the past year he's turned the corner of underfed and begun heading toward gaunt.
“I wish to experience  intimacy with someone that I trust and whose company I do not entirely  dislike, and compare my reactions and impressions with memories of  similar behaviors engaged in solely for the purpose of gathering data or  DNA evidence. With such proofs as I have witnessed over the years that  such pursuits are so rewarding as to inspire people to murder, well...I  posited that perhaps there was some catalyst or critical ingredient left  out of my experiences. Unfortunately my list of prospects is rather  short; I’ve narrowed it down to only you and Grant.”
There are a thousand and one ways he wants to answer this offer, but he's completely unprepared. His defenses were destroyed, and the ones he's been building have been guarding himself against hoping too much, presuming too far, and now John has ambushed him with devotion. Sherlock's nose stings in an alarming herald of tears, and to head off both the waterworks and panic, he quips,
There is nothing Sherlock can say to this. It doesn't take a consulting detective to deduce where John would be right now, had he never met Sherlock. It chills him to the very core to think of that fate only being deferred, not avoided entirely, had John not met Mary. Any ideas of being pettishly jealous of her are incinerated. Sherlock owes her everything, every grace and allowance and scrap of candor he can dredge up, because she had saved John.
"I'd gone back to work and at some point Mary'd been hired on as a nurse," John continues. "I honestly don't know when. And I must've spoken to her here and there, you know, good morning and thank you and what not, because when I finally lifted my head back up and looked around, there she was, smiling at me like she'd been waiting for me to get a joke.
The CEO takes a sudden interest in expanding the company's footprint, both in physical holdings as well as offerings. It's unexpected and rife with risk, but he presents the board of directors with a compelling profitability projection, and so rumors, announcements, and then responsibilities for the project and its related goals begin filtering their way down the organizational structure. The importance of the expansion is underlined by the CEO himself taking on all of the responsibility for scouting out potential sites and partners, handling every initial interview and meeting and survey himself, and only looping in his executive directors and vice presidents and all their various underlings once he's made up his mind one way or another.
He propped his chin on  one hand and wondered how long he’d have to wait before it would be  excusable to slip some ice cubes past Sherlock’s collar, then frowned  and straightened up as Sherlock…welled up and overflowed. It wasn’t  anything as energetic as crying; there were no sobs, no hiccups, no wild  gestures. But huge tears tumbled one after the other over Sherlock’s  cheeks, racing down his face and blobbing off his chin, fast as rain.
John rolls away, lies on his back facing straight up to the ceiling, but he also tugs Sherlock along with him and tucks the detective neatly into his shoulder. Settling in for a talk, then, and not any sort of avoidance technique. Sherlock wriggles closer and throws a leg over two delightfully sturdy thighs for comfort, and places one hand with artful casualness over John's chest, half for affection's sake and half for data gathering.
“It’s a seeecret~”
you want from me Sherlock, you don’t have to wish for it; it’s already yours.
108. I do love your eyes, however. Perhaps not the first time. Or first few times. Eventually I'd become acclimated, wouldn't I? Would I? But then...yes, I'd want that. Everything. Plus being able to gaze into your eyes.
John has to rush upstairs to grab a pair of shoes, because while most of his clothes have migrated into their shared bedroom, he hasn't had occasion for outdoors wear in some time. After he thunders back down the stairs, Sherlock sends him back upstairs with a laugh because he's forgotten a jacket, and then goes back to digging through cardboard boxes for a pair of trainers. The Belstaff is bypassed with some regret; it's comfortable and comforting, but all too familiar. He shrugs himself into a hooded windcheater instead, and then scoops up two scarves before heading back down the hallway.
been eventful and exhausting but he'd also spent a good portion of it napping, so after creating a new wing in his Mind Palace and meticulously archiving every new memory, Sherlock only manages a brief nap before rousing once more.
"John? What's wrong?" Sherlock keeps to the same whisper being used, though the room seems devoid of danger.
It's the rough, tremulous tone of the voice more than anything else that has Sherlock actively fighting his way out of somnolence. He rouses with a quick inhale and glances around the room, but nothing seems out of place. The remains of dinner are drying out on the table and the telly is still on, explosions rocking the scene but the volume down low. None of Mycroft's babysitter-bodyguards are present. John is still on the couch, not half out of his seat with his gun in one hand. (
Lover? Technically true, but somehow a bit too libidinous and limited a word for Sherlock's tastes. John is -
"And this is my partner, Sherlock," John says to a stranger cooing over Watson. He asks if that's all right, too. Sherlock hums yes.
John scowls and tells Marcus that it sounds like something out of a fortune cookie.
John gives him another one of those nudge-kisses and then retreats just far enough to ask what has to be the world's most superfluous question.
” John protested, latching on to the one bit of the conversation he felt sure of. “And I’d certainly never cheat on you! Never mind that you’d see it the moment I even
, damn it, and I also know it  all means that you’ve got this…this…beyond-belief capacity to feel  things and out of all the people in the world I should have known better  than to ever even
"I've, um...got some notes," John confesses. Sherlock eyes the cards curiously, finding them to indeed be a handful of index cards packed full of scribbles. The doctor's handwriting adheres to the adage but Sherlock can make out a few phrases beginning with "I".
Stupid Mycroft and his stupid traps.
“Listen,  kay?” he interrupted desperately. “Just listen. This may be the most important conversation you and I  ever have so pay attention, and…and be honest. Two questions; yes or no is all I  need. But I definitely need you to be truthful. All right?”
(The most important person.)
"I can direct you," Sherlock offers, attempting playful magnanimity. "You seem teachable."
“You wouldn’t last six months!”
. I’m very good at acting a part, however. Oh! Do you want a catalogue of my disguises?”
(Who's coming?) He can't hear anything over the blood rushing in his ears, can't see anything past a sudden case of micropsia as panic digs its claws deeper into him. Stupid,
"John, John,
"Dada!"
(...though, how exactly do you mean, when you say you love me? As a friend? Like the brother you don't have, or a brother in arms? Or like your sister; also an addict and a pain in your arse? If we have to sit close together, will you cross your arms, or put one of them around my shoulders? Or can we hide our tangled fingers together in the space between our thighs? Would you rest your hand on my knee and let me cover it with mine? Would you hold my hand outside the flat, where people could see? Huddled in a dark alley, chasing after a kidnapper, walking through the park? Would you sit with me at Angelo's with a candle on the table and a ring box in your hand?)
consider you for his hit list," Sherlock mumbles, pronunciation ruined by greedy bites of hamburger. They are hidden away in John's penthouse suite, curtains shut against the Hong Kong skyline and his security detail banished to an adjoining room with orders not to disturb him until 6:00am on pain of immediate defenestration. He's ordered a midnight snack brought up and now the door is locked, the peephole taped over, and Sherlock has snuck in by methods he will not reveal even to John.
A frown still mars Sherlock's brow at the thought of John having to bear the brunt of their friends' initial anger. He finds himself wanting to apologize in advance, too, but Dr. Hughes has taught John - and John has been teaching Sherlock - to replace as many apologies as possible with expressions of gratitude instead. Something to do with skewed perceptions of self worth, and creating more positive and healthful conversations, per the therapist.
"That's the thing though," John says, curling up out of his comfortable slouch and one elbow coming to perch on an arm of his red chair. Sturdy fingers rub at his brow like he wants to stop frowning but can't make his features obey.
John is back in the UK and for the first time in decades, unemployed. By all rights he ought to be bored out of his skull. Instead, he feels rather like he's still on mission with Sherlock, only now it's on home soil.
to keep this hushed up, John! The big com…corp…compilations will spend billions attempting to have us destroyed or…or…
(Two years and change.)
There's another hum and smile, and after a bit of a think of his own, John asks,
"Are these..."
Case in point; Sherlock refuses to be John's only "real" relationship, and instead of telling the brunet to get stuffed, John invites his head of security to his primary residence for a five course meal, probably just so that he can say he had someone over for dinner.
“I crawled out the window three seconds  after I locked myself in,” Sherlock explained. “Have you been talking  to my door this whole time?”
with me. Not how he loves his mates, his family, his risotto. I can ask him if  he will kiss me and his answer will be a very enthusiastic yes. We can share the flat and our food and the Work but also a bed, and kisses, and an entire life together.)
Now, in the companionable darkness of Sherlock's bedroom (is it
, Sherlock silently begged.
"John?"
"No. Not at all. Completely wrong," John says quite firmly, a frown now creasing his brow. Sherlock is relieved, but...
Sherlock Holmes is redeemed, resurrected, and returned.
The silence resettles in the pocket of air between them. The lines of John's face have smoothed back out into a soft, sober wonder. Slightly sad, and Sherlock wonders if it's because he's remembering Sherlock's blood on the wall, or of someone else he's lost. He's not got enough data to be jealous, so he tells himself that the little prickle he feels is concern for John's sorrow.
“We’re discussing romance, and quite frankly this conversation’s a bit funny, so...yeah, I think I must.”
Some requests, John has even fulfilled prior to receiving them verbally. Sherlock dutifully mentions the item and date of occurrence so that the recipe box can remain current.
As if to further prove how perfectly suited to Sherlock he is, John's next order of business is to utterly ignore their guest in favor of placing a concerned, comforting hand upon Sherlock's shoulder.
Going over his recently acquired knowledge of what it feels like to be kissed (!) and cuddled (!!) and loved (!!!!!) by John Watson is the obvious answer. It's mostly indulgence, but he tells himself it's only prudent to double-check his new memories and confirm that they're securely archived.
“What do you mean, what am I doing? I’m sleeping in your bed, obviously. How else am I supposed to be little spooned?”
Silence is John's only reply for a long, long while, and then he seems to shake himself out of whatever reverie he'd fallen into and attempts to repair some of the damage. Pestering Sherlock for directions and details all the while, he damps the frizz back down a bit, then a bit more, then carefully finger combs mousse in, doling the stuff out in over-cautious, walnut-sized blobs. Sherlock is still a mess once John is finished, but it's a great improvement over the dandelion clock look he'd been modeling nearly an hour earlier.
He has a great deal to sort through and arrange in his Mind Palace, and knows that he won't be able to resist a bit of awestruck review and replay as he does so. In John's arms is as good a place as any to be while he works. In point of fact, he cannot think of a better.
'Fatuous' is a pleasing insult to use because it has the word 'fat' in it.
- Mycroft Holmes, SIS Building, conference room 12
"Did I get anything wrong?" he asks, trying to hustle the moment along and get back to the main question.
When John reminds him that they're still confined to the upper storeys, he squawks in outrage and then goes on a rant that begins with logical arguments but rapidly descends into unflattering assessments of his brother's person and personality. He grows so increasingly noisy that John ends up wrestling him onto the couch and quieting him down with an arsenal of shushes (agravating), muffling hands (bitten), consoling kisses (grudgingly accepted), and a few strategic gropes (highly effective).
Sherlock's been responsible for at least half the buds and blossoms decorating his flatmate ever since they moved in together. He knows; he keeps track.
The doors to the liquor cabinet - more like a liquor showcase, really - open while John messages the kitchen to provide nibbles, and Colin solemnly declares John "an archangel among men" when he's given permission to crack open the 50 year old Highland Park single malt. Half an hour later, upon seeing the indoor pool for the first time, Tom drops to one knee, presses his roast beef toastie to his heart, and proposes marriage.

Dear Sherlock Holmes,
John listens and wonders in a drifting, wordless way.  Curiosity and worry are for parts of his mind that aren’t available just  now, and he feels pleasantly heavy, so he does as the voice (Sherlock,  Sherlock) bids and lets himself sink deeper into slumber. The voice is  as lovely (loved) and soothing as the warmth and softness, though, so he  struggles just a bit, just enough to hang on to the low murmur instead  of letting it wash him away.
John seems to have the most trouble with Sherlock never second-guessing whom to shoot. He keeps pressing, as if wanting to be told that yes, Sherlock did have one moment of hesitation, one pang of self-doubt.
"I  trust you with my life, Sherlock,” he said, aiming for a mix of warmth  and solemnity. “And obviously I admire and like you. And I’m comfortable  enough with you to call you out when you’re being a manipulative prat.  So out with it, what are you after?”
John moves in to 221B, because Sherlock still has trouble sleeping.
"I  know you hate obvious answers, but sex tops the list, I have to say,"  John began, ticking items off on his fingers. "You said intimacy, so...I  guess either a nice, leisurely shag or a lazy morning after. Actually,  there's a lot to be said for just spending the night together,  especially on a cold, rainy night. A good snog on a comfortable couch."
93. Grab the skin over my collarbone in your teeth (lightly, lingeringly)
Sherlock glances back and forth between the laboratory supplies and the bedroom supplies. It would make the most sense that these two varieties of items are not connected to each other, but John's phrasing had indicated otherwise. Sherlock attempts to connect the dots.
At this, Sherlock cranes his head up to peer at his pillow with a puzzled frown.
"Was afraid you'd destroy the flat," John mused. He stroked the crook of Sherlock's elbow, and hummed thoughtfully at the shiver it produced. "Looks like you were lonesome, not sulky."
...bringing box after box after box into the living room. The smaller ones seem fairly light, but others are set down with significant thuds. The boxes are too numerous to be accounted for by a sudden need to spring clean, too heavy to contain only new linens or clothes, and too square and generic to be replacement laptops and what-not. After the last of the security team departs the first floor, Sherlock speaks up.
