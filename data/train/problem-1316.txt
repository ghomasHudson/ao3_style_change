Any objection he might have had eclipsed when the man (Darius? Danny?) showing a lack of gag reflex he frankly admired swallowed around him, taking him deeper and deeper, until he could feel the man's nose flush against his pubes.
It took me forever to write this chapter. Real life was crazy - and I wasn't exactly thrilled with how the chapter was turning out. I am still not, but at least I finished writing it. :)
He knew that Sherlock was loathe to play the game, that time, but that he would do it, not for the dead bodies Herman Bennett had stashed somewhere or because of the young woman who had been abducted.
Neither of them spoke after that and he was starting to think that their session would end like that, that the minutes would tick until it was time to go, but Doctor Hood said, eventually, “Then it means you will have to learn how to forgive yourself.”
He had not let those words touch him, at the time. He had played his violin, thinking that everything was how it was supposed to be: John with Mary for the baby’s sake, until they got more information about the woman’s past, John and him working together, investigating Moriarty’s seemingly impossible return from the dead.
It probably would not make any difference at that point, but he didn’t want to take useless risks. He was aware that he would have to deal with Mycroft Holmes, whatever the aftermath of that day would be, but that would be on his terms. Mycroft Holmes would not have data, he would
There had not even been a reason for her actions at first, she had simply gone through the motions; it hadn’t even been a matter of instinct because if she had listened to the primeval part of her, the one burning with anger, the one that kept screaming and keeping her awake at nights, she would have found Sherlock Holmes, wherever he was, kill him, make him pay and then ditch him like road kill just like he had done to Alex.
Those stars – belonged to a precise moment in time, a precise night, of years before, Sherlock had stored away that moment: it had been unusual to see so many bright stars in London, and it had happened right in the middle of one of Moriarty’s games.
He wanted to say something, anything to squash that feeling of dread in the pit of his stomach, but stopped when, for one of those weird, creepy circumstances that made up John’s life with the Holmeses, Anthea knocked at the door and entered the room; she gave a polite nod of her head to both Sherlock and he, and handed Mycroft the yellow envelope they had found on Sherlock’s bedside table. John didn’t want to consider the alternatives – whether Mycroft had known how long it would take for Sherlock to ask for the photographs or, worse, the room was bugged. He really, really didn’t want to think about all of that.
Whoever was pulling the strings was extremely careful, to the point of paranoia. They had only moved when Sherlock and him had been too busy, too distracted to really notice things that would have been otherwise obvious.
He had been part of plenty of similar operations in the past, but he didn’t remember the presence of someone so high up in the chain of command in them and yet Mycroft Holmes had just entered the house.
He didn’t speak, at first. He didn’t ask any questions, he didn’t need to. He was perfectly aware of where he was, he was aware that what he was seeing was part of himself and there was no time to care.
Silence fell in the room as Sherlock watched the video. She had immediately put it on mute, acting on instinct, Sherlock didn't. Oh, no: he heard every noise, every broken sound the man in the video made, he probably inferred a lot from the three men's utter silence.
. He had been afraid that he would forget Sherlock: the sound of his voice, the impossible hue of his eyes, the way he filled a room, bigger than life, the minute he entered it – and everything else paled, faded in the background. Things hadn’t changed, after all; he hadn’t forgotten a bloody thing, even as he was mad as hell, even if, for a moment, he had hated Sherlock for what he had done, for making him grieve, for breaking his heart.
They found the room where John must have been kept first: it was bare, except for a chair screwed to the pavement. He knew that John must have been there because his coat was there, there was no blood – and he felt relieved. The very last thing he wanted was to tell Sherlock that he had found John’s blood.
Sherlock had not calmed down since he had left Baker Street. On the contrary, the tenuous grasp on his emotions he had showed at Scotland Yard was fraying at the edges. Mycroft knew that he was the only person who could see how much his brother was trying to hang to rationality and facts, while
“I guess I will have to cut down on the good stuff, then. Bloody fantastic!” She had said, but he had heard the way her voice had cracked – and he had wanted to be there, with her, not thousands of miles away.
Not even Mary had that number, even if she was for all intents and purposes his second in command; the fact that the phone kept ringing,  while he was in the middle of a business meeting, an important meeting upon which a lot of his future endeavours rested, was not a good sign.  Nevertheless, he smiled at the people in the conference room,  apologised and got out of the room, the cell phone in his hand,  but he didn't answer until he was in his office.
“Everybody knows he is my pressure point, Mary – that’s hardly shocking!” Sherlock replied. She was right. He did not have a plan, not really. Finding John and trying not to lose himself again had been the only things in his mind. He should have ignored his feelings, put aside his anger and devise a plan, a strategy with Mycroft.
"Sherlock?" John said, interrupting his musings.  He hadn't heard him opening the door. How long had he stayed there? He hadn't even heard him following him; he had not heard him opening the  door and getting into the room.
Mary had been very methodical – he had noticed it in the house. If he had not known for a fact that she had been an assassin, he would not have – deduced it from her house. She had kept up the facade, but there was a military precision in the house that he had not missed, that it surely didn’t belong to John.
“John –“ He said. He was sorry. He was sorry that he had to hear that and that he had been used like that because of him.
“Of course, it isn’t.” He replied. And he knew it wasn’t. just like he knew that Herman Bennett’s serial murders weren’t his fault, or the scars on Joan Adams’ body weren’t. What he knew and what he felt, deep down, seemed to clash apparently. Which was unusual for him. Guilt was something he was not really accustomed to. He had killed people and he had never felt guilt, after; those acts had been necessary, it had been a matter of survival, but that was different.
And the worst thing was that he suspected Sherlock was playing his hand at the game and, once again, he was leaving him out.
Two new operatives were already outside Sherlock’s room, they had a list (which he was sure they had already memorized) of the people allowed into the room and, no doubts, they were aware of the fact that Mycroft Holmes was cross. “That will be all.” Mycroft said to the other operatives.
He didn’t remember having dreamed, which was unusual since he always remembered his dreams in vivid Technicolor; he had expected nightmares after what had happened, his body instead had just shut down. Of course, the downside of it was that Sherlock knew – and that was the last thing he had wanted.
Sherlock, once again, saw right through him, though; he rolled his eyes and said, “Clothes, John! My laptop, the battery charger for my mobile phone.” He saw Sherlock and Mycroft exchange a long look, one whose meaning he didn’t even bother to try and guess. He sighed and said, “All right.”
David Hood had come to his hospital room, once – after Herman Bennett had tortured and raped him (he could say the words aloud, now. Both John and him had stopped tip-toeing around them) and he had lashed out at him. He did not remember what he had said, but Doctor Hood didn’t seem to mind.
“You already are – and I told you: it will be a waste of time, Sherlock.” The man said. He heard the man’s smile in his words when he said, “So let’s make this interesting.”
“Ninety two stiches.” John said. “You were in Bennet’s hands for only eight hours and – should I tell you what Bennet did to you in 480 minutes? I read your chart, you know?”
Sherlock nodded. He didn't talk, he didn't say that it was just a sponge bath, that he ought to stop treating him as if he feared he would fall to pieces at any given moment.
And someone had spied on them all that time, someone had taken photographs of them and in most of those pictures (and he hardly had an eidetic memory, yet those images were seared in his brain) Sherlock had been looking at him and there had been something naked in his eyes in some of those photographs, there had been longing in his eyes and he had been a blind moron. He had been blind to the depth of his own feelings (and punishing Sherlock had been far easier than facing the truth, than looking into himself), blind to Sherlock’s, blind to Mary’s deceits and lies, blind to his surroundings. He wasn’t any more. He had thought the same thing, in that very flat, the night he had seen Sherlock’s scars, the night he had kissed him – but only now, in that too silent room, surrounded by Sherlock’s things, he was seeing things clearly, he was really observing. He had said he would not going anywhere, that he would not leave Sherlock’s side, and he had meant every single word, each time he had said it, but he was realizing, in that moment, what Mycroft had truly meant the first night at the hospital – about being Sherlock’s pressure point, about being his source of strength.
The sergeant had the presence of mind of leaving the room immediately, for which Sherlock was almost grateful. Victor was sleeping; both his hands were bandaged and as he took a step forward, toward the bed, he noticed the bruises on his face, but he also knew that he wasn’t in shock any longer.
Perhaps, Mycroft would not apologise to his brother for a choice they both had made, but he would do everything he could to make sure that Mary would not have her posthumous victory.
William stared at the woman; she reminded him a little of Sherlock Holmes, in the way she seemed to read right through him, in her bright intelligence.
It only meant that hoping that things wouldn’t go completely pear-shaped just that once didn’t make him feel like a complete loon.
been a lot of pain, all the words Mr. Bennett had said, every moment in which he had touched him as if he owned him, the texture of his heated flesh in his mouth, the feeling of blood tickling down his body – the things he had hastily shoved in a dark corner in his mind palace filled his mind, his body, at once.
that it was driving him crazy – that he did not accept not to be in control of his own body and mind.
She ignored Sherlock, she ignored how much she hated the fact that he was saying that name – even if it wasn’t Alex’s real one (and she was still so proud of him because his cover had held even after his death. He truly had been good, the best at creating false identities and coming up with backgrounds that held even the strictest scrutiny), she hated the sound of his voice and the pain she could hear in it.
John wondered whether Sherlock realized that he still danced around the words. Even after the previous night, even after he had told him the gist of what had happened.
He was in Chicago, in that old house, in that room with yellow wallpaper peeling off the walls and a big bucket of ice cold water on a table.
what he had meant to say! He had meant to hurt John, to tell him that he didn’t need a minder that, despite evidence to the contrary, he could spend five minutes alone in that bathroom without breaking furniture and slicing up his hands.
Sherlock nodded, “Yes.” He said. He was doing exactly what Mycroft had anticipated he would do. There was something that Mycroft had not anticipated, though: Sherlock was in pain.
He had already told him that the man had been important to him, which knowing Sherlock should have been enough, but it wasn’t, not really. It had taken Sherlock a mere look at a thumb to know that it was Victor Trevor’s. And John didn’t even know what exactly he wanted to know about the man.
He felt like he was circling around the truth, without seeing it, not in its entirety....and it was so frustrating! Was it how it always was for normal people? A series of elements, data and scraps of truths and information all laid out in front of them without being able to make sense of them?
Sherlock looked at him, "Is it?" He enquired. He was genuinely curious. How were things different? Hadn’t he said that he should have married
"I used to dream that I didn't jump off that rooftop. I dreamt about not caring about Moriarty's words." Sherlock panted against his lips, when they broke the kiss (John wouldn’t have been able to say how long it had been since the first touch of Sherlock’s lips)
inevitable outcome. It might have happened when they had barely known each other, it might have happened in the days before Sherlock played his last game with Moriarty. It had happened, in his dreams, painful and so vivid, after Sherlock had died.
“You are thinking about what happened. You don’t have doubts any longer.” Sherlock said and added quickly, “Thank God.”
, because their intel had told him they had a narrow window of time before Sherlock got tortured to death.
"You could help me, if...." Sherlock trailed not completely sure of how he was supposed to finish his sentence.
John, however, nodded his head and he wished, more than he ever had in his life, that he could not deduce so much – that he did know every micro expression on the face of the man he loved and what they meant.
Sherlock was right), or keep it under scalding water until the skin blistered, but his voice was even and he looked confused and worried about him.
He had never said he had to do that alone. It was all Sherlock. It was because of what had happened between them in the facility. Greg was looking at him, and it took John a moment to remember that he had heard the man calling him, it had filtered and reached him even in his dream.
That case was fresh and Greg already loathed it with a staggering intensity. The note for Sherlock, had made him want to hurl things against the cream coloured walls of the small, cozy flat Joan and William shared when he had first read it.
“Later,” Sherlock said. He disconnected the call. Mycroft knew what he wanted, he knew what his instructions were, what it mattered to him. There was no point discussing semantics and the fact that they had been both played.
, there had not been doubts, he had not had the time to properly think. There had been other things to do.
"I still dream about it, you know? I saw you die twice, Sherlock. Twice! I saw you fucking flat line on that table!"
“I know what you are trying to do…” Sherlock started, but John stopped him by placing his hand right above his heart. He wasn’t touching him, though – the bloody wounds in his chest were still there. And John could never stop being himself. Not even then.
Sherlock had promised him, he had asked him to believe him when he said that he would always come back for him.
“I would suggest a trip to the canteen, but you have just been there.” Mycroft said and John shook his head, wondering if he would ever stop being surprised by the Holmes’ deductions. Mycroft stopped in front of the elevator, John hadn’t even noticed they had walked in silence, he covered his eyes with his hands for a moment, starting to feel the weight of the past forty eight hours.
Sherlock did not care. Not at the moment. Sherlock had not cared about the larger scheme of things for too long. That was the problem.
Her tears, when she opened her eyes were real. It was possibly the first unplanned thing she had done since she had come back from the United States after Alex’s funeral. The agents ignored her and she looked at the window, seeing the road pass by. For a moment, just a moment, she was scared for the baby. She didn’t care about physical pain, she wouldn’t have lasted long if she had been. She didn’t care about pretty much anything. But she had still a job to do and the people above her, her current bosses (or was it partners? It didn’t matter anyway), wanted her to succeed.
. Agent Harris still wanted to save people. He was still an idealist, and working for the secret services hadn’t changed that.
And she was letting him see now, she was allowing him to deduce everything: it was all in her hands, in the way she was tilting her head, in how she was not smiling and that was the real Mary: cold eyes, heartbroken, not a psychopath genius like Jim Moriarty, their paths would never have crossed if he hadn’t killed someone she loved.
He had not wanted to know. He had pretended to having moved on, pretended that it hadn’t taken him almost two years to even consider going back to Baker Street to properly say goodbye to Sherlock (and he hadn’t, not really, he hadn’t even dared to touch any object in the flat, just a last visit, forcing himself to say out loud that he was moving on, that he was about to get married, that he was fine). He had not asked how Sherlock was doing, and he should have known – he should have known how
He had learned to recognize the differences pretty soon: Sherlock would retch in the bathroom if his dreams involved the basement, usually – but he would not make a sound, he would barely move if the nightmares were about
“Prove it.” Sherlock said. And he had not imagined that Sherlock’s voice had been but a whisper, he hadn’t imagined the emotion in it. It was there, in his eyes too: a request, a test, a command, a pleading, all rolled into one.
“Good. He is happy and he finally doesn’t have to hide whom he is.” He replied. It was the truth. Victor had been his first love, he had made many mistakes with him, but so had he. He was sorry that he had paid the price for Mary’s vendetta, but that man was his past. He was genuinely happy  for him.
It was Sherlock, who would die if he intervened - and his daughter would too if he didn't do what he had been asked to do.
, that talking to Herman Bennett had not sorted the desired effect. Yes. The man had tortured him. Yes, the abuse had been unpleasant and humiliating and painful, and yes,
"Oh, you will live, Mr. Bennett and I guarantee that it will be my privilege to ensure that you hate every single moment of it. You enjoyed playing with your victims, didn't you?"
He helped Sherlock dress and undress every day. It wasn't strictly necessary, but neither of them had commented on that.
He was desperate. He was – no – he refused to even entertain the possibility that he might be broken. He wasn’t. Not his brother, not under his watch. Not again.
John thought, but didn’t say anything, he helped him sit, he would have to wear his bloodied clothes until they went back to Baker Street – he had no idea what would happen once they got there. They had ordered him to go back with Sherlock to Baker Street and wait; he had sent a text, immediately after, asking for proof that his daughter was still alive. The text had bounced back.
He followed Greg; the "other room" wasn't much bigger than a junk room. The first thing John noticed right before entering was the strong, coppery smell of fresh blood and the sickly acrid one of vomit; someone (Sherlock) had bled and retched in that small, windowless room. He took another step, but stopped on the threshold, while his eyes fixed on the walls: they were sound proofed, there was a rack on a wall with manacles attached to it.
He tilted his head down, getting closer to Bennett. No one got close, no one tried to stop him. He could still feel bile rising in his throat and had to swallow past it.
He turned and opened the door, and pretended not to hear Victor saying, “You too. And be careful, Sherlock.”
He could tell him that it should be Mycroft, or his parents – or bloody Scotland Yard, but Sherlock would not listen.
They – Mary had let him see her. That child was John’s flesh and blood and he had made a vow to be there for her – regardless of whom her mother was.
“Your eloquence, as ever, astounds me, John,” Sherlock replied, but he could hear relief in the man’s voice, and exhaustion.
to what had happened; she had left some of John's belongings and her rings in John's old bedroom, foregoing talks about divorce, alimony and their daughter.
He saw Sherlock heaving his shoulders and stop. He turned slowly toward him and said, “I have known Irene Adler’s whereabouts for years. I never once considered reaching out to her, but I put myself through hell for you. What might you deduce about my heart? About what I want?”
It was the truth, he could tell when his brother was lying to him, but it wasn't enough. Not that time.
He would not defend Mary, he would not cover for her again, but he needed to defuse the situation. Mary was looking at him expectantly. She knew John would listen to him, but he couldn't bring himself to lie. Not that time.
The other box, the reason for which they had had to go and see Herman Bennett. Something else was seeping through the paralysis that had enveloped him since he had seen the CCTV footage: it was relief.
They hadn’t touched the subject of what Herman Bennett had said to Sherlock, of what he had carved on Sherlock’s chest:
and he was the strongest person he knew) stubborn and before John could do or say anything, he said, "They didn't choose them randomly, John. They didn't choose them for their appearances or their jobs or even their
He could block out dread, fear, anger – he was good at that, it was second nature to him, even now that John was, more than ever, everything to him. He felt calm – and he hated himself for that. John deserved more. He himself deserved more.
“You haven’t been retired for a long time. It happened after you met your fiancé.” Sherlock said, and there was something in his voice he could not recognize, that he had never heard in his friend’s voice. “She never asked you to, though. It was your choice.” Sherlock continued.
He blinked his eyes: the pieces were all there,  dancing  in front of him and he couldn’t put them together.
Part of him – the man who had spent two years  dismantling Jim Moriarty’s criminal empire was seeing the bigger picture, now. Mary’s execution had been planned, everything had been planned to destroy him – but
Part of him wondered whether he was just that for Victor: a lost cause, with the added benefits of regular sexual intercourse. He blinked his eyes choosing not to follow that train of thoughts.
The two men in the room knew who he was, it took him but a second to realise that. That was interesting, he decided. He would not play by the rules. He was the one who wrote the rules, he was the one who made sure they were applied, he was the one who could invent new rules if he deemed it appropriate and the two men would soon find out.
It was not the game, or the war – or the scars he had on his torso and the fact that they had been Mary’s idea. It ran deeper than that.
She had imagined that moment would bring her either closure or some sort of satisfaction. Mr Neal had once asked her what exactly her plans were once she had Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. She had said something about pain, blood and death. He had not believed her but had not said anything on the matter either.
For all intents and purposes Mary Morstan was trapped: yes, she was inside the Plexiglas cell with Sherlock and it would take her a second, even less, to shoot his brother, but that was not what she wanted.
He would not tell about what he had overheard (not on purpose, he had wanted to go and help) Sherlock saying outside  Major Sholto’s door while trying to convince him to open that door and let John help him.
He saw John swallow, his eyes getting big and bright, but his voice was steady when he said, “Please – don’t do this now. I can’t…”
Mycroft knew he would have to face the consequences of his actions, of his choices, but for the moment – the fire he could see in Sherlock’s eyes was enough to give him hope.
Lestrade, who had been the first person in a very long time who had hugged him, the night he had come back and revealed that he was alive.
Mary smiled, but some of the happiness she had showed was already fraying around the edges. She was not bluffing, she was absolutely sincere.
She had said yes – and he was now just realising that they just had their first date and they were smiling, walking toward his car, and he knew that if he took her hand she would entwine their fingers together.
William leant forward on his seat and said, “That is not possible – I saw him with my own eyes. I was there while he was questioned!”
But that, too, didn’t matter. Herman Bennett was dead and the only thing he could feel was disgust at the thought that the man had touched John.
He also sort of understood why Holmes couldn’t trust anyone at the moment: it still wasn’t clear how Sidirov’s records had disappeared, there could possibly be a breach in security and there hadn’t been enough time to investigate on that.
He had needed a few minutes to clear his mind after he had left Baker street, he had needed to remind himself that  they might have investigated on his past, they might have spied on him since his return to London,  they might know that John was his pressure point - who didn’t? It was the worst kept secret in London- but even if they were aware of the things he had done while being away, he doubted they knew what he could really do - what he was really capable of... but even if they did,  even if they knew the things he had done,  the lives her had taken,  the people  he had deceived,  they had no idea of what he was really capable of  at the moment. And it was simple,  really:
look in his eyes: he was cataloguing each and every detail about him, he could probably see every thought he was having, even those he was not truly aware of.
John was looking at him, he looked angry (at Mary, at himself), too pale, a large bruise was forming on his jaw and his nose was bleeding. The odds of John beating Mary had never been high despite the pain she was in; he had hoped, for that reason, that John would not engage her, but she had known just what to say to set John off. Predictable, really – but he couldn’t begrudge John for that.
The words, the trite words: subject, verb, and object were there, he could feel  them in his mouth;  their weight, how utterly inadequate they were to convey just how vital  John was for him.
That didn't mean that they didn't need to talk, that there weren't issues to hash through, but they were going
"Not really," Sherlock said and Victor's voice over the phone, how his heart had actually hurt in his chest when he had heard the deep baritone, seemed far away.
“Did you hear from Victor Trevor?” Doctor Hood asked, putting aside that subject too, for which he was grateful.
John knew from experience that he didn’t usually wake up screaming from his nightmares. That would be too easy, too
Mary’s body was not there. He exchanged a glance with Drake, who was looking around – and he could see how he was furrowing his brow; things did not add up.
His mobile phone started ringing a second before Mycroft opened the door of  Baker Street and stood on the threshold.
tell him any more than what he was supposed to, that didn’t mean he would not try to shake the man’s beliefs, after all it was what they had tried to do with him, wasn’t it? To use the man’s word: that was how he had been fucked over.
It had become too personal – and he knew that he was about to face God knew how  many hours of rushes against time, of hurt and lies and fear – and he had the sinking feeling that he would have to bid goodbye even to the little sleep he was getting lately.
Baker Street was still a wreck; Sherlock couldn’t conceivably live there for the time being and John had not missed the look of genuine surprise in the man’s eyes when he had offered him to stay with him (at his flat, his mind hastily added) until the mess was sorted out.
Unlike him, Sherlock didn’t seem surprised by the man’s words, he looked at him as the man described the weapons the four men had, their attire (all dressed in black, all wearing ski masks and gloves, no visible tattoos or scars.)
“I was told that Herman Bennett’s lawyers came running not even ten minutes after he was allowed to make his phone call.” Sherlock continued.
That wasn’t entirely correct, though, was it? It had started long before that, while he was in London, pretending that he was turning a new leaf, that he was moving on, that breathing was easy (it wasn’t, that was the problem.) and he was making progresses with grief (he was still paralyzed by it, actually.) – meanwhile Sherlock was somewhere else, getting rid of Moriarty’s web, dead for the world, for his friends and being
“Stay the fuck here and don’t be fucking stupid.” William said. There was a hint of defiance in his voice, of a challenge. John suspected that the man half hoped that Sherlock already had a brilliant plan in mind that would bring his fiancé back immediately. Or, perhaps, he wanted Sherlock to be a bastard to him rather than civil and sympathetic.
And it did not matter, in the least, that their bed sharing had stopped being platonic only very recently. Mary had kept sleeping on her side of the bed, he deduced: there was a book on her night table, a box of kleened, the tv remote and nothing else.
“Getting there, ain’t you?” Mary asked. There were no traces of her true accent now, it was American, mid western, to be precise.
The almost imperceptible tension in his shoulders, the too blank look on his face, but what he really felt was betrayed by the beads of perspiration on his temples and on the hollow of his throat.
"Sometimes I forget that you are who you are..." John said shaking his head. He was smiling, and there,
It didn’t take them long to get where the car had been left. They hadn’t even bothered to ditch it out of town, to burn it down, that made him think that somehow they had wanted them to find it.
Sherlock hadn’t looked at him, not once, since his breathing had calmed down and he had moved away from him. He had been silent while the doctor examined him – not asking him to leave the room, but not acknowledging his presence either - , he had been silent while the nurses took his vitals, and fussed over his IVs, he had kept looking at the wall after, when they had remained alone in the room. John was looking at him, now.
It was not midnight, the pool was not empty, he was not alone. There were people, there were Mycroft’s men and he was sure he was being watched by the people who had John. He kept his head high as he walked, his face a blank mask of indifference. The effect of pain killers was fading and Sherlock was glad for it.
“Of course, I don’t really believe in coincidences.” The woman continued, “Coffee is ready, shall we get back to work?”
John smiled, “I know – but it still doesn’t make you similar to Jim Moriarty. You said you were prepared to burn…”
Greg didn’t tell him not to move, not to contaminate the scene; he didn’t know what had happened in that hallway, but he was not stupid, he might not know the details, he might not have seen Sherlock leaving, stalking away from him, his body vibrating with anger and betrayal, but he knew them. There was a built in space, right at the centre of the room: black panels – the background of all the pictures and videos featuring Joan Adams.
He took a step back, perfectly aware that he was doing exactly what Mary had in mind. Mary – or the person who had manoeuvred her for years.
“I see.” Sherlock replied. And John recognized that tone of voice; Sherlock used it all the time on suspects, on people he wanted to antagonize. “You think this is a ploy to keep you at bay –”
“I don’t understand –“ Sherlock said, “you will kill us anyway – or you will get caught, what’s the point of this?”
Sherlock wanted to kill his brother, at that precise moment – but that would mean having less time and means to find John, and that was what truly mattered.
He had noticed a video embedded in a message in the draft folder, it was addressed to him, the timestamp showed John must have recorded that video right before Mycroft had come to Baker Street.
He still didn’t move, but he sought Sherlock’s gaze with his and said, “No. We kissed, do you remember?”
Mary shook her head, “Not a James Bond villain…” she sing songed in a very decent impression of Mrs. Hudson, “but I can tell you that he doesn’t like crusaders, which you are. The only reason he didn’t waste you before is because you did his job for him when you were playing the big
He could not ask John whether he was alright. He clearly wasn’t. He couldn’t promise him that they would find Mary before anything happened to her or the baby or both. Mycroft had told him that MI5 was already working on that – because four agents, four of his men had just been killed. Mycroft was – cross. Mycroft was hiding something from him, and it wasn’t just the contents of his briefcase.
Sherlock nodded his head. Even though he had noticed out of the corner of his eyes Molly’s protection detail, one of them was already on the phone. It would probably be useless like every other attempt had been since Jim Moriarty had shown his face on every screen in the country, but it was worth a try.
At least, that was what he was sure of most of the times. He closed other doors as images of what he had done, as the lives, he had taken reminded him that it was a war, Moriarty had started and he would have to finish it, once and for all.
He didn’t need to look at Mycroft to know that the older man had noticed as well. Mycroft chose to ignore his brother’s words and didn’t move, there was a moment of silence until Sherlock said, “Should I get up and take the note myself, brother?”
It had been a lovely ceremony and Sherlock had looked relaxed, content – even during the short words William and Joan had exchanged.
. She had loved whoever he had taken away from her; a man, obviously, judging by the watch she was wearing; not a relative, but a lover; it did not exactly take a genius to understand that, it had been clear ever since he had received the pictures at the hospital and, later, Victor had been taken.
Sherlock had refused to talk to a therapist. Not that John had expected anything different from him; truth be told he was not a fan of therapy himself, even if he knew that avoiding problems didn’t make them go away – and that was true both for Sherlock and for himself. The fact that Sherlock had been a bastard to the bloke, deducing him to the last detail, including the reason why he dealt with PTSD and sexual abuse mostly (“Playing the good Samaritan won’t save your sister or bring her back,
Sherlock gave William Moore an edited version of the truth, his voice was soothing and he didn’t look like someone who had just left the hospital – and for all intents and purposes shouldn’t have left it to begin with - , William listened to him, asked questions, but John suspected that Sherlock’s words weren’t truly registering with him, not yet.
if he left bruises on his skin, Sherlock shaped bruised to remind him that it had really happened, he had really told Sherlock he loved him.), looking at him, a frown of confusion on his face.
Someone: a lover, a husband; a man – someone she had met on the job, someone she had been devoted to and the devotion must have been mutual. She had talked about devotion, she had been testing his devotion to John for years. Only someone who did understand what devotion was could have used it so seamlessly as a weapon.
“Neither.” Sherlock replied, his voice like steel, not a hint of emotion in it, “I don’t care. I am not playing.”
Bennett had done to Sherlock – and John almost wished that Moriarty was still alive so that he could rip him apart, he wanted to kill Bennett, make him bleed as much as Sherlock had.
understand that he had reached the same conclusion. It was transparent – and it unsettled him, more than he was ready to admit that he could not say what Mary’s plan was. He could not deduce or infer anything, and it was something that he truly was not accustomed to.
about his brother. If he wanted to be brutally honest with himself – and self deception was something useless and dangerous, therefore he rarely, if ever, indulged in it, he had never been able to deny his little brother anything. It was his weakness. Sherlock
She had been his girlfriend of course, he would recognise her handwriting and he noticed the almost imperceptible hitch in Sherlock's voice as he had said Janine's name
Catherine was, in a manner of speaking, his niece. She was one-month old and they had no idea, no clue regarding her whereabouts: CCTV had been useless, the men apprehended didn’t know anything and newborns all looked alike.
The instructions were clear, they were sound and logical. The mole was not afraid, he had had guarantees, he had been paid and offered a fresh start; he should have understood that there couldn’t be any different outcome.
was spied on.” Sherlock had replied petulantly. He hadn’t even known why he had said those words – anger had started to seep through the cracks: making his heart pulse in his throat and his senses too honed, almost painfully so.
He spoke in Russian after, he told him to pay attention, to watch, to deduce and then disappeared from the screen, he heard the steps, a couple at most, he reappeared a moment later bringing Mary with him, he was dragging her; she looked like she could barely stand on her legs (epidural – its effects had just started to fade, he observed.), the man had no troubles making her sit on a chair, she didn’t oppose, she didn’t try to fight the man. Mary had never been stupid. Sherlock saw that the cuffs were already there on the armrests of the chair.
He slowed his pace to a halt when he was next to the graveyard. There were footsteps around the headstone, they looked fresh – and Sherlock honestly didn’t care about the deductions his mind was coming up with. Another pawn, another nameless, faceless moron who followed orders and played their part in that game. Boring.
He had discovered something else since he had fallen from that building: working on his own was not like it used to be. Being alone – was not as pleasant as it used to be.
In the short weeks they had been together after Christmas she had shown him her prenatal scans, he had gone with her to doctor appointments – and everything had gone swimmingly, but – that was
Sherlock smiled. Lestrade had never truly seen that side of him, hadn’t he? Lestrade had seen the bodies in that warehouse – how did he think those men had met their demise? Did he think it had been elegant? Clean?
They would use everything and everyone: including the fact that Joan and him had been chosen for that game or his expertise and contacts. And that could not happen. Ever.
And he was sure that if he told Greg what had happened, what was at stake, what he had to do to save his daughter and Sherlock – he would put him in danger, he would put everyone in danger, even if Greg would undoubtedly try and help.
“What facts?” Sherlock asked. It was like old times, he felt exactly what he was supposed to feel: his body, his mind, his surroundings.
Death polluted the air; the stench of blood, bleach, bodily fluids and rotten flesh was everywhere, mingled with the fresh one of gunpowder and burnt flesh. No one in the house was acknowledging that smell, but John could see its effects on those people's faces: they were yarders and operatives, men used to blood and swift rescue operations; but it was clear that those smells were bringing back memories, they were making their faces grow pale and green around the gills.
John blinked his eyes. He was not surprised, Greg thought, not exactly; Sherlock had saved that girl’s life, after all, but Greg saw John processing his words and nod his head.
It was how he always replied to people who complained about the man’s habits. He was Sherlock Holmes, he didn’t give a toss about rules and if he wanted to disappear, if he didn’t want to be found, no one would be able to.
He had decided to answer the phone since it hadn't stopped ringing, more to try and rationalise his own thoughts than to really know what was so urgent. Besides, he had had a sinking feeling about what it might be about.
William had no idea for what purpose Mycroft Holmes, who had all of MI5 and MI6 at his disposal, could possibly need him for,  nevertheless he said,  "Yes,  sir. "
“We are here because of Brian Cooper, it’s always been about him.” He said. He had no idea what kind of drug had been used in conjunction to the pills he had taken in Mary’s bedroom, but it was working. He could not move, it didn’t matter how hard he tried.
The man smiled, John noticed that he had chapped lips when he licked them. For a moment he saw himself doing what Sherlock had done at Scotland Yard: he saw himself bashing that sick bastard’s head against the table over and over.  He saw himself stopping only when he had actually killed him, until he could see his blood spilling over the table.
He had not even looked at Victor when he had left, but he had taught John how to waltz when he was about to get married to Mary Morstan.
It had been since he had set foot in it, with Sherlock, on a January day, what it felt like a lifetime before. He was trying to observe, to see the things he had missed – trying to understand how it had all come crashing down when Sherlock had smashed his fist against the mirror in the bathroom a few days before.
“Shut up,” John said. The words were stumbling over the lump in his throat, over the anger and the need he felt of kissing Sherlock, telling him the truth and find his daughter, together.
She did post-mortems, Anderson had worked on forensics for years – and while they had never seen eye to eye on the rare occasions they had met, they were both good at what they did.
think of them.” Doctor Hood said. According to the doctor, those scars represented the eight hours with Herman Bennett, the physical, undeniable proof of what had taken place in that soundproof room. When he had objected to that, Doctor Hood had asked why those were the only scars he wanted removed.
No, bloody hell! He was not! He had stitches all over his sodding body, a mess on his right hand and a bruised rib!
“John –“ Mary said, “I am opening the door – don’t be an idiot. I am not a junkie you can beat up in a crack house.”
It happened very quickly, Mary rolled her eyes at his words and pistol-whipped John; he clearly heard the noise of John’s skull cracking and he saw him fall, face down, on the floor, unmoving.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow, but Greg said, “I mean it, Sherlock: it is John’s daughter we are talking about – I am
“We will provide him with a distraction – your daughter will be safe. You’d better move now while your boyfriend can’t see you.” The man said and disconnected the call.
It was what Victor had told him – the only thing he had got from the two men was that the tallest of the two had a personal reason behind his actions: whether it was loyalty to Moriarty or hatred against him it didn’t really matter.
“No, it wasn’t.” John replied and he tried to convey with his voice that he would not say anything more. Truth was that as much as he sympathized with William, Sherlock took the precedence.
He didn’t need to know that. The matter of fact tone of voice had told him that she would help, that she would accelerate things and that was the only thing he cared about.
He had been – distracted. To his chagrin, he had to admit that he had looked at the parts and not the whole. That he had failed to see the whole picture, that it had taken Mary’s kidnapping to finally make him observe things was unacceptable. Sentiment was
Was he lying? John couldn’t say, he was surprised when Sherlock’s lips covered his again, softly, gently.
And Sherlock wanted very much to drive him away, to manipulate him, to have him handcuffed and brought to safety by agents Drake and Harris.
She wanted to win, of course. She held Sherlock and him responsible for a personal loss and she had been moulded into a weapon. No, she had allowed Jim Moriarty’s successor to use her as a weapon, as a distraction.
He tilted his head up and looked at the video feed, it had gone dark, when had it happened? How had he not noticed?
The man nodded and looked away and John followed Sherlock’s gaze, he had narrowed his eyes and John knew that look. He had missed seeing it on Sherlock’s face, the one he made when he had sniffed a trail, when he had deduced a missing piece of a puzzle.
Sherlock didn't know the names of all the people he had met, deceived, hurt and killed while he had been away; Mycroft did. Mycroft was thorough. He had made sure that his tracks were covered once he was done in a place, therefore, he had extensive data. But that was not the reason for their daily meetings. Mycroft might have the data, he could infer many things, but he had
, he had – planned John’s wedding, he had solved client’s cases, ignored things, a lot of things, things sealed shut in his mind palace, things that he would have investigated on in the past. He had let things slide – because time, sometimes, had flown by without him noticing. He had not been the man who had jumped from that rooftop or even the one his brother had rescued in Serbia.
John had halted himself before he could touch Sherlock's back. He had wanted to trace the old scars with his fingers, because no, he had not been there with him, he had been in London, sleepwalking through his days at first and then gutted by loss, later. And Sherlock's words floored him and humbled him.
“Please,” Sherlock scoffed, “don’t start bluffing now. How does it feel Mary? Being so close to what you want and know that you are not going to get it?”
For some reason he couldn’t stop staring at the walls: they were covered with a yellow wallpaper, it was peeling off and there were stains of old blood and mold in some spots.
She had agreed, eventually, but she had had terms – she had asked him to make a promise. She had already sworn up and down that she would never sell him out or betray him, and he had believed her because her personal involvement had made her his best asset. There had also been the fact that she had not enough data about him to say anything of real value, should she have been apprehended.
Sherlock nodded; no snide retorts, not even an eye roll from the younger man and Greg took another step, shortening the distance toward the bed. Sherlock and John exchanged a glance, still apparently oblivious of the fact that they were holding hands, then John gave Sherlock a curt nod of his head (he didn’t squeeze Sherlock’s hand, he let the other man break the contact between them, Greg noticed) and got up from the bed, leaving the room a second later.
Sherlock had not only solved the mystery – he had also helped to save a life. And maybe he had been bluffing, he was a good actor, Greg had learned the hard way that Sherlock could deceive and manipulate and one would never get a clue about it until it was too late – but he had believed him.
And if it weren't Mycroft, if there weren't decades of animosity between them he would perhaps be moved by how carefully he was choosing his words; outbursts of brotherly concern, though, were not part of their relationship and he could barely take John walking on eggshells around him, he only tolerated it  from John because he realised that it wasn't easy to be with him, because there were moments he was so angry that keeping a  calm facade became nearly impossible;  there were moments where he felt numb,
There weren't many people who knew the number of the cell phone he kept in his left breast pocket, and those who knew it seldom used it, unless it was absolutely necessary. It was not how things worked,  it was not how he liked  things to be done.
Lips, tongue, Sherlock’s, trailing down on his skin , his fingers flicking his nipples, making him moan with pleasure; they moved together and John didn’t even know where they truly were, not any longer, it was too dark around them, but he didn’t particularly care because Sherlock was there and with each kiss, each touch of his fingers was making everything else unimportant. Unreal.
He was sure that Irene would not truly be on her own, that she would have someone with her, someone sent by Mycroft. And judging by the hard look in her eyes he was sure that  she  would keep doing what Sherlock has asked her to do – and not because of the debt she owed him.
“Yes.” He had said, not even bothering to ask how did he know since he had never told him. He was Sherlock – he was exceptional.
The black car that approached her was the kind of vehicle she had expected: luxurious but not too conspicuous and with tinted windows. There weren’t any bodyguards searching her before she could be allowed inside the car. There was just a driver – and a man in the backseat.
He wanted to ask what happened in Mexico if it had been in any way similar to the mess they were into, but he knew he would not get an answer.  Besides,  they were almost there: a big,  elegant house, away from the chaos of central London, but definitely not the suburb where Mary Morstan had lived.
He didn't understand. Sherlock was a strong man; he could definitely hold his own in a fight. He had seen him disarming C.I.A operatives, he had survived two years on his own and had dismantled singlehandedly Moriarty's web, why had...
Sherlock didn’t hesitate when he started to tell the man about Herman Bennett – and John didn’t miss the way William Moore blinked his eyes at the mention of that name; how was it possible that Bennett had made such an impression on people while he had been barely a blip on their radar? When had Sherlock started to put the pieces together?
Mary looked tired. That was the first thing that John noticed when he saw her. Mycroft’s guards hadn’t let her in – not that she had insisted on entering Sherlock’s room – so John had had to leave Sherlock – with Mycroft. He hadn’t wanted to leave Sherlock, not after what he had told him, not when Moriarty was involved – even if it had to be a bluff, because Moriarty was dead.
Agent Harris had already his orders, Mycroft’s phone call had been but a courtesy. He hoped it would not be yet another colossal waste of time.
ETA to correct one glaringly obvious continiuty error. That's what happens when your memory is crap and all your notes are stolen from you. Sorry *hangs head in shame*, I will edit this monster when I finish it --- shouldn't be long now:)
might be,  they didn't matter,  he was in that room,  with those men,  for a purpose: to gather further clues because they had things to say, clearly.
Mary didn’t smile and some of the happiness he had seen in her eyes and demeanor had faded. “You should save the oxygen, Sherlock –“ She replied, after a moment.
He couldn’t smile, not really – he was too wired, too worried to – but he held her hand tighter for a moment.
His grip on the back of his neck lessened, he shrugged the man’s arm around his shoulder and sat back.
Sherlock had asked Molly and Anderson, of all people, to examine the video more closely and, as usual, the bastard was right. Even while he was going to pieces before his very eyes he was still the smartest person he had ever met.
Victor and he, kissing for the first time, under a falling snow, like in a bad cliche. And it had felt anything but cliched. It had been real. It had truly happened and now Victor was gone.
It was fine when they broke the kiss and John felt breathless, and he couldn’t help smiling when he saw Sherlock’s eyes, dark with passion, his lips swollen and his hair (perfectly coiffed while he had been away) mussed.
The three men were larger than him, they were walking wastes of air, but they were also strong and, to use a colloquialism, trigger happy.
He dialed the number and couldn’t help blinking his eyes in surprise when a woman answered right away.
“You know that I would let everyone die before putting you at risk?” Sherlock said. And he knew it was a lot of not good. And he still didn’t care.
He could tell him, scream until he was hoarse, that it hadn’t been his fault. He had been a child, for God’s sake! He had spent all his life putting together pieces of complicated puzzles, solving mysteries, helping people, refusing to care about the victims because he had failed to solve a puzzle when he was a child.
William Moore had no idea that John Watson had had a similar look on his face as he first saw Sherlock's wounds: a momentary numbness crushed by the sudden realization that it had really happened; that those wounds were real, that someone had actually carved letters (different letters and names, different perpetrators, but the same intent) on Sherlock' s (Joan) skin.
hand until he performed tests, but he had been alive when it happened. Of that, he was absolutely certain.
The truth was that he didn't know, he had no idea whether the man handcuffed to a radiator was just unconscious or dead. He didn't know whether there had been other people in the warehouse that Sherlock had already disposed of.
“I know you would never do anything I didn’t want.” Sherlock said. And, God, were they really having that conversation?
Their behavior wasn’t that different than Herman Bennett’s once he had been caught: foolishly calm, self-assured, cocky.  Herman Bennett had not cared about being caught. The four men who had kidnapped Joan had put up a fight, of course, once he had found them, but they hadn’t been surprised either.
It felt like being on that bloody Tarmac again – and he was tired, so fucking tired of having to say good bye to Sherlock Holmes.
"John." Sherlock said, and John's mind must have been stuck on those images he had tried so hard to forget, because he hadn't even realised Sherlock had called his name until the younger man grabbed his face in his hands.
He knew it was useless to think about the things he had not done or seen, just like he knew that Molly was reading right through him, at least judging by the look on her face. It was the same look she had on her face while they had coffee and he said something stupid, something she strongly disagreed with. She took his hand in hers, and friends did those things all the time, didn’t they?
He knew that Sherlock was still looking at him, but he was surprised when he realized that he still hadn’t looked at Sherlock, not really, not in the way it mattered; sure, he had taken in all the details of his body: the gauzes on his torso, the orange blanket, the paleness of his skin in contrast with the dark bruises on his neck, the blotches of color on his face, but he hadn’t really looked at Sherlock’s eyes, because he always knew the truth – deep down – when he looked at him, the only times Sherlock had been able to fool him it had been when he hadn’t looked at him.
They were watching the two videos side by side. It had been Anderson’s idea. He had spent two years playing the conspiracy theorist and his attention to detail had become impressive.
. He could tell John that he had needed an assistant or that a limp soldier would have been useless to him. He could tell John that he had cured his limp because he was bored,  he could tell John that he had cured his limp because he could do that, he had known it would be child’s play because he had got the moment he had seen John what the man had needed.
He needed to scratch his chest (tear the skin away, delete Moriarty's name) so badly that Mycroft must have noticed. Yet, his older brother, whom despite everything was one of the three people Sherlock trusted implicitly, the others being John and  Lestrade,  gave no outward sign of having deduced it.
and he didn't like it. John knew better than talking; than asking more questions, but Sherlock could nevertheless read them easily on his face, even the ones that were lurking in the back of his mind, because he said, "I may be a lot of things, John - but I am
because Joan was alive, she would bear his own name on her skin (the symmetry was not lost on Sherlock...and he hated it. He hated that he had to carry Moriarty's name on his skin and that woman had to carry his. He was not like Moriarty!), Joan's fingers were a mess of broken bones, damaged muscles and tendons...but she was alive. She would heal...and William would be with her.
He could do none of those things. He could only look at John who smiled and said, “Why did you cure my limp?”
And the tendrils of irrational jealousy John had felt blooming in his gut  at Sherlock's words withered when he said, "
John wanted to stop her, because her smile was too sweet, too unlike any smile he had ever seen on Mary’s lips, while the look in her eyes was cold, unforgiving. “It’s not his fault.”
He had spent long seconds observing the two men, even before he had entered the room. He could – and had deduced a lot of things about the two men. He could (and would) point out who had physically pulled the trigger and shot Janine, but that was
John’s daughter: one of the reasons why he had lied to John in their sitting room, the reason why he had protected Mary –
“He – asked about you.” Greg said, “he – honestly, John? I think he was worried about you. He only accepted the blanket when you got in the house.”
He had barely touched the American soil when he got in touch with his contacts in Langley. He had exchanged e-mails throughout the journey with old acquaintances, though and  he had contacted some old friends, he had reminded some people of favors they owed him and the search had started.
“Put it on.” Mary continued. She was aware that he was looking at her, she was aware that he could not tell whether she was lying, cheating or whether she was being truthful.
And Sherlock was not moving, but he didn’t seem worried; he was in control: completely and fully. And Mary did not expect that.
And it hurt. It would always hurt. It hurt both of them and John hated that Jim Moriarty had still that power over them.
“Where. Is. He?” Sherlock asked. There was no point in telling John that he had no reason to be sorry or to play coy with Mary – or whichever her real name was.
Oh, he could. He also knew about the pictures sent to Sherlock (he hadn’t seen them, he just knew that John was in all the photographs sent to Sherlock), just like he hadn’t missed the name of the kidnapped woman and her profession.
“He asked about Alyce.” He said after a moment, deciding to stick to the bare facts. That had happened after Bennett had been dragged away, though. It had happened after Sherlock had crawled toward a corner of the small room, bleeding and shivering and had retched. And Greg had seen red for a moment, wishing to go to the other room and kick Bennett’s head in, because he had never seen Sherlock like that, not even at his worst, when he lived off of cigarettes and cocaine.
He wanted to tell Sherlock not to bother, but he didn’t exactly excel at planning as the gun pointed at his head showed.
Sherlock shook his head, “If or when you make up your mind, you know where to find me, John. 221B Baker Street.”
It was not the first time they were in such a situation: there had been the pool, a semtex vest and laser dots on both of them, there had been CIA operatives ready to shoot him to have Sherlock open a safe.
Devious.  And still playing games.  Mary was not smiling any longer and John was still calling his name.
Lestrade who had seemingly temporarily forgotten about that seemed contrite, for a moment. Molly had been threatened, her flat violated, but Sherlock had the suspicion (not a deduction, more like a guess because John had been right that night, the night he had killed a man for him: he did guess, from time to time) that the gesture had been done not to hurt him, that time, but Lestrade.
Sherlock blinked his eyes, he was – alive. He was on the pavement, plexiglass walls covering three sides except for the wall behind him. One side was obscured, he squinted his eyes noticing the pigmentation in the glass. It was possibly something controlled remotely.
The man grabbed her by the hair and a second later they all saw him hitting her with the butt of his gun, twice. When Mary’s face was visible again, new blood was gushing down from her nose and the man was telling her to shut the fuck up, still speaking in Russian.
“Don’t bother to try and trace this.” The man said. He recognized the thick Russian accent in his voice (he must be from Moscow), he was tall, he had broad shoulders and strong arms under that black turtleneck he was wearing. There was an air of defiance about him, of being sure of doing the right thing, not dissimilar from what he had seen in Herman Bennett and the men at Scotland Yard.
“He is fine.” He said, fixing her with his gaze, that seemed to make her more lucid, she nodded her head while he continued, “You will see him soon, I promise!"
There was static in his ear for a moment, he had almost forgotten he had that bloody earpiece on, he was on the first floor with other operatives; the voice, one of the men Mycroft Holmes had handpicked for that mission, told them that there was a cellar, even if it did not appear in the blueprints of the house.
What had he done? He had trashed Herman Bennett’s cell, he had moved a lot – but, as a precaution, he had worn gloves, he had washed his hands, after, before going back to John and Mycroft.
Mary took her time drinking her water, her body language that of a  woman in complete control, calm and
The man on the other side of the line said hello, he had an American accent. Somehow he had not expected that. A small part of him, despite all the evidence, despite the facts, had expected to hear Moriarty’s voice.
The two men were looking at him, Sherlock deduced that they had not worked together before that particular job, nevertheless, there was
He had talked about mercy – and both John and him had babbled about the events of the present and how they could not change the past.
It was the closest he could come to articulate everything that was wrong with the idea of John anywhere near Herman Bennett and, at the same time, it didn't even begin to cover it.
It was the hopes he had dashed, the hours spent in the dark, the nightmares, the feeling of being an impostor, a fraud, someone who had replaced the man who had left London the day after his own funeral, after hearing John’s words.
The man didn’t reply for a moment when the shot came, loud and deafening in that room, even if broadcasted through a mobile phone, Molly let out a sound – a cry, perhaps, or a whimper, he wasn’t sure.
He looked around, he wasn’t that far from Baker Street, he could not honestly say how long he had walked – his body had betrayed his mind, again. He could feel John, close, so close to him and it was like a beacon, he wanted to turn – he wanted to undo everything that had happened, go back to the start and do everything differently.
Bennett would pay for his crimes, justice would be served and Sherlock would be safe. He might have gone home, he
Oh, yes, Lestrade was worried about him and Sherlock was grateful that the older man hadn't wasted anyone's time by saying out loud that he was sorry about what had happened. Lestrade had physically unchained him, he didn't need his platitudes. And thanking him would be redundant.
Sherlock was -- a hurricane, he was the bravest person he had ever met. He was the love of his life and he had come back from his daily meeting with Mycroft looking ashen and tired.
“I need some air,” Sherlock said, he brushed his ear with his lips and John started, surprised both by Sherlock’s display of affection in public (he could still be an utter cock when they were not alone, he could be an arsehole, but he would not want him any other way.), and by the warmth of the man’s breath against his skin.
He kissed Sherlock, biting down on his lower lip and moaned against his mouth when he felt the man’s hand wrap in a tight fist around his prick.
Sherlock hadn’t asked questions and neither had he, they had listened to Lestrade’s voice as he told them about the case and John thought that he really didn’t want to see that particular crime scene. Yet he followed Sherlock and Lestrade (and their two shadows, the agents Mycroft had assigned to protect Sherlock) inside the flat William Moore and Joan Adams shared.
John was awake, he was in the kitchenette, he could hear him moving about, he could smell coffee brewing and he knew John would be back in the room soon, with coffee and toast, which he would diligently eat before taking his morning pills, and he waited for the panic to claw at him.
It was weird, but for some reason John had expected Baker Street to be different before entering the flat; maybe because he had lived in a sort of limbo, a bubble made up of a hospital room, too warm air, canteen food and Sherlock’s long silences. Or maybe it was because he felt different; after all the last time he had been in the flat he had kissed Sherlock – and so much had happened since then.
“Did he ever tell you why he didn’t do shit to knock Herman out cold? Because we did not see that coming!”
He turned; the dark-haired man in front of him was smiling, he too had been looking outside the window, he had gotten quite fond of his baby girl since he had brought her home.
"Call me the minute you have news.  Alert our friends in London." He said and checked his watch.  He had to go back to the conference room, his guests had a deal to sign,  one he had worked very hard on. There was a reason why the past few weeks had needed to be utter chaos for Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes: deals needed to be signed and alliances formed.
John shook his head. "You were about to go to eastern Europe on an undercover operation," John said. And part of him was still incredulous that they had been granted another chance.
him. He wanted to kill those people, whoever they were and go on with his life. He wanted to undo time, to rip its fabric and delete the past few years of his life.
Sherlock gave Victor’s father, his mother had passed away not knowing what had happened to her only son, an edited version of the truth. John had no idea whether he had done that to protect his family or that man. Possibly both.
. It made sense that Molly would say those words, that she would go there: she had been in love with Sherlock for so long, she had helped him faking his suicide, she had said she had moved on – but that had not truly happened only until recently, after she had broken up with Tom.
John was not stupid; despite what he had just said he didn’t move, he let her handcuff him with his hands behind his back. She didn’t even need to raise her voice before saying, “Look at your boyfriend, really look: those scars? My idea.”
She had fit into his life (wormed her way in, more like), in the wreckage of his existence post Sherlock effortlessly.
“It’s – a long story.” John said, “We caught a serial killer – but things got out of hand for a few hours.”
Sherlock had never bothered to learn those people's names, but he remembered them all: the ones he had bought information from, the ones he had lied to, those he had killed, either (mostly) in self-defense and those he had hurt in order to get the information he had needed. He also remembered those that had been collateral damage. He had deduced those people's lives, he had known who they were - he knew things that the reports didn't tell.
"Yes. It was for him." Sherlock said. "I'd appreciate if you could see that he receives it, should..."
He told her to remain there, and perhaps it was sentiment being endemic, but he masked it efficiently behind logic.
"So this is how is going to be? I will hurt you, you will lie to me – you will disappear and I’ll wait for you?” John asked.
It smelled, sounded and looked like a trap. Another cog in that machine intended to bring Sherlock down. He was honestly starting to miss the mess with  Jim Moriarty.
"We don't know. " The tall man lied,  "This? " The man continued,  gesturing at the space between them,  at the room,  "has been a long time in the making! "
“Everything,” John said. It was the truth. Mycroft and Sherlock, but Moriarty and Mary as well had taught him through the years that truth could be easily manipulated, that one didn’t need to lie to succeed in deceiving a person.
They had caught him, eventually. They had found Sherlock – but it hadn’t been the end. It had been a divide, yet another item to add to his personal lists of before and after.
Mary had given him all the information at the time, he had covered her tracks, but things were still not safe: it only took a CCTV image he might have missed or an eye witness to fuck things up.
“I knew that they had not checked the car, the driver was a moron – your husband did not have the chance to, he had been inside the building with me. He was supposed to intervene if things got out of hand.” He said.
“Yes, yes, you could say that.” John said. He should get up and leave. He didn’t want to leave Sherlock alone for too long. He had had his eyes closed when he had left the room, his breathing suggesting that he was asleep, but with Sherlock one couldn’t be too sure.
“Look, John – I don’t pretend to understand what’s going on, but whatever it is Sherlock and you are not alone in this.”
“She is the woman who snooped about Ms. Morstan in Chicago. She claims she has a score to settle with Mycroft Holmes.” Michael said.
He had pushed John away. He had done the right thing, for once. He had not been a selfish asshole. He had – done what good people were supposed to do.
“No. You didn’t.” Mycroft replied. And he wished he was indeed an iceman, that he could indeed be the cold hearted bastard who would have sold his brother out in exchange for information.
He had started from the bottom up: getting rid of small fishes, petty criminals, and those three idiots were the missing link.
And he knew that he would never ask Mycroft, despite his offer, because what happened the day Sherlock had visited Herman Bennett had scared him; because Sherlock had used his own actions (betrayal) to protect him, but he had been
“Christ…” William swore under his breath and John blinked his eyes; he hadn’t said a word, and yet William Moore was looking at him as if he had spilled every word and thought that had crowded his mind ever since he had seen Sherlock in Bennett’s basement.
Mary did not expect to get out of that room alive. He would hate to defy her expectations, now. If she wanted to play the game he would let her win.
The flat, of course, was unchanged; the only differences were the lack of a mirror in the bathroom, but thank God someone, Mrs Hudson’s most probably, had cleaned up all the blood and the broken glass from it (he might have seriously punched a hole through the wall if he had seen Sherlock’s blood. He had seen enough of it for a lifetime.) and his suitcases, placed in his old room. Mrs Hudson had told him that Mary had brought them, after their chat. There wasn’t a note and Mary hadn’t contacted him, but John was not surprised finding her rings on his desk. Part of him was relieved, he was a rubbish liar and an even worse human being for the almost staggering relief he had felt seeing those rings, but the other part couldn’t help being worried – Mary was carrying his child, their daughter, and he was afraid of how their unborn child could be used by Mary.
He thought, and John seemed to deduce (sense) his thoughts because he cradled his face in his hands, and there was no reproach in his eyes.
Yes. Of course. There would be the incentives, the things that supposedly would make him dance to their tune.
He kept walking. He did not have a plan, not yet – he had just walked away from Baker Street (home, it was home, it had always been – and despite everything, despite the grief, that animal he had never learned to tame and face it would always be
And he thought about Sherlock, allowing him to stay with him during his medical examinations, knowing that he could compartmentalize what had happened to him if he focused on the medical jargon, on the way to cure his physical wounds, but had sent him away whenever he had talked to Greg. He still hadn’t been allowed to get anywhere close to his official statement, it didn’t matter that he had asked for it more than once.
As he took a step toward Sherlock he felt like their lives would add another “before” (before Bennett, before they had kissed, before he had seen Sherlock’s scars) and “after” to the list, but it didn’t matter, he decided, as he shortened the distance between them. It took him exactly six steps to be in front of Sherlock, ignoring the other people in the room, because the only one who mattered was sitting on a chair, not uttering a sound, apparently oblivious for once of his surroundings.
There is a reason for the lack of descriptions of smut scenes between Sherlock and John. I ain't shy, that's for sure:)
John didn’t remember Sherlock ever looking at Mycroft with such contempt as he had done when the elder Holmes had told him that he didn’t have the security clearance to go with Sherlock and see Herman Bennett’s cell.
He saw his brother entering the Watsons bedroom. He saw the flow of deductions in the sharp look in his brother’s eyes (all of them unimportant). He saw how Sherlock’s eyes fixed on the bedside table and lingered there, for a moment.  He had already watched that moment. He knew now that even before Sherlock asked aloud his protection detail not to intervene that some of those men were being taken down with military precision.
Sherlock would have said boredom. And he would pretend he believed him, he would say something appropriately dismissive and that would be the end of it.
There must have been gossip at the time, among their common acquaintances, but no one had ever seen them together as a couple, he was certain of that. He never did things halfway.
the note, the moment the words actually sunk in. He saw the way he blinked his eyes, the way he clenched his jaws and remembered the conversation he had had with John at the hospital, on the stairs between floors, after Sherlock's surgery.
John wasn’t there. Not really. John, however, had been in his mind palace, had prompted him to fight, to run, not to drown so many times.
He didn’t realise he had got up, he didn’t even realise he had grabbed the man’s head and banged it against the desk – he didn’t hear the noise of bones breaking, he didn’t feel the blood splashing on his hand and on his shirt until he felt strong arms (Lestrade’s?) pulling him away.
He just shared part of his name with Sherlock Holmes – and had been chosen for some reason for that game by a Russian man he had met for a few minutes years before.
“Until you make up your mind – and as much as I loathe to be apart from you, I need to be alone. I can barely hold myself together, John.”
Before, though, before the news on the telly, before Greg had come to tell them about Joan Adams and William Moore - but after, one day after he had taken Sherlock’s official statement about what had happened in the basement and Sherlock had not wanted him there, in the room, even if John
He turned. John wasn’t even wearing his jacket, he was too pale, almost gaunt, he was the living embodiment of the dangers of dealing with Sherlock Holmes, but he was smiling and he looked
“I want to be with you.” John said – and the words came out so easily, as if they’d been waiting forever to be said, as if they’d been on the tip of his tongue, unbeknownst to him, and needed to be said. And maybe they did. And it was also the truth; six, simple words that made him feel lighter than he had felt in a very long time.
Sherlock turned toward the woman. Molly was clearly scared, he could see the thin veil of perspiration on her forehead, how she was swallowing and twisting her hands, but she was also resolute.
Quite frankly, it was none of John's business, but if they went to the bathroom he would see the broken mirror and Sherlock would be able to read the questions in John's eyes -- and answering them would require a strength he honestly couldn't muster at the moment.
When a private residence became a crime scene John could never shake a slight sense of uneasiness upon entering it. He felt like an intruder – he was neither a soldier nor a doctor (especially when there wasn’t any corpse). It was even worse that morning; because as much as Sherlock was looking like himself and his eyes had lost that hollow look in them, he was playing the game, he was doing exactly what Bennett and the people behind him wanted him to do. And he was not blind or stupid.
He got up from his chair and, as Sherlock had asked, went close to William Moore, to examine him. The paramedics had already patched him up and he didn’t have a concussion, nevertheless he should be in a hospital, to have MRI scans done and some heavy dose of pain killers.
He took the few steps that separated him from the man, fighting the impulse to snap at John for standing too close to him. John who had been willing to talk to Herman Bennett (breathe his same air,
And Mary was there, she was bleeding, she was taking a step back in the dark and he turned and John was there too.
Sherlock blinked. He had not expected that question. Herman Bennett would have killed her, he would have shot her through the head not caring about being caught; he had known it the moment he had seen the man for the first time.
He knew. He had seen that picture in Molly’s bedroom, he had noticed that she kept that picture on her bedside table, half hidden behind a pile of books and a box of Kleenex, but not as much that she wouldn’t see it if she wanted or needed to.
“What happened?” Mary asked, leading him away – and John couldn’t help but wonder whether Mary had just exploited his weakness, his frayed nerves and had let Sherlock see them. Or was he paranoid? It didn’t matter, though, because Mary was leading him away, linking her arm under his, her eyes full of concern.
Even those memories (1th February of 2010: John had made tea and sighed at the eyeballs still in the microwave, but hadn’t otherwise commented), the good ones with John needed to be kept under a tight lid. It was paramount. It was what would save John.
Mary’s left hand trembled, from that angle and distance, however, she could not miss.  It was impossible not to kill the target even while
“Mycroft is sending a car. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have an apology to make to a friend for exploiting her feelings.”
The wall he was looking at, sort of reminded him of the wall in their sitting room, except that it was bare now, at home. Sherlock was not bored, he was perfectly content with reading up cold cases and solving them with just a cursory glance at the files.
He would say if asked, that John and Mary’s first dance had been lovely (and it was the truth) but he would then stop at that.
"I inferred as much for the past fortnight, thank you!" Sherlock replied, his voice almost perfectly conveying the usual mixture of annoyance and boredom he usually had while talking to his brother.
Lestrade nodded. It was also their only lead, while Sherlock did what he usually did best: uncovered the truth and John and his newborn daughter were God knew where.
And round and round they went, they always found themselves under that gray sky, Sherlock on the ledge of that bloody rooftop and John watching him, listening to his words. To his lies. Unable to stop him.
Herman Bennett nodded his head. John had never noticed that he had long and surprisingly thin fingers, Sherlock would be proud to know that he had observed that he had bitten his nails, almost to the quick.
Sherlock let go of the knife he had been hiding and said, “I asked you how does it feel to be so close to what you wanted, knowing that you would not get it.”
Was Sherlock even aware of how he sounded? It was the tone of his voice, more than the words he said, or even the calm look on his face that had made Greg wish, more than once, that he had shot Bennett to the head. The fact that he wasn’t even supposed to have a gun to begin with and that he was not officially responsible for the shooting was something Greg chose to ignore.
Facts: Mary was getting weaker, the hand holding the gun was still steady, but she was leaning against the glass.
He hadn’t. Not really. He had seen Jim Moriarty die – he had seen him pull the trigger, he had replayed that scene in his mind countless times long before Herman Bennett had uttered those words and he had – frozen. But that was not what he had asked. He needed to be specific. He needed to
Mary nodded, even their facade of civility didn't go that far, it would look disingenuous if she showed more concern for the man who had spent part of the previous night with his hand wrapped around her husband's erected penis.
John blinked, resting his back against the chair. He shouldn’t be surprised, not really – Sherlock had put himself in the hands of a psycho cabbie the first day they had known each other, but – he hadn’t done things like that since his return. He hadn’t put himself on the line, hadn’t offered himself up to the first psychopath that crossed his way since his return.
That had been just the last in a long list of mistakes. It hardly mattered, now. He doubted that Mycroft would have the chance to gloat that time.
It was a waste of time, like always with those people. It had been a waste of time talking to Joan Adams, forcing her to talk for hours about her ordeal, it had been a waste of time trying to trace phone calls and bugs’ signals,  and it was a waste of time to be in that room.
Sherlock looked at him for a moment when they parted, and said, “But don’t think, not even for one moment that I did not want
"They weren't you," John said with a small smile. He didn't even care how insufferably trite those words sounded. It was the truth. And it was liberating. He wished he had understood that simple truth a lot earlier.
“He was our mole,” Sherlock said. He was being careful with his words as if it made any difference at that point; as if it could or would change the outcome.
He knew, though, that he would sell his soul, gladly, to have the chance to take back what he had told him that day. Their last true conversation shouldn’t have been
William nodded absentmindedly as he looked through the files: there was a memo, handwritten, signed by Mycroft Holmes.
He closed his eyes and when he opened them he was again, that time for real, in the cell, on the floor. Mary was stepping out of the cell.
One of the things he had had to endure  when Mycroft had tricked him into working for him had been physical training. He had resisted it, at first; he had always practiced martial arts after all; he had thought it would be a monumental waste of time. He had also thought he had been a good fighter, but Mycroft had not relented and the chance of solving puzzles had been too tantalizing, the siren call of cocaine too loud, therefore he had had to do as his brother had asked. He still resented him for that.
Baker Street was still a mess and Mrs. Hudson was not home when he got inside. She had taken everything in stride, accepting the check Mycroft had given her with a shrug of her shoulders and a practical attitude that never ceased to amaze him.
John showed him his mobile phone, there were two texts coming from different, unknown, and most probably untraceable numbers, the first one read, "The next will be broadcasted live!"
The bad news was that, according to Mary, or whichever the fuck her real name was, Sherlock did not have a plan. Which did not make sense because  Sherlock always had a contingency plan. Even if it was dumb, reckless and ended up breaking his heart – breaking both their hearts, actually.
“No.” Sherlock replied, his voice betraying the pain he was feeling when he helped him up. “It was not his point.”
Victor and how he, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, had destroyed everything because he was supposed not to get attached, because caring was not an advantage and his brain was on
Sherlock looked at him: there had been a contingency plan – there had been strategies involving Mary; her child (John’s daughter) was supposed to be safe. He had promised John that. He had given his word that they would try and save his daughter’s life.
John sat on the bed and the calm, the warmth of that room, of John's silence scared him, for a moment.
“No,” Sherlock answered. He could barely stand, but for the first time since they had met in that restaurant, she saw the man of the many tales she had read on the internet, the man he had read about on John’s blog and in his journal: pages upon pages about someone bigger than life, who shone brighter than the sun – even if the real thing had been different, in her experience. When she had finally met Sherlock, she had only seen a damaged man, someone who was clearly uncomfortable in his own skin.
Sherlock nodded imperceptibly at him and John did the same. For a moment he was sure Sherlock wanted to say something, maybe reassure him – but he didn’t; he kept his left hand on the envelope, he was at the door when he heard Sherlock say something in a voice so low that he couldn’t make out what he was saying.
hadn't he thought about that before?); Greg had thought  about the fact that even if there wasn’t a bomb inside the black box, it didn’t mean that they couldn’t have chosen other ways to hurt them, had they truly wished to do so. Somehow Greg doubted that was their immediate goal, though.
He remembered the man’s file, of course. He had already read it – but he had not known about Mary Morstan’s involvement in the current events, not the full extent of it. Yet, he couldn’t help going back to an element that had not sit well with him from the very first moment: why did they choose William Moore and Joan Adams for their little games?
Joan, bleeding, scarred, naked, surrounded by men who were obeying orders (dead, they were all dead, deleted, plucked out), a game he hated, his coat wrapped around her lean body (it hurt them both to move, but she was cold, and she was bleeding, and she had his name carved all over her skin, and his throat had gagged, for a moment, a fleeting second, that had felt excruciatingly long) and Joan asking about William, closing her eyes, being strong and bleeding in his arms.
John didn’t move, he was too numb, for some reason, to do anything, except swallowing hard, licking his lips (he still tasted Sherlock) and say, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to...”
Mycroft didn’t seem surprised by Sherlock’s words. But then again, he had just taken a look at the ciphered message; he supposed it was child’s play for both Sherlock and Mycroft. Sherlock was still looking at his brother and his voice dropped when he said, “And I’ll need the pictures as well, Mycroft.”
Oxygen deprivation, whatever was inside those boxes – or whatever would happen to John when he got out of his cage. John definitely was not the one who ought to apologise.
He had a text from Sherlock Holmes  with a name, a telephone number and the assurance that the person he would contact owed him their life and had ways of finding out things that might be useful.
Sherlock was sitting on the floor, hugging his knees against his chest, his head hidden in his palms.
He was alive, he was walking under a pouring rain, he had nowhere to go and he could not go home. Too much had been said and done.
He let Molly, who was wearing gloves now, take the plastic bag with Victor’s finger. He took the mobile phone from the plastic bag.
Mary laughed at his words. She was not mocking him, hers was a genuine laugh; as if he had said something hilarious.
“Is that why you looked relieved when he lashed out at me?” David asked, he took another sip from his mug.
He could not help rolling his eyes when he saw the picture hidden below the magnets, held up by the deer stalker one: it was his grave, the black headstone with golden letters, an empty grave –  a piece of rock that as far as he knew had not been removed.
It was a soft touch of lips at first, that was how Sherlock silenced him, and John’s heartfelt trapped in his chest – it was too much, it was
Killing two birds with one stone had been Mycroft's plan: lull Mary (or  whatever her real name was, because neither Mycroft, John or he believed a word about what they had found in the usb drive) into a false sense of security, get into Appledore with a Trojan horse, arrest Magnussen, deal with Mary.
The man actually laughed at his words and said, “Oh, no – I’m not disappointed. At all. I was told you’d react with silence, I just didn’t want to believe it.”
What he would remember were sounds and smells that he would always associate with those few days, even much later, when things became crystal clear.
Mary had not divided them. She had not won, unlike what Sherlock sometimes said, especially in the first days after her death.
Sherlock had been awake when he had come back to their bedroom, checking his mobile phone, not even looking at him when he said, “You know? I think I actually liked Anderson better when he pretended to hate me.”
John recoiled at Mycroft’s words, he couldn’t help it. The idea of that man being anywhere near Sherlock again, after what he had done, made his blood boil with rage – it made him wish that whoever had taken Bennett down in that basement had killed him, and he didn’t care about the other victims, he didn’t care about justice and morality.
There were four agents outside her door. She listened to their words and nodded. They were bringing her somewhere for questioning. Which was an elegant way to say that they would let her rot in a secret facility somewhere or they would kill her the moment she gave birth to her daughter?
as Sherlock would argue?), he had indeed called Sherlock because he had known that those bastards would have found other ways, even more personal or painful for both the victims and the consulting detective to draw him out or some innocent sod might end up with their eyelids peeled off and it might also be broadcasted on every screen of the country, like they had threatened to do with Joan Adams; that, after all, had been just one of the
He could not afford the luxury of losing himself, not again. His weakness would result in John’s death – and that could not, would
“480 minutes and you lost two pints of blood, Sherlock. One and half in his basement, the rest was stagnating in your belly.”
"Do you want me to pretend that I was surprised? That I didn't see it coming? That I didn't know that it was only a matter of time before you chose him over me for good?"
"A lot better, thank you for asking," Sherlock replied, nodding at John who, immediately after, got up from his chair  and went to the kitchen.
They had talked about a lot of things, but he knew what the man was referring to: John had asked him, urged him to play a different game, to change tactics. John had said he could not live without him. And he had believed him. He had.
He focused on the tall man, ignoring his own thoughts. They would not help him bring John and his daughter back. And that was the only thing that mattered.
“Yes. She packed a bag with a change of clothes for me; she’ll bring it along later today.” John said, his voice absolutely devoid of any emotion.
Facts: Sherlock had knifed himself on the side, he was bleeding – and he couldn’t move, for some reason.
There, he had said the name, in their sitting room, the name of a man whose existence he had ignored until a few hours before. Sherlock placed his cup of tea on the small coffee table next to him and said, “What about him?”
That was their bedroom, John reasoned. That was Sherlock and him at the end of yet another day. He placed the things he had brought from the bathroom on the chair in front of the bed and said, "I'm ready when you are."
Sherlock Holmes still believed that his life was somehow less important than John’s own – and John could only  hope that a lifetime together would be enough to disabuse him from that bunch of bullshit.
It was possibly the same people who had hacked every single server in the country and plastered Jim Moriarty’s face everywhere. It was the same people who thought nothing of shooting people in the middle of the streets, and having a former MI6 with a vest filled with explosives strapped to his chest while his fiancé got kidnapped or a  civil driving to Baker Street with a car filled with semtex.
. She didn’t even need to specify whom she wanted to talk to. She was one of the few who had direct contact with Mr. Neal, the people there were all aware of that.
It was his daughter. They hadn't even settled on a name, yet. There were toys in the nursery, but not a crib -- he hadn't got around to assemble one.
He was scared, he didn’t think he could be more scared than during the eight hours Sherlock had been in Bennett’s hands, but he had been wrong. He didn’t wait for either man to talk, he steeled himself and got inside Sherlock’s room; half hoping to find him up and about, trying to get dressed to leave the hospital, he was almost disappointed when he saw him in his bed, quietly reading his medical chart, while another open folder was on his legs.
He shook his head, “No. I knew, rationally, that I was not infected, the autopsy on Mr. Bennett showed that he was clean…” His mouth twitched, he swallowed and added, “Nevertheless, I was relieved when I read the results.”
"Why do you keep hurting your hand?" John softly asked, and that question surprised Sherlock. It was not what he had expected John to ask him.
Mary wondered what was that man’s real name. It was the first time she did. For a long time, the handsome man in front of her had just been a nickname on a computer screen and the sender of disposable phones which came to her through the strangest  channels. They had only communicated through text, even with the phones – and yet he had proved her that she could trust him. He had kept his word so far, she had noticed that since the very beginning: he always kept his word with everyone, whether it was friends or enemies.
She had just opened his cage. He would have rolled his eyes at that puerile, petty trick if only moving hadn’t become so hard. John was awake, he had tilted his head on a side and he had seen how much pain that gesture had caused him; it was clear he had a concussion and the bullet was slowly but surely making its way through his body, but he had not given up.
He was smiling. They both were. And the scars still ran deep, and he was sure they would fight and they would bicker and revert, sometimes, to their old patterns because they were two idiots.
I'm actually quite nervous about this part - and what's to come. Hope you all like it! (and read the tags, just in case!)
He opened the box, blinking twice at the sight of the two objects in it: a blue collar with a bell at the end of it and a framed picture.
“Of course. You have always had a choice, both of you. Sherlock always chose you, at every turn. You?” Mary smiled, and her smile was genuine, “You
They knew that a woman who looked like Mary, according to witnesses,  had paid in cash for a man’s funeral, a man Sherlock had killed while he had been away. The fact that Sherlock had had to kill people in order to get rid of Moriarty’s legacy had not exactly surprised him, but it had made so many things clearer: how Sherlock had become more careful, how he had finally learned to call for back up, how he had been more forthcoming - at least until the day he had followed Herman Bennett to save Alyce Bradford.
The image was surprisingly clear and not in black and white: there was – a man, wearing a ski mask and sunglasses. The background was completely white, it was – familiar, in a way, similar to what they had done with Joan, but that hadn’t stopped him, he had found the woman, eventually.
Part of him wanted to lash out at John, wanted to tell him that he wasn't about to turn into a romanticized version of himself just because he was in love with him. He was a bastard, he manipulated people, he was selfish. He was not a good man. John should be aware of that.
The man didn’t volunteer any more information and Lestrade didn’t push for it, especially when the man got another message.
If he wanted to survive and get out of that room, if he wanted to gain the information he needed, he would have to focus, to clear his mind! He needed to
Mycroft always claimed that caring was a dangerous disadvantage. It had been something he had repeated ad nauseam and, even if he would never admit it to him, he knew that his brother was rarely wrong.
Yet he was already opening the box- because they were playing, they had been playing for weeks and John was in the kitchen making coffee and he realised that he had refused to meet his eyes ever since Mycroft had arrived.
“I am here,” John said. He should have said it a long time before. He should have said and done more. He should have seen that Sherlock was coming undone long before discovering about Eurus.
There was also a note in the box, Sherlock read it aloud, tempted to shout at everyone to just back off and let him
Nevertheless pictures could be useful, he was aware of that. He could tell a lot from single snapshot, of course; he could tell that the first unknown victim (female, late twenties, placed on the second row on the wall in Bennett’s smallroom, had been the first one killed: clerk, left handed, dog lover, smoker, lesbian) had been killed quickly, the picture had been mostly for show, meant to be found and seen. He could say that the picture had been taken in a warehouse and he could say exactly where she had been killed, but – he did
“How dramatic,” Mary said, replying to his question, “I prefer to call it a fair trade. Pick one –“ She indicated the boxes on the trolley with a look, “and I’ll open John’s door.”
“You may – but he still should have told me about the text. Perhaps, we might have done something before Mary poisoned herself and shipped Catherine God knows where.” He snapped.
Looking back, though, he was sure it began on a crime scene. It started with a flinch on a crime scene. Moriarty or whoever had broadcasted that message was still at large, that didn’t mean that London criminals had stopped killing, stealing or
He took the keys from his pocket: six small keys for six cases: the cases were not unlike those sent to him for the past few days. They were custom made – which, was useless information, at that point.
– he had just smashed his face against the table, he had broken his nose, knocked out teeth, he was bleeding, but that hadn’t changed the look in his eyes. He had won.
“Shall I sign a nondisclosure agreement? Should we shake hands?” He asked. And he was proud of the casual tone of his voice, how laced with boredom it was. He was really getting better at that.
Sherlock did not deny his words, they were past the point of that and part of John couldn’t believe that it was really happening, that he had really said the words, and the world hadn’t ended, his heart was still beating, Sherlock was still there, gripping his wrist (and it would be completely
Mycroft smiled, but shook his head, “I was aware of what the consequences of my actions would be that day, John – and my brother has more pressing matters to attend right now.”
As plans went it was not his best, the most cunning or clever he had ever had, but he had got tired of running in circles throughout America’s Midwest. His previous contact had given him precise coordinates and he had spent time and money to get there, therefore he would have his answers. He would do what he needed to do.
What he had suggested was cruel – it was a form of manipulation that only a Holmes could come up with, it was – making his temples throb and eyes sting and his throat become dry and taste like sand and blood.
The man laughed and even though he heard in his voice that he was not underestimating his threat – he had never underestimated him, apparently, he had been on his radar long before that day, he didn’t sound particularly concerned when he said, “Take the third pill, Mr. Holmes.”
He cast a glance at Sherlock's coat hanging on a chair in the room: it was dirty with Joan's blood, it had been too large on her, but he had appreciated the gesture. That didn't mean that Sherlock Holmes didn't still owe him. He owed him a true explanation, he wanted to know whom exactly they were dealing with. He owed him to be part of the plan to bring those people down.
They were watching them. It wasn’t surprising and they were right: Sherlock’s visual was blocked. Mycroft had ensured Sherlock’s protection, it wouldn’t be long until he realised what was truly going on.
He shook his head. That was – not what he had expected. Sherlock started to walk, without turning; he was unsteady on his feet, but he kept going.
That was when Molly Hooper really started to be afraid. Up until then she had been worried about Sherlock, but she had taken the measures to ensure her protection in stride. She was grateful for them, now.
After Chicago, things hadn't become easier, he had just got better at being what he was supposed to be: a machine. Except when the John in his mind was too loud  or he refused to get high on cocaine because he wanted to go
Not that sleeping would have been high on his list of priorities anyway, not with so many things still to do. The good thing about Mycroft Holmes deciding to take over the investigation was that he wouldn’t have to deal with the bloody paperwork. He knew, from experience, that he would be given reports and statements to sign and, for once, he was glad to comply.
“What it matters,” Sherlock said, after what it felt like hours of silence – even if it couldn’t have been more than a second, “is that they knew we would all be in the same room and they know our phone numbers.”
He wanted those people to be put down before it got even more personal for all of them – and there was only one man who could do that: Sherlock Holmes.
The first things John had noticed when he had entered the couple’s flat, was how much it had been home for them: everything, from the mismatched furniture, to the books and dvds, the knickknacks and framed pictures on the walls told him how much William Moore and Joan Adams loved that bright, tidy flat.
She wanted to say something, he knew that even without looking at her, she had minutely tensed at his words, it took her almost a second longer than it would normally take before she said, “Yes, sir,” and left his office, her head held high, her posture perfect. She knew better than being hurt by Sherlock’s words or by his dismissal.
he had not wanted to, because it had been hard enough to pretend he could live without Sherlock, talking about the things of his nightmares would have made it impossible. And Greg had been a friend, he had made him smile, even if those smiles had been fake, even if he always ended up drinking himself to sleep whenever he got home after a night at the pubs with Greg.
“You already said that. Stop boring me! I killed your husband, Mary: two agents forced him to his knees after he understood there was no way out – I knew he wouldn’t sell me out, I knew he didn’t care about me or about Moriarty, but I shot him anyway. I had to.”
The thumb had not been cut post mortem. At least, there was that. If the shock of the amputation hadn't killed
Mycroft had estimated it would take him a year  and a half to complete the job, but Sherlock knew – because unlike his lazy brother he had been traveling nonstop since the day after his “funeral”, that it would take more. Much more. Provided, of course, that he would survive the current situation.
Irene nodded. She immediately went back to her mobile phone and started typing and William knew she would keep helping because - because she knew how much John Watson mattered to Sherlock.
“Yes,” Victor said. It was the truth, the man was still unable to lie. He was still sincere to a fault.
“I’m still curious about Moriarty’s message on New Year’s Eve...” Sherlock said, finally sliding to the floor.
When Sherlock had almost collapsed in Molly’s office he had feared that – they had got Sherlock somehow, that he had touched something  in Herman Bennett’s cell and he had been poisoned. He had feared that it was the punishment  because Mycroft knew the truth. Sherlock had reassured him right away that he had worn gloves, that it wasn’t poison.
Mr. Neal smiled; there was nothing cold or calculated in his smile or in the look in his eyes, but appearances were deceiving; Mary knew for a fact, having witnessed the way he molded people exactly into what he wanted them to be or do. She had seen how the bare skeleton of a plan had become a reality. She knew that Mr. Neal was a cold, ruthless, mean motherfucker.
The man didn’t talk. The other man tilted his head on a side and said, “We will see again Mr. Holmes, but that’s all you are going to get for now.”
John  didn’t step back from Sherlock, he only lowered his hand and turned, greeting Mycroft saying, “What took you so long?”
"Think it over," Mary said, she took her purse from the armrest of the chair, "I'll ring you tomorrow to let you know about the scan and we'll talk."
“For the record, Mr Holmes, I want you to know that I did not sanction or approve what Herman did to you. I expressly told him to go easy on you.” The man said. He sounded sincere. Against his better judgement Sherlock believed him.
“It wasn’t.” Sherlock said, and his lips had lost that cruel curl, his voice was soft and John was sure he could hear a hint of regret in it. “Fine and good, that is.”
Agent Harris had assured him that Lestrade was fine, that he had not been harmed in any way and Sherlock realised that he had not asked that question
They had to find a way to get out of there – if Mary wanted to play he would, it would buy time. Even a second could make the difference, at that point.
Victor was not a bad person. That much Sherlock knew. He was smart, which had come as a surprise to Sherlock; meeting someone whose brain wasn't completely atrophied or whose size didn't resemble a walnut had been oddly refreshing.
a talk about forgiveness and moving on?” Mary said. She was tilting her head on a side, and he frankly loathed the way she was addressing him – as if she was better than him, as if whatever he had done (he suspected – and he frankly didn’t
Sherlock let out a sound, a very good impression of an exasperated sigh, “I thought we were past lying. And you don’t strike me as someone who lies to herself.”
“You’ve been saying that a lot, and yet here you are,” Mary replied, “not a shred of a plan, no protection detail – sorry, by the way, they’re toast – no weapons. You just had to save John, didn’t you?”
“Yes, yes it is.” Mr. Neal replied, “and don’t worry about Mycroft Holmes. Everything is under control.”
The last time he had been in that room  had been when Sherlock had escaped from the hospital, after being shot.
"One." The man said and grinned, again, "Liar! Sherlock must tell you of what I told him once I got him on his knees sometimes - best blow job of my life, mate!"
And there was something else: the mole was protecting someone (wife? Daughter?) by not setting off a chain of events that would cause his death anyway. He saw it all in the man’s eyes and face, he saw the resignation set in, he saw that he chose to surrender. He saw the loss and regret crossing his features.
John rolled his eyes, choosing not to look at the screen. Part of him was still hoping that Sherlock and Mycroft were in cohorts, again, and were deceiving him. He hoped that what he had seen in Sherlock ever since Mycroft had given them the news of Mary’s kidnapping was just an act.
“He is trying to protect you…” John said, realizing that it had been the wrong thing to say the second the words had left his mouth.
Sherlock had not replied to that. But John saw – and God, he wished he didn’t – what he wanted to say, how he wanted to dash that man’s gratitude. He didn’t because – he was a good man. He had always been a good man, trapped in fractured memories and a lifetime of lies his family told him to protect his heart.
“That’s not going to happen, Sherlock.” John said. And he meant it. Even without taking into account the emotional consequences of the eight hours spent with Bennett, Sherlock was recovering from surgery and what Bennett had done to him.
It took one look at agent Drake – a man he had personally chosen to protect Sherlock when the new players had finally revealed themselves through Herman Bennett – and the man knew exactly what he had to do.
Sherlock nodded. He knew that John had questions, but he wasn’t going to ask any in that room, not while his hands were still gripping the edges of the wash-basin.
Mycroft didn't even look up from the file he had been reading and said, "We need more data. Here..." He said handing him a manila  folder, "See if someone is missing."
The first time it happened he was torn away from the nightmare with such force, that he almost didn't make it in time to the bathroom to throw up.
“Can – can you stop being dead?” John asked and he was shivering with post orgasmic chills, and he didn’t care that it was a dream, that he would wake up soon.
– usually kept carefully under wraps. It was petty, perhaps – but his brother could be childish and if it could help him, then so be it.
“No, it’s not....” Sherlock said sharply. They had lived together, they had shared a bed, they had shagged and made love. Of course, they had had a relationship!
“Fine.” He said after a moment. Unlike Victor he was an excellent liar; second only to Mycroft. He did not care, one way or another, about what people thought, about what his own family thought, but Victor –
and their loved ones; I can mourn her in my own free time.” He rummaged in the pockets of his jacket and handed him his card, and smiled at him, “Take it, just in case.”
He was responsible for many people’s death. One or two more would not make a lot of difference in the grand scheme of things.
It was clear by how quickly the drugs had taken a hold on Sherlock’s body and the fact that neither the sheet of paper nor the pills had been there the night before that, as the late Herman Bennett and the two men responsible for Janine Hawkins’ death had said repeatedly
Moriarty had threatened to burn the heart out of Sherlock that night at the pool. Those people – they wanted to
Her phone calls were monitored, so were her e-mails and her internet history. Not that she had expected anything less from Mycroft Holmes. She also knew that her flat was thoroughly checked weekly, it had been for months: the people who did it were good, but she was, to put it simply, better.
Sherlock cocked an eyebrow but didn’t comment on Lestrade’s words. Four highly trained operatives had been killed just a few hours earlier and Lestrade who didn’t even carry a gun (no, he was carrying one, he noticed, an unlicensed firearm, the same one he had used to shoot Herman Bennett in the basement) had chosen to stay in that office, with Molly.
Sherlock sighed and put the mobile phone in the pocket of his coat, John noticed that the gesture made him grimace for a moment, but didn’t comment on it. There would be time, later.
John had thought he knew Sherlock’s silences: the stroppy ones, the ones that hid flashes of genius and danger, the quiet ones, in the months before he fell, where John had thought that he could live the rest of his life with that mad man and he would be happy, because life was good. Perfect.
“I used to blame you for this. For everything, actually.” Victor said, after a moment of silence. And part of him wanted to leave that room, talking to Victor about a relationship failed decades before would not save John, it would not help find him and yet he couldn’t move a muscle.
He was too busy thinking about a picture of two men kissing, clinging onto each other, just outside that room, without lies, pretences, blindness and alibis. He was too busy thinking that whoever had sent those pictures had fucked with Sherlock for the last time, because he would tear London apart, the whole world apart before he let them anyone hurt him again.
The images were clear – Sherlock was on his third viewing of the few seconds that had been caught on camera: the vehicle Mary was riding in, escorted by four men, had been ambushed  on the way to the facility where she would be held until the baby was born. The impact had been calculated not to kill the people on the passenger seat. The people who had come out from the black van had acted quickly, they were clearly used to similar kind of operations: they had killed the four agents and taken Mary.
one last time. Because John had already endured too much because of him and he could, at least, give him that: a goodbye without heartache, without cold fingers trying to find a pulse that wasn’t there, even if it was a trick, and knees giving out. He could give him another chance, a better chance at happiness.
John hesitated for a moment; he looked at Sherlock, who was still sitting on the bed, whose left hand was still above the yellow envelope. John hadn’t left the hospital since Sherlock had been brought in; Mrs. Hudson had brought him some of the spare clothes he kept at Baker Street, telling him that Mary had brought his stuff there – and he had only half listened to her words about it. And Sherlock hadn’t objected to his presence in the hospital but he hadn’t taken it for granted, either. He knew the difference with him.
It is also the longest piece of writing I've ever done...and I have no idea how long it will be at the end:)
He still couldn’t ignore the gut feeling that it was too easy: for all he knew the cellar could be wrapped in Semtex or they could be gassed out of existence as soon as they got that door open.
He saw, however, a spark of something  - that wicked glee he had shown  while talking to Sherlock when he looked at him.
Sherlock was holding up remarkably well under the circumstances. Sherlock must surely know he was there, in the building, possibly in the next room. Sherlock hadn’t pushed as much as he could have under other circumstances, but Mycroft conceded there wasn’t enough time and that was not the right place.
"How many still to go?" John asked, and he was surprised by his own words: they came out harsher than he had meant, more judgmental. And he – bloody hell, he sounded like a git!
bedroom now, looking at her wedding photos, she traced with the pad of her fingers John's face, first...and then Sherlock's.
He would not tell a soul about the best man’s speech, he would not tell anyone that Sherlock had asked for his help because he hadn't had the first clue about what to say in his speech, and Greg had only told him that he ought to tell the truth, to tell the good and the embarrassing stories about John, about their adventures together.
There had been a 200 seconds blackout in the CCTV feeds. Drake informed him of that fact while they were in front of the white van and, most importantly, the house from which three men had got out carrying an unconscious John.
Mycroft was not with him, he had assured him that a car would be waiting for him when he was done collecting Sherlock’s things and those had been the only words the man had said. He hadn’t felt like talking either. There were too many things he wanted to ask, to many things he wanted to know and he had instinctively known that Mycroft would not or could not answer his questions.
Sherlock’s fingers brushed against his skin and John shivered – with want, with everything that the man had become to him.
“He is paranoid about not being discovered, in the long run that could become an advantage. My guess is that he has a legitimate, profitable business.”
Answers: he had known Mary was buying time, he had suspected Catherine was not in the house, he had not used the knife on Mary because of the baby; he had hoped to have information, to understand whether she was close or not.
John’s legs gave out. He would not – could not crumble down. He needed to be strong – Sherlock would need his help soon.
She had always been good at her job, but that time she had been excellent. That said when she heard the doorbell ringing she couldn’t help being surprised for a moment. She had expected a reaction from Sherlock after the events of that day; it was only logical. She knew what would happen in the next few minutes, yet she took her time finishing to drink her chamomile tea. She rinsed the cup in the sink before going to the door. Things would become quite hectic very soon, but until then she would keep up her façade. It was one of the rules. It was how she had survived.
"Tell me, John, would it make you feel better if I told you that I'm angry? Would it change anything? Should I play the part of the scorned woman?" Mary asked, "Would it be more acceptable?"
He tilted a hand up, resting it on the side of Sherlock’s neck. It was still bruised, the marks on his pale skin had faded somewhat but they were still there, yet he was not hesitant, feeling that Sherlock would not react well to a tentative touch, not in that moment.
Mycroft smiled and Sherlock thought, for a moment, about that first night at the hospital, after the basement; he had said things that night, words that hadn't made sense to his own ears or brain, but Mycroft had
Sherlock looked at John. He seemed calm, composed. He was pale. He had not had any rest. They had been still in bed when Mycroft had come, bringing them the news of Mary’s kidnapping.
“What time is it?” Sherlock asked. He felt John tensing next to him and Molly let out something that, he was sure was a, “what the fuck?”
“I didn’t notice him leaving –” Molly said and there was a hint of genuine surprise in her voice as she said those words.
He wanted to touch Sherlock, but he had seen how his fingers had twitched just a few moments before, it had been a reaction to the nearness of his hand; neither had moved their hands on the bed, they were still close, Sherlock hadn’t moved his hand away, but John didn’t want to startle him, instead he chose to look at the man, who was tilting his head on a side, realization dawning in as he said, “Thank you.”
“Oh, I see.” Sherlock said in a scathing tone of voice, “He thinks he has leverage. The seven bodies and Moriarty.”
Good question: how did it feel? End of the road, after years of planning, of recruiting nutjobs who saw Jim Moriarty as their Messiah, of playing a role within another role and now there was just blood: Sherlock’s, John’s, hers. It could not have gone differently.
He had of course noticed the pigmentation in the Plexiglas wall on his right side, thinking it could be altered remotely.  It did not matter, however, because John was there. He had not measured time since they had been separated, it would have been – a lot of not good. But it felt like it had been ages since he had last seen him, since they had gone back to Baker Street.
Mycroft nodded, apparently satisfied by his words. John noticed that a black car had approached, a moment later Anthea came out of it, carrying an umbrella. “I will come back later today.” Mycroft said, he seemed to search for the right words, which was unprecedented and caught John’s attention, eventually in a low voice added, “You are Sherlock’s pressure point, but you are also his greatest strength. Even now. Especially now, I think. Try to remember that.”
Sherlock with a shock blanket around his shoulders, gauzes dripping with blood all over his naked torso, black and red bruises on his neck, his clothes on that dirty floor and people fussing around him in that smelly room.
what was inside that box; his senses were working just fine! He had smelled the stale water (not as bad as in Herman Bennett's basement, but it reminded him of Serbia, for some reason) and the very beginning of decomposition.
Sherlock was pacing the sitting room, downstairs. He was not being loud as not to wake Rosie up, but he had lived with the man. He recognized the sounds he was making. He had missed those noises.
to do what you did," John said, and he sounded sincere, there was also a hint of true forgiveness in his voice.
They didn't say a word on the way out. He felt like the world had tilted on its axis, because Sherlock had said that he didn't want to live in a world without him in it, because Herman Bennett had somehow threatened him and Sherlock had protected him, had kept him safe --- and he had new bruises to prove it.
He blinked his eyes – he was surprised by how calm he was feeling, seeing John – had centered him. As ever – John Watson kept him right. It had happened while he was away from London, away from him, and it was happening again.
John’s phone was switched on; it was not password protected, John had always thought it was impractical. He realised as he sat in the car, holding that mobile in his hands, that he had never seen its contents; he had used it on various occasions, of course, but he did not know what John kept in it.
That was war, Herman Bennett had been right and  he had met similar men before: he had hunted them down, cornered them, deceived them – killed them and at the time it hadn’t been as personal as it was now.
People had gossiped, whispered, incorrectly inferred and assumed things about them and their relationship, there had been tabloids articles and blog posts about them – but they had not been like that between them. Hadn’t it?
Sherlock would fall for the trap. He would do what he had done when Joan was kidnapped and John threatened. He would not hesitate,  he was absolutely certain of that.
There was a link in the text. He exchanged a glance with John who nodded his head and Sherlock clicked on it.
Sherlock barely refrained from rolling his eyes as he got inside the house. He had observed the house on two separate occasions already; he had been informed that there hadn’t been any active surveillance on the house since razaranje had been a go; as far as he knew no one had got into the house for at least a week, yet there was a reason if he had been asked to go there, if he had been asked to start from that house.
He hadn’t noticed how red rimmed John’s eyes were, Greg was taken aback by the look in John’s eyes for a moment; the doctor had kept a tight lid over his emotions for the past however many hours they had been up, trying to stop Bennett. There was something naked, vulnerable in John’s eyes while he was looking at him, asking him – he didn’t know what, exactly.
The first thing he noticed when he got inside Sherlock’s room – after the two guards searched him, even if he was on the list and he had already met them – was the silence. The telly was on, broadcasting the news of Joan Adams’ kidnapping, but neither Sherlock nor John were talking or moving, for that matter. The second thing he noticed was that they were sitting on the same bed, and he tried very hard not to pay attention to the fact that Sherlock was holding John’s hand. He was dressed: white shirt, black suit, his face clean-shaven (he was too pale, though. And was he sleeping at all?), the only outward signs of what had happened to him were the white gauze wrapped around his right hand and the faded bruises on his neck and face.
"There is something you need to see." She said. And she sounded scared. And Greg definitely didn't like
He had been in Mycroft Holmes’ bunker a couple of times before, both times because of Sherlock. The first time had been shortly after Sherlock had overdosed, a few months after he had started popping up on his crime scenes, causing havoc and being a brilliant bugger who solved crimes within minutes and reduced his co-workers to either tears or fits of rage.
His watch was missing too. He could not say how long it had been since he had taken the last pill in Mary’s bedroom. It was puerile to think of that room in those terms, but it was also the truth.
Pleasurable and slightly degrading, just like he had hoped it would be, especially when the man (he settled on Darren for the name) began panting
