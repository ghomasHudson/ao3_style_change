The white blanket smells like mild detergent, and feels like the nights that his parents were away on a trip, and Jarvis would let him fall asleep in his and Ana’s bed. It’s warm, like the time life was not a tangled mess of pain and tiptoeing around, comforting like the herbal aroma of the liquid in the cup that Nat brings up to his lips. Safe, like the air in this room, the natural wood furniture and the white sheets, abundance of light that spills in from these large curtainless window.
Tony snaps out of the baby scent haze, when Ty squeezes his arm with one hand and his fingers with the other. He looks at Ty, who is not looking at him, and then looks at their guest. Captain Rogers is in fact looking at Tony, at least for a few short seconds, and Tony might be making this up but his eyes are a little worried. Tony can’t quite figure out why, and it doesn’t really matter anyway, because Captain Rogers is now looking at Ty again, continuing his infomercial about his charity,
Tony leans forward and kisses Steve’s cheek before reading the next question. “Sexy maid or sexy doctor?”
He should start talking now. He should reason or plead. He should even beg, although he never has before, because he just can’t go back. It's just not an option anymore. He has come so far, he is almost out, he can’t let it slip away like this.
“What are you talking about? We have plenty of water here, and rescue’s gonna be here very soon.” Steve doesn’t sound reassuring, even to himself.
“That… the shot… maybe … not a good idea. I don’t know… I could search and check but… well, probably not.” He keeps his gaze at the back of his hand for a second and then looks up at Bruce who is not looking at Tony’s hand anymore.
I’m surprised I didn’t see it coming. Or that he didn’t leave the water on or something.” He sighs and breathes a few times, before turning to Steve, and God, his face is so fucking tired. “Look, I’m sorry, I really should not have asked you to come. I think, maybe, you should go if you want to, I'll manage this, somehow, it’s not like—”
“I know, I see it, this is completely crazy. We haven’t even done the sex thing properly, and I am so sorry, but I want to do … that, God, Steve, I want to do everything with you.”
Steve pushes the SI evening meeting up to 5 PM and ignores Nat’s fortieth call for the day, hoping there is nothing to add to what they had discussed in so much detail over the previous thirty-nine.
“I am not afraid of being rejected, Jarvis. I have had my fair share of rejections in life. More than fair. My own father never liked me.”
He tries to speak to Tony the second time he drops by his room with a cup of freshly made coffee, but all the rehearsed words run away from him, the moment Tony holds Steve by his waist and rubs his cheek on Steve’s stomach, his goatee tickling Steve’s skin through the fabric of his t-shirt. He tugs Steve down to kiss his nose, and Steve doesn’t even remember what he was going to say when Tony finally lets go of Steve’s fingers a minute or two after he picks up his next video call.
Steve taps on Nat’s caller ID photo and reads through all of the messages. He wonders if he is still asleep or if Nat has decided to message in some sort of code because none of the messages make any sense. He looks at Tony who is now off the phone and his defeated and miserable expression does not make any sense either.
“Mr. Barnes,” Tony mumbled, as he stretched his hand and watched the blue-eyed alpha grab his hand and shake it, a little too firmly.
He thinks about Rhodey who will no doubt become a captain someday. A colonel even, because he is fucking brilliant. He thinks about the Malibu house and the top shelf of the closet in his childhood room, how he would kill to get his hand on that black box before someone buys the house and movers start to pack their things. About Pepper and how he has been missing her so much, especially the past few weeks. How he wishes he could just call and listen to her rant about her idiot boss, how the fucking alpha is so handsy she had almost kicked his ass a couple of times, and how her new shoes are pinching her feet but look absolutely adorable.
Steve is shaking from head to toe, inside and out, every inch of every nerve exposed and trembling. He can’t hold on to any last bit of composure anymore, any dignity, any decency, provided he had some left, as he comes, falls apart, cries, and keeps trembling and coming and crying, as nothing makes sense, and everything is unreal, except for the tension that is leaving Steve’s body in catastrophic sways of pleasure, so forceful that they might, hopefully, make Steve disappear altogether.
He is from an old Earth colony, and he’d only gotten accepted into Starfleet Academy to study the Essential Interstellar Affairs as a gesture of goodwill from the Federation to improve their relationship with New Brooklyn. Steve himself wouldn’t even be accepted if the original height and weight eligibility conditions were not found discriminatory a few decades back. But right now, he is a Starfleet captain, on his way to command a groundbreaking flagship so he
He’s sitting on the floor, in the corner of the room, shaking, and he is staring at something Tony can’t see, but he can imagine is not a happy or fun image. Tony takes a number of deep breaths to calm down before walking over to Steve because there is no chance he can help Steve in an apparent panic attack if he starts having one himself. He kneels before Steve and reaches over to touch him, as gently as he possibly can with the way his heart is racing in his chest. He is relieved that Steve doesn’t fight his touch or look worse or more disturbed.
“Excellent, sweetheart, you’re doing so good. Now let’s step sideways,” Tony whispers, his voice getting muffled by the song. It’s just wondrous, Steve thinks, as he does his best to follow Tony and keep his eyes on him. How Steve’s life had been happening within a rosy hue these past several days, despite all the horrible things that are happening all around, how all it takes for every single word to turn into a love song is for Tony to press Steve to his heart; to hold him close and hold him fast.
He is grateful for not collapsing as he goes through the hallway and walks up the stairs. He also smiles at the image of comedic horror in Captain Rogers’ eyes as Tony marches out of the room.
Tony laughs and his laugh lines deepen. Steve swallows at the sight, happy that he can conveniently pretend it’s something he has been chewing.
He pulls back to look into Steve’s eyes. “I love you, Steve. I love your pretty face and your ridiculously kind soul and the fire that’s been burning deep inside you, for, wow, a century. I love you, inside and out. I fucking asked you to move in with me an hour ago, there is no chance in hell that I’d let you go
that he is, on the other hand, makes him feel like curling into a ball or slipping under the table. Or disappearing altogether.
“I’m sorry,” he mutters under his breath and forces himself to open his eyes, right in time, just as Dr. Stark tilts his head to look at him.
, let alone doing things the American way, whatever the hell that means these days. There was half a chance, maybe, when you were only Tony Stark, the sweetest, most caring person I’ve ever met, but Iron Man?” he sniffles, and his breath stutters. “Impossible.”
Captain Rogers talks about his charity as the entree is served. He goes on about the shelter in Brooklyn over the orange braised chicken and explains his plans for their facility in upstate New York that is still under development as he finishes the risotto.
They have dinner together, as no one’s available to hassle Tony on the phone. It goes mostly in silence though, because Tony is exhausted and Steve apparently finds it impolite to speak as he eats. Tony makes another mental note to make sure he spends some time - without food - with Steve tomorrow, and smiles to hide his disappointment when Steve stands up to clear his plate and go to bed, at 6:45 PM.
“Well, right now she is trying to resolve the issues I’ve created again for everyone by having a fucking life. I am a reckless billionaire no matter what, who goes around and gropes people in elevators during a pandemic not yet declared.” He pinches the bridge of his nose and shakes his head, half-mocking, half actually sad.
He truly wanted Steve, with the way he was caressing the bitemark, so gently, making Steve whimper, and how he was holding onto Steve so tight that he couldn’t get away even if he wanted to. Steve did
He kisses Steve’s hair and pulls the covers over them as joy bubbles up within his chest and spills over his skin like tiny sparks. It’s
Steve turns over his shoulder to look at him before he turns back to catch the last seconds of the video. “For a guy who has a crush on Captain America, you sound extremely judgmental, Mr. Stark.”
“JARVIS is galaxies smarter than me Rogers, so by all means, I’m glad you think that highly of my work.”
“Yes, Steve, of course I’m interested,” he finally says, unhappy with how empty the words are but he’s not quite sure how he’s supposed to sound. All he knows is that he’s interested in keeping Steve happy and if that means saying yes to, well, whatever, Tony is interested in doing that. Truth. That’s very much the truth.
“We can’t get that close to the black hole in time,” Steve finishes with a sigh and looks around the bridge.
Thoughts are rushing to slot in place, now that Steve’s fully awake. There is a virus sample to be retrieved from a Hydra base in the international waters somewhere east of Texas, SHIELD has known all along that Tony is Iron Man, well of course, and now…
Steve finishes his plate, and three more pieces of garlic bread, and is wondering if it would be rude to ask for more when Tony offers to get him more pasta. He doesn’t reach over to grab Steve’s plate though. He walks around, wraps his hands around Steve’s shoulders and kisses him until he can’t breathe anymore.
They stay like that, connected, until Steve’s breathing evens out and the warmth of Tony’s mouth around his cock is not burning anymore. Tony kisses Steve, all the way back to Steve’s lips and pets his hair, whispering praises in his ear that Steve can feel, but he can't quite understand. He helps Steve into the shower as if Steve’s a fragile first-timer, which he kinda is, and it is not until after Tony has finally left him alone to go sort out breakfast, that it hits Steve, finally. He has forgotten to even try
Because ‘it felt right’ can go fuck itself. Not everything that feels right turns out to be alright in the end. Steve is slipping. He is losing control. He is falling for-- he’s not gonna validate what he feels with words. Even in his own brain. No fucking chance.
Steve shifts forward and wraps his free arm around Tony’s shoulders. “Still,” he whispers into Tony’s hair, and kisses his temple, pulling him further in. “You taught me to dance. You offered to take me home and you showed me your deepest, most painful wound, but all I could think about was my own pain, and my own regrets and my own fucking nightmares.”
, Tony vows as he breathes Steve in. He will be there to fill the silence and melt the ice, to kiss Steve’s tears away, and hold him through the pain, every minute of every night.
It feels like a foreign language at first, as Tony has never had to deal with anything to do with microbiology, but the thrill of learning something new wins him over after the first few articles, and he loses track of time reading about virus strains, genomes and the million different methods of isolation and characterization, and the relationship between the original virus genetic and vaccine development. He writes some modeling codes and calls Bruce after JARVIS’s fifth failed attempt at rendering it, for an hour-long chat that leaves him with a fried brain leaking out of his ears. He has to read through a full course of vaccinology references tomorrow if he actually wants to make some sense of what Bruce is portraying as their only chance of developing a vaccine.
Steve is smart. He is quick and resourceful, and is apparently a phenomenal boss because more than twenty interns have applied to fill the two new intern roles on his team that Pepper had advertised internally yesterday afternoon. Steve’s team, that did not exist three days ago and doesn’t have a name, but has finalized 21 emergency help projects already worth around a billion dollars and he is just getting fucking started.
“Yeah,” Steve says, taking a step back, suddenly aware that he’s standing too close to Tony, “I guess I should’ve known.” The words twist in his brain and slip over his tongue. “Of course, you don’t count being groped like that a big deal.”
He doesn’t pass by Tony’s door on his way to the kitchen, around 27 times, as he does each day on average, and doesn’t go back with some sort of edible things on a plate. He doesn’t sit at the dining table with his sketchbook, and there is no listening to him humming absentmindedly as he runs the pencil against the paper. He doesn’t stretch in the living room, in the spot between the coffee table and TV, that Tony likes to think Steve usually uses because it’s in Tony’s direct line of sight. No push-ups, no chest presses, and no mouth-watering amazing pecs showing through sweaty t-shirts, regrettably.
Steve picks the stack of papers and leans his hip against his desk. Skimming through the perfect set of numbers and conclusions, he can’t help the vague swelling of pride in his heart and the urge to smile, to praise, to do
Steve’s heart drops at the hint. He looks down at his hands and stares at his half-eaten donut for a second, thrown off by the unexpected thrill that goes through his spine. It’s stinkily pleasant to even think of locking Tony up in the supplies closet because he can finally know that Tony’s his. That he will be there anytime for Steve to hold his hand and kiss his neck, unable to slip away as soon as he’s done with Steve, no way to dodge the questions Steve’s been throwing at him many times in the past, pretending he’s too busy, or not hearing properly.
This fic deals with emotional and physical abuse and systematic oppression of omegas. There is reference to abusive behavior and Tony is really hurt, physically at the beginning and emotionally during the rest. There is also reference to vomiting.
Tony ruffles Steve’s hair gently. “I think you have not read enough about Captain America then, son.” He kisses the back of Steve’s neck. “Did you know that he once jumped on a live grenade to save his team,
He thinks about the Christmas party last year, where he had restrained a horribly drunk department director who wouldn’t stop bothering a couple of omegas from IT, and the general staff meeting a couple of months ago that he had ended up in a shouting match with Colonel Philips in front of 90% of the employees when he had refused to listen to reason about field overtime payments.
Steve is Captain America and Captain America is Steve. No masks, no secrets, nothing to hide. It’s just pure electrifying, explosive pleasure with Iron Man’s grounding hold and Tony’s mesmerizing kiss, as they come, shaking and panting together. It’s surreal and completely out of this world, and yet it’s the realest Steve has felt in his century-long life.
Tony blinks and vague colors turn into Captain Rogers’s big blue eyes, filled with something that Tony can’t remember the name of. The lines of his face detangle and open up into a smile, and the scent of freshly baked bread fills Tony’s nose as the bed becomes solid under him and the world stops rocking back and forth.
Steve holds out a slice of pizza and, instead of taking the thing with his hand, Tony takes a bite. Steve’s mouth goes dry all of a sudden, and the wave of satisfaction that runs him over makes his head spin a little. Something peaceful takes the place of Steve’s day-long restlessness, bit by bit, and breathing gets easier slowly, as Tony eats the next two slices of pizza the same way, taking bites instead of taking them with his hand.
He will probably be gentle with Tony. He might even try to have a few words with Ty, seeing if he can forgive Tony or be easier on him. He will understand though. He has been there in that dining room with them when Tony has disrespected his alpha
Tony takes a look around as if everyone in the crowded diner is suddenly watching him. He tries to say something, to buy some time to get a hang of himself, to ask what Steve means by a ‘scene’ but he decides not to. He knows exactly what a scene is - far too well and way more than he prefers, and what’s making his heart speed up and rattle in his chest is not the thrill and anticipation of something new as much as he wants it to be.
It was just the two of them tangled to each other, in a mess of kisses, and touches, and tears, and for once Steve was exactly where he wanted to be - in Tony’s arms and maybe, just maybe, he would be able to stay here, forever.
It’s a U. It’s malformed and too long all the way around Tony’s cock and balls, but definitely a U and Tony can’t stop the out-of-no-where tears or he just does not want to.
Dr. Stark looks at Steve, finally, and there, his smile is even more beautiful than before. “Hey, sleeping beauty. How are we feeling?”
The thing is, though, that this situation is Steve’s worst nightmare. It’s a sea of concentrated humiliation that he’s been drowning in since this morning, when he managed to convince Sam to go to SHIELD’s BBQ without him and barely escaped Nat’s observant looks when he walked past her in the communal area, up until now that he's trying to find the words to explain what happened, the mental capacity to say them out loud and the strength to keep it together while saying the words so he doesn’t pass out or start crying in the process.
“Hate bullies,” Tony says as his finger slides over the line of Steve’s jaw and presses lightly on his lips. “I know. I love you.”
; the t-shirt obviously because it’s the first thing one removes when they undress, or at least that's what Tony thinks before Steve’s fingers trace the scars on his chest so gently and make Tony stop breathing altogether.
Captain Rogers runs a hand through his hair and ruffles it. “I figured if the rule was still in place,” he breathes out, “it might be my only chance to get you out of the government house.”
“You trust me?” Tony whispers softly, almost inaudible, and pulls back to look into Steve’s eyes. He holds his hand out slowly, and Steve can see the vein in Tony’s neck pulse, even with the little light in the dim room. Tony is actually wondering, Steve fathoms with disbelief, as if the answer is not completely clear.
He is tall and looks very young, even younger than Ty. He actually looks very much like Ty, with blue eyes and fair skin and even the very similar-looking black suit, which is nowhere near as expensive as Ty’s handmade William Fioravanti, but still tasteful and proper for the occasion. Dolce and Gabbana, Tony thinks; around $3000.
“It’s about surrendering at your own will. To give up the power and trust someone else; to leave it in their hands.” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand to hold it in his, and Steve brings his other hand forward to hold onto Tony’s. The air gets too thin for a moment, and Tony can’t quite tell, if it’s the idea of Steve's perfect ass on his lap, with Tony’s red hand marks all over, that has suddenly taken Tony’s breath away, or the way he is clutching to Tony’s hand right now as if Tony’s somehow the steadying polar of the entire universe.
He only needs a fraction of his concentration to keep on with the important bits really. The hardship Ty has gone through to buy Monet and the fact that he might use Captain Rogers’ art gallery, Marvelous something, for his future purchases, or Captain Rogers’ fascination with the fact that they own "14 Small Electric Chairs Reversal Series" because he has been under the impression that it is still owned by Bruno Bischofberger. Tony even makes a joke about how moving to a new house has created an opportunity for them to start collecting  because empty walls need multi-million-dollar art works, so he doesn’t come off as
Steve’s not better himself. Tony’s need is multiplying inside Steve, washing him over, drowning him. There is a howling beast inside his chest that acts on instinct, gathering Tony into his arms and laying him on the cushioned seats. It’s not Steve who decides to take off all Tony’s clothes and kiss every inch of his perfect, beautiful body, or to suck on his neck and bite his nipples until Tony’s marked and bruised all over. To kiss his lips, touch his hair, squeeze his hips with so much force, he had no idea he possessed before this.
Steve is not going to look at Dr. Stark, not right now at least, but he sure as hell can put his feet back up and try to hold still, even if Dr. Stark’s finger turns into a blade of fire in his ass.
Steve’s still asleep, soft and warm, slumped against Tony’s side, and he looks like a Golden Retriever puppy with the ray of sun shining on the fine blond hair all over his back.
want to get away. Never in his life had he felt like this, like being an omega was not a curse, not a sentence to a life of misery, like he had nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing mattered anymore. Nothing existed anymore.
There is probably no limit. Tony would have hit that limit by now, with the horrified looks of the complete strangers around him, as if this, Tony, is the worst thing they have seen in their lives. Like it’s a very uncommon thing to see an omega in that condition, half-dead, weak and…; well Tony won’t cry. He can’t begin to crumble now. It’s fine.
He needs to go back to the living room for at least half an hour before he can come back and get dinner going, but all he wants to do is take off the suit vest and tie and lie down. He feels dizzy and hungry but the idea of eating worsens the nausea  that crawls from his stomach up to his throat.
Tony rubs Steve’s back, as gently as he can with shaking hands. Steve can’t get drunk. He can’t even take painkillers, and he’s been in so much pain that he’s had to cling to a fantasy to be able to sleep for a few hours. He’s been alone, and lonely for fuck’s sake, in some shabby government-managed shithole that Tony can’t wait to find the authority in charge of.
Tony is on the phone on the other side of the room by the window, naked, and Steve lets out a breath he has been holding as he is not the only naked person in the room. He doesn’t get a chance to worry about anything else though; his phone starts ringing in the pocket of his jeans. And thank god, because Tony grabs them from the couch, walks over and drops them on Steve’s lap so he doesn’t have to do the naked walk of shame across the room. Tony smiles at Steve and bends down to leave a quick kiss on Steve’s hair absentmindedly before turning back to the window and butterflies flutter in Steve’s stomach again. He takes his phone out, which has now stopped ringing, and wonders what has gone wrong, because he has 22 missed calls, 14 messages, and five voice mails.
in public, even if the alley is empty and dark, and the images reel in Steve’s mind, and knock the breath out of his lungs. Iron Man pins Captain America to the ground, holding his wrists with one gauntlet, and Steve is trembling already as Iron Man asks if the Captain does not mind him removing the groin plate because
“Now one foot behind the other one, to the side, twist a little, and one foot in front, perfect. Now spin.” And the rosy world spins with a flick of Tony’s hand as he lets go of Steve’s back. Steve’s heart beats fast suddenly as Tony pushes him away, and it slows back down as Tony pulls him back in, so close that their bodies meet and he can kiss Steve’s nose before breaking away.
The room is calm and quiet. The sheets feel soft and Tony is not cold but he just can’t fall asleep. Part of him wants to blame the pain and over exhaustion for the restlessness. The other part though is terrified to realize that right at this moment, he just misses Ty.
“Here we go then,” Steve says and kisses Tony’s palm. He turns on the tattoo gun, running his fingers on the letters he’d just finished scripting on Tony's forearm, and reads out loud,
, but he can’t bring himself to say those words, and besides, he can’t really look at the stains on Dr. Stark's scrubs, right over his chest, which Steve can swear were not there when he first came into the room, so he just covers his face with both of his hands.
But any of that doesn’t change the fact that Tony has played nice with the jackass alpha to protect Steve. The thing omegas do, they keep their stupid alphas safe, the thing Steve should’ve done that night and yesterday in the field and still…
Steve takes a deep breath to calm himself but Tony's dizzying scent is all that he can smell. “I’ll do that,” he says, nodding quickly. “Thank you for the tour.” He walks a few steps backward. “I’ll medical bay. Go. I’ll now bay to medical. Now.”
“I’ve known you for 11 days exactly. It’s a small number if you count it like that.” Tony says softly.
Tony laughs, laugh lines deepening and all, and his touch on Steve’s cheek makes an unexpected wash of calm to run all over his skin.
As Steve brushed his lips over Tony’s neck, Tony tried to stop thinking about Bucky. He even managed, for a few minutes as Steve worked his way down his throat and over to the scars on his chest. It was after Steve had gripped his back and pulled him in, waves of pleasure slowing Tony’s mind and setting his body on fire, that flashing images of the fantasy came back.
He looks up, slowly, half hoping that it’s Tony, half hoping that it’s not. It is Tony Stark, though, in flesh, not the one from each and every one of Steve’s dreams, whenever he manages to go to sleep.
bumping into the guy’s sharp cheekbones. “First of all, you’re obviously not his alpha.” He points to Tony’s intact skin, showing through the wide neckline of his T-shirt. “And I wouldn’t give him a tattoo tonight, even if you’ve been bonded to him since 45 got elected to the office.”
The fact that he is a virgin, well not anymore technically, but still pretty much, and the fact that he has shared his first-ever with Tony, is quite magical. The intensity of how precious and how ecstatic it feels takes Tony by surprise, and, wow, makes him hard, full-on. His first instinct is to leave the list and walk into that shower to touch that wet, perfect body, but he’s not a horny pig, not a hundred percent anyway. Even if he doesn’t account for the self-isolation news or the sea of unknown and unforeseen things happening around them right now, it’s still highly inappropriate to walk in on a guy with a stiffy, just because he has given Tony the honor of touching him, God, as the first person, ever.
“Thank you,” Tony smiles against Steve’s lips, “for, you know, everything. Violence is not the answer and punching people in a Michelin Star restaurant is not a good idea, but fuck that. Just— thank you.”
He is sitting on the kitchen counter and Steve reasons with his heart to slow down, now that he can see Tony and he doesn't seem to be hurt. “It’s okay, and please don’t say that,” he says in the most comforting voice he can muster, with the way his heart is still shaking in his chest when he finally gets to Tony’s side.“It’s okay, it’s fine, we’ll fix this.”
As Tony’s brain starts to process and understand, he wonders why he’s not reaching for the door and running away. He should be screaming now, or crying in absolute frustration, so why, why, why all he can do is to drown in the heavy bergamot scent and sit still?
Tony turned back slowly, unsure how long Jarvis had been studying him. He sighed and took the teacup from the lined tray and smiled at Jarvis’s tireless efforts to maintain a certain level of luxury in Tony’s life in a three-room head residence on a military base during their extended stay. He took a biscuit from the neat stack and sighed again as Jarvis sat next to him on the edge of the deck.
Captain Rogers opens his mouth and closes it as the traffic clears up, like every single thing perfectly timed in Tony’s life has ever been. He shakes his head, and something shifts, so clearly that Tony feels like he can see it in the air, and it throws him, like he’s been punched in the gut again, but it doesn’t hurt, it’s thrilling even, the sharp pine scent that fills the car, that Tony can’t tell for the life of him what it means.
“No Steve, fuck no. Are you fucking kidding me?” Tony says, and he sighs with relief because Steve doesn’t look hurt anymore. “Of course, I want you to. I’m just-- you don’t have to. You don’t owe me anything.” Tony says with a smile, and he runs his other hand in Steve’s hair.
“That’s a cheap shot, Johnny, even for FOX News,” Tony smirks and shakes his head. “In the middle of a rapidly evolving global crisis that we had no idea existed 4 days ago, all you care about is if I’ve picked up someone from a bar or if I’m getting any as I’m staying here for two weeks.” Tony looks above the camera right to where Steve is standing and it might all be the games in Steve’s brain, but he smiles and nods to Steve, and the blood starts to flow up in Steve’s veins again.
Tony is still wide awake when Captain Rogers shows up at the door and knocks as if Tony gets a choice to let him in or not.
Tony’s had so many partners, he honestly can’t count. He is the celebrity banger as Steve just said, the playboy of the 90s, with so much evidence in print that there is no point to even try to delete the traces of it. He has slept with someone, who usually charges no less than a down payment for a Park Avenue apartment for the whole night, for free, thank you very much, and she was good, awesome maybe, but nothing, absolutely nothing compared to Tony’s best. And there is no rhyme or reason to it, Tony thinks, cause first-timers are supposed to be odd and clumsy, right? God, Tony does not even want to think about himself when he was a first-timer, just no, but this first-timer? It must be some sort of magic.
The pressure is sharp and feels like something's cutting into him. It’s hard and steady, and Steve breathes deep, as something gives and unclenches in his body, and lets Tony in.
“Breathe Steve,” Clint says, rubbing his back as they walks him to a chair and sit him down. “We don’t want you to bleed out on us,” Bruce says and sits next to him. “It will be okay, just breathe.”
Dr. Stark looks into Steve’s eyes. “Okay, that’s good, Steve. There is… something else that you need to tell me?”
Steve laughed against Tony’s neck and pulled away. “Buck, for the hundredth time, it’s called a text.” He shook his head, his lips curling into that sweet smile that had only started to appear since Bucky had come back.
“Feeling better?” Captain Rogers asks, and leans forward a little. “Do you need anything?” He’s clutching his knees and Tony watches as his knuckles go white, before tracing the trail of tiny red dots on the carpet and looking back at his own lap. Does it mean he’s feeling better if he can move his bare toes now? Or if he can finally move his fingers to trace the blue bandage? The ability to breathe even struggling with pain, while he’s supposed to be suffocating, or the fact that he still exists, despite all odds, that he’s still here, and miles away from Ty, does any of that count?
Steve closed his eyes and listened to the waves come to shore and go back toward the ocean. He was too damn tired.
“I do feel lucky,” he whispers, his voice suddenly hoarse, his skin burning all over, “can’t even begin to tell you how much.”
Ty is still in the shower so they will be late to welcome their guest and as much as it is supposed to be Tony’s problem, it really isn’t. It’s not like this person is here to see him or anything.
“Wow! You have one of those narrow townhouses? I’ve always wanted to actually see the inside of them.”
And it’s pure magic right now, how Steve’s body is opening up and letting Tony in, how every thrust brings the world down and builds it back up, how it’s unbearably too much and painstakingly not enough.
He will be here, Steve tells himself, his palm involuntarily pressing over his groin, because he said it loud and clear, ‘I have a date’, which has been their code since that unfortunate night Steve doesn’t even want to think about, two years ago.
, into the bed. He has been playing with Tony’s hair, kissing his neck, pressing Tony’s back to his chest and Tony has been fighting with himself for the past half an hour until he has finally given in, turned, and tried to touch Steve.
Tony kisses the tip of his nose and it’s endearing and hot as hell, and he pulls back a little. He grabs Steve’s hand with both of his, lifts his chin, and the way he looks at Steve, awed and soft and yet beaming desire, takes Steve’s breath away.
Captain Roger's face doesn't change when he holds Tony’s cold and sweaty fingers in his. His handshake is firm and steady, not the hesitant way alphas usually shake an omega’s hand, and for whatever stupid reason Tony can’t quite work out, warmth creeps from the tip of his fingers through his chest and all the way to the back of his neck and he does not feel like shivering anymore.
He is mortified. He is overwhelmed and a little confused and he has never felt as right as now, it’s almost crazy. The fact that Tony is half calm and helpful and half flustered and all over the place is heartwarmingly adorable and the way he explains roleplaying and asks if Steve’s okay with it a few too many times, makes Steve’s heart skip many beats, as usual.
“Sounds like Steve,” Barnes said, with a soft smile that made something sour churn in Tony's stomach.
Something feels funny in Tony’s chest. His heart is clenching, or breaking, and the urge to caress the golden hair away from Steve’s beautiful, now-wrinkled forehead is painful in his fingers. Running a hand on the back of Steve’s neck to calm him down had become so natural, it was almost a reflex until half an hour ago, and now closing the two-inch gap between Steve’s hands and his seems suddenly impossible.
Steve caresses the back of Tony’s hands and squeezes his fingers. “That’s not what I asked babe, a simple yes or no would do here. Are you interested in doing a scene with me?”
“I don’t have clearance to disclose my own identity, so for what they know you have no idea who I am,” he sighs too, and wonders how messy his own hair is, as he combs his fingers through them. “What if I haven’t told you already?”
that is happening and why on earth did it seem like a good idea to stay in Tony’s penthouse, or his arms or his life for that matter?
He stares at the mirror as the light comes on, but he can’t quite recognize the omega who’s looking back at him. No one’s eyes could possibly be that lifeless and God, that face cannot belong to him, no chance in hell, because Tony’s skin is never that pale, even when he
Steve follows the patch of light that’s extending into the hallway from an invisible source, every step heavier to take, every breath harder to let in, a pain to push out. He just keeps going, holding onto the wall with a parched mouth and spinning head and it’s the last bit of his strength—the last bit of his soul—that leads him finally to this room, that makes him take the half-open door as permission to slip inside.
Tony was once in love with this song. The idea of someone being in love with him, just the way he was, with all his curves and all his imperfections was once the most exhilarating concept in the world. The time when he still thought life could be easier and someone might actually like him for the dorky shit show he was. The days Ty would show up in Tony’s parents’ living room with a huge rose bouquet, and endless whispers praising  Tony’s face, his body and his mind. The days he believed in love, literally. The days the idea of being loved was not so fucking ridiculous.
It’s methodical and precise with a lot of nuance and understanding; resolute and yet compassionate, just like Steve himself.
Tony’s holding a phone, an old brick by Oscorp, with the dial pad button somewhere so obscure that takes him a few seconds to find, but it’s a phone, a damn real unlocked and connected phone, that he can use to call Rhodey after what feels like two whole lifetimes.
“You want me to go to Walmart?” Clint holds Nat’s fingers in his hands when he is talking to her. Tony looks at him and then back at her but he can’t see any signs or codes in the touch. Tony doesn’t buy it though; he is too tired to trust his own observation.
“Is there a chance you might be a little stressed? Your assignment came as a bit of a shock, with Captain Wilson getting assigned to diplomatic duty all of a sudden.” He smiles and pats Steve on the shoulder. “Just lie down for half an hour and I’ll be back to get your vitals again.”
It might be the tiny pill that Bruce had dropped off while Tony was in the shower upstairs, that’s made his brain a little fuzzy, or the fact that the pill had to be taken with food and the waves of nausea have not stopped after all that methodical effort to down crackers and stinky pieces of horrible hard cheese.
Steve had made a wish and had kissed Tony, and there was something in his eyes that was making Tony unsettled. There was something that Tony couldn’t quite place, that Steve was— the loud thump of the door startled him. He opened his eyes to the empty room and Steve was gone; for good.
No one should trust anything with Tony, as Pepper just stated on the phone, but for some reason absolutely beyond him, someone has decided to do exactly that, and there is no way in hell that Tony can betray Steve’s trust. Nope. None.
Steve finally says the words, and it’s like nothing he has ever experienced before. It's incredibly liberating to hear his controlled calm battle voice, asking, begging Iron Man to
It could be Bucky in Tony’s place who was being kissed, being touched, being taken away by the pleasure of Steve’s wonderful body and gentle love. All it would take was for Bucky to have been found a couple of years earlier maybe, just before Tony had dared to kiss Steve on that 4th of July afternoon on the rooftop of the tower. What if it was Bucky that day who had clutched Steve’s hand, kissing Steve just as Tony did, feverish and out of breath?
“A tour? No, Captain, I’m gonna come with you to operate the engine. The rescue shuttle is not designed for Warp engines and there is no way I’m gonna let you operate it without me.”
Steve nods, before fathoming Dr. Stark’s words fully, and it’s in the middle of his struggle to say actual words that the idea sinks in and the image crystalizes, that he has to
He lays his head back on the chair. The sun is rising slowly and the lights of the small apartments are getting less and less distinctive. Steve thinks about all things that he had let run out of his hands as he watches the city come to life. He thinks about not being able to hold on to Bucky’s hand on that snowy mountain and the dance date with Peggy on the Saturday that never came. He thinks about holding on to Tony’s hand and dancing with him to all the music in the world. To swing and sway until he is dizzy, to follow Tony's lead, to slow dance until he can’t move his feet anymore. He thinks about the feel of Tony's body against his, and sneaking kisses here and there, the smiles and soft whispers, and the spin and swirl that carry on lighting up Steve's insides. The impossibility of it all, the fact that Steve doesn't even know how to dance, all of it being a dream that has never been and will never be.
And Tony doesn’t care if the way he squeezes Steve until he starts making funny noises is too obvious anymore.
Steve’s hand freezes around the tattoo gun. “Is that a yes then?” he asks, struggling to keep his eyes firmly on his work. “To coming over to see them?”
He pressed his forearm over his eyes a little firmer as Steve sat on his bed, took off his shoes, and slipped under the covers. ‘Just talk to him’, Jarvis had said at dinner, for the hundredth time, and for a heartbeat, Tony contemplated the idea as he listened to the soft wheezing sound of Steve breathing. Tony was awake and so was Steve if his uneven, shaky breaths were anything to go by, and perhaps this was the moment when things would finally turn around for the better.
“I think we should get some sleep. You take the row of seats and I’ll crash on the pilot chair. It’s been a long day- well it’s definitely been more than an earth day since we last woke up. Provided you slept at all the night before, which statistically, is unlikely.”
Well, fuck, Tony thinks, as he wraps his arms around Steve and he holds on for a moment, for Steve’s shoulders to soften a little.
He puts both of his hands around Steve, slowly reaching back to clasp them together, and starts caressing Steve’s back in soothing circles. He whispers reassuring words into his ear and his own heart starts to slow down as Steve’s body warms up, until neither of them is shaking anymore.
Tony smiles with his whole face and his laugh lines melt Steve’s heart, like always. “Someone’s in a good mood today.”
Tony runs his palm up Steve’s chest, massaging the line between his pecs. “Oh yes you were,” he whispers, and watches Steve close his eyes, as Tony’s fingers caress their way up Steve’ neck and brush over his lips. “See. Just like now.” And he has to close his own eyes and take a deep breath too, with the way Steve’s blush darkens and spreads to his navel.
Steve’s lips twitch and his face twists, as if an old pain is stabbing at him. “There is no way that things would fit so perfectly for me, Tony. There is no way that I could have someone who can put me to sleep magically, and keep my nightmares away too. Someone who knows my song by heart, and talks about my stupid ass jumping on a grenade like it’s an extraordinary thing to want to save people? Who steals
“Clint’s scored a ‘date’ and is already halfway through town to get laid, and Tony is chit-chatting with that hot blond guy from Intelligence,” Nat yells back and points to somewhere behind Steve. She then continues to yell but Steve can’t hear her anymore. He turns over his shoulders to where Natasha had pointed, and it takes him a little bit to get used to the dark before he can find Tony
“Let go of him,” Steve says, and his voice sounds foreign to his own ears. “Can’t let you take him away like this.”
He looks at Tony, vaguely aware that his eyes are probably popping out of his head, looking absolutely hilarious. “I…” he tries, shocked that his brain can’t come back with anything, “he…” and he tilts his chin toward the alpha, but words are still stuck somewhere deep and don’t want to come out.
He sits on the bed, loosens his tie and tries not to think about Ty’s footsteps getting closer. He thinks about being such a screw up instead, how he has blown up six months of fragile peace and how he should have thought about this thing within him before putting on a show. Watching the knob turn and the door open, he wonders if he can wash and keep these sheets or he will need to throw them out tomorrow.
“I love you,” Steve says before he gets a chance to change his mind. The worst has passed, and they’re both alive, there is still time and even if Tony doesn’t love him back he will at least know the truth. “I love you so fucking much, I love your eyes, and your lips, and your stupid perfect hair that looks good all the time, even right now, or when I’ve just… you know…” and he gestures between them, overcome with something that’s probably shyness so unexpectedly.
“I love you,” Tony whispered against Steve’s lips, wishing he could keep his lips there forever. “Unlike you being around and driving me mad with mistreating your body and working too much, you leaving would be a burden I wouldn’t be able to carry.” He cradled the back of Steve’s head and brought their foreheads together. “You’d be taking my heart with you, bleeding all over your hands, and that was before I knew how it feels to kiss your perfect, smart mouth. I’d still let you go though, and die slowly with a hole where my heart once used to be if that was what you wanted.”
“What, you don’t appreciate the daily propaganda briefings?” Steve chuckles, and Tony can’t quite decide which one he loves more; the wit of what he says or the sweet ring of his tone as he says it.
‘Oh, please be around all the time’ is what Tony wants to say, but he decides against it at the last beat. “This is a four-bedroom penthouse Steve, there’s plenty of space. I’ll need to do a lot of work so I’ll be stuck at my soon-to-arrive StarkPad and sketches for long periods, but I’m a hoot to be around. Well mostly, and it depends on who you ask and at what time, but I stand by that statement.”
Steve’s eyes light up when he reads the items on the list and the crinkles on the corner of his eyes make Tony’s heart swoon happily. He presses a kiss on Tony’s forehead before disappearing, and Tony wonders how long it has taken him to open his eyes after he has squeezed them shut to revel in the sensation of Steve’s lips on his skin.
? Great job, Tony, we secured another deal with the Navy! How many did you push in the market, Ty? 60,000 ? The one thing ... the only thing … I optimised the bullet penetration for the … civilians? So the guns kill the kids better in mass shootings?!”
that about Tony. Among many other things, like his whole-faced smile and his scarred chest, his smart mouth and fantastic brain, his selflessness and the never-ending quest for growth even in the times of a pandemic and the way he doesn’t think twice before giving himself away if it helps someone else, piece by piece and bit by bit.
Tony asks Steve to stay the night, because he did such an amazing job with the dishes, and Steve bursts into laughter before accepting on one condition. The condition makes Tony laugh and blush which Steve has never seen before, and he makes a mental note: blushing is a perfect look on Tony.
“Sure,” Tony smiles, and something that Steve did not know existed breaks in his chest. “I’ll call you, alright?”
Tony drops his spoon in the soup, rather hastily, and his fingers wrap around Steve’s hand. It burns like actual fire, the mix of Tony’s soft touch, his wide, carefree grin, and his scent; sweet caramel and vanilla, finally with no hints of sour for the first time. Steve wants to kiss Tony’s fingers one by one, right this second, even if it ends with them ditching the rest of their already-paid-for meal to go to Steve’s place, which is strategically around the corner, to continue the kissing of places not appropriate to be kissed in public.
“Tony?” The alpha -Ty - squeezes the omega’s shoulder. “Come on, babe, gonna make some noise here, like the chatty little bitch that you are?”
“Oh come on, I know you won’t do that. I just wondered if something had gone wrong or something,” Tony says and he waves his hand in the air after he grabs the cup of coffee from Steve and puts it on the table, “I’m glad you were hungry though because to tell you the truth, I’m starving,” and he takes a bite from the blueberry bagel he picks from the pile.
He comes back to the atomic world in Steve’s arms, still sitting on the desk. He is warm and free and-- he stumbles on this one a bit. It might be the remainder of the orgasmic haze or the simple fact that he hasn’t felt perfectly safe like this for so long. Or ever.
“There was this practice in place, though.” He fiddles with the gear stick, and turns the volume down and up again. “The Hierarchy of Alphas Rule, to allow an alpha claim an omega based on the fact that a living present alpha takes precedence over one who’s been away for a long time. A rule from the 1860s, and yeah, maybe it was a political push to take these omegas off the government's hands but it became pretty common at the time. The only thing that the authorities would enforce was for the bond to be temporary, so they could hand the omega back in case their preceding mate showed up. You know, to prevent alphas from breaking each other's necks, not that it worked every time.”
Things that feel right might end up being alright after all, because Tony is as overdramatic as Steve, so why should he care about supersoldier serums and secret identities, about masks and shields? Tony wouldn’t care. He can’t care. If Steve just opens his mouth and tells him everything right in this second, Tony will not give the smallest fuck about any of that. Steve has to attack this one without a proper plan, apparently. He has to improvise.
The other meetings do not go as smoothly. Steve finds himself going over his speech all through the financial report presentation of ‘Doctors without Borders’ and stumbles on his words at least three times when explaining the details of SI’s ‘Prisons and Correction Centers’ Emergency Help’ plan to the director of BOP’s Health Services Division.
Steve takes off Tony’s pants and boxer briefs too, and takes a minute to watch him. He is thinking about the message, obviously, but his eyes are roaming from Tony’s face all the way down to his cock, and hopefully, it’s appropriate to be fully hard right now, so there is an odd chance of Steve checking him out, or so one might hope.
“Unfortunately,” he says slowly, “I can’t do this tattoo tonight. He’s not lucid enough to consent to a glass of water, let alone get something inked on his body that might make him wear turtlenecks for the rest of his life.”
This is not how he’d imagined the first time an omega staying at his place for breakfast would go, but he can’t lie to himself that after the initial panic of Tony waking up and some back-and-forth screaming, it feels kinda warm and fuzzy to watch Tony stop frowning as he swallows the first forkful of Steve’s signature blueberry pancakes, and the way his eyes go wide with the fork frozen in the air as he lets out a low moan of pleasure.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says as he leans forward to kiss Tony’s hair, “I’m sorry, for saying things I didn’t mean.” He kisses Tony’s forehead. “I’m sorry for not telling you before.” He kisses down the line of his nose. “I’m sorry so so much for being a giant knothead.”
He is hot. He is lightheaded. He is exhilarated. He is safe and he feels that he can let go. That he can finally let go.
“Why did you bring me here, though?” Tony asks as he finally starts to eat again. “You know, why didn’t you call the police for real?”
“This might be the weirdest thing you’ve ever said to me,” Tony whispers back among little kisses, “the sweetest too, alpha.”
A rich velvety warmth washed over Tony’s heart and a million butterflies fluttered in his chest. “Stay then. Stay with me. For real. Forever.”
Tony walks around as they watch the video of the first time Iron Man’s caught on camera, flying over Afghanistan. He paces the room during the Netflix documentary and he yells at the screen right after Steve, as soon as the narrator mixes up Mark VI and Mark VII. Tony explains the Mark VII firepower improvements with a mind-blowing amount of details and sketches the new thrusters at Steve’s request to the best of his knowledge. He smiles the whole time, watching on his feet, as Iron Man rescues the passengers of the Staten Island Ferry, and cheers and claps for the last few passengers, excited to see the ‘ending show’ from this particular angle.
He lets go of Tony’s hand reluctantly because unfortunately Tony needs both of his hands to open the bottle of wine, and takes a sip of his glass right after Tony pours the drink, which tastes more like a $200 bottle rather than a  $2 one.
Steve rests his chin on his hands to keep them busy. “I get it. And it’s not pathetic, it’s just an unfair advantage he’s exploiting to the fullest. I’m sorry.”
He reads every word and studies every picture front to back and back to front and it’s starting to get dark outside when he finally looks up, with a stiff neck from the many hours of looking down. Tony is yelling at someone on the phone, this time in disbelief that there seems to be a toilet paper shortage in every supermarket across the US, and he is eating something, as Steve can hear him chew and swallow between broken screams. Steve stares at Tony through the bedroom door, trying to process the concept of toilet paper shortages but all he can think about is the perfect combination of red and gold metal with a shining blue light. The fact that Tony is going to investigate the production lines that could be repurposed to help essential item shortages is not graspable right now. Or the way his own stomach is rumbling, as he has not eaten since lunch.
Tony then helps Steve up and into the bed. He has no intention of leaving, but the way Steve holds on to his hand after he lies down, and just does not let go, breaks Tony’s heart into a thousand butterflies.
The words spill out like the magnitude of water rushing through a broken dam. Tears he didn’t know he was holding back for years, well up and overflow.
I would love to know how you feel about the fic, and I truly appreciate each and every comment. Your nice words make my day and they are truly my fuel to go on writing this daily. I love you all and I hope everyone stays safe and happy during this hard time.
“But if this works, and it will, I have no doubt, then you’ll be free to work with that team of lawyers that I’ll hire to get you out for good. It’s all I’m trying to do, just give you a fighting chance.”
Tony talks about the battle he’s been fighting to convince his execs to take significant pay-cuts to hold back lay-offs as much as possible. He rants about the pandemic bringing out the worst of the American Nightmare to the surface; how public healthcare and social welfare are non-existent in this country, and charities cannot make up for an unjust, broken system. Steve eats the rest of the amazing oversized pizza as slowly as he possibly can, and nods from time to time, as he swallows his opinions on America’s social issues with cheese and bread. He can talk about public healthcare all day; he just doesn't know if he can stop talking before all that’s been building up inside him since last night starts to spill.
I hope you enjoyed this chapter, I will do my best to post the next chapter mid Jan ( and it's not because I am taking a break, because I will be writing a holiday fic based on the movie
From that first look, the first touch, the very first time Steve came apart under Tony’s hands, and along the way, how Steve has opened up to Tony, slowly but surely, how Tony has peeled the covers and taken off the mask, how he’s kept Steve’s nightmares away and soothed his pain, one kiss after the other.
only get to go if you have these redone and on my desk by the afternoon,” he says and throws the papers on top of the pile of scraps on Tony’s desk, “looks like you’ve gotten Dum-E to do these, after all.”
Fifty and Jeh, you guys rock! you held my hand through this all the way and I am really really grateful <3333
Steve smiles, in an effort to stop the tears welling up. “Okay. Not too extravagant, though. Say, fifty dollars tops?”
“Of course I am. Still. You’re kinda naked here, if you haven't noticed, and what we just did was crazy hot,” Steve whispers back, moving on to plant small kisses on Tony’s palm.
“But that’s not right.” Captain Rogers looks at Tony, finally, and narrows his eyes. “What should an omega in Tony’s situation do?”
Ty is not digging his nails into Tony’s suit anymore but his grip is too firm; even if it’s not showing from the easy way his hand is laying on Tony’s arm.
“I don’t think I can say no to that then.” Steve smiles and starts to rub Tony’s spine. “It’s kinda hot you know,” he says, and his hand comes up to rest on Tony’s nape, “to be able to wash your dishes.”
“It’s about being at someone else’s mercy fully, yet being sure that it will be okay. It’s learning the art of letting go and enjoying it too. Being weak but decidedly, not being in charge, not having to make decisions, just being there and taking it. It may not work for you but I kinda have a feeling that it might, so… just an idea.” And he shivers slightly, as Steve leans in to lay his head on Tony’s chest, again.
Would Steve finally lose his patience if Tony uses the cliche of ‘it’s complicated’? That’s the truth and supposedly the noble option but never the wise one, especially when it comes to talking about one’s feelings. “Whatever you want to do, you can give it a go. I’m game, sweetheart, I can do whatever you want me to.” There. Truth is overrated.
It’s a slice of heaven right there and then, even if Steve’s just fine, and his body doesn’t need any special treatment after ‘his first time’. He doesn’t mind being the breakable object for a second, treated like a ‘new bride’ after the first night, and allows his mind to cling to Tony’s promise of the ‘the actual deal’ as soon as they’re ‘home’, when the world is not crashing down anymore.
Everything moves into place after that. Tony can’t think about anything else, even when he tries to, and his brain is quiet, completely, for what might be the first time in forever. It’s all Steve and the way his body feels so close to Tony’s. The way his thighs envelop Tony’s cock as he slides back and forth between them, the way he moans and gasps for air as Tony’s hand picks up speed around his cock, how they are close, so close that it feels they are one. How it’s pleasure and nothing but pleasure, from the point where their bodies meet all the way through to eternity.
Please feel free to ask me any question if you need before reading and let me know if you feel it is not tagged properly.
since he has met him. The way he has treated Steve like he is a piece of fine glass art, with care and diligence. The way he has tried to shift things in his multi-billion dollar business, yelling and swearing, to do the right thing for his employees and the public as much as he can, never mentioning a thing about saving himself from any harm, financially or physically.
He then looks at Ty, and thank God, Ty smiles as he lifts Tony’s hand from his knee and places a kiss on the back of it.
Steve’s body is burning with desire as Tony cups the back of his head to pull him in, and he starts trembling as Tony wraps his other hand around his waist to keep him close. They kiss, lips, tongues, and teeth, and Steve knows that he is being horrible and clumsy, but Tony doesn’t seem to care at all. He tightens his hold on Steve’s nape as soon as he breaks away and pulls Steve back into another wet and sloppy yet more breathtakingly amazing kiss.
He couldn’t do any of that. Not tonight, and not ever, because Steve was about to leave to be with someone he actually wanted to be with. Someone who would get to touch Steve and love him and keep him safe, someone who was not Tony and was about to come and gather Tony’s omega in his arms and take him away for good.
“Here, I think you need to drink something sweet now. Doctor’s orders.” and for the first time since the minor incident in the damn living room back in Scarsdale, he smiles and it’s pathetic and stupid but apparently Tony’s heart is not too badly hurt for a flip flop.
“So now that we love each other,” Tony says nonchalantly, “I think I should ask you on a proper date.”
“Steve?” Dr. Stark looks up at him, with torturously soft eyes, and Steve takes a deep breath to get a hold of his nerves before he reaches down and lifts the hem of the gown past his thighs and balls until it slides off his stupid,
Ty squeezes his fingers again, only a touch harder this time, but it’s there and it’s enough for a line of ice to go from his fingers through his heart to his arm, where Ty’s other hand is. Tony stands up too quickly, and he feels almost weightless with no part of Ty’s body touching his.
They stay like that for a while, as Steve massages Tony’s scalp gently with his chin and wonders if he can just tell Tony everything, right at this moment, as Tony is running his fingers on Steve’s forearm. It feels like the perfect moment, as Tony is calm and full, he has not gone through any shouting matches yet and Steve has his arms around him, so he can’t punch Steve or walk away without a word. ‘Tony, I am Captain fucking America’ does not sound like a very good intro to the conversation though, so he moves on to the only other thing that comes to his mind instead.
Steve can’t be awake. This - all of this - has to be a long-winded exhausting dream since going down with Valkyrie in 1945. He must still be asleep somewhere unknown, deep in the Arctic, and waking up in the hospital, the lonely nights and pointless days, and the unbearable constant pain have to be the episodes of one endless nightmare. He can’t quite believe that deciding to walk into that bar and falling into Tony’s arms, the little heaven in the hell that’s been Steve’s life in the past 18 months, are not even real; that everything is part of the same nightmare, Steve can't imagine having to go back to.
Tony’s arm curls around Steve’s back and pulls him in a little. Steve’s lips finally meet Tony’s and they kiss, gentle and slow, and not only because it hurts. It’s just too powerful, like lightning striking out of the blue, like catching on fire from inside, like hiking up the steepest hill to get to the edge of a stunning lake, delighted to have finally arrived, thrilled to roll down the other side and see what’s lying ahead.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says from somewhere, and Steve has to sweep around the living room to find him. “The place is a mess, and I am the biggest mess in human history.”
“And, we’re officially stuck.” Tony taps on the keyboard, before shaking his head. “The shuttle did a fantastic job getting us here, but its structural integrity is compromised. Sadly, it’s not built for Warp engines, and now it needs some love in the Fleet Yards.”
Captain Rogers fidgets and rubs his temple a little, then sits back, crosses his legs and does nothing.
Steve grabs Tony’s wrist and brings it up to eye level. He kisses Tony’s fingers one by one, unhurriedly, as if that’s the most important thing to do right at that second.
The bar is filled with music and happy noises. Steve grabs a beer from the bar and ignores Fury’s questioning looks from across the bar and bumps into two dozen drunk colleagues before he finally finds Nat and Bruce giggling at a booth in the corner.
“I’m not here to argue my correct assessment, Captain Rogers. I wanted to offer to be released from duty and get off Avenger at the nearest space station. The engines are solid and working as expected so my engineers should be able to take over from now. Lieutenant Engineer Parker is more than capable.”
Steve looks up from his phone, eyes wide and interested. “Stark Industries? Do you work at Stark Industries? Wow, no wonder they can afford this--wait--
Steve walks around the desk and stands in front of Tony. “It wasn’t bad. And I’m not embarrassed. All I can think about, all the time, is how wonderful and amazing it was to share that with you. I just can’t stop thinking about it. I just didn't want to make
Steve is sleepy. Gloriously beaten up, rung and stretched in the best possible way and happy, giddy with the strange sensation that rolls through his body with every single move of his hips. It’s a presence, a shadow, a reminder of what has happened and it hurts in the most perfect way with every word, every smile, and every breath.
Tony is lying on his back, sending the last of the endless emails, trying to approve everything for the gathering of funds tomorrow. He has almost lost his voice, with surprise squeakings on the phone, one call after the other, after the other. It’s amazing that no one has a clue who convinced the president and funnily enough everyone thinks it’s one of Tony’s magic tricks that has finally worked out. Rhodey has a few people in mind but none of them could have possibly known about any of this, and Pepper has no idea but keeps screaming many nice things about their unidentified superhero.
“If you tell me where it hurts,” Tony says, low and breathy, and Steve turns to him, ignoring the stabbing pain in his back from being dragged on the floor by gigantic security people, “I might be able to kiss it better.”
He closes his eyes and clutches the gown in his hands as he tries to calm down, breathe in, or breathe out, apparently unable to perform the supposedly easy tasks, because there are gloved fingers on his cock, and warm breath flowing around it, a reminder of how close Dr. Stark actually is.
such a big bulky puppy, Tony thinks as he runs his fingers through Steve’s hair; he is genuine and raw and surprisingly strong inside and out but gets flustered in a heartbeat over working out the coffee machine and shows his blushing belly, in the most endearing way possible, as soon as Tony brushes his lips under his chin.
Steve flexes his fingers and shoves his hands in his pockets. “That's why I gave you my number and I’m glad that you called. I’ve been meaning to check on you, but I had no idea how to.”
“Yeah?” Steve brushes his lips over Tony’s neck and nibbles on his gland. “Let’s see who gives a fuck about what-” and he sucks hard, a little too hard maybe, but who cares, and Tony’s screech in what’s a perfect mix of agony and pleasure goes right to his cock “-any minute now.”
This was a bad idea, altogether, and Tony should’ve said no from the get-go, because what the fuck, what the actual fuck, was he thinking when he agreed to do this knowing that it will end up in total disaster.
‘Let you do the dishes’? Really? This must be the most stupid thing he has said asking someone out, (and he has said some very stupid things, which Rhodey is keeping a list of) and he is not even asking Steve out. It’s just a pasta that Tony is planning to make, from his mom’s special recipe he has only ever made for Pepper once on their first anniversary. It’s not a big deal, not at all, and why can’t he just say something else to gloss over the stupid dishes comment? Why, why, why is Steve taking so long to say something?
“What if he's thinking the same?” Jarvis said, as the lightning broke through the clouds and hit the sea. Tony’s heart started to beat fast with the thunder and something he did not know he still possessed, that felt achingly similar to hope, started to spill from his heart into his veins, warming up his freezing skin from within. “What if he wants to stay but doesn’t want to be
The songs are all suggested by you amazing people, thank you to QueenE for Lover, ironycap for Underwater, sugerspiceandallthingsnice for La Vie en Rose, Slytherclaw2002 for It's been a long long time and Jeh for The Way I am.
“No. It’s okay.” Steve practically slaps Tony’s hand away. He is not upset, Tony is sure, if the way he looks at Tony, all soft and awed as if Tony has moved some sort of mountain, is anything to go by. Or, how tight his hand is still wrapped around Tony’s waist, holding him close, and not letting go.
It’s just that it would never have occurred to six-months-ago Tony, that he would need to figure out his next move while surrounded by strangers, holding on to the waistband of pants that could fit three people his size comfortably, desperate for a shower, and in the state of New fucking York out of all places in the world.
“I checked for possible internal tears or bleeding before removing the speculum, and it’s all clear. I tried to clean you up a bit but you were asleep, and I didn't want to disturb you, so you’ll need to do a bit of cleaning up before getting dressed. Sorry about that.”
He has never lived in any city, but he’s always wanted to. Ty once promised they would live in a big city, at least temporarily, and in the painful haste of moving from Malibu, New York being the destination was the only relief for Tony. He is stupid though, obviously. New York is a fucking state. It has suburbs with five  people living in acres of land. Two people in ten  acres to be exact in his case, if he does not count the occasional help. He is a wishful moron and that is really nobody’s fault.
“This feels so amazing, Steve, you -- you feel so amazing,” Tony says, as he pushes just a tad more, and Steve’s brain comes to a halt, the way Tony’s finger is inside him, barely but still, and Steve wonders if he will pass out, if he will come apart in full and stop existing.
It could all be different, what Steve and Bucky would have if things had gone just slightly differently.
“Right,” Tony says, watching Steve with narrow eyes for a moment, before his body trembles in a mix of pain and laughter. “So excuse me for my inability to be more delicate with my words, Captain Rogers, but, do you have any leads on where we can find an alpha to knot me before I die from dehydration?”
Captain Rogers finally puts down the fork and there is not a single crumb left on his plate. He thanks Helen for the millionth time as she clears the table and something bubbles up in Tony's heart when Helen's face is the happiest he's ever seen.
“I have participated in combat training multiple times. I’ve got a field promotion just like you. That’s on top of my-” he fetches his PADD from under his arm and starts tapping at it “-Starfleet Academy command courses,
Steve’s head spins as Dr. Stark traces a line over each of Steve’s balls. This is not uncomfortable, not really, but Dr. Stark’s fingers cupping and rolling his balls is not helping the situation in his ass, and he can’t help but let out a muffled cry, as he tries to hold back the hot waves of extreme arousal and horrible embarrassment.
He moves his fingers in and out a few more times, as he watches Steve, waiting for his confirmation before he pulls them out quickly but gently. It’s just surreal that Steve misses his fingers almost instantly, as if they’re a part of Steve now, how he can
He doesn’t look like the people who usually come over to ask for donations. He also does not sound like them. There is something earnest about the way he talks about the veterans, and the sorrow in his eyes when he recalls the number of people they can’t accommodate every single night seems genuine. For a short second, Tony believes that this is not a show; That this rich alpha’s charity is not a tax-escape zone and he actually cares about the people he is here to get money for, but he knows better. Tony knows much better than that.
“He owns a house in the eastern suburbs. I’ll be Bucky’s burden for a while,” Steve said and his voice was too sad for Tony’s liking.
“Oh God,” someone says, alarmed and hoarse, and a solid strength that wraps around his body hurts but keeps him steady on his feet. “Breathe,” the voice commands and air flows into Tony’s lungs as he listens to a presence who inhales deep and exhales long and slow. “You’re okay,” comes a whisper, and the will to live creeps back under Tony’s skin. “It’ll be fine.” The faintest hope flickers in his chest, that the next moment might be better than the one before, the slightest bit, as cold drops of water bring him out of the deep end and ease him into awareness.
“I am not sure about the logistics of that, to be honest. I will do as they tell me, it should hopefully be okay,” Steve says, not sounding very hopeful about it.
As he draws sketches of ‘The Unknown Man behind the Iron Man’ one after the other, he ends up adding details to his usually vague features that he has never used before. The fluffy dark hair, for example, that just ends up on the paper on its own accord or the big eyes that seem very familiar but Steve can’t remember why. He even draws a red tie for one of the sketches, not certain where that one has come from, as no one stepping out of a suit of armor would be wearing a red tie.
“Oh sorry, am I distracting you? I should probably stop then, don’t want to keep you from it, really,” and he chuckles, as he gives Steve’s nipple a gentle pinch before letting go.
“I want you to have this one,” Steve says, his voice lower than he expected as he holds out the sketch to Tony. Tony smiles and holds out his hand which is a silent gesture for a perfect invite.
The hair on the back of Tony’s neck stands on end. What are they exactly? Quarantined fuckbuddies? Hopeless romantics? Some kind of lovers, when one is in love with the other’s alter ego and the other--
DID YOU FIND THE THING I MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING NOTES? I'll give you a hint, it's got to do with what Steve's wearing :)
Tony chuckles, as he rests his forehead on Steve’s. “Someone who knows about the deal, has the president indebted to this extent
Tony hates magic in general. Things science can’t explain, all the supernatural concepts that feed upon people’s fear of the unknown but what he has had with this blushing nervous beefcake these past few days has no scientific explanation as much as Tony has tried to come up with one, and he has to resort to magic here. Dark, black, Voldemort stuff though, because why on earth has it happened if it’s not going to be for real? Why would Tony be so fucking gone for Steve if Steve doesn’t feel the same? If this is all a magical Disney princess movie, they are supposed to fall for each other, right?
That’s all that matters, really, and who cares if Captain Rogers walks a couple of steps backwards, sits back on the edge of the bed and continues to watch Tony with that very same shiny smile.
The omega - Tony - doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t move his eyes, still glued to Steve for some reason, and he doesn’t even flinch at the harsh words that begin to make Steve’s blood simmer.
“Someone’s so fucking sorry today,” Steve sighs, his hand freezing in the air. “I’m just-” he shakes his head and takes another piece of the cake with his fork “-so sorry.”
Steve sighs at the sight of untouched sandwiches on the dining table, surprised that Tony could go without food for so many hours. He pours a cup of coffee, piles a plate with sandwiches, and it takes a lot of willpower not to kiss Tony’s hair when his eyes sparkle and his mouth moves in a silent ‘thank you’.
“Tony, honey, this is not the place. We will talk about this later, alright baby? I did what I had to do. You know that’s always for the best, sweetheart.”
Tony is now truly blushing. It's not that big a deal really, it's not like he has not been praised for what he does, or
Steve leans back against the door and his weight shuts the door with a click. Tony stretches out a shaky arm and nods. Steve staggers to Tony’s side and his fingers wrap around Tony’s.
He will have to deal with the guy in the shower though, to figure out what his plan might be. As far as Tony knows--he actually doesn't know anything, except for his name, and a few fun facts such as the way he blushes at almost everything and smells like the meadow in a summer afternoon. Oh and the fact that he is still naked, washing that gorgeous body right behind this wall.
“You know I love it when you beg, babe,” Ty spits and his words stab at a vague point in Steve’s throat. “Does he know what a little begging bitch you are? Do you beg him like you begged me when I—”
“I want to. I haven't done this before but-- I’ll be careful, I promise. I’ll do my best.” And for the love of God, he looks so sincere that it melts Tony’s heart like a roasted marshmallow.
The morning meeting with his SI team is almost a breeze. The fact that he has an actual Stark Industries team, ‘Pandemic Emergency Response’, or purr as Tony likes to call it, has not lost its novelty yet, and he’s still surprised from time to time at how competent his interns are, despite their unconventional hairstyles and semi-questionable fashion choices. The meeting with Nat and Clint is even more engaging, as they debrief Steve on their recent intelligence operation on potential sources of the original virus. Steve does his best not to be salty about being left out and reads through pages of Dr. Cho’s report on a research by a Dr. Banner, who seems to be getting somewhere with making a vaccine if they manage to find the original version of the virus.
“Spread wide,” Tony says from somewhere near the foot of the bed, and Steve’s legs part of their own violation as if connected to the command in Tony’s voice with an invisible cord, bypassing his brain.
“Didn’t matter what the video was. A high definition footage of the Mark XLV flying in Sokovia or the conspiracy theory on how the US government is behind the whole show and Iron Man is a puppet to clean up their messes. I would just watch him fly and the image would expand in my mind, taking over the whole space, and it’d be a couple of minutes before he was all I could think about. He made me warm, and kept me safe, and undid the knots in my chest one by one.
Steve walks in and the color spreads from his cheeks down to his neck. Tony watches his slow steps, part hesitant and part certain, and his heart speeds up steadily with each and every step. He takes a deep breath when Steve finally reaches him, after what seems like an eternity, which might be his last proper breath, at least for a while.
“Excellent work, Steve, thank you so much for holding still for me. Luckily, the plug is lying very low and has an accessible edge, so I should be able to remove it easily.”
once again, too deep that his usual ‘mental replay and remember function’ is not working either. He tries to guess what the question might have been, and watches Captain Rogers's back muscles flex through the ridiculously tight t-shirt - which means the alpha is a hundred sizes larger than him - as he turns to look over his shoulder. He doesn’t look angry, Tony thinks, his heart starting to race already, but he didn’t look angry last night when he shattered a tall glass with his bare hands either. It’s not like Tony has ever been a good judge when it comes to an alpha’s instant mood change, as much as he has tried over the years, and he can’t fool himself to think that the alphas are too concerned with his genuine answer to what seems to be a rhetorical question anyway.
The urge of being close, even closer than this, swirls in his body and sits low in his core, making his cock leak and jerk and suddenly all he wants to do in the world is to feel Steve around him. He leans forward a bit to press his lips to Steve’s ears and he hopes that Steve can hear and understand his breathless question. “May I?”
Part of Tony is mesmerized by the way they seem to fit together, like perfectly oiled parts of a hypothetical machine. The other part though is still shocked and shaken by the way Captain Rogers has crushed a glass in his bare hands and does not even need a fucking band-aid.
“First of all, if you don’t judge me for having a crush on Biff, I will judge you.” Steve says, as he curls his lips and narrows his eyes, “ and besides, WHY on earth would you think that?”
As a cold wet metallic object touches his rim and gets worked inside, Steve wonders if he wants this to be over soon. It’s torturous and overwhelming and past the most humiliated Steve had ever been half an hour ago, but it’s electricity at the same time and blinding pleasure. No one has to know what a little horny slut Steve is deep inside, that he is loving this, even though he is absolutely hating it. No one except Dr. Stark, which makes everything just that much better. He will be the only one to know that Steve moans as the blades of the instrument open him up, wide and deep, not even covering his mouth, that his cock jerks and spills because a handsome stranger is working on his ass, with focused eyes and professional diligence. It will be their dirty little secret, and even that feels amazing, sharing something with Dr. Stark, who happens to be kind and gentle and extremely, breathtakingly beautiful.
Tony licks at Steve’s hole and Steve presses his teeth together so as not to scream. He digs his fingers into the sheets, hoping he doesn’t rip thousands of dollars’ worth of bedding, and wonders if he can put a name on the feeling that’s washing over him right now. It’s burning and soothing, gentle and relentless all at the same time, as Tony’s tongue goes further in, so impossibly tender and maddeningly intimate, that tears start to well up in Steve’s eyes.
listening, I swear, and I’m kinda lost here, but I promise it doesn’t make a difference. You were in a plane crash, so what? I was tortured in a cave with my heart hooked to a car battery. And you have nightmares, big deal, so do I. Am I supposed to let you go for that? For anything?”
Tony stays awake, long after Steve’s breathing evens out, and he goes over the events of the night over and over again. Nothing had gone as planned - not that Tony had planned any of what happened after the second dance - and yet, he still has Steve in his arms, feeling his warmth, listening to his soft breaths. He’s beat, tired, and wrung out, but he’s finally through the mill, and against all odds, has come out of it in one piece.
Tony is on his phone on the other side of the room, leaning against the window and Steve takes a deep breath to calm his nerves as he vaguely takes in the perfect lines of Tony’s naked back.
The wind howls and the rain starts battering at the window like it’s a scene out of a horror movie. Or a nightmare, Tony thinks, as if the reality of what’s going on is not surreal enough.
“You’re too good to pass, baby,” he says, pausing to be able to form words, “just loose and warm and ready to be fucked, as soon as I look at you.”
Steve had gone through three beers, including the one from the handsy guy. He had ended up kicking the guy's ass but wastage is wastage and there is no need to throw away a good pint of beer.
