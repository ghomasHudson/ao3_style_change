“I wasn’t,” he says, bristling a little at Dean’s description. Not that he isn’t right about it—Castiel
“Walleye, I think,” Dean murmurs back. “Maybe Saugeye? It’s still a little dark to tell, but they’re pretty big.”
But now—the feeling draws out longer than usual, shifting to something closer to hunger, to desire, and Dean’s fingers flex a little in Castiel’s hand. When Castiel starts to pull away they turn to gently grip him back. And this…
“It could work,” Cas says, though there’s a hint of concern creasing his brow. “But what would we do with the crystal afterwards?”
“Shut up,” Sam says when he picks the phone back up. “We’ve known each other a while, it’s not like this is new. Well... the dating is new. But you know what I mean.”
see the way his soul is pulled in tight, like an animal trying to hide. It’s not wonder Castiel hasn’t felt him reaching out since that one brief instance earlier in the evening—Dean’s tamping down on feeling anything at all, deliberately repressing every emotion in what Castiel can only assume is an attempt to keep him from being hurt.
Finally, after everything, they’d ended up here, in an abandoned house on a dusty plot of land, tucked out of sight and mind on the outskirts of some unknown town, miles from any prying eyes. While John stood by and instructed him, Dean had installed a crude bridge in the house’s dated fuse box, and they’d shifted what few possessions they had into the basement. John carved symbols onto every surface to keep them safe.
It only takes a few minutes for them to emerge onto the main road, and when they do, when Dean sees the mess of empty cars with their engines still running, the delivery van with its hood buried in the side of the white house on the corner, the bicycle overturned on the gravel on the shoulder, the enormity of everything hits him anew.
He's not her father, and though he shares Jimmy's features, he is comprised of wholly different cells. But still... he suspects that it will still stir up some complications between himself and Claire. It's upsetting to consider, given how much they've both grown to enjoy one another's company--if mostly through text messages--since they reconnected. He feels as though he should try and make sure that they're on the best possible terms before he even begins to approach the topic.
The smoke is finally clearing up a bit, and Dean sees so many more guys attacking than defending. Sure enough, once the attackers can see better, the last few men of the Brotherhood start to fall.
There are two guys left when one of them runs over to Dean. The other one keeps the attackers busy while the one by Dean grabs his nape and forces him to his knees, pointing his handgun at the side of Dean’s head.
The rest of the drive to Phoenix was spent in tense, uncomfortable silence that seemed to grow the closer they got to their destination.
Dean hasn’t needed to be chained to the bedposts for a while now, but the Alpha does it anyway, securing him to the bed. Dean doesn’t bother asking what’s going on, and, honestly, he really just doesn’t care. He just wants to get it over with so the Alpha will leave and Dean can curl up on the floor again.
He threw his duffle on the grimy bathroom floor and started tearing his clothes off. Avoiding looking at himself in the mirror above the sink, he started the shower, turning the handle as hot as it would go.
When he wakes up again, the burning sensation is gone, but every single muscle aches. His ass is sore, and he’s covered in come, slick, and sweat. Distantly, he remembers being unchained and fucked, begging for it the entire time, but he doesn’t remember the exact details.
“No! No, you can’t do this! You can’t do this!” Dean flailed his arms as much as he could and tried to kick up at the man’s groin with what little leg movement he could muster. It made no difference.
The Alpha reaches into the box, but Dean doesn’t turn his head to see what it is, continuing to stare at the ceiling. He feels a prick on his upper arm that jolts him out of his stupor.
The elevator finally stops, the ride taking long enough that Dean has a feeling they’re on the top floor. The doors open with a soft ding, and then he’s being dragged across a glossy marble floor. They walk past rows of cubicles, most of which, from what Dean can see out of the corner of his eye, are empty. There are wide, floor to ceiling windows that take up two of the walls. It’s dark outside, but even Dean can appreciate the view. He must be in a large city because the lights go on as far as Dean can see.
“Figures,” he grumbled unintelligibly, “The name’s Benji Hood, wanted for manslaughter and extortion in North Carolina. It’s all right there in his file.”
“Get your hands off of him,” his father growled from behind him, grabbing onto Dean’s jacket and yanking him out of the other Alpha’s grip.
Dean almost slams into Alastair’s back because he wasn’t paying attention, but he catches himself just before, taking a leap back before Alastair notices. His master seems to be in another world because he doesn’t even turn around to verbally reprimand Dean.
And then there are hands lifting him up. They try to put him on his feet, but the pain in his leg makes him cry out.
Dean tensed, his honey and pine scent turning burnt, “I know how to take care of myself, and Dad isn’t what you’re making him out to be, okay.”
He carefully picks the very tiny baby up, sobs wracking his body. He’s careful not to let his tears spill onto the child, cradling them to his chest in the palm of a hand. They’re so very tiny, but unmistakably a child, with small arms and legs, and even individual fingers and toes.
He’s still not sure if they intentionally got him pregnant, or if it was an accident. He figures that if they’ve let him keep the baby this long, it was probably on purpose. Dean wonders if Alastair knows and what he thinks about the whole deal. Was it his idea? Dean doesn’t see how it could be, the guy’s barely around anymore, but he can’t be sure.
He’s pretty sure that he’s kept in the attic of the house. He wishes it was a nice change from the basement where he was before, but it’s about the same, if not worse. It’s still damp and kinda musty, but at least it was only Alastair fucking him in the basement. And there used to be more meals. Now, he’s lucky if he gets fed once every other day.
Dean guesses that it’s the fifth or sixth day since the mysterious meeting when he’s injected again. There’s not much he can do to prevent it, but he still weakly struggled against the hands holding him still. He’s conscious for a few excruciating hours, his body steadily heating up until it feels like his skin is on fire. It’s not long after that when he finally slips under.
Dean’s still in shock. He was on birth control for fuck’s sake, there’s no way that he got pregnant. No fucking way. It feels like it’s not really happening, like if he thinks hard enough, he can convince himself that he’s not pregnant, that his situation didn’t just get even more fucked up.
Sam pulled back, turning his puppy eyes on Dean, “I still don’t understand, I'm not that much younger than you, and I know how to defend myself.”
Dean finally relaxes, shutting his eyes and waiting for the inevitable bang before everything goes dark.
It was a fairly small town. The diner seemed to be on the edge of it, with bright lights down the road indicating a much busier destination than the empty diner suggested.
I'm so sorry to all my readers who read the first chapter before I erased the timestamp at the beginning. I realized that if I did that then the majority of the fic would take place in 1999 and 2000, and I really don't want that so...the year is now gone.
The man just smiled and held out a hand. One of the other men dropped something into it, but Dean couldn’t tell what it was in the dark lighting.
The real shitshow starts when Dean hears multiple people coming up the stairs to the attic. Even through the iron door, Dean can
“I think it is time we make our leave, Pakhan. You have made your point,” a new voice, presumably the Alpha, speaks up.
Dean was saved from his thoughts by the creaking of the motel room door opening, loud enough to be heard through the bathroom door. He stayed motionless, fighting the urge to run into the other room and help his dad with whatever was about to happen.
Not even two steps out the door and a heavy body rammed into Dean, sending them both crashing to the pavement. Dean’s head smacked against the concrete and his vision went dangerously black. On his back, he looked up to see the same pale white eyes from earlier. One of his attackers was definitely the Beta who bumped into him earlier.
Dean’s tried to escape three times now, each time ending in blinding pain and endless screaming. Each time the punishments got worse, going from a severe whipping to being burned all over his body by hot wax and then whipped. Alastair’s threatened to brand him if Dean tries to run off or fight back again. After his third escape attempt, he’d said, “You know, little birdy, if you keep trying to pull this shit over on me, I’ll just hold you down and sear my brand across your chest. ‘Property of AD,’ has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? Then you’d never forget who you belong to.” Alastair had sneered comically wide and brought the whip across Dean’s back again.
“Oh, uh, no, sir. I’m sorry, sir.” Dean tried to rack his brain for anything his dad had said on the case besides how “easy” it was going to be. He came up empty.
They advanced at the same time, spreading out a bit to cut off any of his chances to escape. Well, he should’ve known intimidation tactics wouldn’t have worked. Dean pulled out his knife, waving it in front of him in desperation. “I’d stay back there if I were you, I’m not afraid to let your guts spill on the concrete.”
Dean stood leaning against the doorframe to the kitchen in Bobby's living room, his arms crossed and shoulders tense, trying not to let his nervousness show in his scent. Bobby sat at his desk, the older Beta presumably reading some ancient document that Dean couldn't even begin to comprehend. The only sound in the house was John's heavy clomping upstairs and the creaking of steps. Only moments later did Sam shuffle into the room, eyes heavy from sleep and hair rumpled.
Dean’s finally found a comfortable enough position when the door leading into the basement bangs open loudly. The sound echoes in the silent room, amplifying the hurried steps of the group of people who are filing into the basement.
His master doesn't waste any time, thrusting into his throat just as Dean's lips close around the head. He sucks in air whenever Alastair briefly pulls out, and tries his best not to gag, knowing that all his master wants is a warm hole to fuck. It burns the back of his throat and leaves him gasping, spit drooling helplessly out of his mouth.
Dean slid out of bed, tossing the knife on top of his duffle before joining his dad at the creaky table. They both had their fill of greasy, cheap breakfast sandwiches, which Dean wasn’t quite sure what they consisted of. His reluctant eating of two sandwiches seemed to appease his father enough, and they were soon back on the road toward Phoenix.
It is his fault if he isn’t sucking Alastair off right, or if he’s too slow to present. He’s there to please Alastair and whatever Alphas he lets fuck Dean, and if he isn’t good enough, he’ll get punished to remember to be good next time.
“Of course, word will be spread throughout my men. Now, in return, I have to demand that you remove yourself from the Brotherhood’s activities. Your interference in our affairs has been unwelcome from the beginning, and it ends here.”
Alastair appraises Dean for a few seconds, his eyes dragging up and down Dean’s naked body. The sick fucker must like what he sees because he only hums and walks out of Dean’s line of sight. He hears him rummaging around in the cabinets, setting things out on the concrete countertop.
“I’ve told you multiple times now, Dean. Can’t you remember?” His father didn’t even spare him a glance.
He still gets shuffled between the basement and the attic, but the moves are less frequent than they used to be. He gets fed just enough to sustain his body, to keep him from passing out when Alpha’s fuck him. It still happens sometimes, and he gets beat twice as hard for it.
He closes his eyes as the pain gets worse, retreating into his mind. He thinks about a happy memory, one where John wasn’t an abusive drunk and his mom hadn’t died yet.
The explosion triggers absolute chaos. There are bullets flying everywhere. Someone must have detonated a smoke grenade because Dean can’t see shit, and neither can anyone else. He hears bodies fall to his left and right, and the sound of men dying is everywhere, but he can’t see which side is winning. He’s not even sure which side he’s rooting for.
He doesn’t latch onto a happy memory this time, instead drifting through a sea of thoughts and recollections, never able to latch onto one.
The only good thing about the drive was how warmer it got the further South they drove. They were able to shed their jackets, and Dean had to eventually roll his sleeves up because of how warm the inside of the Impala got.
The Alpha bends behind Dean to unlock the chains binding his wrists and ankles, “Up you go, Omega bitch, let’s go,” he pulls Dean over to the cot, surprisingly laying him down on his back instead of his stomach.
The gun is heavy and slippery in his weak hand, but he manages to lift it enough to point it at the side of his head again. He fingers the trigger, closing his eyes as a happy little sigh escapes him. Finally, finally he can end this fucking nightmare.
Graphic depictions of rape and torture, graphic depictions of a miscarriage, non consensual drug use
Dean takes the relatively steady time to study the man carrying him. He is most likely an Alpha, although Dean can’t smell anything from him. His stature and the fact that he’s obviously in charge gave him away. It’s mostly dark in the building except for the occasional flashlight held by someone else, but Dean can make out unruly black hair and what seems to be the hint of blue eyes. He has day-old stubble along his jaw, and the edge of tattoos peek out from the collar of his shirt.
Even through the thick door and the mostly soundproof walls, Dean can hear the gunfire as it gets closer. Whoever is attacking the Brotherhood is apparently making their way toward the basement. Dean sits numbly against the wall, praying that a bullet manages to kill him.
“Careful now, wouldn’t want to damage that pretty face of yours,” the man, a beta with a obnoxiously potent smell, grinned.
The two alphas laughed, and Dean almost gagged at how putrid their scents had become from arousal. “You’ll be singing a different tune once you’re hanging off our knots, you whiny bitch.”
Dean just figured that it’d never happen to him. He was rarely allowed to even go out by himself, let alone be gone for any significant period of time. And someone was almost always with him, whether it be his dad, or Bobby, or even another hunting buddy of his dad’s. Sure, he was generally looked down upon, even by his own father, but it was never so goddamn terrifying. What Dean wouldn’t give for Sammy to be either an Alpha or a Beta.
Sure, he also wants to visit him just for the hell of it. He’s big enough to admit that the guy interests him, that he’d like to get to know him more as a person and less as a name on a page, and if anyone asked, he wouldn’t deny that Castiel is easy on the eyes.
“I was awake the whole night, just… imagining it. What would happen if I got out of my bed. Got into yours. If I kissed you when you came out of the bathroom in the morning.”
If he tries, really tries, he can almost convince himself that the man he saw was Castiel’s grandson. But there’s not a trace of another ladder in the attic, and the mirror is back where he’d thought it was. Dean’s leg is still dripping wet from the vase that spilled all over it. A pale purple rose petal is clinging to the water on his boot. The chances of this being an elaborate set up diminish to almost nothing, but he’s got to rule it out completely before he really lets himself panic.
A dozen or so chairs are stacked along the walls, and the faint scent of instant coffee lingers in the air. Ahead, Dean maneuvers through a tight gap between tables toward a dark red door. When they make their way inside, it’s to find a cramped storeroom, where a thin bedroll and blanket has been set out for Dean on the floor alongside several unlabelled boxes and a shelf of cleaning supplies. His backpack sits at one end like a makeshift pillow.
The air feels charged when they step into the bedroom; like lightning preparing to strike. The moment Dean slips his arms around Castiel’s waist and presses his lips to the back of his neck, Castiel understands why. Dean’s touch is electric.
Dean’s in the bathroom, toothbrush hanging from his mouth as he digs through the medicine cabinet in search of a fresh bar of soap, when he hears his cellphone ding. It’s pretty late for most people he knows on a Monday, so with a frown he finishes up and makes his way out across the entryway into his bedroom.
Sam’s saying something, but his voice seems miles away, barely audible thanks to the ringing in Dean’s ears. He couldn’t pick out a single word if his life depended on it. It’s like his cell phone all over again. Buzzing. But then Sam’s hand grips his chin and forces him to meet his gaze.
, of course he is—but there’s an odd little falter to his smile, and despite all his better judgement Castiel feels his heart pound a little harder. He has to ignore it for his own sanity, and he’s about to make a snarky retort—something along the lines of
His vision starts going spotty before he realizes that he’s not breathing properly, and then there are hesitant hands on his face. Warm, dry palms.
“Want your mouth on my dick,” he says, and Castiel bends down to tongue over the tip, tasting the bitter salt of him. Dean cries out loud, his voice breaking with the force of it, bouncing off the walls, and it takes more effort than Castiel wants to admit to keep himself from caving in without any more discussion. But letting Dean off the hook now would mean missing out on hearing him say the rest. And Castiel finds he’s desperate to hear it.
“Are you alright?” Castiel asks before Dean can say anything, and though he steps a little closer he stops short of where he’d like to be. There’s space between them that he’s not certain he should cross until after they’ve spoken. Dean’s brows knit together.
“Don’t forget to tell them they should use the restroom if they need to,” Bill calls urgently after her, and Rowena wrinkles her nose as she glances back, but nods all the same.
“Good,” Sam says, and his voice has an airy quality that Dean remembers from when they were kids and Sam had spent the afternoon next door, jumping on Amy’s trampoline. “Really good.”
“Then why the fuck is this so goddamn hard? If we both— Cas, if we both—if we all want you to be here, why is it so hard?”
Dean stretches after he ends the call, tilting his head from side to side until his muscles loosen and his joints pop. He groans at the sensation.
“Chill, Cas,” Dean grins, bouncing on the balls of his feet and rubbing his hands together before he crosses his arms to trap the warmth against his sides. Shooting him a sidelong glance, Castiel narrows his eyes.
Dean sings along with the crackling radio as they drive, and Castiel makes a show of threatening to change the station whenever he gets too obnoxious about it. He feels carefree in a way that he hasn’t since they were just little kids, almost giddy with this simple weekend of freedom that’s stretching out before them.
He looks up when Dean walks in, and snatches his hand away from the desk as though he thinks Dean will tell him he shouldn’t be touching anything. His eyes are puffy. His cheeks are wet. The sight makes Dean’s chest ache, but he doesn’t let himself look away.
Castiel relishes it anyway. He might be an angel again, but he’s still human enough to be tainted by greed.
For the past fifteen minutes, Castiel has been wrestling with Dean’s laptop. Its fan whirs noisily on his legs as it tries in vain to keep itself from overheating as it fruitlessly searches for a stronger signal.
The impact knocks them off course, but they pull back quickly, and when Castiel asks if anyone is hurt he gets eight replies in the negative. The ninth never comes.
The B-17 above it is hit by shrapnel, and though the whole thing lurches with the impact, it keeps on keeping on.
Nodding, Jack makes his way over and takes the seat furthest from the door. Back to the wall. Dean’s usual seat.
“Yeah,” Dean nods, hating that he can feel himself blushing. “I mean, we kissed, and it seemed like he wanted to do it again, so... yeah. I think so.”
“Yeah,” Dean says, nodding as he shifts forward to slot one leg between Castiel’s, using it to pull him closer as he shows Castiel how to make it good. “Like this.”
, he thinks, but then Dean looks up at him and smiles as the sunrise breaks, edging him in gold, and Castiel knows that no matter how much it aches to want more than he can have, there’s nowhere else he’d rather be.
he thinks, and perhaps even says, but the dim light of the motel sign outside is catching on Dean’s hair, making his edges glow, and his hands are soft and far, far, too gentle, and Castiel’s entire being thrums with it. A bass note that runs through his bones to make him weak all over, so that if he were standing he’d end up on the floor.
Cas says, “I love you,”and Dean’s heart doesn’t flip. It doesn’t stutter or stumble or skip a beat. It doesn’t falter. Doesn’t seize.
Castiel points it out to Dean, who laughs, “There’s a different joke up there every time I come through,” before leading him into the squat brick building. Inside, he orders a burger so enormous that the fries come served on their own separate plate out of sheer necessity.
“I think there’s a shelter down on Oak street…” Charlie says as she types. “Maybe Pine? Sycamore? Willow? It’s definitely a tree name.”
“Just a couple of security guards. I thought they were gonna call the cops on me at first, but I noticed pretty quick that there was something wrong with them.”
“Do you really want to listen to me complain about Lucifer for the next hour and a half? I could do it, but I think you’re going to get bored.”
He has no idea where on Earth they’re supposed to go from here. If he should try to play off what he said as nothing. If he should deign to address it at all.
Between one second and the next, they’re both underwater, splashing and kicking their way back to the surface. Castiel can barely breathe he’s laughing so hard.
“That shit’s what killed my Grandpa,” Dean says, and looks back over his shoulder into the apartment. Downstairs, he can make out the sound of people talking--of Henry talking. He shakes his head. When he looks back around, Castiel is frowning.
“I can’t tell if you’re actually that smooth, or if it’s just a side effect of you having no filter.”
He’s inordinately proud of himself when he figures out what it was after only a few seconds, but he doesn’t draw any attention to his linguistic success. Instead, he just watches Dean slowly eat the decadent slice of cake, and thinks about how he might get the chance to witness Dean derive pleasure from any number of things now. The thought is thrilling to the point of distraction, and as Dean hums in enjoyment of another bite, Castiel has to bite down on his own cheek to keep from echoing the sound. If this is the level of satisfaction Dean gets from eating a dessert that isn’t even pie, Castiel finds he can’t wait to find out how he’ll react in moments of true sensual pleasure. Even considering such things in an abstract way is more than he’s allowed himself before, but now that he’s started, he finds he can’t stop. Doesn’t much want to stop.
Castiel sneaks a quick glance at him, wary of inviting another reminder to keep his focus forever trained on the road ahead. He finds Dean wide eyed and startled into silence.
But the street rushing by is flanked by an unfamiliar stretch of graffiti-covered factories. Crumbling brick warehouses. A laundromat. A block later, they pass a closed-down gas station—
The only signs that anybody ever lived here at all are the greasy spatter-stains above the rusted green stove, and a thin sliver of yellowed soap that has fused with the rim of the cracked ceramic tub in the bathroom. The fireplace in the living room is full of leaves and a dead gray bird; the single bedroom has a broken window with a patch of grass sprouting through the carpet underneath.
“Yeah, I bet you did,” Dean grins and wriggles his brow. “You tell Eileen I said thanks next time you see her.”
The photo is in near perfect condition, not a single crease in the paper, and from the surface Castiel Novak--dressed in the jacket that lays on the chair a few feet away--smiles out at them with his arm flung around a tall, fair-haired man in a matching jacket, both standing in front of the B-17. His hand is hanging down past the man’s shoulder, obscuring his name printed on the chest save for the first initial D. The lieutenant’s smile is radiant.
Dean’s mouth is bone dry, and his head pounds, and he itches all over. His hands are flaking, the skin of his scarred arms tight and sore. He spares a look at the sink in the corner. At the drain and the bucket he hasn’t had to use in days.
“Normal for a ninja,” Dean mutters, and turns to inspect the picture again. “Your sister’s got good taste in cars.”
Castiel supposes that he could have just asked Jack, but despite Sam’s unexpected return he’s been quiet all evening. Almost withdrawn. It makes sense, considering how Sam came to be here and who he’d been forced to bring with him, but it still makes Castiel uneasy. Even after all these years, after his slip-slide into feeling, the emotional discomfort is something he’s not quite accustomed to.
“I thought you went back,” Dean repeats, and he sounds angry. Hurt, as he pulls back to meet Castiel’s eyes, gripping his shoulders in both hands. “I thought I’d never see you again.”
“That’s a very good part,” he tells him, and glances downstairs to see Dean walking into the map room. He looks up at Castiel and Jack with a soft smile that has Castiel’s knees feeling a bit weak. So much for avoiding him. “I’ll let you get back to it.”
Dean’s been keeping track by scratching a mark for each day into the soft wood of the staircase railing so that he knows how quickly he’s going through his supplies. It’s harder when they stay in one place like this. With no receipts to scavenge, no billboards to read, no cars to count, he can’t keep track of time unless he makes note of the sunset.
“Are you coming?” he asks, and turns on his heel, rounding the corner before Dean can respond. He allows himself a smirk when he hears Dean scrambling to catch up, and bites down on his lips when he falls back into step beside him.
A couple of yards back from the water’s edge, there’s a fallen bur oak that’s perfect for sitting on. Castiel settles down on it to finish eating the orange he’s calling breakfast. As he does, he watches Dean tread lightly a few feet away from the lake, searching for movement and scouting out the best place to cast his line.
She closes her eyes, waiting, and Castiel reaches out. Inside, the djinn’s mind is a swirl of chaotic blue. He chases every strand, every word, every story, searching each truth for the hint of a lie. There is none.
He looks over at his coat, still folded neatly where he left it late last night, and knows he could leave right now. He could spare Dean the pain of asking him by doing it before he’s forced to.
He presses his foot down on the accelerator and speeds past the Gas-N-Sip. He doesn’t ease up after they pass.
“Well, I’m hardly an expert,” Castiel points out, sitting up properly and facing Dean. “I’ve kissed one guy. And it was only because I already knew he was interested in me.”
While he can’t help but be impressed by the ceaseless agricultural innovation of humankind, he’s quite simply not interested in hearing a five minute discussion about the merits of an internet application for optimizing the management of soybean fields.
If Dean were here, Cas decides, he’d claim that county fairs are a waste of time and money, but he’d be easy enough to convince to cross the street. Cas can smell the food stalls from here.
was in Purgatory. When you prayed to me, I prayed back. Of course I knew that you couldn’t hear me, but I recall hoping that you’d feel it somehow. That you’d sense that I was thinking of you.”
Sighing, Castiel twists to put the laptop in its bag on the back seat and eyes the books he put there before they left the bunker. He pulls one from the stack at random—an ancient black volume titled
One of the less flattering pictures of Dean has been edited into a newspaper cover page, with a headline that reads:
“He said he was leaving. That’s all. I’m not his keeper.” Dean lifts the book and wriggles it in the air. “You mind?”
,” he gasps out, pulling on Dean’s hair until he takes the hint, and even though he’s the one who pulled Dean off of him, his hips still rise to chase his mouth. The air of the motel room makes his spit-slick skin rapidly cool.
Not even trying to mask her irritation at being hurried, she shows Dean the list of items she’s still waiting on—a few uncommon herbs and crystals, and several magical items that he’d need an hour and a multi-language dictionary to understand the shape and purpose of—and makes the not-remotely-reassuring comment that even once she has everything on hand, there’s no guarantee that it’s actually going to work in time.
Sam telling Castiel to get out. Sam telling Dean he’s delusional, that Castiel isn’t even human, that what they’re doing is reckless and foolish and pointless. Sam telling them both that they’re making a mistake.
it gets—louder, deeper, more resonant—but with something unmistakably wrong underneath it. A bitterness sinks into his teeth and sets him on edge in a way that isn’t helped by the constant current of fear and anger and helplessness that presses in on him from all sides in this place.
“Sorry. Visiting hours are almost over — just giving y’all a ten minute warning,” he says with an apologetic smile, and disappears to complete his round.
His willingness to do as Castiel has asked without second guessing himself for wanting it is already almost overwhelming to behold.
Dean lets out a shuddering breath, squeezing his hand tight around Castiel’s, before he lets go and sits back up, swinging his legs off the side of the bed. His bare shoulders are hunched forward, his freckled skin almost glowing in the filtered fluorescent light of the vacancy sign that seeps through the thin curtains.
Garth had been okay, mostly, and had told the whole story to anyone who’d listen as many times as he could get away with, but in the two days that it took for him to get medical treatment, the broken bones in his ankle had started to stitch back together wrong. The doctors had needed to re-break it and set it, and Garth had ended up with an uneven gait anyway.
There are six files in the folder that Sam sent. He skips the book for now, and looks at the pictures first. One is a pair of newspaper articles from the Normal Inquirer, dated about a week apart and scanned side by side. The earliest announces WAR HERO MISSING in heavy print, and includes a grainy photograph of Novak in a white collared shirt, arms crossed over his chest as he frowns at the camera. He’s got dark, unkempt hair, and the set of his jaw puts Dean in mind of a young Marlon Brando. Basically, he’s gorgeous, and Dean can’t help but feel a little cheated by the universe at the knowledge that he’s sixty years too late to check him out in person.
do, given the proper motivation,” she says, then falters, mouth tense as she glances back past the barrier to where the ghosts are amassing like a vast, spectral army. “That said, patching up a hole in Hell isn’t the kind of thing I’ll be able to just throw together.”
“Well, also. Maybe I’m kinda… I dunno,” Dean chews at his lip. Drums his thumb against Castiel’s collarbone. “Kinda frustrated that I didn’t get to see you get off again.”
Castiel squints at the phone, then up at Dean, who is looking at him with the kind of fond expression that always makes Castiel suspect that he must have inadvertently said something strange.
“Kominek,” Charlie says after a long time. “Bartłomiej and Agata Kominek. They’re both… I’m sorry, Castiel. It’s been a long time since they died. But Hannah is still alive. She’s 76 years old, living in Sycamore, just outside Chicago. She moved there with her husband in 1968.”
“Backup from the home office,” Dean tells her before they have to come up with anything else, and the Deputy’s face falls in what he assumes is disappointment that the crisis isn’t getting sorted out any time soon.
He only wishes that he could show them all what he sees. They’d understand, he’s certain of it, if only they could see how endlessly fascinating the human soul can be.
“You should hold down the fort,” Dean says the moment Sam ends his call, and keeps right on talking when his brother looks as though he’s going to argue. “Don’t think I haven’t seen you wincing every time you’ve moved that shoulder wrong.”
Dean knows more about John’s demons now than he did back when this started. He knows how the acrid filth of them mingles with condensation and cloud, thunder drowning out the sound of them shifting under human skin, lightning making everything buzz with the same energy that they carry, letting them hide in plain sight. He knows how their faces shift beyond the skin of the people they possess. How their black eyes watch every movement. How their rotting flesh hangs, out of sight beyond a veil that only John can perceive the presence of.
“You look different,” he says, and his frown deepens until he places the change. “You have a beard.”
“So… human means, then,” Dean says, and when Castiel nods, he laughs with bemused resignation. “I guess we’re going to the zoo.”
“So wait,” Dean says as they head down the stairs toward the exit, following a middle aged couple who both seem to have loved the movie as much as Dean did. “Was that Loomis screaming at the end? D’you think Michael actually killed him, or just—”
It took Claire nearly ten minutes to write her reply. He watched as the series of dots repeatedly appeared and disappeared along the bottom of the screen. Cas was expecting a long message. What he received was two words long.
“I’ve wondered about it,” Castiel tells him, ignoring his comment. “Whether it would be as enjoyable to give as to receive. If you’d be amenable to try it sometime, I’d—”
“Thinkin’ about sunflowers again?” Dean asks quietly, covering his cellphone as he speaks. Castiel laughs and lifts one shoulder.
is that day in tenth grade, when he’d looked up from the tape playing in his scratched up Walkman, and saw Cas walking toward him across the cafeteria, and realized with a heavy, helpless thud of his heart that he was completely in love with the best friend he’s ever had.
It’s a lie. It must be. Castiel knows Dean, and he knows that no matter what, no matter how important their friendship, he’d ask about Sam first. Since the day Sam was born, Dean had taken to the role of big brother like it was his life’s calling. Still, he doesn’t see why Henriksen would make something like this up.
At level four, the elevator doors slide open to reveal Bobby and Ellen, waiting to descend. Ellen’s hand rests on Bobby’s shoulder, and Bobby’s fingers are wrapped tight around it. They both look wrung dry. Castiel doesn’t know whether it’s because Dean’s state is worse than they expected, or if they’re both just as overwhelmed by his return as Castiel is. He hopes, desperately, for the latter.
When Castiel hears him approaching, he turns, and his melancholy expression quickly fades beneath an impassive mask that Dean knows is only there as an act of self defense. It occurs to Dean that he’d probably been thinking of Jack as he watched the kids and their parents. It sets off an ache somewhere deep in Dean. He hadn’t realized he still had space for anything else to hurt, but… well. So it goes.
“Do you think you could do me a favor?” Dean asks, drawing his attention back. Castiel leans his chin on his free hand as he gives a small nod.
Dean is inside. Dean is in reach. Castiel should be with him, offering comfort in whatever way he’s able—not out here, having a goddamn panic attack.
It was less than that, Castiel knows. He did the precise calculation himself, not long after he’d arrived in Boulder. The bar where he worked downtown was three hundred and seventy nine miles from the bunker, but the room he’d rented for the first few months was two miles closer still.
Castiel knows that Dean wants to be chased. He keeps leaving clues behind. Little messages that mean nothing to anyone else, but everything to Castiel. Like he’s trying to make sure that no matter what, no matter how far he’s strayed from who he once was, that Castiel hasn’t lost faith in him. He knows that Dean wants Castiel to catch him, at least for long enough to get a few barbs in. He’s seen it in the way Dean grins whenever they’ve found themselves in the same place. Whenever they’ve spoken. He comes to life when Castiel confronts him; something in him lights up and flashes like fireworks under all that smoke.
The Alphas just laughed some more and before he knew it, the taller one lunged and disarmed him of the knife, leaving him defenseless against them. Goddamn it, where in the bloody hell was his dad?
Dean doesn’t bother to answer, fixing Alastair with a glare and refusing to drop his eyes. He knows it’s not a good idea to provoke him, but Dean can’t seem to stop ignoring the little voice inside him that’s demanding his submission. Like hell he’s just gonna lay there and take it.
“Yeah, I know," Sam gave a long sigh, admitting defeat, "I’ll see you in a few days.” Sam pulled him into another hug. "Jerk."
That goddamn injection did this shit to him. Probably meant to make his body go into a pseudo heat. His eyes burn, watering up enough that Dean’s vision goes blurry.
Dean took his time sliding out of the booth, taking one last drink from his coke before following his father to the diner’s exit.
Bobby narrowed his eyes as Dean turned to walk back to the Impala, “I’ve seen the bruises, Dean, and I know you aren’t that clumsy.”
Alastair unlocks his cell door, stepping inside and bending down to unchain Dean from the wall. He doesn’t give Dean any time to stand and orient himself, instead he yanks on the length of chain while Dean is still kneeling, causing Dean to fall forward and be dragged by his arms out of the cell. Alastair drags Dean closer to the lone light bulb in the room, forcing him to stand. The chains around his ankles get secured to a loop in the floor while his arms are raised above his head, the length of chain connecting his wrists secured to a hook hanging from the ceiling.
“You haven’t seen shit.” Dean opened the Impala’s passenger door and climbed in, muscling his scent under control so his dad wouldn’t comment on it.
It does kinda seem like something Alastair would do. Forcing Dean through the pregnancy only to take his child the moment they aren’t inside Dean anymore seems just his style. So would forcing Dean to watch as Alastair raises the child into a fucktoy like himself or a knotheaded Alpha that fucks everything in sight. He’s had a lot of time to go through worst case scenarios. However it turns out, he doesn’t see this ending well for himself or his child.
“Alright ya Idjits, break it up, he’s only leaving for a few days, there’s no need to get all sentimental.” Bobby’s fond scent betrayed his tone, and Dean rolled his eyes at the old grump as Sam made his way into the kitchen, grabbing a box of cereal from the cupboard.
Oh, God, how he misses Sammy. He hopes the little twerp is still safe with Bobby, and that Bobby stays out of this mess with the Aryan’s. He knows the chances of the latter are slim, Bobby never could leave well enough alone.
He had just shoved himself into Dean, setting a brutal pace right away, when his phone, which was always on him, had gone off.
He had tried to ask what the problem was multiple times, but each attempt only awarded him with a rumbling growl or a tense “quiet,” that sounded more like a threat than anything else.
“That’s how it’s going to be then? Straight to business? Fine, have it your way," his master sighs quite dramatically and leans back in his chair, the leather squeaking loudly in the quiet room. “If you insist on skipping the pleasantries, you might as well have a seat.”
“What did you say to me, bitch? Did you fucking tell me no? I thought you already learned this lesson. You
It takes him a second to realize that he’s started slicking, which hasn’t happened outside of his heats since he
Dean still shivered thinking about the encounter with the strange alpha, but he didn’t understand what had his dad so spooked, and no way in hell was he going to bring it up. He was in enough shit already, no need to add to the mess so much that his father took his anger and frustrations out on him. Yeah, no thanks, Dean was content to focus on staying in his seat while his father took a corner a tad too sharply.
“And I would suggest that you start to address me properly. I’d hate for this meeting to end in spilt blood,” Castiel sounded like that’s exactly what he wished to happen, his already gravelly voice dropping an octave lower.
He gets hosed off about once a week. Someone comes in his room, ties a bag over his head, and then shoves him down a flight of stairs. He’s practically dragged outside onto the lawn, and then hosed off with freezing water until he’s clean of shit, piss, cum, and general filth. They drag him back upstairs and leave him in the attic to shiver until he’s dry. He savors the feeling of being clean though because it never lasts for very long.
Tebe ne nuzhno bylo etogo delat', Pakhan. Vy dolzhny byli pozvolit' nashim lyudyam spravit'sya s etim - You didn't have to do that, Pakhan. You should have let our people handle this
It was only a minute before he watched two guys climb out of a dark SUV, presumably Alphas from their build, and start making their way toward Dean. His hand slowly made its way toward the inside of his jacket, where his tactical pocket knife was kept. As they got closer, Dean could pick up on their scents, confirming his suspicion that they were Alphas. He kept his scent calm and carefree, taking deep breaths to steady his racing heart, but when his nose was only filled with the absolutely revolting scent of the two alphas, he instead focused on maintaining his awareness of the surroundings, hoping to God that John would be back any second now.
“Get in.” He was deposited at the passenger door of the Impala while his father went around to the driver’s side.
“I saw a little diner down the road, let’s get something to eat and then we can go over the case.” It might have been framed like some sort of suggestion, but Dean knew that it was practically an order.
Sam threw Dean his classic bitch face but came over to him anyway. "Like I would let you leave while I was sulking upstairs. Besides Dad's making a ruckus up there."
There’s a barely there gasp from across the desk as Dean settles on his knees, presumably from either this Castiel or the Alpha. It doesn’t matter much though because Alastair starts speaking before anyone else gets the chance.
He’s come to terms with his life now. There’s no way out for him, no one to save him. He’d given up on that hope a long time ago. He feels like he kind of deserves it in a way. He was never good enough for his father, and he sure as hell failed Sam. So what’s the point in trying to fight it? He let his inner Omega take over a while ago, giving into the little voice in his head that said that presenting and submitting like a good bitch would please the Alpha the best.
His father suddenly stopped pacing, eyes unfocused, but seemingly having a realization all the same. “Son of a bitch.”
As soon as the water was barely lukewarm, Dean climbed into the tiny shower, immediately beginning to scrub himself clean of Alpha musk and his own fear scent. He spent nearly half an hour rubbing his skin a raw pink before he turned the water off and sank to the floor in shower stall, bringing his knees up to his chest and wrapping his arms around his legs.
But the Alphas who fuck won’t let him forget it, growling obscenities about “breeding” him and “fucking him full of pups.” It makes Dean want to puke every time someone brings it up.
John doesn’t dignify that with a response, sliding into the front seat and turning the ignition key in the Impala. Dean made to get in, but was stopped once again, this time by the front door slamming closed and Bobby’s gruff, “Dean, wait a minute would ya.”
So? What'd you think? This is hopefully (probably) the darkest chapter of the fic, and I hope I made up for it with Cas!
The door opens a few seconds later, not even the jangling of keys giving away that the lock’s being opened.
Alastair had only briefly shown him a phone, and that was only to show him the uselessness of trying to escape again.
“Stop,” he says again, “or I’ll shoot the little bitch,” shoving Dean’s head to the side with the barrel of the gun just for emphasis.
He keeps circling back to thoughts about his parents. How they were both ripped away from him by Alastair. Oh, yes, he was all too happy to inform Dean that he was the one to kill his father. Dean never saw his body, too intent on escaping to focus on the ruined state of the motel room, but he has no reason to doubt Alastair, and the gunshots he heard are proof enough.
Dean’s ribs are starting to show, his bones becoming more profound and easily broken. His wrist still throbs from when Alastair broke it a month or so ago. He’s surprised that he’s still getting fed twice a day, and while they aren’t substantial meals, just a colorless porridge basically, they’re at least something.
The door suddenly swung inward, startling Dean enough to draw the knife under his pillow before he could see who was at the door.
He shook himself of his thoughts, his ass going numb on the shower tile, and finally got out of the shower, quickly grabbing a towel to cover himself up. He dried himself efficiently, threw the damp towel on the rank next to the sink, and dug clean clothes out of his duffle. His dirty clothes were shoved in a pile in the corner by the sink.
Dean sits up, eyeing the group of Alpha’s in the basement with him. They’re all holding guns, ranging from smaller pistols to what looks like an AR-15. They don’t look dressed for battle though; most of them are in suits although one or two of them have on protective vests.
Dean sighs, curling into a ball on the floor and willing sleep to take him. The chains scrape against his raw wrists and ankles, making small drops of blood fall to the floor. It’s times like these that he’s come to despise the most. When everything hurts and he has nothing to do but constantly think. His head throbs, and every little movement worsens his nausea, likely side effects from the drug.
“He’s what you came for, right? I shoot him and-” the echo of a gun going off cuts him off, a loud grunt confirming that he was hit.
His father growled again and shoved Dean through the doorway, keeping a tight grip on his jacket and practically dragging Dean away from the man who had put his hands up in a placating gesture.
Mama’s making pancakes this morning, the delicious smell of the batter and syrup floating throughout the house. He’s sitting on the carpet in the living room, stacking his blocks as tall as they can go before knocking them down and laughing hysterically. Daddy’s sitting at the kitchen counter, reading the newspaper after putting Sammy down for a nap. It’s still early and Dean doesn’t understand why Sammy needs to nap, they just woke up!
Dean’s startled back to the present when he realizes that the pain has stopped. The general agony throughout his body is still there, it always is, but there isn’t anything adding to the pain right now.
Dean supposes that this session was relatively mild compared to what usually happens. There’s usually a lot more pain for a much longer time. Especially with how much stress whatever is going on has caused his master, it’s a fucking miracle he’s not bleeding all over the place. The hardwood floor looks expensive though, so Alastair probably doesn’t want to dirty them.
They didn’t stay much longer after that. His father quickly finished his own meal, giving no indication that it was just as awful as Dean’s, and then moved to the register to pay.
Instantly, the shorter Alpha was spun around and John’s fist connected with his nose, a sickening crunch indicating that it was definitely broken. The Alpha stumbled, clutching his bleeding nose and trying to quickly back away from John and Dean.
“I will, Bobby. I doubt I’m going to be helping much anyways, but I’ll make sure nothing follows us home.”
Only a second later is there pressure being put on his wounds. The two men use gauze, wrapping his shoulder in a bandage, and layering the gauze over the gunshot in his thigh before wrapping that as well. They are speaking, but it sounds far away, and Dean can’t make out the words.
Dean followed his father out the door after liberally applying the scent blockers. With his smell neutralized, his broad stature allowed him to easily come across as a beta.
Dean sits up, scooting closer to the wall until he can semi comfortably lean his back against it. He hears the heavy footsteps of an Alpha stomping their way up the stairs. Sounds really tend to echo in this house, letting Dean know when he’s about to be bombarded with a knothead Alpha. Dean swears that he’s not met a single Alpha whose scent doesn’t put him on edge, even before this whole shitshow.
The choice is thankfully taken from him when his master painfully grips his nape, pressing against the tender flesh around his collar, and shoves his face toward the man’s tented slacks. "God, do I have to do fucking everything?"
Dean parked the Impala toward the back of the lot, shutting the engine off and depositing the keys in John’s hand. John got out and unlocked the trunk before heading into the motel’s office to book a room for the night. They were still a good 10 hour drive from Phoenix, and Dean was surprised that John even let them stop somewhere instead of driving through the night. Dean sighed, getting out of the Impala slowly and making his way to the trunk. He collected their bags, setting them on the ground and closing the trunk before leaning against the Impala’s side, waiting for John to return with their room number.
Without the distraction of a menu, Dean was left to fiddle with the hem of his shirt or stare out the window at the dark parking lot. While the inside of the diner was bright, only a few stray street lights illuminated the parking lot, casting long shadows over the cars.
John threw his duffle bag into the trunk, slamming it closed and making his way to the driver’s side door. Dean opened the passenger door and made to get in, but was stopped by John’s words. “I figured that I’d drive ‘til afternoon and then catch some sleep while you drive for a bit.”
“Oh? I would choose your next words carefully, Castiel. It’d do you good to remember that you’re severely outnumbered within this building,” Alastair’s hand comes to rest on the back of Dean’s head, forcing him down the last inch until his cock rests in Dean’s throat.
Dean doesn’t really know how far along he is, but he guesses about 13 ish weeks. The only way he can rationalize his pregnancy is if he conceived the night they injected him with that heat-inducing drug. He only half payed attention in his sex ed class, but from what little he knows, the timeline makes sense.
The steps are the worst, each little movement sends a spark of pain down his leg and through his shoulder. Once they reach the main floor, the pain lessens some, but is still a constant throb.
Chaos ensued. Multiple gunshots rang out, deafening in the small bathroom. Dean could make out his father cursing loudly, and his terror grew. What if his father lost and whoever he was fighting got past the flimsy bathroom door? Oh God, oh God, oh God, Dean was nearing a panic attack.
He's chained in a small cell, the room cold and damp. Only a singular light bulb on the far side of the room lights the space, not nearly enough light to reach his cramped cell. It's always dark, not even when Alastair comes does he turn any more lights on.
His dad rolled his eyes, “It’s just me, son. Put that away and come eat so we can get back on the road.”
It didn’t take long for Dean to figure out why the place was empty. His burger tasted like ash and his fries were so undercooked he could barely stomach to eat a few. The disapproving looks from his father were enough to convince him to shove a few more in his mouth before covering the taste up with a long drink of his watered down coke.
It’s hard to believe that the fucker is apparently one of the three leaders of the Aryan Brotherhood in California. Alastair doesn’t necessarily go around spilling state secrets, but he sure does like to run his mouth around Dean. Unfortunately, “California” was about as much as Alastair said about their location.
Mama tells him that he has to wait until Sammy gets older to play with him. Dean really wants to play with him now, but he told Mama that he’d wait. Mama and Daddy play with him now, so he’s content to wait a little while to play with Sammy.
,” he tells her, and she tugs at her hair, looking down at the floor. Bartłomiej looks back at Castiel. “Hannah is very shy.”
“She didn’t speak a lot of English, and my Polish leaves a lot to be desired, but she said that she was blessing the jacket. That this circle she stitched would...”
As he carefully draws arcane symbols onto the door and window frames with a black marker, he entertains a daydream in which John gets caught in the town. Maybe he’ll try to steal from the wrong person and get knocked out cold before he can do them any harm. The police will come, and they’ll figure out who John is, and they’ll find Dean, and he’ll be saved.
The last stretch of road to the camping area is unfinished, and stones rattle and clink against the undercarriage of Castiel’s truck. In the back, the cooler full of food and water slides from side to side with every bump. Castiel eyes it in the rearview, paranoid that the lid is going to fall open and spill every last one of their weekend’s supplies all over the bed.
The leather is warm and soft, and it fits Dean better than he expected. Standing, he moves to look in the mirror, only to find it isn’t where he thought it was. The corner where it stood beside the small window is completely empty, and he glances around to find the mirror standing on the other side of the attic.
, and Castiel sinks down onto his haunches with a pitiful laugh. Dating someone else seems ludicrous right now, and really, what is he thinking of? A rebound for a relationship that never was? He knows that could never string someone along like that without the guilt of it eating him alive, and anyway, it’s entirely possible that he’s never going to get over Dean at all.
“Okay, that might be enough,” Charlie says, heading for her computer. She glances back over her shoulder, gesturing for them to follow. “Any idea on how to spell the guy’s name?”
“Is this--” Dean starts. Castiel nods before he can get any further, mirroring Dean’s hand with his own. Dean’s side is firm beneath his palm. His breath tickles over Castiel’s lips.
“Get dressed,” Dean says as he heads for the bathroom, scooping his jeans and t-shirt up as he goes. “I’m not calling Donna back while you’re lying there doing your best Kate Winslet impression. No matter how much I like it.”
Reaching for a notepad on the coffee table, Cas jots down the numbers, asking Dean for specifics as he does, and quickly calculates the conversion rate.
Standing with his back to the stockade, Dean stares across the bustling Moondoor Market, watching as Charlie stops beside a stall where a cute girl with elf ears is selling enchantments. The dress he made for her looks perfect, but he can hardly manage to appreciate his work.
His back arches, and Dean pulls off, pumping his warm fist over Castiel as he spills. By some wonder, though Dean is still fully clothed, he looks just as blissed out as Castiel feels.
“—you always answered. Even if you didn’t realize you were doing it. Even if your answer wasn’t always what I wanted to hear. In a lot of ways, putting my faith in you is the single most important thing I’ve ever done, because it was the first time in my existence that it was an expression of my own will. Faith became an act of love where before it had always been an act of forced deference. It changed me.
Beside him in the passenger seat, Sam is quiet, staring at his feet in the footwell as if the effort of lifting his head is too much. Dean doesn’t turn on the radio. Some twisted part of him wants them both to stew in it. The silence. The mess. The failure, even though they technically succeeded.
They were fighting less than five minutes ago. Dean was shoving him against the bricks and cursing him. Now, they’re just looking at one another. Sharing space.
When he walks back into the foyer, nothing looks familiar. The hospital is a maze of beige tile and yellowed pine paneling that he can’t hope to navigate without assistance. It’s through sheer chance that help arrives before he has to ask for it.
Somehow, in spite of his struggle to give voice to what he’s feeling, kissing Cas doesn’t feel new. Even when it shifts to something greedier, when it stops being just a kiss and starts being the precursor to something else, something more, it all feels familiar.
The air is icy as they head toward the entrance, and a brisk gust of wind lifts the last remaining leaves from the trees on the edge of the parking lot. As he crunches his boots over a few that lay on the pavement, he catches Sam’s eye and smiles.
“It’s better,” he says, and it doesn’t feel like a lie, or even an exaggeration. He hasn’t looked at it since Dean insisted on bandaging it, but it also hasn’t bothered him in several hours, and the few times that it
Evidently, his recent string of sexual and sensual epiphanies have come with a healthy dose of vanity on the side. He isn’t complaining. From the look he sees Dean give him as he takes his place in the passenger seat, he doesn’t think Dean is complaining either.
Dean wonders despite himself, and Sam’s heavy footfalls carry him into the room just in time for Dean to let out another helpless sob.
But despite his effort, he can’t find even one good reason to argue that wouldn’t expose the truth before they’ve hashed it out. Neither, it seems, can Dean.
“Nowhere. Just outside. I didn’t want to…” Castiel trails off, the end of the sentence doomed to drag them into the woods no matter how he tries to rearrange it.
Still standing by the bed, Castiel undresses them both slowly, sliding fingers between buttons and gently working them free before leaning in to press his lips to Dean’s chest. His kisses are light, his hands tickling over Dean’s ribs as he pushes the shirt aside.
He wants to ask the man’s name, to ask if he’s really Castiel, but he’s scared of the answer. Instead he just shrugs a little and gives an awkward wave.
“You’re getting better at this,” Dean says a few paces away from the car. “The interviewing witnesses stuff. That was a nice move in there with the notepad.”
is an understatement. But I’ve been told I’m odd my entire life, so ‘weird’ doesn’t really bother me.”
Castiel knows that, of course. But he’s not about to miss an opportunity to make Dean laugh, and acting oblivious to this kind of thing has been a sure-fire method for as long as they’ve known one another. Admittedly, he
It’s absurd how adamant Dean is about Castiel not using his grace to help with his discomfort. He wonders if he’d allow Castiel to help him if he simply used his hands by human means.
They fall silent, and Dean doesn’t look at him. He can’t. He wants to ask Cas if he’s okay; wants to talk to him about this mess they’re in, losing Mom, losing Jack, his waning powers, how fucking hopeless this all feels and how much he needs to know that they’re all still in this together.
“Look at us,” Dean says, looking up at him. “First kiss, first fight, first make-up, and it’s not even eight in the morning. That’s gotta be a new record.”
“The bodies,” Dean repeats, slow, still a little off-kilter, and then his brain kicks back into drive. Right. Ghost-Gacy’s victims. The teenage girls Cas mentioned finding in a blood-splattered bedroom. The Sheriff, whose heart Belphegor had ripped right out of his chest while Dean watched in muted horror from six feet away. He’s still not sure how the hell they’re going to make
It’s a lie that neither of them believes, but right now they’ve got a world to save. It doesn’t matter if they’re okay. They just need to keep fighting. They need to be ready. Focused. They can’t drop the ball now.
“I’m fine,” he says on impulse, but the pain radiates even as it dulls, like the reverberating hum of a church bell. He feels it from toes to teeth.
In the school cafeteria, Dean discovers that while he’s been busy trying to suppress his impending meltdown, the locals have been hard at work setting up a makeshift base camp.
“Thank you,” he says again, and hopes Dean hears everything in the words, because gratitude is not enough, but even love falls short.
Dean’s barely opened his mouth to deny it, but Charlie levels him with a judgemental brow before he can tell her a single word. There’s no use. He sighs.
“Honestly?” Castiel says quietly before he drains his glass and returns it to the table with a hollow clink. “I’d rather not.”
“I checked Sam’s shoulder again,” Cas says without preamble, Dean lifts his eyes from where they were fixed on his hands.
“The worst thing that could possibly happen to anybody would be to not be used for anything by anybody. Thank you for using me, even though I didn't want to be used by anybody.”
The late afternoon sun turns the sky pink and gold, making the forest far more beautiful than it has any business being on such a day, and he trudges onward as the mud grows thicker. Turns to sticky sludge that slows him down and pulls at his feet. He wants to lie down and let it claim him. He keeps on walking.
But once he’s started thinking about it, he realizes that doesn’t want to wait. He wants Cas to do it
“Have you had much trouble here?” Castiel asks, dipping his head in gratitude as Bartłomiej trades the bowl of dirty water for a mug of hot tea.
The sound of it is loud, and Dean swears under his breath as he drags himself up into the attic. He’s just pulled his feet up over the edge when the man reaches the landing.
“You did,” Dean interrupts his thoughts, and it takes a moment for Castiel to remember what they’d even been talking about. The god-awful movie they’re about to see. He frowns harder still and keeps walking, following Benny in the dark and trusting that he knows which door to lead them through.
To Castiel’s disappointment, the lemur enclosure has a sign in front announcing that it has been temporarily closed. Dean seems more disappointed than Castiel.
With sharking hands, he slides the antenna out and presses his thumb hard against the power button. The screen stays dark. Nothing happens.
from Dean’s lips is incongruous and confusing until Castiel feels a wet thumb dragging down the cleft of his ass.
There’s a kind of murky, anxious energy in the air, and with every jolt of turbulence, Castiel feels himself flinch. He gets like this, sometimes. When it’s been too long since they engaged the enemy, though it’s not that he actually
“I did, but time ran at a different speed there. Every second here is a minute there. Almost every time I went back, it was like months had passed even if it was only a few days for me. Shit, I need to-- do you have a pen?”
His pants go the same way, lost between one breathless moment and the next, and Dean touches every stretch of skin he can get his hands on.
“I want to kiss you until it stops being novel,” he says with a shaky grin, “and then I want to kiss you again.”
Two gray concrete walls, two red brick. A desk, a bed, a narrow bookshelf. A table with two chairs, where Dean had spent several late nights trying to convince Cas that his insomnia was, in fact, a feature and not a bug.
He doesn’t know how he’ll look at anybody. He doesn’t want to think about how people will look at him. The people who know what happened will pity him; the people who don’t won’t understand all the things that make his body lock up in fear.
He’s not sure why the lie fell so easily from his tongue, but the thought of Dean rushing back out of pity makes him crumple inward. He’d rather spend the next few months as he has spent the last than feel like an obligation. He gives Dean what he hopes seems like an easy smile, and Dean looks away, embarrassed.
Now, he has this. Thousands of miles between himself and his home, his family, the people he loves. The man he loves.
It blew both of his previous forays into the composition of crush-fueled mixtapes—Cassie Robinson, in the seventh grade, and Lisa Braeden, in the ninth—clean out of the water.
They’re finally on their way back to the high school just after midnight, Jules and Paul trailing behind them in her clunky old Ford pickup, when Dean realizes he’s barely said a word since sundown.
“I mean, I don’t— I’m not looking for a play-by-play or anything, but just. I know it’s gotta be harder. Like, how did you even get to that point with a guy without being scared you were gonna get clocked in the jaw?”
“The—” his throat seizes again, and he swallows hard, forces the words out past the sour taste still lingering in his mouth. “It was the Empty.”
,” Dean parrots, closing his eyes and leaning the back of his head against the window, arms crossed over his chest. One handed, Castiel reaches into the back seat to grab his coat and jacket. He tosses them onto Dean’s lap.
, and despite everything, Castiel grins right back at him. Dean tries to wipe the tears from his face, but he’s weak, and his hand is too bulky with bandages, so Castiel does it for him.
“Don’t give me this just a flesh wound crap,” Dean snaps. “I’ve seen you shake off a dozen bullets without breaking a sweat, so why hasn’t this already healed?”
for any of the things that Dean could possibly be alluding to. But if Castiel plays his cards right, perhaps he can at least get Dean to tell him what he’s thinking. It’ll give them both something to look forward to once they get back to their room tonight.
“Magic jacket,” Dean says with a shrug. “I’ve honestly got no idea how it works, but... that’s the gist.”
,” Dean gasps out as Cas slows his movements even more, mouth tilting to one side in an artful smirk that reminds Dean vividly of a night years past, back when Dean had still been able to pass off the low swoop in his stomach whenever Cas was around as a combination of lust and fear in the presence of something powerful and otherworldly. A night outside a cheap motel in Ohio, streetlight glinting in Cas’ eyes as he’d said,
“I think we both know there was very little chance of that approach being remotely sustainable, even if it weren’t for this…” he trails off, searching for the right words to describe what they’re on the precipice of doing together.
He takes a photo of the sculpture and after a moment of deliberation, sends it to Claire with the caption;
He carries everything to the counter, and half-listens as Nora apologizes for having no available shifts for him in the coming week.
“How the hell did you keep this a secret?” Dean asks once they reach his room. “You’re usually the most obvious liar in the world.”
“I’m reasonably certain, yes,” he replies, and smiles. “Do we need to do anything before we head out?”
Of course, he knows that more often than not, it comes down to money. His own brief time as a human taught him just how far every dollar needs to stretch when you don’t have a lot to spare, and even the seemingly limitless bank account full of stolen funds that Charlie had set up for the brothers before she died can’t be relied upon to last forever.
Pushing to his feet, Dean stretches out his arms and looks around, stooping to grab his duffel full of records. He settles it onto his shoulder.
The energy Ruqayya pulls from him will give her the strength to restore the tree to its former glory, and she will allow him to take as much fruit as he needs with no conditions. The union, he sees, is necessary. Without it, they would both be at a disadvantage. The djinn could drain Castiel completely as he slept, defenseless; Castiel’s grace could burn through Ruqayya’s very being without his even trying.
, he’d thought. He’d made his peace with it. Being near Dean was enough, if being with Dean was not an option.
Something in the trees catches Dean’s attention, then, and he sits up straighter on the branch before looking over at Castiel and gesturing for quiet before he points. Castiel follows his finger, but whatever it is, it’s not visible from where he’s standing.
“Of all of it, Dean. I’ve hurt you so many times. I’ve broken your trust, I’ve caused more problems than I’ve solved. Made so many mistakes.”
Hell, he'd even planned the night leading up to handing it over, and took Cas to see a movie that he knew he’d hate. He'd known Cas would spend the whole time cringing through the horror movie--not because he was afraid, because he’s always been far too stubborn for fear to get the best of him—but because he's disgusted by gratuitous blood and gore. He always curls in Dean’s direction through the most violent scenes of every slasher flick they've seen together.
Licking into Cas’ mouth in a filthy slide that has Cas tightening his hold around Dean’s wrist as his thrusts grow more erratic, Dean’s mind spins through the ways they could be together. All the ways that Cas could dismantle him.
Sleep deprivation, he remembers reading once, is often used as torture. People lose their minds. Internal processes go into overdrive and then shut down; the brain starts to misfire, making people see things that aren’t there. Tricks them into imagining phantom sights and sounds and slights that make them fly off the handle for no good reason or retreat into themselves in terror.
Jack is dead. Mom is dead. Belphegor clears his throat, impatient, and Dean wants to be sick. There’s no time.
Pulling open the fridge, he pushes a bottle of ketchup aside before his eyes fall on the small package of meat wrapped in butcher’s paper. He unwraps it and sighs at the miserable sight.
“Huh,” Dean bites down on a Red Vine and grins around it as he asks, “Eaten a lot of ass lately, Cas?”
He knows everything John has told him, and knows that as long as John believes it, he has to act like he believes it too.
As much as he hates to admit it, she’s right. Dean can already see Sam’s phone in his hand, running a search on one of the occult sites they use, but he’s not ready to throw in the
Through Cas’ grace, still rolling through him like Cas has forgotten how to reel it back in, Dean sees everything.
Dean takes the one that Cas always preferred, and tries to keep himself from asking Jack to complete his thought, to tell him what else it was that he chose. But he
And… there had been something humming under his skin, in the graveyard. Something pushing, making his muscles twitch toward the weapon he’d dropped. A pulse, an electric buzz that made him feel as though it would have been easier to just
Sliding his hand to Castiel’s cheek, Dean steps close and kisses him. The camera presses uncomfortably into his stomach.
They’re both just looking at him, waiting, and Dean knows he has to keep going. Has to tell them what happened. But it’s personal, and it’s fresh, and Dean— he’s rudderless at sea.
Pulling off, Castiel looks up at him, and Dean finally lets go of the pillow to reach down and touch his face. When he swipes his thumb over Castiel’s lower lip, Castiel catches it with his teeth, biting down gently. Dean’s eyes focus on the action as if he’s committing it to memory. Perhaps he is. Castiel can’t help but hope so.
As they cut through the flat stretch of farmland with the windows down, Dean sings along quietly, and Castiel watches him from the passenger seat.
Instead, over the hours it takes to get them to the diner in Munroe City, then onward toward Danville, they talk about
“He seemed a bit glum, but he was never a particularly cheerful fellow, so I’m afraid I didn’t think on it too much,” Winchester reported.
But the thought of Bobby and Ellen waiting for him, of having to talk about any of this once he has to leave Dean for the night… it makes his stomach twist, sick with nerves.
There’s a particular kind of silence that’s as loud as a slammed door. As Dean walks away from Castiel for the third time in the past two days, the silence that trails after him is enough to make his ears ring.
The problem, of course, is that neither of them wants to hurt the other. Not really. Not in any way that lasts.
Dean wants to grind down against Cas’ fingers, wants to push up into his mouth—but he won’t. Cas asked him not to move, and Dean is determined to do as he’s told. To let Cas decide how much to give him. To be good.
,” Dean gasps, squeezing his hands so tightly together that Castiel can see his knuckles turning white. “I’ve created a monster.”
“You know… for millennia, I prayed to God for help and guidance, because it was what I was supposed to do. But he never answered. Not even once. But you—“
No, he thinks as he steadies his gaze on their lead plane and presses the button on his interphone. Red is far too great a color for War.
. And Cas, who has on occasion waited patiently in an uncomfortable motel armchair for eight freaking hours, whose entire concept of time is grossly skewed by the fact that he’s a million fucking years old, has firmly placed that ball in Dean’s court.
“Yeah, well. I don’t love lying to him every time I help you fellas or Jody on a hunt. Something’s gotta give, y’know? But enough about me, let me give you the intel before I have to head in to work.”
“Sorry. I really didn’t think it’d take so long, and then I, uh… I waited until Sam went to bed,” Dean says. He actually looks a little ashamed to admit it. “Kinda felt like a teenage girl sneaking out to meet the hot quarterback.”
He’d locked the basement door before he’d gone. Dean can still hear the heavy click in the back of his mind. He can hear it. He can
“Of course, Cas,” she says, a relieved tone to her voice. “I’m so glad. But— you said your grace is still healing? Does that mean you’re at risk?”
he swallows the words as he moves, and works his throat around every breath as he tries again. Thinks of the tape he’d made Cas. Thinks of the lyrics he’d contemplated as he’d planned the track listing. Breathing out, he feels his pulse slow, and starts over as his fingers close around the blanket. “
It’s not a crush—it stopped being that a while ago. It’s the real thing. It’s love, and it hurts like hell.
He flattens his palm over Dean’s heart, tilting his head up, toward Dean, and is rewarded with another kiss.
“They want me to talk with someone,” Dean says, his eyes still closed, and Castiel rubs his thumb along Dean’s so he knows he’s listening. “A trauma therapist. Said it’ll help me, y’know… process.”
“What happened to you having no idea what I meant?” Dean teases, sliding his hands around Castiel’s hips and pushing the jeans down to bunch around his thighs. Castiel rocks forward a little, then back against Dean’s palms when they cup his ass through his underwear and squeeze.
If Dean were to ask why, he’d say that the coat bunches up uncomfortably when he sits on it. He wouldn’t add that it’s also because he’s noticed in the handful of times he’s worn fewer layers that Dean seems to appreciate the sight of his forearms. If he’s going to make a new habit of doing things for pleasure alone, he sees no reason why that shouldn’t include things that make Dean look at him a little longer.
He wraps his arms tightly around her and tries not to break down, tries to give back as much comfort as he’s taking. He’s more thankful than he could ever express for this family who drew him in and let him linger after Dean was gone, let him hold on to whatever small part of his best friend remained.
Red might be the color of blood and fire, but both mean life as much as anything else. Red is flushed cheeks. Flowers in window-boxes. Wine and song and sunsets. Red is everything that war is not.
“I noticed an energy. In the wound,” he says, and Dean gets the strange impression that the words took a lot of effort to force out. Once he’s started, though, the rest flows like whisky from an open bottle. “It’s unlike anything I’ve encountered before, and I don’t know whether it’s residual energy from the weapon that caused it, or if it’s just my powers waning, but when I tried to heal it… it was as though the wound was throwing my grace back at me. Like a mirror, or an echo, or… I don’t know how to describe it. I’ll try again, but we may have to look into alternatives if I can’t fix it. I meant to tell you earlier, but…”
It held that same smell of old books, deeper than in the bunker’s library for the sheer number of stacks that filled the space, and it washed over him at once. In his minds eye, he’d seen Jianhong’s library as clear as day. He’d remembered exactly how he’d felt in the moments he’d spent there—the unfamiliar panic, his desperation to find a way to reach Dean, the sense of impending disaster that had hovered like a fog over everything back then. He remembered the layout of the furniture; the pattern of the carpet on the floor; the copy of
Dean snorts, but finally stops pestering him and crawls to the front of the tent. Chill air rolls in when he unzips the door, and Castiel listens as he pulls his boots on, his feet crunching over leaves and grass as he wanders off into the trees nearby.
Dean’s bedroom door is closed when they pass it, and Sam clings to him like a shadow all the way to the kitchen. He doesn’t protest when Castiel starts up the coffee—by some strange twist of fate, it seems that Castiel is the only one who can coax the ancient percolator to make anything remotely potable. The water bubbles. Sam doesn’t say a word; just waits for Castiel to pour a cup, and then moves to get his own.
They’re still pressed together in the storeroom, Cas’ hands fixed to his waist, his lips close enough that Dean feels them brush against his own when he speaks, and the sensation is grounding. Something real and solid that he can hold onto.
The scars left by wounds that Dean hadn’t allowed him to heal; his bruised knuckles; the delicate skin of his wrists and his inner thighs; his muscled arms and soft stomach; the freckles on his chest, still visible through the flush that’s spread there. Every inch of him is a masterpiece, and for the first time since he pulled him from Hell, Castiel doesn’t feel the need to disguise his captivation.
“Can we--” Castiel starts at the same moment, and Dean nods for him to go on. Castiel sighs. “Could we just... for tonight, can we just not think about this?”
“That close?” Castiel asks, sitting forward, and Dean’s heart sinks when he realizes how hopeful Castiel is. He hadn’t realized how much he’d been hoping Castiel might stay.  Now, he just feels like a jerk for being disappointed at the idea of Castiel returning to his own time. Plastering on a smile, he pats Castiel on the shoulder and lies through his teeth.
At the desk, the clerk has two room keys waiting along with Castiel’s card, and his brow is furrowed as he tries to parse what he seems to think was a comment directed at him.
Cas recoils as though he’s been struck, and guilt floods through Dean like poison. He knows he’s crossed a line, but he can’t take the words back.
, Castiel’s mind supplies, and he pushes the thought away just in time for Dean to make him wonder if he’d been too hasty in rejecting it. “I don’t think I can stand to be alone tonight, either.”
It’s not a lie. Emotionally speaking, he’s perfectly fine. His restlessness isn’t due to nerves over being caught sneaking around back here, though such fears would be well within reason. He’s just cold and irritated. Benny was supposed to sneak them into the movie almost ten minutes ago, and if he takes much longer they’re going to miss the opening scene.
”I could cook the saugeye?” he offers, and Castiel pats him on the shoulder before pushing to his feet.
“I need to try again with Sam, obviously. Maybe take the day to butter him up first,” he says, and hesitates. Castiel already knows what he’s going to say.
“Not without suppressing my grace entirely, but that would also mean I’d stop healing. So,” he shrugs, then smiles. “And if I’m being entirely honest, it’s usually… nice. Having that connection. Knowing that you’re thinking of me.”
is the short drive home from Sam’s middle school dance, when Dean turned up the radio from the passenger seat and teased his red-faced brother about his poorly concealed crush on a girl from his English class—until Mom told him to cut it out unless he wanted Sam to be the only one getting ice-cream from the drive-thru on the way back to the house.
He doesn’t even need to tell her he needs to be alone; Charlie hugs him tightly and drops a noisy kiss to the side of his head.
“I just found it,” he says, grabbing the handbag from the footwell and holding it out toward John like a peace offering. “It was under the seat. I swear, Dad—I just found it.”
As he pulls Dean close, kissing him soundly on the front step, Castiel’s heart pounds hard as he thinks to himself;
Posting this from the airport on my way to Rome for Jibcon, because apparently that’s a thing that’s happening... hopefully all the formatting pastes properly—had to do this from my phone because the airport wifi thinks Ao3 is an inappropriate website. If there are wonky italics I’ll have to fix them when I arrive! Hope you all enjoy the update :)
Thanks to the oversized speakers installed in the trunk by the car’s previous owner, Bobby’s wheelchair doesn’t quite fit into the Continental, so the three of them pile into Ellen’s SUV by necessity. Ellen’s hands stay tight on the wheel for the entire journey.
She narrows her eyes, but does as he says. As soon as she notices the faded handwriting, her mouth falls open.
He can feel Cas’ heartbeat against his cheek. It’s slow and steady. Peaceful. Dean thinks it’ll help him sleep, if Cas will lie here with him.
Narrowing his eyes, Castiel looks back at Dean and finds him beaming from ear-to-ear, clearly amused by his own smart-ass comments. It’s unfair, is what it is. Finding Dean endearing even when he’s being the biggest pain in the ass imaginable.
“Dean, every time a guy hits on you, you freak out. Remember Aaron?” There’s silence for a moment. Castiel can practically hear Dean screaming in his head, because true as it may be, he suspects that the freaking out that Sam has witnessed has been less panic and more fluster. “Not to mention how grossed out you get every time some motel clerk mistakes us for a couple.”
“If only,” Dean smirks, bright-eyed as he shuffles forward, shifting his hands higher until his fingers slip beneath the edge of Castiel’s underwear. He plucks at the fabric, pulling it taut and then letting it loose, over and over, until Castiel is hard and aching. The sensation is at once too much and nowhere near enough. It’s maddening. Castiel’s mouth falls open and his eyes sink closed, and when Dean finally pulls his cock out and
Dean stares out the window, willing one of them to glance in his direction. Willing someone to notice, to
Soon was cut off before it could arrive, blocked by crisis after crisis after crisis, and Dean had put it on the back-burner, replaced
But they’re not real. He’s safe. The sigils are meaningless. The warding is useless. Anyone could cross the line. He’s a sitting duck.
Dean chews on his lip, like he’s trying to find an excuse to stay a little longer, or find some other thing to say, but he stands without saying a word and shoves his hands back into his pockets.
The attic is actually kind of nice, Dean decides, sitting back in the armchair that is apparently stronger than it looks. After Charlie left, he flicked through the albums again and settled on a Billie Holiday single that reminded him of his grandmother, and now he listens to her voice lilting, sad and sweet.
(It does not escape his notice that he’s retained most of the worst aspects of human existence, while losing most of the good ones. The trade off is one that he neither understands nor appreciates, and more than once he’s wondered if it’s been done to him on purpose as a punishment for his many crimes. It would not be beyond Chuck to orchestrate something like this.)
NORMAL, ILLINOIS The hunt for missing Lieutenant Castiel Novak has been called off today, after a number of drafted letters were discovered in his home. The letters, when shown to Novak’s uncle (who wished to remain unnamed), were confirmed to be in his handwriting, and the contents in line with his character. Police declined to comment publicly on the specifics, instead stating that the contents of the letters were sufficient proof that Novak had willingly moved out of state with a fellow returned serviceman identified only as D.
Turning the notepad, Castiel shows Parker what he’s written as he asks aloud, “Are any of them still close with her?”
Police have expressed interest in speaking with a second serviceman, who was seen in Novak’s company a few days before his disappearance. The fellow was described as being in his twenties, fair haired, and tall.
Since Cas left, Dean has opened his text message thread more times than he can count just to stare at the conversation there.
Bao Jianhong had been a scholar in life—a perpetual student even once reaching the top of his field—and his hunger for knowledge, for the joy of learning, did not ease once he passed through to the afterlife. The little corner of heaven that was his library was cluttered but comfortable, and the light that shone through the tall windows was gold as the hour before sunset, glittering off dust motes and making the whole space warm and welcoming. Even the smell of the place was soothing—lignin permeating the air with a faint hint of vanilla as the books on all their rows of shelves aged according to Jianhong’s memory.
“Alright then, let’s get a move on, I want to reach Phoenix by early tomorrow evening.” Dean nodded and started to head for the door, “Behave while we’re gone, Sam. Thanks for the hospitality, Bobby. I’ll let you know when we’re headed back this way.” And with that John followed Dean out of the house.
Dean leaned back against the wall, taking a few breaths to get his scent under control, "I know you can, Sammy, but me and Dad both still worry about you and I don't want anything to happen while I'm not there. Besides, I know how much you like staying here. I know for a fact that you haven't made it through Bobby’s entire collection of books yet." As much as it killed Dean to leave Sam, he knew it was for the best. Bobby would keep a good eye on the kid while they were gone.
Alastair takes a few steps forward, squatting down in front of Dean. His left arm holds his blazer open while his right reaches inside of the jacket. Dean remains motionless as Alastair draws out a syringe, his breath coming in short bursts when Alastair attaches a needle to the end of it. Dean’s scent spikes with fear, and Alastair takes a deep breath, seemingly reveling in it.
The door swings inward, revealing a heavily muscled Alpha. He’s tall and broad, with dark hair and the hint of a beard. Dean doesn’t see the key to the door, but he usually doesn’t so it’s not a surprise. What is a surprise is that the Alpha’s holding a box. And not just a flimsy cardboard box, but a nice, probably insulated, metal one.
