"Can I get you anything?" Castiel asked.
"We're not dating, Cas." Dean chuckled.
"You ass. I'm having a panic attack, and you're trying to seduce me?"
The date with Inias went fine, nothing special. It was almost sad in its own right talking to him again. Hearing all about how torn up Inias was after Cas left. A part of him wanted to say "We were just kids and that was decades ago. Get over it." But he didn't. He couldn't because maybe he couldn't get over the nostalgia either.
"You love my dirty mouth." Cas gleamed beautifuly, cheeks flushed and lips red.
The tension was somewhat relieved after a dinner back home, and Cas even placed his hand on Deans thigh as he, Sam and Eileen all ate dinner together. The talked a little about the hunt, but thankfully Sam didn't push more on Robin. They even got Cas laughing at some jokes by the time they finished eating. Sam suggested they play uno and Cas had never played before so everyone was excited.
"I love you too, son... and what did we say about chick flick moments?" They both laughed before Rufus called John over and he bid them farewell. Castiel sighed relief and a bit of joy as Dean kissed him on the temple. Castiel could only hope that he would make John proud by taking care of Dean in the future.
"Ah, well give lover boy a kiss for me."
"Nah. Just enjoying it." Dean smiled up at Castiel.
"What's going on?" He asked Dean since Sam was in no state to answer.
He remembered the first time Inias told him he loved him. It was in the warmth of an April night while the two were sweaty and tangled in bed together. They were just kids and Castiel didn't know any better so he said he loved him too.
"That's perfectly fine, Dean. So does he know about your sexuality?"
"And we are too man. For what you did," Sam said grabbing Eileens waist. "Because of you we were able to stop Chuck and get everyone back."
Dean rubbed his eyes and took a deep breath. He fell back into their bed for a minute and just smelled Cas on the pillows. Just smelled the intoxicating smell that was his lover. He can't believe he almost ruined this for good. Almost lost Cas from his life all because he's a grown man who can't get his shit together.
The three of them talked, mostly about lighthearted things. They talked so long, Cas had to reheat their food so they didn't go hungry. They ate and socialized and overall, Cas thought that John actually liked him which made him happy. John shared some stories about Dean as a kid, and how he sort of always figured Dean was queer. By the time they started to run out of things to talk about it was around nine, and John had to go since it was eleven there. They hung up and Dean sighed back into the couch.
They sat on the couch with their dinners as Dean pulled up his laptop, much calmer than before. He took a dee breath before pressing call. It rang a few times and pixilated before Deans father came into view. Castiel was off to the side, probably not in the camera view he thought.
"Back when we were trying to get the Mark of Cain off your arm, Cas had to work with me, behind your back. We got into a lot of fights and he finally admitted it was because he was in love with you." He chuckled. "Boy that was crazy to hear then."
so side note, I HATE John Winchester. I just wanted to see what it would be like if he became a good father to Dean. He is very out of character in this story cuz he’s gonna die lol
"Look, I want to figure this out as soon as possible too. But, we can't focus or get done what we need to if we're not we'll rested. Four hours, tops."
"I'm going back to bed." Dean said gruffly. He was not doing this now. He just needed to suck it the hell up like his father told him. Get over it. Sam didn't try and stop him so he just went back into his bedroom.
Castiel took a little too long to type for Deans taste.
Promise not to kill my plants?
"Gabriel Novak is a film director. He's fairly wealthy and has a number of homes. One here in Compiègne, one in Paris, Arles and a summer home in Marseille."
Inias stumbled towards the bedroom, couch cushion still held over his crotch.
Cas pushed him down onto the bed with a smile on his face. Dean willingly spread his legs as an invitation.
"What are you saying? What are you so worried about?"
"Yeah, okay." Dean shrugged. The two of them headed outside and sat at the small little table looking out across Compiègne. Castiel took a long sip of his coffee sighing as the caffeine started to fuel his mind and body. He took a bite into the eggs Dean had made. It appeared to be a simple omelette, but it was delicious. It was seasoned perfectly and he didn't even know how Dean knew where his spices and seasonings were.
"Come in." Cas said. Eileen opened the door and her expression was serious.
"You wanted to smell like me." Dean leveled Cas with a Sam Winchester worthy Bitch Face™
Castiel sighed his frustration and went into the kitchen to pour himself a glass of Beaujolais. He enjoyed the sweet burn of the wine as he drank it slowly. He poured himself a second glass before going back out onto the balcony. He set his glass down and went back inside to quickly grab his box of sativa. He opened the box and pulled out the small, thin wrapping papers and packed up his roach. He grimaced when he accidentally licked some of the leaf but finished rolling it and lit up. Despite marijuana being illegal in France, his brother Gabriel almost always had some and practically became Castiels dealer. He closed his eyes on the first inhale and held in the smoke as it clouded his mind. He went back out to the balcony and stared at his canvas once more. He slowly started adding more colors as he drank and smoked away. A sudden knock at the door dragged him out of his concentration and he snubbed out the rest of his roach as he walked towards the door. He looked through the peep hole to see his brother Gabriel on the other side. He rolled his eyes as he opened the door.
Dean woke in the middle of the night to an empty bed. He groaned slightly missing the feeling of Castiels warm body snuggled next to his. He sat up and looked around the dark room in search of him but quickly relaxed when he heard the bathroom sink. Castiel came out of the bathroom a moment later, but to Deans surprise he didn't crawl back in bed. If Cas had noticed Dean was awake, he didn't say anything. Instead he walked around the bed clad in a silky blue robe that Dean found to be quite hot, and grabbed something from his nightstand. He walked back over to the window sill and sat down on the cushioned bench and started sketching away. Deans eyes were mostly closed but he could tell that Castiel kept looking at him. The room was dark, the only lights were those of the city and from the moon coming in through the window which was probably why Castiel was sitting there. He didn't know why Cas felt the need to draw right then and there but he didn't mind. He listened to the soft sound of the pencil scratching and the sound of the paper crinkling when he'd brush off the led. It was calming and grounding and overall peaceful.
"Dean, I'm pregnant..." Deans eyes popped open in shock and he almost had to do a double take. "I love Sam and I want to raise this baby with him... but hunting is no life for a child. I'm scared because I don't know if he will give that up."
Dean slept deeply that night. He dozed off happy and pleasantly sore from post-coital bliss wrapped in Castiels strong arms. He tried to stay awake tracing the planes of Cas's body, the soft angles and divots of his muscles. He tried to memorize every inch of him before the calm warmth pulled him under into a deep sleep. He crashed with a smile on his face and he woke up with another one. He was up long before Castiel and laid in bed for a long time, just watching Castiel sleep. He carded his fingers through his hair and placed kisses along his shoulders and his tattoos until Cas woke up with a bright gleam. They made out long and slow until Dean had to go to school but the smile never left his face. And every time he said the words in his head his grin got even wider to the point his face hurt.
"It's my life." Dean said weakly.
"Oh thank god." Cas said with relief.
He read until the lines and words and symbols melded together. It was almost redundant, since by the time he had finished a page, his mind wouldn't work and he'd have to re-read it. It felt like it was going no where. They still had no clue as to where they could find a reaper, not to mention Deaths scythe was in the empty with Billie. They only had down three ingredients for the binding spell on Death, and no clue where to get the rest. But the more he read, the longer he read, the sooner they'd figure everything out and the sooner he could get Castiel back.
"Why would I get bored of our sex life?"
"I got a matching tattoo with my ex girlfriend Meg. She used to call me her unicorn so we got minimalist unicorn tattoos together."
"He's losing weight. Like- it's concerning me. When we first met he was a relatively fit guy, and further into our relationship he even put on some weight. But now," Cas sighed. "Now he almost looks sick."
"What?" Dean asked with a humorless chuckle.
"I believe I am unfamiliar with the sound. Is it a song?" He asked.
"He was just trying to do better," he said barely above a whisper. "He just wanted me to be happy. Wanted to make it right. Wanted to fix it and I ignored him. And now... now he's gonna die."
Dean was quiet for a moment looking down at his hands. He stayed silent for a long time and Castiel almost said something else but then Dean answered.
He woke a short time later to a tickling of kisses on his neck. He chuckled as he forced his eyes to open. Dean was smiling, green eyes glowing in the warm morning light. He leaned back down peppering kisses along Castiels neck and clavicle.
The second letter.
"It has?"
"Of course! My girlfriend Dorothee came too. She's as much of a nerd for your art as I am. But aahhhh!" She squealed. "You guys are getting married!"
"Easy for you to say. Your entire back is tattooed. You probably don't even know what pain is."
"Dean," Sam sighed and pulled up the chair to sit next to him. "I know whatever happened with Cas is bothering you but... you need to talk about it."
"That's ridiculous. Of course not." Castiel took a deep breath before adding: "I didn't want to be with Inias. I thought it might make me feel better, but it didn't."
"Awesome."
"Well, you always call me angel, and I actually think that, that's what you are to me. It's a little weird. I've never done biblically accurate angels before, but I thought you would make a perfect candidate."
"Art show?"
"No I know... I just- I'm not very experienced. Y'know... with men." He stammered.
"Thanks, Cas."
"It actually looks pretty good." He mumbled into Deans hair. "Plehh," he said spitting. "Paint in my mouth."
"Dammit Cas."
"You're disgusting." Cas sputtered through his laugh.
Castiel was walking on a cloud by the time he made it to the little bistro with Gabriel. Gabe of course got his coffee loaded with sugar and cream while Cas enjoyed the bitter blackness of his own.
"Dork," Dean scoffed. "I wasn't thinking something big. Just maybe like a phrase. Something meaningful."
"Is everything okay?" He asked a little scared now.
They listened to lots of music and played cat games, idly talking like old times alone the way. They spent hours cooped up in the black, leather interior car during the heat of summer before it became too much. The sun had already started to go down by the time they made it to a motel. The drive to Ada County was supposed to be seventeen hours long, so they already planned on stopping for the night as is. They made it as far as Jacinto Nebraska right as the sun went down beyond the horizon. They pulled up to a Sleep Inn motel just outside of Wyoming where they agreed to spend the night. Cas stayed in the car while Dean went inside to get their room.
"It's... bad."
Castiel ducked his head in shame. Not that he was ashamed of Dean, but because he hated those words. Words that he had been called so often throughout his entire life. Castiel looked at Dean briefly and his eyes were wide and filled with rage.
"Naked?" Cas asked looking up at Dean momentarily. He sighed happily. "You're perfect. C'mere."
Dean nodded and Cyrus was gone. He turned to Sam and shrugged before they loaded up their things in the Impala. The headed back to the bunker on a supply run before they headed out. Arizona, that was at least a fourteen hour drive. But they were going to do it. They had to.
"You're an asshole." Cas scoffs elbowing Dean.
"Well I just wanted to come by and ask ab-" he stopped mid sentence looking across the living room.
"Which ones did you pick?" He punctuated with a nip to his earlobe.
"Dean, don't egg him on. Let's just go." He whispered.
Cas smiled brightly, the corners of his eyes quirking with his gleaming teeth. He leaned down to kiss along Deans soft abdomen, nibbling below his navel in the way that makes Deans eyes flutter shut. He kissed down his boxer clad hips and thighs down to his knees just building anticipation. Finally he pulled the waistband of his briefs; lifting his hips up, Dean made it easier to pull them down. Cas popped the cap of the lube bottle and Deans whole body shuddered at the noise. Cas kissed him deeply again and started murmuring to distract him.
"Inias," Cas said, "give us a minute, will you?"
Dean decided then that he was going to call everyone. He went to his room and dialed on his phone, Jody, Donna, Garth, Bobby, Charlie, Alex, everyone. Most of them said that they would be there Friday at the latest. Just as he was sitting on the end of the bed, he tossed his phone back into the pillow and sighed heavily. There was a slight knock on the door that Dean recognized as Eileens instantly. Her knock was very soft and had a certain rhythm to it.
Castiel was past the point of pleasantly buzzed. His stomach churned and waves blurred into his vision. Ever since Inias asked him out at the bar on Friday night, Castiel had been drinking himself away. He hadn't seen his old boyfriend since he was sixteen and to be asked out by him twelve years later was... conflicting. On the one hand he truly was happy to see Inias again. He had missed him once he moved to France. But on the other he knew he no longer had feelings for his ex-teenage lover. Still he couldn't refuse when he asked him out on a date Tuesday night.
"I'm not 'juggling' them. Inias wanted to catch up and Dean is... well you know."
Castiel paused in his movements for a moment. He didn't know how to respond to that and he was afraid Gabriel was right. He sighed with a shake of his head before pulling his pants on. As he sat on the foot of his bed to pull his boots on, Gabriel sauntered into his closet.
"Me either."
"Yes, I have it right here. Letters?"
Dean,
"Shut up." Cas chuckled.
"He wouldn't want this for you, you know." Dean blinked at Sam. To anyone else, coming from anyone else, it would seem like a heartfelt honest statement. But the way Sam said it, it's like he already knew about the feelings Dean had about Cas. Which is crazy because Dean doesn't even really understand them. Sam tapped the doorframe and walked out, leaving Dean in the dim lit room alone with his thoughts. With Dean alone he couldn't help but wonder.
"How many people have you been with?" Dean asked through a mouthful of food.
"We're gonna meet our daughter tomorrow..." and Dean grinned before turning around and kissing his husband deeply.
"Mornin', Cas." He smiled as he pecked a quick kiss on Castiels lips. "Want me to make you breakfast?"
"Could you tell if he is getting close?" Dean asked him hopefully.
"I was a bit busy with six foot four hunk of a man."
"It's... complicated. It comes and goes in intervals. But like I said, I paint my best when your around." Dean blushed twisting the noodles of his pasta for a moment before meeting Castiels eyes.
"Sometimes I hate you." Cas groaned.
He ran into his bedroom and changed. Maybe after they were done eating pies he could take Castiel out to dinner. Suddenly that seemed like a great idea. He changed into a silk button down shirt that was a little tighter than he remembered but made it work by undoing the top two buttons. He threw on the only pair of dress pants he could find and was pretty sure it was a pair that Sam had loaned him. He might be a little more dressed up than he should be for an evening of eating pies with his brother and... well whatever Cas is to him, but he didn't care. He combed his hair a bit in the mirror before walking back out.
"Why's that?" He asked conversationally.
"Hey can I ask you something?" Castiel asked. He and Dean were cuddled up in Cas's bed together after a long nap in the middle of the afternoon.
"Samantha, for Sammy, since he named Dean after me... Jody, because you're my mom. I don't care about blood, you have been my mom for the past fifteen years. So me and Cas both agreed on that."
"I can't believe you're dating such a lightweight." Meg laughs.
"Oh don't tell me you're mad at me." Dean smiled slightly.
"Can I have some of that?" He asked and Dean handed him the bottle. One swig and he grimaced as he handed it back. "Tastes like shit."
He had a smudge of red paint right above his eye brow and his fingers were littered in splotches of greens and browns and blacks. His hair was tousled and mused more than usual, from sex and sleep. He didn't even notice Dean come in, to immersed in his art.
Dean smiled victoriously and sat down. He picked up the book he was reading last night before Sam interjected.
No matter how broken Dean thought he was, how unworthy he was, Castiel knew that Dean deserved the world, and he was going to do his best to give it to him.
Dean woke up early the next morning. Sam and Eileen were still asleep in the bunker. Dean sauntered off to the bathroom and took a much needed shower. The hot spray against his back did as much good as possible what with the now constant ache in his muscles from getting very little sleep. He didn't take too long since he didn't know when Sam would be up and he didn't want to accidentally flash his little brother, so he stepped out of the shower and tossed a towel around his waist. The steam of the room covered the mirrors, but he couldn't bring himself to look up. Last time he saw Cas, he couldn't stand to see him again. So close, yet so far away.
"You forget how close I was with Michael? He seemed to have high regards for that as well."
"Did you think about me?"
"Yeah, you are pretty beautiful." Dean smirked and Cas shoved his shoulder with a laugh. Dean tried to stifle a yawn but Cas must've noticed because he pulled Samantha out of his arms. Dean whined his protest before Cas placated him.
"As long as it's not about your sex life, you can tell me anything."
"More like you got stuck with me. My boyfriend, an incredibly sexy, successful artist, covered in tattoos with a penchant for expensive weed and a knowledge for good literature. And you chose a manic  bisexual with fuck tons of trauma who wants to make food for a living. Yeah, I think I came out on top here."
"Surprised you remember." He said. Sam looked between the two of them.
"I'll go first!" Gabe laughed. "Never have I ever, had sex in a public place."
"I'm sorry."
Dean,
"Alright um... I don't know to be honest."
"Wait- you called my Dad?"
The next day, Dean was quiet. He went to go see Sam and Castiel stayed in their apartment and cleaned. He went out and bought some basic groceries before heading back home. It was about four in the afternoon when Dean came back home. He had a slight smile on his face at least. He had dark circles under his eyes and his skin looked pale. Castiel just welcomed him in with a chaste kiss and soft hug which Dean sighed into.
"If Jodys coming, who's watching the girls?" Dean wondered.
I broke it.
"I'm just getting a beer, the only sweet I'm hungry for now is you." Gabe winked. Castiel rolled his eyes which made Dean laugh.
"Yeah. 'Corse Dad. It won't be until at least next month though. Cas has an art show real soon."
"...so where are you taking me?"
"I'm thinking about ordering food. It's late and I don't want to go anywhere. Chinese okay?"
"No. I'm no killer." Dean answered confidently, especially with Cas right next to him.
"Who?"
After Dean and Castiel got home from the beach, they ran back into the house laughing giddily in between kisses. Dean stripped of Castiels trench coat on the floor as Castiel worked on Deans belt laughing against his neck. They stumbled into the living room and Dean ended up on his ass on the floor laughing. Instead of Castiel helping him up off the floor he just needed went down as well, straddling Deans hips. They kissed sloppily with grins plastered on their faces before they had to part.
"Yeah."
Obviously.
"So you said you graduated college this year, what was your major?"
"And I couldn't be happier." Cas said kissing his temple and turning off the lamp.
Dean smiled and joined in.
"Uneventful. Yours?" Castiel smirked while grabbing out two wine glasses.
Dean smiled and put his phone back before turning over in Cas's arms. Cas grumbled and nuzzled into Deans neck.
"What? Why?"
Are you fucking serious?!
"Hm?"
"I think so. Dad is sort of a sensitive topic but uh... yeah. He used to have a major drinking problem. After Mom died he uh, kinda went nuts. Broke dishes and doors... bones. He refused to take meds so me and Sammy got the brunt of it. I think he's mostly sober now, but still not the kind of man I want to be around."
With Dean.
"Huh? Yeah." Dean said not committing to looking away quite yet.
"Right." Cas scoffed. They ate a small breakfast in silence before Gabe asked: "So what's going on with you and your two boyfriends?"
"What?! I did not!"
"I'm just happy, Dean." He sniffled and he pulled Dean close wrapping him in a tight warm hug. It felt much more intimate than their other hugs where Castiel gave his all and Dean patted his back. This time, Dean nuzzled into the crook of his neck and breathed him in. Smelling lilac and rosemary. Like clean linens and spring rain. It was intoxicating, and Dean just allowed himself to be swept away by it.
"How's school?"
Once Castiel thought he was ready, he ripped the condom open with his teeth and quickly rolled it on. He added a bit more lube both to Deans hole and his own aching length. He gently pressed the head of his cock right under Deans balls, running it along to see his reaction. Dean gasped as the head of Castiel pressed against his entrance and Cas leaned down to kiss Dean soundly. Castiel kissed Dean the whole time he pushed in. He went in in one solid glide very slowly, not wanting to miss a second of the way Dean felt. Dean was tight around him like a vice and so hot and smooth that Castiel had to remind himself to breathe. He looked down at Dean and that almost made him lose it right there. Deans green eyes fluttering in a struggle to stay open, his cheeks and chest flushed with arousal. His lips pink and swollen from Cas nipping his lips. He was the definition of beauty. He held still looking at Dean for so long, he didn't even notice Dean shifting down trying to take him deeper.
Hello, Mister Novak. You will have to forgive me French, I believe I'm a bit rusty.
"Really? And you couldn't even shoot me a text to say something about it?"
"May we ask... what news article?" Cas asked.
"Move." He whispered hoarse.
"Neither have I. I simply have a key, not a map. But I know one thing. He is both everywhere and nowhere in here."
"Wait- how much?" Dean gaped, mouth still full of breakfast as they sat on the balcony.
"Cas? What the hell it's one in the morning." Dean groaned.
Before he knew what he was doing he turned around and grabbed Allen's face. He looked at his eyes for a moment and when Allen licked his lips, Dean leaned in and kissed him. It was much different from kissing girls for sure, but it felt... more intense. They kissed on the back of that alley wall for an immeasurable amount of time before Dean heard a familiar engine and yelling.
It's late enough in the day and they're both tired enough that they decide to go out to the beach instead tomorrow and spend the night in, watching bad television in bed. Dean even goes so far as to make popcorn in the kettle for the two of them as they laugh and cuddle watching foreign soap operas.
Later that night Castiel past out hard and Dean stayed up tracing the feathers inked onto Castiels back. He had never felt more full and content and when he finally did fall asleep, it was with a smile on his face.
"Any time. Right. No, I'm fine. You just, ah- continue as you were. I'll talk to you later."
"She is beautiful, isn't she?" Dean whispered.
"Was that good? I wasn't bad was I? Castiel inquired, tilting his head to look at the hunter. Dean couldn't help it. His lips curled into a wide grin as he laughed, turning to look up at Cas and his confused expression.
"I always want to have sex with you." Cas laughed.
"Yes, but I've never had this before. This is a cookie?" He asked in disbelief.
"It means, you can't find him, you have to make him come to you."
You did perfect.
"Sam asked if you were my boyfriend." Dean said randomly. Castiel smirked a little at him with a raised eyebrow.
"Dean, it's okay." She said softly. And damn, he didn't know how bad he needed to hear those words. How much he needed that simple reassurance. He sighed and signed thank you and she nodded.
"You be nice to your wife, kids are tough. I know how heavy little Dean is." Dean said ruffling his nephews hair. Sam leaned in and kissed Eileen in apology before they cleaned up Deans Jr.'s toys. They gave their hugs goodbye as Sam and Eileen left. Dean turned back to Cas after closing the door and wrapped him in a hug. So many words were spoken with the silent gesture. They went off to bed and Dean scooter back into Cas's chest as his husband held him close with a hand over his heart. Just when Dean thought he was about to fall asleep Cas spoke softly to him.
"Right well, stay safe, sane and consensual. Goodnight!" Gabe hollered as he left the flat. Castiel laughed to himself before walking into the kitchen to grab his keys and wallet that he had left there. A knock at the door put a small smile on his face as he went to answer it.
Cas held on tighter and mumbled into Deans collarbone something he couldn't quite make out.
"I'm so sorry." Dean managed out.
"Hello, Castiel."
"Not at all. That was very sweet of you. I had no idea you were so good with kids." He said leaning his head on Deans shoulder.
"I think that'd be sexy."
"I'm sorry."
He made his way into the kitchen where he covered his eyes from the blinding lights and opened the fridge. Well, he finished off all the beer last night. He pulled out a carton of eggs and made himself a simple breakfast of scrambled eggs and toast just so he wouldn't throw up the Tylenol. He sat down at the kitchen table and practically stabbed at his food with each bite. Sam walked by the kitchen and sighed before coming in and sitting down. Before Sam could even open his mouth Dean spoke for him.
"I don't have much of a choice, now do I?" The new Death asked holding up the translucent magic chains.
"You make a valid point," Dean laughed stepping closer to Castiel and his easel. "What are you-" Dean was about to ask what Castiel was painting when he actually caught a glimpse of it.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't know. I just know that we had a nice time and... it's nice to see him."
"Dean, when have you ever known a demon to be trustworthy. They don't always- hell almost never, fully keep up their end of the bargain."
"Dean, it's beautiful." He whispered. "But how could you afford this? It couldn't have been less than two grand."
"Yeah well, I- I don't know. Last I knew we date and we fuck. We're not like you and Gabe."
"I just don't want to hurt him..."
"Like what?" Castiel rolled his eyes walking back onto the balcony to grab his wine.
"Well I should head out," Sam said standing up. "And Dean, just tell him. Tell him what you want out of the relationship." Sam whispered. Dean nodded as Sam headed for the door and walked out. As soon as the door closed Castiel crowded him against the counter. He was almost a little excited before he noticed the difference in his expression.
Sam and Dean drove out to the crossroads. To summon a demon.
"So what did Dean do?"
"Why? You jealous?" Dean smirked. Castiel grabbed a fistful of the hair he was stroking and yanked his head back to meet his eyes.
"What no Dean tonight?" Gabriel asked as soon as Cas opened the door.
"Weirdo." Dean laughed but still shifted closer.
None of it was ideal, Castiel, angel of the lord, hunted, rebelled and fell because he loved Dean Winchester. He wasn't supposed to feel anything, and yet he felt so much he died for him time and time again. And Dean Winchester, a hunter, The Righteous Man, The Michael Sword, The Ultimate Killer... in the end the angel he fell for made sure he knew he was none of it. If he was anything in this world now, a father, a husband and more than anything, loved.
"Woah, what crawled up your ass?" Sam said slightly amused still. Cas leaned in to Deans ear which had him blushing even before he said anything.
By late evening, Donna and Jody were able to come over and get to meet the baby while everyone else would come to meet her later. They all made hot coco since it was now cold out in November while they all got to spend time with the baby. But of course, as soon as someone handed her back to Cas, no one else got to hold her for a while.
"Should have known you two cosmic pains in the ass would have trapped me."
"You've got this." Sam whispered. Dean shot him a thankful smile before he got up and started walking through the library. At first it appeared to be empty, Dean began to fear they might not find a reaper in there. But then he heard the sound of whistling. The tune family, Oh Death. Dean turned into the row of shelves labeled C and found a reaper down at the end of the isle. He was reading a book before he slapped it closed and placed it back on the shelf, not looking at the hunter.
"So... shall we make a deal?" Cyrus said. Dean and Sam both stared at each other and gave a look of understanding and remembrance of their plan.
"Yeah. I much preferred kissing you over the weed however."
"Yeah." Dean whispered back. Castiel stood up and held out his hand for Dean to take.
Castiel never saw Inias again, he did leave him a note however. A note he left on his window sill in the hopes that if Inias ever came back for him, he would stop there and find it. He never found out if Inias got the note, but so much time has past that he doesn't even remember what he wrote. And he is certain that any declaration in there is forgotten by now. But still that note had been left for him.
Once Dean was in his boxers Castiel smiled against his lips and practically threw him into bed. He walked over to his nightstand to quickly grab a condom and some lube before climbing back into the bed.
"Alright."
"Yes. You should get some rest. Goodnight, Dean."
That was until he met Castiel.
"Cas!" He moaned as he came buried deep inside of him. Castiel grabbed his own errection and started moving in time with Deans little grinds milking the last of his orgasm out in Castiels ass. He worked himself quick until he came all over Deans chest with a loud groan. He collapsed onto Dean, burying his face in the younger mans hair as he willed his heartbeat back to normal. His body was numb tingling with many different sensations. He winced when Dean shifted beneath him and brushed his prostate once more. He carefully pulled himself off of Deans cock and they both hissed their disapproval. Dean got up to where Cas assumed was to throw the condom away in the bathroom. When he came back he also grabbed a cloth and cleaned both himself and Castiel off while he still lay their numb in the afterglow. Dean crawled back into the bed and nuzzled against Cas's chest. The two of them laid their in the darkness and comfortable silence for a long time before Dean spoke up.
I went out to go get us breakfast. I'll see you when I get back and we can talk. I love you and I'm so glad your home.
"Yeah. I'm not a fan, but I've made it for Cas once before."
"If you keep doing that- fuck - that then yeah."
"So Diane,"
"Yeah... Sam said we should practice." Dean chuckled a little. Castiel huffed a laugh that vibrated in his chest and ghosted his breath under his ear.
"God I missed you." Castiel gasped out as Dean bit his neck.
Despite the fact he practically threw up a brewery, he found himself at a liquor store and ended up at home again drinking the ache away.
"Fuck, fuck , fuck, Cas!" Dean came untouched all over his leather couch clenching impossibly tight around Castiel ripping his orgasm out as well. Castiels forehead fell in between Deans shoulder blades as he steadied himself and tried to catch his breath. He pulled out after a couple minutes and tossed the condom away before turning back to give Dean a long lingering kiss.
"Okay." Dean sighed.
"If you've heard the word on the street, Death is gone."
It started with texting. Dean and Castiel would text nearly every day planning for their next late night rendezvous together. It had been over two months since Castiel took Dean to his place for the first time and they were having sex on a constant. It went from once a week to a minimum of three times a week. It was always at Cas's place because Dean still didn't want Cas to see his place yet. Plus often times Sam and Gabriel were there as well. They spend many nights and early mornings tangled in the sheets, muscles pleasantly sore and minds pleasantly clouded. Castiel wanted to get Dean to go all the way but he was nervous for that still, and Cas couldn't blame him. So Cas just had to learn to deal with a sore ass every day after Dean left.
"Drink, and take two of these." Dean did as he was instructed and breathed in deeply through his nose, that was raw with all the times he had to blow away his tears last night.
"Yeah?"
"What are you- how are you?" Castiel asked disoriented. Dean didn't answer just held him close. Castiel leaned into his embrace that was more of a side hug. It was a little uncomfortable in the position they were, but neither cared. After a moment, Dean stood and held his hand out. Castiel took Deans hand and stood next to him. Cas stopped and his face furrowed and he felt the nick on his neck.
"Mm. Just trying to convince myself that you're actually mine." Cas leaned his head forward almost out of the shower and pecked a kiss on Deans lips.
"No uh... I have an announcement." Everyone turned eyes on him and he scooted out of his seat a bit nerves getting the better of him. "Growing up... my dad raised me to be a solider. Never love anyone because with this life, hunting, you lose them. The family business always came first. Saving people, hunting things, no matter the cost. I've realized now how stupid that is. We've lost good people... family, all because of the hunt. I always listened to my dad, even when it came to me liking guys... but I realize now more than ever, that I have people I'm not ready to lose yet. Or ever again. Hunting isn't my number one anymore and although I'll always want to help people, I can't do this life anymore. So," Dean sighed. "I'm quitting hunting. I want my apple pie life."
"Goodnight, Dean."
"I'm glad. You mind if I use your shower?" Dean asked.
And then there was a hard punch.
Cas and Sam were sitting in the library when Dean came in from the kitchen. Dean set down a beer for each of them, standing behind Cas and massaging his shoulders. This was something he could do. Cas carried a lot of his stress and tension in his shoulders, and now that he was human, it was worse.
I'll miss you too, my muse. Will you do me another favor?
"So how is Sam?" Castiel asked trying to lighten the mood.
"Really. C'mere," he said opening his arms. She leaned in for a brief hug, smiling when they pulled away. "And I know I'm stoked to be an uncle!"
"That you have been," Gabe teased from the fridge. "Nice hickeys."
"I better get him down for a nap." Cas said to Meg.
"Is Castiel still around here?" She asked Dean
"Of course. Now hurry we've got ten minutes."
Dean tried to be quiet on his way out but to his surprise, Gabriel was standing in his kitchen eating bread.
"Of course. You can be Deans maid of honor." Cas smiled.
"Yeah I bet she does." Dean winked and Sam rolled his eyes with a laugh. The two sat in silence for a moment before Sam sat up off the bench.
"Well he gives pretty good blowjobs." Dean smirked.
"Well I don't know about that but,"
"It... it gets bad."
"Dork." Castiel laughed loosely stroking Dean with a lube slicked hand. Dean hissed at the coldness of it but closed his eyes in pleasure. He felt Cas's wrist bumping the inside of his thigh and looked down for a moment to find Cas fingerings himself open. Dean groaned as he bit his lip. "You know I love fucking you," Cas said panting. "But sometimes I need this too."
"Oh fuck off."
"What?" Castiels eyes were wide in disbelief.
There was a pretty looking gal behind the counter. In any other circumstance, Dean would have been hitting on her. But for some reason, he didn't even really notice.
"Well tonight has me feeling adventurous. But I've never done it before so I'll need you to uh... instruct me a bit."
"It's been too long." Inias said once he pulled away.
He thought about what he said in the heat of the moment. Are you mine? Maybe it was just dirty talk but deep down, Castiel actually feels possessive over this green eyed man. He actually wants Dean to be his. But of course he won't say that.
Cas bent down and picked up the bag of food from Dean's feet.
"He um... he thinks I'm stupid for wanting to bake. Says it's a- well a not so nice name for a gay mans job."
"I knew I couldn't have you in the way I wanted. So, my happiness was just saying it."
"How do you know when you're in love?"
Castiel was having a surprisingly great time at the art show. He met lots of other artists who commended him on his paintings of the cherubs and many people offered their business cards to him. Castiel spent the new year in Arles and was sad he couldn't be with Dean when the new year came.
The two of them went to Le Bouchon again. Benny poured them drinks and Gabe talked on and on about Sam. Castiel laughed at a few of the stories and was genuinely happy that Gabe was in a relationship. Gabe of course pestered him to ask Dean out on an actual date which he brushed off yet again. The two talked for hours enjoying the company of one another. A little after midnight just as Castiel was about to call it a night, someone tapped on his shoulder. He turned around and had to do a double take to believe who he was staring at.
"So, I know you said you're not seeing things anymore. Which is great- and you're happy. So I'm happy. But... has it been affecting your mood? Or is it something else?"
"Ughhn... ah, shit... Dean!" And Dean felt Cas twitch his release inside of him. Dean relished in the feeling of Cas's warm body cloaked over him, both of them panting in pleasure and spent beyond belief. After their breathing regulated, Cas pulled out slowly but quickly, both of them hissing at the movement. Cas collapsed on his back next to Dean, not touching he turned his head to look at Dean after a while.
Dean and Sam broke the devils trap in order to let Cyrus free and find Balthazar's collection. They had been sitting and waiting at the crossroads for over an hour waiting for him to get back.
Cas rolled his eyes. "I think you left out the part that when I first saw you I genuinely thought you were an Apollo sex god. Also we both know I'm always on top." He winked.
"Well I'm gonna be cooking a dinner for me and Sammy and I'm pretty sure Gabe is coming too. If you wanted."
"At least I'll die a happy man."
Just then Jack came stepping out from behind her. He looked... different. Dean knew how becoming god had changed Castiel. And he could only imagine the same was happening to Jack, but he was barely even four despite his adult form.
"What was that for?" He smiled.
"Okay, I'm close bye anyways. Tell him I'll be there in five."
The first few pages were rough sketches of hands and lips, practice doodles. There was the watercolor one of Dean that Castiel made a little while ago that still makes him blush. As he kept flipping past that though, all of them were him. If not of his whole form, then unmistakably his own eyes and lips. Simple watercolor testings of shades of greens and browns. Dean blushed to find more nude sketches of him and one that Dean had to do a double take on. It was roughly sketched with minimal details but enough so that Dean could tell what it was.
Sam and Gabe were talking about moving to Ireland while Dean and Cas stayed in Compiègne. However, Cas had talked Dean into buying a house together in Paris. They had put both their names on the lease and everything and Dean couldn't be happier. They still had to move in to their new house, but they were in London for another one of Cas's art shows.
"Can it," Dean groused as tossed the grease rag over his shoulder.
"That flannels dirty. Wear something nice." Dean rolled his eyes but nodded and kissed Cas on the cheek before going to change. Dean threw on clothes that fit his definition of 'nice'. He wore a dark red, silk dress shirt that was a little tight in the arms since he hadn't worn dress clothes in a while. He put on some dark wash jeans without holes in them and last minute put on some of Cas's cologne. He liked to smell like him.

"I love you to, Angel."
"Dean?"
"I'm gonna have to make you eat more. You're too thin." He mumbled.
"I'm adorable." Dean mumbled around his mouthful.
"So we need a longer list of even rarer ones. Most of these are in Greek and I've been able to get a lot of them easily, but the one I found in here," Sam said tapping on the book. "Said we needed αύρα."
"Sleep tight, Cas." Dean said and Castiel heard his feet leaving the bedroom and shutting the glass doors.
Dean found himself swimming up out of a hot, hazy dream about Cas into bleary half consciousness with arousal tingling through his limp body and coiling in his groin. His lips felt softer for some reason. They felt wrapped in something hot and moist, soft and wet and pulsing. It took Dean a moment to realize it was Cas's mouth, caressing and kissing him slowly but steadily. His fingers were entwined with his, and that let him know he's safe, even before he was awake enough to remember where he's supposed to be.
"So I've noticed. You got any weed?"
"What did I tell you about calling me that?"
"I'm gonna go down to the dungeon. Clean up the blood." He said as he walked out of the kitchen.
"Of course I'm real, baby. Why?... are you hearing things again?" Dean couldn't respond, his mouth was too dry, so he just nodded. Castiel smiled a thin apologetic line and pulled Dean into him, not caring about the still there mess. Dean shivered and sighed before relaxing into his arms.
When Dean woke up the next morning, his first thought was... warm. He smiled even before he opened his eyes at the firm, warm body pressed up against his own. He could feel Castiels hair tickling the nape of his neck, along with his hot breath ghosting behind his ear. Dean shivered a little at the feeling, causing goosebumps to cover his arms and chest. Cas was spooned right up against his back, no space between them, despite the fact that they had fallen asleep not even touching. When Dean shifted away a little bit, Cas pulled him in closer and tighter mumbling his disagreement of getting up into Deans neck. Dean chuckled slightly before relaxing into his embrace. His phone buzzed on the nightstand and he reached over to thumb open the text.
"We can get through it together," he pleaded. "I'm here to help you. When you first told me about your bipolar and your trauma, I told you I wanted to help. Have I not been helping you? Am I not doing enough?"
"I've got to go, but thank you. Send me the pictures. All of them."
"Do you keep your one night stands underwear in your underwear drawer?" Gabriel raised his eyebrows.
"C'mon I'm a picture of health. I'm fine. I haven't had an episode in a long time. I'm still in touch with Dr. Singer if I do need them again."
When he was in high school he started to see the shadows. Nameless people and ghost less faces that he could never see, but they were there. They would talk to him sometimes and it scared the hell out of him, but he never told anyone. No doubt he would be institutionalized for seeing and hearing things that didn't exist. But it was because it didn't exist that he began to feel too real.
"It's alright. He married a woman and she's really good to him. He still gambles I think but at least he's sober now. I don't think Kate would keep Adam around him if he wasn't."
"Hands on the back of the couch, on your knees." Dean adjusted himself and without warning Castiel started prepping him, more roughly than he ever had before. He didn't give Dean time to adjust after he shoved to slick fingers deep inside him, he just started scissoring and pumping quickly from impatience. Dean was whimpering with every brush of his fingers that hit Deans prostate and once Cas decided he was stretched enough, he leaned down to pick up the condom. As he was tearing it open Dean startled.
After that it didn't take long for the two of them to get heated more. Castiel ended up on his back, Dean hovering over him. Castiel smiled to himself as Dean fumbled in the nightstand for condoms and lube. Dean already knew where they were so it didn't take long. Dean lubed up his own fingers before hesitating a little breathless.
Dean touched his own neck blushing bright crimson when he realized that Cas had sucked a hickey there.
"I'm fine." Dean assured.
"I love you too. And we are gonna kick so much ass." Cas scoffed a laugh and Dean grinned widely before they separated. "Not to mention it will be just the two of us... all alone."
This was usually the part in the relationship that didn't go to hot. People thought Dean would be crazy or dangerous or simply not worth him. Dean hadn't been manic in years but he still had his moments. He had a good thing going with Cas, and he didn't want to scare him off.
In his time alone, he does think he's getting better. The new meds seem to be doing fine. There hasn't been any humming or chimes. There hasn't been any whispers or faceless shadows. He's been sad, but he doesn't think that has anything to do with the medication. He got up and went to the bathroom. He brushed his teeth- took his meds- combed his hair a little bit. He needed a shower, no doubt, but he didn't want to be in there by the time Cas got back. So instead he went out to the living room.
However tonight's date is supposed to be a walking date. They had made plans to walk the streets of Compiègne together. But of course Gabriel had to come over and nag him.
"Yes. I believe so." Cas said. Dean leaned over and pecked a kiss on Castiels temple, a gesture that was so familiar for them both. The man saw and shook his head.
"What exactly do you think you are to me? These nightmares that keep you up at night are killing you! And you lied to me! You are lying to me now! Trying to convince me you're okay, when I know those voices in your head are saying I'm not real," he leaned forward and grabbed his face. "I'm real! We are real! And you can't do this to yourself, because it's hurting me too."
"Anyways, you guys want some pie?"
"How's things with Sam?" Castiel asked.
"Hot. Feels... warm," he grunted. "And tight, wet. Just good." Dean groaned at the slight dirty talk and moved in time trying to get him to go faster. Cas lost some form of semblance and started to go hard and fast while somehow still being gentle. Dean was moaning and cursing as Cas just kissed him through his thrusts. Dean's hands gripped at the bedsheets, now completely soaked with sweat, and held Castiel close to him as he fucked him. Dean reached his hand in between their stomachs and wrapped a firm fist around his member, hissing in the double stimulation. Cas's thrusts became erratic, hitting that spot inside Dean on every other turn. Dean moved his hand in time with Cas, pulling and twisting trying to get to that sweet edge.
"Cas," he pleaded in a whisper not even sure what he was asking for.
"Son of a bitch!" He yelped as it stabbed into the center of his food.
"Go to the bedroom, strip down and lay on your stomach."
"Well hello to you too, Cassie." His brother scoffed while pushing himself into the flat.
"Yeah."
Castiel once told Dean that he could see all of his tattoos, but they never really talked much about it other than that. To be honest they were a little too busy in the dark of his bedroom or under the covers to really say much more on the subject. He's sure Dean has seen glimpses of them, but right now his eyes seem to be inspecting them closely.
"Shut up."
It was the first week of December now and Castiel was constantly happy. He found himself falling asleep thinking about Dean and waking up the same way.
"Winslow, Arizona. Now, the place is an abandoned warehouse. And it's extremely warded, I couldn't get in. But, there's no warding against humans. So, I suggest you get driving to find that aura, while I," he pointed to himself. "Am going back to hell. Make sure I get that promotion."
"Lee was the first um... man. We only dated about a month, but uh. Yeah it's a long story."
"Jesus, Dean. This is what you celebrate winning with? Practically drinking yourself to death? Crying and screaming in your sleep?" Sam said. He rubbed his temples as he leaned forward and grabbed the edge of his bed trying to stand himself upright. Dean didn't have a response so he simply didn't answer. Sam helped him get his footing as he sat on the foot of the bed. He closed his eyes again and only opened them when Sam held a glass of water to them.
"God no." Dean gasped standing. "Why don't you do a little spin for me?"
Cas and Dean packed up for the hunt within an hour while Sam printed off all the reports for them. They waved their goodbyes to Eileen and Sam as they hopped into the Impala and headed to Idaho for their hunt.
"Yeah." Dean said a little stiffly.
"Okay... is it like a sexy surprise?" Dean smirked coming out of the kitchen with some freshly made garlic bread.
Castiel had been pretty worked up already from watching Dean so it didn't take long to reduce him to a moaning mess. Dean was unsure in his movements but he tried to imitate what Cas does for him sometimes moving his tongue around and mostly toying with the head of Castiels cock. In a matter of minutes, Castiel pulled Dean off before he right came with Deans name a gasp on his lips like a prayer.
But if that said anything, yeah. He wasn't ready to talk about his feelings for Cas yet.
It does not matter.
"No." Dean said halfheartedly, not even really listening. But if whatever he said meant he had to stop, that was a no.
Deans smile soon faded as he unlocked the door though. His brother Sam was sitting and crying on the couch cradling a box of tissues.
She sighed. "At least tell me what I can do to help."
"Are we gonna smoke first?"
"What? I can't kiss the man I love?" Cas eyed him skeptically but kissed his cheek all the same before grabbing his hand. "C'mon, Sam made dinner."
"I don't care."
Dean yawned as he pulled the comforter over them and tucking Castiel under his chin.
Everyone was stunned silent. The air was both thick yet somehow thin. Everything in this place was in its contradictory. And Jack felt safe here, which was far from okay.
"You should get cleaned up. We have dinner arrangements." Cas smiled.
"Yeah?"
"Pray? Pray to Jack? You don't think I've tried that?"
Dean blushed at the compliment and walked inside while Castiel helped him out of his coat.
"But," he sniffled. "I don't know if I'll be able to afford to come back anytime soon."
"Nope. Great we'll have a movie night."
Castiel felt a little guilty knowing why he needed to get tested was because he cheated. Even though technically he didn't since they weren't together, it still feels that way to him. And although he and Inias did use protection and neither of them finished, still better safe than sorry.
"Are you sure we should do this?" He panted.
"No I don't mind you. I just don't want to date him." Castiels eyelids felt heavy and he found himself swaying a bit.
"Richard Roman."
"I was thinking, we eat breakfast and then maybe we could go out on the beach. It's still really cold so we'll have to dress warm but-"
"Sex can feel fine even when it doesn't feel right."
"Yes. All yours."
"The hell does that mean?" Dean asked irritated.
"Do you remember when Cas opened up purgatory, and then he became god?"
"I'm sorry." Cas sighed leaning back in the couch.
Castiel was on a phone call with Gabe when Dean got into his apartment. He smiled at Dean from the balcony before rolling his eyes at Gabes arguing.
But now Castiel is heading to the airport and Dean isn't going to be able to see him for the next five days. Castiel asked Dean to water his plants while he was gone and as soon as Cas made it to Arles he texted Dean.
Dean woke up the next morning around ten and instantly threw up all the alcohol he consumed last night before- and after- he was at Cas's. Thinking about what he saw only made him puke harder until his stomach muscles clenched and ached from convulsing.
"Why?" She signed. He knew she wasn't going to give up so he just said:
"No problem." He said as he dug into his own short stack. They two ate their breakfasts in companionable silence savoring each sip of strong black coffee.
"Tired?"
He went about trying to have an overall normal morning. He made breakfast and coffee. He smiled when Eileen walked in sleepily and said that Sam was still sleeping. And then Dean decided he needed to go. He's not exactly sure what brought on his sudden need to leave, but it wasn't an urgent sad like it was the last time. He already had a destination in mind.
"But that's so sweet," Cas teased.
"Love you too." He said once they separated. "Are they- are they here now?"
Castiel still goes on the date with Inias on Tuesday. The two of them go out for a simple dinner and reminisce about the old days.
"I dunno. Probably beginning of December. Why?"
"Thanks." Cas scoffed.
"Meds?"
"Did you use my shampoo?" he murmured against Dean's lips.
He could finally hug him. And not for one last time. He could tell him how much he loves him, even though that thought scares the hell out of him. He could hold on to him and never let go. Maybe he could even get an apple pie life. Just instead of a wife and kids, he'd have Cas and Miracle. He smiled reading the book at the idea of having Cas as a partner... like a husband. With a white picket fence, a garden, a dog. They'd go on cheesy movie dates and long car rides into the Impala just to steam up the windows when they'd park. He'd take Cas out to nice restaurants and hold his hand. Prove that he's not afraid of loving him. But that is... if he could learn to not be afraid by the time they figured this out. Because truth be told, he loved Castiel more than anything, ever. And that scared him. He brushed away those thoughts forcing his mind to focus on the spell texts. He needed to figure this out. For Cas.
"I'm an excellent multitasker."
"Okay, where can we get one?" Sam asked.
"I too have a bit of an announcement," Sam muttered. "Well, more of a question." His younger brother turned to Eileen who was facing him on the bench of one of the tables, face furrowed in confusion. He got down on one knee and everyone gasped.
"Well the other day you said I was like your best friend. So are we friends with benefits? Are we fuck buddies? Are we dating? Are we... I dunno, boyfriends?" Dean mumbled shyly.
"Dude! I'm happy for you. Although next time, keep it down a bit. Cause as much as you don't want to talk about it... I really don't want to hear it."
"Why? I'm too hot to handle." Cas joked.
"Mmhmm. And guess what's in it?" Dean smiled against Cas's lips.
Instead of sending them right away, he opted for another idea. He face timed Cas in his bathroom walking away from the phone. Cas picked up on the second ring.
"Wow thank you. This looks delicious, Dean." Castiel said finally setting his sketch pad down.
"Well if you hurry up and eat, maybe I could take you back home and make that sketch come to life." Dean looked up eyes wide but his pupils were suddenly dilated.
"He got his surgery? Why didn't you say anything?" Castiel asked.
Dean looked down. "I missed you, too."
"So move in with me." Gabe shrugged.
"What are you doing up?" Gabe asked.
After a moment of a little bit of an awkward silence, Eileen spoke up and tried to lighten the mood a bit. She was always good at pleasant distractions. Dean huffed a little laugh shaking his head before everything caught up with him. No chick flick moments, remember? Dean Winchester doesn't talk about feelings. And based on the past weeks he's had, he now knew he was on the verge of crying.
Dean nodded before standing and shuffling to the bedroom. When Castiel opened the doors he sighed to himself to find Dean flat on his stomach, arms under his head and bare as the day he was born.
Pretty soon both of them were gasping and panting for air, just a breath away from each others lips.
"Then sleep, my righteous man. I'll be here when you wake."
"That's alright, Dean. I will take care of you."
"Generally, yeah. It helps me relax. You want some? It will take off some of the stress." Cas smiled.
"Not that I can think of. Why?"
Dean chuckled and turned to see the canvas as well. It was still evidently striped rainbow, but the colors bled together like fireworks from where they had both clawed at the sheets. There were a few smudges and even what Dean swore was an ass imprint. He smiled and kissed Cas's cheek.
Fuck he was an idiot.
"You are such an idiot." Dean chuckled. Still they hugged each other in an unspoken bond. That they loved each other no matter what.
"Hmm. Well tell you what, next time we'll give it a try. Two fingers, that's it."
"Hell if I know. And I've been there, so, no."
"You can stay here. Wait for us and stay safe." Sam answered. She nodded hesitantly before Eileen walked over to her.
Dean,
He told Sam about it and the insolent little shit made fun of him for about an hour about how Dean "actually the had balls?" But in the end Sam had suggested Dean take him out in the Impala to a nice restaurant and then go walk through the city. Dean just now had to work up the courage to ask Cas out again. But luckily Cas was coming over today.
"Look I get he's an ass, but he is still our dad."
"Nothing. It's nothing, just go make sure my idiot brother hasn't choked on his own vomit."
"Hey, no. No it didn't make me uncomfortable. It's not anything to do with you either. I've just... it's never been like that before. So, raw and... open. I felt vulnerable and you know me. I don't do that. But with you... I want to be."
When Dean woke up hours later it was dark out and he almost felt guilty that he had slept most of the day. He quietly padded out of Cas's room to find him perched on the balcony, painting away with a glass of wine in his hand.
"Alright. Don't take to long." Dean smiled kissing the corner of Castiels mouth.
Dean looked around as if he'd be able to spot something. Anything. But he couldn't. He took a step forward and the ground made a noise as if he had stepped in water, but it wasn't wet. Death walked forward nonchalantly, idly flipping his pocket watch. He leaned down and pressed his hand to the ground. There was a slight rumble that Dean felt in his feet. There was a slight noise like nails on a chalkboard but it was distant. Suddenly Dean saw Deaths scythe sliding across the floor to him. Death picked it up and tested the weight in his hands before turning to Dean.
Cas simply chuckled and pulled Dean in for another kiss, more languid. Dean smiled into his mouth when he thought about it. Cas was probably one of the best kissers Deans ever had. His tongue so rough and dominant, yet so soft and tender like a woman's. He could easily kiss him all day, loving the rough scrape of stubble along his chin and upper lip.
"No he is our father. Biological father nothing more. Dads don't beat their sons so bad that they end up hospitalized. Now you may be able to forget about that Sammy, but I can't."
"I love you, but you're letting all the steam out. Plus the floors getting wet." Dean smiled and rolled his eyes before shutting the door.
He pressed a finger to Cas' lips, preventing him from saying anything else. "Yes. It was very good.  So amazing that we would be doing it again if I could feel any part of my body."
March
"But it's just that. Sex. That's all this is nothing more. I don't want a relationship, neither does he." Dean finished standing up and grabbing his coat.
"I love you, Dean." The angel gasped. Before Dean could even respond, he watched the fireworks of orgasm begin to flush the sculpted face of the angel above him, he lost all semblence of control. Cas moaned his name like a filthy prayer, hiding his face in the crook of Deans neck. Castiels hand and hips stuttered out of control and he felt a warmth splash across his stomach as the angel above him trembled and shook with the bliss of it all. Dean fell soon after that, the feeling of his body erupting felt like white hot tendrils of joy in every fiber of his being. He heard himself yell out Cas's name as the sound echoed off the motel room.
C. Novak was his art signature.
Dean ground his hips down a little bit and rolled his head back as his body swam with pleasure.
She was beautiful. So small and fragile, like the feather of an angel, so precious he never wanted to let her go. She had barely there, curly light brown hair and blue eyes that could give Cas a run for his money. She wore a simple white dress that was too big for her tiny frame, and the cutest little sandals. Dean never thought feet could look so cute, but on her they just were. Dean wanted to cry when Cas took her out of his arms but then he wanted to cry for a whole different reason. The smile on Cas's face was brighter than the sun and as he looked down at her. When Cas looked up at him his eyes were watery with tears and he knew he had to kiss them away. Even when she cried Dean and Cas just smiled at her because she was too precious to do anything else.
After Dean hung up and handed the phone back Sam tried to stop his tears, most likely not wanting Gabe to see him that way. True to his word; Gabriel was at their flat in just under five minutes. He came in and immediately saw Sam's state and rushed to his side, kissing his hair. Normally Dean would've been a smart ass and make a comment or fake gag, but Sam didn't need that right now. Sam broke down crying again into Gabes shoulder and Gabe looked pained to see him like that.
"It's... amazing. I mean, I have quite an extensive vocabulary, and yet I can't even find a word that truly describes how happy he makes me."
"I'm sorry bro. So, Dean mela drama, mega trauma aside... how's your guys relationship going?"
"Something you and Dean have in common."
"I distinctly remember you denying that." Dean said spitting out his toothpaste.
"What's his issue?"
"Oui, ça te donnera quelque chose à quoi s'accrocher." Cas smirked.
"No of course not! After the past three months I figured-" Dean sighed unsure of what to say.
It was a tan suede trench coat with dark wooden buttons and multiple pockets lined with silk. Castiel could tell by the cinch at the waist that it was most likely a women's garment and smiled to himself at the fact that Dean knows how much he likes women's clothes. It was heavy and thick in his hands and an absolutely beautiful piece of clothing. He looked at the brands tag which read Abeilles with a small stitching of a honeycomb embroidered on it. Castiels jaw gaped at the brand name and he knew instantly that this was an expensive coat.
"Bout fucking time!"
"Correct. Dean here, murdered my entire family. I swore I wasn't like them. I wasn't, still am not... I begged for my life... and then your brother, shot me right between the eyes."
"No, but Balthazar's dead. And we have no clue where he put those things. Only Cas did."
"I want you to know that I really am sorry. About Inias. It kills me every time I think about it. Not just that but how I treated you before."
"You came up with that answer awfully fast." Cas observed.
Deans eyes welled with tears. It sounded as if he was right there saying it to him all over again.
With that he hoped into his car and started up the engine. Just as he was shifting gears his phone buzzed again.
"Yeah..."
more smut
Dean blushed. He didn't think he would ever get used to hearing him say that.
"Nice to meet you too, sir."
"What you mean this?" Castiel asked crooking his fingers once more and that blinding pleasure took him once more as he came harder than he ever had in his life. His eyes clenched shut as he panted and collapsed back on the bed.
Dean had a chubby mouthful of waffles and Castiel smiled to himself before clearing his throat. Dean swallowed his bite only to choke on air as soon as he looked up and saw him. Deans eyes were wide and wavering up and down his whole body as he stood by the stairwell. He didn't say anything for so long, Castiel started to blush under his gaze and asked finally:
"Well?" Dean had asked him.
"You literally ate out my ass, I'm not kissing your mouth until you've brushed your teeth."
"Oh c'mon, kiss me."
"Yes. Shhh, keep it down. I don't know when I will actually ask Dean... but I would like to have his fathers blessing before he goes."
"Yeah. I mean, I haven't seen all of them yet, but Eileen definitely seems fine." Sam shrugged.
"Of course!" He laughed through his tears. Cas struggled to stand and before he could even get the silver band across Deans finger, Deans lips were on his soft and loving. There were cheers and whistles from the audience so much applause. Once they finally separated they smiled softly, holding each others faces.
"Kelly, you stay here with Eileen. We're going to take care of this." Cas said.
"They talk to me. It's my own voice but it's more than one, and they don't leave me alone."
"What was that for?" He whispered.
"Do you want me to stop?"
"It's nothing." Dean muttered handing him a plate to dry.
"Yeah. There was this angel, Balthazar. Apparently he had this big collection of stolen goods from heaven. Do you think you could find it?" Sam chimed in.
"Well, your being can suck it." Dean said looking back at the man in chains."Death?"
Another thought popped into his head as he headed towards their bedroom and went into the bathroom. He looked in the cabinet for a moment looking for Deans pills. Soon enough he found the orange pill bottle with his name and everything written on it.
"I uh... I kind of stopped caring where comfort came from. I don't really like labels but if I had to call myself something I would probably say I'm bisexual."
"Bitch." Dean laughed under his breath.
"You've got a great voice." Dean complimented sitting down next to Cas on the balcony.
"If you're gonna bitch the whole time, maybe I'll just crash her for the hell of it." Cas grinned. Both Sam and Eileen were stunned speechless in the back.
"A magic collection?"
"Yeah that's, yeah." Dean gasped.
"Why don't we do never have I ever? That's a fun one right?" Gabe asked.
"Well, I think we should head to the motel. It's getting late." Sam yawned. "Plus we got to be up early tomorrow to see your baby girl."
"Words, Dean." Dean rolled his eyes and Cas only looked more sternly at him. Dean fumbled and reached into his nightstand pulling out a small bottle of lube they'd used a few times. He handed it to Cas, but the angel still looked at him waiting for a response. Damn him and the whole angel consent thing. Dean sucked in a sharp breath and glared harder.
"I don't know. I do know that I want to take you out again."
"What?"
"Are you serious?!"
Until the figures and there twisted thoughts came back.
"Someday." Dean leaned his head back on Castiels head pillowed on his shoulder and suddenly Cas felt the overwhelming urge to say what he had wanted to since he woke up early this morning. To repeat those words that Dean said to him. And he would mean it. With all his heart.
"Morning. 'Time is it?" He mumbled.
"What?" He grumbled.
"I know, I know. I'm just saying we've been here forever. Maybe he just-" they heard a fluttering behind them and both spun in heel to face Cyrus.
"There are fragrant acres where evening comes long hours late," it took Dean a moment to realize, Cas was reciting poetry. "And the still unmoving air, cools the fevered hands of fate. Meadows where the afternoon hangs suspended in a flower and the moments of our doom drift upon a weightless hour. And we who thought that surely night would bring us triumph or defeat, only find the stars are white clover at our naked feet."
They took a tour and walked around to see the locals and shops that England had to offer. It was slightly colder in Birmingham so Castiel decided to wear the trench coat Dean bought him. To be honest he would wear it even if it wasn't cold, just because he loved the way it made him feel. They held hands as they walked through the streets and laughed with each other. They walked into an old bookstore called livres français. They decided to go in seeing as how they just came from France anyways. The woman at the front desk didn't speak English, but she did ask them if they were looking for anything in specific.
He had spent all the past five days wasting away his cooking money on Booz and drinking away his pain. He was halfway through a bottle of Jack when there was a rapid fit of knocking at his door. He reluctantly climbed off of the couch to open the door.
"That's great. It's always important to go after your dreams."
"Can you read it to me?"
Then he woke up again.
"Your libido, Dean. Your sex drive." He sighed. "Please don't think I'm complaining, because I'm not. You know I love what we do and your mental health comes first. But it's been weeks..."
ahhhh last chapter. FYI this has always been the happy ending I envisioned for Dean, so I hope you like it. It’s just very fluffy <3
Dean made them Coq Au Vin for dinner and they ate on the balcony watching the sunset while holding hands under the table. They drank wine and talked about simple things and how Castiel is getting in line to sell another one of his pieces.
"Okay..." Sam sighed. "Look man I'm just saying it's been a year and maybe getting out in the dating game is what you need-"
"I get it, I get it. Just- come and have drinks with me. Please? I need a wingman. Plus you know all the little French boys love you."
"Goodnight, Dean."
"Open the front page, sweetheart." Dean smiled. He knew that Cas had put her on the dedication page and she looked confused to see it.
"We're leaving, I'll call you tomorrow," Castiel said to Gabriel. "Au revoir, Benny." He said as he continued to pull them out to the street.
Would you let me paint you in them?
Dean didn't want this to be over just yet, but the warm hands and lips and tongue was all too much. What Dean loved most about this moment though, wasn't the aching tension or need of release, or even the sheer pleasure that had him moaning like never before. What he loved most was they way they began to lose themselves in each other. Over and over and still never know they way that he always felt like a place Dean had never seen. He grunted as he bathed in the sensation of Cas' tongue against his earlobe and the rush of blood that filled his entire body as Cas' thick head brushed against his stomach. As Cas pulled slightly away, he saw that he wasn't the only one on the brim.
"Is it good?" Dean asked eyeing the plate.
"Morning, sunshine. Want some coffee?" Dean smiled from the kitchen.
Without another word a grin spread across Deans face and he pulled Cas practically sprinting back to the Impala. Castiel had to tell Dean to slow down as a friendly reminder Cas was in heels. But to Castiels surprise Dean simply picked him up carrying him bridal style as he continued to run back to the car, both of them laughing.
"Hey it's Dean. Where's Sam?"
"Don't worry," Dean held up the vile. "Just so we can get out of here."
"Sorry, sorry. But I'm so happy for you and Sam. You guys'll be great parents." She nodded and there was a moment of silence before she spoke up again.
But then Cas would smile brightly at him and everything would fade away to the beautiful man he was proud to call his.
Castiel flushed. It wasn't a cute blush but an actual nervous one. He didn't know what to say so he didn't say anything. However he didn't need too. Inias halted their steps and grabbed Castiels chin. Castiel barely had enough time to register what was happening before Inias's lips were on his. It was a chaste kiss and Cas couldn't find it in himself to kiss back. He didn't back away though, afraid of hurting Inias all over again.
Castiel's brows wrinkled. "Are you injured?"
"No, you don't get to decided that for me!" Castiel cried out. "I love you! I love you more than anything! You can't leave me. You said you loved me too."
Yes, Angel.
"Alright. Well um. We met in the summer and kind of just... experimented. We went on dates and things were great until," he sighed, hesitant on even finishing the story. "He told me he was married."
"Hell yeah. We're definitely doing that again."
"So are you still going to be fucking him?" Dean asked unsure if he wanted to know the answer.
"If you guys wanted, when it warms up you could use my summer home in Marseille."
"It wasn't fair for me to be using him that way anyways."
"I'll go to him." Dean hung up before he could say another word. He grabbed his shit which was just his book bag, a pair of sweatpants, his meds and the keys to the Impala. He headed to the front desk to return his key before going to baby. It was dark out and the clock on the Impala said it was midnight but Baby was still an hour off, so it was only eleven at night. He started her up and realized he needed to stop for gas on the way back home. Okay maybe he was stalling a little bit, but a fresh tank of gas couldn't hurt. He took the longer route home, mainly planning out what he was going to say. By the time he was in the parking lot, his heart felt like it was beating out of his rib cage. He turned off the engine and headed up the steps to their room. He turned the key slowly to open there flat. The lamp was on in the living room just enough to see as he shrugged out of his coat. He bit back bile when he say the empty wine bottles on the counter and forced down tears when he saw their pictures stacked on the coffee table. Like he was looking at them and drinking his pain away how Dean has done so often. Cas was no where in sight and Dean assumed he must be asleep in bed. The curtains over the glass doors to the bedroom weren't drawn so he carefully opened one to find Cas in bed.
It was getting to the point where sometimes they wouldn't even text or call, Dean would just show up at Castiels door for a long night of much needed fun. They even started calling each other and actually having conversations about their days. It was all a little more domestic than it should be for a safe zone. They weren't dating or in a relationship. They were simply sleeping together, but a part of Cas fought with him. Just because their not dating doesn't mean that he can't care about Dean as a person or even a friend. He just needed to keep focusing on convincing himself that Dean was just that. A friend.
"I'd get up, but I don't think I could walk right now if I tried." Cas sighed.
"What's going on?" Cas asked. "Who's here?" Sam looked sorrowful and his lips pressed into a thin line. Dean heard a shuffling and turned behind himself to see someone he never expected. Cas followed in suite and all of their gazes were fixed on the woman walking out of the shadows.
"They're not poor trust me. They are what you would call, bâtards chanceux." Dean chuckled.
"And I you."
Dean liked this part; getting to know Castiel. There was so much he still wanted to know about him so he figured he could start with a typical question.
"Where did you?!" He cut himself off.
He pulled Dean into his bedroom not bothering to shut the glass folding doors. They were kissing again just as strongly and sweet as before only it was more heated now. Castiel kept rolling his hips against Dean causing him to groan every couple of thrusts. After a few minutes of deep kisses and minuscule movements of hips, both of them were moaning and the gravely hollow sounds that came from Castiels throat only served to turn him on even more.
"Cyrus... I'm sorry. I wasn't- I wasn't me back then. And I have felt horrible about that ever since."
Dean looked at his fortune and grinned. "The love of your life is right in front of your eyes."
"My name is Castiel and this is Gabriel."
It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. Cas is real. He's all that matters right now.
That works for me. Dean typed back with a smile.
"Angels." The green eyed boy spoke up just a mumble.
"Yeah well you on the other hand," Dean scrubbed a hand down his face. "Lookin' good. But respectfully I don't feel like talking right now.
"Oh get your panties untwisted, I'm only teasing." Dean blushed when Cas shot him a look. "So, I'm not pushing. This is already more than I could ask for, but... you think maybe you could come and see me? Before I go?"
"Shh. I've got you Angel. Cum for me." He whispered and made direct eye contact as Cas came screaming. His brows furrowed, jaw went slack, lips wet and swollen pink. Those lust filled blue eyes staring at him as he spilled between them all over their intertwined hands. Dean let go of Cas's softening dick and quickly stroked himself at the sight of Cas beneath him catching his breath. Before he could finish though, Castiel found enough strength apparently to flip him back over.
"Well from what I've heard, things aren't great back home. And although I'm more than well off enough to fly out to the states, I like having you around. So move in with me."
The neighbors upstairs were done and he was exhausted now, enough so that if he crawled back into bed with Castiel he would probably fall asleep. But a sudden pang of shame hit him. How fucked up is that? He just looked through Cas's personal sketches and got off to one. Also in Cas's robe, on his couch. He knew he wouldn't be able to look at Cas right now so he simply stripped the robe on the couch and quickly went back to the bedroom.
Dean was in the middle of pulling out a pecan pie out of the oven when there was a knock at the door.
"You should start taking them again. I know it's not my place but I think it could be good for you."
Cas looked at Deans neck and laughed lightly, his face lighting up as he did so. "I'm sorry I got you into trouble." He sputtered.
"No I mean why did you stop?" Cas asked, pants still around his ankles and dick painfully hard.
"Thank you, John. Truly." Cas said and felt like he was able to breathe again.
"Does this mean..." Dean blushed.
The second they got in the door, Cas shut the door and locked it harshly before fixing Dean with a look. It was the kind of look that made his eyes go from beautiful sky bright blue, to oceans deep midnight. A look of love, adoration and lust. He smiled a little before going over and pulling Deans shirt over his head.
