Bucky pulled him over to the sofa on the other side of the room, “Okay punk, spill. There’s never been anything we couldn’t tell each other and we both got all the time in the world. Spill.”
“Steve? I need you to breathe for me, okay Cap? You hear me? I need you to breathe. I’m gonna breathe with you. Ready? In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. In. Out.”
His heart breaking as he did so, Steve kissed the top of her head and handed her to Pepper. Peggy started crying and Pepper was immediately comforting and shushing the girl. Bucky was in a similar situation with Peter.
I know that Peggy is supposed to be around 3. I'm aware that I might be making her seem younger than she is. I think I have something in mind for this though,so just bear with me please? Thank you!
Peggy wanted to scream, to tell her to go away. To tell her that she was lying. To tell her that her name was Peggy, not Layla. But she couldn’t speak. She tried to move. And found that she couldn’t do that either. She wanted to shove her out of the room. To kick, or hit, or punch. Anything to make her stop, to make her go away. But she couldn’t move. She could feel the tears flowing down her face as mommy continued to talk.
Tony gave both of the kids green beans, knowing that Peggy preferred the carrots. And then, Tony proceeded to eat his salad and turn down ice cream. During the movie (The Incredibles, because why not), his eyes just kind of glazed over. Peter was trying to get his attention to ask about the science side of the movie and all his husband responded with were ‘yeah’ and ‘sure, squirt.’
Tony smiled the first time he saw all of them together. He had come up to the penthouse to get something and seen the kids with Bucky and Steve in the living room. Watching all of them put a melancholy smile on his face. They were just fine without him.
Steve handed Peter back to Bucky, and Bucky and Natasha left immediately. With a synchronicity they hadn’t had in weeks, Tony and Steve moved towards Peggy. She was still whimpering, occasionally calling out for mommy to make it stop.
So Toni started on fertility drugs, hoping that maybe they would work. Clomiphene increased the number of eggs released each month, which also meant there was a higher chance of multiples. That scared both of them out of their minds at first, but they both just wanted a baby so bad they were willing to try anything.
It was just a bad day all around. Waking up was hard. Getting out of bed was harder. Getting ready to start the day and face everyone was the hardest part yet. Steve knew the team would know something was up, usually he was the first one up, usually he went for a run before everyone else was even up. Not today though. Today was one of those days when everything felt like it was too much. But Steve also knew that just staying in bed all day would make it worse. It would mean that all of his thoughts and feelings were right there, including his memories. No, getting up was the better option.
Tasha was filing her nails, “I think you should at least try it. If it seems to be causing more harm than hurt, then bring her back home. Just an idea.”
Tony sat up, propping his head on his fist, “There’s no promise I’d rather make. You might have to pry things out of me every once in a while though. We both know I don’t like talking.”
When Tony looked up, Steve’s heart broke just a little bit more. His eyes were bloodshot and bleary, Steve hadn’t seen them this bad since before they got married. Tony practically collapsed into his embrace. Steve just adjusted Peggy so he could hug both of them.
Peter’s dubious expression made both of them laugh again as they made their way to the common room. According to the boy, everyone had gathered there to chew the two out when they got home. Toni didn’t think that’s what they’d be doing after she and Steve dropped their news.
“Like I promised earlier Petey, you’ll see us in five hours. That’s not such a long time is it? You sleep for longer than that without seeing papa and me. Can you be my big brave boy and just take school for a spin, huh? We can get ice cream when we pick you up?”
Natasha knocked on the door, and a hungover looking man answered. She looked back the car for confirmation that this was the father. When Tony nodded back at her, she knocked him out. Two other SHIELD agents advanced into the house, quickly bringing out the bitch that had the nerve to call herself Peggy’s mother. They were both handcuffed and thrown into the SHIELD vehicle.
Both parents kissed the top of his head, but Steve was the first to talk, “Nope, Peggy’s home. She’s been asking for you.”
JARVIS responded, too sassily Tony might add, with, “Sir, it has indeed been approaching 48 hours since you ate anything substantial. Might I suggest you eat something soon?”
Tony and Steve had frantically started searching when JARVIS first sent out the alert, but were talked back to SHIELD headquarters by Pepper, of all people. Since she was Peggy’s godmother, JARVIS had sent her the alert too, along with Rhodey and Sam.
Steve looked up from reading over Tony’s shoulder, “They joined because a Stark weapon killed their parents?”
Steve didn’t have an answer, he just curled himself tighter around Tony and they both cried. Cried because they couldn’t be there for their children, cried because they both felt that they weren’t enough, cried because they didn’t even know if Peggy and Peter were alive.
what he had done wrong. At first, he thought that maybe he was overprotective when the kids were first home, but then figured that Tony probably had the tower on lockdown. So it couldn’t have been that.
Peggy wandered in soon after, tears trailing down her face. Steve opened his other arm and Peggy came running. Soon, the couple was whispering reassurances to both of the crying children arms.
Tony sighed and paused before responding,”Okay,” he shrugged out of the blanket, “what did you want to know?”
Sometimes Tony rubbed his face so much, he thought it would come off, “Yeah, Bruce. No problem. I’ll let him know. It might be a bit. Peggy had just gotten to sleep when I left, so Steve probably isn’t going anywhere for a while. But I’ll tell him when he gets up.”
Tony whispered something that Steve couldn’t make out, even with supersoldier hearing. He asked Tony to repeat himself. This time, he could make out what Tony said.
“Those should keep him out long enough to take out the rest of these goons. We’ll pick him up on the way back. Bruce has more sedatives on the jet.” Steve was still just staring, “Steve, babe, we gotta move.You with me?”
Finally, Toni let out the sobs and wails that had been building. Building since the minute she took off the ring. She sobbed for the child they had lost, she sobbed because she couldn’t even do this right, she sobbed because she had just lost the one person she had ever loved. There was nothing else to do, so she sat and cried and let the panic and grief consume her.
The man stepped into the cell, coming towards them. Peter pulled them both into the far corner, knowing it would only delay the inevitable. The man reached down towards them.
Steve frowned at Sharon, before all the pieces started to click into place. Human experimentation. HYDRA had originally taken both of the kids but had given up Peggy rather easily. It was Peter they had kept longer. Peter who was already enhanced.
A month later, they had most of their fears out in the open and calmed. Two weeks after that, they started trying. Six months later, when they still hadn’t conceived, Toni went to see her OB/GYN. They ran tests which ultimately said that there wasn’t any particular reason they weren’t getting pregnant, it just wasn’t happening.
Bruce jerked awake when he heard JARVIS. The exhausted scientist had fallen asleep at his desk, yet again.
The couple waited for a handful of minutes. They hadn’t gotten a response yet and thought that maybe just tucking her in between them for a nap would be the best option. But then, Peggy started talking. Really talking, in full sentences, spitting them out like she had done it her whole life.
“How could you say that? I’ll have you know, this movie is a classic. I think it’s considered unpatriotic to not know it!”
Clint took off with the explosions. The bunker wouldn’t serve HYDRA, or anyone else for that matter, anymore. Peter had gotten a kick out of seeing Thor use the lightning to blow it up. The kid needed to laugh.
She came to and it felt like coming out of a fog. Clearly, the person trying to wake her up was Clint, but Clint hadn’t been in the Red Room. Why was he here now? Where was here, for that matter. The fog started to clear.
Steve looked hopeful for the first time since the kids had been taken, Tony jumped up and kissed Bruce. Steve wasn’t even phased at this point, but Bruce was rightfully startled.
The man just laughed, “Oh but we do have the suit young one. A complete Iron Man suit in exchange for your sister, that was the deal. For you though, I do not think there is going to be an exchange. We will simply give you back when we are ready.”
Steve sat down on the open loveseat, Toni curled in his lap, “Loud and clear, Nat. But we have some news for you guys.” The supersoldier looked up at his wife.
Peter jolted awake, yet again. Although, this time, not in pain. He was more aware this time, though he highly suspected he had been drugged again. He was looking around the cell, hoping for something different. And there was definitely different this time. Peggy was gone.
Again, no response, just gasps and more sobs. Tony knew all the gasping and wheezing he was hearing wasn’t good. It sounded similar to a panic attack and Tony fucking prayed that it wasn’t a panic attack.
She sees him moving his tongue before she can reach out and stop him. In the next minutes, the man is convulsing violently on the floor, foaming at the mouth. His last words?
Pietro yawned from his spot on the couch, “I should probably get going, it’s been a long day and I’m sure you guys want to get some sleep.”
He started out softly, “I know what Howard always said, but I don’t know how many times I have to tell you, that’s not true. If you’re struggling, I’m here, the team is here. You can talk to any of us Tony. Not one person on this team is going to judge you. No one. If you’re not sleeping, that’s important to us. It’s important that we know, because we all have to have each other’s backs. We work as a team, that’s the only way we defeat whatever’s out there. I know you’ve always been told not to rely on anyone else Tony, and I know that despite what I tell you, you’re always gonna believe that in some way, shape, or form. I just,” Steve paused, “I just want to be able to be there for you, no matter when it is, or what it is. I want to be the person you turn to.”
Steve stayed quiet for a moment or two before stuttering out a response, “B-b-bad d-day. And dre-ams. A-a-and me-mories.”
Steve decided that sleeping bent over the workbench wasn’t good for anyone. A bed was the best place to sleep. He picked Tony up and told JARVIS to take them to Tony’s floor.
Pietro was in a completely different boat. He was loving living at the tower. After Clint had electrocuted Wanda, Pietro had initially hated the archer. After the third or fourth escape attempt though, they formed some weird kind of father-son bond. But not really because nobody in their right mind would think of Clint as fatherly.
The man laughed some more, “Oh but that’s where you’re wrong my dear, if they really cared about you, wouldn’t they already be here? Would you be here at all if they really cared?”
The shower seemed to help a bit, but the coffee enabled him to get down to the shop. And the shop let him get back to work. Getting back to work felt normal, human, something that would never change. Tony thought that maybe going up to bed had been a bad idea. He hardly ever had night terrors when he fell asleep in the shop, but had them almost every time he went to sleep in his bed.
The man was furious. Not the kind of furious where they made up after Toni did something reckless in the field, but the kind of furious where Steve spent the day in the gym, breaking punching bag after punching bag.
And that’s how they fell asleep,Tony covered by Steve, getting the first real sleep he’d had in weeks.
Steve caught him, his legs apparently not wanting to hold him up. “Tony, I know we haven’t been friends very long, but if something has you this shaken then clearly it’s
Bucky started laughing the minute he saw the kids, “Stevie, I thought you’d been a parent for a few years now. What the heck is going on?” He was already helping Peter fix his suit.
Steve had been right, whether Tony wanted to admit it or not. Preschool was good for Peggy. The nightmares were down to two nights a week at the max, and she was talking more and more. If anyone asked her about her past though, she bottled everything right back up. Everyone had learned to steer the conversation away from Peggy’s past when she was around. Life was finally beginning to settle down again, both of the kids were in school, Steve was back to working part time at SHIELD, and Tony was back to spending all day in the shop. Life was good, until one day it wasn’t.
Tony started bustling around the shop again, simultaneously talking to JARVIS. Steve just stayed where he was. He made no move to leave, but also didn’t attempt to start a conversation. However, everytime Tony looked over, Steve was wearing the eyebrows of disappointment. And damn it, if those things weren’t more effective than puppy dog eyes.
Fury slammed his hand on the table, “We ARE operating under the assumption that these fuckers have access to magic of some kind or another. Until such time as it is clear that they don’t, we need a better solution. Understand?”
“It appears that you and Miss Romanov will be needed to take care of the children in the morning. Shall I alert you when they wake?”
“Alright, munchkins. Let papa and I get some coffee and then we’ll go see about this Easter Bunny business, sound good?”
She leveled him with a stare, “Cut the bullshit. You know exactly what I’m talking about. Now spill.”
All Steve and Tony saw was a silver flash. That is until Peter and Peggy were squealing and giggling in Pietro’s hug. They had tensed up at first, not knowing who was coming in, but when they saw their oldest, the couple relaxed and grinned.
Tony turned the lab stool around to face the music, “Pepper! To what do I owe this call? I reviewed and signed all the stuff you sent over yesterday.”
A sigh escaped from Steve. He knew he needed to go talk to Bruce, but right now? All he really wanted to wrap his family up and stay with them for as long as possible. He just guided Tony back towards the bedroom, “I’ll go talk to Bruce later, right now, I think we need some time.”
Her husband turned and let out a choked sob of a laugh, “I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. Running, that’s what you’re best at, huh? The only thing you know how to do, am I right?”
His husband was quick on his heels, “Give me one fucking reason you pulled me away from my kids for this? One good fucking reason I shouldn’t walk back out the door right now?”
Tony and Steve exchanged looks of alarm over Peter’s head, why would Peter even think that? They both sat there, cuddling Peter, whispering reassurances as much for Peter’s benefit as their own.
. You.” Steve kissed his forehead. “Are not.” He dropped another one on Tony’s nose. “Mr. Stark.” Finally, a kiss on his lips.
Her face took on that hard expression again, “Stark, I’m going to tell you this once, and if you don’t believe me fine, then don’t. But you listen carefully. Steve Rogers is in love with
Peggy sometimes tagged along, but she wasn’t quite on par with her brothers. The girl was whip smart for a three year old, but she preferred playing with the bots over anything and DUM-E and U were thrilled someone other than Steve wanted to play with them.
Tony knew he was dreaming. He had to be. It had to be a dream because he didn’t go through the wormhole in Afghanistan. His dad hadn’t been there in New York. So, logically, Tony knew this must be a dream.
She was getting ready for bed when Steve came in. Toni had just gotten back from Africa, overseeing the implementation of new water filtration systems in Ghana. They locked eyes and just stared at the sorrow in each other’s eyes for what seemed like eternity before Steve surged forward and kissed her.
“I was a bitch before, I’m not going to deny that. I ran and locked you out and away from me. I had no consideration for anyone else but myself. I realize that now. But before? I wasn’t thinking and I- I just need to talk to you Steve. Really sit down and talk. Because I can’t do this without you. These last few months? There were days I wondered why I even bothered. Because you wouldn’t want me anymore after what I’d done and there really wasn’t anyone else to be living for, so why should I bother?
A scowl etched itself on Bucky’s face, but it was enough to make Steve laugh. He continued on with his story, starting again with how they first talked about adoption. That led to him talking about Peter, the joys they had had seeing him grow up and
Peter was waking up again, he could tell. He could feel the concrete underneath him. There was a cot in the corner, but he had been standing when they shot the dart at him, leaving him to wake up on the floor. He lifted his head and looked around. Seemed to be the same cell, still no Peggy. As he was starting to speak, the door opened again. The man in black stepped inside this time. Peter just glared at him.
His face crumpled as he curled into Steve. The two simply sat on the bed and let the tide roll over both of them. One mourning the loss of a child and the other mourning his sister.
Her husband’s tone of voice changed when he started talking, “Okay, well I mean, the hospital bag is already in the car, but we’ll have to call Nat, cause I think she’s at SHIELD right now. If we call now she should be able to make it back before we have to leave and then we have to tell the rest of the team. And we should go upstairs, just so that we’re prepared for when we have to leave and -”
These people kept trying to get him to talk but he didn’t know any of them. How did he know who he could trust? If he told anyone anything, that information could be valuable. He just kept repeating his name, rank, and social. Over and over, just like in Zola’s lab, all those years ago.
Steve started by saying, “JARVIS told me to come down, that your vitals were off. Do you know what happened?”
Tony just rolled his eyes, “I’m sorry, I was under the impression you wanted to wipe HYDRA off the face of the earth. Or was that someone else?”
Tony thought it was a Thursday, but he could have been wrong. He was only maybe 12% sure. He didn’t bother keeping track of the days, JARVIS and/or Pepper told him when he had something important to do, so why should he bother? Also, he had fallen asleep in the shop again, not surprising. Sometimes though, he fell asleep in the shop and ended up in his room the next morning, or whatever eight hours later was. He never mentioned it to the team.
Steve was now laughing through the tears, ‘God, baby, no! Bucky and I were ever only friends! Yeah, he’s attractive, but I wouldn’t leave you for the world.” He rested his forehead against Tony’s, “Why didn’t you just talk to me, sweetheart?”
She scrambled to her feet, “Yeah,” she shook her head to clear it, “let’s move. Where are we going?”
“Tony?” Steve asked tentatively. He wasn’t sure how Tony was going to react, seeing as his usual response to concern or love was to brush it off with smart remarks.
Toni hissed when the contraction rolled through. It felt kind of like the Braxton-Hicks that had been coming more frequently but something told her this wasn’t one of those.
There were murmurs of assent from around the room, the team too dispirited to do much else. The room was silent for a while before Bruce spoke up,
Toni moved so that Steve would wrap his arm around her as they walked, “I think that sounds like a plan. We just have to find a way to keep a secret for the next two weeks. That’s not gonna be easy.”
It became tradition for Steve to either bring her food or drag her upstairs to eat the food. And if it wasn’t food, there was always something for them to bond over. After awhile, and it took her longer than she liked to admit, she realized that Steve was trying to flirt with her.
“What the hell? No!” Tony jerked his head up and shot an affronted look at his husband, “It was something that we had considered a long time ago and I thought it might be worth looking at again. I only brought it up because Pepper got me thinking about it. If anyone is to blame for the subject, it’s her.”
Steve took a deep breath, “I can’t either. I thought that’d she’d cry or refuse to let us go or something.”
On the other hand, sometimes having other people around wasn’t so helpful. Like when Natasha insisted that coffee and food were not the same thing, and that, no Tony, you can’t just live on coffee. Or when Steve would bring food down and sit there until he had eaten at least half. Or when Bruce also told him to wear safety gear in the shop, shoes were totally not necessary when welding.
Her surroundings had disappeared completely. The bunker wasn’t there anymore, instead, there was a staircase. The very same staircase of her childhood. In a place she never thought she’d see again. It shouldn’t even be possible, the place had been torched. And yet, here it was. Tasha stumbled down the stairs, making her way to where she knew the studio was. This feeling was different, she knew she wasn’t physically there, but it was as if she was seeing through her past self. Her memories ran through everything, from her beginning, all the way up to the Ceremony. Then everything went dark.
At that, Steve’s face took on a completely different expression, but he was still wringing his hands, “Okay? Really, Tony? That’s the question you go with? Is everything okay?”
Peter woke up first, probably due to his heightened metabolism. At first, he couldn’t remember what had happened. Then he saw the cell walls and Peggy laying on the floor beside him. And then he remembered everything, the fire drill, and the big man in black, and the shot in his neck that had made him sleep. He figured that something similar had happened to Peggy. He tried to wake her up.
At first, he wasn’t sure why he had woken up. Everything looked the same and the Assemble alarm wasn’t going off, but then JARVIS spoke up.
He was pretty sure it was the same cell as before, but he couldn’t be sure. Peggy was curled in the corner, still sleeping. Or maybe sleeping again? Peter didn’t know. He didn’t see any new escape routes, but maybe he could get the vent cover off when Peggy woke up. He looked back over at Peggy.
The man just grinned up at her, “What else can I say, I’m being interrogated by the great Black Widow herself. I’m honored.”
How could he have been so stupid? They had gone through things like this when they first got together. Tony didn’t think he was good enough for Steve, he thought Steve would find someone better, and any number of other things. Eventually, they had gotten over it, around the time they brought Peter home. But now? Bucky coming back must have been Tony’s worst nightmare come true. Someone who was going to take Steve away.
For once in his life, Steve wasn’t going to fight it, “No Buck, I’m really not. But it’s a long story. If you don’t have hours to sit and listen, you might want to leave now.”
Natasha looked exasperated, “Of course that’s what I meant! I hate the fact that SHIELD didn’t think to do more than hand him files and get him an apartment. With so much happening at once, they couldn’t have possibly thought he was okay!”
Fury sent Sam and Rhodey to drop it off, they already had agents waiting in case these idiots picked it up themselves. So Tony, Steve, and the rest of team, were left to wait.
The house was small, smaller than most of the houses that she owned. But for right now? It would do. This was Toni’s new sanctuary and no one would disturb her here. The workshop was adequate for the work she’d need to do for SI and apparently, she had already installed JARVIS in the house.
“But then this little guy would kick or I’d make a new breakthrough in a project or I’d remember everything we had built together. A-and I just couldn’t give up. So please, Steve, please don’t give up on me, on us. I’m not even asking for myself anymore. Just let this baby have a father, Steve, please!”
syrup over her head. Steve groaned before swinging her into his arms and following Tony to the bathroom.
Steve was desperately trying to get the kids to eat their vegetables. Spoiler, it wasn’t working. Tony had always been so much better at this, but lately? Steve could count on one hand the amount of times he’d seen his husband in the last week.
Do you even know how much the kids have grown in the last six weeks? No! Because you haven’t hardly seen them!”
Steve immediately moved to take Peter, which calmed him down a little, but not much. The boy clearly wanted to be with his sister.
“JARVIS, is there a property that I own that Steve doesn’t know about? Anywhere at all?” Her mouth was still dry so she got up and moved towards the kitchen.
Steve’s smile was still matching Toni’s when he wrapped his arms around her waist and pressed their foreheads together, “I’m okay with whatever you’re okay with. If you think we should tell the team right now, then so be it. But if you want to wait until you start showing, that’s okay with me too. Alright?”
The tears just wouldn’t stop coming. He’d held them back for so long. For the first two weeks or so, he thought that maybe it was just Tony being Tony, not wanting to cope with feelings. Granted, that hadn’t happened since before Peter came along, but it had been a possibility. After the first two weeks? Steve knew there had to be something else going on. He wanted to be there for Tony, he really did, but he couldn’t when Tony wouldn’t let him.
Steve had been wracking his brain for weeks, trying to figure out what he had done wrong. Usually when Tony went on his workshop binges, it was because he was upset at Steve. But this time? Steve had no
Nobody wanted anything in particular, so Steve just started cooking. And kept going. He moved onto baking at one point. He continued making food, until there was no more food to make. Nobody called him out on it though, they all knew Steve liked taking care of people, and this was the best he could do under the circumstances.
Peggy had sobbed when both Steve and Tony left. They almost broke down at the sounds of her crying, but they had to bring Peter home. Pepper and Sharon both agreed to watch her, urging the team to hurry. Everyone was already at the tower when the beacon was activated, finding a sitter wasn’t hard. Leaving Peggy with anyone though? It didn’t matter that Sharon and Pepper were the closest things to family either of them had, they didn’t want to leave Peggy, still wary of another kidnapping attempt.
Peter woke up, back in the cell. He woke up with scars all over. He could feel the ones on his back, and see the ones on his chest. They weren’t hurting very much anymore, but he could tell they had not very long ago. Peter groaned a little as he sat up, looking at his surroundings.
“I don’t know what you’ve done with my sister, but if you hurt her, you’re going to be sorry! My daddy is Iron Man, and he’ll find you! My whole family will find you, and then they’ll take me home, and we’ll find Peggy too! You’ll see! My family isn’t going to be happy, and you wouldn’t like Uncle Bruce when he’s angry, I’ve seen the TV. He turns into the Hulk! You better let me go while you can! They’re gonna be here any minute now! There’s no way they won’t find me soon! And Papa won’t be”
Steve opened his mouth to speak but Tony beat him to it, “If you say one thing about my sleeping habits, I am revoking all of your security codes to get into the tower. Including the workshop and the gym. Choose your next words wisely.”
The elevator dinging brought Steve out of his thoughts. Both the kids whipped their heads around to see who was coming up. Visitors, no matter how often they saw them, were always a hit with the kids.
Peter was at the compound when they pulled up and he practically flew into Toni’s arms when she got out of the car.
Steve still looked visibly shaken after Bucky collapsed. Tony wanted to coddle him, but unfortunately, the coddling would have to wait.
Luckily, both of the assassins were there. They could keep Cap company until Toni was done with the work in the shop. Which was going to be awhile. The idiots in R&D couldn’t work out some simple bugs in the new StarkPad software. She had to do everything herself.
Nat went to get another mug out of the cupboard, while Tony pulled another stool up to the breakfast bar. Bruce offered Steve some eggs and bacon when he came over. Steve ate in silence while the others did “work” on their tablets. They all knew they weren’t actually doing work, but they pretended for Steve’s sake. When he was finished, Steve stuck his dishes in the dishwasher, mumbled a thank you, and headed back to his floor. Tony, Nat, and Bruce stayed in the kitchen, quiet, until JARVIS assured them that Steve was back in his apartment.
Tony and Steve hadn’t wanted to let Peggy be alone, so they were taking turns. Tony went to talk with the team first, as Peggy was still wrapped around Steve like a squid.
Peter’s eyes lit up with excitement, as did Peggy’s once they realized what Steve had said. They almost never got to pick movies. In fact, it was rare that Steve and Tony let them watch TV at all. Getting to choose what they wanted to watch was a special treat.
As soon as the doors opened, Steve could hear Tony. He heard the screaming and suddenly began to think he should have brought the shield. Steve just started sprinting toward Tony’s room.
Peter sniffled a little, but looked up and nodded with a small smile on his lips. Toni gave him another kiss and squished him into a hug.
All in all, Clint was rather disappointed by what they found. There were a few low level goons, but the top dogs they wanted had either gotten out or bit the bullet. Nat and Steve knocked out the ones left over before they could bite the bullet as well.
Peggy was talking in her sleep. Except that it really wasn’t like talking, it was more like whimpering and pleading. Steve was concerned but knew from experience that he shouldn’t wake her up. Peter was still blissfully asleep, curled into Steve’s side. Thanks be for small miracles. What really concerned Steve though, was that Tony was nowhere to be found. He would have asked JARVIS if there was chance it wouldn’t wake the kids, but he decided not to risk it.
Sharon heard the doors opening and whirled around. When she saw Tony and Steve, she almost let out a sob of relief. She loved Peggy and Peter to death and she was a trained SHIELD agent, but dealing with a sobbing toddler for 14 hours was starting to wear on her nerves.
Both Steve and Tony moved to talk to Bucky. He was still explaining what had happened when Peggy started talking. What she started to say shocked everyone.
“Peggy, papa and daddy love us very much. They’re gonna come with Uncle Clint and Aunt Tasha and Uncle Thor and Uncle Bruce and Aunt Sharon and Aunt Maria and everyone else real soon. They promised they’d never leave us alone.”
Her husband jack-knifed up in bed and turned the light on. Steve turned to look at Toni and his eyes caught on the sheets.
Dr. Evans just laughed and handed them the ultrasound picture, “I think you should be okay for right now to continue as you have been. As long as you’re staying away from chemicals and being
Bucky woke up. He knew his surroundings were unfamiliar but didn’t know how he was supposed to react. He knew that he was no longer in the Winter Soldier mindset, but he also didn’t know where he was. His memories were still fuzzy at best, nonexistent at worst. There must be a reason why he was here. It definitely wasn’t HYDRA, meaning he had either been captured or rescued. Either way, he was locked up. Again.
They waited until after dinner, when the kids were in bed and the Russian Sweethearts (as Tony had so affectionately named them) had left.
A few weeks later, it had become a habit, more of a tradition really. Tony would spend too much time in the shop, and not enough time eating, sleeping, or socializing. Steve would appear and drag him to the communal floor for food and a movie after. This happened at least twice a week.
“We found two of them that you might be very interested in meeting. More accurately, they came to us. Either way, you’re both going to want to see this.”
Toni was still smiling when he put her down. Her voice was quiet but her smile was as big as ever when she asked, “Do we tell the team? Or do we wait? Because it’s gonna be pretty obvious when I stop going out on missions. So either way, they have to know pretty soon. And yeah, I know you don’t usually tell people before the end of the first trimester, but they’re family and so I just didn’t know what we should do.”
“Peggy, listen to your father. Go brush your teeth.” Steve had put on the Captain America voice, the one that made anyone do anything, whether they wanted to or not.
Tony had extricated himself from the family puppy pile. He needed to check on Peter first and then get some work done. Whoever had taken his children needed to found and made to pay. He was thinking of programs he could run as he tip toed to Peter’s room. He peeked his head through the door, smiling at what he saw. Peter was starfished across his bed, sleeping so hard he was practically drooling. Tony quietly shut the door again and let Peter sleep, God knows the kid needed the rest.
They waited a week before there was any change in Steve’s condition. A week of people taking shifts and making sure that Toni took care of herself. She refused to leave Steve’s side.
They took one look at each other before running for the elevator, JARVIS already had the doors open.
So sometimes, having the tower to himself was nice. Like when he wasn’t needed on a mission. That was on rare occasions, but they were still nice. He could work in whatever conditions he wanted, promises to Bruce be damned. Coffee is a food group, and no other food groups were not necessary. This all worked out until one day…..
Talking usually helped calmed Peggy down, and Tony heard Steve speaking as he turned to get the blanket,
Natasha waited a minute before responding, “Could we rig a hologram? Based on what I’ve seen of these goons, they’ll go in person to pick the damn thing up.”
All three of them skidded to a halt outside of Peggy’s door. The sight in front of them was tense and fear filled, but also heartbreaking on a new level.
And spill Steve did. He told Bucky all about how he and Tony had first met, that meeting was a doozy. Then he went on to talk about their dating life and subsequently their wedding.
“Put a couple cases on next week’s grocery list J. Let Clint know the kids are sick and need the ginger ale.”
As they were walking down the ramp, they expected to see Peggy, waiting for them with open arms. Instead, they saw a frantic looking Pepper, a look no one had ever seen on the normally put together woman. Immediately, Steve and Tony were jogging rapidly towards her, sensing that something was wrong.
Steve had both Tony and Peter wrapped in his arms in a heartbeat, “I’m right here buddy. Right here and I’m not going anywhere, neither is daddy.”
Of course, JARVIS, the traitor, decided to butt in, “Sir, the recommended amount of sleep per night is eight hours. I believe you’ve had as many hours in three days.”
“Daddy, wake up! It’s Easter! The Easter Bunny was here last night! Daddy! There’s candy!” Peter was being entirely too chipper for this early in the morning.
Steve tried to sit up, so Tony sat up with him, still keeping him tucked into a hug as best he could.
Peter was there and he was alive. He sat up when he saw the War Machine armor walking into the room.
“He’s going to be beautiful and he’s developing right on track for the 7 month mark. Do you guys have any questions?” Dr. Evans handed Toni a towel to clean off the gel.
Flopping down on the bed, Tony grinned at Steve as he sighed. “Finally, soldier. Now, it’s been a long day. Get down here with me!”
Toni heaved herself off the couch, ignoring Nat’s gasp as she grabbed her phone, “I’ll get the jet ready, I can be there in four hours, tops.”
Steve opened his mouth the speak, but Tony held up a hand, “Just let me finish? I know now that that was dumb and unnecessary. I realize that my fears were entirely unwarranted. But I just, good things end up going bad for me at one time or another. I didn’t know how to react. I’m sorry, Steve. Can you ever forgive me?”
Now don’t get it wrong, Steve was glad to have his best friend back, but he just really wasn’t who he wanted to see right now.
“Daddy, do you have to go?” Tony was holding Peter, the boy understandably didn’t want to let him go.
The elevator door opened and Tony stepped out, “So what’s going on? What did we find out from that bastard?”
Steve came back and sat next to Toni on the bed, “Is this what happiness feels like? What it really truly feels like?”
They laid there for a while after Steve finished. Steve was lounging with his feet in Bucky’s lap when Bucky spoke up.
Steve pulled away to get a blanket and maybe some water, but almost immediately, Tony latched onto him.
Peter was still trying to comfort his sister when they started pumping the sleeping gas through the vent. It was invisible and scentless for the most part, someone would have had to have been looking for it to see it.
“Steve, I don’t want you to ever think you don’t belong here or aren’t needed here or,or anything of the sort ever again. I love you. I need you. Isn’t that enough? Also, can I call you sweetheart?”
He chuckled, “I don’t think I’ll ever forget the fight we had over your name, sweetheart. In the end though, we found the three strongest, most beautiful names we could think of. Your first name? You’re named after one of the most powerful women either of us ever knew. Margaret Carter. Her nickname was Peggy, just like you. You’ll learn more about her as you grow up.”
It only made sense that he proposed right after the Triskelion. Toni and Sam had sat by the bastard’s bed the whole time he was out. Toni made sure to tell him how much of an idiot he was after he woke up. The doctors wanted to keep him in the hospital longer, but Steve wouldn’t hear of it.
Sam finally had enough, “Man, you gotta relax. We’re all worried, but driving yourself up a wall isn’t helping anyone here. Just take a break.”
Dr. Turner was fantastic. She didn’t specialize in children so when Bruce had recommended her, the couple had been skeptical. However, after the first session, everyone knew they had to look no further.
But as much as she groused about his initial invasion of the shop? The rest of their lives were history after that.
So, when he woke up from dream after dream after dream of his mom and the Howlies, of course he started crying. It wasn’t just crying either. No, this time it was full on sobbing. The kind of sobbing where it seemed never ending. Eventually it had gone on so long, Steve felt like he couldn’t breath. And if Steve felt like that, then he probably actually couldn’t. This feeling sparked memories of Bucky and his ma, and all the times they had been there through the asthma attacks. Those memories only made him cry harder, which made the breathing problem worse.
He opened the door and the billionaire very nearly fainted, his supersoldier husband not very far behind. They had both seen the pictures Tony had found in HYDRA’s files. Tony had seen them first and then Steve had been shown by SHIELD. But all of the pictures and descriptions in the world couldn’t have prepared them for this.
The men were watching on the monitor, just waiting for Peter to wake up. They were planning on exchanging Peggy for the suit and Peter for Steve’s blood, but finding out that Peter was already enhanced was so much better. They wouldn’t have to try to extract the serum now. As long as they had Peter, they could do what they pleased. HYDRA was confident that neither SHIELD nor the Avengers had any idea where they were holding Peter, therefore keeping their positions safe for as long as necessary.
Bucky sighed, “You’re so oblivious I don’t know how you’ve survived this long. It’s pretty obvious to me why Tony locked himself in the shop. You know him better than I do, you should have figured this out by now.”
The couple walked back to the car in a state of shock, “I can’t believe it.” Tony got in the driver’s seat, not that it really mattered, the car drove itself.
Natasha’s face softened considerably after hearing Tony’s confession, her voice was practically a whisper, “You really believe he’d do that to you?”
“Daddy, look! Lila got the hundred!” Peggy was happily waving her friend’s hand in the air for her while Lila was content to sit and giggle.
He shuddered at the thought of the kidnapping, but thankfully no one noticed. That was one memory he hadn’t wanted to relive. Not knowing where your children were? Not knowing if the next time you saw them they were going to be alive or dead? Steve had no desire to relive those memories in any way, shape, or form.
It had taken them awhile to find Peggy a therapist who was willing to work with her and that she felt comfortable with. After three, they almost gave up. But Peggy’s nightmares were still happening on a fairly frequent basis. Steve and Tony both knew they couldn’t just let life continue this way; their little girl was suffering and they were gonna find a way to solve this.  Finding a therapist that was a good fit was tough, but everyone knew it was going to be totally worth it.
And then they were back at it, trying to take this bastard out. They worked beautifully as a team. Or they did, up until this douchebag’s mask fell off. And then Steve looked like he had seen a ghost.
They fell into bed together that night. They fell in like they hadn’t since Malibu. It wasn’t the same and they could both feel it, but neither of them said anything. Both of them were just trying so desperately to feel something normal, they just kept going. It was sweaty and dirty and everything Toni would have ever dreamed of six months ago. But when they fell asleep that night, tangled into each other, there were tear tracks down both their faces.
Steve didn’t have an answer for that, he just tilted Tony’s head up and kissed him. Afterward, he pressed their foreheads together, “I don’t know sweetheart, I just don’t know.”
Steve was still holding Peter. One, because he didn’t ever want to let their son out of his sight ever again and two, because Peter wouldn’t let go. Even in his sleep, he had an iron tight grip. Not that Steve minded, when Peter latched onto Tony like this, Tony usually ended up with bruises from how hard Peter hugged. Steve could hold Peter for hours and come out completely unscathed. Right now though, it was a slight hindrance. Tony and he were trying to talk with Bruce without waking Peter up, it was proving to be quite the task. Everytime they started talking above a whisper, Peter would stir or mumble, prompting the trio to lower their voices even more.
Steve’s expression turned serious, “Why didn’t you just talk to me, baby? You know you can come to me about anything, right?”
Toni's voice came out so quietly that she wasn't sure if Steve could hear her, “I didn’t think you’d want me anymore. I screwed everything up so badly, I figured that you’d moved on and that I should just stay away. If I came back, I’d probably just be a nuisance.” Keeping her tears at bay was taking some real effort, not looking at Steve was helping.
Steve laughed and kissed her on the forehead, pulling her so that their foreheads were pressed together, “I love you. No matter what. Whatever this test tells us isn’t going to change that. Got it?”
He made a mental note to tell JARVIS to make a note. Never leave his daughter alone with Natasha Romanov again. She’d tricked him! His own daughter, at three years old, had tricked him! Admittedly, he should have seen this coming, but still! His three year old was being turned into a spy right in front of his eyes!
Tony ran his hands down his face, “According to Fury, he passed the psych evals. I don’t doubt that he did either. That man can keep everything bottled up like nobody I’ve ever known. He probably just wanted to get back into the action ASAP. I hate to say this, but maybe he thought he’d die there and not have to worry about living.”
As it turned out, Peggy didn’t want to sleep for very long. At least this time, she didn’t wake up screaming and sobbing. Steve didn’t know if he could go through that again. Peggy also didn’t want to let go of Steve; which Steve was perfectly okay with. They went to go check on Peter, who was still asleep. Steve just smiled, there was no feeling better in the world than knowing your family was safe and together.
Despite everything else they had talked about that afternoon, Tony still couldn’t get Pepper’s initial question off his mind. Steve noticed that night.
Steve bent down to hug Peter, “Bud, we’ll be back in a few hours. You have to go to school though buddy. We talked about this, remember?”
Steve and Tony ran towards Peggy, arms wide open. She was waking up, disoriented at first, but soon realized that daddy and papa had their arms around her. Peggy started crying immediately.
“This better be fucking good, Fury, or so help me god.” Tony was livid and Steve wasn’t very far off.
DUM-E was actually the one to snap him out of whatever that was. For a flash second, he thought back to the Mandarin, and the attacks he had during that time. But no, this wasn’t those. Those hadn’t shown up in years, they couldn’t possibly be back. He shook his head to clear the thoughts. “Everything is fine,” was the mantra running through his head. Tony shook it off, got some coffee, and went back to work.
“Please papa! Don’t go! I’ll be good, I promise! Please don’t leave me! Daddy! Don’t go! Don’t leave me! Please don’t go!”
Steve tucked Tony tighter into the blanket before speaking again, “Why didn’t you tell me? I could have helped.”
For the rest of the ride, the family stayed like that, curled into each other in an attempt to find comfort. It was very easy in the back of the Quinjet, it was designed to hold the maximum number of people, not accomodate cuddling families, but somehow three-fourths of the Stark-Rogers clan made it work.
It turned out, Sam was right, as usual. When Bucky saw Steve, the tension that had been simmering for weeks almost instantly bled out of his frame. Hope flooded his eyes.
Steve himself had to swallow hard. His trembling hand pushed some of his grown hair out of his face and he took a deep breath. It had been so long since he had heard Tony's voice. He remembered the moment when his phone rang, the same phone he had sent to Tony hoping that he would call if he needed him. The blonde supersoldier had been nervous to pick up, because he had never actually thought that Tony would call him, but as it rang hope blossomed in his chest and the disappointment was huge when he picked up and heard Bruce on the other end, saying that Tony and Spiderman had gone to space and that Steve needed to protect vision.
“Play it”, the Captain let out, his voice hoarse and full of emotion, when he cleared his throat and then just as the hologram of Tony appeared gasped.
“Doctor Banner, Captain Rogers. I'm sorry to interrupt, but there is a message directly sent to one of the Stark Industries Satellites. It was recorded from the Mark L armour”, FRIDAY cut in and Steve's head whipped around to the projection of, whatever Bruce had worked on, while his gaze flicked over to Bruce once more who just stood there frozen.
The genius looked tired. Not only that he was thin and his face was sunken. He looked bad and Steve felt miserable all over again.
Thanos had won and Steve Rogers, the great Captain America, had no idea how to fix everything that had gone wrong.
Tony paused, ran a hand over his tired eyes and Steve could see how he swallowed hard and thought for a longer time to even continue he then leant forward, looking intently into the eyes of the helmet and sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.
With a sigh Steve turned his gaze back to the man sleeping peacefully onto the bed and then smiled small. She was right. He himself had been so caught up in the fact that Tony could never feel the same that the
In a blink of an eye, Steve scrambled to his feet and in less than a minute he stood outside, Bruce and Pepper on either side of him. Rhodey and Natasha behind him, as well as Rocket. He couldn't believe it, but at the same time he didn't wanted to get his hopes up.
“You talk too much”, Steve mumbled, leaning down to press their foreheads together, causing the brunette man to stop talking for a brief moment.
it was only a whisper and Tony didn't even look into the camera his gaze was set to the right, likely looking out of the window into the void he had spoken of and Steve's heart stopped for a beat.
“Together?”, the billionaire asked, closing his eyes somewhat afraid of the answer even though he didn't have to be.
“Ah, you wanted to conjure your inner nomad, huh? Or did you wanted to look as old as you really are? Perhaps you wanted to be a handsome as Thor is or-”
“I think everyone besides you knows. You two have a talent for not being able to see the way the other one looks at you. Tony never got your pining and you never got his”, she grinned, patting his shoulder in a friendly gesture.
“None of that now. We have a long way to go, but I am willing to try and I do want you to understand that I am sorry too, I reacted to aggressive, but know that I was lost without you this two years. You have become a constant in my life Steve and then you were just gone”, Tony explained, his other hand slowly moving towards Steve's cheek and his thumb caressing the soft skin just above his beard.
Clint was gone. No one had heard about him after the snap, what caused Natasha to get furious whenever someone mentioned that he had vanished too.
“You're thinking awfully loud over there”, a female voice broke through his thoughts and Steve startled, turned his head and then gave Pepper a soft smile.
Thor who was supposed to help them had gotten into a deep depression. Who could blame him? He had lost his brother, the most of his people and the chance to prevent the titan from snapping.
Nat was one of the people who stayed at the compound, while Steve lead some other people through therapy to move on. He had asked her once why they couldn't move on and she had just smiled sadly at him, shrugged and said that this was the nature of heroes. Steve had made her a sandwich and kept her company even as she said that she was fine, but he knew better.
Steve's firm voice cut through the air like a knife startling the physician, who blinked a little flabbergasted at the Captain.
Once Tony was all patched up and resting on his bed Steve suddenly felt very insecure as he sat besides the sleeping genius.
Rocket had told him that his team was likely to be with Nebula, but his team weren't just two people, the racoon had told him about Quill, Mantis and someone named Drax and Gamora. And Steve knew by a fact that Tony was on a journey with Spiderman and Doctor Strange, so two out of eight people was bad. It was better than no one but still, Steve was pretty sure that those two people were Tony and Nebula.
Bruce worked hard to get them information on the stones, if Thanos could use them again. One day he seemed to have a break through but then he threw his papers around the lab that was once used not only by him, but by Tony too and Steve leant in the doorway looking as sad as Bruce was furious.
This building once was his home, but now after everything that happened it just felt empty and cold. The joy of his team was gone they had lost too many of theirs. And he himself, as the leader, couldn't get out of this darkness. He couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, couldn't train. He just felt numb.
“There's so much to talk about, Tony. I am deeply sorry. We should've talked about the Accords. I should've told you beforehand about your parents”, Steve rambled, then felt Tony squeeze his hand and looked up into the brown eyes.
“Don't give me that bullshit, Captain! I know Tony. I worked with him after you left in 2012 for your self-discovery trip. He had really hoped that the whole team would see what he had done out of the Stark Tower, but no. You all had better things to do.”
With that thought that Tony just got back to earth and limbed out of a spaceship he started running. He ran towards the opening and when he reached Tony, he quickly slung his arm around the thing body lane, staring down at him, while Tony's brown eyes stared back up. Steve helped him walk for a bit and then Tony stopped abruptly, clutching into Steve's shirt and gasped as he started to speak,
“No buts. He left you a goodbye message, Bruce told me. Now he's here there isn't a goodbye, so you both get to finally say all those unsaid things. Don't screw it up and don't hurt him again, or I make your life a living hell”, she said, kissed his cheek and then walked out.
“I-I lost him. I lost the kid, Steve”, the smaller man sobbed, still clutching onto Steve for dear life and the supersoldier had no idea how to act so he just pulled Tony close and walked him into the building.
“You gave me a home. And I just, I-”, he continued, tears streaming down his cheeks as he shook his head again and again.
“I leave you two”, he then said, about to stand up but Pepper's hand on his shoulder which pushed him back down made him stop.
Peggy woke up. This time though, it looked like she was home. She could see the butterflies on her closet door, and yesterday’s clothes in the hamper. She could smell whatever it was that daddy drank all the time. (Personally, Peggy thought it smelled pretty bad, but both daddy and papa drank it, so it couldn’t have been all bad.) The instant someone stepped through the door, she knew it wasn’t home. Because the person who walked through the door didn’t live there.
Tony had wanted to just buy kiddie pools and fill them with candies and other goodies, but Steve had quickly vetoed the idea on the grounds that the kids didn’t need that much sugar. Tony had huffed and sighed and whined but eventually compromised by finding the biggest Easter baskets possible. Which, if Steve was being honest, they probably weren’t that much smaller than the kiddie pools that Tony had originally proposed.
From then on out, Bucky improved rapidly. It turned out that HYDRA had managed to recreate some crude version of the Supersolider serum, meaning that physically, other than his arm, Bucky was fine. Mentally though? It was clear to the whole team that Bucky had been made to do unspeakable things as the Winter Soldier. Unsurprisingly, he bonded with Natasha quite easily.
“I am not sure my programming will allow that sort of monitoring, sir. But should Captain Rogers’ vitals fluxuate in an alarming manner, protocol would allow me to alert everyone immediately.”
The stomach bug ended up lingering for the next three days, in which Peter and Peggy slept, cried, and threw up, in that order. By the end, Tony and Steve were exhausted.
Steve turned around, “Relax? Sam, how can I? Peter and Peggy are gone, I don’t know when they’re gonna be back. Tony’s holed up in the shop in the hopes that we can bring Peggy home today. But God knows when we’re gonna get to bring Peter home, those bastards don’t look like they’re gonna give him up anytime soon. How the hell am I supposed to relax when I feel so fucking helpless to help my family?”
There was no coming back from this. Toni knew that for sure now. But it still hurt like a bitch. It hurt knowing that she’d have to raise this baby on her own. It hurt knowing that her broken marriage was all her fault.
Tony was gonna work with it, “There you are, sweetheart. We love you with all our hearts. We wouldn’t give you up for the world. We love you too much for that, beautiful.” He paused before continuing, “Do you know who you’re named after?”
Steve jerked awake, thinking that Peggy was having a nightmare, only to discover that it wasn’t Peggy that was crying, it was Peter. Tony was already running for Peter’s room when Steve heard Peggy.
Tony sat down and sighed, “You’re right! Fine! We’ll try it!” Then, “If either of you tell Steve I said you were right, I’ll set DUM-E loose on your floors.”
Just gonna say, be prepared for more and more angst as this story goes on. Starting in this chapter. Sorry, but also not.
Technically speaking, she had more meetings with the headquarters here in Spain before she was done, but there was no way she was going to any of them. Pepper probably already had them covered.
Rhodey held his hands up in surrender, “Just wanted to see if you needed any help man, I know you’re on the clock with this one.”
Peggy was sleeping without nightmares and talking more and more. She usually wouldn’t tell Steve or Tony but if they told Dr. Turner, she’d wheedle it out by the end of the session. Most of Peggy’s fears seemed to stem from her life before she’d been adopted. There was the problem of her mother just leaving her at the firestation, but until now, no one had realized how far back the issue went.
It went on for so long that sometimes it didn’t even seem like Peggy knew where she was. She just kept calling for Steve and Tony. Early on, she had called for mommy. This had baffled both Pepper and Sharon, knowing that she didn’t have a mommy here. Maybe that was who had abandoned her in the first place? Neither of them knew, they were just trying their best to calm Peggy down. She hadn’t been put down the whole time the team was gone. One of the two of them holding her at all times.
The last round of IVF was six months ago. Toni had missed her period last week. It wasn’t like they were purposely trying or anything. But going back on birth control had seemed redundant and they hadn’t used condoms since she and Steve had first started dating. She wasn’t hopeful for this test, but Toni was most definitely nervous. After all of their failed attempts, she felt like she had failed Steve.
“Captain Rogers is on one of the upper floors, but not in the general vicinity of Peggy’s present. Would you like him to be?”
