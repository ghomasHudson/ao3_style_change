But, at the turning of a corner and the onslaught of at least two dozen Demons in attack, Dean is reminded that he’s not only ash in the wind: he
He’s shown through the house. Room upon room of fine furnishings, dark wood carved into curves and coils, gold gilding on everything which might be gilded. Eventually, Alastair must get the impression that Dean isn’t impressed by any of this, because he cuts the tour short and takes Dean to see his birds. And this is where Dean realises it.
“Oh,” the other boy laughs. Dean isn’t sure what he finds so funny, but he sure does like the sound of Castiel’s laughter. “You like dragons?”
Castiel is given a surer sense of belonging than he’d ever thought possible, or himself worthy of—it’s hard to doubt your place when a precocious four year old shouts at you to stay absolutely still, that you’re moving your arm as she tries to colour in the honeycomb patterns inked onto your wrist. Iit’s hard to doubt your place when angry boys are soothed by your suggestions to do some digging outside, grow something good from their sorrows, plant deep and build well; it’s hard to doubt your place when these boys slip into a sense of belonging, too, and a belonging, in part, because of you. It’s hard to doubt your place when your oldest daughter comes home and seems swept with relief and joy that you’re right where she left you, as she tugs her girlfriend up the steps of the porch and asks, with all the presumption in the world, what’s for dinner.
“Cas—” He says, voice uneven. And, Castiel thinks, eyes nearly fluttering, that name was on Dean’s lips only moments ago, too. “How long—what—where—”
“I’d say—with less of an audience,” his cheeks prickle in the firelight and dozen sets of eyes turned on him, “—I’d ask you to marry me, I suppose—”
And Cas reading a story he wrote, to a little girl who carries so much of his character, if not necessarily his features, has Dean thinking about the impossible fairytale that is his dream of his and Cas’s future.
Cas sent him a gift on his birthday, too. It was a book again, but of Angel history, and Dean read the whole thing in only a few days. It was fascinating, and when he thinks of the effort that Castiel must have gone through to find it, the time it must have taken to find a book in
gonna leave you!” Dean shouts. “Cas was going to live a mortal life and come down here and stay with us and you weren’t gonna have to be alone—”
“It’s—it’s probably better if I just take this off—because—you know—of the fire—it’ll just dry easier if it’s off and—”
When the two of them tread softly back into Dean’s room, Cas closes the door behind him with a hungry look in his eye; and Dean barely has the time to frown questioningly at the Angel before he is crashed into, Cas’s lips bruising Dean’s, and Dean is thrown down onto his own bed.
Castiel wishes he were smaller. Wishes he were not some sprawling beast of a thing, incongruous matter and metaphysics anchored to a human form, wishes he were small enough to tread the ridges of these lines and sit in wonder at the thought of them.
Round, smooth stones of pale colouring have been arranged in some kind of path ahead of Castiel. The faint green tinge of moss covers their corners. Castiel follows them out of curiosity more than anything else. The green of the willows around him reminds him of Dean’s eyes—so many things do—and once again he wishes the Human would just
The Novak living room looks different with so many people and chairs clustered in it. It was big to begin with, big and welcoming and beautifully furnished, but now it seems all kinds of unpromising to Dean and he finds himself shifting awkwardly on his feet in some sort of nervous anticipation.
“You were over here, dreaming about visiting us?” Castiel asks, and Dean is confused by the amusement in Castiel’s voice.
“I don’t think he’d agree,” Dean lets out a reluctant laugh. “Normally, I was the loud, shouty one out of the two of us.”
One of the girls, Lena, at the front of the class, doesn’t seem able to look at Castiel, but rather fiddles with her pen and looks at the floor and shifts in her seat in a restlessly nervous kind of way.
had been the one to spark his eyes at Dean, follow Dean outside when drunken, Dean had stepped out for cleaner air than the smoke-heavy atmosphere of the tavern. And Lee had followed out and said
“What’s all this?” Castiel asks, with warm laughter, as Dean takes his hand and takes him down the cliffs towards the sea, down into a cove covered by the setting sun and ragged rock face fringed with wildflowers. Away, that is, from the eyes of any. The sea is a dark and silver-tinted colour in the dying autumn light, and what light there is glints off of it like the sea is a web of crystals and not in fact the English Channel.
“I suppose you’ll simply have to take our word for it,” Anna replies coolly. Her face is firmer than ever, becoming as resolute and unreadable as a stone.
“It is!” Dean raises his voice, slamming his hand down on the table. “Me, Sam. I’m broken. He knew better than anyone. He was the one who had to fix me, most times, and he still…”
“I bet the view is better from the mountains,” Dean replies. The sunlight dances in the sky over their heads, setting the low clouds above them on fire in strobes of gold.
“Well, that’s too bad, Dean,” she replies firmly, although her tone is considerably gentler, now. “’Cause he already has. And then some. And you know what? He doesn’t care about what you look like. He cares that you’re okay. That’s why he came to visit. Now, are you going to let him in?” Her voice has become more and more tender as she has gone on, and is now next to motherly with an unspoken love and calmness pulsing through her words.
“I’d wait forever.” The words are a promise steady and trembling as the stars. “Until the end of all things. I’d wait forever.”
And so I get nervous, and then I just start talking shit—like I am now—” he cuts himself off and looks down, a small, anxious laugh tumbling out from his lips. Castiel’s hand brushes underneath Dean’s chin almost without the Angel realising it.
“Why do you call me Castiel?” He asks. His hands have moved to the short hairs at the nape of Dean’s neck; it’s all the Human can do but stop himself from shivering. Stopping himself from purring is a different matter, and as it is, Dean knows he’s fighting a losing battle.
but first and foremost, Dean has always been a dear and beloved friend—the very dearest. It’s wrong that Castiel should isolate himself from his once-best friend, yet again. Isn’t it?
Dean had begged Jimmy to take Sam on instead of all those hopeless shrinks and therapists who’d put his brother on a cocktail of
but he wanted him safe. And I always made sure he was. So yeah—my brothers, only thing I haven’t fucked up. Came pretty close with Adam—nearly shut him out, definitely hurt him.” Castiel looks at him sadly as he speaks. “I know—I know things still aren’t
His body is mottled entirely now. Covered in etches and scratches and gashes, jarring at awkward angles. Some better healed than others, some fresher, rawer. Dean looks down and sees the marks of his own faults, clear, cutting. They’re obvious. They hurt during the night, stinging and aching—at the time when Dean’s mind wants rest more than ever, they sear at his skin with renewed ferocity. One day, when Dean gets too frustrated with his own condition, he causes one of his wounds to split; the stitches the finest physicians in the Kingdom worked so hard on, ripping open, his body tearing apart and blood ebbing through again as all around him panic breaks out. Ellen starts crying and Sammy pleads with him to stay still because Dean has apparently lost enough blood already.
He repeats, and he hears Gabriel snort a laugh opposite him, and turns to glare at his brother, instead.
sitting, teaching young eighteen to twenty-something year-olds about beautiful wrought words in books and asking them to create their own.
Dean feels sick with sadness at the thought; Dean is in love and feels so powerless with it, Dean is in love with his best friend and is probably going to have to marry the girl next to him and make her unhappy with his thin and brittle love that cannot love wholly, that cannot nourish wholly. Dean is in love with his best friend and the rest of his life feels like a prison sentence.
“For me,” he gestures to himself, “for the betrothed,” to Charlie, “and for the cutie with the long face at an engagement party,” he laughs, eyes sparking. Dean swallows, face prickling. Charlie watches him.
“Oh, yeah,” Dean confirms. He begins halving, then halving the potatoes again. “Hess owns a workhouse.
“Right,” he blinks, mouth twitching. He draws in a stuttering breath. He smiles at Castiel, blinking, lashes fluttering, blinking more. “Right,” he repeats. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hand. “I got a job, too,” he says, as though he tries to distract himself with the words.
“As far as I can see, Michael,” Dean says, turning to the Archangel and pressing his blade to Michael’s neck. Michael’s eyes flash, but he does nothing. “We’re under attack, my people facing death, because of you—because of you, and your childhood feud with your twin brother. My
He glances at Cas, wants to give him a look of apology, but Cas has already turned out of the room. Dean watches his retreating back.
When they finally get to their hands and knees to pick up the spilt coins from all over the floor of his room, he can’t stop watching Castiel, and his torn and dirtied shirt, and the tattered hems and weakened seams of his clothing. Yes, he’s beautiful—beautiful, yes, and his wild and weathered look was what washed at Dean’s heart when they first met. But now it hurts to think of his battered belongings, and how little Castiel seems to think that he deserves every kindness he will share with others.
“It’s, uh,” Dean wrinkles his nose and his throat makes a sharp, constricting noise which he coughs around, “it’s hard for me to separate what was done—what they did, and didn’t do—from who I was. Who I
Castiel exclaims, a little too quickly, a little too loudly, and he blushes at both his brother’s and King John’s raised eyebrows.
They eat, and laugh, but the feeling in Dean’s chest doesn’t dim, rather grows into some unknowable nervous flicker like the beating wings of a bird against a cage.
“You—” Dean coughs once, and takes a generous sip of his drink, “you enjoy that?” He asks, obviously awkward. Balthazar smiles.
“I’m still holding out for the moment Dean decides to sing for us, one of those dinners,” Ellen looks up from the tabletop she polishes. Dean rolls his eyes.
When Castiel was four years old his dad had to sit him down on his bed and talk to him about the messiness of the human brain and how some brains grow riddled and wrought with messiness, more so than others. Castiel asks
But Dean, paralysed as always by fear and embarrassment and self-doubt, does not reply, cannot reply. Cas’s texts are getting more and more infrequent. He seems to be giving up.
Is this the beginning of the end of their friendship? Will going to Cambridge be the most regretful decision Castiel makes? It would be stupid
no, not to begin with,” he answers. Dorothy raises her eyebrows with a smirk. “But—y’know. I can’t blame him. And—he was polite, anyway. You know Cas. Apart from a couple’ times, where he lashed out a little, but again, fair enough. And I said—I apologised, for all the crap I pulled, nine years ago.”
“Are you—” Dean is looking at him hard. But whatever emotion is hidden behind Dean’s eyes, is shrouded by the rain. “Are you okay, Cas?”
Balthazar tips his chair back and looks up to the ceiling wistfully. “Oh, it’d have been grand—you could’ve had an apartment on Southbank overlooking the Thames, a townhouse by Primrose Hill, a home in Wimbledon—”
Next chapter will a. Be way longer than all the others so far, and b. Feature Dean and Cas finally talking.
“These were hers,” Bobby says with a distracted smile. He picks up a silver bracelet with coiled chains which spiral back on themselves like waves pulled off a shore.
“Castiel, it’s fine,” Dean laughs, shaking his head. “Wow, you’re almost as stubborn as me. Not in a bad way,” He adds this amendment, quickly, but Castiel shrugs him off.
“Wings—our wings—Angel wings, that is. But—well, Michael said that yes, there is some lore surrounding that, and it is most likely founded in some kind of truth. So, I’m sorry, too.”
“So, do you have it?” She asks. Dean blinks. “The book!” She sighs. “Hand over the book.” Dean glances at Sammy. “Wow,” she looks over at Lucifer. “Slower than they look.”
“It’s her first. I’ve been helping her these past weeks. She’s all alone,” Cas says, sadly. He takes a long sip of his tea, and looks away.
That evening he sits in the Croft, jaw clamped shut and chest like a vice. Cas works around him and his slouched, angry form at the table, the shepherd doing everything and not once asking Dean for help. If he did, it’d make Dean angry. The fact that he doesn’t makes Dean angry. He’s making something out of the fish he and Dean caught, the day before. But Dean doesn’t look up. Only glares at the table, angry at the fates who all his life have trailed after him with strokes of bad luck, with misfortune, with tragedy and catastrophe. Yes, angry with the fates though more angry with himself for believing he’d managed to run from them, that he’d left them somewhere, somehow in America.
“You heard me,” Dean nods seriously, finally beginning to brush. Cas looks away with a grin, shaking his head. He spits.
“What do you think it was, then?” Anna asks, leaning forward from where she sits and brushing the tips of her fingers across the back of Castiel’s hand.
And that’s just it—Cas is back, standing a matter of feet away from Dean, but he’ll only be here for seven days. After that—well, Dean has no idea. Him and Cas don’t talk anymore.
His name on Cas’s lips has Dean’s heart tearing with the saddest kind of happiness he thinks he’s ever felt. He never knew melancholy could taste so sweet. He never knew loneliness could feel so wistful. He never knew love could ache like loss.
Dean just wants to break down. Wants to have Cas’s arms wrapped around him as he does; wants to be free to share his own brokenness with the man opposite him and in doing so mend it. But he can’t.
Castiel does this, over the same symbol as he did before, just to be sure—but nothing happens. Why does nothing happen?
Castiel tries, but Dean isn’t listening. He surges forward. His lips find Castiel’s and it is a hard and burning kiss that Dean buries them in, stung with spirits, singed by nine years since their lips last met, for the first time, and it is breathless and heartbroken and gasping and shocked and lumbering, like a great and hungry beast sprawling down the face of a mountain, emerging from a cave; it is nine years on fourteen years, it’s thunder and the smoke in the air before a lightning strike, it’s, it’s—
“This was my father’s ring,” Castiel repeats, and Dean blinks and can’t believe it; on the roof, on the roof of all the hurt, on the roof of all of the hope, Dean is returning home. “And after he died, it was given to me, not just by Gabriel and Michael—it was in his will: he wanted me to have it, and to use it for… Well, I think I know. I think we both do. And now—and now, Dean—”
“John?” He calls out. “Father?!” He sprints to the door and flings it open—the guards lie all around, motionless, bleeding from their eyes, Dean gags, retches, but turns—the King is lying back on his bed—a window is open, and Dean sees the black smoke swoop out of it. He hardly has time to register; he rushes over to the bed and kneels beside his father, heart hammering and breaking and crying out in his throat.
“It’s so…” Dean licks his lips, looking down. “He was so different, to the kind of fatherhood I was used to…” Dean swallows, gaze fixed on the folds of his own hands. Castiel doesn’t know what to say to this, and so is completely silent. “I… I’m feeling so out of love, with so much of my childhood, right now. The past few years, I’ve been so out of love with it—with my house, my parents… The kind of dad Jimmy was,” he licks his lips and lets out a sour kind of laugh. “I was always so jealous of you, for it. Is that bad?” He looks up at Castiel, who still cannot answer, but fortunately at least manages to shake his head minutely. “It is,” Dean disagrees. “And not like—it wasn’t resentment. But I was
“We were neighbours,” Castiel answers, glancing at the others. “I moved into a new town, a new city, a new—everything. I was a very sad and melancholy child. But not when Dean came along. He’ll always undersell the importance of his friendship to me. But it’s meant everything.”
“I have quite a few birds of prey. Yes, the farmers round these parts do seem to have a habit of collecting birds,” Alastair laughs, and Bobby obviously fakes one. “If you’re such an avid reader around hawks, perhaps you’d like to come and see a few, in person.”
He doesn’t find it disgusting, or even slightly upsetting, to think of the differences of the Human body. There lies in his heart a simple element of strange, enthralled fascination—he’s drawn to the idea of so many differences between humankind and his own race
He doesn’t want to have to be without Dean, who is the only person in all the world Castiel has met who actually
He spots Bela looking a little shellshocked and not listening to what Meg, Isaac and Tamara around her are saying. He doesn’t have the time to focus on this—Charlie and Dorothy come over and Dorothy begins talking to Cas about how he should get into the film business—she looks to Dean for backup on this on several occasions, but Dean is pulled aside by Charlie who starts insisting that
There’s very little that’s more terrifying than your little brother tasting death. And this isn’t even the first time. What’s never understated is the thrumming terror in response to not knowing what overdosing will have done, this time around. The same questions skitter along the cave walls of Dean’s skull:
It’s happy, and simple, if Castiel forces up the walls in his mind of maintained, sustained, wilful ignorance. He doesn’t think of his past, he tries
Dean looks down. His ears buzz faintly with Sam’s words. What is speech, but a vulnerability? Saying anything is like holding out your palm to a stranger with a knife.
“And, uh—it’s okay not to be okay, you know?” She raises her eyebrows, worriedly at Castiel. “You don’t have to have everything together, all the time. And you’re—y’know,” She swallows again, frowning. “Going through a lot. It’s okay to be worn out by it.
confused about why you weren’t making a move on the camping trip. It was only at the wedding I realised it was because you thought I was seeing Balthazar.”
out of the loop there, Charlie,” Meg laughs, shaking her head. “Dean hasn’t spoken to Cas since we were
Dean gets a call from one of Claire’s teacher that she’s been caught smoking weed behind the cafeteria, and, when rebuked for this, cussed out the teacher who’d found her and ran out of the school. Considering this, and her track record, she’s been suspended. The added humiliation of the people Claire is cursing and yelling at being Dean’s ex-co-workers is hard to overlook, even though he wants to be unemotional about the whole mess, for Claire’s sake.
His brother’s lips twitch upward a little more. Castiel practically leaps off his bed to take the letter from him. Michael watches as Castiel reads it, scanning it over and over again, drinking in the words, the handwriting, everything about it.
“—You could’ve called me, sent a letter, a postcard. Didn’t you go on a honeymoon? You could’ve sent me one, from there. You never thought to tell me?”
Isaac, Ezra, and a little girl called Charlie. The name makes Dean’s eyes glassy as soon as he hears it. Maybe this is part of why he’s so determined to take the kids in.
When they’ve cleaned one another softly with wash cloths, and Cas has cupped water over Dean’s hair and Dean has hummed and closed his eyes and tipped his head back, when he’s kissed every inch of Cas’s face and paid special attention to the pretty corners of his eyes, when the water has turned from hot to warm to cool, they step out and dry one another off. Who knows the hours they have wasted, here? It doesn’t matter: Dean hasn’t been able to relax in weeks, and today was his first day not packed to its borders with tasks and chores. His muscles are loose and soft. Cas’s smile seems to be set on his lips. Dean wants it set there forever. Except perhaps when he’s frowning his pretty frown, perplexed, at one of Dean’s jokes, or blinking at one of Dean’s rude comments, or squinting at something Dean has said sarcastically, or keeping his expression even and still as Dean laughs through his attempts at teasing. Or when he’s working and focussed and his lips are parted and his eyes are bright and sharp and steady and soft, honed in on one thing while Dean could watch forever. Or when he’s sleeping and his features are pressed hard into the pillow, or soft and completely blank and turned up towards the ceiling. Except for all these times. Except for all these times, Dean wants Cas to be smiling forever.
sounds at the other end. Not a freak of technology. The world becomes a seed of hope. It takes root among the sinews of Dean’s heart. But Cas sounds desperate, he sounds like he’s in pain—Dean’s heart clamours around the hope rooted in it. “I’m here,”—his breath is laboured—“I’m hurt. Can you let me in?”
Some strange distance lies between them, charged with static energy, and the words which strike next will be like the barb of lightning striking between the rift of heaven and earth.
“Hey, Cas,” he says, eyes glittering and wide, smile loose and hesitant. It’s—it’s like in the kitchen that first day of shiva. Castiel knows that expression, now; Dean wore it then, all those months ago, and Castiel had misread it, not known it, not understood it. Perhaps he hadn’t wanted to. He understands it now, knows the slope of those shoulders and what Dean is thinking of, knows the glittering eyes and what has prompted the water in them, knows what Dean is worrying about, knows the flickering, restless smile and what feelings have caused it. He prays he can be worthy of them.
“I don’t need you making me feel guilty, Dean!” Sam’s expression trembles and his face grows wet from tears. “Father did it enough—I felt like a
beams at him as he speaks. They’re straining the red, pointed berries Dean saw Jo carrying in yesterday through a muslin cloth. The berries have been cooked in water and turn to mulch in the cloth.
His voice is hard and near aggressive, as though he thrusts the truth towards Castiel and wants nothing more to do with it. Castiel’s lip twitch, like they want to speak without the permission of his own brain, but nothing comes out of his mouth.
“Why because of me?” Castiel asks, voice quiet. But Dean only stares at him—the quintessential Winchester scowl—and doesn’t answer. The dark haired man figures he won’t be getting one out of Dean, today, and so exhales grumpily, closing Dean’s door and moving over to the driver’s seat.
“How could you not know?” Castiel asks, the most earnestly he’s asked anything. He shakes his head. His eyes glitter with tears. Do—Do Dean’s eyes glitter, too?
“So it is my loveliness that saved me?” Mary asked, tilting her head to the side and regarding the soldier slowly.
He tries it again. Another beep that feels like it’s ricocheting around his skull sounds out. Another red light. Another failed attempt to open the partition. Still trapped.
An elbow connects with his back as the teenager behind him urges him to move along. It’s not the first elbow to connect with his back in the last ten minutes and he’s sure it won’t be the last. He’s beginning to wonder if only the first fifty people seated get to stay in the plane and the rest have to ride on the exterior wings. He mumbles an Enochian profanity taught to him by Cas and shuffles further down the aisle.
He takes a deep breath and steps through the metal detector, his heart hammering in his chest. A second passes before a loud beep escapes the machine. Cas glances over sharply from where he is busily gathering their luggage.
She reaches for a handful of fiery red flowers from a shelf to their right. “Well, I think some of these geraniums would be lovely. They represent friendship and they smell divine! Plus, the dried leaves can be used to make herbal tea!”
Dean rolls his eyes over Harold’s shoulder as he forces as unconvincingly lighthearted laugh from his throat. “He’s joking, obviously. Good one, Cas.” He had actually considered that option multiple times on the way here but he figures if this flight turns disastrous, he might as well be awake when he dies.
“Well, to myself, I guess. But it helped me, just a tiny bit. Just saying your name. I know it’s dumb, but it felt like an anchor, a weak one, but something. And I needed that, to stop me from slipping under completely.”
His eyes slide closed, the evening sun warming every part of him as he lies on a towel beneath a cloudless sky. A contended smile takes up residence on his face as he digs his feet into the sand for what must be the millionth time. He still can’t believe that this is real. That he’s actually lying on a beach in Honolulu with Cas by his side. And they’re safe. There’s no end of the world, no sacrificing themselves for the greater good, no more goodbyes, no more regrets, no more maybes. He feels for the first time in his life like he can rest, really truly rest. The relief of that is so powerful as the pain and trauma of all those years of sadness slips from his shoulders and melts into the sand that before he can process what’s happening, he suddenly finds himself crying. A steady stream of quiet tears sliding down his cheeks and falling away into the golden sand.
For a second Cas doesn’t answer. For a second, he can’t. There are things he wants to say to Dean. There are things he wants Dean to say to him. Maybe if he just? No. Never mind. He can’t do that.
"And I would love to discuss that with you in detail and listen to whatever terms you'd like to submit for my consideration, but I know you're only doing this to delay us."
The overhead speaker crackles on and Dean jumps in surprise, causing Harold to roll his eyes as he clicks on his seatbelt with ease. The captain runs through the flight path, the weather, and the onboard menu before handing the speaker over to the cabin crew who begin to run through the safety precautions. One of them positions herself at the end of their row and demonstrates the correct way to put on an oxygen mask and lifejacket. Dean can feel his heart beating faster as panic starts to build once more in his stomach. The thought of needing either of those items terrifies him. As if sensing this, Cas turns to him, concern etched into his face. “Dean.”
“Damn it, Dean,” Castiel cannot stop this from being a growl, “don’t you ever talk like that.” Dean makes a bitter noise down the line. “I mean it,” Castiel shakes his head. “You looked after Sam amazingly—I’d—I’d have no idea what to do, in your position.”
“Sammy safe, and happy,” Dean says. Cas sighs with soft affection. “Him settled down—whatever that would look like. For…” He reddens, rubbing the back of his neck, “for nine years, it was apologising to you, maybe even being forgiven. Us being friends again.”
“Whenever you would,” Dean answers, strangely breathless. “I—I know I must be burning you out, demanding so many lessons from you—”
Castiel notes distractedly that he should perhaps write some of this down. He doesn’t want to forget any of his questions for Michael. He wants to know
of, tremblingly, actually believing it. Longing for the lazy mornings, the drift of kisses like snow, the summer air wandering through an open window and ruffling feathery curtains as Dean and Cas chatter happily and slowly, believing they have all the time in the world to be with and celebrate each other, and yet not wanting to miss a moment of it.
Shoulder to shoulder in the hours that follow, they watch the creep of morning strangle the stars with light until the dawn has seeped into day. Dean’s lips are curled, perpetually, in a fine bright line, and it doesn’t matter how many times Claire will tease him for his constant glowing: nothing seems able to stifle it.
“He has told you this?” Castiel asks, his heart twisting awkwardly—though for what reason, he cannot tell. “What did he say?” He sttempts not to sound too interested, although from his tone it is painfully clear how invested he is in Ellen’s answer. “And when?”
“I’m—my name is John, by the way,” he nodded to her. Mary squinted at him, how quickly his tone seemed to have changed.
Alastair’s gaze flashes back to him from the other side of Elowen’s brass bars. His face is riddled by the lines of the cage and Elowen’s dashing, flitting form from perch to perch.
And Samandriel, not getting any of that, not feeling any of that, still asked Cas to stay—not for Dean, not for Jimmy, not for his home here in Kansas, Samandriel asked Castiel to stay for
“I know, Adam,” Dean says. He swallows. He clenches and unclenches his hands in and out of fists, nervous for what’s coming next. “You didn’t—you didn’t do anything wrong. I just wished you would’ve knocked.”
a storm is swirling in his irises, they are bright and horrible and penetrating, and Dean senses he’s touched upon a raw nerve. He doesn’t back down, though.
Finally, the Angel turns to Dean, expression strange and mystically unreadable, looking at Dean in a way that makes Dean’s insides churn.
“Just so,” the shepherd smiles encouragingly. He says this often, Dean has learnt—whenever he teaches Dean something, and Dean mimics or executes it correctly, this will be the gentle response of the farmer.
before—and that is what terrifies and breaks him. “It must have overwhelmed him. He bade me leave him. Told me he could not continue living in such a manner… moving from town to town, in fear. And risk being stoned to death, if seen. And when I said I could not leave him, that I loved him, he said I was a plaything, little more. That he’d not loved me as I had, him. He told me to leave again. Once more I begged him to let me stay—stay with him. And a third time,” Castiel relates, eyes shining in the candlelight, “he told me to leave and not return to him. And…” the shepherd pauses, looks down at the table, “and so I did.”
They both slip and fall, obviously, into the stream, and yell—Dean the loudest, of course—and he pushes and pulls Castiel back down as he attempts to get up in the knee-high water, and the water spills into his mouth and he spits at Dean as Dean shrieks laughter and Castiel feels young, so young again, and Dean looks it, his shoulders are no longer slumped and slumping, he’s no longer burdened; he beams and is childish and childlike and joyful in the way he deserves to be, to be able to be.
When Dean wakes up, the white-fog of yesterday has dissipated. The sun is bright for the hour and the time of year: waters shimmer turquoise on the horizon under the orange glow of dawn. Gulls sound on the air with their indignant cries, bobbing in and out of view from among the cliffs. Dean huffs to himself—Bobby doesn’t keep any gulls in the house, at least. Even
“Hello, Prince Dean,” Michael greets. Dean wants to take a step back instead of shaking the Angel’s hand, but he refrains.
“Not angel, anymore,” Castiel points out. Dean’s lips twitch. His thumb grazes the ridge of Castiel’s cheekbone a moment, before he removes his hand.
By dinner time, it feels like he and the Angel have barely spent any time together, and this isn’t anything like what Dean had imagined—or, more appropriately,
Is this it? Whatever Dean does, now, he’s doomed to hate himself: he could come out to Cas, tell him how he feels, and be scratched raw every day by the hateful things he was taught all through his youth. He could tell Cas how he feels, and Cas would stay, and so, to scratch at Dean even more until the scratches became burns, Dean would know that it was he who had crushed Cas’s dream out of nothing but selfish desire. Cas would grow to hate him; the seed of sacrifice would grow and sour into something poisonous, would bear bitter fruit as Cas realised how unworthy Dean was of his time, his love, his martyrdom. Sacrifice would spawn resentment and maybe even hate. How could Dean live with Cas hating him, with his best friend considering him a burden?
“Thank you…” He murmurs, looking down, as Dean lets his hand fall and makes his way to the Impala. “It—you’re so kind, Dean—”
he stammers. Much of what he had always suspected has turned out to be true—but so many things have only just been revealed to him; they form a swirling fog in his mind that he finds it impossible to sift through—so many nuances in the way that Michael phrased things mean that Castiel suspects there is still
, standing on the steps leading up to the huge main doors of the castle, and the Angel has forgotten how to breathe.
“Maybe,” Dean says. But his jaw is locked. How could he begin to unclamp it? The truth is a seed which is planted in earthen clay, and trusted to grow something worthy of the pain of parting with it. Truth and trust. They’re hand in hand. If Dean could trust anyone with it, now, it’d be his asshole little brother. He finishes his drink. He looks down at the table. Still, Sam says nothing.
“No,” Castiel shakes his head quickly, then corrects himself. “Well, I saw his car outside his mom’s house, but—”
The whole thing goes on a bit too long, though. Or at least Dean feels like it does. He’s not used to being in this house without Cas. He got used to it for nine years—and then suddenly, Cas was back inhabiting it and they were slowly rebuilding themselves around, inside these walls. Now he’s here without Cas, without Jimmy, and a few drinks in. He can’t help but feel a little sad. He pulls out his phone and sends the arbitrary
they had thought to, they were at war, or risk of attack, and it was deemed too much of a liability. Also, flight is not nearly so simple as you think: you must to know of where you’re going, more often than not—flying aimlessly is hardly advised. It would be like walking through a pirate town in gold clothing—and an unfamiliar pirate town, at that. Stupid. Inviting attack. And without knowledge of your destination, flight would lack direction.” He sighs. “It’s complicated, I worry I’m not explaining it nearly well enough, and half of this is only speculative, anyway. But there you go.”
When beewatcher had mentioned their cat Dean’s mind had begun spinning and he couldn’t help but wonder where in Kansas they lived. Surely it was a coincidence? There were probably many people who took in their friends pets but to hear the same story twice in one week was weird.
“You could stay here,” he blurted out. Cas’s eyes widened slightly and Dean winced as his mind caught up with what he’d said. “Not like that,” he insisted quickly. “I just meant to sleep.”
“Hello!” he called to a woman walking her dog. She smiled down at Jack but continued without saying anything. For a moment Dean worried that this would upset the boy but found that he was mistaken. Instead, Jack chose to run towards a patch of weeds that were growing along the sidewalk and start picking their flowers.
Their bio gave nothing more away. It simply stated that CBee was a coffee addicted grad student who was doing a book count for the year. Because of course they were.
“That needs to be fixed,” Charlie said. She was still staring up at the ceiling in horror while Stevie, attempting not to laugh, patted her shoulder consolingly.
Scowling once more, Dean set to work cleaning the kitchen again. He upended every drawer and cupboard, cleaned them all out and reorganized the few cookbooks he had, first in alphabetical order by title, then by authors name, then by colors. He finally settled on height order before turning around and washing every baking utensil they owned.
He pasted on a smile that he doubted would do much to allay Cas’s concern. He grabbed his jacket from where he’d thrown it over the back of the couch at some point and patted down his pockets to ensure he had everything else.
The fruit from the Tree of Life lay where he had dropped them, scattered along the floor of the new set up in the bunker. Dean and Sam had both headed for the kitchen after they’d returned but Cas had come back to this room to collect the bag. He’d forgotten all about it in the excitement of the day, along with all the worries about what was to come.
Along with their anti-fiery goat post they had also posted cat pictures, guidelines on how to help bees and nerdy jokes that were beyond even Dean.
“Have a good Christmas, young man,” the elderly woman said to him with a smile. Her husband nodded his curly gray head at Dean as he went passed.
“Well, we’re not that close,” Sam admitted. “I mean, I chat with him in the hall and I wouldn’t say no to hanging out with him more.”
“I’ll give you something...to do,” Dean’s muttered threat trailed off into nonexistence as he glared at his brothers retreating back.
Cas put Jack down and Dean reached back to shut the door behind him. He stood there awkwardly for a moment and watched in surprise as Jack came over to sniff his shoes.
So instead of putting his phone away he instead brought up the beewatcher’s twitter page. CBee (and what a stupid name was that?) hadn’t made another comment concerning the Gavle Goat but that didn’t deter Dean.
“No,” he said slowly. “You called me…” he hesitated, wanting Cas to fill in the blank for him instead of Dean having to actually say it but after a long pause he gave in. “…sweetheart.”
“Hey Cas,” he said as the door swung open, his heart racing in his chest and a wide smile stretching across his face. Cas’s hair was windswept like normal and Dean’s fingers itched to run through it. Thankfully, he was distracted from such thoughts when, instead of Cas, a voice from around the vicinity of Dean’s knee greeted him.
“Yeah, get this one home,” he nodded to Gertie, who was looking rather tired and cranky. One look at her daughter dissuaded Bess from arguing any further and she left the office as Dean thumbed open his phone and scrolled until he reached Dr. Badass. Ash picked up after a few rings and, after Dean promised him a round of PBR, agreed to come and check it out.
He’d woken up from dreams involving a pair of dark blue eyes and chapped pink lips that had left his boxers strained and his chest aching. Dean cursed himself and swore to ignore what he’d been dreaming of and forced himself up and into the shower. His hopes of a relaxing shower were quickly dashed when he lingered too long and had to run out the door, yelling a brief goodbye to Sam who was calmly eating his breakfast. An accident on the road made him even later, and by the time he reached the garage the workday had already begun.
“First round’s on us,” Ellen said, bringing three bottles over to them. She leaned against the table and looked over the scene with amusement while Sam thanked her.
“You’ve played before,” he said as he rounded the table to join a still smiling Cas. To his surprise Cas shook his head.
“Cake time,” he announced and Charlie settled in to watch as Dean began pulling out the various ingredients.
“Not as good as mine,” he responded without thinking. It was only when Cas looked at him curiously that Dean realized what he’d said.
“Don’t you dare,” Sam warned, just a second too late as the cushion left Dean’s hand and sailed across the room and into Sam’s face.
Castiel smiled at Dean’s slight verbal stumble but Jack appeared completely unaware as he followed them to the hallway once more. That smile fell from Castiel’s face much to Dean’s disappointment as they looked out at all the remaining boxes.
“Cas,” he gasped, reaching out to run his hands down Cas’s arms. Cas’s hand fell against Dean’s hip and Dean felt his resolve weaken. “Me too,” he forced out, even as his gaze caught on Cas’s lips. They had reddened under Dean’s attention, and he longed to taste them again.
“You’re forgiven,” he said slyly. “And I’m sorry for trying to lure you out of your non-existent closet.”
Cassie — or Cas, Dean really needed to ask — quickly ducked out the back. Dean lingered awkwardly, no longer knowing what to do. He checked his phone and saw he only had fifteen minutes of his break left.
That was the first night he’d found himself with his arms around Cas who shook for the first few minutes before he just slumped against Dean’s chest. It had happened a few times since; brief and broken conversations full of horrifying images, of fire and needles and sharp teeth.
“It’s just me, Dean,” he said softly, as though he was unwilling to speak too loudly in the otherwise quiet room. The television was now off and the room was dark Dean realised and before he could ask Cas was already answering his questions.
“Thanks, sweetheart,” he said smiling at her when she presented it to him with a bright grin. He stuck the drawing to the noticeboard, much to Gertie’s delight and Bess’s amusement.
“I want the flowers,” he said, waving the bunch that were in his hand up at Dean. Dean could hear Sam laughing behind him, but he refused to look around. A little help would have been appreciated but nope, Sam seemed happy to leave Dean to suffer instead.
“I wanted to thank you, Dean,” Kelly said and he looked up wildly. “For looking out for Cas. He didn’t say it but he was worried about moving out here. I’m glad he met you,” she smiled up at Dean. “He’s been a lot happier.”
‘We’re getting a sofa,’ he said and Dean nodded as he reached out for Cas who went willingly. A quick kiss and then Dean pulled back to rest his forehead against Cas’s.
“Thanks for the heads up,” he said. “You guys good?” he asked, nodding towards Gertie who had returned to her game.
Sudden movement from Charlie’s bedroom caught Dean’s attention and he forced himself upright and into the kitchen. Breakfast was the least he could do for letting him crash on the couch. Soon enough he had the coffee pot on and bacon sizzling on the stove. He finished cracking open eggs into a bowl that he had pushed to the side before he reached for his phone again.
There were a couple of Sam’s friends from college, including Maggie and a short, tired-looking boy named Kevin who had sassed Dean back when Dean had questioned his age. Benny and Ash were chatting with Donna who was, as usual, bright and bubbly, as Bobby rolled into the pub to much cheering.
Cas hummed thoughtfully as Dean moved to the kitchen. He pulled several takeaway menus off the fridge, which he spread out on the bench for Cas to look through. In the end they, or rather Jack, chose Chinese, and Dean quickly rang through their order while Cas went to turn on the television.
“We’d better keep going,” he said quickly. Thankfully, Cas didn’t say anything as Jack continued to lead them to the park. Instead, he looked around at the neighborhood with interest even when the nosy-neighborhood watch lady stood up from her front porch bench and glared at them.
‘Cas? What…’ he trailed off, his voice tight and Cas looked up at him, his fingers still brushing against the silky fabric before they slipped away. They were standing closer together now, or at least that’s how it felt to Cas. The room felt smaller and Cas could feel his elbow pressed against Dean’s arm.
“A job offer,” the man explained, a small twist to his lips as if he knew exactly what Dean had been thinking. His eyes crinkled at the corners and his already handsome face almost seemed to light up in his amusement. Dean felt his own mouth twist upward into a sheepish smile. It was then that Dean realized he still didn’t know his new neighbor’s name.
He knew Jo hadn’t really meant to piss him off, but her words still rang loudly in his head. His decision to leave almost eight years ago hadn’t been well received by many people. Sam, Bobby and Jody were the only ones who didn’t seem to hold it against him. In fact, he could clearly remember Jody and Bobby sitting him down and insisting he go. Jo had been one of the ones who hadn’t understood. He hadn’t spoken to her until her twenty-first birthday, when Sam had forced them to talk to one another, and things still got tense whenever it was brought up. She wasn’t alone in her anger, he knew. There was a reason he’d never come back in the summers, and out of all his high school friends Jo and Ash were the only ones that still spoke to him.
“Everything alright?” he asked and Cassie looked up. Instead of his customary smile he sighed and dried his hand on a nearby towel.
“You what?” he said, loudly enough for Dean to hear over the chatter of the room. Dean frowned, throwing back the last of his coffee. He stood up and hesitated, wondering if he should intervene. The barista certainly looked upset, upset enough to swear loudly when the milk frothed over the edge of the tin and onto his hand.
“You sure about that?” Dorothy was smirking which Dean knew from past experience couldn’t mean anything good.
“Yeah, I should be by for coffee,” he said, and Cas smiled and nodded at him. “Now, I better head back to the garage.”
After a soft drink each bought from the counter where Alex smirked at Dean, they used up all the points on their cards and headed for the exit.
Jack’s joy at the thought was at complete odds with Dean’s sudden shock. He pulled back slightly and looked at Cas hoping the other man would deny his son’s claim. To Dean’s disappointment there was a fond look on Cas’s face as he slowly took the photo from Jack’s hands. He held it carefully in his long fingers and looked down at it before he turned back to Jack.
“Uh huh.” Dean looked away from Cas and glanced outside where the morning sun was steadily shining down upon the walkway. “Yeah, and I’d like to see you, too.”
The weekend and seemed to drag and Dean had been left trapped in his apartment with the weather turning colder and wilder. The wind alone had convinced Dean that his couch was a better place to be than anywhere outdoors, no matter what Sam had said. But even Dr Sexy M.D. hadn’t been enough to keep him distracted. In fact, the sexy doctor had been mostly background noise as Dean had alternated between staring at his twitter notifications and attempting to brainstorm presents for his friends and brother.
The door to the café opened, allowing a gust of chilly air to enter the room. Dean watched as several patrons grumbled and cast scowls at the young man who entered. He was wearing a thick coat over a vee-necked sweater. He sauntered over to the coffee machine where he leaned over to talk to the barista. The barista froze and turned to stare at the other man, a growing look of horror on his face. In his hands was a tin in which he was steaming milk that he had apparently forgotten about.
“Don’t worry, I let my boss know but he’s like family. He’ll let me off. Worse I’ll get is having to clean something truly gross later.”
That night Dean hesitated, his finger hovering over the twitter notification. After the phone’s screen going dark four times he shook his head and forced himself to press down. As soon as he read what the post said he laughed and fell back on his bed.
After a brief round of begging and half-hearted reluctance, Jack dragged them into the bakery. Dean took a deep breath of warm, sugary air before following Jack to the display window.
“Still, if there is anything I can do for you,” he offered. Dean opened his mouth, ready to tell Cas that that wasn’t necessary when Sam suddenly cut in.
“Hey guys, looking good in here,” he said as he came into the kitchen for a glass of water and eyed the cake in the oven. Dean grimaced at the sight of his sweaty brother which Sam chose to ignore as Charlie pounced.
“Yeah, uh, so did I, Cas,” Dean admitted. He knew Cas was smiling at him, but he could barely bring himself to meet his eye. The feeling of Cas’s hand resting on his shoulder still burned.
All of this led to Dean waking on Saturday morning, his head still aching, and feeling as though he hadn’t slept at all.
Instead of waiting around he decided to make himself a full breakfast complete with crispy bacon before he dived into housework. While waiting for his second pot of coffee to finish he put a load of washing on, humming Metallica under his breath. He poured himself another mug and began scrubbing down the kitchen just as Sam woke up. He cast Dean a questioning look but didn’t ask as he left the apartment for his morning run. By the time he was back Dean had moved onto vacuuming the whole apartment. When he was done, he returned to the kitchen and found Sam drinking a disgusting green smoothie, the remnants of which could be found in the blender laying on the bench.
The bakery was only a block away from their apartment, which was lucky as it was difficult to hold onto Jack for even that long. He seemed eager to follow every bug that crossed their path and greet everyone he saw.
“Can I ask you something?” Cas suddenly asked. Dean put his mug down and nodded, overcome with nerves once more. “Why did you leave so suddenly the other day? I know you had work but you ran out like you were scared.”
“Dean. I’m Dean,” he explained, just catching the mug before it hit the counter. He looked up to see the barista staring at him. His smile seemed to have slipped for a moment but when he responded, his voice was as warm as ever.
“Well,” Cas began and he could only be described as defensive now, with his shoulders hunched and a frown on his face. “You said it first, I thought I should reciprocate tonight.”
“Dude, I already said it’s cool. We’ll be good, right Jack?” he turned to the young boy who was bouncing eagerly beside Cas.
“All good, brother?” Benny asked quietly as everyone began to descend upon the pizza. Dean glanced over at Benny, who was frowning at him in clear concern which Dean hastened to wipe away.
Despite their early start on the road and only a brief lunch break, it wasn’t until late evening that the Impala came to a halt in the garage. Stiffened by sitting so long in the car, Dean climbed out of Baby and wearily accepted the bag Sam passed him. A quick glance told him Cas, while still quiet, appeared even more tired than he had at lunch when he had come close to face planting into his burger.
Dean reached out and snagged the plate off of the coffee table before moving to stand. He remembered belatedly that Jack was using him as a pillow, but thankfully the kid seemed to be a heavy sleeper. Cas reached out and gently lifted the boy into his lap so Dean could get to his feet. He didn’t look at Cas again, but instead dumped the plates on the kitchen bench and shut off the television. He grabbed the remaining apple pie and took it into the kitchen where he cut off a generous piece and packed it away into a Tupperware container.
Dean stopped at the bedroom next to his and opened it without thinking, dropping Cas’s bag on the floor before turning to face the former angel who was standing in the doorway watching him.
“What’re you doin?” he mumbled and Cas smiled at him. Dean’s stomach suddenly didn’t feel as if it were in the right place but he was too tired to think too hard about how his organs were jumping around inside of him.
The flush had darkened on his cheeks and Dean felt his own embarrassment melt away. Instead, he found himself smiling and rolling up his sleeves, his previous exhaustion forgotten in the face of this kind-of sweet and most definitely hot man.
Dean rolled his eyes and, before he could talk himself out of it, clicked on the person’s profile. He snorted when he read their handle; @beewatcher. Their name was just as cheesy, announcing the person to be called CBee, complete with a bee emoji.
“Thanks,” Sam scowled down at the phone. He only looked away when Jack waved a piece of paper in his direction. “What’s this?”
He poured himself a mug of coffee and watched as his tweet loaded. He glanced back at beewatcher’s post and his scowl deepened. Before he could talk himself out of it, he’d already opened a new post.
“I should go. It was nice meeting you.” She nodded to them all, smiling a bit at Sam before she headed off towards the staircase. Dean raised both of his eyebrows as he turned back to his brother who was openly grimacing now.
“Is something wrong?” the barista asked, in that rough voice and Dean shook his head, his cheeks burning. He glanced back at the barista whose head was tilted in confusion as he stared at Dean.
Cas waved before he stepped out into the hallway and shut the door behind him. Dean stared at the door before he returned to the kitchen to finish cleaning everything up. After a few minutes he could hear voices in the hall and even through the door he could recognize the low timbre of Cas’s voice. He listened until he heard Cas’s door shut, and he shut his eyes.
“I’ll be back later,” he said quietly. Dean knew he shouldn’t have been listening, but he found himself unable to look away as Cas adjusted Jack’s jacket and hugged him. “Be good for Dean and Sam,” he said, brushing a kiss against Jack’s forehead before he pushed himself upright. He rummaged in his trench coat’s pocket for a moment before pulling out a scrap piece of paper. Sam passed him a pen and Cas scrawled something down on it before passing the paper and pen back to Sam.
Dean wrapped up work and rushed out of the garage as quickly as he could. Bess had waved at him with a rather startled look on her face but he trusted her to lock up after herself. Once he’d reached his apartment he found a note from Sam on the kitchen bench, instructing him to have fun and not to bother about waiting up. Apparently, he was staying the night at a friend’s house. Dean smirked as he thought of the brunette Sam had been studying with last weekend before the realization that he and Cas would be here alone without an impending interrupting moose on the horizon hit him. His stomach swooped at the thought.
“Oh, yeah,” Dean huffed out a laugh. “Technically this was the first one but there are three prequels.”
Before he could say anything to catch the guy’s attention the door leading out onto the street opened and a large flock of middle-aged women entered the shop, each with shopping bags in their hands, the victorious remains of a successful Christmas shopping spree. Dean was forced to take a step back as the swarmed towards the counter. He glanced over at the barista but realised his chance was gone and instead turned to find a table tucked away at the back and hide.
It was a twitter notification about the upcoming Dr Sexy M.D. episode and after reading it and liking it he put his phone away. Or rather, that’s he should have done.
“It’s not dumb,” Dean half-heartedly argued. His gaze was now fixed determinedly on his plate as Dorothy plucked Charlie’s phone from her grasp and started scrolling.
“All good, man. I better be going, then,” he said. He was sure Cas seemed disappointed at this statement, but Dean knew if he stayed any longer, any fondness Bobby held for Dean may not be enough to excuse him for his lateness.
“You mean after she tricked me into thinking she couldn't bake? Yeah.” Cas smiled, and Dean finally felt himself relax completely for the first time since Kelly had knocked on his door earlier.
“Gabriel?” Cas smiled ruefully. “He left the family a few years ago. I fell out of contact when he did as I was still living at home. I haven’t heard from him since.”
“You too, Cas.” Dean opened the apartment door and helped Cas into his own where, for a moment, Cas lingered. He eyed Dean before Dean hastily waved goodnight, which instantly made him feel foolish, and hurried back to his now empty apartment. With a resigned sigh he set about clearing up the remains of dinner, while his mind remained firmly in the doorway of apartment 15.
Cas didn’t speak at first. Dean looked up and was startled to see tears in his eyes. He opened his mouth to apologise, but was cut off when Cas moved suddenly. He pulled his hand away from Dean’s, leaving Dean feeling as though someone had kicked him in the stomach. But Cas surprised him once more by tugging free Dean’s almost finished mug of tea and placing it and his own mug on the coffee table before turning back to Dean. He took hold of both of Dean’s hands with his own and squeezed. Their fingers were warm from holding onto the mugs of tea, and Dean felt his cheeks flush as his stomach lurched once more.
“Hey, Jack, c’mon leave those,” Dean said, trying to gently pull the boy away even as he checked the ground for thorns and bees that would sting the kid.
He lay awake half the night staring at his ceiling, feeling jittery and on edge as he thought of what was coming upon waking. When he did finally drift off, he had confusing dreams involving Jack and Sam playing a game of catch which Dean was forced to watch helplessly from the sidelines. On the other side of them was Cas, who would catch Dean’s eye and smile at him distantly. Beside him was a pretty brunette, holding Cas’s hand.
The door was pushed open again and Dean looked over, his heart leaping as it had all afternoon, but he was once again let down as he saw Jody and Alex come through the door. Jody was on the phone, an exasperated look on her face, and Dean would have bet good money that it was her second adopted daughter, Claire, on the other end. Alex caught his eye and raised an eyebrow as he lifted his beer in greeting. Jody caught sight of him and waved, and Dean felt a wave of wariness wash over him. He had yet to accept Jody’s latest dinner offer due to the teasing he would have to endure but he now found himself regretting that decision as a steely look of determination stole over Jody’s face as she made her way across the diner to him.
They pulled apart for a brief moment and stared at each other, both breathing heavily before they leaned in again. Desperation left Dean’s blood boiling, and his tongue snuck out to trace the shape of Cas’s bottom lip. Cas gasped, and Dean didn’t hesitate in sliding in his tongue. He pulled himself closer and Cas fell back against the armrest. Dean stared down at Cas in shock. His heart was racing as he met Cas’s eyes. They were darker than Dean had ever seen them and his stomach twisted with heat.
“So,” Dean said after a long silence where they stood there staring at one another, smiles slowly growing on their faces.
“Ah, yes?” Dean winced when his voice rose at the end, twisting his answer into a question. The barista raised an eyebrow but mercifully didn’t say anything. Instead he placed the plate down next to Dean’s coffee.
Having decided that it was just too cold to stay at the garage, Dean left and hurried down the road to the nearby coffee shop. He tended to stop in here and grab a takeaway coffee most of the time but had yet to actually stay in to eat. That, he decided, was going to change today.
“We can lend them to you,” Sam said as he turned back to the group. Dean however, shook his head vehemently.
"You called me Cas.” His voice was blunt, and Dean winced, unable to tell if this was a problem or not.
He quickly changed into his coveralls and went back out into the office, making for the garage itself.
“C’mon,” he said quietly and led them to the counter, where a bored looking teenage girl was flicking through a biology textbook. She looked up as they approached, and a wry smile lit up her face.
By six thirty he had confirmed Dean’s worst fears but had at least managed to get the computer started long enough for Dean to print out the day’s reports and the schedule for the rest of the week.
“I’m really sorry, Cassie,” the other man was saying and the barista — Cassie apparently — quickly put down the tin. The Italian waitress shooed him away and took over the coffees as he rinsed his hand.
They waved them off and all was silent in the flat for a long stretched out moment before Dean slowly turned to his brother. Sam looked rather smug as he smiled down at Dean before going into the kitchen, a definite swagger to his walk.
The end of the movie came around quickly after that and it was only as the credits began to roll that Dean remembered the apple pie.
Dean looked over at Cas who was still smiling at him. Jack was still asleep, his head resting against Cas’s shoulder.
He gestured for Cas and Jack to enter the arcade, rummaging in his pocket for his wallet with his free hand as they went. Jack’s eyes were wide, and his head swiveled around as he tried to take in all the bright lights and noises at once. Cas also looked around curiously and Dean couldn’t help but laugh at how alike they looked in that moment. Cas looked over at him, wonder still in his eyes, and Dean
The Italian waitress took his order and he glanced over at the coffee machine as he was walking away. The red head was at the counter, collecting two tall mugs from the barista and when she saw Dean she smiled. She said something to the barista who looked up and flashed a grin at Dean before turning back to his work.
Five minutes later Dean was seated at a quiet table in the corner sipping on his black coffee and scrolling through twitter. People had been making estimates all morning and he smiled when he saw the original post. It hadn’t even been a complete photo, but it already had over 1000 likes.
“Nothing. I just — I gotta go.” Dean got to his feet and almost knocked the barista over in his hurry to get out of the café. He threw the door open and stumbled back into the cold, the door shutting loudly behind him. He shoved his hands into his pockets and began walking back to the garage. Despite the cold he could still feel his cheeks burning.
Dean looked over to see Castiel had hung up and was now looking over at him with concern on his face. His head was cocked to the side again. Dean looked over at Jack, who smiled at him, and Dean smiled back. Pleased, the boy ran over to his father’s side and started vying for his attention by reaching out and tugging on Castiel’s shirt. Dean could see what looked like a college logo printed in cracked letters on the front.
He waited patiently as the queue slowly inched forward, humming under his breath. Ever since last night he’d had Wham stuck in his head and no matter what he’d listened to in-between, his mind kept circling back to it.
The lunch rush had passed by the time they got to the Roadhouse and Jo hailed them from the bar. Ellen raised an eyebrow when she saw the bags of party decorations that they were carrying, and it was with a weary sigh that she waved them towards the corner that she’d set aside from them.
He didn’t bother to answer Sam and instead focused on drinking his coffee, clearly not bothered by the scalding liquid as he downed half of it in only a couple of mouthfuls. Dean went slower and by the time Dean was a third of the way through his coffee Cas had finished his, refused any food Sam offered and had left the room to take a shower.
. Dean snorted. How corny could they get? He flashed a smile at the waitress as she placed his turkey sandwich on the table. He watched as she walked away, distracted for a moment by her bright red hair which swayed behind her as she moved before he returned his attention to his phone.
“I think that’s our sign,” he said quietly and Dean nodded. Cas pulled his hand free of Dean’s and, before Dean could complain, wrapped his arm around Dean’s waist instead. Dean curled in closer, his cheek resting against Cas’s shoulder and soon he found his eyelids slipping shut.
He went through the motions of getting ready for bed but once he was under the blanket he felt wide awake. Cas’s words ran circles around his mind and he found himself tossing and turning for the better part of an hour before he gave up. Cas had said that Dean had said that first but he had no recollection of it. Dean frowned up at his ceiling in the dark and strained his mind, hoping something would come to him. He still couldn’t remember if he’d said anything but he suddenly remembered how Cas had acted all day, how weird he had been when Dean had woken up. Dean abruptly sat up in bed and threw the blanket off him. He needed answers.
Cas guided him off the footpath then and Dean found himself standing in front of an old brick apartment building. It looked to only have four floors and, as Cas had said earlier, an electronic front door. Once they were inside Cas called out quietly.
A gravelly voice caused him to look up and Dean saw, with a jolt in his stomach, the barista was standing by his table with a hand reached out for his plate.
Dean looked down, his cheeks heating up at how earnest Cas sounded. “Thanks,” he said quietly, looking up in time to see Cas smile. After a moment of silence Dean decided to take another risk. “I know you said you weren’t seeing family today, but did you have any other plans?”
“Morning Jack,” he said, and the boy beamed at him. He glanced up and found Cas smiling at him. It wasn’t as bright as it had been the other night, but he was still watching Dean warmly. It was then that Dean remembered Sam who was still standing in the doorway. His brother was looking curiously between Dean and their neighbor and Dean could feel his embarrassment pooling in his cheeks.
One episode turned into two, and before Dean knew it there was a knock on the door. He looked around from where he was slouched down. Jack was curled up next to him, his head resting on Dean’s arm, the paper bag that now held the crumbs from his croissant between them. Dean tried to extricate himself from Jack’s grip without disturbing the kid, but thankfully Sam was up on a break and, seeing Dean’s predicament, answered the door himself.
“Alright,” Sam said loudly and they both turned to look at him. “Have fun guys, see you in a few hours. And Jack, you’re in charge.”
A quiet rustle from behind him caused him to look over his shoulder. He regretted it immediately. Cas was standing there with all the empty pizza boxes in his arms. Behind him Dean could see everyone else clearing out. Charlie caught his eye and waved to him as she and Stevie left. Jo waggled her eyebrows at him and even Benny shot him a smirk.
“Don’t play dumb, boy. You have barely had your lunch break here for the past few weeks and now you’re suddenly desperate to spend your break drinking this crappy coffee?”
“I mean, I watched it when I was his age,” Dean said with a shrug. That seemed to settle whatever concerns Cas may have had, because he gestured for Dean to lead the way. “I wasn’t sure what you wanted to eat. I have a dessert made but nothing for dinner yet.”
“That movie,” Dean repeated while the sound of Charlie clearly knocking her head back against the couch’s poorly stuffed backing could be heard. “It’s only one of the greatest movie
Cas looked as dreadful as Dean felt. His hair, already usually messy, stuck up in odd angles as though Cas had been tossing and turning. His face was pale and the bruises under his eyes looked as though they’d darkened in the hour since Dean had last seen them. The worst part was how Cas watched him though. He appeared wary, as though waiting for Dean to either turn back around or accuse Cas of lying about earlier.
“That’s good, Jack,” he choked out. “Maybe Sam can learn from you.” He watched as Sam forced a smile as Jack beamed up at him.
Dean thought it over all the way to the Roadhouse, but it was only after he’d ordered a round from Jo as well as a bacon cheeseburger that he decided to broach the subject again.
“I did have a good time, Dean,” he said as he stepped closer. His voice seemed to have lowered a bit, and Dean felt his throat tighten. “Thank you for showing us around.”
“Do I wanna know?” Dean asked quietly as they began to check that the car was lined up with the lift. Benny shook his head.
While sitting down with his mediocre coffee, Dean pulled out his phone and compiled a tweet to beewatcher.
“The blanket. Last night, I woke up and you were pulling a blanket over me,” Dean said slowly and Cas stiffened. “Didn’t you?” he asked, turning to look at Cas who was now studiously looking at his bare feet.
The next round saw him, Sam, Cas and Jo fight, though it was quickly derailed as they  learnt that Cas’s claim to never having played a video game before rang true. Between laughing until his sides hurt as Cas attempted to figure out how to aim without blowing himself up and the way Cas leaned in close to Dean to ask questions about the buttons he was required to press and what was the point to all of this, Dean was struggling to focus on the game.
When Dean had taken over the garage, he had quickly learnt that the old set of employees his father had hired were either no longer up to the job or were so difficult to work with that not much work got done anyway. The old receptionist, Martin, had been unwelcoming to new customers, and had been the first one Dean had let go after he got into a yelling match with a pair of twins who had just moved to the area. Bess had been a godsend for the business. With her welcoming personality and nerves of steel, she had helped gain new customers while also putting customers in their place when they became overwhelming without ever coming across as rude. She’d helped Dean rebuild the business, and if she now needed to have her daughter at the office for the day then Dean was only too happy to help out.
“Unfortunately,” Castiel sighed. Dean took one look at the exhaustion on Castiel’s face before he grabbed another box with determination. If they put their backs into it then, hopefully, they’d get it all done before eight.
He opened a new tweet directed at beewatcher and their stupidly cute bee emoji (who needed to many bees in their name anyway?) and quickly typed out a message. He smirked as he hit tweet and then read over it once more.
The apartment was larger than Dean’s own though the layout was similar. They immediately stepped into the living room which had a small area for a dining table off it. A kitchen was tucked away on the right and there were four doors leading off to what Dean assumed were the bathroom, bedrooms, and closet. Despite the pile of boxes that lay behind them in the hallway the apartment already had furniture settled within it. There was a lumpy brown couch in the middle of the living room with a small and slightly scratched coffee table. A round dining table with four chairs stacked next to it was shoved hastily against a wall, and a large box that clearly held a television inside was placed safely out of the way in the living room. There was already a pile of boxes next to the kitchen counter and even more in the living room at the base of several heavy looking bookcases.
He grabbed a beer and, just before the door swung shut again, he grabbed a second one and headed back to where Cas was sitting. Cas looked up at him, his blue eyes wide with concern, and Dean held out the second beer without a word. Cas took it with a silent nod, which Dean returned as Cas pushed the pizza box towards him.
“Around midday. I need to make this and ice it, and Sam’s just headed off for a run so we need to wait for sasquatch.”
“Oh.” The quiet sound of surprise pulled him out of his self-inflicted reprimands. He looked over in time to see a faint blush steal across Castiel’s tanned cheeks as he surveyed the mess surrounding them. “That’s very kind of you but you don’t need to worry.”
“No. My name is Castiel. Baz insists on calling me that inane nickname. Everyone else calls me Cas.”
The lights were off in Dean’s apartment and he cursed as he fumbled for the switch. He’d forgotten that he’d kicked off his work shoes and left them by the door when he’d come home and he tripped over them now in the dark. A moment later light blinded him as he finally found the switch and turned to shut the door behind them. Cas was right behind him and Dean blinked and stumbled backwards when he realised how close they had been. It took him a moment to remember he didn’t need to back away anymore, but by that point he’d already moved and Cas had shut the door and moved towards the couch.
It didn’t occur to him that Cas might have been asleep until after he’d rushed out of his room and knocked on Cas’s door. He waited for a moment, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, wondering if he should just go back to his room and wait until morning when the door opened slowly in front of him.
Cas was silent for a moment as he thought it over, and Dean tried very hard not to react. He knew it was probably the wiser move for Cas to go home, but he couldn’t help but feel cold at the thought of sleeping in an empty bed tonight. Not now that he knew the feeling and warmth of Cas pressed against him. It was something he thought he could become addicted to very quickly.
Dean could feel his cheeks begin to heat and, in an attempt to divert attention from it, he waved Cas and Jack into the apartment. Jack immediately bounded over to the couch while Cas waited for Dean to close the door.
, Dean thought. Clearly, sometime in the last few minutes he’d lost control of his mouth and it was now determined to dig a hole for him to fall into.
What had begun as a simple salt-n-burn in northern Kansas had ended up being two more cases back to back which had left them up in North Dakota and far too exhausted to return to the Bunker the same day they had finally killed the ghoul. Several late nights spent in the local cemeteries before finally catching the bastard had left Dean just wanting to collapse into the nearest bed available. Cas was holding up just a shade better while Sam, the only one who managed to catch any decent sleep since this last case had begun, was sent on a food run while Cas and Dean went straight to the motel. After taking turns in the pathetic excuse for a shower they both crashed on the beds in the main room. Dean flicked the television on though with his already heavy eyelids he doubted he’d stay awake until Sam returned let alone make it through a full episode of whatever shit program was on at this time of night.
For the next week Dean managed to avoid Cas and Jack. He would rush from the staircase (the elevator was still broken) on tiptoes and unlock his apartment door as quietly as he could. He worked so much that it honestly wasn’t that difficult to avoid them during the week, but he’d had to beg Charlie to host game night Tuesday, much to her displeasure, and he was already dreading what favor she would pull out of him in return.
“Let him have his fun,” was all Sam said before he looked back down at his phone. He bit his lip as he read whatever was on his screen before he quickly typed something out. Dean looked down at his watch and decided he’d give Jack another half hour before heading back to the apartment so Sam would have the afternoon to study.
“I’ll see you again?” Cas’s voice rose at the end and he sounded nervous. Dean forced himself to look at him and found Cas with a small, shy smile twisting his lips as he gazed at Dean. Jack was in his arms, his head resting on Cas’s shoulder, but even that very obvious reminder didn’t quell Dean’s desire to kiss Cas.
“Get going, Dean,” Bobby growled at him. Dean spun around to see his boss standing by the coffee pot.
Dean seemed to sway forward, his arm pressing into where Cas’s was wrapped around the bag of fruit and the space between them seemed to shrink further as Cas glanced at Dean’s mouth. The weight of it all was becoming too much, the air heavy with anticipation, the weight of Dean’s eyes on Cas’s lips and the weight of the bag in Cas’s arms, an intrusive reminder of what they should be focusing on, what they needed to be talking about.
Dean chuckled. “I’ve been receiving an education in it.” Cas frowned but Dean just shook his head. “I did enjoy Elton earlier.”
But despite all this, his week seemed to rush by, barely giving him a chance to think on what to eat let alone obsess over his new neighbor. His shifts at the garage seemed to become longer and longer. He could feel his resentment growing each day, and he woke to the sound of his alarm in the morning with a knot of dread in his stomach. His decision to take on the business was steadily growing into one he wished he could take it back, not that he would tell anyone that. Sam would become worried and look at him with those sad puppy eyes and Charlie would start pushing him to make a change that he no longer believed was in sight.
“That’s why you left so quickly,” Cas said, and Dean nodded. He looked over when he heard Cas sigh and was surprised to see a look of relief cross Cas’s face. “I thought you weren’t out and I had pushed too much,” he explained after Dean looked at him curiously, and Dean couldn’t help but feel a burst of affection for Cas who had clearly been worried about scaring Dean.
His eyes snap back to her. “Sorry, I wasn’t talking to you.” He reaches over and tugs the plastic blind up again. “Sorry about that.”
“Finally snapped out of whatever that was,” he gestures between them with an air of disinterest. “Can you let me sit down now?”
Cas holds the tape in his hands like it’s the most precious and expensive diamond in the whole world. No, not a diamond. A diamond would dull and wither in comparison to this. Dean made this. Dean made this for him. He doesn’t even like pop music but he made this for Cas. His hearts swells and aches with the love he feels for him, powerful enough in this moment to make him feel breathless.
Cas’ gaze flicks quickly to Dean and then away, but not before he catches the flash of hurt that crosses his face. “Sam isn’t here, as you’re already aware. I don’t know why you don’t want me to do this, but I’m just trying to help you.”
Dean wants to disagree but he can't. That’s exactly what he’s doing. Dean and airplanes. Airplanes and Dean. They just don't mix. He looks at the glass entry door again and wonders why he agreed to this. Then he looks at Cas, and oh yeah, he knows exactly why.
Dean can feel his smile faltering. He glances towards the door behind him. It would be so easy to turn and make a run for it. He could just forget this whole thing and go home. He shakes his head, trying to knock the thought loose. No. Not now. He has work to do. "I have three questions for you, but I promise I'll be quick.”
She opens the door and nudges him gently on to the street. “You don’t have a choice. Now get going, I’m sure you’re missing him already. And anyway, I have to get home before my own love starts to worry.” She winks at him and shuts the door in his face. Dean stands with bewilderment in one hand and a beautiful bouquet in the other as she clicks the lock and disappears from sight.
“Woah, easy there, Scooby Doo,” Dean’s voice wafts over from the driver’s seat, chased quickly by the sound of his gentle laughter. “Decapitation stains are a bitch to get out of this thing. Trust me, I know.” Without even looking at him, Cas can tell that he’s grinning. Vividly, he can picture the lines marking happy creases beside his eyes and mouth. Cas turns to him, unable to resist seeing it with his own eyes, and knowing as he does, that he will never grow tired of seeing Dean Winchester smile. It’s heartbreakingly rare and breathtakingly beautiful and even now as Dean directs his gaze back to the road, Cas can’t seem to look away.
“Like I was saying, I need to do a quick pat down, then I can let you leave. But don’t worry,” he holds out his left hand and wiggles his ring finger at Dean “I’m a married man.”
Dean rubs a hand across the back of his neck, nodding sheepishly. “Yeah, I wasn’t sure if you’d remember that.”
“Yeah, a little. Don’t worry about me.” Cas shakes his head. Like that could ever be possible. “How’d the case go?”
Cas disappears from view again as the plane starts forward with a lurch that makes his stomach drop. He glances out the window and sees the runaway slowly coming into view as the plane rolls into takeoff position. Panic settling in, he snaps the plastic blind shut. It might be better if he doesn’t have to see them suspended in midair in a giant metal monstrosity. He closes his eyes for a moment, and tries to regulate his breathing before a sharp voice cuts in. “Excuse me, sir?” He opens his eyes to see a blonde woman dressed in a cabin crew uniform and peering into his face, her scarlet lips pulled into a classic customer service smile.
Dean smiles and takes them from her. They smell heavenly. He already knows Cas will love them. “They’re perfect. What else?”
“Can you stop holding hands in my lap now?” Harold demands. Dean loosens his seatbelt with his free hand and leans forward so he can see Cas. He smiles at him and nods once. Cas smiles back and leans towards Harold, tapping his forehead with two fingers before Harold has time to begin to wonder what’s happening. His head rolls back against the headrest and Dean can’t help but laugh as Cas grins back at him.
Dean looks over to where Cas is standing by the entrance doors, exasperated and painfully beautiful in his floral blue shirt and shorts, sunglasses pushed back into his fluffy hair.
“Uh sorry,” he mumbles “is this row 29?” One of the humans' nods but says nothing. Dean can feel a prickle of sweat on his brow as a youthful elbow connects again with his back. “Yeah, hang on a second!” He puts the duffel bag down, its moment of contact with the aisle floor coinciding perfectly with a dramatic sigh from his new enemy. He reaches into his jean pocket and digs out his ticket, scanning it for his row number. “Ah, row 30. I was close.” He flashes a smile to his captive audience who nod blankly in return as he moves on to row 30. Home sweet home. He shoves the duffel in the overhead compartment and squeezes into the row, placing his hands on his knees and trying to relax. Where the hell is Cas? He could really use that dorky dude right now. He glances out the tiny window and feels a drop in the pit of his stomach. They’re already such a long way off the ground and they haven’t even taken off yet.
“You took a stupid risk.” Back and forth Dean paces, his feet following an invisible path on the hardwood floor, his anger rattling through his bones like a second heartbeat.
Dean feels his eyes widen. “What? No! Cas, of course I trust you; I trust you with my life.” He sighs and closes his eyes. “Look, I have my reasons, okay?”
“Uh, not that,” Dean says quickly, his eyes flicking between Cas’ face and the road. Cas feels his hand still as a flicker of doubt flashes through him. Is Dean sick of the mixtape? What about all the highways they flew down, the tape blaring and their voices joined together in pitchy unison? Was he just humoring Cas on the long drives when he would smile and let the tape play all the way through before flipping it over and starting it again. A final, heavy thought settles like a dull stone in the pit of his stomach. Does Dean regret giving him the mixtape?
Cas searches his mind for something else to say, anything that will make Dean laugh again. He screws his eyes shut tight and tries to focus. Bingo! “Hey, uh, there’s something else too.”
Cas blinks at the tiny parcel and then at Dean, whose eyes are suddenly glued to the road in concentration.
“Dean, if you wanted me to, I could knock you out.” Cas raises two fingers in the air as Harold’s head snaps around to stare at him.
Cas feels his heartbeat triple in speed as he looks at Dean and wonders for the millionth time how such kindness rose from the ashes of the sadness and neglect that he was born into. How this hunter who has suffered enough to last a million lifetimes, and who should be cruel and cynical can put his calloused hands to work tying a bow with such care and attention. Cas runs his fingers over the little box as a lump wedges itself firmly in his throat. “I don’t understand. Dean, why-”
He hears Dean let out a short breath on the other side. “Yeah, alright.” He pauses, like he’s deciding what to say next. “Be safe.” Like maybe he doesn’t want to hang up either.
He lifts his watch to his ear and listens. Nothing. It’s evidently picked this ideal moment to stop working, because of course it has.
He looks out the window again, watching the luggage being loaded onto the plane with an alarming lack of care. He’s suddenly glad that their items are all carry on, although he still feels a bit uneasy travelling without weapons. Cas assured him that he would protect him from any danger that might occur on this beach getaway, and honestly, who better for the job than him?
Cas has experienced many days since that night in the barn, but this, right now, is the very best of them.
Agatha steps from behind the counter and gently loops her arm through his. The tenderness of the gesture only makes Dean’s smile grow wider. “I think I might have a few suggestions.” She leads him towards one of the many shelves packed into the cramped shop. Every shade, size, and scent of flower Dean can imagine sit in wait before him.
She shrugs but uncrosses her arms. "I don't work here." Dean raises a questioning brow. "I own the place. Have for the past twenty years."
Dean runs an arm over his eyes, ignoring the strangers staring as they walk past. “I know, Cas. I’ve always known that. I think it’s just taking my mind a second to catch up.” He sits up and gestures at the waves crashing gently against the shore as he intertwines his hand in Cas’. “We’re actually here, angel. Toes in the sand, matching Hawaiian shirts, I even saw a stand selling cocktails in coconut shells. We actually did it.” The words catch in his throat as another wash of tears threatens to unleash itself.
“Dean, would you just let me take one of the bags? That’s the third near collision you’ve caused and we’ve only been here for five minutes.”
Dean stops his frantic pacing, and turns to Cas, his anger locking on to the angel like a missile. “Those risks aren’t for you to take, Cas!” His voice is loud and cruel, a reflection of his father’s. The thought makes him sick. The thought makes him furious. He needs to make Cas listen. He needs to make Cas understand. “You were wrong to put yourself in danger like that and you were selfish to risk your life. Stop being so pigheaded and just admit it!”
He rushed into the foyer and past the front desk where Bess was tapping away at the computer while fielding calls. She passed him a pink post-it note as he rushed by with a wave. Her daughter Gertie was playing with a stuffed wolf behind the desk, and she waved up at him brightly. Dean barely managed to wave to her before he’d reached his office and he threw his bag behind the desk. He glanced down at the note and groaned as he read that Donna had called in sick. Without her they were left with only three mechanics, and any thoughts Dean had entertained about an easy day went out the window.
“Is that what you were doing?” Dean asked with a laugh as he leaned back against the couch. He twisted himself around, resting his side against the couch so he could face Cas more directly. Cas copied his motion and soon they were facing each other, their legs tucked up under themselves as they smiled at one another.
Once they were back, Dean sent Sam off to study and turned the tv on for Jack. He’d managed to find some DVDs pushed to the back of the cabinet that were suitable for kids and, after a moment’s hesitation, he sat down next to the kid to join him as they watched the Mystery Inc gang head into another obviously haunted castle.
“Hey, Jack.” Dean awkwardly patted Jack on the head before the kid pulled away. He looked up and saw Cas smiling at him from the doorway while Sam raised an eyebrow at him.
“Night then,” he said and moved forward, meaning to go around Cas and to his own room but Cas was still standing in the doorway. Dean gave him a look, his eyebrows raised and Cas slowly moved out of the way. He turned as Dean moved around him and for a second Dean considered staying, something feeling different, but he was too tired. It was probably just his imagination anyway.
“C’mon, Dean,” Sam called out to him and Dean shot him a look. His brother had stopped a few paces away and was watching the scene before him with obvious delight. Promising himself that he’d make Sam pay for this, Dean reached up and tucked the flower behind his ear.
But now, as he bent down and picked all the fruit up, he felt as if his shoulders were slumping under the weight once more.
He glanced over at the counter and caught the eye of the red headed waitress. She grinned and winked at him and he smiled at her, watching as she spun away to help an elderly man and his granddaughter find seats.
A few minutes later Anna dropped his coffee off at his table along with a plate of cinnamon cookies and a wink and Dean sat back to enjoy it. The rush died down and he watched as Duma entered the café and shooed Cas away from the coffee machine. He headed out into the kitchen and, a few minutes later, returned without his apron and his lunch in hand. He glanced around and when he spotted Dean still sitting there, Dean pushed out the chair opposite him in clear invitation.
Unable to resist and eager to move away from Cas’s side before he did something monumentally stupid, Dean stepped forward and called out to Sam.
Dean won the next goal and he caught himself about to do his victory dance the second time but forced himself to stay still. Cas’s face fell for a moment as though he were disappointed, but Dean didn’t have time to linger on that as he hit the puck down the table at Dean.
Dean himself was comfortably riding the edge between tipsy and drunk, having been challenged to doubling his last few shots. As such, when he felt his phone buzz he pulled it out and, after a couple of failed attempts, unlocked it.
His hand reached out and latched onto the ascot and tugged Dean closer. He didn’t pull him all the way in, but close enough that he could feel Dean’s quickened breath against his face, could just see the way Dean’s eyes widened before they closed and it was that – seeing those green eyes suddenly hidden from view – that pushed Cas over the edge.
He was just opening his own door when Cas spoke up from his doorway, his voice low but carrying, shaking slightly as his nerves were broadcasted for Dean to hear clearly.
“Oh, come on,” he groaned. He glared at the elevator that had a falsely cheery management sign stuck on one of its doors announcing its sudden and poorly timed breakdown. With a sigh of defeat Dean turned his tired feet towards the stairs and began the long climb.
Looking at Cas’s serious frown right now Dean could just picture him as a kid, messy hair and all, frowning at his brother’s nickname and reading books meant for people much older than he actually was.
It was another forty minutes before Ash and Benny arrived with Ash’s music selection for the party. Dean cast a quick look over the collection, running over the songs chosen with Jack in his mind. He assumed Cas would bring him, and he’d sent Ash a message to choose songs that were friendly for young ears and found that he’d chosen well.
“We better go,” Cas said, and Dean followed him out of the shop. He pulled his phone out and texted Bobby, letting him know he’d be delayed in getting back to the garage. He was sure Bobby would let him get away with it. He’d grumble but ultimately he wouldn’t say too much.
It was a relief to finally reach the fourth floor and he wandered down the hall almost blindly as he struggled to pull his keys out of his pocket. He turned the final corner and swore as his foot caught on something hard and he fell forward. He managed to catch himself against the wall and leaned there, catching his breath for a moment.
“I struggled with Tolstoy, too,” Castiel said. “I find his novellas easier, especially when you’re busy and don’t have much time to read. Which book did you read?”
“I should be getting this one down for a nap,” he said, stepping away from Dean. They stood there for a moment longer, staring at each other, before Dean forced himself to turn away, calling out a quick goodbye before he slammed the apartment door shut behind him. He allowed himself a moment to close his eyes and breathe to try and get himself under control before he looked around the living room.
Despite the sudden shock of the cold air his smile didn’t slip as he thought back to the waiter. Even his frown had been cute. Which was ridiculous. The man hadn’t even spoken and Dean had barely managed to string two words together. It should not have left him feeling as giddy as it had but there was no denying the good mood that kept Dean going all afternoon through the bitter chill that the garage heaters couldn’t quite combat.
“And here comes the best character,” he said, and Jack looked up at him before he looked eagerly at the screen. Dean flashed a smile at Cas who seemed amused by them both.
His fears were confirmed as he reached the door, the cheerful sign on the door announcing the café was shut and wishing everyone a wonderful holiday. Cas had called out to him, probably to let him know as well as to calm him down but Dean had just run out. And with Christmas tomorrow, Dean didn’t doubt that beewatcher would stop with his songs. If Dean was being honest, he had been surprised that he’d received one last night. Relieved but surprised all the same.
“It was my mom who taught me. She wasn’t very good at it, and we always made a mess but I remember… laughing a lot. When she died, that all went away. Dad was never the same, and I had to look after Sam… he was so young when it happened. I didn’t really bake much after that. The only time I really spent in the kitchen was cooking dinner for us.”
“I was so worried about moving here,” Cas admitted quietly while staring intently at Dean. “We’d set up a life in Chicago and had planned everything out according to that. But then I got the job offer here, and Kelly told me to accept it. I thought we were making a mistake. But meeting you here… meeting you has changed everything, Dean.”
Dean had been trying to find a way to fire him for a long time, but the problem was that, unlike Martin, the guy was good at his job and wanted to be there. He generally walked away from an argument if Dean told him to shut up, but on the rare occasion Dean wasn’t there, then he and Benny typically went off at each other. Just like now.
With their eyes on the clock they rushed to set up the decorations. Between the three of them they managed it in half an hour and when they were done Sam was left shaking his head at Ellen’s raised eyebrow.
“Sure,” he mumbled and threw the remote over to him. His aim was off and Cas only just caught it by his fingertips as it was and he sent Dean a rather lazy attempt at a glare. “You better not be putting on bees or something,” he warned, his eyes already slipping shut again and he listened to the sound of Cas flipping through channels. He almost roused himself enough to glare at Cas when he heard that British animal show presenter’s voice, speaking quietly about some kind of field mouse. He heard Cas’s bed squeak and he lifted his head slightly to see Cas rearranging himself on the bed, the remote abandoned by his side as his tired eyes fixed themselves on the screen. He was stretched out on top of the covers, a soft old tee Dean had lent him when he’d first fallen and a pair of plaid pyjama pants that slipped down his hips as he wriggled into a better position. His exhaustion must have been stronger than he’d believed it to be as Dean could feel his eyes slipping shut. The last thing he was truly conscious of seeing was the thin strip of tanned skin that was now visible above Cas’s pants.
“So is Cas coming?” Charlie asked and just like that, Dean’s peace was shattered. He tensed and shot her a look. A sense of foreboding crept over him when he caught sight of the badly concealed look of interest on her face.
“I like hanging around you, too,” he finally said, and Cas’s resulting beam was almost blinding. The coffee shop door opened and a family entered, the children rushing forward to look into the display cabinet. Cas sighed as the young woman behind the counter hissed at him to come back.
“You’re probably right,” he sighed, and Cas smiled at him sympathetically. Cas sat up and they sorted themselves out, buttoning up shirts and flattening down their hair. Each time they caught one another's eye they smiled reflexively until Dean’s cheeks ached. It was ridiculous, he thought. They were acting like teenagers, but Dean couldn’t deny the way his stomach fluttered every time he saw Cas’s swollen lips curve upward.
“Yeah, Cas,” he said and Cas’s own smile grew. They sat there for a long moment before Cas cleared his throat and stood up to push the blankets further down the bed. He gestured for Dean to climb in and he followed him before turning out the bedside lamp.
“Fine, Dean,” Sam said through gritted teeth. Dean waited but it became clear after a moment that Sam wasn’t going to do any introductions.
“So that’s why you refuse to play Pictionary,” he laughed, ignoring Sam’s glare. He whipped out his phone and took a photo before Sam could snatch the page back.
“Well, that’s gonna change now,” Dean said seriously. “From here on out, you’re gonna get a proper education.”
An hour later found all three of them getting into the Impala and leaving the motels car park, finally on their way home. Cas had barely spoken since he’d come out of the bathroom, merely insisting he was fine before falling silent and ignoring the rest of their questions. Dean found himself glancing at Cas in the rear view mirror every few seconds until he caught Sam watching him and he then stubbornly turned his eyes to the road.
“No problem,” he said. “You know that.” She smiled at him gratefully and Dean gave her a mock salute before he turned to face the garage.
It’s what sober Dean would have done. But this was tipsy, almost-drunk Dean who was far more reckless than sober Dean.
“I’m not vanishing off of the face of the earth,” he said. “I’m going to be coming back in the summer.”
“What?” Dean asked, and normally he would have winced at how light his voice came out, as though all the air had left his lungs just before he spoke but right now he couldn’t care less, not with Cas looking at him, a hint of worry lurking at the edges of his eyes.
The familiar script began scrolling up the screen, and Jack seemed to wiggle in excitement. Dean settled back as he felt himself relax properly for the first time all day. He glanced over at Cas and found himself staring at Cas’s pursed lips as he ate his lo mein. Dean’s cheeks burned and he swallowed through the sudden dryness in his throat as he forced himself to face the television. It was lucky he knew the movie by heart because he missed the entirety of the introduction as he focused his thoughts on innocent thoughts.
“Well after that it was just a matter of physics,” he said, shrugging as though it wasn’t a big deal. Dean could only shake his head as he glanced down at the table and back up at Cas.
“My family didn’t approve of my lifestyle choices either,” he said quietly. Dean didn’t know what to say to that, but Cas seemed to sense his curiosity as he smiled rather awkwardly and squeezed Dean’s hand.
“Well that certainly adds to his charm now, doesn’t it? I mean, nerdy and dreamy?” Dean forced himself to remain steady as he walked into the kitchen and began collecting the ingredients for the icing.
Cas nodded and Dean found himself nodding along. He hadn’t been expecting himself to say all that and now his mouth felt far too dry.
“It usually is,” Cas nodded. “But the school semester finished on Friday so I’m on holidays now and todays an all-hands-on-deck situation.”
“Is this alright?” Cas asked, his voice low and Dean turned to face him, his own lips curling up into a smile.
Dean huffed a quiet laugh. “Yeah, they do come in handy with baking. Cooking can be more forgiving,” he added tentatively, and Cas shrugged.
‘It suits you,’ he said, his voice lower than he’d meant but it caught Dean’s attention, his gaze snapping back to Cas.
Now though, disappointment coursed through him and he reluctantly turned away and returned to the garage.
“Hi Jack,” he repeated, which seemed to delight the boy, who turned around and led the way into the apartment.
“All yours, sweetheart,” she said, lifting up the countertop for him. He ducked behind the bar and into the back after dodging past Jo. The kitchen was empty, so he was unimpeded on his way to the fridge.
Attached to the post was a clip of the talent show from Mean Girls which Dean could only stare at blankly for a long moment. He was distantly aware of Charlie giggling next to him but he was too busy trying to figure out what beewatcher was getting at. Was this a poor attempt at mocking him?
“This one!” he insisted. Dean leaned forward to see what the picture was as Jack turned it around so Cas could see it clearly.
Dean went to say something to calm him but when he opened his mouth he found no words. They merely stood there staring at one another until Cas shifted awkwardly.
“Uh, a little. Don’t really get much time to read,” he admitted before shoving the pizza in. He could feel his cheeks heating up at the admission which was ridiculous. It wasn’t as if he’d admitted to wearing lingerie or anything embarrassing like that. Enjoying reading a book was hardly a call for being ashamed.
“Are you alright, Dean?” Cas asked, his voice low so it wouldn’t carry. Dean shrugged and then sighed, realizing that ignoring Cas wasn’t going to work. Especially not after he’d invited him over for a movie night.
