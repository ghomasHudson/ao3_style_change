Sherlock was just putting a tray to the oven and straightened up when he heard John. “Here,” he said, wiping his hand on the cute apron he was wearing before giving John an envelope.
When he got back, Sherlock had gotten up too, and John found him in the kitchen, tapping away on his phone.
Something for just the two of them. He knew from the past that Sherlock didn't really care for Christmas, but he had also realised the man would sometimes pretend not to care to avoid rejection. After they got together, John had thought Sherlock wouldn't need to do that anymore, but then July happened.
Sherlock raised his eyebrow, trying to figure out what sort of a present would need to be delivered so late. Had John forgotten to get him a gift? No, they’d been preparing for Christmas for weeks, he’s had plenty of time to remember it, hasn’t he? John was pulling out his phone again, looking at it. And then Sherlock opened his mouth, ready about to voice the concern from last few weeks, when the doorbell rang.
“Let’s just go see it, then?” Sherlock cut off John’s ramble, half-amused and half-baffled.
"I made you a Christmas calendar," Sherlock repeated, his voice getting small. "I thought it'd be nice, but I don't know, I've never had one and I don't know if you'd eve-"
“That’s quite… Um, really fucking sexy,” John said calmly, standing up and stepping closer to get a better look. He ran a finger over the waistband before cupping Sherlock’s half hard prick briefly, which earned him a moan from the brunet.
"You need to tell Mycroft to stop bloody spying on us. Or then we have some fucking annoying house elves here."
He did bake another plateful of tiny hearts but the rest of them were regular gingerbreads. Sherlock was still holding the plate when the blond came back, brining tea for them. He looked at Sherlock. “Do you like them?”
Sherlock started fidgeting, now playing with John's fingers with his hand. "We had one, last year. It was the best Christmas I've had and... this year I forgot." He swallowed heavily. John finally got a grasp of the problem.
From the corner of his eye, Sherlock could see John watching him intently and he couldn’t entirely suppress the smirk. He tried to focus on the moves, but he might’ve been a little sloppy towards the end. Mrs. Hudson seemed to notice the glances Sherlock and John exchanged since she only tutted and shook her head instead of giving Sherlock a talk like she usually would when he wasn’t one hundred percent concentrated on his routine.
“I’ll look at them next time,” John promised, grinning. He got up and walked closer, hugging Sherlock from the behind as he packed his bag. “You’re brilliant, you know that? I don’t know why Mrs Hudson didn’t put more glitter on your costume, you deserve to be noticed up there,” he mumbled, hugging his waist and resting his head against Sherlock’s shoulder.
"Okay, this is the last one. Open up."
“Mom tried to get Harry interested in horses, so she could have something to do instead of partying and hanging out every night. It didn’t really catch her interest, but I ended up liking it. I went to the closest stable a few times a week for almost two years before I had to stop when I had no money after starting at uni.”
“Me neither.” Sherlock lifted his hands to John’s back and squeezed slightly. “This place never felt like home before you. Nowhere did, really.” He felt John’s chuckle more than heard it.
John checked out the tree and then spent a while on his computer, clearing his inbox. Sherlock kept fetching new experiment containers from the fridge, clearly not done anytime soon, so John decided to take a walk and then chat with Mrs Hudson for a bit. He ate at Speedy’s with her and when John finally returned to 221b, Sherlock seemed to be done with the experiment project, waiting for John on the sofa.
Suddenly John yanks his weight off the table, pulling him up and holding him up by his shoulders and throat.
"Ah, that's the case," Angelo said and rolled up his sleeves. John could only sit and watch in horror as the man grabbed Sherlock by his coat collar, wrenched him up and out of the restaurant, shouting at him.
John chuckled, finishing the last sandwich and turning to Sherlock. “Just thinking about you, but the real-life version is even better,” he grinned, pecking Sherlock’s lips before reaching for the plate. “Here, let’s eat up before you fall asleep on your feet.”
John pulled the coat on and then frowned. “Wait, where are we going?”
“Mm, we’ve got to make these at home,” John mumbled as he bit into the cupcake. “This is delicious…”
Sherlock places his feet on the floor and sat up properly, and John had to raise his hands to rub at his neck, feeling very awkward. “And, uh, we talked and… Well, it’s only once a week, but it was something like 90 minutes, or... But it wasn’t a bad price and I figured I could -”
"Alright, um... You can turn around now, and take some water," he said, clearing his throat again. When John turned around on the table, Sherlock gave him a glass of water, trying to keep his eyes off of John's half hard erection.
"Turnip. Honeslty John, I said I'd recognise any food. Even your wine choices were obvious."
"Just say yes or no, it's all fine." John pleaded.
“John, you do know why it’s there, right?” Sherlock mumbled, tugging on John’s t-shirt now. “A big bow, right on my bum…”
John smiled fondly and got on his tiptoes to kiss him, his eyes sliding closed. Sherlock kissed back with enthusiasm, which made John pull him closer still. “Mmm, we’re in the dressing room,” he mumbled when they pulled apart, running his hands up Sherlock’s back and resting them on his shoulders.
John did as he was told, and after tapping at his own phone, Sherlock reached to touch his phone with John’s. “Now you have my number, I realised I didn’t have yours after I left yesterday.”
"Yeah, sorry. My name is John Watson; I've just met him. Do you often ask him to help?"
(See the end of the chapter for
John grinned even wider and did as Sherlock told, settling down comfortably and relaxing. After a few seconds, Sherlock seemed to tear his eyes away from John's bum and finally get the CD in the player and a relaxing, quiet music filled the room.
with this, but this one was a rather long chapter, and I had a busy week and...
"Oh, nonsense. Can I help you with anything?"
She opened the door wide and stepped aside to let the men in. Sherlock couldn't help but comply. After all, he'd actually just been waiting for a case, not exactly working on it just yet. He quickly climbed the stairs and unlocked the door to 221B. Swishing in, he quickly shed his coat while John took in the flat. The doctor eyed the stacks of papers and files on the overflowing desk and Sherlock suddenly had the weirdest urge to tidy the place up.
Sherlock stopped short and frowned. "We're on the street John. I don't sleep on the streets."
“Hello, dear. It’s Martha Hudson, from Sherlock’s ballet studio.”
“I thought you came to watch me, not other players,” John teased, poking him on the side with his elbow. “Should I be jealous?”
Sherlock groaned dramatically but helped John take down the dried clothes, even going as far as filling the washing machine with the last pile of laundry while John hung up the already washed items to dry.
The detective was far gone, and when John reached up to suck a small bruise to his throat, Sherlock shouted out breathlessly and rubbed his groin against John's belly briefly before pulling back a bit to look at John.
“John, you do know that one of your new forwards is going to break his knees, don’t you?” Sherlock noted as they were waiting for the bus after John’s rugby practice.
But Vern had an intense obsession with trains, and sometime during the vacation John found himself almost intrigued by all the things the older boy knew about Eurostar and London underground. Verner had even brought a few miniature models with him and his ringtone was the sound of some old steam engine.
John moaned, rolling a condom on himself and lubing it up quickly. “Fuck, you’re the best, Sherlock, I swear to –
Sherlock ran his hand across John's chest, appreciating the view. He hadn't been confident enough to take things very much farther than this, but John seemed to enjoy it all regardless.
“You really think you don’t know those things already?” Sherlock whined at one point, when he started to get bored. “I’m hungry, I thought you intended to ‘feed me up’ like you said when we first met.”
It was just a piece of clothing, he told himself. He knew everyone in the advanced class wore one, he’d stayed behind to sneak a look at the studio after his lesson had ended. Most of them also had soft flowing wrap skirts, and the few masculine figures he’d spotted had been wearing leg warmers and wrap tops for warm-up. The fact that everyone else his age seemed so professional, with their appropriate get-up and all, made him feel inferior somehow.
Sherlock made them some more tea and then they cuddled up on the sofa and continued with Doctor Who until they heard Mrs. Hudson climb up the stairs, already hooting for them.
Aziraphale was making little sounds, trying not to moan aloud. The expression on his face went from the usual initial embarrassment to pure bliss when Crowley started pulling the waistband lower, and he actually shifted his hips a little to help the demon wiggle the trousers and underwear low enough to allow access to his groin.
“Well, no… Definitely not,” John said, putting the card down and turning his attention to the dishes. The food looked delicious, and it clearly wasn’t the usual takeaway they ordered in since it had been delivered in gorgeous pottery and metal dishes with carvings on them.
“I will.”
Or just one word, to be exact. "Hi." He already knew it was most likely a man's handwriting, possibly left-handed. But that was it, there was nothing more one messy word could tell him and he had sworn himself not to get involved or he would probably just die sooner.
The rest of the journey was spent in silence. As was the visit to John's. And the cab ride back. John was getting restless despite the fact that he usually enjoyed having a bit of peace and the silence the men shared was still comfortable. But he didn't still know the man, so John couldn't help feeling unsure. He tried to catch the brunette's eyes on the way back to Baker Street but Sherlock kept staring straight ahead, his hands under his chin again.
After they got home, they ate dinner quickly and then Sherlock told John to shower and dress up. John found a garment bag on their bed when he came out of the shower. He frowned and opened it to reveal a dark grey suit and a natural white dress shirt.
“Oh? Well, they look quite nice, don’t they?” John smiled, wrapping an arm around Sherlock and leaning into him.
"Turnip. Honestly John, I said I'd recognise any food. Even your wine choices were obvious." John could see the eyeroll underneath the blindfold and chuckled. Then he took the final spoon, feeling a shiver of anticipation go down his spine.
“I didn’t mean to get this excited,” he mumbled, feeling almost awkward now that Sherlock was just watching him.
For a moment, John feared Sherlock would run away. The detective was just staring at him, looking completely lost. He kept opening and closing his mouth like he was trying to say something, and John was mildly reminded of the time he'd asked Sherlock to be his best man.
John shook his head, quickly thanking the woman before she left and then looking back at Sherlock.
"Is this okay?" He was already looking throughoutly shagged with a full blush and his hair sticking up.
Sherlock didn’t take it. Instead, he kept tugging on the edge of his cast, looking down at the floor.
I could say that this was an unplanned chapter but then I'd be lying.
John sighed, got up and headed upstairs. He sat on his bed again, considering what to do. He should visit his flat, get the rest of his things moved here. He’d need to clean his gun, and he had only brought so many clothes with him yesterday.
"I want to touch you. And I want you to touch me." Sherlock sounded out of breath and his cheeks turned pink when he answered, but his gaze was steady. "I want this so badly. I want you."
"I - I... I don't, umm... What do you want m-me to say? I mean... I didn't -"
Sherlock shook his head, shrugged and then looked at John. “She’ll give me the audition choreography,” he said quickly, sighing. “It’s not
"Fuck - all right," John grumbled, taking off his coat and then flopping down in one of the chairs. "Now, I want you to get on your hands and knees and come here," he commanded.
Baker Street had been just another flat, not much more than a place to sleep in. At the time, Sherlock hadn’t known what was missing, nowhere just felt like a home. Having Mrs. Hudson around did help though, and Sherlock had been fairly sure he would stay at Baker Street for quite a long time. At least longer than anywhere else.
What he didn't expect was the sudden laughter as Sherlock looked down at him. "You honestly thought I'd tie you up so that I could do what we always do?" Sherlock cooed. "Oh, no. No, I'm going to be rough and tease you right to the brink and keep you there for hours."
well after Afghanistan. He couldn't stomach anything on mornings, but after an explicitly bad nightmare he would usually be too nauseous to eat for the whole day.
The doctor took a quick shower and washed up before walking to the kitchen and finding Sherlock and a bowl of oatmeal waiting for him. He sat down and pulled the dish closer.
Sherlock noticed John's staring and just shook his head slightly. "She's just worried I'm going to destroy the flat." John took another look around the cluttered living room and smirked.
Sherlock did actually shift in his chair, obviously uncomfortable as the answered.
“Mrs Hudson, Lestrade and Mycroft, although Mycroft will just drop Lestrade off and get his present. And then Molly and her fiancée and Mike,” Sherlock listed, shrugging. “It’s not very many people after all, I think.”
At that, the brunette abruptly stood up on the armchair and unceremoniously jumped on the floor, pacing towards the door.
“Okay, face here. Feet together and shoulders back, and just rest your right hand lightly on the barre, like this,” Sherlock said, demonstrating the position. “Your feet are now on the sixth position.”
"I told you," he said firmly, pushing Sherlock back towards the carpet, "keep deducing. The client will be back soon and you'll want to finish before that."
“Boys! Clear up a table, would you dears.” She appeared at the door, carrying a large tray. “I heard you preparing the turkey, and it’s probably ready soon so you’ll have time to set the table for your dinner.”
Then entered John. He seemed to like the colours, the general feeling of the place. As soon as Sherlock saw John claim the red armchair as his, something deep inside him told him it was right, having John there. Slowly, the doctor had also invaded Sherlock’s mind, his life.
Sherlock was standing on the far end of it, smiling and setting up a CD player. "Well, it's up to you, but it'd be easier if you'd be fully nude," he said, trying to sound nonchalant even when John could see the blush on his cheeks and tiny shift of his hips.
They didn't really talk about what happened again, and truthfully the whole situation kept bothering John. Especially when, after a week or so, Sherlock had a nightmare.
He wondered if Sherlock was interested in either. He had said he was “married to his work”, but maybe they just needed to get to know each other. He’d asked John to move in with him the day they met, after all. John was quite sure he would be up for nearly anything Sherlock would want.
Sherlock nearly came already when John pressed the heel of his hand to Sherlock's crotch, moaning against the blond's mouth. John's other hand found its way underneath Sherlock's shirt, just laying on his stomach.
He should’ve known better than to stroll out like he always does, it was freezing. Luckily, being the graceful little shit that he was, he managed to only break one wrist instead of his whole skull. John had to guiltily admit that when he heard the horrifyingly loud crack, his first thought was of the awful boredom sulks. Oh god, the detective was going to be so bored.
Sherlock would huff and turn a few times, but after a while he’d sigh and give John a small smile, wiggling his toes at him.
"You're combining fun and work quite efficiently, you know?" He teased as Sherlock carried a tray filled with two huge cups of cocoa and plateful of the leftover cookies from before. The hedgehog cookies were there too, and John snickered a bit.
survive without me, with your horrid lack of sleeping and eating habits…” he teased.
Sometimes people had words in different language that they didn’t understand. Sometimes, if you were really unfortunate, the font would be so messy you couldn't read it. Or you could be stuck in the endless “I’ve got your words but you haven’t got mine” loop. Some said was all meant to be like destiny, but most just chalked it up to pure chance.
“I’ve danced ballet since I was 7,” Sherlock said, lifting his leg to the barre to stretch it. “I stopped lessons when I turned 18, but I’ve practiced it on my own to keep myself in shape. Maybe not so much during the last years though.”
John stopped as he opened the door and saw the insides of the fridge. No sign of the chopped-up toes, or the suspicious petri dishes. Instead, the fridge smelled faintly of some sort of cleaning product, the shelves and drawers now squeaky clean and filled with fresh, actual groceries.
"Too much?" Sherlock asked, lifting his hands for a second.
"Now get here and snog me."
When John got home, all he could do was make tea and just sit on his bed and stare at the grey wall across the bedsit. This time though, it wasn't just a bored, dulled gaze. For the first time after Afghanistan John was feeling something of an excited anticipation at the thought of visiting Baker Street again.
For as long as John could remember, he had only been truly happy when the grass was green and there was life in the air. When autumn and then winter came, he would hide himself in his room, only coming out when it was time to go to school.
“And…the cabbie. He was- he started driving the wrong way. I didn’t even notice at first ‘cause I was so out of my head. By the time I figured out how to form a sentence, we’d stopped in front of this disgusting house.”
“John,” Sherlock practically whispered, but John didn’t want to hear him right now. He didn’t want to hear the pity or the platitudes or the apologies; he just wanted to leave.
John quickly helped him up and shuffled him away from the crowd.
“You should hear him in class; always correcting the professor, telling if people had been shagging the night before, that sort of thing. So you two are friends now, then?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Stuff it, Tom. Either give me a better dare, or I’m leaving.”
“In my old room, you mean? Yes. Problem?”
“Yeah, no.” John grasped Sherlock’s elbow to help him balance. “I’ll help you to a cab, or did you drive here?”
The four of them went out to dinner, a quaint little restaurant tucked away in a tiny building. They drank wine, Sherlock sulked and pushed his food around with his fork instead of eating it, and they had celebratory cake at the end of the night which Sherlock did in fact eat.
Sherlock only nodded, unsure if John would appreciate any comments just yet.
John couldn’t help the laugh that escaped his lips. “It’s dreadful,” he said.
“M’in here,” John called meekly.
“Nine. Doing swimmingly, John,” Sherlock teased.
“Sherlock,” John breathed. “I don’t feel too good.”
“You're not gonna hurt me, I promise. C'mon,” John assured.
“You can get out of my bedroom,” John repeated, calmer, “and…and possibly bring up some paracetamol?”
“You what?” Sherlock asked, leaning forward with his intrigue.
“We were at a friend’s party,” he went on, “and this dog must’ve been twice my size, but I chased it all around the yard, shouting and yelling and all the people there just watched!”
?” John shot back. He didn’t even have time to react before Sherlock’s hands were on his upper arms, holding him steady.
“I’ll consider it.”
“And no deducing what it is,” John said.
“Can you get him up?” Lestrade asked as he moved in closer and crouched down next to Sherlock.
Still eyeing him warily, John pulled out his notebook and papers and set them in front of him. He looked across the table and scanned the pages of the book Sherlock was currently ensconced in, finding it to be advanced chemistry of some sort.
“I’m here, John. I’m here.”
“Yes, I told him I won’t be taking it. Obviously something about it didn’t sit right with you.”
“Not hungry,” Sherlock said.
“You know what? We’re out of firewood. I’m gonna go get some more. I’ll stay out of your hair, yeah?” John grabbed his coat off the hook and stormed out the door.
Nodding curtly to himself, John shuffled into Sherlock’s bedroom and started taking some pillows from his bed to elevate his ankle on.
“Right, that’s quite enough. Now get to the important bit; how did he make you take the poison?” Sherlock asked.
“Yes, we have what you might call a difficult relationship,” Sherlock said, sarcasm laced in his voice.
with warmth.”
John took a deep breath and closed his eyes, thinking back to the last time he and Sherlock had gotten off together.
John smiled to himself and made his way over. He hadn’t even stepped foot in front of the table before Sherlock was speaking to him.
“Sorry, I’ll stop,” John said, holding up his hands in mock surrender.
“Er…hospital?” John rasped with a dry throat. Sherlock quickly handed him some water.
Sherlock could have sworn that he and John got interrupted almost every single time things would start heating up between them. They would be snogging on the sofa and John would slide his palm underneath Sherlock’s shirt, making his breath hitch in anticipation, and Harry would burst in the door not a second later.
“Um…” John still couldn’t look Sherlock in the eye.
He leaned his head back to rest on Sherock’s shoulder and let out a contented sigh the moment Sherlock’s fingers touched his hair. Sherlock ran his long fingers ever so slowly over John’s scalp, scratching lightly as he went. He started at the top of John’s head and worked his way down, giving him little scratches on the way back up and making pleasant chills trickle down John’s spine.
“As flattered as I am, I would appreciate it if you turned down the level of ogling just a smidge, thanks.” He drawled casually.
He didn’t speak, he just kept his hand on John, feeling him breathe, in and out, entirely unevenly at first, and eventually calming down a bit. He could still feel the shaking, could still see the way John's legs quivered and how his left hand tried desperately to curl back up into a fist.
“Two.”
“Um, thank you.”
“Sherlock.”
“Ah, John. Fell asleep in psychology, did you?”
When a case lands John in the hospital for what seems like the umpteenth time as of late, he and Sherlock have to have a serious talk about the risks of what they do.
“Right, yeah, okay," he mumbled.
Sherlock took John’s smaller hands in his and led him to the sofa where he sat him down gently.
“My bed. You should sleep in there for the first week or so. It’ll be easier on your ankle. Not as many stairs involved.”
John chuckled softly. “Well, thank you for your non-concern, then.”
John sat in his armchair in front of the fire, his chin resting on his fist as he looked absently into the flickering orange flames.
“I’ve tried. Clearly he’s in a lot of pain,” he said, the pang of worry in his chest seeping through his voice.
John had scraped together a makeshift Christmas dinner from a box of pasta, some leftover takeaway, and a bag of frozen vegetables he’d had tucked away in the freezer. Overall it’d been a surprisingly satisfying meal for what it was, and the gingerbread men, although a bit wonky, still tasted just as good.
and I—“
“And if you don’t leave now, I doubt you’ll have one,” Sherlock interrupted.
John closed his eyes tightly and wished for sleep to take him, but it stubbornly refused. Just as he was about to say sod it all and spend the night with a cup of tea and a swig of brandy in front of the telly, he heard the faint beginnings of music coming from the sitting room.
John doesn't want to admit that he might need glasses. This got a little angstier than I thought, but I hope you like it!
“You know, I don't really think I'm very hungry anymore. Excuse me,” John said, eerily calm. He picked himself up and didn’t even bother glancing at Sherlock as he left the table.
“Of course I am. Where would be the fun be if I didn’t?”
“I know, John. I know you have trouble admitting when you have a problem. You’re incredibly stubborn.”
Out of all of John’s symptoms, the one that he couldn’t quite skirt his way around was the difficulty seeing at night.
“Just open it.”
“Hm. My parents just want me to turn into my brother,” Sherlock admitted.
Sherlock shrugged. “Suit yourself.”
“Hm, I’ll give you that, yeah. You’re not going to comment on every aspect of the film as we watch it, are you?”
what the bleeding hell is wrong with you?” He snapped. “No, sorry, never mind, I’m just a little grumpy in the—“
John laughed in the dark.
“Right, yeah,” John murmured.
“Sherlock?” John called. “M’starving, and I’m guessing there’s no takeaway for miles. Any ideas?”
A bit less fluffy than the last chapter, but I hope you enjoyed! As always, thanks so much for reading! ^^
“Come in,” Sherlock said, gesturing John inside.
“No, it’s fine—“
“What do you always tell me?” Sherlock asked again.
“Come on, Sherlock, where’s your Christmas spirit?” John teased as he rifled through the cupboard for the box of tea.
John walked over to join him by the window.
“Yes, fine,” Sherlock murmured.
“John?” he asked, trying not to let the sudden concern seep into his voice.
me? Quit standing there!” Lestrade barked.
“Yeah, m’fine,” John slurred, despite knowing from the throbbing in his head and the ache in his ribs that was making itself known that he was almost definitely not fine.
John laughed under his breath. “Well we can’t have that, can we?”
“I’ll always find you.” Sherlock said, staring right into John’s eyes. “I’ll always find you, John, because you’re always there. Over my shoulder, at my side, right behind me. That’s why I don’t notice when you leave, because I think you’re still there.”
work.” John pointed at him. “I’m going to bed.” He ungraciously got himself up out of his chair and slowly but surely made his way up the steps to his room.
“Oh, please,” Sherlock scoffed. “You can’t handle pure domesticity for more than a week and you know it.”
“Right.” John swallowed thickly. “What a lovely, relaxing holiday, hm?”
John kicked Sherlock’s thigh with his foot the best he could. “Oi, watch it, I’m a big tough rugby player, remember?” He joked, his words slurring together from sleepiness.
Sherlock’s lips were warm and pillowy soft, almost melting under the touch of his own. The two stood in the dimly lit room and exchanged chaste but passionate kisses for some time before breaking apart.
John, still a little unsure of what was going on, complied and brought his legs up to mirror Sherlock’s position.
(See the end of the chapter for
He got up and opened the door slowly to reveal John on the other side, dressed in comfortable clothes and looking freshly showered but donning a sad, worn expression on his face.
Bleary eyed, John sat up in bed and checked his phone. There were two messages from Sherlock. The first one was some sort of audio file, and the second one simply read
“I’ve got a blanket back here, and I know you’re not in shock but it’s usually comforting anyway, and—“
“I’ll let the nurse know you’re awake,” Sherlock said, reaching over to press the call button. “I believe Janice is on call today; the one with the hair who always tries to flirt with you.”
“I know,” Greg repeated, “You feel restless, out of control, yeah?”
“My flatmate, Gavin. Or Graham. No, Gavin, yes,” Sherlock stammered.
“Oh, yeah. Harry’s my sister.”
John let Sherlock have the seat next to the window and slid in next to him.
“Sit like this, facing me,” he said.
“No, you’re not dead, for Christ’s sake. Focus, John! What do you remember?”
“John!” Sherlock shouted in greeting. “Where are you? I’ve got Andrews. He may or may not be conscious. Lestrade’s on his way.”
“God, I don’t even know how many pints I had. Why would I do that? I don’t drink, that’s Harry’s thing—“
“Four,” John said a little louder, his voice starting to come back to him.
“Occasionally, yes. The police in this city are remarkably stupid,” Sherlock said.
“What? How do you know that?”
“That’s no excuse,” John argued.
John’s mum had said that John needed the sleep so he could feel better again, but Sherlock knew loads more ways to make John feel better than this silly bed rest thing.
John groaned in frustration, wishing that Sherlock would actually look at him instead of subtly trying to inch ahead of him.
“It might alleviate the occasional urge to set the nearest objects on fire, yes.”
John could remember the first time he’d had a nightmare while sleeping next to Sherlock. He’d woken up with a short gasp, dreading the restlessness that followed, but then he saw Sherlock’s sleeping form resting so close and was immediately calmed. It was as if all the paranoia and fear just melted away and he drifted back into sleep with unprecedented ease.
“It is, in a way,” Sherlock said, a little quieter.
“No, I’ve never…they said it was an esperiment.”
Sherlock picked up his pace upon seeing John and soon joined him at the end of the pitch. There was a slight flush in Sherlock’s cheeks and nose from the cold that John couldn’t help but find oddly endearing, but he quickly pushed those thoughts aside.
“I really don’t feel good.” John’s voice came out as a harsh whisper, and as soon as he finished speaking, he became limp in Sherlock’s arms, his head lolling to the side.
For John, the worst part of having nightmares wasn’t the nightmare itself, it was the moments that followed after waking up from one. The sheer panic that filled his chest, the heavy breathing that he felt he couldn’t control, the lingering feeling of paranoia, it was all too much.
“You should’ve said something. I’d rather not have to walk into rooms to find you clinging to Lestrade for dear life.”
“Holy
And the jacket itself isn’t even that old; I’ve seen that style in shops only about a year ago, and yet it already has that much wear and tear? You wouldn’t treat an item of clothing like that let alone own something in such a state, and yet you keep it; sentiment. It’s been given to you by a close family member, my guess would be an older brother seeing as how it’s slightly too big for you.”
Sherlock checked his phone for signal, but there was none. Mycroft had purposefully chosen such a remote location so that Sherlock wouldn’t be distracted by his phone.
Sherlock’s retort was cut off by a loud groan coming from the sitting room. Hamish let out a short gasp and was about to run off to John before Sherlock caught him and held him back.
“It’s fine, I’m sure we’ll work it out. Eventually.” John sighed. “But what about you? How does your family feel about everything? If you want to tell me, that is.”
“John!” He shouted over his shoulder.
The rugby pitch was sodden and riddled with patches of mud from the morning’s rain, but John had still insisted on coming out to practice.
The first touch of Sherlock’s fingertip to the warm skin of his back was like a tiny bolt of lightning. God, how he’d always wanted Sherlock’s hands on him. He tried to soak in the feeling as much as he could, to memorize that delicate touch tracing over the lines embedded on his skin, because he knew that it wouldn’t be long before he was off to the army, and this was probably as close to Sherlock as he was ever going to get.
“It’s for me, John,” he said.
“I am,” Sherlock said, returning to his frantic scribbling.
“Well, I know you’re a military man, recently invalided home from, what, Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John cleared his throat, still keeping his eyes shut. “Six.”
When Sherlock helped John back to the flat, he was strangely quiet. He assisted the doctor in cleaning off his face and even fetched him some painkillers and water.
“Prick,” John joked, not even surprised that his friend could deduce his injuries just from how he was breathing.
“Hm? Oh, no. My hands are freezing. Stupid weather.”
Sherlock finally deigned to slow down and allow John to walk next to him, though he continued to look straight ahead as he walked.
“That’s entirely beside the point.” Sherlock reached out and slowly closed John’s laptop. “Come on,” he said, holding his hands out for John to take.
“Keep them.”
“John? John, what's wrong?” Sherlock tried to keep his voice low, knowing John could be easily overwhelmed when he was in a lot of pain.
“Can’t. Busy.” Sherlock held up his mobile in explanation.
Sherlock to see. “Listen, if you wanted to- I mean I know you’re probably curious so I just, if you wanted to look at my, erm, my tattoos, you can. If you…if you want.”
“Not hungry.”
“Do you think, maybe we could…y’know.” He pressed a soft kiss to Sherlock’s neck.
“Sorry?”
“Oh and, er, happy Christmas, and all that,” Sherlock said.
Immediately, John froze.
John turned his head to look at the angry red numbers on his alarm clock, the reminder that he should be asleep burning into his vision.
“No thanks, mate. I’d really rather not be sick in the morning,” John said. He’d only had two drinks so far, but the company of his friends and the joy of exams being over seemed to be more than enough of a natural buzz.
“Sher-lock. S’weird, I know,” Sherlock said.
“You don’t have to keep…doing things for me, y’know.”
John let out an amused sigh and raked a hand through his hair. “No, we’ve separated now. It’s an on-off thing.”
“I need a scholarship if I’m gonna go to med school, that’s why. I had one bad day, and I’m fine now, okay?”
“Sherlock, I’m fine,” John insisted.
The detective stopped and turned around. “His cane!” He shouted, and dashed off again.
“C’mon, let’s move to the back,” Greg suggested, turning on the light in the car and taking off his seat belt.
Night had fallen by the time John managed to drag himself downstairs. Sherlock was sat in his chair in front of the fire, his open laptop casting a bright bluish glow on his face as his fingers flew across the keys.
John laughed.
“He what?”
“You were right, by the way, as if your ego needed any help. I
John said nothing.
“That’s hardly important. Any details you can give me will be of use, but you’re tired, I can tell. Sleep, get your rest, you’ll be here for a few days. I’ll go alert the nurses.” Sherlock gathered his coat and began to head to the door.
When the chipped green door of the flat slammed shut, John opened his eyes. He surveyed the room again, noting that his field of vision looked as if someone had put a vignette effect over it. He bit the inside of his lip and decided that he couldn’t put off the doctor’s visit any longer. He’d already pushed it back far too much than any intelligent medical man would, and silently berated himself as he set up an appointment.
, you big git.”
“What do they normally say?”
eat a meal in the same sitting.
“Yeah, John, ‘ave a little fun!” Mike joined in.
“Mm. Got shot. In the shoulder. Almost bled out on top of a patient I was working on. Nasty business. Why am I telling you this? I can’t even talk to my therapist about anything.”
“Alright, repeat after me,” Sherlock started, “One,” he said.
Sherlock and John were laughing all the way up the steps to the flat, holding their Chinese takeaway and trying not to trip over themselves. They reached the sitting room and shrugged off their coats, flinging them carelessly onto the sofa.
“Well, I was gonna join to help pay for uni, but then I got a scholarship here, so it wasn’t really an issue anymore.”
“No, but I know you well enough."
He knew it was getting late. He knew he should go to bed soon. But he couldn’t. Because all he could see was the suspect from the case they had solved earlier that night. The man had looked to be somewhere in his late thirties, with dark brown hair thinning slightly at the top. He spoke with a familiar Irish lilt and his dark brown eyes seemed to flicker with a malevolent glint.
“So, toast this morning?” John deflected.
“All right, mate?” came a voice to John’s right. He whipped around to see Greg Lestrade, a student a year his senior with a head of brown hair already greying slightly and a soft, amicable smile. Greg had been a new addition the team that year, so he’d only more recently been getting to know him.
it. Can you imagine a five year old holding up a fake police badge and trying to tell a dog he’d just committed theft?”
“No, I suppose not.” Sherlock looked as if he were considering something before turning back to the task at hand.
“John,” Sherlock said one chilly evening, sitting in his armchair and not even looking up at the doctor.
Without even thinking about it, John put his hand in the middle of the seat in a silent request. Ever since the night that Sherlock showed John how he could use his sense of touch, holding Sherlock’s hand had become a sort of way of grounding him, bringing him back down to earth, reminding him that he would never truly not be able to see.
Mike shrugged. “Fair enough.”
“Get out,” he said.
"Over-forty eyes," John mumbled to himself, "might need glasses," he added grumpily.
“Oh, thanks. I’d always wanted them. Tattoos, I mean. But I never had the money, and as if my dad would’ve let me, y’know? Should’ve seen ‘im when Harry came home with a little flower one on her wrist.”
not now that the people around him were all hammered and likely wouldn’t let him hear the end of it if they saw what he was hiding.
“I haven’t stopped, alright? I’ve just been busy. These last two cases took the life out of me and we’ve been swamped at the surgery.”
“Get the shirt, boys!” Tom shouted, suddenly lunging at John and tackling him to the floor before he could do anything to stop it.
Steeling himself, John opened the door and stepped inside, grateful for the warmth that greeted him. The smell of coffee, the dark hardwood floors, and the rickety chairs and tables that littered the space gave John a much welcomed feeling of calm.
It wasn’t until John heard the sound of Sherlock walking away that he snapped out of his sudden haze.
get better, okay? Just keep focusing on my voice and your breathing.”
“Why have you stopped updating your blog, John?” the detective asked in a tone rough with curiosity.
“That’s…that’s not even a good dare. Give me a better one,” he tried.
“No, you didn’t.”
“Mm…fell,” he panted.
The room was small, consisting of a bedside table, a lamp, a wardrobe, and a bed that was covered in an intricately patterned quilt. John plopped his suitcase onto the bed and opened it up. He found three days’ worth of clothes, a few toiletries, and surprisingly, his favorite books. John smiled to himself, thinking that he’d never even told Sherlock which were his favorites, of course he just knew.
John chuckled. “You’ll think it’s stupid.”
John felt as if every ounce of worry rushed out of his lungs in one relieved sigh.
“Just what?”
The second bedroom was small, with a slanted ceiling and a window on two of the walls. It would have been pitch black if not for the silver moonlight coming in from outside. Sherlock could see the silhouette of John’s small frame, tossing and turning and wriggling in the sheets. Upon moving closer he noted that his brow was filmed with sweat while muttered curses and pleas were escaping his lips.
John smiled at Sherlock, noticing the angry red patch on his cheek and the dried blood still clinging to his skin.
John hadn’t seen Sherlock since he met him in the library a few days ago and he still wasn’t sure whether or not Sherlock had decided to come to the game. Now John’s eyes were flitting through the countless faces gathered around the field, desperately trying to spot the familiar shock of dark brown curls.
Sherlock stopped his absentminded twirling of his fork and stared resolutely at his plate. “It was out of your control,” he said.
“You haven’t finished your applesauce,” he said, pointing to the small, half empty container that sat on the fold-out table in front of John.
And if they weren’t being interrupted, they were busy. John had rugby, a job, and mountains of homework, Sherlock had rigorous dance and violin lessons on top of schoolwork, and it all made for barely enough to time for a peck on the lips before one of them was out the door.
Sherlock put the scarf around his neck and tied it. “I like it,” he said.
“I never revise.”
Sherlock had slowed down a bit, knowing John would be on the other side, but when he turned the corner, the sight that awaited him was not what he expected.
Everything hurt and he couldn’t think straight, but somewhere in the back of his mind was the hope that Sherlock would realize that he was gone and come find him, because with black spots now starting to cloud his vision, it wasn’t looking like John would be getting up anytime soon.
“Whoa, whoa, hold on, I’ve got you,” John said as he caught Sherlock by the waist and straightened him back up again. “Are you feeling dizzy? Nauseous?”
“You could…stay here, if you like,” John suggested without even thinking about it.
. And if ever you are out of commission, I will try to involve you as much as physically possible. Is that…agreeable?”
“Christ!” John breathed as he bolted awake from the nightmare. Bleary eyed, John tried to take stock of his surroundings and found himself somewhat confused. He was on the sofa in the sitting room, covered with a blanket, and there was music coming from somewhere. Beautiful, melodic, drifting waves of sound that soothed his frayed nerves.
“Daddy?”
“No, seriously,” John chuckled. “What’s this for?”
“What good would I be to you, Sherlock?” He asked, his voice quietly shaking. “When five, ten years from now you’re still running around like a mad man and I’ll be trailing too far behind, not able to keep up with you. I know my limp was psychosomatic, but my leg still aches from time to time, and the pain in my shoulder, I swear it gets worse every few years. I just…” John looked away, tears welling reluctantly in his eyes, “I don’t want to hold you back.”
“Me, this,” he motioned all around the cabin, “this holiday, for me.”
“I used to use their lab for experiments on occasion; one of the technicians owed me a favour. It’s an excellent facility, though I’m not technically allowed there anymore.”
“Oh, er, yes. Yeah, thank you,” he said.
“Oh come on, you with your bloody bee studies all over the place, your chattering on about how you’re gonna keep bees when you retire, not to mention the amount of honey you—“
“Evening,” John called as he walked in, tossing his bag down onto the floor as soon as he entered the sitting room. Mike was slumped across the sofa, his glasses askew and his eyes fixed on the screen in front of him.
“Busy?”
John let out a short laugh and smirked down at his phone. Practice wasn’t for another few hours, and he could always do some revising afterwards, so he supposed it wouldn’t be so bad if he were to go see what Sherlock was up to instead.
“Symptoms?”
“Oh, for God’s sake,” Sherlock huffed. He stopped to untie the scarf around his neck, the one John had gotten him for Christmas. “Here,” he said, holding it out to John.
Sherlock covered his mouth with his hand and grimaced.
When John made the turn on the landing to the steps that lead to his room, Sherlock put both hands on his shoulders and steered him away.
Suddenly, John heard Sherlock moving his chair closer, and he could tell that his friend was just about bumping knees with him.
The taller man obliged, taking in John’s appearance as he sat. His eyes were tired and red, his face still pale. His hair was a bit ruffled from either tossing and turning in the bed or running his fingers through it.
John grit his teeth and held onto the arm of his chair with a death grip, not looking Sherlock in the eye.
“There’s more room, so you won’t feel as cramped. I know feeling trapped can be part of the problem, right?”
“Shh, s’okay. Breathe, John. I’m right here, you’re safe,” Greg reminded him in a gentler tone. He nodded and noticed that his legs weren’t shaking nearly as much now.
“You should be sleeping,” Sherlock said matter-of-factly.
“Of course it does; I always know what to do.” Sherlock smirked.
“Yes.”
“Sherlock? You listening?”
Sherlock smirked. “You know,” he said, pressing his mouth to John’s ear and whispering roughly, “I think you would look quite sexy with glasses.”
John suddenly let out a pained groan and wrapped his arms around his stomach. He slumped forward until his head landed in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. He was practically a dead weight leaning on Sherlock, who had immediately wrapped his arms around him and found him to be trembling lightly.
“Greg,” John interrupted, the nervousness in his chest getting exponentially worse. How could he have ever thought that he could hide this?
“And I trust you’ll be in for regular checkups?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes but obliged nonetheless, carefully unwrapping his gift. He slowly opened up the box and pulled out a soft, navy blue scarf.
“I still maintain that you started it,” Sherlock interjected.
The next few weeks seemed a bit unreal. Sherlock didn’t take any cases from clients or Scotland Yard, though John did catch him rifling through cold cases, which he didn’t mind.
“No, no, that’s not what I’m asking,” John rushed out, shaking his head fervently.
“Thought you didn’t like those songs,” John said after Sherlock had finished playing.
Sherlock grinned like the Cheshire cat and John couldn’t hold back a laugh. The odds were never in their favor, but it appeared that some unseen force was granting them luck that day.
“Anytime, dears. I’ll just leave you two to enjoy your night now,” she said, giving them a wink for good measure before heading back behind the counter.
Mycroft slowly made his way to the door.
“Nine.”
John grinned.
“My own experiments.”
He set the violin down on his chair and flew through the house with his navy dressing gown billowing behind him.
“Of course you did. You always have to make sure everyone is all right, yes? Always have to protect people, nurture them, be the one to save the day? Well, please do stop boring me with the caretaker act and believe me when I tell you that I am perfectly fine and I do not need your help.”
“Sorry, mate, just thought it’d be something with a bit more flair, y’know?” He chuckled.
, John!” Greg exclaimed, gaping at the mural of tattoos that adorned his shoulders and upper arms. Honestly, he thought he would have dissolved on the spot from embarrassment if anyone were to see his tattoos, but now, now he was just angry.
Stoically refusing to set up an appointment with a doctor, John settled on resting for a bit. His footfalls were heavy on the steps to his room, and it was only by the time he got there did he realize how tired he was.
“Killer? You think these were murders?”
“Where are we?” Sherlock asked, anxious to begin already.
Eventually, John was down to the last button. He looked up at Sherlock one more time before pulling his shirt off his shoulders and taking a deep breath. He didn’t hesitate when pulling off his t-shirt next, deciding that he simply wanted to get it over with.
John hadn’t even thought about that, really; he’d been so keyed up that any pain he might’ve been feeling didn’t quite register. Though now that he thought about it, he was definitely a little sore.
“Mycroft, he sends me away when he thinks I’m…overworked. Or for fear I might return to…old habits.”
“Well, in case you haven’t already deduced it, I do too, you know. Have feelings. For you.”
John awoke to the soft patter of rain on the bedroom window. Sherlock’s bedroom window, he reminded himself. He stretched lightly and looked to the bedside table to find his pain medication and a glass of water.
“What? God, no, of course not. That’s totally fine, more than fine,” John reassured.
His shoulder felt like it had burst into flames, the stinging heat sending searing pain down his entire arm and upper back. He was not going to be able to get up any time soon, he knew, but the freezing cold gravel wasn’t exactly an ideal resting spot.
“Yes.”
What kind of glasses do you think John would have? I personally like
“There we are,” Sherlock chuckled, running his hands playfully through John’s short hair.
“To…hang out?”
The doctor sat back in his chair and folded his arms. “What would you do with me, Sherlock? A blind doctor, how could I help you? What good would I be on cases? Think about it for Christ’s sake don’t make me keep spelling it out.”
“I heard your bed squeaking, which could have meant that you were either masturbating or having a nightmare, but given the circumstances, I—“
“You’ve had exactly four shifts in the past week and a half; that’s not exactly the dictionary definition of ‘swamped,’ as you put it.”
John backed away slightly but still held Sherlock’s gaze as he spoke.
"I was tired, Sherlock."
John laughed and shoved Sherlock playfully, feeling an almost childlike glee that he’d forgotten was even possible to feel.
Sherlock smirked and reached out to take the proffered cardigan. He pulled it on over his dress shirt and promptly returned to his relaxed position on the sofa.
After John ate his dinner and Sherlock had finished picking at his, they were sat together on the sofa, Sherlock wrapped up in a book while John leaned on his shoulder and watched the telly.
“Practice non-stop, overwork yourself—“
Sherlock reached over to the coffee table and grabbed the first movie on the pile before getting up to put it in the player. He waved the DVD case behind him to show John as he was setting it up.
self-esteem is so low that you can’t even believe that.”
Once John sat down, Sherlock extended his feet again until his toes were just about touching John’s thigh. John startled slightly at the touch, but Sherlock appeared completely unaffected, his eyes already fixed on the television.
John did let a small chuckle escape, then, earning him a disapproving glance from the girl sitting next to him. He tried to think of something Sherlock could do to relieve his boredom, and if he weren’t otherwise occupied, John would have suggested they hang out for a bit. Although, John thought, his lecture would be over in just another twenty minutes, and he really didn’t have much else on for the rest of the day.
“Uh, yeah. I guess it’s right there,” John mumbled, looking to where his phone rested on the small counter by his bed.
“You’re going to burn a hole in the floor if you keep that up,” Sherlock drawled, taking off his coat but refusing to sit down.
Sherlock found him and immediately asked if he needed to go to hospital, but John insisted that he’d be fine, he just needed a hot bath and some strong painkillers. This had happened before, and he knew the pain would dissipate to a dull ache within an hour.
“No, that’s how
Now Sherlock could feel John begin to settle into the embrace, leaning back into Sherlock’s chest. The taller man methodically lifted up John’s arm, uncurled his fist, and placed it at his side, repeating the process for the other hand. When that was done, he took his own palm and put it directly over John’s stomach. There, he could feel every single tremor running through John’s veins. He felt the shakes increase and decrease in severity at random intervals, as if testing the scale of an earthquake.
“But?”
John laughed under his breath, feeling his mood lighten despite the heavy workload still ahead of him.
“Come on, then,” John conceited, moving over and sitting up to make room next to him.
Looking out the window, Sherlock could see that the sun was beginning to go down, but hadn’t it been light out when John had left? Perhaps John had used the excuse of looking for firewood to take a walk and blow off some steam, Sherlock thought. John would likely be back soon, then.
“You keep saying he. Who he? What did he look like? What was he wearing?”
“No, nope, not you, go, now! We don’t need you.” He shooed them away with the swat of his hand.
“Never mind. Just eat something, will you?”
“You have something you want to ask me,” Sherlock stated.
“I think I’m gonna call it a night, actually,” John said, patting Sherlock’s ankle before getting up from the sofa. He placed his mug in the sink and walked over to the hallway. “Leave some biscuits out for Father Christmas, yeah?”
Normally he’d come home from his shift, trudge up the steps, barely spare the flat a glance and get on with the task of making tea or putting away the shopping. It was then that he realized just how little attention he actually paid to his surroundings sometimes. He’d gotten so used to the flat and its quirks and odd furnishings that he barely acknowledged them anymore. Now he examined the room as if it were his first time seeing the place.
John looked up to the ever-blinking cursor on his computer screen, feeling almost as if it were taunting him. He had been attempting to type up his and Sherlock’s latest case for almost an hour, but the return of the tremor in his hand had been impeding the process the whole way.
Wincing slightly as he pulled himself up, John quickly downed the pills and grabbed his crutches so he could start getting ready for the day.
“I am fine," John grumbled as Sherlock pulled the duvet over him.
“I must have gotten at least a bit drunk.  I remember not being able to walk right. And I…I might have gotten a cab? No, I don’t know. The next thing I remember is being face down on a wooden floor, knowing I was about to die.” John’s voice had cracked a bit towards the end, and he brought his palm back to his face and stared at nothing in particular. His breathing was becoming a bit labored, and he began scratching nervously at his hair and tugging at his shirt sleeves.
“Just breathe, John,” Greg said quietly, stopping the car on the side of the road.
John didn’t stir aside from a slight grimace.
After a quick dinner and a shower, John went to gather his things from upstairs as it was almost time for he and Sherlock to get going.
“Must be hard, turning around and not seeing the man you love and care about right next to you. Feels awful, I imagine.” John tried to sound angry but his voice only came out broken and quiet. “Bit lonely, probably.” He fidgeted with his fingers in his lap, swallowing hard.
“Papa?” he heard Hamish ask. “Daddy says you don't feel good. I want to help.” Sherlock finally finished filling the hot water bottle, wrapped a tea towel around it and walked quickly back to John.
"This is one of those things isn't it? Are you alright, John?"
“When the dog finally stopped, I tried to
John bit the inside of his cheek and looked up at Sherlock.
“Sorry?”
“She was a wealthy woman, going by the jewelry and clothing,” John started, “She was single. She wasn’t expecting to be attacked, having probably just gotten done getting ready for a date, but her attacker was certainly prepared, because her neck has been pretty precisely broken. I’d say the killer is most likely whoever she was about to go out on the town with, otherwise you would’ve either received a call from her would-be date, or already interviewed him.” He finished.
“Good.”
“Please, come in,” John deadpanned. He closed the door and looked to the sofa where Sherlock had draped himself.
“Yes, I would like that.”
.” The moment the words left his mouth, Sherlock realized that he may have been a bit too harsh.
As John stood in line, he couldn’t seem to stop glancing over his shoulder at the table, still not quite believing that Sherlock was there with him.
“Or what? What are you saying?”
Sherlock could see the man’s uncomfortable scowl in the rear view mirror, but he allowed them the questions nevertheless.
Greg gave him a reassuring pat on the back and sidled up next to him. He crossed his arms over his chest and squinted at the opposing team across the pitch.
Damn it.
“How do you mean?” He asked.
John had been sleeping for over an hour, and in that time, Sherlock found that he couldn’t find one thing to focus on. The case was Lestrade’s problem now, he decided, realizing that whatever triggered John was most likely due to the nature of the case, and it would prove pointless to try to work
“Time,” he said.
“John, is that him?
John jostled in his seat as his eyes snapped open.
The sound of soft knocking on the front door broke Sherlock out of his thoughts. He didn’t even have to think about it; it was John. Sherlock could always tell who was at the door based on how they knocked.
“I do not have a tea addiction,” John argued. “Bloody well might do now, though.”
He hadn’t always had this problem; it was only after the army, after grainy memories of bombs going off in the distance had etched themselves into his head did he have this reaction.
John furrowed his brow. “What?”
that,” he panted, stepping into the flat a bit more.
According to John’s mum, John needed ‘bed rest.’ Sherlock had been fine with this at first, assuming that bed rest simply meant that John would lie in his bed while they talked and played board games instead of being in the sitting room or going outside. He was
going wrong whilst chasing a suspect through an incredibly dark alleyway on a frigid winter night with patches of ice littering the pavement.
“It wasn’t.”
“Good, because that ‘thought that counts’ notion is rubbish. And a waste of tea.”
“Oh, well, my apologies. I’m sure you’ve got lots of important experiments to do on icing sugar.”
Surprisingly, Sherlock went about making his own cup of tea as the shorter man sulked at the counter. The detective pointed to the pile of glass still sitting by John's feet on his way into the sitting room.
“Ah, I see. You could have some water though? Or a fortune cookie,” John suggested.
“The case was Janine’s missing dog. I found said dog traipsing through shrubbery in the park. Case closed.” Sherlock pouted.
“That’s a yes. Come on.” John supported Sherlock’s wobbly frame as they walked to a stall. He set Sherlock down slowly in front of the toilet and kneeled by him, placing a hand on his back in support.
John shook his head. “No, look, this is my fault anyway, I—“
“I know you like to dance, Sherlock. Come on, it’ll be fun.”
“I’m old and broken, Sherlock.” John sighed. “And I can’t just spring back after things like this like you can.”
Instead of gently waking the doctor, Sherlock got his violin and played a shrill set of notes that was vaguely akin to a cat scratching a chalk board.
“Okay,” he said, sighing dejectedly.
“I can’t- I can’t keep pretending like I can handle it all. I bloody can’t, Sherlock.” Then suddenly, Sherlock had an armful of John. The blond teen buried his face in Sherlock’s chest and started to cry in earnest.
That’s it, John thought, no more of this.
“Where’s what? I
“He’s not a pervert!” John shouted, having no idea where this sudden wellspring of anger had come from.
When he dragged his bare feet into the sitting room, he was almost startled to see John’s small frame resting in the armchair. The man was half asleep; head slumped over to where it was practically on the armrest.
John looked at him and shook his head. Sherlock was obviously feeling somewhat guilty, and eventually he and Sherlock would need to sit down and have a proper talk, but right now John needed to sleep and Sherlock needed to do whatever he was going to do.
“I think I’m just gonna stay here, actually. My family aren’t very big on Christmas.”
The sun was just beginning to set when they arrived at the café. They sat down across from each other in their familiar booth by the window before John volunteered to go and order for them.
The last two weeks of the break had been filled with binge-watching films, solving a few small cases, and performing a variety of makeshift experiments on whatever Sherlock could find lying around the flat.
“John.” Sherlock stopped him, sensing that John was well on his way to working himself up. “It’s all right. You’re exhausted. We’ll just watch a film and I’ll make you some tea.”
“M’not embarrassed, I’m—“ Sherlock stopped short and began retching rather violently into the toilet.
“Sherlock,” the doctor scolded. “Y’know, I reckon you wouldn’t be too happy if your eyes suddenly decided to play tricks on you, to deceive you.”
“Yes, I know.”
“I can teach you the technique, you know. It’s quite simple, really, all you have to do is- Oh, for Christ’s sake,” Sherlock cursed under his breath as his phone alerted him to a text. He swiped his phone roughly from off the table and began stabbing away at the keys as he responded.
“He still there?” Lestrade asked shakily.
John waited with bated breath for Sherlock to say something, but in lieu of responding, he simply reached out and trailed his finger over the tattoo again, sending shivers down John’s spine.
“Sherlock!” He berated, rubbing at his ear as if that would make his startled reaction go away. “Jesus Christ, are you trying to give me a coronary? Don’t
“Isn’t it?” Sherlock asked with a smile, as if he were admiring the therapist for his work.
Slowly, Sherlock and Lestrade began to walk with John, but it was clear that it was going to be difficult. Sherlock couldn’t help but feel a stab of guilt every time John let out a pained noise; how had he failed to notice that John had stopped running behind him? How had he not realized that John hadn’t been there as he was apprehending their suspect? Sherlock wanted to chalk it all up to adrenaline, but he knew that wasn’t it, and the worst part was that Sherlock had done this to John before. He would leave him at crime scenes, dash off without him at St. Bart’s, and somehow, John would eventually forgive him, but Sherlock wasn’t so sure that would be the case this time.
but just in your direction?”
“Hey, Mike. Greg,” John said, waving to get his attention.
John swallowed thickly and pursed his lips.
“I was just going to say that I, erm, that I also…“ John trailed off, wondering why it was so difficult to form a coherent sentence all of a sudden.
The doctor was hit hard enough to be knocked down to the gritty pavement. He grunted in pain but quickly began trying to stand back up. He only made it about half way before he was tackled to the ground, and received a good number of painful blows to the stomach.
But no, that wasn’t it. He was fine, Sherlock was fine; there was nothing different about the two of them sitting together now than when they would sit and watch telly together. Well, except for the fact that John was about to take off his shirt.
“All right, John?” Mike asked.
“Exactly, Sherlock. But you haven’t stayed out of my hair for my sake; you’re completely ignoring me. What’s going on with you?”
“John!” Sherlock shouted as he made his way up to the flat. “You should have seen the severed feet that Molly had for me. Perfect for my experiment. Only a small explosion this time; no harm done, aside from— Oh.” Sherlock stopped short when he entered the sitting room. “You’re upset,” he said.
“Right, right,” Lestrade mumbled in disbelief. He got out his phone as quickly as he could and stepped out of the room.
Warmth filled John’s chest as he placed the phone down next to him and curled back up in the bed. Sherlock must have known that John would have trouble sleeping, which meant that he must have been playing deliberately to help him sleep all those other times, as well.
“You’re hurt. What happened? Where are you?” Sherlock asked quickly.
“What?”
John held back anything he was about to say and really thought about Sherlock’s words for a moment. He’d never really interacted with Seb outside of rugby, and he had no idea how long he’d been treating Sherlock like this, or how often.
“You wash your hands a lot, and you go outside often. The cold air dries out your skin and you don’t take care of it.”
The first touch of Sherlock’s hands to his caused him to let out a short gasp. Sherlock’s hands were warm and enveloping. The lotion smelled faintly of bergamot and made for a smooth glide as Sherlock moved his fingers along the back of John’s hand.
Sherlock sighed. “I’ve told you, John, I use a specific memory technique in order to ensure that all important information is kept neatly organized for ease of access at any given time.”
Sherlock didn’t answer. Instead he completely ignored John’s outstretched hand as he got up and walked away.
As gently as he could, Sherlock lowered himself and John to the floor and sat with the doctor propped up between his long legs. He wrapped his arms around John’s midsection as he shuffled around enough to make sure they were comfortable.
John was startled out of his thoughts when he felt someone tap him on the shoulder. He turned around and saw the man from last night, Sherlock, staring at him and holding out the cardigan John had given him.
“Sort of, yeah,” John sighed. “I want to show you, but Sherlock, I..” he trailed off, looking Sherlock in his ice blue eyes. Those gorgeous eyes stared back at him with such innocent curiosity, and in that moment John decided to hell with his doubts and fears; he would have to tell Sherlock eventually and there really wasn’t going to be a better time than right now. “Okay, you can see it, but just let me explain. No deducing this time.”
“I’m quite all right, Mrs. Hudson. I knew I’d be meeting John here this afternoon, so I thought I’d save my caffeine and sugar intake until then.”
John put his hand over Sherlock’s. “Because you were too busy breaking things apart that you didn’t see the whole bloody picture. Don’t overthink this, yeah?”
John could’ve sworn his heart broke a little at Sherlock’s words. The other students had probably pressured him into drinking just so they could have a laugh at how he’d act.
In lieu of answering, John rubbed at his eyes more, and looked up at Sherlock to find him slightly out of focus.
“John, wait—“
“You’re not gonna let me live that down, are you?”
John looked almost offended.
Sherlock waited until he saw the black car pull away to go and fetch John. When he came back up, the doctor hobbled right to his usual chair, and Sherlock absently noted it was becoming a sort of understanding that they sat in their respective spots. It was as if John belonged there, like he’d been there all along.
called for an ambulance, Sherlock, it’s not gonna teleport here if that’s what you—“
After a very tricky maneuver into a cab and a very long trip up the steps to the flat, John was back in 221b, slumped in his armchair with his eyes closed and not planning on moving for at least another century.
“Christ, you’re drunk.”
, John?” Sherlock berated.
“I’ll admit there was a part of me that hoped that wasn’t the case. It seems I am prone to occasional bouts of sentiment, after all.”
“Oi, I’ve got it all planned out. That’s like half the battle right there,” John reasoned.
“It’s all right, Sherlock. We’ve definitely got some more talking to do, but lucky for you I’m knackered. And I’m not letting you out of this bed, either,” John said matter-of-factly, wrapping a possessive arm around him.
His words,
"Jesus Christ!" John moaned in surprise, his eyes snapping open. Sherlock wasn't looking at him, instead he was watching his hands as he stroked John, spreading oil to his length. The look of concentration and the bright blush covering Sherlock's face was incredibly hot to John, and he let out an appreciative sound, rocking his hips upwards into Sherlock's hands.
Sherlock spent the next few days working himself to a frenzy over the fact that someone else was going to see him dance. John was one thing, he would be impressed by mere pliés – not that he knew what those were, or anything else about ballet.
The doctor ran his hand through his hair once more and decided he’d make breakfast. He’d already eaten some but Sherlock hadn’t eaten last night – or probably not at all yesterday – and he had been drugged. Putting the kettle on, John thought about Sherlock’s words. The man admitted he had used drugs before. That would be something he felt like they needed to talk about.
Sherlock watched him, his expression probably just as stunned as he felt it was. Then, as he started to understand what was happening, he made the decision. Turning to the dog again, he crouched and opened his arms a little. The woman who’d been escorting the dog loosened the leash enough for the puppy to practically jump into Sherlock’s arms, licking his face enthusiastically.
This one is weird as fuck and I actually ended up writing it into a fic, wink wink (A Study in Taste, if anyone got actually interested)
chair already? – and opened his laptop. He had stayed up late last night just in case Sherlock needed him, and at some point he had just opened his laptop and started to write.
However, he had a clue of what he himself would be saying, and that was both a blessing and a curse. It hadn't been hard to adapt that to his repertoire, but over ten years of fruitless search left him feeling empty. Eventually he decided he didn't want to bother being disappointed every time. He would be wrong anyway.
?” he whispered, frowning a little as he looked at John. “Oh, I could’ve seen that if I had looked closer.”
John kept still, desperately trying to obey Sherlock’s orders, but every twitch of his hips resulted in a partly playful, partly disappointed glare. Finally, the taller man raised a hand to touch John’s bollocks and moaned around him, knowing that was all it would take to send the blond over the edge.
“So you managed to find the most Christmassy café in London?” he teased, glancing at Sherlock who gave him an envelope (the card said ‘coffee shop date’) and then pushed a spoon and one of the cups towards John.
– and showed him to the leotards. At least she let him choose in peace after giving some advice on things that Sherlock mostly knew about already. He hadn’t had to look for long since the dark green, short-sleeved piece seemed just perfect, and he had quickly gone to try it on before buying it, deciding on a new pair of tights as well.
John left the sack alone, if Sherlock wanted to surprise him he didn’t want to ruin it. But he kept glancing at the bag, idly wondering what on earth it could contain.
"John? John!"
Some more ice-skating and Sherlock gets mushy.
"Is that... The case? The pink lady's case you kept insisting was there?" John was suddenly having a moment of doubt. Hadn't Sherlock said that the murderer had the case? How did it end up here? Surely, Sherlock wasn't...
John pulled out the usual card, flipping it over. It said 'romantic outdoors ice skating' and there were two tickets taped to the card. "Romantic?" John grinned, taking the tickets and storing the card and the envelope in his coat pocket.
~'*'~
“What’s going on here?” John asked, leaving his coat on the rack and walking to the kitchen. The microscope was still there, but the rest of the table was filled with bowls, empty plates and a few plates already filled with cookies.
"Sherlock, you are drunk."
"You shouldn't have gone through any trouble for us." John was feeling both grateful and a little bit coddled. "Not that I'm not grateful, but I'd still like to do the turkey myself, I just couldn't find any helpful tips."
At first, it was well past midday before he could even drink a cup of coffee and maybe eat a fruit, but nothing heavier. Lately he'd got better, but the pizza he was now eating really felt like his first proper meal in
“It’s not the tights,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, clearly missing the point. “The jacket and hat were very detailed, I know I told you Mrs Hudson spent at least 20 hours sewing them.”
John grinned, taking Sherlock’s hand as they got into a cab. They went to see the Carnaby Christmas lights and then started shopping. The masses of people made them both a little impatient to get it all done quickly, but they still managed to find some gifts for Mrs Hudson, Lestrade, Molly and a few other people. Sherlock even found something that he deemed useful enough to give to Mycroft.
The mistletoes were probably John's favourite thing so far. He liked the way Sherlock would get up from the sofa suddenly when John was about to walk under the doorway. The detective would practically run towards the kitchen so that he'd "happen" to walk under the mistletoe at the same time as John and that way get to kiss him shyly (and a few times not-so-shyly) multiple times during the day.
Sherlock let out a moan, and it was very arousing for John to notice that the detective was already rock hard from just kissing. He helped Sherlock to lay fully on his back, and then trailed down to kiss at the brunette's neck. He ran his hands over Sherlock’s chest, feeling his hard nipples under the thin shirt, and muffled his own moan on Sherlock’s shoulder.
John shook his head, smiling at Sherlock. “Um, no… I think I can appreciate it a bit more now that I know how difficult it actually is.”
Sherlock's nose crinkled in the way John thought was absolutely endearing.
He took of his shoes after a while, flexing his toes against the rug on the floor. He rarely used shoes in his flat, so it would make him feel more at home here too, he reasoned.
Sherlock's voice got louder when John slowly unbuttoned his shirt. He planted a light kiss on Sherlock’s chest, and enjoyed the whimper the detective gave at that. He was getting more confident with what they were doing, and it seemed that Sherlock was too.
Sherlock looked absolutely ridiculous in the shorts, the jersey and helmet that squished his curls, but the detective had had time to brace himself to the experience, so he handled it with grace.
Sherlock's smile falters slightly. "I'm sorry. The first case took so long, and then there was that strangling right after and I... I forgot. I forgot about Christmas." He took a look around the room.
Sherlock emerged after a while, inviting John into the bathroom. The doctor went happily, smiling at Sherlock and kissing him softly.
John’s eyebrows shot up and the took the jumper for a closer inspection. “You
John didn't seem disturbed by the silence, and the fact that he'd just came voluntarily with Sherlock somehow calmed the detective's mind. Maybe he could trust that John wouldn't run away as soon as he really got into the case. That was as far as Sherlock allowed his thoughts to go on that matter and when they reached Brixton, his mind was completely focused on the case.
“Yeah, oh indeed. You do sound very nice when you’re getting a massage.” John climbed off Sherlock and slid up again to sit with his back on the headboard, his pyjamas embarrassingly revealing his current state.
Out in the garden where we planted the seeds
"What's that then? Don't tell me you're going to stuff that to the fridge too?" John asked, eyeing the big bag a little suspiciously now. Sherlock just chuckled and shook his head.
"I'm assuming you recognised that too."
“I don’t think.” Sherlock drowned his cup and put it on the coffee table. “I’m sure you’ll have made something edible.” Then he took John’s free hand and once again started to play with John’s fingers, stroking and very gently twisting them. John drank his own tea and joined his other hand on the activity too. After a while they were lounging and John had the sense to arrange them so that they were laying on the sofa before they both fell asleep.
There were three murders the Yarders had suspected to be connected, but Sherlock corrected that one of them was a suicide, but the two others were indeed connected.
When he got back to the living room, Sherlock was awake and sitting on his chair. The detective took one look at John and his face fell just the tiniest bit.
Sherlock threw a dramatic arm over his face with a grimace. “Apparently I have never really danced ballet. I’m sore
Sherlock was extremely confused now, but got interrupted by the doctor again before he could even open his mouth properly. “Just - just see this, please don’t run.” Being too confused by what was happening, Sherlock just stood and watched with a frown as the blonde opened his jacket and started on his shirt buttons.
John went to turn off the all the other lights, so the flat was filled with a warm blue glow from the tree. Sherlock curled up on the one end of the sofa and John occupied the other.
Sherlock huffed a dramatic breath and put his tea down. “It’s my hard drive, I only put things in there that are useful so I can find them later.”
“Well, I think that’s definitely amazing.” Sherlock gave him a smile at that, but turned to face the window again. John wasn’t sure what that meant. Maybe the brunette was just shy? John wished he could tell.
"John?" Sherlock looked very confused and very emotional, and John felt a bit light-headed. "I was going to ask if you'd like to marry me."
Sherlock was sitting in his chair, sipping on the glass of mulled wine Mrs Hudson had stuck on his hand. John was in the kitchen, humming along to some annoyingly over-played Christmas song on the radio while he rolled out the gingerbread dough. The gifts they had gotten from Greg, Molly, Mrs Hudson and even Mycroft were placed under the tree, the guests had left an hour ago.
~'*'~
Talking about Sherlock’s dancing was something that immediately put him on alert, John could feel his legs tense on his lap. When Sherlock didn’t comment, John continued: “I understand you, um, said you don’t have a teacher, right? I mean you haven’t, or...”
When there were no gifts left, John licked his lips and got up. “I’ve got a gift for you too,” he started, looking at Sherlock.  “It’ll be here any second.”
Giving up, Sherlock took the plate and started to poke at the chicken. John finished his plateful quickly and headed for the shower. "I'm going to shower now, and that plate had better to be empty when I get back."
Sherlock arrived as if in haste, almost slamming the door and then swishing his coat off, throwing his dance bag on the desk.
Sherlock choked out a weak "one" and John lifted his hand again. He took his time to aim, and Sherlock tensed in anticipation before the stroke hit his behind.
John was yet again mesmerised by the elegance of the dancers, so much that he almost lost track of the plot. But he’d seen enough in the practices that he had already figured out most of what was happening on the stage, even if his attention had been mostly focused on Sherlock. But now everything seemed nicer and more professional with the proper costumes and music and without Mrs Hudson jumping to the stage to correct whatever she thought was wrong at the time.
. They were watching him. Not the pizza though, that was what he was going to order. And he could dismiss the date thing entirely and see if Sherlock would to the same. Yes, that's a good plan, though John wasn't entirely sure how long it had taken him to come up with it.
John gave a sigh, almost protesting again but instead he gave in and got dressed. Sherlock smiled happily, picking up the two pairs of slippers and heading back to the hallway. “Excellent, now let’s go.”
John couldn't help himself and giggled. "It's a week until Christmas. I thought we could have a real Christmas for a change."
"Maybe she left it at home?"
When the break ended and they got back to London, John dug up every book about trains he could find and practically ate them. If his parents thought he was cured, they were very wrong. True, he wasn't the passive, miserable sack lying on the bed he used to be, but he was still feeling dead.
"How... Oh never mind." John slumped down on one of the armchairs, balancing the cane on his leg, and took a look around again. It was strange how familiar the place felt already. He reached to pick up the Union Jack pillow he actually could remember seeing the previous time from the floor and plucked it behind his back. "So why did you run off yesterday? It seemed to be important."
John knew he sounded nervous but he couldn’t help it. “Actually I had something planned for you, for us, and please tell me if I’m going too far.”
Sherlock snapped his mouth shut, shaking his head. “Nothing, it can wait. You can go get the door.”
“John,” Sherlock interrupted his blabbering, “are you saying you’d pay ballet lessons
Somehow that got Lestrade's attention and he turned to face John again. "I'm sorry, but I should get to work. I don't know how Sherlock got you to come with him, but I can tell he likes you, if he's capable of that," he chuckled.
John felt his eyelids grow heavy, and he put his hands around the detective and maneuvered them both to lay more comfortably. He almost started laughing when he saw the brunette already half asleep, but soon they were both snoring.
One night in the fridge wasn’t nearly enough to melt it, so together they made sure the microwave wasn’t contaminated ("God knows what you have put there, Sherlock") and then let the turkey melt there as the oven heated. Sherlock was keeping an eye for the temperature while John cut the carrots and tried his best to make something edible out of the beans and cranberries and the mix of spices Mrs. Hudson had recommended.
"You can't
“But you’re just… God, I shouldn’t get so horny from seeing you happy in your new kit,” John groaned, letting his head fall back to the pillow. “Is happiness even a kink? If it is, I’m super kinky then,” He sighed, letting his back arch as he rode the waves of arousal that coursed through his body.
After the dinner, Sherlock was laying on the sofa again, this time merely content. John had persuaded him into trying the food, piling his plate with a small amount of everything. Sherlock ended up realising that he in fact did like the turkey and the weird bean dish and Mrs. Hudson's potato casserole.
“You’ll start with buying me one of those raspberry muffins, and a cappuccino,” she decided, grinning. John just laughed and turned to the coffee machine. “Right.”
Not that John really wanted to care, his mood too good to be ruined right now. It was the end of summer, the hottest part gone but not yet quite autumn. But the threat of cold winds was there, earlier than last year. And he could tell it would start raining soon, any minute now. The aphids were already seeking refuge in the underside of birch leaves.
Well, almost. It seemed like he would be the one to nag around the flat, Sherlock seemed to make a lot of mess.
“I also got a pair of new tights to go with that as well, since my old tights aren’t very compatible with leotards,” he said casually, now picking up the book and smiling a bit as John just stared at the garment. “Do you need help with this? I could quiz you.”
“That really is a mystery.”
Sherlock led them to the front door, knocking on it. An old lady opened the door after a moment, greeting Sherlock and inviting them in. John could immediately see that she was a bee-keeper; there was a bee-keeper’s hat hanging on the wall next to copious amounts of drawings of bees and flowers. The lacy curtains had small bees on them, and when they stepped further inside, John saw a table full of different leaflets and booklets about bees and bee-keeping.
Especially Afghanistan had been a wrong move. It could've been alright had he just been a soldier, but working as an army doctor resulted in learning all the obscure places where the Words could be on the human body. Seeing so many people die made John worry about his own life. He had never thought that he would actually die, but seeing a boy half his age getting shot in front of him... They had been talking just a few days before, and even though the gun shot had torn the skin, John could remember the words that had been there.
Okay so yeah. It's been almost half a year and this chapter is quite short (managed to cross the 10,000 word count though, yay) but I'm working on a new one (along with my other fics) so one so let's hope it'll take a bit less time.
John just stared at the man – Sherlock, what a name – and nodded. He was already sure he’d follow this man almost anywhere, there was so much he wanted to ask him. So they made their way out of the coffee shop and onto the street, where Sherlock hailed a cab.
"And making cards too," Sherlock said, getting the first gifts out of the bag.
“So, if you’re feeling confident enough about biology, maybe you could come to my practice tomorrow?” Sherlock asked suddenly, looking straight ahead at the streets that flew by the window. John rested his head on his shoulder and hummed.
Of course the stores were almost empty, as he had feared. He somehow managed to find a small frozen turkey and some just-add-water sauce, and he hopelessly added eggs and beans to the list. Some cinnamon just in case he might try gingerbreads again. Well, with Sherlock injured he would probably stay up all night anyway so he might as well make use of the time. He took extra care when walking back home.
Sherlock reached out with his other hand, and John took it. He helped Sherlock lift his head and sat on the sofa with the detective’s head on his lap. John instantly started to massage the curls and Sherlock gave a deep sigh. He lifted his hand again and searched for John’s hands. He quickly found the left and John let him pull it to his lap where Sherlock started to play with the ring on his ring finger.
Eventually John had to use the loo and Sherlock got up as well. Both brushed their teeth and then kissed some more before going to the kitchen for breakfast.
"I mean - are you sure? I'm not... I’m not the easiest man to live with, everyone’s said that.” Sherlock gave a small sound, almost like a sob. “I’m broken, I’ll push you away some day.”
Sherlock sighed and laid on his back. "Of course I'm alright."
(See the end of the chapter for
, a voice said in his head. He looked at the man again. It was true, he knew nothing about the man. But he definitely wanted to find out, and the brunette had invited him to see a flat. Suddenly living with Sherlock didn’t so sound bad at all.
They got off and walked to their flat hand in hand, Sherlock’s ears still tinted light pink and John wearing a small smile on his face.
“I need to practice,” he stated before dashing off, leaving John out of breath and slightly blushed on the bed.
John woke up alone on Wednesday morning and found that the detective had left the flat completely. At least he'd sent John a text to let him know that he was at Bart's this time.
"How much?" They had agreed they'd always set the limits first. Sherlock looked up and considered for a second.
"I just hope you'd woken me up and asked me. But," Sherlock actually raised his head almost defiantly, "I think I am ready."
John giggled a bit and sat up properly. “Alright, so what’s today’s surprise?” he asked, smiling at Sherlock, who bit his lip a little.
The blond realised he was grinning like an idiot, but he didn’t want to stop. He grinned all through his shift, in the Tube and on the short walk to 221B. There, after climbing the stairs and smelling something delicious, John grinned even wider.
"God, I shouldn’t get so horny from seeing you happy in your new kit."
That did it for John, and it turned out that Sherlock didn't need much guiding after all. Afterwards, they cleaned up and cuddled on the bed, listening as the night killed the noises of the traffic outside.
again.
“It’s only rented, I wouldn’t buy a suit without consulting you. But you needed it and I didn’t want to ruin the surprise. You’re not going to wear your wedding suit to a simple date,” Sherlock said, scraping mould to the trash bin.
“You were in the
Eventually they finished breakfast and then cuddled and sipped tea contentedly.
“Merry Christmas, John.”
John watched him go, looking only proud and smitten even as the costume jiggled and bounced with every step Sherlock took. He was proud, of course he was very proud of him.
Sherlock interrupted him again, but this time it was with a kiss as the dancer climbed onto John’s lap and hugged his middle tightly. Then he buried his head in John’s neck and gave a laugh.
It hit Sherlock one morning, straight out of nowhere. He had left John sleeping in their bed. The doctor would sleep all day if he was allowed, but Sherlock only needed five hours and he was done.
He had been a kid when he had first learned what the Word on his wrist meant. Back then it had been exciting and he had spent years hoping his soulmate wanted to be a pirate too. He was sure that his soulmate would want to be his friend because no one else did. But at the age of 14 he was already fed up. It was surprisingly hard to keep hearing your word all over again but never get it right the other way around. He had no idea what he was expected to say, and it bothered him. He knew things about people just by looking at them, but he never knew what to say to them. Mycroft just scoffed when he tried to ask him about it so he never asked again.
“You alright?” John groaned, resting his hands on Sherlock’s hips as he fought to keep his hips from bucking up. Sherlock moaned again and nodded frantically. “Uh, yes… Yes. You?”
"You'll need to wrap up this cast though, you're the doctor."
Actually, not many were there for private lessons since Mrs. Hudson was running the place mostly on her own and she didn’t have the time to tutor each dancer privately. John wondered if Sherlock would soon join them in group classes, but he didn’t think it was his place to ask. So, he let Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson figure it out. Sherlock seemed to be advancing pretty quickly after all.
"I'm the only one in the world, I invented the job."
It was still a week before Sherlock managed to get a date with Mrs. Hudson that didn’t collide with an important lecture or an experiment.
Any feedback is again very welcome!
"I'll have pizza, please. Just some sort of pizza." Angelo nodded and left with a mild frown and John let out a breath of relief.
“Yes, you’re going to see culture,” Sherlock chuckled, giving John a pair of tickets. “Nutcracker? The ballet?” John read out, glancing at Sherlock, who nodded and glanced at him. “Problem?”
John gets left behind.
Mrs. Hudson was just as nice as she had been the previous day and that made John feel somewhat calmer. At least someone was looking forward of seeing John. She was almost too excited and fussed with him all the way to 221B, since she wasn't entirely sure Sherlock was still in after coming home in the middle of the night.
And it clicked.
“Of course I did,” Sherlock said, wrapping his arms around him, resting them on his waist. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
“I will definitely come with you every week I can.” John’s voice sounded slightly out of breath due to the massage, and that was probably why Sherlock’s answering “yes” was more like a moan than his usual witty voice. John found a particularly good spot between Sherlock’s shoulder blades and managed to turn that single moan into a longer series of breathy sounds that were almost too much for the blond’s self-control.
John read the card, glancing back at Sherlock in surprise and amusement. “’Warm jumpers, one tolerable and one hideous’ What does ‘hideous’ mean, exactly?” He asked, shaking his head fondly.
When they finally got into the house, the DI he met next seemed to almost like Sherlock, and Sherlock apparently didn't hate him. Lestrade did cast a suspicious look on John's way, but didn't argue Sherlock when he insisted to let John come too. After Sherlock got to work, John couldn't take his eyes off the man. The speed of his thoughts and deductions made John almost dizzy and he couldn't help the praises. But Sherlock said it was fine, and John almost wanted to laugh at the surprised look on the detective's face when he said it. Maybe he could explore that later.
“You’ll see when you come back,” Sherlock promised with a grin.
After Sherlock started to finally relax under John’s hands, the blond started to work his way downwards, following Sherlock’s spine and putting pressure on the muscles on either side of the bones. Now Sherlock was lightly pushing back and John could tell he was enjoying himself.
“Please, John!” He pleaded, kissing the doctor and tugging on his t-shirt again.
It was the fifth and by far the worst OD of Sherlock's life. It got even worse right when he found out that his brother had found his soulmate when he'd tried to squeeze whatever information he had thought Lestrade possessed about Sherlock's private life out of the DI. They seemed to immediately connect – something Sherlock always thought was a cliché out of a fairy tale – and watching their happiness made him feel sick in a way he didn't want to even begin to think about, and never before had he been closer to finally slice the “hi” in half. Seeing his brother smile that genuine smile at Lestrade that had never been aimed at him made Sherlock’s stomach turn.
Before Sherlock could answer though, John's phone started ringing. Sherlock shook his head, so John stopped his hand before he could answer the call. Soon enough, the caller gave up and silence fell again.
“Just wanted to try one, finally,” Sherlock shrugged and peered at John’s textbook and the messy notes taped to it.
John had claimed his chair and his side of the bed and Sherlock gave it all up voluntarily.
“So, you’ve got us a tree?” John asked, getting coffee. Sherlock had clearly made him sandwiches already, and he munched on them happily, sitting across from Sherlock. “Uh, yeah… In the living room,” Sherlock replied distractedly, still staring into the microscope.
"Sherlock's brother, he's my, uh, my soulmate." The DI blushed slightly at that and John's surprised face probably didn't help. "Sherlock's got a brother? Is he like Sherlock or...?"
“It’s the routine, I guess, getting into the swing of things,” Sherlock just shrugged, smiling brightly.
“I’m sure that’s not the case, Miss,” John grinned, ushering Sherlock towards the dressing rooms. “Bye!”
They warmed up by skating round the rink a few times, John still inexperienced enough that he was hanging onto Sherlock’s hand, grinning widely. When he started remembering how the skates worked, Sherlock helped him to try crossover again, and then they did a few slow-motion pirouettes too, Sherlock hugging John tightly and moving his feet so that they were spinning around.
He seemed very happy with the studio, and John loved the big grin he always wore at home before the lesson. He seemed to love the professional-looking studio, and he even ended up buying a better pair of ballet slippers after Mrs. Hudson recommended them. John caught him trying them on in the bathroom, grinning widely down at his feet before doing some sort of ballet-posing. John left him at it, smiling to himself.
John was still amazed by the clean fridge when he made breakfast the next morning, smiling at the now neat veggie drawer and the actually really cute multicoloured containers that were meant for storing the leftovers (in the red and yellow ones) and Sherlock’s “essential experiment materials” (in the green and blue containers).
Saturday, Sherlock woke John up but didn’t tell what that day’s calendar surprise would be until after they’d had lunch (meaning takeaway from the closest Chinese). Then he threw John’s coat onto the doctor’s face and pulled his Belstaff on. “Come on, John!”
“Yes?”
Am I catching up?? Nope?? But at least my Christmas mood is back so expect me to get stuff done soon!
suit for something more special. “Come here,” he sighed, pulling Sherlock into his arms and kissing him softly.
After Angelo had left, John finally managed to cut his first mouthful of the pizza. It was delicious and suddenly John realised how hungry he actually was. Sherlock seemed to be watching him with a look of tolerance – he did say he doesn’t want to eat – when he wasn't searching the street, so John tried to keep his munching somewhat civil.
“So it’s a memory technique?”
After a while John went back to laying on top of Sherlock, listening to his heartbeat as they both caught the last of their breaths.
“So, I thought you’d appreciate having a clean, fresh fridge this time, if you’re planning on cooking something this year. Or maybe cleaning it would’ve been wise earlier too, it’s not like I’m doing this only because it’s Christmas,” Sherlock mumbled, rambling a little.
They kissed for a good while, just standing there on the kitchen doorway with their hands on each other’s hips. Eventually, Sherlock pulled back and sighed a little, a small smile lighting up his face. “Let’s get the groceries in the fridge, and then maybe you could kiss me again…”
"Then let me bloody sleep, it's only seven am," John groaned, rolling over and trying to pull the pillow from Sherlock’s grip. "And give me my pillow."
"Oh no, no guests, no. Just us, if you want to. And I actually want to talk to you about the present thing, but not right now." John couldn't help grinning. "You could help me decorate the tree. Did you have nice time at the Yard?"
Unbeta'd again, and
John had to smirk at Sherlock’s concern. “I’ll be fine, plus I’ll get some savings too so it’s not all for just you.” The brunet shook his head while still watching John. “You keep amazing me, John, you really do. Just let me know if you get tired, please,” he added with firmness that John didn’t dare to dismiss.
Oh, this wasn’t his day. Lestrade was being even more idiot than usual, he had had to actually talk to
Then Sherlock took and left. All they got was an excited and frantic rant and a shout of "PINK!" and the brunette was off. John was left there with the confused team. Sherlock had been shouting at the top of his lungs, and now heads were peaking from every door.
“Brilliant,” John grinned, squeezing his hand a little. “It was very professional, especially you. I’ll seriously be surprised if she won’t cast you as Nutcracker next year, I really will.”
"I still love every bit of you, whatever happens, even if we never kissed again. I've probably said that before, but it's still true. I just want you to never be insecure about us ever again. I'm not going to leave you. You understand that?"
John had noticed Sherlock’s stare when he started to fold the paper back. Sherlock only noticed the tears on his own cheeks when John got up and crouched in front of Sherlock, his face looking as soft as ever.
?” John read out, chuckling and looking at Sherlock with a grin. “This is great, but how do you plan on getting to ‘cheerful’?”
Sherlock nodded, smiling gratefully and getting up too. “I’ll just check the dirt experiment things before you mess them up,” he mumbled, smirking at John and rushing to the kitchen, moving the tray with petri dishes on it from the kitchen counter to the dining table.
“I’m sorry, I probably should shut up n– “
As he climbed the stairs with the grocery bags, John wondered what Sherlock had come up with today. Realising all this had only been going on for a week now, John chuckled and shook his head as he walked into the living room.
“This is soft,” Sherlock said, feeling the material between his fingertips.
“Yes, I’m absolutely sure. If you’re uncomfortable with this in any way, however, we can stop,” Sherlock reassured, his voice low and soothing.
John knew that Sherlock had been sitting across from him when they’d gotten back from Scotland Yard, but he couldn’t be sure now, his peripheral vision seemingly becoming more and more hazy.
The feeling of gritty soil in his mouth made him want to be sick, and he coughed weakly in an attempt to rid his tongue of dirt, but he was still far too out of breath for it to make much of a difference.
“Yes, it’s very commendable. Now go and pack your things; we’re leaving in an hour.”
“Oh, yeah. Not sure if you know her or not, but she’s really nice. It’ll be fun,” John said.
John immediately turned around and followed Greg’s line of sight, and there he could see Sherlock, swallowed up in an oversized black hoodie and sitting with his knees pulled up to his chest and chin tucked in between his legs, clearly feeling somewhat out of place.
me?” He demanded, sounding more affected not by John’s condition, but by the fact that his friend hadn’t confided in him.
“Do I have to go?” Sherlock whined, still holding onto John. “My flat’s so
“Mycroft’s people left it here. He’s knows me so well,” Sherlock drawled sarcastically.
John’s eyes were locked on the lanky man with a mop of dark, curly hair. He was sure he’d seen him around campus before, but never caught his name.
“Making deductions, you mean?”
John was leaning up against the cold brick of the flat when Sherlock stepped outside, breathing heavy clouds of smoke into the evening air. The doctor had planned on hailing a cab for he and Sherlock, but decided against it when he realized how incredibly difficult it was to spot a black cab in the almost jet black veil of night. He knew, in the back of his head, an appointment with a doctor was an inevitable necessity, but instead he scolded the logical side of his brain and pushed those thoughts aside.
“I am, in more ways than you know and if it’s perfectly alright with you, I’d like to keep the few parts of me that still function properly for as long as I can.”
John happily tucked into his meal and proceeded to give Sherlock an enthusiastic play by play of his rugby match in between bites of shrimp and noodle. Sherlock told him that one of the players on the other team had had a weak knee and that one of them had recently gotten over an ankle injury of some kind, which was of little use now that the game was over, but was still interesting to hear how Sherlock had worked the information out.
“Got it,” he said.
“Do you need water? Your mum said to give you water when you wake up. John?”
John walked out of his psych lecture the next day unable to keep the smile off his face. He kept his grin as he walked to the rugby pitch where he and Sherlock had agreed to meet before walking to Hudson’s together.
After another minute or so, Sherlock brought the piece to a close with one final stroke of the bow.
John took a deep breath.
“Yeah, well, there you go,” John finished sadly. Sherlock could tell he was verging on falling asleep again.
“What?” John asked, looking at the garment as if he weren’t sure what it was for.
“The television. Please could you turn it off. You’re clearly not watching it and I believe you’re sitting on the remote.”
And just like every year, he was wrong.
“John?” Sherlock asked.
“Come on, up now,” Sherlock said, taking his friend by the waist and hauling him up so he could slide off his jacket. John kept his eyes closed, looking thoroughly exhausted and generally disgruntled.
“Stop right there!” Sherlock shouted.
“Mike!”
“This one here, the lion, what’s it for? I keep trying to deduce it but I can’t quite come to any conclusions,” Sherlock said.
“Did you
“Eight,” John parroted with more confidence.
“You listen here, you slimy little shit,” John growled. “If you ever come near Sherlock again, I will personally see to it that your life is a living nightmare, understood?”
He was becoming a bit of an expert at hiding his symptoms from his flatmate, considering the fact that he experienced many of them on a normal basis anyway. Things like the drowsiness, the irritability and the inability to focus were often caused by the stress of cases, and so they were a lot easier to get by Sherlock.
“No way. I’m not going anywhere until you get your crazy arse off the field.”
Attempting to shake the unwelcome nerves, John threw off his duvet and practically jumped out of bed. He quickly changed out of his pyjamas, stopped off at the loo, and headed into the sitting room to see if Sherlock was up. Knowing him, John thought, he probably would’ve already turned the kitchen into a makeshift lab.
As he slid off John’s shoes, he could hear him moaning in protest, grumbling something under his breath.
“Mrs. Hudson, my landlady, she showed you in?”
“It might be better if we sat down.”
John looked to the piece of paper in front of him and stared blankly at it for a moment, his mouth hanging open in quiet disbelief.
John laughed. “Just making sure. It wouldn’t be the same without it.”
“Am I hearing what I think I’m hearing?”
“Ah.”
“Clearly,” John mumbled, half asleep by the time the word left his mouth.
“How can you not know?”
John nodded his head in thanks and looked back out the window at the lights of the city rolling by.
John smirked. “Well, the sentimental side of you was right. You should listen to it more often.”
“Can you deduce what I want to do now?” he asked, staring down at Sherlock’s lips.
“John, you would say that we’re…friends, yes?” he asked.
"Earl Grey for me, please." Sherlock muttered, already delving into a dusty book.
“Please say something,” John breathed. He knew he shouldn’t have done this. He knew his scar was always too much for people to take in. After he’d been shot, after the infection, after all of the work the doctors had to do to piece him back together, his shoulder was not a pretty sight. Glancing at it in the mirror every day was hard enough sometimes, so he supposed he could understand Sherlock’s reaction.
“I got Chinese,” he said. “That things with the noodles that you like.”
Sherlock continued to stare into the lenses of the microscope.
Sherlock turned the television off.
“The bathroom is down the hall, the bedrooms are over there, and all of that nonsense,” Sherlock said, waving his hand around in arbitrary directions. He was dressed in a navy blue dressing gown that hung loosely off his shoulders and billowed around his ankles as he moved.
John shifted awkwardly in the sad attempt at a comfortable chair and clenched and unclenched his fists.
“I’m going to read to you, obviously,” he said.
“Yes, I’d like that.”
Sherlock didn’t answer, he simply furrowed his brow and closed his slack jaw. John could practically see the wheels turning in his head, struggling to formulate something to say. He was probably trying to figure out how to say something without offending John, but to no avail, apparently, for he cast his eyes downward to avoid looking at John.
“It’s all right, John. You can relax.”
“Then what are you saying?”
“John!” He called out into the almost-darkness.
John turned his head and let out a breathless laugh. “Jesus, Sherlock, I’m not twenty years old anymore, okay? And yes, ‘obviously,’ I know, of course I know that. But this...it’s like a flashing reminder that pretty soon it’s not gonna be just my eyes, it’ll be my shoulder or my leg, or my bloody hand that still shakes sometimes, and then—“ he stopped short, putting a hand to his forehead and taking a deep breath.
“Possibly.” Sherlock smirked.
“What?”
“Wasn’t you fault,” John interrupted.
“Tell me what happened,” Sherlock said as he examined his friend.
“What did she say?” Sherlock asked, watching John closely as if to make sure he wasn’t overstepping.
“Right, sorry.” John cleared his throat and awkwardly adjusted himself in his chair. “You’re right, though. I could honestly give a toss about having to wear glasses, but…”
“You think it makes you seem weak, vulnerable. It doesn’t.”
“And why not?”
“I don’t know what’s got you so wound up. Why does it bother you so much that I’d like to avoid any more time in hospital for the foreseeable future?”
“Sort of.”
“Aren’t you meant to be the one apologizing?”
“People from uni. Said I should take lots of shots so I could be like a real scientist and get more data.”
John blinked slowly into consciousness. The harsh fluorescent light that greeted him stung his eyes and caused his already aching head to throb.
John just shook his head lightly, got up to retrieve the bag that Sherlock had packed for him, and headed into one of the bedrooms.
“Of course it is,” John teased. “And I’ll just be over here in my tiny Mind Flat where there’s never enough room for everything.”
“Is papa okay?” He asked, his worry evident in his eyes. Sherlock should have known he’d want to know exactly what was happening.
“Ch’nge it, then,” John muttered without looking at him, his voice low and strained.
“Yeah, sorry, mate,” Mike said. “Well, you know where I am if you need me. If you ever need to talk or, y’know, gush about his eyes—“
“John.”
John lifted his head up and turned to Sherlock. “All this time…you thought I was just, what, pitying you?”
I’m all right.” He smiled.
John was smiling to himself when he heard familiar footsteps behind him. He turned to look at Sherlock, who was dressed in an oversized jumper and what looked to be a pair of John’s pyjama bottoms that came up a little short on his legs.
?” He asked himself. “Of course everything makes sense now, but why would you hide this from me? You could have put yourself in serious danger, John, are you that dim? No don’t answer that. Have you even been to see a doctor? Never mind of course you have. Why didn’t you
It was creeping up on midnight when the film finally came to end, Sherlock having paused it multiple times to make deductions about certain characters, and John then keeping it paused to tell Sherlock more about the history of the franchise. And Sherlock had either properly wore himself out making deductions, or John’s little history lessons were more boring than he’d thought, because Sherlock had ended up falling fast asleep during the last ten minutes of the movie and was now slumped up against John’s side.
He pulled out his phone and held it off to the side of his thigh, trying to not make it too obvious that his attention was elsewhere. Once John saw who the message was from, he eagerly opened it and tried to keep his laughter under his breath.
“Gay. If you were wondering if what Sebastian said was true, it is.”
“Sorry, what?”
“Yes, very funny, let’s just keep this moving, yeah?” John motioned to Greg, letting him know it was his turn to spin.
“A good one. But he wasn’t the same, after, I mean. And I know you’ve seen some pretty gruesome wounds in your job, but it’s different when the person you’re examining is alive, and in pain, and a…and a friend.”
“You’re upset. Something’s happened—“
“Told me what? We talked about tea cozies for a good five minutes. I think my ears were ready to fall off.”
It took close to fifteen agonizing minutes for Lestrade to finally reach them, in which time Sherlock had attempted to get some sort of response out of John, but it was to no avail with John sluggishly drifting in and out of consciousness.
“There’s nothing ‘going on.’”
He grimaced and reached carefully into the pocket of his jeans, only to pull out a very broken mobile.
John only covered half of his face with his hand and closed his eyes. “I said not right now, Sherlock. Can you switch off for one night, just for me, please.” His voice was barely a whisper by the time he’d finished.
John immediately rushed forward to kneel next to the man on the ground. Everyone else seemed to be too busy ooh-ing and aw-ing to care about whether or not he was actually okay.
The duo arrived at Angelo’s just a few short minutes later and took the prime spot by the window. John set his cane down next to him, and so did Sherlock, as he had brought John’s old cane with him.
The driver must have panicked, because he took that moment to turn and run the opposite way, right towards Sherlock. The man, however, didn’t get to run even halfway there before he was shot with undeniable precision right behind his knee. He fell like a ton of bricks and John wasted no time. He hurried over and immediately whacked the man on the back of the head with the pistol, knocking him out on contact.
Sherlock once again did not join John in bed the next night, but John simply no longer had the energy to feel disappointed. Instead he felt strangely empty, the strange part being that the emptiness somehow made him feel heavy.
Sherlock very carefully extracted himself from John’s hold to put the next film in, and John frowned slightly at the loss of contact. He stared at the now empty space next to him and thought about how the night was almost over, and the next morning would be back to how things usually were. He’d have to get up early and try to plan out his day in a way that would allow him to get the most amount of work done.
“D’n want it,” John replied.
“Yes it was. And he’s pissed. He tired us out on purpose, I swear. And I didn’t even start my homework yet, and it’s due tomorrow, and now you’re here and you looked so
Christ, who was he kidding? This just wasn’t going to work.
But when John opened the door, the sight that he was met with was not at all what he'd expected.
“Thinking, yes.”
John walked across the room.
“No, I love it,” John reassured. He looked around the room, biting his lip and looking at all the effort and time that must have gone into planning this evening. “I guess I just…don’t understand.”
Less than a second later, Sherlock was opening his door without so much as a ‘may I come in?’ John huffed and warily sat up in bed.
“He’s got a pulse, Anderson,” Lestrade said.
“How did you know that?”
“I know, John, I know. Deep breaths, okay?” Greg had wrapped a blanket around his shoulders and had a hand on his back, rubbing soothing circles up and down.
John smiled sadly. “I know that now, but it’s still not easy.”
“I know, I know. I’m just…tired.”
“Is that why you didn’t go home?”
John stared at his phone screen for a few more moments in anticipation of a reply, but when none came he assumed that Sherlock had already dashed off to the kitchen and was hard at work experimenting with butter to sugar ratios.
John looked to Sherlock’s eyes for reassurance that this was okay, and when he got a small nod in response, he took the final leap and pulled Sherlock in to kiss him.
“How’d you guess?” John laughed bitterly. “Yeah, they weren’t too happy about it, to say the least.”
“We?”
“Yes.”
It was somewhere around one in the morning when Sherlock came up and tapped gently on his door.
-------------
“Who does?” But Sherlock already began to run off. “Sherlock! What mistake?” Lestrade yelled after him.
“Yeah, me too,” he said.
“John, my mother has invited me down for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. She’d like you to come as well,” Sherlock said the second John walked through the door.
Once they were properly engulfed in the crowd and wrapped their arms around each other, the music blaring from the speakers seemed like nothing but muffled noise, and the people around them seemed like nothing but blurs of colour as they danced.
“Good try.”
The two of them sat in their respective armchairs and watched crap telly as they ate, John smiling at the screen every now and then.
“God, I’m cold. Why’s it so cold out?” Sherlock grumbled as he aggressively got under the covers. Not in the best mood, then.
“Yes, well, only because you were sitting here,” Sherlock reasoned.
Sherlock grit his teeth in irritation. “What happened?” he snapped, stepping in a little further. “And where are Anderson and Donovan? This is a crime scene, not a romance novel. I hope to god they didn’t sneak into some broom closet. Lord help us all if—“
Sherlock sat down in a cross-legged position in the middle of the sofa and motioned for John to do the same.
Sherlock huffed and looked away. “Fine. Thank you for your help last night. And your hideous jumper.”
John sighed and attempted to get back to his reading, but was admittedly beginning to feel somewhat restless. He sat up, wiped the tired look from his eyes, and went to see what Sherlock was up to.
“I don’t want to,” he protested, his arm reaching out to grab weakly onto Sherlock’s sleeve. “We never get any time together, and now that we finally do, I can barely keep my eyes open. We’ve been looking forward to this all week. I’m sorry.”
“I’m sure your esperiments are quite good,” John teased.
“He was a Norwich terrier called Norrie,” Sherlock said. “Even if dogs could commit crimes, I doubt he’d be behind any of them.”
John rolled his eyes. It was just like Sherlock to spring plans on him the moment he got home from a long day at the surgery, but he had to admit, a quiet weekend in Sherlock’s cozy family home did sound rather nice.
“What,
“You’re all a bunch of pricks, you know that?” he ground out before walking out and slamming the door behind him.
“How do you mean?”
“You like him?” he asked.
“Relationships.”
“I’m not ashamed, I just…” He sighed, realizing now that the whole time he’d been thinking up ways to hide his panicking, he'd been breathing much too fast and definitely loud enough for Greg to hear.
“No, just- I mean, if having someone around will keep you from being bored, you could stay here. If you want,” John said, hoping his face wasn’t as red as it felt.
“Because you always fail to get back to sleep after a nightmare and I’ve been told that my voice can be quite relaxing.”
“It's never been this bad before, are you sure you don’t need to go to hospital?” Sherlock asked. He’d asked him earlier as well, right after he’d been hurt, but of course John had insisted that he was fine.
Most days, he sat and practiced braille with Sherlock, or the two of them would go for walks and get takeaway. Some nights they’d just plop down on the sofa and John would listen to the telly while Sherlock did research, on his own laptop.
computer!" John snapped, almost trapping Sherlock's fingers as he slammed the laptop shut.
“Never mind. Just stay there. There’s someone in the flat that I’d rather you not meet. Now go on, shoo,” Sherlock ushered John into Mrs. Hudson’s place, firing off a hurried explanation and quick apology to her.
“Your fingernails are groomed really neat, which is odd for a man, but…oh, your violin! You need to keep your nails short for playing violin.”
“One coffee, one Earl Grey, and two honey scones,” John said, placing Sherlock’s mug in front of him. “Black, two sugars, yeah?” he asked.
“I told you, I’m busy.”
“—but tonight I thought you might need some, er, support. Is there anything I can do?”
“Just move ‘em, m’not gonna break.”
The moment the door was open, Sherlock flew to John’s side and knelt down beside him, wasting no time in beginning to free John of his restraints.
“Could’ve fooled me.”
-------------
“All right, just sit here and I’ll hail you a cab, okay?” John said, walking to the curb and holding his arm out.
“Stop what?”
“In a way. I could see everything; the injury, the infection, the pain. It wasn’t like a normal deduction because it was
Upon returning to 221B, John breathed a bit in relief at not having to go to the store. He looked around their humble abode and licked his lips. For a moment he just stood and, for what felt like the first time, actually looked at the entire room.
“Apology accepted.”
After a few minutes, John slowly lowered the tissues, checking to make sure that the bleeding had stopped.
“Did I do it right?” Sherlock asked, his voice soft and his cheeks flushed a rosy pink.
“But what’s the occasion? Have I forgotten my own birthday?”
John was sat up in his bed, hand clutching his heaving chest as he tried to calm his breathing. It was just a dream, he tried to tell himself. Or maybe he was
“Mm. Can’t.”
“Explain?” John asked, taking a bit of a longer glance at his friend as he attempted yet again to decipher the colour of his eyes.
“That man was…dangerous. You could’ve…” he trailed off, looking to the floor.
This time, it sounded like John was trying to shout something at him and failing miserably. Then Sherlock’s phone buzzed with a text.
“He is, isn't he?” Sherlock shucked off his coat and scarf and plopped himself down into his chair.
This was not a good idea, John thought, as he continued to palm himself through his pants. He’d been at it for almost twenty minutes, trying to imagine the different scenarios that usually got him going with no problem, but to no avail.
“I’m no expert in this, you know,” Sherlock admitted.
This is pretty similar to chapter two, but I'd started writing this a long time ago and wanted to finish it up, plus I just really like rugby!John :) Also, I know I tend to write a lot about John being stubborn and not wanting to accept help, so apologies if my stuff seems repetitive, I guess that’s just a trope that I enjoy.
“What? Mike, no, it’s not- I don’t—“ John spluttered.
Sherlock moved the tea closer to John and got up to look through the selection of DVD’s. Once he found the bee documentary that he kept at John’s house just in case, he popped it in and turned all the lights off.
John was slumped over awkwardly, half leaning against Lestrade and half threatening to fall over. He was breathing heavily and his hand was fisted into Lestrade’s jacket, grasping it as if his life depended on it.
“Oh, I am. Pleased as punch, really.”
“Nope. My room; you know the drill," he said, careening his friend through the entryway to the kitchen.
“You like my romantic drivel.”
“Why the interest in cadavers?” Mike asked. “Not that I’m judging or anything, just wondering.”
John was just about to nudge Sherlock and drop the hint that he was ready to leave when Greg took a large swig of his drink, reached forward and spun the bottle way faster than necessary, laughing at the way it spiraled out of control. Then after finally coming to a shaky stop, the bottle pointed right at John.
“What sort of things?”
“Well, that’s all the ones on your back and upper arms, but I recall seeing another one when we were back at Greg’s flat. It was closer to your heart, yes?” Sherlock asked, leaning forward to try to get a look at John’s chest.
It had taken about another month before John was no longer able to clearly make out faces. That had been a rough day for everyone at Baker Street, especially Mrs. Hudson, who made John a tray of his favourite jam-filled biscuits, and cooked a wonderful dinner that even Sherlock sat and ate politely.
“What?”
The army doctor managed to get in a few jabs then, while the man was distracted with tucking the watch away. His hits weren’t very effective, however, and it only sent the man into another fit of rage as he got up and pelted John in the chest repeatedly with his heavy boot-covered foot.
John felt as if all of the air had been sucked out of the room. He stared unseeingly at Sherlock, feeling the pinpricks of tears forming in his eyes.
“Yep,” John said. He reached out to the plate of scones in the middle of the table and broke off a small piece. “These really are good,” he said as he munched on the pastry. “I’ve never tried these ones before.”
“Dear lord,” Sherlock mumbled.
“Hey, wait,” John called weakly.
“Yeah, ‘course. I've basically spent all morning thinking you found me revolting, of
“You’ve got an older sibling as well, yes? One that you don’t get along with.”
John’s jaw went slightly slack as he took in the sight before him. Their normally tattered, sagging sofa was now covered in what looked to be just about every blanket that the two of them owned. There were pillows piled up by the arms of the sofa and all across the back, and sitting on one of the cushions was a pair of John’s pyjamas; the ones he would wear when he had nothing planned and intended to relax all day.
“The doctors said that you would be fine,” Sherlock went on. “A few scrapes, some bruised ribs, broken ankle. Nothing to worry about.”
“Yeah, I suppose you're right."
Glad that Sherlock seemed to want him there for more than just book retrieval, John scooted his chair a little closer to him and leaned over to take a peek at his computer screen.
“I don’t need your pity. I’m fine,” Sherlock said, shivering.
John sighed in acquiescence. “All right, all right,” he said. “Thank you.”
John tried as hard as he could to quell the sudden pounding in his chest and heat rising in his cheeks.
“Okay. Goodnight. Come home whenever,” John clipped, hanging up immediately.
John looked down at his glass of water at the bar and gave a weak smile in Mike’s general direction. He wasn’t sure what he’d been thinking when he’d agreed to accompany Mike for a drink on a Thursday night.
“You.”
“You rushed towards an ongoing bar fight in order to help me, despite me being a complete stranger. You then helped me into the loo where you calmly and efficiently dealt with my bloody nose in the way one is actually meant to handle a bloody nose, as most people assume you’re meant to tip your head backwards when it’s in fact the opposite.
In the back of his mind, John knew that something was about to go horribly wrong. Because, honestly, what were the chances of something
“You’ve always got a class, John. You gotta loosen up, mate; you work too much.” Mike pouted like a child, clearly very close to being fully drunk. It was true, though, John had an especially full schedule this term and seemed to be doing nothing but working as of late.
“Not a chance, love.”
“Don’t be an idiot, John,” Sherlock said with a soft smile. “Nothing about you could ever push me away.”
The late afternoon sun shone through the large paned windows of the library, shrouding everything in a pale golden light as John and Sherlock continued to work. Sherlock had told John all about his experiment on some local foliage, showing him his notes and spreadsheets, and John had actually started his revising, finding Sherlock to be an unexpectedly helpful study partner.
“Yeah, you’re right. Well, um, goodnight, then,” John said, the words tumbling out of his mouth before he could stop them. His thought process was something more like ‘
John nodded to himself in assurance and made quick work of remaking the bed and packing a suitcase for the weekend.
“For me?”
“Sherlock, wake up,” John repeated.
“Mm. Good. And I’m assuming you don’t remember anything after taking the pill.”
John ignored him in favour of wiping the sweat from his brow and headed straight towards his gym bag.
John had Seb’s arms locked uncomfortably behind his back in no time.
John looked back down at his hands after Sherlock left the room. His left hand was staying still in his lap, his fingers curled inward. He knew that if he kept his hand in this position, it wouldn’t shake, but if he were to uncurl his fingers, the trembling would start almost immediately. He thought that maybe it’d somehow be easier to learn how to use his right hand for everything rather than struggle to control his left one.
“I never thought I’d say this, but I really have to thank my friends for being absolute arseholes tonight.” He laughed.
“I didn’t, actually,” John admitted. “Maybe I should. It’s been ages since I’ve talked to her. And I do miss her.”
Now John was on his way back to his flat, feeling lighter despite the heavy books in his bag weighing him down and a residual smile that wouldn’t seem to fade from his face.
John closed his eyes and clenched his fist before following behind him.
“I don’t. Your ‘Christmas spirit’ nonsense must be rubbing off on me,” Sherlock said.
“Did you hear papa, Hamish? He just needs a little nap for now, that's all.”
Sherlock looked away from the tap for a moment to turn to him.
He knew that the recent lack of casework was likely to blame for this sudden slew of nightly terrors. He knew it wasn’t healthy, but the rush of adrenaline and the thrill of the chase were what filled his veins with excitement and gave him purpose. And too much domesticity allowed for his mind to wander, to go down paths that he would rather not revisit. Or worse, to make new paths, ones which lead to dangers that neither he nor Sherlock made it back from; his body’s twisted way of saying that it’s
John! You’ve been pickin’ nothing but truth this whole time an’ now you’re just gonna leave? Let us have
“I beg your pardon? John, your cane was disposed of ages ago, why on earth would you need it now?”
As he approached the café, John saw Sherlock’s slightly silhouetted figure through the foggy glass and sucked in a sharp breath at the sight, his nerves all seeming to gather in his chest.
“Mm…don’t have friends.”
Sherlock knocked on the door.
“Ten.” John sighed with relief, slowing craning open his eyes.
“Yes, but he hasn’t got much time. The poison must take a certain while before it sets in. God, this is brilliant.”
“Well stop being sorry. We can still spend all night together. Even if you’re asleep, I’ll be here. Now, have you eaten?”
John laughed softly and wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s neck, pulling him in close. “I love you, you bloody git,” he said. He gave him a quick peck on the cheek before heading to the loo to change.  “And the movies are not terrible!” he shouted.
The last thing on John’s mind that night was sleep, it seemed. He stayed up and stared at the discoloured ceiling, only vaguely aware of the time passing. His old bed was smaller, so it didn’t feel as empty. He thought that maybe he should sleep in there more often.
John’s feet felt like they were made of lead as he trudged up the beloved and worn steps of 221B. His head felt heavy as well, like a grey sky full of dark clouds, full to the brim and ready to pour and yet not even a drizzle escaped from their grasp.
“The gun wasn’t even real! Oh hell, I could’ve just ran out! I was so wasted I couldn’t even tell! I mean, me, of all people should damn well know what a real gun looks like!”
He reached out and fisted his hand in the blanket, holding it like he wished he could be holding Sherlock.
“Sherlock?” he whispered.
Sherlock went back to the man’s body as soon as Anderson and his crew left the room. He checked his pulse again. It was still thrumming, but just barely. His face was pale, grey and lifeless. It was no wonder those teenagers hadn’t even checked if he was still alive before they called the cops and booked.
“Humour me,” John tried. The cab was waiting now, so he hoped that Sherlock wasn’t planning on sitting and sulking for much longer.
Sherlock made an unintelligible groan in lieu of a response and tightened his grip on John’s arm.
“Oi!”
“I could ask you the same question,” Sherlock said.
“All right. What else? Are you going to be sick?”
dare, c’mon!” Greg pleaded. John grit his teeth and mouthed ‘sorry’ at Sherlock who only rolled his eyes fondly in response.
John was sprawled out on the sofa, practically sinking into the cushions, his arms and legs lying limp and his face scrunched up against a pillow. He looked as if he hadn’t moved from that exact position in hours, and he didn’t even turn his head to look at Sherlock.
“Not what I meant.”
“Where the hell did you get a microscope?” John asked.
Another ten minutes of tossing and turning passed, and John was beginning to resign himself to the idea that he just might not sleep tonight, when his phone buzzed with a text. And another.
“Yes! Very good, John. What else?”
As soon as John closed his eyes and attempted to relax, Sherlock was back and tugging at the afghan that was tucked behind him, making him sit forward and grumble in frustration.
“I’m not sure that’s the best idea,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock took a slight step back and looked thoughtful for a moment.
Sherlock didn’t spare a second thought as he wrapped his long, cold fingers around John’s smaller warm ones.
(See the end of the chapter for
Breaking the news to the gang at Scotland Yard had been Sherlock’s doing, though in fact he’d only told Lestrade, with instructions to let everyone else know.
“What
“What’s the matter with ‘im?” Lestrade asked warily, crossing his arms again.
“Piss off, Sebastian.”
“Of course. And I suppose I should thank you for guarding my things,” Sherlock said.
John complied, albeit shakily.
When John received no further response, he pursed his lips and headed back to his room.
“I’ll make some dinner,” Sherlock said.
“My eyes could never deceive me, only people can, and their sad attempts at doing so do nothing but amuse me.”
“I had a bit of toast, John; we can skip the nagging this morning.” Sherlock mumbled with his eyes still focused on the computer screen.
“Exactly,” Sherlock said.
“You’re a med student,” Sherlock stated out of the blue.
“No, no, I’m sorry.” He soothed in a much calmer voice. “It wasn’t right of me to raise my voice, I’m sorry.” He looked to the other doctor again.
John pinched himself just to make sure, a bit too hard, maybe, but effective. Just as he’d predicted earlier, the pain in his shoulder was now reduced to a mild ache. He’d have some trouble lifting his left arm fully for a few days, but other than that, he knew he'd be okay.
Work didn't fair much better for John, as it seemed the only patients that were coming to him that day were of the screaming child or rude adult variety. Not to mention they were out of coffee in the canteen. Then, when it felt as if his day couldn't get any worse, he received a series of texts from Sherlock.
He closed the book and set is aside before deciding to get up and attempt to communicate with Sherlock again, if only to give himself something to do.
“Yeah, I suppose you already knew that,” John said. “I actually thought about joining the army at one point, but, well.” He frowned.
“The night you were abducted. Or at least I assume you were taken. Tell me what happened.” The taller man leaned forward, put his elbows on his knees and clasped his hands below his chin, looking eager to listen. John took a moment to compose his thoughts.
“Well it’s either you tell me or I sit here and deduce it because luckily for you my brain has been otherwise occupied these days.”
John was likely not in the mood to talk or accept any apologies, but Sherlock couldn’t stand to sit at the table when he knew that John was hurting somewhere else, so he got up and made his way to the gents.
(See the end of the chapter for
By the time they arrived back at the flat, John was exhausted. The pain medication John had taken at the hospital was making him feel heavy and sluggish, and more than anything, he just wanted to sleep.
“Not your waitress!” Mrs. Hudson shouted over her shoulder.
“John?”
“You seem to be angry with me a lot as of late.”
Unaware that hours had passed since he’d fallen asleep, John awoke to a light tapping at his bedroom door.
He hadn’t been able to stop thinking about his fight with John. They hardly ever argued, but they could both be incredibly hotheaded, so it was never a pretty sight when they did. And it wasn’t just the fighting; Sherlock was worried about John. He didn’t want to watch his boyfriend collapse from exhaustion in front of him ever again.
I wouldn't put it past Sherlock to do ballet on the dance floor lol. But anyway, I really hope you guys enjoyed this, it was a bit different for me so I was a little unsure about it, but thank you so much for reading and for leaving such lovely comments, and thank you again to notjustamumj for kindly looking this over for me! *hugs you all*
“M’fine, just got a little dizzy is all. Came outta nowhere.”
“Well, maybe I’m not—“ John was cut off when the people on the dance floor suddenly erupted in chaotic shouts and shrieks. He whipped around to see people fleeing from the floor where there was a small group gathered around some sort of fight.
Sherlock and John had been in and out of three cabs before they hopped into this one. They had questioned the first cabbie on the way to John’s flat, where he had changed his clothes and mentioned having to pick something up. Now they were nestled in the back of another black cab, with Sherlock eyeing the driver suspiciously. He’d given him a random address to somewhere nearby.
an upside to all this.”
It had been a few days since John had seen Sherlock, and he couldn’t deny that he was still interested in getting to know him, despite Sherlock stubbornly refusing his help.
“Oh, come
“So, you’re finally going to tell me what’s been ailing you these past few weeks?” Sherlock asked, obviously trying his best to be patient and not jump into a string of deductions.
“Romantic feelings.”
“This is part of what we do, John,” he said quietly.
“No, god, no. I don’t think that, I don’t, but sometimes it’s hard to—“ John sighed. “It’s not rational, I know. I know that you love me, and I love you, and I know that you would never…but the thoughts are still there, creeping up on me when it’s three in the morning and you’re wide awake and I can barely keep my eyes open.”
“Well, you boys let me know if someone’s giving you trouble, I’ll sort them right out.”
“Damn it,” John swore under his breath. He was seconds away from abandoning the blog post altogether when he heard familiar footfalls on the stairs.
John had to admit that he was actually a little nervous about seeing Sherlock. He had still seemed slightly guarded during their conversation at the library, and so although John genuinely enjoyed Sherlock’s company and wanted to spend more time with him, he couldn’t say for sure whether or not Sherlock felt the same about him.
“How’s that working out?”
make biscuits from time to time.”
John reached an arm out and sluggishly grabbed his mug, taking a few long, slow sips before putting it back.
“What, boyfriends?”
“Because you’re bleeding all over and it’s not sanitary, that’s why,” John snapped, leading him to the loo which was thankfully just a few steps away.
“I don’t think so,” John said. He checked his phone to see that Mike had replied already. “Oh, Mike says the room’s all yours. And he also says ‘tell him not to blow anything up like he did in lab last week.’” John looked up at Sherlock. “Do I want to know?”
After the anger coursed through John’s mind came the usual worry that something had happened to Sherlock, so he bit the inside of his lip, picked up his phone and called him.
“Just doing some composing,” Sherlock said.
“And what about yourself?” Sherlock asked. “Any definitive plans? Aside from being a doctor, obviously.”
When he entered the small, pastel-colored room, Sherlock took in the sight of Dr. Watson, fast asleep and hooked up to a few whirring machines. He stepped closer to the cot, biting his lip in impatience. He stared at the man, as if he could mentally will him to wake up. Knowing that he couldn’t, and that the fingerprints were being taken care of at the lab, he pulled up a chair and sat himself down.
The tremor in John's hand has returned as of late and it's beginning to wear on him.
“Sh’lock, I don’t feel good.”
“I er, I don’t know.”
He watched Sherlock carefully for a moment to see if he would tell him to kindly find a seat elsewhere, but it seemed that Sherlock either didn’t mind or was too absorbed in his notes to even care. John could see that the bruise on Sherlock’s cheek had gone down significantly, leaving only a small, washed out splotch of colour just underneath his eye. He was glad to see him looking better, even if Sherlock didn’t seem to care much for John’s concern.
“Well, you did get socked in the face less than twenty-four hours ago.”
“Could be better.”
“Alright?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock leaves John behind on a chase through the woods.
“That’s what you said at the café,” Sherlock said.
Slowly, John turned towards Sherlock and moved his hand away to reveal a rather innocent looking tattoo; it was just a simple black and white illustration of a honey bee, right next to his heart.
John cleared his throat quickly and turned his gaze back to the newspaper he was supposedly reading.
John took Sherlock by the hand and pulled him onto the dance floor, earning a few winks from his friends as he went.
John pulled out his phone from his pocket, intent on checking his blog for any comments, only to be stopped by the lack of internet connection.
“What? No, I’d just assumed.”
John heard the sudden crack of bone on bone and immediately ran around the corner to see Sherlock on the ground holding his hand to his nose while Seb stood over him with a still curled fist. John didn’t even think as he rushed in and tackled Seb to the ground before he could land another punch.
John began to run his fingers up Sherlock’s shirt, teasing at his sides.
John worried his bottom lip and nodded. “S’all right.”
“Can you walk?” Sherlock asked, holding his hands by John’s hips in case he needed support.
“You don’t have to,” John said quickly. “I was just curious.”
“John, there you are. I need you to—“
“If anyone else saw that cane,” Sherlock said, “they’d ignore it.” Suddenly that cabbie was getting out and heading towards the walking stick. “But the murderer,” The older man looked around frantically, and was just about to pick up the cane when Sherlock stood up lighting fast. “would panic," he said, tugging his coat on as he ran to the door.
