“I know
His mind whirls around.
Greg’s eyes narrow, gaze going from John to Sherlock and back.
She woke up a little after John went down for breakfast and to get some rest, and was surprised to see Sherlock’s face instead of her father’s. Not for long. She quickly asked for a hug, little hands opening and closing in need.
Sherlock rolls his eyes in exasperation, but then something breaks his resolve, and he just sighs tiredly.
They’ve been here for half an hour already. The tub is full halfway so she can sit on the bottom and still be above water. But she doesn’t budge.
John was the one lying. To himself. He had no right to blame Sherlock. Again.
John pauses at the doorway, a steaming cup of tea in each hand. Sherlock looks away. For a moment, there is stillness atop the oppressing silence. The ‘avoid and pretend’ that makes Sherlock’s ribcage seem as if made of lead.
“Tell her what?”
A mug, salvaged? No, cracked. The army one. Of course. Plate, chipped. Toast crumbs, everywhere. Everywhere. Too many. He pulled the edges of the cloth together in a bundle, tossed the whole thing on the table.
Sherlock watches the small waterfall that flows from the tap, pouring into the shallow puddle that has formed on the bottom of the tub. It sloshes, at first, to the left, the right. Spreading, all frothy and hissing. But as more and more fills the tub, its tiny roar grows deeper, gurgling, like bubbles blown through a straw.
Uh-oh, he was fairly sure he needed that talk. Much, much, much to resolve…
‘Real smooth, Watson. Real smooth.’
“How are you feeling?”
“I’m sure she’ll be okay. We can also run some basic check-ups if the doctor suggests we need to.” He gives a reassuring smile but it does nothing to persuade Sherlock apparently, because now he’s biting at his pads.
John had just smiled his obvious yes.
And cut.
“Of… what?”
“Rosie’s been-”
of March…’ John mouths the words with a frown. Hospital. Sherlock’s three months clean check-up. He glances up at the man, lowered eyes, unwilling to let the letter go, terrified. John bites the inside of his cheek.
“Want me to choose for you?”, John asks as he stands, a little comically in the constricted space.
“Every fifteen minutes, of course, John.”
John has stopped at the door, his jaw set, both fists coiled at his sides. All the warmth and tenderness has evaporated from him, leaving behind a man preparing for a fight, coiled like a spring.
did, than what she was prepared to do. She wanted to keep John with lies. But no… No he does not want to keep John. The idea that he might manipulate or force him into staying somehow turns his skin into cracked, torn leather.
“You have it.”
My beta saved you all from a potentially heartbreaking cliff-hanger so give them some love. (I [@angel-loving-star] wanted to stop at the knife falling so... yeah, I imagine you owe them if you've reached this point down here ^^)
Sherlock blinks -and this time he knows he is doing it.
Sherlock wonders what made John want to tell
Oh, the irony.
John takes the few steps to his friend again -Rosie’s family- and holds her to him; face crumpled and pleading.
“Hey, hey, Sherlock. Calm down. We’re not in a hurry here”
“Yes”
“Come on, Rosie... you liked this yesterday...”
“Yes. I would want that”
His fingers press and push. The door slides an inch -two- ajar. John pokes his head in from the small opening, blinking, adjusting to the dim light.
“I know but… it’s new. He’s…”
John brings the bedtable above Sherlock’s thighs and steadies the tray on it. Sherlock looks at it; or seems to. He’s not too far gone. He mustn’t be. John serves the tea and pushes warm toast on a plate in front of his friend. Thin, long, elegant fingers grab a butter knife. The gesture familiar, always done by him. Never someone else. Sherlock’s wrist trembles weakly. His fingers try to adjust.
“What if… What if she… Won’t… Be okay?”, John finally says. His voice is small, smaller than the pods of green on the branches, smaller than the pebbles that strewn the small path, smaller than the constellation of tiny freckles on Rosie’s cheeks. But it is bigger than John himself altogether.
At eight bites, his stomach rebelled. He kept a straight face when he wanted to grimace, nausea crawling up his throat, scorching. He must have closed his eyes briefly, for he opened them again to John’s soft “Are you alright?”
See you next Thursday.
John is taken over by a crippling worry working through his bones. His eyes wonder to all sorts of places around the room to avoid Sherlock. Had he done something wrong? Was touching not… His fingers twitch. Burn. He swallows. They had been casual all this while but maybe affectionate wasn’t on the table. Maybe it was forbidden. John is closing in on himself. Maybe Sherlock thought-
“Had to leave the chilli out. And some other things.” Sherlock’s teeth press over his lower lip in concentration, pouring some olive oil into the mix. John watches.
“Please..?”
He glances beside him. Sherlock is there. Steady, albeit quick of breath. John’s eyes scan down his figure. The scarf suits him. A pinch of colour. So different from the constant blue and its variations back in the day. He hasn’t been wearing one for ages; John doesn’t think. Since
sinking with him.
wasn’t normal. And I overlooked it. I overlooked everything….”
“She’s up to something”, John grumbles.
The room, as its owner, is filled with temperate energy. Colourful and warm, as welcoming as a home, so far from an ordinary doctor’s office that John wouldn’t believe it without witnessing it for himself. Even the ever-present tidiness of a person of such principle doesn’t manage to make it lose a hint of magic.
“There, take a seat. Rosie can play around all she likes.” She glances back at Sherlock who stays blessedly silent, intent on his target -a cosy armchair with an elephant pillow ‘Damn, I forgot her own elephant outside’-, and smiles. “She can stay wherever she wishes, of course.”
Theirs was a world of doing. Of micro-aggressions in the form of toes placed back in the microwave after they had been removed, of milk being bought in reconciliation, of a small violin serenade. In a way, they still do that; do instead of talk. It comes more naturally, in a way. But all the practice they have had means that they understand each other so well in the details but not at the core.
“Alright. We could start with that? What do you think? Mrs H. sent up some chicken noodle soup. Dinner and crap telly?”
John must have felt him, because his shoulder-blades curve inwards, his spine arching above the sink. Now he is all cornered animal.
“Mm?” He looks at Sherlock, lips parting after a small sip of murky liquid.
Sherlock snorts. “Don’t you think you’ve said enough for one day, Captain?” The word is blurted out before he can think about what he’s doing. His tongue dries up, and he wishes he could disappear in the cushions of the couch, crawl under the rug and just… die of hot-red shame.
Sherlock can breathe again. They both do, John’s breath a prolonged huff.
He doesn’t get any response but he’s not sure he shouted loudly enough. His vision is narrowed down to the white door still standing.
“What did she say?”
“You’ll know what to do”, Sherlock adds, to clarify.
“I am only asking to know the full picture, John. If you’re not ready, it can wait.”
Will he be successful though? Will he be enough? Will he do good?
“I am too old for this”, Mrs. Hudson grumbles with a dismissive, frustrated wave of her hand, when neither he nor John manage to say a word. She turns on her heel to head back down the stairs. “Two grown-up men not being able to put two and two together. Outrageous!”, her voice reaches them a few moments later.
“I can help.”
This time John doesn't walk away. He stays and waits for Sherlock to fall in step beside him. Sherlock feels as if he's walking in space; no gravity.
“You’ve made it clear, how I don’t have any say in this... But... I’m worried, you are destroying her life.”
“Did you feel something? Dizzy, light-headed, sick?”
“What is that supposed to mean?”
When Sherlock is getting ready to go to sleep, his head is brimming with images, cut stills of film. He sees John bouncing Rosie on his knees, his voice a little higher when he sings but with the same timbre. Sees Honeybee humming and clapping and giggling, blond and silver heads bent together, identical button noses rubbing against each other. And then the light of that memory dims. He sees John’s tired eyes, after he managed to finish Honeybee’s bath and put her to sleep, the creases on his forehead. Remembers Honeybee’s wailing, supple like a reed in the wind.
“No, I-…” Sherlock’s lips curl inwards a moment. “I understand. Truly.”
If there are alternate realities, then Sherlock has certainly, somehow, been transported into one of them. Perhaps he did drown. Lost his mind, without knowing when. Right. This won’t do.
Sherlock turns around. Honeybee waves, and he waves back. “Goodnight, Rosie”
“He doesn’t need to be cautioned by you. He knows me!”
“Hm?!”
Sherlock breathes in deeply. The next exhalation is slow, strained. Time to take stock.
, he will never deserve Sherlock’s acceptance. No one would accept anything from the man that almost killed them in an anger fit and that’s that.
“Yeah, right away, little one. I just need-”
He had been ten. He didn’t think. He knew. Of course, he knew. It was imprinted on him. In his DNA.
A week since John got drunk and Sherlock found him on the kitchen floor. A week since John asked him, in his sleep, to stay. A week since that awkward conversation, where Sherlock had seen that perhaps this, staying together, was a better chance for John than them going their separate ways just yet.
When she looks at him again, her eyes are the sky weighing on his shoulders.
. For it could only ever be him. His Sherlock. Theirs. John just needs to pay attention after all. Like always. He’s starved for knowledge all his life. His brain has proven to be a sponge, always seeking more. Excitement, fear, danger. He can venture to the unknown again. Can learn to be the father she deserves.
“I have… been keeping it… for later.” He tried but his façade crumbling was immediate; shoulders sagging, thoughtful.
Sherlock doesn’t reply, rummaging through the contents of the med kit instead.
John’s shoulders snap back, as if Sherlock had gotten a hold of them with his hands and yanked them back himself. The only response is a growl.
“Okay. Fine. You aren’t. If that will make you feel better”
“Three weeks ago.”
was killed? Maybe. He should have noticed Sherlock left Baker Street without one too.
That done, he has no reason he can think of justifying him being so tense. Again. It’s only when he paces around twice -without any particular purpose- he realises exactly how unsettled he is. John looks at his twitching fingers, contemplating. Rosie gives a small but louder sigh. His muscles relax that infinitesimal bit. He rubs his cheek, scratching the stubble that should probably be called a beard by now -because that’s what it is and he is avoiding the admission for days- and it hits him.
“I’m sorry, love, you’ll go back to sleep soon.” John whispers and secures the thermometer in her armpit.
They wait for their food and drinks, Sherlock listening but sometimes getting distracted by the question-marks floating around people’s heads, clothes, faces, as John talks steadily to Rosie all the while.
There’s a small groan and rolling eyeballs but John departs towards the stairs only when Sherlock picks up his cookie once more, sharing soft private smiles together.
‘I’m ready.’
John inches closer, eying the labelled compartments with suspicion.
Honeybee turns to grin at him, the brightest baby-smile, stuffed pink elephant in her arms again, her small nose a cute little button on her face. He is already waiting with his phone’s camera. He snatches the moment, Honeybee’s clear-sky eyes, just like her father’s in shape, the drawing in the background, the soft, rare February sunlight making the photograph bright and pastel both, not letting the life of the moment be left out of its still rendition. Time slows down, even just for a heartbeat’s worth.
Sorry for the delay, lovely people!
He took a deep breath. As novel as it was to imagine Sherlock asking him about love… He was right. Absolutely right.
To be what… What that day, that hated day of Sherlock’s birthday, he had said was the whole point.
But the way John’s eyes had crinkled when he said how he wanted to care, how it had not been pity, how he asked Sherlock if he remembered… Sherlock had seen the chance, the answer, and grabbed it, and held on for dear life.
He hummed in reply.
Yes, that’s Sherlock, crouched over the table. John looks at his watch, a sigh of pure relief inadvertently escaping his lips.
In love.
“I… I heard enough”
“Rest…” John whispers, closing his eyes and reaching. Reaching up and up. Fingers brushing over stubbly cheeks. Auburn. That’s what Sherlock’s hair had once been in colour. Like his facial hair. John would fall in love with him then and now and in between. All over.
John is already up, shaking his head, enjoying the protectiveness deep down. Oh, his overgrown child genius will never get old.
"We'll take a cab home", John adds, his voice honey-warm. Reassuring -orange, weirdly enough.
“I could stay with her. If… if you wanted me to”
She shifts, sniffs, small fists clutching at his wet t-shirt. When he pulls her away to coax in the bathtub again, she clutches his fingers tighter and the look on her face is pure and utter betrayal. She screams.
“John. What did she do?”
He knows Sherlock has a big brain. An unlimited intelligence. An extraordinary way of thinking. He knows maybe he’d have to shift back into all of it someday, when they’re all better and ready for it. He wonders if Rosie… if John himself, if both of them would be enough to keep Sherlock safe, keep him occupied, keep his content with life. He can’t help but do so… although he doesn’t mind -actually, he loves- if Sherlock went full back to crime-solving puzzles. Doubt still nags at him however. What would be enough? What would be safe? Would this ever work?
Of course, they probably did not discuss it because John will no doubt change his mind, sooner or later. It was one kiss, after all.  Could not really have meant all that much. Normal people see things like that in ways Sherlock cannot approach.
“John?” Sherlock’s voice is on edge. John makes sure to look at him.
“Already buttering her up, are we?” John grins, peaking with his head from the opening before letting Greg in.
Honeybee mewls and pushes away clumsily with a small fist against his sternum. Her cheeks, puffy with sleep, make her lips form an adorable tiny pout. Sherlock smiles at her, and she whines inquisitively at the new face, tilting her head to the side. Sherlock wants to murmur ‘it's me’
Had he meant to snap? Possibly. His anger used to be easy to rise, cold and refreshing when wrapped tight about him like a second coat, a plate of armour. Now it only left him barren, emptied, turned inside out.
“She thinks any symptoms must be due to some psychological response. But she will need more appointments to make a more informed judgement”
She pushes his hand away with a mildly annoyed frown, so much like his, that John’s heart flops.
“Seriously, you won’t trim that? Either of you?”
Sherlock’s ribs are making him uncomfortable, the result of a restless night. John instructs him to straighten his spine but keep it relaxed, that it should help. He notes that they could try purchasing an anatomic mattress and pillow, once Sherlock gets better. He speaks with concern which is genuine, even though Sherlock is poised as a hawk, prepared to trace any sign of self-hatred and guilt. John’s knuckles are still bandaged up. John’s temple still bears a faint, yellowing bruise, from where he had struck at his own head.
John smiles, hope rising in his chest, and she somehow -like always- sees him and smiles back. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t recognize the flash of pride growing over her features.
“I merely… Music. I mean, she needs a rhythm.”
He hands Sherlock his impromptu ice-pack, and they both hold their bags of frozen peas to their heads interchangeably for a couple of minutes as is proper but then focus on Rosie alone. It takes some coaxing and carefully crafted stories for Rosie to let them bathe her properly and wash her hair as well. She scrunches her nose when a bit of foam goes into her eyes but the shampoo is baby-safe for little sensitive eyes, and they just help her to wash it off without much fuss. She’s starting to feel more at ease, making small sounds while playing around her bubbly space with some of her toys and John can’t help but sigh with utmost relief. It was the worst torture to see her suffer because of his own incompetence all those previous bath times. He only ever wished for this. For something to change. And this is it.
Sherlock has pushed them to the point from which there is no return. But that’s exactly what now makes him take a step forward. And another. There is nothing that he has at stake, anymore. He may have lost John. But he cannot let John be lost.
John sees the beginning of a smirk on Sherlock’s thinning Cupid’s bow, the infinitesimal, trembling stretch of muscle.
“It’s quite alright.” John watches him, catches Sherlock’s fidgeting fingers with his gaze, arm crossed in front of his chest as his other -outstretched as it was, pushing buttons on the remote- rested its elbow on the bony wrist.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I should have noticed.’
Sherlock Holmes. Always proud. Always trying to act normal, quiet, reserved into his own world as if he’s solving a case in his head -but with no actual cases or experiments or anything to think of-, trying to reinforce John’s idiotic fantasy that everything is actually okay. Wasn’t this the definition John had given to his best friend -or whatever- himself?
“Just… let this not be messed up.” He adds as an explanation.
“I don’t want pity. Certainly not yours”
she? Was he
John chuckles. Sherlock has no idea why, but it is definitely not helping.
His best friend looks at him again, and this time, even though he still can’t wholly read his face, there’s something rather gentle there, if bewildered.
He doesn’t know if he can stand even it anymore.
His palm cups Sherlock’s cheek, and Sherlock’s gaze turns open, unguarded, shedding its cloudy veils like a flower losing its petals. It is all painted in bittersweet pain, with regret a sharper, deeper hue, and, underneath it all, is fear. It is a lingering, haunted kind of fear, the one only an innocent soul can feel. Sherlock looks both old and impossibly young like this. And despite the feeble light John can see the cracks and chips over his pale skin as if he were made of marble, the cracks where he was broken and yet put himself back together, over and over…
Any ironic mirth perishes. Sherlock looks down at his bare chest, with the scar at its centre, holds out his arms, sees the bluish-purple marks on the mangled veins, the thin pale scars that lie beneath like swollen latticework. It is oddly quiet, and there is a ringing in his ears. His eyes zoom out of focus, as in his dreams, where he saw himself through his eyes and from far away, too. And still his arms are odd, appendages stuck onto him, and their nerves buzz with stillness, with the fear that he would be unable to move them even if he tried.
. A confession of weakness. A recorded video of a dead person. It was all a problem now. A virus. John’s knowledge. It didn’t match well with avoidance. It never could.
A small pause ensued, as he pretended to contemplate a chopped mushroom.
‘Don’t press. Don’t press. Don’t press.’
“Every parent goes through that at some point quite intensely. I merely wanted to point out how well you’re both doing. Having reactions to each other’s actions, communicating.”
“I’ll get Rosie downstairs and then I got to dash”, John mumbles to himself. Sherlock looks down again, and shame begins to burn in his chest.
“I promise.” He breathes at once, chest puffing and shrinking with a deep inhale and an equal exhale, like a child preparing for the heavy duty of a promise, ready to fulfil it.
Again.
“Had a good night?”
He hadn’t been able to speak. He had stood up, and walked to the kitchen, and had known at once that the wall between them had been rebuilt and taller than last time, that what he had done could not be undone with a simple word. John’s shoulders were hunched, a wolf nursing and hiding his injured paw, and Sherlock had kept well away, as his mind kept chiming ‘don’t look, don’t speak, for god’s sakes, don’t be annoying’.
“So?” He wants John to feel the same.
Sherlock nods, shuffles, settles anew and nods again.
If he were polite, maybe?
“You seem different.” She prompted.
Fear is a black weight at the pit of his stomach. If he asked, John could see it as overstepping. As much as John was concerned, Sherlock was an addict. Pile that on all the other reasons why Sherlock had been deemed unfit of being within a ten-metre radius of a child. Of course, John had seen him interact with Rosie; had let him take care of her, while her mother was on her wild goose chase around half the world. But that was before.
Awkward. That’s what it was afterwards. Awkward and impossible. How could a coward ever find any courage to speak to a man that didn’t even look at him anymore? He had offered tea. Back to normal as always. Pretending nothing happened. Dancing around at the edge of thin rope. Broken hearts, the only resolution waiting at the bottom of the ironically bottomless pit underneath them.
“I am in complete control over my life, John.” She addresses him in a failed attempt to ignore Sherlock is right there, prying her open for the world to see.
Molly’s message still hurts, the words angular and steep. Sherlock lets them cut through his skin, and this time, pass through him, and let only him remain.
“Yes?”
He suspects she gets it from her mother. Not that he has any baby pictures or trustworthy memory narrations to prove it. He had been a bulky baby himself but it’s not like she lacks any plumpness and her cheeks are pink and soft and round. She just has this uncanny way of getting places no one expects her to. It’s quite endearing when-
. John lies. Their tones seem too much like their latest personal conversation for him to be able and utter the truth. He knows it might all go down a hill he’s not ready to face.
He winces. It’s raining. The fire remains. The teriffying feeling of helplessness. He punches the brick wall. Drags his knuckles over it. Scratches with blund nails. When he reaches the next road, his fingers are stained red. He looks down.
Then mellows, getting up. John thinks he can still see faint lines around his mouth’s edges, as if he’s trying not to smile, but he’s not sure. He hopes eating together is alright... As it always was. Once.
He hears a long-suffering sigh from the other end. He knows she’s trying to make him ask, be curious of what she thinks. He knows the trick. He won’t fall to her trap.
John tries to adjust his scarf with Honeybee strapped on his chest and reaching out to the soft wool with happy hands. Mrs. Hudson coos to her and helps him, efficient and sure, as she speaks. “That’s alright, I wouldn’t anyway. I will have lunch with Mrs. Turner. Her married ones have gone on a mini-trip, given the day it is and all… Oh hello, Sherlock!”
He has not felt fuller in his life. As much as he should try to stifle the excitement bubbling up in him, it is impossible; how, when John hugged him of his own accord, wrapped him close and squeezed him so tight Sherlock felt that he was being glued back together.
“Sherlock... I know you don’t...” John backtracks. Sherlock’s gaze is telling him to. His voice sounded too much like the ‘old John’ that had the right to give that ‘old Sherlock’ advice. The ‘John’ that had not yet been consumed by guilt, the ‘John’ that hadn’t hurt him.
He barks the address. They get on. The road quiet. Cabbie doesn’t ask questions. He kicks the boxes around the pavement later, frown at the fullness of them with his daughter’s cribs and cradle, baby-table and toys. He has no idea how he’ll manage to get them up. If he’ll be allowed to stay. It’s just after 6am. He has no idea if Sherlock’s waiting. Or even if he’s awake. Or if he remembers. Withdrawal can’t be good for sleep. John knows. He hasn’t slept more than two hours himself, despite the whiskey.
Oh. Oh, that was… different. Than what he expected at least.
His hand falls.
“Oh please.” He drawls.
He waits outside the closed door, shuffling his weight from one foot to the other. Too nervous to walk away, too giddy to stay. Takes in his surroundings instead. The corridor, just as it always was, smelling of a lavender candle in the one tiny high self just above his eyeline. A picture of a black and white forest accompanying the little flame. Constricted flame. Unmoving. Safe. The kitchen door, a few steps to the left, all in order. The carpet unburned, the wooden doorframes steady as rocks, the walls not crumbling in, their normal tapestries only destroyed where they used to be by none other than the consulting detective himself in his frenzy to avoid boredom. Not smoked. Not black. Not on fire.
Sherlock nods again. As if by some sort of secret pact between them, both he and Honeybee wait until her father has gone back downstairs before they look at each other. She is frowning. He can't but smother her in kisses until she smiles in delight. At least he still remembers how to do that.
“Ow” Sherlock stumbles a small step back.
“Ouch, Rose, could you-?” She’s let go already, clutching the hand he extends to her.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock?”
"Good". John's tongue brushes over his lower lip, and his eyes fall from Sherlock's face as he steps back. Sherlock can feel the heat of their gaze on his skin.
John’s fingers clench into fists. He’s working up to it. He can’t give her the satisfaction of seeing him defeated. He can’t let her believe she might win her childlike battle for dominance over a child she hasn’t even bothered to meet for years. Sober and all but she wasn’t even in Rosie’s christening and when Mary disappeared… where was dear big sister Harry then? Dear you-can-rely-on-me should-have-come-to-me? Where?!
No. That’s not true. That can’t happen.
“When you believe you need a session, don’t hesitate to ask for it, okay? We’ll find the time.” She always gets it when he’s done a ‘mischief’ like that. He hums, smiling.
But he’s dreaming. But he’s awake.
“Me..?”
Her angel-eyes look at him and hold him to his word.
‘Yes, of course I do.’
“Sherlock… This is serious”
“Can I ask you something?”, John says absentmindedly.
“You okay?”
His head spins when the second gulp is down as well. He held it in his mouth one second more, making a vain attempt to reconstruct the different tastes on his tongue. He’s much too needy for that to work, it seems.
“Thanks”. He recoils inwardly. He imagines John’s tired face, happy to see an old friend. Sees the dismissive flick of a hand as Sarah asked about them, perhaps about him, an upward roll of his eyes that indicated a weary acceptance of fate. He felt sick.
to reach.
He circles, slowly, until he is in front of John, a few steps away. He kneels, feeling the deep-sea eyes on him, but not trying to meet them. And then they’re both on the floor, opposite each other, and Sherlock feels he has to get to know the man in front of him all over again.
John hears from a not too distant memory. His hand is shaking, inches above Rosie’s fresh like flowers curls. He looks up at the two colourful orbs.
‘Very clever. Freak him out even more. Yes. Right.’
John runs. He runs through flames, he runs through walls falling down behind him, on him, melting. Exploding. He runs while his, their home is burned to the brick and he can’t breathe because the ocean around him is filled with smoke and liquid flames, because he’s drowning and the world is burned to ash around him at the same time.
“Thirty-eight point one!” John exclaims triumphantly.
One, only one feature of interest.
“Yeah?”
“Sorry I don’t. Um. Always know when I am doing it”
“We’ll work on that”, John asserts. Sherlock’s look must have been one of brief terror, because John chuckles. “That brain of yours requires a healthy transport, remember?”
“Sherlock?”
“And?”
This was a b******** to edit. Phew. It's finally done.
John glances at him.
It takes a little while for John to reply, but what he gives is the most tender “’salright” that Sherlock has heard before.
. Sound asleep against her father's chest in the baby carrier, all bundled up in a little fuchsia coat. Short sun-kissed curls a little riot on her head, small chubby hands curled into tiny fists beneath her chin, dimpled cheeks a lovely shade of pink. They're closed now, but Sherlock knows her eyes are bright and big and blue, like a clear morning's sky. She whines at something in her dreams, and her little button nose -the exact tiny replica of her father's- sniffs like a rabbit's. Sherlock’s brain whirs.
“I just want you to know that. She’s wrong. They’re
There is a hum before the indigo eyes meet his. Sherlock drums his fingers on the table-top in a silent, made-up pattern, as if they want to bridge the gap between them with every tap. “What happened?” he asks the wooden surface.
“I am here to see John Watson”, a female voice demands, angled and pointy like the claws of a cat.
Jacket off his shoulders, he takes the few steps up the hall, hangs it on the peg outside 221A and takes a tentative step to the door.
It’s like he is outside himself but he isn’t, he’s there, and this has been there, for so long, maybe all along. But he sees it, clear as day, he names it, and it only takes a moment for it to settle, to be born, reborn. So simple, painless, winter transitioning to spring, night to day.
Rosie’s wails can possibly be heard through the whole building. He tries to brush her hair, give her reassurance. She flinches away.
She mumbles more -non-reduplicated!- syllables to her pink elephant.
“How much?”, Mrs. Hudson calls from the kitchen.
Bing.
“Thank you”
“Where are you going?”, John calls when Sherlock is halfway to the kitchen. “Come here” His voice all but spells ‘git’, the way it does when he is amused, and fond.
‘These are not my arms’.
Sherlock, judging that he has no part to take in this conversation, and wanting to distance himself from what is potentially a line of fire, rises slowly and circles behind Mrs. Hudson and towards his armchair, ready to tiptoe if he must.
John shakes his head, a small grin on his face. “Well. I guess we are… Rather… Obvious. I mean-”
John shakes his head no. “It’s just that… She wasn’t babbling. She barely made a sound. She wouldn’t even
“Alright”
He had talked it over with Ella when he found the kind of therapist she suggested and he remembers how this particular one is excellent in her field and how he had been enthusiastic when first glancing at her work. She works primarily with ages under 10 years old and she has made her own home into a doctor’s office, because of the amount of schools and families around Northern Paddington in need of support. It was so successful that she now has another two colleagues working with her. John asked specifically for her however.
Until John blurted out the small confession about his parents. And then was silent again.
There is clatter coming from the bathroom as John settles Rosie in her baby chair, making sure she feels comfortable. John glances towards the corridor, but nothing appears to be fairly alarming, so he turns his attention back to his little girl with a smile. She looks away, a pout already set over her tiny -rose like her name- lips.
“How much?”
It slices through Sherlock like a knife.
She giggled, patting his cheek with a sloppy little palm and sticking her tongue between her lips playfully. He pushed some curls away from her face, sighing. God, he was tired.
Sherlock glances over at the set table, taking stock. “Think so”
“Come on, sweetheart, there you are, Papa brought you some-”
‘Mad. Totally mad.’
‘It was an accident- She’s not sleeping and I was worried and he was-’
John raises his hand. Stops; reconsiders.
John snarls at him. Sherlock winces. Neither of them moves.
“I’m afraid to leave her”, John murmurs, and his grip on Sherlock’s hand tightens.
“Oh.” He croaks in lieu of any other greeting. His gaze fixed on the bundle of colour in her arms.
“Finally found a brand she seems to like for breakfast”, John said conversationally over his shoulder, as a little bee licked her puree-stained palm.
He arrives at the clinic in a rush of coat and product-filled hair, his stride wider than necessary the moment stagnant hospital air and antiseptic fill his nostrils. The more he flees, the more his body and mind try to recreate the familiar image of his companion and friend at his side. Mannerisms, style, body language. It’s all in him. Like it was before, when he wasn’t fleeing from said companion, but from his fake death. This time around, he notices. He halts every movement and every word with a frown, takes a breath and starts again.
I see! Lucky little girl!”
“Um…” Yes. Twice.
His chest swells, filling with bright pink and blues and purples. He wants to smother her in kisses, he wants to show and tell the world how she is the most clever, sweet toddler, the brightest most playful little ray of sunshine, the most hardworking bee. No. Not the world -he doubts the world will ever deserve her. He wants to give her an audience of people who love her, of people with warm faces that smile for her, whose arms are ready to hold her and protect her as much as she is. He wants her to have a family, he wants her joy to be shared and multiplied and celebrated. Sherlock wants her to grow and feel that every stage in her life has been important, not only what she will be able to accomplish when older, some day in the future, but everything she has ever done, even, and perhaps most importantly, the seemingly trivial, simple thing of an abstract pink elephant drawing.
“I haven’t greeted you properly today, have I?” John leans against the counter, a hand scratching his nape.
“Why you don’t let her be alone with aunt Harry?”
“And I… I’ve been… well, I don’t want to be late again.”
does.’ This should not be happening this way. Everything that could be true and beautiful was marred. Every kind word and glance made Sherlock feel like the executioner, smiling sardonically over John’s suffering.
It rings, once, twice. Keeps ringing. Sherlock is sure that he should probably hang up and wait for John to call him back, when John picks up.
Sweet peppers and onions, paprika and coriander, sizzling chicken and a lemon cut at a corner, the garlic gloves at another, thin tortillas on a plate. Sherlock cooking, preparing their dinner. In his own words
“That’s the reason I am asking this now, John. You have stated before again and again how Sherlock helps, how he thinks you’re doing, how he encourages you.”
He thought... he thought they were getting better. He thought they were managing. For real this time. They looked at each other in the morning, they talked. A bit. Step by step, John felt getting closer to the real conversations lurking. His stomach a knot at the thought but he knew. He knew it was the right thing to do.
“What do you want?” she repeats. ‘Sherlock hates to repeat himself too.’ John shudders in the cold wind, feels it all win him over. The bar a few misty streets away.
She is sleeping.
“Got it.” He murmurs, then is careful to deposit the piece in the sink. He will clean that thoroughly later. The priorities have shifted now.
Sherlock’s nose scrunches up. “No. I haven’t seen Mycroft in more than a month”, he dismisses. His brother had done enough by clearing Baker Street of almost all his possessions and sneering at him on the drive home from the hospital after he was cleared from rehab. It’s an understatement to say he has not missed his presence.
“John…”
The voice rasps and he is thrown back to reality, to his sister, to his anger, his slow progress, their home, their healing, their family.
John did have to be sick after all, a little after their conversation.
“Sherlock.” A breathless gasp. A drowning man calling for his saviour, the one he tried to save from the flames in his mind who, it is quite apparent now, is in no real danger.
But John will tell him. He’ll tell him everything. Every little bit that made him lonely, closed off, angry and sad and who he is… who he wants to be… what he feels… It doesn’t matter if he’s brave enough or not anymore. He’s gone and done it. He’s gone and fallen in love. Admitted it. He’s gone and pressed his lips against another man’s. A most desirable lip-lock. What he’s been craving for years. Just once. Just a kiss. And there is was. And here he is. Fussing about in their living room.
“Are we done?” He leans on his desk, crossing one arm over his chest.
“Made breakfast. Hungry?”
Just like that.
was to blame,
“You’re- You’re taking her up?”
“Sherlock?” A finger brushes a circle over the shorter of Sherlock’s hair. “Sherlock, breathe for me? Please?”
“Nobody is
“Sherlock?”
“Enough.” John shouts, standing up, fists clenched. He wouldn’t have this. Not anymore. “Stop it, Harry. Just stop.” But apparently, he hasn’t shocked her into silence. Even then.
John looks at him, opens his mouth, closes it again. Sniffs.
He might as well give up now on this whole fatherhood thing. Clearly, it doesn’t suit him. He can’t even calm her down to have a bath. A fucking bath! It doesn’t matter how he does it, she just doesn’t need him right now. He is not helping.
John silences him. A finger over surprised lips. It lasts less than a second.
That doesn’t mean John isn’t worried though. He had opened the higher cupboards, searching for the bitter taste of alcohol that shouldn’t be there, three times in an hour. Most than he had for a week. Of course, the cupboards were cleared and of course, he has at least that much self-control left to not go to the shops to find some.
Sherlock’s head snaps, eyes drilling holes in John’s forehead, lips curling to a self-mocking smile.
“That. That would be. Good.” Sherlock frowns, pausing, as if having a problem gathering his words in a way they work together.
“Alright then. Before we start, this is a session for us to assess the situation. It’s collective work but none of you -Rosie included- is expected to open up immediately. For now, general information will do. If there are any key details missing, I will ask specifically. Sound good?”
The world is foggy as his eyes flutter open to let the dull morning light enter his indecisive irises. He can’t make his gaze focus, his surroundings painted as black and grey shadows in his mind. His temples are aching, and his heart is clenching, skipping a beat every few seconds at small flashes of scorching heat and flames, of dark figures he tries to catch, to follow, to save, before they run into the fire or fall from the precipice.
“Ugh…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I just want her to leave us alone”, John says. It sounds like a decision.
words,
He remembers what happened in the morning. What seemed like an attempt to reach out. Of course it wasn’t. What a ridiculous thought, for something out of the blue…. It could be a test.  The last straw. How could he not have seen this before? Sherlock scoffs.
“Alright. Maybe later.”
It was surreal. Sherlock closed the door of the bathroom behind him, and slowly peeled away his shirt and dress trousers. Entirely surreal.
Sherlock watches as John breathes, tries to work his way through his thoughts. He was not expecting him to reveal more, when he speaks again.
His eyes caught his reflection in the mirror above the sink. The lines around his mouth hardened.
‘We’re a family.’
Sherlock nods, even though John can’t see him. John never had the most amicable of relations with his sister. Sherlock has never met her before. She wasn’t present at the wedding, at Rosie’s baptism, and John barely ever mentioned her at all. Sherlock doubts she has ever met her niece.
“As long as it’s not that horrible agent film… The one who has the number-”
“God fucking damnit. God damnit, enough, enough,
The water stops. Cut off. A tap turned off. John is sighing into a peace that would soon be broken. By his mind.
“Thirty-six point six.” He whispers deliriously, as if in prayer, looking at that point of Sherlock’s button-downs that is always open and patting his palms over his shoulders, reassuring. Giving and taking comfort. Equally. As always.
John rolls his eyes. ‘Come here, you git.’ He pulls him in, pulls him close, presses a kiss over the curly head, totally incredulous by the turn of events, squeezing tentatively until Sherlock grumbles and pulls away free.
“Yes, that…”
“John, you are my
‘You lost this too.’ He recognises. As if speaking out loud. But it’s just a thought. Leading to another.
She doesn’t respond for a second or two and then she headbutts him with her forehead, a small round cooing sounding escaping her full with breakfast mouth before she swallows. John takes a breath as he straightens up, hands behind his back, glancing over at a very attentive Sherlock making their own breakfast.
Mrs. Hudson opens the door for them, waving goodbye. Honeybee whines and reaches for her, but John keeps her steady in her baby carrier and instead shows her how to wave back.
“I didn’t know -hadn’t noticed, maybe didn’t care to notice- he could feel things… this way… Now, faced with it, with how important it was to him to know -explicitly- we were actually still friends…” He stopped, focused on Ella again and didn’t continue.
John nods, but instead of going to his armchair, he makes for the couch. “Off…. Off!”, he mock-commands, shoving Sherlock’s legs off it, and then sits in the space they occupied. “Here”, he says, patting his lap. “Bring those here”
“We could feed them, maybe?”, John tries to say calmly, but his words are punctured by his uneven breathing. It sounds like a peace offering. But he is still a step away, eyes also following the squirrel as it searches the ground, and then finding what it was after, hopping onto its tree and disappearing amidst the branches.
. In the real world, John is the sun, and Sherlock just another planet, a stupid moon, ever orbiting around him. In the real world, John will go whenever he chooses to, and Sherlock will stay behind.
He hurt Sherlock. John hurt him.
“But-“
Sherlock nods, biting his lip. John’s palm brushes over his back, goes round and round and round in circles, tracing patterns. Sherlock’s breath eases a tad more, even though he averts his gaze.
TW: we are moving to a point where homophobic slurs and homophobia -in the past- might appear here or there. So be careful <3
be different. Will it?
“Yes. Fine. Um, she hasn’t started to talk.” He nods after finishing the sentence, as if saluting his words, steeled with determination once more, looking straight ahead.
Every time John is home, Sherlock retreats, leaving them father-daughter space -or so John supposes. But still, it’s a weird kind of retreat, one that feels forced and accepted at the same time, one that speaks volumes. John worries and he knows, whatever this is, he needs to fix it. They need to. Sherlock is her godfather after all and above all else, he’s family. Rosie’s little family. She’s going to need as much as she can get.
John inhales.
“My point is... We talked about her being a late talker. You know, she should have started by now.” He can’t hide his nervousness, of course.
John appeared in the doorway, two white and red plastic bags of Chinese in his hands. Time slowed, and stopped, and reversed, and the John he saw was six years younger, a careless smile on his lips and his hair messed from the winter breeze, as Sherlock helped him carry the food to the table and announced that they had a new case.
Rosie giggles, startling them. She grabs her feet with small fingers and giggles again. Sherlock steals a glance at him, and John returns it, pain forgotten for a moment and they are transported back in time, leaning against the hall’s wall, laughing panted breaths, shoulders bumping together. In no time, they start giggling too.
“Morning.”
“Yes.” John’s nod is curt. Rosie is still and silent against his chest. Utterly.
“Oh.”
“It does. To me. It does.”
Rosie’s big smile when he raises her over his head and flies her around the room for good morning gives John another cherished moment to be grateful for. This time, he takes it in, no regrets, no hesitation. The past few days have brought a change in him he couldn’t anticipate. It is a burden lifted from his chest. Confession by confession. Word by word. He knows now what made him hesitant to be grateful before. What made him seek for more. It’s not that he merely wanted more. It’s not that he was greedy. It was only an honest wish to be honest. To be carved open. Even if Sherlock decides to not want anything more than what they have in the end, John will be grateful for it. He will be happy. As he already is now. Content.
“I’m getting you some breakfast, alright?” He didn’t expect an answer but… one could hope.
He emerges at three, and the world is quiet. The light does not assault his eyes. His mind has gone blank, lulled. A new weight has settled in his stomach, an anchor. Acceptance. Of the things he can say, of the things he can’t. The things he is and can’t be. And of the things he will have to face. It’s eerie, settling over his skin like dew, like a million tiny moths.
How much? Notes or coins? How do tickets work, by journey, route, line? He keeps his gaze locked on the target and pushes through for what seems like an eon until, like a drowning man clutching to a raft, he has reached the first machine. Queue? Scanning the surroundings like a deer at headlights. No queue. Sigh of relief. Surely there is no queue? Blue, sweaty doubt. Okay, no queue. So, no one to watch and copy. What if there is a queue after him as he tries, and they look to him to watch and copy? Sherlock realizes that he may have been standing there like an idiot for too long and begins to follow the directions on the touch screen, feeling that his every movement is festered with crawling ants, that his hands are weighed down by millstones. Is he too slow? Too fast? Should he press confirm here? ‘Think, dammit, think!’ What if they're watching him? Bloke in a long overcoat, collar turned up, sunken-in face of a junkie, of course they're watching him. His eyes flick to the corners of his vision, left and then right, quickly left again. He feels someone behind him, and his left hand convulses. He shoves it into a pocket, worried that someone may call security if they see the tremble. ‘Weirdo’. ‘Freak’. Every whisper and word and laughter around him turn into a storm of crows that flocks around him and pecks at his clothes, his hair, his face. ‘John!’ But John isn’t here, he’s back there, far away, too far away- Come on, print the damned ticket already! There! He snatches it, is very careful to collect all change so that no coin falls to the ground and he'd have to either bend to pick it up or ignore it -and maybe have some idiot run after him to return it, so that he’ll have to face hot, red shame. He turns, breathless, fights to spot John amidst the crowd. Did he leave? Did he not wait? Had it taken so long? But no, god, there he is! He’s reading the Tube map and pointing the stops to Honeybee. Sherlock feels as if his body has been placed in cool, tender water. Now he only has to make it back. He hurries, ticket held tight in his gloved fingers, eyes locked on John's index as it paints an airy map of the Tube lines.
‘Oh, hush.’
“I lost my patience with Rosie in the morning. Threw an anger fit. Sherlock was there...” he loses the words, remembering the terror.
Avoidance.
“You did not trouble me, no”, John shook his head emphatically. “And really, sod breakfast. It’s fine”. He smiled. Sherlock felt it a little weird to be smiled at so much, like being given too many things to hold with only two hands. But John was already speaking again. “What matters is how you’re feeling. How you can feel better”.
John hides his grin behind a palm, their gazes falling on each other and retreating in a rush.
Mrs Hudson hasn’t returned yet and the two tired bachelors climb up the stairs, pulling away wet coats from the rain that had started before they arrived. Rosie is placed in her warm cot, the baby monitor set on the coffee table and John starts preparing their tea as Sherlock changes into pyjamas and curls on the sofa. Their private new custom of chamomile makes them smile again, easy and wide as a bird can spread its wings.
The desert shining in front of him, leaving him momentarily at a loss of breath. He recovers, swallows, focuses on the mantelpiece of the far wall, hums to himself, reassuring, making sure this is reality again.
John sees in him a friend. John trusts him. And that is enough for Sherlock. It truly is. At this moment, with Honeybee asleep and safe in his arms, with John beside him, he feels strong. He feels better, better for once being tangible, real. He knows this will not be enough in the long run, that the hole in his chest is never quite appeased. But that’s alright. For once, he thinks he has found a reality where he can belong without the pain being as sharp.
Sherlock swallows. Greg’s gaze at the little plushie beside him on the cushions.
Today will be different.
“Sherlock… She’s going to be alright. I promise. We’d never let anything happen to her, would we?”
John nodded, picking up a piece of orange chicken.
Until he is provoked. Then he will lash out relentlessly. And to obliterate. In this, John is viper-like. Grants no second chances, aims to kill. At least there is an honesty to this. No keep your friends close and your enemies closer with John Watson. Sherlock knows this. He has seen it all before.
“Oh god.” He turns to Sherlock, seeking answers. “It was you.”
Still, it didn’t stop him. He had managed to drink his full in that unimportant dinner (which could have been important… for him… If Sherlock just talked to him… If he just as much as looked at him…). It had been dull. Slipping more whiskey in his glass when no one was looking. He wasn’t successful on keeping it a secret of course. It was difficult enough to escape the gazes of three companions that rarely spoke, even without one of them being Sherlock Holmes -exhausted-, the other Molly Hooper and the third an overprotective housekeeper that had taken on the role of his grandma. As much as he’d like to be discreet about his drinking habits, nobody was buying it.
“Yes, Rosie?”, Sherlock responds without missing a beat, now on his armchair-sofa part of the route.
Guilt shoots through, a beacon in the dark. John has been making breakfast every day, looking after both him and Honeybee, trusting him, not pitying him, getting better. Sherlock should be happy, should be grateful, and yet, all he can give in return is- The light is snuffed out, and there is nothing stretching the surface from beneath once again. Look what a waste of time, the mercurial liquid sings. Waste waste waste.
“It matters enough”
John coils into himself again, just as he had begun to loosen up at the seams. “Leave it, Sherlock”
“How’s Rosie doing?” Ella asks after a moment.
But for John that’s impossible to believe and has been since forever. Silence descends again, broken only by the soft clings and clangs of cutlery on plates.
Until.
Doctor Chloe types for two clicks on her laptop and then joins them in an armchair opposite. ‘Familiar enough.’ Her fingers coil over her torso as she looks them over once. John can see Sherlock through the corner of his eyes, giving their slowly emerging budding flower the elephant pillow -so much like her little plushie- to hold close.
It shouldn’t be news, but it hits him like a wave. Sherlock is tired. Not the kind of tired John usually remembers fondly. The kind that has him slopping on the sofa as an adrenaline come-down settles in after a chase in London’s streets. Neither the hyperactive detective kind, not getting enough sleep in the middle of a case, brilliant enough to occupy his mind through endless hours of wakefulness in his early thirties without a hint of slowing down, finally dozing off anywhere he could find with no care for the world. It’s not the kind of tired he was when he couldn’t sleep well because of his body still trying to recover -although that might be part of it even now.
“There’s a canteen, I think, or café nearby”. John’s voice is still panted. “Cuppa?- Oomph!”
She said “save John Watson” to him. She said “go to hell”. But was it just that? Was Sherlock sure in his drug-addled brain that John could be saved? That John was worth it? That John would come?
John’s heart clenches with what he sees in them. Wonders if it had always been there, how many layers it was under for him not to have known. Not to have known all along.
“John…” Small. Drowning.
John is about to walk away, his chest feeling strangled by chains, but she continues.
John wants to kiss that throat, the hollow of Sherlock’s neck, see what he does in response, what he feels, if he feels…
She threw the spoon on his shirt with a gurgle. At the same time, Sherlock’s door opened with a thud.
He had almost forgotten how this worked.
Long day.
He cannot open his eyes.
“Oh, lovely” Of course it does not take long for her to spot Sherlock in his hide-out. “Everything well, Sherlock?”
Sherlock’s jaw clicks into place, letting silence fall.
John does. He raises his head, his eyes. He looks right into deep blue oceans, dark with the shadows of their waves that can surpass anything. And they do.
Soft. Tentative. This was the way the not-real John sounded. Feeling the real sounds was a revelation, like adding flesh to barebones. The vowels were livelier and thick, the consonants definite and full. It was heady. It got straight through him, a jolt under his skin.
“Sherlock, can you hear me?”
“We sure will, young man. Sure will.” She rushes downstairs with her wobbly gait and John rolls his eyes. He’s not

… I used to fill the tub and sink in to my ears. The only world I wanted to concern myself with was that one. The silent one. Underwater. No arguments. No screaming matches. No fake, teary apologies. Just… a void…”
“Welcome home”
“But, if you need-”
And then John seemed to reach out. To care. It gave Sherlock hope. Perhaps, with time, things could be better; the silences could be bridged, the words be less restricted, the deep-sea eyes sometimes dance his way. Then the things, the not-good things Sherlock had done, could stop to matter so much; he could be worthy of something, once again.
Out. Out of his fucking damaged seflish prick of a brain. Somehow, he can be better, can’t he? Everyone can. Why not him?
“I woke early.”
“Got him? Yay, there’s a good girl. Come on, your turn, Sherlock”
He has not slept peacefully in a long while. It is a sensation he had thought he would not experience again, and it is elusive enough that he was even missing it vaguely, unable to pin it down. And yet, it feels like only yesterday.
The warm, deep baritone easing the tide inside him. John does not know what Sherlock means. A mystery, always. Ever just out of his reach. But he thinks he understands. That now they both understand each other, somehow.
“John, I care about both of you…”
Silence descended in the comfy room and John shifted in his chair.
John’s shoulders pull back straight, at attention.
John tests the water depth with his fingers. It’s all bubbly and colourful now. There’s no reply until he looks back at them both, Sherlock standing tall and the little bundle in his arms, fingers so careful, so soft, not surgical, just tender, soothing over Rosie’s scalp.
For that morning, he would still be angry. He would still be something.
No. He can’t talk about any of it. It all had to wait. Had to be left alone for now. Remain words unspoken. A few more to join the rest flying in the air around them. Just for a while longer. Until he was ready.
“Sherlock-"
want?
“She feels warm to you too?”
“Made breakfast”
“No.” Sherlock straightens up, a new man coming into view. His eyes are narrowed, his posture rigid, his voice stern. John grins in triumph.
They were connected in ways Sherlock had never seen or felt before. Even though somehow, it had all been there all along. Like finding a long-lost precious toy in an innocuous, random hiding spot years later. Like growing into the body one is meant to have, the right skin and bones and vessels of blood. Like returning home.
Sherlock, pretending his gaze was absorbed by his phone, could not help but smile at her, and she had cooed excitedly. John had muttered under his breath, and it reached Sherlock’s ears like the undercurrent of an angry, brewing storm wind jostling the leaves on the tree branches. The hairs at the back of his neck had stood on end, and his eyes darted nervously between John’s shoulder blades and the screen of his phone, the ‘Goodmorning. -JW’ message lifelessly staring back at him.
Sherlock rubs his palm over his eyes, until there are black dots swimming in his vision.
He feels angry because it shouldn’t hurt, but it does. He should
John is not here yet. Maybe he will not come downstairs at all. Sherlock rubs at his eyes. The dream has both tired him and unsettled him. There was no falling involved in it, but it feels like a drop to reality now; Why would John come down, anyway?
“Sherlock. Sherlock, I’m here, I’m right here, do you hear me?”
My poor partner is sound asleep from all their hard work on this (sweet dreams @theconsultinglinguist <3) so let me wish you all a wonderful read on their behalf as well (we do hope you like some partial resolution ;) ) and feed us please with your comments <3, seriously, this part of the story has been tremendously challenging for both of us so we would really appreciate some reviews.
That’s what it’s called. But it’s so much more. It’s a chest being pried open by deft fingers. It’s dried sand ground. Receiving the first rain drops in months. It’s Sherlock’s eyes. Diamond blue. Washing over John’s whole body. It’s butterflies. Monarchs finding their homes, milkweeds, after months of exhausting search.
He tucked his hands under his thighs, childishly. When he realised, they came to rest on his middle, self-conscious, fingers tangling together as if in prayer. Imitating casual.
“Um… Good. I’m okay”
“Stay. Please”
“Let’s go.”
“Mm?”
“Um… Something… Happy?”
“I mean, I can’t. Manage it.” He adds, looking at his feet.
-EDIT-
“That you?”
‘Yeah, I know... it’s not weird, is it?’
singing!’
“Sherl- um… Yeah, it… You’re doing the thing again” John’s voice is undefined and wrong, as if Sherlock’s head was underwater.
And, after all…  John is essential. He is someone to orbit. Sherlock isn’t. There is no way he could be the core of someone’s version of a little problem. Much less John’s.
John nods, eyes fixed on a random point of the headboard, somewhere beside Sherlock’s head. Slow. Slow. That’s all he can do. Bringing himself to accept the cold gaze slowly. If he looks now, he’s done for.
John stops pacing.
He falls in bed, faces the ceiling, listens to London breathing in the dark.
It crashes down on him like a ton of lead. Her
And now it can’t be desperation talking. Maybe it’s just the worried fear that she will start crying again that makes John insist Sherlock keep her. But even so… That means he trusts him to help. John trusts him at a time enough to make him bend.
He places her on her chair, her elephant in her lap, and pulls it close to him as he prepares her breakfast, talking to her all the while. How did she sleep, how is she feeling, what would she want to do? Occasionally describing the steps of her cream preparation to her. Even though she does not always reply, he does not stop, keeping his voice warm and steady. He’d do the same when she was younger too, and he was babysitting her. When Mary had decided to run, and left John alone with a 10-month old and no explanation. With no choice. It was this lack of choice that made Sherlock an idiot enough to hope. Two is a family, three is a family, too. Maybe, if Mary was so good so as to evade even his attempts at finding her, then… He forces this train of thought to freeze on its tracks. If it wasn’t for her, he would not be alive now. Not that he’s sure whether that is a good thing or a not-good thing anymore. It is mostly a thing that just is.
okay?” John adds, as if it is a second thought which now becomes an obvious concern.
Sherlock filled two glasses and returned with careful steps.
Sherlock kisses Honeybee’s forehead again. Her skin feels like a pebble burned by the sun against his lips.
He runs to the bathroom. Fingers gripping the sink.
John hums his disapproval. “Molly Hooper has not passed by either since your birthday, has she?”
But he doesn’t listen. It’s not like he has achieved something big. Not even a week sober. So... it’s not technically a relapse. Or is it? He didn’t have much of a problem anyway; not reached the point where his body couldn’t take it. A slight hand tremour doesn’t prove anything.
“I want to make sure-”
Sherlock had blinked at the question. He was almost sure that was something John needed to answer, that John was the one who may need to talk about what had happened. Instead he found himself answering with a sincere “Of course”.
Another surprising experience. John is glad Sherlock is happy today, more than usual even. He waits until Sherlock comes back with his –‘Of course, what else?’- ginger biscuits before serving him more tea.
It’s a good day for optimism. Not much potential to be crushed down, but John finds he wouldn’t care anyway. John
Butterflies flutter in John’s stomach. Lips tugged into an amused little smile. One that Sherlock returns, wholeheartedly.
“Yeah. On other news, you’re an idiot” at least he can take pride in saying it first for once.
we'd love to discuss with you all of what you think will happen next! :D
John looks at the positively dazzling figure beside him. He looks and he can see. He can observe. Finally. This is the man running to the fire to save him.
He froze. Everything froze. Ice spreading through him, from his core and out, cracking as it worked its way, immobilizing, through arteries, veins; solidifying muscle, numbing out nerves. Until what used to feel like his body was only an amorphous slab of mulch and cold.
“Just… Just please forget it, I…” John takes a step back. He looks as if something has been torn from him, his face carved with lines, his left hand shaking. Sherlock suffers at the sight, as if his own arm was being sliced open.
“Feeling alright?”
No. No, no, no. He can’t lose this job. He can’t lose the only thing he does that actually helps. He can’t-
“No, it’s…” Sherlock whispers. “Now, it’s… fine.” There’s shock in his voice, shock that makes John rush to go on, heart aching to explain everything, to not leave a sliver of doubt and self-blame in Sherlock’s heart.
“Oh, I’m done already”
“Clever naughty girl.” John rolls his eyes and leans down, taking her in his arms.
“Whaaat… are you doing?” In this case however, John is panicking anew.
An arm-lock, a hit, a wrist. Fingers opening, John throwing Sherlock backwards. The sound of the surgical instrument falling, hitting the floor, clinging. Once, twice. A bang of a spine against metal. ‘Stop it.’ Again. ‘Stop it now!’ Thrice. Done. Rested on the ground. Shining. Lifeless. Dangerous. Gleaming.
John leads the way, manoeuvring through the small wooden tables, and waiters, and queue of people waiting to pay at the till. He spots a table beside the window at the very edge of the small converted log cabin that is the café. It is overlooking the busiest part of the park; plenty of people and dogs and strollers in sight to keep Rosie interested.
“It’s okay. I mean it”
“No.” John chokes.
It takes a moment, but John raises an eyebrow smugly. “’Captain’, huh?”.
John was holding his hand.
“John…” He can’t help smiling over the softly reprimanding tone.
Sherlock nodded, large palms cupping Honeybee’s hands as they tried to reach for the space bar.
When he thinks he is ready, he sets his jaw, and swings his legs off the bed.
“Yeah?”
“Mmph…”
John applies the tape over the dressing, keeping it as tight as it should be to breath and rebuild the tissue and not bleed from pressure either.
“No. No catch. Sherlock”
! He jolts to his feet, hurries past a newly startled Mrs. H. and down the corridor and slams the door behind him. He couldn’t face her. Her, or honeybee. Or John. Especially John. Thank god John isn’t here.
It took John a moment to reply, but when he did he turned around to face Sherlock, and his expression was soft, and open. “ ‘Ella’s Kitchen’, I think? Something like that”
She does not seem phased by it, by anything John does. Not because she emits authority, like Mycroft, but because she radiates indifference. As if his spikes and warnings could never hurt her.
“Oh! You got it.” Sherlock straightens, surprised.
He winces, tries to get away. Fails. No. No, he doesn’t want to, he doesn’t. He doesn’t want to see.
“Sherlock?”
The man startles, turning to the soft sound. John takes in the tightness of his shoulders, the wide eyes. He had zoned out. Something screams at the back of John’s mind. ‘Better not dig in this one.’
“How are we, today?” John walks towards his daughter hesitantly. Sherlock washes the first bowl as slowly as he can, watching over his shoulder.
“Yes.”
A wail. Rosie. He frowns. Was she trying to get his attention all this while? A grumble leaves his lips.
Pieces. In pieces.
John frowns, as if he were expecting a reaction other than calm acceptance. When he speaks, Sherlock understands he has taken it as doubt.
a no, Sherlock realises. He is not hesitating because he is unsure about what he himself wants, only. He is hesitating because he wants something from Sherlock which he is not sure Sherlock will want to give.
“We can discuss the hours together, find your right balance, if you’d like?” she anticipates his question, before he has time to finish.
Rosie had gulped down a sob. The words struck high and growled, and then fell to murmuring before swelling out again, angry waves lashing and rolling, gathering. John was on his feet now, cracked mug in hand, and his knuckles were as white as the china.
Sherlock is kneeling on the floor, arm stretched under the cabinet, buried to the shoulder, his face is flushed pink and he is now biting his lip, wide nervous eyes fixed on John. His curls are a mess again -even though he brushed them after breakfast- and it is obvious as hell that the position he’s currently in, makes his breath hitch.
And some painul plot-twists.
Nothing happens. Sherlock inhales sharply and glances down at his bare toes, teeth worrying the inside of his lower lip.
deserves her. She deserves a big and happy family. She deserves so much John knew he could never give. Since the beginning.
‘Right.’
“It’s alright. Breathe for me. That’s it. You’re good. You’re safe. Shh…”
John breathes in relief and lets go of his hand. His fingers were warm, and Sherlock can feel their imprint on his skin. Can wonder why the hell he’d ever want to hide his hand away.
“You’re just the
“Alright, then, let’s give you a bath, sweetheart.” He whispers, heading for the bathroom.
On his part, his mind refuses to be carried away; a circular code, always returning to the same result. Or, better, a mule tied to a post; that obstinate.
“Children that have not been through what Rosie’s been through”, John retorts. The nonchalance in his tone betrayed by a bitter chuckle.
“Hey there.”
“So. Back to my previous question. Adopted?”
sense.
Avoidance.
John had stood with his hands on his hips, puffing out constrained breaths of air. His left hand was coiled into a twitching fist, and as he had sniffed, the lines on his forehead had deepened. Sherlock berated himself over having done all the washing up and tidying; he should have known John would need a let-out. “Tea?”, he had asked, persuaded it was pointless. But John had nodded, and gone about making tea the way he always did, efficient movements, and standing on tiptoe lastly to reach the sugar.
A tray is on his hands. The smell of homely food filling his lungs and he wakes up.
She looks at him, mildly curious at the change of tone.
He was given too many chances. Too many.
“A numeric combination.” Sherlock corrects again.
“Different? Different how?” He deflected. It had taken him a while to master that small trick. She always seemed to back down or rephrase when he showed interest or felt troubled with terminology.
“John?”
“Can you tell me how?”
“Alright, alright. We’re not cutting the tea.”
‘Oh, alright, best friend I’ve been in love with then. Have it your way.’
He turns his head to the bump in the mattress beside him. There’s no warmth coming off the pressed sheets when John slides a tentative arm over their seemingly endless white. It makes cold water run down his spine. Maybe this was a boundary he shouldn’t have crossed. Especially now that he knows… he knows what he wants.
Words. Repeated so many times. Bitter acknowledgements of the world he was living in. With that deep voice. Undoing him from the inside.
Sherlock glances at the menu chalkboard on the wall to his right. Toasties, scones, pies. He hadn’t paid heed before, but now certainly feels a shy pang of hunger.
A knock on the tilted a tad open door.
“What are you-?” Sherlock works his jaw, clearly distraught. “Why would
“She needs you.
She made a face. He stood up, letting her play with the cutlery, filling the table with food. He’ll clean up before work. His shift started later today. It was almost nine in the morning. Sherlock hadn’t shown up yet. John had once again made breakfast, keeping it warm for him.
It’s as if his heart is wrapped in the honeycomb taste of Sherlock’s lips.
Sherlock grinned.
It goes on for the next few days, seamless and soft and careful, like a flower trying to bloom beneath the winter soil as spring draws closer.
“Poor little thing…”, she coos at Honeybee, who whines in response.
His fault. Everything is his fault. No. He doesn’t want to see. He gets shoved at it, his face above the victim, his eyes water. A lifeless body. No!
Sherlock folds the memory away, back into the cupboard it came from. Memories like it used to be stored in his old room, which is now buried in debris, bricks and cracked paint, shattered glass and wooden shards. It’s a miracle how this one survived the disaster.
“This?”
“John.”
A waitress brings their order, at long last. Sherlock looks away, on instinct and habit both, in anticipation of the smile John will flash her, the innuendo-filled comment.
“That’s all?”
John thinks this was a no. He was
Sherlock looks appalled.
Sherlock can see John hesitating, if only for a moment. She sees the mistake too.
There’s a gasp and a click and he doesn’t hear the ignition but he’s sure the gun has been fired. He’s not the receiving end anymore though. There’s someone jumping in front of him. Tall and thin and skeleton-like but strong enough to catch the bullet in his chest a second time.
He feels much better himself and even more so knowing that Sherlock is free to do so too. A tune plays and John turns rigid.
Difficult themes continuing into this chapter.
He is looking straight ahead, sipping his tea in silence, when there’s a shift of leather on silk, and a weight over John’s shoulder. He turns, curious, and there he is. There are his curls brushing over John’s chin. There are the cheekbones he so secretly desires. There’s the pale, freckled face of Sherlock. His Sherlock… His best friend… and devoted companion… and…
If he could hide that feeling away, nestle it under his breastbone, wrap it in a cocoon away from the world, away from tomorrow. If he could be open, open, cry out to the night sky of twinkling lights that hardly sleeps.
When he’d fallen asleep, he had been thinking of the kiss. And when he’d woken up, there was little else on his mind. With John fussing in the morning, like a busy bee dusted with saffron-orange pollen, Sherlock had not known what to expect. There had been no talk, and no expression or regrets -which he thinks is a good thing. Even though a recap, an anchor to his sanity, would have been much appreciated. Spending all morning trying not to stare at John’s lips, he was beginning to think that he had imagined the incident altogether.
There’s some kind of update exchange on “How are you feeling?”, “Okay, thank you.” But John can’t pay much mind. Simultaneous sighs come from each of their corners. John gathers the tea close to his chest, nestling like a chastened child. His body already twitchy to get another shot at the burning liquid.
“Mm?” A small snap of head to the side and then back forward again, fingers rubbing each other compulsively. “May I… may I tell you?”
“Oh. I thought you-” Rosie whines. John tries to keep her moving. “Did we wake you?”
“Good?”
Sleeping pills are not allowed. At least an herbal soother, then. Something!
He straightens against the pillows, tidies his nightgown about him. There is a tightness in his throat, strangling any words that may try to escape. He feels trapped, like a cornered cat, and what blooms in his mouth instead is panic, a swarm of black moths. He swallows it down.
Damned roof. He had been up there once.
Sometimes he wishes John wasn’t so good at this. “Didn’t sleep much. I was”, he twists the thread over his index and tugs, “worried”.
“I think she is an accomplished professional”, Sherlock says, holding both arms around Honeybee in a relaxed hug.
“Wait. Wait!”
“I-…” Thinking what to say. “I could take her downstairs… if you’d prefer some rest?”
“Do you mind some company?”
“I have to clean you up, little girl. Please…” He begs and she hiccups on tears.
Sherlock places them on the table. Harder than usual. John isn’t sure if it is because he couldn’t hold them longer or on purpose. His voice was deeper, harder when he spoke. John’s hands have already withheld back to his sides. His fingers are itching.
“Ye-es.” He tries to drawl but a different intonation, due to his bruised ribs being compromised, makes it through the word.
That had been one of the good moments.
As if they were friends again.
John sits back on his heels with a huff. Still too pale for his liking.
“How so?”
is wrong? Maybe this isn’t the right decision after all. Maybe this won’t help her. Maybe it will terrify her. It’s his fault. He’s not a good father. Can’t be. She doesn’t want this. He’s ignoring her again. Letting the thoughts that have been assaulting his mind ever since they stepped outside the door break him to pieces. Of course, it’s his fault. Of course-
Even though it is early, he can’t remember falling asleep. What remains of the previous afternoon in the forefront of his mind is a content, proud smile and
Sherlock nods.
“Yes, Mrs Trevor, your son is just fine. Make sure to take that cough syrup every two hours and watch him. Come back in two days if he’s not improving.”
He must have been silent for longer than he realised.
‘Unable’
his own voice in his head. But he could imagine it being warm, perhaps over a crooked little grin. Sherlock sighed and let it wash over him like a caress. It brought more shivers in its wake.
Sherlock was... distant... John couldn’t help again, couldn’t reach; he didn’t know how... His throat itched. Rosie was noisy. Nervous reaction, he’d diagnosed. She felt something was off. Again. How could he keep doing this to her?
For some inexplicable reason, John has invested in his wellbeing. During the good moments it brings a smile to his face. During the bad, his mouth is aching with bile.
He reads again. Tries to feel the words as if they were touches, wonders what they would be; a hand brushing on his, a soft caress on his cheek that wouldn’t mind the stubble there, a gentle kiss on his forehead. John’s words. Words of praise, happy words, caring words; saying he is glad to receive the photograph, that he is proud, asking about how Sherlock feels. Sherlock imagines the words like a soft summer breeze, like gentle afternoon sunlight, and lets them wash over him.
“Harriet?”
Honeybee waves the spoon with the last mouthful towards John and he pretends to eat a little before he takes the spoon gently and makes aeroplane noises to entice her into enjoying the last bite herself.
Sherlock leaves the carrier beside the baby bag. John tries to catch his gaze, but Sherlock keeps it well away until John understands that whatever he wants, well, he won’t get. Sherlock sits once John has walked over to Honeybee. He does not even know why he’s acting up. He’s most probably being irrational, pouty, passive-aggressive. Well, he doesn’t care.
“What
And then Moriarty returned, the thieving magpie with the glint of insanity in its eyes, and Sherlock could not do anything at all. Because the magpie found out about the heart. John’n, and so his own.
The café is tiny and crammed. The difference in temperature is felt at once, Sherlock sweltering in his Belstaff, Honeybee’s cheeks, already pink from playing outside, now a flaming red. John’s hair is utterly dishevelled beyond salvation -and Sherlock knows that the riot on his head is in no better state.
John pauses for a moment but then he smiles. “Mmm yeah. But she was first, I will give her credit for that” He clears his throat, and rolls his weight on his heels and forward again, hands clasped firmly behind his back.
“I will listen. I want to listen”
There’s the first thing John needs to change.
He breathes, and his surroundings, the whole of 221B, throbs with him.
Sherlock nods. ‘
“Aren’t you both adorable?”
“It’s alright”, John hums. “It’s alright. I got you, now. It’s alright”
Part 2 'finale' is here. Enjoy! (can't give spoilers, not for THIS one!)
They smiled more. John had started. With every good morning, every goodnight. Every ‘how are you’, every ‘slept well?’ But also, for random reasons. Sometimes he just saw Sherlock and smiled, and Sherlock would feel a familiar, soft-sweet heat bloom in his chest. It had taken a while, but he began to smile back. He was surprised to find how unnatural smiling so often felt, at first. As if the muscles on his face had forgotten how to do it. Maybe they were reluctant too. So Sherlock’s most smiles were private. When John was not directly looking at him. But they were there, budding carefully on parched, hard ground.
“But you don’t know everything either, do you?”, John says snappishly. If he means to sound harsh, he doesn’t, not really. He reminds Sherlock of Honeybee, the way she pouts when she can’t get her way.
John’s fist rises, just a little, but then just rests on the counter without force. “She called. When I was finishing. At work. She’s mad. Mad that I live here, mad that I’m not letting her see Rosie”
‘You lovable madman.’
Sherlock waits as John takes a small sip, picking out a loose thread from the beige duvet.
“Just for a moment!” Greg huffs, voice like gravel, stretching to a high pitch with exasperation.
Then he realizes that having no Oyster Card means he must pay for a ticket, which means he realizes that he has to use the machines, and that the machines are over there, which is definitely too far away, away from the safety of John's solid body.
“True. I could never be a poet.” He shakes his head with a huff.
Sherlock’s hand has fallen to his side, fingers flexing, leather gloves squeaking. John’s chest is a bubble of emotion, the realisation stark before him, staring him in the eye, unmoving. He wants to reach. He wants to
“But you’re- as I have told you before, John, you are doing yourself a disservice-”
“Better.”
“Talk about what?”
“You remember… you, coming to find me- well, Mrs Hudson brought you to me but- yeah…” John’s words ring trivial and childish to his ears. He clears his throat, frowning at his calloused fingers.
His purpose now in mind, he proceeds.
He falls on thin ice. He bursts. Water rushing in lungs.
Selfish and a coward. A hypocrite that the beaten-up detective had tried so humanely to soothe, to comfort. Because John was considered his friend. Still. After everything. Or whatever.
Today Sherlock had been anything but. He had faced John, commanded him in a way John had never seen before. Or he had…
“Shit.” He swore, gathering the spoon from the floor and running to the sink, struggling to clean up the cream from the ruined linen.
“It’s nothing that was going to be better in a day”, Sherlock shrugs.
This is the man shooting another in the face just to uphold that vow.
There was no reply. ‘No, no no no, don’t go now’, he gritted his teeth. Stupid brain. Stupid. Rosie’s hands slipped from his palms and patted his cheeks his nose, his lips. A butterfly’s touch, as it landed here, there, glimmering in the sun. He sucked in a breath, tried to keep his heartbeat calmer than it had been. ‘What do I do. Tell me what to do’.
“I’ll watch over her. You need some rest.” He adds when there’s no reply.
Silence.
Maybe… maybe John regretted hugging him, after all.
They exchange a flitting look. Understanding passing between them. John takes in the dark circles under Sherlock’s eyes, his haunted look of acknowledgement for John’s nightmares even if he doesn’t mention it. He almost reaches up to touch his own face, sure he can feel the taut, dry skin splitting under his fingertips, just like the one of the man opposite him.
Her eyebrows raise in realization, and she nods emphatically, sunny ringlets of hair bouncing up and down on her forehead. “Yes? Okay, come on, then!”
“Fuck’s sake… Fuck’s sake, fuck’s
The man screaming his name when John was ready to be burned alive.
“Except in extremes.”
) was puzzling. If John needed to move back in 221B, he could organise it better, or at least, at a more convenient circumstance. Spurious decision based on emotional drive, then. John's house must be a constant reminder of Mary, and a change of scenery was thus necessary.
Then Sherlock looks down to their little rose and everything changes at once again. He mellows and melts, like ice cream or maybe hard-edged sugar becoming caramel, eyes bright and lit by the orange glow of their living room lights and fireplace. They are caramels now instead of oceans, steady and thick instead of rippling or cutting like ice knives. John immerses himself to it, undeterred, unnoticed. There’s only one person, Sherlock’s got eyes for right now.
“Yes, she’s- well, shy.” Sherlock smiles.
The thought makes him smile. Sherlock sees it and smiles too; arms bumping lightly.
“John-”, he started in warning.
A strangled tiny noise breaks the silence and at first, John doesn’t know where it came from but it is soon followed by a fully blown out sneeze, and the way their little girl’s body shudders and spasms makes it apparent she is the source of it. John’s fingers open and he runs to them. He can’t bear to be away for longer. The bags are falling on the floor creating such commotion that Sherlock would jump to the ceiling if it wasn’t for the tender weight of Rosie on his chest.
Connected.
Sherlock’s eyes skitter around, searching the tiles.
“I don’t want it”, he repeats, louder, every sound painfully precise, syllables hurled. It hurt.
John stands with a small grunt, begins to gather their plates. Sherlock reaches a hand to stop him, but John grabs his plate anyway. “It’s okay. Tomorrow’s your turn. You look tired today. Then it’s evening pills and sleep. Will do you good”
“Isn’t she lovely?”
eat anything?”
“And is… Is this… Okay?” John reaches to hold his hand. Sherlock at once parts his fingers, letting John’s slip between his and weave their hands together. John’s thumb brushes over his knuckles, tightening the grip. Sherlock sighs.
John turns on the taps, water at the exact temperature necessary. Sherlock’s eyes shine with a yes of recognition and approval at the same time, and the tub starts to fill. Their little flower’s favourite toys are all around the bathroom, along with the ones inside the water, already starting to get bubbly with a smooth lavender baby shampoo, recommended by Sherlock again, of course. The little flower herself is curled up in Sherlock’s arms, head to the crook of his neck, holding on and whimpering a little in understanding.
No. Shit. He can’t.
John is smiling when he comes to sit beside Sherlock on the floor. The man stops talking, instead his face is taking a deep flush of red and he keeps looking away. The water reaches to Rosie’s belly button as she is sitting down in the tub. Her eyes are fixed to the small pirate ship Sherlock holds in one hand and the duck that is floating like a buoy in front of her, as she gathers bubbles around them. Her lower lip trembles, missing the steady countenance of Sherlock’s voice, but John reaches to brush her little arm in reassurance.
Maybe it is because a large part of those two and half years was spent between there and here. 221B Baker Street. Either way, Rosie doesn’t like it and neither does her father that got back half-drunk on the 6
“John.” A strangled whisper. It catches John’s attention; he looks up, questioning, his gut feeling heavy. There’s shock in Sherlock’s eyes, in the way his lips are parted just so and John’s eyes follow the curves involuntarily -subconsciously- just to make sure he gets the feeling right.
She’s fuming. A weird sense of triumph overpowers John’s instinct to put this to an end.
John is paralysed. It’s not possible for such beauty, miles and miles of refined muscle to be unadorned. Sherlock steps closer, a hint of confusion and exasperation on his features as he presses the scarf on John’s flexing fingers. John shakes himself when the warmth of Sherlock’s breath falls on his forehead, tingling, making his hair stand.
Selfish. He is only being selfish (as always).
John is gone.
His brain supplies, for the hundredth time. And then again, '
“Good”
John’s lips part in concentration, a breathed whisper on his lips -it could be ‘there’, or ‘hey’. A content tranquillity in his deep-sea eyes. Because he’s home.
Sherlock watches the steam rising from the mass of water, left hand playing silent scales over his thigh.
“I… do…?”
Does he mean them?
He can’t keep him. He can’t push him away, either. And no matter what he does, now or later, he is destined to lose him.
John doesn’t know how much time has passed. But he knows something else. Sherlock does exist. He does. He’s here. He’s speaking to John. Now. Here. Now.
John had said that his wellbeing was important. And John was not known to lie. But why. Why would such a thing ever matter given all this?
“Look at you. You’re more beautiful than I remembered, little miss.”
How many times can one person take? When will it finally be too much to start from zero? Everything works in continuous vicious circles and he doesn’t know when it will be the last time he will manage to pick himself back up.
John’s steady -doctor- voice takes effect as Sherlock breathes, deep and steady. He nods.
“Well that was… That was something”, John says, gently, as if testing the silence, whether it will give or hold.
Sherlock can hear him breathing through the nose, huffing from time to time, as he walks over and over his solitary route; couch-armchair-couch. His left hand is twitching at his side. John tries to subdue it by flexing and coiling it alternately. It doesn’t help. There is a frown over his eyes, but he tries to make his step purposeful, controlled. Step, step, step, step, turn. Again, and again.
to. It’s… It should never have been like this, and I… It’s not me. I know you’ll be quite right not to believe me, but… That… That fucked up joke is not me. I don’t want it to be. It… It’s my responsibility, and my fault, and I’ll change it”
John had held him, and buried his face in Sherlock’s neck, Sherlock finding his lips resting on the top of John’s head, silver hair subtly fragrant and silky-smooth. And he could breathe him in, wool and tea and the cheap-white soap, as if not a day had passed since they first met, since John first moved in with him.
“Okay, let’s work against that reasoning now, shall we?”
He feels his left-hand tremble; his right is numb. He swallows, reads over the message again. Types.
Sherlock believes in
"It's alright", he adds, almost cooing, when little Bee complains and tries to shift again, not finding comfort in being held like that.
He resisted the urge to take a piece of broken glass or porcelain and slice it over his anterior forearm right there and then. Just like that. In front of them.
appreciate it. He can live with it, and he will be happy to live with it. It is enough. And when it isn’t he will make it be.
“Oh! Morning, Ella. No, no, everything alright?” He glances back at Sherlock. The man’s looking at him quizzically.
“Thought we could… change it up a little”
do for you? Are you betting on him taking you on these stupid little ‘adventures’ again? Is that what your life is going to be? You are a parent now, Johnny. You have responsibilities. And after Dad, you should know how it is to be raised by a father that cares more about himself than his children. And yet you are living with a person that can’t even understand all that. If I am so bad because of a divorce, then how about him? He’s… practically a psycho -you’ve said so yourself! You see why it’s not hard for me to be angry? To think that the only reason why you’ve kicked me out of your life is because I am-”
Honeybee slams her little fists on the table and reaches for Sherlock’s baguette demandingly. He pushes his plate away and tries to soothe her, leaning close above her so that he can hear his low, shushing baritone.
This was worse than just a warning or a pep-talk.
“Sherlock?”
“Hey.” John feels his fingers almost burning. “You’re- you’re good?”
Sherlock blinks. Shivers spread in his throat, his chest, his arms, his legs, the back of his head. He realizes his jaw is clenched, his eyes narrowed. He breathes, eases the muscles as much as he can. He blinks some more, chews on his upper lip. Time is distended again, the sounds zooming out of focus.
What was impossible mere minutes ago…
Subduction: The downward movement of one crustal plate beneath another, typically occurring within the deep ocean trenches.
Sherlock is owling at him again. John finds he quite enjoys making him look like that. ‘Adorable.’
“Erm… John?” Sherlock whispers after a while.
was the one to blame. That thought he deserved the punishment of abandonment and loneliness. John's beating was just that. Sherlock had never looked at John to be his executioner, had never wanted the punches and beating to exist between them. How even John could deliver such treatment only signified, in his mind, the beginning of the end. John was his last hope, his last stronghold; the fraying last thread in a rope about to snap. If even John could beat him up, then Sherlock surely deserved whatever painful thing was in store for him.
“Causing people to talk already?”, Sherlock teases, before being able to rein himself in.
“No, it’s different-” He flushes.
“Now.” John nods.
“She started babbling again, has been feeding herself -increased appetite-, been playing with new toys, categorising, solving small puzzles, listening to stories and generally books and narrations without falling asleep when she’s not tired, knows when it’s time for her nappy change and started babbling to John specifically about a week ago. She’s not throwing tantrums when she needs attention but she does cry or show her discomfort. Her sleep has stopped being interrupted and her routine does not change almost at all. There was no progress in her dislike of water. She used to love it when she was younger. She’s trying to take care of others, clinging to specific toys and wanting to feed me or John with her spoon, always knows when she’s being called or asked something and her not understanding distresses her. She’s desperate to communicate sometimes and others she settles comfortable with her babbling. She hasn’t said a specific, actual word yet.”
him. It does not matter that such endings to silences are temporary. It does not matter that the presence he longs for is not there for
She claps her hands. “You put a lot of effort into it, and it shows”, he continues softly. “Do you want to tell me what it is?”
Metal. Hollow. Cupboard. No. Fridge. No. Morgue. Oh. The morgue.
Mrs. Hudson smiles at him. “Look at you… Never would have thought you’d make a parent. In your own weird way, even”
A shadow passes through Sherlock’s closed off features but there’s nothing. Nothing more.
-it’s Saturday night after all- and stay quiet for a while, trying to catch on. The show has been progressing for a month now. Since the day John moved in, in fact. January 7
Sherlock inclines his head a little, a tiny smile playing on his lips; reserved.
The elderly woman walks closer to them, her arms crossed in front of her body. “Who was that rude woman asking to see you yesterday, John?”
Exasperated. That’s what she is. John keeps walking. She is not drunk. But
But he wasn’t trying to hide it anymore. ‘Was he? Is he?’ He has opened up now, let John help… ‘Truly?’
Some days he can shower. Some days he can get dressed, stand, smile. Get a few bites down, face John, hold Rosie, will his hands not to tremble. Others, his bed is an abyss that won’t let him go. An abyss he has to fight. He does not want to admit those days are more frequent by far. That the good moments fleeting amidst dark waters. He focuses on the immediate action he must complete each time, on reaching the next hour on the clock. Small steps, small victories -that do not even feel like victories, because there is not much to win at all. The effort is to lose as little as possible each day. To not crumble.
Sherlock brings an arm around his ribs and fidgets. John takes a look around, noticing the open higher cabinets, the messed-up pill bottles, the spread-out expedition of a whole lot of them over the sink.
Then again… Harry threatened Honeybee could be taken away from them. Her words had rang with such indifference for the child’s fate, for John’s fate, should such a thing ever happen… Sherlock does not regret defending John over this.
“But in case there is a repeat… It’s fine”
“Is this… okay?”
“How dare you-”
John giggling beside him at the bottom of the stairs, John winking over the brim of a mug, John dishevelled a three in the morning rushing to get ready for a new case and dash at the morgue, John holding his hand when they bolted handcuffed together, John smiling when he told him he’s his best friend, John giving him his daughter to hold for the first time.
How can it not be embedded in his DNA? He can’t erase it. He can’t control it. It is there. It is always going to be there. Intergenerational. Passed from father to son, the son to his daughter. How can it not? Nurture. Yes. Still never leaving. Always a part of him. Always controlled by a man that was long gone. No free will. John’s fingers twitch. He aches for a glass. A bottle. To smash it, crash it, drink it. The burn. The fire of alcohol. To forget. Forget he has a child to raise. Forget he doesn’t know how.
“John!”
“It was… okay”, he murmurs with a shrug, averting his gaze.
“Excuse me, missy, this is my home!”, Mrs Hudson’s exasperated and offended voice tries to trail after her.
“Mind if I sit on it for a while longer...?” he bites on his lip.
John grunts, rubbing a hand to his temple. Sherlock’s fingers are pressing over his eyebrow.
Sherlock is afraid; it just takes a wrong step. But then again, he has taken many, and there was no reprimand, no abandonment. Perhaps this could be the same. This is a responsibility he is not just allowed to share, but wanted to share. And it is Honeybee, after all. Honeybee, and the pleading, deep-sea eyes that turn tranquil again with his reply.
“You’ve been quiet.”
He had caused this. All of it. He’s bitter.
There’s nothing more exciting than to use every last ounce left of his mind to understand and measure and calculate the precise mechanics of Honeybee’s speech, see how it changes, how it improves -perhaps predict her first word?
“I beg your pardon?”
“I…” He sniffs, eyes glued to the floor. His voice thick with tears, as the breath of a wave. “But I
“There can be no other reasons for you? Hm? No other reasons?”
There’s a line appearing between Sherlock’s eyebrows. Faint but present nonetheless, indicating confusion. His eyes are dismissive, like it’s obvious.
“John”
Against the pale light his eyelids are flimsy grey hoods. They make him think of the clouds over his head, and the waves beneath. Sherlock should be thinking of John. Of Honeybee. Of his dreams, even, with their gaping, toothless grins. He ends up counting the beats of his heart instead. Getting up, seeing their faces, talking… He pushes the reality of them taking place further and further away, until they are as out of reach as the source of the ocean in his mind.
Rosie's eyelids flutter, and she sleepily clutches the curls at the back of Sherlock's neck and hides her face in his throat. He presses a silent kiss to her curls, unsteady because of the watery tremors of his chin.
Sherlock glanced up at that. Trap? Rebuke?
She’s giggling.
And is terrified in this half-formed universe between past and present. He’s terrified it’s all a lie. It’s all going to happen again. The water was running before, wasn’t it?
“Absolutely not”
. ‘A toddler comes with such a dizzying array of bottles and spoons and bowls and things, it is ridiculous’.
“I’ve been... meaning to...” John’s palm presses against his kneecap. Pushing, patting, curling. All fidgety but soft motions, silent; not alarming.
He gets a tender eyeroll in response.
‘Against the rest of the world.’
family”
No. No, he wasn’t, he wasn’t, he wouldn’t be.
“John”
There’s so much to do, so much to think about and clarify and blab about and ask for and do. Do. Do. Show. Tell. Open himself up to. John is almost pirouetting around the room, tidying about as he whistles. Not even the cloudy sky can make this- this urge, this need, the lightning bolts inside him- go away.
Oh, how she loves Sherlock. How she wants to be held by him, play with him, interact. Sherlock coos and she gurgles happily and although John had been downstairs then, he knew exactly what was going on. His head falling and his heart clenching. Another pint. Another bottle.
“It’s not good that, is it? She’s silent”
“No, really, let me see-” John tries to reach Sherlock’s eye amidst chuckles and Sherlock almost leans into the touch when it comes before the small pain of a growing bump registers and he winces.
“Sorry. She’s been-” A trembling hiccup. “-not sleeping well…” John says anyway, a nervous smile making his lips slant sideways.
“What?” John’s speaking through his teeth, dragging his lip in and out nervously.
John should have known. He should have seen the signs, diagnosed it himself if he had to. But he kept making excuses, kept holding on false beliefs when awake or just drunk that he could fix this. He
“John!” He gasps, breathless, instead and John is already kneeling beside them on the floor, scraping his knees on the rug at the force his need to be there for them both creates.
“Okay, and who is the primary caretaker for the past month?”
Sherlock waits, his heart hammering in his chest. Did he guess wrong? Did he assume wrong?
He rubs his eyes a bit before snapping a picture with a thumbs up and a genuine grin, but he doesn’t really mind if Sherlock sees how the picture and text made him emotional. Not anymore. He has nothing to be ashamed of. He is a father and he is going to honour it, honour her as she deserves.
He's heaving by the time he's reached them, his cheeks a pair of burning coals.
“How was your drinking this week?”
“Shut up”
He doesn’t want to bring this back now. Not his thoughts, not his past, not his studies or military, not anything. Not now. Not again. He has a more important matter to address. He averts his gaze, as quick as a hummingbird’s wings.
“Why?” He whispers, arms shaky going to rest over Sherlock’s back.
‘Easy for you to say. You’re in my head, you don’t have to breathe!’
“How are you feeling now?”
Their hands… It’s a connection. A strong one. Despite the tremors. They hold on to each other, Latching on shards of encouragement and hope. John is allowed to feel the heat emanating from Sherlock’s skin. He is allowed to look and touch and… so much more… He can feel details, differences and similarities. He can feel how Sherlock’s bone structure is huge compared to his own, but right now his fingers can circle the thin wrist completely, feeling the veins underneath. There’s a wild beauty to the way Sherlock’s fingers have always moved and John now feels them twitch again under his palm, bony knuckles caressing the carved lines on his skin. Sherlock hasn’t turned his hand palm up, he lets John press there and hold him and hasn’t pulled away either. For John, frankly, it’s a miracle. And he feels and feels and closes his eyes to feel more and more as they swim together to the surface, sharing the same air, twining their fates inside Antarctic waters, searching for the travelling warm current. A miracle.
“You know... Rosie is okay. Finally, I believe she’s beginning to be more than okay.” He pauses to see if he caught Sherlock’s attention again and continues. “And even if there was something wrong, we would always love her, wouldn’t we? We would make sure she had all the support and love she needed. Mm?”
“I should not have lost my bloody temper like a five-year-old!” John’s voice cracks into a higher register as he falls back into the cushions. Unbelievable.
“Hm. Maybe he’s a spy.” John smirks. “Maybe he’s a secret agent sent by the Queen to find which house has the best secret garden, eh?” He whispers tickling Rosie’s ear with his breath, shifting closer to Sherlock on the sidewalk, so he can hear too.
“I’ve made some light chicken noodle soup. Why don’t you boys take some and talk over dinner? I can keep the little miss for a while more.”
Sherlock had thought
“Night”
A proud leopard, head held high, king of its territory, mane shining in brilliance against the savanna sun. Paws gentle, feeling the earth’s pebbles, pressing only enough to steady, enough to soothe. Leaving peace and no marks behind, no scars.
And it was only then that it finally came into view. The truth. His one truth. John Watson’s truth.
“Thank you.”
it -nor
Did he really think an all-day out Valentine’s after a draining appointment would work?
“I… Um…” Sherlock turns the colourful book over in his hands. His eyes skim over the bright colours and large block letters, but can’t see, can’t read. The booklet is so small it is lost into his palms, and he can only feel its soft plastic.
He spins around. A nurse. His gut clenches.
The air around John is crackling until the younger men are out of earshot. Only then do his fists uncoil, his frozen-hard posture melting a little. Honeybee, oblivious to the incident, coos and points at a squirrel that rushes across the path, a grey blur of an arrow. Sherlock pauses to let her observe it.
“Oh”. That damned irony again. John grits his teeth and prepares to push forward once again. Sherlock cuts him off.
“I’m sorry, but... would you like a break?”
Sherlock’s shoulders tense. John sees the wrinkly line over his eyes deepening.
“Understanding.”
hurting you. I hurt you. Right now…” Now surely… Now is the time Sherlock will see reason… It’s obvious. Hurting him; that’s all he can ever do.
“Alright, see here, just a moment so I can at least tell him to come down-”
“But I-”
. Same day. Same morning. Right. He must have managed to fall asleep again after all that pathetic murmuring to himself.
“Right. True, that. Okay, down you go. I’ll tidy up in here”
Please heed the tags!
‘Or not.’ He blinks. Shakes his head. Shoves the darkness creeping through his vision aside.
“I mean, I didn’t drink for five days.” He bites the inside of his cheek, glancing around nervously. “I blew it yesterday.”
‘Got to drink something.’
“Hudders”, Sherlock warns through clenched teeth, but is sure she will have none of that. When did she ever.
“-I am not asking you to”, Sherlock interjects, his voice soft. He thinks he understands. He has known John’s struggles with PTSD, from before. But would not expect him to lay his heart bare. The two of them never worked like that. Not even when they were friends.
Sherlock has only felt as powerless only once before. When John’s eyes were on him, with the otherworldly under-water blue of the aquarium lighting his face eerily, his entire frame shaking with anger; You made a vow. You
“Mrs Hudson?”
Sherlock’s fingers surprisingly slide open ever so slightly. John tilts his head to read. The prominent logo of the NHS overpowers the top right corner. ‘…to inform you of your hospital general check-up on the 13
‘You cock.’
“Hey…” John shakes Sherlock’s shoulder a tiny bit. Withdraws.
Movements mechanical. Lifeless. Methodical. The precision of surgery thrown over them even when his fingers are trembling. Three boxes. Two suitcases. The accuracy of each action underlined with impartiality. Every little part of his and his daughter’s life handled as a body on the surgical table, cut off from the reality of it all, overpowered by the need to just finish the act with a certain correctness about it. Auto-pilot.
She might ignore it or take it too lightly when she’s compared to Father but he can’t. He doesn’t. It’s what he’s been running away from for ages. What he’s most afraid, most disgusted about. Then again, if she believes him, maybe they can talk, maybe solve this petty feud between them, bridge the gap, reassure each other they are okay, sibling to sibling. The world is just wrong.
“Sherlock, please, please, take her, just for a moment, I need to-”
“That’s good to hear though.”
“And Mr Watson?” She smiles as Sherlock stands and before he can object in any way, she tiptoes to glimpse at Rosie’s hidden face, without getting close enough to scare her. “And who might you be, little one?”
“I want-” John cuts in. Wrong turn. Stops. A deep breath. What to say? And how to say it? The words are tangled up in his throat, his thoughts are a network of dead-ends.
so wrong at
‘Oh.’
Sherlock’s face is mushed against his pillow. His eyes are not even moving under his eyelids.
‘What do I do?’, he gasped, reaching.
“What happened yesterday morning very much was”
“Where’s the problem, John?” She presses this time.
It’s the first slap. John endures, swallows, presses on. He can almost feel the red on his cheek for a mark that will never be.
Greg quirks an eyebrow but John is just trying to hide his grin under a palm. There is a shifting balance between them for days. Changing from confident to hesitant, easy to awkward, painful to happiest. He hopes this is a point for the positive team.
She hears him this time, but her eyes are closing, the tiniest frown persisting over her little brow. John bets she has a headache.
“So?”, Sherlock echoes with a jolt.
“It’s all fine.”
Struggling thoughts. Every day. But it’s so not true. John knows that now. It’s not true. Pretending he’s never left 221B of course doesn’t help. Avoidance doesn’t help. He needs to take care of his daughter. He needs to take care of Sherlock. Not to make up for anything. (He can’t make up for
“Took the day off”, John he announces, peering in from the door. A towel is draped over his shoulder, and his hair is wet. “Does little dove want to come downstairs? Change of scenery might help -and we should air this room”
Nobody answers.
, John
“I didn’t.”
Once they’re both seated, and have managed to take off coat, and parka, scarf, and Rosie’s carrier, and to fit Rosie’s bag under the table and between their legs, Sherlock begins to settle in the space around him, Honeybee balanced in his lap. The noise levels are relatively down, given how most people seem to want to enjoy their drink and the view of the green calmly, to the quiet hum of jazz music in the background. The café itself has a rustic feel to it, wood and handwritten menus on chalkboards and warm accent tones. Sherlock eases into his chair, holds Honeybee’s hands in his, and she pats his fingers and tries to move them.
He was pitiful.
Sherlock nods, not sure why. He begins to cut his breakfast in small bite-sized portions, right hand spasming a little under John’s gaze.
“Hoppity hop.”
“I am trying”, John says, and it’s honest. Painfully honest.
“No. No, how- how can you
“Nno…” He hesitated. “I mean, except the times I thought he was better and then-”
“John.”
Sherlock hurts.
. From now on. From now on. He has to do better.
“I believe I’m quite exhausted.” It’s also quiet. But deep. Resonating. Travelling.
“I wouldn’t because you don’t deserve pity, John”, Sherlock says patiently. “The situations you have found yourself in would be enough to break any lesser man”
“What it says”
“Okay”
“You’re up?”
There are tears in his eyes for a completely different reason now. He wants to share this. With him. With Sherlock. He wants to so much that it’s weighing him down. Even if the genius knew already. She’s going to be happy again in the afternoon, when she’ll have her elephant back. She’ll smile at him and next time he’ll explain her why he had to clean it. Next time she’ll know Papa is going to get it back again.
“Yes... Sure.”
‘We truly haven’t. We have not even scratched the surface of all there is to be resolved’
He’s met with silence.
So why is he so nervous?
Sherlock chews on the inside of his lower lip, as John slices the oranges in half and washes them again for good measure. “I can take tablets”
John frowns.
“How are we feeling today?”
The voice falters in his mind and he’s staggering, slapped by his own hand. What an unfortunate comparison. John closes his eyes. A desperate shout. A fist. Clutching on fabric. ‘Is this a game?’ There is nothing he can do to black out the images rushing to his head. The trembling hands. The scalpel. Thescalpelthescalpel
“If you’re worried I might judge you or him based on what I already know; I need to remind you that I’m not here to judge anyone.”
Fell. Arms outstretched, like an angel. Falling.
“Yes”, John makes a face that says
Sherlock nods, putting the gingernut on the plate again. John arches a fond eyebrow.
A higher-pitched roll of giggles joins his. And then the trees are laughing, their branches, like fingers stretching to the sky, shaking with it, and the sky is the breaths that turn into hiccups in his throat, the sun the waterfall trapped inside him.
He remembers how John did not falter when saying this the previous night. How his eyes had burned with fervent urgency, as if he’d wanted to make his words take solid substance between them. To make Sherlock believe them.
John sits back, not pressing.
Please, as always, heed the tags!
Redbeard left, Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Why?”, Sherlock frowns.
‘Yeah, okay!’
Instinct kicks in. “I’m sorry”
“Yes. Yes, of course, John.” The deep voice is quiet but sure, almost reverent.
His voice sounds like crumpled paper.
“Do you mind..?”
Deep down, I-… I couldn’t forgive you. For relapsing. I- I wanted you to be well. I wanted you to not care what happened to me, to live your life and never think of me again but…”
“Oh, you little tease.” John tickles her chin. “Trying to get your bath cold, are you?”
“Sherlock…”
The voice in his head tuts but for once, he ignores it.
No. It’s not. Again. Yet. Still. It’s not alright. And it’s not going to be. Not anytime soon. He hangs his head low and forces his way through the rest of his shift, leaving the clinic as quickly as he can. Work is not a distraction enough. He’s failing. Falling. Hard.
“You okay?” John prompts, his voice soft. His smile as well, longing for good old times where this question left his lips constantly. Checking, worrying, double-checking. Sherlock always there with a nod, a shrug, a word, a smile.
Not anymore. Not this time...
It won’t
“I know. Me most of all”, she says, slowly. “I
‘Mm… She will be well-rested for tomorrow’
“Hey… You have a leaf in your hair”
“You think it will? Peak again?”
“Ready?”
John’s eyes have taken on that murderous glint, his entire body has stiffened in a posture of defence, like a wolf on alert; hackles raised, teeth bared in a snarl with no sound. A warning.
Honeybee babbles the way she does when she wants to call him. He hurries to her side, presses a kiss to her chubby, pink cheek. She shows him the new tower of blocks she has made -four stacked this time- and the more he stays the more he is absorbed, until they’re playing together. He hands her the blocks and she stacks them, starting new every time a little tower topples over. Every time she points on the numbers or letters on the blocks and he names and pronounces clearly for her.
They reach an empty playground. Sherlock kneels, letting his coat billow behind him, and unstraps Rosie, who lingers close as he stands again to takes off the baby carrier, rolling his numb shoulders to force some circulation back into them. She’s growing heavier day by day.
John presses a hand to his mouth, suppressing a giggle.
“Alright, little one. Alright”, John soothes, but she is not buying it. “Right… Should get cooking, then-”
‘I want to go back...’
Have to focus on Rosie.
John’s gaze falls to the table between them.
For now.
So, he allows himself at least this...
“Rosie’s lucky.”
‘He kissed me’
First, he attempts to stand. On unsure as if new-born feet and wobbly knees. It doesn’t work. He slides down, not gracefully, long limbs no use to him, not now. He collects them to him with a soft gasp when he finds himself sitting on the floor. He cradles what is left of him, chest rising and falling like that of a terrified bird. He will try again; there is nothing to it. Sherlock cannot bear to wonder how it came to this.
Sherlock stands and walks to the kitchen, without intercepting John’s anxiety parade for one. He flicks the kettle switch on, retrieves two mugs, two teabags from the box on the counter. There is ample space for it, and other boxes of spices, containers for rice and pasta now, without microscope, meth lab and experiments taking up space.
“With a secret signal. A password.”
He sighs, slowly, reluctant to part with so much air at once, afraid it will make him light-headed. His exhale catches in his throat, like a half-formed sob was nestled there and latched on the air leaving him. Sherlock fights past it, through it. Until his breaths flock together way too fast, and his back is shaking, and he is gasping, panic bubbling as it rises in his chest.
Only now, there is something freer and more genuine about this. The weight of the unknown expectation has lifted. Sherlock knows what John needs, now; normalcy and stability. A non-hostile, predictable environment. The safety of a cozy routine. This is what Sherlock must ensure, along with letting John feel he can stand on his feet, he can be a father, he can be alright.
“Later.”
“Sherlock.” His voice is firm.
Adding two weeks of recovery. At the very least.
Sherlock’s ocean dreams often made him snap awake with a rapid heartrate, panting, sweat soaking through his tee, as if he had really been swimming. Many a times John’s eyes were punctured with dark circles, and he looked older, so much older. Many a time Sherlock would hesitate to speak too much, be too assertive, to ask for more, to draw attention to him and Honeybee together, would be unsure of what exactly he was allowed to do, would be afraid of screwing things up; it was both habit and active, conscious trepidation, with a twinge of fear at its tail. Other times John would be brooding, impatient with himself. But they held. They tried.
“I’m listening”
“Oi! Wanna look at the mirror for a sec?”
“No need”
‘Junkie’
“What are you saying?” John has already lost his calm, fighting over a topic that he could never win anyway. And only now does she reveal the sting at the tail.
“Exactly!” John bumps their hips together, adrenaline spiking at having made Sherlock’s teasing side be active again. “Anybody could be a hoarder of hidden treasures.”
“Dr Watson?”
“Yeah, he… has… I mean, my head is so full of Rosie right now, you can understand-”
“Oh, no. No, no, Sherlock.” John’s thoughts are rushing in before him. “It’s alright. All well.” He doesn’t want Sherlock to feel ashamed no matter what. Not with him. “All well, I promise.” He lets his hand ease into movement, sliding over Sherlock’s back. “Tell me how you feel?”
They’ve been relaxing, taking turns soothing or watching over Rosie, anxiously waiting for the twenty-four-hour mark of when her fever started falling. Sherlock is downstairs, waiting for John’s verdict. One more check up and John can safely promise to their little girl that she can sleep peacefully through the night with no interruption. John finds he is sweating, fingers slippery as he grips the cot’s bars, looking over at his little sleeping angel. She should be okay. He shouldn’t be so worried. As long as she closes another twenty-four hours without a fever at all tomorrow, she’s good to go, but he’s quite optimistic that she’s all done with the cold now already.
“I would never believe I deserved it. Not one bit. I would only… I would only think you… you believed you deserved what happened, what I did to you. I knew I couldn’t live like that. I didn’t want
He has no right to be doing this. No right to let her go to the next available person as he always did before. But Sherlock is not the next available person. Sherlock is… Sherlock is Sherlock and he loves her and takes care of her like no one else does and he knows her best and even after a hard night’s sleep when John has no right whatsoever to be-
“I mean, I-”
“There you are, then.”
John looks away. There’s doubt there still, in that stubborn head of his. But there is something they share now, for a while, a small wave of suppressed, giddy excitement.
A pause. A breather.
“Sherlock, what is going on with you and John?”
“’m sorry...” he whispers.
After all, Sherlock’s with him. Sherlock is with him. Sherlock is with him. Sherl-
“Mm?”
He is unexpectedly rewarded with the upward tug of the corner of John's lips.
“Harry.” His tone has regained his previous warning. “If I may be frank with you, as
But now, he only remembers the leaf. The whimsical brown leaf that had made John reach and cup his face in a palm to disentangle it from his hair. He remembers the heat boiling under his skin, the tingles paralysing him, the breath he had been holding. And he remembers something more. He remembers
John closes his eyes. Swallows.
A small note: Ella (in our universe, at least) is certified both as a psychologist and a psychaitrist, specialising in the problems veterans often face coming home: PTSD, addiction, etc.
“Okay”
“He does wear an expensive watch.”
‘Nope.’
“If you need to leave. I don’t want to be late to… to stop you.” It starts small but grows bit by bit, drop by drop. “I know I probably don’t…” The veil of fear overcoming him. “…do enough. I was not-” And here it chokes him again. “…worthy of knowing why you left and still am not now, just…” John is shuddering. “I would like to know.” Heaving. “If you…” Shake. “Now…” Pant. “I couldn’t bare it if…” Sob.
Sherlock is standing a few feet away, eyes fixated on scanning John’s body. Something’s off. John frowns and nudges his way through jumbled thoughts to realise that he can’t see Sherlock’s whole face. The occurrence is so rare that he couldn’t even name it. There’s a hand over his friend’s lips, twitchy, tense. John could guess he’s pressing his thumb against his teeth, maybe mouthing his nails, but... Sherlock doesn’t do that. Does he?
John’s eyes travel from his hair to his eyes, and back again, and his face contorts.
‘Let me hurt him.’
“On the last day of September.” He finishes deepening his voice in a tease; dragging long round notes, resembling a poor imitation of Opera.
John startles. Sherlock has left his plate on the tray again, his leg twitching. ‘Christ, I’ve been making him anxious. Fuck.’
“Why are we having this conversation, John?”
“Sherlock? Alright?”
The air around John is crackling. Sherlock leans against the kitchen table, dares it approach. Lets it flow through him and leave him intact. Poison being drawn out.
Sherlock groans, turning to curl the other way, his back stuck to John’s side. John lets him. He still hasn’t gotten out of his head; penguin now hidden under a sofa cushion, John imagines.
There’s fire in his head and he can’t put it off. He tries, yet again, but it persists. Anger, it’s called. Hot, burning, consuming anger. He’s on his own. Hopeless. Helpless. A mess.
As if on cue, Honeybee sneezes, and curls closer to Mrs. Hudson with a whimper. Mrs. Hudson holds her closer, but when her eyes meet Sherlock’s, he can see alarm in them.
, too.  It never stopped being quintessentially John, even though Sherlock logically knew it was nothing but a trick his mind played on him. He knew it wasn’t real.
catch him. He can move again. He won’t let him fall. Oh, the joy. Oh, the anticipation.
“Mhm.” Sherlock gets up and hops to the kitchen, dressing gown belt hanging loose behind him.
“Yeah”
“Whatever day suits you best, but I want my little Rosie rested, mind you!”
Guilt.
John watches as Sherlock tries to hide a small smile and leans down to place a soft and lingering kiss over Rosie’s forehead. John Watson watches and it’s the brightest he’s felt in his new sober life.
He fiddles with the options he has, running through the contact list on his phone. His thumb hovers over two names. One, he hates asking for favours. To hear that voice, coated with sarcasm like the heavily syrupy cakes it’s is so fond of… The other choice, the other name… The one he has let down too many times to count -despite the multiple slaps. He twists his phone between thumb and index, hesitates. Puts it aside. Whatever he does, he’ll have to do alone. Honeybee stirs into his lap and turns to look at him again.
Part of their choreography of orbiting,
“Morning.”
He hates it.
He gets up on soundless bare feet. Throws his blue dressing gown on, hiding the trackmark scars on his arms.
“What?”
Tears. Cries. Rage. Despair.
“What?” John speaks, startled from his reverie.
“She’s going to be alright.”
John keeps pacing.
Heeello there, lovely people. We took the late shift today, but we're here! :)
Silence followed and prickles went up John’s spine, icy fingers, preparing him for defence.
Save John Watson. He hadn’t saved him, had he? DVD or not, John had returned to his rescue. But Sherlock was not a man for whom anyone would want to fight. The last ten days had proved that. The weeks spent in hospital had proved that. John had saved him because… Because he was John. But Sherlock could not save him because he was Sherlock.
“You didn’t think I’d be satisfied with enjoying them only as take-away forever, did you?”
The singular reply. Even if there was already a half-finished mug on the coffee table. John hadn’t stopped to look. All he truly remembers now is the glimpse he got at the tensed up, long figure, contemplating him knowingly. Was it hurt he saw? Surrender? A posture suggesting the simple fact the owner had given up on life itself? John pushed it all away. Yet again. Coward.
“I have not finished.” Greg shouts to the door.
It’s like the end of an era. The final lines of a book. Even if nothing has changed on the surface, everything has; everything could, as when the plates of the earth are shifting. It is a distinct, definite point slicing space and time, and he is watching it being created. There will be a ‘before this conversation’ and an ‘after this conversation’ when this moment is over. Sherlock does not know what the ‘after’ will entail, if it will be for better or worse.
It only takes John Watson in love, to stay and count his beloved’s breaths through the night. Because that is what he is. Friend. Companion. Beloved. For him to curl over the sheets and watch as the chest he saw crushed by pavement, bullet, and John’s own feet, makes slow circles of rising and falling. Circles of life. Collarbones accentuated by force of nature. Sternum lined and bony, staying alive by force of will alone.
There is whizzing in his ears, as if he were holding his head under water. And with a snap-the bursting to the surface for air-, the ears pop, and the world rushes in, cold, merciless wind.
Indian (Ocean): the third largest, and overall warmest ocean of the world.
She stops kicking, whimpers to the sound of his voice.
John said he had lost himself. In his regret, his pain, his anger. That he had never wanted them to become what they had become either. That he had never wanted to harm him. To leave him. He saw Sherlock as someone who deserved better, as someone to care about so much that he’d sink with him. He
Despite the tone, John’s chest floods with relief. A single breath leaves him, kept tight by his lungs; unbeknownst to him. It’s a warm puff of air against the relatively chilly wood of the door. The door he stared at for hours, providing him questions or emptiness, is now proving to be solace and refuge as he leans on it, instinctively. He hadn’t noticed that either.
There’s a stumble and he loses his footing. Falters. The eyes are looking at him now. Again. Questioning but understanding at the same time. John falls. Body surges forward. He falls and he pushes and scrambles for purchase. Fingers flexing over the edge. Cement edge of a building. No. Not
Sherlock opens his eyes with a start. The white of the bathroom is blinding.
“Hoping for your ‘I told you so’ speech?”
John sniffs his nose as he contemplates his next words. His thumb is brushing little ticklish circles over the fabric on Sherlock’s knee. Sherlock squirms a little, but does not tell him to stop.
“Yeah, ‘course, apologies for that. I did not know she would pass by”
This time, she does not throw a pouty tantrum for not having spent half the day at home. She whines and extends both hands, little fists clenching and unclenching in the air in her attempt to hold him, to have him hold her. Sherlock takes her in his arms at once and boops her nose in reassurance. She boops back.
“I don’t need your permission”, the woman snaps.
“This has never happened before!” The man huffed, a desperate whine surfacing in his tone, hands thrown in the air; exasperated. “It’s been happening all day!”
"Yes", he breathes.
An answering pair of arms coils around him.
“No, it’s quite alright. Keep her.”
He can never do or be enough. Can never be who he wants to be. It’s forfeit. His ‘destiny’. It has been snatched away for most of his life. Forbidden. Hidden. Never to surface.
John shivers. Sherlock is always there, unwavering, supporting, believing. He already believed John is that man, that soldier, brave and facing up to what he’s done. And John did it. He is doing it right now. Proving Sherlock right. Sherlock already believed John was the man he deserved. All along. Always. No matter what.
right.
“Me. It’s me, John. The one to go. It’s me”
“We’re here sweetheart. We’re with you.”
Sherlock’s long fingers remove the teabags and bring their mugs over. His knuckles are only a tad redder because of the heat. John bites his lip, lets it slide free, and strives to reach and help.
“Nope”
“Ugh… sorry, sorry, my fault.” John mumbles.
And now, Sherlock is offered a way in. A glimpse.
Because the magpie would return.
Isolation -one of his first and easiest solutions before- is unacceptable. He can’t just leave and give everything up. In any case, locking himself away from the world could end much worse for everyone. It’s a somehow comforting thought. The fact that he consciously feels this is crazy. Taking it out on his body, his mind, or washing it away with the bottles that lay down empty, in the abandoned living room last time he overdid it. It is crazy. It puts him off.
There were eyes looking back at him that John couldn’t block. The cold image of lifelessness flashing before him at that internal bruise around Sherlock’s iris. Haunting.
“Anything will do.” Sherlock huffs, getting on with his search.
Sherlock’s chest cracks.
Intertidal: Pertaining to the shore areas that alternate between submergence and nonsubmergence due to tidal oscillation.
Sherlock smiles, with the safety that John won’t see.
Sherlock’s chest deflates with a breath he’s been holding. John watches it, how he lifts Rosie up and down with his every sigh.
John looks at him again. Warmth breaks through the storm in his eyes, a moment of calm. Sherlock can see the faintest of smiles wanting to form. “You’d almost think she should know about that”.
No. No. He cared. He had helped her to get away. He had reassured her what Father said wasn’t true and she could be happy, she could have a family, she could- No. It’s not his fault she ruined herself and her life. He’s not
“Sherlock?”
doesn’t help.
Everything is frozen. John’s eyes meet the cold, piercing holes of Sherlock’s, dark and silent as the eye of a storm. It’s a countenance he hasn’t seen in quite a while. All in contrast to what he remembers but still the same. Sherlock stands tall over the line in the flooring separating kitchen and living room. He’s barefoot, dressing gown draped over his shoulders, baggy pyjamas falling over his skeleton-like body and his curls are hopelessly ruffled, but he’s still the same man that stood imposing over criminals and policemen, thieves, adulterers, murderers, detectives and inaccurate forensic scientists. Squishing every bit of juice, they had in them with words and puzzles. With truths they hoped to keep forever buried.
He couldn’t be. He couldn’t have been sure. He couldn’t have known. But he wanted to believe. All it would take was one hit. Then a next. And another. Keeping him going. Putting the hypothesis to the test. Destroying himself with the possibility of John coming back.
“Why don’t we start with what’s easier? I understand no information is mundane concerning one’s child but, please, John, try to start with easy, small, mundane facts anyone could know.”
“Well, for starters, he doesn’t question my decision to raise Rosie myself.”
How could Sherlock Holmes come by that and have nobody notice before? John had no clue.
“I-I can’t. Not here.”
“Sherlock?” he calls, tickling Rosie’s toes as he holds her, on their way to the kitchen. “Joining us for dinner?”
Can a falling body sound like an incoming bomb? No. It can’t. It shouldn’t. Yet, it does.
“Hey, man, you alright?”
How can someone so young be so wise? Even Sherlock… his eyes sometimes are even younger than John’s daughter…
The taste of food had not been unwelcome. It was grounding; the savoury toast, the smooth butter. And then the sweetness of the scone coating his tongue. The act of eating, the methodical biting and cutting and chewing, had given him a slow, manageable way through one state and into the other. He got down a handful of bites of each, the toast and scone. Then set his knife down, and kept his gaze lowered.
He frowns.
“Looking for something?” his tone soft, John tries to catch Sherlock’s gaze but fails.
“Do you think he trusts you?” It was a fine form of reassurance, reminding him all that he’d said himself, making him consider again and come to a logical conclusion, undisturbed by his fears.
But he’s worried, damn it. Too worried. He needs to- He wants to- ‘Christ, why is this so hard?’
Accretion: May be either natural or artifical. Natural accretion is the buildup of land, solely by the action of the forces of nature, on a beach by deposition of water-borne or airborne material. Artificial accretion is a similar buildup of land by reason of an act of man, such as the accretion formed by a groin, breakwater, or beach fill deposited by mechanical means.
‘Damn.’
‘I almost did. After years. After he had… risked everything. I almost killed him.’
He hates it because good morning and goodnight - rarely spoken but their last hope of communication - just isn’t enough. It’s not enough. Because it’s his fault. He knows what he could do to make it better, but he doesn’t even know if he’s allowed anymore. He could make breakfast. He could wake Sherlock up instead of that bloody alarm John hears every morning, while pretending to sleep after his nausea and nightmares before the dawn. He could really take care of Sherlock – that’s why he’s here, damn it – but he hasn’t been doing any of it.
Sherlock huffs, eyes drifting, used to hiding their shine of joy.
He had shouted. Sherlock had been there. Rosie had been there. He had... he had lost control.
“Oh! And you can let your little girl down if she wants to play. There’s a special place over there.” She points to an organised little playground where two other toddlers are strolling. “But everything is clean and sterilised regularly if she doesn’t want to be away from you.”
‘Should have.’
“Don’t we want to know what are malamutes bred for, little love?” He teases her, arching an eyebrow when Sherlock doesn’t chime in at once. She raises her head, lips pouty in concentration, trying to follow the exact meaning of his words, suspecting a trick by the playful tone of his voice.
“But you need-”
“Cheerful...” His mind keeps circling, suspicious.
Sherlock is clenching his teeth so hard his jaw is sore. His breaths are so shallow they tear his chest raw. The tiniest sound is drilling through his ears to his brain, and he can’t think, he can’t bloody
She protested, wanting to play more, but he murmured as soothingly as he could. Her lower lip began to quiver anyway.
He watches the way Sherlock holds her; different than his own. The way he strokes her hair, pats her back. John observes for the first time this rare occurrence that must happen every day when he’s not home. He realises little by little how much more Sherlock knows her, understands her. He has been her main caretaker for the better part of a month and already knows everything there is about her. John remembers all the times Sherlock has given him a full report of all her activities throughout the day, his tone indicating that nothing was amiss, so much that John didn’t even register the fact that Sherlock knew everything because he did everything with her. John has been thinking of him as Rosie’s family no matter what, but hadn’t actually attributed him all the credit he should get for it. He remembers Sherlock’s young and childish face, all bent on the mission, the work, the next case, chase, the new puzzle, in search of a higher class of criminal he could take down. With a pang of unexpected pride, John realises just how much the image differs from this new, a few years older, countless painful mission later Sherlock. How much Sherlock Holmes, the consulting detective, distant, cold and unfeeling could change and mellow through the years. Or was it just the resurfacing of his actual self what was happening…?
He leaves the bedroom soundlessly, without once looking at John.
Sherlock. No.
“He must have arranged it, yes” He pushes the thought away before it can take hold of him again with icy fingers.
He closes his eyes, meditating over his breathing for as long as it takes to deem his rhythm normal again, and gets up. There is certainty in his steps as he walks over and places a clinical palm inches above his little girl’s nose and lips. ‘Sleeping fine.’
He growls, slams a palm to his temple, trying to pry the voice and everything else away. He doesn’t need his brain to wake up now. No, he definitely doesn’t need that.
John’s eyes stray over silk and pyjama shirt buttons, lingering on the patch of skin showing under Sherlock’s poking out, sharp collarbones. He reminds himself that this is Sherlock Holmes who never had trouble finding a pin in whatever mess 221B might have been and shakes himself, frowning. It’s certainly not the first time this has happened in the last month.
His eyes travelled from his daughter -on the floor where he’d just left her, his face covered with the baby food he’d tried to wipe from her hands-, to Sherlock -on his armchair, phone in hand- and back. Both sets of eyes averted their gaze; again.
John inhales, sharply. “Harry”. Sherlock waits. John is solid, the way solid flames would be. “I just… I’m really,
“Just… Thank you.” He presses his lips together, feels the dry cracks and draws them between his teeth, wetting them with his tongue as he considers, looking low at his hands. “Not just for this… when I came back from work… But for this morning. Rosie. It has been a while since I- I had the chance to experience… Her. Her firsts. Her achievements. Something particular she did so I could remind her and tell her how proud I am because of it.”
"John snarls. No. Just a dream. Is it a dream? No. This is reality. His feet find flesh. His fists find hair.  A yank. A throw. A tuft left between cold fingers. Dripping blood. One lonely ebony curl. No. A step back and he’s on the roof again"
Familiar. Memories flood him. Memories of real accusations flying from his pursed lips, showering Sherlock with anything that he might have done slightly wrong. Mundane things. Not too important. In those they used to agree. This is the point when the dismissal usually comes. The mockery, the flick of a hand over a shoulder.
“We do...” he contemplates. They do...
“Oh.” John looks at the paper cup with wide eyes.
A breath, eyes burning a little, looking up, defensive but meaning it. Every part of it.
John is frozen. Because Sherlock is having bad nights. Sherlock is having dreams. Sherlock has trouble sleeping and John hates the fact he can’t -for the life of him- think of a single thing to help him. Sleep medication strictly not allowed and all kinds of restrictions and tips of how after addiction the body needs to find its own rhythm again, floating hatefully through his mind.
“So… You need time. What you went through… Your body’s defences are burdened enough already”
your fault”
Sherlock catches his gaze as he puts the phone away, back in John’s pocket. And he’s close. So close. And he’s smiling. An easy smile. A simple nod of encouragement. A nudge. As if John’s words to his daughter brush over Sherlock’s curls too. As if he already knows the soothing, steady tones and how they work. As if those tones are perfect in their broken imperfection.
“I thought we made my views on that clear” An immovable wall.
John nods with military precision.
He had not seen what happened. He had heard a crash, and when he had looked, Honeybee was hugging the leg of the kitchen table to stay on her feet, her eyes twin lakes with a stone dropped in their middle, concentric circles reaching out shakily. Half the tablecloth and its contents were strewn on the floor, the jam lid still wheeling away before it had hit the side of the doorframe and collapsed, after spinning around itself like a coin.
‘What do I do?’, he gasped, reaching.
He stood on a ledge. The ledge. Cement one. High up. At least the stairs weren’t for nothing. He panted in smoke, choked, breathed, fell.
“So…”, John tries.
Sherlock’s eyes are wide now, filled with a surprise that John isn’t sure if he wants to welcome or feel guilty over its existence.
“You’re… not?” He is not moving. He can’t.
How many secrets? Sherlock won’t be able to hide it forever. His broken mind, or his little problem. Some day he will not succeed at pretending. And what will happen then?
For a moment it all stops. It is the moment where the roller coaster ride has reached the highest point and is preparing for the plunge. It crashes down on him; the sound of his heart, his lungs, his thrumming veins. He gasps, scrambles for a way out.
He can only feel like a child, complaint making his chin tremble. ‘What did I do? What did I do?’
Silence.
The answer is always there.
“Yes.” No hesitation. “Anything.”
WHEW! Has been a long and bumpy ride, hasn't it? Seems like we're on track? Yes! Yes we are. So, hang on. There's so much more to come!
John walks away with a chuckle, enjoying the vibrations on his throat that only Sherlock can cause. He’s not accustomed to it; to be giggling to himself like a schoolgirl as he climbs the stairs to check on his little girl.
“Alright, what do you want?” She sighs then, facade fading.
“She needs you.”
Her face is fear stricken and puffed up, red from exertion. She takes a breath and he draws strength from the momentary silence.
“There’s children that have been through worse”
It puzzles Sherlock how John learned to be like that, so soft and gentle, if he had no one to show him how. Of course, he is like that with Rosie only, and being a parent is supposed to have the ability to change a person in ways Sherlock would not know. But still. John is, broadly speaking, a man of action, decisions, bluntness, matter-of-fact and potentially coarse with everyone else. Not that John Watson is not a man that never fails to surprise him. But it is a rather remarkable transformation.
Yes. Again.
Sherlock’s hands don’t move to hold Rosie into them. She’s thankfully so deep into sleep that she doesn’t know or see what’s happening.
An eerie silence falls over them like a veil and it’s so believable that John almost makes for the stairs to put her finally back to sleep but a pained cry starts and grows, drilling into his ears a moment after.
His fingers grab the doorknob tight but tremble all the same. Half a turn. That’s all he needs. He is hesitating, the conclusion as harsh as the impact of a falling body mass on cement. John can’t turn a simple doorknob. It infuriates him.
“Oh, don’t worry, we work with all kinds of families here, I assure you we’re not into discriminating. We respect every family and parent and child that might step in here. Our only goal is to help the children be happy.”
Guilt.
“I got her a new book a couple of days ago. ‘Chemistry for Babies’, or something. It’s hilarious but… You know. Why not. Thought maybe you’d like to read it to her”. John bites his lip.
“I am honoured to be your friend”, Sherlock said, softly. He felt the weight that lifted off from John’s shoulders, because it lifted from his, too.
Chloe hums at that extra piece of information. John doesn’t care what she thinks -which is probably something good anyway-, he is proud of his fight to recovery. It’s for his daughter, for his little girl, for Sherlock and for his own self. He should be proud and he is. At his best moments.
John is the one to watch for at the end, cringing at his own snappish words, just because Sherlock’s always well-placed questions struck a chord. He sighs.
“Sorry. Sorry, little one.” He responds to her little inquisitive syllables and sniffs a bit more, cupping her face and composing himself, back straightened. Soldier stance; check. “It’s just- your little adventure had us worried and now…”
John looks at him, for a hard, long while. He seems genuinely perplexed. And then he sits on the chair beside his.
“Thirty-eight point five. Two minutes ago.”
Sherlock’s eyes are hurting, but the tears won’t break through, as if they’re air-bubbles trapped beneath the ice. His face feels disproportionately hot to the rest of his body, the way it burns when he is ashamed. His fingers curl into loose fists -the left has begun to tremble.
“I will never leave you, little boo.” A whisper. Another knot untangled.
Greg Lestrade, was at an interrogation room. Reporting his own wrongdoings as something Sherlock Holmes deserved. It was Greg’s job to not interfere with his statement. He could not have possibly been there as a friend. He let John have it. All the madness. The miserable ‘shot Magnussen in the face’ excuse. So much pain… all caused by him. John Watson. The man Sherlock Holmes tried to save by that single firing shot. And John had gone and said… He draws back, disgusted with himself.
John nods, eyes narrowed towards burning wood. Of course, Sherlock could guess, would have guessed, deduced, knew why John would leave his cane behind. Of course, he should have known the chances of seeing John again after it were minimal. Of course, John knows this now. Which is why he is tremendously grateful at Sherlock letting him say it for both of them. Letting him have his way through this undeterred. Guessing he needed it and leaving him space. ‘Thank you.’
John steps inside. He breathes. The door closes behind him. He walks to the edge of the bed, distantly reminded of such a similar situation from days ago. They made it then. Why wouldn’t it work now?
He has tired of the problem being him, of the fruitless search for what is wrong with him, and of the fear of what the discovery of his uselessness will bring. Today his hands are prickling with the need to write, to measure, to type. Sherlock does not know how or why. He is not the same, he is not capable of grand feats anymore, is he? It would only be pitiful if he tried to deduce. Yet the thirst, the curiosity, are here again, pumping through his veins.
“I am starting to have the faintest feeling this conversation is only a vicious circle”, Sherlock tries cautiously, dragging the words. It almost sounds funny.
Memories too recent for John to ignore. ‘I hit him.’
#we_feed_on_comments
‘I know.’
He was not planning on telling him up to now anyway. Tonight’s confrontation with Harry, and what Sherlock heard because of it, do not change that.
Sherlock nods.
Sherlock’s entire world cartwheels on the spot.
Sherlock is looking away. It’s gone. It’s done. That clarity. His gaze now falls somewhere behind John. Lost and without will.
As they near the centre of the park, more people begin to intercept their path or pass by them. Few look, and even fewer linger on what they see if they do look. There are old couples swaying softly with their arms linked, mothers with strollers or toddlers, people walking their dogs, or others jogging by, their feet steady as a metronome as they thump against the ground.
This time, he could sit in his armchair, opposite them after the dishes were done, without Sherlock flinching. He had made an immediate motion to transfer her to John, however.
Warnings from the previous chapter continue here.
He’s hyperventilating. ‘Great.’ Stopping himself in the middle of a shaky breath, he forces a smile.
Rosie pushes her palms against his chest more insistently, annoyed at the tight hold. He lets go, returning back to normal, pressing fingers over his eyes.
Sherlock waits until the no doubt mesmerized waitress has walked away before he looks again. He finds John’s gaze on him.
“Got you a whole-wheat, veggie baguette, and tea”
“Tea, yeah?”
John finds he is not anxious. He finds he is at a plane of utter peace. All because Sherlock sounds so…
John will make sure she’s comfortable.
“Okay. Um, well, Rosie is 22 months old.”
“Nobody likes having the sniffles, I think”
Sherlock smiles, leafing through the book like an excited child. “And the toes?”
“I’m fucking glad Clara had the right mind to dumb you.”
John freezes.
Kudos and bookmarks are hugely appreciated, and we love seeing your comments, too! Hope you enjoyed!
‘Not now.’
“Want some water?”, he asked as he got up and to the kitchen sink.
There is no mistaking his bearing, his stride, the way his breaths rise and fall. In a sea of people, a million of them, as intertwined and inseparable as the drops that together make the water, Sherlock would know him, would
? No, that was out of the question. How could Sherlock know when John will snap next? How could anyone? Plus, the former -for the moment- detective wouldn’t even discuss it -or anything regarding
He wants to cure this. He wants to scare the ghosts away, smooth out the cracks with his fingertips, make the depths of these eyes smile again. But… Could he?...Could he?  His thumb brushes over Sherlock’s cheek,  in awe of the strength… The fragility… The discovery and the thought itself… Forbidden. Needed. Unattainable. Like the stars. The moon…
They shared the chicken noodle soup on the kitchen table. As they would share takeaways on sleepless nights, or after the adrenaline of a case; microscope and equipment, pig ears and human digits, pipettes and test-tubes, empty or filled glistening with golden liquids, or blue or purple, haphazardly pushed to the far edge of the table-top to make space for steaming paper cartons of noodles and won-tons and curries, fried rice and eggs and miso soups.
And the words circulate. Hollow now.
“Um… Good. It’s- good”
“Right”
(See the end of the chapter for
The words startle Sherlock enough for his gaze to tumble down to John’s chest. He shrugs, nods, is unexpectedly extremely aware of his hands and of his inability to think anything to do with them, finally mouths a dismissive ‘pah’ and turns to head for the kitchen, to the sound of the closing door behind him.
‘Huh.’
John looks at him, as if he is seeing him for the first time. It looks as if he is searching for something.
“Divorced. Currently single. With a decade-long alcohol problem. Clean now, but- Is that a patch on your arm? Of course it is -The stress levels at your new position are quite heightened, aren't they? You're used to a 9 to 5, not a freelance career and you're
“Nowhere…? I think. There’s no problem, I- I want this, I… I do.” His nose is scrunching up. He remembers Sherlock’s skin under his touch. His too short facial hair that are never fully shaved to the skin anymore. The jam.
“Oh.” He lets his fingertip slip from his lips. “Nothing much. Really. Barely felt it.”
is the one who could be a danger to her. A negative influence. A disgusting example. Not John. Never John. But even if Sherlock doesn’t regret protecting John and Honeybee, he can’t help but think that it is his presence that exacerbates the agitation between the siblings. If he was not part of the equation, then Harry would not be feeling the way she is. And John… If Sherlock had never returned from Serbia, wouldn’t his life have been better?
He’s standing in front of a small reception desk. The waiting room cosy and brightly lit but warm, not at all resembling crisp clean white corridors of a clinic or a health centre or hospital. A kind, young practitioner smiling at him from over her computer screen, filled with stickers on the back and decorated with plastic toys on the base. Sherlock is standing beside him, gloves gripped tight on a palm, the other hidden under his Belstaff, fidgeting at his side; John guesses. God, he’s doing everything for Rosie. For them. He’s risking
A sigh.
He wants more. He wants to shower him in eternity with kisses, as many as the ocean’s drops. But no. Each kiss will be singular. Savoured. Painfully savoured. Ephemera, wings fickle under the sun, a kaleidoscope of longing.
“Don’t they have a particular biological characteristic? Helping their muscles heal quicker after and during extensive exercise?” John remembers in a rush of excitement, old knowledge clicking in from who knows how many years ago.
“Cause a racket.”
“Sherlock…?” John’s voice is soft, his eyebrow knitted together, tugging that bit upwards. He is afraid. Tired. There is no façade now. It’s only the man that panicked because Sherlock might leave. The man that held his hand to soothe him. That leaned against him, as much as he took care of him. The man that smiled at him when he saw him in the morning, as if the sight truly gave him joy.
“Hey, hey, it’s, it’s alright, there she is, there we are.” John offers Rosie towards him, eyes wide.
Then Rosie bites at her blankets, letting tears fall.
. John brushes his fingertips over the small forehead filled with messy, sunny curls and smiles. Sometimes she’s so quiet, it frightens him, making him long for the sleepless nights of her first months. But he knows, she’ll be alright. He’ll make it so. He’ll always be there for her from now on.
And how could Sherlock ever have forgiven him such a thing? How, when it’s inevitable, when it’s in his blood, in his brain, in his bones?
John takes comfort in their shared familiarity, the way their words fall just right and their gazes are never far apart. He knows how to breach the subject. The air is easy between them as it has been since this afternoon. John calm again, had played with his little girl, made sure she knew how proud he was of her little drawing and helped her start some new ones, promised to buy her new pens tomorrow after their appointment. They had made dinner together while Rosie giggled at a BBC Disney singalong, pointing at a few songs with a pout on her baby lips until both of them promised to watch those movies whole together.
With this and that they had forgotten the fireplace and tonight was pretty chilly. John stands up and grabs a blanket, folded and deposited on his armchair. Sherlock’s firm gaze trembles and he bites his lip. Just for a moment. He reaches with his right hand and takes it, getting up with a huff and stumbling a bit to the sofa, closer to the electric heater, trying to maintain his
A smile sweet as the dawn’s morning light, pink and azure painting up the sky in slow brush strokes, grows over Sherlock’s lips. John mirrors it.
“Hm. We can discuss this maybe next week?”
John nods, grateful.
“How?”
“Oh, right. Bad Papa took your elephant yesterday, didn’t he?”
Soon, he discovers a second rhythmic breathing beside his own. The curtains are drawn closed, the only light coming in is from the tiny window at the back kitchen-wall, not even the cooker light is on. John serves two glasses this time. He feels his way to his armchair and sits. He’s not afraid. He knows whose breaths he is hearing. He knows how deep it sounds and how long Sherlock normally holds it.
Sherlock’s lower lip is trembling. His face, it’s an expression he has not seen before. It’s an old man facing betrayal for the umpteenth time, it’s a child feeling pain for the first. It’s the glance John did not see when he went to that hospital to say goodbye. It’s the knowledge of that glance that hurts the most; of a soul that knows, just
“Tsk tsk” John rebukes. “The Detective Inspector came to see us unshaved? Unacceptable.”
“John.” The gentle breeze of spring.
“John! Well, suppose it’s nice to see you too.” Greg says but his eyes crinkle, tentative surprise at the welcoming tease.
Rosie is tossing and turning in her cot. He is making sure she’s not tangling to her covers when she opens her eyes. He smiles, brushing her cheek.
“I heard what happened”
“Of course.” Time starts running again and John can breathe.
. As he is now. Barefoot. Aching. Gravel between his toes, biting in his skin as he runs. Runs to catch the coated figure at the edge. Runs and screams and is happy because he
“Sherlock.”
The relief is searing, like hot, hot milk, and it makes his eyes sting.
“See how we have some lists stuck on the fridge with these small round magnets?”, he explains pointing the shopping list and John’s appointment and shift timetable that are fixed on the fridge with blue magnets. “We can put your drawing there, too”
She gives him a stern look for his sourness, and hurries to place the cup back where it was.
“-me”
“Was nice while it lasted”, Sherlock can’t help but agree. Not that he minds bathing Honeybee again, but he knows she will not appreciate the repeat.
‘No.’
‘Monster’
He grunted in empty space. A palm up his face, sliding. ‘Useless.’ He didn’t know what else to do or say to make it clear that this wasn’t redemption, this wasn’t- he wasn’t so pathetic. He had a basic moral code. ‘Damn it.’
If there was a reason he never wanted children… This would be it.
“There’s always a catch”, Sherlock murmurs, so feebly John is not sure he’s meant to have heard it. He denies any truth in the phrase anyway -he can’t face the magnitude of it, its true depth, not now- shaking his head vigorously.
Sherlock may have imagined it, but there is something of a warning in her tone, too, and is suddenly too well-aware that he should be expecting a visit of reconnaissance from her within the next couple of days.
” She brushes Rosie’s hair back behind her ear. “But maybe it’s time to let go, dear”
It is now 5.57. There is a shot of pain up his ribcage. He needs to stop. His steps begin to drag until he stands behind the door again, like a weary soldier resuming duty.
“Really?”, John chortles, throwing his head back. “Let me guess. Is it this?”, he rubs a hand over his salt and pepper stubble-turned-beard.
She nods no; a sharp motion of her head, that makes her curls bounce. Her head buries more on his chest, her cheek flattened against his sternum, as if she were trying to hide.
John couldn’t resist. His friend looked like an eager high schooler.
Mrs Hudson tries to console a Rosie that tries to clutch onto her like a monkey with a demanding whine. “Oh dear, you all seem-”. John shakes his head. “More off today”, she finishes. Somehow, she manages to splay a palm over her chest and sigh with a roll of her eyes, like a tutting mother when her own children are upsetting her.
And now John is here, presumably to stay, at least for a while. The thought of John living in 221B again is peculiar. So familiar, at first -two mugs of morning tea in the sink, a good morning and goodnight, someone to share the empty space with, the small sounds that indicated someone was there with him; a running tap, the telly, the clicks on another laptop keyboard. Maybe the odd smile.
‘Still okay? You still want to? Can I be yours already?’ John is having a hard time shutting his head up.
“It’s... I’ve-” he winces, twists his fingers further.
“Sherlock?”
She pushes it away, lips firmly closed before he can even finish his sentence. He leaves it on the table, straightening his spine with his shoulder aching, trying to restrain himself. He brushes a palm over his eyes, groaning as she wails.
Sherlock blinks, then shakes his head no. He is on the fifth bite now, and the four previous ones are already curdled like acid mothballs in his stomach.
“Wrl cn wath ake aff tday e ou ont.”
“Don’t have to what?” John has stopped mid-motion, both plates in his hands.
Another sob; a punch.
wrong”, he breathes, his face mushed against Sherlock’s t-shirt. He smells of cinnamon. He feels like home. John’s eyes screw shut, and he nuzzles closer. “Please…” There is so much he would ask for, beg for…
I do not believe I am that man. I don’t know if I’ll ever manage to be. But I have gone over those days, what I did, what I felt, many times. I know what I was doing and what I didn’t want to do. I know what matters now. The DVD that I kept talking about, my supposed grief that drove me to… well, they don’t matter. I was trying to prove I wasn’t that man, a good man, while not doing anything to change it. I don’t want to do that again. What matters now is that I am ready… I’m ready to ask for what needs to be asked. To do what needs to be done. Honestly. Truly understanding and meaning it.”
“I’m glad, but-”
There’s so much more hidden in that word. He can’t not say it back now. He wants to find out. He wants to give back.
He screams.
“Sorry”
“I don’t want you to be alone” It is bittersweet and caring at the same time. “These people they… They are your friends, your family. I wish they’d at least call”
‘Oh.’
“John?”
“Because... Sherlock, this is
“O-kay, let’s get you something to eat, shall we?”
John makes a small choking sound at the back of his throat. Sherlock closes his eyes.
“Mm… Tell me about that, then.”
“Sherlock, darling… She’s a little hot, don’t you think, dear?”
John turns around, arms outstretched in an attempt to soothe sore muscles. His shoulder pops and he can’t keep back a surprised sigh at the small shot of pain through his old, aching wounds.
drinking again, and this can't have left his job unaffected. Leaving Rosie with a nanny often must have strained his income severely, too. Sharing a flat is more affordable. Even so, the sudden appearance at the time when he was scheduled to only visit (to keep Sherlock
“Okay. Can you do me a favour, see if we have ibuprofen syrup?”
“Because all this… situation has been… Horrible”, she closes her eyes, as if the thought alone upsets her.
“Am I not even allowed to talk to you, now?”, she sneers in a deceivingly sweet voice at John, who gives her his most fake, tight-lipped smile.
…But it
Sherlock’s fingers, now resting at his thighs are starting to shake. John blinks and makes to reach again, like they both had done once, keeping their trembling hands together. Sherlock buries them in his dressing gown with unimaginable speed, looking pale, eyes flickering from John’s hands to his face, then all around the room, blinking as if trying to block out the light, as if adjusting his focus, as if everything is too much to handle right now.
‘I trust him.’
The light that had filled his body when he woke up ebbs away, taking the weightlessness of his transport with it.
-when she’s not kicking at his ribs, for example. John gets his phone out, fingers pressing at the screen with insistence. Sherlock shoots him a glance.
they seemed to be unable to coexist. They were caught in an intricate, dangerous dance around each other. Sherlock would pretend, John would avoid. But when they would collide, it would be violently, to shouting, a broken nose, and cracked ribs.
Not anymore. Not this time...
“Well, I… I thought… Since you have decided to… You know… Live together again, and are working on things together, that you…”
John turns the taps off. It’s ready. He stands and his arms loiter at his sides for a moment before he’s looking up into Sherlock’s iridescent diamond eyes.
“You had everything planned and I-… I was angry. I was angry that you had relapsed, that I had left you alone and wasn’t there when you-” A breath. “I wasn’t sure why-” Was he the reason? The DVD said so but… he wasn’t sure. He couldn’t trust it. He could only trust Sherlock, whenever he was ready to share. But not now. Now he has to finish this.
Forgotten auras. Moments of pleasant companionship. Of constant working of the genius’ mind. Of John’s admiring exclamations and of walls filled with pins, newspapers and photographs. Of ciphers and locked room murders. Of excitement and danger. Stake-outs and lie-ins.
