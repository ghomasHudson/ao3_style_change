The walk to the castle was short, ten minutes at most, but the quick surveillance of the gate revealed a dire situation. There were easily 60 guards present, and the wedding was to start in half an hour. They had no choice, they had to give the Man in Black the pill now. Sam heaved him off his shoulder and propped him against the outermost wall of the castle ground. He opened the mouth and Kevin took the pill out of his pocket, biting off the end of it to help get the contents pumping through the Man in Black a little quicker. He tasted a tang of herbs and oils as the tip slid past his throat. Oops. At least it probably couldn't do much to someone who was already alive-alive. He shoved the rest of it in the man's mouth, working his throat to get him to swallow it.
It was beginning to feel false on his tongue, asserting that statement.
They’d gotten the laptop up and running, plugged in and signed into their wifi, when John called them for dinner. John had actually set the table with some semblance of an effort—ceramic plates instead of paper, the pans on hot pads in the middle, serving spoon in the mac and cheese, a fork for the burgers.
Kevin stood at the edge, looking at the man about fifteen feet below. He looked to Abaddon, who lifted an eyebrow in expectation. He sighed and took out his sword. “Sorry about this,” he mumbled before making a clean slice through the rope.
His vision of Kevin’s orange floral skirt was temporarily cut off as the lights dimmed and came back up.
Dean twitched, wanting to run after Sam, and Castiel, being the awesome selkie he was, seemed to know that.
Dean started chuckling and Castiel looked at him like he was nuts.
“Mmm,” Castiel moaned. “That is nice, but I thought you were going to get inside me.”
Maybe it was time to start rectifying certain wrongs.
And as much as Dean hated to ruin what could have been a great evening, they needed to begin preparing for departure at first dawn.
Dean and Cas sprang apart, Dean running twitchy fingers through his hair.
Castiel moaned into the kiss, opened his mouth, and let Dean take control. His traitorous hands lost their poise and found themselves tangled deep in Dean’s hair.
Castiel was clearly no less effected, breathing heavily as Dean nipped at his thumb, completely unaware that his burger was dripping grease onto the table.
The man patted the railing in invitation and Dean had no inclination to decline.
One side of Castiel’s lips quirked up into a leer. “I don’t know if I can promise you that.” He backed Dean into the bed, pushing him onto it. Dean landed with a bounce. “You may be sore for days.”
“I don’t think God had much to do with it,” Dean wheezed.
They finished the walk back to the car quickly, not having had much further to go when Castiel had diverted them. Castiel bumped into him casually several times, sending him meaningful stares.
“Dean!” Bobby yelled from across the stage. “If you’re going to sit by the lines, make yourself useful, and fly this bar up. It’ll need another 25-pound weight.”
When Castiel scanned over the remaining male faces in the room, he realized he really should have looked closer at the casting list. Then maybe he wouldn’t feel quite so much like an idiot.
Once Dean got the fly open, he undid the button on Castiel’s boxers, and slid his hand inside the slit of fabric.
“I wasn't finished,” Castiel growled. “The next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right.”
Dean cursed. “This isn’t going to go away, is it,” he said flatly.
Did that mean something?
“See you there,” Dean said, thumping Sam on the shoulder. Sam nodded.
“I am not!” she cried, offended. “You defeated Sam, so you're very strong and may rely on that to save you, but you also defeated Kevin, so you must have studied, and will understand mortality and therefore put the iocane in front of me.”
“Fuck, sorry,” Dean said, running a hand through his hair.
He pulled Castiel’s cock out of his open fly, waited until Cas’s eyes were locked with his, and slid the head onto his extended tongue. Cas moaned like a pornstar, his hands going straight to Dean’s hair.
“Deeeean!” they heard Ash cry. “Dude, why didn’t you tell me you and Cas were coming together? Wait, why did you arrive separately?”
Yeah, Dean could have really done with never seeing them again.
Dean had spent months trying to get over Castiel, and though the sting had lessened, there was an ache that had not. He’d never managed to get over Castiel completely.  It had been three years and he still missed Castiel’s warmth, his soft blue eyes, and the crinkle of his nose when he laughed.
Terror fled quickly when Castiel swirled his tongue across the head of Dean’s dick as he hollowed his cheeks and sucked deeply. Dean was hard within seconds, deep throated in the next, and coming within minutes.
“Dean!” Sam admonished.
“Easy for you to say,” Castiel quipped.
“I felt like such an idiot doing that,” Sam bemoaned, walking through the gate. “Don't make me do that again.”
“Hell yes I do,” Castiel replied.
The room was nice, deep reds and decorative, carved wood accessories and furniture. The bed was plush and huge. It was a little like Castiel’s cabin, only with more touches and attention to detail.
So he has a cat. No big deal, the cat is not here, and Dean would likely never meet him back on land.
Charlie’s mouth was hanging open. In fact, so was Kevin’s, and even Sam had turned around and was now giving him a thoughtful, pitying look.
Assuming it was okay to find seals-turned-human sexy at all.
But regardless what Crowley said or did, Castiel was a fucking pirate, and that tipped the odds heavily in his favor. His Cas was pretty kick ass.
“I’m sorry,” Dean said, breaking the tension. “I was a dick.”
Dean's lips turned up slowly. “I need you to make me a promise, Cas.”
Dean was much more interested in having Castiel’s tongue in his mouth than seeing ruins, but emptied the bus when instructed. As their tour guide, a portly Mexican named Antonio, led them through ancient Mayan grounds, he explained the history of the Mayan culture. Eventually, Dean had to admit that it wasn’t as boring as he thought it would be. Ball games where the
“Shit,” Anna breathed, running a hand through her hair. Castiel had no idea what she was cursing about. She didn’t seem inclined to explain. “Well then, you wouldn’t want to disappoint Dean Winchester, would you?”
Dean huffed in her grip.
“Wove, twue wove, wiw fowwow you fowevah-”
The cruise ship bobbled in the water and Dean stood with their bags, staring at it like its mere existence was offensive.
“Damn,” Dean said, throwing the shovel down. “It’s never that simple, is it? Why can’t we just once get an easy case?” He moved to the edge of their significant hole and looked up to Sam. He chucked the shovel up and over the edge and tugged on the rope they’d tossed down earlier to help with getting in and out of their massive crater. “Good?”
The thing about
But that wasn't what made his heart skip a beat.
Dean awoke to the horrible sound of a blood curdling scream.
“Where the hell are we?” Dean asked as they slowed their pace and picked their way over the slimy ground.
“I—“ Dean began, and then froze. Warning bells were going off in his head.
“Angels,” Dean whispered. “Shit.”
She looked at them like no one would ever believe that, and so did everyone else.
He was due his damn beer.
“Ready to get pushed overboard?”
“I don’t know if I can find something formal in my duffle.”
“You're welcome,” he said, stopping in front of them and panting. “And the cloak.” He whirled it out of the wheelbarrow with a flourish.
Or something.
“So where do you think he’d keep it?” Sam asked, pushing open a closet door.
“Of course, my favorite was always Rocky Horror, but Tim Curry is captivating, isn’t he? Horribly problematic of course, but captivating.”
“Well, in any case, we have the right spot now,” Dean finally said. He handed Cas the crowbar and shotgun. “You know how to shoot?” Castiel nodded. “Good. Anything pop up while we’re digging, you shoot it.”
“Ah,” Castiel said, carefully neutral. So she was one of the girls Dean talked about all the time. He’d never had a class with her. But she was pretty. He hoped they’d be very pretty happily heterosexually together.
“Brewery sounds awesome,” Dean said, taking the turn Castiel indicated. “I think we deserve it.”
“I would like to meet this Castiel,” the Duke declared.
“It's important to you, isn't it.”
“You're such an ass,” Sam mumbled. A shaky hand came up and flopped through Sam's long hair. “Hi.” Sam said with a touch of amusement.
“This is Duke Metatron. He would like to ask you about how you tend to the horses.”
He stumbled out into the night, and somehow made it home, where he did indeed cry for four nights and then some. Then he shook himself off and decided to make something of himself for once. He’d taken to the sword too much to change, so he bought Sam a bow for his birthday, using the last of his money, and taught him how to shoot. They left dad passed out in a puddle of his own vomit and never looked back.
“Mmm,” Dean hummed in agreement. “So Nathan Lane and Robin Williams. I bet this will be hilarious.”
Cas palmed the back of his neck, quickly glancing away.
“Yeah,” Dean replied, “Just a little. We, um. We have some family that came from Gatlinburg and we were just hoping to look them up.”
Castiel stared at her, unsure what to say. Unsure what she was trying to tell him.
God he loved that chest. The little freckle above the right nipple, the curve of chiseled pectorals. Before Castiel could finish pushing Dean’s dress shirt off his shoulders, he shoved Castiel back onto the bed and climbed on top to lick up every angle, every mark he could find.
Castiel breaks off abruptly, and Dean is pleased that he’s breathing as roughly as himself.
Dean clicked on the TV and was not overly impressed to see it carried a total of five channels. But one of them was showing The Fifth Element, so he couldn’t complain too much. Dean drew the curtain shut, the late afternoon light causing some glare, and got himself into movie viewing position on the bed. He planned on spending the couple of hours trying to decide if he was more attracted to Bruce Willis or Milla Jovovich. It was something he’d never let himself contemplate before and it was freeing to get to do it now.
He fists himself and comes so hard he sees white.
“Because I know something you don't,” Kevin responded, a little cheek to his tone.
“No,” Castiel whined again. He flattened his hand to Dean’s chest and closed his eyes. He looked a bit like an angel trying to take a dump. Now Dean hoped
“They won’t fit,” he protested weakly.
“Dean!”
“What the hell were those things?” the barkeep bellowed. “Did you two just save us all?”
“Well. Yeah,” Castiel said. “That was kind of the point. I wanted to show… certain people that it’s okay to put yourself out there.”
Cas sighed. “There will be no nudity.”
friends, I suppose we could manage that.”
Dean palmed his cock as he took in the sight. Flat, defined stomach, sharp hip bones, and biceps strong enough to kill.
“So uh, yeah. This is my room. Make yourself at home, I’m going to get us some Pepsi. That okay?”
There was some cheering and Castiel thought that sounded like an end, but no one made to leave.
“I don’t have condoms,” Castiel said. He said it like someone had just kicked his favorite puppy.
Castiel laughed at him so thoroughly that Dean blushed. “I’m sorry Dean, it’s just, what do you think seals eat? Mostly fish. That’s why I prefer sushi, it comes raw.”
Then Dean’s hand was finding Castiel’s and weaving their fingers together. He gave them a squeeze. “I already am.” A shiver went down his spine when he realized that Cas had actually blushed. This… this was a very dangerous game they were playing.
“Good. I expect you to pick me up at 7:30.” Cas winked, and whisked himself off to his bedroom, leaving Dean staring at the door.
“Angel?” Castiel said, sitting down on the bed at the other end. “I mean, I don’t have a lot in common with him either, but I admired his freedom, his complete lack of concern about what others thought. He just… was who he was. Even if sometimes that meant he presented as a girl.”
Castiel smiled sardonically. “Yes, well, I’m not sure any of my fellow cast members are equally as glad. I’m not very good at this.”
“That’s better,” Dean said, losing his voice as he sucked in a breath. Castiel had slid down the zipper and gripped his erection through his boxers.
Dean awoke some amount of time later to fingers caressing his damp backside. He tried to rise up but discovered he was glued to the warm, welcoming body beneath him.
"Well?" Castiel asks, demanding a response.
“Why?” he asked.
“God, don’t ever be sorry for that. Are you okay?”
Down the wall hung a painting. It was fantastical, a swirling white and blue sky, a field of lava and darkness below, and between the two was a figure with wings, though it was obvious the figure was in pain, his wings were shedding feathers and his skin was bubbling.  Dean reached a hand out, wanting to touch this vision that somehow spoke to him.
“Please…”
“I saved
“Smiths, right. And they are craftsmen too, or…?” Dean asked, leaving the question hanging. Sam moved to the next display case.
Sam finished his coffee and signaled for a refill. Once the waitress was out of earshot, he replied, “That would require going fed and I’d rather exhaust other options first. I think we should check out the crime scenes next.”
the Brute Squad. What could you possibly need from us?”
Azazel sneered. “I think it’s time for you to die.”
“Nonsense!” Dean exclaimed. He placed a hand on Castiel waist, to the other in his own, and sashayed Castiel around the room like a pair of drunken baboons.
He licked his lips and attempted to regroup before answering. “I protect people,” he said, figuring the lie was close enough to the truth and sounded a whole heck of a lot better than their usual response of pest control.
“You’re going to have to wait for me to recover before we can get to that. You might as well—”
It was from Gabe.
was his favorite part of that day.
Lights were flickering as if in a power surge, but it was only happening to the Ogle household. Sam and Dean were already bolting from the car, grabbing the shotgun rifle and crowbar, when a rugged old man appeared in the living room.
“You were supposed to ask how low!” Castiel shouted to them. “But nearly six feet in the ground is probably far enough.”
When the sun was getting low, Castiel told Dean to keep riding North, he was going to hunt some game for dinner. Dean hated riding the fucking beast of doom by himself, but he was able to handle the momentary panic by humming his favorite tune to himself and consistently repeating in his head that dinner was on the way.
home.
“Cas,” Dean called out, looking back, “Don't forget what I said about not forgetting again.”
“Dean!” Castiel shouts, to interrupt him. He continues more calmly, “Dean, you can’t be my secretary. But I’ll have Hester take you on.”
“Hey,” Dean said, taking the hand from his mouth. “Let’s get outside.”
“Five.”
“I could, um, help?” Dean said, cringing at himself. Did he really just say that.
“Oh, we can't have that. Good thing there are much better songs,” Castiel said as he climbed out of bed and made for the bathroom. Singing, he added, “And I am
And it couldn't wait. Not now that he knew.
“Dean,” Castiel said in a low voice. “I do believe we should run.”
Stupid frickin nerds.
“I wonder if Charlie is free.” She was as gay as the day was long, but she was also the most loyal friend he could ever hope for. She would save him if he asked. He picked up his phone and began twirling it between his fingers.
Fortunately, the next block was lunch for their class, so if he could catch Dean, they wouldn’t be rushed.
“Patience, my pet,” Crowley responded. Dean bristled before he stormed off. Crowley knew he didn't like the pet names, but he insisted on using them anyway. Not only for appearance's sake, but partly because Dean was cute when he was riled up.
“Hey,” Castiel mumbled in protest.
Dean looked equally as shocked when he spotted Cas on the other side of the room, his eyes roaming all over his body. It was the first time Castiel felt truly revealed in his outfit.
Dean reluctantly moved the shirt to the side. It was no longer gushing blood, but it definitely was not a clean wound, all red and puffy, bits of skin flayed and ragged. “Now we could use that wine,” Dean commented.
Cas snapped on what Dean had come to think as his dom face and stared down at Gabriel. If he had a thought bubble, it would read, “Come at me bro.” Gabriel sunk further into the chair.
No, he wasn't. Not even a little. He was doing great. Dean's chip pile was about as big as when he first sat down, but Castiel had clearly gained. As they stepped away from the table, Castiel collecting his stack of chips, Dean did a double take.
“Circle,” he said to them and nodded to the side down the hallway before disappearing in the direction he’d nodded.
Sam stared in shock. “I can’t believe you just did that.”
A slow grin spread across Castiel's face. “What if I said I had a better idea?”
“Sorry, ma’am.”
By the time they'd finished their food and had two beers apiece, they were giddy with a slight alcohol buzz and a huge anticipation high. When Castiel started licking the salt from his fries off every single one of his perfect digits that Dean couldn't stop imagining elsewhere, he squeaked at their waitress for a check.
“Yours?” Dean asked, taking the tumbler of whiskey Castiel handed to him.
“We may need that coin,” Castiel said lightly, like he didn’t like saying it. “Hopefully we won’t, and then we can return it to them on the way home.”
He could almost hear Charlie shrug. “You’re at sea, I could resist.”
When they passed the place they had stolen Nebula from, Castiel wrote a quick note that said, “thanks for the horse,” and placed enough coin to pay for two horses on top of the note on their doorstep. He shrugged at Dean and said he just couldn’t leave her.
They were kissing and clothing was going everywhere. Two jackets straight to the ground, a tie fell over a chair, shoes were chucked, thumping against whatever furniture they happened to hit. Dean had Castiel down to pants only in no time flat.
Whatever Dean had been expecting, that wasn’t it.
“Ahh-hh!” Castiel cried with a hitch. “Fuck.”
“Cas?” Dean said, turning to the voice. Castiel lay, like he'd been there this whole time, propped up on the bed. “Castiel!” Dean scrambled out of the window frame, strode across the room, and jumped on top of his lover. Straddling him, Dean kissed him like he was never going to get to do it again. With the way their relationship had been going, that was entirely too possible.
They took turns, one manning the flashlight while the other dug. Digging up 6 feet of earth was no picnic and took a lot of time and backbreaking labor, so it helped to switch off when it was too dark to dig together. It was supposed to be split fifty-fifty, but Dean took a little extra of the burden off of Sam and tried to hide the fact that he was doing so by bitching that it was the other way around. He was pretty sure Sam saw through it, but that’s just how they worked.
Rabbit, when Castiel cooked it, was delicious. Dean had a weird suspicion that Cas would be good with a stove too, and he had to shake away the image of him and Castiel and a house, and pastries baking in the oven.
“What did you buy those for?” he asked. Castiel was holding two long swords, both with scabbards attached.  “
“Or a dominant bottom.” His finger roamed further, trailing across Castiel's navel. “A submissive bottom.” He slid his hand sideways, dying to run his finger tips over the curve of Castiel's hip bones, before following the line they cut down past the waist band of his underwear. Dean took Castiel's solid length tightly in hand, squeezing just on this side of rough, eliciting a gasp from Cas. “Or a dominant top.”
‘Seemed’ and ‘start’ being the operative words.  Once they got past some of the speaking parts, Dean shocked Castiel by singing Joanne’s lines. And either his sight reading was incredibly good, or he’d heard the number a couple, or dozens, of times.
“Shit,” Dean cursed low. He grabbed Castiel’s hand and yanked him out of the room, up the stairs, and into the bedroom they’d talked in earlier.
“Missed you, too,” Castiel whispered back, rocking his hips into Dean. “So much.”
The waitress cleared her throat and Dean jumped. He hadn’t realized the waitstaff had begun service. The woman was holding a pitcher of water. Dean gestured grumpily at their water glasses and she filled them. When she was gone, he raised a questioning eyebrow to Castiel.
Anna, of course, had wanted to know how it went. He’d mumbled a, “Good,” and then locked himself in his bedroom, flopping face first on his bed and fully planning on never moving again.
“Or any woman,” Dean added.
Dean was blushing again. Blushing and butterflies, he was going to have to drown that shit in motor oil. He threw back the rest of the beer in one gulp. It was a start.
He didn't wink, but his mouth twitched with mischief. Dean watched him leave with a lopsided smile. As he had implied, and Castiel no doubt understood, he was very much hoping Castiel would be that distraction. A glance at the swell of his behind as he walked away, just managing to avoid walking straight into the Wall of Sam coming at him, only firmed up that desire.
“Yes, well,” Castiel said, “Don't get too full.” This time, he actually added a wink.
Next, assess the damage. No other pain registering, slight discomfort at his wrists. Bound. Naturally. A tiny bounce of his hands told him he wasn’t bound
When Castiel whimpered, Dean realized he had been loosely touching Castiel’s dick for like a full minute, not moving and not kissing.
Together, the three of them found Sam exactly where they had expected him. He wasn’t overly interested in partying and thought they went out too much as it was, so Sam was at their home, his nose buried in a book. This one was one of Sam’s favorites, a book of fairytales from around the land. It included the Tales of Red Brunsberry, Three Owls in a Barn, The Grace Archer, The Emerald Pumpkin Snatcher, and more. He put it down when the trio entered.
“Truth.”
“So we eating here?” Dean asked, motioning to the door.
Sam raised an eyebrow, opened his mouth to speak several times before shaking his head. “I don’t know whether to tease you, yell at you, or congratulate you on finding someone as geeky as you are.” Dean didn’t know whether to take the statement as a compliment or insult.
Dean ordered a tall draught of the Velas Helles lager. Sam ordered a water, as did Castiel. The waiter was back with their drinks before they could get a conversation started, and they ordered dinner. Dean went for a burger, which Castiel assured him would be delicious, and Sam ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with broccoli on the side. Dean rolled his eyes and looked to Cas as the waiter moved on to him.
Dean watched Castiel storm out the door and, the second his friend (ex-friend?) was gone, all strength left his body and he fell to the floor.
It was such an awkward thing to say that Dean laughed. Sam shot him a look and Dean just shrugged. “Well, trust me Sam, he’s doing a pretty good job.”
“I swear to God, if you’re going to remind me he’s straight—“
Dean put the hammer away and turned around to see that Castiel had shrunken into himself defensively, looking to the side instead of meeting Dean’s eye. He’d hurt his feelings. He wasn’t sure how, but he had.
Dean playfully shoved at Castiel’s shoulder. “Did you just ask me to Netflix and chill?”
Castiel slid the salad to the edge of the table for the server to grab and asked, “Here with family then? Where’d he go?”
“To jump in.”
Becky nodded. She'd met Charlie Bradbury before.
Kevin wasn’t quite as skilled, and the tall brunette woman spun to duck his dagger. Dean didn’t see what happened from there, hoping Charlie and Sam and Cas would have Kevin’s back.
“Mmmmph.” Dean didn’t even attempt to move his head out of the pillow. He could feel drool coating the down pillow beneath his cheek and still could not muster enough energy to move.
“I'm taking my time,” Dean explained. “I'm making up for so many years without you. I want-” he kissed Castiel's left hipbone, “-to make this something worth remembering for a lifetime.”
She bit her lip and wrapped her fingers on the glass of the top of the display case. “A little. I fell out with his mom a few years ago,” she said. The woman huffed a piece of hair out of her face, stood up straighter, and put on a false smile. “So where are you both from, anyway? How did you meet?”
“You could go back with him,” Castiel suggested, his voice thin and distant.
“Dean?” Charlie asked, calling his attention back to the phone at his ear. “Dean, are you still there?”
The entire front room stopped and stared at him. The only sound was Thriller playing from a stereo in the corner.
“Get your breath first,” Kevin said amicably. “It would not be right for me to kill you while you are winded and weak.”
“S’okay,” Dean told her. “Get some sleep, I’ll continue in the morning. We should reach his camp by the end of the day.”
Castiel blinked several times. “I see I wasn’t the only one hiding things last night.”
“Castiel Milton, you’re up!”
“What. What the fuck did I miss? Do I need to count the angles on the star of the wand? Or is one of the brooms an inch shorter? Or--”
“Get a tent,” Charlie said, faux-mocking.
“Am I to die here?”
Two filled glasses of wine were soon sat upon the makeshift table, and the Man in Black took them both and turned his back to Abaddon. When he turned back around, he sat one glass in front of his foe and one in front of himself. Abaddon raised an eyebrow.
Castiel heard gasps come from all around them, and from the corner of his eye, Jo was pumping the air furiously. Silently, but furiously.
“For what? A bonfire? Ritual sacrifice?”
“Several hundred years ago, King Phillip and his wife Caroline both had blonde hair and green eyes. All of their offspring did too. When they were overthrown, the usurper had all of their children and heirs hunt down and killed,” Castiel explained. His voice was carefully neutral.
Kevin slashed again, marking the other cheek to match his mate. “Power, too! Promise me that!”
“Dean, I love you, but sometimes you are really, really dense,” Sam said. He slid into the arms of the beautiful woman and kicked the door shut behind him.
“What?” Sam repeated more forcefully.
Castiel nodded in response and pushed in just a bit more.
Like jump in a giant pile of multi-colored, bone-dry leaves.
“Dean, I kept something from you.”
That was irritating. “It better damn well be okay, since you wouldn’t let me pull away last night,” Dean told him.
Dean took the third watch. He always did. Charlie was good at staying up late, Kevin was most alert with a few hours of sleep first, then liked crashing for the rest of the night, and Sam was absolutely incapable of being up before he’d gotten nearly a full night’s sleep. So Dean took the shift no one wanted, the one that meant the most interrupted sleep.
“Next weekend,” Dean restated. “I promise.”
Castiel nodded his understanding, though he was still a little short on the understanding part.
Dean watched as Castiel pinched a piece of sushi between the two sticks and brought it to Dean's mouth.
Sam didn’t seem to care. He was holding a much shorter man with sandy hair and clothes that didn’t fit well against the wall by his throat.
Bouncing on his leg a few times, Dean smiled wide, relieved to know that he wouldn’t be a gimp for the rest of his life. “Hey, I know you don’t like going to town, I could probably go the rest of the way on my own.”
“The stable boy,” John supplied, giving Dean a warning look.
Castiel paused with the drink halfway to his mouth before responding.
damn it.
“Not possible.”
Dean opened his mouth to make a remark about really needing that shower now, but changed his mind when he saw the look on Castiel’s face. Too many emotions moved beneath the skin for it to be comfortable, and his gaze was still stuck on Omiel.
He squeezed before pulling his hand away to work at Dean’s jeans. Dean wiggled with him, helping Castiel pull the denim down his legs. They were stopped by Dean’s boots, and Dean almost injured another foot with how fast Castiel pulled the things off, socks and all.
“You were gussying up for me, weren't you?”
Castiel opened his mouth to respond, but Dean cut him off.
“Dean,” she said plainly, like she was stating the obvious.
“You could have just called out,” Castiel said, grumpily rubbing his eyes. He seemed unconcerned about his nudity, so Dean rolled his eyes and covered him up too.
Dean sighed. “Fine.”
“I, uh,” Kevin muttered. He dug in his pockets while Sam did the same. Together, they were able to scramble up a pile of change. “This?” Kevin asked more than declared, handing it out for her.
Castiel slid off of him and sunk to his knees before Dean, looking up at him through his stupidly dark and long eyelashes. His heart skipped a beat in his chest as Castiel reached for his fly.
“You don’t think that means…”
Dean’s mouth moved like a fish’s, trying and failing to find an answer before he grumpily turned back to his laptop. “Just finish your damn cereal.”
He laughs and laughs until tears are falling from his eyes. Dean frowns. He has no idea how this could be funny.
“His name is Marv, room 404.”
The slick man pulled the caravan up short when he saw Dean in the field. He whispered a word to the man to his left and smoothly dismounted his horse.
Cas grunted between slurps of Captain Crunch.
“We saved a room for you,” she said with a wink. “Room 2. One bed.” As she turned away to wipe down the bar, she added, “I had a hunch.”
Castiel smiled. A full smile with a little bit of nose crinkling and a little bit of gums. It made Dean smile back automatically.
“Dean,” Castiel said, placing a hand on Dean’s arm. “I want to come with you, believe me. Being by your side is the first thing that’s truly made sense to me since I showed up on Earth without a memory. But I have to find out what’s happening with Heaven and what my role is, and you can’t come where I need to go.”
“Yes,” Castiel agreed, “It was.”
Dean pulled his jeans back up and stepped out. He held the boxers up for everyone to see before dropping them to the floor. The room cheered. He paused at Castiel’s feet and met his friend’s eyes. Castiel was blushing profusely and his gaze skittered away quickly.
“Holy mother—” Castiel’s fingers tightened on his head and Dean’s hand wrapped around the back of Cas’s thighs, urging him to thrust forward.
Castiel froze and took a deep breath before cursing under his breath. “I was worried something like that might happen,” he said. For some reason, it only pissed Dean off.
“What do you keep hidden under your bed?” Dean asked with an evil smirk. He had no idea what Chuck hid under his bed, but he was willing to bet the squirrely little guy wasn’t as innocent as he looked.
“You love humanity,” Dean said bluntly, emphasizing the word love.
“We should do this again,” Dean finally says. Castiel laughs.
“Dean,” Castiel said, tugging on his hand, reminding him that they were holding hands
“That’s exactly what I’m saying.”
“Crowley, Crowley, Crowley!” Charlie screamed, chasing Dorothy around the room. Kevin wisely pressed into the corner with Sam, and then watched with amusement.
But he was already friends with Jo and Charlie, and Kevin and Victor were pretty cool too, so maybe it was okay?
“No,” Castiel agreed. “But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t a kill. The guards could have already discovered a body. Maybe we should check with them.”
Dean assured him it would be fine and went to turn some lights on on the stage, instead of just the house lights. Castiel dropped off his bag and his jacket in the wings, then stretched his arms a few times.
He turned his head to the side, letting Dean’s cock smear across his cheek, to give Dean the warning.
Cas opened the door and Dean knew he was so royally fucked. Cas was wearing blue slacks that fit him like they’d been tailor made for him, and though he couldn’t see his ass, Dean was positive it would be spectacular. The vest and tie were a matching shade of blue, off-set by his white dress shirt, and the color was just perfect to make the depth of his eyes shine. He could even make out the well-defined muscles of Cas’s arms in the cling of the fabric, highlighting just how much the guy spent working out.
Dean swallowed and nodded his agreement.
She looked at a clipboard in her hands and scanned down the list. She checked him off with a sharp movement of her pen.
Castiel nodded. “Of course everyone’s tastes are different, but I never understood anyone that would come to a place as beautiful as this and want to spend all of their time inside.”
He leveraged himself off the floor carefully, just in case he wasn’t fully healed, and placed a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. He waited until Castiel looked at him before he nodded to the door. Castiel’s head bobbed once in agreement and Dean steered him out the door.
To his credit, he did say it like it was the last thing he wanted to say, like he didn’t want to disappoint Cas.
“Still think you can?”
Dean had to swallow around the sudden lump in his throat. He picked careful footing over a fallen log, trying to buy himself a moment. Castiel was becoming a familiar presence at his side, but they hadn’t known each other that long.
He still didn’t look settled. Not even a little. His eyes were wide with fear and his breathing was sharper.
“The people will love him?”
“That idiot Bella is insisting that it’s 3. That it doesn’t count if the parrots are only being carried, but the wording on the question clearly states--”
Dean stood and pushed his chair carefully back in place. “I think I should go.”
“That’s what you get for teasing me when your feet are within reach,” Cas replied, cocky smirk still plastered on his face.
Cas lead the way out and Dean paused to take a deep breath.
Dean ran a hand through his short strands. “You’re making me feel like an ass.”
And he didn’t say no later either, when Castiel asked Dean to fuck the holy hell out of him. He did laugh though, just a bit.
Well yes, he is. And if this were any different situation, if the guy weren’t drugged out of his mind, Dean might play back. But the guy is drugged, and they met for like 30 seconds before this, so he should be stopping him and walking away.  But he doesn’t.
Not much information was gathered that night. Dean didn’t want to pester the town’s people with questions when it was obvious the person they were looking for had been here, and, he was confident enough, had already moved on. But they did learn that the townsfolk believed they were killed by wild animals. No one would be seeking a crazy murdering sorcerer in Wind Driven.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. The fingers in his hair were slowly reuniting the stalled flame from moments before. He took Castiel’s slim wrist in hand and kissed it while looking up to stare into Castiel’s eyes. “Let’s do this,” he said steadily.
“No, I don't think so,” the man responded. “I would as soon destroy a stained-glass window as an artist like yourself.”
“You seem so much more comfortable with everything lately,” Jo finished for her girlfriend. “More outgoing and open to us. More confident. More happy.”
“To the pain means the first thing you will lose will be your feet below the ankles. Then your hands at the wrists, next your nose,” Castiel threatened, his voice low and gruff, like molten lava over rock.
They kissed, deep but not frantically, for a few moments, and soon Castiel’s hips were doing little gyrations in the air. He could lower himself and give him something to grind against, but then Cas would be coming in his pants, and that didn’t seem like a lot of fun.
“But there are many things I can’t give you–”
“Care to introduce yourself, Mr. Mysterious who is Too-Good-for-Choir?”
Cas let out a sound that was nothing short of a growl, and suddenly their kiss was ten times more sinful. One hand was in his hair while the other snaked down to Dean’s butt and squeezed. Dean had to fling out a hand and brace himself against the wall as Cas grinded into him, a building erection making itself known.
“Fine! Maybe I am. I have one goal in my life and that is to find my family. I'm not dying before that happens, so unless you think this is some crazy fairy tale and my brother is magically Dean, or—”
Castiel sighed. “No. I’d hoped that the hair I’d found that first time had come from my coat. Stuck to my shirt maybe. Or that I was wrong and it was a cat hair. But as you found more...whomever it is, they are carrying their sealskin with them.”
“At singing? Yes. Remembering lines? Paying attention instead of freaking out, not so much.”
“Heh,” Dean began, inclined to agree. Then he remembered the first thing Castiel had said. “Wait, what do you mean by mostly dead?”
“Uh-“ Dean says, feeling his face redden.
Sure enough, a high pitched sound that could only be described as a shriek pierced the air.
Castiel said it in jest, but the way Dean’s smile wavered made him wonder if he’d put more venom into it than he meant.
Especially with the way his orgasm was creeping up. He’d discovered long ago that delayed gratification was one way to make an orgasm more intense, but Dean didn’t normally have the patience for it. Today, as he slowly slid his fist down his length and back to the tip, feeling the orgasm from the day before bubbling below the surface, he was reminded of the appeal.
“I believe, now that sunlight is breaking and people are starting their day, that someone discovered the body,” Castiel said calmly.
Castiel shoved off Dean so sharply that he lost breath for a different reason.
Dean chuckled. “I’ll keep that in mind.” He stroked his hand down Castiel’s back, enjoying the way Cas seemed to melt into him. “You know, this is going to get really awkward if things go south between us. You’re not supposed to date your roommate.”
The entire group had started laughing about the time Sam had said ‘Rocky Horror,’ while Castiel and Dean both blushed.
Dean blushed. “Yeah,” he confessed. “I remembered you saying you liked him best, and I wanted to show you that I could, you know, take a risk or whatever. Put myself out there.”
“You’re incredible.” Cas pulled back, Dean sucked in a new breath of air, and Cas rocked back in, his cock pushing into the constriction of Dean’s throat. “You feel incredible.” He did it again. “Why haven’t we been doing this for months?”
Sam stepped forward. “I was taken away from my family when I was really young, but Castiel swears we're family,” Sam explained. “We can talk later, but for now, this should do.” He pulled his collar to the side, revealing the exact same sunburst shaped birthmark that graced Dean's right pectoral.
As Dean watched, he was going to go with talented. Castiel worked like a well-oiled machine, his jaw clenched in concentration, but otherwise showing no strain in his efforts. Earlier, in the forest, Dean had not watched Castiel fire the bow. He didn’t even see where the arrow had come from. Now, in the dark, and with nothing else to do but wait for something to get to him, Dean studied him closer and noticed something strange. Blue lines ran up and down Castiel’s muscles, following the path of his veins and glowing with an unearthly light. It was faint, perhaps unnoticeable in full light, but the glow was definitely there.
Dean snorted. “Yeah, that would terrify me, too.”
Dean and Cas ran wildly down the street, jumping carts and dodging pedestrians, and the guardsmen kept pace. They were nearing the end of the Droplet Falls on the North end and the forest became visible once more as they turned a corner. Castiel took control then, and quickly navigated them back to the forest, and from there, they were finally able to outmaneuver and lose the simple small town guards.
Well. For the first time in 9 years, he was going to put those lessons to the test in front of a real audience.
This was happening, Dean thought. He was making out with a gorgeous man that he'd met on a cruise of all places. And for one very brief moment, he wasn't worried about hunting monsters, or Dad's legacy, or that he wasn't worth anything this nice. For one moment he was drowning in lips that tasted like sin while blunt fingernails on slim, long fingers scratched lightly at the back of his skull.
When he goes to the hospital straight from the fire to check on Andy, who had twisted his ankle in the battle against blaze, it’s purely curiosity that leads Dean to checking if Castiel Novak had been taken to the same hospital. And it’s purely because he’s a nice guy that he decides to go see if he’s okay. It’s totally not because he was hot, even in those 2 seconds before the dude passed out Dean could tell that. It’s not because he wants to hit on the guy.
something, which was a small comfort.
Dean that the world would not end.
His entire body felt like it had absorbed the sun’s heat. He was burning and his heart was beating at a thousand miles a minute. Castiel tasted, it seemed quite literally, like heaven. A slim digit and paint covered hand was sliding up Dean’s thigh, and as it moved higher, so did a growing feeling of apprehension. Too new,
Dean shrugged. “Hey, we’ll probably find some grieving mothers or husbands willing to pay for some vengeance,” he said. They looked less dubious, but not sold. “Look, you’ll just have to trust me on this. We need to leave first thing tomorrow.”
, and damn did Dean want more.
“I know you exist, Jo,” Dean said with a smirk. “You left a scar on my leg to remind me of it for the rest of my life.”
Sam sighed and sat down on Dean’s bed. Dean really wished he’d leave the freaking room already so he could scream into his pillow a few more times, but apparently that was not going to happen.
Dean glanced to his script and back up. “I don’t know, will that work?”
Dean toed the body of the long haired brunette. They all seemed thoroughly dead, which was a relief. It would make their cover harder if all the bodies had the same final stab wound.
Of course, because life is just that fair, none of these comforts could really be enjoyed. Crowley and a group of his goons stood before them.
“He didn’t think you were real,” Dean said with a smile. “I told him everything, he still didn’t believe me until Norbert landed on my shoulder, and you appeared holding your bow.”
Once again, Sam proved to be the biggest cockblocker in history.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I thought you were some sex god sent to ravish me.” He pecked another kiss. “This is better,” he explained, pulling another kiss. Castiel was beginning to relax again. “So much better.” And another. “Fuck me, Cas,” he repeated from earlier. He wrapped his hand around Castiel’s fading erection and pulled on it until he was hard again and thrusting back.
It was strange. The uncertainty was still there, but somehow nearly being killed and saved again by his angel (well that didn’t take long) had made everything else seem less
“You promised me you'd never say his name again!” Dorothy cried.
They started with simple swings, easily batted away. But even the most seemingly useless moves can reveal a great deal. The man had good form, as good as Kevin's. He had adopted Bonetti's defense, suitable for the rocky terrain, so he knew what he was doing. But Kevin had experience, had been practicing non-stop since he was a boy, and when one puts that much heart into what they do, there is no way to fail. He was the best in the land, capable of being challenged by only a few.
“Come for me, Dean. Come on my cock. I know how good you must feel, that glide over your prostate, so sensitive right now, so eager to burst.” Cas’s voice was deep and gravely, like the vocal personification of sex.
“It’s weird, okay?” Dean said. “I don’t sleep with monsters.”
The formal dinner was less crowded than dinner had been on the first night, so he was able to snag a table to himself and glare at anyone who dared to think they could sit with him.
It was another Saturday practice and the cast and crew on site had decided to break for lunch around 1:00. Dean, not being as vital to rehearsal, had offered to take orders and make a food run to Wendy’s.
After breakfast, Castiel offered to take Dean on a tour of the ship. Though Dean couldn’t have cared less about the structure of the cruise liner, he did care a great deal about all the making out they did in various nooks and crannies of the ship. Dean was about to pull Cas into the nearest free room when he pointed out that it was lunch time.
“Who are you?” Dean demanded, his voice full of bravado, trying vainly to mask his terror.
“Oh,” Castiel breathed out suddenly. “No—
“What do you say we skip the dancing and—”
Castiel let himself get deeper and deeper until he was in as deep as he could go. Dean’s eyes and nose were in Castiel’s scrotum. It was a particularly odd view, especially being upside down, but fortunately Cas didn’t smell and wasn’t overly hairy.
“My place.”
“Magic? You think that could work?”
Eventually Dean’s attention focused on the movie at hand. It was hard not to, with Daniel Craig’s badassery flaunting itself on a huge screen. Bond—any Bond—was always huge masturbation material for him. Looking over at Cas, Dean’s assessment stood. At least in terms of looks and suaveness, he easily could have been cast as Bond.
“I'll be fine,” Castiel said after a few minutes. Dean didn't move. “Dean, the pain is... I'm fine. Check the bleeding.”
They had to shuffle a little to get Castiel’s head back on the bed, and neither gave two shits that they were at an absurd angle to the mattress, Castiel’s face near where his feet used to be.
The next Monday, Charlie had three fruit baskets on her desk.
Castiel’s fork stilled halfway to his mouth. He set it down carefully. “Dean,” was all he said, but the tone was regretful and Dean’s stomach clenched.
“Disembarkation,” Castiel supplied, which helped Dean not at all. He must have made a face because Castiel laughed fondly. “Just meet me at the main dining hall and we’ll go from there.”
Castiel glanced to Dean, who said nothing. Inside, he was screaming,
The corner of Castiel’s lips titled up. “When it comes to you, you can assume any offer related to sex is not just me being polite.”
“Jerk.”
“How do you know this wasn’t just picked up by someone?” Dean asked.
“How long do you think it will take?” Kevin asked.
A branch whapped him in the forehead. As blood began to trickle down, he decided he would only pickpocket people he’d thoroughly vetted first.
“DEAN!” Sam hollered, “Move, you idiot! The salt and gasoline are in the bag!”
Castiel sighed. “Nothing has to change, you know.”
For when his lips met Castiel’s, the whole world suddenly made sense. Every little bit of it. From looks and touches and fleeting emotions, to the reality that shaped around them. He’d been drawn to Castiel without realizing it. For years they had been like magnets that someone was holding apart, and once he stopped holding, they crashed together, complete and whole and desperate to never be apart again.
Castiel shrugged, but Dean continued to stare at him like he was insane. “Fine, the Caesar salad should do. Thank you, Bert,” Castiel said to their waiter.
He had to get home, tell Anna. She’d be as amazed as he was.
“You liked it,” Castiel added with a shrug.
“Well don’t tell Dean that. He thinks he’s successfully cloaked himself in his own lies,” Castiel said. Dean turned and met his eye across the stage, looking sharply away. “The only person he’s fooling is himself.”
“Dean?” Sam asked, pushing the door open. “What are you doing home? I thought you’d be out until two.” Something must have shown on Dean’s face cause Sam’s next words were, “Oh, Dean, what did you do now?”
She shrugged and was gone.
He crashed into Castiel, pressing their lips together and holding him close. Dean loved Castiel, and Castiel loved him. It was almost too good to be true.
These people had fucking Mussolini moustaches and no one found that weird.
There was a knock at his door and a meek, “Dean?”
“I haven’t bathed in hot water in hundreds of years,” Castiel stated. Dean blinked several times.
Dean hummed, letting his nose dip down to caress Castiel’s. “And what’s that?”
Castiel’s eyes involuntarily roamed all over Dean’s body, and once again, he had to remind himself that this was a very bad costume to get aroused in. Especially since he and Dean were on speaking terms again. He didn’t know if they were on
Clothes were disappearing in a blur of open mouthed kisses, and somehow, they were making it toward the bedroom. By the time Dean was bouncing onto his mattress, he was down to boxers and jeans, both of which had gotten tangled around his knees. Castiel's own pants were merely unbuttoned.
“Where have you been hiding that body,” Dean said, not really asking.
A young man came upon them while they were fighting. Dean didn’t get a good look, as he was fighting, but he was pretty sure the kid was from a foreign sea, with dark hair and dark eyes. Castiel shouted at him to go, and he fled.
“I’m going to add another,” Castiel warned him. Dean nodded, felt the pressure and then the slide. He tried not to tense again, and mostly succeeded. He was panting though, and when Castiel slid over that spot he’d only heard of in tales from the rowdiest taverns, he arched with a gasp.
Hey. That wasn’t a bad idea.
“You were bluffing!” Crowley exclaimed. “I knew it!”
“Just-” he started through his panting, “don't break skin. And nowhere a shirt can't cover.”
He sighed and started the car.
The Man in Black did not have to travel far to catch up with the kidnapper. If he had to guess, the woman had given up on making it any suitable distance with the resisting and forceful captive. She sat primly on a log, her legs crossed delicately under a long, red skirt. Dean sat by her side and a makeshift table was set in front of her with a bottle of wine and two goblets. Next to the log was a bundle with further supplies that he assumed she had hid earlier.
Sam echoed his shock with a, “No way.”
Dean summoned everything he had to wrap a hand around Castiel’s wrist and stop him.
“Omiel,” Gregors said with great pride.
But Dean did not jump at it. He continued to stare and evaluate. Dean knew that saying no to a prince was a poor idea, especially this one. He had heard of Crowley, of course he had, and the man had a reputation for being cunning and ruthless. Dean had no interest in marrying him, but he did have an interest in the power the position would bring him. Perhaps he would finally have the means to hunt down the Dread Pirate Roberts and exact revenge for his beloved.
Dorothy looked less than impressed. “No.”
The same part of him that took a certain, sick glee in feeling a vamp’s neck rip in two, or the sense of pleasure in burying Ruby’s knife deep into the gut of some demon.
“What kind of weapon?” Dean asked. Castiel didn’t answer. He looked at Dean like something was killing him inside, but he didn’t answer.
“Please,” Castiel begged, doing a similar sand removal dance, “don't walk into any more lightning sand traps.”
“Don't you ever let me believe you're dead one second longer than you have to.” Dean whispered when he pulled back, keeping his fear and his pain as privately between them as possible. Only Impala and the trees back home knew what he went through.
“No,” Dean replied automatically. Because of course he was afraid of things, but explaining hell hounds to a business exec wasn’t going to get them anywhere.
They walked away, the conversation slipping from Castiel’s ears.
She cleared off the table in the middle of the hut and Sam laid the Man in Black across it. Dorothy rubbed her hands together before examining the man. She poked him, prodded him, lifted his arm and watched it fall. She moved a hand down his chest and back up. Finally, she nodded.
When they awoke in the morning, Dean’s sixth sense for coin pulled his eye to a bag of money on the dresser. There was a small note placed next to it. He slide out of bed and opened it.
Why was that so fucking hot?
The waiter delivered their food and Dean reached for his fork. Castiel covered his hand with his own. He picked up a pair of chopsticks and said, “Let me.”
Metatron croaked, his hands in the air, begging defense. “Anything and everything you want.”
Oddly enough, her conclusion and Sam’s were the same. They wanted Cas to give Dean time, that if he could give Dean space and let him sort himself out, he was worth the wait. That no one would ever take care of Cas so selflessly if Dean could get past this.
It kicked off some more dance tunes that had them all bumping along, hip checking each other, grabbing hands and doing swings and dips for the heck of it. Somehow Castiel found himself dancing more with Dean than anyone else, and he certainly wasn’t complaining about that.
With the exception of the first attack on Dean, they’d only encountered beasts when someone had been killed by them nearby.
God help him, he does want this. He has wanted it for some long, certainly never thought he’d get it. Cas has been nothing but a gentle and kind lover. He’d never even broached the topic of dirty talk and getting smacked around a little because he couldn’t see Cas as capable of it.
Castiel hummed quietly behind him. “I doubt we would have learned much, probably better to just get to him quicker.”
“Let me,” Castiel said in his deep, gravely voice, pressing his lips to the soft skin just above the line of Dean’s jeans, “take care of you.”
“Inconceivable!” Abaddon exclaimed, not hearing, or perhaps not caring, about Sam's words.
“And you, if you’re in Kansas.”
“At present I'm writing the definitive novel on the subject. So I want you to be as honest with me as possible about how The Machine makes you feel. This being your first time, we'll start with the lowest setting.”
It was a vague answer, which Sam seemed to take in stride. That was… actually a pretty smart move on Cas’s part. Most people would have flubbed a real answer, because liars tended to think they needed specifics when they really needed exactly the opposite.
“I’m glad I don’t have to hide around you, Dean,” Castiel said with sincerity as the laughter died down. He had to wipe a tear away from his eye, he’d been laughing so hard.
“Thanks, dude,” Dean said, clapping Sam on the shoulder. “Go have fun, get back to your book or whatever. I’ll let you know when I hear back from Charlie.”
“Pulled me from the fire?”
“Shame your throat will be all healed up soon. That gravel is damn sexy.”
Play continued, Dean casually keeping an eye on the game, and a not-so-casual eye on Castiel. His right hand continued to riffle chips, the action highlighting the length and delicate structure of his fingers. Fingers Dean hoped to become more acquainted with shortly.
Castiel couldn’t see Dean’s smile, but Dean was confident he sensed it nonetheless as he squeezed the arm around his waist. “Me too,” Dean said. “And not just cause you saved my life and soul from scary, scaly demon beasts.”
Dean turned and gave him a flat look. “Really? And you never thought that was relevant before?”
Dean hummed in response, scanning the room for Paul. His soon to be father-in-law was by the patio door, making small talk. He didn’t see Kristin at all.
Okay, maybe not.
Dean paused and licked his lips. It was absolutely mesmerizing, damn that tongue. Dean did that a lot when he was thinking. Then he replied simply, “Of course not, Cas. You’re not that kind of guy, and I’m not that type of girl.”
Castiel blew out a puff of air. It was going to be obvious anyway, right? “I have horrible, penetrating stage fright.”
“Wait,” Dean said, sitting up. “Wait,” he repeated. “Can I?” he started to ask as he slid to his knees before Castiel and took his cock loosely in hand. He swallowed hard. “Can I taste you too?”
“Hey,” Sam said, sitting forward, “Stop that. I don’t mean because he’s a guy. Well. I do, in a way. The difference is, one, those other times weren’t in a tight nit community where everyone knows everyone and anyone could be a suspect, and two, you could have taken out any of the others without breaking a sweat. That guy could have handed your ass to you.”
Dean chuckled. “Look.”
The apartment was different in only subtle ways. The carpet was worn, but not worn through, and the small kitchen nook obviously hadn’t had a new appliance in 20 years.  The living space wasn’t huge, but it was open and the far wall was a bay of glass with a sliding glass door to a balcony that faced due west. The orange glow filtered in and Castiel didn’t even bother turning a light on.
Sam released his hold on Gabriel’s neck and shoved him towards the stateroom. Once inside the room, Sam pushed Gabriel into a chair in the corner of the living area. No one else sat, though there was a couch and another chair, had they wanted to.
Dean slid out a lock picking set and they were inside in less than a minute.  It would have felt more rewarding if the inside had been bigger or more impressive. It was a one bedroom, two room cabin. The floors were wood, the walls were wood, the bed was of a wooden frame. Only the couch seemed to be remotely comfortable, and given the worn state of it, even that was questionable. The cottage was sparsely decorated, no plants, thin curtains, and only two paintings, both, unsurprisingly, of the mountains.
“I didn’t mean it like— Of course you’re not a monster, Cas.”
“No,” he said flatly. Cas tilted his head to the side, inviting him to share more but not pushing. “No, Cas. You’re nothing like Mark. Can we leave it at that?”
“Pick up that hammer boy, I didn’t give it to you to drool over.”
Dean sighed. “Should I go?” he asked.
“I thought he was immortal,” Dean said in the dramatic pause.
Castiel let Dean’s pelvis back down to the bed gently, but didn’t move any further for a long moment, panting into Dean’s knee. Finally, he gave it a kiss. Then he pressed his lips to Dean’s thigh, and then higher, as he worked his way up Dean’s body until he reached Dean’s hip bones, where he licked with long stripes.
“You're incredible,” the Man in Black said calmly.
“My apologies Mr. Peters,” he said. “I have your painting back here.”
“You. Me.” His hand slid to Dean’s front and grasped his cock through his slacks. “A lot of this.” He pressed his hips forward, moving his hand to Dean’s hip so his own length could press into Dean’s. “And this.”
Dean got what that meant about the same second Castiel did, if his wide eyes were anything to go by. They were so screwed.
They were tasty, but Dean found all of the flavored ones far too sweet for his tastes in liquor. All except for one. The apple pie flavored one, made of green apples instead of red and with a hint of caramel, was amazing. He groaned when he tried it.  Ava smirked knowingly at him. Either she was really good at her job, or she was angling for a four-way that was never going to happen. Sam was his brother, and he kind of wanted Cas all for himself. So shoot him.
“Oh fuck,” he murmured once he had regained his breath.
Dean checked, but he knew Cas was right. With more strength than the situation called for, he threw his phone at the couch, a mere ten feet away. Because he was mad, not stupid.
It was that laugh.
It took Dean a moment. “Oh. Ew,” Dean said with no real discontent. He laughed into Castiel's neck. “We're in a cave, in the fireswamps, naked, with no food, and our biggest current problem is that we're sealed together by come.”
He was stopped by Sam, who had rested a hand on his arm. His brown eyes were wide and wild, but he managed to say, steadily, “Perhaps we should make camp.”
Sam and Kevin’s faces were still twisted up with uncomfortableness.
He was tempted to touch himself. He was so aroused that he couldn’t think straight and all it would take was a few pumps and he’d be gone. But he also knew that if we waited, if he came from nothing but Cas pounding into him, it would be so incredible that nothing else would ever compare. And luckily, some part of his brain still knew that and kept his hand glued to Cas’s wrist. Barely.
Castiel turned, dizzy, uncertain, ready to head to a bathroom to throw up. Or pass out. Or die.
It was absurd that his darling mother would not let him attack Guilder without provocation. They had gold and land and resources, and owning Guilder came with power that Crowley desperately craved. The people of Guilder were not particularly strong or smart, it would be easy to take them.
to start the apocalypse?!”
Cas took in a deep breath when it clicked. “Hands free? You can do that?”
“Sit down,” Pamela said. Her voice was stern, but almost sounded bored. “You’re a part of this family now, kiddo, we’re all going to get you through this. Because you deserve this part.” She looked over the other people in the room, and several of them nodded in agreement.
“I’ll be fine,” Dean mumbled at him.
“I have to agree,” Kevin said on his other side. “That was a horrible way to end a story.”
Dean blinked several times, trying to find the words to describe even a fraction of the thoughts in his head. “You’ve been in hiding for years.”
“I suppose we go get your throne,” Castiel said into his beer, “And you will rule the kingdom. You will have a table of knights and a queen by your side.” He chugged back more of the beer.
“More pool?” Castiel suggested, wiggling his cue stick.
Then they were in the narrow stairwell and Castiel’s perfect ass was right there and Dean decided it was almost as good.
“That’s ridiculous, it’s freezing. We can share,” Dean said. Castiel hesitated before nodding his agreement and sliding in beside Dean. He was stiff, and they were close, but not touching. “Sleep well, Cas.”
“YOU started it!” Castiel accused with a laugh. Dean blushed. “And I knew every word,” Castiel added as a peace offering.
Okay, so they were definitely friends, and Dean was just being grumpy because he wished it were more.
Dean was standing firm by his assessment that the guy was hot. And now that he’s not choking on smoke, passing out, wearing a hospital gown, or drugged out of his mind, he was even hotter. Even from the back of the room Dean could tell the guy’s blue eyes were alive and sparkling. And though Dean didn’t have a clue what he was talking about, it didn’t matter. That deep, gravelly voice could read the phone book for all Dean cared. It’s a shame it will probably pass when the smoke damage is gone.
The gravel crunched as Dean pulled his Baby off the road and into the tiny parking area. He pulled the latch for the trunk and he and Sam made for the supplies, filling up an old beat up backpack with as much of the smaller supplies as possible. He heard more than saw Cas freeze when his eyes fell on the contents of the trunk.
When Dean got back to his room, there was a suit laid out on his bed. He pulled at the collar and, sure enough, it was monogrammed with CJM. Castiel J-something Milton. He had no idea how Cas had gotten it in his room, but he’d guess that he’d tipped room service well.
The inside was a similar quality. Wooden beams, big windows. It was both airy and warm, incredibly welcoming. They had the impression the place could be very helpful. If only they knew what they needed.
There was an awkward pause which Charlie chose to fill with an even more awkward question.
He got out of bed and went straight to Crowley's office. It was early morning, he would be up. Dean didn't even knock and wait to be invited in. He invited himself.
He took his hand off the wall, intending to reach for his cock, but of course Castiel noticed.
Dean’s eyes fly open, and he realizes Castiel is kneeling naked between his knees and reaching for Dean’s boxers. Once Cas has them pulled off and shucked across the room, he looks down at Dean and smirks.
Eventually he added a third finger, unhurriedly thrusting into Dean, not rushing, but not without passion. Castiel’s own chest was heaving now and his face was flushed. Dean could feel Castiel’s cock on his thigh, leaking pre-come.
"Yeah, well," Dean grumbles. "Some people aren’t as capable at vocalizing utter obscenities. Seriously, where did you learn to talk like that?"
“Shit!” Dean cried. He tried to stand but his knee painfully reminded him why that was a bad idea and he fell to the ground with a cry. He scrambled across the campsite, half pulling, half using his good leg for movement, to make his way to the weapon. He heard a few more arrows fly before he reached the knife, sitting on a makeshift work table next to the tent. He grabbed it and turned back towards the action, but with his busted knee, it was more of a defense weapon than something he could help with.
“No,” he said, his voice shaking.
Dean blinked several times at the abrupt change in conversation.
“Yeah.”
And that... that was hot as fuck.
Castiel had somehow walked them backwards to the couch and pushed Dean onto it. He planted knees on either side of Dean, straddling his lap. Dean looked up as if in a daze of lust. Castiel’s eyes were blown wide, probably matching his own. He looked like he couldn’t believe this was happening. That meant two of them.
“I...” Dean started. “Like, James Bond? The spy?” When Castiel tilted his head in confusion, Dean added, “Seriously, you had to have at least heard of Skyfall! It was one of the best Bond movies of all time.”
“Dean, are you sure about this?” he asks. “I won’t force you to-“
“Sam.”
“Dean!” a voice called out across the parking lot. It was Castiel. He jogged over. “Hey,” he said with a big grin. Then his eyes glanced over to Sam and his grin turned softer. “Sam, right?”
“You’re awesome, Charlie,” Dean said fondly.
Castiel -the date had a strange name- was CIA, like Charlie, though they worked in completely different departments. Cas was more like James Bond, Charlie was more like Felicia Day, a computer nut on their favorite TV show. And as much as Dean thought Charlie's job was badass, Castiel being an agent just fueled every wet dream he'd ever had.
The fangs retracted and the claws released his arm, so Dean did it again, hitting hard. On the third hit, it fell to the ground.
Sam’s face turned thoughtful. “I think he would have told us if he knew something,” Sam said.
Castiel whimpered in his sleep, wrapped a hand around Dean’s wrist, and forcefully pulled him back into a snuggling position. Dean tried to withdraw, sensing that the awkward would set in any second now, but Castiel refused to let go. He was an insistent snuggler.
“Your entire armada,” Dean repeated flatly.
Castiel grinned. “I’m sure they’re all good stories.”
Later, when Dean could think properly, he'd find that funny. But right now there wasn't much higher brain function happening, not now that Castiel was totally with the program, giving as hard as Dean was taking, pressing back and grinding into Castiel's fingers. Castiel's other hand snuck underneath his body and gripped his dick. Dean was so horny, he could barely stand it.
“Shhh,” Castiel whispered mockingly. “Your next door neighbor might hear.”
“We could take him to Dorothy,” Sam supplied after a moment, voice hopeful.
And of course it did, because dancing meant touching. And grinding. And sharing breath. And getting so freaking turned on he couldn’t see straight. That’s what happened last time.
“Ow, what the hell?” Dean asked.
“Um. Sorry.”
Dean smirked. “Good?”
“Twelve.”
He just barely remembered to send Sam a text that he would see him in the morning before falling asleep in a lump of blankets and limbs on Castiel’s country couch.
“No, nothing like that,” Castiel said, interrupting and shaking his head. “It’s just awful. I can feel this dark presence hanging over the town and there’s nothing I can do about it.” He stared at the table for a moment before looking up and continuing. “I hope the murders won’t dampen your stay. It’s really quite beautiful here.”
“So I’ve been told,” Dean responded.
,” Dean said.
So imagine my shock when, years later, I picked up Goldman's book and discovered that the entire thing was deeply heteronormative and a little sexist. Had the movie been that way as well? Likely, I was simply too young and raised in a too problematic society to see it.
Dean met his eye and broke out into a grin. Castiel paused. Then stumbled as he was nudged from the side.
“Fine!” Metatron answered.
“I’ll come with you.”
“I’m not,” Jo said.
“He’s incredibly frustrating,” Castiel said. Well. They already knew what was what, no point in pretending he didn’t know what Kevin was humming over.
He should not have driven home. Dear god, what was he thinking? He could barely hear his thoughts over the pounding of his heart and he thought operating heavy machinery at unnatural speeds was a good idea?
“Whoa,” Dean said, and suddenly his hands were on Castiel’s shoulders again. Jesus, if he didn’t stop that, Castiel’s heart was going to pound through his ribcage. “I can’t let you do that. You had the most amazing audition I’ve ever seen. Cas,” Dean said. Paused. “It is Cas, right? Castiel Milton?” His thumb caressed Castiel’s shoulder in some sort of subconscious gesture of consideration. It made his pulse flutter. Dean was handsy and he certainly wasn’t going to complain. “You would be doing the entire school—hell, thespians everywhere—a disservice by turning down this role. I don’t think you understand how incredible your audition was.”
“That should never have happened to you,” he said. “Were I not about to be killed, I would help you find this man.”
At least Castiel’s arms around his waist felt incredible.
Dean chuckled, though his smile was tainted with the pain. “Good to know.”
Dean climbed in, looked at Castiel and grinned. “You’ve sweated through those clothes. Care to join me?”
Dean let out a hmm as he thought, and found himself leaning backwards subconsciously. He failed to notice Castiel’s breath hitch behind him.
“I believe it’s none of your business,” the bigger man sneered.
Dean whined.
“You're quick,” he commented.
Catherine frowned. “Just solve it,” she said.
“Because human sex is amazing,” Castiel volunteered with a shrug. It drew an awkward light to the fact that he was half naked.
While there was more cheering, Castiel couldn’t help but think that the actual person he owed this to was standing on the other side of the room, not talking to him. Which sucked. But hey, eye contact. That was something of progress.
“What do you remember?” Dean finally asked as Castiel began to pace the room.
Dean was, however, still staring at the recently deceased. Because Dean was a beautiful man, many incorrectly assumed he lacked intelligence. And he didn't try too hard to change that impression. The misconception had served him well. But he was, indeed, both smart and intuitive.
to much.
“I could not remove his mark, but I could, at least, replace it,” Castiel said. “Every last bit of me went into that,” he added gently. “I’m human now.”
Castiel looked from him to the spot and his eyes went wide. “We better get you some water.”
Castiel pulled his phone out of his pocket. “It’s almost eleven. I can’t start another one, and Anna’s going to start to… Well, not exactly worry, but I’ll get an earful if I don’t get home soon.”
Dean groaned into his pillow. “Your tongue should be illegal.”
Sam sighed. He carried the dead weight out of the bar and headed for the small cabin he'd called home before Abaddon recruited him. The Brute Squad attempted to stop him, but even with the metaphorical sack of flour he tossed over his shoulder, he managed to deck two of the louts who tried to get in his way.
“Kill your brother?”
Castiel told Anna about practice while they ate, and she asked Dean some polite questions about the set. It wasn’t the easiest conversation, but it wasn’t exactly awkward either.
“I just mean, he’s been helpful so far. He might know something,” Sam explained. “He might know something he doesn’t know he knows.”
Droplet Falls, Dean found out, would have been significantly closer than wherever Castiel was taking them. Dean sincerely hoped he wasn’t wrong to trust him. He was not entirely certain he could find his way back out of the forest without help. They had gone so far, there was now mist seeping into the woods, and it was getting thicker.
“You’re wasting my roaming charges to tell me you don’t have anything?”
Yeah, but did Dean dare to hope for that? Or was this going to be one more bang to the chest? Another reminder that the perfect person for him was already out there, and he can’t have him?
Any doubt about who he was vanished when Dean’s eyes saw the big furry thing wrapped around his waist.
“Cas?” Dean asked.
“Indeed,” Castiel said. Dean opened his mouth twice, but he couldn’t think of anything else to say to that. Maybe Castiel hadn’t had a lot of conversations recently.
Cas pressed in slowly, and Dean could feel when the full head of Cas’s cock had breached him. It really had been awhile and Cas felt
Castiel stared at the signup sheet and the rest of the world disappeared.
“You told me you went into hiding because you failed,” Dean said.
“Sometimes I forget you’re not really human,” Dean said. His heart was doing a weird skitter pattern in his chest. He was falling for Castiel, and it was less than wise. They were of two different worlds. Could they ever truly have something?
“I am going faster.”
He shook his head, trying to knock sense into it, but sense was not his friend today.
“What, now?” Dean asked.
“Dean,” Crowley said with mild surprise. He rose from his seat. “You don't mind...?” Crowley said to his companion. From the side of the room, Metatron motioned with his six fingered hand for Crowley to continue.
When the movie was over, Dean grabbed Castiel’s hand and yanked him roughly in the direction of Castiel’s room. Castiel followed quickly, and the second they were inside, he shoved Dean against the door and proceeded to attempt to suck all the oxygen from Dean’s lungs.
He was hoping maybe Cas hadn’t felt the same way about the silence, that it had only been uncomfortable for Dean, but that hope was dashed after he parked the car.
Sam swiped at him again, but the Man in Black dodged the blow, kicked off a nearby rock, spun and landed on Sam's back. Sam grunted loudly.
“Are you teasing me?” the man asked. “I've seen your strength. This isn't a fair match.”
“You think...?” Sam started to ask.
bees, wasn’t it?”
“So,” Castiel said, when they were done. “To the nightclub?”
Dean didn’t even look up from the book he was reading, his head on Castiel’s thigh. Cas hadn’t protested when he’d shifted into that position, and the leg was much more comfortable than the threadbare pillows his mom had lent them for their first apartment.
Dean recognized her bored, condescending tone. That was Meg Masters. She hadn’t been at their school long, but he’d already figured out that she was completely evil. Ambitious and out for herself, and Dean had no idea how she made the cast, let alone got one of the leads.
“Did she know you’d be going to his grave?” Castiel countered. Dean said nothing. “Mmmm,” Castiel said, his point made. They both knew it and Dean refused to admit it.
Dean had little else to do but glare at her, so he did.
Dean nodded into Cas’s neck as fingertips trailed gently down his back. “Rarely, but yeah. If I’ve been on edge for a while, and the top can last long enough.”
