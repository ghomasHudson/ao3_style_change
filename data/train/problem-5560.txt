It’s just him and Tony in the living room, and every other minute, Steve will hear the brunet mumbling along as
He’s managed to put the incident in the back of his mind by noon, but damn it, he should’ve known better.
“My hero,” Tony mutters, but then Steve’s softens, and when he pulls him to his side, arm settled comfortably around Tony’s shoulders, both of them are almost smiling.
Tony resists the urge to chuckle again, choosing instead to give Steve an encouraging smile. “Give it to me, peaches.”
Tony doesn’t even try to hold back the proud smile, beaming as his daughter’s wide-eyed gaze travels all over Pepper’s face. “Are you surprised, with genes like those?” he jerks his head at Steve, who rolls his eyes even as he blushes.
“I do,” Steve nods, blue eyes steely with determination. He looks every inch the Captain, even bed-ridden and in a hospital gown. “I love you, I–”
“Jesus,” Tony groans, arching his back like a cat, and it brings their chests even closer together. “You’re a menace.”
“Iron Woman, Uncle Agent! Get with the program!” She laughs, and then turns to Steve. “Guess my ride’s here! I’ve got it from here, Papa!”
Tony grins, looking up at Steve from underneath his lashes. “You telling me Captain America can’t keep it in his pants for a couple more seconds?”
By now, Steve’s moved right beside Tony, shoulders brushing each other, and the smile on his face is pure, unadulterated charm. “No, better yet... Make it a hundred.”
Tony says nothing, and except for the small, minuscule brush of his fingers on Steve’s chest, he doesn’t move a muscle. Steve just holds him, trying to soothe the rapid beating of his heart.
A huff of laughter leaves Tony’s lips before he knows it, leaving him more breathless than he already is.
(He knows Howard rarely goes into his room, and never to snoop through his things, so it’s a safe enough place for now.)
"Surprise!" Bruce says, and Tony finally opens his eyes again, sending him a small but genuine smile.
,” Tony growls, and then Steve’s smirk is the last thing he registers before he’s dragged into warm arms and kissed within an inch of his life.
my home. I wanna marry you because I want you to never doubt that I’ve got you. For as long as I’m breathing, I’ve got you, baby.” He’s almost breathless by the time he’s done, but when he opens the little black box and holds it up to the love of his life, his hands are no longer shaking.
All he gets in return is a quirk of the tiny Bichon Frise’s head before it takes a step closer to the edge of the roof.
His friend–Bucky?– bows his head as he starts giggling again, and Tony sees Blondie’s cheek flush the most beautiful shade of pink. He takes a deep, steadying breath, and turns back to him.
“Oh, you’re a Red all the way through, huh? But, y’know, I assumed that when I said that you should start talking, we’d both understand that I meant English. So try again.“
“Steeb!” Barnes whines, and Tony can’t see him, but he can hear him tapping on Steve’s jacket incessantly. “
No one is more surprised than Tony when the cat-- Jarvis, he’d named him, that first night after Pepper had left-- makes it to a week, and then a month.
— but he's also the sweetest man Tony's ever met, a great teacher, and such a little shit that Tony’s left trying to catch his breath half the time. Steve's all that and so much more and Tony wants to know everything about him and--
“Boring, without you. Pep’s keeping me sane, but everybody knows I’m just here to wave and look pretty.”
Steve looks up at him from beneath those gorgeous eyelashes. “I really do appreciate it,” he says shyly.
“The ice,” Tony replies, suddenly more quiet and serious than he’d been since they got here. “I know you-- you said it was fine, but, y’know. You would say that just to make ‘em happy.”
Steve doesn’t startle at the smooth, playful voice of his patient, but when he looks up from the chart in his hand, he almost stumbles from the big brown eyes aimed his way. “Mr. Stark,” he says, clearing his throat to regain his composure. “How are you feeling?”
“VIbranium, yeah,” is the last Steve says before he cups the back of Tony’s neck and brings their lips together in a slow, tender kiss. It’s a little salty from his tears, and there’s still a faint trace of chocolate from the cake they’d eaten hours before, but it makes Tony’s toes curl in his socks nonetheless.
“Is he... will he be okay?” he asks the SHIELD doctor in front of them, unable to keep the tremor out of his voice, and catches Tony’s smile turn to a frown out of the corner of his eye.
“Aw, does it rankle your delicate, nonagenarian sensibilities?” Tony teases, but when Steve looks back at him, his lips are quirked up into Tony’s favorite smile.
“Right,” Tony scoffs, but doesn’t break the comfortable silence that settles around them for the next couple of minutes. The sweet taste of the hot chocolate still lingers in his throat, and he closes his eyes against the sound of Steve’s breathing.
“Sure you are,” she laughs, and the sound-- he can’t remember the last time he heard it-- has his lips quirking up before he can help it. “You good?”
Steve just runs a hand through his hair, and Tony breathes through the pang of longing. “I can’t wait to wrap my arms around you and keep you in bed for days.”
Tony can’t hold back the scoff, though they both know he’s not truly angry. “Yeah, if you call picking out their pajamas ‘helping’.”
,” he throws open the door, and thinks he might cry when he sees Steve grinning back, phone still pressed against his ear.
“JARVIS had one of the security guards bring up the mail,” Steve says, and pulls out a folded envelope from his back pocket. Their daughter lets out a whimpering sniffle into his neck, and both he and Tony make shushing noises until she drifts back off with a sigh. “And I’d just like to know why you thought it’d be a good idea to buy our daughter a pony ranch,” he finishes with a fond quirk of his lips, waving the paper at Tony.
“Oh, stop pouting,” Tony chuckles, pushing a towel into Steve’s hands as he starts toweling his own hair into wild, wet tufts. “You’re the one always going on about boosting team morale and all that jazz.”
“Still,” Steve says, still smiling brightly when he pulls away. “It’s good to know I won’t be going up to Cambridge alone.”
“Oh, I’d definitely sneak one or two of those in there, too,” Steve laughs, wrapping his arms around Tony without hesitation.
“Long story short,” Tony replies, “racists fuckers thought it’d be a good idea to mess with my friend.”
“Why the hell are you calling him ‘sir’? And I haven’t even said yes,” Tony points out, already a little breathless at the quirk of Steve’s lips.
Tony meets Steve’s eye, and smirks. “Still on the leash, baby. Don’t see why we had to get up at the crack of dawn to walk him, though.”
Steve shakes his head. “It’s not. I wasn’t... I wasn’t in a good place back then,” he continues. “And that’s no excuse, I know it’s not. But I... I didn’t mean a word of it. I know it’s not true.”
It’s after that night that he starts taking a little bit of the money he has-- and he has so much, sometimes he thinks he hates it-- and puts it in a box under his bed.
It’s only a couple of steps to Steve’s bed, but he doesn’t let out the breath he’s holding until he gingerly climbs up beside the blond and tucks himself into his side. “Cover me?” he asks Natasha, who rolls her eyes but brings the blanket over from the other bed and settles it over them.
“How did you even–” Tony starts, then shakes his head at the unimpressed look he gets in return. “Never mind. I give up. What’d you find?”
doorstep. They’re all my doorsteps. My building, my doorsteps– and this isn’t even a doorstep, Steve-o. It’s a whole floor, so–”
“I used to dream about driving the plane into the ocean, about seeing Bucky fall, over and over again. And it’d keep me up at night, every time. But now… Now I dream about you.”
Tony blinks. “Oh,” is all he says, and catches Steve’s sleepy smile over the top of Rhodey’s onesie hood.
“Then you come talk to me. Or Barton, or Romanoff– anyone you want. You come find us and we’ll talk until you feel like Steve again. It might be crazy sometimes, because we’re fucking insane, but it’ll never be lonely. We’ve all got shitty pasts, y'know. But ‘we’re all in this together’, and all that jazz.”
“Alright,” Steve announces, rising from his seat without breaking his hold on Barnes. There’s a determined set to his jaw that Tony knows all too well, and he mentally bids goodbye to any work for the next couple of days. “Permission to return to the tower, sir?”
“You said…” Steve takes a breath and swallows the lump in his throat. “You were saying that you didn’t want to be with me anymore, that you… that you love me, but you can’t do this.”
Tony barks out a sharp, incredulous laugh. “Well you’re just full of shit today, aren’t you?” he sneers, and watches her sigh into her handcuffed hands. They’re pale and delicate, but he’s surprised to see hints of calluses and faint scars.
Tony looks up from the sight of their intertwined hands lying atop the soft, white duvet cover. The rain’s kept its steady rhythm outside the cottage, but the sky has turned considerably darker, and Tony knows it’s been hours since they’ve done anything but lie in bed and hold each other. He can’t remember the last time they had a chance to do this, and he’s determined to not let it go to waste.
“Tony--” he gasps, pulling the brunet’s hands by the wrists, breathing a little easier as Tony lifts them up the rest of the way, bringing them atop Steve’s shoulders.
"Like hell I would," Tony says, the firmness of his voice at odds with the tender, utterly gorgeous smile on his face.
“Bruce, toss me yours! Nat, you too-- oh my god, send a pic to Rhodes, I’m-- hey, where’s Cap’s and Stark’s? Barnes, check under the couch...”
“Nobody likes it when you guys fight,” Sam says softly. “And Steve’s always been easier to rile up when it comes to you.”
“But it’s aluminum. And vibranium. From my dog tags and the shield, because I’m a soldier and I’m Captain America, but baby, the only thing I ever wanna be from now on is your husband.”
“Honey, if you think I ever need a reason to be naked in your bed, we’re clearly doing something wrong.”
“Babe, I’m dyin’ here. I’ll be back in two shakes of a lamb’s tail,” Steve promises. “I’m just running down for a snack.”
He almost trips on the ten steps to Steve's door, but didn't bother knocking this time, just barges in on Steve painting by the window, right next to Tony’s sneaky little Traitor Cat.
“It’s awful,” Steve says softly, brow furrowed in that all-too familiar, ‘Captain-America-and-Steve-Rogers-disapprove-wholeheartedly’ frown, as if Tony’d been the only one about to have his night ruined. “But... I get it.”
Judging by the brief but sharp flicker of panic that passes over Tony’s face at her words, she’s almost certain she’s not the first to do so...
"Yes I did,” Steve replies, and then he sends Stark a lightning quick glance as he tugs at the collar of the uniform, cheeks growing just a little bit pinker and–
“Is this payback for making you carry all the boxes down to the garage?” he asks, voice more rough than he’d like, and smiles a shaky grin when Steve’s shoulders shake again with laughter.
“Fuck,” he sighs, then looks up for the fifth time. “Jay, status on SafeHouse seven-four-one-eight.”
But Steve just grins, and holds him tighter. “Turn that frown upside down, mister. Come mornin’, they’ll be here with all our stuff, you’ll see.”
“So ungrateful, God... Next time, I’ll leave you to the wolves,” he mutters around a mouthful of meat and cheese.
“Yeah, well it’s your fault I’m here,” Tony accuses. “The least you could do is bring me something.”
“Hmmmm,” Bella brings the kitten up until their noses are all but touching, narrowing her eyes thoughtfully. The kitten blinks back, and squirms around her tiny hands. “I like... Cat.”
He buys the pair of tickets that same night: first class, departing to London at eight in the morning on the eleventh of July.
“Hi there! Sorry, I should’ve been up at the front,” he says, but the wide, gorgeous smile on his face doesn’t look sorry at all. “Welcome to
Tony breathes in the familiar, comforting scent of Steve’s skin and clothes, and curls his pinky finger around Steve’s. “Think we’ll be here next year?”
“I like you with a little gray,” Steve reaches up to trace Tony’s temples with two fingers, his touch as soft as the gleam in his eyes is fond.
Christmas morning, surprisingly, comes with the soft, low coos from the crib next to the bed. It’s loud enough to wake them both, but not in the loud, piercing way they’d been dreading.
“Those… bedroom eyes,” Steve says, and runs a single finger down Tony’s chest, soft and slow and utterly
He doesn’t ever want to do anything except stare at the most beautiful man in the world, whose voice Tony has been hearing ever since he can remember.
Four minutes later, Steve has to hold back his excited chuckles when Tony stumbles into the kitchen.
“Relax, Stevie. As long as Parker doesn’t go on blabbing about us bribing him, no one’ll show up until it’s too late,” Bucky says, but his gaze never leaves the hallway outside.
From the corner of his eye, he spots Natasha’s red curls, and the glint of Barnes’ metal arm as he stands beside the glass windows, but everything falls away the moment he sees Steve.
“Oh, Tony...” The words are out before Pepper even really knows what she means to say, but her thoughts— her knowledge, and the realization of what she’d only considered in passing up until now— are quick to rearrange themselves to fit this new truth.
“Mhmm,” Steve hums, slowly rocking the little boy back and forth. “That’s because it’s three in the morning, and all good little boys should be in bed.”
“Pie from Marcello’s when your shift’s over?” Tony looks up at him through his eyelashes, and Steve doesn’t even pretend he’s going to put up a fight.
“All that shit’s his, you know that. Besides, I’ve got the real thing, so really,” Tony shrugs, “No contest.”
“Mr. Stark?” says someone behind them, and when Tony turns, it’s to find what’s sure to be half the precinct enjoying the show.
“Enjoy what the world has to offer, and then you bring both yourselves back in one piece, you hear me?”
Steve nods. “And I know you haven’t had lunch, so…” he picks up the basket, and opens it with a grin.
Their daughter just nods and lets out a pitiful little moan that pretty much breaks Steve’s heart. The last thing he wants to do now is leave, but he knows that the sooner he takes care of business, the sooner he can return.
,” Barnes hisses, and Tony’s brain grinds to a halt. “You’re going to shut this down,” he waves his hand around the workshop, “you’re going to change out of those grease monkey rags, wipe every bit of grime off that mug of yours, then you’re going to find my best friend and say those three words again, to his face–”
“I can’t imagine what that must’ve been like,” Steve says softly, “but I hope you never forget just how much good you did that day. More than I think you realize.”
nice,” Steve murmurs, ducking down to nip at Tony’s scruffy jaw, then his ear. “Can’t think of a better way to spend my day, having my fella all to myself.
“I’m thinkin’ you need more than a minute, handsome,” Tony replies, moving to sit beside him with a heavy breath. He takes off his gauntlets, and holds out his bare hands. “Gimme your hands?”
(It helps that Nat tells him their ratings have been climbing steadily ever since his calls with Tony started, especially during Golden Oldies hour.)
One moment, Tony’s looking down at his dissertation draft as he walks through campus-- and he just wants to get one thing straight here: he doesn’t do drafts. Ever. But Bruce and Rhodey and Pepper have been up his ass for weeks trying to get him to write and proofread, it’s like they don’t even know him, Jesus-- and the next, he hears a frantic
“Okay,” Tony nods, and then breathes out a whoosh of air when he’s pulled into that beautiful chest, thick, muscled arms surprisingly gentle as they hold him up. He closes his eyes to cherish the warmth, shoulders relaxing in spite of the fact that he’s being hugged by a complete stranger, and wonders how this guy doesn’t have a line of people waiting for this.
This time, he does pull away with a shuddering gasp that feels like it’s been ripped out his chest. “Wh–”
“That a fact?” Tony asks, then breathes out a moan when Steve noses the skin right beneath his ear. “Wanna--
“Fuck,” Tony huffs, pinching the bridge of his nose as he leans back into his chair. “Can I just do this at home?”
“I already asked ‘em yesterday,” Steve says, “and I’m, uh...  I’m not too keen to go knockin’ on Bucky and Peg’s tent.”
“He’s the first person that comes to mine,” Steve snaps. The rest of the conference room is silent and tense, and Tony’s heart is beating so fast, they can all probably hear it.
The first thing Steve does is greet Agent May, which is why Tony is the only one who sees the young woman’s face change the moment she realizes who they are, eyes widening with shock and lips trembling even as they quirk up into the most relieved smile Tony’s ever seen.
Tony lifts his head from where it’s resting on Steve’s chest to glare at him. “If you drop me, I’ll kick your ass right off the island.”
He’d gone down to the workshop as soon as they’d been dismissed, ignoring every knowing eye aimed his way, ignoring the determination in Steve’s voice as he’d called Tony’s name. And now, hours later, the heavy knot in Tony’s throat still won’t go away, and he’s finally stopped pretending his hands aren’t shaking.
Tony feels his lips quirk up into a familiarly wicked grin. “Ooh, Mr. Rogers, wanna draw me like one of your French girls?”
"Well, these three,” Steve points to the green, red, and blue collared ones. “These are John, Paul, and George.”
“Oh,” Steve says, and Tony wants to kiss that look of awe right off his face. “Well, just you wait till the lights go on.”
PROMPT:  “H/c with sad Tony especially so I am here to prompt: Imagine a high school au like the Avengers are besties, but other than that Tony doesn't have any friends, people are always mean to him and bully him. Tony is so fed up with this, the comments are getting more and more cruel and one particularly bad day, he comes to the meeting with the Avengers and when they ask him what's up he just starts sobbing, cause he can't handle it anymore and he was holding it in for too long.”
“It’s our turn to host Tony,” Steve says, throwing a damp towel his way. “I don’t hear you complaining when we go over to Nat’s for Stroganoff-- and by the way, I’m not standing on a chair to clean the ceiling.”
“How the fuck would I know?” Clint flails. “But I’m so dead, she’s gonna murder me. I gotta go, forget I was here,” he points a finger at them, then at the egg. “If she finds me, I’m coming back and killing Peter.”
“So, uh,” Tony looks over his shoulder, jerking his thumb in Pepper’s direction. “This is Pepper Potts. Ex-PA, current CEO of Stark Industries. Pep... this is Steve Rogers. My husband.”
“No, no, don’t go, don’t leave-- I’m outside, don’t--” Tony says, but then the door moves and he almost falls forward and Steve’s
“Watch the suit, princess-- it’s Armani,” he continues, but can’t help but smile when she just proceeds to climb on his lap. She’ll definitely be leaving hairs everywhere, but Tony cradles her against him anyway. “Just a little longer--”
“Like what?” Tony asks. He arches his back against the elevator wall in a wanton stretch, so that it brings his chest an inch or two forward.
Steve can’t stop blushing through the whole thing. But that’s more than okay, because Tony is happy to distract him with kisses.
“You bet we will,” Steve says seriously, and before Tony can say anything else, pulls him back in to kiss his temple. “I’m going to miss you, Shellhead,” he whispers into Tony’s hair.
Tony’s heart almost hurts with happiness. “Love you too, cupcake. Now pick her up– chop chop, Cap, this is gonna be one hell of a Christmas!”
“But twice in one week, Rogers? Makes a guy wonder...” Tony smirks, and then feels his body warm all over when the blond’s eyes fall down to his lips.
Steve’s eyes soften even as he blushes. “Yeah?” he asks. It comes out muffled, and Tony pulls his hand back with a laugh.
“I don’t,” Big, Blond and Beautiful chuckles bashfully, hands fidgeting with a champagne glass of his own. “But this… this is more than I could’ve imagined. It’s an honor, Mr. Stark,” he finishes, holding out his free hand.
Bucky scoffs. “Maybe that’d work on someone who doesn’t know you as well, but you’re not fooling me, Stevie. You’re so obvious, it’s almost sad.”
“Hiya, Cap,” he finally says, and thinks it must be a trick of the light, the way Steve’s eyes seem to turn just the slightest bit darker.
“You drink almost more coffee than me-- and I’m practically ninety percent coffee at this point, Rogers. You wear a hoodie any time it's below sixty degrees, and you always have socks on, no matter what. You don't use ice, for fuck's sake, Steve. I'm a genius.”
voice-- breaks the bubble that he’d somehow been sucked into. It’s a shaggy haired man who’d asked the question, and Tony only notices him because he’s sitting next to
“The Drifters-- ‘White Christmas’,” he admits, chuckling when Tony’s smile grows into a knowing grin.
“Y'know, Stevie, it’s just a debrief,” James says a second later, casual as ever, and Natasha sighs in resignation at giving her team too much credit. “You didn’t have to go all out with the uniform.”
“We need to talk about these,” she pulls out the magazines and splays them out on the hood of car. Half a dozen shots of Tony and Steve walking around the city look back at them-- each of them wearing shirts or hoodies or baseball caps emblazoned with each other’s symbols in nearly all of them-- with a different variation of the same question as a caption:
“I’m about to fucking kiss you right now,” he crows, and almost doubles over when the blond appears to choke on his own tongue. “I think I’ll, uh, save that for later, though.”
Steve swats his shoulder gently. “God,” he breathes, “I thought you couldn't possibly get worse, but you were right--”
“Who told you that?” Tony scoffs, settling her higher up his chest until he can kiss her cheek. “You’re a riot, pumpkin.”
The jolt of heat that hits low in his stomach is impossible to ignore, because even though he and Mr. Rogers haven’t acted differently when they meet up in person, Tony knows about the new bet going on in the teacher’s lounge— Romanoff and Barton make a troubling twosome, as fun as they are together.
Tony’s grin is blinding, and when they eventually settle back down to watch the movie, so is Steve’s.
He licks his lips before he knows he’s doing it, and hears the chuckles from around the room grow into full fledged laughter.
The rain that’d been forecast is nowhere to be seen--not for the next couple of hours, at least--- and Steve feels absurdly, ridiculously thankful for the way it brightens up the common room floor, the floor-to-ceiling windows lighting up the kitchen in soft morning light that seems fitting for what he knows is coming.
“That’s– there’s no fucking way…” Tony trails off, mind racing with thoughts and questions and the repercussions if what he’s hearing is true.
“Not money, no, maybe. But it’ll be good to have friends in high places, Steve-o, and you’ll be up there in the highest of ‘em.”
“Alright,” Tony nods decisively, and sits up to leave the bed. “If that’s the way we’re doing it, hold the fort. I’ll be right back.”
"And then-- then, the fucking icing on the shitty cake... That you'd been impaled," Stark's voice breaks, "with a fucking construction bar."
He doesn’t know how long it all lasts, but when he finally pulls away for air, Steve’s smile is all he can see. “S-so this is n-nice, huh?” he pants, shivering from the delicious feel of Steve's body pressed to his.
“I, uh, had it all planned out,” Steve chuckles hesitantly. “I know this isn’t the nicest-- you deserve so much more, honest. But I swear the ring is burning a hole in the drawer--”
Because it’s not Jarvis waiting with Pepper next morning. It’s a tan, lean man in a fitted suit-- that obviously costs more than Steve makes in half a year-- with tousled hair, big brown eyes, and the most beautiful smile Steve’s ever seen.
Steve’s jaw hardens. “That doesn’t–” he makes a noise somewhere between a grunt and a sigh. “That just makes it worse, Jesus…”
“I’m not going out to buy all the shit he needs,” he sighs, because fighting Pepper almost never ends well.
“Thank you for loving her so much,” Steve whispers. “You’re crazy sometimes, sure, but you’re a wonderful father. I always knew you would be.”
“How ‘bout I pay you in kisses, baby?” Tony decides to purr, and then shivers when Steve’s eyes darken even as he blushes.
“I mean, you took up half my day for this. And yeah, good cause and all that— at least I hope it is— so woo hoo, not a total waste of time, and I’m kind of looking forward to all the super spying in the near future. But,” he drawls, stepping closer to the Captain with every word, “there’s just one. More. Thing. I want.”
“When I woke up, I had nothing. I had no one,” Steve says softly, and as a cold shiver than runs down his spine at the memories, he tugs Tony just a little bit closer. “But now I have a team-- a family. I have a home,” his voice wavers, eyes stinging with tears that he doesn’t let fall. “You gave that to me. I don’t need anything else. I can’t imagine ever wanting anything else.”
Steve’s eyes are bright and blue over the rim of his coffee mug as he takes a sip. “Last night was poker night,” he says, and--
But his husband just shakes his head, burying his nose in soft, golden hair. “I’m good, babe. This is… ‘m good.”
Remy gives one short, loud yip, and licks the tip of Steve’s noise, sending half the room into various states of groaning.
Steve runs a hand through long blond locks as they make their way to the elevator. “Don’t worry about it, okay?”
hope you’ll believe me. You always like to give people the benefit of the doubt, right?” She moves her gaze above Tony’s shoulder, clearly directing the question at Steve.
“I sweat to god, Jay, I’ll dump your ass at the nearest shelter if you don’t come over here. Right. Now.”
“They don’t trust me to walk. But I’m pumped full of meds, and nothing’s topsy turvy anymore, so I should be clear to sign off today.”
"Not the food, hon. This.." Tony waves his hand generally. "Whatever the fuck you call the day after Christmas--"
Steve lets out a sharp breath, and then he smiles.“Maybe you should,” he says, voice so soft and low.
“JARBIS,” Natasha whispers, snuggling further into the bedcovers. Her hair is a riot of curls around her, a flash of vibrant red against the muted tones of his bedroom.
“You make me–” Tony swallows, but doesn’t look away. “I’m not half as good at anything, as I am when I’m doing it next to you. You make me better, baby. So as long as you’re in this with me–”
She doesn’t have to wait long before she hears Steve whispering for Tony to wake up, and then the lump on the couch moves as the genius stretches above Steve.
Pepper lets out a muffled cry, and in his periphery, Tony sees his husband wiping at his own eyes with the back of his hand.
“You’d probably break the chair,” Tony mutters, “and put a hole through the floor with all your freak muscles.”
Steve falls asleep with a smile on his face, and hours later-- hours of nothing but Steve’s face and Steve’s hair, and Steve’s dog tags still clenched in his hands-- Tony lets the warmth lull him to sleep as well.
The worst part isn’t the waiting, like Tony might’ve imagined– if he’d ever managed to conjure up the nightmare he’s now living. No, it’s when they finally get him to leave the room.
“Zip it,” Steve grumbles, and then presents the now giant, singular sleeping bag. “Alright, get back in.”
“Lies. All of ‘em would kill for chance to be pressed up against all this,” Tony gestures to his body with a grin.
, the children are still right there. He definitely shouldn’t be so aroused by his little brother’s best friend’s brother-- who he’s just met, no less. “I’m Steve. Steve Rogers.”
When the Avengers alarm rings during lunch the next day, the team is up and running in minutes. But every single one of them spots the suitcases by the elevator, and the short flight out to Queens is a tense one.
Tony resists the urge to coo at his bed-ridden husband, and tosses him the tissue box instead. “Yes, sir,” he says. “And remember to stay in your bubble. I don’t want your super soldier flu killing me.”
He starts to pull away, a biting, all too casual remark on the tip of his tongue, but then there are arms being wrapped his waist, pulling him closer, and then--
“Is, um,” Tony traces random, nonsensical patterns on Steve’s chest. “Is going to art school-- is that something you, uh, y’know. Wanna do? Maybe?”
Steve’s blush comes back with a vengeance. “Oh my god– get outta here, you punk!” He waves the man away.
Clint’s voice breaks through the comfortable silence around them as he takes his seat on the quad table, and Steve feels his shoulders tense immediately. “It took me a while, but my little birds–”
“You shouldn’t fucking have to,” Tony sighs, and then inches back towards Steve. “Need a hand again?”
“Don’t you wanna help?” Steve’s eyes are wide and blue, with a smile so hopeful, that Tony knows he’s already screwed.
“I could let JARVIS know?…” Tony says, and Natasha’s almost certain she’s the only one that takes his wide-eyed look for the pleading it is, the others distracted and unfocused around her.
Steve stands up, holding the little black box in between his suddenly trembling fingers, and takes a step towards Tony, ignoring the pang of fear when Tony steps back a second later. “Why’d you think?”
He’s gripping the magazine tight so that it doesn’t slip from his fingers, and when he finally gets through the door, he doesn’t even bother with pleasantries.
“I don’t care where the bed ends up. As long as you’re in it with me,” Tony says simply, shrugging his shoulders even as he feels his lips quirk up into a soft smile.
“And if you don’t know by now, that’d I’d take being with you—all of you, however and wherever—over any of the frills this century’s got to offer… then I haven’t been doin’ a good job of showin’ it.”
There’s chaos and heat and screams all around him, but it feels like only seconds later that he’s sitting on the corner of a crumbling street– every part of his body encased in his suit except for his head– with Steve lying halfway in his arms, eyes wide and glassy as they meet Tony’s. There’s a dark red wound in his abdomen, and Tony just covers it with his hand.
Tony sinks into the love seat by the couch in silence, ignoring the movie in favor of watching his team. Natasha is a warm weight on his chest and lap, and in a moment of sheer, absolute happiness, he pulls her closer and closes his eyes to relish the feeling.
“Oh,” Tony’s head pops up from underneath, a grin plastered firmly on his greasy face. “Why didn’t you just say so?”
Tony lets out a loud, uncontrollable giggle, and leans forward to bury his head in Steve’s shoulder when it almost turns into a sob. “It’d be f-faster to just punch him, y’know.”
“You’re such a goober,” Tony mutters, giving that body one last, lingering glance before turning away. “Go watch the other ones while I put this one back in the living room.”
“Was it?” Tony asks pleasantly, but the slight clench of his jaw tells Steve that he’s far from feeling so.
“Save it,” Fury snaps. “Not another word from any of you idiots. I want each and every one of you in my office in the next minute or you are out of here, is that understood?”
“You kidding me?” Tony laughs, a thin and humorless little thing. “I haven’t seen you since–” he swallows, “since yesterday. How do you think I’ve been?”
It feels like hours before Tony wrenches his lips from Steve’s, only to let out one last moan when he looks up and finds those baby blues dark with hunger. “Okay, y-yeah,” he gasps. “I remember...”
“You threw it out the window twenty miles out the city!” Steve says, and then bats his eyelashes in a vague imitation of Tony. “
“Wonderful,” Tony says, and winks as he walks away, hips swaying much more than Steve thinks they usually do, but hey.
“Fuck yeah,” Tony can’t help smiling, because the machine finally gives him his honey bun and Steve sounds really happy about the trip, and now Tony’s thinking about it, too. It’s always there, in the back of his mind-- sometimes, it feels like the light at the end of the tunnel, as cheesy as that is, because he’s still looking forward to it
A hushed silence falls over his tiny passengers, every eye suddenly aimed his way expectantly. Even Steve looks impressed.
He waggles his eyebrows in that exaggerated manner he knows will always get Steve laughing, and sure enough, he gets to revel in the feel of warm breath brushing his cheeks like a kiss.
“I’ll see you in a few,” Steve says. “And we’re havin’ words about these ‘guys night out’s, Tony Stark.”
“Yes sir,” Steve nods, eyes twinkling with admiration, and then-- “You’re gorgeous when you’re like this.”
Steve’s already outside when Tony turns the street, and the sight of his best friend makes him drive just a little faster the rest of the way.
Steve’s laughter is slightly raspy, but after a full day of bed rest, it sounds considerably healthier than before. “Tryin’ to keep me sick, Mister Stark?”
Steve chuckles into Tony’s shirt, and even though it’s barely there, Tony grins at the hint of happiness.
Tony catches Steve’s gaze when their team huddles up, holding hands as they weave in and out the tree lines. “Go after ‘em, big guy,” he says. “they’re all yours today.”
“I think I might,” Steve replies, tightening his arms almost imperceptibly. “But maybe...” he drawls, pulling back. “Maybe I can just... give you my number?”
,” he hears Natasha whisper into his ear, red curls ticking his cheek as she plops down by his head.
“Ah, ah, ah, no— nope,” Tony tut-tuts, wagging a finger and grinning when Natasha lets out a soft, hushed giggle. “No babysitting. Absolutely zero babysitting. No babies here, Potts, so you can’t babysit not-babies.”
“Hey, Cap,” Tony grins again, “I know you’re twenty-six going on ninety, but you don’t have to walk around like it. We’ve only been waiting
But it’s Steve Tony can’t look away from, because the blond’s not smiling at the camera like Tony was. No, Steve has his head turned towards him, eyes closed as he presses his lips to the side of Tony’s head.
“Avengers!” He calls out gently (seeing as how his entire team is less than ten feet in every direction), and smiles a soft, affectionate smile when all conversation grinds to a halt, six pairs of eyes whipping over to him in eager anticipation. “How’s about you go get your surprises, hm?”
“Don’t fucking apologize,” Tony growls, grabbing the lapels on Steve’s black coat. “You don’t owe any of them anything, not right now.”
“Because I wanna marry you, damn it!” Steve blurts, heart thundering in his chest as fast as the blood rushing in his ears.
“Not working alone, then,” he guesses. “Not that I don’t think you could. I’m sure you’re more than competent, underneath all that—”
“I’m sure you can,” Tony smirks. “I just don’t think it’ll hold you. Papa’s a venti Cap, ain’t he, baby?” he asks their daughter. “And all your chairs are a tall.”
“Even when the world keeps spinning without me?” Steve whispers. “It’s so hard sometimes. Everything’s so loud, and fast, and bright. And I can’t keep up. I don’t know if I want to.”
His best friend sighs, and rubs his a hand over his face. “Just go over there and talk to him, Stevie. Ask him out.”
“Wouldn’t want it any other way,” Pepper hears Steve say, and smiles into the cushion she’s curled into. “I can’t… remember the last time I was this happy.”
“You’re a menace,” Steve sighs, but doesn’t pull away when the brunet lowers his head onto his shoulders. “I’m going to miss you, y’know…”
“Imagine my surprise when I found it in your drawers,” Tony grins. “Why is this the first time I’m seeing this, and more importantly, why the fuck haven’t you worn it?”
"Oh my god, I fucking love you,” he gasps, then his smile turns lecherous. "And you know how hot it get me when you talk dirty, so forget the coffee, babe-- lets go back to bed."
Steve squares his shoulders. “I’d like to see it sometime? Your shop-- only if you want to. I’m... I’m curious.”
“Papa, kitty!” their daughter squeals, proudly holding up the wriggling, purring bundle of white fur as she skips around the living room.
“That I don’t deserve any part of you,” Tony says it, almost gritting his teeth at how bitter the words taste. “What did
He’s also smart and kind and dedicated— which yeah, all big pluses, of course— but the fact that he’s hot like burning just can’t be ignored.
“I’m…” Steve gasps out one breath, then another, until he unfurls again and looks up at Tony through bright, watery eyes. “I’m o-okay. I’m fine, I s-swear.”
“You’re not a fan of stargazing, though. I usually have to drag you out here,” Steve chuckles, but stops when he turns back to him. “Hey, what’s wrong?”
“Just... just what? What’s going on, babe?” Tony asks, running his fingers through the short hair at the back of Steve’s nape, smiling when he feels the faintest shiver run down his boyfriend’s back.
“Fine, yes, you’ve been freezing your ass off. Which is a shame, really, because it’s a gorgeous ass--”
It’s so clear that none of them like it– Natasha’s mouth is a thin line that only gets grimmer the more Steve says, and Barnes clenches his fists so hard, Tony almost swears he can hear the metal grinding– but they all know it’s the only way to do it.
“Yep,” Tony pops the p, and then kisses Steve. “I dream about holding you and kissing you,” he moves down to mouth at Steve’s neck, “and fucking you on our bed. And just… being with you.”
Pepper’s smirking into her coffee, though, and Tony’s confused until he turns back to Steve and sees his smile grow to a mischievous grin.
A sudden blinding flash of light cuts her off, and before Tony can even blink, it forms a circle only feet away from them. Steve’s on his feet immediately, moving between them and the portal without hesitation. But their daughter just pops open the briefcase, and whoops as a metal suit expands and wraps itself around her.
“Because... I’ve been dreaming about this since we were sixteen,” he says, and he has to swallow once, then twice, to get rid of the lump in his throat. “Because you’ve been my best friend for as long as having anyone has ever mattered. Because when I think about getting outta here and seeing the world... there’s no one else I wanna do it with, except you.”
Steve looks down at their hands, and then back up with determined blue eyes. “Will you marry me?” he whispers.
The shaggy haired brunet sitting in the chair next to him shrugs his shoulders, and then winces when he ends up jostling said arm. “It’s better. Still hurts like a motherfucker, though.”
“Yeah?” Steve’s eyes are barely open now, and for the first time since they brought him in from the snowy New York Streets, Tony doesn’t panic at the sight.
“I find that really fucking hard to believe,” he replies just as softly, and reluctantly pulls his eyes away, towards his new companion and–
Steve shakes his head as he jumps up from his chair, and really, Tony thinks, no one should look so gorgeous with such a ridiculously giddy grin. “Okay, we’re gonna-- it’s... three o’clock, we can leave in an hour, do you need help packing? I can help--”
“Tiny Tony?” Steve turns to Tony as soon as they’re left alone. His eyes are bright and ocean wide in the morning light, and Tony nods until he can find the words.
“I don’t want anything else,” Tony says, and means every single word. “Even if... even if I all I came home to was you and a take out box.”
Steve’s laughter is soft and low, warmth brushing Tony’s cheek with every breath. “Well, as fun as that was, it’s not the present I was talking about.” In the dim light of their bedroom, he’s more beautiful than ever, baby blues so soft and full of love, Tony’s almost left breathless.
“Interesting morning we’ve had, don’t you think?” Coulson asks, and then holds up a hand when Sam opens his mouth. “Don’t answer that, Wilson. I’ve already informed Ms. Storm that you’ll all be late for Biology, so kindly turn that thing off and follow me, please.”
Steve takes another step closer, and this one brings him right beside Tony. “Do you still believe him?”
He bids the rest of his sleep goodbye, and opens his eyes to find bright, wide brown eyes inches from his face. “Uh…”
“Yeah?” the blond says, and shit, is Tony still saying everything out loud? “Y’still are. Goddamn it, where’s the ambulance--
Prompt: "Imagine that HYDRA or Red Skull is back and after Steve and Tony and Steve are at some kind of staged mission to capture them. At some point they are supossed to act like Steve got hit and died. So they get to it and Steve 'dies' in Tony's arms, but Tony gets a little bit too emotional and distressed, becuase he starts to think how that would be if it was true and he never told Steve how he felt about him. So Tony just kinda curls around Steve and he can't stop crying."
“I should ask the tenants if they’ll help me build an elevator,” Tony says, stepping around the blond to lead them both in. “This is ridiculous.”
“Yes?” Pepper calls out, and frowns when Daisy enters tentatively, a stack of papers pressed to her chest. “What… what’s wrong?”
Steve looks down at Tony, eyes bright and twinkling from the Christmas lights strung all around the room, and then curves his lips into that thrillingly familiar smirk. “Lemme remind you, then,” is all Tony gets to hear him say before he’s pressed into the wall and kissed the way Steve only ever kisses him in the bedroom: deeply and hard and utterly
Pepper almost slams into them, grabbing Steve’s arm to steady herself as she crowds Tony’s space. “Oh my god,” she breathes, bright green eyes blurry with emotion. “She’s absolutely
“You’d be surprised how hard those things can hit. Especially when some of the bigger guys like you are throwing them.”
“Yeah,” Tony nods, but he thinks something in his face must’ve said otherwise– or maybe it’s just the fact that it’s Steve; Tony’s always been an easy book when it comes to his Captain– because the blond’s smile turns fond and a little sad all at once.
“She said she wants chicken!” Clint shrieks, and more than one person in the room winces at the volume.
Steve can barely see anything through the tears in his own eyes, but he manages to pull out the ring without dropping it, as he holds it out. “Can I...”
“And I figured it wouldn’t hurt to give it to ya now. C’mere,” Steve pats the space in front of him, and even with his heart still feeling like it’s halfway out his chest, Tony follows his Captain’s orders.
Tony stops him before he can pull them further into the hallway, and instead walks them over to the couch. “Sweetie. Cupcake. Gumdrop. Baby,” he drawls, pushing Steve down, and then climbs onto his lap.
“I can’t imagine it ever could,” he whispers back, and his own voice sounds rough and wrecked. He wonders if that’s how he looks, with his dirty hair and even dirtier uniform that he hasn’t changed out of since they’d first rushed Tony in.
“Blah, blah, blah. Nat’s pretty bummed out about that, y’know– I can’t tell if that level of trigger happy’s even possible.”
“You could buy your mom souvenirs from London and Spain, and Mexico and Japan and Istanbul. Or some designer shit from all over Paris. Don’t tell me you wouldn’t fucking kill for that.”
When he gets back from lunch, he has to hold the urge to squeal when he sees a piece of blue that wasn’t there before:
Tony hears, then there are hands on his shoulder, on his chest, and it feels like they’re everywhere.
“Is there any way we can, y’know, skip the scans?” the brunet asks when Steve turns back to him, fiddling with the edge of one sleeve. “I’m… not a fan of small spaces.” He sounds anything but cocksure now, and even though he’s pretty much a stranger, Steve feels a warm rush of protectiveness sweep over him.
Now, room seven isn’t a small room by any means– neither are the rest of the rooms in this wing of the hospital– but his first thought when he enters is that it feels oddly cramped.
Steve shakes his head, lips quirked up as he glances Tony’s way. “Peachy keen, actually. After bein’ in the desert for eighteen months, I’ve learned to appreciate pretty much and kind a’weather.”
” comes the faint, distant reply from Jarvis, and little Tony holds up the doll as the sound of footsteps grows louder.
“Damn right,” Steve nods, then pushes Tony all the way to the couch and sits down on the floor next to it.
“No need butter me up, big guy. I’m goin’,” Tony mutters, but hides his burning face into the lapels of Steve’s coat. “You fight dirty.”
“I don’t know how to, I’m not... not cut out for this, but I just...” Tony shakes his head, and just closes his eyes when Steve leans in to press their foreheads together. “I just keep-- I keep thinking,
“Because I’ve always wanted to do it?” Steve’s smile is smug but genuine, and bright as the fucking sun.
“Oh fucking Christ,” Barnes groans, slamming his cards down. "Can the two of ya losers even go a whole hour before acting like a couple of horndogs?”
“My mom, yeah. Ana Jarvis, too. I was-- was probably five, six years old, I think.” He traces one zigzagged edge of Thor’s card, and his finger comes back gleaming silver. “Can’t remember what I wrote, but I, uh... I know I meant every word. I don’t-- don’t see how I couldn’t have. They were...
“Fine, great, like every other time I’ve been there. But I’m taking you with me next time, jesus. It’s like I can’t fucking leave you alone--”
He leaves everything out and ready, and then sends a mass text as he leaves the tower, to everyone but his boyfriend:
“... Sorry, I didn’t get that,” Tony says, but now he’s smiling Steve’s favorite smile, the one with the beautiful curve of his lips and those crinkly eyes, so Steve knows he definitely did.
“Right,” Tony nods. “Okay, so... Jesus, Rhodey already wants to kill me, he might not even laugh when I tell him this-- sorry,” he winces, when Steve furrows his brow in confusion, and he’s still standing in front of everyone like an idiot but he really needs to get this out, because he’s more than a little freaked out by all of this. “Okay, this is crazy, alright? But, I’m not kidding, your voice sounds exactly like my thinking voice.”
Steve grins. “It was my grandpa’s. I’ve been workin’ on it for months down at Buck’s garage. Now, you comin’ or what?”
“Sounds perfect,” Steve says, and when Tony gives him a soft, shy smile, Steve knows he believes him.
“Yeah, but…” Tony breathes again and meets Steve’s eyes. “Fuck it, I’m a little emotional today, okay?”
“God,” Bucky groans, loud enough to break through their rambling. “Just go ‘head and suck face already, we all know you’re dying to.”
?” Bucky hears all the way down the hall, and Steve suddenly sighs from where he's perched at the edge of the bed. There are mumbles that turn to shouts, the sound of footsteps get closer, and then the door is almost ripped off its hinges as Stark comes barreling in.
“I hope not,” Steve shakes his head. “God, you don’t even… I hope she has your heart, y’know… And your brain. I hope she has your spirit. I hope she gets your stubbornness and your wit; I hope she gets your attitude, and your joy of life. I hope she gets that look in your eye when you think of something new and extraordinary. I hope I see you in everything she does, ‘cause you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
Tony loses track of time after that, focused on keeping up a soft, steady conversation with the girl in his arms, and not losing Steve and their rag tag team, though with the noise they make, he could probably find them a mile away.
“And I appreciate it, honest. Not that I particularly care how big our bed is, though, as long as you’re the only one in it with me.”
“Yeah,” Steve replies, and how he can look so at ease with a burn on his leg, Tony has no idea. “But I think this is kinda throwin’ a wrench in our plans.”
“--bout you go pick out a seat for the day while I talk to your dad for a sec, yeah? Then you can tell me all about your awesome backpack.”
“It’s almost six, sweetheart,” Steve laughs, and Tony feels him press a kiss to the top of his head. “Half the team’s probably up already.”
“Tin can?” Tony deadpans, but his eyes soften as they meet Steve’s. In the morning light, he looks so beautiful that it takes Steve’s breath away, and he almost leans in to kiss Tony again.
Steve feels the warmth in his face spread further down his neck, and for the first time since he started working as a helper Elf at Santa’s Winter Wonderland, he thanks God for the ridiculous costume he’s wearing. “Hi, Tony.”
“Don’t you know?” Steve asks just as softly, and god, everything about this man makes Tony’s heart beat and break all over again.
“You’re impossible,” Tony laughs. “Now go get me a second brownie from the cafeteria crones, will you?”
,” Tony whines, and with a sigh, Steve turns around until they’re face to face, taking in the gleam in Tony’s eyes from the moonlight streaming in from his window. “Hi, there.”
“In... heaven.” The words are hard to say, and it’s even harder to see those eyes he loves so much grow wet with tears.
does. It’s not long before he realizes he’s lost because he can’t even look at the road-- the anger in Howard’s face is seared into his eyes and
“Don’t worry, I bet Nat’ll whip out her phone the second she realizes what’s going on,” Bucky replies.
okay?” Steve then asks. “You’re lookin’ awfully banged up too,” he reaches out a hand, like he wants to touch Tony’s face, but then catches himself with another blush and pulls it back. “Sorry.”
“Uh huh!” Peter nods, wriggling excitedly as he takes turns looking at the two of them. “An’ he liked my Cap backpack, an’-- an’ Daddy! He had Cap’n ‘Merica cookies ‘an he gave us some!”
“You put all these up yourself?” Steve points at all the fairy lights and colored lantern balls decked out around the canopy they’re under.
“Okay,” Steve nods, and then Tony’s heart skips a beat when he smirks. “Gonna gimme a kiss for luck?”
“T-Tony,” he says, forcing himself to breathe even though his head still feels like it’s getting tossed around inside a jar.
It takes him a couple of days to figure out how to tell Bucky, but eventually he just sits him down and does it.
“Ditto. About kicking you. In the balls,” Tony replies, careful to keep the ice pack over his bruised eye. “How’s your arm?”
"Right... I, uh, I get this... thing here," he taps his chest with a finger, "when I see him? Even when he was, like, half our size-- and I... I think about who he is, y’know? And he's the nicest guy I've ever met--"
Tony thinks. “I changed my mind,” he says instead, shrugging. “Any means necessary, Cappy bear, we need to take Schmidt down. And since we can’t sniper that bastard–”
“You know it, Potts. Nice is my middle name,” Tony shrugs casually, unwinding a roll of bright red streamers. From her perch on his lap, a tiny Natasha waves the end of it gently, and Pepper feels her heart warm when Tony softly, unconsciously caresses the crown of her head with his chin.
Tony’s knees suddenly feel weaker than they’ve ever felt, and he can barely hear his voice through the rush of blood in his ears. “What...”
When he finally shuffles back into the room– for all that he’s made his life beside Steve Rogers, for the past week, and for the last few years, he wills himself to stay outside and let the rest of the team have their moments; God knows they’ve earned it– there is no silence.
“And we’ve got someone on the line right now,” he says, pressing the red flashing button in front of him to open the call. “Remember, you guys can always call in and request anything you’d like to hear. You’re on the air, caller.”
Steve’s standing by the stove, all broad shoulders and deliciously muscled arms moving over multiple pans. He’s chuckling at something one of them’s just said, and Tony’s focused so much on the wonderful sound, that it takes him a second or two to notice the room’s gone quiet.
need sleep, and at this point I will pay you to go to bed. Leave your phone here, though-- God knows you won’t get any if you take it with you.”
Not that he even gets to thinking it, because his entire world is reduced to the slow, lazy kisses he’s getting and giving, and the reassuring weight of that familiar body above his.
Bucky shrugs. “Fancy suit, shiny shoes? Looks like a Scotch guy. Lemme just go take a piss before you do anything, though.”
Steve mumbles something under his breath, just low enough that Tony can’t make out, before giving him a soft smile. “Where–where’d you, um…”
“You’re right, what was I thinking?” He murmurs. “You and me and Pep and Brucie-bear and Point Break can knock it out outta the park, hmm?”
Tony would laugh at the dazed, distracted tone of Steve’s voice, but when he looks down at the tiny bundle nestled in the carrier between them, he knows he sounds exactly the same. “The wall can’t be that interesting.”
It’s not often that she stays over at the Tower these days, which is perhaps why she can’t help the yelp she gives when she’s wakes up the next morning to a pair of wide, curious green eyes inches from her face.
“We only just met, and you’re already talking about destiny,” Steve replies, and he looks so perfect standing by the big, clear windows-- like he’s everything Tony’s never known he’s wanted-- and Tony still has no fucking clue how Steve’s voice sounds exactly like his thinking voice, but he couldn’t care less about that anymore. He’ll take what he can get.
“Look at me,” she says, and that’s when Tony realizes he’s looking back down at Steve again. “Remember yesterday,” she continues, and even though they’re whispered, Tony hears the words clear as day. “
“I swear I saw him snickering in the back, even after we told him to hold off on putting ‘em in her salad.”
anything else. He has yet to know what her warm weight would feel like in his arms, has yet to know how soft her little blond hair would feel like against his rough, callused hands. It’s only when she’s like this, still and silent to the world, that he dares to do nothing else but look at her.
“Maybe. But I’m onto you now, Mr. Stark,” Steve smirks, and then he’s pressing Tony up against the elevator again, close enough that their noses brush against each other once, then twice. “And I don’t like to lose.”
“You were worth every doubt I ever had-- that I wasn’t good enough, that I’d never be able do anything to make the world better. And you were worth every damn bit of pain I felt when the serum changed me. You were worth every moment of loneliness I’ve ever felt. God... you were worth every minute, every second, of those seventy years in the ice. And I’d do it all again, a thousand times. I’d do it in a heartbeat.”
“He’s gorgeous,” Steve says, his smile bright and happy and everything Tony always wants him to be. “Thank you.”
Tony can only nod, and bite back a groan at the sight of Steve’s ass as he turns and runs back down to the field.
“I do, I know that,” Steve breathes into Tony’s hair, and then pulls him down until they’re face to face beneath a mountain of covers. “I love you too. You’re… everything.”
It’s Rhodey’s turn to start, and when he looks over his shoulder, Steve’s pulling himself up from the couch he’s clearly been lying across. He’s in socks, sweatpants and a plain white t-shirt, and he looks so comfortable-- in Tony’s not-so-zen place of zen, of all places-- that Rhodey needs a second to take it in.
“Well, you’re the one who wanted this,” Tony pokes his chest. “So go out there and show ‘em who’s boss, yeah?”
,” Tony mutters, and leans over-- how he doesn’t fall off the tiny chair, Steve has no idea-- to kiss her hair. “You’re giving me cavities.”
Steve whimpers one second, and then the next, he palms the back of Tony’s head to bring their lips together. It’s soft and slow, and everything they both live for when they’re together, but there’s also an intensity that’s never been there before.
It’s sudden and clumsy and more than a little salty from his tears, but Tony pours every bit of his scarred and broken heart into it. And when he finally pulls away, it’s only to rest his forehead against Steve’s.
The soft lilting breaks through the chaos in Tony’s mind like very few things are able to these days, and when he looks up from his tablet, the sight is enough to make his heart skip a beat.
“I know,” Peggy smiles, and jerks her head at Steve. “Your president won’t stop talking about you, y’know.”
“I’m an ass all the time. I get it,” Tony says, and then lets out a hiss when the ice pack digs into the bruised skin around his eye.
Tony nods, and lets his body relax against the solid, steady presence of his Captain. “I’m surprised they managed to keep their grabby little paws to themselves. Alright,” he waves lazily in the direction of the tree. “Go nuts.”
"I can't help it, I mean look at you," Tony replies, relishing the happy lurch his heart gives. He doesn’t think it should be possible to love two people this much. "I almost kept it to myself, but it's not like I don't get to keep you two to myself, so really. Never let it be said that Tony Stark's not a giver, right?"
vIt feels like ages before Steve pulls away, as slowly as he’d kissed him, and leans their foreheads against each other.
Only to fumble it as he tries to open it. It slips from his fingers, but doesn’t reach the floor before Steve catches it.
Even in the dim, early morning light filling the tent, Steve’s blush is as beautiful as ever. “What if I smiled now?”
“We can share,” Tony gives him a smile as he holds the plush out, and Steve shuffles closer until the toy is squished in between them.
It’s nothing either of them doesn’t already know, but Steve still feels disappointment wash over him like a wave, and when he turns back to face Tony, he knows he’s not the only one. “Thank you, ma’am,” he tells the doctor, sighing as she nods before leaving the room.
“I will end you, Rogers,” Tony warns, pushing the blond off, and he hopes Steve doesn’t notice how breathless the words sound. “
"I just reminded him that she was a foreign exchange student," he points out heatedly. “She was going back to England at the end of the year, he would've been...
“It’s all online, you’ll get them by tomorrow. Oh my god, Tony, you’re going love having a cat,” she squeals, with a happy little jump.
Steve wraps his arms around him-- like he did the night of their promise, like he’s done countless times since they were six-- and twirls him around as everyone crows and whoops and cheers their congratulations.
“You’re welcome,” Steve replies, and when he shifts Tony’s grip until their fingers intertwine, Tony finally feels at home too.
Tony shoves the paper in his face. “I’ll tell you what the problem is,” he snaps. “Look at how many people you have coming from your side.”
“Oh, look at this one, this was the first one I put up,” Tony pulls up a picture of their baby at her high chair in the kitchen, looking up at the camera with wide blue eyes as she gives it a gummy grin. There’s a blob of apple sauce leaking out the corner of her mouth, but she’s still the most amazing thing Tony’s ever seen.
Through the rush of blood in his head, Steve hears the horrifyingly familiar voice of his best friend, and sure enough, when he braves himself to look up...
“Here, just stop talking and eat this,” Rhodey grins, sliding a wrapped sandwich at him, and Tony’s just about to reply, except the smell wafts up to him and–
“I dunno,” Steve says, and then grins as he tightens his hold on Tony’s waist. “I’m pretty happy with what I’ve got right now.”
There’s a man sitting at the corner, huddled by a handful of other people, and he has his head thrown back in laughter-- the same fucking laughter Tony hears in his head sometimes, how is that possible?-- sun shining through the window and making his hair shine gold. The pale, long line of this throat is just
“Didja like ‘em?” Bucky chirps. He looks so pleased-- they all do, and it’s an absolute joy to see-- that Steve reaches out to ruffle his hair affectionately.
,” Maria snaps again, dropping the camera so that it only catches her feet as she walks away with Tony, and Howard’s stumbling gait as he tries to follow her.
“Me too,” he rasps, and the pain in his chest is almost bearable. “I n-need you to remember that, mom. I’m going to fuck up--”
Even with all the time they spend together during the day (Steve’s heart flutters every time Tony insists on the two of them caring for their team
“Smart ass. Just for that, you can peel and cut those apples over there,” he points to a bowl on Bucky’s side of the kitchen island.
“I’m not saying it’ll be easy. I don’t know if I ever--” Bucky swallows the sudden lump in his throat. “There was someone, I think... I remember. Sometimes. But I’m not pretendin’ I know what it’s like. But when it’s real, though? You’d either be an idiot or a coward to pass it up. And I know you ain’t either.”
“I hope they remember this,” Steve says, turning in his seat to face Tony. “I hope they remember how special you made their holidays.”
“We should probably go,” he sighs in defeat, and starts shepherding everyone out the way Tony came. Rhodey and Sam and Thor pat his shoulder as they pass him, and Pepper kisses his cheek. Bucky gives both of them a smile and a thumbs up before leaving, and then they’re alone.
“Aw, but I got you a present, sunshine,” says a warm, familiar voice, and Steve almost shivers when his eyes rise to meet gorgeous brown ones.
Tony relents with a sigh, even as his heart pitter patters pitifully at the thought of spending an entire day with Steve, of getting those eyes and that smile all to himself. “Don’t see how that’s better than a plane,” he mutters.
"I didn't fucking know if--" Stark stops, and only Bucky can see the way his fingers are digging into his palm.
“Ditto,” Tony nods. His fingers move down to find Steve’s, and it’s with a soft, content sigh that he brings them up to press a kiss to his wrist.
“It’s cute how you took that as a request,” Tony sniffs, though his grin all but lights up the room. “Say sayonara to the glitz and glamor, big guy— you’re stuck with this from now on,” he gestures to their slumbering teammates, scattered on the floor and the rest of Pepper’s couch.
“Your boyfriend’s here,” Natasha tells Steve, just as he’s finished photographing a pair of toddlers grinning from their perch on Santa’s lap, and he almost gives himself whiplash as he whips his head in the direction of the thinning line a couple of feet away, breath hitching at the familiar head of tousled locks at the end of it.
Pepper’s the only one in his room when they bring him in some time later, but Tony doesn’t know how long it’s been, seeing as all he remembers is a blur of bright lights and the bliss of pain medication as it kicked in.
Tony shivers where he stands. “You fight dirty,” he purrs. “But don’t talk the talk if you can’t walk the walk.”
Steve laughs as he pulls away. “Now lemme go whip up another batch-- Nat’s gonna kill us if we don’t have anything ready.”
He’s pushed into lean but firm arms, and recognizes Natasha’s low hiss of a warning when he struggles against them.
It’s not until after he comes back in with a pizza box on his arm that he spots it, and he almost drops his food when he recognizes the handwriting-- neat, slightly slanted, but undoubtedly elegant.
“Yeah, okay,” Tony finally whispers, and reaches out with trembling hands to pull Steve in and kiss him. “Yes, I’ll marry you, baby,” he gasps, after they pull away. “I’ll marry the fuck out of ya.”
“What would that be, Mr. Stark?” the Captain asks, and even though the words are soft and innocent, those eyes—dark and dilated now, god they’re gorgeous— are doing nothing to hide the hunger inside.
“No, Tony. Listen to me, because we’ve already had this conversation once, but you’re drunk and you always forget things when you’re drunk, so we’re havin’ it again. You’re so much more than what he thinks-- what they
Tony doesn’t even thank him as he leaves. He has to stop himself twice to breathe before he reaches the room they have Steve in, but then he sees him.
Tony freezes, eyes zeroing in on each of them. The labels are yellowed and dusty, but even from where he stands, he can just barely make out the curly, elegant hand of Jarvis’ writing. “That–” he clears his throat, glancing quickly at Clint’s face before looking away. “Those are–”
“Well yeah, this is pretty tough to beat,” Tony says. “I honestly don’t know why I ever do anything else, I could just stay here forever.”
“I’m the fun dad, obviously. You’re boring one, honey pie. Sorry,” Tony shrugs, rocking the miniaturized baby carrier in front of them. “I wonder who this one’ll take after.”
And then... there's Jarvis, who's developed a rapport with Steve that Tony finds alarming. He's affectionate and calm and
“Hi,” he replies, and if the word comes out a little breathless, he doesn’t think anyone could blame him.
“Eh, you know how Rogers is, and toddlers aren’t much different than centenarians, as it turns out— I’m cursed to suffer through it. Chop, chop, Potts!”
“I live to surprise, Jimbo,” Stark says, then winces a second later. “Sorry, reflex. Rhodey’s a James too.”
It’s somewhat of a frantic scramble as the room clears out almost immediately, and Tony’s sigh sounds much louder in the new silence.
Steve’s eyes, already bright and slightly wet from his fever, soften with emotion. “I love you so much,” he rasps.
“Say good morning to Pepper, Tony,” Steve says gently, wrapping his arms around the brunet’s waist, and Pepper has known Tony longer than anyone alive-- except Rhodey, of course-- but she can’t remember the last time she saw him like this, pliant and relaxed, and comfortable with another person enough to allow the physical interaction she’s seeing right now.
“I’m home alone with five rowdy monsters, that’s what’s wrong. I can’t believe this was your idea, you’re usually a lot less stupid--”
“Yeah, yeah, I hear you,” Tony rolls his eyes, but when Steve greets them out in the living room with his gorgeous, ‘good morning’ smile, he thinks the early wake up just might’ve been worth it.
His heart picks up speed almost immediately, but Tony takes his time in lifting his eyes to meet Steve's, and Jesus, they’re wide and bright and so fucking blue that something inside Tony just comes loose, like he's breaking and coming back together all at once.
“I thought you’d all like ‘em,” Steve rubs the back of his neck bashfully, only to huff out s chuckle when Natasha leans over to ruffle his hair.
“No, we’re not getting pizza again later,” Steve shakes his head. “Their stomachs’ll never let ‘em sleep.”
“Don’t,” Tony snarls, shaking his head frantically and oh, his heart is beating like a jackhammer now because he’s been ignoring it for hours, but Barnes is here and if they start talking about it, it’ll be real and
He breaths once, twice, and then nods, but in the end, she has to pry his hands open so they can take Steve away.
Steve tries so hard to ignore the warmth he can feel in his cheeks. “You’re pretty lucky, sir. You took a nasty fall, and you could’ve cracked your skull.”
When Tony finally opens his eyes again, Steve is all he can see. “I don’t know... you might have to convince me.”
Steve shakes his head, even though all he wants to do is follow those lips. "She knows you're worth it,” he says, and feels his chest grow warm when Tony’s smile softens.
Steve smiles, and looks down. “I wanted it to be a surprise,” he says softly. “Wasn’t even sure I was gonna get in, to be honest--”
“Yeah, it’s me,” he replies, just as the door slides open and he’s treated to the most gorgeous blue eyes he’s ever seen. “Hi, there.”
“Will do, Shellhead,” is all Steve says, and in the peaceful silence that follows the end of the conversation, Pepper allows herself to drift off for the night.
“Gimme a minute, I just…” he trails off, running to their baby’s room to find what he’s looking for.
Steve’s grin is bright and hopeful, and the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen. “I’m too impatient--”
Tony’s pretty sure that’s a result of them being newly married– and god, he’s so fucking hard right now, he’s seconds away from coming in his pants, but he thinks he might cry (again) at how that word makes him feel…
“Yeah,” he says, and then Steve’s sweet smile is the last thing he sees before soft, warm lips are pressed against his own. He’s so stunned by it that he doesn’t move for a second or two, but then Steve lets out a noise not unlike a whimper and Tony just
Natasha’s lips quirk up in a shy smile, and she climbs off him to join the group by the tree. Tony hears Steve chuckle as the boys pass her gifts to her like an assembly line, and then the room breaks into a squealing, giggling chaos.
“One day, I’m gonna sit you down and we’re gonna have this conversation if I have to tie you down to a chair.”
“Which is why I’m here with you, gorgeous, instead of anywhere else,” Tony says. “Just don’t fuck it up, ‘kay?”
“Guess I’m chopped liver, huh?” Tony mutters down at their daughter, smiling as the sound of bright, happy giggles fills the room.
Tony looks up and nods. “Have fun,” he says, smiling as Rhodey leaves with one last wave. It’s only after he’s lost sight of his best friend that he lets out a curse and runs a hand through his hair.
“Christ,” Barnes’s voice breaks through the chaos, and then he grabs Tony’s shoulder and pushes him all the way to the ratty couch against the wall.
“Y’need t’stop sayin’ th-- hey, who’s pickin’ m’up?” Tony says, and then the next second he’s on a gurney and in the truck, and he can hear Steve talking-- to all his friends, probably, even though Tony didn’t see any of them-- before he’s back by Tony’s side and they’re off.
When he hears soft chuckles beside him, he turns to find Steve with the dopiest grin on his face. “But
!” Pepper hisses, hair flying out behind her as she whips around to glare at him. “Speak a little louder, why don’t you.”
He gets absorbed in his lesson again, and doesn’t see the second blue sticky until he’s getting ready to leave for his lunch break. But when he does read it, he wishes he’d waited until the end of the day, because how the fuck is he supposed to get his brain to work again now?
“You should take care of yourself, Tony. We don’t want anything else to happen,” he says, and Tony can’t even say anything to that because Steve’s so close and
“Pretty much the only things I know how to make,” Steve says, rubbing the back of his neck bashfully. “It’s, um, Spaghetti. And I also made chicken, if you-- if you want that, too. I know it’s... it’s not much, but--”
“Sure thing, sugar,” Tony reaches up to bop Steve’s nose, and then yelps when Steve lunges forward and wraps an arm around his waist. “Hey!”
“-- but I hope you have a good time. I do want you to... to feel at home. Like I feel when I’m with you.”
"Shut up,” Tony scoffs immediately, but Steve doesn’t miss the beautiful blush that settles across his face. “Who’s not makin’ sense now?”
"I can’t think of anything better than seeing you in everything she does,” Steve continues, voice soft with the same wonder Tony sees in his eyes as he looks at her.
They’re in the middle of the library, and there’s a handful of people within sight, but Steve still kisses Tony like it’s the very first time. He pours every bit of emotion and enthusiasm and love into it, and feels relief rush through him when Tony returns the kiss without hesitation.
“You sure?” Tony tries to sound serious, but the smile on his face still hasn’t gone away, so he’s pretty sure he fails.
,” he says, and rubs the back of his head bashfully. He can’t remember the last time he felt this shy. “
“Okay, yeah,” Tony shrugs, and smiles back up at him from his perch on one of their baby girl’s kiddie-sized chairs. He barely fits on the seat, and his knees are drawn up to his chest-- a tablet resting on his knees-- but he doesn’t look like he has any intention of moving. “She convinced me, no surprise. It’s...” he wiggles. “It’s not that bad.”
“Steve,” Tony reaches over to grip his arm, but almost flinches at the wild, dangerous look in those baby blues when the blond turns to look at him.
Steve chuckles, running his hand through Jarvis’ fur while the bastard purrs his little heart out, and really, this is just like Jarvis-- an angel with Pepper and Bruce, and Rhodey, and even Natasha will cuddle him. But leave him with Tony, and all hell breaks loose--
“I’m not marrying you because of your family, or your friends, or how many people are in your life, Tony,” Steve rasps, voice tight with emotion. His heart feels like it’s about to burst from pure, overwhelming love. “I wanna marry you because I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want you, forever. Until the day I die. I don’t give a damn if we’re the only ones at the wedding, baby-- as long as we’re
“‘m surprised Steve’s not in here with ya,” Bucky says, barely holding back a laugh when Tony’s cheeks turn the faintest shade of pink. “The two’f you are tied at the hip.”
“Oh, yeah, okay. Let’s, uh, go find you something?” Tony replies, lips brushing bright blond hair as he hoists baby Steve further up in his arms, and tries not to make them tense. "You like, um... cookies?”
Prompt: “Tony so desperately wants to have a kid and be a great father but at the same time he is terriffied. So when they adopt a child Tony is too scared to even pick him up, he doesn't try to talk to him etc. Steve is helpless. But then a mission goes wrong and Steve goes missing for two weeks. And the night when Tony finds out about it he just goes to his son and picks him up and when Steve comes back Tony and their son are inseparable.”
He does it again a few more times, and when nothing happens, he resigns himself to the fact that he’s going to have to find the little beast himself. He checks every inch of his apartment twice, and when there’s no sign of Jarvis, he finally starts to worry. As much as he’d resisted at first, he’s finally gotten used to the little fur ball, and the thought of him hurt or missing only makes Tony look again.
“It’s beautiful,” he says against Natasha’s head, scarlet tendrils tickling his lips as he does so. “Tony’s going to love it.”
“Not planning on throwing that ring back at me anymore, are ya?” He asks, lips brushing along Tony’s temple.
"Another year of bein' an Avenger, and going out there with my family to fight the bad guys. Another year of movie nights and birthdays and holidays."
“I think I needed that,”Tony mumble. “I needed… God, I just needed to come home.” His voice breaks on the last word, and just like that, the silence sobers up again.
Tony freezes and then reaches up to feel them. “Thanks, baby doll,” he teases, smiling sweetly at Steve, who rolls his eyes even as he blushes, and ignores everyone else’s knowing glances. Pepper finally finds his phone in the kitchen, so Tony fist bumps Rhodey and Thor, waves at Sam and Bucky and Bruce and Clint, sends Natasha a playful wink and then–
His lips are quirked up into a grin as bright as his cheeks are ruddy, and Tony only just manages to keep the groan of want building up in his throat. Instead, he picks up a handful of snow and starts packing it into a ball. “You caught me by surprise, you ass-- it won’t happen again.”
“JARVIS locked me out the workshop,” he says, walking past the blond and into the softly lit living room. “Something about a thirty plus hour work binge.”
“Mmmm, well you d-do bring out the best in me,” Steve moans, arms coming up to warm the small of Tony’s back.
"No one should be that sweet, you get fucking cavities from watching him. But then, he's also such a little shit. Like, no room for screwing around, he will fuck you up. And it was worse when he was little, because he never stopped-- half the time, I was terrified they'd split him in half, Jesus... And I know I'm not easy to deal with--"
“I hate you all,” Clint grumbles, even as Tony catches the familiar, relaxed quirk at the corner of his lips.
Tony doesn't get what's funny about trying to keep his best friend from getting hurt. "I was trying to... Look, there's a lot of assholes around here, and I’m sure as hell not letting anyone take advantage of him."
“Okay!” Steve all but jumps up, keeping his hold on Tony steady as he starts walking toward the kitchen. “Let’s just– I’m just gonna take him… somewhere.”
.” Tony says nothing, and there’s no way Bucky’s not taking advantage now. “Everyone and their Ma can see you two are goners. Except Steve, ‘cause he's always been so fucking blind to it.
The sun’s well on its way down when they leave the parking lot, tree tied up above the car, and all the kids buckled down inside.
. But that’s not even... His kids are half in love with him, and he walks around in every class, just, I don't know what he tells them, but he makes them all smile and he... he makes me smile. And just look at this, I'm sending it to you now."
“If you’re... I couldn’t shower for weeks after--” Tony waves his hand around vaguely. In the distance, the sound of laughter mingles with the Christmas music blaring from the speakers even farther away. “Just say the word and I can call it a day.”
Rhodey curses as some of it falls into his lap, but Tony barely hears him. Barely hears anything around him because he just heard his thinking voice, inside the coffee shop.
“Hope you learned your lesson,” Tony tuts. “Kitchens plus unsupervised Tony equals mess. For shame, Rogers.”
He’s not expecting the other man to fall silent, barely even breathing as he stares, until– “She looks like Sarah.”
“Wow, calm down,” he laughs, and keeps walking. “Now, what kinda shit do dogs need… Oooooh, I like that– what is that, is that a bed? Get that bed, Jim Jam, I can’t reach.”
“Not always,” Tony grumbles, but the effect is ruined when he moans around a mouthful of pasta and bacon. “Jesus Christ, this is from Marcello’s down on third, isn’t it?”
“Yeah,” he admits. “I am. But if I see you moping around the new digs anytime soon, Rogers, I swear--”
, hiding behind a pile of boxes stacked in the middle of the room like they’re playing a fucking game.
“Steve Rogers,” she says, voice suddenly cool, and oh, Tony remembers that look. “I know who you are.”
“Anytime,” Steve replies, eyes falling to the glasses yet again, and the warmth that blooms in Tony’s chest stays with him for the rest of the day.
v“God, it should not be so easy,” Tony grumbles, taking the coffee, and feels his heart skip a beat when his fingers brush Steve’s.
He’s on his feet and walking towards the group before he even realizes what he’s doing, and the sound of Rhodey calling out his name is barely registering because right now his mind is all golden hair and sunshine and
“It’s yours, Tony,” Steve shakes his head, but the smile on his face leaves no doubt that he already knows what’s inside. “Just do it already, wouldja?”
Steve feels pinpricks in the back of his eyes. “He didn’t. That’s why I--” he lets out a shaky breath, and winds his fingers against Tony’s still ones. “I don’t think he knows how much I need him.”
“I don’t snore, you ass,” he mutters, poking the blond’s side not-so-gently even as his own lips quirk up. “I’m regretting all of this already.”
Steve smiles into Tony’s shoulder, a warm rush of affection running through him. He’s just about to press a kiss to Tony’s skin, though. when the genius opens his mouth and–
She holds his hand between her own. “What else would I care about, hm? Now tell me-- and no lying, please. I can always tell when you’re lying.”
“Some old enemies have returned, and they’re dead set on causin’ trouble in this city. Now, I dunno if you’ve heard of me, or how much you know if you have—”
Through the tears rolling down his face, Tony smiles down at him. “You h-haven’t asked me anything,” he hiccups.
The voice is soft but firm, and is that Brooklyn Tony hears? It should not sound as attractive as it does right now, but trust Tony Stark to get turned on by nothing but a voice, even when kidnapped. He thinks either his face or his body must have made it all obvious, fucking traitors, because look, Red’s smile is all teeth now.
On screen, little Tony nods distractedly, more focused on waving his toy around like an airplane, complete with flying noises.
Tony looks down at their daughter--at the rise and fall of her tiny chest, the pale pink fists clenched at her side, the wisps of blond hair framing her precious face-- and shakes his head. "Never.”
Steve rolls his eyes, but returns the smile. “Please don’t call me that,” he replies, and holds out the container. “But here, I, uh… made you these.”
Steve does as he’s told, but when he catches the faint smile on Rhodey’s face–and on Bucky’s, and everyone else, frankly– he doesn’t feel a single shred of regret.
“But what about the lackeys?” Steve asks her, barely able to hold back the smile. “They’ll be all alone, babydoll.”
“Steve Rogers,” Tony sighs. “If you don’t stop squirming, I swear to god, I will fucking take back that date I promised you.”
“Hiya back, handsome,” Tony hums, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck to keep them close even after their kiss ends. “How was the mission? How’re you?”
“Then you’ll get two,” Steve tells him, and makes a path through the crowd milling around Rockefeller Center towards the food truck parked beside the busy Manhattan streets. Tony tries his best to keep up, and he’s just getting ready to remind Steve he’s behind him, when the blond turns half his chest in Tony’s direction, and takes his hand. “I’ve got you.”
, Tony wants to say, but buries the words as far down as he can reach. “Christmas was her favorite, and she... she went all out-- every fucking cliche in the book. Drove me crazy when I got older, but... it’s still my favorite.”
need to be alone. “So, uhh...” he says softly, the moment the door closes gently behind Pepper. Steve just stares at him. “You know I don’t actually blame you, right?”
She settles into a comfortable hold immediately, every inch of her tiny little body fitting perfectly against his chest. Tony doesn’t fight the urge to press his face to the top of her head, and lets out a sob when he breathes in because she smells
But Steve and Tony go quiet in the way Natasha sometimes sees them get, where the silence settles around them like a bubble they don’t want anyone bursting. One of Tony’s hands is hidden between their bodies and the couch, but the other is wrapped around part of Steve’s bicep, and she’s quick to catch the way his thumb consistently taps at it. She recognizes it for what it is immediately, and clearly Steve does too, because his hands tap their replies just as fast on the small of Tony’s back.
Steve rolls his eyes, but his smile is as gorgeous as ever. “We’ll take care of each other, won’t we?”
“You’re going to find him,” Pepper says, and there isn’t a single shred of doubt in her voice. Tony just nods, riveted by the gentle babbling coming from his arms. He suddenly can’t imagine ever letting go of her– especially now.
He tries to think about it more rationally in the morning. Tony’s never mentioned having a significant other, or even a roommate, but it doesn’t make him feel better. And when he goes through the rest of the day without seeing Tony, only to hear the two voices chatting comfortably again at night, he has to work harder to smother the disappointment bubbling inside.
Tony licks his lips. “Aw, you miss me when I’m gone, handsome?” he looks up at the blond from beneath his lashes. “If you wanted me to be all over you, all you had to do was ask.”
“But I’m-- I’m starving. Kind of, ” he backtracks quickly. “So I guess that’ll do, Toss it over, big guy.” He catches the cup when Steve obeys, and tears it open, wrenching the plastic spoon from the side. It’s just as awful as he remembers, but he forces himself to give Steve a smile of thanks, and when the blond returns it Tony thinks it might’ve all been worth it.
Every time Tony’s over at his apartment, Steve doesn’t bother hiding any of the sketchbooks scattered around the place, and there’s an easel propped up by the window that’s definitely seen its share of use. And it’s the moments that Steve shows him his art that Tony likes the best-- the man’s got talent in
“Especially you, Brock,” Steve says tightly. “Next time you even think about it, you’re gonna have to get through me.”
“I, uh,” he stammers, but then he looks at Tony’s eyes and just like that, some little, tiny part of Steve just knows he’ll never see eyes more beautiful than his.
“Ever hear of inside voices?” Tony mutters, but helps Steve settle them all on the couches. “Jay, pizza status?”
“With my mom?” Tony asks, and god, the word still feels strange in his mouth.  Really, he should’ve known something like this would happen eventually.
“Can I take out my ornaments now?” Steve asks, and even though Tony knows what’s coming, he still shrugs.
Barnes, Sam, and Clint– and Rhodey, too, the bastard– all roar with laughter, and even Natasha lets out a tiny chuckle.
“Yeah, that’s pretty fucking obvious,” he says. “But Stark Industries has a policy about paying ransoms, so—”
There’s the terror, of course, because Steve might be tiny and skinny, but he’s also a spitfire like no one Tony’s ever known; he’s already gotten used to running after the toddler, half out of his mind with dread at the thought of Steve braining himself on every possible surface.
Rhodey buries his face in another cushion. “Fair enough,” he mumbles, then starts when there’s a knock at the door.
Anyway, Tony’s not completely clueless, but he never thought he’d ever come face to face with the guy. Life’s always liked screwing around with Tony, though, and now he’s trying not to shiver from the cold seeping into the chair through his suit. He spares a look at Red— as he’s taken to calling his captor in his mind— and yep, she’s still standing.
“Y’were probably…” he tightens his grip around a fistful of Steve’s shirt. “I didn’t mean to just barge in and interrupt–”
“Yeah. And y'know what? It never stops hurting,” he sighs, and thinks of his mom’s bright smile. “But you get better at breathing. You live twice as hard for them, and you don’t fucking stop.”
“Anything for you,” he says, and when Steve’s lips quirk up into Tony’s favorite smile, Tony knows he believes him.
He ends up missing his alarm, and instead, wakes up half past noon by a loud, irate Pepper shaking him from his sleep. The following hours, therefore, are spent sitting through even more business meetings, with Pepper a cold, unforgiving presence beside him.
A muscle in his jaw jumps out when he grinds his teeth, even as his face and ears flush the most attractive shade of pink Tony’s ever had the pleasure of getting to see.
“Dunno,” Tony shrugs. “Buy a pinball machine? Paint room? Make a mini aquarium? Whatever, go crazy.”
“Y’sure you don’t... want...” he starts, only to trail off when Steve reaches around his neck and pulls out two very familiar bits of metal. “Steve...”
Tony’s eyes narrow dangerously, and Steve feels a thrill run through him. “Pushin’ your luck there, big guy.”
“Oh, I’m definitely not complaining,” Tony shakes his head. “I just really fucking love it when you go all Brooklyn on us.”
” from inside the balloon blob has him sighing forlornly. “I have to do everything myself, don’t I?”
Steve rolls his eyes fondly. “Made it for twenty-five years,” he replies. “What’s a couple of hours, right?”
“Well that’s a relief. Thanks for the help, Avengers!” Steve grins, herding their little group into the kitchen with a victorious smile.
“You did,” Steve nods. “But for your own good, don’t touch anything. Please?” He widens his eyes innocently, even as Tony catches the knowing quirk of his lips.
"It’s not like it’s a lie,” Tony shrugs, “I'll drink to it and everything. But Steve... He's never tried to change me. God knows he deserves someone who's not fucked up--"
Because Steve is sitting right in the middle, wiping his eyes hastily as he turns to face him. They’re big bright and red, even from where Tony’s standing, but it’s the wet tracks rolling down Steve’s face that he can’t look away from.
Tony can’t remember the last time he smiled so hard. He wants to take every single note up there and keep them in his drawer, but no.
“You’re a dork and I love you,” Steve whispers, leaning over the pile of their daughter’s gifts to press a quick kiss to Tony’s lips.
“Funny you should mention surprises,” Steve says casually, and puts on his most innocent look when Tony narrows his eyes, forkful of chocolate chip pancake frozen halfway to his mouth.
“That last time was totally Rhodes’ fault,” Barnes laughs, clapping said boy’s back. “Crazy sunnuva bitch.”
, is all Tony writes, and hopes to God it doesn't sound too eager. He's been trying to figure out a way to ask when they'd see each other again, and now he's more than a little happy at knowing that Steve seems to be just as eager as he is.
Steve rolls his eyes even as smiles, cheeks turning a bright shade of pink that looks delicious on his soft, smooth cheeks. “Come on, Shellhead–”
It’s only when everything’s quiet that Tony realizes he can hear the soft keys of Nocturne No. 2 from the other room, and he almost laughs because of course this would end with Chopin, after everything that’s happened.
“Took me bein’ missing to get her there, huh?” Steve chuckles, before their lips can even meet. His eyes are red-rimmed and wet– not unlike Tony’s, to be honest– but he’s still the most gorgeous man Tony’s ever seen.
“Okay,” Tony breathes. “So, uh… I never thought I’d get to have something like this. Ever. I can’t even remember if there was ever a time when I wanted it. But I remember, uh… I remember looking at myself in the mirror one day– I can’t remember how old I was, y’know– and I remember thinking ‘this is it. It’s just gonna be me, from now on.’ It was easy, and it was clear. I’d pretty much resigned myself to that.”
Well, obviously, that’s a lie. It’s not like he’s never seen a baby before. But it’s almost always been a passing thing– a quick hug and pass, a pat on the head from an excited fan, even a kiss on the cheek if a parent insisted.
“Only Cap gets to do that now,” Tony winks, and laughs at the echo of groans that ripples around the room.
“It started, like, a couple of weeks ago— I can't even remember the day— and it was, I don't know, ass o'clock in the morning or something, and I'm in my room with my kids when I hear Chopin coming from next door and really, who plays Chopin while the sun's still up? So I write a note and stick it on the big door window, y’know, and then he reads it and writes me one back and before you know it, half the door's blue and gold—"
“You changed,” the Captain says, voice soft as it’d been before. It sounds so simple when he says it, like it’s the truth, and Tony would believe him, too, except he’s Tony Stark.
“Sinatra, really?” Tony groans, “I know you know there’s more music out there than your grandpa songs, baby.”
He knows exactly where he is before he even opens his eyes— well, not exactly, because what’s a good kidnapping without loss of consciousness, right? At least they didn’t blindfold him— but it doesn’t take a fucking genius to get from dark, wet and cold to big, empty warehouse. Sure enough, when he blinks, yeah, spot on.
Strong arms wrap themselves around him, and Tony breathes in the scent of clean laundry and maple syrup. “Don’t apologize,” Steve says. “It was sweet of ya to help. And now we know: no whisks during breakfast, right?”
“Fucking SHIELD," Stark mutters, but takes his suit jacket off and throws it on the couch next to Bucky. "Alright, Cap-- up you go."
“You’re still wearing your suit,” Steve mumbles, poking at Tony’s side even as his voice grows fainter. “Nat said y’were working?”
“Mean Papa,” their daughter tuts, cheek pressed comfortably into Tony’s chest. “‘pol’gize, Papa!” she reaches out to poke Steve’s chest.
Steve ducks his head, smiling down at Ellie as she pats his legs with tiny paws, then looks back up at him through ridiculously long eyelashes. “You’re not so bad yourself, y’know...”
“Because I’ve never had anyone look at anything I’ve done like you did today. I... all an artist ever wants is for their art to say something to someone, and if that’s the case here… it’s more than I could’ve ever asked. So I’d like you to have it. I can just–”
“Hey, I can’t blame you,” he says. “It’s not the first time anyone’s been intimidated by my stunning good looks--”
“Impossible man,” Steve shakes his head, but he’s surprised at the fondness he can hear in his own voice.
“Bucky,” the Captain hisses, eyes blazing, and Tony would happily give millions to see how far down that blush goes.
"Hi.” The words falls from his lips like a sigh, soft and shy and so fucking relieved, it's almost pathetic.
Steve shakes his head. “It’s never been about havin’ the best,” he says, and pulls Tony into his chest. “It’s always been just you and me, remember?”
I'm interrupting your regularly scheduled programming to bring you MY DECEMBER CHRISTMAS PROMPTS! I'll be posting 'em all this month becausE CHRISTMAS! lmao things'll go back to normal in January, kay? :D Hope you like them!
“Don’t you dare,” Tony says. “I mean it, you little-- okay, never mind. Do it,” he waves the dog off. “See if I care. I’ll just pay the groomers extra. Again.”
Steve’s voice never wavers as he details out the plan with the team, blue eyes as serious and steady as he’s ever been.
“Oooh, so cold,” Ty winces playfully. “I was hoping you’d be out your little funk by now. It’s getting annoying.”
“You’re disgustingly great with them,” Tony says, and god, the sheer amount of awe he can hear in his own voice is pathetic.
“Like hell I will,” Steve says, despite the butterflies in his stomach. “I just... I wish I could see his face.”
And even with the rain still falling around them, cool and fresh, Tony welcomes the anticipation unfurling in his chest like sunshine.
“Shameless? Yeah, you’ll get used to it,” Tony says, and immediately wishes he could take them back because
“That’s my girl,” Tony sighs, and then smiles when Steve wraps an arm around his waist. “See? She’s okay, babe. And frankly, it was her idea to do this at ass o’clock in the morning so really, she
“Don’t do him too hard, Rogers! This party’s still goin’, and these walls ain’t thick,” Barnes waggles his eyebrows; Tony doesn’t miss the flush that blooms on Steve’s cheeks and disappears down the neck of that god-awful sweater.
“Because you’re gonna need someone to reach the top shelves when we move up to Cambridge in the fall?”
“I don’t doubt it, sunshine,” Tony says, brushing a wayward strand of blond hair from Steve’s forehead. “But just… indulge me, yeah?”
"Fuck," Tony's voice shakes, big brown eyes running over every part of Steve's face like he suddenly can't get enough of him. "You are just..."
"You do," Steve whispers, and then lifts his head from Tony's neck so their eyes meet again. "Always will."
Tony blinks back the stinging in his eyes, and smiles through the wave of fear that runs through him. “Guess there’s no point in putting it off, huh?”
“Well, I think we can all agree this has been great, “Tony says, “but I really have places to go, and people to placate. Here’s my card,” he holds his hand out, and grins when the Captain takes it, fingers brushing softly against his. With a parting wave, he walks toward the door before stopping.
There’s a loud clang from underneath the car Tony’s buried in, and she hears him let out a muffle curse a second later.
He’s just evaded a crowd of them when Barnes’ voice comes in, high and clear and filled with a pain Tony knows he doesn’t have to fake.
Tony has no idea what he’s going to tell Happy or Pepper— Christ, she’s probably halfway to crazy by now— but he thinks he won’t be too upset the next time he gets kidnapped.
don’t get a dog, huh?” Clint asks him, sprawled out on his stomach across the floor and reaching over at Steve’s lap to pet their new addition. “Ooh, can we name it Lucky? C’mere, Lucky,” he coos, “c’mere, boy!”
Steve finally puts down the TV– in the corner, Tony notes happily– and walks over to wrap his arms around Tony and smack a kiss on his cheek. “God, I love you.”
“That’ll be better than anything I’ve had all week, so I’ll take it,” Tony says, thumb rubbing Steve’s bicep absentmindedly, and for all that his touch is whisper-soft, Steve feels it all over his body.
“Bribing ‘em early, huh?” he asks Mr. Rogers-- Steve, is it?-- who responds with a gorgeous grin, thick arms crossed against his deliciously massive chest.
“Now that we’re all friends, though, Cap, I’ve gotta tell you... I’m afraid a simple handshake won’t be enough to really close this thing up,” Tony smirks. Behind the Captain, Bucky’s grin returns full force, and when he bumps shoulders with Red, she only rolls her eyes.
“No,” Steve smirks, even as his stomach gives another loud rumble. His eyes are still soft and hazy from sleep, and Tony relishes the warmth he feels as they meet his own. “I think about you too. Sometimes.”
More often than that, he marvels at how the Biggest Surprise of his life thus far-- being trapped in ice for seventy years, only to be brought back to life in this wild, wonderful chaos of a world--has only brought more and more little surprises with it..
He's still the same guy he's always been-- Tony thanks every deity he doesn't believe in for that one, really, because losing his best friend would've probably killed him-- except all that Sugar and Spice and Everything Nice is now tied up in any red-blooded human’s wet dream.
“Alright, get outta here before I drown in all your sap,” he says, even as he feels his cheeks grow warmer than the coffee in his hands.
“Fury’s just called us in. Sorry,” Natasha shrugs, but doesn’t look all that sorry as she walks to the elevator doors. Barton and Barnes follow behind her, and they just wave and grin when he begs them to stay.
“Bossy bossy,” Tony mumbles, but breaks the seal with surprisingly steady fingers, and when he pulls out the papers inside, he doesn’t have to read beyond the first line to look up with a smile. “Guess who’s going to MIT in the fall?”
“Any chance you’ll be here tomorrow?” Tony asks, and revels in the laughter he can hear rumbling in Steve’s chest. There’s less people on campus now, but even though Tony can see a couple of them turn their heads in confusion, he doesn’t care.
“Sorry,” Steve chuckles, all sleep gone from his mind as he wraps his arms around that warm, familiar waist. “So, you were sayin’?”
“You don’t have to... not right now,” he sighs. “You just got back; you can barely stay on your feet. When’s the last time you slept?”
“No, that was my fault,” the pretty girl sitting in front of them says, right before she holds out her hand to Tony. “Margaret Carter, but call me Peggy, please.”
“She will,” Steve says softly, bumping his shoulders against Tony’s. “She gave me an earful when I told her what happened, but she’s itchin’ to meet ya now.”
“Then what? I can’t imagine you’d need me for anything else. Though for you,” Tony grins mischievously, “I could think of more than a few things.”
Clint groans, and smacks Sam on the arm. “You’re so fucking blind, Jesus Christ, dude! Wilson, tell him he’s blind.”
“Moment ‘f weakness,” Tony pokes his head out, glaring at Steve through half-opened eyes. “You were all... smilin’ and shit.”
“I’d like to see you try,” Steve hums, waving at the other blond as he disappears into the book stacks around them.
“Lucky for you, I’ve got the next best thing,” Tony digs inside his coat and pulls out his phone. “Go nuts.”
Tony makes a faint, curious little sound, and he lifts his head to rest his chin on Steve’s shoulder. Even in the dim light, his eyes are still that perfect shade of brown Steve wants to wrap himself up in.
“Yep,” he replies, trying to shake off the tendrils of uneasy starting to make their way down his spine, “so just... take it easy on ‘em, alright?”
“‘kay,” Tony says, because his head really hurts and he just wants to close his eyes again, and Not-An-Angel is so gorgeous Tony wants to cry. Staying with him sounds like the best idea ever.
“Fine with me, if it gets you smilin’ like that,” Steve whispers. Even in the bustle around them, Tony hears him clear as day.
Prompt: "Write a fic where Steve is homesick and Tony helps him through it? i think Steve would have problems adjusting to the future and i think he would have that sinking feeling in his stomach all the time at first, after they saved the world and everything kinda calmed down and he didn't know what to do with himself. i think Tony would see that and try to take his mind off this. he would try to make him feel less lonely."
He doesn’t go back up until dinner, and by then, he’s so hungry he practically inhales a slice of leftover pizza. It’s not until he registers the unusual silence, that he remembers what he’d set out to do earlier.
“I knew bringing out the big guns’d work,” the soldier mutters, eyes still and dull and never wavering. “Now go hose yourself down, you stink somethin’ fierce.”
He walks the short distance to their daughter’s room, expecting to hear her energetic little chatter as she picks out her clothes for the day. So when he’s greeted with the sight of Bella still lying in bed, covers pulled all the way up until only the tip of her little blond head is showing, he frowns in concern.
“Hi,” he says, and his lips curve up into a smile before he can think to fight it. He can barely keep his eyes open, but Tony’s grin still takes his breath away.
Steve furrows his brow thoughtfully, and the sight is so familiar, that Tony can’t help but press his lips to the side of his little blond head. “Tony?”
“Morning,” he calls out, returning the smiles they both give him in reply. They’re quick to say their goodbyes to the children, and then, by some silent agreement, they both make their way over to Tony’s car.
“I’m sorry too,” Steve stands up, shoulders hunched in trepidation. “Look, I know it might not mean anythin’--”
Steve just lets himself be pulled towards the elevator, smiling as Tony smirks and winks when he passes Clint.
“I said I was sorry,” Steve mumbles, and almost gives Tony a heart attack when he reaches up to brush his fingers against Tony’s cheekbone. “It doesn’t hurt, does it?”
Steve chuckles. “It took me two to convince Bucky that keeping his candy in bed with him wasn’t the smartest idea, so I'd say you had it pretty good last night.”
“Nice of you two to join us,” Rhodey calls out, and sitting beside him, Pepper grins into the mug in her hands.
“Rhodey,” Tony grits, just as Rhodey pulls him into the elevator. “Jay, skip the common floor, take us all the way down–”
“Dis twee is worthy!” Thor deems. Tony’s definitely seen nicer trees, and he’s pretty sure Steve thinks so too, but neither of them say a word as their Captain uncovers the axe they’d brought.
“Who will have her pancakes if she goes back to sleep, at least until the sun comes out,” Steve cuts in, shuffling closer to them so he can wrap his arm around them both.
“Didn’t have any,” Blondie replies. “And the art center’s closed for renovations, so I had a free day.”
“Well forgive me if I’m not Susie-fucking-talks-a-lot when I get snatched off the street. Actually, scratch that, my mouth’s definitely gotten me into trouble through the years— some of it good, if you know what I mean,” he says, winking. “My assistant never hesitates to ream me out, either way, and as hot as she is when she’s angry, I started tuning her out a long time ago. I’m kind of busy getting out of these right now, though, in case you haven’t noticed? Unless that’s why you’re here, in which case I’m going to have to ask you where my driver is, and if you hurt Happy, I’m going to have to kick your ass. Or at least settle for seeing you behind bars for the rest of your life—”
“Okay,” Steve nods, and then calls the bartender over. “I’ll have another, please,” he holds up his empty bottle.
“Yeah, that’s my baby,” Tony sighs. “He’s a fucking handful. If you’re not careful, he’ll end up down here again, so keep the windows shut.”
“Smart guy,” Tony grins. “Now, who should I talk to about taking this home with me? I’m gonna need their number, and yours.”
“Everything,” Steve replies, and even though it hadn’t seemed possible a second earlier, he manages to pull Tony in closer than they already were. “I just...”
Tony looks down at the teammate sitting by his feet, and huffs out a laugh at the sight of a young Clint Barton gnawing on a plastic ID card. He crouches down to pull it away, and the archer relents with a displeased glare. “Hey, none of that,” Tony hums. “Be a good little Barton and we’ll get you a pizza--”
, with a determination that’s almost frantic in its intensity, and Tony reciprocates almost immediately. A faint, distant part of him is aware of their noises they’re suddenly making-- little gasps and deep breaths that would almost be embarrassing, if he ever bothered to give a fuck about any of that-- but then Steve takes one step closer and turns his head
Tony nuzzles into the blond’s arm in lieu of an answer, and feels his smile grow when he feels Steve’s hand find his.
“In your d-dreams,” he can’t help but stutter, though, when Tony fiddles with the hair on his nape of his neck. So Steve leans in to take a not-so-gentle nip at his boyfriend’s neck, soothing it a second later with a wet swipe of his tongue. “Word ‘round town’s that you’re sweet on certain red, white, and blue-clad fella.”
By the time Coulson enters the room with a sleek, red metal briefcase, Tony’s lost count of how many time’s he’s found himself staring unashamedly. Steve’s not much better, to be honest, but their daughter just seems to drink all the attention up happily, even if she doesn’t say anything else about herself.
“Tony,” he breathes, hands trembling around the box, but Tony snatches it away from him before he can say anything else.
Steve, thankfully, immediately holds out the bag furthest from him, and quickly sets the others down to help Tony pour the milk on the bowls.
“You’ll be sorry enough tomorrow morning,” he says gleefully, and shares a grin with Steve over their friends’ heads.
“Oh god, I’m sorry,” Steve whispers into his hair, and even with Howard’s curses still beating at his brain, Tony hears his best friend clear as day.
,” is all he can think, all he can say, softly and gently against Steve’s smiling lips, and when he leans back in to seal the deal with another kiss, the feeling of their hands intertwined fills his chest with pure, incandescent
“I just see pint-sized monsters,” Tony points out, and yelps when Steve jabs him in the stomach. “Hey!”
“Stand back,” is all he has to say, and then Tony has the tiny group gathered at his feet as their future Christmas tree comes tumbling down.
“Not my boyfriend,” Tony raises an eyebrow pointedly, and just like that, Steve feels the rush of heat that’s so familiar when Tony’s involved.
“I’m fine, ‘m just– a little cold,” Steve looks away, and Tony bites back a curse when he remembers the snowstorm that’d started just earlier that day. It’s three days till Christmas, and the city’d been hit with a cold wave not seen in years.
“I didn’t think I’d end up having anything close to this, but just for a little while, I could be free. And y’know… Every time I see your eyes, it’s exactly the same. You make me feel like I can do anything, sweetheart.”
“Uh, I’m sorry,” Tony narrows his eyes, hip cocked out as he leans against the kitchen counter, his body inches away from where Steve is standing. “Did you just
“Did you–” Steve squares his shoulders and lifts his head determinedly, and just like that, Tony can see a soldier preparing for the fray. “Do you like it, then?”
, the man is tall-- to kiss a still ruddy cheek. “See you later, gorgeous,” he whispers, and walks away before he can ask for his number.
Pepper rolls her eyes. "Okay, fine, I'll go first-- I'm a hell of a lot more coherent than you, anyway. Listen, sweetie, we've known it for years."
“Oh fine,” he sighs, and then he’s yelping seconds later, when Steve flips him so that he’s lying across the couch, with a two-hundred pound blond covering him from head to toe.
’d know what that’s like, right?” Rumlow smirks, and Tony’s blood runs cold. “Nobody thinks you’re worth a fuck, y’know. The whole school knows better than to waste their time with you.”
“So, um,” Tony lets out a chuckle as bitter and fucked up as he is, “turns out... turns out dear ol’ dad really doesn’t like being reminded his kid’s smarter than him.” He doesn’t care that the last word comes out as a sob, doesn’t care about anything except the sudden feeling of Steve’s warm, skinny arms around him.
"Who’s your favorite painter?” she asks with a smile, and Bucky suddenly looks eager to hear his answer. That’s a first, Steve thinks.
“Still hung up on High School Musical, huh? But I’m not playing anything from this century yet. Call back in…” Steve looks up at the clock, “about half an hour.”
Tony manages to pull his eyes away from the TV, and makes sure the smile on his face is one of his practiced ones. “No surprise there.”
“You think you’re better than me all of a sudden?” Ty’s face hardens to a sneer. “So quick to be a goody-two-shoes now that the folks are gone?”
Pepper’s voice is soft and low, but in the silence of his living room, it’s loud enough to make him start. Her eyes are barely open-- so are
Steve rolls his eyes, even as his cheeks flush from the mischievous glint in Tony’s. “Somethin’ I can help you with?” he asks, and is relieved when his voice doesn’t come out as breathless as he feels.
... Oh god, Tony," Steve whispers, and when it comes out as a sob, Tony just leans in and kisses him.
“I mean, what does that say about me?” Tony rears back, rising to his feet to pace the length of the couch. “That I can’t even come up with enough people to fill a fucking table, huh?”
“Mhmm, very good morning,” he gasps, when Steve pulls away with one final, wickedly sharp nip at Tony’s bottom lip.
His steps are slow, and more than a little stunted, but he finally comes to a stop in front of the canvas. “Wow,” the word is out before he realizes he’s even said anything, and his hand reaches out to touch the brightest spot in the picture.
“Maybe later,” Tony replies, wasting no time in arranging his body against Steve’s. “I’m still plenty warm...” he purrs, grinning into Steve’s neck as the blond’s shoulders start shaking.
"Okay, we’re gonna have to sit down and actually talk about about this, obviously. But not right now,” Tony says, pressing his lips against Steve’s jaw once, then twice... “Definitely not right now.”
“Cap,” Tony says, and Pepper smiles at the breathlessness in that single syllable. “You should, uh, probably hide the rest of the juice from that guy, yeah?”
everyday, and God, how did Tony miss it? “But don’t ask me more, ‘cause I’m not fucking with the space time continuum for shit.”
The words are soft and warm along Tony’s back, and he’s helpless to deny Steve anything, even now. He’s so gone for him, it’s pathetic.
“Well,” Tony stretches languidly before meeting those bright blue eyes. “You’re also pretty good at reaching the high shelves in the cupboards– I’m pretty sure Clint gets Thor to put all my mugs up there on purpose. Ungrateful bastard.”
“Wouldn’t have you any other way,” Steve leans in to whisper against Tony’s cheek, pressing a kiss to it a second later. “Happy Mother’s Day, Shellhead.”
On the small screen propped up on the headboard inches away, he sees Steve smile softly. “Doesn’t mean I don’t worry about you,” he whispers, and the sound sends a slow rush of warmth through Tony’s body.
The large, cream colored envelope had felt heavy in Tony’s hand. Now it sits, unopened, on the passenger’s seat as he makes the short drive to Steve’s house, but Tony still feels a weight in his chest.
“Don’t be,” Tony says, barely holding on to the giddy laughter threatening to come forth. “It’s cute.
Steve hands it over after a moment of hesitation, and Tony’s heart skips a beat when he finally sees the screen. He recognizes the fond gleam in his own eyes, still faintly blurry from sleep, and his hair is a mass of tousled waves from the wind around them.
“Jarvis.” he points to the cat, now curled up beside a box labeled ‘baking supplies’, “he jumped in from my balcony. I swear he was waiting for me to get home, he does this all the time. Not the, y’know, jumping into windows part-- the other, ruining-your-living-room part. You’re lucky all your shit’s still in boxes, it saved us both a lot of trouble.”
“Meatball,” Tony mutters when he looks up from the note, but he can feel the smile on his face when he gives DUM-E’s claw a pat.
“Oh god,” Steve groans, hands flying up to cover his face. “You noticed? Of course you did, I’m– gosh, I’m sorry.”
“Who are these babies, then?” he says instead, pointing to the puppies scrambling around the edge of the pen.
“A little less hairy, yeah,” Tony shrugs, grinning when Steve laughs, “but not that different, right?”
The camera leaves his mother as she turns it back around, the view a little shaky as she walks down a hall of the New York mansion. “
“Take me home,” Tony says-- he’s not quite begging, but every cell in his body’s sure as hell screaming that he might as well be-- and Steve’s grip finds Tony’s not a moment after, pulling him from the wall and towards the door.
Steve cuts him off with a kiss on his cheek. “No, this isn’t your fault, I could’ve just asked, instead of assuming.”
“I know it won’t be fun,” he says gently. “But it’s for your own good. It won’t take long, and I’ll be right there with you– well, not in there, obviously, I can’t–” he stammers, “because I have to stay in the, uh, observation room next door. But you’ll be fine. I promise.”
kitchen, guys,” he hears, and they both turn to see Clint leaning against the entrance, looking utterly unimpressed.
“Oh Tony,” Steve breathes, and it’s the tears Tony sees in his eyes that finally break him-- again, because Tony will always be the broken one, but
“Bye, Buck!” Steve calls out, an unrepentant grin on his gorgeous face, and Tony almost forgets himself and leans in to kiss it right off. “Tell Fury I’m in good hands!”
Six serious nods later, they’re lined up outside the car, their jackets creating a vibrant rainbow against the dark green trees all around.
“Only have one hand,” Tony says tentatively, breathing a sigh of relief when Steve tugs him closer a second later.
“Just trying to get prepared,” Tony replies, the words coming out a little rough. “I thought you’d appreciate that, Mr. ‘Star-Spangled Man With A Plan’.”
“I love you, baby,” Tony grins. “And now you know better than to listen to anything I say when I’m anything less than half awake.”
“So I’ve heard,” Steve nods, and sits down on the bench Tony’d just been on. Ellie wastes no time in scampering over to him, looking happier than she has all day as the blond pets her gently. “She’s beautiful.”
“Yeah,” the Captain replies, “he did— not that your father was ever fully involved. But he’d lend a hand here or there, every once in a while, and he helped end the feud all those years ago. He helped save the city.”
And Steve’s fucking face isn’t making things easier, with his baby blues almost as bright as his smile.
“She doesn’t need to,” Steve chuckles, and leans over to brush a slow, lazy kiss to his husband’s lips. “But you’re perfect, anyhow.”
“Steeb!” a voice calls from the lumpy mass on the couch, and then a tiny hand peeks out over the edge to hold up a snowman covered cup. “
“And I love you, baby, so damn much. I love your mind– every razor sharp, lightning fast bit of it. And I love your heart. God, it…. it
Steve’s eyes are big and wide and worried, and so fucking blue that Tony almost starts crying again because Jesus, this man is the most beautiful thing Tony’s ever seen and heard and touched and known, and
“Shit, you must be really pissed if you’re going all Brooklyn on me.” Tony groans, but then his lips quirk up in an all too familiar smirk, and damn it, even half alive and bed-ridden, he’s still the most beautiful thing Steve’s ever seen. “Also, I can’t stop thinking about how hot that is, so I blame the morphine--”
He never actually said his name, it could’ve been anyone. He tries not to think about it that day, and the days after that. Tony doesn’t mention it and he doesn’t act any differently than he usually does, so Steve’s pretty sure he doesn’t remember.
Their friends glare pitifully. “Hate y’both,” Rhodey grumbles, but doesn’t pull away when Tony leads him out the door.
But Steve just lifts Tony’s chin until he has no other choice. “Y’know I’m not mad, right?” he asks.
“One. I think. I dunno. Could be more, my PA would know better. She’s hers. Is he--” Tony points to the golden retriever, who, unlike Ellie, is sitting politely beside them.
"One thing," he snarls, and lifts his index finger. "Before I left, I told you to do one thing for me."
Pepper looks down at the cover, and barely manages to keep from rolling her eyes. “Thank you, Daisy. I’m heading out for lunch,” she says, even though both of them know she’s not, “but can you go over right now, please, and tell them-- actually, remind them that I’m the CEO, and next time they want to tell me something, they should do it themselves instead of hiding behind their secretaries’ shoulders, no matter how broad and pretty they are?”
“Don’ wanna,” Tony grumbles, burrowing further into his sleeping bag to chase the warmth he can feel slipping away. “Cuddle me, ‘m cold.”
“Wh-- shut up!” Tony laughs, the warmth in his face now spreading down his neck and under the collar of his messy, threadbare shirt. “And
“Can’t top what I’ve got right here anyhow,” Steve jostles him, and feels his heart skip a beat when Tony rolls his eyes before tucking his face back into Steve’s shoulder.
“If you ruin that suit, we’re leaving the two of you on your own,” Natasha warns them, as she and Rhodey leave the room.
But it seems today’s not their day-- or maybe it is, because really, any moment Tony spends with his baby girl is a good one-- because he sees Steve’s eyes soften, like they always do when their kid’s involved, and then a second later, he hears their daughter’s sweet, whisper soft voice.
There’s a sharp, low sigh that very obviously leaves Maria’s lips, but the camera doesn’t leave baby Tony as she speaks next. “
“Only with you, Shellhead,” Steve winks, and walks the rest of the steps to the next door. “But please remember to play nice in there.”
” comes Barnes’ disgruntled reply, and Pepper can practically see the glare Tony’s surely being treated to.
“Shit, Barnes was right,” Clint mumbles, and the only reason Tony doesn’t turn to glare at him is because Steve starts walking up to him and
“‘S why I love ya, Cap,” Tony grins, and feels his heart skip a beat at the smile he gets in return.
“I can’t just do that, Buck,” he says, and turns away to hide his blush at the thought of Tony’s face if he did.
“And where--” Tony clears his throat to smother the laughter threatening to break through, and works his arms through the sleeves of the coat Steve’s holding out for him. “Where, uh, are they?”
“This ain’t my first rodeo, Pops– we’re a rowdy bunch, the little ones. Besides, I know you and Dad’ll always come for me.”
Steve's fingers tuck Tony's chin up until their eyes meet again. "Another year of bein' with you, for one," he says, a bright, happy smile on his face. "If it's anything like this year's been, I can't wait to start it."
Except his thinking voice is blabbering excitedly about art galleries and commissions, and things that are definitely not in Tony’s mind.
“And to be honest,” Tony leans in closer, lifting a hand to trail it back down Steve's chest. "I wouldn't mind spending some more time with you, Mr. Rogers."
He barely finishes the last word when Tony practically flings himself at Steve, and then their lips are suddenly pressed against each other in one long, chaste kiss.
“Who you callin’ shrimp, huh?” Steve asks loudly, and Tony barely has time to register Barnes’ resigned sigh from a few feet away before his chest is being pelted by tiny, pale hands. “Take it back!”
“Hiya, Shellhead,” Steve slides into the space right next to him. He’s so close that their thighs and shoulders brush against each other, and goddamnit, those baby blues should be illegal.
"Look at them,” he says, and then Pepper looks down at his picture of some of the notes, and... yep, there it is— he sees the moments she gets it.
“Y’can call me Bucky, y’know,” Bucky tells him, and wonders at the way the words come out sounding... shy. He can’t remember the last time he felt anything close to that, but it’s worth it for the gleam of surprise that enters Stark’s eye.
“But I...” Tony bites his lip, and takes a deep breath to gather his courage. “I waited all day to talk to you.”
After that, it becomes sort of a silent rule between the students, that they can look at the notes all they want, but taking them down is off limits. And seeing as Principal Fury hasn’t come in to reprimand them for inappropriate behavior, Tony thinks everyone’s pretty okay with it. Which is great, because the notes keep growing, scattered over the door window in all the gold and blue glory.
“You totally look like a Steve,” Tony says, but wastes no time in settling himself between those already familiar arms. “So, Steve...”
“How ya feelin’, baby?” He looks down, brushing his thumb against Pete’s tiny fingers when his son looks up at him, smile shaky but real.
“Maybe they’re not as good as you think they are,” Tony shoots back, even as he takes another bite a second later. “Goddamn it,” he ends up grumbling in between chews, however. “They’re perfect.
“Well, that probably should not make me as happy as it does,” she replies with a smile, “but you’ll understand if I don’t feel particularly sorry about that.”
“Better believe it, Pops. Now, can one of you do me a solid and bring my suit around? I have no idea how long I’ll be here, but I’m betting it won’t be for long– they probably called you as soon as I went ‘poof’– and there’s no way I’m leaving my baby with any of you, no matter who you are. So pretty please? Uncle Agent!” she calls out, and Tony’s heart makes a pathetically happy little lurch when he realizes she’s talking to
” Steve squeaks, and when the red haired lady sitting on Steve’s other side starts laughing, Tony realizes what he just did.
"I already did.” Steve’s chuckle is more than a little watery, but Tony doesn’t care. “Oh my god, I love you."
He knows Steve sometimes stays an hour or two after class, and when Tony peeks through the door... Yep, there he is, as big and blond and beautiful as the first time Tony ever laid eyes on him.
“Um,” Tony licks his lips, and tries to calm the sudden pounding in his chest. His whole body feels warmer just looking at the blond. “You–” he takes a deep breath, and smiles back. “Hi.”
“Um, hi,” Big, Blond and Beautiful says, and to Tony’s horror, he feels his knees buckle when the man smiles softly.
“Gosh, you’re sweet,” Steve chuckles, and leans in to kiss Tony’s cheek. “Y’know I love wearing 'em, right?”
“Point is, though,” he says a moment later, and pretends he doesn’t hear Steve’s sigh. “I weigh a hell of a lot more than our TV.”
“Language,” Steve tells him, but then he pats Tony’s chest one more time before leaning back against the cushions, and Natasha can’t hide her smile as the genius practically spreads himself out on top of Steve, head resting on the blond’s chest.
"Okay, I get that. Obviously,” he waves a hand in the directions of the magazines. “But Pep, you know... you know how this works.”
of it, I hope," Tony says through his chuckles, and he doesn't care that they both probably look crazy from how hard they’re grinning. "Gotta save some of that fun for the years up ahead."
“Yeah, it was,” Steve replies, and before either of them take one step toward the door, leans over to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “Thank you.”
Pepper laughs again at the excited cheers she can clearly hear him getting in return. “I just need to clear some things over with Cary, but I’ll be right over after that. Give me fifteen, alright?”
“Thank you,” Tony says politely, because Pepper is looking expectantly at him. “And you-- Shaggy,” he calls out to the other man, who glares. “You must be Bucky?”
(He doesn’t like to think of the times he can’t stay-- owning a company doesn’t get any less busy as time goes on, unfortunately-- because Steve’s eyes get big and sad, and then he tries to make Tony feel better, but his smile is thin and brief and
“I hate you so much,” Tony huffs, even as he feels his cheeks grow warm, but before he can reach up to tousle his hair, Steve grabs his wrist and pulls him in.
“Well I won’t have it— any of it. All I want is safety for this city and for my own. But we could use some help on our surveillance and tech front; our stuff’s not as advanced as we’d like, and you’re the best.”
,” he breathes, taking in the red, white and blue picnic blanket laid out on the small patch of grass in front of them, a large basket sitting right in the middle. “You…”
“Y’sure can’t beat the view from here,” Steve says, and Tony’s heart gives a happy lurch when he looks up and realizes Steve’s looking at him.
"Keep goin' and I'll let you know," Steve pulls him in a little more, and this close, Tony can see every sinfully long lash fanned out against the cheek he then presses the next kiss to.
“I know,” is all Tony can say, and lets out a breath when Steve’s hand reaches out towards his own screen.
Steve nods, pushing his Iron Man beanie off his head to ruffle his sweat-matted hair, eyes never leaving Tony’s. “You know my usual at Angie’s, right?”
Tony doesn’t move away from Steve, but he opens one eye in her direction, and as always, it’s enough for her. But then he groans pitifully, and Steve picks up a second mug that Pepper hadn’t noticed before, and holds it up to Tony’s nose.
"Yeah, AIM Academy, those bastards. God, I hate ‘em. Boo, AIM Academy!” He yells out, to no one in particular. “You suck!”
… Ah! There,” Tony looks up with a grin, and holds out his now finished product to Steve’s lips. “Want some, sugar?”
There’s no writing, but Steve smiles at the simply drawn ballerina smack in the middle, bright red bun high on her head.
” begins playing sometime later, he’s so into his work that he only hums the tune at first, but it’s not long before he’s mumbling the words, and then before he knows it, he’s screeching the words out into the empty workshop.
“You’re going to ruin them, Jesus,” Clint groans, but there’s a softness in his eyes as the boys finally settle all the way into the couch, the Captain America plush temporarily forgotten between them as they focus on the little plates set upon their laps. Steve bites the head off his gingerbread cookie with relish, eyes wide and happy as he chews, and at Tony’s ensuing giggles, Natasha feels a long forgotten corner of her heart soften just a little bit.
“This is our grade, Tony,” Steve replies, fluffing up the cushions surrounding their project. “And if you’re gonna share responsibility--”
“Don’t boss me, you’re off duty now,” Tony points out, but carefully climbs over Steve to lie down next to him anyway.
“I’m pretty sure you’d fall on your ass if you tried to walk,” Steve answers, “no matter how good you think you feel. It’s a safety precaution, Tony.”
“Hey, look.” Hammer’s grin is cruel when he spots Tony, “it’s the little orphan.” There’s a ripple of laughter from his stupid little clique, but Tony rolls his eyes, ignoring the deep pang of grief his heart gives at the reminder. It’s been seven months, but it hurts enough to make him wonder if the pain will ever fade.
Steve’s eyes glimmer with determination when they move up to meet his again. “I’ll try my damnedest not to.”
“But... guys, Tony’s not—“ he pauses and takes a breath, any explanation dying in his throat against the excited gleam in everyone’s eyes. “Why do you guys want to do that, hm?”
“It’s Tony, beautiful, but you can call me that too,” Tony winks, and finally gets what he was hoping for as Steve doubles over, tiny shoulders shaking with the force of his laughter.
Steve nods, and moves around the kitchen island until they’re standing side by side. “You’re, um… okay with this?” he asks, and it comes out quiet and unsure, as hesitant as he always feels when it comes to Tony Stark.
The locker rooms are a mess of hollers and laughter when Tony slips in hours later. Coach Lensherr gives him an exasperated look but doesn’t stop him, and it’s only a few moments later that Tony finds Steve standing by his locker, freshly showered and stuffing the last of his things into a duffle bag.
Instead of the panic that Steve thinks he should be feeling, he sighs, dropping his pencil atop the sketchbook in his lap. “What is it now?”
“Of course, Captain,” the doctor replies with a friendly, sympathetic smile. “But he will have to remain here for the next two or three days.”
“Stop it, you asshole,” Tony grins, but Steve just starts running his fingers down Tony’s sides. “I said--
