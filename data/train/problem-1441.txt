“I’ve got the luck of a certain
Sherlock moved forward in a manner that put John in mind of a panther slinking toward wounded prey. This wasn’t the first time John felt like a gutted gazelle around his ward.
“To see your face right now! I doubt I need your answer--shall I ring him up?”
“I’m sorry,” Brother Vincent whispered. “I never meant--”
Sherlock took it all in, tried to to tune it all out with the constant bouncing of his knee. Irene noticed, laid her hand there to still him. It didn’t stop his bounce or his nerves.
“Ah,” John drawled, and he shook his head in silent amusement as he took a sip. “Well, I’m glad for it. Even if you’re a bloody awful driver.”
Sherlock, naturally, didn’t say anything. John turned his head to face Sherlock.
A squat, far-side of middle-aged woman named Connie** shuffled over to their table and offered them a weathered but bright smile. “What can I get y’all tonight?”
“You’re going to need to talk to Mycroft. We’ll need to move as quickly when we can when we touch down.”
Sherlock fought down a wave of anger, at himself and the absurdity of the situation. He was Sherlock Holmes, thank you very much. He was more than the bloody spot in his eye or the embarrassment that radiated off him in waves.
It was with that thought running rampant in his head that he finally reached the stables. He found John currying a dappled Appaloosa, its shoulders a soft grey that faded to white across its ribs and flanks, speckled with matching grey spots like a dalmation.
“Filippa, I’ve got him--how many--?”
“Did you speak with Liliane?” Brother Vincent asked.
“So you’re one’a dem fancy guards, then?” the ringleader cried. “Bet they didn’t train you in anything useful, did they?”
“Bianca? We need extraction.”
Whatever Lestrade saw in that moment was enough to make him lose some of the measured control he’d exerted so far. With a growl, he plunged his free hand into his pants, fishing himself free of that last cotton barrier.
John slid the aforementioned bottle of booze from his knapsack--indeed, it wasn’t just any pilfered grog, but the bottle of Macallan 12 his sister kept hidden in her closet. She’d already gone back to the city for Uni, but as luck would have it, she’d forgotten to take it with her. John unscrewed the lid and put the bottle to his lips. He gave Sherlock a waggle of his eyebrows, and took a pull.
But then they climbed into the limousine, sheltered from the wind and embraced by the heated interior. In its dimly lit privacy, Jim stretched on the plush bench seat opposite him. “Come to Daddy,” he murmured.
Sherlock can feel himself getting close. So damn close. He wants to tear his hair out in frustration.
John felt bad--he had worried, in the back of his mind, about how bored Sherlock might be if he came to visit him during the summer. Aldershot wasn’t nearly the bustling metropolis Sherlock was accustomed to, having spent much of the past few years living in London with his mum. It had taken a full week, but here he was on day three of a full strop. Even John’s parents had begun to notice.
She pushed her trousers down past her arse, widening her stance as best she could to accommodate.
Jim’s fingers snaked through Sherlock’s hair; Sherlock tensed, ready for the pull, but it never came. “Make your way to the guest bedroom, pet. Just around the corner. I’ll be there in a moment.”
“I was sleeping. What did you want?”
So Sherlock
The remainder of May slipped through Sherlock’s fingers like loose, dry beach sand. The murders stopped and worse, so did the investigation despite Sherlock’s best efforts. With no new leads, no new evidence, Sherlock was left with a puzzle that still had too few pieces.
“Sir--please, please watch me? I love getting to show off for you, sir.”
She frowned, her movements halted.
Sherlock, however. He kept his eyes downcast, his body curled inward like a kicked dog.
Another second and his hearing came back online in time. Officers screaming into their comms, “Suspect down! Shots fired!” Pandemonium erupted as the amassed crowd scattered, their shrieks echoing from the shop-fronts.
“What brings you here tonight, Brother Cassiline?” the acolyte asked, a woman maybe ten years older than him, with kind eyes and the sort of serene smile he’d always envied in Elua’s priests and priestesses.
But rather than explain himself, he darted forward, cupping Sherlock, who fought and lost to not go rigid at Jim’s touch, which burned like a brand against Sherlock’s most sensitive places.
6.) Method #33: Only One Method
He retrieved the text, which read,
excited about it. But, bear with me a bit longer?”
“This what you needed?” John asked, his smile brighter than the sun. How one person could shift from dark and sexy to playful and sweet and back so seamlessly left Sherlock breathless and starry-eyed.
Sherlock struggles to undo the doublet, and John has to help him. Sherlock can feel John stroke the nap of the fabric once he’s done with the zipper.
“What then, d’you do this to all the inspectors? Some sort of Met-slag?”
Sherlock, in his daze, lifted the gun in his hand as they pelted down the hallway. “I have  a gun, I can--”
Sherlock temporized. There
It almost seemed like Wilkerson was as resigned to this as Sherlock was.
? Ooh, I
“You all right, Sherlock? Milk hasn’t gone off again, has it?”
Sherlock rose from where he squatted. He threw an annoyed glance to John, who stood in parade rest on the periphery, eyes averted in a way they hadn’t been for Sebastian Wilkes’s corpse.
“Which Houses does he frequent?” Sherlock asked.
The thought brought a smile to Sherlock’s face, one he hoped wasn’t too predatory, considering Mrs. Hudson was now talking about tea sandwiches.
Sherlock closed his eyes, crushed the note in his fist. If he swore to bind himself to Jim, he had a chance to escape, to find some desperate way to prevent the bombing, the assassination.
John lifted his gaze, turned to find Emile and another hotel worker exiting the lift and headed toward them--but pushing some sort of contraption. When Emile saw him, the daft man offered him a too-large grin, a knowing waggle of the brows.
“Not--not blackmail,” he stuttered. “Not blackmail.”
“I can’t say the feeling is mutual,” Sherlock groaned. “Especially with this completely unprofessional harassment.” Even still, Sherlock was surprised to find his words weren’t nearly as barbed as he’d assumed they’d be. Perhaps it was the prospect of his
John loosed a small growl and fell back a step. Sherlock was sure he was glaring daggers as sharp as the ones at his sides, right between Sherlock’s shoulder blades.
"I." Sherlock blinked rapidly, unsure how to quantify the fluttering in his chest. He was thrilled and terrified in equal measure. Moreso than the old poem he'd read ten years before, moreso than the knowing smirk of a Kusheline priestess, this felt like the visceral connection to a thing bigger than himself that Sherlock had not yet realised he missed.
He holstered his gun and sped after her, catching her just as she got it open, tackling her to the slick cement.
Not that he was overly distracted by the female form--it was the utter poise and brazen choice of nudity that unnerved him.
“That’s most certainly a terrible idea,” Sherlock said, and John could tell he was only half-joking.
Heart in his throat, all too aware of the blazing point of contact where Sherlock’s knee brushed his, John nodded.
He grit his teeth and shut his eyes. This was the second bloody tunnel in twenty-four hours. At least this time he wasn’t beset by who-knew-how-many enemies and putting his body between an attacker and Sherlock.
John glanced to him. “Do you want to eat first, or get it over with?”
Sherlock frowned and snagged his teacup from the table. Its contents were over-sweet and entirely cold, but it was the motion more than anything that he craved. “Tension?”
With that overly cryptic message she looked to his mother.
At each spot, Sherlock would shake his head, torn between the relief of his freedom and the ever-urgent need to address his still-straining cock, slick as it was with precome from everything Helen had done to him thus far.
But hearing it--that Sherlock wasn’t prepared for. Heart hammering against his chest, yes, breath rapidly matching Lestrade’s: he had anticipated these things. He had not, however, counted on his body actually responding to the stimuli. It had never done so at the behest of another person; the way desire flooded his system at that predatory little noise made his head swim, made his vision go red.
Sherlock pushed his hips up and away from the edge of the bed, his breath ragged. His shoulders screamed with the strain of their angle, his ribs nearly bruised within the confines of the corset.
Connie wink-blinked at him again as she tipped the carafe over his mug. Then her voice dropped to conspiratorial levels. “I hope y’don’t think I’m bein’ rude, but I’s wonderin’ if you’n that other fella were here... t’gether, y’know? If yer not, I don’t mean any disrespect, just... I know you’re outta-towners. Ya gotta be careful ‘bout that around here.” Her brows drew together. “No offense.”
"We were meant to be sleeping," Sherlock chided, but his tone betrayed how far he was from enforcing that agreement.
# # # # #
“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve thought of taking you in my mouth,” Sherlock confessed. “Of kissing you, of fucking you, of having you--”
“Your call, darling. Though I’ll admit, I’ll miss you terribly. Best customer I’ve ever had.” Ames couldn’t hide the fondness that suffused his jibing. Then a mock-wistful tone coloured his next words: “I knew our time would come to an end eventually.”
“I’m not teasing about this, I swear. I’ve been at it all week, sure, and partly to get a rise out of you. But I’m not joking right now. And if I’m overstepping my bounds, I’m sorry. But..erm. Yeah.” His smile twitched just a little pulling downward just enough to morph into something self-deprecating.
He’d only just started loading the dinner plates onto the worktop by the sink when the back stairs gave way to a telltale creak. Jim had entered, and the way his lips twitched in a smile looked more like a python’s satisfied countenance as it circled its prey.
As much as his pleasure had been Naamah’s blessing, so too was it Kushiel’s.
For what? For Sherlock to waffle like a child, half-hoping John might stay, might abandon his duties to--to what? Pretend at some sort of domestic bliss?
Amelia’s suite was nearly a flat unto itself. It was all wide open space and a flowing decor, comprised of a main sitting room and two separate bedrooms. The ambient light of Knight’s Court’s attractions streamed in through the expansive windows overlooking Hyde Park, limning the suite’s shadows in an enigmatic glow.
The interior of the coat was a red so deep, the only thing Sherlock could compare it to was blood-at-night.
“Shh, I’ve got you, you can, Sherlock. You can, and you are. I’ve got you.”
John smiled softly, his chin propped on his fist. Sherlock never opened up about his childhood--John had only a few bare images to assign, all gleaned from Mycroft. But tonight found Sherlock in a surprisingly open and talkative mood. He could truly picture a young Sherlock, the deduction his father’s affair still ringing in the air above the otherwise silent dinner table. Poor kid, John thought.
Sally wrinkles her nose at his bad habit, but says nothing about it. “He’s determinedly not sulking. What’d you do?”
And when Jean-Julien caught his eye? When he knew, he
So, that final line is almost a direct pull from
His stomach lurched and John squeezed his hand around his fist, absolutely unwilling to indulge in his first, most base instinct. It would prove he was too weak, too unsteady for Cassiel’s service. He refused to lose this one thing he could cling to. He
When he got to that same spot, John nearly cursed: the width of the filing cabinet drawers on the desk, combined with the space for the desk chair, made the opening much smaller than comfortable. Helen, petite as she was, could’ve easily fit through it, but he was somewhat bigger. He crouched and slid through, leaning back to contort his shoulders and head away from the drawers, the gap of which was so narrow he had to keep his head turned to the side. Unfortunately, this meant he had to grip that part of the desk, which shifted just the slightest bit, throwing off his balance. He bumped, just barely, into the stack of books and froze, watched them wobble precariously. Even the slightest noise--let alone the calamity of heavy books crashing, which would invariably topple against the stack of boxes on the other side, sending them over like dominoes--would have bollixed the whole thing.
So Greg was... DS Lestrade?
The broken groan he received told him exactly what he needed to know.
The boundary-pushing was one thing in the privacy of their flat, but this was a bit not good, and he made sure John knew as much before he relented.
--and shouted, “Sherlock down!”
1.) For the translated conversation, please see
Irene had said, less than twenty-four hours later.
He hadn’t come to his decision to enter servanthood lightly. Jean-Julien had been his heart, Elua knew. But with time came numbness and the very real truth that Frédérique’s family was desperate for money. His family had moved to the U.S. when Frédérique entered l'université, and shortly before graduation, Frédérique’s father was diagnosed with cancer.
Sherlock’s couldn't help the low moan that escaped. Once Victor’s cock sprang free, Sherlock gladly set to the
John was glad, after the chase through Regent’s Park, that he’d had the opportunity to warm up. He hadn’t been as thrilled about bolting out of the house in ratty kit, but it couldn’t be helped. He managed to tackle the guy and toss Sherlock a cheeky wink before the Yarders arrived. He counted it an even draw.
"It suits. Let's get on with it."

“Sherlock, what’s--” John started, but broke off to glare at him as a couple of middle-aged divorcees on vacation squeezed past them, forcing them back against the wall.
“What do we do now?” His mother turned back to Sister Roberts, wringing her hands, stroking her thumb against the opposite palm.
“It’s called the

The warm press of humid August, the weight of Sherlock’s hand in his--these are enough to push away that unimaginable pain.
Sherlock’s body was the worst sort of war zone--equal parts horror and temptation that would rip him to shreds. He wished he could just die.
“Are you injured?”
rather have a chat with us, hm?”
Out in the hallway, John still stood by the door, his posture stiff and his mouth settled in to a firm, disappointed line. He refused to meet Sherlock’s eye, though a tell-tale redness that blossomed on the tips of his ears and neck told Sherlock either he was fully aware and embarrassed of all that had passed, or else he was furious about it. With John, it was likely both.
But then Sherlock swam forward beneath the shadow of the dock, less than a foot away from him. John’s heart kicked up to triple-time against his ribcage, the air suddenly too thick with humidity to breathe. He tried to look anywhere but straight ahead, but Sherlock’s face was so close it demanded his attention, those eyes just catching a reflection of the light off the water, the rest of his face a work in shadow-on-shadow. John gulped in a breath.

hard. They fought bitterly in that terrible place between lovers and acquaintances, unsure of how to move forward. By the end of the night, though, Elua illuminated their path.
“Sherlock, we’ve got to go. We’ve got to move.”
Otherwise? Happy first day of

When he stuck out his hand to seal the deal, Ms. Adler’s grip was firm, unyielding. “Call me Irene.”
is coming. He means to take you away.”
John grinned. “I need a recording of that.”
Sherlock’s eyes crinkled and when he kissed John again, and John could taste his smile.
Unraveling Moriarty’s new scheme would mean going back into Naamah’s service, of that Sherlock was fairly certain. He’d do it now under his own power, on his own terms, but that would be the only way to tease out the leads he’d need to stop whatever Moriarty was planning next.
Emile laughed at that, and it dealt Sherlock’s heart a great measure of warmth to know that John was able now to joke about that horrible day, the return from La Poveglia.
“What would you like as your reward?” His words dripped from his lips, poisoned honey. He nudged Sherlock’s chest, tipping him to topple on the bed.
“I don’t need to belabour all this and cry on some therapist’s sofa,” Sherlock said, words sharp and cold. He pushed up from the table.
aspect was fascinating, actually. John had never seen someone who threw themselves so wholeheartedly into whatever it was they focused on. Not the way Sherlock did. This was fine when it came to inexplicably dismantling the toaster (until Sherlock went on a tangent about the eroticism of electricity play). The taunting was unbearable when it came to simpler things, like when in the middle of a yoga routine Sherlock broke concentration just long enough to wink at John.
A little piece of the puzzle that was John Watson, Cassiline priest and protector, threatened to slot into place, just beyond Sherlock’s grasp.
Sherlock couldn’t help but let loose a huff of breath as she circled back round to face him.
Sherlock shook his hand free and swung the door open.
In the end, it wasn’t nearly long enough. No amount of time would ever be long enough, not to prepare for the way Jim sucked all the air from any room he entered.
Mycroft’s eyes shuttered momentarily--Sherlock counted his dig as a win. Then Mycroft sighed softly, sparing a glance for John, who stood stock-still in Cassiline pose by the door.
“And Sister Roberts was certain of your--”
Jim grunted at Sherlock’s answer, shoving him a little harder forward. “If I wanted a vague answer I would’ve asked a vague question, pet.” When Sherlock stumbled and dropped to his knee, Jim took hold of his hair, wrenching his head to look up at Jim. There was no harshness to Jim’s tone or expression. All that cruelty, kept in check with a smile. “How. Long?”
And then every last sensation drew from the periphery to his centre, pooled in his groin. His feet slipped as they pressed to find purchase, the stilettos unable to find a grip on the hardwood floor. His thighs and abdomen strained to press harder, to rock faster between Sally and the mattress. Orgasm loomed near, and all without ever having been penetrated, without once having his own cock touched by anything other than the bed.
Ah, John’s mentor then. Likely the man John had written to, in order to beg for re-assignment. Now obviously apologising for not having done as John asked.
At that point, John couldn’t make himself care about the music anymore--he needed Sherlock
Dear Lord, was he a parrot now?
When this is all said and done, I think I
Lestrade held up a hand, shaking his hand. “No, it’s not--you thought it was a servant of Naamah?”
The Sussex property, though its borders were within five miles of the coast, was large enough it hosted a modestly-sized working sheep and fruit farm. The main house was at least twice the size Irene’s Belgravian townhome, a Tudor affair many might find charming, but Sherlock found just shy of dreadful. It was well-maintained, yes, but it was too far a departure from the comforts of his childhood home or the modern buzz of London and the domestic familiarity of Baker Street. It was too old, too cold, too foreign.
His mouth pulled into a hard slash, his guard raised for whatever volleys she might throw this time.
Sherlock asked, scarce able to breathe. Was it too much to hope they were still alive?
, Moriarty wouldn’t do this, would he?
Sherlock gave him a dubious eyebrow raise before taking another swig of cherry Coke. He slid two of the unused creamer packs across the table toward him, and lined them up before balancing a third atop them. “First, I’ve heard that this is how one goes about friendly conversation. I’m not averse to hearing your take on the matter--you’re a good storyteller, John.”
“Whatever for? She’s there with you, isn’t she?”
Another torturous drag against his prostate. “Who treats you better, whore? Who knows what you need?”
When they arrived, a soft-faced acolyte offered him dinner. Sherlock was surprised to find that he actually
Dianne leaned forward, cupped his jaw in her hand. “Your devotion is stunning. I pray we all find that someday, what you have.” She leaned in and pressed her lips gently to his cheekbone, and John fought the urge to jerk back. “If anything goes wrong, I swear to you on any oath you choose. My brother or I will call for you immediately.”
“If Naamah wills it,” Sherlock replied, laying the flirtation heavy in his voice to obscure the second meaning from his words.
he thought.
Sally frowns. “That’s it?”
Sherlock’s footsteps must have been too noisy in his haste to escape, because the man called out to him.
I know this is a great set-up for more to come, and very much mirrors the final few scenes of the book with this, but as of right now I have zero plan of continuing this universe. If someone wants to pick up from here, please feel free to do so--and let me know so I can read along, too! :D
Two years. Holy cow.
Then came the phrase Sherlock didn’t realise he still dreaded: “All right, Sherlock, are you ready? Can you take this little plug for me?”
Sherlock stood, forced himself into stony neutrality. If he could just fortify his exterior enough to keep all the destruction inside… he’d be able to do this.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock turned a smile on her, cruel and cold. “Absolutely none of your concern, Detective Sergeant. Run along while I talk some sense into your superior--”
“In the end, he came back home, and they worked things out. But it took quite a while for things to feel somewhat normal again. I don’t think Mycroft ever really forgave him, or me for saying it all aloud,” Sherlock surmised. This was sometime later, when the conversation had veered into territory it had never done before.
was an old Siovale custom, something of a sacred trust in Siovalese families. The first half wasn’t familiar--which was of note. Mycroft swore by it without hesitation. It must’ve been frequent and carried some sort of draw. For a millisecond Sherlock thought maybe it’d been a slip-up, but this was Mycroft Holmes, whose entire value lay in his ability to remain a steel trap. The oath itself was the
“Well, he was a very bad man, wasn’t he?” John bit out before stifling something that was definitely
Luckily Sherlock caught that thread and finished, “--research trip. John’s researching for a story he’s writing.”
“You realise your evidence is inadmissible, Sherlock.” Lestrade started, scrubbing a hand over his face. “You broke into her sodding hotel room.”
# # # # #
Sherlock’s knees nearly buckled. He couldn’t help but buck forward into Jim’s hand.
But the private blinked at him, smiled politely, and then continued to stare forward at the mirror.
Helen Belfours all but ran, making a steady beat for the basement, and staying on her tail, undetected, took all of his concentration. He had not been trained in stealth the way Sherlock had. His power resided in bold action. He knew, though, that he could not act until he knew for sure that Helen did what he anticipated. He could not act without true cause.
Sherlock had no idea what to make of that, only that it had something to do with Midwinter Solstice; John hadn’t behaved that way in many months. Did he object to Jim in a way he didn’t with Sherlock’s other patrons? Or was it simply that he’d “come to his senses” in the hours leading to Elua’s vigil, and he’d remembered all that Cassiline priggishness he’d worn on his sleeve in those early days? That would be enough to saddle John with that dreadful resignation, Sherlock thought.
The murders had all been done in revenge. That much he knew already; a desperate grasp at a return to normalcy. But knowing Amelia Chamberlain had gone to such lengths to not only seek her own, but provide it for others--that took a certain brand of courage that John couldn’t wholly overwrite with adherence to the law or an appeal to morality.
please
Sherlock nodded. He’d have been a fool not to take the antibiotic.
When Sherlock unlatched from John’s shoulder, he squeezed him once before pulling back. “Hold that thought.”
“Have you met my attendant?” Moriarty asked. He gestured over John’s shoulder.
"I'm wide awake."
Jim stepped close, his palm a flaming brand as it hovered over the bared skin of Sherlock’s back, over the still-raw
“Sherlock.” Lestrade’s voice was sterner now. “Just accept it, mate. You can’t outdo us at our job every time.”
“Why in the world?” Sherlock asked, remembering one of the first things Emile ever said to him. “
When Sherlock does finally make an appearance, an hour later, the party’s in full-swing. Greg--dressed (for God knows what reason) as a “sexy cop”--and Mike--who’s come as Cupid--have gone from leading a game of bobbing for apples to bobbing for beer-bottles. Other classmates mingle or dance in the small clear area in the front room, and John’s holding court in the kitchen with some story or another from the last rugby game.
Silence sat wedged between them as John took a stool at the island and Mrs. Wilkerson busied herself by filling the kettle, fiddling with cups and teapot, strainer and loose-leaf tea. John halfheartedly hoped she’d start cleaning something, or reading something on her phone, anything other than talk to him. He wanted to listen out for signs of trouble, not make what was sure to be very strained conversation. But the kitchen was spotless and she appeared to have zero desire to whip out her mobile.
John knew, then, what he must do. This was his fate: to choose, and choose again. There was no way of knowing which was the correct path. One led him to stay by Sherlock's side, to abandon Cassiel and court damnation. The other was Cassiel's path, cold and stony.
“You all right, there?” An unfamiliar note of concern coloured John’s question.
“All he said was ‘Chamberlain,’” Sherlock said.
Sherlock’s eyes dropped to the floor. He couldn’t look at what had been done to them. He was afraid to hear whatever they had to say, but he couldn’t deny he knew French--all servants of Naamah were taught, if they did not already grow up bilingual. He was here because he was meant to know, and all knowledge was worth having, even when the telling and the hearing were a heavy burden.
John glanced over to Sherlock, who was still studying his menu with wolfish fervor.
Another short John chapter, but! But! The pace is picking up. There's even a tentative full chapter count! So much moving and shaking is about to come your way.
“Thanks to me, you did. Whoever this woman is, she has attempted to frame you.”
He’d just--they’d just--
Well, he knows the answer to that one, at least. This is one of the few parties marking the dwindling time between himself and heading off to the army at the end of the school-year. He has to make this year count.
“Not at all.”
And then the cold swipe of the alcohol swab over Sherlock’s cock, the mind-blotting burn of the chemical against his delicate skin. Sherlock let out a ragged, pained moan, his fists jerking against their restraints. And, despite it all, his body wanted more, even of this.
John had expressed his worries, once, early on in their romantic relationship, about being able to provide Sherlock with the full spectrum of what Sherlock needed. John may never be the whips and chains type, but Sherlock knew better even then, than to assume John wouldn’t find ways to meet him in the middle.
It was another form of love.
: Romani/Tsingano in this universe for “pretty-boy” (
He pressed his lips to the centre of her pubic mound, right amidst the patch of hair, a wet little kiss as he let the point of his tongue flick along the top of her opening. He shifted, trailing kisses to frame her mound as he worked up the courage to delve lower along the smooth skin of her labia. The scent of her tangled his brain in knots, and he knew he worked with Naamah’s blessing.
Sherlock cut the call before his brother could say anything else.
After respective showers and pyjamas, John found himself standing at Sherlock’s door, hand poised to knock.
Sherlock thought of the gifted PIN card, which had been converted to cash and put into his bank account, a modest thousand which had gone largely to procuring Mr. Ames's time and dedication to designing the marque in the first place.
was a Sherlock only he saw, someone vulnerable who needed him, wholly unlike the heavy-lidded seducer who followed Naamah's calling or the hard, spiky man who walked through life with head held high.
More than that, though, Sherlock found himself seeking comfort in his memories. Frequently they turned to Irene’s affectionate barbs, Mrs. Hudson’s motherly doting. The quiet satisfaction of earning one of John’s smiles.
Captain Watson, did he? He filed that one for later, and turned his attention back to the private.
The guilty look vanished from John’s face, replaced by that stony curtain. “Leave it alone, Sherlock. Just go back to bed. Or to your violin. Good night.”
he typed,
This back-and-forth, keeping his tone and body language neutral though his thoughts raced in opposite directions—for both John and Jim at once—was enough to leave him breathless and confused. Still, he managed. Even with Jim’s back to him, Sherlock didn’t doubt he was still under close scrutiny.
Sherlock fought the urge to twitch against the syrupy sweet tone and pet name--it had been fine in-scene, but now it was embarrassing. He was glad he couldn’t see Wilkerson’s face.
The lift’s bell sounded before Sherlock could make his conclusion. The porter led them to Jim’s door, gave it a firm knock, and left with a silent nod.
Sherlock felt his eyebrows raise. If this prat was about to flap on about his precious commissions as an excuse for a subpar design, or to assume Sherlock would be besotted with whatever they threw at him, it wouldn't work.
What should Sherlock care about Helen’s employer?
It wasn’t until Jim released him, stepped back, that Sherlock took in his own costume: a mask of rainbow-black feathers, a slick suit embellished here and there with opals that gleamed like the feathers of a cormorant.
She’d been walking home alone from a friend’s. It had been her night off. She didn’t think to keep her guard up once she’d gotten back to Knightsbridge. He’d grabbed her before she could scream, had carried her away.
social event of the year on the D’Angeline calendar: traditionally, it marked the new year and was a brilliant night of masqueraded revelry for D’Angelines. Among the Houses, it meant a night where Servants of Naamah were free to choose their partners without the intricacies of House politics or involvement. For the elite it was a night for networking, solidifying ties in the upcoming year. As a member of both circles, if Sherlock couldn’t spend it in the company of the one patron whose attention Sherlock sought above all others, he was minded to simply forego the whole affair.
Brother Vincent’s voice, the ghost of a hundred memories, reminded him.
Apollinaire’s wide hand cradled Sherlock’s jaw. “You need to eat, rehydrate.”
“Why did you bring me here?” John asked, letting every ounce of his exhaustion bleed through.
The gears in his mind, which had been ticking forward in lieu of equations and chemicals, halted. Ground into reverse, seeking a new avenue.
# # # # #
The way Sherlock held himself, upright and stiff, gaze fixed forward, somehow reminded John of Harry. Of how she faked strength in front of their extended family after their parents died. That crook at John’s neck pulled hard, made him fight the urge to grasp Sherlock by the shoulders, to wrestle the prat into a hug, to comfort and protect.
Just beyond him, within him, steel rang against steel like the memory of so many hours in the temple. A calm, stern voice whispered only,
Sherlock paused, only too aware of what his current position hid. After all, he'd been pleasantly abuzz, just waiting for the first marks from the tattoo gun. He prayed his blush wasn't too obvious.
“I’d wondered.” Sherlock let out a shaky breath, dark and sinful. “Part of me was hoping you’d hear me.”
While Sherlock had been to the lush floral gardens of Elua’s temple on many occasions, and the libraries of Shemhazai’s a few times as well, he had never been to Kushiel’s temple, and couldn’t begin to guess what awaited.
Sherlock thought of Lestrade then, the way he’d been gentle even at his roughest, compared to Victor. It had been good, so good, but--
This is how it always starts, isn’t it?
John wondered if he was still dreaming when the faint scent of apples drifted around his room. Against the backs of his eyelids John saw the kind face of Anael cupping a sprouting seed in his hands.
John blushed, thankful for the cover of the dock. Of course Sherlock would find that game childish, moronic. John could almost hear him saying,
Lestrade nodded. “Right. What about the cuts and bruises? Did a proper Mandrake adept get jealous?”
When she decked him hard enough to cut his cheek, Sherlock
John’s dark blue eyes flashed bright, then, and he crossed his arms. “I won’t be foresworn for your--your--”
“Do you want to lie down?” John whispered, gesturing at the blanket and the roses. “Did I guess correctly?”
anywhere.”
John smirks, licks his lips. “Yeah? How’s that?”
Still, he didn’t have to make the process easy. “I don’t want my
John swallowed, covered Sherlock’s hand and squeezed. “I do what I can. Sometimes you even make it easy.”
In counterpoint to Victor’s rough treatment only minutes before, he let the silence between them stretch taut before stretching out to trail his fingertips along the outline of Sherlock’s musculature, the soft lines at bicep and tricep, the curve of his rib and the crease of where arse met thigh. Everywhere his fingertips touched tingled slight and sweet, until Sherlock was fighting not to lean into it, to coax it toward the places he needed to be touched, to neck and nipples and abdomen. Victor stood close, radiating body heat against Sherlock as he reached around to sweep both hands down Sherlock’s spine, his hips just far enough away that Sherlock couldn’t so much as accidentally brush his erection against Victor.
Something brilliant red caught his eye: at first it was an unintelligible blur, but as his vision cleared the image only made somewhat more sense. Deep scarlet like the mote in his eye, eight petals, one for each Companion.
He waited for some sort of admonishment--"For Elua's sake, put on something decent, would you?"--but it never came. John always bore his teasing in silence, and that morning was no exception.
The crowd murmured at the prospect of a birthday gift, of a delay in their merriment, but all Sherlock could think of was the coiled anger, the danger in the creature he’d spotted at the back of the room--and now that man was moving forward? Was this the patron Irene had intended for him to go home with tonight?
, you know?
Victor murmured a soft, "Fuck,” anddribbled precome slick and salty.
“What?”
Sherlock smiled at that.
Throughout all of it, Sherlock could only blink and take in the world around him, a calm having settled inside him like he’d never known.
John snorted, shaking his head. “Failed to mention that one. Can’t imagine why.”
he'd found his prostate; in response that same part of Sherlock ached in jealousy, begging to be teased.
“Kushiel’s Dart,” Jim mused. “How fitting, for you to meet one of Kushiel’s line, then?”
Another voice let out a laugh, and when Sherlock and John turned they saw three men emerging from the shadows. The ringleader was taller than Sherlock and twice as wide, all muscle.
“I’m sorry--Daddy,” Sherlock mumbled, and he made no effort to hide the confusion in his voice.
An eyebrow raised then, and a rueful, predatory smile twisted Lestrade’s mouth. He lifted a hand, traced fingertips along Sherlock’s hamstring, to the curve of bare arse. “Sherlock Holmes?”
She took the intrusion unperturbed. “You love him. Plain as the nose on your face,
Brother Vincent, who sat on a bench nearby, sighed audibly. “Calm down, John. These things are standard. Your SIG has seen far more action than any other brother or sister’s gun in Elua knows how long. There
“You wanna fuck this? Come take it.” John instructs.
Jim drew the door open. He offered no smile, but studied Sherlock instead, dark eyes scraping along Sherlock’s skin. After so long, wanting and waiting, this moment had finally come, and with it, a bewildering new landscape. They were no longer acquaintances, united by Irene, but servant and patron. Sherlock’s actions were bound only by Jim’s wishes, and finally nothing stood in the way of that.
But his words are cut off, drawn into a keen as John picks up his pace, thrusting ruthlessly, and if Sherlock didn’t already know better, he’d be completely oblivious to the savage smile he knows John is wearing.
“Why do you do this to yourself?” John's gaze had not left the window, his words clipped. He sounded the way Mycroft used to, when he'd come home from school bloody-nosed and black-eyed.
“Another invitation?” he asked, already bored with it and glancing back down to his poetry.
At this last marker, Sherlock did begin to feel a burn, weak and distant, building somewhere in the middle of his length. The rod itself had warmed to his body heat, still slick with lube; the odd sensation being its stiffness, the way it pressed his flesh open and kept it there. It didn’t take long for him to realise it wasn’t actually a burning sensation at all, just the newness of feeling a part of his body he’d never been aware of before.
“Will you teach me?” Sherlock asked, and it wasn’t acting that made his voice tremble in his throat. He couldn’t meet Lestrade’s eyes.
“Down,” Victor growled, shoving Sherlock between the shoulderblades again until his elbows buckled and his cheek pressed against the leather inkblotter. “I want you over the fucking barrel--”
“You should consider your options--you’re close to it. Will you still serve as Irene’s eyes and ears, or have you had enough of her little spy games? Maybe you’ll go into your detective work.” Jim’s words held a taunt, the hint of condescension one uses on a child. “It took you long enough to figure Amelia out. Was it your soft spot for Victor?”
“I protect and serve,” John ground back. “Let me do my job.”
John cleared his throat.
Not a prayer. A benediction.
Sherlock is a size queen. He can’t help it.
Jim rose from the table, smiling apologetically as he did. “That’s likely the sort of thinking that’s given them reason to attack our embassies, don’t you think? What more could they want, than to give France a reason to withdraw its presence?” He let his gaze linger on the guest who’d made the faux pas before addressing the table altogether. “If you’ll excuse me a moment--”
Sherlock leaned forward, letting his chest, warm and solid, brush across John's shoulder as he reached for the teapot.  "May I?"
By the time they left Ames’s office, the night owls had gone to roost, and the early-risers were beginning their day. Only a few hours shy of dawn, and London began another cycle of its bloom. Several blocks away from a Tube station and taxis in short supply, they resigned themselves to the long walk to get to either.
Whether Mycroft believed that or not, his attempts at tracking Sherlock down were likely hampered by Jim’s craftiness. He struck Sherlock as the sort of man who would not be found if he did not wish to be. Sherlock and the others had been tucked away so remotely, rescue hadn’t occurred for them in a year and it was unlikely to come just because he’d joined their number.
And then it registered, a boulder right in his consciousness.

“Out with it.”
After Liu took their orders, John broke the silence first.
into this story. (I may also post the next "John" chapter today, depends on how life happens. No promises tho.)
“Quite a birthday party, isn’t it?” Mike asked, to which Sherlock couldn’t help but offer a curt smile. But then he collected himself, playing the overly submissive creature once more.
He fumbled to undo his belt, ripped it free from his pants, before wrapping it as best he could around her wrists. He could only hope that Mandrake training didn’t include slipping free from the sort of restraints it they might use on their patrons.
an adept.”
“How long has Daddy made you wait?” Jim’s voice--Sherlock hated the purring dip and melody of it, the way it at once coddled and condescended. It intoxicated him.
“None of that.”
John was more than impressed. He fought not to grin.
Sherlock nodded. "I hypothesised months ago that you'd applied for reassignment and been turned down."
“I need you to wait out here until I text you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John took it as permission. He let his hand trail upward, and when his fingers edged beneath the thin cotton of Sherlock’s shirt, Sherlock let out a harsh breath through his nose; John’s skin was burning up, a brand that Sherlock would gladly wear the rest of his days if he could. Reflexively, Sherlock jolted, his nose bumping John’s.
, Sherlock thought distantly as the darkness closed in. It was the first time he’d ever heard anything raw, anything true in Jim Moriarty’s voice, and it was as terrible as it was honest.
Then John made the mistake of looking at Sherlock’s face: usually, every expression Sherlock wore felt fake, calculated to beguile or empower or enrage, depending on what he needed to do to goad people. But then there were moments like these: moments where that facade slipped, and the bunch of his shoulders, the way his face relaxed and those strange eyes instantly shed ten years. Moments like this, where for some inexplicable reason he seemed to want to take John to dinner, for no other reason than to enjoy his company.
“Hush now,” Moriarty snapped. His lips drew back in a snarl and his reptilian eyes flashed in the dying sunlight. “It’s Daddy’s turn to talk. You’re going to keep your little vigil, and you’re going to be thankful.
“Then what difference does it make?”
Only a few of them knew of Sherlock’s true nature, his status as an
It took everything in Sherlock’s willpower not to charge her, to raise his voice above the harried whisper they all shared. “The power is out. It’s sodding January. Those guards are ready to kill. What makes you think those two prisoners are going to survive? We can’t leave them.”
Of course, of
He could see some movement, but it was the soft slither of cloth that told him what would come next: Victor slipped the belt free from his robe and wrapped it over Sherlock’s eyes, knotting it tight.
“I--I don’t understand-- You meant for this to happen. Is this why you called me a parting gift?”
For all that his predilections were tamer that morning, Sherlock's remaining time with Victor was no less enjoyable.
“Tracking down these vandals,” Sherlock says, straightening his posture. “Thank you for catching them.”
He thrust up into the ring of his fingers, thumb darting to swirl leaking precome across his glans, foreskin sliding along his shaft with each push.
, and Sherlock’s ears rang with it.
But then his attacker rose again, knife in hand, and slashed out at his midsection.
When Sherlock dared to glance back up at Amelia--who’d gone pale and a bit rigid with displeasure--he noticed her eyes. Warm brown, a familiar shape, hardened with anger. In that moment he knew three things:
When Lestrade pushed him back against the bed and stripped him down, Sherlock had no idea what he was in for. He watched as Lestrade undid his own button-down, peeled off the vest beneath, shucked trousers. All Sherlock could see was skin, glorious skin dusted with hair and glowing in lamplight. Years of furtive, ineffectual wanks to the bounty of the internet was nothing compared to an actual live person, ready to give him whatever he was willing to take.
but then he paused, backspacing the last word, thinking again of John’s complaint. The man was on-call twenty-four hours a day. Should Sherlock leave him out of it, or offer to wait until morning?
They’d butted heads so much since Irene took him on, engaged in silent games of observation and will. Irene hadn’t been a teacher so much as a mentor, though Sherlock had never told her.
“Whooo!” a feminine voice cheered, and when Sherlock pulled back, Sister Molly and an elderly Cassiline woman were grinning from a second-storey window. The elderly woman winked at them, and Sherlock couldn’t possibly fathom why.
The shop was a far cry from the last tattoo parlour Sherlock had visited, which had been for a case. Where that one had been covered from floor to ceiling with garish band posters and framed vintage B-movie stills and furnished with mismatched furniture in a dizzying array of neon animal prints, Irene’s tattooist worked in a clean, well-lit studio, done in cool colours with sleek furniture in the waiting room. Music, upbeat and unrecognisable, played over the speakers, but it didn’t hide the drone of the tattoo gun.
“Well?” She snapped. “Are you going to sit there all day, or do you wish to give your signale?”
“Touch me, freak.” Sally’s breath came out in a gust. “I want your fingers inside me while I fuck your mouth.”
John went rigid there at the counter. He could easily guess who they were talking about. If there was one assignation he did
An hour later, the slot in the door opened, and the voice said,
“Sending a message,” John murmured, his voice small and detached.

been murdered.”
“We need the files of a servant--one who came in roughly three weeks ago.”
Maybe Amelia or her husband was embezzling in order to pay him off. Had the Chamberlains been doing poorly
Molly raises an eyebrow and glances down. She pulls the soda bottle away from him. “Is that so?”
Sherlock’s skin flushed, his vision ran red. Kushiel’s bronze drums thundered in the distance. It took another minute before his mobile drew him from his reverie.
Billy races ahead of them, weaving between groups of children with sacks full-to-bursting with candy, pointing out the destroyed decorations. Sherlock glances back at Sally before darting off after.
But Lestrade held off, withdrawing, and Sherlock whined at the loss.
Sally rolls her eyes good-naturedly. “Typical. Where’s the punch?”
“That’s not what I want, pet--”
Sherlock wanted to kick himself. The dinner crowd was much heavier than the speedy service he was accustomed to later at night. All around them customers jostled, brushing elbows and chair-backs.
After the last of the plates had been cleared and a simple sweet digestif had been served, Jim finally turned his gaze to Sherlock, bidding him to finish. Sherlock put away the violin and approached the table. As long as he’d waited for this, time slowed to a crawl now, each detail demanding his notice.
Ames chuckled and swatted at Sherlock’s arse as he pulled the needle away for probably the tenth time in the session.
“To what do I owe the pleasure, Mr. Holmes?” All traces of Ames’s usual levity were gone, his words dry and brittle. “You could’ve waited til morning to make an appointment. You know I’d make room for you.”
He will find Sherlock, who is probably either still sulking by the punch bowl or else pissing someone off with his deductions, and John will apologise even though he doesn’t feel particularly sorry. It’s still better than being in a strop all night.
That night, Sherlock lay tangled in his sheets, desperately listing the periodic table backwards in an effort to bore himself to sleep. From Ununoctium to Lanthanum, he could only replay his encounter in the kitchen. From Barium to Yttrium, it was the way Jim’s scent filled his head, and Strontium to Scandium was that melodic voice tipping downward in an inflection so sinful Naamah herself would blush. By Aluminum, the only thing he could think of was the heat that came off Jim, nearly chest to chest as they’d been.
But John doesn’t mind. Beautiful, accommodating John who understands that it isn’t his lack, merely Sherlock’s need getting the better of him. And John can tell when these times come, but damn him he still makes Sherlock beg for it.
By the time he was fully transformed, he’d fallen so deep into subspace that he felt almost disconnected from reality, gliding along, until at last Dianne de Fhirze slipped back to check on him.
Sherlock spoke, breaking John’s niggling panic. “Naamah’s gifts come in many forms. Pain is an aspect of it in my experience, and I won’t deny that I enjoy that. But this… It’s different. You are a gift.”
, this pupil of yours. I hear he’s quite the rising star, no?”
“Nonsense. It’s only half-six, and I’m sure Irene has already done without us. My treat.”
John closed his eyes and drew in a deep breath. He sat torn between the desire to stand posted outside Sherlock’s door to be sure all was well or to sit there in the kitchen and retreat into his own mobile, content to block out Mrs. Wilkerson and anything he might overhear.
There'll be a bit of
grandson. He spoke of his visions to save her life, and she traveled to the ends of the earth to free him from an angry old sea god. Whenever she had the chance, she defended the Romani people, and some vowed to always speak her name at the crossroads. That’s the legend, anyway. I can’t say I’ve ever believed any of it, but it’s a story that’s stayed in my family for longer than I care to ask about.”
But he caught himself, only with the sure knowledge that John would be unbearable if he won their wager only an hour into the test.
As soon as he was once more physically able, John relinquished his hold, swiping his hand on the interior of his training shorts before beating a hasty, silent retreat back up to his own room. Once safe within his bedroom, he immediately set to work cleaning himself off--and forming a plan.
A male voice floated above him, muddled and only barely comprehensible. A cold, gloved hand settled on his shoulder.
“You’re making this up,” John grated. His heart thumped harder. Was his devotion and admiration really so base and sinful as that?
Sherlock had figured out his prize, dumb as it was, after a whole week of struggling. He couldn’t ask for what he really wanted, so the best he could manage was to ask John for something simple, like his most embarrassing adolescent story or somesuch. It followed the rules of truth or dare; surely it would not appear to be the cop-out it was.
Once she’d slid down the length of his body, she drew her fingertips along the length of his cock, and Sherlock was certain that even that would be enough to make him come.
His breath hitched, the tipping point. He fought and failed to prevent the tears that spilled of their own volition as steel rang in his ears, a crash that drowned out his pulse. He thought then of his dreams, standing ever at a crossroad, unsure of the way forward. This--it was all leading to this moment, wasn’t it?
“I don’t think this is going to work, Sherlock.” John draws in a long breath through his nose, swallowing hard to work against the knot forming in his throat. Beyond the car, the waning moon does little to illuminate the heath over which their road winds.
But what was this, exactly? John hadn’t ever met any of Sherlock’s other patrons--how was he to know if Jim Moriarty was any different from the rest of the poncy bastards? Was guarding Sherlock on any other assignation easier, simply from not knowing?
“These too? Is this okay?” Sherlock asked, and while it was still the same sought permission as before, it held a playful note in reserve.
After a moment, Apollinaire let loose a meditative hum. “Is it true--Irene Adler sends you to your patrons to gather information like some spy?”
He willed himself to move ever faster until the racket in his head give way to muscle memory.
Helen accepted the brush when he kneeled before her, but made no move to maneuver either of them into position. Instead she said simply, “Before I reward you,” and here she waggled the hairbrush, “you must prove how much you want it. I know you don’t favor women, as a general rule. Show me how eager you are for your punishment.”
“You’re Sherlock Holmes?” the assistant asked, taking his coat.
, he thought, but aloud he only said, “Not likely.”
It was clear she could read as much in his body language: in the jut of his jaw, the stiffness of his upper body.
“Sorry I kept you up all night, John,” Sherlock offered, his shoulder brushing John’s.
“What a lovely surprise,” a man in a charcoal suit and simple black domino drawled, his voice somewhat heavy from drink. “I’d recognise that half-done
John tensed and spun to face Sherlock, his eyes raking him over. “Are you all right? Did she--” He was coiled again, ready for a fight. “Did she ignore your
Sherlock’s gasp gave him away, and he hated being so transparent to Jim. It only drove that humiliation home.
“I. Protect. And Serve,” John growled, his aim unwavering.

“Sherlock, let me in. It’s freezing out here,” John grumbled from the sidewalk before gently nudging Sherlock forward from the threshold. When he stepped in he let out a hiss. “Bollocks, did the power go out?”
. It was unthinkable to disrespect even a servant of one of
It was the guard who’d brought Sherlock his food, who’d sat sentinel at the table while the others gave Sherlock their stories.
Even from Sherlock’s supine position, his eyes closed, he could hear the smile in Mr. Ames’s voice. He suppressed the urge to snap,
No artifice then, no dithering dance toward the goal.
Then he dropped his hands to Sherlock’s waist, spinning him around to face the crowd he so desperately needed to study. And thanks to their height difference, this was a blessing on many levels: John Watson, truth be told,
Then the heat of Wilkerson’s body pressed along his side, that voice in his ear again like something soft and clinical and warm and strange: “Do you feel that, Sherlock? Do you feel what seeing you like this has done to me?”
Worse, was the way Elua tapped at John’s heart whenever he thought of Sherlock at other times: sleep-softened or languid and glowing in the aftermath of an assignation, or shining and razor-sharp with deductions for Lestrade. The pensive, unguarded man who’d thrown open a door one night was the one John held closest to his heart, gave him a reason to protect and serve. The lullaby still echoed in the corners of his memory.
Sherlock stood in his parents’ run-down little greenhouse, over a tray of spoiled meat he’d nicked from the fridge, administering dropper-fuls of drain cleaner to the old pork cutlets, lost in the stench and the flourishes of a Puccini opera blaring from his little stereo. If one asked, he’d almost embarrassed to admit it now, but at the the age of fifteen, Puccini was his most obvious indulgence in sentimentality.
Jim’s snakelike stare slithered across Sherlock’s skin and up to his eyes. "Elua's balls, Irene. You've found yourself an
the femoral--the
Victor released his hair, and then strong hands gripped Sherlock’s shoulders and pushed him to his knees. Sherlock's hands strayed to Victor's hips, both for balance and to let his cheek brush against Victor's cock, which had begun to tent the silk robe in a rather distracting way.
Her refusals were polite at first. She had been taught the art in demurral as well as pride, after all, and it was an especial skill to turn down a client while having them think it flattery.
From the helm, Felippa whipped out her own, firing at the other boat’s driver. Just before they closed in on the closest canal into Lido she caught the man between the eyes, and his boat--and the remaining guard--went careening into a docked gondola with a devastating crash.
Back in his own room, Sherlock’s phone had gone off as well.
Oh my gosh--I was sitting here faffing about with some other notes on this story, and I realised that this month, July 2016, marks the
John wondered.
His nerves rattled through him then, shaking his hands and churning his stomach. From a thousand miles away, John murmured into his mobile.
Sherlock stood speechless. The diamonds sewn into the gauze would be enough to make his
Liu, the sixteen-year-old daughter of the owner, bit her lip in thought. “Let me see.” She held up one finger as she turned to wind her way through the restaurant in search of her mother, Hwei-ru.
“It’s a done deal, Sherlock.” Lestrade insisted. Then his voice softened just a fraction. “I know you have your reasons for wanting him to be innocent.” He huffed a breath, but continued before Sherlock could interject. “As much as you don’t like to admit it, Naamah’s servants always have a soft spot for their patrons. It’s likely the only reason you’re marginally nicer to me than you are to anyone else here. But you can’t ignore the facts. We all miss things.”
Sally stepped into the office and handed Lestrade the file. “There’s no ties to Victor Trevor on this one--”
She helped Sherlock clean and bandage his cuts, more for precaution than anything; if Sherlock moved with more stiffness than usual, it could only be said the night had been long and rewarding. He dressed in the suit he’d worn there and followed the woman out and to the dining room.
respected. Well, the first time. Its use is consensually muddled the second time.
It might be better to let Moriarty think he’d outsmarted John. If given a confrontation, John had no doubt Moriarty would find some way to come back full force. He wasn’t sure if his involvement in Amelia Chamberlain’s arrest was entirely altruistic; what if John caused Moriarty to do something ruinous to Sherlock or anyone else in
“Elua forgive me,” she whispered.
John frowned, glanced back at Brother Vincent. His mentor’s head was dipped, salt-and-pepper hair barely visible in the shadow of the eaves. A long gust of breath escaped Brother Vincent, the weight of his transgression bourne on steam in the night air.
Because now? Now he knows, fully and unavoidably, how much he loves Sherlock; how much, to his surprise, Sherlock seems to return the sentiment unstinting. But each time in the past three months he’s let himself think on it, a cold, hateful little voice in his conscience whispers,
Without a warning knock, the lock on his door rolled back, clicking into place, and the door swung in. It was Luca.
The spirit burned, ice and mint as it slid down his throat, and for a moment the lights shone brighter. After being wound up as he had, Sherlock couldn’t help but make a little noise of pleasure.
. It meant more to him than anything--more than his intelligence or pride, the consolation he took from his deductions in the face of his friendless childhood and adolescence. More than discovering he was an anguisset, more than a thousand moments with patrons for whom he’d always hold some small affection.
“You’re a Cassiline, yeah?”
coffers.”
“Your mobile rang off its hook this morning,” she said. “I brought it out here and silenced it.”
Jim leaned back, his nose a hair's breadth away. He planted a chaste, soft kiss at the corner of Sherlock's mouth. "Soon, then."
Sherlock nodded and frowned, watching as Emile rose from his chair and exited toward the foyer. A moment later he returned, a large, flat box wrapped in brown paper in hand. A low thrum echoed in Sherlock’s head, in his nerves.
doing here?”
The other on-duty officers had retreated until only the stirred dust in the hastily-erected industrial lights and the distant whisper of rain remained with them and John. The smell wasn’t terribly strong, as far as these things go. The body hadn’t had a chance yet to decompose.
there was something perverse with you lot.” His words drawled in a tease, one that held the barb of a threat.
“Tomorrow, late lunch. I’ll be there by breakfast, and we three can go in together.”
“What’s this?” Jim asked. “Does the Cassiline normally come along to
Sherlock had told him once, months ago, that he loved each of his patrons, just a little. Would he understand that the same had happened to John, but unlike the fractions of Sherlock’s heart each person might keep, Sherlock held the entirety of John’s damned heart on a silver platter?
“Brother,” Mycroft said, surprisingly warm. “Enjoying Paris?”
If Sherlock had expected the kiss to be harried or messy for all that John was a dam broken, he’d not tangled with John “three Continents” Watson, and John would prove it. He nibbled and sucked, sliding his tongue along the lower edge of that gorgeous bottom lip, and when Sherlock parted for him, he invaded without quarter and gave no mercy. The heat from the fire, the scratch of the lace beneath his fingers as his hand rounded the curve of Sherlock’s arse, it made him dizzy with it, until at last he pulled back, breaking the kiss.
“I have in the past few days, and yes, I hear Daniel will be in town soon.” Jim’s tone was entirely put off, cool and detached, and some part of Sherlock wondered if he only entertained this conversation to further Sherlock’s humiliation. Surely he
Sherlock’s expression hardened and his pace quickened. “Madeline D’Arbos’s murder and Smith’s assassination were merely an opening gambit. Whoever wanted that message sent to Madame D’Arbos didn’t wait for Smith to talk.”
Moriarty even thought to leave a small, ornate cushion in black and gold jacquard for John to kneel upon. This detail only served to push the idea that this treatment was an overt sign of hospitality Moriarty could claim ignorance to--left to their own devices, Cassilines used no such niceties in Elua’s temple. They knelt on the hard, frozen earth. The pain was reckoned a small sacrifice to pay in Elua’s honour.
The bleeding had stopped sometime before, and the cuts were shallow enough that it left only the lines afterward; they would heal clean. His fingertip left a burning trail in their wake, and Sherlock closed his eyes, sinking into it, rather than linger on the sting of Jim’s slight.
was enough to supply one’s fill of D’Angeline intrigue for a year. Small talk, John could handle. It wasn’t as if he’d have to engage, exactly--he usually just hovered on the perimeter as a wall decoration, a subtle status symbol to put the hostess above her guests. But listening to some of the stories a group of Naamah’s servants and other notables would tell about their--

threatening me.”
Sherlock did as he was told. His reflection in the free-standing mirror in the corner caught his eye, and he gave himself an appraising stare as he slipped free from his carefully-tailored suit. Pale skin, his body on the lean side of athletic, the curves and angles of him soft-sculpted. Not a single mark on his skin. There were certain Houses whose canons were so specific, they even called for a certain number of freckles, but this was not so for him. The only canon he followed was Kushiel’s, and it was this blessing in the blood--or a curse, Emile had called it--that Jim Moriarty wanted him for. He had never been more thankful for the mark in his iris, to have been named an
“--Like I said!” Sherlock interjected.
and my favorite...
Of all the things John had ever guessed for his life, being held in place beneath Sherlock Holmes, bodies working together to chase a high John had never willingly sought before, was never one of them. But here he was, and it was right. With his free hand he gripped at Sherlock’s sweat-slick shoulder, slid up to grasp the back of Sherlock’s neck.
Halfway up the stairs from his bedroom, Sherlock’s playing finally resolved itself into something familiar: it was an old nursery rhyme-song.
Sherlock let out a noise, jerked against his restraints. Wilkerson had only coached him into serenity to take it away, to mix him up once more. He felt the cold press of the plug against his urethra, breaching the first little bit. He sucked in a breath and his body went rigid, sure of the painful stretch to come. But it didn’t, even after the plug slid in a little further.
Sleep was impossible, anyhow. Between the hamster wheel he found his thoughts running on and the anticipation of an assignation on the following day, it was nearly impossible to slow down enough to drift off.
“Submission isn’t the only thing I am capable of, but it’s one of the finer… selling points.”
Weeks passed, and they prepared to travel to Sherlock’s inherited property down in Sussex.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock hissed as they made their way up the steps of the estate’s facade.
"I--yes. Yes."

As the sedatives wore off, intelligent thought slowly crept back in, sank its tendrils into every part of him.
given in protest, claimed as a victory. It didn’t stop for quite a while, not until Kushiel in his mercy granted him reprieve and Sherlock knew no more.
Sherlock thought.
“This--you had them killed.”
She let out another sob.
“Oh, I’m sure we’ll be headed back to the hotel soon. But I’ll have a bit more coffee, I think.”
“Very nicely indeed,” she repeated. Then, gathering her wits about her once more, she straightened up, flashed him a devastating smile. “Ready?”
“He wants us to leave him with something to show the guards. He needs to explain how we got away,” Felippa answered.
It had been a blessing, during that time, to rediscover one another, to learn how they had each grown. Each had their faults, and thankfully age and distance had made them easy to spot, easier to assess. They truly believed that with enough faith, enough love, they could overcome any of them.
“Just be careful of sunburn,” she called after them playfully as they set off.
, a bit of
When John speaks, he hopes to god he hasn’t misread all of this. But, he temporises, if he has he’s surrounded by water. He could just drown himself. Even still, his voice is softer, more unsure than he would’ve hoped. “Looks like you won the race.”
Sherlock leaned in, planted a chaste kiss at the top of John’s sternum, barred from bare skin by thin cotton.
John cleared his throat, furrowed his brow. He felt himself slide into his old role like a jacket he took out of the closet maybe once a season--it still fit, even if it wasn’t quite in style anymore. “Now Private, we’re going to have this talk, or you’ll find yourself court-martialed, and trust me when I say you’d
Sherlock stopped himself before the train of his thoughts jumped tracks, gave away Irene’s intelligence-gathering. Financial hardship for the Chamberlains, but they had money to burn via Victor Trevor?
How long had Sherlock wanted this exact moment?
This extracted a laugh from Sherlock, who felt it in his stiff muscles. “Greatly exaggerated, I assure you.”
In a new message window addressed to John, Sherlock typed,
Jim Moriarty.
John stumbled forward until he stood at Elua’s statue. He laid his palm against the freezing marble rendering of Elua’s robed shin. Brother Vincent stayed back, and if John trusted his gut, he had the inkling that Brother Vincent had brought John to the sanctuary to prevent a blazing row.
help, if only minimally. Crawling backwards to escape the door was somewhat less difficult than it had been before.
“My grandmother stuck to the old Roma ways,” Emile said as if this were explanation enough. “She used to say meeting one of you was good luck. Whatever you need--if it’s in my power, the answer is yes.”
John’s squared jaw and narrowed eyes were just short of a proper glare, but then he relented. “So this isn’t any sort of apology for your behavior. Good. Glad to get that cleared up.”
always cover the spine, and sometimes a large portion of the back. They are
That was a fair assumption, Sherlock noted. Many freshly-sworn servants came knocking on her door, desperate to learn from and repeat her success. But even now in her thirties, Ms. Adler had yet to accept a student--her time was her own to command.
“This is--”
The police hadn’t been any help. Of course they hadn’t. It hadn’t happened on House property, so it didn’t count in
But John, still calm, shook his head. “We have to stay and sort this out with the authorities. He pulled a gun on us, so I was within my vows.” But now the the steel in his voice was gone, replaced by a waiver Sherlock barely caught. Whether it was at the act he’d just committed or the prospect of facing authorities, Sherlock wasn’t sure.
I should have the next chapter up in the next day or so--I already have 2/3 of it drafted, so look for that, hopefully by Wednesday.
“She told me a very good man would offer the price of my marque as a patron-gift, if only I did something she was certain I wouldn’t mind doing.” Cecily’s hands shook, and she couldn’t continue. She fought to breathe correctly, and the staccato rhythm of it made Sherlock want to hide, hide for a million years--and the rest of her story slotted into his own understanding of the case.
“I want you out.
Finally John responds sotto voce, unable to give voice to everything in his middle. “I know I don’t deserve you, Sherlock--”
But then he rounded a corner, nearly fell trying to stop.
John shrugs, and Greg’s mutt jumps off the bed to greet her.
Then she curled a hand around the back of his neck, and pulled him forward into a loose-lipped kiss.
Above him, Wilkerson only sighed, unimpressed.
Dianne frowned for a moment, a neat little crease between her brows, but she nodded. “He is. It is well within his contract, I swear.”
The nude body also offered callouses on her palms and feet. The uneven cant to her hips, even bent as she was, suggested scoliosis or wearing a lopsided belt--utility, most likely. The tattoo on her hip--a group of deep violet flowers shaped like stars--made him almost certain.
In Sherlock’s mind, the sensation was too familiar, too dirty to be anything he should enjoy. And yet, and
Once the on-site coroner carefully rolled the remains of the victim onto its stomach, a swathe of skin and tissue over his spine had been brutally carved away. Detritus clung to the exposed muscle. The edges of skin curled away from the wound, bloated and discoloured as the rest of the victim. Even the muscle had been blanched by the water until every last ounce of exposed flesh was cast in the disturbing white-grey tones of a ghost.
John.
The first blossom of heat spread across his cheeks. When he’d taken instruction in any form of dance, he’d always worn the sort of drab training clothes he did when practicing tumbling or boxing, or any of the other physical endeavors to hone body and mind. This was the first time another human had seen him in this get-up, and he felt more than a little ridiculous in it.
Sherlock offered his hand, giving them his best act. Victor snorted derisively, though Cara and Mike both made appreciative noises at Sherlock’s display. The way husband and wife looked at Irene indicated they’d both likely been her clients, which made no sense. They were both too--too common, honestly, to meet Irene’s exhorbitant fees.
Then John’s grip loosened, and his hand drifted slowly upward along Sherlock’s hamstring and curved to ghost up over his hip. “If you want me to stop, tell me. I won’t even count it if you say it out loud. You’ll win the game by forfeit, I swear.”
On his other side Apollinaire laughed quietly. “You are a wonder. It’s no surprise that patrons fight over you!”
.”John paused to look up into his eyes. “They’ve likely got some of their men posted at the docks. Swear to me you’ll take the others and follow Felippa if anything happens to me.”
A blue-robed attendant greeted him with a chaste kiss of greeting, little more than a brush of lips, dry and soft against his own.
Instead he hummed. “Why didn’t you turn Amelia in yourself? Or are you a cat, leaving a dead bird on my stoop?”
John smiled, something soft pressing against the inside of his sternum. “I didn’t disappoint too terribly, I hope.”
“Happily.” Sherlock drew a deep breath, finding himself on surer ground.
“Sherlock!” Amelia’s tone was genuinely pleased as she leaned up to kiss his cheek right there in the foyer. “I’ve had half a mind to contract you myself since Irene first introduced me to her pupil. I’m quite glad Jim has done the job for me.”
Humiliation seasoned his desire, deepening it from something novel and sweet into a thing savory enough to sustain Sherlock.
Sherlock hummed in thought, scanning the room.
“That depends on how generous you are with the ink,” Sherlock replied, then  frowned. Had he really just
In the stillness, the silence of Jim’s inner sanctum, Sherlock’s breath caught and stuttered as Jim detached the lead.
His timing couldn’t have been more perfect if Elua himself had shoved him on his way. Although he couldn’t see him in the centre of the thick crowd, he heard Sherlock cry out,  “Jim Moriarty!”
John thought.
It smelled of John, and of home.
Deep down, a small part of him was proud he’d given his first female orgasm, even if it was only the much easier external variety. Just knowing he could get this far made him want to see this thing through, to exceed both Helen’s and Irene’s expectations until he’d brought his patron to her much-coveted bone-deep orgasm several times.
Sherlock’s stomach dropped completely. He’d seen this sort of thing, of course--collar play was fairly common in Valerian and Mandrake, and a well-known kink to the world at large. In the privacy of the Knight Court, it would be sublime, but this--Jim meant to display him, a tethered servant, before half or more of D’Angeline London’s realm.
“You were born with it.” Emile’s gaze flitted across Sherlock’s face, taking him in. “D’Angeline?”
“It means we trust each other to be there at the end of the day. That in everything he has my best interests at heart, and I have his. This is something he needs that I can’t give. It’s as simple as that.”
Sherlock flashed him a grin before rising to slip off his own pants and climbed onto the bed, straddling John until he sat lightly on his stomach. John’s vision was filled with Sherlock, with pale skin and toned muscle and a slender, uncircumcised cock rising proudly from a halo of dark curls. Sherlock leaned forward, splaying his palm for John to lick it; once done he wrapped those long fingers around himself and began to stroke.
“You’ve gotta be bloody kiddin’ me! I didn’t sign up for this--”
“Shall I tell you what I want my prize to be, when I win?”
Sherlock swallowed hard. Amelia had come to both of these servants. She’d used her mother’s maiden name. Jim had funded it, and it worked to take care of two of his own connections.
John felt that glow behind his breastbone gutter and nearly extinguish; the crook on his neck loosened entirely. It was true, and there was nothing either of them could do to stop it being true.
Before he could examine the thought further or else discard it, the door leading out to the back garden creaked open. John stepped through, fresh from his morning workout, bringing with him a breeze that filled the kitchen: sun-ripe apples, wet earth, wild and green things. The underlying tang of sweat, fresh and not unpleasant. His short blonde fringe stuck in spikes against his forehead, as matted as his dark grey t-shirt.
When he closes his eyes again he hears Sherlock’s voice nearby, echoing close on the water. “I can’t tell which is worse, John, your ability to hold a tune, or your drunken philosophising. Philosophisising? Philosising? You know what I mean.” A breathy, flippant chuckle follows.
The two people he loved best on either side, a flurry of petals suspended mid-air.
“This is ridiculous. Of course I have survived something terrible, but that doesn’t mean--”
