They paused about twenty feet away from the canopy. It was already clear that there was nobody here. There was just the chair (a shape-changing chair, apparently, but a chair), the footrest, the lamp on its little end-table, the book, and the little throw rug, which was off on its own, off to the side a bit. That was it.
. There. Right there." Cas pushed again, and Dean cried out. He seemed to be near collapse suddenly as some unexpected sensation rolled through him; he was clinging to Cas's wings again for dear life, one arm wrapped over each wing. Cas kept tugging at his cock with one hand, gripping his hip with the other, holding him up with the wings... another thrust...
Dean felt half-obliged to resist, or at least to crack some kind of joke. But the truth was that he was exhausted enough to just go with it. "All right, Nurse Moose," he said (the best he seemed able to come up with). Sam just rolled his eyes, and soon they were headed down the main road, Sam in front now while Dean settled into the back seat gratefully.
hours a day instead of fourteen. Eleven for good behavior." He glances back at Cas to find that Cas has already slouched so far down onto the sofa that his body has gone almost complete horizontal. His head's wedged against the sofa back, his chin on his chest and his fingers laced over his chest; he looks as if he's about to fall asleep. He dresses these days in a strange hybrid of his Gas-n-Sip outfit and his Lesser Trenchcoat outfit, and tonight the trenchcoat's splayed out on top of his blue vest. Cas peers over the rumpled trenchcoat at Dean and says:
"The perfect amount of... tousle...." Cas repeats, glancing at Dean's hair briefly, and then at Sam's.
And this time, for the first time, he actually looked awake for real. Weak and groggy, blinking up at them, but his eyes seemed clear. And he immediately focused on their faces.
"Different words for a giant flying thing that can kill you," Dean summarized. "Okay. I can buy that. People see it zoom past and don't get much of a look before they get killed. They see wings, four feet, maybe they see the fire and maybe they don't, they slap a name on it. So... what else does the lore say about griffins?"
"An... anatomical condition. A back condition. You could call it a deformity." Cas took a breath and said, more firmly, "I have a spinal deformity."
, sure, they can all agree on that. But is averting that particular tragedy really the best strategic choice here?
As if by magic he rose, the white-hot searing circle of pain tightening brutally. Slowly he was dragged upward along the rock wall, until he was entirely out of the water, hanging heavy in the rope, choking and drenched. Up he went, higher and higher. A strong hand gripped his arm.
"Hey Ted," Dean said. "You got any recipes that use peaches and blueberries? I mean, together in the same thing?"
bake, Claire," Dean suggests. "You know what they say, give a man a fish and he eats for a day; teach an angel to cook and you get cookies for eternity."
Cas gave a little shrug. "I didn't think it was worth bothering you. There's nothing I can do about it, anyway. I can't heal injuries anymore."
Dean's ready to fight, physically fight, to get to go on the chopper with Cas, but it turns out the EMTs are already planning to bring him along. "You're doing a great job keeping him awake," one of them says. "Keep it up. It's
There's some cryptic notes on the May and June pages that Dean can't make head or tail of — little abbreviations. Some of them seem related to Cas's travels after Flagstaff, and then the schedule at his Gas-n-Sip job — there are notations about how many hours per week he's working, and some Arizona phone numbers.
"I spent all night looking stuff up," Sam says, "and then I spent the whole drive trying to think what to do. I had a bunch of ideas." He looks back at Dean. "But of course you guys have probably really only had, like... five minutes to actually talk at all, huh?"
"What is that.... smell?" says Cas. He straightens up a little in his chair, putting the water bottle down in his lap, and he sniffs the air again. "Is that... What
at Cas. He drifted over to the sofa, his hands stuffed in his jeans pockets again, as he looked around at all the furniture. He looked at the sofa, he looked at the TV, he looked at Claire's pile of books on the floor... he glanced ever-so-briefly at Cas and instantly looked away again. He looked at the cable TV remote, and at the hallway, and at the coatrack that held Claire's winter coats, and looked toward the kitchen nook (pausing a long moment when he noticed the pie, and the silver kitchen knife that was set out next to it).
Yet Castiel didn't say where his camp was, and there wasn't even the least hint of "you should drop by sometime, Dean."
A thrashing noise nearby caught Dean's attention. He sat up and looked around, and discovered he was on the stony shore of a huge muddy swamp. Something was flailing around out there in the muddy water, only about ten yards away. The sprays of muddy water made it hard to see at first, but it was something with wings; smoking, muddy wings.
- A lot of my fics have a twist. I grew up reading mysteries and I still tend to tuck a mystery into every story, even if the story is technically a fantasy - a JK Rowling sort of approach actually (if you've noticed, almost all her Harry Potter books are actually structured in classic mystery format, straight out of Agatha Christie). This one had two twists: the cancer, and Amara.
"AND THEN. And then, my god, in Wyoming—" said Dean, flipping ahead in the journal. "He'd saved his last friggin' money in the world to buy us a beer, it was going to be this big gesture of friendship, and he finally gets the chance, in that bar, remember, and he buys us the beers and I
The first item he set on this shelf was a single bottle of whiskey. He had plenty more in the Rubbermaid, but one bottle at a time was all he needed out and available. He also set out two glasses; there were rarely any guests in this room, but it felt more grown-up to have two glasses, rather than a bachelor-standard single glass. (Though the bachelor-standard single glass was really all he ever used.)
At last he caught a glimmer of silver in one direction. The moon? He swam desperately toward it, heartbeat pounding in his ears, throat burning like fire, and finally broke the surface with a huge gasp, panting desperately.
And now Dr. Flaherty's flipping through the iPad, just as Dean had hoped, though the med student is crowding too close for Dean to get a clear look. Increasingly impatient, Dean finally sticks his head right through the med student's back, his eyes emerging from near the student's throat, just to try to see the iPad. But it's a mess of confusing medical results, full of terms and abbreviations that make no sense to Dean. But then, like a miracle, he hears Dr. Flaherty say: "Oh, see, he's just gotten back from an MRI — that was to assess whether he's got a large amount of blood piling up anywhere internally — and see how this code popped up over here in this box when he got back to the ICU just now. So, we're testing this new system where we track our patients' current locations by—"
She's trying to make it sound like no big deal. But she'd dropped everything and flown in the middle of the night, on
Sam tapped Dean's shoulder and pointed past Cas's right wing. Dean glanced over and saw that another hill-top, a few miles away from the dramatic lightning-web, seemed to be be surrounded by sparks of color that zinged through the air like fireworks, all in lines of bright blue and yellow. And in the other direction, beyond Cas's left wing, was an arrangement of no less than nine fat
Dean did so, burrowing his hands down into the silken plumes of the dream-creature's neck. Bands of golden light flowed through all the feathers then, running across the creature in glittering waves, from the tip of its nose to, Dean knew somehow, the very end of its long plumed tail.
Dean's actually grumbling to himself, "Frickin' call him, you coward," by the time he sends off the text about the bees. But he still doesn't call, and a moment later Sam replies with:
He ran through his weapons mentally; shotgun, loaded with two shells, and there were more shells in the backpack's hip-belt pocket. Pistol, holding the last six of Dad's armor-piercing bullets. The silver blade wasn't going to be much use yet — Dean was too far away for close combat — but who knew how things might develop. Tracing his fingers farther across his backpack straps, Dean then came across the canister of pepper spray, which he'd totally forgotten about, but pepper spray seemed unlikely to be of any use against supernatural beings. The wind was blowing the wrong way anyway.
Ryan gave him a sheepish grin. "Me 'n' Shawn were trying to cut some of the old scrap wood this morning to make him some more lemming boxes. Might've forgot to pull the old nails out. Sorry."
It occurs to Dean that the old lady probably hasn't always worn sensible shoes in sensible black. Once upon a time she must have been young; once upon a time she'd probably liked girly shoes, those feminine fashionable shoes that most girls go crazy for. She'd probably even worn high-heeled pumps, back in her day. Strappy sandals, maybe. Colorful party shoes. Once upon a time.
Here and there, little round hills broke above the water's edge, and on each hill lay a cluster of old ruins — the same sort of ruins they'd seen in the days before, on the silver plains and in the forest where Cas had first healed Sam's burns. Rubble piles of dark grey stone.
"Sorry, I forgot—" gasped Dean, trying to pull away. "You're sore— You're hurt. You've got all the cuts on your chest, too, I forgot about those—"
Again, Sam had a point. The heartbeat under Dean's hand was starting to feel a little more labored, the wingbeats more strained.
of space straight ahead. Below them the ground seems to fall away for at least a thousand feet. And that's just the first step down; there's whole other mountains down below that, spires and towers and buttresses and lower cliffs that are far, far below, like whole other worlds cascading downward below them.
," Sam says, "but, see, the Men of Letters used to have a whole box of angel feathers here at one point. They were trying to get some grace out of the feathers, to use to track angels."
"I'll help you," said Dean, moving over to one wing. "I can pull this wing along a little and Sam can get the other, okay?" Sam got the idea and waded over to the other wing. Dean positioned himself halfway along the wing, at Cas's golden alula, which turned out to be bigger than he'd realized. Close up, it turned out a full-size alula on a full-size angel's wing was a pair of stout, long bars of feathers a couple feet long, about the same dimensions as the blade of a canoe-paddle. They seemed to have a sturdy bony structure within, and made pretty decent wing-handles, actually. Dean got his arms around the golden feathers, saying, "Cas, stand up on three. One, two, THREE!"
Jody assures her that "our boys" will be in good hands all weekend, and Sarah and Jody part with a big hug of their own. They've been trading shifts for days and it's clear they're bosom buddies by now.
"I don't friggin' believe it," growled Dean. He pulled up a few spaces away and had barely cut the motor when Cas, who suddenly felt boiling with anger, jumped out of the golden Continental. Cas began striding toward Crowley even as Dean was still scrambling out of his own seat, saying, "Wait, Cas. Wait!"
"Yep," whispered Sam back. "Fever's almost gone - not totally, but, it's only like a hundred or something. But they want to check him all over and do some x-rays and diagnostics and clean him up. They say it'll be a couple hours. We're supposed to be out in five minutes."
It had seemed like it might be a little...  constricting, or worrying even, to have all the extra people here. A little crowded, maybe. But instead it's been nothing but good. Truth is, they really did need the help. (It doesn't hurt that the bunker's so big; there's still so many unused bedrooms, and dorm rooms, that the bunker seems to have absorbed the three additional people almost effortlessly.)
Eventually Cas continued, without a word, carefully working the belt buckle loose until the belt came free from around Dean's waist.
Sam was lying on his back nearby, just starting to sit up. Dean floundered over to him through mounds of sopping wet snow, and gave him a hand up. Cas was standing a few feet away on a patch of heather, gasping for breath, bending over with his hands on his knees. His wings were drooping down to the snow, quivering with exhaustion. The junco tottered across the tundra a few feet away, first with uneven hops and then making a short wobbly flight of its own, to a small willow-shrub where it perched uncertainly. As soon as Sam was on his feet, muttering to Dean "Fine, I'm fine," Dean dashed over to Cas.
Right now he had ended up sitting at the little corner table in his room, the half-disassembled pistol on the table, gazing sightlessly across the room at the whiskey bottle and the ever-present shot glass on his bookshelf. Dean flipped the pistol's empty magazine around and around in his hand, and his glance slid idly to the FBI phone. He'd taken to keeping it in his room, always plugged into its charger, but it had never rung again after that one time.
"Duck," corrects Cas absently. He's still stroking the feather. There's an odd smile crooking up one corner of his mouth.
Sam was wiping the other tusk free of dust; it had a similar set of carved runes. "That would been seriously old days, by the way," Sam added. "Back when the first humans came over from the Bering Strait. Also, they would've had to drag the tusks all the way down here, from Alaska to California, too. Woolly mammoths never lived anywhere around here." He stroked one hand over a tusk. "This must've taken some serious work."
So research was what Dean did. All the next day he was hunkered down in the library, and the day after that, and the day after that. Hour after hour he spent at the big wooden table, books spread out all around, reading through volume after volume about demons and Hell, looking for any information about summonings— and specifically, about potential ways to increase a given summoning spell's power or compel a demon to attend.
." He turned back to the the frayed edges of the hole, working away. "You see, I had this clever idea when I was first making the clip. It was clear the clip was not going to be enough. There needed to be a better fix. I had an idea for a better fix but it was a bit of a delicate job. In the meantime the clip was going to hold everything together. Just temporarily, of course. So then—"
it," Cas says. There's a note of frustration in his voice now. "The first twenty-four hours after treatment are... challenging. The first thirty-six, really." His hand tightens on Dean's arm as he says, "It's worse than what you just saw. It's more than you will want to deal with, trust me on that. And I do
On the nurse's instructions, Dean began feeding him an ice chip every half hour. Cas took these willingly, not seeming to even recognize that it was Dean who was feeding him. Each time, Dean touched Cas's lips lightly with the ice chip, and Cas opened his mouth slightly to accept it, his eyes remaining closed the whole time. He seemed so fragile that it felt like feeding a baby bird.
"Dad?" Claire said. "You okay?" Jimmy realized he'd started looking at the walls, turning his head a little. Searching for that longing feeling...
At once Dean's throat was closing up, his eyes stinging. He had to curl up and press his forehead into his hands.
Cas thought. "Once it was when you were here in town. You said something about, Sam's just gone out for breakfast. The second time was a couple days ago, and you were saying, Cas, can you hear me. But it was very faint and I lost hold of it pretty soon."
"What does it mean?" says Sarah quietly. "We all thought it was just some unusual-looking necrosis. But... you guys recognize this?"
spells?" Sam said. Dean glanced up at him, half-expecting him to be angry, but instead Sam just looked even more exhausted than usual, if that was possible. Sam said, "You've been... what, have you been
"You mean...." said Sam, thinking. "Ha. You think Gabriel's trumpet is really just his true voice?" He pondered that for a moment. "Huh. Makes sense, actually."
came into his mind. "Into the fire," said Dean.Dad looked at Dean sharply, nodded, and gunned the motor, but to Dean's surprise Dad then yanked the car around to the left, took it right off the road and down toward the crimson-red section of flame. The car bounced roughly as it ran over rough ground, and then it plunged into a dark gully.
The lake ice was still solid everywhere except the stream inflow zone. There was plenty of snow on the north-facing slopes, and even the south-facing slopes had enough strips of snow to be workable.
It's strange how normal this room looks now. Just another routine Winchester night in another routine low-rent motel. Now that Sam's arrived, with his stuff, the clutter all looks familiar: both duffels opened at the foot of the beds, stacks of clothes here and there, Sam's running shoes sitting by the door, both their jackets slung over two of the chairs. Sam's laptop is on the little table (along with
He's barely breathing as he lowers himself down; he's trying to move so gently that he won't disturb Cas at all. He gets all the way down, and starts to relax, fairly confident that he's succeeded in not jostling the mattress even the slightest bit. But nonetheless Cas notices after all. He stirs a little, and moves his head, and then he's slowly, creakily, rolling over to face Dean. (Sam hurries to adjust the towels, and moves the throwing-up pan to a more convenient position.)
Cas walks over to the table and sets his angel-blade down on the table by the book. "What can I do for you?" he asks. His smile at the door had seemed genuine enough, but as he sees Dean regarding the things on the table, he seems to raise his guard. The formal tone's back in this voice, as it had been when he'd said goodnight earlier; and that slightly steely impassive look is back in his eyes.
After a little pause Cas said (mostly to Dean, since Sam seemed lost in some memory now), "The battle has always been a battle between the Sun and Jupiter. Between whether to make this solar system a stable single-star system, or an unstable binary-star system — which may in fact be more beautiful from a cosmic perspective, but is also completely inhospitable to human life."
From Christmas to New Year's, Cas slept till at least noon every day, rousing only now and then to totter out to the kitchen for a meal, to the bathroom for a shower, or to the TV room - where he usually passed out on the sofa halfway through a movie. The pneumonia coughs seemed gone, at least, but he was clearly still exhausted and he seemed to not be fully over the flu. He still couldn't even walk very far without getting tired.
?" Dean had to try to keep the frustration out of his voice. It was a little surprising, actually, how much this was bumming him out — and it was going to be hard to convey this to Sam. He tried rephrasing it as, "They're seriously not giving you
Raphael glared at both of them. "Do I have to repeat myself? Get him down on this rock." There was another short pause; this time Gabriel and Balthazar glanced at each other.
"Blackbird, Blackbird—" Dean began, and he stopped. There was motion on the hill. Up by the nest of the golden plovers. He squinted through the windshield; snow was piling up so quickly on it now that he could get only a brief flash of fuzzy visibility in between each move of the wipers.
"Been watching you all day," said Dean, his head down now, gazing fixedly at his boots as he dug one heel into the loose gravel by the bench. "Sorry, I should've said. And... ah... yesterday too. Sorry, I... I really meant to say hello right away but... " He shifted his feet some more, scraping the gravel around with one boot heel and then the other. He scratched his cheek, and rubbed his nose, and looked off at the fountain. He finally went on, "Been looking for weeks. I've been looking for you for weeks. Been meaning to call but... Well, when I finally tried, your phone was deactivated. I was... kinda worried. I got kinda worried. I got pretty worried about that. So was Sam. We went looking for you. We went back to Idaho, and... well,
Dean took the exit, and took the next right. At a red light he glanced over at Sam and said, "So just to recap what we need to find out from Marcos, the big question obviously is, where's Cas. Right?" Sam nodded, and Dean added, "We'll also ask about the Crown if we get a chance, but the big thing is,
Hours later, at one o'clock, the motel maid came to change the bedding for the next guest, and she found Jimmy curled up on the bed staring at the wall, with the jacket wrapped tight in his arms.
This time it's not just one of those ghostly Veil moves, not like just phasing through a door. She seems to be truly digging into him somehow, pushing almost... and there's a glow in there. Thin shafts of bright silver light dart out arond her hand.
Sam's instantly on alert. (For the last few minutes he's been glancing at Dean off and on out of the corner of his eye.) "Where're you going?" he asks.
Dean's been given charge of the alula-feather. He's been clutching it with one hand in his pocket for nearly the whole last half-hour, afraid to take his fingers off of it. He pulls it out now and sets it carefully on Claire's throat. Cas and Rowena have already explained how to align it; Dean tries to remember exactly what they both said and places it delicately along the midline of Claire's throat, a little low, so that the bare shaft of the feather is on the very uppermost part of her breastbone, the soft black vane pointing towards her chin. A glance at Cas confirms he's positioned it correctly.
Cas couldn't sit still. He rose from his bed, still clutching the jacket and the badge hopefully, and went to the darkened living room, where there was a large picture window with a view of the street. He stood by the picture window for a long time, looking out at the world outside. At the lone streetlight, and the skeletal trees; at the bright winter stars.
"You know the real problem with this bunker?" Dean remarks, sitting up. "The shower stalls aren't big enough for two."
It wasn't till Cas twisted his head almost all the way around, apparently just in order to give Dean a quick lick on the forehead, that Dean realized what Castiel had really been saying.
Dean felt like he was watching this from a long way away, like a confused coach on the sidelines whose team had suddenly started running the wrong way on the field, toward the wrong goal. Dean's hand shifted slightly, sliding down Cas's cheek to cup the side of his jaw, feeling his smooth, silky, fresh-shaven skin, and then Dean was leaning closer. A little alarm siren started wailing in his head, yelling,
Cas nods. "It's always on my mind. I didn't mean to bring it up, but... well, I do have to call Dr. Klein tomorrow, about rescheduling the tests. And so...  Well. Yes, it's on my mind. But, really, Dean, I mean it—" He turns his head to gaze at Dean. "Even one more day is such a gift."
"I used to have the magic touch with a lot of things," remarked Castiel, shaking out his hands. "So to speak. These days I'm lucky if I can manage to open a bottle of that beer of yours without straining my fingers."
This is an incredibly encouraging thought. Especially since Cas hasn't dropped any hints at all yet about diagnosis — or, even more critically, prognosis.
.... who happens to be an oncologist who specializes in chemotherapy, and who Castiel has been visiting every four weeks like clockwork. Three weeks on, one week off. At a hospital. Doesn't chemotherapy involve some sort of repeating schedule?
"I don't see anyth—" Dean started to say, but then, as if emerging mysteriously from the background, there they were: four speckled eggs, perfectly camouflaged, arranged in a precise star shape with their pointed ends all facing neatly inward. They were all blotched with irregular patterns of black, white, and green, such that they were barely visible, even though they were sitting right there in the open on the rocky ground. There didn't even seem to be any kind of a nest, just a tiny little hollow in the lichen.
"You stay here," she said. "Actually I was wondering if you'd, uh.... definitely be here? Tomorrow afternoon?"
After a moment Dean realizes that Cas seems to be exploring the anatomy. He's tracing out the shapes of things. Cockhead, cockshaft, balls, upper thighs — he goes over all of it, every part, every inch; and all with that same air of gentle care as Cas had used earlier on Dean's face. Weirdly, it's still totally unclear if this is intended as sexual or not, but whatever Cas's intent, of course the hard-on is returning. After just a few more moments of anatomical exploration, Dean's got a full erection and Cas calmly shifts to exploring his way up and down the cockshaft. It's getting a little awkward now — Dean's increasingly-stiff cock is now stuck along the left leg of the sweatpants, pointing down. Cas shifts Dean's cock around till it's pointing up toward the waistband.
Dean added, "Sam's been telling me we should come back to Missoula anyway." He glanced down at the ground again. "Kinda been on my case about it."
sick. I mean, there's things like... he doesn't even think he's gonna be around long enough to heal his wings! He doesn't think he even has that much time yet! And, shit, he still won't tell me what the hell it is! What stage or anything." All the worries are suddenly spilling out, all the gnawing uncertainty about Cas's cancer, as Dean goes on, "He seems
Somehow it makes Dean feel hopeful. If Cas still has a few tiny bits of angel in him... and if they can roll with even unexpected punches like this last one, and somehow come out on top.... maybe all hope isn't lost? Maybe there's still a few things they could try?
Claire said, "They realized they should leave you alone. Leave you with me. They watched for a while. Heard me asking questions about when I was a kid... heard you answering. I... I kind of told them to leave. Anyway, you're fine now." She stood and turned her back, muttering, "I'll get you a glass of water."
Forcing himself into a jog again, he tried to pick up the speed, but soon he'd reached the end of the little gravel road. Here the tundra got so uneven and bumpy that he knew he couldn't risk running. A sprained ankle would only make everything worse. Topaz, too, had totally disappeared now, the whole world narrowing to a swirling patch of thick snowflakes just a hundred yards wide or so. But there was a pink flag behind, and a pink flag ahead, and at each pink flag Dean took a read on his precious compass, and he kept going westward.
“Did you,” Dean asks, and it sounds ridiculously suggestive without him even trying. Cas seems to agree, the sweep of his lashes as he lowers them soot-black wings of shadow on his pale cheeks. “Guess I should check that out.” Cas looks back up at Dean, and maybe Heaven gives you night vision, because the look of want on his face is so clear to Dean. It makes his throat tight, his eyes feel hot. “Wanna join me?”
Dean hauls him up for a kiss, making it just as bruising and biting, and slides one hand down to Cas’ ass, holding them tightly together. It’s perfect, inelegant friction, and Dean is so close from it already. There’s tension in Cas’ shoulders that tell Dean he’s probably just as on edge, which brings Dean even closer, just the thought that he’ll get to see Cas come, feel it rush through him, feel it on his skin.
Dean sits on the edge of the bed, giving it an experimental bounce, and feels his eyebrows fly up. Cas is still standing in the doorway, and he smiles. “See?” He says, and Dean laughs.
This time when Dean moves, it’s to come in for a kiss. Castiel sees it coming, the way Dean’s eyelashes flutter close as he tips his head, the way his mouth purses just slightly. But it’s still a shock, when Dean’s lips touch Castiel's own.
“I’m on duty,” Cas says. It’s such a humanism, something he’d seen in the procedurals he’d study so he could play agent with Dean and Sam, and it makes Dean smile.
Castiel’s room in the bunker is an old research library that Sam and Dean had given a cursory dusting. He doesn’t need a bedroom, since he doesn’t need a bed, and the cluttered, stuffy room is comforting to him. It smells of old paper and chilly concrete, and the big armchair is perfect for curling up in to watch Netflix. Castiel has been working through
After that the visitors are nonstop. Bobby and Sam come in, and Bobby plunks down on a barstool like it’s always been his and he doesn’t plan on leaving. Mom and Dad show up first, and Dean thinks they all should be crying as they reunite, and the joy he feels as he takes his mom in his arms does make his eyes prickle, but no tears fall. Dad and Sam start up a game of pool, and Mom loads the jukebox, and by the time the first song is over Ellen and Jo are there, and Ash, inspecting the place with critical eyes. Rufus wanders in and takes his place at Bobby’s side.
Cas shifts closer, edging between two barstools so Dean doesn’t have to lean quite so far to touch him. He lets go of Cas’ coat and gets his fingers around Cas’ arm instead, slides over fabric and cuff button, wrist bone and rough skin until their fingers are linked, resting on top of the bar.
“Fuck,” Dean says, dragging his mouth along Cas’ bristly cheek. The word feels holy in this moment, with Cas rocking against him, Cas’ hands gripped tight in Dean’s shirt.
“You’re okay,” Dean mutters, fiercely, and then his fingers loosen, shift, come together on the bottom-most button of Castiel's shirt.
So, he’s dead. He’s been dead before, in dumber ways, in more heroic ways. Seems fitting that the last time would be sort of mundane. At the end of a fight they were winning, at the hands of a monster but not necessarily monstrously. It had hurt, but when Dean tries to focus on the pain the memory of it skitters away from him. He can see Sammy’s tear-streaked face, but only as a promise of his brother going on to live.
Of course it was Cas. Every detail in the roadhouse is lovingly placed, plucked right out of Dean’s wildest dreams and made reality.
It doesn’t feel like a Netflix night, not when he can still feel the poison from Michael’s spear coursing through his body. It isn’t of course, it is just a phantom pain. Crowley’s cure had been complete. Crowley, curing Castiel. He is still unsure what the motivation could have been. Their time working together had been brief and less than pleasant.
“I never let myself think of home as a place much. Not a home of my own. People have always been my home. My dad for a while, Bobby. Sam, of course.” Dean squeezes Cas’ hand. “You.” Cas ducks his head. “You knew me well enough to know that.”
It’s a great morning. And he knows it’s going to be a great day. And despite the newness, the oddity of it, he doesn’t feel daunted by the prospect of neverending awesomeness. He just feels excited. Ready.
“Hello,” Jack says, hand lifted in his customary wave. He’s still wearing his white jacket, his jeans and his scuffed sneakers. Dean wants to hug him, but he doesn’t know if it’s appropriate. He moves forward to do it anyway.
Dean dies, and goes to Heaven, and after Bobby plays welcome wagon Dean knows exactly what he wants to do.
He’d showered off the blood, passing his ruined clothing off to Mary. Her face had been closed off, furtive. Guilty, but Castiel couldn’t figure out if it was a generalized guilt or something more specific. Her sons are easier to read. Sam because he wears his thoughts and feelings so plainly on his face, and Dean because … well, because he is Dean. He is Castiel’s; Castiel knows Dean Winchester better than anyone, understands him more than anything.
Sam quirks an eyebrow at her, as if he’s picturing what Charlie would wiggle her nose and procure. Dean wonders if Cas already built something for him, or if he should be thinking it up himself.
Cas smiles, and now he pulls away. Something dark flickers behind him, not quite the shadow of wings but close to it. “I’d like that.”
Dean gathers Cas close again, his mouth open against Cas’ skin. They haven’t even kissed properly yet, and suddenly Dean is desperate for it. He surges to his feet, catches Cas’ face in both his hands, and presses in.
On Earth it might be too early to open a roadhouse for the day, but in Heaven it’s exactly the right time. As soon as the neon buzzes to life the door swings open. It’s Sam, and—
“And if you still want it, the thing you thought you couldn’t have, well. Man, of course you can have it.”
When Charlie walks in, Dean rushes her so fast he thinks he’s going to knock her over. The otherworld version had been great, but the original is so much better, pulling out of Dean’s hug and punching his shoulder with a giant grin. She grabs Jo to join her in heckling Sam’s shooting, and Dean stands at the door and takes everything in.
Dean snorts, and lifts their joined hands to brush a kiss against Cas’ knuckles. It’s a gesture softer than Dean is used to dealing out, but it feels right in the moment. In this place. This space that Cas created for Dean to be happy in forever.
Sleep in Heaven isn’t like sleep on Earth. It’s a choice more than a necessity, and it’s sudden and deep. Dean wakes in the morning to an empty bed, covers pulled up to his chin. He’s wearing a henley and a pair of flannel pants, which he doesn’t remember putting on the night before. He knows it was Cas, just as he knows that Cas kissed Dean’s cheek before he left, off to help Jack with more heavenly business. Just as he knows that somewhere Sam is running through a pine forest, along a river; Mom and Dad are at their kitchen table eating scrambled eggs. Dean sits up, marveling at the lack of back pain, the lack of tightness in his hips. His body feels better than it has in years. Better than it has ever.
“Hey, Sammy,” Dean says, turning. Sam looks like Dean left him, but softer. He smiles, and Dean grabs him for a hug. The one slightly jagged edge in Dean’s mind is smoothed away as he squeezes his brother tight.
The beatific face splits into a smile, and it’s the surprised pleased one Jack had given Dean so many times before. “Do you like it?”
Maybe Castiel doesn’t know Dean as well as he thinks, because when Castiel pulls the door open, Dean stands there. It is whiskey Castiel smells on his breath, not beer. And the look on his face is even worse than the one Castiel had imagined him wearing.
There are tentative fingers in his hair, smoothing over the crown of his head, getting more sure as they go until they’re gripping firmly around the nape of his neck. “You’re welcome,” Cas whispers down at him.
“If you make me choose, you won’t like it.” Dean’s never heard Cas’ voice so flirty. Or maybe he has but he wasn’t able to parse it before. Now he can, and the delight it causes warms Dean down to his toes.
“We were talking about where everyone was going as they left. Charlie has a place, Sam could sense his house, but I didn’t know—“ Dean cuts himself off, spreads his hands. “This place, this and Baby and my family.” Dean drops his hands, rubs his palms on his thighs. “You. It’s more than I thought I would get.”
Cas’ weight is not inconsiderable, but it’s good. It’s so good. It grounds Dean to the mattress, into the memory foam that somehow already remembers him. They’re sticky just long enough for Dean to enjoy the visceral realness of it, and then it’s gone. Cas’ hair is sweat damp at the temples, spikes of it clumped to his cheek, and it stays that way long enough for Dean to press his mouth there and taste the salt of it, and then it’s clean and dry again, back to looking artfully windswept.
'Yes, a magazine, Ford Prefect. A little porn would probably be good for you. Or teach yourself to knit. Learn about cars. Just...figure it out. We'll be back in three days.'
'Why not? He's a pretty nice guy. He's funny. You seemed to like him. When was the last time, Dean?'
'It's going pretty well. I've had a few commissions and I've started supplying one of those fancy kitchen stores. I finally got to quit at the hotel.'
Dean is in a clearing in the woods. It's dusk, the last light sliding down to the horizon. Trees hang overhead like stretching arms. He is alone but for an old rusted gas stove. 'Hello?' he calls. As soon as he speaks, he knows he shouldn't have. Misery overwhelms him. His heart is breaking, breaking, breaking in his chest. He crumples and clutches the stove-top to keep from falling. Birds erupt from the trees. The only thing that is real through the pain is Dean's hand flat against a burner. He pushes himself up and knows he must keep his hand on the stove at all costs. His heart wrenching, he opens his eyes. His father stands in front of him, hand hovering over the stove's igniter. Sparks swirls around them. Birds are still pouring from the trees and into the great bowl of the sky. Dean can't straighten up, can't stop the waves of sadness that are crippling him. He stares at his father and waits to burn.
'Oh yeah. Like when lightning hits a beach.' Duh. Dean thinks that if he had to compare them, Cas would be the gathering storm and Dean would be the waiting shore.
Cas laughs, and turns to Bobby. Dean watches, trying not to let anyone know how much this matters to him. He keeps his face cautiously blank.
Dean clears his throat. “Yes, it is. Can I...” He gestures to the shower. Cas nods, still confused. His confusion deepens as Dean removes his clothes and leaves them in a pile on the floor. Cas can't help but stare. He rebuilt that body. He isn't sure if that's what's making his heart beat uncomfortably loud and fast and hot in his chest. He can feel the heat spreading. Dean steps into the shower and they face each other. Cas is mildly embarrassed but mostly curious about the fact that his body is showing signs of arousal. He feels an alien impulse and is amazed when he realises that it's the urge to hide himself. He tries to find something else to look at, backs away from Dean until the tap digs into his lower back.
Sam went upstairs to his room, wondering what Dean meant, leaving Dean and Cas to fold origami animals out of the wrapping paper and laugh at each other's failed attempts. He moved his books aside on the bookshelf and reached to the back. His fingers brushed the smooth paper and he fished out Dean's present. Uncle Bobby had given Sam this amulet a few months ago and told him it was really special, so Sam wanted Dean to have it.
'That's our number. You tell your brother we love him, and you tell him to call me if he's ever in troub- if he ever needs anything. Same goes for you, alright?' Uncle Bobby stared at Sam searchingly.
Cas looked at him as they reached Dean's door and Dean met his eyes. He felt like Cas was trying to tell him something wordlessly. The air around them smelled like snow, the lights from both their houses lit up the burgeoning dark, and Cas was staring at Dean like he couldn't find the words to say what he meant. Instead, Cas reached out his hand and brushed along Dean's jaw with cold fingertips. Cas' gaze was so piercing that Dean was surprised his hand didn't go right through him. He leaned into the touch.
He walked into the kitchen to see John Winchester sighing and looking through the cupboards. His dad turned, saw Dean in the doorway, and crossed the room to give him a tight hug. 'Dean.'
He woke up and cried. In that moment, he wished Cas was there more than anything, felt his absence like an abscess. And, for making him hurt, he hated Cas. Really hated him. He didn't know what he was feeling. Loss? Shame? Grief? And, as always, he was acutely conscious of the dark-haired and blue-eyed presence next door. He felt watched as he got ready, even though he knew he probably wasn't. Before Sam could walk out the door with his backpack, Dean nabbed him.
By the time Castel pulled up to the house with Claire in the backseat, he had forgotten about it, pushing all the thoughts back into their usual corner of his mind. There was an old-fashioned black car in the driveway next door, he registered, and the lights were on. The new neighbours must have moved in today.
Who says things like 'out of sorts?' The corners of Dean's lips twitch. The bruised place in his chest feels sore. 'What are you doing here so late, anyway?'
Dean nodded. When Dean got older, he'd look back on this moment and wonder why he'd thought he understood. He'd known that his dad's job was what kept food on the table, known that it had to be done. But he'd missed the undertone to his dad's question, the lines between the lines, that hands-out palms-up begging for absolution. In the future, Dean wouldn't blame his dad. He probably would've wanted to avoid the house just as much as his dad did if their places were reversed.
Here Castiel covered his ears as tightly as he could. “I can't hear you, I'm not listening, I don't want to picture my big brother in COMPROMISING POSITIONS!”
'Yeah! We can go see the apes, right? Cas has never seen one!' and with that he turned back to Castiel to resume their conversation as they clambered in and buckled their seatbelts. In his excitement, Sam threw his small stuffed toy at Dean, who patiently picked it up and handed it back.
'My brother. We only had each other when Dad died, and it's been my job to look out for him since we were kids, so I just...kept doing it. But he's at Stanford now, so...' Dean shrugs.
'You're probably right,' Chuck tells him gloomily. 'You wouldn't believe the fruit abomination at the back of the staff fridge I found the other day.'
Maybe, he thought, his limbs were so heavy because of all the work he and Jimmy had done that day – splitting logs, climbing into dumpsters, hiding in a crawlspace when the owners of the house they were breaking into came back unexpectedly – The Family had many jobs that needed to be done, and some roles could only be played by children. No one questioned children when they were somewhere they weren't supposed to be, and if a child was caught stealing or breaking in they were usually given a sharp warning rather than a jail sentence. Even these thoughts came to his mind sluggishly, fighting against a tide of unnatural exhaustion.
Dean, still irritable from the unwanted furry affection, retorted, “He can't understand. You do know that Bones doesn't speak English, right?”
Cas brings him out a bowl of steaming soup and a small plate of garlic bread. Dean scoots over on the couch so Cas can sit down. 'You want some?' Dean asks with his mouth already full.
'Sure.' Dean knew that it wouldn't have mattered if he had a house full of family and happy memories, he'd follow Cas anywhere. He grabs a couple of plastic forks from the shelf with room supplies. They walk outside and the night air swirls around them, the smell of rain stronger now, tinged with the scent of the flowers from the hotel garden. Dean hears Cas breathe deeply.
Dean gets progressively worse all day. It's as if he's moving in slow motion, watching himself do everything wrong, but he's powerless to change it. Mistake after mistake, delay after delay. He can feel it all building up behind his eyes as a stabbing headache. It's the usual panic he gets himself into, but it's coming on slowly. Dean can't stop thinking of his father's face in the dream; slightly blurred, vague, as if Dean is forgetting what he looked like.
'I know, son.' Sam could tell from the tone that his jaw was clenched. 'I'm on my way home. I'll be back by ten. If there's nothing to eat, I want you to go over next door and ask if you can stay until I get there. You understand?'
'Is that what you're after?' Dean folded himself into a well-worn couch, and indicated that Cas should do the same. Cas sat down.
Two days later, as he drives to the address Cas texted him, Dean rolls the windows down and takes stock of the scenery. The world is on the verge of summer, the trees look greener, and the spring flowers are dying back to make room for the furious blooming season ahead. Dean watches the neighbourhoods change: The buildings shrink, the streets gain character, the windows sprout window boxes, the chain stores disappear and are replaced with smaller, friendlier shops.
'Yes. Sorry, I should run. I have to clock in.' And then he practically flees, and Dean is left feeling puzzled. Was it something he said?
Crowley clapped him on the back. 'Good. Hate to think of Dean Winchester as a coward. My whole life system would be shattered. Can't have that.'
'Don't take it personally, she wanted to see them anyway. That's Jess,' Sam says fondly, 'always thoughtful to a fault.'
Sam looked back and forth between them. Dean put the plant down on the table and flicked his hands to get the muddy water off. 'Oh. Well.' He bobbed his head in a yeah-I-guess movement and turned back to his food. He wasn't about to question Cas' logic. The angel just did peculiar stuff sometimes, and when Dean asked about it, Cas always sighed and explained with painful exasperation. It was never very important for Dean to understand anyway, so he simply filed Cas under 'Unfathomable Inner Workings' along with cats, Twitter, and teenagers, and didn't worry about it.
The rest of his siblings were always called by their names, but to Mrs. McGuirk Castiel was always Young Novak. He never wondered why; Mrs. McGuirk was a bundle of Unfathomable Tendencies.
Sam heard crunching gravel in his mind, remembered playing in Bobby's salvage yard, remembered the feeling of weeks stretching out to the end of forever. 'Come back soon, Cas. I'm gonna miss you. Christmas won't be the same without you.' Sam couldn't help it, his voice wobbled and cracked a little.
After that, Sam noticed that Dean hardly spent any time with Benny, and he knew Dean was sneaking out of school more often than he was going in. Sam saw him sometimes, watched him follow Crowley and Bela as they kicked a hole in the fence at the back of the soccer field and slunk off into the distance. Dean slammed his boot into the chain links like the fence had personally insulted him, like the twisting metal was what had left him flat and waiting and furious. Sam wished more than ever that their dad would come home and stay for longer than a week or two. He got his wish when the high school called John about Dean's attendance.
John smiled at the new boy and said, 'You make yourself at home, son. I'll go make you two some lunch. Maybe you can meet Sammy too, if he's up from his nap soon.' Dad left for the kitchen, and Castiel looked at Dean.
Cas thought. 'Six of swords coming up soon for you, though. Leaving your troubles behind. Then The Sun. Hey, that's great!' Dean gave him a brief smile. 'You weren't thinking of your future when you shuffled the cards. Not specifically.' It wasn't a question.
'Thanks, Gabe.' Dean had been aiming for sarcastic but the atmosphere of the house somehow made it sound half-genuine. Gabe patted Dean's cheek obnoxiously and then turned to rummage through the bowl of candy on the coffee table.
It clicks. That explains everything. 'No, no. No. She stayed with me for a few days when she messed up her leg, yeah, but that's all.' So that's why Cas was avoiding him. It takes a second for that to sink in, and a warm glow starts to build in Dean's chest. Cas looks relieved, and Dean grins rakishly at him. 'Is that why you didn't talk to me for a week?'
Anna tugged at her hair and sat down in the comfy-looking chair by the door. 'You two go on inside, I'll wait here.'
Dean falls asleep thinking about reaching for Cas in the dark and the low rumble of his voice, wondering what exactly they are to each other.
Cas balled his hands into fists and stared at them. 'Are you sure? I can't punch you. I'm not even mad at you.'
Dean thinks of the dream all day. He's lost in it. The look on Castiel's face, the falling droplets of water, the feeling of being frozen. He's not really in the mood for chatting, so he's grateful for the hectic schedule of the day. The machines chunter and rattle in corners, and the noises of the appliances destroy any hope for conversation. Dean's glad. Otherwise, someone might ask him why he's so distracted, and he might have to think about it, and he doesn't want to. It's a bank holiday weekend, and a slew of people are booked in. The cleaning crew are in and out all day, running back and forth with cups, saucers, napkins, bottles of cleaning solution. Dean looks up every time, hoping to see Castiel.
They stumbled back to the bunker bloody and exhausted and Dean headed to his room, fully prepared to collapse on his bed in his dirty clothes and sleep for a couple days. It wasn't to be. Dean opened his bedroom door and yelled. He had his gun out and aimed before he even knew what he was doing. Adrenaline pumped through his veins as he stared at a huge stuffed grizzly bear looming in the middle of the room. Its mouth was open in a silent snarl, its claws spread out and glinting dully in the yellow light.
“I think she's also interested in one of your teas. She's from some garden club. She said you gave one of her friends some tea as a get-well gift last year.”
When John got home, he barely spoke except to tell Sam to pack his suitcase. Sam watched the muscle in his dad's jaw twitch as they folded clothes and put Sam's toothbrush into a plastic bag. Fury radiated from John like a noxious cloud. Sam was too awed to say anything into the thrumming silence, so it lay between them for the whole drive. Sam didn't remember nodding off, but he must have.
Dean wandered through the fences and brightly-twinkling windows of his neighborhood in the dusk, hiding the bottle in his jacket between sips. The sky was a swirl of purples, grays, dark blues, and streaks of fading orange. The cold nipped at Dean's hands and face. Typical. Thanksgiving: A time for family, togetherness, and counting your blessings. And what was Dean Winchester doing? Stumbling over the sidewalks, scuffing the rampant grass growing up through the cracks, balancing on the curb, avoiding his life.
Dean put on a hugely offended expression and sat down, slouching in the chair. Cas smirked and began sketching with a pencil.
The tension drains from Dean's shoulders, his stomach un-knots, and his fists relax. He tries not to sound shaky when he responds, 'God, Samantha, don't freak me out like that. Alright, enough with the feelings. What are we doing tonight?'
'Come on, slowpoke, get the lead out. Which way do you want to go?' Dean lifted his arms. Sam heard the distant sound of caroling coming from one direction, so he pointed.
Cas shifts uncomfortably. 'Thank you, but that won't be necessary. I'll only be shadowing Hester for a few more days.'
Later that evening Bela, Crowley, Meg, and Alastair came over. Sam cast them a disgusted glance and slunk to his room. When Meg and Alastair were wrapped around one another on the couch and Crowley was outside smoking, Bela leaned over and tugged at Dean's belt buckle. At that moment, when the metal clicked and his belt loosened, Dean had an epiphany.
'We WOULD be, if Dean could concentrate long enough.' To illustrate his point, Dean's phone goes off again. Dean dives for it. He can feel Bobby and Sam exchanging a look over his head.
A hand landed on Dean's arm and he nearly jumped out his skin. Crowley and Bela jerked back in surprise.
John thought for a moment. 'He's been good, Bobby, real good. Ever since he started talking again he won't stop. He's a regular chatty Kathy. It helps that he has friends his age in the neighborhood, I think.'
'Besides,' said Anna, reappearing at the table with her change, 'isn't it relevant to your project?'
Cas is woken up by the sound of the front door swinging shut. One of the boys must have gone out for something. He yawns and lifts his arms straight up, stares at them. He clenches his hands into fists and then relaxes them, watching his tendons appear and disappear. Long lines of flesh. Pale curving roads. He bends his elbows a little, then straightens them, rotates his arms clockwise, counter-clockwise. He is mesmerised by the different interlocking pieces, the curves and dips, the thought of bones beneath it all, connected but kept from touching by cartilage. He pictures all of his bones floating free from one another. This vivid visual is interrupted by his brain clicking into gear and reminding him of last night. The drinking, the laughing, the pile of chocolates wrapped in pink foil, the drunken game of charades that made the three of them laugh hard enough to cry. He had unwrapped the Valentine's Day chocolates for Sam and Dean, had smoothed out all the pieces of pink foil. Cas eventually gets out of bed and wanders to the main room. Sam follows not long after and pours them both coffee.
Sam waited impatiently all day to see if Cas would come over and say hi, then waited impatiently all evening for Dean to get home so he could tell him the news. Cas didn't come over. Sam figured he was probably busy unpacking. And Dean didn't come home. But Sam was too pleased to let the wait bother him. He microwaved leftovers for dinner and called Jess instead. He felt lighter than air.
“Thanks, Cas.” He took a steadying sip of room-temperature tea and they spent a moment in comfortable silence.
Cas flicked his wrist and the terrifying mass of fur slid several feet to the right. Dean gave it the once-over as Cas left. As far as bad gifts went, this one was his favorite. After the initial heart-stopping terror.
'No worries, brother. It's good to have you back.' The smile he gave Dean was genuine. His eyes crinkled.
Cas and Dean both felt the same way about their parents, even though they didn't speak about it. Realizing that parents are ordinary humans who make mistakes and break promises was a cold shock, like waking up in the middle of the night to a loud noise or missing a step in the dark. It might have been because of this that Dean found himself clinging to Cas like a lifeline. They took the broken parts of themselves that didn't fit into their respective families and tried to glue them together into something else.
Moment by moment, he dragged himself forward until he reached the bedroom door. He reached out weakly and pressed the door, which swung outward slowly enough to be silent, revealing a truly ghastly sight. One of the girls, Anael, was lying naked in the centre of the next room. She appeared to be fast asleep. Castiel's mind, confused, latched on to small details in a desperate bid to make sense of what he saw. Goosebumps covered her arms and legs. Her red hair was splayed out over the ground. His head swam, and he realised that the flickering light was caused by dozens of candles lining the room. His eyes fought to stay open, but it felt as if they were  being forcefully pulled down. Tall robed figures were circling her, chanting, as one hooded figure knelt down before her. With an electric surge of horror, Castiel saw a knife glint in the firelight. He tried to scream, tried to warn her, but all that escaped his leaden throat was a moan of horror. The robed figures turned in sharp unison to face him, and he blacked out.
Dean felt his stomach sink. Cas wasn't spoiled. Cas was...Cas. His Cas. Cas, who had filled Dean's stocking one Christmas and made him believe in magic, if just for a millisecond. His best friend. No, he reminded himself. Cas wasn't his friend. Hadn't the last few months proved that? There was another, smaller voice at the back of Dean's mind that screamed at him for being stupid and stubborn and wrong, but it was drowned out as a few choice memories reared their heads. Anger glittering in Cas' eyes in the dark. Cas storming down the stairs. Cas' hard voice saying 'Because you know that wasn't my idea.' Watching through a crack in his bedroom curtains as Cas disappeared. Pain swept through him like a tidal wave. His anger propelled him the rest of the way.
He remembered sitting on the floor with his sketchbook. Concentration. Avoidance. The scent of new paper. The thought of going home. Half-suppressed noises of frustration. His backpack next to him.
'Next time, you come out and visit me, and we'll both go to Bobby's. You know he'd love to see you.'
He rubbed his fingertips together. Was he imagining it or could he still feel the silty powdery slickness of ash? A discordant note in an otherwise familiar song. It was a small thing, such a small thing, but it felt like a rift in space had opened and disturbed reality. He felt out of place and slightly unreal, as if someone had drawn him as a clumsy afterthought onto the canvas of his life.
This is the worst it gets for Dean, promise. It's the rock-bottom bit, and it all goes up from here. =]
'Alright. Here.' Dean handed Cas a stack of cards; larger than ordinary playing cards, thicker, and slippery. Cas took them gingerly. 'Concentrate on what you want to know and shuffle the cards around. You can just dump 'em on the table if you want. When a card feels right to you, hand it to me. Make sure to keep it facing the same direction. It matters whether the card is upside down or not.'
When he finally does, it takes him by surprise. Dean's mixing kirsch into almond flour for redcurrant amandines and he's completely focused on blending when he catches sight of someone standing nearby out of the corner of his eye. He glances up, prepared to tell Chuck to deal with whatever it is himself, and is pulled up short by the sight of Castiel. Dean nearly drops his bowl.
Crowley's place was on the other side of the tracks and no, that wasn't just an expression. Crowley technically lived in the next neighborhood over, even though he was only a few streets away across the ancient train tracks. He lived in a duplex in a row of duplexes with small bricked-over lawns out front. Weeds grew up at the corners of the houses, and one of Crowley's upstairs windows was completely covered with that ugly brown packing tape. Dean had no idea why. The place was small, so everyone mostly hung out in Crowley's garage. It seemed to be a sort of open house 24/7. At any given time, a strange mish-mash of people could be found there playing music, drawing on the walls with permanent markers, making out, experimenting with cheap tattoo guns, selling dodgy pills with little clip-art pictures of palm trees on them, or buying dodgy pills with little clip-art pictures of palm trees on them.
Jimmy hastily choked back a laugh, and Castiel imagined him ducking around the corner so as not to get caught spying. “I think they saw me,” he whispered. “I'll see you later.” And he hung up.
Cas fell asleep in the bluish glow to exaggerated screams and grotesque squelching on a low volume. Dean smiled as he listened to Cas' steady breathing. He found his own breaths slowing to match and eventually sleep rolled over him.
It became a small town with a big heart, as its motto succinctly proclaimed in peeling paint on the weather-worn welcome sign. A sweet place with just enough character to keep it from being trite and with something indefinable that made those passing through lift their heads and take notice. Not that there were many of those; Birch Ridge was not a huge tourist attraction. But it did have a smaller, steadier stream of visitors during the summer months that mostly consisted of middle-aged couples on the hunt for a nice B&B and architecture students from neighbouring towns and cities.
Dean pointed at a card with a young man holding a goblet. 'That's the page of cups. It's my signifying card.'
'Depends on what you're drowning in. Chocolate I could do.' Dean grins and Jo laughs, tossing her hair back. Dean loves bantering with Jo, it reminds him of Sam. But Jo isn't Sam, and Dean can't completely let loose with her, always has to keep a thin screen between them, even if it's only to reassure himself that he isn't encouraging her. This crush of hers will dissipate, given time. Dean is sure of that, he dated enough women in college to recognize Jo's type. She's sweet, charming, and much too good for Dean. Fragile deep down, though she doesn't act like it.
Once the plants were watered, Castiel stood staring out the window and listening to the coffee dripping into the pot. The backyard was half-invisible through a curtain of mist, the huge old trees looming and sprawling like a vast slow army. The usually-rustling leaves were perfectly still and, if he squinted, the whole scene looked like a painting in shades of dawn-breaking purple and blue. He stared unseeingly at the expanse of lawn covered with childhood memories: The old tire swing that his brothers had insisted they put up after watching To Kill A Mockingbird, the tool shed that Castiel used to sneak cigarettes in, the flower beds their mother had so carefully pruned. Despite all of these memories, their parents had wanted to sell the house when Castiel and his siblings were all grown. Castiel couldn't bear the idea. Even though he was no longer dependent on his parents, the thought of losing their home opened up a chasm of fear between his ribs. After a week the anxiety was unbearable, so he'd sat his parents down and asked to buy the place before they put it up for sale. They'd called the real estate company to cancel everything and had offered their son the house outright, saying that they could afford a slightly smaller place with their savings alone, but Castiel had insisted on giving them a reasonable amount. He always felt he already owed them too much. Some things could never be repaid.
The cry is drowned out by a hot wet growling right in his ear. He falls backward and the werewolf falls on top of him, hard, knees up to smash into Cas' stomach. His stomach cramps up as if to vomit but there's nothing there. Cas tries to gasp in pain or yell or even breathe, but his lungs won't inflate. Stuck. Frozen. He tries to inhale, panicking now, arms flailing uselessly at the werewolf's snarling face. The werewolf pulls its arm back to drive it into Cas' chest and a shot rings out.
'What?' Dean looks back at Cas, but can't hold his gaze. Cas' eyes are headlights, Dean is the hapless crossing animal.
Dean closed the door behind him as quietly as he could. He did it out of habit even though he knew he didn't have to: Dad had taken off on another job and Sammy was at Jessica's house for the 4th of July BBQ. If Dean hadn't been feeling so apprehensive, he would have smiled about it. Jess' family had practically adopted Sam after last year's Thanksgiving and any fool could see that the two were ass-over-teakettle in puppy love with each other.
'Right.' Kevin nods and hustles back to the oven as Dean grabs the lunch-laden tray and backs out of the swinging doors. Room service. Really. Why can't the guests just get their asses up and walk to the dining room? It's like a three minute walk, max. Dean walks as quickly as he can without alarming anyone. He walks down the 120s corridor, heading for bottom 70s. An open door, a cleaning trolley with a full laundry bag, and a tense voice bring him up short.
The loud blaring ship horn in Sam's dream became raised voices on the stairs. A low sound. A long pause. Sam's eyes grew heavy. Then, 'Don't you walk away from me, Dean! Dean!' Sam heard Dean's door close. He rolled over, too sleepy to try to understand, only able to register the tension. His eyelids grew heavy again and his eyes felt sore, so he closed them. He drifted off on clouds of blackness only to be startled awake again by lights on his wall. His heart sang. Cas must be back! Cas, back with his flashlight to push bravely on through the dark of Dean's defenses armed with baby pictures, codes, secrets! The light receded and an engine growled. Sam blinked himself awake. The lights were white, not yellow. Headlights. He heard their car drive off down the street.
“Dude! We're not 12 anymore!” Dean just laughs again and elbows Cas out the door. Cas closes it behind them as Sam leans out the window. “Just get me an apple and a sandwich.”
'What plans?' The hope on Sam's face sank back into wherever it had come from. Dean hated seeing it. So he lied.
'Alright. Hey, look, Cas' house has those moving reindeer.' Dean pointed at the lawn next door, which was covered in decorations; reindeer, Santa, a sled, even a few elves. 'They really went all out, huh?' Dean looked amused, but Sam felt a little sad. Their own house was so dark next to the gaudy display next door. He was jealous, even if he knew the lit-up Santa was a bit cheesy. 'You okay?' Dean asked, concern in his voice. Sam hated making Dean worry.
Cas burst out laughing. It was a rare event. Dean savored the sound and hoarded the vision of Cas' happiness. 'Francois?' Cas asked.
'Whoa! Whoa, no! No, I'm good!' Dean lifts his arm to block. 'Seriously.' He clears his throat. It feels like he swallowed a pound of cotton balls. 'No need to whale on me, Cas.'
Dean stepped up behind Cas and reached around him for the coffeepot. He briefly rested his other hand on Cas' hip, and that was, of course, when Sam walked in with a newspaper and cleared his throat.
'Isn't it something,' Bobby quipped, picking up a fry, 'the zoo is this huge attraction and all kids really want to do is play on the playground.'
Jess' house and yard were a hive of color and motion. Kids and adults alike were criss-crossing the yard and riotous laughter sounded above the babble. The sky was waiting impatiently for fireworks. Jess and Sam were eating hot dogs at a table with Jess' out-of-town cousins, talking about nothing in particular. Jess' tongue was purple from the grape soda and Sam wanted to paint himself that exact shade. He wiggled his bare feet in the grass. A gaggle of younger kids ran past shrieking and waving tiny American flags at one another. Underneath their shrill jubilation Sam heard the unmistakable roar of the Impala's engine. He swiveled his head, looking for the source of the sound.
It was long. Though it was only eight weeks, it seemed endless. Sam loved Uncle Bobby and Aunt Ellen and Jo but he missed home. He missed Dean, he missed his friends, he even missed his school. After the first few days, filled with phone calls and letters and unpacking, he got to go to school with Jo and Charlie for the tail-end of the school year. They spent all their time together; doing homework, watching movies, playing in the junkyard when Aunt Ellen wasn't there to scold them for it. Sam loved sitting in the old cars, the smell of leather and metal, the dusty air, the cracked windows. He, Jo, and Charlie would clamber all over the cars like they were a jungle gym until they got tired and would sit in one of the less-dilapidated cars to play cat's cradle or fold fortune tellers.
Soon after that, during one of John's rare weeks at home, Cas commandeered Dean to help him clear out the garden shed in his backyard and move in all his art supplies and a big wooden desk. Dean spent more time playing around with all Cas' brushes and paints and strange thin tools than he did helping, but Cas didn't mind. When they finished, Cas sat down at the desk and ran his hands over the smooth surface. 'I should break the place in.'
Dean narrows his eyes. 'Just go shepherd the newbie, Chuck, I'm not in the mood.' Chuck makes a face and shambles off. 'And you still have to clean this when you get back!'
Dean felt weight lifting from his shoulders. The pieces of himself that he had tried to evict came winging back home like passenger pigeons. The two boys stared at one another and felt their friendship realign and readjust. Dean let himself examine Cas, tried to chart the time they had lost in the changes he saw. Cas stared back, and for several moments they simply took one another in. Dean wanted to know everything about Cas' time away. He wanted to know where he had been, what he had done, about the people he had met. But it seemed so vast and irrelevant, and Dean knew they'd have as long as they wanted to catch up. All the anger was gone and the space between them was waiting to be filled. He finally spoke. 'Hey, at least we're square now. Well, sort of. My punch was way better.' His voice was shaky.
An hour later and they're halfway drunk. The band with the clever shirts are bashing away at their guitars in the corner, surrounded by a knot of dancing students, Sam among them. Dean doesn't dance, so he's leaning against the bar and laughing at Sam when a guy leans in next to him and says, 'What are you drinking?'
He turned the key and walked back to his car, the crumbs from the morning long gone, and drove over to Jimmy and Amelia's house. When he arrived, he noted that his parents' car was already in the driveway, and walked in with happy anticipation. As always, their house was bright, warm, and filled with people.
His mutant gigantor brother wraps him in a hug and claps him on the back. 'Hope you didn't totally lose it like the last time.'
“But Castiel,” Inias quipped through a huge grin, “Aren't you happy to have such honest and straightforward friends?”
John finally broke the silence. 'C'mon, Sammy. You're going to stay with your Uncle Bobby for a little while until I can get this mess straightened out.' He must've seen something in Sam's no-longer-sleepy expression because his voice softened as he added, 'Dean's okay. And this will all blow over soon. I promise.'
Hyun-Sook beamed at them and led them through the front door. “I can already tell you two are going to like Castiel. That's the next door neighbour on that side.” She pointed in response to their questioning looks.
'We'll see you and your brother soon, I'm sure.' Aunt Ellen smiled and patted Sam's cheek. Jo nearly cracked Sam's ribs with a bear hug.
Dean's hand came away from his face with a small amount of blood. He straightened up. Cas was so close he couldn't breathe. He could see Cas' eyelashes. He felt his face. It stung. 'I think it's just a small cut.' Cas' cold fingers touched Dean's now-swollen cheek. Dean jerked back as if electrocuted.
He followed his usual route down the stairs, avoided the creaky spots, stepped gingerly from step to step. He noted the signs of his father's homecoming; the huge leather jacket draped over the coat rack, the boots kicked off at the mat, the kitchen light on. Dean felt very small and distant all of a sudden, as if he had wandered into a stranger's house by accident and was staring around at all the personal debris carried in and deposited on the tides of someone else's life. Then his dad's chair scraped back, his familiar footsteps sounded in the next room, and Dean snapped out of it.
Castiel looked up from 'Common Tuberous Plants with Medicinal Properties.' 'I believe the roots are from the plant Wasabia Japonica.' He flipped the book around and held it up for Sam and Dean to see. Sure enough, there was a botanical print of the very same roots that were currently sitting on the table in the middle of the room.
At that moment, everyone in Birch Ridge woke up. Some yawned, turned over, and went back to sleep, some felt their hearts pounding with an unknown anxiety, some wondered what had woken them, and some simply waited calmly for sleep to return. Babies fussed. Dogs barked or howled briefly.
Gabe shielded himself from the flying flour. “Watch it, Master Chef, you're gonna re-dust the counters!”
Crowley noticed Dean staring and sniggered. 'Can't wait to see just desserts doled out. Snooty writer and his spoiled kids.'
Dean couldn't choke back a laugh and it shattered the silent peace. Cas' eyes flew open. At first confused, then comprehending. He groaned. Bright red and green boxers with decals of snowflakes and candycanes stared out at the scene.
Cas' face fell. He chewed his lower lip. 'She's alright. She still hears voices but I think she's stopped believing they're angels. She keeps talking about the end of the world. She says she dreams about it all the time. Last time we visited she said, “Cas, what would you do if you were going to die tomorrow?”'
'It's alright. I really only did it for my parents. What can I say? It's useful. For instance,' he leans in closer to Dean. 'I know exactly where all your sweet spots are.' Dean shivers a little, and knows Aaron felt it. 'Come back to my room?' Aaron says, quietly. Dean can barely hear him over the music. Dean glances at Sam, then back at Aaron. And, for a second, he sees the brightest blue eyes. He shakes his head a little, and Aaron is still looking at him searchingly. Dean sighs.
Dean can already feel his head clearing, but there's a dull ache in his chest. Everything sort of fades as he splits the avocado with a knife, whacks his blade into the stone, and twists it out. He knocks the stone off on the edge of the sink and the impact reverberates up his arm and makes him feel sick. He cuts the avocado into quarters neatly, cleanly, thinking of surgery and scalpels. He digs his thumbs between the skin and the flesh and the avocado separates effortlessly. He feels brutal. He feels lost. He cleans it all, chops it all up into little pieces, pours it into the pan, and somehow, alchemically, violently, all of his horror becomes a meal that he will put on a plate and take in to his brother, who needs it. Who needs him.
Dean nodded tersely and hoisted the box in his arms. The three of them started walking back toward Dean's house. Dean kept his eyes on the box as he walked. The quarter sticks of dynamite stared up at him accusingly, their glaring, unapologetic promise of danger somehow made silly by the addition of a number of glittery, highly-colored fireworks.
Dean had never heard his name spoken with that much venom. It made him want to fight. His entire body craved it. He emptied himself of emotion and said, 'What's it look like?'
'She'll be okay, she'll just have a wicked bruise,' Kevin tells Dean. 'She's tough.' Dean chews his lip and nods.
'Hi,' he says, voice coming out more unsteadily than he meant it to. 'I thought everyone had gone home.'
As the gear shift shivered in his grip with the chugging of the engine, Castiel pictured strangers next door colonising the old porch swing, altering the eternal smell of tiger balm and herbs in the house. He'd miss the kindly presence next door, the music floating through the windows, the warm glow of friendship and belonging. Castiel's stomach growled and he had to suppress a feeling of loss. It wasn't as if she was going far. She'd still be nearby.
When the aftershocks had finished rippling through his body, he looked down at Cas and wondered what – Cas pulled back and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and fuck if that wasn't the hottest part of the whole thing. Dean threw his head back and let out a satisfied noise that made Cas chuckle. He reached down and pulled at Cas until Cas wiggled his way up and sprawled across Dean, whose pants were still down. Whatever. He was too heavy and relaxed to pull them up and who really cared anyway?
Dean spends a lot of time watching Castiel too (when he’s distracted of course). He is shy with the fans who came to ask for his autograph, he appears confident to the casual observer but Dean could see a simmering nervousness. Somehow Dean had forgotten he was with a famous person. Castiel seemed so normal. He would be a good role model for Ben.
The phone chimes again, this time it is Meg. Cas settles into the sofa lost in text conversations with Meg and Dean. He loses half the evening that way.
‘Oh hey, did you guys see that Jack is doing a tour of his new album? He’s coming to town next month!’ Beth waved a flyer excitedly in her face.
‘I’ve checked. He’s still alive. He’s 130 years old. Must still have some remains of god energy in him.’
He puts his hands in his pockets as he stands. ‘I’ve got to go again on Tuesday, this trip was shorter than I hoped. But I’ll be back again soon. Or you’re welcome to come to LA?’ Dean looks up, hopeful.
He nodded in agreement to her suggested and then sat quietly and reflected on his wife’s suggestion, noting the glaring omission.
Surprisingly, Dean is not one of those people. Nor his family. They welcome him in easily, moving aside to make an easy slot for him.
‘Not too weird playing third wheel to true love’s young dream?’ Cas had told her about the engagement.
Dean hangs back as they enter The Roadhouse, he’s a bit overwhelmed if he’s being honest. All those people. He’s responsible for most of their deaths. They aren’t going to want to see him.
He’s washing his hands when the lights start to flicker. What? There aren’t supposed to be ghosts or demons here. Then the roof starts to shake. Oh. He forgot about angels. What do the dicks want now.
‘Nah, we’ve lived together before remember. You need a friend to help you back into the swing of things. Get over Meg, if you want to?’
Cas scrolls hesitantly. He doesn’t want to choose something that will put the others who wanted action off. He settles on a compromise, a silly action/adventure, with a meet cute, rom com ending. He always loved Romancing the Stone and is so glad the remake was so true to the tone of the original. It definitely has nothing to do with the lead actor.
Just my thoughts on how The Winchesters could fix the end of Supernatural. Wishful thinking, I’m sure, but you never know.
Dean strides forwards and grabs Cas’ coat again but this time pulls Cas into him. The corporeal form disappears and Dean is surrounded by Cas in his true form, feeling the love from Cas’ grace pervade every atom of his body. It is overwhelming and yet the most comforting feeling he has ever had, like coming home.
Some of the light left his eyes. ‘That’s the plan Claire. I’m cutting back on touring. I’ve had enough of living out of hotels. I never go home. I want to see more of you before you’re all grown up and off doing your own thing. And I want to do it here, not in LA, not for one day at a time.’
He strides over and punches Cas in the Cas. Cas stands and takes it. Barely reacts. Dean had forgotten how painful punching an angel could be. It’s heaven so his hand doesn’t actually break. But it still hurts like hell. That doesn’t seem right, he looks at Cas. Sees amusement glint in his eyes. Sadist.
Dean helped get his bags from the trunk before the driver departed leaving the two men on the front step.
‘Always!’ Dean dons a baseball cap along with the shades, pulls a jacket on and turns up the collar.
‘Sorry Cas. I’ve been looking for a break in this case for what feels like forever. But I think I’ve just found one.’
Sam walked him to the piano with a microphone. The pianist got up as Dean hit a long note that required silence.
‘I can tell, she’s very good. Just like you.’ Cas can feel warmth creeping up his neck. Dean learn forward conspiratorially. ‘Never tell Sam, but you would have been a good Dead Man Walking.’
‘Did you hear that Rowena? He ruined our evening. Never mind the fact that he’s not mentioned that he’s a world famous reclusive song writer. Nor the fact that he just performed that song live in front of thousands of people without even blinking. Or how about the fact that it doesn’t sound anything like that when Sam sings it. But it’s ok, he’s sorry for ruining our night.’
‘Yes Dean. You could. But when people find me, and they see Claire, and they find her adoption records. It will only complicate things.’
‘No. But I think maybe someone might want to use her. She’s not quite a nephilim, but we had a look, she has some latent power.’
‘I remember the day I met Dean. He didn’t like me. I had come into the studio where he had been writing and practising. Made some suggestions. He got mad at me. Spilled coffee all over the equipment, there were actual sparks flying around and then he killed the power for the whole building.’ Claire gasped, Cas chuckled.
Sam and Dean took the opportunity to kick back and take some time away from constant work. They seemed to get ten years younger within about a day. Dean was relishing seeing Claire and Jack together again.
‘Oh. Hello Baby.’ Dean doesn’t seem to know what to do with himself, he half laughs, then goes red. He hides this by stalking round to the driver’s side and getting in.
‘Cas, I’ve never heard you screw a song up ever! Now go!’ Sam shoved him towards the steps. The gate opened and he was propelled up by Sam behind him.
They reached the stadium just before Jack came on stage. He showed their lanyards to the bouncer at the stage door.
Cas dropped his coffee mug, smashing it and throwing coffee all over himself. Claire arrived just as the waitress rushed over.
He woke up in a hospital room. Sam slumped in a chair next to him, asleep. Machines beeping all around him.
Dean looks at her again. She’s hot. Usually he would be all over this. He could have her if he wanted. If he wanted ...
Dean got up and followed Cas outside. He didn’t say anything but just say in a chair next to Cas as he stood staring at the grass. He was still as a statue.
Dean makes an appearance down the stairs at that moment, still wet and wearing nothing but a towel. ‘Cas do you mind… oh hey Ben, how was your trip? You get to see any bears?’
Dean looked around. ‘Well this isn’t the bunker. Is this... no it can’t be.’ He started to run his hands through his hair anxiously.
They lounged on the sofa chatting about Ben and his role in the film, about how he was doing at school, Lisa’s business, Dean’s work. Everything but the important topic of their relationship.
A whisky chaser and a beer bottle are placed in front of him by Ellen. ‘Best thing about heaven, no hangovers.’
‘I have my sources.’ Gabriel comments mysteriously, taking a sip from Cas’ glass, making appreciative noises. ‘This is nice.’
‘You are so beautiful.’ Dean whispers. ‘I couldn’t do it without you Cas. It’s why I ended up here.’ His voice breaks.
‘Ooh is this the mighty John Winchester I’ve heard so much about then? Well well well, Mary you found yourself a fine specimen there my dear.’
He pulled out his phone and found the article. He sat on a bench in the park that separated his house from Sam’s. He devoured the words quickly. Then sat back stunned.
Cas gets engrossed in work again for a few weeks. One day it all comes to a head and Cas walks out, quits on the spot. Calls Dean.
The whole building shook and the light blinded them as Michael’s grace flared, then died. John slumped to the floor.
‘Things change Dean.’ Cas snapped back. This was a recurring theme of their conversations. All of a sudden the ease between them evaporated.
She heard shuffling behind her as Dean walked in rubbing sleep from his eyes. ‘Is there coffee?’ He really was like a bear in the morning sometimes. She pointed at the cup set out ready for him. ‘Life saver!’ She got finger guns. That meant he was nervous.
When Cas is finished in the shower Dean knocks on the door and hands him a fresh shirt and a package of new boxers and socks. ‘I don’t want those back dude.’
They had raised two children together. Lived and worked together for years. Knew everything there was to know about the other and still enjoyed one another’s company.
He thinks Becky is just being her usual brand of crazy when she turns up at his house in the middle of the day the following week. Her eyes are wild and her hair is all over the place. Her face is red and puffy.
The weekend before principle filming began, Dean decided he needed a night out. He called Cas and suggested they go for dinner. Jack and Ben were spending the night with another friend they had made on set at a sleepover.
Dean relaxed, leaning back in his chair. Cas hated to spoil the moment. But he knew he had to say something.
A tight smile and a slight nod of her head with a tilt of her glass back. They both resume contemplation of their drinks.
‘Why are you in a hotel this time?’ Cas hadn’t thought about it before. He recalls Dean usually stays with Sam and Eileen.
‘Hey Cas, Claire, nice to see you both. This is my niece Anna. My brother and his wife are visiting. We thought we would give them a break, get some ice cream.’
All around Claire could hear whispers asking how they had managed to get the band to play. General consensus was that the band employed for the prom knew them.
‘I haven’t had a girlfriend in a long time.’ Dean looked down at his glass, ‘not sure love is for me. It never works out well.’
They passed the day mostly lounging by the pool in the sun. Relaxing with his family was just what Dean needed. Sam and Jack arrived just before lunch. They didn’t stay for long, heading off mid afternoon to run errands.
Before long, Sam piped up, ‘Nothing on Michael, but I think I’ve found a case.’ He turns the laptop to show Dean. Dean barely skims it.
How could he be so stupid to fall for his best friend. Who happens to be one of the most desired people on the planet. Who apparently likes guys but doesn’t like Dean. For the love of god! Dean punched his door. It barely made a dent in the wood but the pain bloomed in Dean’s knuckles.
Dean looks at himself in the mirror, he has to agree with his son. Maybe he’ll meet a woman at the bar. Perhaps he should go on a date. Lisa never seems to be home. Maybe they’re right, it is time he dated. He was the one who called time on the marriage. He doesn’t know how to move on. He sighs and resigns himself to awkward small talk. Best case scenario, he’ll maybe make another friend.
‘Come on Cas, it’s nearly time.’ Cas could see Dean starting to look worried on the stage, looking around for Sam.
‘Is that her new business venture. I was wondering. She’s tried a few different things so I hear. She must think you have a good chance.’
‘I’ll go.’ Sam and Dean immediately start objecting. Dean Jr may be Sam’s son but he’s never had to deal with a world where Chuck controlled everything.
After some extensive cajoling by Cas, Dean agreed to a helicopter trip over the Grand Canyon. He was almost sick getting into the helicopter. ‘I can’t do this Cas. Nope. Nothing is worth getting into this death trap.’
‘Not sure, Jack said he came to bed really late last night, tossed and turned, then got up early. His car’s gone, but his stuff is still here, he can’t have gone far.’
He steps out of the car and gathers his things, waves once and strides off to the rear of the garage.
‘Ok then, someone who wants to get god like powers. You say Rowena thought someone was trying to change things in the past. Did she pin it down to when?’
After Cas left Dean alone, he got angry. He couldn’t do what he normally did to blow of steam, take Baby out for a long drive to clear his head. So instead he broke down.
This was her first stadium gig too. His little girl wasn’t so little anymore. He stared after her as she got into Beth’s car, leather jacket and heavy eyeliner done just so. He sighed and shut the door, sent a text to his adopted son.
He wakes up to a slammed door. When he comes downstairs Eileen is red faced. She doesn’t see him come in so he waves at her to attract her attention. Tears start to flow when she sees him.
Ben and Jack wolf down the cookies and soon start a game of soccer. Dean has forgotten what it’s like to have that much energy.
Amara has been by a few times and he’s managed a sunny disposition with her for an hour or two. They’ve kissed a few more times, but it’s gone no further than that.
He and Cas text occasionally about Claire, it’s friendly, but they are almost back to the limited contact of the past few years.
‘I’m not sure. It’s not every day I get to spend my free time with a film star.’ Cas grimaces at that. Great start. Get it together Dean.
He follows the directions and finds himself at the First Class Lounge. The person at the door is impeccably dressed. He’s a mess by comparison and feels seriously under dressed.
Cas arrives at the hotel and checks in before Dean. They’ve booked adjoining rooms. Cas waits for Dean to arrive, strangely apprehensive.
And then the call came. A Hollywood film. Ben was 13 by then. The part looked like it was practically written for him. Dean went along with Ben to the casting. He got a call back the next week. And then the week after. And then the director flew over from LA to meet him.
Sam continued, ‘Eileen and I have been looking for it for years. Figured if we could get in here, maybe we could adapt it, get into the Empty…’ he trailed off, a pained expression on his face.
Dean finds himself sat at the bar alone, Sam has gone to find his home, apparently Eileen should be along soon, he thinks she’ll be there. That’s ok too, he didn’t expect for Sam to babysit him.
He heads over to Sam and Eileen’s place for dinner that weekend. Eileen needs some company. Sam is working on a big case and is stressed out. She’s hoping a change of scene will calm him down.
‘It was at a time when being gay was less accepted. I have to have these occasional ‘relationships’, like with Meg. As cover.’
It wasn’t one Cas had written. She’s right. It’s certainly one of the angrier songs Dean has ever written. It was not long after Cas moved out.
The evening ends up with all the instruments out, Cas on the piano, Claire on guitar and Dean on vocals, making a real racket, covering everything from stomping glam rock to 80s power ballads.
Some of his usual ‘decor’ (read guns on the wall) remain, but the rest of the room looks, well, cosy. The bed is bigger, there’s a thick quilt and comfy looking pillows. The practical, basic, military style necessities are gone and replaced with luxuries.
‘Well Jack was great, but then I had to sit through this pair of old men as well. To be honest, they were freaking awesome.’ Sam turns around to see a grin on his brother’s face, his eyes lit up in happiness for the first time in months as he opens his arms to Claire.
He grabs him into a hug. ‘Cmere dude.’ His face is smashed into Cas’ shoulder. Cas isn’t the best hugger, sort of grabs Dean by his drenched coat and pats his back.
After that Dean and Lisa, surprisingly, remained friends. But Cas could not forgive her. He was frosty when she came to the house. Eventually she stopped coming.
John and Mary are relaxing in the library, John picking Mary’s brain for information about the things he has missed in the boys’ lives.
Cas was thinking about Balthasar. About his other abortive attempts at dating before. He was trying to think of an actual serious date he had been on, and he was struggling to find anything note worthy in the last ten years.
‘Wow, way to say I have a stick up my butt.’ He flips the pancake he’s working on, then adds it to the growing stack.
Cas had found a new apartment before he left for the trip and was moving they day after he got home. He had meant to tell Dean while they were away, but forgot when they were caught up in the relaxation of the trip.
He gets into the taxi, spends the journey lost in thought. He gets out of the car in a daze, not paying much attention to his surroundings whilst searching in his pockets for his keys.
Her boyfriend, Bobby, turned up at just the right time. He was trying to get into law school so was stressed all the time. She grabbed him as he patted her head on the way past.
Dean finished the beer he was holding and put it back on the bar. His thirst quenched. His buzz gone.
The rest of the day passed in somewhat awkward silence punctuated by conversation over essentials like lunch and who was collecting Claire. Dean went for a long walk amongst the vines in the valley, trying to clear his mind and work out how to talk to Cas again.
After Tess talked him through the people she had in mind, one person seemed to be the obvious choice. She promised to set up a meeting for him with Charlie the following week.
‘No hotel man, stay here. Ben’s room is never used. You need somewhere to call home not a stark hotel room.’
Cas packs up his truck quickly the following morning, once breakfast has kicked in and made him feel more human, he’s keen to get going and make it to the city between morning and evening rush hour. He’s checked his route on his phone and is reviewing the map he brought as a back up when Dean saunters into the kitchen.
Rowena gave up on her attempt to persuade Cas to come to yoga, ‘I cannot handle downward dog today. I may vomit.’ And left shortly after.
The figure on the floor makes a strangled noise, but it’s different from before. He’s not fighting Sam any longer.
The next morning Claire was surprised that her alarm woke her up. Since Dean had been staying he had been enjoying waking her up by flinging open her curtains and declaring ‘Morning sunshine,’ as loudly and obnoxiously as possible. She knew it was an act, he was doing it just to get at her, he hated mornings usually!
‘Do you know what she told me? That you had contacted her about buying that place too. Said to keep it a secret from me. Why?’
‘He’s in heaven. He can’t come down here and he doesn’t want me there. So you know what, I’ll  do just what he wants me to. He’ll wish he never said that to me. Stupid son of a bitch doesn’t want me, I’ll show him.’
He turned back to Cas. ‘Sorry, you know’, and gestured outside, ‘See you soon, man’. With a slap on Cas’ shoulder he strode out the door.
‘I didn’t mean it like that.’ Cas smiled, ‘when you guys started you were so nervous about writing and your sound. You know the industry so well after all this time, you’ve both grown so well. I know it hasn’t always been easy but I think you’re both comfortable with it now. It shows in your writing.’
‘I was not your biggest fan at the start Sam, I will admit. But once I got to know you and understood your problems and we helped you to work through everything, it turned out ok.’
He went slowly upstairs and methodically packed bags for himself and Ben. He was loading them in the car when Ben arrived home from school.
Beth’s twin, Ben (their parents weren’t overly inventive with names) grabbed it excitedly. ‘We have to go,’ he announced.
‘Dean doesn’t talk about his family much in interviews anyway, I don’t even know if he’s ever mentioned he’s got a brother let alone named Sam. He’s very private, for all the gossip spread about him.’
About 18 months after they’ve moved, Ben asks about going for an audition. He’s been taking drama classes and loving it. His teacher praises him endlessly. The audition goes well and he gets a guest star spot on an established TV series. It’s only a few episodes initially but gets expanded. Sam goes along as tutor.
Their performance the next day was in LA. Cas arranged for Claire to go to a sleepover with a friend and decided to drop by to watch the show. He didn’t tell Dean.
Applause sounded. Dean was beetroot coloured. Gabriel wolf whistled. Castiel beamed. When the clapping quietened Cas leant over and whispered into Dean’s ear, ‘Dean Winchester is my hero. I could not have put it better myself.’ Dean is pleased that the lighting is low so no one can see the purple colour his ears turned.
Of course Cas chose the moment when Dean was cooking dinner for Ben and Lisa to arrive to collect his things.
He was covered in people within seconds. Beer flowed and he spent time with his loved ones, enjoying their company in a way he thought he never had before. Free from any outside stress or pressure.
The atmosphere shifted. Things became tense. They all decided to head to bed rather than address the elephant in the room.
Sam, however, is a different matter. Ben worships him and talks about him every day the week leading up to his visit, what they’re going to do, where he wants to take Sam. Dean indulges Ben. He’s excited too.
Three years after moving Ben drops out of school before making it to graduation. Dean wasn’t keen and asked Sam to talk him out of it, but Sam talked Dean around to the idea.
‘He’s got a son. He’s on good terms with his ex. He’s selfless, a bit awkward.’ Dean can see the warmth blossoming from Sam when he speaks about his friend. He hears the door open, glancing up although he doesn’t know who he’s looking for. His heart comes into his mouth. Sam’s words fade.
‘I’m so sorry for the misunderstanding.’ She spluttered. Cas nodded and pulled out, following after Dean and Claire.
Dean starts to try and argue, but Jack speaks firmly over him, ‘I can let you look. But you won’t be able to do anything.’
Even Dean has to agree that the view was worth it. He’s smiling at Cas’ exclamation at the beauty and commentary about things they were seeing (adding to the pilot’s explanation with little snippets of detail). Cas had a beam a mile wide by the time they set back down.
He grabs his jacket and stalks outside. He’s halfway to the tree line following Cas when he realised he still doesn’t totally get what the problem is. Does Cas not like Benny? He doesn’t think they’ve met. Is it the guy thing? Claire?
Cas remains sat at his desk trying to calm his breathing. He texts Sam to arrange a meeting the next day while he packs his things to head home.
‘Uh, thanks Cas I guess. I thought you would pick holes in it. It’s not like it would sound if you were still around.’
‘Thank you for listening to my woes. Sorry I can’t stick around. Have a good evening.’ He stands up off the bar stool.
‘As you’ve got a new writing partner, I thought it would be good to tell you know, I’m retiring. Moving to the vineyards.’
Cas wins every round hands down. They start giving him whisky chasers with his beer to slow him down, but nothing has an effect.
Cas swallows. Now he knows why Dean has been a bit quiet lately. He’s obviously been spending time with his gorgeous girlfriend and her son. His little family. That Cas is not a part of.
‘Right, just so I’m clear.’ Dean cackled, ‘Can we go now? Heading off to try and find some dolphins today.’ He smiled like an excited kid.
'No, you're not,' says Chuck reasonably, supporting her and staggering to the back door. Dean stares after them anxiously.
Somehow, that tiny movement clanged with a huge, unspeakable rejection. Dean's distaste was magnified as if his clarity were a prism. The beam of it blasted out from him and made Bela's hungry desires look crude and flimsy. She bristled at the sting of it.
'Hey.' He turns to Chuck and Kevin, who stop snarking at each other to listen. 'What do you think of the new guy?
“Sick?” Dean pauses. “He was in the hospital. Anyone would look a little sick. Hospitals smell like pee. And they're full of...sickness.”
Next door to Castiel, Bones gave a startling whuff and then barked properly, once. Sam blinked his eyes and adjusted the headphones of his white noise machine. Dean, though awake, kept his eyes closed, holding on to a warm feeling from a dream that had vanished as soon as he had woken. He tried to hang on to that sense of calm deep in his chest – a feeling of being loved, of comfort, of home. He chased the feeling back into sleep again.
'I do.' Cas looks uncomfortable, like he's steeling himself for something. 'I could show you, if you want.'
“Is that Cas?!” Another voice rang out. Castiel's twin joined Gabe at the counter, grinning and stirring something floury in a big metal bowl. Puffs of fine powder rose up and settled on his forearms.
Ah. Dean supposed that made sense. 'So you looked at the mags and – what? Decided you were a Cosmo girl? Why - ' he shuddered ' - Cosmo?'
'No, no, nothing like that, relax. We just haven't spent much time together lately. Quick phone calls once or twice a week don't really do it. I miss having my brother around.'
Hyun-Sook tapped her nose and winked at him. “The girl scouts didn't do a huge amount for me but it sure taught me all I needed to know about knots. Anyway, I'll leave you boys to get settled in. My number is on the fridge if you need anything, and you can always just knock on Castiel's door, he knows this place like the back of his hand.”
From his room, Dean heard the car pull up in the driveway. The growl of the engine was unmistakable. For no discernible reason, he thought of the circle of spruce trees in the park down the block, a space where sounds were muted and the air smelled like autumn all the time. He considered going back to sleep, wrapping the quilt and his own body heat around himself and nodding off to the sounds of his dad getting settled. He felt unresolved, though, and he knew he needed to see his dad in person.
'Follow me.' He checks to see that Cas is behind him, blotchy cheeks and all. He walks back to the kitchen and through it, shaking his head warningly when Kevin opens his mouth, and leads Cas out the back, to the deserted smoking area. Cas relaxes against the wall and closes his eyes, taking deep breaths. Dean leans against the wall next to him. The bricks are warm and damp and smell like clay. There's a private sort of silence between them while Cas collects himself. They just stand in the sun, breathing in the smell of fresh air and almost-rain. Dean relaxes and lets his head fall back against the wall. He watches the sky and listens to Cas' breathing return to normal next to him. After a minute or two, he turns to Cas, who's looking at him. Dean feels winded by those eyes. The sunlight makes them brighter, somehow. Clearer. Dean feels happy and peaceful for no real reason, and he can't help smiling a little.
“Sore. But functional.” Cas sits up. It takes more effort than he's used to. The nurse walks around to the side of his bed and examines him.
Jimmy's voice sounded in his ear as Inias undid his apron and walked out. “Hi, it's me. Are you busy?”
He winces and briefly considers pretending that he didn't hear and hiding in the walk-in. Stupid fleeting thoughts. Why should he let Naomi put him off? He wheels around.
“Fu – heck no. Well, not unless you call trekking around the county an adventure. I just want to get to know my home a bit better. It's shocking what you miss with walls in the way.”
They have a rare day of quiet. No cases crop up, no calls come through, nothing happens. Sam and Dean stay in their rooms until almost noon, so Cas wanders through the different rooms of the bunker and tries to take stock. He finds a stained wooden trunk that he can't open, several untitled spell books with handwritten notes in the margins, a box of beautifully carved bullets, and more than a few spiderwebs. He's walking back to his room to figure out what the bullets are for when he walks into Dean, wet from the shower and wearing only a towel. He tries not to look too closely but that sheer expanse of skin seems to be drawing his eyes as if by magnetic force.
“That's what I said!” Dean exclaimed. “You should've seen Sam trying to figure out the shower though, I haven't laughed so hard since.”
His traitorous feet brought him to Jessica's house. It was a beautiful suburban house just like all beautiful suburban houses, just like Dean's beautiful suburban house. A paper house. A paint by numbers house with a paint by numbers garden and, Dean imagined, a paint by numbers family. He stood on the green, green lawn and looked into the dining room window. The scene was framed like a photograph or one of those what's-wrong-with-this-picture placemats that kid-friendly diners always had on the tables. Dean watched his brother smile contentedly in the middle of someone else's Thanksgiving, someone else's family. Dean felt like he was dissolving into sore, soggy pieces. The night air hummed. The bottle of whiskey sloshed. The happy family was happy. Dean turned and walked back the way he'd come.
And with that, Sam pulled Cas into the living room. By the time Dean came back in with cereal, bowls, milk, and spoons, Sam had opened the tin of cookies and he and Cas were sorting the presents by name. The shadow was almost gone from Cas' face.
After his parents left, Cas and Jimmy sat down in the kitchen while Amelia listened to Claire talking about feather patterns.
Cas unzipped his sleeping bag and padded over to where his sketchbook lay on top of his shoes in the hall. He came back shivering and dove into the synthetic fabric, then shuffled through to find the right page. He handed it to Dean, who took it with a sense of awe.
Dean looked down at the pile of Toobers & Zots. He pushed half the pile over to Cas, who sat down and picked up a handful of foam circles.
He feels empty when Dean isn't looking at him, but his stomach feels so full it almost hurts. The two feelings don't sit well together. He drinks a glass of water and pictures the bread expanding in his stomach like a sponge. He feels like he's choking even though he knows he isn't.
Sam darted past the moving van, up the porch steps, and into the house in front of Cas. He slipped through to the living room and pointed Cas upstairs to Dean's room. Cas braced himself and walked up the stairs. Sam didn't blame him. He didn't envy anyone who had to approach Dean in the mood he was in without armor and a cattle prod. He waited, tense, until he hard a soft knock, then muffled voices. He couldn't help it, he was curious. He crept up the stairs and stood at the door to his room, where he could hear.
'There you are. Castiel, this is Dean. Dean, meet one of our newest. Castiel is joining accommodation today.'
It was true. After Mary's death, Dean's well had dried up. It was an Indian summer without all the romantic connotations. It was a scorching hell of a time for Dean where he felt lost and depleted. Too dry to respond with a splash when people dropped him words. His voice stuck its nose out the door, smelled the burning tar, and went back inside. Turned on the air con and watched the home shopping network. Dean wasn't confused or stupid. It wasn't like he was somehow disconnected. He was just on screensaver. What people said didn't register, and Dean didn't want anything to register, so he wrapped himself in a blanket of not-here-be-back-soon. Recently, he had started to say the odd word every once in a while, but mostly he felt happy to watch and wait.
Cas was taken aback by his candour. To fill the silence, he pointed at the top arm of the cross. 'So what do those cards say? You haven't talked about them yet.'
Amelia made a large T sign with her hands and raised her eyebrows questioningly at Cas, to which he nodded. She left to make a pot of tea and Claire came back into the room, hauling a bird book that looked as if it weighed more than her. She plonked it laboriously in his lap and started flipping through the pages, chatting animatedly.
And that was how he found himself sprawled on the torn up couch in Crowley's poster-plastered garage playing a high-stakes game of spin the bottle. Well, spin the can. Meg turned the volume of the deafening music down a bit. The garage was crawling with people, all of them drinking the cheap beer that Crowley had pinched from his oblivious parents, and the thumping bass made conversation near-impossible. Somehow, a group of about ten of them had started up a game that was a mashup of puff puff pass and spin the bottle. Dean had scoffed at them for being immature, but then understood: It wasn't about kissing, it was about sex. Dean was awed by the gravity of it and the disregard they all had for something the rest of the world considered to be so serious. He wanted to self-destruct and scorn the rules, too. So he had joined in.
'I'll pick you up at six. Now. What food do you have in this place, short stuff? You look too hobbled to feed yourself.'
Dean slammed the giant leather-bound volume he was reading ('Mimicking the Human Form: A Study of Shapeshifting Mutations') shut and pinched the bridge of his nose. 'I got nothin'. Tell me you found something.'
“Does Cas look different to you?” Cas hears his name and stops. He doesn't want to walk in if they want to discuss him. He should turn around and come back later. He should. But he doesn't.
'You ARE. I'll come say hi but I actually came to get you. Come over for a bit.' Cas perked up at the suggestion and Dean couldn't hold back a smile. A nice smile this time, although it would go back to a teasing one A.S.A.P. because holy hell, Cas in a themed sweater was hysterical.
A couple days later, when the car and the moving van pulled out, Sam stood at the end of the driveway alone except for Cas' dad standing at the curb. They didn't look at each other. Dean's curtains were closed and Sam was trying not to cry as he watched the car filled with half a family drive away. Cas twisted around in his seat and waved. Sam waved back. The car disappeared. The sound of the moving van faded into the distance. Sam couldn't bring himself to go back inside. He and Cas' dad stood there. Not waiting. Waiting.
Cas doesn't answer. He nods and stays silent, and Dean is grateful. Cas sits on the stool and watches as Dean beats the frosting into submission, tear included, until it's perfectly smooth and the whisk stands up in the bowl when Dean lets go of it. He watches as Dean places the cooling rack on top of the cake tin and flips them both upside down, carefully teasing the tin up and off the cake. He watches as Dean spreads the icing with a spatula, each stroke perfect. Dean feels self-conscious about the faint tear tracks on his face, but he doesn't want to draw attention to them by wiping them. He does not cry. He's not that person. He fills a sieve with icing sugar and whacks the side of it with unnecessary force to dust the top of the cake.
Dean walked back to his room on tiptoe, trying not to wake Sammy. When he got there he stared at the gift his dad had brought him. He felt bad. He felt something toxic creeping up inside him, refusing to dissipate. The gift made him sad, he couldn't help it, and the sadness welled up, all the more volatile and bittersweet for being streaked through with guilt. Dean shouldn't feel sad, he should feel grateful. His dad was home, he and Sam would be taken care of, and his dad had brought them Christmas presents. All Dean could see was his nine-year-old self excitedly dumping the toys out of the box and inviting Cas and Benny over to build things. It was like watching an old home video of someone who had died. Dean put the box in his closet and climbed out onto the roof with a blanket where his strange sickly feelings could get some air. The snow had mostly collected in the gutters, so Dean was able to find a dry patch of shingle to sit on. He wrapped the blanket around himself and stared at the sky. His stargazing was interrupted when the light in Cas's room turned on. Dean's favorite part of living next door to his best friend was how the windows in their rooms faced each other. Dean loved miming at Cas through the window, or raising his voice to call to his friend when his window was open. Cas was staring out at him, tousle-haired, like he had just rolled out of bed. Dean sniggered at Cas' disheveled appearance and waved.
'Hello again,' he smiled, and Cas did a double take. The man was gorgeous, and that was putting it mildly. Happily crinkling green eyes and freckles and broad shoulders. Jeans and a wrinkled blue shirt. He looked more like an off-duty cop than a psychic. He spoke again. 'I didn't expect to see you back so soon.'
Dean can't tell which is louder, the music or the conversation. The bartenders are buzzing around with laughter and smiles and hands full of drinks, and the atmosphere is more upbeat than Dean ever thought it could be in a bar. The chalkboard menu advertises the $2 shot of the night: Blow Jobs. Dean nudges Sam, points at the billboard, and sniggers. He doesn't even have to look at Sam to know his response is bitchface #9 (You're So Immature). He follows Sam, who is wading through the crowd like the enormous moose he is, heading toward the back, where a few scruffy girls and guys in novelty tees that say things like ' √(-1)  2(3)  ∑  π ...and it was delicious!' are setting up amps and guitars. They greet Sam warmly and shake Dean's hand.
When he woke in the morning, he sat bolt upright on his sleeping mat and scanned the room for Anael so fast it nearly gave him whiplash. 'Was it a dream?' he thought frantically. Jimmy and the others were still asleep, breathing deeply. But Anael wasn't there. Horrible dread crawled up his arms and lodged in the dark of his imagination. That knife had been so sharp. Where was she?
'Hey, you! Come give me a hug!' Ellen called. Dean smiled and wrapped his arms around her briefly, then around Bobby. John watched his son's face carefully. Dean was always smiling now, always easily affectionate and openly sincere. This made John anxious for two reasons. First, because seeing Dean so open was terrifying in a human way, like seeing a patient blithely awake for open-heart surgery, and knowing this made John think of how easy it would be for the scalpel to slip. Second, because John could never forget the period of nearly two years after Mary's death in which Dean had clammed up. It was a chafing razor's edge: Complete and utter vulnerability on one side, complete unreachable radio static on the other. Fear for his son and fear of his son pulled John's peace of mind in opposite directions and, even if he did not recognize all this himself, filled him with a vague sense of unease.
As they pull up out front, Sam and Jess crane their necks to see out the window. Cas is leaning against the front door, underneath the wooden sign saying:
'Yes you do. Thank me and accept it. If you don't I'll just drive you back to my place before work anyway.'
Castiel slid in his socks down the hallway to the stairs. This, he thought, was the best part of living alone. He could act as odd as he wanted and no one would ever know. He grabbed the banister and swung himself around to pound down the stairs and into the kitchen. He hummed as he  put the coffee on and watered all the plants. So many people had spoken of the dangers of bringing work home but Castiel couldn't help himself. He loved plants. Plants were odd and dependable and unique. They didn't just sit there like furniture, they breathed and moved and cleared the air of toxins. They followed their own rules and didn't let anyone push them around – put a cactus in peat moss? It would die out of sheer obstinacy. Plants knew where they belonged and acted accordingly: Most leafy things had more backbone than people did.
'We have one more stop to make,' Dean said, and a few minutes later they pulled up at a house that Sam didn't recognize. The downstairs lights were all on and Sam could tell there was a party going on; the driveway and the street out front were covered with parked cars.
It was just a normal room, oddly. A couple couches, a coffee table, a big window, a bookshelf. Cas looked over at the bookshelf, expecting to see titles like 'Palmistry for Dummies' or 'Healing Crystals' or 'The Miracle of Astral Projection.' Instead, it was filled with battered old novels. A lot of Vonnegut and Bradbury. A couple by Lovecraft, one by LeGuin, and an illustrated copy of The Hobbit. Stairway to Heaven. A book of concert photography. Nice. Cas turned around to see Dean staring at him curiously, so he broke the silence. 'This isn't what I was expecting.'
It turned out the monster was a Satori, a Japanese creature that appeared human and preyed on lone travelers. A carnivorous clairvoyant nut job that gained strength from sucking out others' thoughts and feelings. The only way to get the drop on it was to make your mind completely blank. Needless to say, the Winchesters failed spectacularly and would've been the thing's lunch if it hadn't been for Cas. The lore hadn't mentioned any special way of killing it but decapitating it while it choked the crap out of Cas seemed to do just fine.
Dean groans delightedly at the mention of garlic bread and his stomach grumbles in agreement. 'Did Jo reorganize my kitchen? Where is she?'
Jo grimaces when they reach the car and she has to sit down heavily in the passenger seat. 'Ahh. Okay.'
'...thank you, Dean.' Cas pretends he doesn't see through it like glass and Dean pretends not to hear the smile in Cas' voice.
Dean feigned half-hearted interest as he looked toward Cas, who had turned away from them. 'Looks like. And also, shut up.'
And with a chuckle, Dean was gone. Sam looked over at Dean's desk. He was dying to know, so he crossed the room with tentative steps. He flipped through Dean's books until something slipped out of one and fluttered onto the desk. Sam picked it up. It was a creased photograph that Sam recognized immediately. He, Dean, and Cas grinned up from the photo, their faces sun-burnt and sticky with melted popsicle juice. That was the day Dean and Cas had let Sam join in their game of truth or dare. Shortly after their dad had taken the picture, Sam had eaten about 15 popsicles on a dare and thrown up rainbows. Dean had laughed himself hoarse, even after Cas had whacked him for being insensitive. To make it up to Sam, Dean and Cas had let him pick all the pizza toppings when John ordered them dinner.
Dean nodded enthusiastically and grabbed the rocket ship he had been building, indicating all the bent parts. It was a twisted mess of wild imagination.
'Hey, I got you boys presents. A little late, I know.' John reached into the bag resting on one of the chairs and pulled out two packages wrapped in green and red paper. He handed one to Dean, who unpicked the taped edges. It was a set of strangely-shaped magnetic toys. A bit young for him, which gave Dean a pang in his chest, but it was the thought that counted. Dean did used to enjoy these kinds of building-block toys.
Cas' presence had the added bonus of softening Dean's rough edges. When their dad would go on one of his long-haul trips, Dean would stop smiling. He'd become tense and his sense of humor would dry up into something more biting and sarcastic. Sam worried when Dean bristled. He clung to the house, keeping his distance from Dean but not willing to let him out of sight, just in case. Having Cas around as a buffer took the edge off. It was as if he filled a gap in their family, a gap that Dean constantly tried to patch up. Castiel could spend a day dealing with Dean's insecure prickliness and remain completely unruffled, could even manage to look at Dean with something halfway between exasperation and fondness. Even then, it was hard for Sam when John wasn't there. As soon as their dad would pull up in the driveway, Dean would relax into silliness and start goofing off again. Sam's favorite part of dad being home was the feeling of freedom that came with the change in Dean's mood.
Dean knew what was supposed to happen. He was supposed to drop his gaze and say 'yes, sir.' But he wouldn't do it. He couldn't. He had had it with unswerving obedience. Dean's vision suddenly cleared: He saw John Winchester for who he was – a broken man, a man in mourning, a functional alcoholic, an absent father trying and failing to do his best. The fight drained out of Dean in a matter of seconds. He had nothing else to say, so he walked up the stairs.
“Would I ever!” Inias pulled out a raspberry turnover and bit into it with his usual enthusiasm. He made a noise of absolute satisfaction and washed the bite down with his coffee.
'Thank you for the cake. It was amazing. Do you...want to take it back? There's no way I could eat it all.'
. He pulled out card after card, unsure of whether he was actually feeling a pull toward them or if it was just his imagination. As he pulled them out, Dean lay them face up, card after card, until they formed a cross. One card in the middle, three cards fanning out in each of the four directions. Dean gathered the rest of the deck back up and set it aside. He stared at the cards. Cas watched Dean's eyes moving from card to card and fidgeted silently. Was he allowed to speak or was he supposed to sit here in reverential silence?
Under Castiel's careful tending, The Nursery had been reinvigorated. He had expanded the range of plants and supplies, added more greenhouses for keeping the plants in more specific conditions, and started offering short classes on alternative gardening. The Nursery had a good reputation in town; people said that the plants they got from Castiel were healthier, bloomed longer, and grew taller.
All through the winter of that year and into the early spring, the flashlight beams woke Sam up. At first it was strange, invasive, and interesting, but soon it became comforting. His brother and his friend lit up the night sky, flung their hearts into the dark chasm of nighttime, cast their thoughts into each others' windows like fishing lines baited with hope. Sam would stare sleepily at the lights and shadows making shapes on his walls and fall asleep to the silent sound of Dean mattering to someone. Sam didn't know Morse code but he thought he understood all the same.
Dean takes a deep breath and braces himself against the counter. He exhales through his mouth and tries to calm his suddenly racing heartbeat. He looks around for something, anything else, to focus on. His hand moves automatically to turn on the oven. The light clicks on and Dean sets it to gas 5. He's on autopilot now, his body has taken over, it's like a reflex at this stage. Dean chops apples and sees blood. He cracks eggs and he can feel his father's disappointment when he stabs a fork into the yolks. He takes it all (blood, disappointment, responsibility, loneliness) and buries it all beneath a circle of shortcrust. Then he glazes it with milk, scores it with a fork, and puts it in the oven. Shoves it to the back of his mind, that corner where nothing ever moves. And when it comes out 40 minutes later, it's sweet and clean and Dean feels like he's accomplished something, turned all this blackness in him into something useful, something helpful, something soothing.
“Because if you're not, what the fuck were you doing on Valentine's Day.” It's a statement, not a question. Cas begins to dread where this is going.
'Yes. The magazine listed typical actions that reveal romantic interest. The article said I should bring you flowers, compliment you, take you to dinner, and bring you a box of chocolates, among other things.'
'Do you? The others usually have experience in hotels before they come here. But I don't think you do.'
'No problem. It's all yours. You have a good night.' Cas nods beside him. Dean very carefully avoids looking at Cas while the men hoist the pallet and walk away. He feels the corners of his lips twitching again.
Sam would walk by Dean's room after school only to see Cas and Dean sitting in silence – Dean struggling with homework or playing a video game while Cas zoned out with his nose in a book or a pencil in his hand. Sam's Accelerated Reader buddy, Jess, asked if Cas lived with them. Sam laughed and told her that no, he was their next-door neighbor, but it made him think. Cas was over a lot. He hung out with Dean, he helped cook, he ate dinner with them, and he slept over at least a few nights a week, unless dad was home. Benny was over too, sure, but Cas soaked into their daily life like he had always been there which, Sam realized, he pretty much had.
Cas' room was as familiar to Sam as his own, but now, in the evening and in its current state, it looked completely different. It was gutted. Ordered chaos. An OCD bomb. Every drawer was open, every surface covered in folded clothes, rolled up posters, art kits, socks, tickets, photos, and shoes. Sam watched Cas move around the room like a zombie. An organized zombie. Michael walked by the open door with a heavy box in his arms, grumbling.
Cas nods and Dean knows that Cas knows that Dean doesn't want to talk about it. 'I was supposed to be off at seven, but one of the girls needed help finishing off her corridor. I think I've bleached off a layer of skin or two.' Cas looks at his hands. 'I was just leaving and...it smells delicious in here. Did I interrupt you?' He ends without voicing the implied question, and Dean answers.
Dean closes his eyes and leans his head back. 'Dad's car accident. I distracted him. Wrong place, wrong time kinda thing. If I had been driving, it would've been me instead.' He keeps his eyes closed, as if the darkness was a safety blanket. 'I'm a bad luck charm, Cas.'
Dean feels all the tension drain out of him as the machinery powers down. Everything whirs into silence except for the gentle hum of the freezers and fridges, and Dean can relax. Everyone has gone home, everyone has clocked out except for him. He wipes down the surfaces one last time, hands moving in familiar circular motions, and thinks about the day. Everything had gone smoothly after the morning. He had had to rush the sifting a little to make up for those precious lost minutes, but everyone was on the ball, and all the pastries were made in time for the banquet. Weddings. He shakes his head. Weddings are the worst. Everyone is high-strung, and everything always seems to go wrong.
'She's actually gone to see her parents. I think she wanted to give us some space for 'bonding' or something.'
Cas turned to face him head-on and nodded. 'Alright. I would like to let you know that I am romantically interested in you.'
'Fag,' she spat. Meg and Alastair surfaced long enough to stare, then went back to sucking face. Dean didn't flinch. It was like someone throwing a pebble at the Trojan horse. The ridiculousness of it made him laugh. It felt so good to find something genuinely funny that he only laughed harder.
Cas winces. 'I expected this job would be difficult, but I underestimated.' They've reached the car, a beige 80's job. Dean answers as they get in.
As soon as their dad would get home, Sam's mind would feel lighter and he'd run out of the house to play crocodile in the long grass by the park with Jess and the rest of them. On one particular day the sun was bright, the air was crisp, and Sam was the crocodile. He loved the feeling of the long grass brushing against him. He felt like an explorer, like the grass became some untouched jungle that existed for him to discover. He never felt alone; he could always hear the shouts and laughter of his friends. He stood stock still and closed his eyes, listening. Birdsong. Children playing in the distance. Wind through the grass. There, to his left, a rustle. He smiled, opened his eyes, and plunged in. Whoever it was shrieked in surprise and took off running. Before they could take more than five steps, Sam had his arms around them and got a faceful of curly blonde hair that smelled like cinnamon and vanilla. Jessica started laughing, then lost her footing and fell. Sam, tangled around her, followed. Becky and Zach came crashing over.
He heard Gabe's voice, even though it was muffled by his hands. “Compromising is right, I'll tell you. He had me up on the counter - ”
The rest of December, Christmas, and the New Year passed and Dean's bad mood didn't lift. He was surly and bad-tempered, even with Sam. More than once Sam caught Dean staring intently at the phone, and on Christmas day Dean's temper was even more disturbing underneath his attempt to cover it up with a veneer of kindness. Sam saw Dean trying and failing to shake off Cas' absence and whatever else was bothering him.
Dean felt a thrill of curiosity. Cas brought his sketchbook everywhere. It was a permanent fixture like Cas' stupid baggy coat or his perpetually-messy hair. Despite that, Dean had never seen any of it. 'Yeah. I do.'
Dean makes a mountain of French toast and they dig in, talking and joking. Cas can feel each bite landing heavily in his stomach and pressing against his insides. Dean and Sam load their plates and smother everything with syrup. Cas smiles when they try to talk though big bites.
Sam was skeptical. What was Dean thinking? 'Dean, I have to go. You're only allowed to miss three days of summer school.'
He wakes up in a hospital bed. He can tell from the smell and the squeaking of shoes. The pillowcase crinkles as he moves his head. His chest hurts when he breathes, as if he's inhaling fire. His left hand is uncomfortably warm. He tries to lift it to his face to see what's wrong with it but it won't move. In a fright, he tries again, harder, and his eyes fly open. He's lying in a blue hospital bed and has just ripped his hand out of a startled Dean's and hit himself in the face. A nurse is standing behind Dean with his lips pinched shut, red in the face, shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter.
For the next several hours, he moved through the warm, loamy scent of the greenhouse, watering plants that needed it, moving pots, trimming, fertilising, propagating. Plants were so easy for Castiel to deal with. Their needs were readily apparent to him, and anything he didn't know he could look up and learn. Humans were a different story, he thought, as the dark shapes of the customers passed by outside the greenhouse. Humans kept their feelings close to the chest. No wilting leaves to signify neglect, no brown patches from overwatering, no reasons as obvious as root rot or slugs to explain distress. Castiel had trouble figuring them out, especially when it came to romance.
Sam got to his feet, still smiling, and watched them all traipsing through the grass, Jess' hair the color of honey in the low sun.
Cas tried again. He took a deep breath and tried to force himself out of hysteria. 'I would love to go to dinner with you.' He held his breath to avoid laughing.
Sam pulled on his coat and followed Dean to the door, where Dean opened the hall closet and fished out boots and mittens. Sam pulled his boots on first, wiggling his toes to straighten out the lining, then pulled his mittens on one at a time, the second with his teeth. Dean opened the door and the freezing quiet of the world rushed inside. The ground was blanketed in white and the world was still and peaceful. Dean tromped out first, his breath making clouds against the darkness and the starry sky. Sam followed and closed the door, listening for the muted clank of the letterbox flapping with the momentum. He kept his head down and watched his boots sink into the snow with each step. He loved the crisp crunching of his footfalls. When he walked through the snow he felt like he was breaking something that was made to be broken, like a piñata or a piggy bank. Dean was waiting for him at the end of the walk and Sam smiled at him. If Dean said it would be alright, it would be.
'Dad came home last night, Dean! He brought all this stuff. Your stocking is there.' Dean raised his eyebrows at that and cast a swift glance at his door. 'He's gone again already though.'
Jo and Charlie wandered off to pick the grass that grew up through the fences, and Bobby and Ellen trailed after them.
Dean tuned out their bickering and scanned the field, the shallow sea of humans. Two kinds: the AP overachievers and the failing second-chancers. The Sams and the Deans of the world. His lips quirked. And that was when Dean saw him. Cas. Right there, in the distance, standing with a group of people Dean didn't know. Dean's heart stopped, then started beating twice as fast. No, he had to be seeing things. That was probably just some random guy with messy black hair. This was just a moment like all those other moments after Cas had first left, when Dean had seen Cas everywhere. That couldn't be Cas. But it was. Dean would know him from a mile away. As if he'd heard Dean's thoughts, Cas turned and looked straight at him. Shock rolled over Dean in waves. He felt like screaming, he felt like dancing, he felt like hitting something til his knuckles bled.
Suspicion crept over Sam. He looked back to Dean. The pale-faced girl mimed something with her hands and the rest of them laughed even harder.
Sam didn't know where Dean was. All he knew was that Dean had gone out to get food a few hours ago and he still wasn't back. Sam didn't panic, despite the worry writhing beneath his skin. He knew what to do. He picked up the phone and dialed the number his dad had taped next to the phone. His dad answered and his voice crackled across the distance.
?! Jesus, John, he's 16 years old and his brother was hungry! What'd you expect if you leave them to fend for themselves?' And, sometimes, more often than Sam liked to think about, 'Are you
'I have a few sticks of dynamite left, and a load of fireworks. It IS the 4th of July coming up, after all. We would be setting a fine example for patriots across the nation if we combined them into one big blowout.'
'I think he's sweet,' Jo chimes in. 'Needs to grow a pair, but he was really nice to me when I showed him the staff room.'
'Yeah. He thinks...home. Didn't want to.... Did you...my stocking?' Silence. 'Cas...didn't have to.'
'Huh?' Dean shakes himself out of the daydream and realizes he's been staring at Cas' bitten lips, and is half-hard in his jeans.
Sam looks between them and Cas cocks his head, a little alarm ringing in the back of his mind. He feels and fears the presence of something outside of his daily reality. “Who opened the door then?” Crowley? Something worse?
'What changed?' He said it quietly in the still air of the empty room, half-expecting an answer to come to him in echoes.
The second greenhouse was for re-potting to allow the plants to grow to full size. Breathless, recovering, putting all of their energy into new growth, the plants would stay in this greenhouse for several weeks before being brought out to be displayed and sold.
'Are you okay?' Dean opens his eyes, feeling short of breath. Cas looks alarmed. Dean gives his head a little shake and exhales. He smiles weakly. Cas frowns at him. 'Do you need me to get you anything?'
'I shouldn't have to show you this, you've been here long enough. Didn't you do this with Rachel?' Castiel responds so quietly Dean can't hear him. 'Well. I have too much to do here, I don't have time to babysit you. Here, you dust, I'll vacuum.'
'Hey!' Dean says, and plants one on Cas' lips (Look, everyone, look what I can do.) 'Cas, this is Bobby, and Sam, and Jess.'
She patted him on the arm and leaned in for a hug. “Say no more. We both know Gabe talks a blue streak. I'll see you around soon enough, Young Novak, you can come for a drive with me in the R.V. when you have some free time.”
School began again, and Dean didn't founder as expected. Benny's help had paid off. After the first week the three of them - Dean, Cas, and Benny - fell into a routine. Dean and Benny emerged from their homeroom and got caught in the stream of students in the hall. They were carried along the hallway to where they met Cas, as usual, whose homeroom was a few doors down from theirs.
When he gets home he takes a long hot shower, then changes into a loose shirt and a pair of flannel pajama pants. He settles on the couch with a grilled cheese and his laptop and pulls up some old
'What's up with him?' Dean hears Kevin ask Chuck, who frowns and shakes his head. Dean winks at them and bends to check the tarts in the oven once more before lunch.
Cas smirks and reaches down to undo the button on Dean's jeans. He slides his hand past Dean's waistband. Dean inhales sharply and pushes into Cas, pinning him against the wall, and kisses him hard. 'You are the best catastrophic distraction a man could hope for.'
Sam stares at Cas with that crease between his eyebrows and Cas smiles at him. “I actually am fine, Sam. No lasting damage.”
Cas threw both of his hands up. 'Laugh it up, Winchester. Gabe got some for you and Sam, too, and he's forcing us all to wear them.'
Dean was terrified. He didn't want to hear it. Something was balanced precariously between them, so he leaned in toward Cas. He tipped the balance just enough for gravity to take hold. A slow listing that gained momentum. Cas' eyes widened. Just before Dean's lips touched Cas', he stopped. He couldn't do it. He was a complete coward. But he couldn't make himself step away either. Instead, he rested his forehead against Cas'. Surrender. A primal challenge. Cas fell into Dean's orbit like he belonged there and pressed his lips to Dean's.
Cas ran his hands up the backs of Dean's thighs and sucked him down like he couldn't get enough. After the display Dean had just witnessed, he was helpless to withstand the small humming noises Cas made, the obscene (although quiet) sound of Cas' lips sliding on Dean's skin, and the pressure rising from the pit of his stomach. He gripped Cas' hair in a warning, lifted his mouth from the pillow and choked out Cas' name just before he fell from the edge of his orgasm and pulsed into Cas' mouth.
Castiel thinks for a moment. 'Well. It's like handling fire. You're shaping this burning-hot lump of molten glass, and you know that it could shatter at any time, or burn you badly, but if you stick it out and try hard enough, it ends up as this beautiful thing that you shaped with only your breath.'
Dean cast his eyes around the shed and they landed on the box of fireworks and dynamite. Cas' eyes followed Dean's.
Dean and Crowley left Bela sleeping on the couch and went straight to school from Crowley's house on Monday morning. She waved them off and said she'd catch up later, so they shrugged and left. They knew she had enough stolen hall passes and forged notes from her parents to stroll in whenever she wanted.
As he turned to go get changed and brush his teeth, something caught his eye. The spider plant on top of the china cabinet didn't need as much as care as the other plants, so it hung from the ceiling in a corner, out of the way. This morning, though, something was wrong. Castiel could feel it like a physical presence. The plant was wilted and off-colour. The wrong-ness leaked like invisible fumes from the pot and stretched beseechingly toward Castiel. Help me. He heard the request as clearly as if someone had whispered it in his ear. Frowning, he reached up, lifted the pot from the hanging basket, and brought it down to eye level, its spindly drooping leaves twirling and catching on the sleeves of his bathrobe. He examined it, turning the pot, the wrong feeling curdling in his stomach, dark and murky. The plant was less than perky and the soil definitely looked odd. What was that on the surface, among the lower leaves? Mildew? He touched it and it dissolved beneath his touch. No, not mildew. Ash. Castiel recoiled and nearly dropped the pot. For a moment all he could see were leaping flames. He shuddered. The plant suffered in his hands. The ash coated his fingertips.
Castiel gagged, the taste of ash heavy on his tongue. Just a dream, he told himself firmly. It's not real. He forced himself to lie still, to loosen each of his muscles one by one, to relax into the comfort of his bed. The tension unwound. The taste faded. His room swam into clearer focus. He concentrated on the familiar wallpaper and bright wooden furniture. The smell of home, the patterns of early morning sunlight on the walls that he could have traced with his eyes closed. All of the sensations as integral to his mornings as waking itself. Deep breaths. Don't worry about inhaling smoke. There is no fire.
'Well, if it means anything to you, this card - ' here he handed Cas a card with a big sun, with a field of sunflowers and a weird little cherub riding a horse – 'is really positive. It means success and fulfilment, basically, and it's in the line that talks about possible outcomes.'
'I asked if you wanted a refill,' Cas asks over the sounds of 'Armed and Dangerous' on cable. He gives his lowball a little shake and gestures to the bottle of whiskey on the coffee table.
'The whole thing was for my family! I left for my family. Just come out and say it, Dean, what is your PROBLEM?!'
They walk slowly down the ramp, Dean backwards, Cas forwards, and into the shop. Dean is distracted on both sides: he looks behind him to see where he's going, he looks in front to see Cas sweaty, sleeves rolled up, hair even more mussed than usual. 'Not going to lie, Cas, those metal rods would make for a fantastic swordfight.'
The latch clicked and Dean jumped as the door to the shed swung open. Cas stood just inside, arms crossed, expression blankly furious. Dean stared at him, feeling like he'd been plunged into freezing water. It was the first time he'd seen Cas properly since the fight. He looked different. He was taller, bigger. His hair was more unruly, his eyes harder. Dean sucked in a breath.
'Do you have any spare face cloths? The laundry is out and the laundry man says the next load is still drying and we need them for the 120 corridor because we're way behind and Hester sent me and she needs to get this room done quickly because the guests are in the lobby already.'
Dean straightens up so fast he thinks he might have dislocated his kneecaps. Chuck sniggers. Castiel blushes and opens his mouth, but before he can say anything, the rest of the attendants stream in around him for lunch, and he's carried off in the tide. Dean, Kevin, and Chuck follow, shucking their aprons. Cas is already surrounded, his table full, so Dean takes the seat directly behind Cas. If he leaned his head back, it would be resting on Cas' shoulder. He is sorely tempted. Instead, he swivels his chair a little so that he's facing out, and Castiel has room to turn slightly and join in the conversation at Dean's table. Kevin and Chuck raise their eyebrows and pointedly talk amongst themselves.
He shakes his head dismally. 'It's a long story. My brother, Michael, he gave me the job. It's a pity thing. Until I can get back on my feet.'
'Who's laughing?' Dean thought his ribs might snap from the effort of holding back. Cas looked at him with a flat, nonplussed expression which contrasted his sweater perfectly.  'You look great. Really brings out the color in your eyes.'
Cas sighed and shuffled the cards around, trying to focus on his future instead of Dean's legs or his own inner voice muttering
Benny laughed. 'Yeah, I know. But the old bag keeps going on about wanting to know our real thoughts about the characters, not just, and I quote, “the same old recycled drivel.” She said anyone can pass a pop quiz with the faintest idea of what the book is about, but a book report forces you to think.'
'Come on then, Winchester.' Dean swallowed and tried not to choke as he got up and followed her out into the darkened hall. Bela took his hand and led him past a messy laundry room, a closed door, and a small living room before they came to an empty bedroom. It definitely wasn't Crowley's. It looked like the room of a pre-teen girl. Dean looked around with apprehension as Bela closed the door.
Dean turned left, then right, and then they were driving down a smaller road lined with very old, very tall trees. The light in the car became softer as they drove through patches of shade. Bones tried to look out the window and left a nose print on the glass.
'Economical, Dean, not like dad's gas-guzzler.' He unlocks his sleek little hatchback with an ostentatious beeping noise that makes Dean grind his teeth. Sam grins at Dean's irritation. Dean rolls his eyes and settles into the passenger seat with distaste, eyeing the iPod dock. Augh, seriously, Sam? Seriously? Sam hits the power button with pride, so Dean doesn't say anything.
He rinsed the ash off in the bathroom sink and stared at his reflection as he brushed his teeth, trying to figure out if he was losing his mind. He didn't look like a crazy person. He looked like a confused and spooked man who was about to be late for work. He shook himself. He scrubbed at his teeth energetically and ran a brush he called Losing Battle through his hair before shrugging on his clothes and hurrying from the room.
Cas smiled a sad smile (not a rare Cas-smile) and wrapped an arm around Sam's shoulders. 'I'm going to miss you guys too. My dad will still be here, you know. Maybe I'll ask my mom if I can spend Christmas with him.'
Gabriel came back out with a brown paper bag that looked like it had a whole herd of pastries squashed inside. “Doesn't matter. His name isn't important. The important part is that he was allergic to dogs.”
Movement caught his eye. Anna strolled into the kitchen and slung an arm around Cas' shoulders, stole a bit of his cereal. Cas smiled up at her as she said something. Dean was surprised by how normal she looked. She had bluish bags under her eyes, sure, but who wouldn't after what she'd been through? Aside from that, she looked healthy, happy, and pink-cheeked. Dean wondered what she was saying. He imagined long strings of gibberish. In his mind, Cas smiled placidly at her garbled worlds, nodded calmly as her nonsense slid around the bright, clean kitchen. After all, Dean thought, weren't all words just random sounds? What made his speech, anyone's speech, different from an assortment of weird animal noises? Dean saw his reflection in the darkened windows of Cas' shed, then he glanced back to Crowley and Bela, not-so-distant dark smudges. For some reason, he thought of Benny. Benny would never let Dean do this. If he was here, he'd give Dean that look of his. He wouldn't even need to try to talk Dean out of it, he'd just tell Dean what Dean already knew: He couldn't do this to Cas. It wasn't in him. But Benny'd been keeping his distance since Dean had started hanging out with Bela, Crowley, Meg, and their crowd. Dean didn't blame him. Dean wasn't the same person he was before. And Cas wasn't either. Dean hardened. He didn't want to lose face. And besides, didn't Cas deserve it?
Dean doesn't argue. If he's honest with himself, he really doesn't want Cas to change his mind, even if Cas is sleep-deprived. 'That'd be great. Are you feeling alright?'
'Shut up,' Cas grumbled. 'Did you just come over with your little dog to steal Christmas or are you going to come in and say hi to everyone?'
'I don't know, he just doesn't seem very...friendly. Could've been first day jitters. He didn't say more than two words to me.'
“Dark chocolate and rum mousse for the filling. With whipped cream. And a chocolate sea salt topping. And maybe chopped Macadamia nuts on top.”
Sam stared at the back of Cas' head and fumbled to find the right words to express the foggy distance in Dean's eyes, the way Sam suspected that Dean hadn't really seen anything in a week. 'I mean he's never home. He's mad all the time. He doesn't talk anymore. It looks like he got into a fistfight. He doesn't...I dunno...he's off in his own head. Like he's not even there.' Cas made a hmm-ing noise and crouched down to reorganize his socks. Sam sighed. 'Maybe you could talk to him.'
Bela spun the can with nimble fingers. Dean watched the flashing metal skitter across the floor and knew it would land on him before it had even slowed down. He felt it in his gut. He wasn't mistaken.
Dean stares. 'Of course.' He feels his face get hot. He didn't mean to sound like that. Cas doesn't seem to mind. Dean covers his embarrassment by adding the sieve to the dishwasher and starting it.
Cas forks up a piece of the cake, taking a thin slice that goes from the top to the bottom; a perfect cross-section. Dean waits, watching, and is rewarded with a small blissful noise that sends heat to the pit of his stomach. 'This is incredible, Dean.' Cas takes another bite. 'How did you do this?'
Dean squinted at Sam, then cocked his head and walked into his room. 'Yeah, well, there you go.' He closed the door.
They used to sit in the grove of spruce trees in the crisp cold air, wrapped in their coats, booklet of dots and dashes open in front of them. Benny sometimes joined them, but he always got bored and wandered off to try to skateboard with Michael and Gabriel and the older kids. The skate park and the playground were only about 20 feet away, so Dean was able to keep an eye on Sammy while he and Cas tapped out letters and tried to memorize them. From then on, just the word 'code' made Dean recall the fragrance of spruce mingled with the metallic smell of freezing air and the sight of Cas' thin fingers tapping the ground.
