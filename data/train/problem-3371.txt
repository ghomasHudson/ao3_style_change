With a hand on Dean’s hip and the other firmly latched onto his shoulder, Castiel does exactly as Dean wanted. He thrusts in hard and fast, jolting Dean’s body with every sharp snap of his hips. Dean is
His body feels overly sensitive as Dean slides down between his legs and works his mouth over his erection. Their fingers tangle together, pinning Castiel’s hands to the bed until he’s teetering on the edge. Somehow, he manages to make even the blowjob is slow and sweet. Has Dean ever been so tender with him before? His head is too clouded to think beyond drawing Dean back up for a kiss. Castiel chases the taste of himself on his tongue before rolling them, intent on giving back as good as he got.

“Do I?” Castiel arches an eyebrow at him and switches to his other wing. “I know that you took a long time in the shower. Was it your
Sam shrugs and briefly spares Dean a glance before turning his attention back to him. “We think so? I mean, we’ve been using the network to track what hunts he’s been taking and where he’s turning them in. If we’re not wrapped up in our own hunt, we try and go intercept him.”
There. He said it. And he realizes too late that his explanation has revealed his hand. If Dean can’t figure out that Castiel has feelings for him right now, then there’s no hope for them. He can’t make it any clearer without literally saying the words;

By the time they make it through the marketplace, Castiel has a new garbage can, a new set of sheets because how dare he not have a spare set of his own, three separate caddies and a support bar to hang in the shower so they can all sort their bathroom supplies, and a cute picture of a lounging cat that he had found to hang over his bed. The picture is literally the only thing Castiel picked out himself. The rest was dropped into the cart Dean had grabbed for them at the bottom of the stairs.

“Holy shit, Cas, are you okay?” Sam helps him sit up. “What happened?”

Oh God, why did he think of that? Now he’s going to be worrying about it
Dean cups a hand around the side of his head and pulls him in to press a kiss to his temple.
Unsurprisingly, the message waiting for him is from Dean. Their conversations since New Year’s Day have increased to the point that they’re sending messages between each other almost daily. Mostly Dean just likes to send pictures of interesting things that he sees on the road, or he’ll complain about how Castiel’s couch was more comfortable than some of the motel beds that he sleeps on.
Paul’s cries drop into more sniffles and whimpers than anything else. Jess cracks open an eye to look at him and she smiles softly. “I don’t care what Sam says. Next time they’re freaking out, I want you to pull your hoodoo-voodoo and figure out what’s wrong with them.”
.” Dean groans and tucks his gun into the small of his back again.
“Of course.”
Cas sounds so honestly surprised that Dean has to lower his hands. He finds Cas blinking at him like a confused baby bird, head tilt et al. Did he seriously not have any idea of what he was doing to him? There’s oblivious, and then there’s

Dean holds his gaze as he keeps walking. Bobby squeezes his hand and leaves him at the head of the aisle to go sit down next to Cas’s parents. Both of Cas’s eyebrows are up now as Dean joins him in front of the officiant. She runs them through the usual gambit, and Dean doesn’t once look away from Cas as they hold hands in front of her.
A raised eyebrow is apparently all he needs before continuing, but not without the freckles on his skin standing out against another blush. Dean licks his lips and reaches up to skim his fingers over the soft alula feathers at the arch of Castiel’s wings. “Can you touch me with your wings? I mean, like,

When he finally gets up from the bed, he has the full video on his phone and it’s downloading. Unless Dean brings it up, Castiel isn’t going to say anything about it. He’s certain that Dean probably already has a copy of his own. There’s no way he didn’t notice Anna taking the video while it was happening.
“Castiel! You’re awfully quiet today.” He scoots over so he’s sitting closer and leans in as if to look at his phone. “Everything going okay there?”
“That’s up to you. Put it wherever you want.” Dean shrugs and opens the shoebox, already reaching for the plug and the collar on the beside. He pauses and glances at Castiel, eyes darting between his face and the skirt. “We should be able to fit it in this shoebox.”
But – but
Castiel shoots her a glare over his shoulder as he pulls a few towels out of the linen closet. She backs up with her hands held up. “Okay. Okay! I’ll clean up lunch. You go have your – uh –
And it’s hardly a game.
He has a point there and Castiel snorts a laugh; shaking his head. “How come
“I’m fine with what I have, thank you.” He can’t even imagine what his body or his apparently overactive imagination would do if he spent the day walking around in Dean’s clothing. That is not a risk Castiel is willing to take. “Besides, I can just buy more while I’m out with Gabriel if it’s going to be a while yet. We’re going to check today to see if I can get any of my things.”

"His shift isn't for another few hours yet." Sam sighs again and there's a rustling noise on the other end of the line. "I'm going to text Bobby and make sure that he keeps an eye on Dean. I want him to let me know if he's actually going to be going to the garage today or not. I’ll text you what I find out.”

He gets several smiling happy faces in response to that. It’s still a few minutes before realization actually strikes and Castiel’s heart flips in his chest before crawling right up into his throat.

certification to just come along with us. There’s plenty of bounty hunters who bring family with them on the road.”
“We already did.” Dean brushes past Castiel with the cooler in his hands. He carries it into the kitchen to start putting away the cool things in the fridge for the night. “Wasn’t that the whole point of the group chat and everything?”
Dean rolls his eyes as he goes through the process of ending his recording and closing out of all his programs. “Looks aren’t everything, you guys.” He can be as shallow as the next guy, sure, but personality is a

The shutters over the windows are closed, and, on closer inspection, are also padlocked shut. Interesting. Why would they be that way unless it’s to keep someone
“You want me to
It takes far too long for him to realize that the rushing sound isn’t the blood in his ears but the shower running in the main bathroom on the other side of the wall. Dean must be showering now. Castiel’s insides twist and he briefly feels like throwing up. This is
“That’s alright. I had dinner before I went to class.” Castiel closes the closet and double checks that the front door is locked before he follows. “Thank you, though.”
It won’t matter even if, by some fluke, he ends up being awkward and starts feeling like their first meeting isn’t going too well. Mother knows Dean from all the things that Castiel has told her. She knows that he’s important to him. And, most of all, she knows that her son wouldn’t fall for just anyone. Castiel has full faith in their first meeting going far better than it did when his Father met him. It is literally
It would be so much easier to not feel like he's swallowing his tongue if Dean would just stop touching him. As it stands, Castiel doesn't have any answer that he can give and he simply nods. His voice is lost to him right now, especially with Dean standing so close to him. Is he blushing? It feels like he’s blushing. Everything feels too warm in the room and under his clothes. Hopefully he isn’t.
By the time Dean returns to the bedroom, Castiel is fast asleep in the warm security of what has been – quite possibly – the most perfect of days.
He can already sense Sam’s rebuttal building in the kin-connection and he squashes it by pure force.
“Regardless of whether or not that could be counted as a ‘
that. Otherwise Sam might make him sleep out on the balcony. Dean hasn’t encountered a Mexican mosquito yet, and he doesn’t plan to. But he also has to make Sammy happy. It’s not fair to keep him trapped in the resort because he wants to go out and enjoy himself.

care.” Dean grabs his arm as he’s standing up. “We don’t watch porn anymore and I’m happy about that too.” Those words bring Castiel to a dead stop. His mouth is open to refuse him again, but no words come out. Dean takes a deep breath and meets his eyes. “And you were right.”
Castiel nods again, hand sliding down Dean’s arm to catch his hand. “Me too.”
Castiel wasn’t expecting a high school romance to last forever, but that one still stings. He’s learned to trust in his magic since then. If he gets a

is a sniping god. That’s not to say that blue team wins every time, but even when Dean’s team gets into the enemy territory, someone else always takes the fucker down.
“Good. Then we’ll talk with Sam when he gets home from classes. If he’s cool with it, we can get the landlady to put your name on the lease too.” He nods as though that’s the end of that and starts scrubbing at the dishes again. Dean is smiling to himself, like he’s proud that he came to this decision. “I’ll get a hold of Bobby to check out his wood scraps for something I can use to make a bed frame and all you’ll need to do is find a mattress somewhere. I can make some under-the-bed Ikea knockoff storage shit for your clothes and we’ll get you some wall shelves or something for your books.”
coming, right?”
By the time Dean does text back, Castiel is already in his next class. The instructor is in the middle of explaining their assignment for the day and it’s really not working in Castiel’s favour. Apparently today they’re going to be going out to explore the univeristy grounds like they did during their first few classes to take more pictures. If the students have been paying attention and doing the assignments and studying, then there should be an improvement between today’s pictures and the ones they took at the beginning of the semester. It’s been about a month, so there should be
Amelia winks at him again. “It’s no problem. We’ve all been in your shoes.”
“I am
They’re both staring at Pam after that. She winks and uses her fork to tap against her temple. “I got a flash about it when I pinched Dean’s ass this morning.”
Slowly, the fang-fin female comes back into view. She almost seems to be circling him, glancing between him and up towards the opening of the crevasse. What is she waiting for? Are others coming? Castiel hopes not. What if they take him prisoner? The fang-fin are already brutal on the battlefield. What would they do to him once he’s been captured? He doesn’t want to think about it, but images continue to force themselves into his imagination.
Dean slants a suspicious look at him. “What?” He reaches for the bottle again.
With every bit of speed that he can muster, Castiel puts as much distance between himself and the fang-fin as he can. He glances back and calls out echoes, happy to find that the fang-fin isn’t following him. Good. Now he can turn his attention to directing rescue teams and assisting them. Before he can submerge himself in the kin-connection completely, a wave of gratefulness washes over him.
Dean laughs quietly and pats the hand splayed over his stomach. “Love you too, Cas.” Though, truthfully, Castiel doesn’t hear the end of what he says, already dropping into dreamland because sex is
Instead, Dean has settled for the coolest
The bed shifts again and this time Castiel knows what happened. Dean stood up. He lifts his head slightly from the pillow, a curious sound in his throat. Instead of an answer, the bed jolts sharply underneath him in the unmistakable way of being

. He can’t look away and this beautiful display is going to be burned into his memory for the rest of his life. Castiel is sure of it. If what they have between them ever comes to an end, at least he’ll have a variety of memories both sweet and sexy to look back on.
He gives her a quick smile and wave of warm feelings in the kin-connection.
By this point in the night, Dean has bunched part of his blanket up under his head into a deformed kind of pillow. He looks half asleep right now; eyes hooded and body loose. He keeps making weak grabby motions at Castiel’s wing, but he appears to be losing hope. It’s entirely within Castiel’s right to say ‘
on his own now to think things through and there is the possibility that he could have changed his mind. It’s a little bit terrifying and Castiel has got progressively more and more anxious as the day went on.
Dean shrugs and makes a helpless gesture with both hands. “I don’t fuckin’ know!”
“Well, I had to stay and make sure you were okay.” Dean shrugs and rests his cheek against the top of Cas’s head. He’ll bring up this whole
There is, perhaps, one more part of him that is pulling him apart over this situation. It’s one that Castiel is actively ignoring and as far as he’s concerned, it doesn’t actually exist right now. That little part - so small that it shouldn’t even exist - is trying very hard to convince Castiel that he can use this. If he were to avail himself to Dean in this fashion whenever it’s beneficial for the both of them, it’s possible that Dean would stop going out as much as he does.
And now he doesn’t know what he should do with this information. It’s not like Castiel can just take it to the Council right this minute. Well, he
“Nope, no. I’m not coming back and there’s nothing to talk about.” Dean cuts Martin off while he starts the Impala. “You cheated on me. End of story. We’re done.”
“I’ve been planning this for a while.” If ‘
However, the problem with that plan is in it’s very core. Gabriel would demand an explanation to know why Castiel needs the ride. He likely wouldn’t even put the car into drive without first knowing why his precious little brother (as he’s so fond of teasing) is upset. And if Castiel chooses not to tell him, Gabriel would likely blame Dean immediately anyways. In which case, he would probably storm the apartment to get the truth of the matter from the heart of the problem.
He gets an elbow in the ribs for his sass. “Shut
One of Cas’s shoulders twitches in his approximation of a shrug. “I assume you’re going to buy one in California, aren’t you?”
. That makes Dean feel like he’s burning in his skin and scales. It’s like he swam too close to a vent and he’s going to boil alive in a neat little him-shaped shell. He’s got a whole weird mix of feelings stirring together in his belly. A good portion of it makes him feel kind of tingly and a little happy. The rest is mostly worry because what the
“I want Anna to slap me.” And slap him she does. This time there’s no hesitation and Anna hits him hard enough that tears come to his eyes and his ears ring a little. Castiel shakes his head and covers his cheek with his hand. “Thank you.”
? How do they not have a single fin-kin in their colony that likes the same sex? This is just blowing his mind.
“Well, let’s make the best of your first road trip while we can.” Dean grins brightly and slaps at Sam’s thigh. “Do it. Do it!”

way. He means it a way that means that Dean is far too distracting for his own good. It’s been a few days since they had sex and it still makes him tingly all over when he so much as allows his thoughts to deviates slightly in that direction. They’ve held off from touching each other at all since then, because of Castiel’s exam, but the want is still there. Castiel can feel it coiling hot and pulsing in his gut whenever he’s in the same room as Dean.
Dean’s hands find their place on Castiel’s hips and he pulls him in for a long kiss, holding him close. It takes a while before he steps back again, breath hotter than the water. “Does this mean that we’re back to normal now?”
– the exact opposite, actually. He’s very happy with their lives, even if Dean’s new job means they’ll be spending at least a week apart every so often. It’s just
It's funny that the Winchesters never bothered to ask why he has such a deep tub.
Castiel quietly excuses himself from the table as Jess takes the masher from him to fix up the potatoes. He crosses their small kitchen to slip his arms around Dean’s waist. As soon as he presses a kiss to the back of his neck, Dean sighs and relaxes into him. After a moment, he offers an apology for his grumpy attitude in the form of a spoonful of apple pie filling.

“I figured you liked sex, but once a day seems a bit… much to me.” Castiel mimics Dean by turning to lean back against the edge of the cupboard. “I’m afraid to say, but we have

it is to hear that. The rush of delight leaves him feeling almost woozy. It’s ruined with the blaring tone of his alarm. All three of them are startled as it starts ringing on the living room table. Castiel dives for it, nearly unseating himself in the process, just to stop it before their neighbours complain. He doesn’t remember it ever being that loud, but he’s usually expecting it. Technically speaking, he should have been expecting this one too since it’s his sixty minute reminder of his work shift.
Castiel can only smile a little at that, because it’s much the same for him. He’s not looking forward to sleeping alone tonight. “I’ll buy you a body pillow.”
it’s why they’re keeping this such a great big secret in the first place. Really though, what are they actually going to do? It’s basically guaranteed death if they try to attack the Council when they’re together. But it’s pretty much
This time, however, it seems to be up against Dean’s own nerves. He shifts under Castiel, brows drawn tight and mouth twisted into an unsure grimace. “Can –” Dean chews his bottom lip. “Can we close the curtains? Please?”
. That would be asking for too much and he can barely function right now as it is.
? Additionally, it could possibly be that he might be thinking the question could mean that Castiel wants what Dean doesn't. No matter how true that might be, he won't confirm it until he knows for certain if Dean would be open to having one.
Dean has a feather in his hand and he blinks up at Castiel with a distinctly
“As in turkey dogs. Y’know, instead of hot dogs.”
Whatever the case may be, it doesn’t matter in the long run. Castiel only has a little over a year of school left and his fees for that are minimal at best. Anyways, he’s going to have to cut back on his hours at the café no matter what. The second semester of his final year is going to be devoted to internships and there’s the chance that he might be unlucky enough to land an unpaid one.
his soulmate. He’s about ninety-nine percent sure that they’re a Disney Cast Member too, given how many Disney songs they sing all the time. It’s kinda what led Dean to applying to work here – not that he ever expected to be asked to be
He still doesn’t look at Castiel, but Dean does nod. After a few heartbeats, Castiel open his mouth and sings another his favourite songs he learned from his mother. Hopefully it will help Dean feel less sad. Castiel doesn’t know how to deal with him when he’s like this – aside from feeling a vague sense of pity and sympathy for him, that is. Well, at least they’re both free from the metal rope and

be wrong, or otherwise the only person who’ll be able to save him from Castiel’s wrath is God.
Dean’s reluctance is obvious, but he doesn’t object again. Castiel counts it as a win. He keeps his hand on Dean’s shoulder for no other reason than besides the fact that he finds it rather comforting to have a physical connection with someone in the middle of a battle. Speaking of which, Castiel glances around them to assess the situation. To his surprise, the battle looks as though it’s more or less finished.
That said, of course Charlie stops and squints at one of the unused coin slots in his till. She looks up at him and points to it. “What the heck is this?”
The line for drinks isn’t very long and Dean slides into place behind a guy with perfect bed-head and a trench coat. A little creepy, given that it’s early September and not cold enough to require that kind of coat. Dean just hums and rocks back and forth on his feet, bouncing excitedly because he knows without a doubt that Sam’s squad is going to blow the last one out of the water.
Castiel shakes his head and looks away. This is all so

He’s caught off guard when he feels a curious touch reach over the walls of Dean’s mind and returns the touch. Castiel withdraws in surprise and takes a deep breath to steady himself. Okay. He can do this. He spoke with Sam and the rest of the rebels and he can do this too. Not that he actually plans to do much
Unlike the Christmas trees that Castiel is used to growing up with, the Winchesters do not have a skirt to put underneath it and the stand is actually built into the tree. Frankly, he loves it more than anything he’s ever seen before. It’s just such a wonderful experience for him to help Dean set it up in the corner between the TV and the wall, and start pulling all the branches down into place. There’s just something to be said about putting the actual effort into it instead of his parents buying a real tree and it being delivered and set up with all the decorations practically already on it. Before he moved to live with Gabriel, Castiel had never decorated a tree with family before.
the bright-fin who seem perturbed by this. The fang-fin stopped in surprise, but they have all started going on their way yet again. Do they not care that two males just kissed? Is it normal for that to happen among the fang-fin? Is it just the bright-kin who have different views of this? But it seems so odd that the fang-fin wouldn’t care about how pointless it is for males to engage each other like that. It’s just – this is unheard of. Or, at least, it is to

His small panic attack had him miss the entire spell. For Dean, between one blink and the next, Sam is suddenly sitting on the table in place of the plant. He looks a bit dazed, hair a disarray, and his clothes a rumpled mess. Cas closes his spell book with a snap and steps around the table to help Sam to his feet. Dean is at his other side in an instant, helping him off the table and over to his bed. It’s been largely unused since they rented the room yesterday. It was easier to leave the plant on the table overnight.

“That’s a cute idea.” Sam passes her phone back along with his own. “This is mine.” It’s makes the rounds around the table, and Castiel is almost a little disappointed that it’s just a simple geometric pattern. “I have the same one on lock screen and background.”
“Agree to disagree.” Castiel hums and follows the salt line to Dean’s ear. “Now, I believe you promised to make up for the last few days.” He flicks his tongue along the curve, knowing how it makes Dean’s toes curl. “I believe it’s time you keep your word.”

There’s a comfort to be taken with having the voices of the colony in your head.

Castiel worries his bottom lip for a moment, watching as Dean slumps back into the couch again. There’s something about this topic that has bothered him for a while now. Is this the right moment to bring it up? Or should he just leave it be? He weighs the odds of this going badly and figures there’s no better time for it. If it goes badly, then he’ll deal with that as it happens.
“It’s not just –” Castiel sighs and shakes his head. “Never mind. It’s nothing, Dean. We should clean up before Sam gets home.” All this talk of spanking and punishing one’s partner has washed away the good feelings from when they were lying together. He would like to return to it, but they really should clean up. It’s entirely possible that Sam could come home tonight and how would they explain to him if he caught them naked together like this.
No one has ever asked him what the wants to do and Castiel looks to him, eyes wide. “I don’t know what I want to do.” He really doesn’t. The only thing that interests him is photography, but he can’t make a career out of that. Well, he
Slowly, Castiel lifts his head, hoping to gauge Dean’s reaction. He looks nervous, and perhaps a bit worried, but he doesn’t look particularly upset. At least, he’s not upset in the way that Castiel always expected him to be if Sam found out. It easies his own worries a little bit, leaving room for the anticipation to build. Castiel has been waiting for

How could he allow himself to do that? Why did he go along with it? Why did Dean even
And then, of course, there is what he wants to know most of all right now.
Castiel rolls his eyes, but he does spread his legs a little more – especially as Dean shimmies down the bed to kneel between them. He picks up the vibrator and takes his time coating it in lube. It does look rather daunting now that Castiel gets another good look at it. It’s thicker than Dean is. Thicker than anything he’s ever taken. Will it even fit? A nervous flutter fills his chest and he eyes it warily.
They’re not moving. Why aren’t they moving? Why has Dean
Castiel sighs and drops the remote once he’s found the right channel. The Winchesters are now going through the box full of family pictures on ornaments or popsicle stick frames that he made as a child. He ignores them and their quiet cooing and whispering as he plugs in the Christmas tree. It’s a pre-lit one so he doesn’t have to deal with the nightmare that is string-lights.

It takes way too long for Dean to realize that he hasn’t said anything in response. What clues him in is when Cas’s eyebrows draw together in a little frown and he tilts his head to the side slightly. “I’m sorry, do I have the wrong person?” He glances around the lobby of the restaurant, but Dean is the only person waiting alone. “Are you not Dean Winchester?”

, but it’s left him shaken and craving so much more. It’s only worse when Dean does that lip rubbing thing again; his thumb sweeping over his bottom lip. Castiel’s wings shiver violently and his next breath is punched out of him.
It takes that moment of pause for Dean to realize what his hand is doing. He freezes and stares at his hand where it’s stopped in mid-reach for the small rip in Cas’s tail. Holy shit is he about to actually
Dean snorts and shakes his head. “Seen but not heard, remember?”

“Oh my God, go
Dean immediately tenses, but Anna’s soft smile eases him.
He rubs the back of his neck, nervous about question he’s not sure he can work up the nerve to actually ask, and nods. “I would.”
That’s all he wants.
“I gotta get going.” Dean steps away from the counter and Castiel hates it just a little bit, in the most confusing of ways. He wants Dean to go so he won’t be late for work and so things will calm down at the café quickly, but at the same time he doesn’t want Dean to go. Castiel
The first throw goes wide and completely misses the frame. Castiel frowns and looks down at the next bolo. “This is harder than it looks.”
There’s still an unsure tremble with Cas’s thoughts, but Dean brushes them aside. He reaches out to run his hands through Cas’s hair, pleased when he leans into the touch.
Abaddon’s thoughts come without any form of amusement.
Anna's laughter echoes around them and she draws to a sharp stop next to him. She wraps her arms around Balthazar’s shoulders and presses a kiss to his cheek.
nowadays. Which explains why he’s scared as fuck about the future – and part of the reason he wants to put off having this talk with the colony.
The irritation is rolling through the kin-connection and it almost makes him wince.
Dean mumbles incoherently and curls in on himself. Castiel tucks him back in and backs away from the bed. He stands for a moment, watching as Dean goes back to sleep – if he was ever awake in the first place. As he slowly steps away from the bed, he makes sure to keep an eye on him, just in case he walks up. There’s not a peep or a centimeter of movement by the time he’s reached the door or slipped back out into the rest of the apartment.
Sam twists around and a growl rumbles in his chest.

Bringing attention to what Dean is doing might make Dean stop all together. Besides, it’s not like Castiel actually
He uses his elbow to close the trunk of the Impala, miraculously not trapping any of his bags in the process. “That’s your own fucking fault for working on a Saturday. Bitch, it’s the
Castiel shakes his head and slings his bow over his shoulder to keep it out of the way. “Only if it’s water. I told you that I don’t drink.”
“Yes, we would!” Sam snatches the pamphlet and starts excitedly reading it. “You can’t say ‘no’ to this, Dean.” He waves it under his nose and Dean has to smack his hand away to make him stop. “You okay-ed boats when you said that you wouldn’t mind going fishing!”
“Yup.” Dean’s grin is a little more genuine this time. “Figured we had a better chance of staying with you than anywhere else.”

to make Cas trust him? From a tactical point of view, that would be a very good thing. It’s not going to do much to have just one bright-fin trusting him, but that’s still something. One could lead to more and, if Dean could potentially get the full force of the bright-fin warriors behind him, he might actually be able to do something that could
? And especially recently enough for Sam to take that lilting tone in their link.
Castiel sticks his tongue out at him briefly before sitting on the edge of the bed. He keeps his wings angled out of the way. There’s a decent amount of space between them, but Dean closes it by leaning over until their shoulders bump together. Sam snaps a quick picture with his phone before he turns and takes a selfie with the two of them in the background.
As carefully as he can, Castiel rolls over and he’s only mildly surprised to find Dean sleeping comfortably in his bed. It takes another few moments for him to remember when Dean snuck in last night and he props himself up on his arm to look down at him, marveling in how that apparently

To say that he sulks while he gets dressed is an understatement. Castiel sequesters himself on the couch with a text book after that. What else is there for him to do now that Dean is going to have to go out to maintain his lie? Any good feelings Castiel had after his orgasm are long gone. He wanted to spend the evening watching movies and relaxing with Dean. That’s been stolen from him too and he fully plans to sulk the rest of the evening. Hopefully he won’t be too short with Sam if he speaks to him at all.
Standing around with his friends and knowing that he can’t leave with them is only going to depress Castiel further. His own goodbye is quick, mumbled in the short space before he turns away too. Any fight he had left in him drains away and his shoulders slump as he makes his way to the lockers. Does he even have the time for a shower? Screw it. Even if he doesn’t, he’s going to take one. If Father gets upset with how long he took to clean up, then Castiel can just say that he didn’t think his father would appreciate going out to dinner with him reeking of sweat.

than friends?
Naomi is the first to spot the fang-fin. She turns sharply to place herself to Lucifer’s right and just behind him. Azriel twists to turn and take her place in line with Naomi, though on Raphael’s left. Castiel stops directly between Michael and the approaching fang-fin. He refuses to move from this spot, even as a shiver crawls across his skin. Watching the fang-fin enter the halo of the bright-fin’s combined glow is terrifying. They glide just like sharks and the movement is one Castiel is deeply ingrained to fear.
Now that both sides of the war have adjusted to the different fighting styles, injuries are more likely to happen than death. Especially when there are some who aren't pulling their damn weight. For instance, there’s the whole thing about Sam not having killed anyone in a long time. And it’s not even just him anymore. Dean has noticed a change in the fighting styles for a lot of their friends. They’ve all just up and decided somewhere on their own that it would be a good idea to stop killing the bright-fin entirely. They’re beating the crap out of the bright-fin and then chasing them off or letting them get saved by swirly-blue and his teams of heroes.

about coming here and if they always disappear from the colony at the same time, that might raise suspicions.
The chairs are surprisingly more comfortable than Castiel thought they were and he stays where he sits in the corner. He stares at his phone for a few minutes, wondering if it would be appropriate for him to text an apology to Dean for taking up his break and forcing him to spend time with Gabriel. Castiel even opens up his messaging app and starts typing out a message. But he erases it and rewrites it a total of three times before Gabriel comes over and kicks his foot.
Castiel winces. “Oh, okay.” Maybe it would be best if he cuts this call off now before she can really get into the swing of a disapproving lecture. “You – um – you have fun tonight.”
But he’s going to take that self-confession to his
That’s hard to believe. Cas has always chatted him up whenever he comes here. Always asking questions that Dean sometimes can’t even find his voice to answer. He’s always asking about how the aquarium Dean bought is doing, or asking to see pictures – because Dean is a fish-dad that takes pictures, apparently. That’s his life now. Pictures of his
But then his hands are being pulled away and pressed against the headboard. Cas mumbles something in that same strange language from before, and when he pulls away to sit back on his heels, Dean can’t move his arms. He looks up to find his wrists crossed and a rune glowing in the air in front of them, keeping them pinned in place.
“Shut up.” Gabriel groans and drops his face into his hands. “Just –
In answer, Sam waves over his shoulder and jogs off to the starting line. Castiel clears the timer for his run and Dean shouts for him to start. He watches no less closely as Sam clears the narrow beam and the salmon ladder fairly quickly, but the rest of the course he takes a little slower. Dean was surprisingly light and steady on his feet. But Sam is a little wobblier and he loses time when he slips while running up the slope.
fucking idiot last night
!” Dean gasps and reaches back, scrabbling for purchase on the back of Castiel’s neck before settling on a grip in his hair.
That clawing feeling only gets worse. It's like it's trying to get out before more sad songs are sung. And it's starting to feel a lot like
Dean frowns and looks up at the ceiling in thought. “I think he had the late shift tonight, which means he doesn’t usually get home until around midnight.”
Teen & Up (for language), Alternate Universe - Star Trek, set during The Next Generation, but also set in the reboot universe, mentions of Spock/Kirk, Vulcan!Cas, Human!Dean, meet cute, getting together, first kiss
With a groan, Castiel flips onto his back again. He thumps his tail against his shelf and rubs his hands over his face. Why is it that his mind only stops at night when Dean is with him? Why is he having so much trouble remembering what it was like to sleep on his own, even though he did that for the vast majority of his life? This is unfair and frustrating and – and – and is he able to go to Dean’s hollow yet?
He’d give Sam a piece of his mind about this if he could actually organize his thoughts into something decent enough for communication. But Dean’s whole head is a swirling mess. Anger, sadness, upset, hurt, and a touch more anger on top of that. He can barely even think straight. All he wants is his family and his friends to be safe. Is that too much to ask? Why did they have to go and do this? Why did they feel the need to shut him out and keep him in the dark? Dean could have handled this better if he’d just been
Strapped to Dean’s back are a pair of red and black webbed wings. They’re not very large, but they’re certainly noticeable. Just as noticeable as the curved red horns on his head. They’re attached to a headband too; curving out and then in as they go right up.
.” John sighs. “
. It was also stressed that he should not pull them out like he was revving a lawn mower, so it could be said that it’s a good thing Castiel has never done any form of gardening in his life. He knows from his research that he simply should not do it too quickly or with too much force, and that sounds simple enough to him.
He tosses the skirt onto the bed before going through the shoebox. There are only a few things that he needs from it; his collar, the cockring, the handcuffs, and the tie that has officially been retired from Dean’s closet to be used exclusively in the bedroom. Castiel puts the shoebox back up on the shelf and takes his findings back to the bed. He runs his fingers over the collar before putting it on, his hands shaking slightly. A shiver runs through him as the leather settles against his skin; a heady mix of anticipation and excitement.
Aunt Amara opens the bag and pulls out something long and sheer. The edges and cuffs of what appears to be a truly

Castiel hums and adjusts his stance to take more of Dean’s weight. “Don’t worry about it. I thought it was kind of cute.”
Castiel can’t be expecting to form an actual question to find out what he means. All he can do is make a curious noise. It devolves into another moan as white hot sparks skate up his spine to set off fireworks behind his eyelids. God, he’s getting so close, so
? That's disgusting. Snails are just so – they're so ridiculously slimy. It makes him shudder to think about having them be, like, half his diet. Mother-sea, no. Dean can't wait until he can get out of here again and start eating more varied foods again.
It’s a brief glance before he meets Dean’s eyes again and his smile falls into a frown. He steps around him to look from behind before gently touching his lower back and shoulder, one hand each. “You experience pain here, correct?”
This is one of the dangers of thinking back on his choices as a means of falling asleep. As happy as Castiel is to finally be at a normal school with a mostly normal life, there are still things he wants and craves. And now his thoughts are lingering on this lump of loneliness he’s had sitting in his chest for years. Dwelling on that sadness is not conducive to falling asleep. If he wants to sleep any time tonight, then he should think about happier things.
There’s a nagging sensation at the back of Castiel’s mind that has been there ever since puberty. It’s a little voice that continues to whisper to him that he’s
He shakes his head quickly and looks away to stare at his hands in his lap. “No, it wasn’t her. It was –” Castiel hesitates. He doesn’t want Dean to get in trouble. “I fucked up.” And that’s not a term that he uses lightly.

puppet.
fucking disappointed too. Dean was really looking forward to getting to spend half the night hanging out with Cas and talking about all sorts of things. Now that’s been ripped out from under him and Dean feels like he’s been left endlessly spinning head over tail. Up is down and down is up and nothing feels like it makes sense anymore. He was trying to do something
To take the picture, Castiel rests his elbows on the table and tries to make it look as though he is simply sending a text message. It doesn’t matter to him that he gets Sam in the picture too. After all, Castiel is fairly convinced that the two of them are brothers. In the few months that he has been coming to the café for lunch, he has seen Sam here several times and always he is talking with Dean. The way they interact reminds him quite a bit of himself and Gabriel. But despite suspicions of their relationship, Castiel can’t bring himself to ask either of them (or Gabriel) about it.
“Don’t worry about it.” A hand touches the back of Castiel’s head once before patting gently. “He likes people the more he sees them. If you want to have a shot at being his favourite, you should probably come visit more often.”
He even sings duets with his soulmate together in their heads sometimes, switching up who sings which role depending on who starts first.
It makes Dean feel queasy in the pit of his stomach because that actually makes him consider it. But he’s also an outsider to all of this. What does he care about what goes on between the forest dwellers and the townies? They could just as easily take a different job, earn enough coin to buy the supplies they need, and then leave this all behind them.
“Oh.” Kali yawns. “Is Castiel okay? He doesn’t usually call this late.”
That’s a little shocking. Sam had been very excited when Castiel told him earlier in the spring that Stanford had already accepted his application. The only reason he never told Dean about the scholarship or that he was going to Stanford was because he thought Sam was going to tell him. It’s a little odd that he hasn’t, but it doesn’t matter. Dean knows now.
Dean saves (if he should even call it that) him from having to figure that out. “Well,
Dean nods and sits back down. “Care to join me while we wait?”
“Are they really friends if they’re people I’ve never met before?” Cas sighs and shakes his head. “None of my siblings or friends want to play, so I do random matches through the game.”
That’s another clue that goes over Dean’s head; purposefully ignored. "I left you in bed an hour ago. You can't miss me that much."
That’s kinda the plan. University wasn’t really in the cards for either of them, what with the money situation. Sam’s had it in his head to work for a few years and save up enough so he could pay for what scholarships wouldn’t cover without having to work while going to school. Now that money isn’t an issue, the timeline has moved up
been a little possessive where you’re concerned. Can’t help it since I married myself such a mega hottie like you.”
Dean says nothing. All he does his shrug and hangs his head to stare at his hands. It takes some time, but eventually he turns and looks at him. He looks haggard and defeated. No, he looks like he needs a hug, and Castiel is more than capable of doing that. Cool air rushes under the blankets when he pulls them back, but Castiel doesn't mind. It'll be taken care of soon enough as he pats the empty spot next to him in the hopes that Dean will come lie down again.
Balthazar snorts a hard laugh and twists to brush past him.
He accepts the compliment with a carefully controlled burst of gratitude. Castiel places walls around the rest of his emotions to keep Balthazar from knowing immediately that the sentiment is returned in kind. With his fingers, Castiel counts the seconds that pass before he gets an annoyed jab at the walls.
“I grew up here.” Cas shrugs and wipes some sweat from his forehead. “I barely notice it anymore.”
Dear Lord, she is far too astute for her own good. “Please don’t read into things that aren’t there.”
Instead of naming Gabriel as the culprit, Castiel gets to his feet and squares his shoulders; head held high. “I don’t regret it.”
“Hey! Earth to Doctor Collins. Come in Doctor Collins.” A crumpled up ball of paper bounces off Castiel’s shoulder and he finally looks up. “There we go. You were seriously studying that hard?”
Castiel hums and pulls him back for another kiss.
“Loser, obviously.”
“Thank you, Auntie.” Castiel pushes the bag into her hands. “This is for you.”
Either way, heat burns in his ears as he crosses the stage quickly. Castiel shakes the Principal’s hand and accepts his diploma. When he smiles for the camera, it’s a little weak and he leaves the stage as soon as he can. Once he’s out of the lights, he’s finally able to breathe again. There were
– even if that change is something that he desperately wants.
“I’m so sorry to hear that, Dean.” Castiel feels bad for asking now. “This must be hard to talk about. You don’t have to –”
The blush gets even worse and Castiel sinks back into the couch, hoping that it will swallow him whole and keep him from finding out where this situation is going. But he knows that’s not going to happen. Maybe, if he’s lucky, he’ll be able to convince Dean to put the box away and they can return to their regular movie night and Castiel won’t have to deal with
Something about being called
“Yes, that would be the plan.”
. That felt equal parts amazing and terrifying to say. His heart is pounding in his chest as hard as it did during the competition and it just might cause him to have a heart attack before this conversation is over.
To prove his point, Castiel concentrates on making his side-fans fold out and spread, then narrow quickly. At the same time, he twists and curls the ruffled adipose fin that runs along the sides of his tail as further proof.
“Be happy we’re doing something cool instead of making you wear a dress.” Anna pauses in the process of tilting his halo to smile down at him. “Or, there was that one costume that was just a kinda
It’s affecting his moods and it’s only a matter of time before Sam or Dean notice that he’s been spending almost every day in a sulky mood. Castiel does his best not to show it, but he’s not sure if he’s a very good actor. Sometimes he is, but sometimes he’s just feeling too much to be able to hide it all. And these last few weeks are testing his acting abilities to their limits. Some days it feels almost impossible to hide all the worries that he has.

The only time he and Cas get to hang out at work together is during lunch and at the start and end of their shifts. They can’t really hang out afterwards because Cas has night classes or studying or some other bullshit excuse that breaks Dean’s heart. He likes Cas’s dry wit, or how excited he gets when he talks about his studies, or how they can both get their nerd on with Vonnegut, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and every other little thing they apparently have in common.

And it might have melted too much by then. Castiel rolls his eyes and gets up to take it back to the freezer so it’s safe. He joins Anna and Sam at the table and the three of them enjoy their ice cream while watching Dean gather up all the empty boxes. The boxes get packed away inside much larger Rubbermaid bins, and Dean takes those downstairs one at a time.
night like this. Otherwise he might get
There’s something ethereal about the world when you haven’t slept and everything is quiet. If the weather was nicer, Castiel wouldn’t mind sitting on the deck in the backyard and watch the sky change. The trees are too dense around his home to see the sunrise through them, but the shift into dawn as it colours the backyard with dim light is still just as magical.
Castiel’s wallet is in his bag, resting next to his nightstand. He crosses the living room to pull it out. There should have enough cash to cover half the cost of the pizza. It’s only fair that they split it. Dean is already sorting through the coupons they keep in a drawer in the kitchen and Castiel leaves the money with him. He’ll trust him to order the right pizzas and split the costs fairly. While he does that, there’s cleaning to be done and Castiel rolls up the sleeves of his sweater, ready to eradicate any proof of their passionate weekend together – though he does it with a heavy heart
“And it was

Abaddon hesitates for a moment as she processes what’s happening around her. It’s not long enough for Castiel to gain any sort of upper hand. He doesn’t need the kin-connection to feel her rage at the betrayal. He can see it plain on her face in the light of his glow. The Council likely suspected
He pulls pans out of the drawer under the oven and turns the heat on to start pre-heating it, moving around the kitchen like it’s his own. “The motel rooms with kitchenettes cost more per night than ordering in pizza or Chinese and having leftovers for a day or two. I mean, we do eat sandwiches and snacks a lot too. We keep the fixings in those little bar fridges every room has, just so we’re not eating out for
Castiel starts struggling, his tail thumping against the sand to try and twist out from under Dean. It’s hard to focus when he’s keenly aware that Dean is pressed against him. This feels much too different from when Dean was carrying him on their way back from the cave. He doesn’t know

, you know that right? Make sure you have some before I pick you up! I’m leaving right now to come and get you.”
There are plenty of times where Dean has kissed Castiel against a while. This is, quite possibly, the tamest moment out of all of them. Of course, he's not complaining. Castiel would happily kiss Dean everywhere and anywhere for the rest of eternity if it was asked of him. For him, the intimacy of a long, slow kiss far outweighs any of the quick sexual escapades that he and Dean have snapped up when available to them. Castiel loves them and he wishes he could have moments like this more often.
where Dean is concerned. “I have to – I need to do something.”
about all of this now. Dean is one of his first friends and this is the first birthday that they’ve come across since he met them. And then there’s what Sam just said too. Dean wanted to be here to celebrate with
When the front door opens, he nearly jumps right out of his skin. Castiel was so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he didn’t even hear the Impala come rumbling up the drive. He’s rounding the end of the hall when the door opens and he turns so sharply, wings flaring in surprise with the motion, that the curve of one bonks fairly hard into the wall. It
.” Castiel fixes her with a disapproving glare as he settles into his seat at the head of the table again. He opens the box and starts dealing out the ice cream.
Castiel is pulled from his thoughts and he turns his head to find Dean looking at him closely. He raises an eyebrow in confusion.  “If what worked?”
“Oh.” Dean stands up and goes to pick it up. “You – uh – When did you put this out?”
This is not good. Dean went straight to his bedroom after they ate and he hasn’t come out since. Castiel isn’t sure what he’s doing in there, but it can’t be good. He’s been sitting on his bed ever since with his laptop propped up on his knees and he hasn’t heard a single thing through the wall. Is Dean listening to music? Is he on his own laptop? Is he taking a nap? Whatever it might be, Castiel can’t stop himself from worrying about it.
He really needs to stop letting them get to him. It’s starting to be a problem.
“No, Dean. I mean he was
The big, bright smile that he gets in return makes Castiel’s chest feel a little tight. “

. On the contrary, the frustration pumping through Castiel’s heart right now is inspiring much the same reaction in him. Or that could just be how trained his body has become to react to when he has Dean unclothed and near him.
to make the definitive decision on what happens between them.
– would that be considered a loophole? It would be something that he could touch again – that he could see again and relive the memories better than just by thinking of them.
God, he’s
“I am fine.” Cas continues walking straight ahead, beelining for a row of hover cars waiting along the edge of the plaza. “We have many days before it will strike. But I find that I wish us to be alone as soon as possible.”
Part of Dean wants to ask why they called the division leaders this late in the night, but he knows better than to be the first to talk here. He bites his tongue and holds back his thoughts, waiting for someone else to break. If worse comes to worst, he’s just going to fall asleep here and they can yell at him later – or kill him in his sleep. No, that’s dumb. He could never relax enough around these psychos long enough for him to actually fall asleep.
Dean raises his eyebrows and starts entering the order into the till. “So, the same as the other day with a pastry surprise, huh? Sounds good to me.”
and he needs to distract them both from that line of thought.
The rough rasp of Dean’s voice is almost a physical sensation over Castiel’s skin and he has to suppress a shiver when he speaks. “Can I - please let me come in your mouth, Cas, please?”
After being alone since the rebels left, it feels like no time at all before Uriel and the others swim into the boundaries of Castiel’s echoes. He can’t hold back his smile as he rises to meet them. To his surprise, Hannah hugs him tightly. Gadreel and Uriel both put consoling hands on his shoulders, squeezing tightly as if they’re checking to make sure that he’s real.
Dean ducks past him into the bathroom, pausing only to give him a hopeful little smile. It puts Castiel’s feathers on edge, but in a
Castiel tightens his house coat again while trying to hold onto that brief moment of calm that he had found. His house coat is big, fluffy, and it makes him look twice his size. He wears it no matter the time of year, not only for comfort but because it’s an easy way to quickly hide his secret should anyone come to the door unexpectedly. Until today, that had never happened before.
“He would fire you on the spot if he knew you were speaking to me so casually.” Cas hefts Jack a little more in his arms when the toddler tilts in to rest his head against his shoulder, eyes drooping. “He has the notion that the help should be seen and not heard, unless spoken to.”
if it grabs him or Cas, they’re going to be jam on its palm.
Dean reaches out to push a hand into his hair as Castiel starts dragging himself into the chair. “I know. I’m sorry.” He leans down to kiss the top of his head once he’s within reach. “I’ll help you take care of things and I can finish putting together this play place bullshit later.”
husband.”
Money has changed a lot of people in Dean’s life, and the fact that Cas was one of them is just – It’s the worst. The only saving grace is that unlike everyone else though (except for Sam), Cas is the only person who hasn’t wanted something from him – which is ridiculous because Dean would give him the goddamn moon if he could.

thinks it’s a good idea even as he leans over the edge of the bed to find Dean’s pants. It doesn’t occur to him to stop even as he digs the phone out of the pocket and reaches forward to put it in Dean’s hand.
. It was exciting, and made all the weirder because Dean and Sam stood guard outside the door for him the whole time.
“Took you long enough.” Dean leans in until every word is a ghost of lips brushing against his own. He presses a firm kiss to them for a brief moment before exhaling his own quiet confession. “Love you too.”
“Never knew you were such a horn dog, Cas.” He brushes their noses together as the giggles subside, searching out to steal more kisses. “What other surprises do you have for me?”
“Nope!” Anna taps him on the nose. “You said I get to handle the house plants, and now you can’t take it back!”
His slightly shared thoughts are – thankfully – interrupted by a muffled groan. Dean stretches out on his stomach and crosses his arms under his chin as he faces Castiel.
It comes to him in a flash of inspiration taking from the oddest source he’s ever used in his life. In one of the first pornos that he and Dean ever watched together, there were lesbians. Though Castiel didn’t pay much attention to the video while it was playing, he remembers that one of the women was not present at the start. The other woman had started touching herself before the absent woman arrived and she had seemed exceptionally pleased to find that her partner had started without her.
That stops him for a moment. Cas presses his lips together in a thin line while he thinks of his next question. It takes only a second before he sits forward again. “Since this will be our first date, I suppose we had better figure out the payment situation. Are we going to – what’s the term? Go dutching?”
Dean bobs his head in agreement – though he doesn’t really know for certain what Cas means. Whenever he goes to Walmart or something, they always have betta in tiny things. He thought that was normal, but apparently that’s not? Should he ask? Should he –

“I’m sorry to interrupt.” He nods at her and passes Dean the black coffee. “Here, just as you like it.” Before Dean can say anything, Castiel leans in and kisses him full on the lips. “I have to go meet with a student right now, but I’ll see you for lunch. Don’t forget to put the cooler in the fridge.”
Against everything his body wants, Castiel continues his relentless cries for help. But it’s only a matter of time before he knows he’ll succumb. Before that happens, Castiel gets desperate. He won’t die here. This isn’t where he’ll meet his end. If he’s going to die during this war, it will be on the battlefield. He will have an

“I assume since they left.” Castiel takes it from her, hands surprisingly steady. “How did you not notice this when you came in? Or when you went down to do the laundry.”
That is rather touching, but Castiel doesn’t want his birthday to turn into a sappy tear-jerker. “Purely because you pity me for living alone.”
His smile is a little shaky, but it’s entirely genuine as he looks back to his own phone. Castiel has never really paid much attention to the backgrounds on his phone before, but he changes it now. Hopefully Dean won’t mind matching with him. The kiss that gets pressed to the top of his head confirms that he’s safe with his choice.

Oh, but that feels good. Both the touch and the words. Castiel allows himself to relax slightly and lean a little more into Dean. But there’s still one niggling little voice in the back of his mind that won’t let him just let this

about what kind of things Dean might be interested in doing with him. Yes, that can’t be a bad thing. He’s just getting an idea. Castiel swallows around the lump in his throat and nods.
The Kappa splashes into the water and everything goes silent again. All Dean can hear is his heart beat pounding in his ears and Cas’s harsh breathing. He drops his head to Cas’s shoulder and takes a few deep breaths before he trusts himself to be able to stand again.
Sighing loudly, Castiel pushes his face harder into the pillow to hide the blush he can feel building in his cheeks. “I never got around to it.”

When he turns back, Castiel is surprised to find Dean looking at him. There’s an odd look of

“I don’t see a problem.” Castiel rolls his eyes and shrugs, a smile already starting to tug at the corners of his mouth. “I’m the same, aren’t I? I thought you would never fully return my feelings and look how wrong I was about that.”
Dean wants to be an uncle already, dammit.
Cas frowns and shakes his head. “You don’t
As much as he loves Dean, this is the first time that Castiel has thought that he might not be able to continue their relationship anymore. Not if it means that he can’t bring Dean to family functions as more than just a roommate because his

While Dean talks, Castiel nods along. He hums at appropriate intervals and nods at Sam when he checks in on them before taking the first load of laundry downstairs. The Winchesters have been here for all of five minutes and already his home is louder than it has been since New Year’s Day. This time around, it doesn’t feel even half as weird as it did the first time they were here. If anything, it feels – and this is something that Castiel will take to his
Sam clearly knows him too well, because he leans in and elbows Cas in the side slightly. He drops his voice into a stage whisper, just loud enough for Dean to still be able to hear him. “Throw in dinner and a movie, and I think you’ll have him sold.”

While Dean makes the call for the pizza, Castiel picks a movie he hasn’t seen for them to watch and he takes a moment to send a message to Sam with an update on the situation. He’s out on a date with Jess at the moment and they should both be kept abreast of this change. At least now Sam won’t be surprised when he comes home.
The timing for this feeling is

tonight.” He nods at the one in Castiel’s hand. “That’s why I had to buy two. You don’t like the stretch as much as I do.”
Castiel is so used to Dean asking about his mutation that it doesn’t even really phase him anymore. He simply shakes his head and stands up. “I’m going to go check on the turkey and finish preparing dinner.”
Those are very good questions, and the Council has no problem turning them over to Castiel. Michael twists on his pillar to look at him.
and in one heated moment he revealed everything. It was completely by accident, but Castiel hopes that Dean will forgive him for it. Especially since he’ll now be missing tonight’s meeting.

He doesn’t understand it. To his understanding, they’re obviously very careful with the things that they share, but he’s also an enemy bright-fin so it all makes sense to him in that regard.

Castiel groans loudly and pushes his head back into the sheets. “Close – so close. Dean –
Cas sits up so suddenly that it startles Dean back. The grip under his chin isn’t as gentle as he would like, nor is the tongue that pushes into his mouth and seeks out every corner of it. But Dean groans nonetheless and allows himself to be drawn back up to his feet.
He nods again, this time with a bright smile. “Thank you. I’ll be waiting for him outside.”

with Dean. And it looks like Dean really wants him to agree to that joint shower. Is there really any reason that he shouldn’t? Aside from the fact that he showered earlier in the day, the only other reason he can think of is perhaps taking the time to look up things they could actually do tonight.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nope.” He shakes his head and goes the long way through the kitchen so he can toss the pillow onto the couch. “I’m done for the day. Go home.”
“I know.” Castiel smiles and cups his hands together. He scoops water up and over his head, tilting his face into it.
Castiel can’t help himself anymore. He can still feel how warm his face is from the blush and now his cheeks are actually hurting from his smile. There are so many things that he wants to say right now and he can’t decide which one it should be. Of course he should tell Dean about how grateful he is for this opportunity, but there’s
Thankfully, Dean answers before Castiel needs to ask. “If there are other people in the room, you make sure that they're okay with it. But I'm not going to judge.” He shrugs and a fond smile crosses his lips as he reminisces about times gone by. “I've lost count of how many times I've jerked off at the same time as a friend.”
Alistair’s thoughts feel slimy even without any emotion attached to them. (This
No, Castiel doesn’t want to know Dean’s reasons for it. For all he knows, it might be something that makes him hurt even more. He holds up his hand to cut Dean off. “This is talking about things, Dean. We’ve both apologized and forgiven each other. Now we can move on from this. Agreed?”
Castiel has to cover a laugh and his smile at the immediate change in Sam’s demeanor. Even though Dean is the same height as him, he still manages to keep the card out of reach as Sam starts grabbing at it. “You remembered!”
“This is even better than good.” Jess remarks, putting that paper down too. “I’d say that these are downright
In a matter of minutes, Dean’s hips are squirming on the bed and his fingers are tight in Castiel’s hair. He’s all but actively whining whenever a fingertip rubs purposefully over his prostate. Of course, that might also have something to do with how Castiel’s tongue is quick and that he’s gotten much better with his gag reflex when it comes to taking Dean’s erection deeper into his mouth and throat. He takes pride in being able to make Dean’s breathing stutter every time he does this.
the marks. He knew exactly what seeing them would do to Cas. It’s obvious even from here, with his head turned to the side just enough so that he can see him from the corner of his eye.
He’s answered with silence. And then Sam is leaning forward. “Is it that farmhouse over there?”
His thoughts are drawn and wearier than Castiel would wish on anyone.

Jess swims around Sam so she can look Dean in the eye, completely defeating the whole purpose of Dean not looking at any of them.
The only time they pull apart is when Dean needs both hands to manage the wheel as they pull into the parking garage. Even then, Castiel stays close. It just feels so nice to be pressed against him. Dean is a solid wall of warmth that he wants to lean against for the rest of forever. And the best part is that the touch is always returned. Dean either leans into him too, or puts an arm around him in some way, shape, or form.

was amazing. Terrifyingly amazing. As soon as he’s able, Castiel clears his throat and makes another attempt at flattery, just to see if Dean will keep to his warning. “You’re bigger.”
He gives her a thumbs up and goes around the desk. “Hey.” This is probably not the brightest of ideas, but Dean is very much a protective big brother and this guy is possibly laughing at an article about his little brother. So. Things need to be done about it.
“It’s fine.” Dean shakes his head and turns around again; smile grim. “But yeah, they got me breathing again in the ambulance, just in time for me to watched my house burn down with my mom inside, so that really sucked. Couldn’t do a lick of magic after that.” He shrugs and adds a hearty handful of shredded cheese into the pot. “I wanted to be a firefighter so I could help people not have to go through what I did, but fires freak me out now so I went for the next best thing.”
With that, she goes to the door and opens it. “Dean! Do you have the accessories?”
pretty cute, but Dean mostly means that as a joke. He doesn’t expect Cas to go still next to him and not play his next word. It’s a few long drawn out moments before Dean glances at him, only to find Cas frowning down at his phone.
“Sam says otherwise.”
There’s so much to know and Castiel wants to learn all about it. He wants to learn about

to find the box of Halloween things and he drags it down from its shelf to kneel on the floor and sift through it. When his fingers close around the frame of Gabriel’s fake glasses, Castiel pulls them free with a triumphant grin. The frames have no glass in them, but they’ll still work for what he needs.
Dean covers his face with his hands and groans. “I think I’d prefer if you ate me.”
Like, for example, the fading burn of sulfur in the room. It’s hard to notice over the sharply metallic sting of blood, but Castiel’s magic almost plucks it from the air to point it out. When he licks his lips, he can almost taste it too. A film descends in front of his eyes, changing the filter through which he sees the world. And suddenly, without even wanting to, Castiel can see a hazy form standing in the corner.
Castiel adds this moment to his happiest memories.

Castiel waves them off before getting into the car with Sam and Dean. It’s weirdly cozy in the Impala, and he feels fairly comfortable. True to his word, Dean had it warmed up to perfection and Castiel pulls his scarf down to breathe easily.
Castiel hums and eats distractedly, reading the new posts on the forums and trying
“Technically, no. I said if they were going to take a car, then they needed to tell you which one they were going in.” Dean shrugs at Claire’s confused look. “I
He only had his toiletries to pack up and add to his suitcase. The rest he had packed last night. The Winchesters usually leave around mid-morning, so as not to fully interrupt his work day. As far as Castiel knows, they’re just packing up the last of their stuff and are planning to head out shortly. That’s how it always goes after breakfast on the morning they leave.
“Okay, kiddos. I’m heading out!” Aunt Amara calls from the front door where she’s stooped to pull on her shoes. Castiel is the only one who actually went with her to the stairs. “Anna? Are you going to come with me or are you sleeping over?”
He slips out of his boots and disappears up the stairs and into the kitchen. Barely a moment goes by before he’s rushing back down the stairs with a travel mug in hand. “And here’s more coffee for Cas.”
“You feel
say. John left them, pure and simple, and it hurts. Of course it does. Dean would have to be dead inside not to feel it.
To be fair, Castiel isn’t really one for physical violence. Personally, he never once felt like hitting either of the Winchesters for how they left the last time they were here. That was partly due to the fact that he felt that he was the one to blame for why they left in the first place. He hasn’t spoken with either of them about whether or not their argument had any sway on their decision to leave, and he’d rather not know. Some things are better left as they are, and this happens to be one of them.
Dean pushes her hand away and curls in on himself as best he can – for what little that does him.

that now that the entire colony knew that he was saved by a group of fang-fin that they would have stopped just like the rebels have.
Someone grabs Castiel's shoulder and turns him roughly. Judging by the breasts, he assumes it's the female fang-fin growling in his face as she forces him back against the rock wall. He winces when his back-fans fold awkwardly, but thankfully they don't hurt too much. No spines feel broken in them and even his head-fins are alright. They flare normally as he hisses at the fang-fin, hoping that even though he is disoriented, he can still fool her into thinking that he’s able to put up a fight right now.
Between the five of them, they get all the chairs from the Impala to the grave. Castiel leads the way through the snow, because he knows the route by heart. The graveyard keepers always insert thin orange poles near each grave to mark off where they are, but they can’t keep up with cleaning the snow off of all of them. Luckily, Aunt Amara came prepared. She brings with her a little hand-broom that she uses to brush the snow off everything.
Cas leans over to bump his shoulder with Dean’s. “He caught the eye of every girl in that class.”
. Nothing is working right, no matter how hard he tries to bend it to his will.
? Where or where could she have gone?”
“That’ll work!” Jess smiles brightly and pulls open the freezer. “Sammy, baby, fire up the oven. These puppies are gonna get baked like it’s four-twenty.”
“But – why?” He looks between Castiel and the display of collars, brows furrowed in confusion.
? Shouldn’t you be more concerned about your own savings?”
, Cassie!”
Though Castiel may not have many hobbies, besides photography and Taekwondo, he likes to think that Dean would be interested in those. Unfortunately for Lisa, Dean’s passion for yoga ends with the tight clothing and the resulting flexibility. Everything else about it is equivalent to a pointless death in his eyes. Castiel has spent many an evening amused beyond words by Dean’s whining messages whenever Lisa manages to convince him to attend any of the classes she helps teach in her off time – especially if it’s one of the classes that Dean describes as a sauna heated by the very fires of hell.
“Yup!” Dean grins, clearly proud of himself. “We’re both bounty hunters. We hunt bail jumpers sometimes, but mostly we’re taking contracts from the government to hunt rogue mutants.” As soon as the words are out of his mouth, his eyes grow wide and he holds up his hands again. “
The ensuing silence is quickly shattered with loud laughter from all around. Castiel grins into Dean’s shoulder, pleased. Pet names are an unknown to him. He’ll have to feel out whether he likes them or not as they go, but that’s something he’s looking forward to figuring out with Dean.
Whoever is on the other end of the line must ask a question, because he squeezes his eyes shut and moves his hand enough to speak. “A little.”
. You’re trying to be funny, aren’t you?”
Once he puts one on, he reaches for the sweat pants. This pair is obviously well loved, but it’s like holding a cloud. Castiel rubs the fabric through his fingers a few times before stepping into them. He just barely manages to bite back a groan. They may not look as nice as the slacks that came with his suit, but they’re

painkillers Dean has. Apparently, he felt sorry for him because he’s been on the receiving end of those lectures and time-out corners more times than he could actually recall. The stories he had about those times were enjoyable and really helped lull Castiel down into a prime napping mood.

Or – at least – until Dean digs in deep enough to touch his oil gland. The first brush of a finger against that has his gasping and twitching.
With a dramatic sigh, Dean collapses into the only other open chair on the other side of their small round table. “Why

But he’s also a
The moment his tongue touches Dean’s erection, Castiel forces his brain to shut off. He doesn’t want to spend this moment analyzing taste and texture. That can be done when he’s alone with his thoughts later. Right now he just wants to stay focused on pleasuring Dean and bringing him to orgasm. At least the somewhat tangy and slightly salty taste of his skin isn’t bad. In fact, Castiel might actually come to like it if he got to taste it often enough. Not that he expects this to happen again or anything.
and easily one of his most favourite things about Earth.
Castiel does the mental math. That leaves them just under four hours to clean up and make Dean’s room, and themselves, look like this never happened. He hates it when they do that. It doesn’t erase what they’ve done, but he likes seeing the reminders that even if just for a little while, he got to have Dean all to himself. And he’s going to do everything in his power to extend that time for as long as he possibly can.
Ah, this is what Castiel thought of earlier.
Consent is
Castiel dims his own glow too and swims with his echoes. He can see the soft red of Samandriel’s glow coming up over a rise in the seafloor. His blood is on the water and it sends a chill down Castiel’s spine. Over the last several rotations he’s become very familiar with that scent and it makes his insides turn. The smell of blood will likely forever be burned into Castiel’s memories, no matter how old he gets – though that depends entirely on whether he’ll survive this war or not.
Castiel’s need for the bathroom is all but forgotten as he watches Lisa pull on her shoes and slam the door behind her. The awkward lingering feeling of a fight is still heavy in the apartment and it’s leaving him extremely uncomfortable. Things aren’t helped by the fact that Dean is quite obviously doing breathing techniques to keep himself calm. Since Dean doesn’t appear ready to move yet or do anything else, Castiel steals the moment to use the bathroom.
Cas’s hand is still on his shoulder and he gives it a squeeze. He tilts his head to catch Dean’s eye, a little frown creasing his forehead. “I’m sorry, have I made you uncomfortable? I thought –” And now
With a sigh, he picks up Dean’s bag too and carries them both up the stairs. Dean’s he leaves at the end of the couch, and Sam’s he takes to the guest bedroom. By then, they’ve brought some of the shopping bags in from the car and he goes to help bring them up to the kitchen while the Winchesters take their shoes off in the foyer.
- hand jobs
Dean fills the kin-connection with understanding and Castiel can feel him slide closer.
But Dean was here. He and Bobby – they got here
After a few steps, Dean clears his throat and calls after him. “Hey, Cas?”
The idea unfolds in Castiel’s mind and he acts upon it immediately. There are paper bags in one of the kitchen drawers and he writes Dean’s name on one of them. He puts a bowl and a spoon in it and spends a few seconds picking a can of soup from the cupboard before added it to the bag. As a last thought, he puts the sandwich in there too and folds the bag closed. Hopefully Dean will notice it before he leaves.
Whatever sleep fog Dean might have had before clears up rather quickly then. He sits up properly and scoots up the bed until his back is against the headboard. After adjusting the blanket over his lap, he pats it before holding out his hands to making grabbing motions. “Gimme.”
He kneels on his bed and yanks the curtains open. When he pulls the string to draw up the blinds, there’s nothing on the other side of the window. And yet, he can still hear the knocking. Where could – Oh. It takes far too long for him to realize that it’s coming from the

he share his bed with Dean? It’s not like he’s especially opposed to or anything. Dean is one of his best friends, but he certainly doesn’t fall into the same category as Sam. Not even the same category as Anna – and not just because he’s known her his whole life and she’s
as Claire has in her features, the eyes are still all wrong when she turns to him. “If Claire hadn’t accepted me, and if I hadn’t been able to find another member of the bloodline who would accept me, I would have had to return to heaven. I can’t be on this plane without a vessel, otherwise I would simply fade into the ether.”
different bottles of lotions and moisturizers sitting out on the table and Dean is in the middle of spreading a liberal amount of lotion over the myriad of scars down his leg. His right leg appears to be mostly burn scars, but there are a number of long cuts and deep scratches littering his left.
His attempts at trying to distract Cas and cheer him up or something isn’t really working. Cas just shifts like he’s uncomfortable – which he probably is – and keeps on looking unhappy. Shit. Now Dean’s got a nagging feeling in the back of his head that he somehow fucked something up with this. Great. Sam trusted him to figure out shit with Cas about how to stop their Council and now he’s done – done what, exactly?
With one look, Anna silences him. But it doesn’t last for long and the two of them wrap a section of the kin-connection in a private link. Even though he can’t hear their actual argument, he knows that it is happening and it’s rather enjoyable, actually. Regardless of how annoying it can be, Castiel missed his siblings bickering just as much as he missed everything else about home. He also missed watching them fight and trying to predict who the winner will be.

And that – that is something Castiel knows he could only ever wish for. But what a sweet wish it is.
to fit everything that he needed for school - including whatever books he wanted to be carrying at the time. But the straps had finally given out and even though Castiel was confident that he could fix it with the right supplies, Gabriel had still dragged him out for an impromptu shopping trip to pick out a new bag.
Eventually, he does manage to get himself up and off the bed. He even stops waving, which is an improvement, certainly. He sits on the edge of the tub and stares at the tap instead of actually pulling it. His hand comes up to touch the top of his head again, rubbing lightly. It’s almost as if he can still feel Dean’s kiss there.
His plan, as he loaded Toby up into the car with a couple tote bags of towels, snacks, and dog toys, was to take Toby to the beach and let him enjoy the water. They could play fetch in the waves with a little football and Toby could dig in the sand. He really likes digging, much to the despair of Castiel’s once immaculate backyard and garden. The beach seemed like the perfect place for Toby to burn off steam and, perhaps, they could have a quiet evening together. Finally.
His suspicions are confirmed when he takes breakfast into the dining room and takes note of the two duffle bags at the top of the stairs and the conspicuous absence of the bedding for the couch. They always stack it on the armchair by the window when they’re staying for multiple nights.
time and I’m not letting anyone steal that from me.”
To his great relief, Dean nods and stands up. “Yeah, sure thing.”
Cas – or Castiel, as he introduced himself – glances down at them from the driver’s seat in front of the fan at the back of the airboat. It’s a miracle that his baseball cap hasn’t been ripped from his head with how quickly they’re powering up and down the various waterways of the Everglades. His aviator sunglasses are hiding his eyes, but Dean got a good look at those baby-blues when they met him in the tour hut back at the dock. He was smitten almost immediately.
’. It’s nothing especially weird and Castiel feels that Dean would likely be open to all of these. He already knows that Dean is interested in the rimming, and he was the one who suggested the photo shoot – more or less. The rest will have to be a surprise. They’re all things they haven’t done together and Castiel is rather looking forward to trying them.
He shares his direct memories to add evidence to his words. Castiel lets those sink in before he continues, though he doesn’t wait so long as to let someone else start speaking over him.
Dean crosses his arms and slouches. “Well,

“I’m not upset.
long time, Cas. Just you.”
"It's like an upgraded version of dungeons and dragons, kinda." Dean shrugs and drops half his paper in favour of rubbing his hand over the back of his neck. "I mean we don't have actual dragons or magic spells or anything. But I liked what I've seen when I went with Charlie so I wanna give it a try."

“No you won’t.” Castiel turns to head back into his room to change.
Though it may not be entirely appropriate, Castiel spends almost their entire time in the grocery store thinking about what sort of sexual fun they could have over the next few days. It’s a good thing he doesn’t believe that people are capable of reading minds. Otherwise he would be very paranoid that someone might accidentally see what sort of terribly dirty things he’s thinking of. It’s bad enough that he can’t stop himself from putting himself in the exact spot that makes Dean brush up against him every now and then.
The wave of relief Castiel feels is larger than it has any right being. He ignores it and responds immediately. Who knows how long he has before the teacher sends someone to check on him?

Or rather, Castiel already had an explanation for it and this is just further evidence to the point. Not that he minds.

go to his knees and lick that one stray drop of water that seems like it’s taking forever to slide down the planes of Dean’s stomach. He could follow that path with his tongue, or maybe the path of the one that slips out from underneath the towel and down his leg.
If he wasn’t in front of some of the most terrifying fang-fin in existence, Dean would be swimming in as many circles as he can without getting dizzy. Fang-fin aren’t exactly built for tight turns and fancy swimming, but there’s nothing that would stop him from at least trying. He’s

Unexpectedly, Dean winces. He pauses with his hands in the water. “Uh – yeah? What about it?”
are a rare breed. We –”
Perhaps that is the explanation for why Castiel is so talkative right now. He’s jittery with nerves and finding it hard to stop talking. All he’s doing is gushing about Taekwondo, but it’s still more words than he’s used to saying all in one go. Frankly, he can just blame Dean for this. If he hadn’t asked about the different terms they might hear at the tournament, then Castiel likely never would have opened his mouth. Now the problem is shutting it.
But Cas is still shaking and there’s quiet little noises coming from under his hands. It’s killing Dean to hear it and he hugs tighter. “I promise that I didn’t let anything happen. I took you straight home, had you drink some water, and put you to bed.”
. It’s taking so long and the answer is so simple. What is
Castiel bites his bottom lip, trying not to show how happy that makes him. He couldn’t have asked for anything more than his family being so accepting of his friends. It’s really nice. He’s read post after post after post online of people upset because their families don’t accept their friends or vice versa. He really lucked out.
not to think too hard about the possibility of a wedding. That’s something he and Dean need to figure out together, and trying to plan things on his own would just bring back some of the anxiety he doesn’t want.
how to act or feel now that he knows Dean’s appreciation for his wings could be more than just in regards to aesthetics.
Silence follows that statement. Anna shakes her head, clicking her tongue quietly to herself. He knows her feelings on this. She tries to guilt him every year into wearing a costume, and every year he refuses. It’s not like Castiel goes to an office where everyone dresses up, or he has kids coming to his door for candy, or he’s going to a costume party. Literally no one except for him would see his costume and he’s never seen the point of it.

Normally we start watching them a lot earlier than –” He pauses and looks up at the ceiling, mouthing numbers to himself for a moment. “– than six days before Christmas.”
about standing in the backyard in his pajamas in the mid-morning sun, hose in hand while he holds the trigger to water the garden. Castiel closes his eyes and listens to the wind rustling through the trees; the hum of insects buzzing from flower to flower; the call of a variety of birds; the bell like tones of a wind chime hanging from the corner of the roof.

The response he gets is a string of laughing emojis, each of them with tears in their eyes. And then Dean sends a gif of someone howling with laughter and smacking at a table. It actually brings a bit of a smile to Castiel’s lips. But the only acceptable answer to Dean’s messages is a gif of someone giving both middle fingers.
bad, but it’s a good point. The less people who know about it, the better. Besides that, Gabriel’s question is a rather good one as well. There is no issue with having the funds available to him. His parents give him a decent amount of money every month and a good third (or more) of it goes into savings while the rest gets transferred to Gabriel as part of his share of the rent, food, and utility costs. But Castiel rarely touches what he has in savings, so there’s plenty in his account for him to spend on whatever he wishes.

Unfortunately for him, turning away from Sam does nothing to stop him from venting. Even Jess’s pointed sighs can’t stop him as he launches into a fairly impressive rant about all the different kinds of infections and diseases that Dean could get from sleeping with people he barely knows. He even goes into detail about just how every single one of those would affect Dean and all his current or future partners. It’s a very disturbing rant – and one that Jess objects over loudly.

Dean muffles a yawn under his other hand. “I’d call it more like
Castiel barely bites back a groan as Dean uses his hair to pulls his head back. When Dean leans down, he half expects him to kiss him – but he wouldn’t do that, right? Not while Sam is home. Sure enough, Dean doesn’t do that. Instead, his lips brush Castiel’s ear and sends all manner of shivers down his back. Whether he wants it or not, his grip on Dean’s hips tightens to the point that even his own fingers ache.

Uriel’s urgent thoughts distract him from circling with another rebel.
Before he stuffs his mouth with more cheerios, Dean takes a moment to stick his tongue out at Sam. Castiel rolls his eyes at the same time that Sam does and turns back to TV. Sam goes back to checking his backpack for everything he’s going to need for his exam.
Of course they do, and that’s something for which Castiel will be eternally grateful. “I’m sorry, Sam. As soon as I find someone I’m interested in dating, I’ll be sure to let you and Jess know right away.”
Maybe he’ll start believing that someday soon.

“I don’t know how much I like you listening to my thoughts.”
Dean pushes up on his hands sharply, a whooshing tightness filling his chest. A wide smile splits his face.
“There’s a strong possibility of it.” He answers instead and picks up his burger. “The date isn’t over yet, so there’s still plenty of time for you to decide my charm is more obnoxious than adorable. And, if the offer is still open, I totally plan to whoop your ass at a one-on-one

“That sounded like a fun conversation.” Dean announces his presence with a yawn. He leans against the door frame to the kitchen and scratches at his bare belly.
Sam helps him to his feet, careful not to cup his elbow because even those sting every time the sleeve of his shirt moves over them. He leads him to the bathroom and gets the water going in the sink. “Here. Wash with soap.”
He’s about to pull away from the kiss and put an end to this night, but Dean’s fingers are in his hair and he pulls Castiel’s head back. His tongue runs up Castiel’s throat and he breathes a command into his skin. “
matter that this will mark the second time in under a week where he’s had lunch there. It’s not like Castiel is going to be making this a habit – and even if he did, he has no reason not to. Eating lunch at a café every week day won’t hurt his wallet. His parents give him plenty of money for his allowance and Castiel rarely spends it. The majority of his allowance continues to build in his savings. Despite that, money won’t be the reason why Gabriel won’t like it if Castiel ends up making this habit.

Dean only shrugs again. “Supper will be ready in an hour.” Apparently he no longer wants to talk about this. “If you’re gonna shower, do it now before Sam gets home and uses up all the hot water.”

act like this. It’s not fair to Dean.
He tosses Anna’s blanket back to her side of the bed and wraps his own around his shoulders, careful of his feathers. His teeth feel fuzzy and his mouth tastes disgusting. Everything hurts and Castiel sits on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands. What he wouldn’t do for a nice cool glass of water right now. Maybe he could convince Anna to bring him one? Where did she even go?
, Dean.” He can never apologize enough.
Eventually, he lowers his hand and walks away. If he had knocked, he wouldn’t even have known how or where to start a conversation. This is a delicate situation – one he feels like he’s already made a mess of somehow. Dean is unhappy and it’s probably best to just leave him to sort things out for now.
Castiel’s eyes snap open and his breath catches in his chest, his gills very nearly fluttering against his neck.

witches gathered around a pentacle painted in blood taken from the ewe they’d slaughtered on an alter a whole five away.
That catches Castiel by surprise. Cute? She thinks he’s cute? This is the first time anyone outside of his family has told him that. He ducks his head and tries to will the heat out of his cheeks. It’s no good for him to be standing around at the front of the café with a blush. And Gabriel will tease him for all eternity if he’s caught like this. This is made all the worse by the fact that Castiel has no idea what to say to Meg. Should he thank her? Or should he ignore it? What is he supposed to do? He doesn’t have any experience to draw on for this and it’s leaving him at a loss.

rather true.
The moment Dean pulls away from the kisses, Castiel lifts his head to start mouthing at his neck. He noses his way to it until Dean gives in and tilts his head out of the way, giving him the space he needs. Dean’s arms are shaking slightly as he holds himself up, baring his chest to Castiel’s hands and his deft fingers as he pulls his shirt up. It gets bunched under Dean’s armpits, waiting for when he’ll actually sit back to take it off. Of course, that opens a whole new expanse of skin to Castiel’s hands and he takes full advantage of it.
With his hands on his hips, Victor looks over the colony with all the authority that a Council member
Meg laughs and starts swimming away.
That’s a question and not a statement, and it amuses Castiel to no end. He hums and looks out the window. It’s fun to leave Dean guessing sometimes. Something is going to happen tonight, whether Castiel planned for it or not, and Dean knows that. Hopefully. If it becomes obvious that he doesn’t, then he’ll have to drop a few more hints –
Oh yes, absolutely. Castiel understands and he nods to prove it. He hadn’t even really considered using the collars tonight. That would have been an extra spice to the night, but he certainly wouldn’t be able to hold himself back if that were the case. It’s already hard enough and all Dean is doing is going around the room collecting supplies. First he gets a bottle of lube from the bedside table, and next he takes his time rifling through the closet for the box of

Technically speaking, Castiel should probably start studying for his next exam, but even
Honestly, hearing anything like giggles, moans, or the squeaking of bedsprings is Castiel’s worst fear. He dreads it from the moment that Lisa walks through the front door with her suitcase in tow. Every night when everyone goes to bed and every morning when he wakes up, Castiel is terrified that he’s going to hear it. Just thinking about it and what it’s associated to makes his heart feel like it’s caught in a vise and the crank is slowly being twisted, tightening until his entire chest hurts.
He wastes no time with checking on his sleep shelf or seeing if Balthazar is nearby. If all the garrison leaders are being called, than Anna should be here sooner or later. Castiel dives over the lip of the trench and angles himself towards the end where the Council’s auditorium is. Samandriel breaks off then, heading off back to his post now that his task has been completed. Their farewells are brief and Castiel’s attention is very much focused on other things now.
It took a while last night, but he was eventually comfortable enough for them to raise the blinds in their little party room. There wasn’t much to hide, honestly. All they did was sit around the table, laughing and talking while they indulged in the buffet table and bar. It was rather nice and Castiel did enjoy himself, especially once he figured out that if he sat with his back to the wall, he felt a lot better. Well, that and the fact that the more he drank, the more he kept not caring about how people would look at them occasionally.
The chair screeches against the floor as Sam pushes himself away from the table and stands. “Like I said–” He hefts his axe from where it was resting next to him and swings it easily up onto his shoulder. The lack of effort to hoist the massive thing doesn’t go unnoticed and the official pales slightly. “I can take care of this. Just point me to where I need to go.”
His hand drops from his eyes to his mouth, smothering an actual moan. Something
. Surprisingly enough. It’s nice and less empty.
It elicits a wonderful shiver and Castiel swallows thickly at the feeling. “Do you know if –” The rest of his question vanishes as Dean’s teeth catch on his earlobe. What was he asking again? Something about the bondage. Oh – right. “Is it enjoyable?”
"Are you – Dean, are you okay?" He needs to know. He needs to know what exactly Dean wants him to do right now. Any thought of going back to sleep is long gone now. Castiel wants to do nothing more than fix whatever is upsetting Dean right now.

better.
“Uh, since always?” Dean rolls his eyes and pulls him in again. “Sorry, sweetheart, you should’ve read the fine print when you signed up for this ride.”
What if that’s what happened?
It looks like too much of a hassle for him to clean up and Castiel instead elects to flop face first down on the couch. The cushions muffle his next words; “I’m not a

Castiel still maintains his squint, but he relaxes somewhat. It does help that Dean’s soul, though dimmed in his panic, does reflect nothing but truth. Still, he bites his tongue and waits for the explanation of these supposed
know better. But that monster – that spiteful, angry, ugly little thing – squeezes at his vocal chords and keeps him silent. Until the next day, that is.
This is entirely selfish, but Castiel hopes Dean doesn't mind. In fact, he hopes that this helps him. He won't sit and analyze the whys and why nots of doing this. For once, Castiel just wants to enjoy this – especially while he can. If Dean realizes that they shouldn't be doing this, then he can call an end to it. Right now, Castiel just wants the kisses to take their natural course.
“Some of them are for the transcribing that I do, but my own sizable personal collection is in there too.” Castiel shrugs, not looking up from cutting everything on his plate into manageable pieces. “I also usually get a free copy of the books that I’ve edited.”
Once his breath returns to him, Dean rolls over. He’s surprised to find his arms weak, and they shake with the effort of supporting him until he’s on his back again. Any trace of exhaustion has been chased from his bones by Cas’s magic. Even mentally he’s not half as tired as he should be after two rounds.
Great. Another panic attack. Just what he needed right now.
and that’s a territory neither of them has really ventured into yet.

going on. No amount of bargaining changed anyone’s mind. The most Dean managed to do was get Sam to agree to be right beside him while he does the stupid explaining. If he’s going to dig himself deeper into the colony’s shit list, then he might as well have his damn brother with him while he does it.

That seems to catch Cas by surprise. “You’re gay?”
There aren’t many things that make Dean blush, but that turns out to be one of them. He ducks his head and runs a hand over the back of his neck. “Uh – thanks, I guess? I’m gonna – yeah.” Dean clears his throat and turns to go deal with Comet. “Just gimme a shout if you need anything, ‘kay?”

going to keep you from touching me. Consider it punishment.”
. Satisfied?”
still. His mouth goes slack and Castiel steals a moment to lean in and press a quick kiss to the corner of it – and then promptly continues his roll until he’s off the edge of the bed and on his feet.
There were probably a million other ways that Castiel could have brought food into their sexy playtime, as Dean had requested, but this is the first thing that came to mind. Sure, he could have gone with the tried and true melted chocolate and strawberries. There is a certain appeal in seeing how Dean would shudder as he drips melted chocolate onto his skin. Would it be the same as the candle wax they’ve tried before? Or would the burn be a little different?

much. And that way, he can avoid making Cas feel too uncomfortable or something.
The kiss starts out soft; slow and sweet. It’s as close to perfection as one can get and Castiel can feel the lightning it causes all the way down to the tips of his feathers. He can’t help but shiver, humming against Dean’s lips because kissing him always makes Castiel feel

Dean starts trembling again once he starts pulling out the beads. With his legs spread as they are, Castiel can see that his erection is leaking quite obviously. He’s making an absolute mess of the bedspread and that is far more arousing than it should be. The heartbeat in his ears drowns out Dean’s heavy breathing as he watches the way he reacts to each bead slowly popping out. His mouth has gone dry by the time the last one falls free and the entire string of beads falls to the bed between Dean’s legs.
He forces himself not to fidget with the cuffs of his sleeves, instead shoving his hands in the pockets of his sweatpants. The last thing Castiel wants to do right now is come off as uncertain, or needy, or anything like that. He needs to be supportive of his friends, because that’s what they are. At the end of the day, they’re

Castiel’s next breath stutters in his throat because he’s fairly certain that was

Dean rubs a hand over the back of his neck and decides that looking at their shoes is a lot easier than meeting the surprise in those baby blues he loves so much. “I’m probably going to be moving in the next month or so and with how things have been with us lately, I thought I should do it now before things get too busy. I didn’t want to forget, y’know?”
Well shit. There goes his plans to look for Sam – and he doesn’t like having to give up on that at the moment. That’s more important to him than anything the Council could have to say. What the hell do they want with him now?
why their Council isn’t exactly jumping outta the water to meet with a fang-fin or anything, but they were all kind of hoping that Cas’s memories and his word would be enough to get them to meet with at least
.” He reaches out to slap his hand away, mortified yet not even remotely surprised that he’s done this. “I told you not to –”
“That’s great.” Sam sighs again as Jess pats Castiel on the knee. “Tell your friend they’re awesome. And – I hope it’s not going to be weird for you to check on Dean when you get back? I mean, you don’t have to if it’s going to be weird for you.”
good.
Cas sighs and fixes Dean with an annoyed frown. “I know what I’m doing.”
But what are they going to do? Is it something that they’ve already done, or will it be something more? It leaves so many options for what could happen after Sam leaves for his exam in the morning. A few weeks ago, Castiel might have not known all the possibilities. That has most certainly changed now. After that night, Castiel has made his way through many websites in the dead of the night to look up various things they could do. There are whole
Would they have bothered to bring Dean if they suspected him?
He fidgets with his phone for a few moments before sighing. “Okay, fine.”
Castiel tilts his head, idly carding through his feathers. “For someone who likes sex as much as you do, you’re weirdly evasive and shy about it sometimes.”
Amelia leans on the glass edge of the enclosure. “Did you move out or have a good talk with him?”
With a hum, he tilts his head and looks across the hall to his empty room. “Are you a kicker?”

“Don’t tell Gabriel that the rest of us can be funny too.” Cas grins again and flashes some kind of badge to the guard holding the door open. “He’d lose it if he knew he wasn’t the only

Speaking of getting in trouble, Castiel should get around to wrapping up this conversation. He can’t be away from the front for too long or they’re going to start thinking his shirking his job. “How is Dean doing now?”
Like his heart? It’s aching almost as much as everywhere else. He broke a promise to his closest friends and upset them. Dean won’t even
Before she came to live with them, Castiel didn’t mind that he doesn’t get very much alone time when he’s sitting on his bed. Dean or Sam would be in the living room or in the kitchen, but he never minded it so much. Now he finds himself constantly distracted by how Lisa and Dean are often spending time on the couch together. Granted, he prefers them being there more than he does having them alone in Dean’s bedroom with the door shut.
Oh, really? Now his curiosity is officially piqued. “Such as?”
“I forgot I had this.” Dean pulls the tight roll out from the protective sleeve and laughs. “Probably could’ve used it last night.”

The guy’s other eyebrow goes up. “I see.” He flips the paper over to look at the headline. “I hadn’t read that article yet.”
He shrugs and leans back down to pull on his other sock. “Beats me.”
This is already too much trouble. “Never mind. I’m not going to get one.” He shakes his head and pushes Gabriel’s feet from his lap so he can stand. “It’s not worth the difficulty of having to work around our parents. I’ll just go find a necklace or something with wings on it. Or maybe a t-shirt or a nice piece of artwork for my wall.”
“Howdy, Cas. I’m Dean.” He tips his hat in greeting and pastes a customer service type smile on his face. No doubt this guy is somehow related to Mr. Adler. “Not sure if you’re aware, but visitors aren’t allowed in here without supervision, especially when we’ve got pregnant mares.”
Sam smiles and waves. “Alright everyone. Nothing to see here. Go back about your business.”
is involved, Cas.”
There is something ever so delightful about managing to get Dean to say that. It inflates Castiel’s ego just a little bit more. He hides his smile with by covering his mouth and clearing his throat. “I’m sorry I’m late, Mr. Winchester.” Dean’s jaw drops and Castiel forces himself to move forward, stepping towards Dean and gestures woodenly at the bed. This feels so
Castiel bounces his knee and stares down the statistics that he’s gathered over the last few weeks. He has the evidence. He
. And he’s doing that pretty darn quick. If he’s not careful, Cas might end up replacing Charlie as Dean’s best buddy ever. Though, technically, that’s Sam’s spot. But that’s only because he’s his brother. If Sam wasn’t there, then it would be Charlie. And now Cas is coming up quick as second and if Dean spends any more time thinking about him, it’ll be first. He better not mention that to Charlie. She wouldn’t like that one bit.
Now that he’s not trying to hide from the Winchesters as much as he did before, Castiel is comfortable with taking a short bathroom break and to stretch his legs every few hours. He can also refill his water bottle more often, which only contributes to his need for more bathroom breaks – not that he minds.

Even though this was expected, Castiel still holds his breath. His wings droop listlessly, almost all the way to the floor, as his heart clenches painfully in his chest. He knew it was just a matter of time, but they’re
Dear God, give him strength. These people are ridiculous and they need to mind their own business. They’ve already bothered him for the better part of the last hour. Why do they feel the need to annoy him now too? Can’t they just leave him alone and let him go on his date in peace? It’s not like he isn’t nervous enough already. Dean has had
Dean looks down at the cloud lying at his feet. It shifts and a pointed face comes into view, complete with black nose and blue eyes. An ear, pinker at the center than the rest of the pure white fur, cocks slightly as it tilts its head to the side. It’s such a
But that’s where the similarities between this week and their porn night ended. Dean never came out of his bedroom last night, even though Castiel waited on the couch for him to return so they could continue with their plans and watch a movie. After what they did, Castiel had wanted that semblance of normalcy again and now that he never got it, he doesn’t know what to do. The world has shifted – their friendship has changed – and he doesn’t know how or what he should do about it. That’s of little surprise, considering how he doesn’t even know what to make of his own thoughts regarding what happened last night.
He elects not to answer and keeps swimming. Actually, Castiel is rather surprised that no one is stopping him or warning him not to go alone into the bright-fin area. This is probably something he shouldn’t be doing until a peace treaty has been officially decided upon. But he doesn’t care. And Castiel fully trusts in the rebels and in Dean. With the Council done with and the rebels in control, he is certain that he’ll be well taken care of in their company.

throughout the entirety of the evening. Which is unusual in its own right. Even when Dean is the one out and about in the evening, he still texted Castiel random things that came to mind or to check on how he was doing on his own or with Sam.

He honestly doesn’t expect for a message notification to pop up over his game, but he’s
Today is the first time they managed to do anything since they had sex, and Dean didn’t go out during that time. Why would tonight be any different, considering that they just tried to do something? Of course, Dean ended up having to finish himself off. If there’s any reason to go out, then that’s it. He doesn’t have to be sneaky with them. It’s less trouble for him to do something with
It appears that he’s the tie breaker here. Everyone is looking at him expectantly, Sam included. Dean has even resorted to fluttering his eyelashes at him, but Castiel resolutely ignores it as he continues searching through Netflix until something catches his eye. Eventually, he settles on

“I –” He has no idea how he’s going to explain this to her without having her come into the house and actually meet the Winchesters.
She snaps, but there’s a trickle of amusement dancing around her words. No matter how she tries to deny it, she knows that she would still tell him. Same with Dean. That’s just what best friends would do.
“Yes, that sounds like a good idea.” Castiel picks up the forgotten remote from the side table and turns the TV off. “I’ll go too in just a moment.”
“I meant you and Dean.”
Dean sighs and shakes his head. “Never mind.” He takes a backwards step towards the living room and jerks his thumb over his shoulder. “If you’re interested, Sammy and I just queued up
Castiel takes another deep breath. “I’m only asking if the reason you were getting jealous is because you want – do you want
! I’m going to go through and make a list of every game you’ve got. We’re going to pick one at random and have us a proper family board night after dinner.”
Castiel shrugs and resorts to gesturing to get his point across. “We put the TV against the same wall as the front door and move the couch until its back is lined up with the balcony doors. We could move the Christmas tree to where my bed is once its gone, and after Christmas we can do whatever we want with that space.”
Amusement dances along the edges of the kin-connection, though it’s almost overshadowed by Sam’s worry.
While that might be the truth, Castiel still frowns at his back. “But you know I’m a mutant. You could have reported me if I turned you away yesterday.”
Castiel shakes his head slightly, but not enough to dislodge Dean’s fingers. “Not really.”
Once he’s done in the bathroom and his suitcase is fully packed, Sam helps him take both down to the Impala. Even though he hasn’t said anything about his wings being bound again, Sam’s eyes linger on his back a little longer than normal. Castiel chooses not to acknowledge it, or the fact that neither of them has really spoken much this morning – let alone the fact that Dean is avoiding him.
In general, Castiel doesn’t actually like the idea of being

who it’s coming from now that they’re speaking.
Though this is just one part of what he’s been craving for the last few weeks, he is fairly satisfied with it. If this is all Dean is willing to give right now, then Castiel will accept and treasure it. Maybe the reason they’re not touching each other like they used to is because there’s no telling when Sam is going to be home? Except, that never really stopped Dean before.

“I’m not texting anyone.” Castiel holds his phone up to bring attention to how the screen is

Dean wasn’t expecting that and he stares at Cas for a moment before getting his head back in the game. They were in the middle of some kind of conversation, weren’t they?

He gets a pout for his troubles before Dean sighs and lets him go. “Fine, fine. But if talking about it gets you all sad again, I fully expect compensation for bringing back your smile.”
Sam’s shoulders relax slightly. He relaxes further when he turns hopeful eyes to Dean and gets an approving nod in return.
“How long have you had a crush on lover boy?”
“Staying in my room?” Castiel ignores the way Anna’s head pops up from reading her own book. At his sharp look, she ducks down again, knowing better than to interfere after the stunt she pulled earlier in the month.
“I know that first hand, maman.” At least they’re in agreement about that. “I take it that he doesn’t approve of my choice to date Dean?”
suspicious. “What are you trying to butter me up for, hm? Just spit it out already.”
delicious, put me in my grave because that’s obviously a shapeshifter.”
“Who’s anal about this now, hm?” Castiel frowns at her over his shoulder.
That’s going to be a problem. One of Castiel’s hands is occupied with holding the phone to his ear, and the other is busy carrying out Dean’s last command. Is he – is he going to have to stop doing that so he can do the first? Or maybe he can – Okay, he’ll try it this way. Castiel tilts his head to pin the phone between his ear and shoulder. It’s not a sustainable position, but he’ll deal with it for now to get his shirt up and out of the way. With one hand working his chest and the other his lap, he only gets harder and everything starts feeling ten times better.
“What - What’s so funny?” Castiel frowns, blinking at him.

He talks at length about a handout they’ll be working on this class and the questions that will be on it regarding the first chapter they were supposed to read last night. The sheet will be due at the end of class. It’s a speech that should have taken seconds to make, but Mr. Alder truly does love hearing his own voice and it takes several minutes instead.
Claire crosses her arms and stomps her foot, fixing him with a look that would make even Dean quaver in his steel-toed boots. “I want to go

, and he blames Cas for it.
Cas drops the manuscript he’s been painstakingly translating for the last hour and jumps to his feet, smiling brightly. “Finally! I was worried they wouldn’t be able to fill my order.”
“You sound disappointed.”
Dean tilts his head to rest against Castiel’s. “You don’t have to, y’know. I mean, I know living here and switching majors is kind of what messed everything up between you guys. Knowing about us probably won’t help things much with them, huh?”

Immediately there’s panic in her voice again. “But how will you pay the rent? And what about school? Are you going to be dropping out completely?”

He attempts a bright smile, but Castiel is well aware that it comes out weaker than it should. His smiles are going to be hard to come by again until he can get this bad situation worked out.
not to smile when he looks up. “Yes, Dean?”
A moment after the ‘
Since Dean is supposed to be in a meeting, Castiel is very surprised to find him sitting in the lobby of their apartment building. It’s small, but there is a little seating area with one couch and a chair next to the mailboxes. Generally, the only people who use it are the ones waiting for someone to come pick them up. Rarely is there someone waiting for someone else to arrive. Dean jumps up from the couch the moment Castiel walks through the door, not even giving him the time to find the mail key before he’s across the lobby and pulling him into a kiss.
“That’s fine.” Dean rubs a hand over the back of his neck and shrugs. “I don’t have any preference when it comes to bed. I can sleep pretty much anywhere.”
, even after marriage, were things to be ashamed of.”
Castiel pauses in the process of unpacking their new kitchen. He turns, eyebrow raised. “They were that hot, were they?”
. He needs to get back to his fish.
Anna curls up a little tighter on the other end of the couch, but keeps her eyes firmly focused on her book. As if that somehow denotes her innocence. The longer he looks at her, the shiftier she gets. She even raises her book up, trying to hide behind it and save herself from the force of Castiel’s glare.
He doesn’t have long to wait.
“Cas –” Dean pauses, but it’s more than enough to show just how wrecked his voice is. “Cas, do you want me to touch you?”
The silence is too weighty for Castiel’s liking and he clears his throat Dean starts emptying the bags onto the counter. “So, how was your hunt on the way here?”
If it were any other morning, Dean would have put the plates down with a cheeky ‘
. He definitely wants Cas around for more reasons that he’s willing to admit.
To be honest, Castiel isn't surprised at all. "I'm more surprised that you didn't build it all by yourself." He did such a good job on Castiel's bed, and that was all from scrap wood from Bobby's home, apparently. "But I already knew that you're a smart shopper." Dean always includes coupons with the grocery list and he knows when all the big sale days are. "And I've been told that second hand things can often be of better quality than fresh from the store, if you know what to look for and you're willing to put a little work into it."

scrimps and saves to use for anything fun.
Dean’s answer is to lean in, eyes already fluttering closed before he even brushes their lips together. Once. Twice. And on the third time Castiel moves his hand to the back of his neck to hold him in place and kiss him properly. That fluttering heat in the depths of his grace flares brightly again and Castiel sighs into the kiss.
There’s a gasp from the doorway and they both turn to find Dean standing there with his hand on his chest. Anna is next to him again, though this time she has a stack of napkins in one hand. Dean turns to her with that same shocked expression. “You like
Castiel tilts his head, regarding the quickly disappearing pile of pancakes in Dean’s lap. “They would probably taste the same. He just used the same mix that I use.”
Castiel, then Dean can’t seem to be able to keep his hands off him. It’s almost as though he’s being
." Dean steps back from the wall and lowers the board to the ground. "But I want to drill this bitch into the wall so no one can knock it the fuck down by accidentally brushing against it or some shit."
She stands up to meet him for the hug. “To be fair, he did bankroll the operation.”
He’s crowding closer, fingers sinking into Cas’s hair to hold him; cradle him; adjust the angle of each kiss so it’s just that little bit different from the last one. Arms find their way around his waist, pulling him flush against Cas’s chest and it’s like pressing up against a sun-warmed car on a summer’s day. He’s
is the one who is distracted. Instead of seeing the words on the paper, all he has behind his eyes is that flush in Dean’s cheeks. He drops his head against the desk with a sigh. “You spend so much time in my mind that I should charge you rent.”
It’s been a while since he’s slept with anyone sharing his bed, let alone a dog, but Dean manages to slip off to dream land surprisingly quickly. Maybe it’s because of the comforting weight on his chest, or maybe it’s because it’s
Alright then.
“I’ll go there and I’ll give you a quid pro quo too.” Castiel puts his hand over Dean’s, boldly linking their fingers together. “For every story of your childhood you give, then I’ll tell you another of my own.” He’s been far more open about his childhood than Dean has, but there’s still plenty he’s never spoken about.
There’s much less (zero) kissing done while they finish washing and drying what’s left in the sink. As Dean wipes down the stove and various surfaces, Castiel puts away everything else. He waits until they’re leaving the kitchen together before asking the one question that’s been on the tip of his tongue since Mary left them.

It takes a stupidly long amount of time for that to actually

person Dean is with. But that’s not an option and Castiel knows that he can’t have everything that he wants.
What Castiel
him the money? Or will money change him and he’s going to turn around and ask for more?
Unsurprisingly, the natural course is to eventually come to an end. But even then Castiel isn't upset with it. They find themselves on their sides facing each other. But, though the kisses have ended, the touching does not. Dean seems just as intent as Castiel is to map everything they haven't had the nerve to reach for in the last few weeks. It's surprising to find just how much he missed the feel of Dean's fingers raking through his hair or the trace of a fingertip along his cheek.
, what they get up to in their bedroom.
“We are totally going to talk about your choices later, young man.” Gabriel wags a finger at him before turning back to the kitchen. “I have some tarts that need tending to, but we’re sure as hell not done talking about this. Got it?”
!” There’s even the sound of clapping, and Castiel briefly imagines her holding the phone between her shoulder and ear to free up her hands. “I’m so happy for you! I knew you two were going to work out.” Her excitement is contagious and Castiel covers his face with his hand to hide his smile, even though he’s the only one who could see it. “
Oh God. Cas from the weekend isn’t a

by everyone he cares about – even if the betrayal isn’t exactly as Dean thinks it is. Where Dean is now, not just physically, is a terrifying place and Castiel doesn’t envy him for it. He should be the bigger fin-kin here, figuratively speaking, and go the distance to make Dean see that the bright-fin aren’t everything that he’s been led to believe they are.
His head pops up again, any irritation gone in an instant. “Yeah, you liked it?” Dean sits up a little straighter and gestures to what food remains. “I can make lunch and supper too. If you’re cool with it, just leave all the cooking to me!”
Castiel sighs and turns back onto his stomach. He rests his chin on his crossed arms and watches the shadows of the fire dance across the flowers that he planted with Aunt Amara earlier in the season. It takes him a moment to realize the lights among the flowers aren’t sparks but fireflies. Those are always a treat and he smiles.
For how much he paid for it, this mask is surprisingly good. No matter how much he twists and turns and tries to see with his peripheral vision, Castiel can’t make out what Dean is doing. Obviously it’s something to do with the rope and the bed frame, but why is it taking so long to figure out how to combine them? Can’t he just wrap it around? Oh, but then how is he going to bind Castiel’s legs too? Is it going to be long enough for that?
Unbidden, a tear snakes down Castiel’s cheek and he sniffles loudly. He presses the heel of his free hand into his eye, trying to stop the tears. Why now? Why did they have to come
Sam is almost on the verge of crying. There are actual tears in his eyes and he bounces Paul in his arms. Castiel has Mary in his and she is, miraculously, sleeping through Paul’s outburst. Castiel wonders if it’s because of the skin-on-skin contact where she’s resting on his stomach. She’s wearing only a diaper, pudgy little baby hands curled around a few of Castiel’s fingers. He’s on his back with a pillow under his head, enjoying her tiny little point of heat as he hums a soft colony lullaby.
touching him and he couldn’t move even if he wanted to.
and never his companionship. He was sure that Sam and Jess were different – considering how long they’ve been hanging out now. It’s nice to know that his worries were completely unfounded.
But how will he ever be able to forget the thought of Dean with someone else? Those faceless men and women are going to haunt him for a long time yet. The images of them in Dean’s arms, kissing him and doing everything that
“Don’t be a prude, Cassie. Look at my ass-tat and tell me how awesome it is!”
As predicted, the hunt was finished overnight. Dean and Sam returned to the room not long after midnight and, like they planned, they set out in the morning. Like last time, a knot of tension just
. But now he’s rather glad to have him here. They’ve had some fairly interesting conversations in recent days and those were pretty entertaining.

His thoughts cut off suddenly as Gabriel body-checks him out of the way with a heavy thud. He smacks at Michael with his tail until he gives Gabriel the room to float. Michael’s thoughts turn sour and disapproving, but Gabriel ignores them entirely in favour of swinging an arm around Castiel’s shoulders.
