“We need more allies RJ, you know this.  Did you see how many people they have already?” Castiel said with some annoyance.  He knew better than to walk into a dangerous mission with his head not on straight but what choice did he have?  They had to act quick just in case the other two heard word of the stress calls.
“Oh god, sweetheart. I don’t-ungh, I don’t know how long this show’s gonna last for me...it’s ahhh, it’s been a while.”
“Well...I’d really like that.  I’ll be quite honest with you Dean, It’s been a while since I’ve had a boyfriend.  My last one wasn’t very nice so I’ve stayed away from that,” Castiel said with a sigh.
“That’s my girl.  Talk to you later,” he said and hung up.  She hit the talk button and tossed the phone onto their bed.  Her daughter would be getting home any minute and usually, Hael would start dinner right about now.  Biting her lip she grabbed up the phone again and quickly dialed their favorite pizza place. It wasn’t exactly Friday but it was close enough.
“Do whatever you gotta do, sweetheart.” Though they both knew he needed to go, Castiel didn’t seem to be eager to leave his arms so Dean just held on a little tighter.
Bobby eyed both boys for a moment before dragging a hand down his face, “Alright, so...obviously you got somethin you wanna say,” he said.
“Ah!  So that would be a no on the conversation bit then,” he laughed, tossing Dean his phone back, “What are you waiting on little brother? You should take a cue from me and text him like I’m about to do with Amara!”
“Cool, cool, thanks...Charlie,” Dean said, relief singing through his veins. It was not the first time he’d been grateful they’d met her, and he was sure it wouldn’t be the last.
“Let me finish, please.  I know you would never cheat on me, you could never do that but it’s still true that you do feel something for him.  And if you don’t want to be mates anymore-”
Castiel nodded, chewing on his lip to the point where he could taste blood.  He knew MacCready was right but that didn’t mean he still wanted to do this now.  Dean could very well decide that all of this wasn’t worth it, especially over someone trying to battle against withdrawal.  It wasn’t as bad as he knew it could be but Castiel still felt the itch right below the surface. Swallowing hard he nodded again, “Fine, I’ll tell him now,” he said quietly.
Sam and Castiel shared a confused look but Sam hurried to do what his brother wanted.  It didn’t take much, especially with Anna already herding people toward the garage. She seemed to know what was going on but absolutely refused to tell Sam anything.  With a shake of his head he followed everyone out.
“Of course. It’ll take a while though, why don’t you take up some crackers and water,” he said.  Leeloo nodded but didn’t move right away. Things were quiet as Castiel began to make the stew, Jericho becoming more interested in the process then snuggling with his sister. Leeloo took the opportunity to grab up the items for her sister but before she could get too far Castiel gently grabbed at her wrist.
“You’re-” Mary started, and stopped quickly. She wasn’t quite able to speak the words just yet but something warm was spreading through her chest quickly and the mere idea of grandkids, however old it might have made her feel, was something she hadn’t dared to hope for and yet…
Castiel laughed softly, “I know.  Which you proved last night. God, I can’t believe I was that oblivious,” he said shaking his head.  A part of him was glad he was then he wouldn’t have this remarkable, unique engagement story. The other part of him was a little worried about what else he was missing around him.  He tried to not dwell on it too much, not wanting to take away from the amazing feeling coursing through him with finally being engaged to his soul mate. He gently brushed a kiss to each of Dean’s eyes, his cheekbones, chin, and then his lips.
“What did I do?  I’ll fix whatever it is Rhia,” she begged pulling the other girl closer.  Rhiannon laughed softly, her free hand lifting to wipe a stray tear. Leeloo hated herself a bit more when another one quickly fell.
Once the doc okayed it, as he suspected they would, he came in with a begrudging smile and rolled his eyes.
“Soon darlin,” he grinned, reaching around to get handfuls of MacCready’s ass.  It was a shame that such a nice part of the man’s body was covered up by so many layers.  He pulled MacCready in for another deep kiss when there was a shout from outside.
“Dean…” Castiel sighed, letting his head fall back.  He needed to move, to get over this paralyzing fear that was keeping his feet glued to the ground.  There was a gentle press of lips against his forehead and Castiel whimpered.
He and Benny gathered their gear, put on their armor and were set to leave before finally taking one last stroll through the compound along with the other groups that were leaving. Most people minded their own business, though a few who didn’t have chores stopped to wave goodbye, wish them luck, etcetera.
“Ken no!  Gods no,” Leeloo hissed, her head whipping around before moving to stand in front of him, “You are not defective, Kenton.  You’re just different but that doesn’t change a damn thing. You’re still family, one of us.”
He glanced up at the sky, praying that their string of good weather would hold.  That was another thing they were running short of. Stimpaks they had by the crateload but Radaway was growing harder and harder to find.  One team was definitely going to have to stop in Diamond City and hell, he himself was gonna be visiting Mayor Hancock over at Good Neighbor.  Maybe he could finally score the man’s supplier’s name.
Benny smiled at them, the familiar ache pulling in his chest at their affection towards the other.  He’d lost his whole family in a raider attack. Even his baby sister had been taken from him. Probably why he felt so close to Dean and his family.  They took him in and Mary had practically raised him the last several years.
“Cas...it’s understandable, with everything you’ve been through I’m surprised you can even stand to look at me. I-” Dean paused, he wanted so badly to believe that he could have it. Could get Cas and share a life with him, whatever that might have looked like. He wanted it so much he felt like it was engraved, etched into his bones.
Dean had been given jewelry a few times in his life. Another ring once from his dad when he was a kid. Obviously he no longer wore the dark black band but he did have it put away in a box at his mother’s house. Benny had once found a spool of wire when they were kids and decided they needed something to commemorate their lifelong friendship. They’d both lost the misshapen metal bracelets before the year was out. Bobby had once told him he could have something from his late wife’s trinket box and Dean had coveted the thin band that was etched with pretty white stones, but he’d never picked it up.
Charlie was down in the tombs when the door was suddenly pulled open and footsteps quickly followed.  She shelved the current book she had in her hands and rounded the corner to find one of her favorite people pacing the small space between her desk and the wall.  It had been a small gift Rufus gave her.  Rhonda had of course been against anyone being down here, poking their nose where it wasn’t wanted but Rufus turned that crazy glare on her until Rhonda all but stomped out.  Now Charlie had her own space and was working on a better system to chronicle all of their records.  She managed to not only get the power down here but fresh air and running water.
Castiel frowned as he watched the worry etch all over MacCready’s face and he reached out to grip onto his friend’s wrist, “Hey, he’ll be okay,” he said softly, dragging the pad of his thumb over the inside of MacCready’s wrist.
“I’m fine momma,” he said, fighting the urge to scream out the good news, to talk and talk until she realized just how beyond fine he was, but it was Cas’ choice when and who to tell so he clamped up tighter than a nun’s thighs and just grinned down at the gorgeous man that had become his entire world.
Bobby shared a look with another older Minuteman and sighed heavily, “Look kid, I ain’t gonna sugar coat it.  The Commonwealth isn’t kind. One minute you’re enjoying the quiet the next you’re fighting raiders or a god damn bloodbug with its bloatfly minions,” Bobby grunted, the others in the room nodded their heads with their own grunts.
“Now we just sit like this for a little bit and wash it all away again,”  Dean said, squeezing Cas’ hand as he held his head back a little to keep everything in place. “How’s school going?”
Castiel laughed, relief swooping through him, “Good, good,” he sighed, letting his head fall back against the couch a bit.  The waves outside were music to his ears and hummed a little, “It’s so good to be home,” he said looking over at MacCready. His friend looked relieved as well but there was something underneath it, a tension Castiel hadn’t noticed before.  He frowned a bit and sat up, “What is it?”
Castiel let Dean hold onto him for a bit longer before he managed to push the man away.  He didn’t know what to say so he stayed quiet, eyes never once leaving Dean’s face.
I nearly did the same thing.  Amara sent me the picture and I all but demanded she give you my number lol.
Dean shook his head, frowning Cas was far too good for him. If there was any kind of scale he knew where he’d be.
“But can we just...go down there?” he asked, turning to Benny with a confused look, before glancing back. “They’re probably not just open to the public are they?”
He waited until Cas was gone before he finished the speil and showed everyone what a used up filter looked like and roughly how much one would cost, though labor was subjective he liked to give them an average price so that no one was expected to pay too much for a job that could reasonably be done cheaper.
food,” he said, then realized it was starting to sound like a lecture...shit. “Sorry...kinda habit, my kid brother just started school on the west coast and I hassle him about this stuff too. Sorry.”
“Today...I’ll...I’ll do it today,” she said swallowing hard.  Caleb sighed, his hand coming up to touch the screen.
“Fuck…” he growled out.  This was going to hurt. He squeezed his eyes shut and rammed his shoulder against a tree and cried out when his shoulder popped back into its socket.  He was definitely going to feel that in the morning.
Castiel straightened his back and felt the usual calm that covered him like internal armor when he met with the other settlements slide into place, “I’m good,” he said with a firm nod.  MacCready shared a look with him and then Castiel gestured with a head tilt for Dean to continue leading the way.
Castiel had not expected that many people to rush through the gates all at once.  It made his vision blur a bit and his breathing hitched. Many of them were wearing Minutemen uniforms and Castiel had to turn away for a second, telling himself over and over again that he could do this.
“Cas, whatever it is, we can work it out just...I can’t come to you… I’ve been drinking. Can you-can I call you a cab? Please?” Dean asked, an almost panicked worry in his chest. He didn’t want to think of Cas being in so much pain, especially when he couldn’t get to him.
“Sorry, sorry but wow, Dean!” she hissed, covering her mouth as he quickly put the ring away, “I knew from the moment you two met that this would end up happening but I’m even more proud now that soon you’ll be my brother in law,” she said quietly, squeezing at his wrist before bounding over to her two brothers to engulf them into a group hug.
She didn’t let him talk, only put a finger to his lips to keep him quiet a little longer. “Did you know that he asked me for help, he begged me to give him ideas on dates you’d like, your favorite foods, music, any clue. He damn near offered up everything he has on a silver platter if I’d just give him something, anything to use to connect with you and do you know what I told him?”
“Oh wooah,” he said, as he tripped over a small divot in the soil but before he could hit the dirt warm, hard muscle was wrapped around him, holding him only about a foot from the ground.
MacCready didn’t linger any longer, every precious second was one that both Castiel and Dean could be in danger, and even without his promise, he didn’t want anything to happen to either of them.
Hael sighed and tried to wrack her brain for an idea when she heard Quinn singing.  She looked over again and felt a literal light bulb click on her head.
“No, no.  I don’t want to be a disappointment to her,” Kenton quickly explained.  He was an Alpha and Pogue was an Omega. Never once did he have the typical urge most Alphas had around Omegas.  Pogue smelled amazing, like bursts of oranges but that was it. Ever since he presented Kenton didn’t remember having a rut either.  It was something he never said out loud or told his mothers about.
Billie had been a complete surprise. She actually contacted Rowena first. Both of them were of the cat family even though Billie was a different species. Dean had been ignorant and didn’t even know were-cougars existed until that point. He had met with the two women and Dean liked Billie instantly. She was intense, took no sass, and protected her people with every fiber of her being. She’d been with them for the past five years now and Dean had a feeling there was another reason entirely for why the woman insisted on visiting Tillamook then having them travel to her home in New Mexico. He hadn’t figured it out yet but he was determined to.
For one split second Castiel thought about pushing Dean off of him, to blame him for everything that had happened but how could he?  Dean hadn’t even known the man was his grandfather until now.
about Dean being a Minuteman and a good guy, but he suspected Benny was one as well. Not to mention the fact that they’d been searching for them after they hit the castle and he still didn’t know why. “I’m not saying forever, but stay here with us for the night, or maybe a couple of days if necessary.”
“Yeah.  Make sure you guys get some breakfast and brush your teeth,” She said and made her way to her own bedroom.  There were a few messages from Caleb, asking her to skype with him this morning. It was more than likely about the same thing they had talked about yesterday but she felt horrible for Caleb.  He thought Rhiannon hated him now and Leeloo was too much of a chicken to talk to her about it.
Castiel nodded, their hands finding each other again and squeezing.  The things his sister had gone through still left him with nightmares and he’d barely gotten a taste of it.  She’d blocked him out and kept the wall up so tightly, he never got the chance to take some of the weight she was carrying.  There were times like right then, he felt like a horrible brother. Selfish, self-righteous, and sometimes even egotistical.  Everything wasn’t about him.
“Thank you,” Castiel said, his cheeks warming at the compliment, “I figured getting a fitted one would look better for tonight,” he said, turning to look at himself in the mirror.  Most of his suits were fine, though a lot of them were outdated they still fit. For tonight though, he wanted to look good.
Dean stopped, tempted to turn and say something in their defense, but instead, he just kept moving. Benny was right, it was best not to draw attention to themselves if the guy was that bitter toward their kind. He didn’t like the feeling it gave him but leaving made sense, so that’s what they did.
“More than likely,  I’ll tell ya one thing, the stories they tell back at home pales in comparison,” Benny scoffed, letting MacCready help him outside.
“Two fractured ribs, at least, a broken arm, hell I don’t know...maybe some internal bleeding but I don’t want to operate unless absolutely necessary, so we’ll put that off for now. Here, take this...it’s not going to help much but it’s better than nothing,” The doc said, popping two small tablets into Benny’s mouth with a clean drink of water.
“I know this next part is going to sound entirely insane...I’m not even sure either of you will believe me.  I mean...fuck, I didn’t believe it, didn’t want to at first,” Castiel said looking down at his lap.  Finally, he squeezed his eyes shut and held his breath.
“I believe she’s doing her weekly perimeter check with Garth.  What’s up honey?” she asked, reaching over to turn down the radio.  Kenton shrugged, his focus narrowing down on the treat in his hand. He’d been so confident in what he wanted to ask his mom Charlie but now that there was a wait, it dwindled.  Ever since his birthday and his talk with Leeloo, he’d been working on the courage to bring it up but with it came along a huge wave of nerves. It didn’t matter how much Leeloo tried to reassure him, there was still that lingering fear that there really was something wrong with him.  That he was off more than any of them realized.
“I don’t gotta do nothin Lee,” He grumbled getting up so fast she nearly fell off the log.  The warmth where his hand had been in hers was cold now and she looked up at him grumpily.
He scrubbed a hand down his face and sighed. “Maybe next time just take a closer look at things before you let your own minds be deceived by a few passing glances from the outside of a relationship.”
“Go find your man and get some sleep, we’ll talk more in the morning,” MacCready said, mostly letting it go because he had his own man to find. The thoughts of curling up in Benny’s arms for the night and resting was too tempting to resist. They’d leave early in the morning and not only would it be good for Castiel to deal with this, away from the community, but he also knew that if Dean was in the audience, it wouldn’t be shoved under the rug.
Seventeen. They had a total of seventeen different packs allied all together with Dean holding the title of High King Alpha.  He had tried to fight it and still to this day would find himself flushing when someone addressed him as that but now, he could understand the necessity of it.
“Y’know you could have said somethin,” Dean whispered softly against Castiel’s ear as he put his arms around his waist, pressed against his back. He didn’t want to upset Inias further, but he also had a problem keeping his hands off Cas if he was nearby. “I’d have liked to know what was coming.”
“You’re gonna be an Uncle, Sam...Cas is pregnant.” He said the words softly, almost as if he couldn’t believe it himself because it seemed-, well all of it seemed a little too good to be true but he wasn’t going to try to poke any holes in it. Castiel was more than he could have ever hoped for, not to mention having the chance to start his own family, to add have a family that actually feels like family again.
“It’s not all that matters, Cas…” Dean said, shaking his head. “Yes, you’re beautiful and I’m not gonna lie, maybe without that I might not have gotten the chance to know you,”  he started, pausing to kiss at the soft skin of Castiel’s shoulder, “but you are so much more than just this. The best parts of you have nothing to do with how gorgeous you are.”
“It’s okay, we’ll get this cleaned up first and then you can say… or do, whatever it is you had planned,” Dean grinned, scooting Cas off his lap so he could stand and guide him over to the sink. When Cas went to reach for the tap, Dean stopped him. “Here, I’ve got it, it can get really hot pretty quick. I don’t want you gettin’ burned.”
“Yeah, I got that...just wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. He’s been staring Cas down all morning and I’m not a fan, whatever it is though, it’s probably bad…” Dean squinted at the bright sun, they’d been on the road for hours, but they started before it was even truly light outside. The sun was just at its peak, the bright light of the afternoon filtering directly into his line of sight.
It was hard to contain his laughter and his excitement, but he managed long enough to take a few photos and then gently eased the band out of Cas’ hand, causing him to twitch a little.
“There’s nothing to talk about Lee,” she said softly.  Leeloo shook her head and moved around until she was gazing up into her mate’s face.  Those cobalt blue eyes shined down at her and Leeloo gently cupped her cheek.
“No, he hasn’t. He got in one of his moods the moment you left. I think he was hoping you’d take him with you this time. I don’t know what to tell him. It’s not like I can say you can’t go because your sister would be the one to go cause she’s going to take your father’s place someday,” Castiel sighed rubbing at his face again.
“Actually, it’s about to get even more complicated...that’s not all the news we have to share,” he started, then launched into the story of their battle at The Slog and finding his cousin and all the information they’d been able to extract from him before finally cutting him down.
“My face feels great now,” Castiel hummed, making faces to feel how tight his skin felt now.  Dean chuckled at him but for once, Castiel didn’t blush. He gave his
A pretty blonde woman eyed Dean suspiciously but pulled a stretcher from one of the loads and laid a few warm blankets on it. He gently eased Cas onto the soft fabric and let out a painful sound. It hurt so much to see him like this, it wasn’t the tears or the vomit even that had put Dean off but the pale, placid color of his skin, the way he looked even before he’d heard them out, like he’d worked himself to death just so he didn’t have to stop, didn’t have to think.
“Yeah, just wondering if it would be okay if I could go to the mall this weekend?  I’m not sure who else would go but it’ll be a group,” he said.
He pulled Cas’ hand to his lips and gave it a soft kiss, “I’ll be right back sweetheart, I’ve gotta go take a leak.”
Benny smiled, recognizing the look on his friend’s face immediately.  He squeezed at Dean’s shoulder, “Go on, he looks ready to fall over.  I’ll let everyone know to give you a bit before they come hounding ya,” Benny said.
“Where’s that kid of yours?” Bobby asked glancing around the settlement.  It was still early in the morning but the Winchester boys were always up with the sun, just like their mother.
Castiel dragged his hand down his face and nodded, “I will,  I promise. Just, let me get through this first okay-”
He walked in front of the other two as they headed back toward the group, making sure to announce that Castiel was fine, he’d just passed out from exhaustion before anyone got too trigger happy. Most of the crew were non-violent in nature, but they also wielded weapons like nobody’s business when necessary.
Castiel hummed softly, “I can’t wait, they smell fantastic,” he said and watched as Dean set the oven timer, “Can we watch a movie after they’re done?” he asked biting his lip.  Hey may or may not have ulterior motives but Dean didn’t know that...not yet anyway.
“You’re…” Dean started, then paused cause he wasn’t sure how to say it. She looked up at him with a raised brow and a bit of a smirk.
“Oh no you don’t,” Amara muttered, standing up to follow after him. He was fast, but she knew him better than he knew himself and it made it easy to track him down. Although it was much less comfortable outside, apparently Castiel wanted to be dramatic so she would indulge him. It didn’t happen often.
Before Dean could answer Benny gripped his shoulder, “We live in a settlement looking to trade with them, that’s all,” he said.
“Fucking hell,” Castiel growled, “I don’t think your rifle is gonna take that thing out,” he whispered.  They were going to have to split up, one to draw the behemoth away and the other to take out the guards outside.  It set his teeth on edge.
“No, no you wouldn’t do that…” MacCready agreed. Castiel was loyal to him, to a fault. It wasn’t just what they’d been through, but also the work they’d done together that tied them both up in knots at the thoughts of losing it. He knew that. Benny hadn’t even questioned him for a moment but Benny was also a kinder, gentler person than Dean.
They tried to make it fair by traveling to each pack’s home bases but some were more difficult than others. In the past few years they’d managed to get several safe houses in each of their allied states and now were in discussion in buying land to hold these specific meetings. Dean was all for it, but the priority was still the safe houses.
thought it would be. Castiel had poured everything he had into making his home safe, efficient, unreliant on outside help...not as much because he wanted to, but because he’d felt he
“Having five pups is hard,” Castiel groaned rubbing at his forehead as both of them laughed.  Samandriel grabbed at Castiel’s nearly empty mug and refilled it from the pot next to the sink.  Castiel grumbled a thank and almost downed the entire thing.
“Mmm, am now yeah,” Dean grinned, “One of us is a little sneakier than the other...that and you sleep like a fucking log.”
Castiel eyed Dean suspiciously and then moved around him to get a look at the room.  He gasped, hand flying up to his mouth as he saw tables with different activities for them to do.  He hurried over to one and smiled so wide his cheeks hurt.
“Dean wants another baby,” Castiel said, quickly looking up to gauge his sister’s reaction.  She barely flinched.
“See ya in a few Sammy,” Dean said, scrubbing at the kid’s long hair until he squawked and shoved him away.
“Thanks.  You having fun?” Kenton asked softly.  Pogue smiled up at him and nodded. Besides Leeloo and Mason, Kenton had never seen eyes so mixed with blue and green before.  He couldn't help himself from staring and more than once was caught not listening to what Pogue was trying to say. Thankfully though, he never teased Kenton about it, just smiled and ducked his face down.
Leeloo smiled brightly, “Good.  I was thinking...maybe he can come to your birthday?  That way we can spend some time together all three of us?  I hate that he’s so far away,” she said. Rhiannon nodded eagerly.
Something strange was going on with Dean but Castiel couldn’t figure out what it was.  Then again, if finding out the truth meant that these dates would end, he didn’t want to figure it out.  They’d gone one plenty of dates before but the recent ones were more...spontaneous and romantic.
“You too, boss.” MacCready squeezed Castiel tight in against his chest and grinned. It hadn’t been a long separation, just a few days but he’d been even more worried about them now that his friend was expecting. It took quite a bit of restraint to keep himself from reaching out and feeling for any kind of change that might be there, but it wasn’t his place and he knew they hadn’t been back long enough to really tell anyone about it, so he didn’t.
Castiel shook his head as he turned Dean’s hands to kiss each of his palms then his wrists, “No, never again.  I don’t care what they say anymore, you’re more important to me than their whispered...
He waited until Cas moved into the bathroom before he went to the kitchen to throw together a small snack and some chamomile tea for Cas, just in case he wanted something. Once he had it ready he made his way back to the bedroom so he could change out of his work clothes, himself.
Benny glanced up and frowned, getting up to his feet to brush off the dirt from his pants, “Sure, I’ll be right back to help you with the melons,” he said to Samandriel with a soft smile.  He followed MacCready away from the garden until they were relatively alone.
“Let’s get him back to Jamaica Plains for the night,” Castiel said firmly, leaving no room for any arguments.
“Like what?  Like you got your daddy’s and your grandaddy’s blood runnin’ through your veins? You’re just some third-generation fuckup on both side-” MacCready growled out before Castiel was pushing at him.
Benny shook his head, following Dean to the room filled with cots.  There were two others in there who barely gave them a nod. It made him thankful for the way Bobby ran things back home and he couldn't wait to get back.  The got their stuff locked away in the footlockers and Benny pulled Dean towards the food and drink stand, getting them both cold glasses of purified water.
Castiel felt his chest hitch but regained focus.  His group was moving closer to the caravans, protecting the Brahmins while Dean and Castiel took out the remaining raiders who thought they still had a chance.  His weapon clicked and he cursed, launching his knife into a raider’s skull as he blindly felt for Dean’s sidearm. He got it out and shot two more.
He chuckled to himself and hoped he could keep it all contained until show time...the truth was, the ring felt as if it was burning a hole in his pocket even before he’d taken it out of the cooler. Dean wanted nothing more than to see it settled on Cas’ left hand.
“I did, also saw little ones and I know you did too. Not that I mind, boss I just want you to be honest with me. If I’m gonna die today, I damn sure want you to acknowledge the reason why,” MacCready said, shaking his head to himself. Castiel pretended to be a man of steel and for the most part he was, but you put anything human and under the age of ten in front of him and the man melted into a pile of goo on the inside.
From what he’d seen Dean was brash and hard-edged...well except when it came to Castiel. Nothing made that man go softer than one look at Castiel, even more so now with the baby…
“Hi sweetheart, how was school?” Hael asked instantly going into the fridge to get her daughter a bottle of juice.  Quinn took it with a quiet thank you and pulled herself up into one of the stools.
Castiel blinked a few times, his thoughts rushing back to the present as his foot caught on a rock and he stumbled a bit.  Dean caught his elbow and he smiled up at the man, blushing a bit at his clumsiness. Usually, he was much more focused than this but yesterday still had him pretty rattled.  MacCready’s pointed looks weren’t helping.
Okay, so I am well aware that...too many of my wolves are related to each other! Lmao.  Just so we are clear, Henry and Willa are NOT blood-related. They are some weird second cousin thing or whatever that is.  I never understood that whole, third uncle twice removed stuff. Anyway, I have thought about this until I had a migraine and even talked with my writing partner until SHE had a migraine too lmao.
Castiel surged up, interrupting him with a kiss.  Dean’s breath fanned out over his cheek and Castiel couldn’t help smiling, his hands lifting from Dean’s shoulders to cup his face, “Stop, please?  I’m not going to shoot you and you don’t deserve it, please believe me?” he said, letting his eyes show just how sincere he was.
got out of it, so if you were trying to say something different, maybe you better practice having a goddamn conversation. Hell, I’ll even tell you how to start it; Benny, I’m sorry I was such a dick, of course, I trust you, you see it’s just that I’ve got this stick shoved so far up my-”
He sat up the camera to record, grinning as he showed the bottom half of the ring to the lens and then called out to his soon-to-be fiance. “Hey Cas, will you come fix my pocket square, it won’t sit straight…heh-straight,” Dean added in a softer tone for just the camera before he quickly tucked the kerchief along with the ring into his suit pocket.
Cain frowned and looked down at the phone, message alerts were coming in like crazy from Castiel, “Bro, you sure?  You’ve been waiting for Cas to reach out and now he is,” he said.
“I’m not sure what’s wrong with me.  Everyone around me is already pairing up with others like they’re supposed to do after presenting,” Kenton whispered.
“My name is Castiel Novak, this is my companion MacCready.  We’re from the settlement Nordhagen Beach-”
Dean was still snoring softly as Castiel slowly rose from the bed and crossing over to where Dean had dropped off their gear.  His favored rifle sat leaning up against the wall and Castiel unscrewed the scope to drop two items into his palm.  They were something he’d been holding onto for a very, very long time.  No one knew, not even MacCready, hell he even lied to himself about it.  The images of what he’d seen in the aftermath of the attack were tattooed into his skull.  He’d gone back to Sommerville a couple of days later, alone.  His father had made them himself, two silver rings with wings carved into each of them.  They were beautiful and it had made Castiel sick thinking of those assholes pawning them off to some low life merchant trader.
Dean took apart his new weapons, careful as he could be, he needed to know how they worked. It was his way of getting to know them, so to speak, and something he did with every weapon he handled. Even if it was only a short trip to the range.
Castiel smiled softly.  He could barely make a decision on what to study and here this man was, doing so many different things at once.
“Dean-o, this one over here is for you,” Bobby said pointing to the heavy leather gauntlets, the thick trench coat, and the iron breastplate, “May not look like much but it’ll protect you, even from bullet sprays.  Just...try not to get shot at point blank.”
Dean swallowed, his heart pounding so hard against his ribs that he felt it was going to escape right out of his chest. “Look, I know this is probably the last thing you want to hear but Cas...Benny and I, we’re from Sanctuary Hills...we’re Minutemen.”
“Rhia stop!” she called out, holding her side as it cramped a little.  Her mate stopped in mid-step and Leeloo could hear her sigh even from where she stood.
“You guys ever get flooded, being this close to the water?” Dean asked curiously, it wasn’t like he was looking for faults or anything but he wouldn’t mind it if Cas wanted to relocate, though he wouldn’t ask it of him. Dean knew how important these settlements were, these people were to Cas and he’d have just as hard of a time leaving his mom, Sammy, and Bobby...not to mention Benny if that douchebag MacCready didn’t get his shit together.
“Thank you!” Benny said with a wink, “Just go with it, I’ve learned to just...nod,” he chuckled leading the way back to their table.  The way Castiel’s eyes lit up when he saw the plate had even Benny’s heart swelling.  It was just that adorable.
“That they did honey,” she said, clearing her throat, “I have a feeling though that your late shifting isn’t the only thing bothering you though.”
“Oh Lord…” Weathers gasped, quickly moving into action, “What’s your name?” he asked the one on the bed.
Castiel woke with a start, a pounding pressure forming behind his eyes as he sat up.  He’d fallen asleep at the kitchen table, Aine’s tea still on the counter. He cursed softly to himself and pulled himself to his feet.  The moment all his pups were under the same roof it was as if the exhaustion had been waiting to slam into him all at once. He crept upstairs and gently pushed the door open to Aine’s room to find all five of them still curled around each other sleeping soundly.  Castiel smiled to himself and closed the door.
MacCready muffled his snort but still managed to earn a glare from Castiel, though he wasn’t the least bit ashamed of it. Dean was funny, cute if you liked em’ small, but funny even if you didn’t.
Castiel dragged his fingers through his wet hair, grateful to have the last few days of dust and now blood off of him.  He got dressed in some of the spare clothing he always brought with him and sighed, needing to get back outside to help get the turrets and guard towers built.  He noticed Dean standing off to the side and bit his lip, debating for a split second before finding himself heading over to the guy.
“Here you go, now make sure before you leave to get suited up.  Bobby’s in the armory already and he can help you pick the right ones,” Mary said with a heavy sigh.
“I’ve um...I’ve been thinking more about what we’d had talked about before...you know, making allies with the Brotherhood as well?” Castiel said biting his lip.
“Fuck, really?’ MacCready asked, that seemed almost unbelievable, like impossibly unbelievable but the look Dean said it with, rankled him.
Castiel felt the warmth of Dean’s hand on his arm and heat rushed through his body, making his face go a little pink.
He finally made it to the small house out by the river that ran along Sanctuary Hills. It wasn’t in perfect condition, no houses really were any more, but it was sturdy and warm, and there were half a dozen beds on the top floor.
“Besides, it’s your special day and I, as your Alpha mate, must show my precious Omega just how much I cherish him,” Dean teased.  Castiel snorted, bucking up his hips just enough to feel Dean’s erection drag between his cheeks.
Benny smiled, no wonder these people trusted Castiel so much.  He kept them safe, even when he was down for the count. This place could take care of itself.  There were people training in a field close behind the main house, a gun range to the right of it.  It was truly amazing. He kept walking around, smiling at people who looked up and waved almost hesitantly.  There was a familiar face sitting on one of the picnic tables, fingers gently cleaning his rifle and Benny found himself slowly walking over.
“I’m sorry for being such an ass,” he said softly. Leeloo snorted, punching him in the arm for the curse. He gave her a true smile, one that stretched across his lips and reached his eyes.
“Sounds good, see ya around kid,” Benny said with a wave.  Once they were back upstairs Benny grabbed at Dean’s arm, “You wanna head straight home?” he asked with a quirked brow.
Castiel groaned when Dean’s arms were back around him, settling the grumbling of his stomach.  It sucked being sick but it was proof that there was life growing inside of him and he’d rather deal with the sickness to have that small little proof.  He wasn’t sure when he finally fell asleep but when he woke up he was curled up against Dean’s chest and the sun was was lowering into the horizon.  The orange glow filtering between the wooden slats of the house.  Castiel hummed a little, snuggling closer to his boyfriend and bit his lip.  He was really beginning to hate that word.  It was pretty insignificant to how he truly felt about Dean but Castiel wasn’t exactly sure how well Dean would take to being called something else...something more.
“Thanks mom,” Dean copied, kissing at her other cheek. “We’ll be back before you know it, don’t drive Sammy crazy with too much worryin’ okay?”
“We’re uh, lookin for someone.  Bobby Singer sent us,” Benny answered.  The two looked at each other and shrugged.
Dean winced a bit but gave her his most charming smile. “Kinda already have, told them...and Mac too.”
It wouldn’t be easy to find alone time to add the last one, though he already knew exactly what he wanted to do for the photo, but he’d manage. If nothing else he’d let Sam in on the surprise and his nerdy brother was always handy for a long winded distraction.
“Wait, hold up a second.  You mean to tell me that Samuel Campbell, big scary villain is personally going after Castiel because as a kid...he survived that attack?  Why in the hell…” Bobby grunted, looking around the room before sitting down in one of the armchairs left open, “I just don’t understand why he’d waste the time and energy."
“Cready!” Castiel yelled.  He didn’t need to hear his friend’s acknowledgment, he charged forward, tackling one of the last standing raiders.
“I’m gonna let you in on a little secret. I know you’ve been following the posts and I’m grateful for all your encouragement but I just wanted to give you a heads up that it’s all about to be over,” he said, smiling to himself. “This weekend, I’m finally going to do it, I’m going to give him the ring and I’m going to ask him to marry me. No more waiting. This is DriverDean, and I’m asking you guys to keep it quiet for just a little longer. He’ll find out soon enough. Later!”
Castiel swallowed hard and nodded, words not forming in his head well enough for him to speak.  He got his rifle back around him and headed towards his group, checking each of them for himself before calling out for them all to move out.
And that's how Charlie found them.  Snuggled up on the window seat while he slowly calmed down.  He felt her hands on his back and shoulder, making him whine pathetically.
“I need you to hear something...those kids at your school,” he started, watching as Cas visibly flinched. “They don’t know me. They think they do; because my dad’s a big wig around town. They think they know us, all of us, but they don’t. It’s fucking disgusting how they act over us sometimes and I’m sorry that it meant you got a bunch of stupid shit said to you.”
“I’m going to help.  Besides, there’s something I want to talk to you about,” he said softly.  She gave him a curious look but he held a finger up to his lips. Once Dean got the herd that was their pups out the door for lessons Leeloo turned to him with raised brows.
Kenton shook his head and leaned back against the wall, his eyes flitting over to the garden.  The herbs were blooming in abundance and he loved helping his momma in the evening. All the different scents were always soothing and the hard work settled both him and the constantly pacing wolf within himself.
“It was a monumental fuck up okay, we know that.  We’re trying to fix it, we need your help. Please?” Benny asked gently, turning his full attention to MacCready.
Sam flushed, not even minding that Dean had called him Sammy...again, “Thanks. I had to make sure my big brother had the best.  Bobby’s been hinting at this for a while now so I’ve been making sure to keep the best pieces for myself,” he explained.
Castiel quirked up a brow and nodded.  This had to be about what had almost happened while they were on the road.  It had to be. He sighed softly and lead the way to the bath house, closing the door behind Dean before turning to him, “Look Dean, I-”
“And you didn’t think that might be something worth sharing?” Dean said, his voice going dangerously cold at the thought of Benny not telling him...Cas not telling him...he hated being left in the dark. It wasn’t that they had a history or that they’d probably fucked but the feeling of betrayal in his mind was more connected with the fact that Cas didn’t trust him enough to tell him.
“Cricket? Miller? I don’t know half of these people...Carla though...I won’t be forgetting her any time soon,” Dean confessed, the woman made his skin crawl in the most unpleasant way. Worse than feeling a threat out in the Commonwealth, just his hair constantly on end and relentless prickles of anxiety.
“Make sure everyone else is,” he said softly before slumping a little against Dean, thankfully the man was sturdy and managed to hold his weight.
they talk...right? And while I’m not usually one for gossip; I know you’re not the only one who’s involved here,” she said, shaking her head at him. “You might not see it, Dean-I get the feeling he’s not very forthcoming with his emotions, so he isn’t going to speak up because you’re hurting his feelings. Are you really okay with that?”
“No- no, stupid stupid!” Dean cursed, burying his face in his hands, before scrubbing them over his face. “Real fuckin’ cool, Winchester. Might as well just pack his bags for him,” he grunted.
“Not exactly what I was talking about but the food too,” She grinned, elbowing him in the side and then did an obvious show of looking towards Castiel.
“Dick,” Cain chuckled, “So...have you actually spoken to your future husband then?  Or you just stalking his picture? He’s kinda young for you though,” he teased.
“Listen, I believe we are all born for a reason. That we are given some kind of purpose. Whether it’s being a healer or a tracker to the next Conri. Either way, it contributes to the pack,” she said.  When she didn’t get a response she continued, “Let me ask you this then...do you believe that I think less of Rhiannon because one, she wasn’t born ‘powerful’ or that her dad is an Omega training to be a healer?”
“Dude,” Benny gasped.  Behind the bar was a freaking robot.  One with three arms and what looked like three eyes.  His form was suspended in the air by the jets that sputtered off and on beneath him.
it that way. MacCready had been shocked to his core the first time he’d laid eyes on the place, and it wasn’t nearly as progressed that day.
He was ready to put Mac on the ground until a hiss from Cas pulled their attention away. He was grabbing at his side and Dean felt a heavy shudder of fear run up his spine. He pulled Cas in against him as they both went down to the ground, Dean thankfully under him so his landing was padded.
Though, there were some days he wondered if he’d been born off.  He was the oldest of the pups and was one of the last to learn how to shift.  Everyone around him seemed to already be pairing off but the idea of that left a weird taste in his mouth.
MacCready did as he said, taking short bursts as to not disrupt Benny’s breathing any more than necessary, but he finally got him pulled into the shade and as well hidden as he was going to get. Thankfully it was a short trip. “I’ll be right back...don’t die or anything.”
lay a finger on him. For fuck’s sake, Mac...what kind of man do you take me for?” Both Cas and MacCready stared at him like he’d lost his fucking mind.
Castiel looked out in the crowd and felt his eyes tighten.  Inias was staring up at him, his entire body shaking as the tears began to fall.  Inias had been even younger than him when they escaped Sommerville.
“Well hey, we see all kindsa stuff out there, I’m not makin’ any promises or anything but maybe we can bring you back something to play around with, we bring back stuff for Sammy all the time,” he said, though usually when he brought anything back it was the short-term scouting trips that were barely an hour or two outside the city. The only things he’d been allowed to do back then.
“Dean!” he cried, speeding up.  He had to watch as Dean got knocked down on his ass, a huge knife appearing in the raider’s hand as he knelt over Dean.  Everything splintered, his vision narrowing in and slowing down. Nothing else mattered at that moment, only getting to Dean in time.  He dropped everything, yanking out his own knife. He could see the wide set of fear in Dean’s eyes as he finally closed in, Castiel’s hand yanking back the raiders head as he viciously slit his throat.  He kicked the body away with a growl and sank to his knees next to Dean.
“But...Dean, what’s wrong with what I’m wearing now? I was trying to look good for you...” Castiel pouted and then looked at the outfit on the dryer, “Um…”
“Yes, you absolute idiot!” MacCready said, relief forcing him to sag on the ground beside the larger man. He knew he needed to get up, even if Benny couldn’t. Dean and Castiel still needed help, but he couldn’t bring himself to leave just yet. “Thought I lost you there for a minute, you can’t do shit like that. I-you-ugh!”
“Of course, I know you’re a busy guy...you’re important to these people Cas..I’m not gonna drag you away from all that just to feed my own ego. When I asked you to go back with me, I really did just mean a quick trip.” Dean huffed out a small chuckle and shook his head at his ridiculous boyfriend.
“Yes, and we also saw you getting high off of Jet as well,” Rachel said from behind Muriel.  Castiel flinched again, his eyes squeezing shut. Fuck. He hadn’t even told MacCready about that yet.
“Meg...I think I might have an idea.  How many Alphas do we have in the area that aren't mated?” Hael asked.  Meg spluttered and Hael could have sworn she heard the phone drop.
“Don’t you fret none kid.  I know you’ll get them worked out, after Dean-o and I speak with Bobby, why don’t you show us what you got cooked up and ready to go,” Benny suggested.  He couldn’t help grinning at how the kid lit up and grinned like a maniac.
“You gonna tell me what this is about?” he asked, moving to help Dean get the projector screen down.  They usually used it for movie nights out on the lawn but that hadn’t been part of the plans for the evening.
Sam scrunched up his face in confusion until it hit him and his eyes widened along with his smile, “Holy shit!  That’s awesome!” Sam cried surging forward to hug them both, “Welcome to the family bro,” Sam chuckled.
Castiel couldn’t stop smiling, it was permanently glued to his face now.  Even as they passed their friends who teased them endlessly, the smile never wavered.  They walked hand in hand towards Sam’s workshop and the moment he saw Sam, that was when the nerves kicked in a bit.
He took one more quick look at his hair, before calling it done. He was grateful for the timing of this particular chance meeting because he’d already had some burgers that had been marinating in his fridge all day so he grabbed a quick shower and then grilled them up and grabbed a handful of shit from the pantry for sides.
“Because I don’t want to like them RJ!” Castiel shouted, jumping to his feet to start pacing.  His heart was thundering in his ears, blood running too hot under his skin, “They’re working with
His heart leaped to his throat and he swallowed hard around it, trying not to let his fears get the best of him. “Muscles?” he said, his voice marking his panic clearly. “Benny? Ben-, come on man, don't do this…”
“I’m scared that I’m not going to be able to connect with anyone.  That I’ll never have a mate because I feel like there’s something holding me back,” he finally confessed after a while of sitting there and staring.  His momma was being incredibly patient with him, letting him take his time and gathering his thoughts. He looked back at her and saw a soft, thoughtful expression on her face.
“We just need to get him away from the others,” the words were stale in his mouth.  He pulled his rifle around from his back and began checking it and his extra ammo rounds that they had gotten lucky to purchase from a caravan making its rounds.  Even more so he was just happy it wasn’t that wench Trashcan Carla. Even though it seemed like they had plenty, he just prayed that was actually enough or they’d be running for a while.
“UNfgh-” Dean grunted as Cas squeezed a hand around him. He let out another grunt and a short hiss of breath before he could continue, “I don’t know if that’s an insult or a compliment,” he said, then let his head fall back against the bed as they rolled over to change position.
Samandriel felt a heat along the back of his neck and if it hadn’t been pretty overcast, he’d have assumed it was just the sun. But clouds were hanging overhead, warning a storm was on the way. He turned a few different times to see MacCready glaring at something, but he wasn’t sure what.
Castiel snorted, “Hopefully he won’t make it worse,” he sighed going back to shoveling food into his mouth.
“None taken Amara, truly. Pay it back whenever you can,” Dean said. She smiled at him and leaned back. The meeting continued for the next thirty minutes, mostly about business and any trouble that the packs may be experiencing. Dean sighed with relief when the worst seemed to be a squabbling couple here in the Texas pack. Cesar and Jesse both rolled their eyes as they explained the whole story. Dean agreed that it would be best to annul the mating before the fighting got even worse.
The air in Castiel’s lungs was stuck and it took a moment for him to catch up.  He gently pushed the other one onto Dean’s finger and finally let out a sob, “Damn hormones,” he tried to joke but it came out all garbled and he hiccuped.
Amara pulled him in against her chest, hugging around him tightly in the short bit of silence before she continued. “Dean said you were worth it, and he’s right.”
“And Aine, she was special from the moment her heart began to beat,” she said with a soft smile. Castiel teared up a little and nodded, not able to stop himself from pulling his oldest closer and kiss her cheek.
But now...now was different.  Leeloo reached up again to cradle Rhiannon’s jaw and they moved in unison.  The moment their lips touched Leeloo felt something that had been hallow in her chest finally fill and couldn’t help sighing.  Rhiannon seemed to be in the same boat as her arms circled around Leeloo’s waist again.
“There were many Omegas who lost their lives once we saved them.  Being so overwhelmed with being safe and knowing they were free...many of them just let go.  We brought them here. There’s a small memorial for them that I can take you to go see.”
“Oh…” he gasped when he read the text.  In all honesty, he hadn’t expected the older man to message him at all!  He quickly saved the number to his phone and then replied.
“It’s okay. You should come home now though and apologize to Daddy. Then come snuggle with us because Aine misses you and with her headaches, she doesn’t feel right until all of us are there,” she said softly. Mason winced, a wave of guilt washing that smile right off his face. She felt bad for doing it but he still needed to deal with the consequence for his actions.
“Nope.  I watch your blog,” she grinned, “It’s just too fucking cute and I don’t get to see you two as much as I’d like.  So watching the two of you in your blog feeds my sickeningly cute quota.”
“Oh...wow...mmm, okay,” Castiel swallowed hard, his body not wanting to stop twitching especially with Dean’s hands still touching him, “That was amazing,” he hummed, licking over his bottom lip.  He battled back the nerves and slowly pushed his own hand down into the front of Dean’s pajamas.
“Thank you.  I know we should let them handle this but we need to make sure they actually talk this out and not let it fester into something worse,” Castiel said.  Samandriel nodded, keeping quiet as the both of them ate quickly.
“Just take a breath and let it out,” Anna said gripping at his hand.  He glanced up at her face and nodded, taking in a slow deep breath and held it until his lungs expanded and then let it out even slower.
“Mason is still being a brat, Aine had another migraine last night and…” Castiel listened carefully.  Willow and Keelanie, Lanie for short, were in the house but Rhiannon was not here. That made him frown, “Where’s Rhia?” Castiel asked.
“Hey-” Dean said indignantly, it was unlike his friend to throw him under the bus, even if it meant MacCready went with them. Benny gave him a warning look though, and Dean shut his mouth. He guessed he could take the hit to his ego if it meant they had a better chance at not getting shot in the face by the love of his life.
All of their pups were beautiful in their own precious ways.  Leeloo with her leadership, Mason with his fierce need to protect his siblings, Aine with her strength, Selene with her carefree spirit and his baby Jericho, who always tried to comfort.
Dean headed back over to the small huddle as soon as he pushed back the tears that were threatening to fall. It didn’t take long thankfully, and he was back to chuckling along with the group of dorks he called friends, the people he loved most in the world.
“Honestly? Lookin’ for you. But lemme tell ya, this isn’t quite what we had in mind…” Dean said, shaking his head as he glanced back over his shoulder toward the jolly green giant. “Fuck those things are huge. You guys wouldn’t happen to have a tank hidden in your bags somewhere would you?”
Dean quickly turned his attention to MacCready, rearing back without thinking and connecting his fist with the man’s sharp jaw. The hot sting of pain surged through his knuckles and forearm but he couldn’t care less.
“Then help me understand what the hell is going on with you!  Do you really want the others to think that of you? Do you want Daddy or Pops to think that of you?”
“Love you too baby.” The screen went black and Dean sighed, his arms lowering until the phone was resting on his knee. They’d be going home in a few days. He wanted to go now, fix this problem with Mason and then cuddle his entire family.
“Looks like we’ll need to double up the guards on the way home.  I have a feeling these are the same asshole we pushed out of Finch Farm all those months ago.  They saw how quickly the turrets went up and probably figured that’s what all this was,” Castiel said with a sigh.  He whistled loudly and made a circling motion with his hand. His group began picking through the bodies, scavenging any guns and bullets they could clean up and use later.
organized mess, “Don’t touch that,” he barked when Benny tried to tap at something with his finger.  The older boy looked sheepish and quickly moved away.
“Dean, do you ha-oh...wow,” Castiel gasped.  Dean was in the middle of changing, his bareback visible to him.  The next breath came out more as a grunt than anything else.
“I know how much you want this and I don’t have any more excuses to you hold you back,” she said with a little smile, “But you have to promise me that you won’t do anything reckless,” she said softly.
Leeloo swung her arms around as she crossed over the compound in the direction where she knew her brother had gone. He was being such a pain lately. Everytime their Pop had to leave he’d start acting out. It made her so frustrated when he would completely disregard anything their dad had to say.
“We’ll schedule the two of you to work together okay?  The test isn’t until next week anyway so you’ll do just fine kiddo,” she said.  Brenton perked up a little at that, hugged both of them and then ran out of the room.  Henry chuckled a bit and watched as his mom cleaned up.
“I don’t care,” Castiel hummed, rolling his hips languidly, drawing out both of their pleasures until they were shuddering.  He bent down and captured Dean’s neglected nipple and sucked slowly, grazing his teeth against the hardened nub, “What do you want?” he asked, kissing his way up Dean’s chest to his ear, “You can have whatever you want,” he whispered before nibbling against his lobe.
“Sure Bobby, anything you need, you know that,” Dean said, concern growing in his stomach. He didn’t like the nervous look to Bobby’s face or the way he seemed like it was the last place he wanted to be.
“You know I don’t mind.  I enjoy watching you work on Baby,” Castiel said and smiled towards the camera, “Nothings hotter than seeing your boyfriend bent over a beautiful car,” he said with a wink, “I’ll leave you be for now.”
or did you forget that because you want Benny so badly?” Castiel seethed and instantly regretted it.  MacCready wasn’t like that and Castiel knew it but it was too late to apologize. Would be pointless anyway.
Mary glanced up the second his feet hit the dirt and he cringed at her narrowed stare, “Just me bird,” Bobby chuckled holding up his hands.
“Alright then, you know where you’re headin.  Sam’s got some fun toys for you two to look at and by the looks of him is about to wet himself with excitement,” Bobby chuckled, “While at The Castle, show Rufus this list.  He’ll get you back on the road with what we need,” he said handing Dean a faded piece of paper.
“Like I’d be anywhere else,” he answered, stripping out of his top layers, before doing the same to a half asleep Castiel.
Kenton looked up and instantly blushed.  Pogue stood in front of him with that crooked grin of his and moved to sit next to him.  His long chestnut hair flowed freely past his shoulders and Kenton’s chest squeezed at the sight of it.  Maybe the thought of pairing up didn’t gross him out completely. Pogue was one of the several orphans the pack had adopted from the overthrown packs, Texas being the one his new friend came from.  He was only a year younger than Kenton and probably one of the sweetest people he’d ever met. And he was older than Brady which made what that kid was doing even shittier.
Dean took in a deep breath and began telling him the reason why he’d gone looking for MacCready and then to find him.  At first Castiel didn’t want to listen, the words coming out of Dean’s mouth were lies but the looks on the others’ faces made him pause, especially MacCready’s.  So he continued to listen even though with each uttered sentence, he felt like he was drowning. Especially when Dean admitted that not only was Castiel wrong about who had attacked his home, but it had been a member of Dean’s family.
Mason took a moment then shook his head, raising up watery blue-green eyes at her. She smiled softly and cupped his face, “Exactly. We all contribute, we all mean something to each other because we’re a family. We’re a pack. And if you ever need help remembering that you should look in the mirror sometimes. Only you and I share a mixture of dad and pop’s eye colors,” she grinned.  Mason blinked a few times and dove for the water, staring down at his reflection. She heard a sniffle and carefully got up to sit next to her brother along the bank.
MacCready frowned in the direction Castiel had left and shook his head, putting an arm against Benny’s chest. “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it...you go find Dean, yeah?”
“It’s not just that he doesn’t care...he thrives on the bloodshed, innocent or not. That man is a demon through and through and we will do whatever it takes to see that he doesn’t hurt anyone else,” Mary answered. There was an icy coldness to her voice but she was sure to keep her hand warm and soothing on Castiel’s back. The poor boy needed any comfort she could give, no matter how small.
Missouri rolled her eyes at him and pulled a plate that was stacked high off the counter and shoved it gently against his chest. “I set this aside for your sweetheart, I imagine he’s earning himself quite the appetite. You tell him if he needs anything this kitchen is always open, day or night for him okay?”
“You know, Mary you might be onto something about the caravans.  Ones that solely work out of Bunker Hill.  There’s the Doc Weathers, Lucas Miller, the arms dealer Cricket and of course-”
“Nice of you to notice,” he grumbled and closed his eyes.  It was a knee-jerk reaction and he regretted it immediately.  It wasn’t like he had told MacCready he was leaving...but usually he never had to.
Mary squeezed at Benny, her hands cupping the sides of his face when they parted and then turned her attention to Dean, “Oh I’ve been so worried,” she said pulling her son in tightly.
I can do that, just tell me where/how to find you and make sure to text your sister...I feel like maybe you should be more careful about inviting strangers over to your dorm.
“Mm, thank you,” Castiel said, leaning back against the couch.  Dean finished off the current one he was munching on and leaned back as well.  There was only so much patience Castiel had and he was eager to kiss his boyfriend again.
Not to mention the number of raiders that just happen to be standing by...something wasn’t adding up. Sure, there were legions of them that occasionally gathered in large groups but it still tingled in his gut and Dean felt like maybe some piece of the puzzle was missing. Honestly, it could be nothing, but if there was a traitor among them, Dean hoped it wasn’t someone in Jamaica Plains.
“Has Mason helped you around the house at all since I’ve been gone?” Dean asked.  Castiel hesitated for a second before finally shaking his head.
“Of course, sweetheart. It’s not like I’m thinkin’ about anyone else right now and believe it or not, you feel really, really good right here,” Dean said, more than a little confused how Cas could be so surprised by the desire and raw want he brought out but he knew there were some major insecurities at play, so he left it alone.
He kissed gently at Cas’ neck, trying to draw him out of his sleep slowly. Dean had sorely missed the taste of sunshine and salt on his skin along with that cocoa butter scented lotion Cas wore.
Dean sighed and moved the chair closer, “Did you know your mother was an Omega?” he asked.  Brady’s eyes widened and shook his head, “She was. Her name was Kyra and she had once belonged to a pack in Virginia before Uriel took over in those areas.  She was captured and enslaved, like all the Omegas he found. Your father was one of Uriel’s soldiers,” he said. Brady was trembling his eyes already wet with tears as his fingers gripped at the seat.
“Just uh, next time you might want to let a guy know that all you’re wantin is somethin physical,” Benny said, swallowing around the hard lump in his throat.  His name was being called behind and when he turned he could see that kid Samandriel waving at him.
Castiel reached out with his free hand and touched the side of Dean’s face, his thumb tracing the line his lips made, “I was scared but I could never hate you,” he said just above a whisper.  It was a whole mess of a situation and he was still scrambling to make sense of it all but this right here, Dean so close and their hands still linked together was everything. It felt right, like everything that had happened led him right here.
“Better work fast,” Dean said with a grin, knowing Benny would take care of him as he moved closer, gun strapped to his thigh, knife in hand. He snuck around the junked out cars, hunkering down behind some faded red thing, before jumping out behind one of the raiders and digging his knife in deep in the slit between their armor.
He shrugged…”It said online that it smelled good and shit and I remember you not liking how much money Amara was spending on your um, face stuff. This is definitely not the same thing you were talking about, it’s an um, a scrub or something so it’s kinda gritty but like I said, the reviews for it were really good…”
Kenton pushed his phone into his back pocket as he took the steps two at a time to his front door.  He could hear his mom Anna singing in the kitchen, the smile on his face broadening when he caught sight of her dancing as well.  The radio was on one of her favorite stations that played only eighties pop hits and he shook his head.
“We’re gonna probably be leaving early in the morning,” Castiel said with a lazy smile, his hand lifting to squeeze at MacCready’s shoulder.
“I’m not like the rest of you,” he said softly.  Leeloo touched at Kenton’s arm and he sighed softly, hanging his head down, “What does this mean for me?  Am I...defective somehow?”
“Tell me you want this, Cas...just say it and I’ll make you feel so good, I promise, sweetheart,” Dean said, nearly growling out the end when Castiel’s hips moved against him with enough pressure to merely tease his cock.
“Oh wow...thank you,” Castiel laughed eagerly grabbing at one of the patties and practically shoved the whole thing into his mouth.  He was still so very hungry and it wasn’t until he was on the third one that Dean gently took his wrists to stop him from shoveling in a fourth.
Castiel jumped a little and squeezed his fingers around the rings.  He was nervous but in the end, it didn’t matter whether Dean said yes or no, they’d still be together and they’d be a family.  He moved back towards the bed and sat down on the edge of Dean’s side, “Nothing, just...I want to give you something,” he said and blew out his next breath before opening his palm to reveal the two rings.
“I know this may seem a little, to much information or whatever but your momma and me?  We hadn’t been intimate that entire time. I wanted to, to be a good mate but my mental state wouldn’t allow me to.  Charlie was amazing and tried so hard to not show how sexually frustrated she was but in my moments of clarity, I saw it.  We were still connected but just, couldn’t have sex,” she explained. Kenton blinked a few times, his brain becoming a jumble of everything she was saying to him.  Maybe it wasn’t such a far fetched thing. He always just assumed that mates had regular sex and a lot, needing it to keep the bond between them complete.
“Anyone, in particular, giving you a hard time?” Samandriel asked.  Castiel chewed on his lip as he thought of how to broach this subject with his friend.  Their daughters were at the age where they should be handling their own issues together, Castiel couldn’t help being worried though.  Not of Rhiannon judging Leeloo and her thoughts. They were teenagers and were incredibly intelligent but they were still just that...kids.
Benny took in a deep breath, his entire body trembling a bit, “Y-Yeah…” he stammered, wincing and fighting the urge to cry out again when he lifted up his heavy rifle.  He was going to have to reload soon. Not wanting to take any chances he quickly did so, teeth digging into his lip as a sharp pain shot down his arm, making his fingers tingle.  They just needed to get this thing down and then they could join with Castiel and Dean to take out the rest.
“Where you off to this early twin?” Keelie asked brushing some crumbs off her chin before popping a strawberry into her own mouth.  She reached up for his coffee but Castiel took a sip first before handing it to her.
Benny dragged a hand down his face.  Dean had instantly followed the stretcher to what everyone called Castiel’s hut and they’d been in there for hours.  Their doctor or whatever, Zeke said Castiel would be fine. Just needed to sleep. Even injected him with something to keep his ass down.  Later he overheard from someone who had been in Jamaica Plains with Castiel that their boss had been getting high, to escape the pain. It made Benny’s stomach churn dangerously.  Dean was going to have his hands full when Castiel came to. Especially if that chem that Castiel got hooked on was fucking Jet. They’d all been there when that crap had been introduced to Sanctuary Hills and half the younger population got hooked on that damn Jet.  It took months to clean house but Bobby somehow managed to get everyone clean.
Once the fire raining overhead slowed, Dean slumped to the ground and unstrapped the gun on his thigh. He slid beneath the bent, misshapen metal and allowed the undercarriage to protect him while he got into position. Deep-voice trenchcoat guy was pinned to the ground by one of the beefier raiders and Dean carefully lined up his shot.
“We have a safe house in each of my areas except for Rhode Island. I thought at first they wouldn't need one, being that they are so small, but I received word that it is something they’d like. We only have enough for about half of the funding,” she said with a grimace. Next to him Sam quickly went through Michael Novak’s reports on their account and nodded to Dean.
So sorry for the lack of updates guys BUT I have the next 6-7 chapters planned out...just have to write them now lmao.
“Oh you little shit, c’mon!” Cain laughed, getting up to chase after his brother.  He tackled him to the floor but still, somehow, Dean managed to keep his phone out of his reach.
“I’d like you to pitch this idea to Dean while he’s at the summit.  Maybe if we can get a wider variety of Alphas, there will be more of a choice and a better outcome for an Omega to find a scent that helps them.  If it works, we can then test it out on young Alphas,” she said.
Castiel smiled against Dean and relaxed, his head settling on the other man’s chest as his eyes began to flutter shut, “That’ll be a very, very long time from now,” he said sleepily.
“Y-You...you okay?’ Benny managed to choke out, his eyes still squeezed shut.  The sun was searing straight into his brain.
“I wouldn’t offer to do it if I had any reservations, Cas. Look...it doesn’t have to be starting today, or anything. You just let me know when you feel comfortable with the idea and we can go from there,” he said, squeezing a gentle hand on Cas’ forearm.
“No, I wasn’t sayin’ anything like that...I just mean, Hell we’ve got some stuff back at the Sanctuary, couldn’t bring much with us, cause it’s heavy-”
“Oh man, Aine, I’m so sorry,” Mason whined, quickly shifting into his wolf form to jump on the bed.  He curled up behind her, nose wet nose burrowing into her neck. She felt herself practically melt into the bed.
“Take however long you need, sweetheart...but I can’t promise my dope of a brother won’t find...us-” he started. Before he could even finish Sam was there, smiling at him. Dean held up a hand behind Cas’ back and asked for a little more time. There was a brief hint of confusion and hurt but Sam nodded and walked back toward the gates.
“I dunno, I don’t think we should split up right now. I never thought I knew everything but there are a few pieces of information I’ve gathered over the last week or so that makes me think things aren’t adding up right, can you really not just wait here with us?” he asked, feeling a little too much longing in his voice. It wasn’t that he worried about Castiel, well not as much about that at least. But not only did everything feel
Dean checked over his notes one more time and nodded his head slowly, “We don’t have plans on building any more new safe houses in Oregon.  With the seven that we already have in place, there is no need for it,” he said. The other Conris and Banrions in the room all nodded. A hand was raised and Dean smiled, nodding his head for Amara to speak.
After lazing around practically all day, Castiel found himself outside as the sun lowered itself the last few inches to hide behind the horizon.  The clouds in the sky were getting larger, flashes of light making him flinch.
“Boss?” Muriel called out softly, making Castiel flinch hard.  He’d given his people orders, to shoot Minutemen on sight. And yet here were two of them and Castiel was hesitating.  There was just something about Dean that made him want to stop. He lowered his arm and took in a painful breath, “It’s alright Muriel...stay on guard,” he said before turning back to Dean.
“Here goes nothin’,” he said, as he took in a deep breath. He stood back to his full height, shoulders back, and faked a confidence he didn’t feel because Dean just knew, this town would eat him alive if he didn’t. The whole place seemed to throw his instincts outta whack and put him on high alert, despite the
“- I just...wow...holy...this is amazing.  Have you told mom yet?  Of course not you’re meeting up with her later...wait, does that mean I’m the first you’ve told?” Sam asked with wide eyes.
Dean swallowed, half tempted to take the drink from MacCready’s hand and down it himself. ‘My father was John Winchester…he was with the Gunners for a while, tried to bring me and my kid brother into the group but my mom left his ass for Sanctuary hills. Bobby and the rest of the Minutemen protected us.”
“Leeloo and Rhiannon?” she asked.  Castiel stared at her. It wasn’t the first time in the past ten years he wondered if all traces of the Shaman had died inside of her.  She was still intuitive as all hell but there was no silver in her eyes. Her smile was all knowing and it made him roll his eyes fondly.
Surprising both Castiel and himself, Dean managed to say what he felt. “I don’t think I could handle losing you again...once was bad enough... I just-” he swallowed hard and gave him a weak smile. “I need you.”
Charlie barked out a laugh, “Oh you have no idea.  I’m fairly new here myself but they found me sick as a dog and brought me here to see their doctor.  Now, I’m their tech girl,” she said.
Castiel smirked up at him and nodded, “Yeah, that’s all.  Thanks, RJ,” he said watching the man leave his hut. He reached out and took Dean’s hand, squeezing his fingers, “Thank you for getting him for me,” he said.
“You agreed on that sweetheart but our pups have other plans,” he chuckled, sucking a mark on Castiel’s shoulder, drawing out another groan.
“Okay,” Castiel said biting his lip.  He moved a bit to get a better view of the screen and gasped when the first image appeared.  He recognized their bathroom instantly but what caught his eye was the freaking ring in Dean’s hand.  Secondly he blushed when he realized he was in the shower.
“Hell now that you I don’t see how you’d like me any better...I just, I needed to know you were okay.”
“Your future brother in law…” Dean grinned, “Turns out one of us has a hot brother...it’s her if you were curious,” he added with a smirk.
Leeloo’s head snapped up and smiled at her goofy Uncle Garth. He was sitting up in one of the tree blinds they had around the inner perimeter, his legs dangling over the edge.
“I don’t know.  I just know I like him.  So...is there a name for that too?” he asked.  Charlie snickered, nodding her head.
“Jesus, Cas…” Dean grunted, feeling as if he could spill all over again. Instead, he groaned and pulled his lover up to him, to eagerly taste what remained of himself on  Castiel’s tongue. When he finally pulled away, panting breathlessly, he said, “You-you’re gonna be the death of me, Sweetheart.”
“Of course, I’ll send him in and grab some food for both of us while you two talk,” Dean said, kissing softly at Cas’ lips because that was something he could do apparently, and while he was allowed, he’d take full advantage of it.
Benny frowned, “How many times do you guys get attacked?” he asked, slowly reaching down to yank on his pants.  Maybe he had overdone it a little but hell, he had a hot guy squirming in his lap, like he was gonna stop cause his side hurt?  Nah.
Castiel felt a tear leak down his cheek and he jerked back from Amara’s hold to wipe at it furiously, “They called me pathetic Mari,” Castiel whispered, keeping his face down as his hands clenched into fists, “The Winchester brother’s
“Fucking hell, boss...why can’t you just leave shit alone,” MacCready said, though there wasn’t any heat in the words. He should have known better than to try to hide something from Castiel. The man was practically psychic when it came to reading what was on his mind at least. “I don’t need this, hell he doesn’t need it either. He’s still young, plenty of time for him to find someone to settle down with, to give him the kind of life he wants.”
“Ow fuck,” Dean hissed, a small trail of blood leaking from his temple. When he straightened up though, he could see it was Castiel who’d thrown the damn thing. He nearly went off on the guy, until he belatedly realized how fucked they truly were.
“Let’s get this fucker,” he panted, lifting up his rifle and firing right into the things face.  He barely missed the smile he got as an answer, his eyes completely focused on the Behemoth’s arm firing back.  Before he could rethink, he was shoving MacCready out of the way again, getting the full brunt of the boulder against his chest.  He didn’t even have enough air in his lungs to shout, just went down like a heavy sack of laundry.
“It’s dangerous and you gotta be on your toes the entire time.  There are settlers out there, who you can try to recruit if they’re willing, others you’ll find could be provisioners.  That’s why you need backup and stick to the roads the best you can.”
He’d been looking for Cas for a while when he found him, MacCready with hand on his hip and the other gently stroking Cas’ chin. He trusted his husband, really he did but the touch was so
“I-I didn’t know….how-how could he have done that to her?” Brady whined.  Dean swallowed hard and rubbed at Brady’s shoulder.
Dean pulled her into a hug and held tightly as he fought off the emotions that would lead to tears. He would miss her, Sammy too, but he needed to see what was out there, beyond the border patrols they’d set up. He had an itch under his skin that had been botherin’ him since he was a little kid. “I know, mom. I’m proud of you too, wasn’t easy doin’ what you did, nor raisin’ us all on your own the last few years. Thank you, for...for everything.”
Castiel was just walking back through the gates when he saw Dean storm out of one of the alcoves.  He looked angry which puzzled him.  The last time he saw his husband he was laughing and joking around with one of the Minutemen.
“Which means he needs to go home, you coming?” Muriel asked looking at MacCready with a raised brow.
“Yeah, thankfully the only thing that happened was a few bloatflies here and there.  I’m glad we didn’t have to have a full on shoot out in front of the kid,” Benny said with a grunt.  He pushed his now empty plate away and couldn’t help snickering at the pout on Castiel’s face.
“I-We have all the faith in you Lu,” Kenton whispered.  Leeloo stared up at him and her smile returned. She gave him a nod and got up from the table.
Benny’s eyes never left the monstrous green things roaming around, especially the huge one that stumbled around almost dumbly.  Benny wasn’t an idiot though, even if it seemed dumb it could kill them all with one swipe of the fire hydrant it was carrying around like a club.  He grabbed the back of Dean’s shirt and slowly lowered them into a crouch, scurrying across the dirt to get their new...hopefully friends.
Bobby swallowed hard, nodding a bit as he turned on his heel.  If his hand touched at his privates protectively just imagining that scenario, only he knew about it.
“When we found you, we had no idea where you came from or where your birth mother fled to.  It angers me that we may never know but only because you will never know where you came from.  Someone in your bloodline may have had the same issue you had shifting for the first time,” she explained and Kenton swallowed hard.  He’d been thinking about that too a lot lately. What if someone was like him out there? Where they couldn’t shift at the correct age or now, have any kind of physical connection with anyone.  It was aggravating.
“Wait...Dean-” he was interrupted by the next image.  Something similar but this time he was in the background talking about something while Dean stood right in front of him, the ring at his chest with that signature sneaky smile.  How the hell had he not noticed that his boyfriend had a ring and two that he was taking a picture?
I know we don’t know each other very well but… when you feel comfortable; I’d like to take you to breakfast or dinner. Anywhere in the city, your choice.
“Well you’re a smart guy, bound to happen from time to time...anything you feel like sharing?” Dean asked, curious about what exactly was going on in Cas’ head.
Castiel followed them with narrowed eyes, “If you’re asking The Minutemen for aid, be careful.  They’ll leave you high and dry,” he barked out.
“It was her wish that we take you away and execute your father.  She didn’t want you around his influence. Kyra died in Castiel’s arms after we promised her that you would be taken care of.”
Dean rushed through the rest of his patrol, not in a way that would put anyone in danger but he just moved a little faster than he normally would between the stops. He was eager to finish out his shift and head over to where Benny was staying.
“I was rinsing it out when I heard you two down here. She’s asking for some of that beef stew you always make when Pop’s not feeling well?” she asked moving to lean up against the counter.  Jericho moved over to her, his little arms wrapping around his sister’s waist. Leeloo smiled and nuzzled at him, keeping him close.
“If it’s something you want to do, Cas...we’ll figure it out when we get there. If not though, I’d-well I’d understand,” Dean said, softly kissing at the top of Cas’ head. He couldn’t imagine how hard it must be on Castiel to deal with everything they’d found out over the last few days. Hell, he was having a pretty hard time getting it through his own head, he knew it had to be a hundred times harder for Cas.
Now though, all business talk was packed away and light chatter filled Dean’s ears. It always managed to make his heart sing when he saw all the packs getting along. He was just about to join Cain when there was a hand on his shoulder. Benny grinned at him, holding out his cell phone.
Castiel sighed heavily, “Thanks...she was a little intense,” Castiel muttered, moving to sink down on the steps, “I gotta make the call soon,” he said, wincing at how tired his voice really sounded.  Just a bit more and he’d be in his hut at Nordhagen.
“What do you mean?  Connect as in...physically or sexually?” she asked and Kenton knew he was blushing.
He glanced back over his shoulder but shook his head, and turned back around. Charlie had to be around here somewhere, she would calm him down...he would calm down first.
Castiel blinked a few more times and finally just rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, “It’s not your fault Dean.  And they shouldn’t presume to know you or your brothers,” Castiel said, moving a bit so he could rest his head on Dean’s shoulder.
Somehow none of that seemed to match a fraction of the intensity he found himself feeling as Cas held his trembling hand out in front of him. Without knowing, Dean still knew that there was something special about the moment, about the rings, and the intent of them.
Charlie chuckled, “Nah, nothing that interesting.  I did find some documentation about the Glowing Sea though,” Charlie said with a shrug.  When Dean stared at her she continued, “It’s on the very outer edge of Boston, southwest of The Castle.  There’s no record of how large the area is exactly but it’s where our Rad Storms originate from.  The entire place is like, well, a
There wasn’t a crowd gathered at the entrance, for which both Dean and Castiel were grateful. He didn’t want a big fuss made, though he was eager to see his family. They’d almost made it to their shared hut when a familiar voice called out for them.
“Not tonight, Cas…” Dean said softly, not wanting him to feel any kind of rejection. “Let’s get some sleep. There’s tea and a snack on the nightstand if you want it.”
Benny frowned and straightened up, “Yeah,” he said with a shrug.  When Dean only stared at him Benny’s eyes widened, “Shit, I mean, it was always kinda obvious to me.  MacCready never flat out said anything to me I just...knew,” he said.
They snuggled on the window seat for a bit longer until they returned back into the heart of the kitchen, Kenton munching on his newly warmed up crescent rolls.  Charlie had a cup of tea in her hands while Anna worked on making a simple supper of stew and some rolls.
“I know we’ve only been dating a few weeks but...I was wondering if, you know, if we could be exclusive?” Castiel stammered, going red in the face.  If he was being more realistic, he’d know that this wasn’t such a big deal. People don’t go all out like this if they weren’t looking to become more serious but still, deep down in Castiel’s chest rested a huge knot of disbelief and doubt.
,” he said.  Hael rolled her eyes as she moved through their house to get to their bedroom in the back.  It was small but it was enough for just them and their almost nine-year-old daughter Quinn.
MacCready let out a bitter laugh. “So it’s yes on the death wish then. Cause I’ll tell you right now that if Castiel Novak ever sets eyes on either of you again, you’ll be damn lucky to walk away from it.” He shook his head, “And somehow I get the feeling this information isn’t going to smooth things over.”
Charlie eyed him a bit but let it go, “Well here it says that there was one patrol sent out but when they came back it was with the status that the settlement had been abandoned,” Charlie frowned.  She looked before and after it and her stomach dropped. Without a word, she scrambled up towards their map on the wall, “Ooooh shit. This isn’t good,” she muttered.
He found Dean where Mary had said, walking around the high wood and metal walls, testing for any weak patches.  It was something the older Winchester boy did nearly every day, “Hey kiddo,” Bobby called out, arms crossing over his chest.
Castiel sighed into the hug and was almost sad when it ended much too quickly for him.  He and Benny weren’t best friends but he was now MacCready’s boyfriend and that practically made him family to Castiel.
“There were dozens of raiders out there...waiting. I dunno man, but it felt weird. Cas said it was normal though, so I guess...more of the same for you. Got hairy for a bit but I think everyone made it out okay, you’d have to talk to some of your people to be sure though.” Dean shook his head, he didn’t know if it was par for the course for them or if Castiel just didn’t want him worrying, or knowing anything, either way…
MacCready looked back at Benny with a clear disappointment on his face. “I can’t believe he’s the best you could find...”
“So it’s not dad you’re angry with. It’s me,” she stated. Mason’s mouth dropped open but no sound came out, just his face turning a horrible shade of red. Leeloo gave him a challenging look to which he flinched from.
“Castiel told me of his years in a normal school and how if it hadn’t been for Link and Lyra or even that rogue werewolf for a teacher, he would have felt alone and something even worse would have happened when that bastard Crowley was around.  We still have rogues here, ones that are loyal to Dean sure but still don’t want to join a pack. Where I respect that, I don’t want their children to feel alone. I actually do have one in my class too,” she said.
Benny took in a deep breath and opened the door.  There was another ghoul standing in front of the stairs that led down but this one was wearing an honest to god suit.  The man welcomed them to the place and announced that someone named Magnolia was just getting started. Benny glanced over his shoulder at Dean before slowly taking the steps.  There were a few people sitting around at the tables, a woman on a small platform singing in a bright red shiny dress. It was so out of place but pretty awesome regardless.
“Well I’m all ears, can’t say I’ve ever had any experience with them, but I’m not one for burying my head in the sand when it comes to stuff like this,” Dean said, which closed Benny’s mouth on the subject as well. He knew it would. It was one thing not to believe the scary stories around the campfire as a kid, another thing to see that there were things not adding up and ruling out a potential threat to themselves and to their home.
“Goddamnit Dean keep it in your-fuck,” MacCready’s teasing died in his throat. Castiel was pale and sickly looking, it didn’t take long to realize just how affected he’d been by the news.
Mary touched the side of his face and sighed, “I know sweetheart, I know.  I can’t help being scared, you’ll always be my baby. I’m so proud of you Dean, I hope you know that.”
It had been over a week, every day Dean did something to document the ring and Cas’ oblivious nature. It was starting to become harder to hide his excitement and he was pretty sure he’d get caught soon. It didn’t help that they were going to a fancy dinner party to celebrate Cas’ big promotion. Dean wanted nothing more than to make the man as happy as humanly possible but he also couldn’t bare to steal the spotlight after Cas had worked so damn hard to get everyone on board with the most recent designs.
“Cas...I love you, I do but I just need-I’m gonna go hang with Charlie for a bit, we’ll talk about this later.” Dean pressed a kiss to his husband’s forehead and backed away slowly, feeling a heavy kick to his own chest at the separation. Still, there would be no winners if they kept talking, and he kept letting it eat him up from the inside out.
He couldn’t help himself, Dean pulled Cas closer, lifting his chin again until their eyes met. “Hey, I told you, I’m good...and that was, well...honestly? That was one of the hottest fucking things I’ve ever seen in my life.”
“Benny won’t let me do that in public any-..” MacCready teased, but his mouth was covered before he could further the point, however untrue. He probably should have been paying attention though because it wasn’t the embarrassment that had his boyfriend shutting him up, but the fact that Andy was steadily running toward them.
Castiel swallowed hard, looking down at his hands.  He still wasn’t sure where his head was at when it came to the Minutemen.  He heard and understood everything that Dean had told him but he had spent years,
“Nah, he had that comin’, but I guess...so did I...still-,” Dean paused. He glared over his shoulder and growled, “Leave...I need to talk to
“I need your help out by the garage, ASAP! Don’t say anything to Cas...or anyone, Actually just don’t say anything at all,” he said, and then immediately hung up. He knew Sam would do what was asked of him, and that’s all that mattered.
“Ma, this is MacCready,” Benny quickly interrupted, not knowing exactly what could come out of that mouth.  The tension was already too thick and Mary was feeling threatened. Not a good mix.
Benny kept his comments to himself as they hurried down the path.  They were out maybe an hour when they heard the clings and mooing of a caravan nearby.  Benny perked up, maybe it was one of Cas’s and they could use their long-range walkies to try and reach Finch Farm.  As they got closer he gripped at MacCready’s arm, “Shit, isn’t that Doc Weathers?” Benny asked.  The man was sitting at a campfire while one of his caravan guards circled around them as the other cooked up whatever they had hunted.
A light bulb switched on in Kenton’s head and he gasped.  He’d heard that word muttered before and it was as if a puzzle piece shifted into place.  The wolf stopped pacing and settled, allowing for Kenton to breathe easier.
Mary came over with the food packs, only having to argue with the cooks for a few things.  The head cook had merely rolled her eyes and complied with her request. Mary knew she was being ridiculous but she did not want her boys have to result to hunting in those woods, not with those monstrous Yao Guias out there.
“Whoa there,” Benny said, righting the kid back on his feet, “Careful, still need your help over here,” he chuckled, shaking his head as he kept their hands together to help him over to the rows that they needed to be at.  The hairs on the back of his neck were suddenly standing on end and he raised his head up to find MacCready practically glaring over at them. He frowned, sighing heavily before turning his attention back to Samandriel.
Swallowing hard, MacCready pulled Castiel in against his side. “We’ll get through this, we always do...and who knows, maybe that idiot will come to his senses sooner rather than later, huh?”
He huffed out a sigh, he hated this but someone really needed to watch out for Cas and neither of them had spent enough time with one another lately for that to be him. “Look I can give you tonight but if Dean doesn’t know by morning, I’ll tell him myself Castiel. I suggest you get it over with. You’ve got enough stress on your plate with all the meetings and politics that are coming, tell him here where he can freak out if he has to, and you don’t have a whole town watching.”
Castiel waited until he was just outside his dorm to pull his phone out.  He read over his sister’s messages several times before sighing heavily. She was right but he was a coward.
Keelie sat at her station, eyes glued to her laptop as she typed something.  Her books, along with their father’s were everywhere. There must be something new she was working on.  Without a word she looked up and smiled at him, graciously taking the other teacup in Castiel’s hand. She took a sip and hummed, setting it down on the table next to her.
At first, Dean had been terrified to make the same promise to them as he had to Becky’s pack.  He’d failed them miserably but the leader, Ambriel was eager for it regardless. She’d been shy, twitchy, and scared, but after she met with the rest of the pack leaders, her confidence soared.  Though Becky still lived with them in Tillamook, she was now his go-between with the foxes.
Benny pushed at Dean’s face and laughed, “Sounds good Dean.  C’mon, you can help me with the water generators, they’re making all kinds of noises that don’t sound good,” he said with a yawn.  He’d get some sleep after supper but for now there was work to be done around the settlement.
“As long as you need me to,” he said, surprising both himself and Cas it seemed. “I mean I’d have to get word back to Uncle Bobby so he doesn’t freak out but I can’t think of anywhere I’d rather be than wherever it is you want me.”
“I don’t want you to hurt Caleb,” Rhiannon said softly.  Leeloo took in a deep breath and leaned back, those damn eyes were so bright with tears and worry she couldn’t help leaning in to kiss at her forehead.
“Yeah, yeah I know…” MacCready answered, squeezing at Castiel’s hand before turning back to his food.
“Hey I-ahhh, I’m not saying no here Cas,” Dean said, reaching down to gently stop him.  “But I need you to know this isn’t...you don’t owe me anything, you don’t need to repay any debt, you know that right?” he asked, not being able to stand the idea that Cas might feel some sort of obligation toward him.
Castiel beamed up at Dean, “You remembered...Dean, you’re the best,” he said.  Castiel gently pushed Dean down into a chair and grinned, “You’re getting one too mister,” he said, playfully challenging the man.
“No, it’s a terrible idea...but we’re doing it anyway, well I am...feel free to turn around if you want,” he said, though Dean knew Benny wouldn't dare. It wasn’t just that it would go against the loyal nature of his best friend, but also..they weren’t too far away from MacCready and as much as Dean really did want to punch the son of a bitch, Benny still cared about him.
“Thank you for coming back for me,” Castiel whispered, the trembling in his body stopped and now he shuddered at all the glorious warmth Dean was providing him.  He never wanted the man to move away from him, ever.
“Home sweet home,” Benny said, turning to look at the others, “Welcome to Sanctuary Hills boys.” Someone on watch must have seen them, the gates were being pulled open and there was some shouting.  Benny quickly turned again to see how Castiel was doing. From the paleness in his face, Benny was guessing the poor guy was about two seconds from bolting.
He cleared his throat a little as Benny lifted an eyebrow. “There’s not much we know about him but there’s one other thing...I’ve never met the guy but apparently, he’s my-” Dean paused, his throat felt tight and sore but he growled the words out no matter how hard it was.
“I think you two do just fine on your own, just wonderin if these assholes are targeting you specifically you know?” Benny asked with a shrug.  Dean was okay but Benny still needed to see it with his own eyes.
Dean rolled his shoulders a bit, they’d worked their asses off for the last couple weeks but just as he’d promised, The Castle was better than ever. He was certainly lookin’ forward to spending some time resting with his gorgeous husband. Cas had tried to take it easy, Dean knew he was trying, but the man was just as stubborn and pigheaded as Dean was himself so it meant they butted heads a lot about what ‘
“Think I busted out a rib,” Benny grunted, relief surging through him for not only seeing Dean but the other two as well.  MacCready seemed to have accepted their secret, he hoped mostly for Dean’s sake that Castiel would as well, “You think that place...Jamaica Plains will have a clinic?” he asked.
“No...no I’ll...I’ll be fine,” Castiel said, trying to draw in a breath but it only made his lungs burn.  He couldn’t focus on anything right now, let alone his best friend who was slowly coming closer.  There was movement out of the corner of his eye from his other side and he jerked his rifle up, shooting at it before it moved again.  He swallowed hard as it dropped, revealing itself to be a wandering bloatfly.  The kickback of the rifle settled him a bit, his eyes closing as his head tilted back a bit.
Dean flinched at the harshness of the boy’s tone, how angry it was.  Dean grabbed at the computer chair and sunk down in it, “We need to talk.”
Benny came rushing out with their packs and their rifles, not even pausing a second to hand them over.  He followed MacCready when he began to run, the panic pouring off of him in waves, “What the hell happened?” he asked, keeping pace with his boyfriend.
Castiel nodded, “Of course,” he said and slowly got up, then took Dean’s hand to lead him towards the door.
and The Minutemen, so it’s probably best to let you think they fell from the sky as far as I’m concerned.” MacCready said, as he turned away. Benny’s
Castiel came undone a split second after Dean, the feeling of the man below him shuddering and gripping at him being all too much for him to hold off any longer.  He whimpered long and low, hips rutting against Dean as he tried to slow. The sounds of the storm slowly came filtering back into the hut, barely heard over their ragged breathing and heartbeats.  He kissed at Dean’s swollen lips lazily, his fingers no longer gripping Dean’s hair but scratching at his scalp.
Still, he and Benny hadn’t run into much trouble except for the occasional small group of bloat flies, and he was grateful for it. As exciting as it was to be out on a mission, Dean had no desire whatsoever for his best friend to have to pull him back to camp in a tarp.
“Sorry Char, I just-I can’t- it’s not working, looks like this is all I got in me tonight. But don’t put that away just yet, I know Cas will want a look at it too.”
“D-Dean?” Castiel stammered.  His eyelids felt like lead though the rest of him felt pretty good, almost numb.  He’d woken up scared for a moment, not knowing where he was until he heard the sounds of the sea outside.  Then he’d almost cried with relief. He was home. His vision was a bit blurry but he could see the shape of Dean clearly next to him, his soft snores reaching Castiel’s ears.  Almost just as soothing as the crashing waves outside. He didn’t know what was more surprising, finding Dean sitting beside him or that their hands were clasped together. The hateful side of him wanted to pull away but he didn’t.  The contact was nice, a more hungry side of him that he hadn’t felt in a while crept up, craving more.
Castiel was sprawled out on the bed, breathing heavily by the time Dean was done ”showering” him with affection, his body tingling from his toes to the tip of his head.  He grunted out in protest when Dean started pulling some flannel pants up his legs.
Benny threw his head back and laughed, the sound echoing off the walls, “Oh I bet you would, downright sexy too,” he smirked.
“I hate you both,” Castiel grumbled, finally walking away to head over to Samandriel’s house.  His sister’s and Pamela’s laugh following him.
Castiel watched as the kid’s eyes got bigger but still didn’t say anything, just looked up at his dad for reassurance.  It was the cutest damn thing Castiel had ever seen...well, right after watching Dean play with the children at Jamaica Plains.
“You’re welcome. You deserve this you know, this and so much more,” Dean promised, squeezing  his arms a little to tighten his hold. “You’re amazing, Cas. You don’t even realize how wonderful you are either and I haven’t decided if that makes it better or worse,” he added with a chuckle. “You’re either too humble or too oblivious to see how much better you could have it. I’m lucky either way.”
Bobby snorted, “Yeah, Carla’s been banned from Sanctuary Hills recently, caught her snoopin around Sam’s workshop and I thought it about time she find somewhere else to be.  Cricket, well, she was banned right after our chem outbreak,” Bobby said with a sigh, “We barely caught in time but she was giving all the youngins chems, getting them hooked enough that they began to steal ammo and weapons to buy from her.  Chased her ass outta here pretty damn quick when we finally caught on.  She mostly carries anything that can be called a weapon.  She’d definitely have no problem trading with the damn Gunners.”
