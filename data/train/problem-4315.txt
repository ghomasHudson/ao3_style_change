Dean’s eyebrows practically flew off his forehead. “Like, let him drive Baby?” He shook his head. “I’d do just about anything for the guy, but there are
Miracle ran back to Dean with the stick in his mouth, and dropped it at his feet. Dean picked it up and threw it with his left hand.
Cas was still beaming when he answered, “Oh Dean… ever since I knew that I loved you, I’d hoped… but I didn’t really think…”
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean says, out of breath and edgy. He kneels next to Castiel, trying to asses the angel’s condition. “Let’s never do that again.”
Dean had heard Cas moan in pleasure before, heard his breathy gasps. There were previous times when he had seen his head tip back, his eyes go wide and then flutter shut, seen him squirm and shudder under the hands and lips of another. But this was different. There was something about knowing that
"One day these books will be known as the Winchester Gospel," Castiel announced proudly, because after all, it was his mate it would be written about, whether Dean disapproved of some parts or not. Unfortunately, this seemed to alarm the rest of the room.
Dean never felt great about stealing, besides the fact he had been doing it his whole life, it just never sat right with him. He stole out of necessity, out of the need to eat and drive and live. This situation was no different, and he felt only a pang of remorse as he broke into the small convenience store and swallowed bottles of water and granola bars in quick succession.
Yes, Michael. I understand. I will do as you say, brother,” Castiel said, and his grace quivered with excitement.
"You think I'm gonna tell you?" the archdemon tried to laugh, but it was choked off before he could.
Castiel was startled when the prophecy began to fall into place exactly as was predicted. The two brothers, of which the angels only knew the last name Winchester, were already being prepped to be vessels for the apocalypse. Michael was pleased, he wanted his brother dead once and for all. Many angels felt the passing shame that this war would likely destroy their Father’s whole creation. Castiel was one of them, he looked at the wonders the humans had created and felt sorry for them, so much tireless work and evolution would be gone in a day, maybe even hours. His Father had been silent and absent for hundreds of years now. They had no choice but to follow the prophecies. He fully expected the Winchesters were like every other vessel, chosen for religiousness and bloodline.
"Who are we to question the will of God?" Castiel burst out, frustration and conflicting emotions making him snap.
“So I simply can't compete with Castiel, is that it, Dean?” Sam whimpered, and Dean narrowed his eyes at his brother.
This has been abandoned for quite some time and I honestly don't know if i will still have readers. I'll spare you the gory details of my life, but I can promise I WILL be working on this fic again, hopefully a chapter a week, but that's up in the air. Thanks for the ultimate waiting challenge, guys!
“What do you mean? I don’t understand. Dean is not an angelic name; how could I possibly be grace mates with someone named Dean if Father has not created them?” Castiel put on a burst of speed and drew even with his older brother.
He had been working on Dean’s body for seven earthly days, and it was now Thursday once more. Fitting, Castiel thought to himself. He scooped the bright, wonderful soul out of the center of his grace that had been protecting it, and placed it back in his body, back into the coffin and grave he had found it in. He wished to stay and observe Dean awakening, but his superiors were already calling him back, ordering him home. Castiel let out an annoyed burst of power as he took off, flattening the area around his mate’s grave, and he flew towards heaven, appearing before Michael with what remained of his garrison.
It’s partly to silence his own thoughts, and partly to explain his shell-shocked reaction that Dean says, “I didn’t even think that angels could feel stuff like that.”
Every so often, Cas would nod, or say, “hm” as he squinted at the screen with intense concentration.
“Nope!” Dean answers happily. “Come on, Cas, our chores are done.” He reaches to grab Cas’ tie, hesitates, and changes course to take Cas by the elbow and pull him up from his chair.
And yes, Dean knows to trust Castiel’s judgement by now; has to, otherwise he wouldn’t have survived this long. But he’s tired, and he was going to spend the night under a roof, and maybe he’s annoyed.
Cas seemed perfectly happy to just be kissing, and Dean felt the weight of exhaustion behind his eyes. But Dean had also just proven to himself how weak he really was; and he was afraid that he’d wake up in the morning, call Cas “buddy” and continue on like tonight had never happened. He was more afraid that the dark, ugly buzzing at the back of his head would never shut up unless he did something drastic, unless he drowned it out with something louder.
what this was about. It wasn’t about him and Cas, it was about her. So he pictured her lips around his cock instead of Cas’, her hair spilling over his hips. It was a nice image, but not as satisfying as Dean thought it would be.
“No, don’t apologize. It’s good.” Dean said, with an edge to his voice. “It’s great that you don’t understand racist bullshit. It’s great that you don’t have all the bullshit floating around in your head that normal humans do. It’s great that you don’t understand all the bullshit rules people live by. It’s fantastic.”
He sighs and frowns, but tells her, “Well, I don’t think Balthazar will try to challenge Jack again.”
Running his fingers up and down Eileen’s arm, Sam says, blushing, “I could get it for you. Like an anniversary present. Happy three weeks of not being dead.”
“So we’ve got whipped butter, syrup, and strawberry jam,” he says, setting each one down in turn. “Take your pick.”
Dean turned his gaze to the mirrored wall. He saw his own eyes, glassy and heavy-lidded, his lips pink and hanging open wantonly, his face flushed, sweat trickling down from his hairline. His hair was spiked from sweat and Cas’ fingers running through it. His shoulders jerked forward with every thrust Cas made. Dean looked blissful, he looked fucked out, he looked…
Sam shrugged and shifted on his feet. “You always get a single together. You’re having sex on a regular basis.”
Cas watches Sam leave with wide, nervous eyes, and Dean watches Cas, trying to decide what to make of those nerves.
Dean returns from the kitchen and starts passing out beers. Cas is about to share his verdict on dessert, but before he can, Claire is speaking.
Cas thinks, all things considered, it’s not the worst way that conversation with Claire could have gone. Still, he knows Claire is a complex person, who often uses humour as a shield. So he takes out his phone, types,
On the lawn, a child trips and falls, and starts to cry as the rest of the kids play on without him.
“Oh.” Castiel considers this. “In that case, I think the movie presents an interesting metaphysical scenario, akin more to some conceptions of reincarnation than a proper curse. It also poses the question of what it would take for an individual to truly change their lives for the better. The film suggests that it’s necessary to kill the self, symbolically, or in the weatherman’s case, literally, before he can genuinely begin the process of self-improvement. And that the only actions that can be considered purely good are those that are not only unrewarded, but don’t even contain the promise of any consequences at all, positive or negative. Philosophically it’s not an invalid perspective, but personally…” Cas can’t help but reflect on his own experiences with change, and with consequences. “Personally I think it’s a bit pessimistic. What do you think?”
Instead of doing as Cas asks, Dean reaches for his phone on the nightstand to check the time. Cas grumbles at the disturbance and stays wrapped around Dean as best he can, pressing his forehead between Dean’s shoulder blades.
Sam dropped the head and strode over to Cas, offering a hand to help him up. “You okay?” he asked, with a reassuring pat on the shoulder.
from Kaia sounds over the phone like a gunshot, and Cas feels like it hits him in the gut. He shrinks back against the wall in the hallway, but he can’t bring himself to stop listening.
“I pledge myself to you, Dean Winchester,” Cas says, voice heavy with celestial intent. “As long as you want me.”
“I know Dean’s acting like… well, Dean, right now. But just so you know, I can tell that you’ll be good for each other.”
Dean takes a moment absorb the information, then sighs. “Great. That’s just… great.” He shakes his head. “Well, here’s something to cheer you up: the welcoming committee finally caught up to us.” He nods towards the monsters beyond the trees.
Their teeth clack as Dean shoves himself off of Cas. Cas catches a glimpse of him, red-faced and wide-eyed, before he ducks his head and turns away.
When Cas’ breathing got more erratic, the crease between his brows deepened, and he grit his teeth, Dean slowed his pace. Beverly whined, but it was clear that she understood what Dean wanted when she started bobbing her head in longer strokes, and moaning enthusiastically around Cas’ cock.
It gradually fades, and Claire takes another draw on the cigarette. She breathes the smoke out slowly, eyes following the loops and swirls. When the last of the smoke drifts away she looks down, studying the embers of tobacco burning between her fingers.
Anna regards him with a tilt of her head. “You know, I didn’t appreciate the way you talked about me when I was human.”
“Look around,” Naomi insists. “Your Heaven is a new tower of Babel: haphazard, half-built, and divided. The survivors are demoralized. The grafts are hopeless. The archangels don’t seem to care what happens. And your old garrison…” She scoffs. “Well, you have a few loyalists,” she admits, with a glance towards Anna. “But most of them either hate you, or fear you, or both.”
? Dean didn’t even know where that thought came from or what it meant, and he quickly shoved it to the back of his mind.
Castiel considers flying them out of there. But he doesn’t know how long this stretch of forest goes on for, and if its magic is still effecting him when he lands, then he really will be too tired to go on.
Cas leads Anael through a series of heavens. A massage parlour with glossy-skinned attendants, the couture section of a Saks Fifth Avenue, a restaurant with gold-leafed wagyu on the menu. They end up on a broad, brick-paved avenue, lined with pastel-coloured shops and leading to a half-scale castle.
He pushes Cas back with a gentle hand on his chest, and slides out from between him and the counter. Their eyes stay locked as Dean trails his fingers down Cas’ sleeve to take his hand.
“To be fair, I don’t think angels are supposed to,” Cas finally says, voice rougher than it had been, and somehow distant. “Even as a human, I’ve never had a soul.”
Dean rolls his eyes, in a defeated kind of exasperation. “Ugh, you’re gonna make this weird, aren’t you?”
Before Cas can remind himself that this is Naomi, that she has no right to criticize him, he’s already casting his eyes down in shame.
Cas wants to say that it’s not the same. That Cas loves Dean in the way that Dean cut off pieces of Castiel, fashioned them into a heart, and put it back in a place that had no room for one. And his love hurts, and bleeds, but it beats, and it makes him feel alive like nothing else. And Dean can’t possibly love him the same way, Cas wouldn’t want him to. It’s too painful.
He leans in, tasting Cas' lips, the tip of his tongue darting and caressing. Cas raises his hand to the back of Dean’s neck just as Dean pulls away.
“Well I do, okay?” Dean insists defensively. He gets to his feet and takes a careful step towards the angel. “Now, I can’t know what you’re going through. But I figure I’ve come close. If you need something like… I guess I get it.” Another tentative step. “But don’t ask me to treat you that way. I’m not that guy."
With the look of a soldier going into battle, Cas turned back to the pool table. He gave the cue a practice stroke, and then took his shot. With a crack and a clatter the balls scattered across the table.
Dean groaned and buried his face in his arms. He felt Cas’ hand, gliding gently up his back to caress his hair.
“It wasn’t until Donna got back from her date,” Jody says, struggling to keep a straight face, “that I noticed--she still had a werewolf claw stuck in her hair!”
Cas frowns in frustration. “That’s like saying that when humans are alive, they’re prisoners of the forces that shape the earth. Of the wind and the tide and tectonic plates.”
Cas tries not to let himself get distracted by the news about Gabriel as he returns to the other angels. He heads towards Anna first.
Dean felt the bottom drop out of his stomach as the last bit of hope he had that he and Cas could breeze past this collapsed.
Dean takes Castiel’s coat and spreads it on the ground, and rolls up his own as a place to rest their heads. He pulls the angel down to lay with him the firelight.
“... get that you need someone to talk to about this crap," Claire is saying, sounding much calmer. "But did you think that maybe that someone should be your boyfriend?”
Cas’ eyes are a fraction too wide to call his expression blank. Dean connects the look in his eyes with something he felt last night--fear, and shame. There’s no evidence of that roiling, alien desire. Dean just sees his friend, his friend who’s clearly sliding into a pit of self-loathing. He hates it.
There’s a crease of discomfort between Dean’s brows. He opens his mouth as if about to speak, and then closes it again.
Dean was woken up the next morning by the sound of relentless knocking. He pressed his forehead to the back of Cas’ shoulder and groaned, and heard Cas grumble too.
Cas nods thoughtfully, and considers how to best explain. As he thinks, he hears Dean’s voice, both far away and very close. He’s praying.
Still fuming, Cas turns to look at the men closely for the first time. He blinks when he notices that none of them are carrying weapons; they’ve been left in the trenches or dropped along the way. He moves closer to the advancing lines, anger forgotten to curiosity. He realizes that the soldiers aren’t charging towards each other in battle. They’re walking towards each other, faces wrought with emotion.
Dean lies on the floor of the den, catching his breath, trying to arrange what he’s just experienced in some kind of way that makes sense. Finally, he gives up and goes to his room. He sits on the floor, knowing that’s where he’ll end up anyways, and takes long gulps of whiskey straight from the bottle.
Sam smiles as if he knows what Cas is thinking. “He just gets like this sometimes. You know how Dean is when he’s really enthusiastic about something.”
Okay, I was optimistic about finishing one chapter a week. These are long bois. Every two weeks it is.
Dean takes him by the arm, and helps ease Cas to the ground. “Dude, there’s a reason why you don’t fly me around here,” he says, more worried than upset.
Dean occupied himself with untying Beverly’s halter top, dotting her shoulders with kisses and gentle bites. She unbuttoned Cas’ shirt and pushed it off his arms. Her top fell away, and Dean slid his hands around to squeeze her breasts and brush experimentally against her nipples. She moaned into Cas’ mouth in reply.
Cas is still watching the machine gunner. He’s barely visible now, his face buried in the shoulder of a man whose guts he spilled across the battlefield. Many others gather around, placing hands on his arms, his shoulders, his head. In understanding, camaraderie, forgiveness. The benediction of saints.
"Well, the sweater was Dean’s idea," Cas concedes. With a wave of his hand he sends the garment back to Dean’s closet.
Dean watches the movement, swallowing down a mouthful of egg. He filters through what he knows about Cas, his freshly acquired insight: what he knows the angel wants, what he can offer him to stay. Acceptance, companionship, camaraderie. He doesn’t show his hand yet. He waits for the other shoe to drop.
With a dull clatter, Anna drops the frisbee onto the boardroom table, and gets to her feet. Cas follows her.
“I was wondering…” Cas’ gaze drifted from the table top, to the bookshelf, to Kevin, to the ceiling, and back to Kevin again. He looked everywhere, except at Dean. “Wondering how you know… how… football works?”
When Castiel pulled off, he looked absolutely wrecked. His black hair was even more messed up than usual from Dean's rough handling, his chapped lips were swollen and red, his blue eyes crinkling around the corners as he gave Dean one of his rare smiles, and he had saliva and precum smeared all over his face. Dean thought he was
"Who said anything about asking?" Uriel snapped, and abruptly, the room was empty except for Sam, who turned in a circle and slammed his fist into the wall.
“Don’t worry about me, Cas,” he said, not turning, not wanting to see his friend’s face. “I’m fine.”
“Oh, he doesn’t matter,” she says with a small laugh. “You can take him right up to the gate yourself.” Eve steps even closer, her voice turning soft and gentle. “You can watch him cross over. Catch a glimpse of home.” She whispers, “But
“You know,” Cathy said, pulling Dean aside after a couple of drinks and some entendre-laden conversation. “I can’t figure out whether you’re trying to hit on me or wingman for your buddy.”
Claire hugs Cas for a long time. “Remember, if you ever need me, just pray,” he whispers into her hair. He feels her nod in response.
Dean couldn’t really question her judgement there. Cas did look awfully good that night, in jeans and a blue button-down from his Fed getup, sleeves rolled up to his elbows. After he’d gotten the hang of pool he was all steely determination and confident movements, tempered by a lightweight tipsy grin that gave him a quirky kind of warmth. The guy’s only sexual experience so far had ended with him nearly getting stabbed to death, so Dean was loathed to deny him a round two. He might have suggested that Beverly take Cas home on her own, because Dean was selfless and a good friend like that. But the idea of being there with Cas, showing him the ropes, and making sure that this time was everything that it should be for him, seeing his reactions during the best parts… the idea made his stomach roll over and his heart flutter in his chest, but it didn’t suck.
Cas swallows hard, anticipation buzzing over his skin like static. He does as Dean says: unzips his fly, and pulls out his cock, sighing at the touch of his own hand. He’s found over the past couple of days that his body responds to Dean very quickly, and he’s achingingly hard.
He ground against Cas, but the friction wasn’t nearly enough. He lowered his lips to Cas’ ear, and said roughly, “Wanna fuck you, Cas.” He felt Cas gasp and shiver underneath him. “Wanna make you feel as good as you made me.”
Uriel leans against a dead, splintered tree, a satisfied smirk on his face. He watches as Jack wanders among the men, studying their faces, waiting to see what happens next.
Dean hooks his fingers around the waistband of Cas’ jeans, and pulls them off along with his underwear, Cas lifting his hips to assist. Cas’ cock is already hard and aching, but before he can wrap a hand around it to get some relief, Dean is hovering over him again. Cas levers himself up on his forearms to kiss him. Dean plants a palm in the centre of Cas’ chest, and shoves him back down into the mattress.
Dean says, the last syllable drawn into an exclamation of surprise as Cas grips his shoulder and hauls him to his feet.
Cas joined Dean in the main room, grabbing his jacket from the back of a chair and shrugging it on. “Try to proposition a woman to have sex with us?”
Jack takes a breath, and the electricity bleeds out of the air. With one last glare over his shoulder at a stunned and shaken Balthazar, he turns calmly towards Cas.
"I don’t want to have a nice dinner," he continues, undeterred. "I want to spend time with you. I want you and Jack to get to know each other. I want…" Cas trails off. He wants so many things. Sometimes he feels like he’s made out of wants.
Two days later, Dean was checking into a motel on the outskirts of Boston. The cross-country drive hadn’t been a problem—Dean played Zeppelin the whole way, and while the speakers in the car weren’t as good as the ones in his bedroom, he
There are so many things that Castiel wants to tell her. He decides to start with the most immediate.
He listened to the song. Once he got over the sound of the drum machine, he noticed some distorted guitar was mixed in. There was a kind of churning rhythm, like wheels on the highway, that Dean could get behind, and the whole thing sounded
Viewed from afar, the children on the field could be a flock of birds, swooping and turning as a single body, their cacophony not so different from bird calls.
Cas has lost track of how many times he’s thought that this can’t be real, that he can’t possibly have Dean this way. And yet, here he is.
Dean’s gaze flits around uneasily. He’s not certain if he sees monsters creeping through the dark or if it’s his mind playing tricks on him. He shifts nervously and reminds himself that the wards will keep the monsters at bay. He wishes he found himself more convincing.
The warm hum of harmonica and bright plink of piano filled the car, and Dean’s gaze kept flicking up to the rearview mirror. Cas started listening to every song with a blank, open expression on his face, and Dean was trying to catch the moment when it shifted, when something about the song clicked for Castiel. This time, it was a dreamy, melancholy look that parted Cas’ lips and lit something behind his eyes, as Bruce Springsteen sang about a woman named Mary dancing alone on her front porch. It was a look that Dean felt in the pit of his stomach, ‘cause yeah, it captured the spirit of the song.
“Cas, how do you feel about sucking Dean’s cock?” she asked, the question hitting Dean like a punch to the gut.
“I don’t want to drive the rest of the way to Chicago with you yelling in my ear about the E Street Band, Dean.”
Cas might’ve been a rebel, but he did a good job following Maureen’s instructions. He took one of the pillows, put it under Dean’s hips, and pulled off Dean’s boxer briefs. He worked his way slowly down Dean’s torso, driving him crazy, spending time on his shoulders, his nipples, the soft patch under his belly button. His breath ghosted across Dean’s cock, and then he felt his mouth on his inner thigh, trailing down to his knee. Dean whimpered.
“Bye…” Anna sing-songs after them. As soon as they’re safely out of earshot, she gives Cas a sharp look. “They seem suspicious to you?”
Cas ruts against Dean’s ass, groaning as his straining cock finally feels the relief of some friction. Once Dean gets over the surprise of being repositioned, he lets out an answering groan, and shoves his ass back to meet every thrust. The head of Cas’ cock, slick with lube, catches on Dean’s rim, but doesn’t slide inside. Cas’ grace strains against his skin.
In his periphery, Dean keeps track of Castiel’s position. The angel isn’t zapping all over the place, but periodic flashes of light tell Dean that Cas is holding his own. Dean is also aware that the monsters are pushing them towards the chasm. He pushes back.
As the taxi pulled into the road, Dean’s eyes fell on Cas again. Cas was looking at him with all the warmth of a really good dream, as if he had never woken up.
Cas grits his teeth, and does as he’s told. He curls his fingers around his shaft, and moves his hand slowly up and down, tightening his grip slightly at the head. He doesn’t take his eyes off Dean for a moment, imagining what Dean will look like when Cas is moving inside of him.
Cas is curious, but he’s sure that the combination of flavours won’t do anything for him. Instead of accepting Dean’s offer, he reaches across the table, swipes his finger through the pool of syrup on Dean’s plate, and brings it to his mouth. The sugar hits his tongue, and he can
Cas watches as Dean shoves his pyjama pants down and kicks them away. His eyes trace over the soft lines of Dean’s shoulders, his stomach, his thighs. They rest for a moment on Dean’s cock, already half-hard.
Dean cursed under his breath and brushed his palm against his jeans, but that just irritated it more. He suddenly felt guilty that he couldn’t do something as simple as enjoy a nice day. But he still had to try. Otherwise it was all for nothing.
Cas’ gaze drifts again, resting everywhere except on Dean. Dean doesn’t care for that, or for the awkwardness thick between them. More important than whatever mess going on in Dean’s head is the fact that he misses his friend. And he doesn’t have to anymore.
“Yeah,” Dean shrugged, trying to bring an easy tone back into the conversation. “I mean, training wheels have gotta come off some time.”
Sam was leaning over him, eyes gleaming with a manic energy, hands hauling Dean up into a sitting position.
Just as one of his faster opponents is about to catch up, he draws his foot back, and sends the ball barrelling through the goal.
"What'd I tell you?" Dean says around a mouthful of meatlovers'. He gestures towards Eileen’s plate. "I'd offer to trade slices, but that’s not a pizza; that's a crime."
Dean felt like ice water had just been poured over his head, waking up something dark and sick that lived there. He plastered a reassuring smile on his face before he turned around.
They stood over the Impala’s trunk, with a collapsible card table in between them for sorting guns and knives, working in companionable silence. Or, it should have been companionable. Dean was steadily getting more and more agitated, as a question nagged at him.
It was like an alarm bell going off in Dean’s head every time Cas touched him. Like someone yelling at him every time Cas got too close. But Cas was only doing what Dean had taught him, was only acting in ways that Dean had encouraged. It wasn’t his fault that he didn’t know where the lines were; it wasn’t his fault that he didn’t know when to stop. So that made this change, whatever it was and however it happened, Dean’s fault.
His gaze snaps to Anna. She’s looking at him with that same soft glow as before. With a jolt, Cas realizes that it’s pride.
“I'd do anything,” Cas says, voice like gravel, like razor-wire, “anything for you. Dean, my love, my love.”
Dean expects the ancient hunger within Castiel to rear its head. He swears he can feel it seething beneath the angel’s skin. But instead, Cas is achingly tender with him.
Anna is a blaze in the sky, rising like a rocket, all fire and glory, out of Heaven and into the universe. Cas feels the moment that his wings stop pushing against air and break into the vacuum of space. Propelled by his grace, he comes to rest next to Anna where she hangs in the void.
“Hey, hey!” Dean protests. “That monster cares a hell of a lot about you. And you care about him. What happened to
Castiel is purpose, and that’s one thing that has not changed. He draws some comfort from that. Castiel is a warrior (
It was the kind of case that made Dean feel good about putting down the monster, but still left a sour taste in his mouth. The kind of case that was just bad enough to give Dean some motivation to get some beers and a lay in between him and the experience, but not bad enough to stick with him on the drive home.
Dean drove them to a spot by the river, where the glow of the city was behind them, and all they could see out the windshield were trees and water and the moon hanging heavy in the sky.
“Well,” Jody says, punctuating the word with a slap on the table top. “Let’s talk about something fun now. Cas, how did you and Dean end up together?”
Cas shrugged, and started combing his hair in the mirror over the dresser, while Dean shook out his razor and checked his reflection for missed spots.
A thing with fangs and claws leaps towards him. Castiel steps out of the way, grabs the thing by the throat, and slams it into the ground. A flash of grace lights up it’s face, and the soul dissolves, to re-materialize elsewhere. Nothing can die here.
This moment, Cas alive and promising a future without any more loss, is when Dean feels like he’s won.
Dean pulls off Cas' cock to look up at Cas through his lashes, a proud tilt to his spit-slick lips, before teasing him with his tongue again.
into the tape deck and whistled along with the saxophone solos. Dean watched him handle the wheel confidently.
“It’s not important.” Dean sighs. His arm swings towards Cas as if to take his hand, but then it falls back, and Dean clenches his fist at his side.
Cas takes in the stiffness of Dean’s shoulders, the white around his irises. He answers softly, "Okay."
, yes,” he sighed in relief, as his cock was engulfed in hot pressure. As he hit home, Beverly hummed in pleasure, and Dean could see Cas shiver and gasp at the vibrations.
Cas lets Dean lead him down the hall, like he did that first time. He feels a floating kind of happiness, imagining how many nights he and Dean have ahead of them, of one leading the other to bed.
"Okay…” Dean considers it. Assuming Cas’ wings hold out, the angel should be able to stay out of reach of the pack. “I guess there’s something to be said for simplicity.” Cas still has his back to Dean, so Dean steps forward to stand next to him. “You’ll be able to find me later?"
“I want to spend every day in the hot embrace of your body, until you're senseless with the pleasure of it."
The town makes a weak gesture at tourists, with a sign that declares it, “Heart of the Nation, Still beating strong!” but most of the businesses are aimed at farmers -- hardware, guns, motor repair. Most other things seem to be bought and sold used, passed around the community via the two or three auctioneers in town, not to mention the cavernous antique store across the street from theatre; the second-hand store next door with its dusty, yellowed windows; and the enigmatic “Curiosity Shop” across the way.
Cas nodded, and added seriously, “It tends to be more focused on the act of giving pleasure rather than the performance of receiving it.”
He grabbed the other end of the branch in Miracle’s mouth. There was a brief tug-o-war that Dean won; he hurled the branch into the field and smiled as Miracle chased after it.
Cas leans against the counter and watches the confident movements of Dean’s fingers as he finishes chopping.
Maureen hailed a taxi to take them to her apartment downtown. Dean introduced himself to her during the drive. He gave her a vague backstory, while she undressed him with her eyes. After feeling so unsteady with Cas, the way she looked at Dean put him back on solid ground, back in familiar territory.
“Serial killer plagues Chicago suburb…” Dean read off the screen, “Striking three times in as many months… victims all found with their hearts removed…” He nodded to Sam. “Werewolf?”
And so, Dean, Sam, and Cas had gone out to celebrate. They’d ended up in the kind of bar where the floors were sticky and the doors to the bathroom stalls hung off their hinges, but also where there were enough microbrews on tap to warrant a menu, and the bartender had a manbun and a handlebar moustache. A step up from their regular dives, with a clientele that was young and just shy of being insufferably hipsterish.
Cas took the cue that Dean offered to him, chalked the tip, and lined up his shot. The cue ball drifted gently off to the side.
“I just don’t know what to do with them,” Inias continues. Cas nods, while Anna and Jack listen sympathetically. “Kristen was the one who came up with the toys.”
The ten seconds lasted longer than Dean had thought. But they did end. And Maureen asked, “Cas, can you tell Dean something good about tonight?”
“Tell me what you want, sweetheart,” Dean murmurs against Cas’ lips. “Anything you want, I'll give it to you.”
Dean sighs and kneels next to his friend. "Cas…” he starts, reaching out to put a hand on his shoulder.
She ushers him towards the table she has set up on the lawn. Anna, Jack, Inias and Uriel are seated there already, sharing a pitcher of mimosa between them.
They kiss and touch, hands sliding under clothes, not undressing because they have to stay warm. Dean says things without thinking, because it makes him feel warm, things like,
Shocked into straightening his posture by the forcefulness of Cas' answer, Richard stares wide-eyed.
Dean exhales, swallows, and looks up at the ceiling. “Thanks.” He takes another breath before he adds, “Claire already told you, didn’t she?”
And if nothing had changed on Cas’ end, then Dean could safely say that nothing had changed on his end either. And it was the truth. His new knowledge about Cas wasn’t revelatory. It occupied the same place in Dean’s brain as the way Cas' eyes drifted closed when he listened to David Gilmour sing, “We’re just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,” or the moan he let out when he bit into one of Dean’s home cooked burgers.
Dean felt a glow of satisfaction at the sound, and beamed. “Right? Here, try it with the hot sauce.”
Dean made for the far bed, scowling the sagging mattress and the smell of sweat and disinfectant assaulting his nostrils.
“By the way,” Cas says, “I wanted to thank you for helping with Benjamin. What you said, I think it really affected him.”
Cas opens his mouth to reply defensively, when something occurs to him. He closes his mouth and smiles to himself, small and pleased.
That hurdle over with, Beverly shuffled her feet and said, with a nod to the pool tables “I, uh, noticed that you’re one player short of having even teams.”
He makes a mental note to be sure that the other angels are considering the importance of food as they construct new heavens. He’s about to make a remark to Dean about it, when he remembers Dean’s distress at the topic the other day.
“Oh! Almost forgot…” Dean snaps his fingers and springs back towards the kitchen counter. When he sits down again, it’s with an armful of condiments.
His eyes landed on a cassette tape cover that looked like a postcard from New Jersey. Dean grinned. A ten-hour drive to Chicago would be the perfect time to introduce Cas to The Boss.
“Should probably get a couch one of these days,” Dean says, shoving one of the recliners so it’s right up against the other.
“Sure you don’t want to try it with syrup?” he asks, spearing the last piece of pancake on his fork and offering it to Cas.
“Actually, you know Jack healed my wings,” Cas says, seemingly fascinated by the wood grain in the table.
Cas pressed closer to Dean, so they were touching hip-to-knee, and re-balanced the laptop. Dean clenched his jaw and didn’t move.
“Ramble On” was ending, flowing improvisations fading into silence, giving way to the 12-bar blues of “Moby Dick” -- simple, steady, but building in embellishments with each repetition, jarring the easy rhythm.
Cas keeps talking. “I need some time, to come to terms with how I feel, and to find a way to move on.”
to go back,” he says hurriedly, as if he’s been waiting for the chance to throw in his two cents. “Now that we finally have a god who cares about what we do, and who gives us a job that means something?”
“Cas, hey,” he says, soft and syrupy. Dean coils his arms around Cas’ neck. He turns the two of them around and walks backwards until his back hits the door. Dean pulls Cas closer, so Cas is pinning him against the door, cants his hips, and ducks his head to murmur against Cas’ skin.
Dean and Cas met Wendy in Nevada, after a salt-and-burn at an old Spanish mission. She had brown eyes, and hints of pink in her hair where the dye had not yet completely faded.
Sam rolled his eyes. He started shoving the weapons on the card table into a bag, to be taken back inside where they’d be sharpened and cleaned. “Okay, sure, if you say so. But maybe you could teach him something useful while you’re at it?”
, and Dean thinks he could get high off of it. There’s too many thoughts in his head, and none at all. He’s still grappling with the one fact that, by rights, should come as second nature to him by now:
Castiel nodded, stricken speechless, and Uriel smiled at Michael, "We understand brother. As you say, it will be done." Michael dismissed them with a wave of one of his hands, and the two lesser angels catapulted back down to Earth.
"That's why we've come to his student. You happen to be the most qualified interrogator we've got," Uriel sounded disgusted by the whole idea, and Dean wanted to hit him.
"Who's murdering the angels? How are they doing it?" Sam demanded, and Dean shivered at the tone and raw power of his little brother. Castiel watching from the floor, eyes wide.
"So you're possessing some poor bastard?!" Dean's voice was harsh and judgemental, and Castiel instantly understood how the word vessel could be misconstrued with demons.
"No," Castiel responded, rough voice hiding an emotion that Dean couldn't place, "she has to die." Dean's legs finally gave out, and he collapsed to the floor, kneeling in front of Anna and struggling to keep himself conscious.
"This...this is a vessel," Castiel answered hesitantly, unsure how Dean would react to the fact that this was not really what the angel looked like. Dean's eyes had been traveling intently up and down Castiel's form, but when he spoke they snapped back up to his face with a look of disgust that surprised the angel.
"You need to be more careful," he told Dean, fingers finding the curve of his mouth, pausing at the split in the center of the lower lip.
Castiel fought valiantly, exchanging blow after blow with Alistair, but the match wasn't even and Alistair slammed Castiel against the wall, holding him by the throat. "Well, like roaches, you celestials. Now, I really wish I knew how to kill you. But all I can do is send you back to heaven," the demon scowled, chanting in Latin, and Castiel choked, grace seeping through his eyes and mouth as white-blue light, dim ringing sounding in Dean's ears. Dean gasped, starting to drag himself along the floor towards Castiel, whimpering with the effort.
Dean bit his lip, almost thinking he could wake himself up that way, "yup, that's right. Besides, you're junkless down there, right? Like a fucking Ken doll."
"I am not kidding you," Castiel told them, slightly offended. Why would he make such an important point up? Chuck looked pale white, and Cas was debating whether forcibly removing the alcohol from his bloodstream was a viable option when he excused himself and stumbled up the stairs. Dean seemed to give up, body going lax and letting himself lean against him.
"It's an honor to meet you, Chuck. I admire your work." Castiel told him truthfully, and Dean scoffed.
Dean was about to respond that he was a damn hunter and his life WAS danger, when Castiel pressed soft, chapped pink lips to his, only for a moment, before disappearing, leaving the familiar empty ache inside Dean behind.
"I have been alive since before humans were evolved into intelligent beings," Castiel told him, "I know how sex works, I just have yet to put in into practice." Dean shuddered, and Castiel licked down around his balls and back up to the tip, Dean twitching at the teasing flicks of his tongue. "There is one thing I have always wanted to try, though," Castiel whispered, and Dean looked down at him, Cas' expression absolutely mischievous, "I want you to...
Castiel spoke to Uriel, and the feeling that something was wrong increased exponentially. Castiel decided to talk to the only angel who might understand his predicament.
His last year with Sammy was a good one, and when the hellhounds came for him Dean found himself replaying it in his mind. Lilith laughed as she opened the door for the beasts, and as they tore through his clothes and into his chest, Dean thought of the small things: Sam laughing with bright eyes, brotherly pranks, watching Sammy fight and claw his way through anything in his path, ever the hero. It was worth it. It was always worth it, anything for his little brother. When Dean's heart stopped beating and his eyes glazed over, as his soul dropped into hell, he hoped wherever this Castiel was that she would forgive him for leaving before he could meet her. He was glad she didn’t have to be torn up the way Sam was about Jess.
"I’m not a…hammer as you say, I have questions, I have doubts. I don’t know what is right and what is wrong anymore, whether you passed or failed here. But in the coming months you will have more decisions to make, and I don’t envy the weight that’s on your shoulders, Dean. I truly don’t," Castiel told him softly, and Dean could hear the concern in his voice, the mate in him was calmed by it. Dean dug his fingernails into his palms, trying to keep from vomiting and passing out at the same time. "Dean..." Castiel said, voice whisper soft, "we should really talk about this. I understand human anatomy- I know how ill-"
"Castiel? Oh, he, uh...he's not here. See, he has this weakness. He likes you," Uriel told him, and Dean shivered at the blatant mention of Castiel's fondness for him. Apparently, even the other angels were noticing, and Dean couldn't help but wonder if that meant bad things were coming for Castiel as well as Anna. "Time's up, boy. We want the girl," Uriel demanded.
"Slaughter House Five Vonnegut, or Cat's Cradle Vonnegut?" Dean asked suspiciously, and Sam gave him a look of surprise.
"You sure, Cas? I mean, I'm not small, I could choke you, 'specially if you don't know what you're doing," Dean told him, though his hips were already twitching with the idea of being inside that gorgeous mouth.
When his older brother Lucifer fell from heaven and from grace, all the angels mourned his loss, and several hundred more followed suit, spiraling down and down, below the Earth, into another realm completely. Castiel’s brother Michael called this realm
“Man… I just can’t believe it’s really you,” Sam’s voice broke on the last word, his eyes teary and lip trembling. Instead of looking like the imposing giant of a man he was, Dean was reminded of chubby little six year old Sammy waiting for him to get home from school.
"I don't know what to do, tell me what to do!" Castiel whispered fervently, and Anna shook her head at him.
"Unless this isn't his will," Anna responded softly, and Castiel inhaled a breath he didn't really need, "The Father you love. You think he wants this? You think he'd ask this of you? You think this is righteous?" Castiel hissed through his teeth, covering his face with a palm, and Anna sighed, "what you're feeling, Castiel, is called doubt." Castiel felt his fists clench as another scream rang through the air. "These orders are wrong and you know it. But you can do the right thing. You're afraid, Cas. I was too. But together, we can still-" Castiel growled, and Anna stopped talking, taking a step back from him.
"Dean, we could use Sam on this," Bobby said, brow furrowed in concern, clearly against the idea as a whole.
idea, Castiel thought frantically. If he were to stay around Dean, be a guardian for him, there was no way he could distance himself from the pull, the attraction to his soul. He would soon think of himself as Dean’s proper mate, and that certainly would not be looked kindly upon. On the other hand… it would give him exactly what he wanted, what he always dreamt of finding. Even now, his grace was empty, screaming for the soul it had held ever so briefly. Castiel was also very aware this was not a request, but an order. He had no choice.
Dean shut his eyes, a palm pressed over his face, and when he glanced at Castiel again, the look in his eyes was enough to strike fear into the angel, "I'd only do this for you, Cas."  Castiel flinched as if he'd been struck, and the human grabbed the loaded cart of demon torture equipment, and wheeled it into the next room, slamming the door behind him. Castiel remained motionless, grace rolling around, conflicted.
"He's got a wife and a kid. We put him on a bus and send him home," Dean spoke so harshly even he could hear the emotion in his voice.
Sam burst into the room first, and his gun was drawn almost instantly, aimed at Castiel's chest. Castiel regarded him coolly, it wasn't like the gun itself could do much damage to him anyway. "Who are you?" the taller Winchester demanded, gun leveled in steady hands. Dean quickly followed him in, and upon seeing who it was he pushed down Sam's weapon, frowning.
Dean was kinda pissed off, honestly. He and Sammy had gone to investigate a routine haunting, and had run into a much,
"No," Anna said, and Dean inwardly sighed with relief, "I just sent them far away. I don't know how I did it...it just popped into my head." Dean's eyes narrowed at her, and he turned to Sam.
"Cas... please come home." Dean whispered, ignoring the blank feeling that told him the connection didn't exist, "come back to me."
"You can do that?" Dean asked dubiously, still more than a little taken aback at this whole situation. At least his fever had died down with Castiel far away from him, and the hex bags that Ruby gave them were keeping the other angels from finding them again, "so, what, you're just gonna take some divine bong hit, and, shazam, you're Roma Downey?"
"I'm going to get it back," Anna announced, voice resigned, "if I can find it, I'm going to get my grace back."
... my mouth," the angel told him, and Dean hissed between his teeth, eyes wide both from hearing the angel swear and from what he was proposing. Dean swallowed hard, looking at his mate.
Dean huffed a laugh, which ended in another coughing fit, and Sam handed him a water bottle, and he took a swig and a breath, "yeah, well, he's like a black belt in torture. I mean, you guys are out of your league."
Not that Dean would ever say that out loud,even if threatened with bodily harm. Still, it was nice to think it. He wasn't sure how angels could feel about humans, but Cas and him were always weird anyway, and it was nice.
A year later, Sam left. He packed up all his crap and didn’t leave a trace behind. Dean’s father was livid. He threw himself into the obsessive hunting like he always did. Every night was spent drinking himself into oblivion. Dean was lonelier than ever, so much it hurt. He picked up a new girl every night, taking her home or her taking him home, and he perfected the art of flirting. He never asked their names. He didn’t want to hear it. The sex helped ease the ache, the body next to him in bed was warm but never quite right. Dean always left before morning. There were exceptions to the rule, like Cassie and Lisa, but they weren’t right either. They liked him, maybe even loved him, but he always knew it wouldn’t work. And beneath it all, Dean was empty. He was hollow, and he was broken. By the time his Dad went missing for days, Dean had given up hope on ever finding his Castiel.
"Oh, fuck, come on," Dean grimaced, holding his stomach with a hand. Castiel twitched, and Dean eyed him carefully from the corner of his eye.
, and it soon was obvious any angel who fell into Hell twisted, grace becoming distorted, dimmed, and finally darkened completely.
The house of the author was really run down, old, and not taken care of very well, and Dean felt an absurd moment of hurt feelings that the general public didn't like the books more than they did, that they were so unpopular the author went bankrupt. He scowled at himself and rang the doorbell, Sam tall and imposing on the other side of him, and when a short, raggedy looking man answered the door, absolutely reeking of alcohol, Dean couldn't help but be even more annoyed. “You Chuck Shirley?” Dean practically snarled the words, fists clenched, and the man trembled ever so slightly.
By the time the Winchester brothers cross paths with Anael, Castiel had been tracking Dean's health and whereabouts daily. He's careful about it, stealing away to keep tabs on his mate when the rest of the garrison is otherwise occupied, and always returning before they realize he's gone. The angel had never felt this emotion before; granted, as an angel he didn't normally feel a wide range of emotions anyway, but the feeling that currently resided in his grace was strong and acrid and wholly unpleasant. It made him feel faintly ill each time he saw Dean and the human looked a little worse; Dean was losing weight and had developed a cough, the golden skin Castiel had so lovingly crafted was now consistently paler than usual. The angel knew why it was happening, bond withdrawal was well documented in human history, but the fact it was happening to his mate and he could do nothing about it was driving Castiel insane. He couldn't force Dean to accept him or listen to reason, and so he hovered instead, keeping track of Dean's vital signs and trying to keep the hardest hunts and monsters out of his path. When Michael called Castiel and Uriel back to heaven, Castiel was sure he had finally been found out, that Dean's symptoms had finally become severe enough that the angel's superiors had noticed.
Then, he found himself suspended, pierced through by hooks and chains seemingly attached to nothing, a grinning, twisted, horrifying demon form in front of him, slicing into him and laughing, the pain happening over and over again. Sammy, Dean’s mind screamed, I did this for Sammy. Dean knew this was coming, and day after day he told himself it was worth it, until the day he couldn’t picture his brother’s face. Thirty years he suffered, clinging to memories of being human, until he couldn’t bear the pain anymore, until he couldn’t remember ever being human. He stepped off the rack and sliced into the first victim, a twisted smile on his face. With every heartbeat one word rang in his head, the only thing that remained of his humanity.
"Lucifer is no friend of ours," Uriel's voice was annoyed, and Castiel guessed he didn't like the amount of talking back he was getting from the humans before him.
face, sorrow maybe, and it was gone as quickly as it was there. The monster gripped the magic knife, pulling it out of his body, dropping it to the floor and fixing those blue eyes impassively on Dean, who was leaning against the table, gasping for air, trying not to throw himself at the inhuman man in front of him. Dean noted dully that he didn't even BLEED, despite the fact the knife should have pierced his heart. His stomach dropped as
When they arrived back and found Sam’s soul-bond dead, killed by the same demon that got their mother, Dean looked at Sam’s face, an eerie echo of their father’s, expression grim and vengeful. He didn’t try to talk much to his brother; it wasn’t going to do any good. He knew what people were like after losing their soul-bond. You got half of you ripped away, and some people even died from it. Dean knew his brother well enough to know he wasn’t one of those people, but as time went on, Dean wondered if Sammy wouldn’t rather be dead sometimes.
"Well, we know who she is. If we work together we can-" Sam was cut off my by Uriel whirling and glaring at both the humans.
"You think you can stop us?" Uriel's voice was incredulous and a little bit amused, and Dean wanted to shoot him between the eyes, even if he knew it wouldn't do much good, "Castiel, I will not let these peo-"
"Just give me the demon's name, Alistair," Dean practically growled, and the demon pointedly ignored him.
"Who is going to stop us?" Uriel smirked, "You? This demon bitch?" Castiel flinched as Uriel flung out a hand, smashing the demon into the far wall. Dean leaped at Uriel, face twisted into a snarl, and Castiel did cry out now, turning quickly to Uriel to demand he cease action. Uriel slammed his fist directly into Dean's stomach, and his already weak body crumpled under the angel's strength. Castiel winced, grasping Uriel's arm, yanking on him hard enough that Uriel turned to face him with a confused expression. Castiel had just opened his mouth to explain when a bright light engulfed both angels, and they were flung far away from the tiny cabin, and consequently he was flung far away from his hurting mate.
Dean yanked at Chuck, dragging him towards the door robe and slippers and all. "I need you to come with me, right now."
, he quickly corrected his thoughts, and he forced himself to his feet, Sam reaching to steady him. Ruby watched silently and knowingly from the corner of the room, also looking none to worse for wear.
"Ah, this one just won't quit, will he? I think I'm starting to like you, boy," Uriel looked a Castiel when he spoke, and Castiel clenched one fist, eyes glowing as he tried to control his temper. Dean watched Uriel vanish and shook his head.
The next time Castiel saw Dean Winchester, it was also under unpleasant and duty related circumstances. The raising of Samhain was well under way, and the boys had already been investigating when Castiel and his garrison mate Uriel were sent down to Earth with new orders to take care of the issue. As Castiel flew swiftly to the run-down motel room the Winchesters were staying at, he couldn't help but feel his grace leap at the closer proximity to his mate. He composed himself, instantly reminded he wasn't alone. Out of all his garrison, Uriel was bound to be the least accepting of this abnormal grace mating. Castiel still hadn't mentioned it to anybody, he was debating what to do about this situation himself, still absorbing what was going on. Each time he was around Dean it got harder and harder to control the urges of the mating, to not claim Dean as his.
"Want it, no," Castiel whispered, voice rough, "but I've been told we need it." Dean was shaking his head before Castiel even finished his sentence, and he had to clear his throat several times before he spoke.
“The Chuck Shirley who wrote the 'Supernatural' books?” Sam added, his tone barely any nicer than Dean's.
"I'm an angel, Dean," Castiel gave him an impatient look, "I don't have a gag reflex." Dean moaned aloud, and Cas opened his mouth, placing it around Dean's cock, dipping his head and smoothly sliding all the way down to the base. Dean quivered, watching Castiel's throat open and bulge as his cock slid into it, and when Castiel drew back, the warm, wet, slick feeling made him jerk."Now
"Broke some ribs, I think," he managed to grind out through his chattering teeth, "gimme a minute." Sam stepped back and watched with worried eyes as Dean painstakingly managed to lever himself into a siting position, one arm wrapped around his torso. "So what the fuck was that?" Dean asked, looking around to see no angels in sight.
"I think we will just take that," Dean snatched the manuscript from Chuck's hands despite his arguments, "and you can stay here and write some more. It would be nice to see what we're going up against, and not just about Sam's sex life."
"You've got to be kidding me," Sam rubbed his hands over his face and Chuck cleared his throat nervously.
"I trust Ruby," Sam replied evenly, "after you were gone, she saved my life. Ruby came back for me. Whatever you have to say, she saved me. More than that, she got through to me. What she said to me... It's what you would've said. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here." Dean stared at his brother for a second, reading between the lines. Sammy was in deeper with this demon than Dean would have ever guessed. Sam popped Dean's shoulder in on the count of three, and Dean gasped with pain. Sam frowned as he touched his brother, all Dean felt like was skin and bones, and Sam could almost count the columns of his spine through his thin t-shirt. "Dean, you look awful," Sam gave his brother his best bitchface, "you need to talk to Castiel and see what you can do." Dean shoved away his brother, rubbing his injured shoulder with his good hand.
"You know, the only thing I remembered in Hell was that name," Dean muttered, head throbbing, "he sure isn't what I pictured. Not at all." Anna smiled, her hand sliding up to cup Dean's cheek, eyes soft.
characters!” Chuck told them, sounding exasperated and a bit frightened, “I made them up! They're not
"Why?" Dean asked, ever the one who opposed whatever was asked of him. Castiel scowled and held up a hex bag, the powerful magic stinging his fingertips, and the fact that his mate would have been dead tomorrow if Castiel hadn't been here made him livid.
Castiel returned to the hospital as soon as he had healed and cleaned himself up, mentally exhausted in a way he couldn't ever remember being. He landed beside the hospital bed, Sam had been there at first, of course, but after a few whispered pleas from the angel, the younger Winchester had reluctantly agreed to leave the angel alone with Dean. Castiel sat in a chair next to the bed, studying his mate, fingers trailing lightly over the bandages, eyes narrowed and brow crinkled in thought. He was relieved to see that Dean was now breathing on his own, and though his eyes were shut Castiel could tell he was awake.
“Sounds like you landed yourself a nerd, dude,” Sam teased, and Dean socked him lightly in the arm before half smiling.
Castiel was still praying, listening to the screams, when the light bulb above his head flickered and burst, dimming the room. He didn't have to turn around to tell who was there.
"The raising of Samhain; have you stopped it?" Castiel asked, gazing unblinkingly into Dean's green eyes.
There was miles and miles of unmarred, gorgeous skin, paler than Dean's own. Cas wasn't nearly as slight as he looked in the hideous too-large suit he normally wore, he actually had a very sturdy frame, and his muscles were toned, not an extra ounce of fat anywhere. It was a runner's body, and Dean took a moment to watch the muscles ripple as Castiel shifted his weight. Inevitably, Dean's gaze trailed lower, and he bit his lip as he caught sight of Cas' cock, standing hard and flushed, curving towards Castiel's stomach, not as large as Dean's but still a very respectable length and girth. Dean's mouth was suddenly very dry, and he buried his face into the angel's neck, taking deep breaths, trying to steady his nerves. Cas held him out at arm's length, cupping his face in warm hands and stroking thumbs along Dean's mouth, brow furrowed in concern, “Dean, you don't need to do this right now. I don't wish for you to... regret this later.” His voice was just as rough and raw as Dean had hoped, and Dean looked up, meeting Castiel's eyes, smiling at the longing there.
“See, here's the thing,” Dean snapped, officially done with this shit, “ we have a life. You've been using it to write your books.” Dean shoved the door open and shoved Chuck backwards in the process, and the writer exclaimed in surprise.
"Is it true?" Dean's voice was little more than a whisper, and Castiel trailed his hand through Dean's hair, "did I break the first seal? Did I start all this?"
Castiel was experiencing another unpleasant emotion he wished he would have never discovered in his entire exsistence. He and Uriel were tossed into the far corner of Russia by the banishing sigil, luckily still in their vessels. His grace hurt with the forced flight, but the minute Castiel became aware of himself again, he took off, disappearing without a word to Uriel, worry over his mate giving him focus. Dean didn't know it, but Castiel had been monitoring him for some time now, trying to keep him as safe as possible with the bond withdrawal weakening him more every day. He knew precisely where the group was headed, despite whatever spell was now blocking him from sensing his mate. Castiel flew directly to Bobby Singer's house, through the floor into the basement, to what they called the "panic room," and that was where he drew to a stop, instantly masking his grace to not alert Dean he was there through the bond, and making his vessel invisible and soundless.
"Everybody's dying these days. And hey, I get it. You're all-powerful. You can make me do whatever you want. But you can't make me do this," Dean snarled, shoving at Uriel's chest furiously.
All too soon, the kiss ended, Dean slipping away with a sigh, and Castiel almost had to physically restrain himself from pulling him back. Dean looked at the angel, those brilliant eyes dulled and fatigued. "Tell Uriel, or whoever, that you do NOT want me doing this, trust me," Dean told him, and Castiel shut his eyes for a second, his grace literally howling inside him, instincts of a mate fighting instincts of a soldier.
"And you're FALLING!" Anna yelled right back, pointing at the door to the torture room, "you're falling for HIM. Whether you actually rebel from heaven or not, you are already HIS."
"If anything threatens a prophet, anything at all, an archangel will appear to immediately destroy that threat. Archangels are fierce and absolute. They're heaven's most terrifying weapon," Cas replied slowly, still apparently waiting for Dean to catch up, an earnest look on his face.
"How about a reflex exercise? I've got a gun in my pocket right now. Come with me or we'll see who the quicker draw is, me or the angel," Dean stared seriously at Chuck, who slowly went white. Dean smirked, now he had him.
"Thanks, Cas," Dean told him, all the heat gone from his tone. Cas apparently took this as permission to grab him by the jacket lapels and drag him into a rough, desperate kiss.
"Oh...no, I just kind of...overhear them," Anna replied, frowning, "it all started on September eighteenth."
"Its name. It's whispering to me, warning me to turn back," Pamela explained quickly, eyes still shut tight, grip on Dean's arm hurting now. She began chanting again, and the TV buzzed almost as furiously as Dean's head, whining sound increasingly frantically in pitch, candles flickering with an invisible breeze.
"What visage are you in now?" Dean asked, "what, holy tax accountant?" His voice wavered interestingly on the words, jaw clenching, and Castiel observed this with curiosity.
Dean ranted, voice breaking on the last words as he doubled over and began coughing, Sam coming to pound his back, Dean pressing his jacket to his mouth. When he could finally breathe again, his sleeve was red with blood. Castiel inhaled sharply and took a quick step forward, only stopping when Uriel shot him a look.
"We're here for Anna," Castiel's voice was firm, and Dean felt his knees betray him and tremble ever so slightly.
Sammy, ever the smart one, figured out an approximate location of Anna's grace from the date she was conceived as a human baby and the area she lived in as a human, searching back in the records to see if there were any astronomical abnormalities. Dean spent the research time talking with Anna, she bandaged his ribs and he found her surprisingly funny, and refreshing. She really hadn't been lying when she said she wasn't like the other angels. Dean couldn't imagine Castiel ever smiling with him like this. He regretted it almost as soon as he thought of the angel, his stomach flipping so hard he had to sit down, and Anna watched him and kneeled beside him, placing a gentle hand on his forehead.
"He's a devout man. He actually prayed for this," Castiel hastened to reassure his mate. He hated the way Dean was currently looking at him.
Dean hung around the rundown vending machine outside their room trying to gather up the good sense enough to do what he was about to do. Despite the growing closeness he was feeling with Castiel, he'd never called to him before, and he honestly felt like an idiot. "Please, Cas. I need some help, so I'm praying, okay? Even though I feel stupid." There was a woosh of wings and there was his mate, standing far too close, not that that was anything unusual.
Dean gasped, and Sam's eyes shot up, locking onto Dean, remembering. Dean shook his head at Sammy, no way would he have been paired with some
"What's... going on?" the man blinked familiar blue eyes, and Dean wanted to believe everything was okay, that Castiel was unharmed.
"So THIS is the guy who decides our fate?" Dean scoffed, although the tightness in his shoulder lessened a little at the touch. Castiel shook his head, his hand sliding to Dean's other shoulder to repeat the motion.
"What you're asking is not within my power to do, Dean," Castiel answered quietly, fingers playing with the cuffs of his trenchcoat.
Dean had never, and will never be a match for Alistair. Whether that was a product of inbred fear from hell, or simply the fact that he was a really fucking powerful demon, Dean didn't know, but he did know in a fair fight he'd get demolished a hundred times over. The boys barely escaped the church, the demon-bitch Ruby having fled with the girl who could hear angels, and Dean was currently sitting in a filthy motel room, on an equal disgusting bed, watching his brother sew up the cut on his own arm he'd received from tossing himself out a window. "So your demon buddy has her now. Is she seriously safe?" Dean was dubious, his instincts screamed at him to not trust anything from hell. Sam glanced at him, Dean was holding his arm awkwardly because of the dislocated shoulder, and noted the bags under his older brother's eyes.
It seemed rather ironic that grace would create something as magically beautiful and huge as an oak tree, when all Dean had seen grace used for was killing and destruction. When they arrived at the location, in Union, Kentucky, they all piled out of the car, and Dean inhaled sharply at the gorgeous sight of the field and the tree, it looked ethereal, unnaturally beautiful.
"Don't worry," Uriel's smile was absolutely predatory, "I'll kill her gentle." Anna couldn't help crying out, and Dean stood a little more firmly, adrenaline sinking in.
grab the iron easily from Bobby, and touch two fingers gently to the older man's forehead, dropping Bobby to the ground unconscious.
