“I told you. I went to study the bees,” Cas reminded him.
“It’s Charlie,” Bobby said. Sam and Dean heard a muffled “I’m coming” from the older hunter.
Dean’s brain short circuited. The moment wasn’t crackling with electricity anymore. It was a fire, warm and blazing and demanding his attention. What the hell? Why was he acting like some chick in a freaking rom com? He just stared at Cas, lost in those blue eyes, waiting for--
“First of all, I don’t anyone who knows the benefits of emotions and opinions thinks you’re broken. You’re different from the other angels, sure, but that’s not a bad thing. And it makes sense. Most angels don’t get as up close and personal with humans as you have.”
“It wasn’t unnecessary,” Dean said. “I’m just getting even. He’s been bugging me all day about--” He abruptly cut himself off, cheeks turning red.
Cas shook the thought away and focused on the papers.
“He’ll be fine,” the angel told him. A sinking sensation came over Dean. He knew it well--the drop in his stomach from missing a step on the stairs, or something on a hunt going sideways.
He shook his head and walked back to the table. “What do I need to know about the case?”
Dean’s stomach and jaw clenched. He shook his head. “Bobby’s gonna have plenty to say. Let’s just talk about it then.”
“Come on,” Sam said, clapping his brother on the back and taking Bobby’s keys with a nod of thanks. “We should get going.”
It was Cas. It was really, really Cas.
The two hours inched by. Dean’s mind wandered between the news, Charlie, and the one person he thought of whenever life got too quiet:
“Yeah. Think you guys should hunker down wherever you are until this boils over.”
Sam frowned at him. “What face?”
“Spit what out?”
“It’s really quiet out here,” Sam explained. His worried eyes searched Dean’s face, his brow furrowed. “I’ve never seen you like this unless we’re fighting, man. Would talking about it help?”
“I’d tell you good luck,” Sam told her, “but you’re not gonna need it. If you can push these two together--”
Her stern look was almost humorous. Dean nodded, blinking away the tears that were threatening to escape. Happy tears. How fucking strange.
. Dean buried his head under the covers. He wanted to run away from this. He’d give fucking anything to run away from this.
Sam’s eyes flew open, wild and confused. “Hey, hey, take it easy,” Dean told him. “Here.” He held out the bar and water bottle with a cheesy fake grin. “Breakfast. Bobby’s working on coffee.”
“And what’s that help going to cost us?” Dean asked.
to believe. He brought himself back to the present by remembering when the Leviathans had possessed Cas, which brought back other memories. Images.
“If it breaks, all of that energy will go right back into Cas
look at his freckles, his cheekbones, his lips. Dean was
to stop wandering off.”
Dean’s eyes went far away. “Yeah.” He shook his head and reached into the fridge, getting a beer for each of them. He cracked them open and handed one to Sam, then to Bobby. Bobby put a hand on his shoulder. For a guy who was so very drunk, Bobby’s eyes were oddly clear. “You did all you could.” He focused that gaze on each Winchester in turn. “Not your fault.”
The smile turned into a shit-eating grin. “Fucking finally.” He turned his head to the side and towards the stairs. “Bobby!”
Bobby drank, too. “We’ll figure it out. Might take us a bit, but we’ll figure it out. We know how to hurt the bastards now. That’s a start.”
“Yeah?”
Dean had forgotten just how friggin’ nosy his moose of a brother could be.
Dean glared at him. When Sam didn’t back down, he turned to Bobby. “You gonna help me on this?”
Dean sat at the table, and Cas followed suit. “Well, I’m guessing you know Dick Roman is the boss guy, right?” Cas nodded. “The hospital in Sioux Falls has at least two. Or they did, last time we were there.” Dean rattled off the rest of the Leviathan info that he thought Cas should know. Maybe it was the whiskey. Maybe it was the routine of catching Cas up on a case. But the tension and awkwardness were fading. This was normal. It was a strange version of normal since Bobby and Sam weren’t around, without a doubt. But Cas watching Dean as he spoke, taking in every word? Dean making sure they were on the same page? Talking about monsters? That was normal. Easy.
Sam gave him a shit-eating grin. “Doctor. Sexy.”
, ‘stead of hemming and hawing about it.”
“You’re seeing wolves, right? Wolves are friends!”
Dean didn’t respond, but his shoulders relaxed just a hair.
Sam raised his eyebrows. “Jody? Really?”
Cas’ eyes went distant, and a small smile crossed his face. “I remember her.” He tilted his head, focusing back on Bobby. “How do you know her?”
Dean shook his head. “Charlie would probably be in a cafe, right? Hiding in plain sight?”
Cas. The name, the nickname
Dean sighed and picked up an axe. “Okay. Fine. Sure.”
Sam’s eyebrows relaxed, and his smile grew.
Dean tried to convince himself that his heart’s new frantic pace was just because Bobby made the coffee too strong. Or maybe he drank it too fast. It definitely had nothing to do with Cas, who was right behind him. Dean could practically feel the power radiating off of the guy. Jesus, had that always been there? Was it something else?
“Is this normal?” Jody asked Bobby. “Angels dying and coming back to life?”
Dean glared at Bobby, but by hell if the old drunk didn’t glare right back. They’d had this conversation not that long ago. “I keep my marbles in a lead box,” Dean had said. But that didn’t mean none of them were cracked.
“A new business plan,” Sam said. “Something about corn syrup?”
Sam nodded, looking thoughtful. “I’m with Dean on this one.”
“Dean, this is great. You’ve been carrying around all sorts of anger and shit that you don’t have to.” Sam’s eyebrows came together in a frown, but his lips were still quirked in a smile. “How did Charlie pull this off in a day?”
“If you count more files of dirt on Dick than you could imagine, yeah,” Sam said. “We only skimmed the first file or two, but it seems like he’s buying land. Lots of it.”
“Dean!” Cas called. He broke away from Charlie.
“Easy.” They heard the distinctive crack of popping knuckles. “I’ll bring them to you.” Her voice pitched up in a question. “Where are you, anyhow?”
Dread filled Dean’s stomach.
“So, our super intense power source is a tiny witch?” Dean asked once they were out of earshot.
Dean looked at the screen. Jericho had been their first stop. It was vaguely familiar. He grabbed a beer and sat in front of the TV. “Fine by me.” He ignored Sam’s eye roll and focused on the news and the beer.
“Yeah, buddy. I do.”
Dean tried to hide the pain that ripped through him. He only half hoped it worked. Sam and Bobby had always been able to see past his bullshit.
Cas nodded, a hint of a smile at the corners of his beautiful blue eyes. “Hello, Dean.”
“That can’t be good,” Bobby grumbled.
“I’ll give you boys a minute,” she said, completely ignoring him. “Gotta get a few other things.” She left them again.
She snorted. “You got this.” She ruffled his hair before disappearing in a rush of wings.
“How?” Charlie asked.
Charlie spun around and positively beamed at him. “Someone had to take care of the queer relationships. You know--men and men, women and women, enby people with whoever--anything that isn’t a cis hetero man with a cis hetero woman.” Her eyes sparkled. “The other Cupids have no clue what they’re doing.”
“So, back to Cas. You’re pissed at him, but you also love him. Right?” Charlie asked.
. Alive. “It’s damn good to see you,” he eventually managed to choke out when he remembered how to speak.
“This is the first time anyone’s been killed there for decades,” Bobby interjected. “And people live longer. The hospital hasn’t been overwhelmed or overrun for decades.”
“How?” Sam asked. “How’d he figure that out?”
Bobby insisted on driving them back. “You boys have been running on empty for days,” he reminded Dean. “Rest.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Shut up.” They walked through a particularly thick patch of trees and saw a frazzled Charlie, grumpy Bobby, and happy drunk Cas.
Dean didn’t even have words. He let his emotions show through his eyes: fear and hope warring together equally.
Dean focused on the angel, whose head was lying against the window. “You just rest, okay? Here.” He balled up his jacket and handed it to Cas. “For a pillow,” he explained when his gesture was met with confusion.
One task, one mile marker, one minute at a time.
Cas squeezed his hand, and those damn butterflies started dancing again. “Dean?” he asked quietly.
“Why are you asking?” she said, shaking her head.
“You think?” Dean asked. He met Cas’ gaze with a fierce glare. “Do you have
Dean shrugged. “I don’t know, man.”
it. He loved kissing another guy. He loved the contrast between Cas’ rough stubble and his soft hair, the sharp lines of his body and his pillow-soft lips. He caught Cas’ bottom lip between both of his, and Cas groaned. The hesitation disappeared. Cas spun them around so Dean was against the wall. Shock zipped through Dean, amplifying the arousal that had been simmering ever since Cas kissed him the first time. Dean ran his hands under Cas’ trench coat before trying to push it off.
Dean’s eyes flashed to Sam and Bobby. “Not yet. Give me a minute.” He indicated the stairs with a jerk of his chin before heading up them, giving Chet a death glare first. Bobby and Sam weren’t far behind. Sam closed the basement door and cocked an eyebrow at his brother. Dean moved farther into the living room--out of Chet’s earshot, he hoped--and Bobby and Sam followed. Dean pressed a button on his phone. “You’re on speaker, Charles.”
have a funeral, so...”
“You ok, Sammy?”
“Just about,” Sam said. He shrugged, his eyes a little wild. “Ever since she taught me how to build that stupid robot.” His expression told Dean to go with it.
Sam handed him a stack of papers. “Since Dean decided to kill the planet and print everything out--”
“Jody?” Sam asked, beaming.
Cas agreed, and they walked most of the way back in silence. Just as the cabin came into view, Cas asked one more question. “Why a cupid?”
“Or has bigger problems to deal with,” Sam said. “Have you read the news lately? The federal news?”
asked Charlie.
“I have ‘Baby Shark’ queued up to run for the rest of time if I don’t turn it off in the next few minutes.”
“Spit it out, Sammy.”
She smiled wearily. “Happy to help. The headache will fade, anyway.”
“You think she’ll listen?” Dean asked, arching an eyebrow.
Bobby took a breath. He was oddly pale. “Looking for our favorite crazy angel.”
“Charlie...how are you--” Sam started.
Guilt tore at Dean’s insides. He’d been so caught up in his own shit, he hadn’t even thought about Sam’s feelings. Sam wasn’t in love with Cas (at least, Dean really hoped not), but he did love the guy. “This isn’t on you,” he told his brother in what he hoped was a calming voice. “Cas broke the wall, so it was on Cas to fix it. You didn’t ask him to take on the crazy. None of us did. That was his choice.”
“Dean,” Cas said again. “What are you doing?”
“What’s wrong?” she asked.
“Thanks, kid,” Dean said.
“We don’t do check-ins.”
“Either okay or faking it like a pro. Which isn’t out of the question,” Bobby told him.
“How would that help our favorite flannel-wearing duo?”
was the most disoriented he’d ever felt. Something about it made his heart break wide open. He wanted to cry.
“Nice to meet you,” Dean and Sam muttered in turn.
“Wonder who ganked the Leviathan,” Bobby mumbled once they’d sorted out the directions.
“Died?” Jody asked.
. “Yeah, buddy. I did.”
“Jody was here before, right?” Cas asked. “After I got my memory back?”
“D’you think it’s worth hunting Dean down?” Sam asked.
he chided himself.
Sam ran a hand down his face. “Dunno.” He shrugged. “Guess I just wish you’d talk to your own brother about whatever you’re going through. Not just Charlie with her angel mojo or whatever.”
A terrible, heavy weight started to lift in his chest. This was going to work. Sam was going to be--
. Yes. Unfortunately.”
“But fire is--”
“Or?”
Bobby was speechless. Elle turned her attention to Cas. “Hey there,” she said in a soothing voice. “I heard your head got a little banged up.”
Cas nodded. “I see things. And words are hard. Listening is hard. Staying still is hard.”
Cas nodded. “After, well, it must have been after I exploded and died--”
Well, until Cas crash-landed onto the hood of the car.
“Ask if the sheriff stayed the night,” Bobby told him.
“Do you even have a signal?” Sam asked.
“Considering you boys drove for 23 hours straight, yeah, I’d call that early.” Bobby pointed to something in the newspaper. “Once the room stops spinning, read through this.”
“Don’t bother,” Bobby said. “It’d be a waste of time. I know a guy who might be a match for it. If nothing else, he can give you boys new IDs. The whole damn country might think you’re dead, but that’s no reason to be stupid.”
He was in love with Dean. Which was complicated. And problematic. Could angels even fall in love with humans? To his knowledge, that had never ended well.
, was back.
Cas opened his mouth to speak, but Sam spoke first. “Dean, it worked. It might’ve made a bigger mess than we had before, but
“I’m going to kill them,” Dean said in a cold, tight voice that wasn’t quite his own. “I’m gonna kill every last one of them.”
“Sorry about that,” Sam muttered.
“Didn’t know angels could hope for shit,” Dean mumbled. He half-sat, half-collapsed into a chair.
Cas gave Dean an unreadable look. It lingered just a heartbeat longer than usual--long enough for the butterflies in Dean’s stomach to start tap dancing. The angel went back to his papers.
Cas gave Dean the softest, most tender look he’d ever been given. It was care and affection and admiration and...love, probably. “I’m already overwhelmed. I do want to sleep with you, but I want to savor it the first time. Not rush it.” He smiled shyly. “Maybe we could go on a date first.”
He glared at Bobby. “You asked how I am. I told you. You think I’d lie to you?”
“Dean. Dean?” Cas’ low, gravelly voice brought Dean out of a vague, fuzzy stress dream.
The angel’s eyes became almost sympathetic. “Time is relative, kid. You’ll see. A couple of days is nothing. A year is a blink.”
Sam brought over a steaming cup of tea. Dean frowned at it. “Just try it, Dean,” Sam said.
“Have you seen the news today?” Charlie’s voice chirped.
“Heard it from somebody smart today,” Bobby grumbled. “Come on in. We’ve got beer and food.”
“Relax,” Charlie said. “I’ll keep an eye on him.”
Dean’s stomach churned. He nodded. He went into Charlie’s closet and found it, ignoring everything else. He couldn’t afford it. Focus on the task at hand, not the Harry Potter poster she’d bought the night the last movie came out. Empty the suitcase and ignore the D&D pieces that fell onto the floor, pieces Dean and Sam had given her. Carry the suitcase to the hall. That was all he could handle--
“I’d fucking love to go on a date with you,” Dean said.
“More like a five-year-old crazy,” Dean mumbled.
Dean blamed the bees. He’d always blame the bees, he decided, toasting the thought with more whiskey. He’d always worn that damn trenchcoat. And more layers under it. So seeing the body of the angel he thought he knew covered only in bees, well...it surprised him, to say the least. He knew the guy was strong, but he thought it was part of the angel juice. Dean didn’t realize how fit he was. And it was only on quiet nights, when Sammy wasn’t around and when there wasn’t anything else to distract him, that he remembered how much he’d
Dean suddenly wanted to punch him. He’d never hated the word
“What a strange saying,” Cas said quietly.
Dean snorted, shook his head, and couldn’t seem to stop shaking it. He opened the motel room door. “I don’t know, man.” He remembered the guilty look on Sam’s face. “Are you?”
Dean finally brought his face out of his hands, letting Charlie look at him. He couldn’t say what he was feeling. Hell--he barely knew the words for what he was feeling. This wasn’t him. These nerves, this desire to check and fix his hair? The butterflies that were going ham in his stomach? This wasn’t Dean Winchester. This was chick flick bullshit.
, Dean realized. “You’ve finally gotten your head out of your ass.”
Dean let himself laugh a little. It felt good--weird, but good. “Yeah. I’m glad Sammy’s okay.”
His phone buzzed in his pocket. “We’re not done,” he said, pointing at Chet. The monster’s smirk grew. Dean turned back to Sam and Bobby, pulling his phone to his ear. “Yeah?”
She started walking, leading the way deeper into the woods. “I’ve been around awhile. I figured out how to tune into the more powerful magical and holy forces in this world a long time ago. I felt every seal break.” She shrugged. “I managed to keep a few closed, but the odds were against us. I knew when the last one broke, when Lucifer was released.”
threatening Bobby, but he wasn’t
Cas squeezed her before letting her go. “You too. I--we--can’t thank you enough.”
Bobby was waiting for them. He was standing next to a funeral pyre, holding a sheet. A pile of ropes rested at his feet, a silent reminder. His face was stony. None of the three men were strangers to death, strangers to losing loved ones. To losing family.
“Cas?” Sam asked.
Sam tapped his head. “A broken leg is a lot easier to patch up than a wall put up by Death.”
“I can put them back on,” Cas offered.
?” he choked out.
loose cannon,” Sam reminded him. Something soft warmed up in Dean’s chest. Cas was family to all of them.
“There they are,” Sam said. He grinned. “Ready to be the hero? Play Prince Charming?”
The ride to Portland was uneventful until Sam decided to talk feelings.
“Who’s the mystery power source lady?”
“You knew it was a mistake, though,” Dean said in a tight voice. Anger was rising to the top of the swirling storm inside of him. “I told you it was a mistake. We told you it was a mistake. And you went and busted open the damn door to purgatory anyway.”
“Are you the one who’s been protecting the forest?” Sam asked.
“Exactly. Now, this email,” Sam said, spinning the laptop around, “makes it sound like they’ll start actually serving it in restaurants in a month or so.”
Dean just blinked.
And there was the crack in Dean’s voice. There was the sign that the older Winchester had had enough--enough loss, pain, grief. They’d both had enough. Dean looked back at Sam, who was startled by just how much pain was in his big brother’s green eyes. “If Cas is really back, why the hell hasn’t he found us? Why the hell hasn’t he reached out?”
“What’s the rush?” Bobby asked.
Cas turned his sun-bright smile to Sam. “Sam!”
Dean held up his hands. “What the hell was the point of getting these if we’re gonna be stuck here anyway?”
As he filled up the glass, Dean tried to remember how he felt about Lisa and Carrie. Sex with them was fun, sure. He’d loved them. But compared to how he felt about Cas? Those feelings were small campfires, contained by the borders of a fire pit. His feelings about Cas were a bonfire, wild and raging.
“Gotta be more specific than that, kid,” Bobby said. “There’s been a lot of ‘I can’t quite believe it’ shit going down lately.”
Bobby just waved him away, already engrossed in his book.
“Dean, take a breath,” Bobby told him.
“It’s okay, buddy,” he said. He squeezed Cas’ hand once more before letting go. Cas slowly, hesitantly went over.
“And Cas is alive?” Sam asked, finally meeting Dean’s eyes.
Dean frowned. “So?” He gave him his standard “the fuck?” expression before his eyes went back to the road.
Bobby rattled off the address, and Dean mentally mapped the route. He didn’t know Colorado as well as South Dakota or Nebraska, but he knew it well enough.
“Dean?” Cas’ voice drifted from the living room.
Dean snorted. “Took me axe throwing. Wouldn’t leave me alone until I talked. Convinced Gabriel to send me a dream that opened up a whole can of worms.”
“So I’m dead?” Dean asked in the same small voice. There was a knot in his throat. He tried to clear it. No such luck.
Bobby looked pissed, but Dean had a feeling it had more to do with the two $20 bills he was handing over to Sam than anything else. “You idjits finally got your heads outta your asses?” he asked gruffly.
“Where the hell is he?”
Charlie winked at Cas. “See you later.” She disappeared with a rush of wings.
Dean threw up his hands, thrilled at how frustrated Sam was. The best part of teasing Sam was his reaction. The more sensitive he was, the more he liked the girl.
Dean swallowed. His heart hadn’t slowed down in the slightest. “Fine.”
“If I’m gonna talk, I’m gonna yell,” Dean admitted. “And if you don’t want me to yell, I’ll need whiskey.”
“It’s national bee day, Sammy.” Dean wouldn’t meet his brother’s eyes. “National bee day.”
Dean’s phone rang just before his coffee ran out. He pulled it out of his pocket and instantly put it on speakerphone. “Bobby. Hey.”
Cas’ eyes studied his face, his eyes. That damn pull, that tension, was still there. Dean wondered what would happen if he just leaned forward, just let their own personal gravity field pull him in--
“It’s great,” Dean said. “Bobby and Jody are fine--maybe even better than fine.”
“Only if the survivors can still think independently when they leave their hospitals,” Bobby said. “Looks like they’re working on something that’ll shut our brains down. Make us mindless, highly suggestible. Humans will be lambs going to the slaughter.”
Dean’s eyebrows scrunched together. “Dick Roman? The sons of bitches could’ve gone with almost any leader, and they picked a guy named
Dean knocked on the door. “Sammy?” No response. Dean had figured as much. “Hope you’re decent,” he called loudly before opening the door.
He started on Cas’ suit jacket buttons.
“You can do this,” said Charlie’s soft voice.
“Or we tell him in person.” Sam shrugged. “We’re not far, anyway.”
Sam walked back into the kitchen, looking more than a little disoriented.
“She’s a good one. And technically, I’m not even sure how much of her power she used.” Charlie waved the thought away. “Doesn’t matter. More importantly: axe-throwing range. Life chat. Yes or no?”
Dean forced down his impatience. “Okay.”
It was a friendly, courteous handshake. But that was all. Cas let go, and Dean suddenly felt cold. He clenched his jaw.
Except he was talking to Sam, who didn’t know when to stop. “I’m just trying to help,” he said in a tone that was sincere enough that Dean couldn’t fight him.
“Think you’ve got a strong enough emotional connection to it to tether yourself to it?”
Cas had to close his eyes and take another deep breath to make his next point. “Dean loves women.”
There were people who loved men and women. Cas had watched them for millennia. They weren’t as common, and they often had to hide, but they existed. What was the word? Bisexual. He unconsciously took a sharp breath in.
“Dean. Thank God,” Charlie said in an exhausted and irritable voice. “You’re gonna want to hold onto him. He has the attention span of a toddler.”
Cas dropped his eyes. “I was a bit...overzealous as God. Humans and angels suffered similar fates.” His voice ached with remorse.
Elle’s eyes lit up, and she beamed. “Thought so.”
Sam’s eyes sparkled with something--mischief. “Speaking of angels--”
By the time they reached Bobby’s, Dean was
Charlie had told him. Fine. “I know,” he said. “Just...give me a minute. Or a week. Okay?”
“Stay put.” Dean could almost imagine Cas nodding. “Okay.” There was a pause before a gasp. “But the cherry blossoms are blooming! The bees will--”
“Which is how Missouri heard about you,” Bobby added, “and how we heard about you.”
Dean took a deep breath, trying desperately to clear his head and not get lost in the closeness of Cas, the look in the angel’s eyes. “Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.”
Cas hesitated in front of Bobby. “C’mere, you idjit,” Bobby said, hugging the angel quickly but fiercely. “Good to have you back.”
Dean wanted to close the distance between them, but he couldn’t bring himself to. Feelings were still swirling in him like a storm, and he had no clue how to handle them. There was an unusually bright and happy one surfacing. What was it?
“Yeah, we’re not sure how he managed it, either.”
Cas stared at the forest floor. How could he even begin to explain this? Was Charlie the right person to tell? “You understand the difference between being an angel and a human. Yes?”
Cas’ eyes went distant again. Lost. Dean was suddenly reminded of their earlier conversation. “They’ll be okay, Cas.”
Dean’s shoulders relaxed. He had no idea how badly he’d needed to hear that before she said it. “Glad you think that.” He threw another axe. “Not sure Bobby and Sam will agree.”
Dean frowned again. “Why the hell would I do that?”
Dean knew the answer. He heard it in Cas’ completely wrecked tone. He knew it from the way Cas had just kissed him stupid. Again. “Yes?”
Dean did some mental math. “Charlie, that’s almost 18 hours away. You can’t drive that in a day.”
.” His voice was dripping with venom by the “fine,” and a small part of him wanted to take it back. Cas didn’t need this, but Dean was beyond overwhelmed.
Cas looked up at Sam, who was beaming, before wrapping his arms around Dean, hesitantly at first. But when Dean didn’t pull away or let go, the angel held him more tightly. And Dean felt, for the first time since he’d thought Cas had died, the broken pieces inside of him slowly come back together.
“No.”
“That’s part of it, yes.” Cas paused.
“Letting go of the hurt,” she said. “Recognizing that someone fucked up, but letting the anger and pain from it go.”
Shit. When was the last time he’d showered? His scattered, tired brain tried to figure it out. Too long ago, he decided. He’d shower, then handle Sam. Then the Leviathan. In that order.
Cas slipped under the covers without hesitation. He pulled Dean towards him. Dean went with it and fell onto Cas’ chest, his arm draping over the angel. “Is this okay?” Cas asked quietly.
“Yeah, but we’re not all in love with that friggin’ angel,” Bobby said.
The older hunter’s eyes went from one eager face to the other. “None of your damn business. Elle have any news?”
Before Sam’s judgy face turned into judgy words, Bobby came in. “I’ve got grub and liquor.”
“Do you wanna say a few words?” Sam asked quietly.
God--just thinking the angel’s name sparked a bonfire of emotions Dean felt to his toes. Their friendship--relationship was probably a better word, truth be told--was like nothing Dean had ever felt. The way Cas had stuck around over the years certainly had had an impact on that intensity. Not everyone came back from the dead. Or came back to the Winchesters. To Dean, specifically.
Cas took a breath, closed his eyes, and turned his attention inward. Feelings and memories of feelings rose to the surface of his mind, as if they’d been simmering under the surface just waiting to be uncovered. The twitch in his stomach, the tension in his chest. The way his body felt like it was buzzing, vibrating to some unknown frequency. Feelings he didn’t fully understand but had come to associate with Dean. Whatever they were, those feelings...they’d been with him since he first pulled Dean from hell. And they were growing stronger every day.
“He’s being sincere this time. Trust me. Dean Winchester can fake a lot of things. But forgiveness?” She shook her head. “That is one thing he doesn’t dish out easily, and it’s one of the few things I’ve never heard him lie about.”
Elle’s hands began to glow red. Her eyebrows squeezed together. Her hands grew brighter and brighter until she bowed her head. The glow faded until her hands were back to normal. She opened her eyes and exhaled heavily. “Holy hell in a handbasket.” Her eyes flicked up to Sam’s. “How long were you dealing with this? Before Cas took it?”
“You couldn’t see it?” Dean asked.
Dean shook his head. Grief was rising like a tide in his chest. Cas was gone. “No, Sam. He’s not.”
Dean’s heart broke. “C’mere, you idiot,” he grumbled and hugged Cas, letting his arms relax and mold around him. Cas froze for a beat before holding Dean back. They’d hugged a few times recently, but this was different. Cas held him with a warmth Dean had last felt...never. And as Cas held him, Dean relaxed, sinking into the angel’s embrace just a little. It was an almost imperceptible shift, but it was there. And Cas just kept holding him as the pieces of Dean’s broken heart slowly came back together.
“Son of a bitch
Her eyes darkened with sadness. “I’ll come back, but I don’t know about Sammy or Bobby. Probably not yet.” She kissed his forehead. “Don’t panic. Love you.”
“Coffee’s ready.” Bobby’s eyes were keen and
Dean glared at her. “No.”
Her eyes grew warm. “I got it. This time.”
Sam shrugged. “Dunno. Trust, me, man, if there were a way out of this, I’d take it. But Elle thinks she can get this alpha’s blood without risking any lives. Which is worth it to me.” He made a face again. “Where the hell am I gonna find a tux?”
Cas took yet another deep breath. He was in love with Dean. Fine. Could
Charlie gave his shoulder a reassuring squeeze. “You’ll feel better after coffee. And breakfast.”
Dean shrugged. “I’ll go with burying them. It’s worked just fine so far.”
“Faking what?” Dean asked.
Cas gave him a small, warm smile he
Sam smiled, but his eyebrows pressed together. “Who are you and what have you done with my brother?”
“It’s different for everyone,” Dean tried to explain. They were dancing around the truth that had kicked his heart into overdrive, the truth he had barely come to acknowledge. The truth that scared the
He was wrong before.
“Yeah, and we gave him three.”
Sam spoke first, breaking the silence that Charlie had left in her wake. “Is that your first cup of coffee?” He jerked his chin at his brother.
Cas’ hand rose a few inches, then fell. “I...I just do. I know you’d never hurt me if you could help it. And neither would Elle.” Some of Dean’s hesitation must have stayed on his face, because Cas added, “Trust me,” in a low and earnest tone.
Charlie just grinned. “I know.”
should be destroyed. Charlie was gone, and the world should react accordingly.
“You sure about this?” Sam asked his brother. His brow was furrowed. It was gonna get stuck that way some day, Dean thought idly.
Dean pursed his lips, watching Cas’ eyes fall to them and feeling powerful as hell.
Cas dropped his hands and backed away. “How can I help?”
“Hey, buddy,” Sam said, smiling back. “Glad you didn’t end up playing with that holy fire.”
“Breakfast!” a cheery female voice called.
“They’re family,” Dean finished. When Cas still looked lost and afraid, Dean took a step closer and continued. “That’s what you are, man. You’re family.”
“I’ll deal with the bodies,” Bobby said. Dean nodded his thanks and walked away, finding his flask and chugging the rest of the whiskey in it.
Cas’ eyes dropped. “There’s...something I think you should know. About me.”
Elle nodded, pressing her fingertips to her temples. “I might have a headache that’ll last way too long, but yeah, it really worked.”
“Sam--” Dean started.
“Black Rock shouldn’t count,” Dean said.
Dean frowned and opened his mouth to fight back, but before he could say anything, Sam nodded towards the house. Dean spun around and saw the angel—his angel. “Cas?” he asked. God, he hated how hesitant his voice was, but he couldn’t help it. A tiny part of him wondered if this was real.
Dean had to lean against the kitchen counter. His knees had gone weak with the pressure of his realizations: he was bisexual. He was capable of falling in love and wanting to have sex with men and women. And in this moment, he was in love with Cas. Probably had been all along, truth be told. And he wanted to sleep with Cas. Considering all the times he’d stared at Cas’ lips instead of those incredible blue eyes, he’d probably wanted that for a long time, too.
“She made it a game,” Frank said in a wondering tone. He grinned and cracked his knuckles. “Okay, sweetheart. Let’s see what you got.”
“Option one,” said a terrified male voice--the other werewolf.
Cas froze, and Dean panicked. Rejection knocked the wind out of him. He’d misread everything. This was stupid--no, beyond stupid. This was insane. He backed away and released the angel’s hand. “Shit, Cas, I’m--”
Sam let Dean drive for a full half an hour before talking. “So.”
Dean suddenly couldn’t speak. There was a lump in his throat. He tried to swallow past it, but then his vision blurred. Tears. Goddamn tears. For a change, he let them fall. He shook his head.
“Uh huh.” Dean leaned back and studied his brother. “So what’s with the face?”
Shame clawed at Dean’s throat.
They pulled up in front of a beautiful Tudor-style home. Dean stepped out of the car and reached in the back seat for the angel blade.
made,” Dean grumbled. He threw the axe. It hit the edge of the target with a satisfying
“Side effects of being stuck in the cage with Lucifer and Michael for over a year,” Sam clarified.
am I gonna
Dean glared at Sam. “One is too many.”
“You’re welcome,” Cas said. The words came out awkward, which somehow made them even more endearing.
She ignored him. “You’re pissed at him. I mean, really, really pissed at him. More than that one time I stole Baby.”
“I did help them!” the angel yelled. “I fought my big brother for them. I fought freaking Lucifer and had to fake my own damn death just to survive.”
“Biggerson’s?” Dean asked.
She shot him that damn impish grin. “Gotta go! Talk soon!” And with a soft rush of wings, she was gone.
“Thanks,” Dean told him. He went up the stairs, his worry growing stronger with every step. Sam had been unstable before. Would he even wake up at all? Who would he be if he did wake up?
“Dean,” Cas said.
Dean’s lips curled up at the corners in just a hint of a smile. Sam always knew how to make him laugh, even--hell, maybe especially--when he didn’t want to.
“Honey whiskey,” Dean mumbled. “Honey and bees and...friggin’ angels, man.” He took a swig of whiskey right from the bottle. “See you tomorrow, Sammy.”
Shit. He’d have to come out to Sam and Bobby. “Shit,” he said out loud. He did his best to shake it off, shower, and finish packing.
Dean couldn’t explain it. He couldn’t tell Bobby how his nerves were making him feel like he was facing a pack of werewolves. Or how he felt like a runner at the starting line, waiting for the gun to go off and the race to begin. So he just shrugged instead. “No real reason. Just want to get this over with.”
Gabe clapped Dean on the shoulder. “You’re gonna need it. You’re all gonna need it. Remember how Cas got his memory back by saving you?”
“Charlie,” Dean said.
Bobby waved it away. “Save it. I know you are.”
“And I’ve got an angel to find,” Charlie said. She gave them a mock salute. “Later, bitches.” And she was gone.
laptop.”
“The obnoxiously hyper but adorable little redhead who’s been babysitting you.” Dean gave Cas an odd look. Cas and Charlie had worked together when she was alive.
Dean got out of bed and slowly, carefully, walked towards her. “We gave you a hunter’s funeral.”
“With Elle’s help, yeah. We made it work.” She grinned. “Turns out Gabriel hates that ‘Baby Shark’ song.” She cocked her head. “You don’t remember? I thought you were around when I explained this.”
“If you wanna date Cas, you’ll have to tell them.”
“Probably knows we’d kill him if he showed up.”
Sam smiled. That was enough. If Dean had packed the trenchcoat, he was at least almost ready to welcome Cas back into the family. And almost ready was good enough.
“You seem better,” Bobby said.
Dean flipped his brother off before walking away. “Not trying to impress anyone, Sammy. That’s what the Fed suits are for.”
“I’m just...trying to figure out how your memory came back. If it was...you know…” Jesus. Dean was horrible at this. He wanted another drink but didn’t trust himself to be truly drunk around Cas.
“Something...happened to me when I was brought back this time. Or maybe it’s from being Emmanuel. I don’t know.” Cas’ tone was hesitant, worried. This was hard for him.
“Do you have any idea what you’re doing, kid?” Dean asked.
“I know,” Sam said.
“You went to a farmers’ market?” Bobby asked.
“Connected to healing you?”
“Damn. Good for him.” Sam walked over to the desk and pulled out his laptop. “Gotta figure out where the hell I can rent a tux that’ll actually friggin’ fit.”
“And you should rest,” she told them. “Cas is tired, too.”
Sam met his eyes carefully, the laughter fading from his face. “You okay?”
“Ok.” Bobby took a deep breath. “Ok, then. Don’t do anything dumb on the way, but don’t take your time.”
Dean kissed Cas’ hand. “We live together. They’ll figure it out. And I don’t want to hide you.” Dean laughed at himself. “I’m scared shitless, but that don’t mean I want to hide this.”
“Hello, Sam,” Cas said.
“I’ve got angel mojo,” Charlie said. She waved at him to continue. “Keep talking.”
“Sup, bitches?” Charlie was leaning against the counter.
“It’s certainly possible. Probable, even,” Cas said. “Elle might have the answer.”
Dean forced himself to speak. “We better hurry. Get out of here before rush hour or we’re screwed.”
“What’s up?” Dean asked, walking over. Cas couldn’t help admiring both of them. They were beautiful. So different in so many ways, but beautiful. Of course, he had different feelings about Dean’s beauty than Sam’s, but--
“I, um.” Dean licked his lips nervously.
He scampered off. Sam gave his brother a wide-eyed, slightly scared look. “Should we go?” he mouthed.
Dean struggled to find words for the feelings wrestling in his chest. “No,” he said simply.
Frank was, for the first time since they’d met him, speechless. His jaw had dropped like a cartoon character, and it stayed down as he gestured for Charlie to type in her passwords.
“I know, Dean,” Cas said, that too-easy smile still on his face. “I trust you. And I trust Elle. We’ll be fine.”
“Dude, none of us should have Find Your Phone or Friends or whatever turned on. If the wrong people could track us--”
“Keep in mind,” Charlie said in the same gentle voice, “he knows you. He’s seen you on plenty of early mornings pre-coffee.”
Charlie beamed. “I have an alternative.”
Bobby’s gruff comment broke a comfortable silence. “You said we’d give him two hours.”
“Technically, I pulled both of them out of hell,” Cas said.
“You also haven’t lost two important people while your brother’s seein’ his old bunkmate before.” Bobby’s expression was somewhere between mad and awkward, and it broke Dean’s defenses a little. He was trying. Bobby didn’t talk about feelings. Ever. But he was genuinely trying. So Dean took a breath.
“Okay, kid,” she said. “Are you gonna run back to your pack and tell them to stay the hell away from my woods? Or do I have to kill you, too?”
. He wanted whiskey.
“Then can we treat it differently?” Cas asked. The fear was starting to fade.
of it,” Sam said with a light half-laugh. “Charlie being a ghost. All the Leviathan stuff on her laptop. Cas being alive.”
“Cas is family.”
Dean nodded, but the pained look didn’t leave his face. “He wasn’t even around to help us save--” Dean turned his face to the side. Sam watched his shoulders rise and fall. Deep inhale, deep exhale.
“The Winchester killing spree has come to a violent end in Iowa,” the reporter said.
“Or,” Sam said, spinning his phone in his hand idly.
“Maybe it doesn’t have the juice. Or doesn’t care.”
Elle frowned.
Sam’s slightly sheepish look gave them away.
She squeezed his arm reassuringly before letting go. “Come on. Let’s throw some shit.”
“Of course not,” Sam said. “The Leviathans can apparently copy someone if they have your DNA. They got it from a motel shower drain.”
“And now he’s crazy,” Sam finished. He sighed heavily and ran a hand down his face. “Yeah.” He shook his head. “Bobby, how are we gonna do this? How can we go back to hunting Leviathans like everything’s fine? Dean’s probably past his breaking point, and--”
Cas was alive.
All three of them jumped back a little. “Jesus, kid. Can’t you warn us or something?” Dean said a little more harshly than he meant to. His nerves were frayed, and from the judgy look Charlie gave him, she could tell.
Dean’s jaw dropped. “Cas...you’re nothing like them. This is nothing like that. At all.”
“Never said I wasn’t gonna sleep,” Dean said. He ran his free hand up Cas’ arm when they reached the top of the stairs. “Just not right away.” He kissed Cas, who was surprisingly hesitant at first. Dean tried to focus this time and not just get caught up in, well, everything.
Cas. He’d never let himself feel just how badly he’d missed him. But with the angel sitting in front of him, it came into sharp relief.
Bobby chuckled humorlessly. “Yeah. Forgot who I was talking to.” He and Sam exchanged small, knowing smiles--the kind of easy ones that go between family.
Dean checked. “No. Dammit.”
Dean groaned again. “I need coffee.”
The last thought brought Dean back to full consciousness. Cas was back. Really, truly, fully back. Not around-but-crazy, not around-but-lying-the-whole-damn-time. Cas, the angel he’d known for years, was back.
He squeezed his eyes closed. He needed another minute to process.
“Like what?”
Dean nodded. “Yeah.”
“Hey there, boys,” said a familiar female voice. Jody walked out and smiled at them, giving Sam and then Dean a hug. “Who’d you pick up?”
Dean instantly relaxed.
. I can’t even drive my friggin’ car, man!” He exhaled heavily. “And I can’t even yell at you in person. I can’t even fucking tell you how fucking pissed off I am, or how much…” His voice broke. Tears threatened. “Charlie
They heard the door open. “Oh, fresh coffee. Thank God. Dean?” Sam called.
“We know you do, kid,” Bobby said.
Why now? If it wasn’t Cas…
A few hours later, Dean slowly closed his laptop. It was an exaggerated and mournful motion. It made Sam think of a casket going into the ground, and it worried him. “Dean?” he asked.
Bobby’s eyebrows went up. “How did you--”
Cas pulled away just enough to look into Dean’s beautiful green eyes. “I...I thought you’d be mad at me.”
“Hmm.” Bobby crossed his arms. “Shouldn’t be more than a few days. If it’s longer than a week, better send out a search party.” He paused just before leaving. Cleared his throat. “I’m, uh, really glad you two finally...well, you know.” He left.
Cas’ shoulders relaxed. “Good night, Dean.”
He was in a house--a
“Can we help with that?” Sam asked Elle, gesturing at the hourglass.
“We can do that,” Dean said. He felt suddenly protective. Cas and Sam were his people. He wanted to protect them.
“He cracked your piñata, Sam. And he brought the frigging Leviathans.”
“Just one? It can’t be that easy, Bobby,” Dean said.
Sam laughed with him. “The real question is why you didn’t figure it out sooner.”
Dean looked at Sam, who was equally confused. Bobby knew exactly when they’d met Charlie.
Sam snorted but stayed focused on Charlie’s laptop.
Dean knelt in front of Cas’ chair, putting himself on eye level with the angel. “We’re gonna go, okay, buddy? But we’ll be back as soon as we can.”
“Damn,” she said eventually. “You’re made of tough stuff, Winchester.” She pursed her lips. “Or maybe you grew into it.”
“How did this even happen?” Bobby asked. “Didn’t think anyone but God could make angels.”
“Yeah, well, you did a piss-poor job of it,” Dean grumbled.
Cas smiled lightly. “Okay. It should be ready by now.”
“Give me five minutes with the clippers and your friggin’ hair would stop falling in your face,” Dean muttered under his breath.
“I--”
Covered
“So, we’re about to see Cas.”
Dean propped himself up on his elbow and kissed Cas quickly and gently. “It was awesome. It is awesome.
Charlie woke up to the smell of pine needles and hot chocolate. She enjoyed a beautiful,
Charlie sighed and looked down. “I can only imagine. That sounds horrible.”
“Or whoever.” Dean exhaled heavily. “I’m sorry, man. I’ve been running off with Charlie too much. Should’ve been there for you.”
“Hello, Dean.”
Maybe it was Dean’s imagination. Maybe Sam did actually go pale in the faint fluorescent light from the street lamp. But something had clearly changed his mind. “Let’s go. We’ll keep calling.”
“You son of a bitch,” he muttered, lighting the candle that was still on the mantle. It flickered at first, struggling to light. He wondered if that’s how Charlie had felt earlier that day--struggling to help, to stay present, to not get called away by whatever power took her from them.
“She made some good points,” Dean said. “And suggested the axe-throwing range.”
She smiled. “Okay.” She started walking, but she let Cas enjoy the quiet first. After the chaos that had been reigning in his head, he appreciated the quiet more than he could say. He needed the sounds of the forest: the wind in the trees, the soft crunch of leaves and sticks under their feet.
“Fifteen,” Sam mumbled, opening the water bottle. “That’s a new record.”
Dean’s eyebrows and jaw moved in opposite directions. “How…”
“Don’t worry about it, Cas,” Charlie said as she poured a cup of coffee and handed it to Dean.
Dean waved at the line of cars in the driveway. “We don’t know who’s an angel, a human, a demon--”
“Seems like you know a lot of people,” Sam noted, drinking his hot toddy.
Sam was going to need help. Incredibly powerful help. Dean had no idea who they could call on to put his brother together again, but there had to be someone. Or something.
Charlie shook her head. “None.”
Dean frowned at it. “Edgar. We think he’s one of the higher-ups.” He studied Cas. “I thought you knew who he was?”
Dean saw Sam out of the corner of his eye, biting his lip as he tried not to laugh. “We’ll get to that later.” He clapped a hand on the angel’s strong shoulder. “Let’s get home first.”
. Dean had been all over the country and seen a lot of beautiful women, but in that moment he would’ve sworn on anything that Cas’ eyes were the prettiest thing he’d ever seen. “I’m afraid not,” Cas said. “They were quite guarded. I only heard them trying to control me. Calling my name. Trying to catch me off guard so they could take over.” Cas’ blue eyes became distant, tinged with pain. “Until they did take over.”
“Tux rentals,” Dean explained. “What’s Garth after?”
“Give me fifteen minutes,” Sam said, chugging the rest of his coffee. “Be right back.”
Dean rolled his eyes and neck, but he listened. “Yeah,” he said, slowly nodding. “Yeah. I’m okay. Better, at least.” He ruffled her hair. “Thanks, kid.”
Charlie wrapped her arms around him, and he relaxed, hugging her back. “You’re welcome. Happy to do my job.”
chill.”
“Is that Charlie?” Sam asked. “Or is Jody visiting again?”
. You weren’t kidding about Cas’ crazy. I can feel it from here.”
Dean frowned. “Huh. Makes sense. Doesn’t sound like you.”
Sam raised an eyebrow. “Uh huh. Sure.”
Dean shook his head at her, but he smiled, too. Charlie was the only person who could ever get away with saying shit like that. Mostly because there was no heat behind it, but also because she was right.
Cas stared into his eyes, and--not for the first time--Dean felt like the angel was looking into his soul. “No. I didn’t just want freedom. But I think you know that.”
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean said roughly. “Would a half an hour give you enough time to primp and preen, princess?”
“Not so fast,” Frank interrupted. Dean started a little--he’d forgotten Frank was there. “You two still need new headshots and credit cards, right? I’d say you need to toss the golden child’s laptop, but she’s made it nearly untraceable.” Frank shook his head in admiration before looking up at Sam. “Yours, on the other hand…”
“Nope.”
For the first time in a very, very long time, Dean let himself be really, truly held. His arms slowly wrapped around Cas, pulling the angel close.
“I don’t give a damn how many energy drinks you have. We’ll meet you in the middle.”
“And Cas is…”
Gabriel studied her for a few more intense seconds. “If we send you down as a ghost, you’ll probably get lost in the void. Casting souls out of heaven gets messy unless they’re beelining for hell.” He walked to her childhood bookshelf, idly running his hands over the
Bobby looked at the article again. “Maybe doing a normal job would be good for him.”
Shit. So much for not sappy. But Cas squeezed his hand again. He beamed at Dean, smiling so big that his nose scrunched up and his gums showed. Cas was practically glowing.
“I didn’t,” Cas said, his smile dropping into a frown. “I hope the bees are okay.”
Dean had no idea how much he’d needed to hear that until his eyes threatened to brim over. Tears? Again?
“A what?” Bobby asked.
. Cas had been powerful, sure. But this guy? She had a feeling he could mess with her brain and leave her drooling for eternity in seconds and not even get tired from doing it.
Bi. Two little letters making a one-syllable word had never been so powerful.
Dean, who had been doing the same, promptly dropped the bullets. His heart started racing.
“You sure about that?” Dean asked, his voice and muscles tense.
“Cas is Castiel, right?” Sam and Dean looked at each other in surprise before nodding. She smiled. “He’s a good one. Bit of an odd duck, but a really, really good one.”
No. Whiskey. He’d always had whiskey. Whiskey tonight and a job tomorrow.
Cas gave him a head tilt.
“Because it’s my fault, Dean,” Sam said. “Cas has been missing and crazy and it’s my damn fault. If I’d just been able to handle the crazy--if we’d known that I could
Charlie pursed her lips. “Kind of both. Sometimes people--like yours truly--try to convince themselves they’re bi or genuinely think they’re bi before coming out as gay. Sometimes people realize that they genuinely are attracted to both men and women.”
Dean looked at his little brother like he’d grown an extra head. “Seriously?”
in his angel’s arms. The kiss continued, and time lost all meaning.
“No,” Bobby said firmly. “We all need some shut-eye. See you boys in the morning.”
Sam laughed lightly. “You’ve seen it too, then?”
“Sam,” Cas said, standing unsteadily.
“You wanna tell us why you’re so antsy? Share with the class?” Bobby asked.
Gabriel leaned against the wall. “I’m listening.”
Sam’s eyebrows went up in surprise. Dean could read his brother’s thoughts just from those eyebrows.
eggs,
Sam tied the ropes around her body. Her still, lifeless body. Jesus, that was wrong too. She shouldn’t be dead. Charlie was too young and fiery and kind and good to be dead. But everyone--all the angels and demons and hunters--knew full well that didn’t matter. Death didn’t discriminate.
Cas’ eyes were still filled with questions, but now wonder joined them. “You really forgive me, don’t you?”
Fear verging on terror rushed through Dean, joined by a jolt of adrenaline so strong he almost started to run. “We gotta find him. Now.”
“Borax?” Dean asked.
Dean woke up slowly, sensation returning to each of his limbs in bits and pieces. His legs were tangled up with someone else’s. His cheek was resting on a solid, firm chest.
Dean grumbled but listened. Sam stood up straight, giving himself an extra inch or so of height that he used to look over the crowd. “See anything interesting?” Dean asked.
, just maybe, have.
Dean frowned. That didn’t help him at all.
idea what you’ve done? The mess you’ve made that we’ve been cleaning up?”
“That can handle over a hundred years in hell?” Sam asked.
Dean frowned.
“Her library seemed pretty extensive,” Cas commented.
Dean ran one hand over his hair, licked his lips. This wasn’t a normal conversation. But he wanted to give Cas the truth, no matter the cost. “Not usually, and not well. Charlie being around has helped. She’s forced me to talk through some shit.”
“Well, it overlaps with the Leviathans,” Bobby said. “Remember that town in Oregon? The one where they’re trying to buy up everything?”
“Dean, what’ll you do if it stops being manageable?” Sam asked. Dean heard the same kind of soul-deep tiredness in his brother’s voice that he’d felt just the day before. “You can’t cure me. If Cas were around--”
“That was dangerous and stupid and…” Dean’s jaw dropped a little. “What’s with all the bees?”
“Good news,” Dean said. “So why the face?”
His dad had always encouraged him to be a man, and to be a man meant being manly. Strong. Listening to classic rock. Getting with beautiful women. Saving people. Hunting things. Granted, he could do most of those things and still be bi.
“Dude, it’s not gonna grow wings and fly away,” Dean said.
“They’re fine with me being gay, right?” She waved for him to follow her as she walked towards their target. They’d run out of axes.
Sam smirked. “Their headquarters. Richard Roman Enterprises. Run by Dick Roman.”
Dean ran a hand down his face, trying desperately to keep the terror churning in his stomach contained.
react, assuming they could fix him?
She grinned. “I think you have some more chats coming.”
Dean laughed--really, really laughed. “Pretty batshit, huh?
Cas glanced at Dean, and Dean saw something new in Cas’ eyes. Fear. Just a little flicker of fear. Cas was afraid of this--of closeness, of family, of love. Dean knew that reaction as well as he knew his own damn reflection. And just like that, his heart broke for Cas. The urge to somehow comfort the angel was almost overwhelming. But what was he gonna do? Hug him? He hadn’t had nearly enough coffee yet for this.
Dean and Sam rolled their eyes in unison. “I mean it,” Bobby said. He and Jody left. And then the Winchesters and their fallen angel were alone.
“And she’s been bugging you a lot.”
“Did they…” Bobby took a breath, stared at his coffee mug, and went to the liquor cabinet. Dean didn’t bother trying to hide his raised eyebrows. “You know it was Leviathan that got her?”
Sam and Bobby looked at each other. Some sort of silent agreement passed between them, and they nodded. “Fair enough,” Bobby said. But something in his tone made Dean doubt he meant it. He knew Bobby and his brother too well to bother pressing the point, though. They’d let him in on whatever they were hiding soon enough. Or he’d dig until he found it.
When he was out of earshot, Dean asked Bobby, “He’s okay?”
Cas’ eyes darted down to them, lingering there. Fucking hell. They lingered.
Dean glanced at the newspaper. The words swam a little. “Dammit,” he muttered, going back to his coffee. Caffeine.
“Dean! Cas!”
“Yeah.”
Dean groaned and got out of the car. “I’ll get the grub. You get the gas.”
Sam flipped him off as he pulled out his phone and walked outside.
Bobby’s expression confirmed it. “Morning, sleeping beauty.”
Charlie made a thoughtful “hmm” sound. “Kind of like your angel family?”
“Or a happy drunk crazy.”
“Charlie and her angel buddy.”
Dean peeked out at her, parting his fingers. “Everything go okay with Gabriel?”
Dean caught his hand. “Or.”
“Dean?”
“Wow.” Sam smiled and laughed a little. “Who are you and what have you done with my brother?”
>>Close enough to hack, far enough to see them coming
“Yeah.” He tapped his head lightly. “Don’t want to push it.”
There had to be.
“Don’t say ‘yeah okay’ like ‘yeah okay,” Dean griped. “I’m trying here, man.”
to kill them.” He met Cas’ eyes for the first time that morning. “Did they give you any clues on that while they were setting up camp inside you?”
His eyes opened. Cas was in a T-shirt and boxers, and he looked
“Shut up,” Sam said reflexively, but there was no real heat behind it. “She’s powerful. She’s seen a lot of fights and helped out in the background, apparently. She already knew who Dean and me were.”
Gabe ignored that. “So get your head out of your ass, get your shit together, and get your angel. Got it?”
Sam ran a hand down his face. “Ok. Fine. Guess there’s no point in being mad.”
Cas nodded. “Right. She found me, got me clothes, told her church about me when we realized I could heal people.”
“I don’t think they’re interested in a peace treaty,” Dean said. “Killing ‘em is our best shot. If we can just figure out
“Shut up. Trying to ask if your melon’s okay, is all.”
But, of course, it had barely reacted when he and Sam stopped the damn apocalypse. He shouldn’t be surprised.
Charlie raised one eyebrow. There was no criticism in her eyes--just a question. “Are you sure about that?”
Surprisingly, his nerves and the events of the day didn’t keep him up. He fell asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Dean closed his eyes and actually named the waves in the swirling storm of feelings boiling in his chest. If it wasn’t Cas, he’d be pissed and devastated. Pissed that he’d gotten his hopes up for nothing, and devastated that Cas was really gone. If it
His heart picked up speed.
Cas had no idea who they were.
Cas. Goddammit, what he wouldn’t give for that damn angel to show up now.
“Sammy?” Dean shrugged. “I dunno.”
“Charlie?” Dean choked out.
“Shit. Probably.” Dean ran a hand down his face and suddenly felt all of the fatigue that the kiss had held at bay. “Yeah. I should sleep.”
No. No, he didn’t actually need to blow it out. It could stay lit--at least for a little while. Maybe something about keeping the connection open would bring Cas to them. Or maybe, if nothing else, it would make up for all of the words Dean couldn’t quite say.
“I’ll tell you,” Sam said in a slightly petulant tone. Dean suddenly saw Sam’s teenage self in the moose of a man in front of him. Dammit, he loved this stubborn son of a bitch. Not that he’d ever say that out loud, but Sam knew.
“I’ve been a little busy, Sammy. But I’ve kept up with the Leviathan mess.” He frowned. “Why?”
Cas nodded, although his eyes were filled with trepidation. She knelt in front of him, her expression warm and encouraging.
“Motel to change, then hit up the sheriff’s station?” Dean asked.
“What do we owe ya, Frank?” Dean asked.
Dean looked at Sam, who looked just as surprised as he was. They both turned to Bobby.
“I don’t eat,” Cas said. “I can taste every molecule. It’s not necessarily pleasant.”
Sam nodded. They crept through the woods in silence for several minutes. Something in the back of Dean’s mind made him think of horror movies. People could get killed here and no one would know.
“And before your brain turned to mush? Yeah,” Dean said.
“Family don’t end in blood, boy,” Bobby said. “Cas is family. He’s a stupid son of a bitch, but he’s family. And chances are, we’re not the only ones who want him on our side.” When Dean just frowned, Bobby added, “Don’t you think Crowley will want a word with the guy who screwed him? Or several words?”
“Found him,” Bobby said the next afternoon.
Bobby shrugged. “Less angry. Less drinking.” He frowned a little. “What did Charlie do?”
She glowed. “He’s the real deal, honey.” She took his hand. “He’ll help you. I’m sure of it.” She squeezed his hand before letting it go.
Sam nodded. “It’ll be fine.”
“Can you fix it?” Dean asked.
“No,” Dean said, every damn instinct rebelling. “I’m staying.”
Dean pulled her into his arms and wrapped her in a vice grip. Charlie was
“Yep. Fine.”
Dean’s shoulders relaxed. “Thank you.”
Cas. For the millionth time, Dean wished for Cas.
Dean’s hand was curled into a tight fist at his side, shaking with the effort of not slapping the smug Leviathan in front of him. Chet’s smirk was almost too much to bear. Almost.
The full impact of his words crashed into him. He suddenly felt weak, as if the wind was knocked out of him. He hadn’t been ready to say all of that, but now it was out there. The weight of his secret, the safety of keeping it, was gone. Holy fucking shit. He braced himself for losing his brother and squeezed his eyes shut. “Are you happy now?” he asked harshly.
Some small, quiet part of Dean remembered everything else that Emmanuel would probably consider wrong with him. But he couldn’t know. It would be too much. And Dean wasn’t ready to let all of it go.
“I’m so sorry,” Cas said. God, the pain in his voice was devastating. He looked stricken. “I was just telling the truth. I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
Dean exhaled in a frustrated rush but listened. “Fine. See you tomorrow, Bobby.”
?” Bobby demanded. He glared at Sam. “Kid. If you want it to be a date, make it one.”
chest.
She gave him a flat look. “I know you. I know you need to vent.”
Gabriel sighed heavily. “Turn off that damn song first.” He handed her the ancient laptop.
“Leave it,” Sam said. “People thought we were mass murderers a few days ago, remember? Carrying around a friggin’ angel blade won’t help us.”
“She’s dead,” Sam confirmed.
Dean sighed. “Fine. But only if we can keep throwing these.”
Cas’ broken apology. Cas, leaking black goo. Sam, shooting at nothing. An imagined vision of Charlie, eyes closed and a terrible gash across her stomach.
Sam raised an eyebrow. “I can think of a couple reasons. Like what you said yesterday.”
Dean closed his mouth and glared at Cas. The angel’s eyes softened. “I’m not like you, Dean. I can’t sleep with someone one night and then go back to business as usual the next morning.” Cas dropped his eyes. “I’m not even used to kissing. The physical sensations are...a lot. And they’re all new.”
“That’s different from losing somebody,” Sam said. “And then we lost Charlie, and you were always closer with her than I was. And you haven’t been able to drive Baby around.”
“I can’t, man,” Dean said, shaking his head and instinctively backing away. “I gotta get back to Sam and Bobby. Stop the Leviathans. You remember those, right?”
. Dean pursed his lips before nodding approvingly. It felt good to throw something, to hit something that wasn’t going to fight him back. “Cas healed Sam.”
“What’d she say? Close enough to hack, far enough to see them coming?” When Dean saw Sam nod out of the corner of his eye, he added, “She told me if things go south, look for RRE. Any idea what that is?”
Bobby snorted. “Clear as day.”
Elle cocked her head. “You already called Charlie, didn’t you?”
Cas’ blue eyes went wide. “The wall. Sam, I’m so sorry--”
“If they have enough brain cells, they should have my laptop.”
Dean smiled. “I’m good, man. Really good. It’ll probably all go to shit soon, but for now…” He nodded. “Yeah. I’m good.”
sound. “The hell’s that mean?” he asked, glad to hear that most of the sleep was gone from his voice.
Dean turned back to his brother and saw something new in the puppy dog look: a little bit of sadness. “Anything. I’m here for you, man. I mean, I know I’ve been a basket case lately, but--”
. Cas knew Dean better than he let on. He knew the internalized homophobia, knew how much more real whatever they had would feel once they told others. He was gracefully giving Dean an out.
“There’s nothing wrong with backup copies! And
“Why don’t you take a seat?” Sam said, gently leading Frank to a chair. Dean let the talk Sam was undoubtedly giving Frank turn into background noise. Sammy knew what he was doing. They’d given “the talk” to plenty of people, and Sammy was better with feelings, anyway. So Dean focused on the laptop. He ignored how his hands were shaking and started scrolling.
“Okay, okay,” Dean said softly. “I promise.”
Cas didn’t speak. His eyes drifted down to Dean’s hand. He carefully, ever so slowly and gently, slotted his fingers through Dean’s. Dean’s breath caught in his throat, but he didn’t pull away.
Maybe sappy wasn’t a bad thing.
Wait. She was in heaven. She was in heaven!! Maybe she could find Cas, could get him back to the boys. Maybe?
“Regards, Dick.”
Bobby came down the stairs next. “When did you learn how to make coffee?”
“Who made the first move?” Sam asked.
“This doesn’t mean we’re even, ok?” he said to the empty room. “This doesn’t excuse the
“Make me a Cupid.”
Cas smiled at him with that same soft, gorgeous smile. “Goodbye, Dean.” There was a soft rush of wings, and Cas vanished.
Sam smiled. “Glad you’re still here.”
“You’re unique,” Charlie told him. “And Dean’s unique. And because of that, your relationship is unique.”
“Go,” Charlie said gently. “I’ve got him.”
Dean was a little too busy trying to get his balance back, trying to bring the world beyond the angel into focus, to think of words. “Huh?”
He walked into his room, closed the door, and sighed heavily. “I’ve got a bone to pick with you,” he said. No response.
Sam intercepted the handshake. “I’m Sam. This is my brother, Dean.”
Dean knew Cas wanted a real answer, not a thoughtless one. So he took a beat and focused inward.
Charlie moved her eyebrows up and down. “Okay, then. Let’s get started.”
“Any luck?” called Bobby when they pulled into the driveway.
Sam sighed. “God, I hope not. Thought we were done with that mess.”
Frank typed furiously before whistling. “Your sister? Seriously? How could someone this brilliant be related to you two boneheads?”
Dean focused back on the case. They spent the rest of the night researching. “I’m calling it a night,” Sam said around midnight. “Got a long drive tomorrow.”
“I still have your stupid trenchcoat in the car,” he said, his voice significantly quieter. “So, you know, if you ever get up the guts to actually face me and Sam, come and get it. I know you doodled all over our ribs, but we’re with Bobby. You can find him, at least.” He started pacing again. “And figure out what the hell happened to Charlie, while you’re making amends or whatever. Would be great to know how she showed up randomly and disappeared.” He closed his eyes, refusing to say the words that were echoing in his heart.
Cas nodded. “But not tonight.”
“Cas is different from other angels. He feels things almost as intensely as you do.” She grabbed an axe. “If any angel is capable of loving a human, it’d be him.”
Dean’s face flushed, as did Sam’s. Sam glared at his brother. Dean just started pacing.
Cas agreed, and they sat. Charlie took a deep breath, and Cas instinctively did the same. The forest smelled good. “I’ve always loved the woods,” he said.
They ran up the stairs and used the spare key Charlie had given them to get inside. It only took three steps to find her.
The angel turned back to the bed. Dean patted the space next to him.
Dean nodded, ignoring every instinct that told him it was Cas. It had to be. “Worth a shot.”
“Huh?” Dean asked.
“If we die, I’m haunting your ass,” Dean muttered under his breath. But he walked in anyway.
Eventually, Cas let go. The smile he gave Dean was unbearably soft. It took all of Dean’s self-control not to kiss him. Kissing him would’ve been ridiculous. Reckless. But goddammit, it was there. He could practically feel it in the room, on his lips, in the space between them. All he had to do was lean forward by an inch...two inches...pray that Cas moved with him, and--
Dean looked at Sam, who shrugged. “She has a point.”
“Bobby’s gonna want to hear this,” Sam said. He clapped a hand on Cas’ shoulder. “Come on. Let’s get out of here.”
“Seriously,” Sam said, beaming.
Dean pursed his lips. “She seemed like she was answering to someone or something. I don’t know. She said she was running out of time.”
Dean gave her an impatient flat look before throwing another axe.
An inexplicable thrill went through Dean.
“He broke your head.”
“Because Dean’s decided they’re going on a date on Friday,” Sam grumbled. “And apparently now I have to go on a date with Elle.” He glared at the computer. “I blame Charlie.”
Dean nodded.
“Stay put!” yelled a female voice. “Or you’ll burn yourself!”
Well, today, at least.
You both seem to be in nearly ideal physical condition,” Emmanuel continued, “but many illnesses hide under the surface.”
“Come on, buddy,” Dean said to Cas. “Let’s go.” They started walking towards the door. Bobby and Charlie said their goodbyes.
Sam nodded slowly. “Okay. I’ll call Bobby, fill him in.”
pissed,” Dean said. “He broke Sam.”
She nodded emphatically. “Very.”
Dean gave him his signature “what the fuck” look. “The hell’s that supposed to mean?”
“Go on, kid,” Bobby said gruffly. “Get outta here. Go raise hell somewhere else.”
He held up his hands in surrender. “Fine. Jeez.”
Sam sighed. “We all miss him, Dean. Might as well talk about it.”
“Go on.”
She just studied him. Her green eyes were still kind but bright and fierce. Dean had a feeling there was an incredibly sharp mind behind them. “Depends on how broken your angel is.”
“Oh, you mean saving the world? That’s cleaning up a mess?”
“Be careful,” Bobby said. “Remember--you’re supposed to be dead. Try not to stop or talk to anyone if you don’t have to.”
“Easy as pie, then,” Dean said, turning away from Cas and the moment he had no friggin’ clue how to handle. “How was Jody?”
Dean laughed--his first real laugh in...god, he didn’t even know how long. It felt good. “That’s my girl.”
“Shitty circulation.” She tilted her head. “Huh. Guess that’s one thing that didn’t change.”
The second time they switched, Dean checked on Sam. “You wanna find somewhere to stop?”
Dean shook his head, smiling a little. They paid their entrance fee, took their axes, and found a target far away from the others. “In case you end up yelling,” Charlie said.
She squinted at him. “No. I’m not. Sam and Dean need to know Cas is alive.”
“I get it, man.” Dean opened Baby’s trunk and pulled out Cas’ trench coat nervously. He held it out to Cas, who was staring at Dean more intensely than usual. Cas looked down at the coat and ran his hand over it lightly. Dean’s breath caught. This was more than a coat. This was a role, a symbol of who Cas had been before he betrayed the Winchesters. Cas fixed Dean with that intense stare again, for just a heartbeat. Dean knew Cas felt it, too--the significance of the piece of fabric between them. Cas put both hands on the trench coat, and Dean let it go.
“Squirrel and…” Sam trailed off. “Charlie?”
Elle’s eyebrows dropped as a distant, pained look filled her eyes. Dean recognized it. He’d seen that look in the mirror--the shadow that crossed his face when he remembered his time in hell. “That’s…” She glanced up at Sam. “How did you manage it?”
Elle’s smile grew, and for a moment Dean forgot that she’d made a werewolf explode not too long ago. “Hiya, Castiel. Charlie. Good to see you again.”
Charlie burst out laughing--doubled-over, running out of air laughing. “Shut up,” Dean grumbled.
“He’s in good company then.”
Her eyes sparkled. “Didn’t have to. Caught up with Gabe a while back.” She shook her head. “He really did not need to kill you that many times, Dean. But he can be a little...extra. And may all the gods help you if you try to change his mind.”
Cas looked at Dean, those big blue eyes full of questions.
Dean frowned, looking at Sam before turning back to Cas. “No, Cas,” Sam said gently. “Why should you go?”
“What’s the rush, Sammy?” Dean yelled back. Sam popped his head out, and Dean made several faces that hopefully articulated his panic at being left alone with Cas for a night.
he told himself.
“Don’t know that, either. Charlie must’ve run out of ghost juice or something. Said she had to go.” Some small part of Dean was proud of how calm he seemed--or at least convinced himself he seemed. If he actually articulated how he felt or what he was thinking, it wouldn’t be pretty.
“Our sister,” Sam said.
“How…” Dean started. But he’d run out of words. He’d already used too many that day.
“Each of us?” Sam asked.
“Your hands are friggin’ ice cubes, kid.”
A terrible, terrible weight lifted in Dean’s chest. “Seriously?”
“Talk about what?”
Sam shrugged. “Manageable.”
The angel just glared at her. He was short, she thought. But maybe he just seemed short because she was used to Sam and Dean.
“What ails you, Dean?” Emmanuel asked him.
“And the angels?” Cas’ voice almost brought him back to reality, but Dean made the mistake of focusing on Cas’ beautiful blue eyes.
Dean just looked at her, letting the one word in his head show through his expression:
Dean hung up. The shower helped clear his head a little, but not quite enough. He was still worried about Cas. He was terrified to admit to anyone just how worried he was. And, yeah. He missed the stupid son of a bitch. He wouldn’t admit that to anyone, either, but he missed him. He missed that stupid voice and those stupid eyes and--
“Yeah, we have,” Dean said gently. “We held hands last night.” He chuckled lightly at the memory. “I had to hold your hand to keep you from running off.”
“Call when you find somewhere to stay tonight, all right?” Bobby asked. His voice got just a hair less gruff. “Don’t make me come after you.”
“Great,” Dean complained. “Nothing new, no details.”
“I spent millennia without clothes.” Cas frowned slightly. “I spent most of those millennia without a vessel, though.”
“Sorry, sorry,” she said, still laughing. “It’s just--” She stood slowly. “Whoo. Buddy. The dream. Me as a
“Fair enough.” She put a hand on one of her hips, standing so she was mostly balanced on that leg. “Pretty sure Gabe already gave this away, but here’s my two cents. Which I think you know already.”
angel. Maybe it was a side effect from going through so damn much so fast. Maybe it was from the stupid heaven dream or the damn heart-to-hearts with Charlie. Maybe it was because Sam and Bobby weren't around and the only one who would ever know about this moment was Cas. Whatever the reason, Dean let Cas hold him. And he held his angel back.
Sam opened his mouth to fight back, but someone in front of them gave them a death glare. Apparently they were supposed to wait for Emmanuel quietly. Great. Exactly what Dean needed: a chance to be alone with his thoughts and feelings.
Charlie winked at him. “My pleasure. Gotta do what I can to help everyone get their happy endings.”
Sam smiled. “Better, maybe. Amazing? We’re not in Seattle, Dean. Or Berkeley.”
women.
Sam walked out the door then, alarm spreading across his face as he met three sets of expectant eyes. “What?”
“Pretty messed up,” Sam said.
Sam put the pieces together. This was about Cas. Cas, who had shown up naked and covered in bees not too long ago. Cas, who had betrayed them. Cas, who Dean had never stopped missing.
“You should check on your brother.”
“Well, as she put it, if the Leviathans win, her part of the woods will no longer exist.”
Dean sighed, taking stock of his body. “Yeah,” he mumbled, surprised. “I slept great. How was your, uh…” He rubbed his eyes.
“Maybe Elle and Jody are…” Sam trailed off before beaming in victory. “Yes! Found a place.” He jotted down the address.
“It was nice,” Cas said simply.
“Permanent Cupid status,” Charlie said, almost glowing with pride. As she should be, Dean thought. With all the glitter and rainbows that should go with it. Dean squeezed Cas’ hand and felt his angel squeeze back.
The happy feeling in Dean’s chest faded as he remembered how damn angry he was. “Cas--” Dean said in a warning tone.
She sat up tall. “I’m a Cupid in training.”
She grinned. “Uh huh. Keep going.”
“It sounds familiar,” she said in a distracted voice. “Everything about her sounds familiar, actually. I wonder…” She trailed off. They’d reached the cabin.
“What? You asking for my blessing?” Bobby asked.
Sam chuckled humorlessly. “Pounding. Haven’t had whiskey in a while.”
“And Cas is alive,” Sam added.
“Uh huh. Real interesting.”
He sighed.
“How’s your head, Sammy?” Dean asked. He’d been so damn caught up in the case he’d forgotten to check on his brother.
She nodded. “I’ll have to charge it first and put a couple binding spells on it after, but yes. It can handle it.”
Cas sighed. Another frustratingly human reaction. “Angels are meant to be...robotic, in a way. We have jobs. We get our jobs done. That’s all. Feelings, individual opinions...those are human. Those are distractions.”
He heard a faint rustle of clothing. Shoes landing on the floor. The silk slide of a tie coming off. A zipper being undone.
And standing there, talking about favors with that smile, Dean knew what was so damn familiar about her. She reminded him of the fairies that had captured him years ago. But that didn’t make any sense. She was as tall as most human women. And yet...there was undoubtedly something fairy-like about her. It was in her smile, her eyes, her cheekbones. He wanted to ask her about the fairies, but before he could speak, Bobby jumped in.
“Nah.” Bobby opened a beer. “Learn anything new here?”
“Well, yeah. Of course. But that’s different.”
“Right. They told me,” Bobby said. “And how did you do that, exactly?”
. Don’t do anything stupid.”
Maybe that was the point, he thought as he brushed his teeth. If it had been anyone else, of any gender, he wouldn’t be this happy. Yeah, he was still kind of freaking out about Cas being a guy. Hell, he was still getting used to the idea of liking guys. But when he pushed past his knee-jerk reactions of fear and panic, there was freedom. Freedom and a soul-deep sense of knowing. He liked men. And he liked women.
“She’s been a hunter, Dean. Ever since those damn zombies. I’m just showing her a few tricks of the trade.”
Dean nodded and made a beeline for the coffee.
“Uh…” He dropped his eyes, trying to clear his head, but they landed on Cas’ lips. Not helpful. “No. Other than you and Charlie and apparently Gabriel pulling some strings behind the scenes, nothing.”
“Term of endearment, Cas.” Bobby clapped a hand on his shoulder before filling up his mug. “Get used to it.”
Last night. Last night, he’d kissed Cas. Cas had kissed him back. They’d kissed some more. They’d talked about having sex eventually. Going on a date before having sex. Dean had fallen asleep in Cas’ arms.
. He’d forgotten all of that. Cas was strong and powerful and knew him--really knew him.
She glared at him. “Bull fucking shit. Take a minute. Take a breath. Think. Then try answering that again.”
Dean groaned. “Can’t it be once and done?”
“Dude. Charlie can’t get credit for everything,” Dean reminded him. “She’s queer couples only, remember?”
Dean nodded. “Crystal.”
Charlie’s eyes softened and grew heavier. “You can’t go back, Cas. They’d kill you on sight.”
“Promise me you’ll try to change that.”
Sam looked like he was holding back a smile and a wiseass remark.
?” he wondered. His head snapped up, blue eyes locking with Dean’s. “How? What could she be tethered to?”
“What’re you doing home, anyway?” Bobby asked. “Thought you were in Omaha, going after some werewolves.”
Dean frowned as he yanked out several axes. “I dunno. Just is.”
“She doesn’t look like a fairy,” Dean grumbled. His stress level was rising higher and higher, like water boiling in a pot and about to start spilling over the sides.
Dean took a deep breath, feeling a slight tingling up his arm. The tree. He felt stronger. “We should keep going.” He pulled away and kept walking.
Cas was lost in thought, his blue eyes hazy. “This is all my fault,” he said quietly.
Her eyes lit up. “I hacked angel radio and pissed them off enough that they made me a Cupid.”
“If there’s something really powerful here, shouldn’t it take care of this?” Sam asked, changing into his Fed suit.
Dean just shrugged. “I was angry with you, Cas. I was pissed as hell for a long time.”
“Colorado,” Dean corrected. “Keystone.”
So, naturally, she didn’t trust it.
“Yeah. When we were hunting those werewolves,” Sam explained. His voice trailed off, and Dean knew he was trying to think of an out. “The night we met Elle. Speaking of, I should probably, uh, call her. Check in. See if she’s found anything.” He pulled out his phone and slowly walked outside, closing the door softly behind him.
Frank nodded, still focused on the laptop. “That makes more sense.”
Cas’ eyebrows came together. Charlie was a Cupid. Cupids dealt with very specific emotions.
“Good night,” Sam and Dean called. They started moving towards the stairs. Cas just stood awkwardly in the doorway. “Should I go?” he asked.
with you friggin’
“Penny for your thoughts?” Cas asked, letting Dean go. Mostly. He held onto Dean’s hand, slotting their fingers together.
Sam had a look of intense concentration on his face before going to the fridge. “Huh. Looks like I need to go on an actual milk run.”
“Leviathans,” Dean said. “She was hacking into their database when they caught her. We saw her ghost--or some form of her that looked a hell of a lot like a ghost--yesterday, which doesn’t make any damn sense. We gave her a hunter’s funeral.”
“The Winchesters?” Sam asked easily. “Yeah, we get that a lot. Don’t worry--we’re harmless.” He gave her his most winning smile, and she relaxed and walked away.
“And I will,” Cas said, breaking eye contact with Dean. Miraculously, the heat faded, and Dean could breathe again. “I will come as soon as he calls. Assuming he calls.”
Cas’ eyes went wide. “That’s possible?”
, he reminded himself.
her eyes seemed to say. Dean gave them a half sort of wave and walked out, closing the door behind him.
One night, two dead Leviathans, and a locked safe of cursed objects later, they walked into their motel room. “I call showering first,” Sam said.
“By watching the stars?” Cas shrugged. “Occasionally.” He watched curiously as Dean got under the covers. “That’s comfortable for you?”
“See you soon,” Sam said before hanging up. He exhaled heavily. “That could’ve been worse,” he mumbled before drinking more coffee.
Dean made a face. “Berkeley?”
They pulled into the closest gas station. “Okay,” Sam said. “Just…” He pinned Dean with an unusually earnest and open look. “You know you can tell me anything, right?”
Bobby and Dean toasted their coffee mugs.
He clenched his fists, digging his nails into his palms as more tears threatened. Of course everything felt different. Charlie was gone. It should be pouring rain.
Sam shrugged. “Only if you shower first. And maybe shave. Or put on something that doesn’t have holes in it.”
“The Leviathans…” Cas’ voice trailed off. “This is all my fault.”
“A witch? Helping angels?”
Dean frowned. “Will other people be able to see you? Are you, you know...?”
“We’ll get ‘em,” Bobby told Sam, clapping him on the shoulder. “We’ll buy all the damn Borax in the state if we have to.” He cleared his throat awkwardly. “I, uh, asked Jody to dig up some records. She should be stopping by later today.”
Sam’s eyebrows scrunched together in a frown. The sleep stayed in his eyes. “Did she?”
Sam nodded. His eyes were dark, worried. Ice-cold dread crept through Dean. If he was freaking out, and his marbles were still in one place...how the fuck was Sam not staring into space and drooling?
. He was finally with Cas. Bobby and Sam were happy for them. Charlie was getting her permanent wings. Bobby had a date lined up, and Sam was well on his way there. Sure, the Leviathans weren’t going anywhere, but they had the start of a plan to end them. For once, it didn’t feel like Dean’s world was falling apart.
Dean didn’t want to be right. He didn’t want to see Charlie’s dead body lying on the couch, covered in blood. He didn’t want to read the note on the table. He would have much rather checked on the young woman who was practically his sister, but Sam beat him to it.
“Go.”
Dean groaned, nodded, and got out of the car.
Dean glared at him. “You really think we’ve got time for that?” He found Sam’s laptop and opened it, rubbing his eyes. “Bobby, Sam’s head is broken. We gotta fix him first.”
“No offense, buddy, but you’re not the best judge of character right now.”
. He’d just never had much practice saying it. Or hearing it, for that matter. Dean was better with actions, with showing how he felt. Saving people. Patching up Sam’s hand. Keeping Cas’ trenchcoat in Baby’s trunk.
“I’m sure there are many things you want to tell me, Dean.”
>>Stay. Put.
“I know.” Sam turned around. “I just…”
Dean snorted and looked down again. Cas’ eyes were too much. “Old habits, I guess.”
“And did you see the stuff in her house?” Sam added. “Crystals. Herbs.”
She beamed. “Close enough. Let’s go.”
Sam mumbled a few more things to Frank. Dean saw Sam clap Frank’s shoulder from his peripheral vision before he joined Dean. “What’ve we got?”
“She’s too smart for that, Sammy. She’d get caught.”
Cas’ hands dropped. Sam blinked a few times before looking up at Cas. “Well?” Dean asked.
Bobby came down the stairs. “Where’d Sammy go?”
Cas opened his eyes and turned to Charlie. “I know what the feelings are. But I don’t know what they mean.”
She nodded.
“I should go,” Cas said.
Cas did that fucking adorable head tilt. “Yes.”
“Did I think the angel who probably doesn’t give a rat’s ass about sexuality, who’s commanded friggin’
He got back into the car and started driving back, feeling lighter than he had in weeks.
“What’s it gonna cost us?” Dean asked.
Sam was pale, his eyes wild, but he nodded. “Okay. And then...what? Drive another 12 hours?”
The angel raised his head. Dean exhaled sharply. Cas was exhausted, but the too-big smile was gone. The heavy weight of millennia of fighting and the icy intensity were back in his eyes.
“Why not?”
“But doesn’t that mean she’s trapped here?” Sam asked.
“Were you at the axe-throwing range with somebody?” Sam asked. Dean turned around. “Or did you just throw shit by yourself?”
“Nah, just me,” Dean lied easily.
“Since when do you give a shit what the other angels think?” Charlie asked, almost scoffing.
“No,” Dean said, backing away from where Cas had disappeared. “No. Nuh uh. This…” He shook his head and stormed outside.
“Give it some time,” Bobby said. He stared at Dean for a second longer than usual. Dean wondered what was going through his head. Probably nothing good. “I’ll go on the milk run. What were you gonna get?”
She shrugged. “I’ve found the stage crew tends to live longer and do more good over time than the stars.”
. “Is that clear?”
“I can think of someone else we know like that,” Sam said. When Dean didn’t respond, he added, “Someone whose melon is cracked.”
made him remember how much he hated that stupid voice. And how much he hated himself for hating that voice.
Bobby squinted at Sam before shooting Dean a look that clearly meant this was just the beginning of the “how broken is Sam’s head” discussion. Sam stood and dealt with his dishes. “I’m gonna see if I can crack Charlie’s laptop.”
“I know,” Sam said in a placating tone that somehow wasn’t condescending. He nodded a couple of times. “Okay. I’ll give you time.”
“The only way out is through, Dean,” Charlie said quietly. “You’ve been through a special type of hell just in the past week. It’s been a hell of a lot really fucking fast.” She squeezed his arm and smiled up at him. The understanding in her eyes nearly broke his heart. “You’ve gotta get this out, Dean. If you want to keep helping people--if you want to fight the Leviathans--you’ve gotta get this out of your head.” She started pulling at the axes. “We’ll keep throwing and shooting the shit as long as you need to. The Leviathans are smart and ruthless and don’t feel the way people do.”
Dean couldn’t meet those eyes, couldn’t look at Cas’ puppy dog expression, couldn’t react to the pain in the angel’s voice. He wasn’t ready to forgive Cas, but he sure as hell wasn’t ready to let him go, either. He noticed, for the first time, how grounding it was to have Cas around. Yeah, he was pissed at the guy. But he’d left a hole, a sense of unease in Dean’s chest. Having him back felt good.
His eyebrows went up. “You’ve heard of me?”
“Sure your head is okay?” Bobby asked.
“Yeah.” She perched on the bed next to him, rubbing his back gently. “
Charlie nodded. “Okay then. To recap the past week or so: you thought he was dead. But in the past 24 hours, you thought he was alive, but realized he’d forgotten you. Then he remembered you, asked you to forgive him, healed Sam, and lost his marbles.” She raised her eyebrows at Dean, her eyes going comically wide. “Holy shit.”
Nope. Just a burn.
Sam’s lips quirked up at one corner. “Jerk.” He let Dean control the music, let the familiar chords of Led Zeppelin fill the car.
. She could’ve tricked the cameras--”
Dean shrugged. “I’ve been doing that.” Sam rolled his eyes, and Dean continued. “I’ll see if I can interview somebody around here. I’ve got a feeling several folks died after selling their stores and homes.”
“Didn’t say it was a bad weird,” Dean said quickly. Cas smiled softly. Had anyone ever flirted with Cas? Told him how friggin’ gorgeous he was? That soft smile made Dean wonder if this part of dating was new to the angel, too. He threw the blankets open on Cas’ side. Cas’ eyes flitted from the blankets to Dean. “If you want,” Dean told him.
He glanced at the candle, still burning brightly on the desk. He blew it out and slipped into a fitful sleep.
“We’re gonna go, okay guys?” Sam said. “Cas, stay there. We’ll be back as soon as we can.”
. “I’m gonna get my bag,” Dean said, not even trying to change the subject smoothly.
Her eyebrows shot up. “Were you happy drunk, too? Or stuck in a straightjacket?”
“Yeah,” Sam confirmed. “Why?”
“We sure it’s Cas?” Dean asked.
Dean glared at him. “
“Okay,” Sam said.
Balls. He was happy. What the fuck was he supposed to do with
Dean tried again. “What do you mean?”
“Radio silence? Really?”
“Fine,” Dean grumbled. “Fine.” He started walking towards the bed, putting his beer on the nightstand. “Actually, you know what?” he asked, waving a finger up at the sky. “Not fine. None of this bullshit is anything even remotely
“He took on Sam’s crazy,” Dean explained.
“And whatever you’ve been talking about that you won’t tell me?” Sam asked softly.
Most importantly, he was in love with his best friend. Which was equal parts terrifying and freeing. His chest ached. He imagined his heart being broken open. Not broken and painful or damaged. Broken like an eggshell or a case--broken to reveal the true and tender goodness within.
“Okay. Maybe I can play with the fire--”
Cas just frowned at Dean and gave him that goddamn head tilt. “I don’t understand.”
“Did you ask her out?”
“The wall in Sam’s head. Can you fix it?
“I think I got a lead on how to kill these things,” Bobby said.
Bobby paused, thinking. “Then I’d say she’s incredibly dangerous, whatever and whoever she is. So let’s stay on her good side.” The boys nodded. Dean resumed his pacing. Thinking about what Elle was or wasn’t only made him worry about Cas even more.
Sam snorted. “Me neither. Don’t think any of us expected her.” He stared into space. “I mean, she made a werewolf explode tonight.”
Sam scoffed. Bobby ignored both of them. “Stay put. Help me see if we can figure out how to kill these things.” His eyes flicked to the news again. “Or see if there’s a pattern to your evil twins’ killing spree.”
“There’s nothing wrong with you,” Charlie said softly. “Absolutely nothing.”
, dammit. He fought to pull himself together.
Dean jumped. “Jesus Christ, Charlie, d’you think you could warn me next time?”
Sam came in a little while later. “Well?” Dean asked.
, Cas,” said Charlie and Bobby in unison. Dean was chuckling. This was better--and infinitely worse--than the time Cas drank a liquor store. “Friggin’ bees,” he muttered. He and Sam pulled into the motel.
The interview with the sheriff was pretty standard. “Only weird thing is, it’s not a full moon,” Sam said as they walked back to the car.
They all laughed. “Bye, bitches,” Charlie said, her voice bittersweet.
“I held your soul when I carried you out of hell.” Cas walked into the kitchen. “I pieced your body together. To me, yes, you’re that easy to read.”
“Always am.”
Cas sighed heavily. “Dean, I know you’re angry with me--”
“What? No,” Sam said.
Bobby gave him an apologetic sort of half smile and shrugged. “Sorry, kid. Did...did you find new IDs? At her place?”
“Are you sure that’s a good idea?” Dean asked.
Sam shot Dean his classic bitch face. Bobby hung up as Dean started eating. “Garth needs a hand, so I’m gonna head out in a bit.”
There was a beat of silence.
Dean snorted. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it.”
“What?” the older hunter asked. “Holding a grudge is like drinking poison and expecting the other guy to die.”
look, he explained, “The one she’d crawl into?”
“She needs someone on the outside to do that. Remember?”
“Shut up, Dean,” Sam muttered back.
“Dammit,” Dean muttered. “You gotta pick up. He’ll just keep calling.”
“Who told you that?” Dean said. “I mean, I get you knowing about the forces and all, but that’s pretty damn specific.”
“I'll start digging,” Sam said.
It was too much. The events of the past several days, the vision, Gabe’s command, the glimpse of a happiness he could never fully have. The hint of one that he
She started typing.
“Hello, Sam,” Cas said, apparently unbothered. But he stayed behind Dean, who couldn’t stand the tension anymore.
Of course, there was more to his thoughts of Cas than Charlie. But thinking too hard was risky. That particular train of thought led to nowhere but an endless pit of despair. Dean knew it well. All thoughts of lost ones led to that same damn pit--his mom, his dad, the fucking baby in a trench coat with shitty people skills and the kind of loyalty Dean had rarely seen.
“Okay.” Bobby nodded slowly. “Okay.” He refilled his own coffee mug. “We’ll put the fairy thing on pause, then. But we gotta keep up with the Leviathan. Especially the ones wearing your ugly mugs.” He stared at Dean, who eventually gave in and looked back up at him. “I’ll see if I can find anything that’ll help Sam. You look into how to really kill the Leviathan. Fair?”
hangovers.
“And the rest of it?” Dean asked.
Thinking of Charlie made him think of her laptop and pushed him down the stairs a bit faster. Sam raised his coffee in a tired hello.
Cas settled into the chair next to Dean’s. “Was that necessary?”
Dean tilted his head down so Sam wouldn’t see the look on his face. If it matched how he felt, he looked fucking devastated. “Cas, I’m sorry, buddy. We’re on a case.”
are,” Sam interjected. Dean glanced at his brother. Sam’s jaw was clenched, his eyes frantic. “As soon as we find all of ‘em. They’ve taken too many people already.”
Bobby’s phone rang. He shrugged. “Maybe this’ll be our magic answer.” He held the phone to his ear. “Yello.” He stood a little taller. “Jody. Hi. What’s going on?” He left the cabin.
“Maybe,” she said. “I’ll be right back.” She gave Cas’ shoulder a reassuring squeeze before walking away.
“Okay, okay. Sheesh.” She opened the door, and Dean rushed in.
Dean chewed on the question burning in his mouth before biting the bullet. “You seeing things?”
Cas walked over and frowned at the computer. “Tuxedo rentals?”
“Ohhhkay,” Sam said. Dean could hear the questions layered in his tone. Fortunately, his little brother didn’t ask any of them. “Have fun!”
“You know the guys who started Starbucks?” Dean nodded. “They were trained by the guy who started Peet’s. In Berkeley.”
head’s a little cracked,” he muttered to himself as he pulled on a T-shirt.
Dean was definitely not a stranger to hangovers. Far from it. But this one? This was
Dean suddenly forgot his fatigue. He didn’t want to run. He wanted to help. “Okay,” he said again, a little more gently this time.
Still nothing. Sam exhaled heavily. Talking to Dean about feelings was usually as productive as talking to a stone, but he had to try. He didn’t know how Dean was feeling, but murderous was definitely a possibility. “I hope it’s Cas.”
Dean was speechless. Utterly, completely speechless.
“Yeah, old man,” Dean said. “You’re probably overdue.”
Sam waved his apology away. “No, I’ve been fine.”
Dean swallowed and nodded, his head brushing against Cas’. Not knowing what else to do--not ready for anything else--he let the angel go. “Yeah. Uh.” He scratched the back of his head. “Anyway.”
Dean had a sudden, fierce instinct to take Cas’ hand. Stupid. Dumb. But holding Cas’ hand had felt so
Bone-tired. Soul-tired. He’d managed to stay numb the entire drive, but it hadn’t been easy. The grief, the anger, the way he missed her in his soul were starting to leak through. He barely made it out of the car.
She grinned at her boys. “Sup, bitches?” She looked at Frank. “Move.”
She ruffled his hair before letting him go. “You too. And don’t you dare undo all the hard work we’ve done. Got it?”
Dean knew, logically, that his leg was healed. The lingering pain was gone. But the rest of him was a
The toaster went off. Dean stood and got the butter out of the fridge. “Yeah. Fair.”
“24 hours,” Sam said. “University library.” He shrugged. “I’ll get a motel room somewhere. Come back in the morning.”
Charlie couldn’t hold back her anger anymore. “They saved the damn world, and you’re not willing to help them?”
The man in front of them walked away. Cas stood, holding out a hand. That too-easy smile was still on his face. “Hi. I’m Emmanuel. It’s nice to meet you.”
“Nothing.”
“What, are we in a shrink’s office now?” Dean said. It came out more sharply than he intended. It was a barb, meant to protect himself more than hurt anyone else.
He poured more whiskey into his glass, then Bobby’s. “I’m pissed, too. I’m pissed at the Leviathans for killing--” He couldn’t say her name. “You know.” Bobby nodded. “And I’m pissed at friggin’ Cas for letting them in. I’m pissed at Sam for lying to us.”
The tension that had been living in Cas’ chest since he broke Sam’s wall finally lifted. He nodded. “Good.” They sat in silence for another moment, but Cas could tell Charlie was getting antsy. She had more to say. “I’m sorry I couldn’t save you,” he told her.
Eventually, after Dean’s heart had been cracked wide open and his world had turned upside down, Cas pulled away. He gave Dean a knowing smile. “Are you sure I’m still family?”
“He’s going on speaker.”
because he can’t fucking
“Go.”
“Fine,” Sam said, blinking a few times. “You just surprised me. There’s a lot of good stuff in here.”
Wondering what else she could read--but not at all willing to ask--Dean said, “Cas healed my leg.”
Elle’s lips turned up in a half smile. “And I’m sure it was brilliant. But I can handle this.”
Cas looked straight ahead. The cabin was tucked away in the middle of the woods. Their options were trees or a dirt road. “The woods are good,” he confirmed.
Charlie made a questioning noise. “Shut it,” Dean told her, ruffling her hair.
“Corn syrup?” Dean asked.
Unfortunately, peace and quiet didn’t really go together anymore. His thoughts danced between Charlie, Cas, and Sam. If he was this torn up, Sam...Sam must be worse. Sam had barely been keeping it together even before Charlie. How the
“Huh.” Charlie threw the axe. “Think Sam was faking it?”
Cas shook his head in wonder as sadness leaked into his eyes. “Why do you always sell yourself short?”
“I mean, I’m wondering about other things too. How the hell he’s alive, why he didn’t find us--”
Cas looked back at Dean, and the stabbing pain came back. The shattered pieces of joy and relief inside of him twisted. Cas held out his hand.
Shit. He had to get that back to Cas.
Cas held up a photo. “Who is this man?”
Dean sighed heavily. He nodded. “Could never say no to you, anyway,” he said, nudging her arm with his elbow.
Dean laughed. “Right. Good luck.”
“Can you make me an angel after I’m a ghost?”
“But he doesn’t know…” Dean ran out of words, made a fist, and knocked on his chest.
“Cas?” Sam asked quietly.
“I can’t completely eliminate what Sam is suffering from,” Cas continued. “But I might be able to transfer it.” He met Dean’s eyes, and Dean felt a chill crawl down his spine. Cas looked like a soldier going into battle. “I’m sorry. For everything. I hope you can forgive me one day.” He looked at Bobby, then Sam, and finally Dean. There was something in those blue eyes--something important, something behind the resignation and determination. Suddenly the storm of feelings that had been swirling inside of Dean got stuck in his throat. He needed to say something. He needed to tell Cas--
known. And he had his back anyway.
“We all did, Dean. And then he more than made up for it, in my opinion. So? Did you forgive him?”
“For the first time since we saw him die,” Sam said.
Dean let the silence settle for a moment, feeling that strange lightness in his stomach again.
Dean huffed a laugh and tried to disentangle himself from Cas’ arms. “Shut up,” he grumbled, but there was no heat to it. Cas grinned in response, his eyes sparkling, and kissed him. This one felt different. Slower. More tender. Less surprise and fireworks, more intention and simmering coals. By the time they broke apart, Dean was completely breathless and more than a little starstruck. He was in love. He was completely, totally, over-the-moon in love with a fallen angel. A fallen angel who, for some unfathomable reason, loved him back. Or at least cared enough about him to kiss him absolutely stupid. Dean hoped Cas loved him back. What else could it be?
“Yeah, buddy?”
When Dean made his way downstairs again, Sam was drinking coffee and chatting with Bobby. For a half a heartbeat, Dean let himself believe that things were normal again. He let himself believe that Cas was a prayer away, that Charlie was sound asleep on the couch. Of course, none of it was true. And he hated himself for dreaming of it, but some part of him couldn’t help it.
And Dean looked at Cas in the exact same way.
As if he could hear him, Emmanuel’s head snapped up, blue eyes meeting green. And something clicked.
“Obviously.” They collected their axes, returned them, and walked back to the car.
An hour later, he tried again. “He has a right to know, Dean. Would you rather tell him in person?”
Relief flooded through Dean. He pulled away. “Seriously?”
“They’re angels,” Dean said, “so I’m gonna go with no.”
“Nothing,” Dean said.
that was bubbling up and out of his heart made it across his lips, Dean leaned forward and kissed Cas. The angel’s shoulders dropped as he relaxed. “It’s perfect,” Dean told him.
She grinned. “Not even a little. So, no. I don’t think they’ll think there’s something wrong with you. Hell--I don’t even think they’ll be surprised.”
Dean barely resisted rolling his eyes. “Charlie’s kind of smart, ok?” He started throwing his stuff into his duffel.
Charlie doubled over with the force of her laughter. When none of the boys joined her, she said, “You’re kidding, right?”
Charlie’s eyes lit up. She whistled. “Hot damn. Sammy’s got his work cut out for him.”
The woman sighed. “Fine then.” She started speaking in a language Dean didn’t recognize. He heard a soft boom and a splat as the werewolf exploded. Sam looked at him wide-eyed. Whoever this woman was, they didn’t want to mess with her.
“What’d Dean do this time?” Sam asked in an extremely sleepy voice.
And goddammit, Dean gave in. He trusted Cas. Even with everything they’d been through, even with the lies, he trusted him. So he slowly nodded. “Okay.” Their eyes caught, and Dean’s heart jumped into his throat. This was a moment. He could feel it, could feel the tenderness and tension and pull. The desire to kiss Cas came out of nowhere and exploded inside of him. And Cas’ expression was so open, so soft. If Dean just moved his head a little to the right, if he just leaned a little bit forward--
“Uh huh.” Charlie squinted at the target, holding out her axe.
Dean downed the rest of his coffee. “See you at the motel.”
Dean chuckled lightly. Those weren’t the words he’d wanted, but they were easier to handle. “Usually? I beat the shit out of monsters and demons to keep a lid on it. And when that doesn’t work, whiskey usually does the trick.”
Dean’s glower stayed.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean mumbled. And with a whoosh of wings, she was gone.
“You owe me forty bucks!” Sam shot one last grin at Dean and Cas before running downstairs.
Elle came back carrying an empty hourglass. At least, Dean assumed it was empty. The glass was pitch black. When the firelight hit it, he could see some runes etched into the sides. “What’s that?” he asked.
Sam’s stubborn expression stayed. “It’s fine.”
Nothing. Not even an option for a connection.
Sam released Cas and turned his attention to Elle. “Thank you.”
He started planning out the lecture he’d give the stupid angel when he finally saw him. Thinking about that was a hell of a lot easier than trying to understand the stupid churning feeling in his stomach. No, churning was the wrong word. It was lighter. Halfway through his shower, he figured it out.
Cas frowned and did that goddamn adorable head tilt. “What do you mean?”
Dean grinned. “You wuss. You don’t want to tell him over the phone.”
“You trying to tell me feelings are a liability?” Dean said. “No shit.”
“I know,” he said. “I’m sure there was a reason. This is Cas, Dean. He rebelled against heaven for us.” Sam shook his head, lost in thought. “There must be a reason.”
“Uh…” Jody said, clearly at a loss for words.
“Let’s have some food, huh?” Jody asked, clapping Cas on the shoulder. “I made chili.”
Dean hated it, but he nodded. “Don’t want Gabe to get mad at you.”
Instead, he said, “And you promised you’d fix Sam. So get your ass over here and fix the mess you made.” He stormed over to the candle and almost blew it out. It flickered. He exhaled softly, and it flickered again.
“Only if you want to twiddle your thumbs hoping no one sees you for two hours,” Bobby reminded him. “Charlie needs an hour and will probably hit traffic.”
Sam’s eyebrows and hands went up in surrender. “Okay. But that’s the kind of juice we’ll need to cure me. And all the angels who worked with us are dead, right?”
Cas directed that fucking adorable head tilt at Dean. “Practice run? Big leagues?”
Too tired to put any of those thoughts into words, Dean just hummed his agreement. Cas lightly stroked his hair, and Dean turned into a puddle. A thought occurred to him, and he was tired enough to not have a filter. “When you said all of the physical sensations are new…”
“The deal
Cas hummed thoughtfully. “What other Leviathans should I know about?”
Dean shook his head. The fear and fury in his stomach had boiled over into his throat, making it impossible to speak without snapping at his brother. And Sam hadn’t done anything to deserve that.
“You should.” Elle was standing on her front steps, smiling at them. “Welcome, everyone. Come on in.” Sam walked in first, followed by Bobby and Charlie.
“Drop it, Sammy,” Dean said in a tight voice. He couldn’t make eye contact with Sam, even though he felt those hazel eyes boring into him. Sammy was constantly questioning what was real. How would he react if he realized his big brother was barely hanging on?
“One last thing,” said the woman. “You’re going to stop eating human hearts. You and the rest of your pack. Or I will hunt you down and kill you. Understand?”
Sam nodded before standing. “Give me five minutes.” He tucked his hair behind his ears before heading upstairs.
the night before, so easy. And the angel was clearly in pain.
Dean shook his head. “He keeps flying around with no rhyme or reason, apparently.” A new thought occurred to him. “Guess the plus side is no one can track him--demons or Leviathans or angels.”
“What happened to the Impala?” Cas asked. “Why aren’t you driving her?” His tone made it clear that he’d already asked Dean that question. So did Sam’s raised eyebrows.
Dean nodded, fighting the fear that was threatening to explode out of him in tears. “Yeah. Okay.”
Dean ran his hand down his face. “I’m going to kill him,” he muttered to himself. “Yeah, Cas?”
“You seem different,” Sam told Dean.
“Send a prayer to Charlie?”
Hurt flashed across Sam’s face, quick and sharp and clear. “Yeah. Okay.” He picked up Dean’s pace, walking with his big brother.
In a way, accepting his sexuality was freeing. Absolutely goddamn terrifying, but freeing. Dean knew in his bones that it had always been true. It felt like a part of himself was just opening up. But holy fucking hell did it scare the shit out of him. How would Sam react? How would Bobby react? How would
. Strong arms, broad shoulders, a fit chest...and topped with those bright blue eyes and dark brown hair sticking out every which way? Dean felt suddenly dizzy. His stomach felt strange--like someone had sucker-punched him. “Where are your clothes, man?”
Dean groaned. “What?”
he thought.
No. That part of him died when Cas went crazy, if it had ever been real in the first place. He closed his eyes, trying desperately to ignore the hints that Charlie had been dropping since they went to the axe-throwing range. Just before drifting off into sleep, he remembered.
The house was oddly quiet as they drank, reminding Sam of something. “We thought you still had a Leviathan in the basement,” he asked.
She smiled and filled up the kettle, setting it on the stove. “I’ll be right back. Don’t touch anything. This stuff’s more dangerous than it looks.” She walked just out of their sight, and the boys heard a door close.
But Sam didn’t comment on it. The big nerd knew better than that. Sam nodded curtly.
His phone rang. The sound made Dean breathe in sharply. He picked up. “Yeah?”
“Oh, honey,” she said. “Cas, you’re smarter than this.”
“Dammit, Cas,” Dean said in a low voice that almost broke. He reached into the fridge and pulled out a beer.
“I don’t give a damn. Call me when you find somewhere to stay.” His eyes were hard and determined. Dean knew that look. It meant fighting was pointless.
“Huh?”
“Don’t mention it.” Bobby spread out the newspaper on the table. “Didn’t hear anything from Sam’s room, did you?”
Dean rolled his eyes as Charlie started to pace, growing more and more animated. He’d never admit it, but he loved seeing her this excited. “You’ve only ever been this mad at family. At people you love.” She raised her eyebrows in a silent question, and Dean reluctantly nodded.
. He’d gone to hell for the kid. If he could do that, couldn’t he talk to him?
“That obvious, huh?” Dean said, barely keeping the smile off of his face. This was going
“Sam,” Dean cut in, “I have talked about feelings more in the past three days than I have in years. I’m done.” His tone left no room for arguing.
“No, we can keep going,” said Sam with a massive yawn. “Just let me make some coffee.”
“Missouri caught wind of some faith healer. Name’s Emmanuel.”
“Ugh. Fine. Don’t be dumb.”
Dean groaned and put his head in his hands. He was not ready to face Cas, not ready to face Sam. Not ready to be around Cas while Sam knew how he felt and Bobby just suspected. No. Absolutely not. He would just stay in bed until...was forever an option?
Dean snorted. “You’re a what? Thought those were only naked dudes.” He frowned. “And how the hell can a human become an angel, anyway?”
Sam and Bobby’s eyebrows went up. “He’s really lost it, huh?”
Sam glanced at Dean and rolled his eyes at his brother’s expression. “Shut up.”
Sam shuddered. “Don’t remind me.”
After the pyre had reduced to ashes, the boys went inside. Bobby, who had spent the whole damn time drinking in surly silence, went straight for the liquor cabinet. “You boys met her in high school, right?”
Cas frowned at him. “Turning your brain to mush?”
“A mora miserium,” she said. “It can hold negative energies.”
“I must be out of my mind,” he muttered as he pulled out his lighter. He stared at the candle, deliberating. “But what the hell.” He lit it and sat back on his bed, watching the flames.
Dean spun around to look at Cas, who had a beautifully soft look of wonder on his face. He looked at Dean, his eyes full of happy questions.
Dean’s heart picked up a frantic pace. He’d hoped. He’d wondered. If Charlie had talked to both of them...did that mean what he wanted it to mean? They were so close. They were flirting with the words that Dean was terrified to say but wanted desperately to hear.
Okay? Try fucking
Dean bit back a snippy remark. Sam didn’t deserve that. “I had good reason to be mad at him, Sammy.”
Bobby and Sam filled him in. Dean nodded along, surprised at how much easier it was to focus on work after actually dealing with his emotions. Shit. Maybe Charlie was on to something.
“Should I let you sleep?” Cas asked. When Dean just blinked at him again, he added, “It’s well after midnight.”
Dean was still tired, but he could put two and two together. He almost ran over to his brother. “Don’t you dare,” he threatened.
“Dean…” Sam said hesitantly. “She was really here, right?” They walked to the old pickup truck.
. His mouth felt like sandpaper. His throat burned. If he even shifted in bed, his head throbbed.
“I think we know their endgame already,” Sam said. When Bobby frowned at him, he said, “World domination. Somehow keeping us docile enough to be easy prey.”
Thank you so much for reading Cupid's Hack! I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I loved writing it. Don't forget to hug that kudos button, and I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments!
Dean groaned and ran a hand down his face. “Christ on a cracker. Forgot about those sons of bitches.”
“We do,” Sam admitted.
tiny witch?” Dean said, grinning.
“No,” Sam said. Guilt spread across his face. “Afraid I couldn’t stay awake much longer. I was gonna give it another crack today.”
He nodded. “Yeah. Hunter’s funeral. She deserves it.”
“It’s a cleaning solution sort of thing. I mean, you still have to chop off their heads, but Borax burns ‘em pretty good.”
The hours got longer, the night darker. Sam and Dean took turns sleeping--well, Sam slept. Maybe. Dean dozed fitfully, memories and nightmares taking turns playing like a movie in his head.
Sam sighed. “Fine.” He stood and started changing back into flannel and jeans. “You know, I think I’d feel better if you told me whatever it is you and Charlie have been talking about.”
“It’s
. “You don’t deal with your feelings, do you?”
One of Jody’s eyebrows went up, but she didn’t press it. “So, fake marriage.”
Dean looked at both of them before pointing back and forth, drawing an imaginary line between them in the air. “You talked about this without me.”
“We should go. Let you deal with that thing before it explodes.” He gestured to the hourglass.
Cas’ eyes on Dean’s were steady, completely nonjudgmental. “She helped me talk through some things as well.”
“Just...be careful, kiddo,” he told her. Sam smiled fondly. Charlie was practically Bobby’s daughter.
Dean glowered. Charlie sighed. “Spit it out.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “We had Charlie’s funeral yesterday. We just saw what had to be her ghost.”
Dean nodded. “Who’s the guy?”
Charlie chucked and shook her head. “Of course you don’t. I’m trying to ask what you’re thinking about.”
Dean groaned. “No. I’ve maxed out my feelings quota for the
Dean nodded. He was out of words, lost in this delicate little moment, in the way his hands were clammy and his heart was pounding out a frantic rhythm that Cas could probably hear.
“How close would Charlie need to be to hack in?”
The woman came back out in clean clothes. “I’m Elle, by the way.”
Dean nodded and pulled out of Frank’s driveway.
She shrugged, facing away from them. “I have my ways.”
“What happened to Cas?”
Dean nodded, shifting around and rearranging pillows. Cas turned back to the stars, and Dean felt a strange rush of annoyance. “Cas.”
“She was speaking some weird language. I don’t know it.” Sam frowned lightly. “But it kind of sounded like whatever that leprechaun was saying a few years ago.”
Charlie grinned. “It helps, right?” Her grin faded. “Cas took the crazy?” She picked up an axe.
Cas was quiet. “How?” he asked after a few seconds, his tone unusually soft.
Dean put both hands on Cas’ shoulders. “You’re back, man. We’ll figure the rest out.”
“I know,” Dean said. Sam didn’t look any happier. Dean sighed. “Dude, if you’ve got something to say, just say it. Why do you look like somebody...I don’t know...killed your puppy or something?”
Cas’ hands went back to Sam’s head, and Sam flinched. Dean watched in horror as red electricity appeared on Sam’s eyes and moved--moved from Sam’s eyes to his temples, to Cas’ hands, up Cas’ arms, and into the angel’s eyes. He released Sam and backed away.
Dean smiled.
“Thanks for doing that, Cas,” Sam said sincerely.
Some sort of sad understanding passed through Bobby’s eyes. “He said he’d fix Sam. Let’s find out if the bastard will keep his word.”
“Or go after them,” Dean said. When Bobby looked at him like he’d sprouted an extra head, he explained, “They’re wearing our faces. This is personal.”
An engine kicked into gear. Sam ran for the door, but by the time he reached it, Dean was already tearing out of the driveway.
“Ten bucks says Jody will ask him out first,” Sam said. They shook on it.
“But…?”
Dean was almost feeling better. He’d forced himself to drive far enough away that Sam and Bobby couldn’t yell at him--or, if they did, he couldn’t hear them. Drive away from his healed brother and adoptive father. Drive away from the friggin’ Leviathans and the angel with the stupidly blue eyes. Drive far enough that the roaring scream building in his chest would fade away.
“That doesn’t mean I wanted you to--”
“I’m stronger than you think I am, Dean,” Cas said. His eyes snapped up. There was a rebellious glint in them. The intensity charged the space between them, filling it with crackling heat.
“Emmanuel?” the wife asked. “Why are these men calling you Cas?”
third wheeling for the first time in
women. He knew it in his bones.
“Come on,” Charlie said, beaming now. “Most queer babes deny their sexuality for a long time. Dean’s done it more than most. Cas probably wasn’t even capable of love for centuries.”
Emmanuel smiled sympathetically. “ May I?” He held his hand over Dean’s leg, waiting for permission.
Dean sighed. “I think he’s got bats in the belfry and is lying to both of us about just how bad it really is.”
Cas was missing. Cas, who he just realized he was fucking
“Yes I did,” Cas said. “I broke your head, which made fixing it my responsibility.”
Dean shrugged. “Dunno.”
“We’re bringing her home,” Dean confirmed.
Cas’ eyes were wild, searching Dean’s face. His jaw had dropped a little. Shock was written all over his face. The angel stood, chest rising and falling a little more quickly than usual. Dean knew that, somehow. Normally, he would hate that he knew. But here, now, his breath just caught.
“I know, right?” said a bright female voice. The boys jumped as Charlie appeared out of nowhere.
Dean spun around. His jaw dropped.
Charlie’s eyes went sad. “Cupids start things, Sam,” she told him. “We get the ball rolling. This ball,” she waved at Dean and Cas, “is rolling, and there are so many queer babes who are stuck.”
, he told himself.
“Who did you say this belonged to?” Frank asked.
“We’ve already got two cases going.” When they didn’t react or respond, Dean kept going. “Saving Cas? Stopping an apocalypse again?” He took a nice, long sip of his coffee.
“Who the hell do you think I am?” Bobby asked. But a small smile was curling the edges of his lips. He showed Sam and Dean an entire key lime pie.
“I think I’ve talked more about feelings since you’ve come back than I have my entire fucking life and it’s your damn turn,” Dean grumbled.
Cas’ frown lingered. “Yes.” Recognition sparked in those brilliant blue eyes, and his frown disappeared. “You went on a killing spree. But they weren’t you. Were they?”
“Happy,” Charlie said. When Dean jumped a little, she added, “Yeah, I can read your mind.”
“I don’t think you would’ve driven away and almost yelled into the void if everything was fine,” Charlie said.
“Have you eaten yet?” Bobby asked.
“I know, Cas--”
The cover held a photo of him and Cas in matching tuxes, beaming. He opened it with a shaking hand and noticed, for the first time, the shining wedding band on his left ring finger.
“I’m texting her,” Dean said. He typed out a message:
Dean thought.
But Cas closed the space between them, wrapped one hand around the back of Dean’s neck, and kissed Dean softly, achingly so. The angel gently carded his fingers through the hair at the bottom of Dean’s neck. Something happened in Dean’s chest, some sort of thud or tiny earthquake, and it echoed out. Dean gasped a little in surprise. Cas pulled away, blue eyes bright with worry. “Was that--”
“Pounding headache?” Dean asked. “Is that new?”
“Dean,” Cas said in a tone that was beautifully rough. Was it a warning?
Cas and Elle were sitting by the fire, their heads in their hands. If their faces were anything to judge by, they were both basically suffering from
Cas tilted his head in a question. “Figured what out?”
Cas nodded. “I want to make amends.”
The laughter in Sam’s eyes faded. “You just asked me about this, Dean.”
“Shut it, Sammy,” she said, nudging his arm. “Cupids set up romances. We don’t have them ourselves.”
There was silence on the other end. Sam and Dean waited, letting the news sink in.
Dean frowned at him. “What do you think you’ll need that for?”
Charlie scoffed. “Dude. I just got here. Wasn’t here last night, either.” She winked.
Dean thought, suddenly unable to speak or breathe properly.
“It’s fine,” Sam insisted, looking up at Dean. “I’m managing it.”
Dean’s heart broke, and he squeezed Cas’ hand instinctively. Cas squeezed back and leaned into him.
