In a way it was universal justice that they would find their perfect movie couple on a crime scene. The walls of the office where two mutilated bodies had bled out, Sherlock deemed the case a seven, had been plastered with cheap copies of vintage movie stills and posters. Instead of being transfixed with the gory injuries of the victims Sherlock stared at a 1960´s picture depicting a barely clothed “man” and a woman in a tight silver bodice-thingy.
“Sound diagnosis, doctor.”
John held the insane position for five seconds before he, unbelievably, pulled his lower body even higher upwards until his feet pointed to the ceiling. Now, John was head down in a handstand. Two tiny globes of sweat dropped from his forehead and fell onto the stage, glistening in the limelight.
Which firstly made John feel truly insulted and secondly turned him into a highly dedicated pole dancing pupil. He´d rather pull a tendon with training every day before giving Sally a reason to say “I knew it”. Toy soldier! The fuck! He´d bloody invaded Afghanistan. He´d show her flabby. He´d show her how well he could dance. He´d show her his already well-formed muscles, too.
“It´s not a dare because it will never come to happen,” Sherlock made a quick calculation, “but you´re on.”
what kind of actions were comprised in “waking up together”. He would have to wait and see and take what he would be given. Like always.
Who had uttered this embarrassing needy whine? Sherlock deduced that it must have been him. Thinking straight proved to have become quite difficult.
John was something special. No doubt there.
“You need it badly now, don´t you?” John inquired, carefully looking neutral.
stuck in every corner of his brain. Yet, where would be the fun if Sherlock would obey immediately? Also, he could not let John have his way too easily since Sherlock had to uphold a facade of keeping the upper hand. Duh!
John rolled off of Sherlock´s back and ogled at the stained sheets with dismay. “Look at the mess you made.” He tried for a stern look but instead broke into a wide grin like that cat that just caught the mouse.
Sally grunted disappointed and had her mouth open again, her lips wet from absent-minded licking. She had hoped, although she knew that the chance would be equalling zero, that there would be nothing under John Watson´s loincloth. But sadly, he wore golden briefs. Damn!
“Glad that you´re glad about that.” At least some of his usual witticism seemed to be returning.
How, like
Sherlock, still held up in the air by John, leant forward and grabbed the pole double-handed. John pushed him into a spin and stepped aside. Sherlock´s lean body made four fast full rotations. He made his torso execute a complicated sequence of movements which let him change position from head up to head down and back again, having to change his grip on the pole often all the while upholding a full side-split with his sinewy legs.
Being sober sucked. Being left alone with his racing brain was pure torture.
Blue. So blue. Ocean blue. Bottomless and eternal and
Angry voices boomed up suddenly, arising from the kitchen. John´s happy bubble of a future boyfriend named Sherlock burst into an annoyed groan. Sherlock and Chris had stumbled over each other. Damn! Of course, that had been bound to happen. Why had John not thought about that earlier? The atmosphere in the kitchen right now must at least be awkward if not plainly hostile and maybe even could turn violent, given Sherlock´s acerbic tone of voice. Shit.
“So good.” John pressed a butterfly-light kiss onto Sherlock´s neck, licking away at the salty drops of fresh sweat.
The sight of his first hook-up last night and the sexual predecessor to John made Sherlock´s joyous mood disappear quickly. He had not thought about meeting Chris again which was of course stupid, after all Chris lived here whereas Sherlock definitely was out of place and an interloper. All of a sudden, he felt terribly awkward and vulnerable. His flight reflex kicked in and he had to take a firm grip on the table to steady his trembling legs.
Achieving fulfilment and completion once more Sherlock climaxed forcefully. He screamed when the tidal wave of arousal broke and it pulled him under and away in a relentless tow out of his mind and far out into the fathomless ocean. He felt his insides constricting, clenching and pinching John´s cock firmly between sweat-slick arse cheeks, in return sending John over the edge, too.
So far, so good.
John realized that Sherlock was unaware of his presence and so he indulged in watching. It felt a bit voyeuristic but there was nothing he had not seen before. So. Yes. Still a bit not good but still so good. Letting his eyes wander downwards John had his gaze linger at the taut and perfectly rounded arse cheeks. He remembered the feeling when his fingers had kneaded the skin and had drawn panting gasps of lust from Sherlock´s mouth. The feeling of hot tightness when his middle finger had invaded the body, venturing forward into unknown territory, probing for hidden creases in the soft flesh until he had found the prostate. He remembered the way Sherlock had keened when he had pressed the tip of his finger against the sweet spot deep down in the rectum.
Or Sherlock would willingly have left his latest fuckbuddy´s bed of his own volition once he had been able to disentangle himself from the sheets, find his strewn around clothes and the front door without falling over while coming down from his latest hit. Sometimes he failed to find back to his own dingy bed and collapsed somewhere on the way in between.
for a bit longer and for once not in a sexual way.
“Fuck you!” Chris shouted and his face had become an unhealthy red colour. A vein pulsed at his forehead.
“Just promise me to really think about kicking the habit.” John pleaded, this time giving the bony shoulder a firm squeeze to emphasize how important it was to him.
“I know,” Sherlock mumbled, adding and sounding a bit lost, “thanks.”
And with that, John finally cupped Sherlock´s groin firmly. He groped and prodded the testicles, feeling how they moved and slightly constricted within the scrotum, making Sherlock hum blissfully.
Sherlock spun around and faced a disgruntled looking Christopher. The chemistry student was bleary-eyed and obviously hungover. Chris scratched a hand through his messy hair and yawned so widely that Sherlock thought he could see right down to the tonsils.
“Want me to call you a slut?” Vigorous nodding followed and was accompanied by a hitching sigh. “Because that´s what you are,” John sneered.
Good heavens, Sherlock had riled John senseless with his bratty behaviour and goaded him into fucking this intruding mouthy punk roughly. Obnoxious as ever, Sherlock had really gotten under John´s skin and as a result had been thoroughly worked from behind. To punish the shameless cockslut who refused to leave the bed and let John sleep. And boy, had that been sensational.
to me.“ John grinned deviously while licking his lips, making a show of it. A feral smile promising an abundance of depravity. The spit-glistening lips reduced what was left of Sherlock´s thinking abilities to a mere baseline.
“See, now you´re heartlessly kicking me out of your bed, too.”
Wait, blonde? Something was amiss with the colour.
John imagined him trailing the porcelain skin with his fingers, following the path the soap bubbles had set. He longed to touch the skin, feel its softness, explore the top of the angular pubic bone and bury his hand in wiry hair, tickling the curls down there and simultaneously put his other hand in Sherlock´s top hair, stroking and pulling by turns.
In the night directly following the performance a total of six children would be conceived with at least one parent being a Yarder. One baby was actually baptized “Sherlock” although only for the middle name. The girl would become a famous ballet dancer.
“Work for it, filthy whore.”
Sally meanwhile was very proud of the new moniker because her creation included the word “defeat” as well as portrayed Sherlock´s killjoy-ry (she was not quite sure if that was a word but it just fit so well) and strutted around proudly for several days.
Instead of leaning backwards in a pose of rejection as Sherlock was dreading, John slid his hand over the table top to cup Sherlock´s long fingers. “I won´t lie and tell you that I´m O.K. with that.” John searched for eye contact but Sherlock looked away and gnawed at the ring in his lower lip.
Chris shot Sherlock a suspicious look. “These hickeys on your chest are not mine.”
Then came The First Incident which raised the stakes.
It is what it is.
“Is that news to you?” Feeling safer now that there were no physical repercussions coming at him to be afraid of, Sherlock felt emboldened and quickly regained his aloof manner.
Consequentially, Sherlock had stayed.
“I´m at least a dress-shirt,” Sherlock quipped, quickly regaining his cockiness, “by Westwood.”
“So, here´s the end coming,” Sherlock thought sadly and hunched his shoulders, trying to brace himself for the upcoming, hopefully only verbal, blow by closing his eyes. He did not want to see John´s face looking at him with hate.
When John became pissed over all the comments concerning the video cramming the inbox of his blog (although they were mostly very flattering) he marched down the seventeen steps and confronted Mrs Hudson with an irritated “You´ve been YouTubing!”
Because the Yarders also did not know two very important facts. Sherlock sustained the strong opinion that the Yarders did not know
Oh, yes!
He arched his back and pressed his arse against John´s hot and unrelenting cock, already gasping with lust. He felt the muscle fluttering with each shove in anticipation of sweet orgasm. Sherlock licked his lips over and over again until he thought he must lick the skin away to only leave a bleeding mess behind. He needed to come right now, knowing he would never be able to feel comfortable again without the throbbing length of John´s inside, claiming him, owning him. Loving him.
“Why would I do all the work while you bone idle horny ho just lie there enjoying me?” John pinched Sherlock´s arse cheek firmly, making him squeal in equal parts of pleasure and indignation.
Hopefully, John would not have changed his mind about having Sherlock around.
Sherlock bucked his hips once more but still found no friction. Tears of frustration ran down over a flushed cheekbone and dropped over the edge of his angular jawline. His eyes stung and he pleaded “Need you” into the void while he sobbed.
A second wave of shocked silence surged through the audience. No one, not one, of the Yarders could have imagined their notorious Consulting Detective to dress like this. And look like he had ever been meant to be wearing… that.
Sherlock had thrown himself over the man´s midsection to pin him onto the ground and John was in the act of aiming his gun to keep the killer from writhing. The murderer caught both of them by surprise when he suddenly had a penknife in his hand. There was no hesitation in his eyes when he stabbed Sherlock directly into the abdomen.
Sherlock shivered with excitement. Finally! Water ran over his exposed cock. Steam was clouding his vision, also blood pooled in his head from being bent over the tub. He had the weird perspective of gazing up at his own cock from down under and upside down. His painfully hard erection touched his belly. The water trickled along his scrotum, drops falling off and nearly hitting his chin.
Sherlock let his upper foot be set on the pole by John and bent his torso far to the front until he could grab the metal with both hands besides his foot. That way, he formed a V-shaped gap but still maintained the front split.
“Pole dancing”: Competitions are often divided into “pole sports” which focuses on the acrobatic performance and “exotic pole” which features more erotic movements.
“So, this is what you´ll do? Feed me up?” Sherlock asked.
A wave of pride over remembering the name flushed Sherlock´s mind. Last night he´d hooked up with
“I don´t care because that will never happen.”
? John the medical student, coming home tired after a shift in hospital and finding his bed, his decent and clean bed, being occupied with Sherlock who was neither clean and had never been decent in the first place. Moreover, who had also just been buggered by John´s flatmate an hour ago and clearly showed the remnants thereof.
The men in the audience winced. Another split! A front split this time. That looked so damn painful in a very delicate area. The women catcalled and tried in vain to hide goggling at Sherlock´s groin. That ribboned panty was so tiny. How could it keep its content firmly in place? Maybe it would fail and slip now… one could still hope.
“Because I want you to,” Sherlock quipped cheekily. His cock was getting cold bereft of John´s body heat. Still, it spasmed when John called Sherlock “horny ho”. So inventive with the name-calling again!
John simply wanted
The assigned catering service had built up a really impressive buffet and faint music was playing in the background of the largest conference room available where a stage with a gleaming metal pole had been set up. Someone had put pink sticky notes depicting Sherlock´s head onto the device.
In his bedroom, John had kept staring for a while at the spot where Sherlock´s delicious bum had just disappeared around the corner of the door, lost in thought. Sherlock was really something else. A tough and spiky shell hiding a soft and delicate core.
John was pissed at Sherlock making the bet without asking him first. He was in it as well. Even more, now the yarders were upon them like a pack of dogs already sniffing the hares. Sally´s bet had spread like a wildfire and everyone was eager to be the one to call out Sherlock. There were five months left to Christmas but in the end nothing really had changed because the couple had already agreed to never show their status as lovers while being with NSY. Still, the long time span they would have to bridge worried them anyway.
“Never pegged you as a romantic”
“Lick,” John rasped, “and make it drip.”
Every sinewy muscle was pulled tight in this position, clearly visible under Sherlock´s skin which was pulled tight over his porcelain white lean limbs, not one iota of fat anywhere to be seen. His chest heaved with the exertion.
Sherlock looked fearfully at John who felt the thin body trembling against his firm hand. “You stay right here with me.” John commanded and steadied Sherlock in a tight hug before he gently shoved him towards a chair, making him sit down.
Chris glared at him.
to make it stop.” Sherlock grinned deviously.
Sherlock shivered when he felt John stepping up behind him into the shower. John´s skin was dry for several seconds before the water wetted his belly and chest and Sherlock felt the erection which jutted out, now hard in front of John´s body. He pushed back to achieve more skin contact. The hardness gave him security and grounded him.
“Answer me!” John ordered and Sherlock noticed he had not spoken out loud.
“What will you do if I catch you making out with John at a crime scene?” She challenged.
A kind face with a peaceful expression, mouth slightly opened to exhale warm puffs against Sherlock´s skin. Smiling the dopey half-smile of a person being quietly happy. Completely unaware of being watched and utterly relaxed. Strong nicely toned arms and shoulders without the useless amassed muscle of a true gym rat. Beautiful. The man was beautiful. Sherlock wondered what colour his eyes had.
Sherlock.
Epiphany hit Sherlock when he slightly raised his head and saw a man lying diagonally across his torso. That weight had made Sherlock feel so heavy and even more also feel safe. In a way even
for go to waste.” Sherlock coughed, mumbling something resembling “pea” and “windpipe” while John continued, “Could make a vital difference for future criminal-chasing.” Sherlock nodded eagerly along and John was able to hear his relieved sigh.
As it turned out, John did not have to worry too much on how to keep Sherlock from getting bored in between cases.
Purely by accident, Sherlock had grabbed the soap too hard, letting it fly in a high arc right out of his hand and over the edge of the bathtub. It landed with a dull smack on the bathmat. John fell out of his bubbly daydream and blinked, momentarily uncomprehending.
Sherlock was delighted when John proposed that idea although he tried to side-track him. The Master Deducer shammed to only grudgingly comply and claimed it would be substantial to ensure the suitability of the costumes in a “real-life environment” before he eagerly went with it.
When they were training on their own, Mrs. Hudson often joined them. She could not help much with showing them how to do the actual physical tricks but was very efficient at making their performance better. How to hold themselves, how to move more gracefully, how to flirt with the audience and exude an air of untouchable eroticism.
“My turn to get you all hot and bothered,” John whispered into Sherlock´s ear who suddenly shivered, feeling breathless already and aching for more. Much more.
“Back again to the cockiness then,” he thought. Sherlock´s rumbling baritone really did it to him. That timbre would make him do anything, maybe even shoot someone for Sherlock. If he had a gun.
Sherlock suppressed a flinch and put the mugs onto the table, trying to get away from Chris. He reverted to poignant sarcasm. “Congratulations, your power of observance is truly excellent given your hungover state.”
“Well, I promised John to make tea.”
John instantly knew Sherlock was lying. He saw the insecurity and vulnerability in Sherlock´s posture and his heart clenched with pity. What had they done to him that he was so brutally fragile under all this put-on cockiness? Sherlock was more bark than bite in order to defend his poor heart behind a wall of vitriolic “I don´t give a fuck” attitude.
A drug addict currently being high as a kite and probably not of sound mind, probably unable to consent. John had been worried of taking advantage of Sherlock. What an endearing personality trait. Being considerate of someone who should be worth shite for behaving like he did. John had insisted on using a condom for protection, too.
John exhaled a breath which he had not known he had held. “Thanks for your honesty. This is more I would have hoped for. Much more.”
John interrupted Sherlock´s demands by sternly pushing the probing hand away. “When did I allow you to finger my hole?”
“Hmm.”
Sherlock started to rock against the most welcome intruder as far as he could, lying prone on his back. “I´m ready, John,” he whimpered.
The anxious tone of John´s voice made Sherlock startle. He did not know how to deal with that genuinely meant question so he called out “I´m fine” from under the spray, looking towards John standing in the doorway and pretending to look genuine. He felt pathetic.
John was a caring person by nature, no surprise given his intention to become a doctor. John loved to take care of people and although he might just have punched the git last night, Sherlock also had wormed himself into John´s heart, carving out a large space there to nest in with astonishing easiness.
The rumbling baritone voice sent a tingling bolt of arousal right into John´s brain. He moaned and reciprocated with pressing himself firmer against Sherlock´s cock, trapping his hand between their bellies. Sherlock´s hands came around and grabbed John´s behind. His long fingers were easily able to cup the taut flesh and pull apart the arse cheeks. One hand moved on and the tip of Sherlock´s index finger ventured boldly forward to find an already relaxed and pliant ring muscle. He let his blunt fingernail linger on the verge of John´s hole, not yet inside but also not fully out. He applied feathery soft touches, making the muscle ripple in shivering constrictions and making John gasp with lusting for being entered.
“Wrong answer,” John stated coldly, “you´ll only get my cock if you have
Just like this they fell asleep once again, waking up about fifteen minutes later, feeling refreshed and invigorated by the short nap.
“Yesssss.””
“That´s so you, Freak, to sneak upon us only to be able to humiliate us!” She fumed and threw a death glare at Sherlock. “What a cheap trick to
Some days later at the Yard´s cafeteria he overheard Sally making fun of how that “bumbling beanpole” and the “flabby toy soldier” would fail to dance and utterly embarrass themselves.
The tugging drove Sherlock mad with desire. He keened and wished for a chance to gain release of the mounting pressure down below. He felt his cock starting to leak and twitch almost painfully, ramping up on its way to orgasm but there was not enough tension yet. Then John, mean John, tantalizing John, removed all friction down there by getting onto his hands and knees. Only John´s mouth was left in contact with Sherlock who blinked upwards through welling tears of a denied built-up to orgasm.
“Oh doctor, I fear my condition is contagious,” Sherlock breathed into John´s ear.
John hurried down the stairs about to storm into the kitchen. He had a strong urge to protect and rescue Sherlock, although the moron currently did his very best to earn the punch he would undoubtedly receive. Jesus, why did he have to brag with John´s hickeys on him? Did he have no sense of self-preservation? John ground his teeth.
The acrobatic side has fascinated me for some time now, accidentally started by seeing a spinning pole performance to a David Bowie song called “Lady Grinning Soul” on YouTube. Awesome!
“What?” Sherlock retorted, irritated by the disruption of their scene.
“Yes, oh my Captain.” Sherlock acquiesced, performing a mock salute.
He struggled to hold his head up high and was about to take the first step towards the kitchen door in order to leave the place when John suddenly entered. Sherlock froze in mid-movement. Icy tendrils of shock coursed down his spine and his heart pounded in a frantic beat.
Sherlock and John had been together as a couple for quite some time now. They had already been living together, they had been solving crimes together and when they finally got over their shared awkwardness to confess their love for each other they had become a couple.
Could John read his mind?
“You´ll only orgasm if you make me come first and,” tugging curls once more and squeezing Sherlock´s cock, John continued, “you
Chris snorted. “Why would John have sex with someone like you in the first place,” shaking his head in disbelief, “he´s a decent bloke and not into one-night stands with measly junkie punks.”
John quickly gave in.
Struggling with his viscous thinking process, Sherlock recalled the syringe he had used in the loo of the club yesterday. Judging by the slanting beams of rosy sunlight invading through the shutters of John´s window the fix must have happened about ten hours ago. Too long. Meaning it was time for the cocaine bugs.
Becoming sober really sucked.
“I think I´m falling for you,” John mumbled through the sound of running water, pressing a soft kiss against Sherlock´s neck.
John sighed contently. “Will you make us tea and toast? I´m rather hungry but have to clean the bed first.”
“Blimey! Is there a cure for my condition?”
John got hold of Sherlock´s birdlike thin wrists, grabbed them and led them upwards beside Sherlock´s head. The unresisting hands were captured in place on the mattress when John slowly raised his upper body to loom over Sherlock who blinked owlishly upwards from his prone position. Mouth open and cheekbones flushed with arousal and anticipation. John´s lower body rocked repeatedly forwards, building up friction while bumping his dick against Sherlock´s balls, making his cock fully hard in an embarrassingly short time span.
“You want my cock?” John hummed when Sherlock nodded and replied in that fucking sexy dangerous voice again. “Why should I facilitate your lazy arse?”
The 221b couple kept pole dancing on a regular basis, greatly enjoying the work out. They often had racy sex afterwards.
Sherlock´s put-upon look of terrible suffering made the laugh John had stifled before now break through. He fell out of his role and asked, amused and a bit uncomfortable, “Are we really doing this?”
Sherlock. Denying himself the pleasure, procrastinating it was sweet torture. His upcoming orgasm was mounting quickly.
Sherlock had ever more difficulty in complying with John´s command not to come and not to touch himself. John obviously enjoyed watching him and his erection stood firm and flush. And yet he was still denying both of them their orgasm. Sherlock needed John´s cock right now. He had to change the game to finally get what he craved. Namely getting fucked from behind.
“You´re something else,” John whispered, “I´m so happy you´re still here.”
Utterly unimpressed, Mrs Hudson just gave John a conspirative look and raised one eyebrow “So? You´ll better work
“Fuck, yeah.” John locked his eyes with Chris´ who averted his gaze, feeling uncomfortable.
Chris only snorted but Sherlock tore open his eyes, visibly shocked. After two seconds of heavy blinking he lunged forwards, running around the table and trying to squeeze past John who would have none of that and deftly caught Sherlock´s upper arm, holding him back inside the kitchen.
If John wanted him, too. Hope bloomed in Sherlock´s heart and that frightened him tremendously.
Everything was fine.
Chris seemed to have a bit of a problem to process what he heard but then the penny dropped. He contorted his face and moving closer, he sniffed at Sherlock who in return took a step back.
The gravelly cadence in John´s voice and that relentless expression on John´s face and the musky scent of John´s body threatened to drive Sherlock mad with desire. He wanted to scream, unable to withstand the temptation of giving in, to submit, to acknowledge John´s predominance.  Dying right now seemed to be the only possible way to get out of the inhuman tension John was building up so effortlessly.
Sherlock´s panty failed to slip and did not fulfil the women´s dreams. Damn!
The freeze frame picture of both men perched inverted on the pole, upholding an athletically insanely taxing position was too much for the audience. Wild clapping washed like a tidal wave through the mass of rapt watchers. Catcalls and whooping sounds visually pierced the atmosphere like sharp knives ready to draw blood.
Chuckling, both men turned to sip their tea. John watched Sherlock blowing onto the steaming liquid and finding himself longing to bite these sensual delicious lips which moved to pucker so sinfully. Sherlock for once was totally oblivious to the scrutiny he was under. John was marvelling in the pale glow of the skin which contrasted beautifully against the reddish tint these lips had taken on when touching the hot liquid.
Until the day when Sherlock forgot his mobile on a crime scene after leaving the hallway where the body lay in a huff because Anderson had been his usual stupid self and Donovan her usual rude “freak-calling” self. When Sherlock returned to fetch his phone he saw them both in a tight embrace. Anderson was groping Donovan´s behind having shoved his hand deep down into her jeans while she had shoved her tongue deep down into his throat in what definitely was an attempt to lick at his tonsils. They emitted sounds of lust, moaning and grunting loudly.
“You´ll be my drug then?”
What would happen now, when the fire had died? With Sherlock coming down and John having regained full control over his brain. Would there be something left of last night´s fire?
John gasped, momentarily surprised but adjusting quickly, he followed the playful course Sherlock had laid out. “What ails you today, patient of mine?”
On his way to the painstakingly clean bathroom and while turning on the taps the happiness over the budding relationship with John slowly seeped out of Sherlock´s brain whereas the cravings forced themselves into the foreground. As soon as he lacked John´s distracting presence the cocaine bugs left their homes under his skin and started to crawl around, making Sherlock develop a fresh sheen of sweat.
“You´re succeeding… oomph,” Sherlock´s try at a cheeky comeback fell a bit, or maybe rather completely flat because John bit his earlobe with just the right amount of pressure to hurt sweetly.
“Phew,” Chris exhaled, “it´s like you´re… wearing my hand-me-down jumper.”
The loss made Sherlock whine and more tears welled in his eyes, burning with salt. He felt his hole constricting, trying to keep hold of something precious but that was already gone. The sensation was cruel. Just when Sherlock thought he was going to beg John ordered him again.
Maybe some of you readers (thanks for that, by the way) have been wondering if I know how to pole dance myself. I don´t but really wish I were able to.
“You´re already gagging for it, don´t you?” John asked in a low voice. A
Sherlock was depraved and reprobate. He revelled in his unabashed horniness. He really completely got off on being called names. He did not care if the other truly meant what he insulted Sherlock with. He liked being debased and humiliated and treated roughly. Getting fucked by a faceless stranger.
“I´d never be anything but.”
“I´m sitting right here, you know?” Sherlock interjected, still getting ignored and squirming in his seat.
Watch at least this one: Ashley Fox 2018 US National Pole Champion, she performs all the moves I discribed above and much more. Absolutely stunning! https://
“It is.” Sherlock smiled.
“Want the rough treatment like yesterday?” John watched closely when Sherlock consented with heavily lidded eyes and a short nod. “Say if you want me to stop, will you?” John scrutinized Sherlock´s face attentively, having become utterly serious.
“Fuckyeah,” John whispered, “you OK?”
John sighed, snapping himself out of his reverie and started to strip away the soiled blankets. He put on fresh ones, working distractedly while he mused over Sherlock´s personality. The punk was really smart as well. No, he was frighteningly intelligent, much more than was obviously doing him any good given his need to distract his ever racing brain by dosing it with cocaine.
The crowd moaned. There was cheering and screaming but some also made barfing noises. Cameras clicked. Again. John and Sherlock indulged for a while before they both made a show of licking their lips, then sneering at the Yarders and simultaneously flipping them off.
Considering his predicament for a moment, John had to acknowledge that Sherlock was right. The wanker. “Oh god, yes,” he admitted, still feeling slightly awkward.
“I´m not certain. I´ll have to do an examination first.” John managed to keep a straight face this time. “Check if everything is still fully functional.”
Chris frowned, visibly trying hard to think and failing. “You´re half naked. Why do you only wear those tattered jeans?”
“Bah. Tell you what, I´ll make a cuppa, you make the bed, we drink the tea, then I´ll take a shower, preferably together with you.” Sherlock disdainfully sniffed at himself, “I´m sticky all over and I reek.”
“God no! Did you hear him talk? He´s a good fuck but a true arse. Nothing more.” Chris exclaimed, ignoring Sherlock as well.
The ear kept on burning long after Sherlock had left the kitchen and John pondered what he had gotten himself into with this man. Most probably Sherlock would be the cause for John´s premature death. Pity.
Delighted cheers washed through the audience and a lot started to hoot wildly.
“Here is my Barbarella”, John announced.
Employees in gaudy Christmas jumpers (such as not even John Watson would deign to wrap himself in) milled around and quickly raided the food like a swarm of giant locusts. Soon everybody was clutching plastic glasses full of the legendary and fast-acting Christmas punch. They affectionately called the swill “Head Punch” for very good reasons concerning next day´s aftermath.
Mrs Hudson was over the moon. She became as excited as a three-year-old on their first Christmas. She ogled longingly the shiny virginal metal pole and deftly cursed her hip which prevented using it herself in commemoration of the olden days when she´d been an exotic dancer in Florida. A very erotic dancer, too. She had been very bendy back then.
When Sherlock woke up the
The picture shown on the screen behind the stage would be this still from the 1968 movie “Barbarella” and can be found here:
“Could not immediately promote you to General, now could I?” Saying that with a mischievous wink, Sherlock got up. He deliberately passed by very closely behind John´s chair, making sure to accidentally let his stiff cock rub against John´s upper arm.  Bending down, Sherlock whispered into John´s ear which had become bright red at its tip, “I´ll make sure to
Sherlock giggled and threw the pillow back at a dazedly looking John whose head had taken on an unnatural red colour.  John flipped him off and Sherlock laughed delighted and sashayed out of the bedroom. Leaving a stunned John behind who could only stare at the arse he had buggered just mere twenty minutes ago. John´s cock reannounced itself with a hefty twitch. Bugger!
Secretly, a lot of the women but also an astonishingly high amount of men also looked forward to see Sherlock or John (or both) partially naked. Hopefully so because both men were really good-looking on the outside. One could only guess what kind of body that Belstaff or these cringy jumpers hid beneath.
Sherlock became jittery about the whole thing. A nervous twitching was starting to rise under his skin, making his muscles tremble. Well. Coming down from his fix just had announced itself forcefully.
The golden fabric of John´s loincloth dropped onto the powerfully bulging quadriceps of his upper thighs. Since he was positioned sideways to the audience, the watchers also got a full view of John´s very plump and very taut butt.
“Fuck, you´re just incredible,” John sighed reverently.
Firstly, John had been working out a lot. He was very fit and ripped at the moment, he was strong and had trained a lot on muscular endurance. You wouldn´t see all the strength because John covered his upper body in these wide and comfy woollen jumpers. He would be able to learn some physically challenging tricks on the pole and impress the Yarders with his high body tension.
“Why are you still here?”
The crowd gasped again. The women were jealous and imagined to be groped by John like Sherlock was. The men were jealous, too and imagined to grope someone like John did while sporting such a six-pack. Some men also imagined to be Sherlock and longed to be groped by John instead.
Which had been doubly ungrateful on Chris´ behalf because firstly, he had very much enjoyed Sherlock´s mouth spewing salacious innuendo and secondly, had even more enjoyed this dirty mouth sucking his cock until it was hard enough to be put up Sherlock´s arse.
Did the embers still glow when he was sober?
Sherlock also managed to finagle a deal with one of Great Britain´s top female competitive pole sport champions to give them private lessons two times a week and create a professional choreography for them. Sherlock claimed that she owed him for helping her with a case two years back including drugged toothpaste and dangerous tampering with a spinning pole. John was beyond asking for details at that point. Sheila turned out to be a very good and professional dancer/teacher and also was funny on top. She had the body of a circus acrobat and could do tricks on the pole which defied gravity.
“Obviously not. I´m surprised, too.” Sherlock mumbled and wanted to immediately kick himself for admitting his astonishment.
Did that really happen right now? “Gathering more data for a reliable outcome is always preferred.”
“Fuck you
. Are we clear?”
John finally rushed into the kitchen, making Sherlock flinch badly and Chris stare dumbly at him. Sherlock looked about ready to dash out of the room, embarrassed and shocked.
“I don’t know,” John pondered, “guess we´ll have to do it again?”
“I´m full of surprises.” Sherlock deadpanned.
The disdainful comment stung more than Sherlock would have believed to be possible. His insecurity peaked once more and the rising anxiety told him to just leave the kitchen and walk out as long as he was able to remember John´s kind expression while looking onto him this morning in bed. Fearing that John´s gaze would turn into the contempt Sherlock actually deserved. Before Chris´ half-assed comments would open John´s eyes concerning the vile person Sherlock really was.
“If you did not guzzle all this junk food, you could also have such a beautiful slim body like Sherlock does,” Philip retaliated Sally´s former taunt with a leering gaze at Sherlock´s lean thighs. Sally was too uncertain what to think of this remark to feel insulted right now. Philip was ogling the Freak´s body? And enjoyed it? That was utterly disturbing.
“I want you, John.” He swallowed. He liked being ordered by John. His cock certainly did.
Sherlock rolled off the culprit and fingered disbelievingly his uninjured and blood-free stomach. John leapt forward and knocked out the culprit with the hilt of his gun. Greg and Sally ran around the corner and, slithering to an awkward halt, saw the three men in a freeze-frame picture lying in a twelve-limbed heap on the ground.
Sherlock would never experience anything like being treated with respect or even loved.
“Hello doctor, did you finally make it to our appointment?” Sherlock purred.
Shocked into sudden speechlessness, John only managed some goldfish-like gulping movements and watched disbelievingly when she turned on the heels of her orthopaedically recommended slippers and quietly shut the door of 221a.
John instead was a good person. Decent and genuine. He had cared about him last night. John had fucked him really good, after Sherlock had riled him up like hell. He had actually goaded John into having sex with him but nonetheless, John had asked if he had been able to truly consent after seeing the track marks which marred the delicate skin of his forearms.
Sherlock involuntarily emitted a loud sound of pure disgust.
voice.
“Always so considerate,” Sherlock quipped, “but I will, I promise,” he added in earnest and smiled fondly at John who was really someone special. So good to Sherlock. John really
“You´re so mean!” Sherlock shouted, riding on a wave of arousal which was about to break every fucking second, threatening to pull him under, to drown him in lust, in longing for John´s cock to be finally, finally shoved up deep into his arse. Sherlock wanted to be claimed, to be owned and most of all to be
“No. You´ll have to
“I´m not a jumper!” Sherlock piped in, insulted and pouting.
Then came The Second Incident which toppled the stakes.
Sherlock was half aware that his random thoughts were fractured and influenced by the upcoming withdrawal symptoms but still, thinking about John proved to be distracting enough to get over the mounting itch of his skin and the onset of the slight tremor in his fingers. He was so lost in his thoughts that he totally overheard the sounds John made when he opened the door to the bathroom.
They cherished their secret and kept all the others in limbo of not-knowing. They felt very smug about that. Until that one day when fate decided to out them.
Sherlock flinched and hesitated to answer for such a long time that John already feared he had overstepped and pressed too hard. That Sherlock would close up, retreat and completely stop talking about his drug issue.
. Meanwhile everyone had been informed about the pole dance performance and most of the staff had been getting more and more excited in anticipation of cashing in the lost bet. A lot of them hoped that the Consulting Detective would utterly humiliate himself and that they would be able to mock him relentlessly and retaliate him for his general obnoxiousness and vitriolic tongue.
John collapsed onto Sherlock´s back and just lay there motionless for several minutes. John´s body moved with Sherlock´s heaving breaths, feeling every shuddering inhale against his belly and in return panting forced gusts of moist air against Sherlock´s sweat-slicked neck.
Some of the men watching could not bear the sight anymore. That surely had to be achy as fuck? Better to concentrate on Watson now. If one only could have these gorgeous muscles, too. Why did Watson always hide this chest under shapeless woollen jumpers?
Thingy!
He had not meant to reveal
” Sherlock shouted while John added, “and fuck your bet.”
Which threw Chris for another mental loop, “Wait, What? John didn´t kick you out post-sex?”
“A pathetic,” pinching Sherlock´s swollen nipple, “prurient,” a sharp slap to his arse, “little cockslut!” and John flicked a forefinger against Sherlock´s swollen bellend to underline his put-on displeasure.
John suppressed a smirk, trying for a serious doctoral expression. He nodded his head in thoughtful understanding, “I see. To me it looks like a case of severe horniness.”
“That´s unexpectedly kind of you,” Sherlock actually blushed, “but I promise.”
“Stop it, now!” John shouted.
In real life most of what I let John and Sherlock perform on the pole is definitely not suitable for beginners even if both are physically very fit in this fanfic. They would have to practice much longer than only some weeks to manage these tricks. The author would just love to see them both do that and so here we are. Sue me.
Rising on his toes, John struggled to kiss Sherlock on the mouth. “You´re far too tall.”
No. Just, no.
Sherlock, unused to such loving endearments, heard a soft moan escaping his lungs. His cock twitched eagerly. It was… good.
“John, take me from behind. Fill me up with your cock and…”
“You only had shitty relationships then.”
The bed was nice, too. Warm, soft and cosy with the heady scent of past sex. His sex.
John had cradled Sherlock´s face in his hands, kneeling above him and emitting cooing noises while Sherlock looked wide-eyed and scared up at John, grabbing John´s shoulders respectively.
Sherlock had been inattentive and John had let go of the ring piercing in the meantime. Now even that pitiful remain of contact with John was gone. Cold air hit the once caressed skin and Sherlock shivered, feeling mercilessly left alone. John had sat up, now straddling Sherlock´s slender hips with strong thighs and giving him a stern look full of determination.
John had found a ticklish spot and was planning on using this knowledge wisely in the future.
“That´s all what you´re concerned about? Being compared to a jumper?”
“You´re my One,” Sherlock shouted, feeling defiant, “let´s do it!” and the music began.
“Just wait, I´ll catch you and John red-handed one day, too.”
Time stood still.
Sally was vibrating with glee although it could also be due to the amount of imbibed Head Punch and she leant close to Philip whose eyes had become looking even more like a weasel´s. He lazily groped at Sally´s backside while she giggled with a dopey smile on her face.
Sherlock knew how to put on a show. Being so blatantly asked for it was really fun. He loved feeling exposed and being watched. Sherlock started lathering his swan like neck, then rubbed the soap over his chest in deliberate slow movements, circling around his nipples and saw John´s cock jumping upwards. He rubbed the soap over his scrotum and shaft, carefully avoiding the forbidden touch with his fingers. Grinning lewdly, he moved his hips to hump the piece of soap, knowing how horny he could make John by moaning in synch with the movement. John´s head flushed with a rosy tint which perfectly matched the deeper shade of red on his fully hard cock. Sherlock humped harder.
Not that he would remain sober for a long time anyway but Sherlock had found out that sex, lots of sex, was a great means to achieve a high like he did when shooting up cocaine. Only that sex was way cheaper, safer and healthier than the consumption of class A drugs. One could not be high on coke all the time. Not even Sherlock.
The sound of Sherlock´s head hitting repeatedly and forcefully against the shower wall made John take in a breath of concern and let him fell straight out his reverie. What was Sherlock doing? John´s protective instincts set in forcefully, giving his presence away with a concerned cry.
Obviously not, he answered his own question seconds later while overhearing Sherlock insulting Chris´ lack of sexual prowess. Yet, John stopped short just around the corner of the kitchen door in morbid fascination. He knew that eavesdropping was more than a bit not good but curiosity got the better of him. He wondered how the verbal sparring would play out.
“I think I could provide such services.”
he actually felt good. Which was completely unexpected.
John found out that he was damned turned on when he watched Sherlock doing spins or sitting in mid-air on the pole, arms extended wide to his side. He always imagined being the pole and wanted to be surrounded by Sherlock´s tightly pressed thighs as well. Could one become jealous of an inanimate object? Obviously, yes.
fall for John. Dangerous territory, indeed. Loving someone would make Sherlock so vulnerable. But he would try for John. This was completely different from all his drug-hazed hook-ups before. With John he would like to stay.
(See the end of the chapter for
Although, thinking about it, John had been very reluctant at first, clearly upset over Sherlock´s request to be called humiliating names. Even more, John had been truly dismayed when he realized that he had pinned a junkie beneath him. The vibrant track marks in the crooks of Sherlock´s elbows told a story of long ongoing abuse.
Sherlock wanted to wear that thingy instantly and was also very keen to have John sporting that glittering loincloth. He would be delectable like that. Sherlock fell into a dream-like state when his blood decided to abandon the brain and went to accumulate somewhere else.
Exactly ten minutes to 9pm a slightly swaying DI Greg Lestrade mounted the stage and the tension in the room suddenly spiked while the air became thick with anticipation. Greg, only slightly slurring, recounted how the bet had come to life and what Sherlock and John would have to do. He trailed off a bit, caught in rambling and not completely focussed on his task because the head-punching was setting in.
John had been considerate enough to care about him even knowing that he was about to shag a worthless junkie. Which was a first and something Sherlock did not really know how to deal with.
Sherlock wanted this moment to last forever. John was perfect. Caring and mean. Dominating and gentle. Accepting but challenging his personality.
“Well, you only woke up once beside me, so we´ll have to make sure.”
Sherlock groused, “Piss off”, but felt warmed inside by the reassuring jibe.
Describing complex movements or postures with words only is really hard. Hopefully you got a good impression of what I imagined. I made a compilation of most of the tricks I tried to describe using images from the internet (not referenced) or from the pole-sports code catalogue:
When was his last hit?
John watched the display in rapt fascination. Entranced by the iridescent soap bubbles which slithered over Sherlock´s marble skin. They glistened in all colours of the rainbow. John trailed a group of miniscule bubbles gliding downwards over wide plains of smooth skin and saw them getting diverted by Sherlock´s navel. A part got stuck in the tiny hollow while the rest split into half to slide further down on both sides of the stretch of tiny dark hair which widened into forming Sherlock´s pubes.
Two days after the Christmas Party a video named “Power and Grace. First ever pole dance of male couple” trended on YouTube. John instantly suspected Sally Donovan to be the one who had uploaded this. Sherlock simply scoffed when John mentioned his suspicion. After one disinterested and half-arsed look at the screen he deduced that their landlady had been the culprit.
like he was something precious. A nicely muscled upper arm firmly held Sherlock´s side.
“I am…” John bit into the marble skin above Sherlock´s jugular vein,
The End
John wanted to caress every single square inch of this body. Lick the milky skin. Nibble at the delicate angles of the skinny body. Swallow the drops of hot water running over the delicious dips of the hip bones. Cherish the bird-like frailty of the collarbones. He would scrape his fingernails softly along the spine, making the skin shiver with the sensuous touch and the…
The niceness had just stopped and
Semen erupted in abundance, held back by the condom but still searing hot inside Sherlock, seemingly burning him to cinders. His own excretions spilled over and formed an equally hot puddle against his belly.
“Good Heavens, Donovan, seeing you and Anderson making out is really the last thing I would plan on,” Sherlock shook himself in a blatantly open way to make his point, “and you manage quite well to humiliate yourselves with all that moaning over a dead body. You accuse me of getting off at a crime scene, really?”
The pirouette ended in an insanely arched back when John caught Sherlock like he weighed nothing at all and dipped his partner deeply, firmly held in golden tanned strong arms.
At first John complained that he had to be so “naked” for training on the pole. He claimed feeling like a stripper and that he really did not want to appear like a hooker while doing that damn bet. Sheila told him that he´d just need all the friction of human skin onto metal he could get in order not to slip off and fall onto his behind. John was stubborn at first and tried with yoga pants but his closed knees were unable to hold him on the pole and let him just slide ridiculously slowly down until he sat stupidly on the ground with the pole still clasped between his thighs. Sherlock laughed his ass off. The next time John practiced with a very scantily cut running short and did much better.
Sherlock locked his eyes on ocean blue irises. He let go of John´s hand and started to caress himself. His fingers danced over his soft belly, drew circles around both nipples, tugged at the piercings. He moaned. The sound was deep and resonating and the lack of air introduced a starburst of white and red sparkling lights in the back of his eyeballs. More adrenaline flooded his blood, the rush similar to cocaine. Oncoming withdrawal was forgotten, securely kept away by the ever mounting arousal. Nimble fingers slid down and came to rest in curly pubic hair, finding the place where his cock emerged. He needed to touch himself, to put pressure and friction where they belonged. He was close to orgasm.
Sherlock discarded the thought. He felt really comfy now. Heavy somehow, too. His mind was reacting sluggishly and he recognized the upcoming need to get a fix. A slight itch started to enfold under his skin. Were the cocaine bugs already beginning to crawl and swarm around? A bit not good, that. Also, something tickled against his naked chest.
Sherlock´s jewel coloured eyes snapped open and he locked his veiled gaze onto John´s lips. He slid out his tongue and licked slowly around his upper and lower lips, resting it on the ring piercing which he moved back and forth several times. Sherlock then sucked the ring into his mouth all the while moaning like he was just having an orgasm. He rubbed his erection against John´s belly and bend his knees a bit to align himself with John´s cock which in the meantime had become as hard and straining as his own.
Sherlock gestured John to come closer and the golden angel walked around his Barbarella and let his hands reverently caress the lean body. Sherlock leant into the touch before he playfully pushed John away with the tip of his high-heeled foot. John gracefully rolled backwards only to jump forward and grab the offending leg. He pressed several kisses along the shin, making Sherlock grin lecherously, before he flexed the leg into a full front split.
“Duh. Not really.” Chris watched awkwardly when Sherlock flopped down onto a chair. “However, that does not explain why you are still here.” He scrunched his forehead, slumping down in a chair opposite and facing Sherlock who had actually blushed.
When John moved his muscles were straining and the veins showed but in a way that told of real functional strength instead of pure pointless bodybuilding mass. A tiny pair of feathery white wings was attached with barely visible flesh-coloured straps onto John´s back. The sight was literally topped with John´s hair dyed in a golden hue. A true angel had descended from heaven above. An Adonis nonetheless.
Was John bi? (Like hell.)
John´s pounding rhythm of torturous movements was already wrecking Sherlock´s brain without even including any touching of his cock which was vigorously twitching, yearning with anticipation to be blessed with some friction, or contact, kissing or, or… anything like at all resembling being acknowledged by any part of John´s body.
She unabashedly nodded and plainly told John “A little retaliation for all the holes you shot into my poor wall. That´s been bugging me for some time now.”
Sally Donovan´s brain decided to choose this moment to quit functioning properly. She did not know it yet but this would also be the very moment when she would quit calling the Consulting Detective “Freak”. She would still keep on hating his guts, of course.
“Are you okay?”
Drops of water from the shower above fell onto their heads, forming a multitude of undulating rivulets which ran smoothly over their bodies, wetting and warming the naked skin. A dozen delicate tendrils trailing over firm muscles and angular bones like the caressing fingers of a benign hand. The water pooled where their groins and bellies touched, letting the skin produce soft smacking sounds when it slapped against the other man´s body. The sensation was arousing and made the skin over Sherlock´s ribcage break out into gooseflesh.
A wet noise was produced when John removed his finger from Sherlock´s mouth, leaving a narrow trail of glistening spit against the perfect cupid´s bow. Sherlock protested with a soft moan but inhaled sharply when John reached his digit around Sherlock´s arse cheek and found his way to the rim of the puckered muscle. John lightly teased the entrance and since there was no real resistance given by the pliant flesh the finger slid effortlessly into the soft tissue.
Sally´s sly voice stopped him. “Wanna bet?”
And then they kissed. Deeply and desperately. Of course, they did not think of losing the stupid bet. All they thought about was having been so close to losing their beloved one.
Sherlock could literally see how the still falling penny in Chris´ mind finally hit the ground when Chris exclaimed, “Oh really, you fucked John right after getting fucked by me?”
Holy Hell! Holy all Dante´s Nine combined and some more hells on top! How could he wear this and, in a lack of a better word, lacking a whole lexicon of words, look simply
John walked behind Sherlock and determinedly grabbed him under the armpits. John lifted him high over his own head into a hold with outstretched arms. Sherlock spread his legs into a side-split and they seemed to go on forever. John whirled two times around the pole, always holding Sherlock high above only supported by John´s strong arms. Sherlock kept being frozen with arms and legs stretched wide. John panted hard when his spins ended, standing facing the pole again with Sherlock between.
Apparently John was in on the game and up to the challenge, too.
“So what? You certainly did not plan on keeping him.” John fixed Chris with a narrow-eyed gaze, ignoring Sherlock completely.
“That’s all your fault,” Sherlock replied haughtily but stroked a thumb softly over John´s lower lip. Seemed as if he was recovering already and quickly discarded all traces of submission and - Heaven forbid - obedience.
Sherlock knew he could fall love with John, no, he definitely
“So, the little ho has slept with you only an hour after shagging me and now he´s still here because you want him to?”
“Would you rather prefer me to run around fully starkers?”
Three months had gone by and John and Sherlock had managed quite well keeping their relationship secret although it had been hard.
“Oh doctor, there is this dreadful pressure in my groin,” Sherlock made innocent puppy eyes, “and my cock is so stiff, it won´t relax.”
“You really want that, do you?” John squeezed Sherlock´s cock with the hand still trapped between their bellies in retaliation, making him squeal.
Sherlock suppressed the urge to slap himself for thinking so slowly. How, like
Sherlock also knew that his personality severely lacked any lovable traits. It was always much easier to let his acerbic tongue have its way and his vitriolic mind eviscerate the people around him. He was well aware he had a beautiful and hellishly attractive body and used his gorgeous looks to draw in his future sex partners. Then he´d more often than not goaded them into fucking him hard as retaliation for acting like the mouthy punk he was.
“And you´re far too thin.” John poked Sherlock under the costal arch. A surprised squeal was followed by John´s hand being slapped away.
“Well, let´s make it a more daring bet then. If you´ll be seen making out with John at a crime scene the both of you´ll have to do something really humiliating, like…” she hesitated and furrowed her brow, thinking hard about something really painful, “…like doing a dance together in front of the Yard.” She grinned evilly.
Philip gnashed his teeth so hard that he could feel a tiny particle breaking off. He chewed shortly on it before swallowing it down and felt utterly wrecked. Holmes´ legs actually turned him on. Well, shit! He´d have to convince Sally to work out and get thighs like these, too.
“Move,” John hissed through gritted teeth, “or I´ll come right now.”
Chris sighed. “I´m off. Meeting with friends for brunch.” He stood and gazed at Sherlock with a mischievous look before turning around to address John once more, now smirking. “Keep my discarded jumper then if he fits you.”
Sherlock Holmes. Crossdressing. On high heels. What the fuck?
in the shower.”
“I will. See you, at 7pm sharp.”
At least Sherlock had woken up in a decent bed this time and had not found himself lying on the filthy concrete of some back-alley. So, no quick sucking-off job behind the club. Obviously. It really was not his favourite place to regain consciousness after his latest sex-escapade.
Anderson was not afraid of levelling himself down onto the mental capacity of a pre-school child in that he always made his mobile play the first chords of Joe Cocker´s famous song “You can leave your hat on” when Sherlock was around.
John buried his nose in Sherlock´s belly and mumbled sleepily under his breath. He was definitely waking up now. Anxiety replaced the guilt. Sherlock closed his eyes and took in a deep breath, trying to calm down and bracing himself for the upcoming rejection. He startled badly when he opened his eyes again only to find John´s blue irises focusing directly onto his own.
Everyone knew what the pole was there for. Yet, no one so far had caught the slightest glimpse of Sherlock or John who were supposed to dance at 9pm and some Yarders were already insinuating that the couple had chickened out of performing, too embarrassed at their upcoming failure.
The all-consuming fire of their mutual arousal had been burning hot with incandescent flames. Fuelled by the drugs, Sherlock´s shameless slutty demeanour and John´s pent-up sexual tension.  Devouring them both.
A spike of pain, delicious and sensual and just enough to be pleasurable shot into Sherlock´s frazzled brain. Making him keen and buck his hips upwards into painful nothingness in unanswered want because
Sherlock´s vision was blurry with moisture when he looked up at John, smiling wildly at the promise of deliverance to come. Wet eyes lingered when John´s cock came into his field of vision, upright and straining against the milky latex shell encasing it. The glans was nearly bursting with blood, coloured in such a deep purple that it shone easly through the layer of the condom. Sherlock hurried to comply and when he lifted his hips to roll around his own stiff and aching cock made contact with John´s, causing both men to experience electric sparks in their groins, forcing them to grunt, guttural and animalistic.
Sherlock needed, hoped, craved to be touched again. All over his sweaty body. Wet lips enclosing his tormented nipple were not enough. By far. He needed more.
After several heavy thrusts, John shouted victoriously and came with a vengeance. He filled Sherlock with semen so hot that it could be easily felt through the latex layer holding it back. The sudden rise in temperature caused Sherlock to finally ejaculate as well, letting out a high-pitched scream. His own cum dripped in viscous pearlescent drops from his belly and tears of pure joy started to leak from his eyes. Sherlock barely noticed when John helped him up, pulled him back under the warm water and held him in a tight embrace like the most precious thing on Earth and panting against his chest.
The Yarders saw the picture lighting up at the screen behind the stage and a disbelieving murmur emerged which quickly evolved into whispered gasps of stunned surprise… had they really dared to dress like that?
“Sex distracts me. Rekindles the embers.”
John strongly disapproved of Sherlock, or anyone, doing drugs and wanted to get him off the addictive substance rather sooner than later. But having lived with his alcohol dependent sister he also knew far too well that mere pleas or reprimands or trying to talk sense into an addict simply did not work as long as the person in question did have no real compulsion to start any kind of change in their behaviour by themselves and acknowledging their need for help.
In the end Sally clapped as ferociously as everyone else in the audience. Sherlock and John stood on the stage, drenched in sweat, panting heavily and chests heaving like giant bellows. They smiled, completely satisfied and took several bows hand in hand, each time throwing the Yarders a kiss. When they exited through the curtain the applause still went on for a long time after they were gone.
NSY´s Christmas party was to be held at the 20
Shaking himself out of his reverie, Sherlock noticed the nice cosy atmosphere of the kitchen. He poured water into a kettle and turned on the cooker. Waiting for it to boil, Sherlock sifted through the various drawers and searched for tea bags, milk, sugar and two mugs. He was so concentrated on his task and also the kettle had begun to whistle loudly that he did not hear when someone else entered the kitchen. The voice which boomed over the noisy kettle made Sherlock startle badly.
The silken straps continued to run down at the side of Sherlock´s upper thighs snuggling against naked milk-white skin until they reached the same silvery fabric above his knees again only to end at his ankles. Fabric which formed skin-tight over-knee length boots ending in pin-point sharp high heels. Black laces crisscrossed over Sherlock´s shins and ended in another black ribbon far above his kneecaps.
“Oh dear, is it fatal?”
The crowd blinked. Ogled. Gaped.
The Yard became adorned in all sorts of thinkable and also unthinkable Christmas decorations. What kind of deranged brain had come up with the idea to put bright red boxer brief-shaped baubles frosted with fake snow onto the giant fir tree in the main hall?
Most of the people watching had expected to see some tacky humping or sleazy rutting moves. A lot had seen strippers dancing on a pole before, “it was at the job when we investigated in a club” the men claimed while the women stated “there was this hen party of my best friend”.
“Oh, great idea, and costumed as a famous movie couple!” Sally completed. “But I guess you wouldn´t dare, Freak.” She glowered at Sherlock again.
Definitely!
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed drily, “although John fucked me to be correct.”
When December came the Yard had become guerrilla-plastered overnight with posters announcing the upcoming dance event at the Christmas party. The poster also showed a badly photoshopped picture with Sherlock´s deerstalker-covered head copied onto a naked male stripper body humping a pole. The groin area had been covered with a pink heart.
John had buried his stately dick up to the balls in Sherlock´s arse and it had been rough and sweet at the same time. Animalistic brutality mixed with considerate tenderness.  A heady mix. A mix to get addicted to and Sherlock had always been prone to addiction. The ensuing sex had been stellar and very productive judging by the amount of residual stickiness everywhere.
