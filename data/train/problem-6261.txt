?  How did you--"
for me to do that.  I'm Tony goddamn Stark."  He fixed Steve with a smile, his usual confident smirk.
true--
Steve opened his mouth to answer.
He was thinking of going downstairs and dredging up some old information on Jarvis.  Poor Jarvis, whose rich history had been lost because Tony had never bothered to think of him as anything more than a butler.  In theory, information about both Jarvis and Steve should be in his father's notes. Tony had boxes and boxes of notes and ledgers and journals and photos he'd never gone through, placed in boxes in the server room, having been stored away for decades and never touched.
Banksy was stretching to peek out the back windows.
"Yes, thank you, I am," agreed Tony.
"I didn't--"
Tony's arms broke out in goosebumps.  He looked up at Steve, locking eyes with him.  Steve's eyes were so clear and sincere... Tony often felt like a terrible person, next to Steve.
.  With your
She settled down on the end of the bed, since there was only one chair in the room.  Tony barely stirred; he nosed the pillow a little. Despite all the bandage changes, some of Steve's neck had dripped onto the pillow; he could smell it.  And even a beta probably could have guessed by the way Tony was clutching it to him. Earlier, in his sleep, he'd been mouthing at it. It was sweet, in a sort of disgusting way.
The tile on the floor felt good.  Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's broad chest and closed his eyes, pressing his cheek onto the cool floor, his breathing ragged.  The panic attack, the fucking, having Aria walk in on them... he was feeling thoroughly worn out, emotionally speaking. And physically, he was definitely hurting.
"...does it hurt?" he asked quietly.  He wasn't talking about the bullet.
Tony pressed against the glass case, ogling the metal.  "Soldered together with gold?" he asked.
"You did great.  I spent all day downstairs, working on the Mark VII and pulling apart the Tesla," said Tony.  "People love you, don't worry.  Hell, one more interview and maybe the Secretary of Defense will get off my back."
"Do what?" He asked innocently, setting his pipe aside.
A three part series. Ms. Wyatt told the class to do a three part art series for their project for finals. The theme? Emotions. The Medium? Anything they so chose to use, as long as it is reasonable.Okay, that was easy.
"Oh my God.  Donner. Just say yes," groaned Tony.
DeSoto smiled.  "Thank you," he breathed.
to compare it to exercise... look, I'm not going to tell you how to treat your own body, Tony. It's your life and it's your choice."
everyone bought two... double profits!"  Eric laughed.
of the Avengers, probably-- would kill him.  His father would rise from the grave and kill him.
"It's safe," said Rhodey, his voice soft.  "It's safe to come, Donner. No one will hurt you anymore.  There are good omegas on the other side who want to help you out."
Tony frowned a little and looked out the window, noticing a couple of signs.  Tony had assumed (correctly) that most of the protesters were Alphas.  But a pair caught his eye:
And now that Tony was ordering him, and not asking, Steve was definitely getting more turned on. The fingers down his spine made him shiver but he resisted the urge to squirm. When Steve had said he wanted to be good for him he'd meant it.
The last one probably only popped up because it mentioned Alphas and omegas, but it was a sharp, startling dent in the news flow about Tony and Steve.  They two of them were so encapsulated in their own world that it was easy to forget, sometimes, there were other people going about their lives without them.  Although the 21st century was clearly more hospitable to omegas than the forties, there were still plenty of instances of violence and discrimination, especially in the poorer, disenfranchised areas of America.  Small, rural communities along with urban ghettos saw their fair share of Alpha-on-omega violence.
"Is that the guy that... that won the auction?"
was the one that showed up.  I mean, Nick assigned me to you--"
"I can't."
The plane was coming in to land so they had to go sit back down. Happy would be driving them to the conference. It was at a very expensive hotel, or so Steve thought. It had looked like a hotel in the pictures. He was finding the whole event very mysterious and confusing.
"Alright, Scuba Steve. Time to head to the living room." Tony spoke, offering Steve his hand to take as he led the other out and back to the couch.
be the favorite once I give him the birds and the bees talk. He'll feel so awkward around me, good god," Tony laughed.
"Okay," Tony replied slowly, "History is important. But he's a science boy. The way technology is moving is more relevant than the Declaration of Independence. Sure, it's important to
"No need to apologize. I actually find myself flattered that you think of me in such a way." Steve hummed, thinking for a moment. "There is still the matter of how you'll save your grade. In lieu of what you just told me, I think I have an idea that'll help your grade and may be within your interests--".
He sighed softly, taking a few sips of his drink before cradling it to his chest.
"Is your life with us that bad that it can't even help make you happy enough to want to keep it?" Steve said at a whisper, trying to keep the hurt from his voice to stay strong in front of Peter.
"What was it about?"
"He's a kid after my own heart," Tony laughed, picking out another blueberry, "And I eat plenty of fruits, fussy pants. I quite like raspberries and blackberries."
one too many--"
"I'll get him," He laughed, patting Steve's thigh on his way over to the nursery.
Steve looked back at Clint and nodded. Clint's grin just got wider.
"Oh my god," Tony laughed, "I don't think I'll get used to hearing you swear. Okay, okay, small rewarding nap, but we do have to move eventually. And we gotta talk about what you wanna do on our little vacation."
"I told you I made you a cake. With you working, I was able to sneak it. Trust me." He smiled at Tony, setting the cake on the table.
"Interesting," Tony murmured, picking up his cup of tea, "Rogers, you writing this down?"
He paused.
Steve was a little nervous for making something Tony's mom would make and then her eating it herself. She'll really get her chance to judge him then.
"Pay attention to me," Tony laughed, starting to run his fingers through my hair, "How long will it take for the paint to dry?"
"Obviously I lock the door so you never see me take off my shirt," he replied, watching Peter skip out of the room, "I'm fine, worry wart. No need to nurse me."
"Paaaaapaaaaa," he wailed loudly.
"Hung'y," Peter replied around his cereal.
"I'll take Sam," Tony grinned, "Since you carry sleeping children better than I can."
think you'd get out of a punishment?" Tony laughed, "You're a smart kid, Pete, but I'm afraid that I'm just a tad smarter than you."
Peter squealed loudly, trying to wiggle his way out.
girls. In case the weird two percent gets us."
DRAMA BOMB!
, not the belt." He said with false worry, leaning at the slight touch, "I guess I shouldn't tell you about the notes we send each other in class..."
Tony sat back in the sand in awe, just staring at the appendage in disbelief.
The baby squeaked back, gently kicking his legs as Steve put him down on the changing table. He reached back up for Steve, whining softly.
“Sylve,” Dodger voiced, giving almost an eye roll in response before going back to nuzzling U.
"Anyway, Captain America and Iron Man decide to take Spiderman under their wing and teach him how to be a superhero." Steve continued. "And so, their adventure begins... As soon as I get to making more adventures."
"My first shot
"I dunno," Tony replied, leaning back to look down at the baby, "Weird. I think I picked him up. I don't-- I don't remember."
"And if I disobey?" Tony looked at his hand and then back at Steve, before reaching down with his other hand.
"Oh my god, sap," Tony snorted, shaking his head, "You're going to be the death of me, I can tell." He sighed happily, kissing at Steve's chest.
"Don't use words like 'slut'. They are demeaning and ugly." He said seriously, slipping in a third finger.
Steve hummed, shaking his head lightly. "Your Daddy is smart. Thinks he's real smart." He sighed, feeling the partial block. He didn't know what he was blocking, but he knew it couldn't be too good. But it didn't seem too bad either if Tony was only partially blocking.
"Okay. Not looking. Wouldn't want to ruin the surprise," he hummed, laying back on the bed and silk sheets happily.
"Eager?" He laughed, wiping the come and spit off Steve's lips.
Steve scrunched his face as the water hit, his hair and front of his shirt all wet.
"Be good for Daddy, okay?" He instructed, waving softly before following Peter.
"Mean. Five points taken from Ravenclaw." He grumbled, body still a bit sore. "Because you're being mean."
He looked to Peter reassuringly, petting the boy's hair.
Steve smiled back softly, lightly playing footsie with Tony as their legs were tangled. "I'm always protective of the people I care for. The bond just intensifies it with you. Plus, you're one of the few left on that list."
He huffed a short breath, curling into Steve's chest.
"Ah, the young Mr. Stark." Schmidt said unamused, shaking Tony's hand quickly before pulling out a handkerchief to wipe it off, "If I remember correctly, your father still holds that title, yes? Haven't heard any of your exploits in the media for quite a while, even."
He turned to grin at Steve, cuddling up to him despite their immense heat.
at the end of
Thank you guys for reading! This will probably be my last bigger fiction until the holidays start. Once this semester of college is over, I will be a free bird until about the second week of January. I might try and work on other ones I started that seemed pretty liked out the gate. It just depends on what strikes me I guess. If you like this fic, check out some of my others! I love it when people read my things and enjoy them~
"You know what." Clint said quietly with a touch of concern he tried to lessen in his tone, eyeing Tony and crossing his arms.
"It's not really a personality--" Dummy beeped at him. "Okay, he has a personality. Sheesh, kid. Don't make me put you in time out."
Tony hurriedly pulled his phone out and snapped a photo, grinning at his boy.
Steve pouted over at Tony, giving him sad puppy dog eyes. Two could play at this game.
"Mm," Peter nodded, hair falling in front of his eyes, "I lub you too." He laid back down on Steve's chest, curling up into his warmth before falling asleep again.
"Wait, I'm lost now." Steve said, furrowing his eyebrows. "Talk about what?"
"I'm taking a guess that those are your assassin friends?" He asked curiously. "They are nice, for assassins."
Tony brought the cuffs up to his mouth, nibbling them open and tossing them on the floor.
He stretched Steve as far as he thought the blond would go before pulling the vibrator and his fingers out, marveling at how his hole stayed open.
"You didn't, um... Are you okay?" He asked quietly, slowly moving to rub gently at Tony's shoulder. "Did I hurt you...?" He said even quieter at a concerned whisper.
"That went... Slightly okay," he muttered.
"You would never end up like your father, love. You are far too good a father in your own right already." He hummed. "You are great raising Peter and you will be great raising the baby when we get the surrogate business settled."
Tony immediately knelt down to wrap his arms around the boy, placing a loving kiss on his cheek.
Once Tony pulled his lips away, he stroked his fingers over the spot of his handiwork, grinning at the soft moan that left Steve's lips as he did.
. I still-- fuck, Steve. It still amazes me that we were neighbors for eight years and didn't even know... we didn't even know."
Tony had set Steve up with one of his smaller t-shirts and a pair of jeans that were tight on him but still hung loosely on the blond. He even had to give him a belt to keep them up! Although a bit baggy, Steve wore it well. It was relaxed and didn't completely constrict the former merman's new legs.
"Okay, okay, okay, calm down, Tigger, lemme unlock the door," Tony laughed, barely able to turn the key before Peter barreled into the room, gaping.
"That was Bucky and Nat. They are wanting to adopt, but they aren't sure if they want one that’s already a little older or have one themselves." He explained. "But they want to borrow the boys for a playdate to see which they could handle."
He set the oven on to preheat and placed the step stool next to him so Peter could help cut the cookies with the shapes. "Which shape you want first, bubba?"
"Other than being sick? Yeah, I'll be okay." Steve answered, eating at his food carefully. "I've got someone taking care of me very well, so that's good." He smiled softly and gave Tony's hand a squeeze. "Are you okay?"
"Mm."
Tony nuzzled into Steve's neck before settling, breathing softly on him.
of a soulmate-- hell, you've seen what Howard did, and
"Meanies!" Peter cried, face completely red, "I don' have a boyfwend
"That’s good to hear, then." Steve hummed, leaning into the touches. "I love when you mess with my hair...I love you."
"Yeah, yeah. Okay..." Steve nodded, wriggling his hips and trying to start a pace.
Tony pulled off and slowly jerked Steve off, leaning up to kiss and nip at his collarbones. It didn't take long to feel Steve tense underneath him, so Tony moved down to quietly lick up and swallow the cooling come on Steve's chest. Licking his lips, Tony settled back down on Steve's chest, humming happily.
"Steve--"
"Yeah!" Peter bounced, Leading Tony to the swings and urging the man to sit in the swing next to him.
Steve listened intently, still a little confused on how a robot could be personified, but he was amused by the thought at least.
He smiled and settled down, pressing a kiss to Peter's curls before letting his eyes slip shut.
Tony sat back quietly in his chair, putting his coffee cup on the table with shaky hands. Drawing his knees up, he clicked the TV off, giving himself a second to process the information.
send her that."
"If we weren't soulmates, and didn't have tattoos for someone else, would you still stay?" He asked quietly.
"You're such a weirdo," Tony sighed, setting Peter down and handing him his backpack so the kid could scurry off, presumably to find Natasha.
"You always taste so good, baby," He purred, letting Steve's legs drop back onto the bed.
"I wuv Sammy, but some things I want ta be jus' for youse, me, and Papa." He murmured.
"Alright. Hit me with whatcha got.".
The boy nodded and gently took one of the sandwiches from Steve, nibbling on it before happily settling back into Tony's chest.
Once they were done with the kitchen, they went about tidying up the living room and guest rooms, eventually putting the last of their clothes in the closet.
the baby?" Tony teased, "You can keep your wheaties, soldier. I'll stick with my little one."
"Another, Rogers."
"He's talking about Cap, Peter." Steve explained lightly. "He is my character like Spiderman is for you and Iron Man is for Daddy."
He sighed, watching the boy mumble and sniffle in his sleep.
harsh."
He smirked into Steve's skin, tapping his fingers over his chest.
He smooched Steve's cheek, gently carrying Peter downstairs to set him in his booster seat. The bear yawned, peeking at Steve through his messy curls.
"I was
"Oh, do you?" Steve said with a smirk, leaning with the smooches. "That's a two-way street, y'know. You just might wear yourself down before we hit my limit."
"Here, I'll show you where it is on display.".
"Right baby. But grownups do sometimes when they get mad or frustrated. Especially Daddy." Steve explained. "But I don't think he realizes how loud he is right now."
"I suppose so. You and Buck can chat a bit. Talk about our little vacation with him?" Steve said with a smirk, kissing Tony gently and kissing Peter's cheeks before heading to the kitchen.
"It doesn't feel good, still." The boy sighed, leaning with Tony's hands. "’Specially when you try to do somethin' good. It makes me feel bad..."
"I don't want do this alone anymore," Tony smiled weakly, reaching out to squeeze Steve's hand, "And I can see that look in your eyes. I made my AI too smart, and he kinda sent Pep a transcript of our conversation, and advised I call her right away."
"G'night, baby." The blond whispered back to Tony with a soft yawn, snuggling them all close as he drifted off to sleep...
"Daddy might compwain," Peter giggled, "He'd wanna fix evreht'ing."
Tony nodded and pushed his empty plate away, downing the rest of the dregs in his cup.
"Maybe more diapers, now that I think of it. Just be careful and drive safe." He smiled gently, leaning up for a kiss to Tony's cheek. "Love you."
He raised an eyebrow at the other, leaning up in his elbows.
"I can hear your stomach growling," Tony teased, pulling cheerios down from the cupboard, "Go ahead and go climb into your place, and I'll bring everything to you, okay?"
Steve nuzzled into Tony's back, leaving loving kisses along his spine. "Happy Birthday. Love you. Such a good boy, sweetheart. So good." He panted, all his touches after gentle and comforting.
"You okay, munchkin?"
"Anything you need for me to do for you?" Steve asked softly, trying to keep his mind on track regardless of Tony wearing glasses. "If not, I'll probably just end up doing things around the house."
Steve stood stunned for a moment until Tony had gone, words finally processing.
"I'm sorry, munchkin. Things were starting to get a little inappropriate for your age." Steve explained softly. "Plus Uncle Clint and Bucky did something that wasn't very nice. They'll be lucky if Santa is nice to them after that so close to Christmas."
"Mhm. Papa told you about our tattoos?" Tony asked, slightly surprised, "Huh."
PAPA--"
He put the items he'd used back on the table, returning to Steve's front to kiss his nose.
started a flour fight, and dropped an egg on the floor,
Steve rolled his eyes lightly.
"I dunno," Peter shrugged, resting his head on Steve's shoulder, "Termina'tuh?"
"Tony, I love you and all, but we know your kinks are weird as
"I'm sure you're right, buddy. He has problems sleeping a lot and stays up working sometimes." Steve hummed as he started making up pancakes and some scrambled eggs. "He also has trouble sleeping when he gets upset like last night."
Peter glanced sheepishly at the floor.
Tony groaned low, pleasure pounding through his abdomen as Steve spoke.
Peter nodded, still a little bleary as Steve carried him into the ice cream shop. He smiled at the array of flavors, sniffling lightly. "I wan' choco-chip cookie doughs wiff m&m's, an' Daddy likes fwench vanillas wiff caramels an' peanuts."
careful with him, Peter. Nothing too sudden." Steve informed, heading towards the nursery with Tony.
Tony pinched his hip lightly, kissing his cheek before stepping out of the shower, drying himself with a fluffy towel. "What should I wear? Fancy or street clothes?"
"Honey, if the help did what I asked to the letter, you're gonna be blown away. Literally
"It's what I'm built to do," Tony hummed quietly, slowly taking Steve into his mouth.
Once on the level of the workshop, Tony quickly typed in the passcode to get inside. His heart skipped, relief coming over him when he saw a big floof of red and yellow fur on the spare couch in the space.
"Don' be upset, lil' bwotha," He whispered, wincing as Sammy started to drool on him.
Tony fiddled with his hands, swallowing the prickling tears in his eyes.
"I was actually thinking the same thing. Clothes would be good." Steve agreed softly, taking Tony's hand as they got up. "And you take the time you need to explain things. I'm not going to judge you for anything. Never judge you, love."
Tony smiled softly, leaning to peck Peter on the cheek before standing up.
"Seems to me he really likes you, Peter." Sharon pointed out happily. "Must know you're gonna be a great big brother, huh?"
talk to him. Set him straight that this wasn't what he thought." He said quietly, taking Tony's hand as they ventured upstairs.
compare our sex life to a marathon," Tony snorted, sitting up, "C'mon, I want wall sex. Or couch sex."
Some alone times, then Peter comes home a lil early.
Peter stuck out his feet, wiggling his toes at Tony playfully as the socks were slipped on. He giggled when Tony played with the toes a little. "Tickles!"
"I couldn' find m'paypah an' Unca C'int wuz busy," Peter teared up again, shaking in Tony's arms, "I jus' wanted Lucky t'be here f'him."
Peter sighed and chowed down his second helping of food, hopping off his chair to put his dishes in the dishwasher.
"Alright. Over dinner."
"Yes, double yes, and honey, I can be
of those things, and you're just a bratty kid, you'll get a lickin' for that. Well, you're getting one anyways, later tonight, but it'd be more severe if you were just being mean out of spite."
"Will you stop being angry for now if I do?" Steve asked, slipping out his fingers, but doing nothing until he had an answer.
"Sadly, she has a point. We say to keep it G, so we should practice what we preach." Steve said softly, biting his bottom lip.
Steve stood his ground, not admitting it of course, but it was a wonder that this creature knew.
"Fanks Papa," Pete whispered, quickly scrawling his name and 'Daddy' on the tag before sticking it and the bow to the gift.
Steve gave a sigh, nodding knowingly before speaking.
"Hey, munchkin." Steve said with a chuckle at Peter's way of speaking when he first wakes up. "Did ya get a little catnap?"
"Cheeseball," Tony smooched him back, laughing, "How did I get stuck with a cheesy soulmate? Hmm?"
old."
Tony's lips twitched into a smile at the touch, slowly waking him up. "G'morning, babe," he mumbled, yawning and snuggling closer to him, "Sleep well?"
"We dids some exercises w'en we wuz s'posed t'be sleepin'," Peter said proudly, then clapped a hand over his mouth when he realized what he'd said
"Whatcha doin', Daddy?" He asked quietly.
"Mhm. Once the kitchen is cleaned up, I'll help you move over," Tony hummed, smooching Peter's forehead, "It won't take much time at all, and then I can show you how to play games on your laptop."
"Oooh, someone's in troooouble," Clint cooed, yelping as Natasha grabbed his ear.
He shrugged then nodded, still curled up in Steve's arms. Peter sighed softly, holding his Daddy's ice cream while Steve stooped to put his own away. Steve sighed, still not liking that Peter felt so bad. Maybe Tony and Sammy could help. He put the ice cream away and headed off to find those two, Peter still cuddled against him.
"It won't mess up your teeth. Uncle Buck is just jealous because he has buckteeth," Tony replied, whisking Peter over to his high chair to give him his binky.
He went to bend over, only to straighten up again.
Peter hid his face bashfully behind the blanket, looking back over to Tony.
"Look, if this is about me switching my major, I just want to say I'm not sorry about it."
Tony sighed quietly, preening under Steve's touch. He purred softly, nuzzling into Steve's hand.
Steve made a small, almost mewling noise from the attentions, leaning forward into the touch before he finally replied.
eager," he teased.
"Tell me what doesn't feel good, bubba. Papa'll try and fix it, okay?" Steve whispered gently, continuing to rub the boy's back.
"Not hurting, promise--"
He went quiet, face carefully blank as he looked at Peter.
Before Tony had gotten the rest out, Peter's book was put away and the boy was snuggled under a blanket and into a pillow. "Well, not quite that comfy--"
"Still stuffy and hot." He murmured, rubbing sleep from his eyes. "I don't get sick too often anymore, but when I do, it hits me hard..." Steve hummed gently, leaning into Tony's touch sweetly. His skin felt nice and cool against his face.
Tony nodded, sighing in relief when his back hit the pillows.
"Collars." Steve repeated softly, then processing the word. "Collars? Like, dog collar type collars?" He asked with an eyebrow raised.
"I'll go out and get it since you were out already." Steve offered, bouncy Sammy gently in his arms.
"EEEWWWWW!" Peter squealed with a giggle as he hid under his blanket.
"I can't wait." Steve said happily, squeezing Tony's hand back with his good hand. "Can't wait to take our little baby home."
Sammy babbled back at them, reaching out to grab Steve's finger. He gently chewed on it, drooling slightly.
Upstairs in the nursery, Sammy stood upright in his crib, bouncing on the soles of his feet; his binky was on the floor outside the crib, making him whine as he tried to reach for it.
He squinted in concentration, carefully bending out Bucky's triceps’ panels.
"I already associate that with sex," he replied, mind whirring a mile a minute, "I just--want it to not be about that."
"I'd like to see you in some sometime." Steve hummed, stretching his neck out a bit more when Tony nibbled. "I'm curious as in who wears it better?" He purred.
He sighed happily and kissed at his husband's sternum, burrowing into his warmth.
"What's this about, Peter? What did we do to get you upset like that?" Steve asked earnestly. "We were having so much fun just before that. Now you're acting like Daddy when he would get into one of his moods."
"I juuuust might think you're handsome, too. And the cutest thing when you're all flustered like this." The brunet admitted, hoping Steve couldn't feel how rushed his heartbeat was. "Did after the first few times we met and still do honestly, despite the circumstances. Wish you didn't have to go to the length you did, but I am glad I have more of a chance to do this."
"Okay," he mumbled, letting his eyes slip shut, "Wake me up for dinner."
apologize, let Daddy hear it." He whispered to Peter. "He may not show it, but his feelings are hurt, Pete."
"Tears will not sway me, Anthony. I don't believe it for a second." Steve responded calmly but firm. "Across my legs, please." He stated, patting his lap over the blankets.
"Don't you even talk to me about being old, mister." Steve chuckled in a huff, giving Tony's hand a squeeze. He leaned up to kiss Tony softly, nuzzling his cheek. "You are far from old, babe."
look good? Damn, Rogers."
He was interrupted by a loud cry, in which he turned to look at the stairs.
The blond ran his hands all along Tony's back lovingly, voicing his praises at a whisper so he wasn't too loud.
"I can do it!" Peter squealed, trying to pull his shirt over his head with a soft grunt of effort.
"I'm not sure, bud." Steve said with a sigh. "Sometimes he gets an idea and he wants to work on it before he forgets it."
“Agreed. That’s… That’s probably best.” Tony nodded, reluctantly agreeing as he laid back down on the palette beside the other. “JARVIS, try to get Stephen Strange on the horn, would ya? Relay that its important.”
Steve watched as Peter went up, giving a small sigh. "I think he's upset about us talking about the baby..."
"I wouldn't be opposed to that. As long as you let me do the same." He stated softly, lips against Tony's cheek. "I'm so glad I waited for you. I love you. Very, very, very much." He chuckled, continuing to outline.
Tony laughed at that, having to put his fork down.
"Then I'll get you cleaned up." Steve grinned back, kissing Tony gently before getting up with a small grunt, heading to the bathroom.
Peter nodded, not quite understanding, but he let it drop.
Wait, no. That face... It was that of the armored human! He was just without the armor this time. but was still sinking down.
"Love you too, babe," he whispered.
He paused, faltering for a second.
About a week had gone by since Steve had been staying on land with Tony, and the blond had to say that he was enjoying every moment of it.
"I'm guessing you forgot about the medal ceremony in front of a lot of officials that happened today?".
'My game?' Steve said nervously, following Raavi, but looking back towards Tony as the brunet followed suit behind him.
"Its okay, Natasha." a slightly older woman replied.
“And the team will try and keep missions that might pop up around full moons under control. That way you aren’t out in the field and are targeted by enemies when you go into ‘beast mode’.” Clint assured as well, trying to keep a light tone. “Anyway, what we’re trying to say is that the team’s got your back. We’ll help you, furry or not.”
"You drive," he said softly, pecking him on the lips.
"I hear you guyses
"No, sir... I won't do it again." Peter murmured as he leaned up. He kept his head down as he stood, stopping in front of his father quietly.
"I know you don't want to, but we know Pepper would get onto you eventually for it." Steve sighed, then turning and watching Sammy smack his bottle around.
"Speaking of." The blond hummed, wiping at his face a bit before Peter would come in.
"I saw it at the store the other day," Tony grinned, looking down at Peter in his fluffy blue apron, "It was too cute to pass up."
He finished off the rest of the muffin himself, keeping it just out of Sammy's reach.
"You've always been a bad liar," Tony sighed, sitting properly to end his experiment, "But if you must know, yes, I am open to talking about the case."
"So demanding," Tony teased, dropping a leg over the side of the hammock to gently rock them, "Papa'll get your penguin, and we'll have communal snuggles on our bed, okay? Then we can talk about stuff for when we're at the cabin and you're in charge of Uncle Clint."
"Yeah, my junk isn't lovin' it so much right now, holy hell, ballet paid off," Tony groaned, rolling over onto his other side, "Night, slightly more muscular husband."
"From the mouths of babes." Steve teased lightly, giving Tony's hand a soft squeeze. "Behave, munchkin. And help with your brother, okay?"
"Are you and Daddy gonna have a baby?" He asked innocently, patting Steve's stomach through the blanket, "You's biggah dan usual, Papa."
Tony grinned, lightly smacking Steve's flank again.
"We're in the process-- here."
It's been a week, and they're already falling into bed.
He nodded softly and took a few slow breaths to relax as Tony's finger was slipped in, slow and smooth. Steve made a soft noise as Tony started to slowly wiggle the digit. Tony slowly worked Steve open, slipping in a second finger once he was sure he was loose enough. Leaning up, Tony kissed at Steve's navel, still scissoring him open.
"That’s the plan, yeah? Want you to come. Want you to feel so good, baby." He breathed, moaning quietly as he brought Tony into a wet kiss. He continued to massage the man's hips to contrast the deep thrusts.
"Now, will you go get Daddy for me and tell him its dinnertime?"
Sighing, Tony put him down, not at all surprised to see the boy quickly gather his math stuff and run off.
"Anyway, these are the ones you can physically meet, but I would like you to wave hello to JARVIS."
Steve slowed his movements just a bit, feeling Tony's breathe being short and his nails in his back.
Tony chuckled, stretching his legs out and wiggling his toes.
"Mhm."
"Hoo?"
"Well, let's go get you dressed, and Papa will see if we're taking you over, or if they're coming to get you," he hummed, swooping Peter up to take him upstairs.
"Shhh, shhh... It’s okay, Petey. Just an accident." Steve tried to soothe, setting Peter down in the bathroom and getting rid of the boy's wet clothes. He stripped out of his damp shirt and pants as well before starting the shower water.
"Says the man who thinks running ten feet is exhausting." Steve scoffed with a harder smack. "Seriously, a first grader? As if Peter hits harder than me."
"I'm gonna shower," he murmured softly, grabbing a quick kiss before getting up, stretching and picking out clothes for the day as he moved to the bathroom.
Steve grinned over at Tony, wrapping an arm around his shoulders. "I can't take all the credit for sneaking it past you. I had the idea but called up Clint and Natasha to help with the setup. They're quick and quiet and that's just what was needed." He grinned.
"And you best not be calling
, turning to the door.
“Otay papa," Peter mumbled, turning over to go back to sleep.
Tony was quiet for a few moments before speaking.
"I'm not slow, you're just too fast." Steve teased, finishing up packing things. He scooped Sammy up in his blanket and grabbed the baby bag. "Just so much to do at once, munchkin."
Peter banged his fork on the table till Steve came into the room, making grabby hands for his dinner.
The dreams were reoccurring. Well, maybe not reoccurring, but they would continue where they left off from the night prior. He would be in a vast room- with no noticeable beginning or end to it- sat in a chair, hands gripping tight to the arms of the furniture and refusing to let go.
"So what are you wanting us to do with your locks here, love?" The woman asked sweetly, looking between Steve and Tony for an answer.
Tony hefted the boy onto the bed and took the socks from him; rolling his eyes.
Tony looked taken aback.
"Do you want me to make some breakfast for us?" Steve asked softly with a small smile.
Tony nodded against the blonde.
wail on me. This is a punishment, not-- not what we usually do." Tony licked his lips, eyes drawn to the floor. "My safewords are colors. If I say 'green', I'm good, 'yellow', slow down, and 'red' to stop completely. Okay? Steve--I really want this."
"I was bored?" He tried.
He washed the soap out of Steve's hair, sighing softly as he did so. Steve looked down softly.
He grinned, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck.
Tony frowned, crossing his arms as he pouted up at Steve. "Be like that then," he teased.
"I built him to enter in a contest." The brunette stated.
"I love you. So much." Steve said in reply, giving him a quick kiss back. "Eventually... Maybe we can use the mirror. Just not yet."
"Ack!" Steve noised, pretending to try and get up.
"You's not old
"Thank you," He praised, smooching Steve's cheek after sliding into the driver's seat.
"Love you, Tony. L--
about painting something other than a canvas."
"No problem." Steve hummed, wrapping around Tony and moving them where Tony was laying on top of him. "You know better than to say 'or else', though. I like to challenge the 'or else' often."
Steve hummed in approval, eyes locking on the rings in amusement. "So, you wore them? You wear them well, baby." He purred.
Steve licked the taste of Tony off his lips with a hum, resting his head on Tony's chest and listening to his heartbeat.
Steve stopped moving with the music, causing a bit of concern to rise in Tony's voice.
"Hey, don't look at me," Tony shrugged, standing up to face Peter, "It was a responsibility we gave you, and you chose to disobey some of the rules we imposed."
"I know, baby boy. I'll be able to pick you up once we find Daddy and Bubby." Steve shushed as he looked for room 109.
"So..." He trailed off, a tiny smirk on his lips.
"That’s manipulative, you." Steve grinned. "You've got your Daddy's personality, for sure."
side."
"It's not like I'm gonna
Steve nodded, tugging Tony's boxers down to his ankles. He lubed up his fingers again and moving to slick up his cock with a groan. He lined himself up and pressed in slowly, going in up to the hilt.
Steve grinned at that. "I like that idea. I like it a lot." He leaned in to kiss Tony's cheek before he made a quick sketch for the setup. "We could outline each other along the wall and fill it in for the silhouettes. Then work from there.”
me show you that movie.”
"Mhm." Tony kept petting Steve's hair till the timer downstairs beeped, signaling dinner time. "Alright you, let's go eat, up and at 'em."
Tony raised an eyebrow at that and flicked his eyes over to Steve.
Three pieces. Steve was to do three pieces, but there was another one on the bottom. It was on a blank white canvas and was still only the sketch of a head. Tony assumed it was unfinished because the face was missing.
Tony arched his back and whined loudly, fisting a hand in Steve's hair; usually he could last much longer, but being slightly asleep, he couldn't hold back his orgasm, breathy moans filling the room. Steve took down everything Tony gave, licking him clean before slipping him back in his pants. He slinked back up to Tony's side, snuggling up to him sweetly.
The next couple days, Steve and Tony hadn't really saw each other. Contrary to popular belief, college isn't all parties and frat houses. It actually involves work and that can keep anyone busy. It was now the weekend though, and they had planned for their first drawing session today.
"Sorry, babe." Steve hummed sweetly, a smirk playing on his lips. "How's about you come and warm me up, hm?"
"BUT I DON'T WANT SOMEONE ELSE!" Steve nearly wailed, tears trailing down his face. "I don't care about finances or the business or whatever the fuck else. I want
Steve pouted softly, unwilling to get up just yet.
"Naw. Jus' wanted to see you guys and say hi to Papa." He hummed.
"That’s a good point. Sorry, I'm still a little preoccupied mind-wise." Steve hummed, picking Peter up carefully to carry up to their room for a nap.
His lip quivered, but he kept himself under control.
"Shhh, we don't want to--ah--wake 'im up." Steve gasped quietly, grabbing onto Tony's hips and pounding into Tony. He wouldn't last much longer at this rate.
"Steve?" He mumbled quietly, "Can I ask you something?"
"Good boy, such a good boy." Steve praised, helping Tony through. The way Tony clenched around him soon brought him over, coming with a deep sigh and filling Tony up.
Steve chuckled at that, shaking his head.
"Thanks for the offer, but probably not tonight." Steve hummed, putting in the headboard. "Tony and Peter left early and will be gone pretty much all day. I'd like to spend family time with them tonight if I can. It’s the holidays and everything. Need to spend the time with the family I actually have."
Steve smiled fondly, having peace knowing Tony had such good friends on his side. He finished the list for now, at least until he could add Peter's contribution to it.
"Jaws? Really? Now our son is a shark?" He chuckled, smooching Peter's nose once he got close enough.
He stepped back, shoving his hands in his pockets.
"Daddyyy, m'too
"I found it in my things that were in my old storage unit that I finally finished clearing out." Steve said with a soft grin, enjoying Bucky's reaction to his old childhood toy returned.
"Bubby's gonna come in here and visit you for a bit." Steve explained to the infant. "You wanna see bubby again?"
After sucking down a breath, Tony nodded, wiping his face off.
Tony's glance shot over to the tiny voice in the corner of the room, brow creased in worry.
"So it really was you. If you know about 'my light'." He said almost reluctantly. "The ol' 'show me yours, I'll show you mine', huh? Looking is fine, just-- no touching it. And I get to feel the material first."
"What the hell are you talking about, Rogers?".
"Steve? Have you seen my skinny jeans?" He called, slipping on striped briefs.
"'N my penguin. Dat'll be all, sir." The boy said in the most proper way he could, patting Tony with a giggle. "Could we all have cuddles tomorrow, too?"
"Yep, tons," he lied, shooting Steve a look before scurrying back to bed, hiding under his covers.
"The other white meat," Tony muttered under his breath, gently scrubbing himself down.
Peter gave a quizzical look. "Explains why ya look alike. You've never told me about him, though." the boy pointed out.
"He was called to talk with the dean.". Bruce explained. "You might be able to catch him on his way out, or I could leave a message for you.".
"Feeling better?"
He grinned, leaning in to nuzzle at Steve's neck.
Steve groaned, feeling Tony stroke him and hearing the huskiness of the man's voice. He trailed his hands along Tony's sides, moving his thumbs up to flick softly across the nipple rings.
"No you are not. You are not bad or horrible. Just troubled." Steve explained, holding Tony to him. "You are good and smart and precious and loved, along with so much more. But never horrible."
"My first hobby, as I like t'say," Tony murmured sleepily, laying back on his hospital bed with a dopey smile.
. Steve still barely understood it. Peter would have to show him how to do it.
He smiled as Natasha opened the door, peeking into the household. "How'd things go?"
Steve sighed, opening the door and entering.
"He'll have to start sitting up before that, though." Steve pointed out. "Let’s get him doing that first and his tooth in and we'll deal with that when we get to it."
"Screamo music, good lord," he grinned, turning to Steve.
"Good," they both replied, only Peter looking up from his doodle.
"Oooh
kissed me like dat!" He whined, "I won' get t'have special kissies??" He teared up and sniffled, rubbing away the tears that fell down his cheeks.
He sighed, burying his face in Steve's shoulder.
"Hey now, no beating up your Papa," Tony called, coming over to take Pete off his shoulder, "What do you have to say for yourself, young man?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I just don't want it to be so obvious that I painted this half," Tony laughed, "You can fix it up if you want, but I think it looks okay." He paused, knowing a flush was sinking onto his cheeks.
"Fuck, Steve, that's not what I meant," Tony muttered, immediately lacing his hand with Steve's, "I'm not letting you go anywhere, that's for damn sure. I meant... I can't help but think about what Peter's teacher had said. What if soulmates really are dying out, and our tattoos don't symbolize a bond? What if we just got so damn lucky to land someone perfect?"
"Shh, Steve. Hey, I know. Its okay, baby." Tony said soothingly, petting the other's hair and kissing the top of the blond's head. "That's the beauty of this place. I've been able to keep an eye out on you. I'm
"Well, you did have to get stitches in it, Tony." Steve said softly, carefully pressing his hand against Tony's head. "You feel a little hot. Might be from the stress on your body lately."
Tony mewled, arms shaking as pleasure flowed through him, causing him to buck up into Steve's thrusts.
"Well, he's a baby and that’s the only way he knows how to tell us anything." Steve sighed back, leaning up. "Wanna see the problem this time?"
"Tony!!!!"
"They are our friends, but sometimes they take things too far and it comes across as mean."
Steve suppressed a groan at the motion, waiting to hear little feet patter away before speaking at a whisper.
"It’s not against ya, Daddy. Its s'posed to help ya." Peter said, immediately covering his mouth as if he just gave a big hint to the secret.
"You're really pretty, all nice and open for me like that," Tony murmured, flicking the vibrator off, "Alright, no more mean. You can talk."
"Fuck, Steve," Tony grunted, arms shaking as he picked up his pace, "Y'gonna make me come from the noises comin' from y'pretty little mouth."
"Yeah," he murmured, "Yeah, it will."
"So y'all know I went to see a therapist a bit ago," He started, "And we discussed my ....
"M'sorry." Steve choked out through a moan, trying to hang through until Tony managed to make it to his high.
“He is. So please shush. He's pretty sore and partied out, so he's resting." Steve hummed, getting back to work.
"But the kitchen is a great size. Good for cooking big meals. Like for Thanksgiving and Christmas." He hummed happily as they walked inside, meeting Babs again.
"You say such nice things," Tony snorted, resting his hands on Steve's pecs, "Are you actually gonna follow through with any of that, or..."
"Don't pluck my scales!" The blond nearly growled.
"Prime rib, maybe. That sounds good for dinner tomorrow. I'll go grocery shop," Tony rattled off, leaning into Steve's touch, "My god, I'm turning into my mother."
Slowly, he ran his hands down Steve's chest, pausing to play at his nipples.
"I know, that just how you are. But instead of apologizing, you need go shower and get dressed. I don't want to be late this time, especially since its my work being showcased.".
"Y-yessir..." Steve stuttered, moving back towards Tony's fingers again. "Here you say I shouldn't be having sex at my age, yet the way you talk about me makes me wonder.”
"This is the fucking end of the line, Clinton," Tony growled, "I am a
With a resigned sigh, he got up from his worktable, accidentally getting grease smudged on his forehead. Before opening the door, he grabbed his scarf to hide the tattoo around his neck.
" Yes."
He sighed happily at Steve, starting to relax when a foreign object started to press into his belly; Tony burst into laughter, putting his hand over his eyes.
It didn't take too much longer after that Steve and Sammy showed up, heading to the desk.
"We can start wherever you want to show me first. Probably would be best to start on the top and work our way down." Steve smiled back, heading towards the stairs. "Race you upstairs?" He said, raising an eyebrow in challenge.
"Look at you, baby," Tony cooed, tossing his sweats and t-shirt off the bed, "All nice and done up for me. Such a good boy for me."
"Mhm." Tony kissed his cheek before sitting down next to him, rolling out the blueprint paper in front of them. "Whatcha thinkin' for the wall?"
Tony fired up the car, backing down the driveway and roaring off towards Red Light, two towns over. When they arrived at the front of the store, Steve was rather surprised at the store. Compared to Bruce's discreet, kind of hole-in-the-wall place, this was essentially a small Walmart. A Walmart for sexual items.
"He never told me he had." Steve queried. "He might have purposely not told me. Did Daddy show you how to burp him, too?"
Steve moved in on the side of Tony to dry and put away the dishes as Tony finished, smooching Tony's cheek softly.
"Thank you, Tony, I'd just run out too," she hummed.
on Eugene's ass."
"That song is so sad and you know it, you butt," Tony sniffled, unable to help dissolving into giggles, "Poor Sammy. Kid's already having a rough night." He wiped his eyes and turned his head to look at the baby, smiling softly as Sammy kicked his legs up in the air.
"Peter, please don't cry bubba." Steve pleaded quietly, feeling really bad about Peter bawling. "You're okay. You did such a good job with Sammy, baby. Please..."
"Steve-- if we're gonna do this right, I want you to really hit me. Like,
"It’s mainly Clint that lets him get away with stuff. Nat and I try to keep things fairly civil." Bucky shrugged his right shoulder slightly, going from watching Peter color and Tony work. "It’s almost like watching two kids sometimes, honestly."
"Okay, I get the hint. We'll worry about it all after some rest."
he was also freezing his balls off but that was besides the point.
the counsellor had sessions with students each morning, but no on campus work to do in the afternoon, so he kept tony entertained while the teenager threw up from time to time and lay on the couch, not moving most of the day. they had told him that tony would be better, the first week was always hard and steve tried hard not to be worried.
“sorry,” tony mumbled when he sat in the bathtub.
how could 25 year old steve, who was of age and independent and earning money be going back to a loving mother while tony saw his parents maybe three or four times a year for a prolonged period of time? so he distracted himself until he fell asleep early. he was going to meet steve for coffee the next morning and that’s all he put his mind to.
steve was barely able to close his mouth upon being shown around tony’s luxury penthouse. the teenager lived right at the waterfront in a two bedroom apartment. however, space wise he would’ve had enough for 7 rooms. his walk in closet was the size steve’s entire room was in the apartment he shared with bucky.
they stood close together for a while, neither saying a word. then steve opened his arms wide and hugged the short boy, who barely reached his chest, as close as he could for about 10 minutes. then he left without another word.
the blond man cried for a few minutes while tony sat there, looking at his face and not saying a word. steve thought this so unfair; all tony got to have was a fight for survival for hopefully twenty years and he would lose no matter what. the teenager deserved the world, that was for sure.
steve took a deep breath and tony placed his hands onto the tight shirt around his abs. “did your parents have to fly in?”
“yes ma, thank you i’m fine.” he let a small smile play on his lips. “really fine.”
he told his parents he was seeing his girlfriend steph, and met them for dinner twice before he headed back to boston. steve was cutely enough just as excited about the flight back as he’d been about flying in.
tony took a shutter breath while he looked out on the open road. “i want my parents.” saying those words made tony’s eyes water for reasons he couldn’t explain.
“but the vacations are nice. journeys like this are a bliss and the mansions around the world are nice. my parents do have a gift in buying nice homes they never use.”
“something wrong?” maria asked and looked at her son with concern.
“don’t worry, i can take you,” steve said with such clarity in his voice that tony nodded in response.
tony took his time to pack up after class and left his backpack on the desk when the last person had left the auditorium, going after them in order to lock up the only door in the room.
“you okay?” the kid asked and regretted it right away because steve looked like he might cry once again.
and so he waited for the feelings and dreams and daydreams and flutters to go away by themselves, and he kept busy from the beginning of the semester. he liked seeing tony in the hall every now and then.
tony opened his arms in order to be lifted into an embrace, which howard understood and they hugged for a while before tony was put into an arm chair by his bed.
“where did you find that?” tony said when he took out one of them, realizing only two had been smoked before.
so tony finished his undergraduate degree within five semesters, and a spike never showed up in his cell count. however, his energy levels decreased slowly but surely, and so the by now 16 year old decided to configure his master’s to take six semesters with the hope of dying before finishing it. he knew that’s not how it would be. his chance of survival was pretty high regarding the fact that the illness wasn’t far along, he was young and otherwise pretty healthy.
“come on honey, i think it’s cute,” steve assured and placed a hand on tony’s thigh.
and he noticed steve’s shift in body language too, and it felt weird because steve had to be at least seven years older than tony and yet the teenager’s heart was beating loud at who he saw in front of him.
Bucky was there, too. They were out in the woods and there were tents around and planes flying over them. Had his pops gone camping with Bucky and met someone there?"
the teenager sighed in response. “does it matter?”
You are so perfect Tony. Inside and out. I strongly believe I had to go under for those sixty years to be matched with you. You are wholesome and beautiful and so, so loving Tony. I don't know where I would be right now if it wasn't for you. You are teaching me how to live a life that's worth living every single day.
tony himself loved steve’s body, obviously. but he also loved the sense of protection he got around the man, the adult guidance. and at the same time steve was so sensitive and unafraid to show his emotions and that the teenager loved too.
it was a few minutes later that the rogers, steve’s sister pam and her husband jim along with their two kids sat down for dinner with their new guest tony. tony hadn’t been able to ‘save’ the sauce, he’d started from scratch.
“howard?”
"do you want to talk about it?" steve asked when tony's tears had stopped falling. it had surprised him how openly tony had showed emotion; he had never seen him cry in the whole year they'd known each other. he himself had cried in front of tony a handful of times, sometimes even before they'd been together.
“i thought maybe within a safe distance from campus we could have coffee and consider things. if you’re still on board of course.”
the billionaire was already drowsy before their dinner arrived, but after eating, he fell asleep against steve's chest within minutes.
“i was fourteen and exhausted and, well, it makes you sleep. a lot. i uh… pissed my bed.” he’d whispered the last part, so steve asked him to repeat. “i pissed my bed,” tony said loudly. “my old man had to help me clean up because i couldn’t fucking move my limbs.”
“when i first got-“ tony stopped himself there. he couldn’t tell a counsellor who didn’t know he had cancer that he started smoking when he first got diagnosed. “when i started at mit, actually. it’s not a big habit though, sometimes i just really get an urge to smoke one.”
tony laughed in response. “that ship has long sailed. i graduated when i was 13. and i’ve had sex with a girl, just not with men. and besides, what speaks against finding things out with someone more experienced?” he spoke more softly and quietly by the minute. he didn’t need to brush up into steve’s face.
tony sat down in an armchair in the corner of steve’s room, feeling dizzy from the exhaustion of climbing up five flights of stairs to get there.
tony sat back down and took himself into his hands. then he did take care of himself, and when he was done spluttered all over steve’s beautiful torso.
“steve, this is my dad.”
“maybe you should stop drinking,” steve suggested subtly to tony when his glass was filled up for the sixth time. “how are we going to get home?”
at the end of the class, tony packed up slowly very purposely, and he succeeded in being the last person in the room with steve.
“thank you for squeezing me in on such short notice.”
steve mentioned to tony that he’d spent the first part of the break with his ma and sister and her family back home in new york and had then enjoyed boston quiet of college students for a few weeks.
tony loved that steve cared so much about him that he’d ask that question right away. “yeah. my folks showed up,” he stated with a sigh. he didn’t know where this was going or what he wanted steve to do.
the teenager sighed in response. he knew his time had come, he wouldn’t be able to keep his illness a secret any longer.
“yes,” tony shrugged. “i’m in aerospace engineering. name’s tony by the way.”
the smell of apple pie pulled him out of his slumber.
“good to meet you tony.” steve took a blanket out of his gym bag and wrapped it around his shoulders before shifting into a more comfortable position. he liked to sit a little after his sessions and stare out into the sea. “so, you’re taking things slow?”
and tony, with his sober way of speaking and mature world view did tickle something in him he hadn’t felt in a while. and in all fairness, to steve’s knowledge tony had to be at least eighteen or nineteen.
The skin on his knees was starting to get scratched open from the tile floor of his bathroom.
"Is what because of you, Peter?" Steve asked, confused and sat down next to the boy before spotting the photo album in his lap. "Oh, you found the album," Steve stated.
“i met howard in college and we’ve been friends ever since. tony and i see each other a lot in the summer. we’ve been vacationing on the yacht for years now.”
if steve hadn’t said something about being hungry, tony might’ve never chewed on the smallest piece of pizza he could find and left the rest to his ‘date’.
“hi baby, are you well rested?” maria asked before kissing her son’s cheek.
“please,” steve panted.
“reconciliation can fix a lot,” steve commented but by then, tony was already out like a light.
“tony!” maria exclaimed and hugged her son very close. “you’re so tall! that growth spurt is really coming in honey.” she kissed his cheek before letting him go.
the boy thought about steve constantly, no matter how many drinks he had. he wanted to do steve the favor of losing his man virginity but he couldn’t do it emotionally. it felt like he was cheating on the counsellor whenever he talked to a beautiful frat boy. it’s also not like one of them could go against steve in any sense of physicality or maturity. he did have sex with a few girls though. they were all one night stands however; he wanted to stay free for steve.
and then he pulled tony into his chest, enjoying their skin to skin contact with love rather than lust.
"Yes, will she be my new mommy?" Peter asked and Steve suppressed a chuckle.
After a few minutes, his pops did walk into the living room, sniffed, and told him he would be down at Bucky's for a few minutes and that if anything was to come up, he should tell Jarvis to tell him to come.
"He's in there, I'll get some sweats ready and do the bed, just please you take care of... that." Tony said and Peter felt his heart sink.
"What divorce?" Steve asked confused, and pulled the boy to sit in his lap.
“mr. stark, it’s nice to meet you,” steve said as he shook howard’s hand with a strong grip.
he could tell pepper was shocked that steve was in the know; tony mustn’t have shared a lot before his counselling had started, which didn’t come as much of a surprise really.
“i’m a counsellor at the engineering department at mit,” steve said nonchalantly because honestly, while in any other place of the world this was a right to brag, he felt like a towel boy on the yacht.
the teenager stepped closer to his boyfriend and used his thumbs to wipe away the few tears that had already cascaded down steve’s cheeks. wow, no reaction of anyone he’d told had ever touched him like steve’s did right then. “is that where all those bruises come from?” steve’s voice was weak, hoarse and so unlike himself.
People stood up and clapped, and now would actually be the point where Steve and Tony took each other's hand and walked out of the church, but instead, Steve crouched down in front of his stepson and placed both hands on his shoulders.
the blond slowly placed his book back on the bedside table. "hey tones, come here," he said but tony didn't move and so steve palmed the back of his boyfriend's head and used his other hand to come closer to him. then he pushed the man's face into his chest, hugging him close.
he’d brought some tea for himself and steve, and he would suggest opening a bottle of wine at his place after the surf session.
steve left tony’s apartment building after the teenager had taken a quick shower, after which he made sure to take his meds unseen by steve, and put on a suit and coat, for his mom would be waiting with a limousine just outside.
“well i’m happy there’s some positives. a lot of people struggle to understand that money isn’t everything in the world.”
silently and very slowly, tony got up from the bed and carefully exited the room as not to disturb anyone. then he tried his luck and called steve’s office at mit.
“thank you, it’s my favorite,” tony said sheepishly and the pair fell into another long conversation about the stars and the universe and the ice caps and polar nights and what not.
“i’m sixteen. but hey, i’m more mature than steve,” the teenager said with a smile and took a long drag from his cigarette.
he wanted to see how the teenager was doing in natural settings. it would help him see how mature he was, and honestly the geographical proximity tickled his stomach a little.
steve nodded in response. “alright.”
“i’ve got a surprise,” tony said unsurely when steve and bucky lay down next to him. “we were invited to that yacht over there for lunch.”
"Peter thinks you think he's disgusting," Steve explained and Tony's expression softened.  The man put his phone aside and motioned for Steve to place their son in his lap.
tony’s best friend, james rhodes, picked up on how much time tony had to spare easily. they had developed a very sober way of talking about death. no, they weren’t making fun of it generally, but rhodes at least wasn’t as careful anymore. tony had all but finished with the thought of becoming an adult, because he wasn’t a fighter and he’d always said to his best friend that once he reached a stage where he wouldn’t be able to pull himself up to go to the bathroom, he was to fly him out to switzerland and take him to an assisted suicide clinic. rhodes liked to joke about the fact that while he would help him get to said clinic, he wouldn’t wipe tony’s ass, they weren’t that close.
after being assured that that was in fact the case, pepper took a shuddery breath. “i’m not really supposed to tell anyone but tony, you know, the kid from human factors?”
“i guess,” tony shrugged with a smile. it felt weird to him, those two worlds combined but given the fact that steve was around, it would be okay. and besides, he hadn’t lounged around and eaten and drunk a weekend away in a long time. “you okay with that stevie?”
“like the movies,” bucky finished for him and tony smiled.
The six-year-old's face crumpled as more tears made their way down his cheeks and he nodded eagerly, stepping forward into his Pops' open arms, who hugged him tight and let him sob into his expensive suit. The guests cheered again, giving Peter time to calm himself a little before Steve pressed a kiss to his temple and then got up and placed him onto his hip.
He heard Pops' phone ring over the speakers of the TV and stood up, taking a step closer to the screen.
“i’m twenty-five.”
So the man's heart obviously jumped a little when Peter looked back up at him with very teary eyes.
“hi there,” tony said. he was still wearing the exclusive suit he’d put on in the morning, and steve had to admit that the boy looked beautiful.
maria was drunk, her breath smelled of too much martini and vodka. besides that, she was unable to talk about anything other than business.
“well, we can not leave a stark without a lunch invitation, can we? i’ll send a boat in about a half an hour, okay? your company can shower on the laura.”
tony was diagnosed with chronic leukaemia during his first month at mit. he was fourteen years old and scared shitless for the first few months. from then on, he had to go see a doctor once every few weeks and during any anomalies regarding his well-being.
“it’s a pleasure. these are for you.” steve handed maria a bouquet of white roses, having remember tony tell him her preference. “and of course, for the father we’ve got some cigars.” and steve pulled out a pack of five very rare cuban cigars after checking with tony if it would be okay.
“please tell me you have pictures,” bucky laughed and andrew joined him, nodding. he ordered one of the butlers to grab the photo album of the summer when tony was about to turn three, then put out his cigar.
tony returns to mit from winter break and meets an interesting figure at the beach.
“that’s all?” steve asked, his tone a little amused.
the teenager had packed up his things and walked to the front desk while steve was still on it.
“my mom’s a nurse but she’s just had surgery so she’s not working right now. and my dad passed away fifteen years ago, but he used to work at xerox in the sales department.”
when they were done with breakfast, tony lay down on the couch between his parents, head in howard’s lap and legs in his mom’s.
“how old is he?” howard asked when he remembered tony had said he was finished at harvard. “and what does he do?”
howard chuckled. “i figured. our intellect requires women the same age or older men. people who don’t bore us.”
tony passed out against steve’s side at nine in the evening. “great guy,” bucky said with a smile.
“what’s it like growing up this rich?” steve asked over their exclusive dinner once they reached the appropriate flight level. tony had told the pilot to do a couple circuits over new york so steve could see the skyline he loved so much.
the semester was going to start one and a half weeks later, and since tony literally had nothing to do until then, he decided to try and train a little. he’d been in quite alright shape up until the last time he lost his appetite a few weeks back.
“i’m alright, thanks. how are you guys?”
Peter nodded, cheeks heating up in embarrassment at taking everything so wrong. "Yeah, okay," he said in response.
“well it can’t be that small either if it makes you cry.”
steve told him about his little dig through the refrigerator that was completely empty save for yoghurt and some milk. “we could grab lunch together?”
the night was perfect; the meds didn’t make tony as tired as they would usually and he even felt energized enough to take a shower before bed. little did he know that steve would slip in there before he could finish.
“seriously?” bucky shot up as he smiled. “your life’s really like that?”
“yeah?” steve asked then and tony knew he was waiting for an actual response, he needed to know that tony was there and actually wanting to take part in an act.
"Well Pete he's a bit disgusted with sick," Steve explained, not thinking there was any harm in telling the boy.
the billionaire looked around the room, his vision blurry with tears.
“beautiful how you got into the ivy system. how about you james? what do you and your parents do?”
“steve,” he said with a blush. “steve rogers.”
Thank you, Steve, so much, for becoming my family after I had none left. And, oh gosh, thank you, Steve, for being the best Pops I could've ever wished for my little Peter.
“maybe you can talk to my dad sometime, i’m sure he could put in a good word for you with a few people. you guys can come to one of our summer parties,” tony suggested. this was normal talk for the kids he grew up with in all those boarding schools. money stayed within those families through a lot of networking, and it seemed like every millionaire knew twelve others, and so on, and that environment was very familiar to tony, it was where he felt most homey.
After a moment, though, he looked up, and his expression was furious.  He met Tony's eyes.  There was not a trace of submission on his features.
But didn't that also prove a point? That maybe this thing, the tesseract, was, in fact, incredibly dangerous?
But Tony looked nervous. Phil was right. He was afraid and rightly so. Steve swallowed and resisted the urge to reach out to him again. He wasn't his alpha, he didn't have a right...
Tony watched Steve melting down.  He turned to the front. "Happy, drive.  Take us back to the hotel. We're done."
"Oh, and Steve?"
bonded.  And sometimes I-- I can feel him."  Tony looked away. Rhodey winced as the red convertible Tony had been driving plowed into the side of a building, bursting into flames.
"Have you been here before?" he asked Piper. She nodded, hands twisting behind her back. "What's it like?"
"What?"  Pietro's eyes widened.  "No. Impossible. I'm not due until April."
Clint rolled his eyes. "Of course it's okay Steve. That's why we invited you here."
"Well, maybe you'd want a beta cock, I don't know.  Do you want this huge dick or not, Steve?"
"Come with me and if you don't like what you see, I'll take you back.  They'll never know."
"Hey, let's go for a walk," said Tony.  He needed to go outside. Musing over locks and captivity and being trapped was making him feel claustrophobic.  The museum was airy but it didn't matter. He needed to be outside, weather be damned.
"Want a hand?"
Tony gently put a hand on Steve's chest and pushed him back. "Lie back. Legs spread," he said, crawling onto the bed and kissing Steve's chest.  It rose and fell under Tony's lips and he was struck, all over again, with just how big Steve was, his pecs, his biceps... Steve looked like he could flip a car over.
Fury didn't respond, and Tony didn't expect him to.  "To what do I owe the pleasure?" asked Fury cautiously.  All of them, suspected Tony, were aware that their last interaction together had been in Steve's kitchen, immediately after Steve's interview and with Tony in his underwear.  None of them were mentioning it; Fury seemed like a ruthlessly practical person and with Tony and Steve bonded, he was probably aware that he was stuck with accepting both of them if he wanted to recruit one.
." She was a beta, so it made sense for her to be here instead of Phil, even if it was more awkward.
Steve frowned a little. "When did I say I don't want an Alpha? I mean, I shouldn't...who could cope with my lifestyle?" He didn't deny that he was aroused, because it was true and Tony could already tell. "And especially with the stunt I pulled yesterday."
There was another omega there.  The one from the base in Cuba. He was in a light windbreaker that seemed completely inappropriate considering the weather.  The snowflakes were powdering his long, silver-blond hair; he shook them off, watching Steve.
"He even doesn't do it that often," said Tony, sounding pouty.  His eyes lit up a little. "Actually, Steve, would you mind--"
Steve grit his teeth, his abdomen contracting painfully. His clothes felt too hot.
"Okay, someone get him something to eat," said Phil, who looked like he was ready to lose patience too.
Steve swallowed. There was a pregnant pause. "Not everything he did was shit. It's just...it's easier to be mad at him, you know? Otherwise I miss him and... that don't do me no good."
"Taylor Swift?"
"Sir?" JARVIS' tinny voice flooded the workshop, reaching Tony's ears. "I do believe, going by his heart rate, that Captain Rogers is having a panic attack."
The device was on and it was loud, louder than a jet engine, rattling ominously.  Tony stood by the stripping chamber, holding a large prism in his hand, waiting for the right moment.  He had one shot.
"Send us a bill for the... rock," Steve finished awkwardly and stood. "And I'm sorry- Tony can be a jerk." The girl actually laughed a little through her tears at that, throwing her head back as she did so. For some strange reason that made Steve feel a whole lot better.
"Gwyneth Paltrow's head."
"After a lengthy probation, about a year, we'll be sending Barton to Mojave, and Romanov to India.  They need to be separated. The Council doesn't want pair bonds working together anymore. Wilson'll be stationed at the VA in D.C., and you'll be with me.  Stark and Rogers are on their own. Can't use them anymore for SHIELD." Fury's face was surprisingly serene as he laid out all these plans. "Hill. How's that hand?"
"She's not your employee.  She's a CFO and co-CEO but strictly speaking, she's not employed by you, but the shareholders and the board," said Happy.
"Oh, shit.  I should call someone else, then."  Tony hiccuped.  "...maybe I oughta call Stan.  I mean, Steve.  I mean, Captain America."  He felt his stomach drop a little.
Then he sat back down amongst the auctionees. They were exchanging small talk, gossiping about other couples that were trying to get a look in at them. Steve just ate patiently and listened to them for a little while. It was nice to just let them be kids. Seven began staring at him though.
The only explanation was that he'd truly gone mad.  Maybe it was the palladium poisoning, or maybe, he was back in the cave, talking to himself, babbling bullshit while Yinsen tried to keep him from hurting himself.  Or maybe he was just on a ton of drugs.
Steve drew back so only the head rested in his mouth and then began to slowly move back and forth, doing what felt natural as his cheeks hollowed out every time he drew off. He followed Tony's cues. What made him moan and squirm, what made him tug at Steve's hair. It was almost thrilling to feel in charge for once instead of him being the one begging and panting.
"Romanov?"
His own voice from the speakers.  He was watching a reel of a memory.
Donner was trying to peek over Steve's shoulder at the scripts.  He let out a little snort.
under attack,
"We're gonna find him, Steve.  We're going to go get him back, okay?" said Tony, still rubbing Steve's back.  Steve had hunched into his seat and his hands were in his hair, a sure sign of a nuclear meltdown.  "It's okay, we got this, we got everyone over at 84 to help us. We won't let anyone hurt him. ...Happy, take Olive St. and go north..."
"Thank you, sir, I'll pass.  You have enough vices for both of us."
"I hate fortune cookies," said Happy from the front seat, putting the car into gear and easing back into traffic.
Tony would bet dollars to donuts that Howard thought the idea of injecting a sickly omega with the serum was utterly hilarious.  Also, Howard had a flair for the dramatic, and there was no doubt that the change had been flooring; if you started with less impressive materials to begin with, then the resulting product would look better by comparison.
Lately, Steve had been overwhelmed with requests for various organizations.  As promised, Irshad Nazari, head of the World Omega Rights' Council, had been working closely with Aria and had sent Steve the contact information of a man named Jeffrey Walker, who was the head councilman of the Horseshoe Society, the nation's oldest omega-rights society.  They hadn't touched base yet; Steve was too busy and according to Irshad, Jeff was laid low due to a tricky pregnancy (twins).
So Steve sat up, as did Tony, and they were a mess of tangled limbs as they kissed. He threaded his fingers through the engineer's hair and scratched at his scalp lightly, smiling when it drew out a shudder.
"I saw the tapes.  ...I assume you'd prefer if I didn't know anyone else."
His name.  People called him Asset, Resource, Program, Soldier... and sometimes Karpov's.
"Don't worry, Steve, I'm gonna get you to the hospital!" shouted Tony, oblivious to the conversations going on around him.
He wondered if Steve did this sort of thing with any regularity in the 1940s.  Did he and Dad and Aunt Peggy all cheerfully maim other people and then go out dancing?  Tony couldn't imagine it.
"Is it too late for a refund?"
"...yes, sir."
"I just can't believe he heard that phone call and still wants to go back to him. The guy must have no self-esteem," Banksy sighed sadly.
Karpov told him not to be difficult and Steve wasn't. He was all too aware of the girl.  He would have to plan an escape later, when she wasn't there.
Tony peered out the bedroom door at him.  "Oh, right, hi!"
Steve's eyes flicked out automatically, respectfully.  Tony's heart ached. He leaned down to kiss Steve's forehead before nudging himself against Steve's entrance.  Wet and warm as ever. Tony let out a shuddery hiss as he slid his length in, finding a slow, gentle rhythm. He settled his body over Steve's, wrapping his arms around him, the earlier betrayal already forgiven.
"Everything's a joke to you, isn't it?  Stay the hell away from me!"
Between Vanko and Bucky, Tony was a lot more threatened by Bucky.  But both men were equally mysterious.  They were lurking ominously in the margins of Tony's life, just out of reach.  He'd only
"Steve, can you go get me a real cup of coffee?" asked Tony, setting down the mug.
Tony  gave Coulson a nod, hovering over Steve's shoulder.  The team seemed to have accepted that Tony was going to be there whether they liked it or not; his bond with Steve had all but guaranteed it.  Tony noticed that Clint was absent again.  He wondered if he was off torturing some other poor omega in New Mexico, warping his brain for a questionably useful evaluation.
"I got you Stark's!  What more do you want?  What about all the others--"
"Oh.  Oh, thank Tesla, I did
Tony for pushing away Steve.  Now, people seemed to have thawed a little.  The horseshoe pin and Tony's clear support of Steve was doing his public image wonders.
Tony ran his hands down Steve's arms again.  He leaned forward to press his lips to Steve's neck, to run his tongue over the skin.  His mouth was so close to Steve's ear.
Tony waited.  She provided no last name, and Tony was willing to bet JARVIS that she had not been born with that name.  It was an oddly strong name; perhaps she had given it to herself.
The only part that Tony heard of Natasha's words was that his mate wasn't safe.
"I-- I can't feel my fingers," Steve whispered, flexing his left hand with a frown, the movement stiff. "Did-- did someone turn off the lights?  Guys?"
person, just ignorant. He wasn't like Malick or Mike; there was no
"I'll pay you two thousand dollars to come in here and make pancakes."
"Stop speaking Russian," snapped Tony, glaring at Natasha.
"In for two and out for two. That's it, but slower. Don't try to talk, just focus on breathing. That's it. In for two and out for two..." Steve's voice was soft, encouraging and understanding. Because he'd been before. Being a good leader hadn't just been about the battle, it had been about off the battle field too. Steve squeezed Tony's fingers again. "Just go slow. Don't rush it. Just focus on breathing. In for two and out for two..."
, but so do you, if you have the phone records.  And he's not there anymore. I'm not part of Project Heirloom."
"A week is more than enough. Thank you, Doctor." Steve stood as the meeting seemed to be coming to a close. A part of him wanted to rush home to bed, to curl up under the sheets and sleep the day's trauma away. Another part of him knew he had to go to Tony, talk some goddamn sense into him.  What did he think? That Steve wasn't his? Steve had barely even been Bucky's and Steve hadn't even realised they'd remained bonded after the serum in the forties! Didn't
As Tony's tongue pressed inside Steve tilted his head back a soft
okay, I'm actually trying but I can't focus, and I really have to go to the bathroom, okay, like, they didn't even provide a fuckin' bucket."
"I wasn't wearing the collar for fun, Tony," Steve pointed out gently as they got into the back seat of the car. Happy got into the front. The crowd were surrounding the auctionees now. Steve could see the media approaching from down the drive. Shit was about to hit the fan and they didn't want to anywhere near it. They'd made their point, done their part...
He pulled out the pack of cigarettes again and put one between his lips, cupping the flame from the lighter to light up--
"Why, 'cause Gideon Malick and the World Security Council thinks I need it?  I know he has out in for me. It's because he wants to sleep with me.  He's got some weird Captain America fetish."
"Jarv?" called Tony as he loped down the stairs still buttoning his shirt, sunglasses already on.  "Who's gonna be at the meeting?"
"...no," said Aria suspiciously.  "He wanted to go shopping after yoga but he only needed like, a dozen things.  He isn't back yet?"
"You're a great one. I just mean....you consume a lot of coffee and you swear a lot and you're-"
"Because, you know, sometimes Alphas kind of go crazy, get a little feral..."
"Stay....st-tay away..." The last thing he needed was two more Alphas in here, making Tony feel threatened. Surely he'd be over this in five, ten minutes?  They could last ten minutes. Steve looked over. The man who had fired on them did not look in a good way. He frowned. "Tony! D-don't kill him. Want him alive."
"Will Malick be there?" asked Steve warily.
"I don't know," said Tony.  He paused, then repeated, "I don't know."
sweet and all, it's just... tricky.  He seems so young, doesn't he? Thank
Cece sat back, blinking.  "...wow. I thought that was the lamest excuse for a date ever, but you're completely serious, aren't you?  You're his biggest fan."
He reached over and slapped the kill switch.
"Had worse," Phil said, mouth full of sandwich. "I think it should be dying down by the morning."
He felt betrayed and dirty, like his gland was betraying him.
In the parking garage, Tony and Steve sat on the hood of a car together, watching Jorge wipe off Gideon Malicks car, both of them sipping beer.  Steve half-hoped an Alpha would come out and see them sitting side-by-side like this, as equals.  He hoped they'd see Steve drinking a beer from the bottle, like a
Steve was edging towards feral more and more by the minute. He was flushed and pink all over and he was essentially climbing up the walls. He had one leg braced on either side of the doorway as he tried to find a weak spot on the top of the doorframe. But there was none. He just scrabbled at it uselessly. Goddamn Stark planes. Too well designed.
"Drop the act, Rogers.  I already know you faked
Tony wondered if Steve would start doing that.
He swallowed and clutched the phone a little tighter. Steve spared a sleeping Tony one last look before tugging on a pair of boxer shorts. "Have you read--" It felt so egotistical to ask. And Steve liked to think he wasn't that. "Do you know about me?" he asked finally, apprehensive of the answer.
He turned and looked at the omega to ask for orders, figuring he must be in charge now, but his question died on his lips.  The omega was curled up against the wall, shivering, eyes bright, blond hair tantalizingly damp, skin glistening with sweat.  He looked ill but the effect was inexplicably delicious. The soldier's mouth was literally watering just looking at him.
see you any differently for that. If anything, it makes me see you as a stronger person," Steve said, clearly horrified at the idea. When he'd first spotted the mark on Tony's neck (one night when he'd helped Pepper drag a drunk and passed out Tony into bed) he hadn't been disgusted or repulsed by it; he'd been curious. He'd wondered if maybe Tony was like Sam.  He had admittedly considered assault, idly, but that hadn't made him see Tony in a remotely bad light in any way, shape, or form. "And it's okay... I don't think I have the energy to care what the papers think of me anymore. I told them the truth.  Or at least, everything
Tony still hadn't stirred, probably because he hadn't slept since they'd told him Steve was missing.  After four days awake and much of it in the suit, Tony probably wouldn't have woken if Fury had kicked the legs out from under his chair.  The room was still dark, but under his shirt, the arc reactor was providing some dim blue mood lightning that etched every deep crease and scar on Fury's face.
"Look at me," said the Alpha quietly.
Tony peered over the edge of the roof, watching yet another guard walk out, gesturing.  He and the other one peeled off and loped into the woods, presumably to check the cables.  Once they saw the demolished electrical boxes, the gig was up. But as of right now, no one's body language indicated any real concern.
Donner was a really big hit for years and years, and now you're here, and I guess he's feeling like you ruined his--" Rex made air quotes again.  "--
Tony made a wheezing sound at him and an elaborate gesture.  He was clinging to Steve, whose bad leg was trembling under him; both of them were digging their fingers into the other's skin.  Steve reached out automatically to accept the clothes.
"He'll probably be put into cryo," Maria and Steve's head snapped up in alarm. "It's a precaution. You can't treat someone until you know what the 'antidote' is. It's safer this way. Apparently in HYDRA he has a reputation for maiming or killing doctors."
Except now that he was back in the helmet and Steve's smell was gone, Tony was, for the first time, consciously aware of what was happening.  That was what the uninhibited heat of his mate felt like, post-bonding.
Steve's ability to logically think was soon going out the window. All he could see in front of him was a strong and capable alpha who could give him exactly what he needed.
Then the blond spoke to him, in his own language.  In Russian.
Steve grabbed a cup of coffee for himself and then headed into the bedroom. Steve could practically feel DeSoto's gaze boring into the fresh mark on the back of his neck.
In an instant Tony was bristling.  "Is Armando here? I swear to God, that asshole--"
"...as you know, Barnes was well-decorated post-humorously and is widely considered to be a war hero for his service in the 107th and the Howling Commandos," said Malick.
In the other room, Bruce Springsteen was playing, and Tony had a brief motion of appreciation.  Clearly, with the Corvette and his taste in music, Coulson was much less lame that Tony had initially thought.
Steve sighed. He could understand that from a rational level. There was no point getting angry...the important thing was that Donner was safe. "Well, thank you for coming David." They both stood and shared a brief handshake followed by a hug.
Donner offer George the coffee; George offered Donner his seat.  Donner eased into it with a groan.
but he'd been
"Please, sit, sit... ah, this is my son, T'Challa, the crown prince," said T'Chaka, gesturing to the silent, sullen figure still seated at the table.  T'Challa looked up at the sound of his name, his face a mask. He was slightly lighter-skinned than his father, clean-shaven, wearing a European-cut suit; Tony guessed he was about Steve's age, in his twenties, not yet thirty.  Tony couldn't tell if he spoke any English because he didn't seem especially involved in their conversation. He made no move to stand up and greet them like his father had; Tony took a hint.
"No," he said after a moment.  "
Tony regarded Steve thoughtfully.  Steve's words, about not loving him as much as he hated himself, had rung true, much louder than made Tony comfortable.
"Did you make the waffles yourself?" he asked, tone gently teasing.
Steve pushed the box towards him. "You choose."
"Oh, grow up," she said, and hit the accelerator.
"Also shoot a message to Pepper and let her know I need half a mil for a thing..."
Finally, he said, "Barney was the only family I had left.  My parents got killed when I was a kid. Car accident. We went in an orphanage, all-omega.  Ran away. He got traded. But that was twenty-two years ago, Steve. Barney would be in his forties now, and... after twenty-two years... if he didn't find me and I didn't find him..."  Clint let it hang.
"Hey," he said as Steve's eyes re-focused.
Back at the Triumph, Rhodey was trying to make small talk to put Donner at ease, but it was tough.  Donner refused to make eye contact and had virtually nothing to talk about because he'd done nothing but keep house for seven years.  He had remarkably few interests or hobbies; he followed a few shows but aside from that, Rhodey had never met a person with less of a personality.  Clearly, in the last seven years, Gideon hadn't had many conversations with his omega, at least not two-sided ones.
It's official.  They're in wuv.  :)  More smut, more fluff... enjoy.
He was trying not to panic now because he really, really didn't want to be re-trained; it was so painful.  But Karpov and another man were both getting up close to him and kept demanding the panic was rising rapidly.
"Thank God," said Pepper, surveying the damage to the kitchen.  "...well, we were due for a remodel anyway. Still, this was imported marble... I wish they'd been more careful..."  She sighed and put the kettle onto the stove. "Phil?!" she called. "Do you want to maybe come out of your nest now?"
"Agent Morse?  Yeah she is," said Mackenzie.
"Better two good omegas than one bad Alpha," said Donner sweetly, smiling.  "George has space in his flat and-- and Banksy's so lonely so-- so I hope it's okay, Steve-- if we-- if the three of us-- I mean,
There was some shuffling on the other side of the comm, then it cut out.
One of the women shrieked again and covered her head; the other jumped forward quickly to placate him.
"Alright, take... what is this... thirty-two?  Thirty-two already?  Jesus.  Okay.  Let's wrap this up, it's already eleven-ten."  He cleared his throat; the image skipped a few times and Tony held his breath, but the film continued to play.  "Welcome, ladies and gentleman, to the Stark Expo--"
"Yes.  We're retreating."
He hung up.
It was paradise.
"Dude, you okay?"
"Six and three-quarters," corrected JARVIS.
. Steve's body trembled with pleasure, his insides singing as he sank down and rose up over Tony. Slowly, he moved his hands to grip the edge of the tub behind Tony- he didn't want to hurt him and he needed to get off
"Clearly, they failed to sever the vas deferens completely.  If it's not a clean cut, they can heal."
this." And with that he clammed up, clenching his jaw and focusing on breathing.
Banksy rolled his eyes.  "See what I mean?" he said to Steve.
Sam sighed but didn't tell him to turn it off.  The truth was, Tony was right. The hallway was gloomy to the point of depression.  The ceiling was too low and there were no tiles on it to cover the pipes and wires that ran along it.  Their footsteps echoed because there was nothing in the hall to muffle the sound. Tony went first, his arc reactor lighting the way in front of them in a ghostly glow.  The doors were mostly unmarked, except with the occasional number: 3. 4. 5...
Steve was smiling and trying not to look smug. "Cute, huh? Well, I sincerely apologise for being so...cute," Steve murmured and then leaned in to kiss, his hand moving to the back of Tony's neck. The kiss was slow and languid and Steve shivered as their tongues slid together. When they parted it was reluctantly, Steve's cheeks pink from more than the just the shower now.
"...Steve, c'mere," said Tony, jerking his head over to the kitchen.  "I want to talk to you
"I suspect that, considering the state of Captain Rogers' body, his heats are rather more intense than most," said Gleason.  "Has he been following his prescriptions?"
The circular human bite was easily identifiable, shining out through the swelling, taking shape, becoming permanently.  It was a neat mark, distinctive. None of that tangled scar-mass that omegas that had been raped or violently force-bonded had.  No, this was a perfectly normal bond-mark. Not deforming.
Even now, even with Steve, Tony couldn't drop his sarcastic, easily distractible sense of humor.  No.  He'd never been able to drop it.  Just as he hadn't shed a tear when his parents died, Tony had never fully let up joking about the ninety-six days he had been held captive.  He didn't know what would come out if he did.  Besides, he'd never really had the time.  After his escape, it had been a whirlwind of press conferences and board meetings and trying to set his life in order again, and he'd never just sat down and thought about it.  Nor had he wanted to.  Tony preferred to compartmentalize things, and he happened to be very good at it.
Dr. Gleason leaned back.  "It was only a joke, Mr. Stark.  Cloacas were first described in chickens, if I recall correctly."
"I want in.  When's the debriefing?" he demanded.  If Steve was going to go, Tony was going to go with him.  Worse case scenario, he'd be able to haul Steve out of harm's way in the suit.  Even if Steve was kicking and screaming. It occurred to him, darkly, that if Steve hadn't miscarried in July, that by now he'd be three months along, and they'd probably know, and Steve sure as hell wouldn't be volunteering for stupid, dangerous missions.
Tony nuzzled the side of Steve's neck; Pepper peeled him off.
when the main character goes to see a drug lord in Columbia. Actually, it was almost
"Badges? Er, no?"
"Are you okay?" Steve asked, wincing a little as Tony was rushing down the steps of the Expo, jostling him. His grip was firm but cold on Steve's legs.
Steve's phone rang; it was Clint.
Her relaxation was interrupted suddenly; the door banged open and Bucky walked in.
"Okay."
"Who's
Tony set his chin on Steve's shoulder and kissed his earlobe lightly.  He didn't say anything because he had nothing witty to say.  His hand was still around Steve and he was sticky with the other one's fluids but he didn't move.  Holding Steve to him felt amazing; he wanted to savor it for a few minutes.
He was out of the bathroom in twenty minutes, toweling off his hair and loping toward the stairs to suit up.  Steve's shield was sitting by the door. Tony had tried to pick it up, once. It was a lot lighter than he'd expected.  Maybe the weight of a bowling ball.
"What happened to Trickshot anyway?" Steve asked and tried not to roll his eyes at how ridiculous all these goddamn names were.
It took Tony a second try to get Steve's attention; he had dived back underwater. Steve pushed himself out of the water, white boxers really not doing much to offer any decency now as he walked over to take the phone.
Steve could remember them all playing footsie under the table to try and pass the time. Falsworth would nudge Timothy and Steve's feet until he got their attention. Peggy used to watch on wearily. Once Steve kicked back too hard and hit Falsworth's chair, knocking him to the floor. But no one told Steve off, no one in England dared confront Captain America. Except for Peggy, who was constantly giving him shit for everything he did.
"Should I...should I sleep on the couch?" Steve called hesitantly.
... well, the important thing is, they didn't get any of my weapon designs.  That's what they wanted."  Tony looked up at Steve suddenly with a look of fierce pride.  "There was nothing they could've done for me to build those weapons for them.
"I think that's a great idea," said Pepper immediately.  Pepper had been trying to get Tony in any sort of support group or therapy for years.  He refused to talk to anyone about Afghanistan and at times had point-blank denied having night terrors or panic attacks even though Pepper had witnessed plenty of them with her own eyes.
a horse, Steve," he kept assuring him at the other's protests.
"He knew your father," said Natasha.  "They weren't on the best of terms when Howard passed."
"I was going to invite him over for dinner."
like sex, so--"
Eventually he came to a resolve and called the number. A sharp, female voice answered. "Who the hell is calling at this hour? You better have a good-"
"I hate when you get all philosophical on my ass.  Why can't you just tell me what I want to hear?"grumbled Tony.
This surprisingly heartfelt revelation was met with a beat of silence.
. Rationally, he knew it was but old forties anxieties still told him he just needed to be put in his place.
.  And I don't mean you smell like cardamon.  I mean you smell like the kind of guy who would run into a burning building to save a dog.  ...Erskine was an Alpha, wasn't he?  That's why he, and my dad, chose you, I think.  Because you just smell... I don't know...
"Oh please.  As if you don't have a thing for Banksy.  Everyone has a thing for Banksy. Even Pepper.  PEPPER!"
. No, that's an awful idea, JARVIS!  ...I'm really sorry, Steve, seriously. Pepper doesn't care, she's caught me doing all sorts of awful stuff, I mean, I'm kind of... renowned for being a pervert.  It's not like everyone doesn't know. I mean... you're an omega... there's nothing to be embarrassed about.  It's just sex.  She's won't let anyone know.  She's my best friend."  Tony caressed Steve's arms soothingly.  "And, Steve?  I don't... I don't have a lot of friends- you know that, but... but the ones I have, they're your friends, too, now.  I don't want you to feel... like you said, isolated.  I mean, I don't want to get a dog, but... but you know, you can talk to me, or to any of my inner circle, Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, and... we're... well, we're not from the forties, obviously, but we're your family now, and if there's anything I can do to make you feel better, excluding getting a dog or telling JARVIS to tell Pepper our roles were reversed, y'know... I wanna do it for you. I want you to be happy... want you to be comfortable."
When Tony clung to him he simply wound an arm around his shoulders and let his other hand run through the other's wet hair. Steve sighed gently and rested his head atop of Tony's briefly, letting his eyes slip shut as he savoured the moment. He could fell Tony's own sorrow in his chest and wished he could get rid of it for him.
The phone went off; Tony looked at it weakly.
"No.  Leave me alone.  This line is supposed to be open."
Another weird nonsense word.  Similar, but different.  That was the word he'd been called, a word that had been carried to him on a brisk spring breeze over a field of tulips and it had hurt, pierced his heart to hear it.  When was the last time he'd heard
"Stand there and look supportive... try not to cause any more trouble," said Pepper, barely looking at him.
"Drinks make depressed feelings worse Tony," Steve pointed out gently as he let himself be lead downstairs. He squeezed his hand back, helping Tony walk down the stairs again but not picking him up. "It's not my business to tell you how to live your life," he added. "But if I drank like you do...I don't think you'd let me."
Just as Steve reached for him the Winter Soldier lunged around and caught his arm. Steve had already grabbed at his hair with one hand; with the other, he slammed the heel of his palm up into his chin and made him reel enough so Fury could get out of his grip.
"I don't want to talk. I want to go to bed, for days. I want to sulk and have long baths and eat shitty food and I don't want to see anyone. I don't want sympathy. I want to be alone.So, please, Nat. Just leave it. Because I'm done-- I'm just...I have nothing left to give right now."
He opened the door and immediately found an omega.
"...I've already lost him," said Fury, looking toward the closed door to Steve's room.  "The World Security Council put the kibosh on the Avengers' Initiative over this. Maybe getting frozen and unfrozen messed his head up or something... I don't know.  But we can't have field agents we can't control, or at least predict."
He grabbed the guard that hadn't been shot, since he felt the blood stain would be too conspicuous, and dressed with military efficiency, his shirt buttoned and his shoes laced (one size too small; unfortunate) before the omega was done.
He looked into Gideon's eyes; he looked right into him and saw
"Yeah, and DeSoto got put on the table, too," said Fred.  "That's when Andy folded. We only lost about forty thou. ...I mean, it's a lot, but Andy always comes to this this expecting to spend a ton of money, so it was budgeted."
"There.  There's him."
"You opening a tab?" asked the bartender.
"--he wasn't my Alpha then and he certainly isn't now. Just because he put his mark on me doesn't make me his. So will people stop goddamn
The last time Steve had been on live TV, he had been standing behind the president and had had no lines.  He had been instructed merely to smile.
Bucky didn't like needles.  He hadn't ever since Azzano, since those days as a POW when Dr. Zola had injected unknown substances into his veins that burned and crawled and itched like worms under the skin.
"Noooo..." whined Tony softly, already curling up into the seat.  He fell asleep within moments, leaving Steve alone with the radio.  By the time they got home, Tony had apparently forgotten all about his plans for the evening.  He growled weakly when Steve tried to wake him up.  "Carry me," he mumbled, throwing his arms around Steve's neck.
He reached up shakily to touch Steve's chin and leaned his head up to kiss him softly.
Steve was a tricky person to 'hold', mostly just because of his size. But if felt good to have Tony pressed up against his back and breathing soundly against his neck. It had been so long since Steve had experienced this sort of physical closeness... it was strange but not unwelcome. Tony's hands were warm against him, and grounding. And it was good to trust that Tony wouldn't try any funny business when Steve was in this state. Whatever this 'state' was.
Steve cried out as some unknown force plowed him into the snow, and his ankle screamed in protest. He trembled as he pushed himself up, fingers going numb in the snow. His goggles had been ripped off of his forehead and he couldn't see anything aside from the whiteness of the snow.
"Any other injuries?"
Tony's brain was already screaming through the math.  "Five years? He was born in sixty-five?"
"No problem, Ginny.  You already do a ton," said Happy.
"He's older than me," corrected Tony.
"What about the Winter Soldier?" asked Rhodes point-blank.
"Emergency suppressants.  But it was a long shot, with your metabolism, anyway."
Steve was never cold. His serum made it almost impossible. And now he was going into
Sitting in a desk chair, legs propped up on the desk and cradling a black office phone, George was chatting away pleasantly.  "...Cynthia's still waiting to hear from Vermont, but at least she's already got Washington and Lee, and frankly I thought that they had better--"
that look.
"A guy tried to buy me once. He was about forty, like most of the Alphas here. My ma needed the money, and she was struggling to find work after she'd been laid off at the hospital. It must have been tempting. I even told her that I wouldn't mind but we knew nothing about the guy. I was sixteen, the legal bonding age was younger. I was small and ill all the time, if he'd bought me, I wouldn't have survived a pregnancy or anything like that.  ...but my ma chased him off.  She said I would bond when I was ready, not when we needed the money.  And she got a temporary job at a laundry place until she found another hospital to work in."
"...I, uh, I'm actually not that hungry.  Not all of us have metabolisms like yours.  Just coffee is fine," said Tony awkwardly, withdrawing his hand.  The more he woke up, the more aware he was becoming of how desperately he needed a drink.  Not because he was stressed or sad.  No, quite the opposite.  If anything he was drinking to celebrate how well everything was going.  "It looks amazing, though, really," he added graciously.
"I'm pretty sure seven fingers is just an entire tumbler."
omega, how was he supposed to get through to
Steve shuddered as Tony licked into his mouth then came inside of him, almost suddenly. The sensation of being filled was enough to drive Steve over the edge. He rode out his orgasm with a high-pitched cry, his head thrown back, as Tony's hands squeezed at his waist and Steve's insides squeezed at his Alpha's cock. Even with the condom on it felt so
"It was just a few hours," Steve tried to assure Phil as he accepted his coffee. But they both knew it had been at least eight. Tony was addictive in nature. Once he had an itch he had to scratch it. Steve remembered when he once hit the thirty six hour mark and he had to literally drag him out and make him eat food.
"You go do nothing upstairs... I just wanna go downstairs for a bit and check on 4UMM-E," said Tony as they drove up the long drive to the circular front of the house.  "Oh! And we should call Margaret Turner, find out what her deal is!" He realized, with small pang of disappointment, that Piper hadn't joined the walk-out. Piper didn't seem happy and she didn't seem like she'd chosen Eric.  On the other hand, Eric didn't seem like as big a jerk as the rest of them.
Then Gideon leaned in closer, still smiling. "What? What are you going to do?"
"ANTHONY!" bellowed someone.
Donner bit his lip and looked back down at the water bottle.
"...okay," said Tony.  "...I should probably talk about this with my POSSV group, anyway."  He looked down guiltily. He felt like he'd almost proven to Steve exactly what he was trying to say.  That he was a bad person. That he had the ability to manipulate Steve, that he was an Alpha and Steve was a vulnerable omega and that it would always be that way.
He shuddered as he came, ejaculating into Steve's mouth, murmuring his omega's name lovingly as his hips bucked.  "Omega... Steve... omega..." he purred, squirming, arching, enjoying the inviting warm wetness of Steve's mouth.
, thought Steve.
Steve had gone as white as a sheet.  "But- he can't-- we looked for him.  No one could've survived that fall."
"Can I get either of you anything?  Coffee? Scotch, Mr. Stark?"
Tony's eyes flicked up to meet Steve's.  For once, they weren't roaming all over his body.  "...thanks, Steve, but I got a lot to make up for. I treated you really bad.  And probably will again. As much as it pains me to admit it, I am not perfect.  ...it's kind of funny that I was so paranoid about you having another Alpha that I basically pushed you into a situation where you ended up..."
"Miss Potts," said JARVIS suddenly.  "There's a guest upstairs."
"So am I. I was thinking of wearing the Cap uniform; would that be weird? I just, maybe the kids..."
"I don't have the tights," Steve shrugged. "Don't think they would have lasted 70 years. I went through about one pair a performance." Steve was always told off for moving around too much, or sitting with his legs too wide. 'Don't sit like an Alpha' they used to tell him.
There wasn't camps in the forties that he knew of. An omega was an omega and that was that. There was barely any consideration given into the prospect of changing them. After all they were not proper people; they weren't
to get you off of me, you are sadly mistaken.  This is really doing it for me, actually," breathed Tony softly, staring into Steve's eyes.  Then, barely audible, suddenly serious, he added, "...I trust you."
The stagehand held up a board that said,
"Kerry is a woman," replied Angela, who had also wandered over.  "He's expecting Richard Emmett. We need a male Alpha to go and he's got to be unbonded."
Tony broke away, looking down at Steve's flushed face, his swollen lips.  He felt his heart skip a beat.
"Nothing," said Tony, looking away.
," Nick pointed out flatly.
Sam nodded slowly, his gaze drifting over to Tony. "And are you coming?"
Most of his face was concealed by goggles and a mask (a muzzle?) over his mouth.  What few features were visible were blurry, as if Steve was seeing them from underwater.
A slender woman in a backless red dress passed by them holding a martini.  Tony plucked it from her hand, grinned devilishly, and slid a hand down her spine.  She giggled and pressed a kiss on his cheek, leaving a smudge of red lipstick.  "Happy birthday, Mr. Stark."
Eric looked up.  "You mean Gene Bennett?  He just went outside for a smoke.  He'll be back."
"What they did to you in there," Steve said softly. "But I'm very aware this is not the place to have that kind of discussion. But I'm looking into camps, and anything you can tell me about them would be greatly appreciated. If I give you my number, maybe after this insane conference, you could give me a call?"
Steve almost smiled. "Maybe Nick is softer than he lets on."
"What are you, a pervert?" asked Nate.
When Tony took the collar off Steve hadn't even realised he'd been holding his breath until it was gone, the loss of the heavy weight making him feel...strange, almost.

"Don't have anything else," Steve pointed out.

Tony faked surprise.  "They
He lapsed into silence when the waiter arrived with their drinks.  He served in order of dominance, having probably consulted someone else while getting their order.  Malick first, then Tony, then Steve. Malick eyed Tony's drinks warily, unused to anyone being brash enough to down six shots in front of him.
"...it's not exactly hard to make Steve look good," Tony pointed out.
"Situation?" Stone echoed and frowned a little. "I do hope everything is quite alright, Captain," he said, eyes flitting over Steve as if his appearance would somehow provide answers. The post-heat scent still probably lingered if one was really looking for it but that was about all the cues Stone would get. Steve's face remained unreadable.
He threw back his scotch, handed it to a nearby omega without looking, and blurted, "How do you know they're comfortable?  Have you ever tried one on?" He was sort of hoping this would shed some light on Lydia's status.
His words had zero effect and were given no time to have one; the door burst open and five people walked in.  One of them was Fury.  The other was Coulson.

Tony's grip on Steve's hand tightened a little.

my dad.  I think he was more upset over Dad's death than I was.  He, uh... he had that thing... Takotsubo syndrome." Tony finally snagged the olive and popped it into his mouth.  "...but he never wore a collar," he added.
"It's from the President's office, sir."
Gideon smiled like a shark. Steve wanted to slam his arm against his neck and throw him against the wall. He wanted to demand to know everything. But Gideon wasn't to give him anything.
A silence settled over them.  Tony gave Steve's knee a squeeze and then rose to get himself coffee, not knowing what else to say.  He'd thought he had enough to be guilty about, what with the whole weapons thing. Now omega rights, too?  Fuck.
"You still half asleep, hm?"
," he said in a poorly disguised command.
"Lift your hips," commanded Tony, hitching Steve's hips a little higher up on his shoulders.  He'd done this hundreds of times with women but it was rather different with Steve.
He crossed the room to sit on the couch and get the remote.  He had to push aside the vase of roses and the small black box.
"Fuck." Steve's eyes fluttered shut and he slumped against the sheets.
"Someone's on the fire escape," he whispered.
"You're a monster," said Wanda, sounding genuinely shocked by Tony's callousness.

"It's just a bad day," Steve told the guy (his name was Marcus) tactfully as he gently rubbed a hand up and down Tony's back. George passed over their pizza boxes. Steve wasn't sure he really felt like eating now himself.
Steve didn't know how long they say there like that. But eventually the tight feeling in his chest began to wane, so he hoped it was for Tony too. He rocked him gently, strong arms keeping him warm. Steve didn't know what else to say other than reassurances. He didn't know what was up in the first place.
Aria sighed in the background. "
And then he was back under, trembling with stress, softly panting and wheezing.
Then there was the whole arc reactor thing.  He hadn't told her. He'd kept her in the dark.  He'd been dying and he'd been doing it alone.
"Ninety-three," said Tony proudly, curling an arm possessively around Steve's waist.
"Yeah, well, they're... second cousins... twice removed?" said Rhodey, who was still puzzling over their distant connection.
," Steve whispered. "I'm begging you. We just want to help. This place is shutting down anyway; you probably won't have a job to come back to, so don't worry about getting into trouble."
He's working with Vanko."
"I scheduled time for you two to do some of the things Steve might be interested in.  Statue of Liberty, Coney Island, a trip to Brooklyn--"
"Great.  Now.  Where’s my blue tie?”"
"Steve's actually very bossy," interjected Tony, his tone light and teasing.
"No... want pizza..." said Tony, sitting down heavily in someone else's chair.
"Love you too," Steve whispered, turning his head to press a kiss into Tony's hair before he let his own eyes slip shut.
meant taking off your shirt for the Associated Press and letting them body paint you.  ...did Stark rub off on you?  Is this like a midlife crisis?  Because trust me, Steve, I know how sometimes you get hurt when you go under, but..."  She trailed off.  "I can't even imagine how hard this has been for you, Steve.  Мне очень жаль.  There will be others.  But you can't hole up in your apartment and refuse all of my calls and then go crazy like this over a bad job.  There were better ways to tell everyone than doing it behind everyone's back like this."  She sighed.  "Come on, let me and Clint take you out tonight, and let's go in together on Monday to try to sort things out.  You'll feel better once you get back to work.  I always do."
"Call me your Alpha," demanded Gideon.
"And HYDRA," echoed Sitwell thoughtfully, looking out the window.
"I think I can handle it. Though, it would be easier for you to just come along quietly. But without a fight, it’s not as fun." Steve smirked, leading to his motorcycle. "There she is. My old Harley." He said with a soft smile.
"Daddy shays I 'ony cwy wen m'tired," Peter protested, flushing at Steve's words, "I schaid I wuz sowwy, Papa...."
"You'll always be my bambi," he murmured, "Always. I promise you that."
"It’s beautiful, Tony..." He whispered, a light fluttering in his chest.
Tony sighed sadly and motioned to the boy, pulling him into his lap.
Tony had never thought he'd meet an omega more self-assured or powerful than Steve, but Irshad
"Okay, Steve, all you really need to do is tail Tony and pretty much keep him in line.  Piece of cake.  That means no more than four drinks an hour--" Pepper was saying.
"Yes.  When I smoked, he'd cough.  We didn't have enough money for a tree.  We both liked the Brooklyn Dodgers. His eyesight wasn't so great, though, and we never got good seats.  I always wanted to catch a foul ball but I never did."
This mission was never given a proper name, so we have opted to called it "Mission: Cigar Run" after JARVIS's comments in the previous chapter.  Enjoy.
Steve pulled out his phone, sending Tony a quick text as he sat down on the other side.
Howard's next words were garbled again and the film jumped slightly.  Howard reached out and his hand touched the small of Jarvis's back, gently guiding him.  Jarvis glanced over his shoulder with a smile; Howard smiled back and leaned forward.  They shared a brief, tender kiss.
He sat down cross-legged so they could talk through the little slot at the bottom.
"Well, apparently he enjoys annoying me," Steve grumbled, clearly not happy at DeSoto loitering around. Their room was supposed to be their refuge from conference life; now they had nothing. Nowhere. "Tell him you don't want him and
"I wanna talk to your mate."
"Yes, but Steve's an omega."
"No! Jesus. Fucking spies."
Pepper appeared.  "Tony's singing that song he always sings when he's being a cad.  Did he embarrass Steve?" she asked.
smug.”  He couldn’t help it.  “What makes you think I’m smug?”
It was a surprise. But Steve managed it- just barely. He swallowed it down, only a little spent escaping from the corners of his mouth. He licked and sucked Tony clean diligently before pulling off and pressing a kiss to the head and licking his own lips. Steve had honestly expected it taste gross but it was simply new, strange perhaps. Maybe because Tony was his mate the psychical details weren't so important. It was all just about how he was making his Alpha feeling.
. Past tense!  Now I'm more alive than I ever have been thanks to my bigger, blonder, better half.  Didja see the cover of the
The room was filled with smoke; there were no prisoners.  Only a pile of unidentifiable debris in one cell and words smeared on the wall in blood: I DO NOT CONSENT.
Steve laughed quietly, letting Tony take his hand. Tony was practically vibrating with excitement. He didn't get why locks were so fascinating but Tony was obviously engrossed in it all.
Tony bit his shoulder with a groan.
Tony didn't
The footsteps and shouting in the hall had quieted down, which must mean that the guards were organizing themselves, getting into position, Steve figured. He sighed. "Don't give them an opportunity to shoot him," he murmured to Natasha, meaning the scientist. He wasn't prepared to kill herself for the cause, good for him, but the soldiers would certainly take the chance. Natasha was still fuming, giving off a kind of ferocious energy which honestly just made Steve all the more pumped.
He frowned.  More pregnancy rumors.
He changed tactics.  "Steve, what's wrong?  Lay it on me.  I'll listen."  Tony tried to look attentive, and not like he'd just been threatened by a guy with the power to reverse-engineer one of his suits.  Whatever Steve's fears about the Barnes-Soldier situation was, Tony was confident that it couldn't possibly be as big as problem as Vanko.  Tony's life had radically re-prioritized itself in the last week, and now revolved madly around his omega.  As long as Steve was his, as long as Steve was safe, everything else would fall into place.  It was incredible how fulfilling this bond thing was; Tony had to admit, he'd been missing out.  But he was glad he'd waited for Steve, that the two of them were able to find each other after all this time, that they'd approached this from the same place of inexperience and cautious delicacy.
"Come on." Steve squeezed his hand gently. "Don't you wanna dance?"
short!  Steve's just really tall!  And I'm not the least dominant guy here, Pitbull--"
"You think his ideas are wacky?" asked Donner.  He never made eye contact with the Alphas, instead staring at their throats or chests.  Tony disliked it because it gave the impression that Donner was staring at his arc reactor.
He didn't like the smell of cigarettes. He never had. Steve associated it with coughing fits and cold walks home through streets full of dingy-looking bars. Back in the forties omegas never smoked. It simply wasn't the done thing. And it probably would have killed Steve if he'd tried to pick it up.
Tony stared curiously at the bag on the table.  He couldn't think of anything Steve could possibly get him.  He had a vivid mental image of a t-shirt with a phrase like
...Steve's heart ached.
The man grinned maniacally as he was hauled to his feet.  "...you lose, Stark!" he said, laughing hysterically.  "Not-so-invincible Iron Man!  ...you lose!"  He burst into a fit of laughter and Tony stared at him, completely and totally lost, the beginnings of a killer headache starting behind his eyes.
mission," said Coulson.  "November third, 1943."
"Good-night, Jimmy," said Dr. Ludheim with a smirk, and then he was unconscious.
Steve knew there was old feelings there. But Bucky coming for him was serious. And yet Tony was more concerned with who Pepper was dating...that said it all, really. Some wake up call it had been, Steve thought. Tony wanted to Steve, so long as he could think about Pepper being his too. Tony must still want a trio, even if he wouldn't say it.  But Steve had been
"Okay, how about this one?"
"Oh Steve, you always were good at getting into messes," Peggy sighed fondly from where she lay back in bed. The Alpha had aged well. She recognised him and remembered most of the time they'd shared. A lot of her physical appearance had changed but she still had the same eyes; they still held the same kindness that they did before. She was gently running her fingers through his hair, Steve's head leant on the bed, his eyes half drooping shut. He'd only gotten into London that morning. He was tired from the jet lag and the fact that he was struggling to keep food down, which was very unlike him.
"I like it here," said Clint, perched on top of the fridge.
"Fuck, m'late?  Fuck," said Tony, dragging a hand down his face.  "...does my dander look any better?" He reached behind himself and touched the back of his neck.  It was still tender and puffy, but it felt a lot better. He was hoping it wasn't outwardly noticeable.  He didn't want anyone staring at his neck.
"Nothing!"
Steve frowned a little. "Excuse me a moment," he pulled away and headed over to Rex. The man's collar was like Steve's, classy but subtle. He didn't even look up from his book until Steve said: "Hey--"
They maneuvered through the press with well-practiced ease.  No one paid Steve any mind.  He handed Tony his smoothie once they were in the car.  He’d eaten about four bagels himself before they left.  It didn’t matter if some random kitchen staff noticed his super soldier appetite, but he tried to reflect at least semi-normal eating habits in front of Tony.  Tony looked almost nervous for someone who was just going to be watching a race.  The Monaco Grand Prix was supposed to be a relaxing bit of time off for him, but Tony seemed distracted and worried.  Steve frowned a little, then quickly composed himself, knowing Tony hated when people acted concerned for him.
do something mental he tries emotional blackmail," Steve muttered to himself, frowning as he turned a corner sharper than he should have. "Typical. Fucking typical. But you know what? My self-esteem isn't low enough to put with that shit," he half-talking to himself but he was okay with that. "He's
"Listen, I won't push you away.  You're here. ...it's better if we know."
"No," said Tony, voice tinny from within the suit.
"Yeah.  Yeah, it's me, Steve.  What's wrong? I felt you panicking," he said, clearing his throat a little.  "Do you need me? I can be there in a few minutes if you need--"
"Shit!  Pepper, I gotta go, I just lost Steve."
Peggy's eyes were tender.  "Howard was terrible at appreciating the things he had, Tony.  He loved Steve because he lost him. It doesn't meant he loved you any less."
One of Tony's peacocks strutted past; Tony shooed it out of the way.  "HAPPY!" he barked.
Donner contemplated his juice glumly.  Clearly, he didn't agree. Tony bet both he and Gideon were fans of Frond's.  Frond had pointed out that omegas, especially male omegas, were only designed for one thing: procreation.  She also pointed out that the disgust males of other statuses felt toward them was natural. They were an evolutionary glitch; seeing a man pregnant was weird.  Male omegas were best kept in the house, away from other people's judgements, to be pampered and kept safe by their Alphas... like they were fragile, ugly, purebred dogs or something.
Traffic had come to a grinding halt; there was the car parked in front of them, of course, in the middle of the road, but there were also two men with guns targeting Fury.
But he didn't express his fear.  Instead, he said, "yes, sir."
"Remi and Danielle are releasing a statement from SA this afternoon, we think everything you said was
There was a glass of water on the coffee table. Steve reached for it and downed it in a single gulp.
"No, of course not.  You're better off now than you were when we found you."  Karpov blew a smoke ring. "Myself... I'm bonded to my work.  To you. No program is perfect, of course, but you... you're as close as it gets."  He gave him a sideways look, then reached out to touch his cheek.
Typical Tony; while sneaking off to the lab to tinker with the Mark VII, he'd also been immersing himself in Russian language tapes.  The Mark VII was coming together, but slowly. Tony hadn't yet given up on the idea of having a self-assembling, non-gantry suit that would come to him, but the problem was that having heavy flying pieces of metal come at him at high velocities was not ideal, to say the least.  Also, getting the plate tabs to lock together properly on a moving subject without stabilization gantry surrounding them was proving to be a tricky technical challenge.
Tony knew he should be impressed by seeing an orchid with black petals but he was so sick of his house being filled with orchids in every color that he was sort of over them.  He feigned interest. "Yeah, I see it. That's very generous. Thank you. We love it, don't we, Steve?"
They knew Trickshot's real name, of course, but it was hard for Tony to think of him as anything other than Trickshot.
"...after this you're
David chuckled.  "Yes, in a manner of speaking.  The scent glands behind the ears are at maybe a sixty-degree angle above the gland and they're connected with a bundle of nerves.  Not a coincidence. They express during mating and heat."
From the front steps of his house, Tony jutted the heels of his hands out, hit the jets, and shot upward, leaving Steve below.
"Money can buy anything.  I'll figure something out."  He wrote himself a note:
"How much is that vase worth?"
Tony had never seriously thought of any of that stuff.  It was just another history lesson for him, because he'd never really interacted with omegas at all, except Jarvis.  Tony felt a stab of regret.  Jarvis would have had an invaluable historical perspective on omegas; he'd been born in the teens, like Steve, and lived through the slow process of omega rights.  Tony wasn't sure if he'd ever voted, what that felt like; if Howard and him had gone to the polls together, if Jarvis had felt excitement, what his attitude was on the whole thing.  Jarvis had been so subservient that Tony often forgot that he was a real person... he felt a twinge of shame, knowing that he'd never sat down and had any sort of real conversation with the man.  Jarvis had helped raise Tony, yes, but he'd been like a sort of nanny and Tony had never appreciated his role in the house as anything more than a very wise butler.  Their conversations had been one-sided, focused only on Tony.  Tony had never asked him about himself.  Now his oral history was lost forever.
"You're a true wordsmith, Mr. Stark," said the doctor with a light smile.  He pulled a tube of ointment out of his bag and offered it to Tony. Tony took it gratefully.
Steve was practically trembling with fury. And his heat. But mostly the former, and he looked about ready to tear Gideon's head off. If only his goddamn body would work. Now Tony was here, and he felt safe, all he fear had dissipated and in its place was anger. A righteous kind.
He really,
Did that mean Natasha and Clint knew too? Did everyone in SHIELD know? Was this only news to Tony and Steve? Steve was furiously pacing now. "Clint's brother," he said. "
The doctor rose.  "Lead the way, Captain."
Biting Steve's flesh was pure bliss and he was unable to keep from grinding himself against Steve a little.  He pulled away reluctantly, double-checking his work (much better!) and then cupped Steve's cheek in his right hand, stroking the skin with his thumb.
weird," said Tony awkwardly.  He could feel Steve's upset and it bothered him because, well... Tony's last girlfriend before Steve had been nineteen.  And the one before that, twenty-three. Tony didn't consider it creepy; he liked beautiful women and besides,
"Maybe I shouldn't go on TV until after this conference then," Steve said tentatively. "They'd ask me to explain everything and I don't want to ruin the surprise."

"Oh, no, no, I'm just here to mingle.  You, Stark?"
Steve nodded, going to get a glass of water. "What's up? It's early."
. And it would feel even better once--
All he could really do was try to be a better mate to his current Alpha.
Tony huffed.  "I don't know.  ...warm. Comforting.  Like... warm... yeasty... musky..."
"You kill him, then you have nothing to black mail me with," Steve pointed out with a grim kind of smile. "And I'm still pretty sure the government has their heart set on super solider babies, even though y-you won't admit it.  And I would rather die, then d-do
"But Tony could still override that."
Steve stared sideways at Tony. Then back at the 'adult' omega in front of him. He should probably go back upstairs and get dressed but the pancakes smelled really good...
Rhodey sighed. "Dammit. Fine. When is this?"
"Yeah, sorry," said Tony, glancing down at the bright-white circle on his chest.  He looked back up. Sam was a wavy human blob of yellows and oranges. "You heard Steve, they need to get into some locked stairwell.  Find me a key card or a breaker box and I pull the whole system offline."
Fury scowled.
"I don't think he was actually going to go all the way to Iowa.  Sometimes he'd run off for a day but then Alpha would go find him and bring him back.  Uh, so, while we were arguing outside like that, Alpha went and got a gun--"
The dance was lovely. That was the only word for it. And when they parted Steve felt a little sad for it.  Or maybe he was feeling Tony's feelings; for some reason, Tony felt oddly nostalgic.
"...Rhodey?" he called into the headset tentatively.
Emmett," he corrected.  "And... and this must be Donner."
whilst he lay back on a mound of cushions inside the den itself and slept seemingly peacefully. The den was pointed at the top and very nearly touched the ceiling. Pepper thanked God she didn't have to deal with this in her own life and went to make coffee.
"I got it."
"I think I like the walk on you a little better." He laughed, turning the water on for them. "Didn't mean to hurt you, though."
"It's okay," Tony mumbled back, tracing shapes on Steve's chest, "I'd just rather not think about it."
"Okay. Yeah, yeah, real date," he mumbled, "Dates and--and dating stuff--"
"I'll tell 'em you partied too hard." Steve chuckled back. "I can bring a plate up to you so you can rest? As a peace offering for making you sore." He grinned as he started to stand.
He laughed, crawling out of the bath and drying himself off, hobbling towards his dresser to pull on pajamas.
