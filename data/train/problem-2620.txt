Mildred nods with approval and hands him the rest of Sam’s paperwork. Dean bends down and shoves it in Sam’s backpack before hefting the bag up over his shoulder again.
“Or maybe they’re standing here in the lobby talking to me right now,” Cas said. “Do we need to start over with the introductions, or can I show you to your room now?”
“And you chose to liberate yourself,” Dean said, grinning and holding up his half-empty beer bottle in salute.
Dean might never reciprocate his love the same way Cas felt for him, but everything they could have on Earth would at least be real. It would be theirs, and their choices and consequences to deal with. He couldn’t explain the difference to someone without a soul, but he knew that Jack would understand perfectly. The happiness wasn’t just in the saying it, but in the having it, too. And he wanted it, no matter what it would mean in the end. It was a chance, and a choice, and endless possibility without the burden of duty to Heaven or Chuck’s Grand Plan. Cas had been shredding Chuck’s plans for years now, thanks to Dean. Chuck would absolutely hate that one of his angels would choose to renounce his power in its entirety and truly embrace humanity. He could, for the first time in his long existence, simply be himself.
Sam shrugged. “Is there anything Donna can’t handle, though? Jody would probably drive out if we asked her to help, too.”
The Queen didn’t reply right away, and he figured she was busy talking some other poor author off a ledge. He’d surely hear all about it soon enough, and decided to check out some of his other social media. Twitter was a Saturday morning wasteland, outside of a few people posting Pinefest claims excitement and more #caturday posts than he could count. At least they brought a smile to his face as he switched over to tumblr. It was an effective way to kill a few hours.
Dean stopped walking down the stairs, and Amara almost bumped into him. He turned to blink up at her on the step above him, and then gawped at Jack.
She glanced at his badge, leaning in to read his name. “I don’t know what to tell you, Agent Stark. All those tests came back perfectly normal. I don’t know what you and your team hope to find.”
The couch cushion dipped and Cas reached over and took the bottle from Dean’s hands. Dean didn’t put up a fight, only hung his head as Cas sat there trying to figure out what to do or say to that. Dean didn’t give him a chance to respond.
Friday morning proceeds without incident. The toaster in Gabriel’s kitchen doesn’t explode on him, and he’s able to enjoy an excellent cup of coffee with his morning bagel. His walk to work is refreshingly shorter than he was used to, but fascinating in entirely new ways. He makes note of the grocery store that Gabriel had mentioned, as well as a book shop and another storefront with a window cluttered with strange and slightly macabre items labeled “oddities” that he decides could provide an interesting shopping experience at some point in the future.
Sam cruised down the road toward the bunker. After far too many hours of nonstop driving, the curse was finally breaking down. He’d gritted his teeth and powered his way through Chicago, and after that it had been relatively smooth sailing. Even the little town of Lebanon had only proved to be mildly uncomfortable to drive through, but he was grateful when he finally shut off the engine in the garage. Everything was beautifully silent for just a few minutes. He considered just staying right where he was, flopping over on the front seat and not moving until he woke up. He closed his eyes and leaned his head back, intent on doing just that.
“I guess there’s a good chance you’re trying to avoid dealing with this, or with me, but you owe me, Castiel. I signed off on your residency here, and I can just as easily end it. And I only just remembered hospital issued phones have GPS installed, so by the time you’re done listening to this message, I’ll know where you’re hiding out. Expect me any time. One way or another, you’re gonna have to deal with this.”
We’re not hiding it from him, or ashamed to tell him. We’re just….” he trailed off, dropping his boots to the floor and nudging them under the couch with his foot before standing up and cupping Cas’s cheeks between his palms, at a loss for words looking into Cas’s eyes smiling back at him.
The entity tilted its head, intrigued by this suggestion. “Yes, yes I want that. And since you’ve gobbled up all of Chuck’s power, I trust that he won’t be meddling in my affairs anymore either?”
They didn’t let go of one another for a long minute or two. When Dean finally released him enough to get a good look at his face, he had to rein in the jumbled backlog of things he finally felt he could say to Cas. After all, they were still standing in a doorway with Jack and Amara watching on like the gooey-eyed audience of the finale of the Bachelor or something. What Dean had to say to Cas didn’t need an audience. Without fully letting go of him, Dean slowly turned around to see Jack and Amara both just standing and staring at them with heart eyes and warm smiles. He cleared his throat, bringing them back around to reality. He pointed a finger at Jack.
“Sugar is sugar, Cas.” Dean assured him. “I’ll try the guava tomorrow. We gotta be here early enough there’s no chance they’ll be sold out yet.”
With a begrudging groan, Dean tossed the pen he’d been idly fidgeting with onto the table atop their notes and levered himself up off the sofa, feeling the long day’s work catching up to him. He stretched out a kink in his back and yawned again. Cas grinned at him like he was on the verge of suggesting Dean take up yoga or something. Dean shook his head to ward it off, but Cas commented anyway.
Dean let out a disgruntled sigh and stepped away from the patient. He stripped off his bloody gloves and grumbled under his breath, “Hard to hear any advice as friendly when you start off calling me a dumbass.”
He spent the first few minutes feeling like he was about to get caught, nervously glancing up every few seconds, certain the internet police were about to barge in and arrest him for writing smut on company time. He’d reread the same paragraph three or four times without processing any of the words before he finally began to recover his chill and got into the story. Dean kept one eye on the clock, and still managed to get through four more chapters before marking his place with a note for Feathers and carefully logging out.
He paused and looked at Dean, who stood as rapt as any of them as Cas continued. “Hester was right. The moment I touched your soul, I was lost to Heaven. But I was found in every other possible way. Nothing in billions of years could compare to what I’ve grown to be in the last twelve years.”
Dean’s about to object that he’s booked solid until seven, and he’ll probably get a few walk ins on top of that, but Sam holds both hands up-- even the one in the sling-- to stop him.
“I was afraid of that,” Sam says with a groan as he begins unbuttoning his flannel. “See that, Dean? He wants to get a better look at
: Nah, it was a slow day. No worries. I’m surprised you found the time to get any editing done yourself. And kinda glad your day didn’t turn out as busy as you were expecting.
Dean doesn’t stand around waiting for an answer, but goes about the rest of his usual morning routine with Cas in tow. He fills up his coffee mug, and does the same for Cas. The two of them head down to the shop just as Jody, Donna, and Claire come through the back door. Donna gives them a look of surprise, but quickly walks over to Cas and gives him a warm hug.
School might not have been starting officially for a few more days, but Dean’s work had already begun in earnest. Answering emails from parents concerned about their child’s classroom placements, familiarizing himself with the school’s policies and procedures, and stressing over the speech he’d been asked to give during the orientation assembly scheduled for the end of the week kept him busy for most of the morning. There was also the matter of meeting the rest of the staff, which he was both excited about and nervous for. He’d smiled and waved at a few folks passing by his office throughout the morning, but he must’ve looked too busy to bother. Either that or he was just a mild curiosity as the new guy, and the rest of the returning staff were trying to scope him out from a distance. He’d meet them all soon enough, he figured. Until then, he mostly tried to keep his head down and get through his morning.
“So bye bye Zachariah, most likely,” Dean said. “No more boring sanctimonious speeches and mandatory staff meetings, at least.”
this whole mess was generated by a few bad actors with some sort of personal grudge against you.” He stopped and stared directly at Dean with a raised eyebrow, as if he wanted the significance of what he was saying to sink in before waving one hand in a little circle and proceeding with his announcement.
Cas nods, blown away by the absolute sincerity blazing across Dean’s face. He’s just as curious to know why Dean reacted so strongly to his desire for wing tattoos as Dean seems to be to continue their conversation. It gives him a strange little thrill to be part of this, to share some secret hidden connection to Dean, and he can’t help what he says next.
“Says the guy who has cut ties with the only member of his family he’s even told me about,” Dean replied, cringing at his own callousness. Dredging his whole sordid history up, no matter how unintentionally, always set him on edge and turned him into the human version of sandpaper. “Sorry, that came out sounding way harsher than I intended it.”
Cas nodded and took the phone from Dean’s hand, holding it close to his face and squinting at the blurry image. “He’s setting up something.”
“Well, yeah,” Dean replied, feeling strangely okay with admitting that out loud. “That was the idea, right? With all the kissing and the confessing out in the other room, I thought we were finally getting somewhere.”
“So you said you got Dean’s number from a hunter?” Sam asked. It was probably a good place to begin, at least enough to fill the uncomfortable silence in Dean’s wake.
Dean’s second morning at school had started out a lot easier than the first. He’d already jumped the hurdle of meeting all the other teachers, and even felt like he’d made a few friends. His scheduled lunch date with Cas occupied at least half his thoughts as he went through his usual morning routine. The other half were firmly fixated on the fic he’d have to wait until after school to read. He gave a last longing glance at his laptop as he headed out the door. It helped to remind himself that Feathers was probably facing the same frustration he was.
“Call me Sam,” he replied, handing her his fake business card. “And call me if you think of anything that might help us narrow this down.”
At least Impala admitted he felt bad for bailing on him without any notification, and promised to spend the next claims day hanging out with him. It was only a year away. Small comfort, since Cas was still on his own for this year. This was the moment his brain chose to remind him that he’d had an offer for something that would’ve proven entirely distracting. An offer he’d turned down not once, but
The Chief sighed and looked down at her feet, defeated. “I really thought it was supposed to be, you know? It sounds like such a good idea on the surface, nobody keeping secrets, no one lying to each other, but there’s plenty of things we keep to ourselves because civilization falls apart otherwise.”
Dean made a disgusted noise and pushed himself up off the sofa. At least he could admit to himself he was avoiding talking to Feathers yet. He’d told Charlie he planned to write tonight, to use all that pent up energy over claims to make loads of angsty new words. But even the prospect of writing some good old fashioned blood-soaked monster case fic couldn’t hold his attention with the threat of talking about his personal life hanging over his head. He didn’t even have an afternoon hanging out with Cas to look forward to for the sake of distraction.
He only has to wait a few seconds for the little dots to start flickering. Less than a minute later, Cas’s reply comes through.
When Cas recovered enough from the surprise to talk like a human again, he smiled at Dean. “I didn’t realize you shopped here.”
“I think what this morning calls for is a brisk constitutional,” Cas declared, crossing the kitchen and startling Dean when he ended up hovering in his personal space. Cas gave him a fond look, and then cleared away the two mugs Dean had set on the counter, opening a different cupboard and pulling down two large travel mugs instead. He held them up for Dean’s approval. “If we’re lucky, Maricella will have a fresh batch of guava pastries for us by the time we get to the hospital.”
Impala took a minute to type out his response, and Cas found himself yawning while he watched the little dots cycle through their pattern. He glanced at the clock and was shocked to see it was already after eleven. He’d have to save the rest of the story for tomorrow if he didn’t plan on shuffling into school like a zombie in the morning.
deals?” Dean says, pulling out a chair and spinning it around to straddle backward, resting his elbows on the back at a convenient height for tipping beer into his mouth with minimal effort.
with them. Even if it was just a friend, it was just one more reminder for Dean that Cas was out of his league. An attractive librarian who chose to be there when he could’ve just as easily chosen a career as a famous author. He didn’t need Dean at all. Cas already had a life, and was just a kind enough person to keep Dean company while they were at work together. That was it. Whatever strange simpatico Dean had felt between them was nothing more than his imagination working overtime.
do that again,” Dean muttered. “And I really mean it this time. We got no more magical reset buttons, and you are
“This is why we make the most of the time we’re given, to hope the good outweighs the bad, and find happiness where we can,” Cas said softly. “Ten years can change everything.”
“That really sucks. So I guess we’re gonna be dealing with a bunch of pissed off nurses for a while.” It felt almost wrong to even ask, after learning that many of the people he’d worked with were struggling with this news, but Dean did have a personal investment in how this all shook out. “Did Patience happen to know who got stuck working with us?”
“What?” Sam asks, turning in his seat fast enough to make himself wince despite the sling protecting his injured arm. “No, Dean, we’re just meeting up at that Italian place a couple blocks from home. I was gonna walk it. But, uh, it did occur to me that dating in general would be kinda awkward if I showed up on my bike.”
“Not anymore,” Benny says grimly. “Let’s just say that between Gabriel’s list and Billie’s personnel files, we’re well on our way to closing half a dozen cold cases.”
“You feeling all right, Cas?” Dean had asked about halfway through their lunch break. They were sitting in the library office at the big work table eating ham sandwiches and mac and cheese, and Cas realized he hadn’t said anything, nor even looked up from his tray in at least ten minutes. When he glanced up at Dean, he failed to control the panic in his eyes, and Dean held up a placating hand. “You seem kinda preoccupied, is all. I’m just worried about you.”
that awkwardness since he was the fully conscious one in this scenario. At least Cas had the excuse that he’d slept through the entire ordeal.
Dean barely got a chance to see her name tag, but he was pretty sure it was Alex, or maybe Alexis. He swore to himself he’d catch her name the first chance he got. A nurse willing to take no shit from the doctors was the exact sort of person he wanted in his corner when the shit inevitably hit the fan. Maybe he could bribe her with guava pastries. He watched her hustle off behind one of the exam curtains as two more lab coats swaggered in. From the way the nurses parted for them, they surely were the attending physicians on call.
“Yeah, I finally move to the same state as my brother, and I still feel like we’re communicating long distance.”
The tiny park bore more of a resemblance to a glorified traffic circle out in the middle of the prairie than any sort of official state park had a right to. It wasn’t much more than a little triangle cut out along the side of the road at the Y intersection of a couple of dirt roads. It didn’t even have a proper parking lot, so Dean pulled off the main road and drove around to the back side of the park, not quite hidden from the main road and picnic area by a little copse of trees, but not out in obvious plain sight either. He edged Cas’s truck as far off the dirt road as possible and shut off the engine while surveying the territory.
Gabriel is all smiles as he walks up to the bar and orders them each a beer and a burger, tells the bartender to run a tab, and then points at a table in the back corner of the room. Cas takes that as his cue to head in that direction, and Gabriel follows a few moments later after exchanging a few quiet words with the bartender while the man pours their drinks.
“Ah, yes. I’m familiar with maintaining long-distance relationships,” Cas said, frowning. “The internet makes the world seem so small, and at the same time reminds me how impossibly large it is.”
Dean blinked at that and took another step closer, holding his breath as he raised his hand to Cas’s shoulder. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, grounding himself, before opening them and looking right into Cas’s face, searching for something that Cas wished with every fiber of his being he would be able to deliver.
“You guys think you could drop me off by my van?” Ed asked. “I think I’m gonna get back on the road tonight. I can probably make it to Wisconsin by dawn if I start driving now.”
Cas gives him a strange look, but eventually relents. When he nods, Dean warns him, “This might sting a bit.”
“Dr. Winchester, right?” The woman asked, and then followed Dean’s line of sight to where her colleague had Cas pinned up against a crash cart. “Yeah, Daphne’s harmless but a little intense.”
Cas laughed at that and waited patiently for Dean to find the post-it note stuck to one of the documents in his stack with the number written on it.
. And that’s why I made the choice I did. Nothing could ever make me regret choosing to live a single glorious human life with you, Dean.”
“So suddenly you’re the most honest town in America, and it’s looking like you’re gonna be out of a job?” Dean asked, giving her a conspiratorial little smile.
Wulf gave her a sad smile and shook his head. “You haven’t held me against my will. I could’ve left any time I wanted to, but I would not choose to do so while my… my dearest friend… while he was trapped in your stone prison.”
For the first time since they’d met, Dean felt a strange weight of sadness at the mention of long-distance relationships. The melancholy look on Cas’s face as he stared out over Dean’s shoulder made him hesitate. If Cas had some sort of complicated online relationship with someone, he wouldn’t press the issue. At least Dean finally knew where he stood, though. It was a little disappointing to know he had basically zero chance of wooing Cas, but it was probably best to learn that so early on before he’d allowed himself to get invested in the idea. And friendship with Cas was good enough. Dean could do friendship. He wouldn’t let himself screw that up.
“We haven’t really thought that far ahead yet,” Dean told her as Wulf fell in behind Cas. He waved his gun at Lorna, prompting her and her two stunned cameramen to follow after them. “We figured that was Wulf’s decision to make.”
“Dean. I thought I heard you pull up outside, but then you didn’t come inside. I was worried there was something wrong. You’re not injured already, are you?”
He wiped down their table while Dean got up to toss his trash and then made his way toward the door just as the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ cover of Love Rollercoaster began playing over the sound system. Why did that have to be one of the songs he recognized? It took everything in him not to freeze in his tracks and stare at Dean. Cas pushed his way through the door and then pivoted to hold it open for Dean, who bounced his way out onto the sidewalk to the beat of the music. He struggled to come up with anything to say that wouldn’t make him sound like a lunatic. After a panicked few seconds of thought, once the door swung shut and silenced the music, he settled for changing the topic entirely.
Cas laughed at him, and if he hadn’t been holding the ceremonial bowl, looked like he really wanted to give Wulf a high five for his comment. Dean threw Cas a tentative grin, and Cas smiled back at him. Even Lorna noticed the awkward tension between them. It gave her a moment’s distraction while it took her a minute to process what she’d just witnessed. She finally registered that she was so far out of the loop of what was actually going on here, but it did help her to begin formulating better questions.
Dean sat there blinking at the screen. He should’ve been congratulating Feathers on his draft. He should’ve been making an apology for not having time to start reading it tonight. He should’ve been getting himself to sleep because he was already gonna regret the late night when his alarm went off in the morning. Dean couldn’t do any of those things, though, because Feathers had never been on a roller coaster.
“Probably a good choice. I’m gonna make some popcorn and watch a bit of enthralling homemade surgical porn, if you wanna join me in the living room,” Gabriel says, waving a thumb drive that Cas assumes contains the video and records of Mr. Adler’s surgery. “And try the tea. The guy at the shop said it was good for sharpening mental acuity or something like that.”
“We can always pencil in a nice relaxing paddle one weekend,” Cas offered. “There are likely tour venues who rent canoes locally. It might be an interesting way to explore the Everglades, come to think of it.”
Dean shrugged, and the conversation began to fizzle out. “I, uh, think I’m gonna maybe watch another show. You wanna join in?”
“This must be some car,” Dean said, burning with curiosity about what sort of car was special enough for that sort of investment.
Cas winces at the thought of eating custard-filled anything for at least another hour or two, and Gabriel laughs again.
Ed shook his head. “Yeah, but you guys can just make coffee and pancakes at three in the morning if you had a craving. Or something that didn’t come out of a Gas n Sip microwave. It’s… cozy.”
“Not in the least,” Dean replies. “Gotta learn how to run this thing if you ever wanna get anything done around here at all,” he adds, patting the huge computer monitor sitting on the counter. “This ain’t just for show.”
Cas shook his head and smiled sadly at Dean. “No, I told her I’d be fine. That I was just tired and missing our daily routine. Routine is important to emotional well being,” Cas reminded him.
Cas made it through the rest of his stack of new books and set them all on a rolling cart to be shelved tomorrow. He couldn’t face another moment of Amelia Bedelia and the mouse who wanted a cookie staring him in the face, and needed to get out and feel like a grownup again before he’d be ready to talk with Impala. He shut down his computer, turned off the lights and headed out. He didn’t even bother walking past Dean’s office to say goodnight.
: He doesn’t even know my real name, let alone where I work. I won’t be telling him squat. It’s all yours.
“There’s still a chance it’s just a bunch of humans who are really, really good at VFX,” Ed said with a frown. “I mean, it’s statistically improbable for a youtube show with a shoestring budget, but not impossible. For all we know, Wulf could be a trust fund brat with a degree in digital editing who bought himself an impenetrable fake ID just to run some long con of a prank on the world for laughs.”
Cas’s brow furrowed. “It was Heaven’s orders. I never thought to question them. But yes, it has bothered me many times over the years.”
Cas snorted out a laugh and shook his head as he turned and headed toward the elevator at the far side of the lobby. “Only on Thursdays.”
Dean held up both hands in surrender. “Dude, I’m just eager to get my hands on it. I kinda miss having a project car to work on.”
“Is that what the kids are calling it nowadays?” Pamela asks, and then gets right into the business of why she called. “So I’m down at the police station. I got a friend of mine to crack your phone open. Oh, by the way, Dean, Sam wanted me to tell you he’s going to stay at Rowena’s for a while. Give you two some space, since Cas probably won’t be going home tonight.”
He’s already blown his morning routine, so Dean spends the next hour running through the scheduling and billing software, the inventory, and everything else they use in the shop. Claire doesn’t appreciate the impromptu quizzes Dean tries to catch her on, but she manages to answer him every time. By the end of his little orientation session, Claire’s looking a little frazzled and desperate. Dean smirks at her when Donna comes over to give her a hug.
“I’m prepared to try anything, Dean. As tempted as I might be to stay here with you forever, nothing will change unless we choose to go back to our lives.”
“I still have a few things I need to take care of, but maybe I’ll join you on the road when I’m done. No promises, though.”
“Well, yes,” Cas says, his hands nervously clenching and unclenching in his lap, focusing on telling Pamela the facts and not letting Gabriel distract him. “He attempted to intimidate me, but I dismissed him as quickly as I could and went back to work. I’ve been successful at avoiding him since then, but I’m operating under the expectation that he’s only fallen back to regroup and plan a more direct assault.”
“Yes,” Cas replied. “I think I do understand your dilemma. Is that why you’ve attached yourself to Lorna and her associates?”
“I don’t need to know about yours, either,” Sam muttered, and then sighed, slapping his laptop shut and sliding it off the table into his lap. He looked over at Cas. “You good with this one, too? You’ve already been through a lot lately, and this one might be hard to deal with.”
After a quick bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee, he drags himself to the shower and gets himself ready to start his day. It’s only then that he takes a minute to look through some of his long and rambling text conversation with Cas from the night before. They’d talked for hours, until they’d both fallen asleep, and all he can remember of the last few messages they’d exchanged was interwoven with his weird half-asleep half-dreaming thoughts as he drifted off. And then he sees the last message he sent.
Dean had been flipping back and forth between his conversation with Charlie, the main Pinefest author chat channel, and his depressingly quiet direct messages with FicFeathers. It gave him something to do while Charlie was typing, but it wasn’t really doing anything for his anxiety levels since Feathers still wasn’t online. So when he switched back to read Charlie’s message, it hit him like a sack of wet cement. He had a momentary flashback to the incident in the library, and it left him feeling nearly as jittery and unsettled as his first meeting with Cas had. It was a bit of emotional whiplash, and he debated whether or not to mention the sexy librarian to her at all. It wasn’t just the fear she’d immediately begin applying every fanfic trope to their practically nonexistent working relationship, but Charlie knew Feathers, too. It’s not like they had an actual relationship outside of the fandom, but after Dean had built up the potential for maybe breaking through some of Feathers’ walls, it still felt almost like cheating to bring up the guy at school he’d only known for a day.
If Dean knew what was going on between them, or even between him and Cas, he’d gladly tell Charlie without her having to wait until he was tipsy and distracted to pounce on him with an interrogation. Things had been going great on both fronts, actually. Not that he’d told Cas the whole truth about his fandom life, nor Feathers about his real life, but he’d definitely made inroads with both of them. And the feeling that he was still cheating on both of them had only grown stronger over the last week or two.
Dean put on his best John Wayne voice and tipped an imaginary hat. “Is this an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?”
“Long as you promise not to hurl rotten tomatoes at me, you got a deal,” Dean said, backing toward the door.
“Don’t drink so much that you pass out before we get this resolved,” Cas warned him as he squeezed the open bottle between the sofa cushions for safekeeping.
Dean understood what Cas was trying to tell him. He’d laid himself bare over the course of the last week, about his past and his present and what he hoped for his future. If that hadn’t been enough to turn Cas away, then he felt he was already on pretty solid ground. After all, Cas had been just as open with him. Dean wasn’t sure he’d ever known anyone as well as he thought he knew Cas at that point.
He had to clear his throat so his voice wouldn’t come out as broken as he felt, but he thought he managed it pretty well under the circumstances.
Dean looked at his watch and scoffed. “It’s not even nine o’clock, Cas. It’s hardly bedtime yet. Plus I still gotta shower. Our schedule already got thrown off tonight.”
Cas stood and stared at Jack, overwhelmed with emotion. Pride and happiness and relief gave way to shock in the moment he realized he could truly choose his own path forward in Jack’s liberated world. There was no burden of duty to consider, only choice.
With a nod, Jack replied. “As soon as you’re ready, yes.” Kelly looked ready and eager for the new adventure, but Jack had one last point of order to handle first. “There’s just one more thing. I am the reason both of you are here in the first place. You both lost your lives because of me, because you loved me and wanted to help me. So before I remake Heaven, I want to give you both a choice you were never given before. It’s only fair.”
“Not just dating,” Charlie replied in a grim tone. “This is apparently a kind of sport for these people.”
Dean shrugged. “Been doing it my whole life, I guess. Finding loopholes to slip through. And just so you know, I think you’re being officially collected into the family here, since you basically got my whole life story now.”
Cas couldn’t deny it any longer. He was very likely hopelessly in love with Impala, and that was the only thing holding him back from inviting Dean into his life more fully. For every heart-stopping smile that Dean gave him, for every instance that Dean made him laugh, or showed him care, or prodded him to share more about himself, Cas always knew that giving in and fully opening up to Dean would mean losing Impala. He knew it was selfish of him, but he also knew he couldn’t keep both of them. It wasn’t fair to any of them, himself included, to keep holding them both at arm’s length. The only thing worse than that would be having to choose between them. If things continued like they were currently going, it was likely he’d lose both of them.
Cas frowned at the phone on the table between them and then up at Dean. “Are you sure you’re okay to drive, Sam?”
Dean looked around, hoping for some sort of sign, or an answer to his question. When he got none, he yelled out at the sky through the windshield. “I thought we were done with this bullshit, Jack. What happened to
Sam gives him a grim but firm look. “Pamela talked with Billie, and as far as she knows, Nick shouldn’t have access to that system. It’s only used in emergencies, and the hospital’s IT manager insists it hasn’t been activated today. She thinks it was a bluff on his part, but we’re going under the assumption that he’s a threat either way.”
He kisses the bit of Cas’s neck he can reach with Cas octopussed around him, and then finally manages to get him moving toward the bedroom. Luckily he has a spare toothbrush for Cas, and after another careful application of ointment and his professional assessment that Cas’s tattoo is healing beautifully, they strip down at Cas’s insistence and climb into bed. Dean falls asleep feeling happy and at peace for maybe the first time in his entire life, holding Cas and being held in turn. He has a fucking fantastic night’s sleep.
, Cas muttered to himself for what could’ve been the billionth time. Every time he fought his way to the surface, pushed aside the sludge the Empty was determined to bury him with. He had no idea how long he’d been there. It could’ve been minutes or eons, because it was just one long loop of torment, over and over again.
Cas huffs out a laugh. “I believe I owe your friend Shorty some sort of thank you gift. He’s an excellent packer.”
“You need to hold it close to your face, relax your eyes, and slowly move it away until the image resolves,” a deep and rumbling, and highly amused voice said almost directly behind him.
Cas is equally concerned, wondering if Sam somehow knew what would happen between them. He doesn’t think they were
When Cas had discovered the little succulent plant Gabriel had given him was called a Hen and Chicks, Dean began referring to it as Hennifer, and the name had, for better or worse, stuck. But for the past few months, Hennifer has lived in Dean’s kitchen window in a place of honor above the sink. But they had both gone back for one last lesson in the spacious and relaxing bathroom. Dean had appreciated the water pressure, and since Cas was once again between tattoos, they were able to take full advantage of the hot water.
“You’ve already hurt a lot of people,” Sam countered. “And yes, what you trapped in those stones are human souls. They are definitely people. So we’re gonna ask one more time. How many are there?”
He’s all curled in on himself in pain, but Sam does manage to remain standing without Dean’s support and shuffles off toward the automatic doors. Dr. Novak shoots Dean an apologetic look, and then turns to give Sam his full attention.
He’d had some pretty shitty roommates since he’d left home, but he’d also had at least one falling out with someone who’d declared him impossible to live with, too. Sure he was picky about his personal space, but like every frazzled med student he’d had a few meltdowns along the way that hadn’t exactly endeared him to his roommates, either. Dean frowned at his reflection in the mirror and swore to himself he’d never let things get that bad with Cas. The guy seemed chill enough so far that hopefully he’d never feel the need to. Dean’s stomach twisted angrily at the thought, and he second-guessed his choice to down that entire coffee. Except that feeling had absolutely nothing to do with the sugary drink now coursing through his veins.
“I’m a reaper,” Wulf replied. “I was bound to one of the souls you so ignorantly collected, and in trapping him, you inadvertently trapped me, as well.”
Dean went willingly into Cas’s embrace, letting Cas take his weight as he melted into a kiss. Cas tried to pull him closer still, digging fingertips into the skin of his back as their kiss grew more heated. Cas instinctively rocked his hips, seeking out the perfect friction they’d had before, and Dean adjusted them so their cocks were aligned before driving his hips against Cas’s.
Cas stands there reading and rereading the message, letting it sink in completely. It’s definitely threatening, without outright saying he’s willing to lie to intentionally damage Cas’s reputation. Or Gabriel’s, for that matter, as the only other doctor in the room for his botched surgery. Cas is momentarily torn between throwing his phone across the room or throwing up. He’s not sure either would be particularly useful. When he’s recovered his wits, he shoots off a quick message to Gabriel and Pamela, letting them both know that Nick is trying to contact him, and asking what he should do. He takes screenshots of Nick’s message and adds them to the group chat, and then sets his phone face down on the foot of the bed and sits down to await further instructions. Unfortunately, it’s Nick who replies first.
This was definitely the worst possible outcome that he’d been dreading yesterday. He didn’t come to Miami with big designs on a high flying social life, but this felt like being entirely cut adrift. The one person he’d truly connected with in
Dean blinked at him for a moment, and then shrugged. “I saw a nursery out by the Amish place this morning. We could check it out.”
Cas’s mouth hung open as he blinked at Dean for a minute. He nodded slowly as that sunk in and Dean’s anger melted into a frown.
Cas only realizes it now that the conversation has ceased, that Dean’s been running his hand up and down his arm. It feels pleasant, soothing, and Cas lets himself enjoy it, closing his eyes and resting his head against Dean’s shoulder. He feels Dean’s chest rise and fall with a long, slow breath.
Cas pulled up to their usual coffee shop, at their usual time. Surprisingly, he’d slept better than he had in weeks. Something about the promise of being fully known, fully understood and accepted by someone he could sit at a table with and breathe the same air as had settled him in unexpected ways. The excitement of spending time with Dean, of knowing in his heart that he could truly connect to another human being face to face; could connect to Dean in ways that he’d only ever felt toward Impala, without any hope that Impala ever would’ve reciprocated any of his feelings. With Dean, he had a chance, at least.
Dean nearly laughed himself off the sofa, but couldn’t argue with Cas’s assessment of the entire legal profession. His laughing fit tapered off into a pleasantly exhausted yawn, and Dean stretched contentedly and rubbed his eyes. Before the stars had dissipated from his vision, Cas was on his feet, and their relaxing evening had drawn to a close.
“Yeah, it is, but you still gotta learn the basics of running a business here. Take accounting, take business management, take fucking art history if you want. But until you’re experienced enough to get hired in someone else’s shop, you gotta be an apprentice. And I say general education is part of the program. Take it or leave it.”
Regardless, it felt like a calling, and everyone in the group chat had agreed. They composed a list of objectives for the weekend, and set the wheels of their grand plan in motion.
“We do what we always do,” Dean replied vaguely, and then went back to finishing his breakfast in earnest.
If he was lucky, he could sneak in a few hours editing the rest of his own fic before Feathers even got home from work, and then spend the rest of the night reading and trading comments with Feathers.
Meanwhile, in the back seat Cas was having a nearly identical dilemma to Dean’s. He had a hell of a lot more at stake, though. If he were to blurt out something untoward, depending on how poorly Dean received it, the result could range from a long period of intense awkwardness where neither of them would want to see one another, to the extreme case where Dean would feel so uncomfortable that he would ask Cas to leave the bunker permanently. It had been an increasingly terrifying thought, and the more he considered it the more it seemed like a genuine possibility.
“We let you in the front door, Ed,” Sam replied quietly. “Most people don’t even get the address. So tell us why you’ve got such a bad feeling about this guy.”
“Well, what I want right now is to get back to playing with my new toy here,” the Entity said, waving a gooey hand toward Cas, who was now glaring at it as if more offended that it was trying to impersonate Jack than at the idea of his own torture resuming.
Dean reads it all over several times, catching his breath. He’d been afraid Cas wouldn’t like it, worrying throughout the day when he hadn’t responded yet. When he checks the timestamp on the first text and sees it’s from a little less than an hour ago, be breathes out a sigh of relief and hopes Cas is still up.
Both Dean and Sam’s eyes go wide at that, and they both stare at Gabriel as he stands there grinning like he’s just itching to tell the story. Cas continues glaring at him, until Gabriel finally rolls his eyes at all of them.
He slowly got to his knees, stopping only to give Cas a kiss on the lips before they helped each other up and out of the tub. Cas bent over to pull the stopper out and let the last of the bespelled water drain away.
Cas heaved a sigh and smiled in return. “No, you’re fine. Making coffee is now one less thing I have to think about this morning.”
And hell if that wasn’t enough to keep Dean going through that entire morning. It hit him in the produce department that it should probably be weird that he was content knowing Cas was tucked up safe and cozy in bed at home. While picking out cereal he was struck by the fact he made his choices based on what Cas had said he liked the most. He’d never even done that for people he was actively in a relationship with before, let alone a roommate he had a friendship spanning just a few weeks with. By the time he made it to the dairy section, picking up the yogurt Cas favored as a late night snack, he had come to terms with the fact that he was full on in love with Cas.
He could see how the entire story would be presented, piecing together all of the facts. Charlie had assured him that the editor had sworn to her that none of the blowback would fall out on the innocent staff who’d already had to endure far too much drama in their personal lives. The editor she’d chosen to talk to had a long resume of exposing abuses of power and defending worker’s rights, and if Charlie trusted him to expose the few people who’d grossly abused their power without dragging the entire hospital through the mud with them, then Dean didn’t really have an option but to trust the guy, too.
Cas blinked at that and then surged forward to kiss him again. “You’re genuinely worried, aren’t you?”
Cas broke the surface of the water and held out his hand for the shampoo bottle, but Dean just sat and blinked at the sight of him, dripping wet and staring him down.
“I don’t know that I’d have been able to keep both feet on the ground or if I would’ve floated away completely. For the first time in my life, I actually feel connected. I spend my days surrounded by people who need to be saved, and I’m able to heal them and make them whole. It’s fulfilling, yes, but to feel like there might be a place where I belong just for myself, and not for what I can do for people? Now
“You can take it off to shower, or if you’re sitting quietly doing your school work, but if you’re up and moving around, you should keep it on just as a precaution, for at least a few weeks. You can also take ibuprofen for any pain you’re experiencing.” He pulls several sample packets of the pain reliever out of a drawer and hands them to Sam, who rips one open and dry swallows it on the spot.
Dean sighed and muttered, “Yeah, yeah, we’ve had worse. At least the plumbing works.” He flipped on the kitchen tap, and was relieved when cool, clean water sprayed into the sink. “Where’s the bathroom?”
Dean sighed. He knew he wouldn’t be able to avoid her questions. She’d been the one he’d turned to for advice weeks ago, but he’d been dodging every attempt she’d made to follow up on how things were going. There was a good chance she’d pry every last detail out of him, especially if he let his guard down and drank too much. That would be all too easy to do on a brewery tour.
“I think it’s probably safe to use. I mean, we’re gonna light it on fire anyway.” Sam added with a smirk, “I can salt and exorcise it too, if you think it’s necessary.”
It was with the same impetuousness he’d made a similar offer to Impala the previous day, but couldn’t stop himself from making again. Even if he didn’t really expect Dean to hand over his notebooks to a veritable stranger, he felt compelled to offer Dean even a tiny fraction of what his time in fandom had given him.
When the little dots begin to flicker indicating Dean’s typing a reply, Cas feels the equivalent flickering in his stomach and wonders if he shouldn’t get himself a cup of soothing tea. He side-eyes the bottle of whiskey sitting on his dresser, but Dean’s reply comes through before he can act on that impulse.
: Yeah, well, he must be pretty fucking hard up for reading material. Either that or he needs a good laugh.
“God, I want that too, Cas. I want it. You,” Dean said, and he knew he couldn’t last much longer. It was all too much, and he was already straining to hold himself back. He’d already given every other piece of himself to Cas, and he was racing toward the edge of a cliff to throw him that final bit. “Kiss me, please.”
Cas smiled, relieved, and handed the mug to Dean. “I added a bit of hazelnut creamer to it. I find it improves the staff room coffee.”
“At first I was angry at myself for turning you down. You’d obviously planned that outing far enough in advance to already have purchased tickets, and were left with having to find someone else to go with you. But then I realized what that meant. If you knew Charlie, then you knew about her hobbies. And at the very least, you wouldn’t look down on people who shared her hobbies. One hobby in particular.”
“I wasn’t exactly writing you steamy erotica, Cas,” Dean replied, resting his forehead against Cas’s and holding him back just as tightly.
“Eye of the beholder, Cas. So, uh, I’ll see you in the morning then,” Dean said lamely, rubbing the back of his neck. Any other night and he would’ve asked Cas out for dinner, or stood and chatted for a few more minutes at the very least. He didn’t want to keep Feathers waiting, though, and Cas also seemed awkwardly eager to be somewhere else. Dean tried not to take it personally. They’d only known each other for two days, and Dean decided right there that he never wanted Cas to look that uncomfortable around him. Dean would do his best to never give him a reason to.
Cas snorted, pausing for an ambulance to drive by before crossing the road toward the residents apartment complex. The building was mercifully only a short walk away, tucked into a relatively quiet corner of the hospital campus on the other side of a small park. Dean already knew the route, since he’d parked in his assigned space in the lot before sprinting to the hospital’s HR office to pick up his official documents and ID that morning. Now all he had to do was figure out where exactly he would be living for the next four years, and hope that his new roommate wasn’t an obnoxious dick. He pulled his keys out of his pocket as they approached the parking lot and Cas followed him curiously toward the Impala.
“We already ganked Veritas, so what could get a whole town to decide that honesty was the best policy like this?”
“That’s a good attitude for a resident to adopt,” one of the nurses said with a grin as she rushed past with a patient chart in hand. “Stick with that theory and the nurses will love you.”
He shuddered at the memory and finally dragged himself out of bed. He wasn’t yet sure if this was gonna be a coffee kind of morning or a beer in his wheaties kind of morning. That would all depend on Cas, he supposed as he got dressed and headed to the kitchen.
“A, it was years ago, Cas. When the Leviathan were everywhere and we thought you were dead. And second, everybody lies at pick up joints like that. It’s expected. And the fuck? It’s not like I was trying to knock her up! She tricked me! It’s what Amazons
They spend the next hour or so working out every detail from the most mundane day to day living arrangements to the intricacies of Gabriel’s plan to discredit Nick. Cas insists on signing a formal lease with Gabriel, and Gabriel decides to charge him half what Nick did as long as Cas agrees to spend the rest on a decent car for himself. Cas tries to object, saying he doesn’t need a car, but Gabriel glares at him until he relents and agrees to become a motorist by the end of the weekend.
Dean gave him a conspiratorial little nod, and then grinned. “Who am I to stand in the way of tradition?”
Sam nodded in agreement, but Cas raised an eyebrow at Dean and went on as if he hadn’t been interrupted. “A nephilim, and an untold number of the fae.”
“So, let me get this straight,” Cas asked as he unlocked the door to their building, turning and blocking the way once he had the door open so he could study Dean properly while he asked. “You’d be fine having a stranger live in your closet, but not if they used your bathroom?”
“You four. It was always on the schedule for you to take alternating shifts, but you lot had to go and be the most competent and qualified quartet of residents we’ve ever had come through here.”
“So really, it’s your choice if you wanna stay,” Dean added quietly, wobbling his glass in his hand and watching the liquid slosh from side to side.
Dean picked up his bag yet again, this time without letting go of Cas. He was about to guide them down the stairs into the bunker, but stopped just long enough to call out over his shoulder, “And maybe don’t let anyone disturb us until at least tomorrow afternoon. I don’t care if the entire planet is on fire, just give us until noon, at least.”
“Yeah I can see myself spending my time off staring longingly back at the building where I spend the other half of my life.” Dean considered it for a moment and then shrugged. “We should probably get some patio furniture, I guess.”
“You’re gonna be seeing him practically every day, and he already practically knows your whole life story. You seem to really like him, and you’ve already technically been on at least one date with the guy even if neither of you has stuck that label on it yet.”
“Honestly, Cas? I don’t even care. Look at this place,” he said, clicking over to the photo gallery attached to the article and scrolling through grainy images of hazy shapes floating in the murky water. It wasn’t the supposed monster that had caught his attention, though. “If you wanna get out of the bunker for a few days, this ain’t a half bad place to spend it.”
Dean drove the rest of the way home with extreme care and an excess of caution. He hadn’t even made it two blocks before his phone dinged from where he’d tossed it in the back seat. Considering the weird power surge, he was grateful the thing hadn’t shorted out, but also grudgingly concerned that even miles away at Eileen’s place that Sam had felt the surge as well. He made a pained noise, and pulled over to the side of the road to fish out his phone and make sure the world wasn’t about to end again. It was still better than getting home and having to face an empty bunker, he told himself. When he finally snagged the phone and got himself settled behind the wheel again, there was a single message from Sam.
“Morning, sunshine,” Dean says, grinning at him like he’s personally responsible for making the sun rise.
Cas gave a little shrug. “If you had, I likely wouldn’t have been dreaming about you. Your letters made me… they made me care about you, Dean, and it grew from there.”
“I’m gonna consider this your punishment for nearly burning down my kitchen this morning with your hippie toast,” Dean says as he pulls into his parking spot behind the shop and shuts off the engine.
“You didn’t have to do that, you know,” Dean told him as he scooted up with Cas in his arms to turn on the tap and run more hot water into the tub. “You’re freezing now. We gotta warm you back up.”
“I’ll do that, Dean. And by the way, it’s Cas.” Dean blinks at him for a second, and Cas clarifies. “My name. It’s Cas. Short for Castiel.”
“We’re gonna have to leave her an extra tip tomorrow,” Cas said when he discovered the cookies as they pushed through the doors to the emergency department.
He looked down at the table, unable to hold Sam’s gawping stare any longer. Sam almost laughed at that, after watching him and Dean perfect their weird staring contests over the years.
Wulf shook his head. “I’m a reaper. I’ve been unable to contact Billie for assistance, and I don’t even know that she could help me out of this mess. She gave me permission for… for a leave of absence for a time, and in doing so I surrendered much of my power.”
I wouldn’t eat spiders. I am not an outlier and I very much should be counted. I’d just find a cave within Postmates delivery range. Not everyone can watch four episodes in three hours while also typing nonstop and end up with anything even remotely coherent.
Dean laughs at that and kisses him again, and Cas gives back everything Dean gives to him. After a few minutes, things are once again reaching a point of desperation, hands clawing at clothing as Dean stumblingly leads them toward the stairs without breaking their kiss. They’ve almost made it to the back door, and they’re so distracted they almost don’t hear Dean’s phone ringing in his pocket.
“It’s brutal out there. Even the ducks seemed to think it’s too wet outside,” she said as she wedged her huge golf umbrella in her locker. At least it had kept her dry, Dean thought.  “They were all huddled together under the big live oak.”
“It doesn’t look much like any version of Miami I’ve seen on tv,” Dean commented while they were stopped at a traffic light, surrounded by suburbia. “It’s mostly just another flat place. But with palm trees.”
Cas shrugged and smiled back at him. “For me, it was the key to any sort of orgasm at all, so I’ll have to take your word on that.”
“Sadly, not as far as I can tell,” Charlie replied. “Well, blackmail is definitely a hundred percent illegal, but none of the men they’ve extorted are actually alive to press charges, and it would’ve been a he said she said sort of situation anyway.”
: Hey, Feathers. I’m home, but I’m waiting to get the official go ahead from you to start reading. I’m ready when you are.
Dean shuddered. “Yeah, hopefully it won’t come to that, for Wulf’s sake. And there’s still the matter of what to do about Lorna. It doesn’t sound like she’s gonna quit her little hobby, and with Wulf gone off to Heaven or wherever, it’s not like we can keep tabs on her forever.”
He slumps down on the bed beside the box and kicks off his shoes. It takes a full minute for him to work up the nerve to lift the lid. If it’s a bunch of legal paperwork and documentation, he’s not sure he can make sense of it in his current state of mind anyway, but he’s got to at least try. Gabriel’s done so much for him already, it would be pointless to put off dealing with it. With a sigh of resignation, he opens the box, and he’s pleasantly surprised when he doesn’t recognize a single thing inside. Intrigued and rejuvenated by this unexpected discovery, he stands up and shrugs off his coat, tossing it on the bed before digging into the contents.
Cas gave him a hesitant smile, almost as if he was embarrassed by how much he’d revealed of himself to Dean. And then seemed to register what Dean had inadvertently let slip out. “A few weeks?”
“Dr. Morningstar has made quite the name for himself over the years,” Billie says. “He’s always known how to manipulate any situation to his own advantage. He’s been indirectly involved in several malpractice cases, but he’s always managed to exonerate himself at another doctor’s expense. We’ve known about his little hobby for a while now, but we’ve never had any proof that he was behind it all. In fact, I’m pretty damn impressed at what the four of you have managed to uncover in just a matter of days.” She looks around the table at each of them, as if wondering what it might take to recruit them all to her unofficial spy network.
Most of what remained in boxes there were personal items he hadn’t gotten around to sorting through and finding homes for in his new room yet. Those things always took time. He turned on the light in the closet and looked at the sad little pile of things, frowning at the big bin of posters shoved hastily in the corner. As tempting as it was to unroll a few and maybe even make a preliminary venture out to a local framing shop to see his options, Dean knew he didn’t necessarily have that kind of time. With his luck, he’d be stuck in traffic halfway there when the hospital called him back to work. No, the framing adventure would have to wait for another day.
The women at the tea shop chatted about the weather and the new varieties they’d blended for the fall season. He stopped at the record shop to look into listening to more of Led Zeppelin’s music and bought two of their albums that featured a number of tracks referenced in Unnatural. At the very least, he felt he needed to familiarize himself with those. The fact that Impala had been educating him about their music for years and then Dean had teased him for not recognizing one of their songs when it came on in the restaurant was something Cas couldn’t really deny had contributed to his sudden need to hear more after dragging his feet for so long.
Cas looked him straight in the eye, face set in stony seriousness. “It’s a 1978 Lincoln Continental. Gold.”
Dean snorted. “Should I be worried about a reporter being so easily convinced to hand over the name of a confidential source?”
“Yeah, I might’ve been overtipping her for the last week to make sure she saved you a guava pastry every night.”
“Not exactly,” Ed replied. “They always had a taste for the bizarre. They did a lot of shoots from graveyards, with Lorna holding seances trying to raise the dead. Or from abandoned places where they all just went exploring looking for anything spooky. They went down to New Orleans last October for Halloween and dedicated an entire hour to looking for vampires in voodoo shops and the back alleys of the French Quarter.”
Dean smiled at the genuine warmth in Cas’s voice. They made quick work of the shelving, commenting on some of the new books as they went. It didn’t take long for Dean’s mouth to run out ahead of his brain again.
Cas understood completely. It was ironically similar to his own approach to writing. Not that he’d ever share the details of that with Dean, or with any coworker for that matter. He’d found such a liberating joy in writing for himself, for fandom, that he wasn’t sure he could go back to trying to write for a specific market again. He didn’t want to have to factor in market saturation or commercial viability when he sat down to create fictional worlds. And he’d found an eager audience in a thriving and productive fandom. That was more than good enough for him.
Gabriel finally smiles, but it looks anything but happy. “It’s worse than that, kiddo. Come on. Let’s get out of here.”
Sam slowly lowers himself to sit on the edge of the bed with a relieved sigh and begins trying to shrug out of his coat. He gets his good arm free, but his entire body tenses up when he tries to raise his left arm to slide it out of his sleeve. Cas lays a hand on his arm to stop him, and then gently helps him free his injured arm, tossing the sodden coat onto a chair. To his surprise, Sam manages to raise his legs and twist around, cradling his sore shoulder and hissing through his teeth as he lays back against the pillow.
Cas gave him an amused look as he thanked him. At least he was nice enough not to reject the offer out of hand. “Thank you, Dean. I do appreciate that. I hope you know the same goes for you. It’s rare enough to find someone I feel so at ease around, let alone someone whose company I genuinely enjoy. I might eventually take you up on that offer.”
Cas hesitates just a moment longer, and Dean watches the same anxious tension wash over his face. He takes a deep breath and spreads his fingers out to rest his fingertips against the marks on Dean’s skin. His hand feels almost too warm against his skin, almost as if he’s searing the impression of his hand in like a burn. They both stare down at Dean’s shoulder, equally baffled at how perfectly they line up.
“Rein in those expectations,” he muttered to himself as the light turned green and his thoughts grew grimmer.
Donna shrugged. “They have money and local political clout. They’re the usual sort of hoity toity family that’s good for gossip rag fodder.”
“You’re not thinking about making a reality show about hunters, are you?” Dean asked with a hand on the doorknob, waiting for Ed’s answer.
“So Lydia’s loaded? Why is she spending her days ass deep in trauma patients and agony? Why not live it up with her trust fund in high society with her mother? Sure as shit ain’t out of the goodness of that woman’s heart.”
“Something about today’s hunt has been bothering you all night,” Cas said, sitting down across from Dean. He didn’t need to say anything else. He just sat back and waited Dean out. His tactic paid off eventually.
“That’s the general idea, yes,” Crowley confirmed. “I’m not available for griping, either. I’ll have you know I argued on your behalf, at least partly for my own selfish reasons, but most of the attendings are dissatisfied with the new arrangement, as well.”
Sam gave her an awkward little wave as Dean nearly had to drag him out of there, thanking Chief Deedee as they left. Sam practically floated across the parking lot to the Impala while Dean stomped off ahead with Cas. By the time he’d started the car, Sam had finally wafted over. He’d barely gotten the door shut before Dean rounded on him.
“One more thing,” Sam said, as Dean was about to get out of the car again. “Why didn’t you say anything sooner?”
Dean topped off his and Cas’s coffee, then held the pot up for Sam and Ed who both declined a warm up, and then sat down and tucked into the food.
“So Dean’s on faerie spotting duty,” Sam reminded him, counting off their respective tasks on his fingers. “I’ll handle the witnesses with Jack, and Cas will keep an eye on all of us.”
“Rowena said it’ll wear off in a day or two,” Sam replied before Dean could say anything else. “Maybe faster if I put some physical distance between me and the place where I broke the curse. So I’m heading home. It just hurts to be around too many people right now.”
He pats her on the shoulder and pulls out the tall chair behind the counter for her to take a seat, and then strolls back to the break room to start preparing for his day. His whole schedule might be fucked up anyway for a while, but he feels pretty good about it. Sam’s gonna be fine, Claire’s gonna be fine, his shop’s gonna be fine. Then he sits down at his desk and pulls out his sketchbook, opens it up to the drawing of that pesky angel in a lab coat and stares at it until his first client shows up.
“I mean if you honestly like her, you can give her a call after we take care of whatever’s fucking with people around here. Then you can tell her whatever you want, but at least it’ll be of your own free will, and hers.”
Dean looked down at the sad remnants of his cafeteria sandwich and then shoved it in his mouth. “We gotta stop talking about food when we gotta get back to work.”
Dean darted his eyes up to meet Cas’s, and noticed the flush of his cheeks. It was both endearing and comforting to know that Cas was feeling just as flustered and awkward as he was. He’d been about to say something else when Cas suddenly reached out and put his glass down on the table while standing up. For a split second Dean panicked, thinking he’d given away something that frightened Cas off.
Louis stared at him, hesitated for just a second, and then dove in for a kiss. It was brief, but joyous, and ended with the two of them standing together, foreheads touching, and a look of utter contentment on both their faces.
“Oh, uh, well that sounds convenient,” Ed said. “So you guys are in Lebanon? Would you maybe want to meet up and I can show you what I have in person? I’m staying at a campground a few miles outside of town.”
Cas took a moment in the quiet stairwell to look him up and down consideringly, before finally looking back up at him with a little shrug. “If you say so.” He pushed his way through the door and led the way toward the walking path around the park. “I keep expecting it to be colder outside.”
Dean must’ve still been a bit loopy from his late night thoughts, the restful sleep, and what he could recall of the dream he’d been having. He never would’ve blurted it out around a yawn otherwise, but that’s exactly what he did.
Feathers, on the other hand, was still mostly a mystery. They talked about the show, their writing, and the fandom, but any time their conversations veered toward work or their personal lives beyond a movie they saw or what they had for lunch, Feathers had shut it down and changed the subject. It hardly even seemed to matter anymore, this complete blank spot of the nitty gritty details of their lives. Dean felt he knew Feathers better than some people he’d known his entire life, just from his writing. Anyone who could produce such insightful commentary and analysis of the deeper themes of the show, as well as some of the steamiest smut and most heartfelt romance between the main characters, not to mention his offbeat and often quietly hilarious sense of humor, well… Dean knew the author was someone he needed in his life, in whatever way Feathers would allow him in.
tried to get those two idiots to just talk to each other, but if he was picking up that much frustration and agony, there was no way things had gone well.
As he got ready for bed, Cas’s idle thoughts about the entire day swirled together. He shut off his light and drifted off to a strange vision of Dean in a cowboy hat atop a horse, galloping in and rearing up the way Neal did in Impala’s story.
The chief nodded. “Yeah, but it had its down side, too. We had one guy come in to confess to public indecency. He and his buddies streaked around town the night they graduated high school. He insisted on accepting his punishment, but the statute of limitations ran out more than fifty years ago. He’s in his eighties now, and practically begged us to throw him in jail for his crime.” She shook her head. “We let him stay the night in the holding cell, and that seemed to satisfy him.”
Cas blinks at that for a moment, not knowing what to do with this information and feeling a resurgence of wonder at the sort of people Dean has gleefully surrounded himself with. It’s like this entire new world has opened up and invited him in, welcoming him with warm, if borderline felonious, arms outstretched. He realizes he’s mindlessly staring at Dean, and remembers he’s got questions he feels really need answers. He clears his throat.
“Glad you remember that lesson,” Dean said, grinning up at him as Cas slowly lowered his head to Dean’s shoulder and snuggled in. “But for the record, I’m not opposed to the kissing.”
Dean shakes his head and pulls Cas by the hand, leading him up the stairs. “Sorry to disappoint, but I’ve been mostly dead all day.”
“What, it usually takes at least two dinners to adopt new family members?” Cas waved a hand over their containers of leftovers and stood up to clear the table.
A gentle knock on his door startled him out of his reverie, and only then did he realize he’d just been sitting with his phone in his lap, staring vacantly at his computer monitor like an idiot.
Cas glances over Dean’s shoulder to the woman he’d been tattooing before he barged in. She’s splitting her attention between admiring her new half-finished artwork and surreptitiously keeping an eye the two of them standing across the room. He drags his attention back to Dean’s face and drops his voice nearly to a whisper.
“What the hell…” she started, seeing the guns first and not really registering the people wielding them yet. “I have a permit to be here! This is a legitimate and official production!”
Dean chuckled at Cas’s confidential tone. “Less traumatic to volunteer in the library, or to write the speech?”
She smiled approvingly and left him to his work. There wasn’t really enough work for him to do if he intended to stretch this out for the rest of the day, and he almost regretted not bringing his laptop with him. He might not want to read Feathers’ fic at school where he could be interrupted at any time, but he certainly wouldn’t have minded a few more hours to edit his own story before Feathers would inevitably begin reading it. Not that his fic was particularly safe for work, but at least he already knew it backward and forward. Reading and editing it was a mechanical act at that point, entirely unlike the experience of reading a Feathers fic for the first time. He wanted to be able to fully enjoy that without having to control his reactions and maintain a professional demeanor.
Dean just nodded absently, relieved as fuck that she could finally have as much of a shot at a decent, normal life as she ever wanted, but that only brought back his own sense of loss that he still couldn’t face. He decided to approach it from a different angle, easing himself into having his heart broken again.
“I, uh, hope your conversation with Dean wasn’t too uncomfortable,” Cas began hesitantly. “It must be difficult for both of you, this loss of privacy.”
Eyes widening, Cas nodded and returned to the sofa to open his laptop again. “It seems I’ve won the roommate lottery, then. But a full assessment of your culinary ability can wait for another day. Would you prefer to go out to eat, or have something delivered?”
“Well, we can’t have you passing out from starvation,” Dean replied with a little salute as he opened his car door. “Pencil me in, then. Barring any sort of student-related emergency, consider it a standing date.”
Cas lets Gabriel’s words sink in. He’s knows it’s all true. The bartender brings over their food and a second round of drinks. It gives them a few minutes to eat in silence, chewing over their options and thinking about where they need to go from here.
It was Cas’s turn to blink, long and slow as Dean’s comment fully registered with him. For a second Dean was terrified that he’d really stuck his foot in it. Sure they’d known each other for most of a week now, and had settled into what Dean at least felt was a comfortable friendship. He hadn’t seen or heard Cas make any homophobic comments in that time, but neither of them had really opened up about their dating histories or interests, other than being a united front in fending off advances from the rest of their coworkers. But he still didn’t
“No, Dean, I’m telling you when you don’t impose limitations on yourself, you do just fine talking to people. And you’re one of the best judges of character I’ve ever met. I think you know this Cas dude is good for you. You already spilled the beans on the general subject matter you write, and he still seems interested in talking to you enough that you have a standing lunch date--”
Ed didn’t reply right away, so Dean spoke again. “Yeah, that’s Cas. You’re on speaker, and Sam’s here too.”
: Wait so you were in the same building with the cast and you didn’t even have a ticket into the room? I think I might’ve died.
“You’re right. We should still give them a call and see what they’re all doing next weekend. Maybe we can have them come here for a visit for a change.”
He was just standing up to stretch the kinks out of his back and admire his handiwork when a knock at his door interrupted him for the second time that afternoon. Cas stood in the doorway, holding Dean’s coffee mug and wearing a contrite expression. He held up the mug, as if he’d needed an excuse to interrupt Dean’s stretching.
“Gah! I thought we talked about this sneaking thing,” Dean said as the books thunked down on the metal shelf. His heart was mostly thudding in shock, and not because he’d been gifted the vision of Cas’s ass from an optimal viewing angle.
“Yeah, but you don’t have to listen to everything I say. And banged up ritual candles shouldn’t be romantic. I think one of ‘em’s got a bloodstain on it.”
“Can you stand on your own, or should I see if they got a dolly I can strap you to like Hannibal Lecter?”
Sam and Dean tossed the football back and forth, taunting each other as they overthrew each other, and joking about not wanting to run or jump to catch the ball so soon after eating. Cas stayed just out of range, observing but not yet joining in the game. Every once in a while he’d glance over at Ed as he circled the perimeter of the park. When Ed gave him a thumbs up, Cas would plant another microphone-- one in a low branch of a tree, one hidden in the grass at the foundation of the little chapel, and another in the copse of trees concealing their truck. As best as they could tell, they had the entire park wired for sound. Unless their marks could communicate telepathically, they should be covered. When everything was set up, Ed carefully set the recorder down and meandered over to where Cas was now fully absorbed in watching Sam and Dean’s game.
Dean grins at him. “Well, I’ll be in the shop until at least eight tomorrow night, but if we’re closed, just come around and ring the bell by the back door. I’m almost always home.”
Dean closed his eyes and let his head drop back against the headrest, letting that bit of information sink in. He glanced back over at Cas, who now looked eager for all the details. Dean pointed at his phone, held his finger up to his mouth, and then pushed the button for speakerphone so Cas could hear too.
Billie side-eyed him. “You’re, what, going to run off and create another universe to meddle with? Leave this one alone?”
He lifted the sheets carefully to disturb Dean as little as possible and slid under them. It was inevitable that he’d jostle the mattress getting settled, but he concentrated on being as unobtrusive as he could. He tried to get comfortable without tossing and turning the way he typically did at home on the memory foam mattress Dean had insisted would remember him, now hyperaware of Dean’s presence so close beside him. Cas finally settled on his side, his back to Dean, and pulled the blankets up over his shoulder. The blankets stretched taut a foot and a half above the mattress across the expansive gap between their respective shoulders, each of them occupying one extreme edge of the bed.
Dean smiled fondly at Cas, kind of understanding where he was coming from. “So caring about me got you all hot and bothered?”
“Good call,” Sam muttered. “So about your case. Out of all the hunters you know, you sought us out specifically.”
Billie gave him the look that series of statements deserved. “You mean like bringing Death back from the dead? That sort of cosmically imbalancing event?”
. It clearly had to be a mistake. Dean slowly reached up and laid his hand on Cas’s cheek, partly to assure himself that this was real and partly to make everything else stop spinning. Cas’s gasp let him know it was real, and if he focused on Cas’s eyes everything else ceased to matter anyway.
“Oh, uh, no. I’m fine, really. I’m waiting on some feedback on something I wrote, and it’s always a nerve-wracking process.”
“I think we need some more refrigerator magnets so we can use larger paper. I feel wasteful using so many of these tiny note squares.”
“I hope that you can help. I know that you’ve used similar spells to contain the souls of the departed, and I’d prefer not to resort to begging Billie for her assistance now. My separation from her service was conditional, and I fear that--even in the course of executing my duty to maintain the natural order and free these souls-- if I fail to free them without her interference I don’t want to face the consequences of that bargain. I stand to lose too much, personally. All the souls in creation cannot make up for the loss of the one I hold most dear. And yet dozens are in peril because I failed to act in time, so consumed I had become by the one.”
