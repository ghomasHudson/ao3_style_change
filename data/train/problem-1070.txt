"I–I–" Sherlock stammered and twisted his hands together. John frowned and took one of his hands.
Bill stopped what he was doing to look John square in the eye.
"I bet he's still a virgin," Jim replied.
They hit the pavement and Sherlock hailed a cab. John was about to follow there, too, when Sherlock slammed the door in John's face.
Mrs Stamford started laughing, too.
"So all this was just to get Sherlock and John together?" Mycroft choked out. "You didn't care about me at all, did you?"
"I have a fear of rushing water," John explained. "Washing my hands and taking a shower is fine." He pointed to the weather outside, "Rain, too. But a fast running river or even drawing a bath is out. I don't know why it's that specific, but according to my therapist, it can be. She says I associate the sound with when I got shot."
"Oh shush!" Sherlock growled at his brother. "A stranger then. Someone who hadn't known me for years."
He was perfect. "Mike Stamford."
John nodded. He looked around the car and then up at the thugs. "Charming."
But don't let that scare you off, it's brother bonding time. :D
John just smiled and ducked back into the lodge.
Only, he
The doctor slipped off his cock with a small slurp.
"Bertie picked me up after
"Not to me it's not. You are far too young. You have your whole life in front of you and I'm not going to be your foundation. I want someone who's been through life long enough to know who they are and what they want out of this life. And I think I've found him," John pleaded with her.
"It seemed to have worked," Greg pointed out. "Mycroft will remember me being tackled by Mr Hope and Mr Winters far quicker than he'll remember that I didn't kiss him that one time."
The rugby players helped him to his feet, murmuring apologies and offering to buy him drinks as recompense.
deal. She never claimed to be able to
She turned around and frowned. "What do you want?"
John covered his ears to protect his ears from the resulting shriek. And then as abruptly as it began it was gone. John looked up and the spirit was gone. "I think I love you," he blurted.
"Estate fraud, scam artist. He goes in as a medium and bilks rich, grieving families out of millions in most cases," Mike explained.
John gripped the sturdy metal rod like a cricket bat and inched toward the main hall. He had almost got to the door when a nearby window shattered, spraying the room with glass. John ducked and held the poker aloft, ready for anything.
I think this is THE quickest turn around for a chapter that wasn't already typed out I have EVER done. Now, don't get use to this, how fast a chapter gets done depends on how long it is. It might take two days or a week depending. But because it is already written, it shouldn't take longer than a week. Fingers crossed.
John and Sherlock were walking through Regent's Park, and after a few minutes John brought up Sarah's party.
"One of his favorite bands is playing there tomorrow night," John explained.
Shelock made it to the lab before John and heaved a sigh of relief. He needed the time to collect his thoughts.
And much to his chagrin, his brother picked up on that aspect. But then it was his brother after all, and no one knew him better.
Victor and John laughed.
John blushed furiously and bit down hard on his lower lip.
John would have liked to have said that he only had eyes for Sherlock, but the entire thing enchanted him. The way they were able to convey the whole story without uttering a single phrase or warble a tune. It was magnificent.
"Nah," Mike said, coming further into the room. "It doesn't show when you're out there." He tossed his head the direction of the party.
Anthea nodded and closed the door behind her.
"Excuse me?" Mycroft asked, unsure he had heard his brother correctly.
"This is your last chance to elope," Sherlock whispered to John as everyone arranged themselves.
Sherlock looked at her quizzically. "No, only that I thought you'd tell me if you had."
Greg caught him again, "You are not okay."
Sherlock looked in the mirror nervously as Molly tried to pin the corsage on his lapel.
have you been? I've been calling all fucking night. You been out doing drugs, sleeping around, stealing?"
Greg rubbed his face and sighed. He looked up at John and raised an eyebrow. "Do you really need that cane?"
shaping up to be quite the sleepover."
David crossed his arms in front of his chest as Mycroft and Greg squeezed him out to the far side of the sofa. Far away from his intended target.
She walked off, but she paused, "Mycroft darling, we aren't done talking about Oxford."
A couple hours later, Sherlock roused John for the soup, a cup of peppermint tea, and a trip to the bathroom, as well as medicine.
He nodded.
"Are you
Sherlock sighed and they rode on in silence. They were almost home when Sherlock spoke again.
Mycroft took Sherlock's hand. "You were right, you should be able to make your own decisions."
John chuckled.
"For you? Always," John replied, thrusting his hips forward.
"Yes," Sherlock said firmly.
Greg grabbed his plate and went to dispose of the food he was never going to eat. His skin itched. Despite what he told John and Mike, he wasn't sure that Mycroft would be forgiving for Saturday with this little stunt of his. But that laugh was enough to make it all worth it.
John sighed. "Promise?"
him."
"Yes, ha ha," Mycroft said bitterly. "I am fully aware you lot
"It went really well," John said, ducking his head. "I think we'll work together just fine."
"And my handler," Sherlock groused. "Who's sleeping with my brother." The look of disgust was clear on his face.
"Excuse me?" John nearly choked. "We aren't dating. I never said I would date you, and I'm interested in someone else. Someone
She looked at him skeptically, but let it drop.
Sherlock huffed out another sigh. "I'm not saying
"There are a lot of people who would like to talk to the man of the hour, so if you could spare him for a few moments, Sherlock, I'd like to take him off your hands," Greg huffed, hands on his hips.
A short while later, John came back clean and in a nice suit. Trailing behind him were three men: a jovial-looking, round man with glasses; a toothy redhead; and an older-looking man built on strong, sturdy lines, from his chin and broad shoulders to his thighs and barrel-chest.
"You can even hide it, so I have to look for it, if you'd like," Sherlock suggested, hopeful.
"I wouldn't have been able to get anything past you otherwise. Besides, it's not so bad; it's not as though he is coming with us or anything."
John opened the door and was surprised. Sitting on the professor's desk was Sherlock staring at his hands. His attire was almost ordinary and the sentence was out of John's mouth before he could stop it, "I thought you were going to up the ante again with your outfit."
John took another long draft of his water. "Tall, thin, reedy-looking bloke. Clothes that were more Victorian than modern. Goatee. Smarmy bastard. Why?"
notes on the scene, it must have been the one we discussed. And like with everything I've said, you have completely ignored my advice on the matter."
"So she was trying to climb out and fell hitting her head?" John supposed.
John snorted. "If we went to your room, I can pretty much guarantee that there wouldn't be much studying done. As enjoyable as that would be, I really do need to pass this class."
"Give."
"Mycroft, wait!" Greg yelled.
Sherlock shook his head, "I couldn't leave you. So I directed him to Mycroft. I hear they got along swimmingly."
Mycroft shrugged. "That's what Anthea said. But I guess he had us all fooled."
"Hey!" John growled. "Where the hell do you think you're going?"
"It's fine," John said.
There was something about the cadence and tone that made John frown further. The man was speaking oddly, and what did he mean by "live help"? John rubbed the dirt and grime from his eyes to see the stranger more clearly. Standing over him was a blond-haired, blue-eyed young man wearing the traditional Northumberland Fusiliers' cap, but in bright-red regimentals.
She stood up and grabbed her briefcase. "You'll change your tune once things start failing, and they will." Irene pointed at the contract. "You keep that, you'll need it."
John looked up into his lover's concerned expression and just had to kiss him again. "I'm not sure what was more soul crushing, the fact that they were the better team or that the referees were actively trying to slant the game in our favor and we
wouldn't be able to ask Mycroft out and he'd have to give the money back to Bertie. So here he was, about to do the most dangerous thing in the world (ask Mycroft Holmes out on a date) and he couldn't smoke.
"Enjoying yourself?" Irene asked shrilly. "What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
John looked over at him in surprise, "Yeah. Yeah, I do."
"Your brother is here to see you," she replied.
He became concerned when they stopped at a cemetery next to an old church. John got out and told the cabby to wait for them. They wouldn't be long.
Of course, that means I have to add a couple more scenes to flesh out the newly arranged sections, but I'm sure you guys won't mind more story. Right? ;)
John nodded, afraid to speak lest his voice crack. He didn't have the intention to be late again before he met his tutor. But now that he had, he would be early even if it killed him.
Sherlock moaned, one hand grasping the back of John's neck and his other running up and down John's arm.
Greg counted the money and sure enough there was £500.
Yeah another chapter! A whole chapter dedicated to their "not" date. Enjoy!
"I don't want to stand in the way of something you want to do, John," Sherlock breathed.
"Your book was fine, Lockie," Mycroft admonished. "It was 2010, for God's sake. Who knew the public would still be so adverse to a small kiss between two boys?"
one of them."
Sherlock blushed. "I kept reading those two lines over and over again, because it gave me hope that you might feel the same."
Sherlock smirked.
"Music doesn't help?" John asked, handing the book back to the publicist.
Sherlock huffed out a laugh. "If it's any consolation, I always planned to kill him off."
She was just waiting for Bobby to bring the Brie and then she could start. She smiled at the guests who were already there. Molly and Jackie were sitting on the sofa chatting about chemistry, and Ella and Louise were discussing psychology on the settee.
Mycroft nodded, but Sherlock rolled his eyes.
John followed the TV host and the cameraman dutifully back down the hallway. He didn't like it, but in some way he could see the appeal. He could show Sherlock that he hadn't called
After breakfast was cleaned up, John and Mike offered to help Mycroft's group unearth their Land Rover and get them on their way to Balmoral.
Sherlock chuckled. "A right hook into the jaw of the leader of the bullies to lay him low was proof enough that I wasn't a wilting violet. They gave me wide berth after that."
"Please!" Sherlock cried running up to John and grabbing his arm. "I don't know what I said or did wrong."
Bertie walked up to his car and leaned in close, "Good luck getting out, Mikey!" He gave an ironic salute and turned to go into the shop.
Sherlock blushed and John laughed.
Mr Lyons pulled out a book and turned to his bookmark. He began to read aloud,
Mary Morstan said from the back, "It was so romantic!"
John was out doing the last part of his Christmas shopping. Normally he didn't let it get this close to Christmas, but this gift was special. It was for Sherlock. He was coming out of the shop when he ran into the last person he expected to see. Mary. She was arm in arm with David, clearly at least four months pregnant.
John blushed. "Now you're taking the piss, aren't you?"
Up close Sherlock looked worse. This was a man who had stopped caring about himself and that made John's heart ache. Instinctively John reached out and ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair and immediately the detective's eyes fluttered open.
Sherlock snuggled close and nuzzled John's ear. "Mhmm."
else?"
Hands were grasping at clothes and moving them out the way to get that first touch of skin on skin. Shirts were dispatched with haste and Sherlock barreled John into the sofa. John gasped at the heated expression and then gasped again when Sherlock ground down.
John took a step back. "What the hell do you care for, Seb? This is rugby, mate. Most of us are gay, bi, pan or whatever. And it's not like I haven't had male lovers in the past, what's got your knickers in twist over this one?"
John laughed. Sherlock looked up at John and smiled. Greg's eyes went wide. He'd never seen Sherlock smile like that at anyone. It was almost adoring.
Sherlock lay there as a feeling of bliss settled over him. So this is what it felt like when your partner isn't in a hurry to get off and then bugger off. He liked it.
And everyone was sure that he'd actually keep that promise.
"Not yet," John said, shaking his head. "Sherlock forgot his scarf. Have you guys seen it?"
Sherlock hummed. "Well, I went and bagged me a very handsome soldier, so..."
John glanced over at the grinder and pursed his lips, "I can see that."
"Mike? Yeah, he's the one that told me about you for the tutoring thing."
"Just out of curiosity, who is this bloke?" Jim asked.
And then it came. It was tucked between a bill and an ad for weight loss. It wasn't an acceptance letter. Not really, but the publisher wanted to meet with him to discuss the possibility of releasing it. But it was still exciting.
"Oh!" Sherlock exclaimed. "I have your present." He moved from John's side to retrieve a small package from a nearby chair. But before John could mourn his loss, Sherlock was back at his side.
Sherlock fiddled with his rapier, "I would like to, but I can't go unless Mycroft does."
Mike pushed through the crowd, "Bertie, my mate, my pal, you can't just go around–"
Sherlock started making breakfast while John showered, it was better than pacing the floor. He decided to make crepes as they would be both light and filling.
Sherlock came with John's name on his lips, the doctor kissing him through his release.
"I wanted to be an author. I didn't want to be popular. Well, not popular like CS Lewis or JK Rowling, anyway. I wanted to be selling books and be able to write for the rest of my life.
The crowd was shifting nervously, they had started to wonder if Bertie had gone mad.
"True," Mycroft replied and then took a deep breath. "He gets worse."
count as date, Lestrade."
"Only good things, I hope," Sherlock said with a cheeky grin, puffing out his chest a little.
"That's good," Sherlock murmured. "Sometimes it takes a couple of tries to find the right one. Others it's instant connection. And don't be afraid to speak up. They may know the business, but you know your book."
"Ouch." Sherlock winced in sympathy.
"Oh hell, no. I wouldn't be able to eat it, then."
"I miscalculated."
Mrs Hudson smiled and then hit his arm. "Why didn't you tell me you had a date with Sherlock this Friday?"
"This is flagitious," Mycroft muttered as he struggled to stay upright.
There was a sharp poke in his side and turned around. The girl behind him hissed, "Take up your poem!"
Sherlock sat down in a huff and folded his arms across his chest.
Greg laughed. "No offense to your brother, mate. I mean I know he's supposed to be the shit or whatever, but I don't see it."
Sherlock chuckled. "Enough about me, I saw that last match...are you all right?"
John smiled and Sherlock's brain threatened to go offline again.
"I think he's scared," Mike said wisely.
"It took me that long to convince the idiot shop boy to get it for me. He spent the whole time on his mobile," Sherlock sniffed.
John laughed. "Likes to cook then, your brother-in-law?"
John began to flip through the book trying to figure out what he had just said.
Sherlock blushed and Anderson stopped walking with them, mouth hanging open. "Uh..let's see. It was built in 1896 by a Charles Augustus Milverton, who named it Appledore. It also has a long and terrible history of misfortune."
"My hero!" she cried, and then kissed him full on the lips.
"Does it have to be in iambic pentameter?" Mycroft asked.
Morning came and the mechanic came and went. It was time to say goodbye to Mycroft, Greg, and Sherlock.
John sighed. "Yeah, I'll take care of it."
John nodded, but hugged his lover fiercely. "I'll miss you so, so much."
"Is there anything else you do, you magnificent creature? You dance, you play violin, just tell me you have a singing voice like that of a frog choir..." John said, but trailed off when he saw the blush creep up Sherlock's ears. "God damn it!"
“I know,” she said, kissing him one more time. “But I’ll be back before you know it.”
At the moment she was taking away someone's weed and crisps. Greg had to hide a smile. There was no rule prohibiting food in detention, so...Yeah, Prof Smallwood was going to have a
Mrs Hudson sat him down and went over the things that he would need to do, what he would need to get at the shops, and how patient he would need to be. Sherlock absorbed it all, drinking in every facet of information he could squeeze from her.
look amazing."
He thought back to what he said in the study and his jaw dropped. "Oh, shit. Oh, shit." He scrambled to stand up. He placed his water bottle on the small table that bore flowers, next to the door.
Enjoy!!
"Bored!" Sherlock shot at the wall again, this time from behind his back.
"Damn, I'm sorry," John commiserated. "What's this one going to be about?"
"Oh, Miss Hooper," Sherlock purred. "The possibilities are endless."
The umbrella hit the pavement with a crack. "Of course it–"
"Sussex," John murmured.
The original plan was to have an event every month that showed them falling more in love with each other. Only I got June and went "fuck it!" and threw my hand in the air in defeat. I just couldn't come up with twelve unique moments. So if the first two chapters feel tighter, time wise, that would be why. I also wanted to show Greg and Mycroft's wedding, but it just didn't fit in with the rest of story. Much to my dismay. :(
John grabbed his hair, "Oh my God! I just want to wrap my hands around your neck–"
Was Sherlock worth all this effort?
"Hence the appeal," Mycroft snapped. "Besides, don't you want to know who took Sherlock home from school?"
"So this is why you didn't want to marry me, isn't it?" John accused. "It's a lot harder to have a bit on the side when you're planning a wedding."
Dale looked over at John, "I think you're in
I've started typing up part 5 and it's looking like it might be part 5 and a small epilogue. But we'll see.
Mycroft's face lit up and he grinned, "That is fantastic." He went in for a kiss but as their lips almost touched, Greg got yanked away.
Sebastian shook his head, "Before I took over the company from my late father, M&M's accountant came to me. Mr Knowles informed me that both our fathers had run the company like their own personal piggy bank.
John fidgeted with his cane nervously as he waited for the train that would take him out to the apparently grand estate of the owner of Shercroft Publishing. Mr M Holmes had paid for John's ticket and had told him that there would be someone waiting at the train station to take him to the house out in Sussex.
"You could have just told me that you were gay," Molly said as she patted her hair.
Greg's smile grew into a grin and mounted his horse. Mycroft mounted his horse too and on their way back, they ran their horses through some of the maneuvers that Greg had learned in France so he could really show off his talents in the saddle. Mycroft was a good player, but he could hardly keep up.
Toby: Did he tell you?
"Sir, I'm going to need you to calm down. You are making a scene," she sniffed.
"I'm good for business on and off field, Watson," Seb snarled. "Though I hear your escapades
Just then their food arrived, Angelo bringing the meal out himself. He waited until they took the first bite and once he got their approval, went merrily back to the kitchen.
I'm so sorry. It was a combination of things, getting sick, writing a murder mystery for my birthday party, writing a slightly more explicit sex scene than I'm use to, and not wanting this story to be over with.
He only stopped when Mike sent,
He took a deep breath and realized that his lungs felt clear, too. He spotted the humidifier and frowned.
As he neared John, Sherlock could see that the flower was a lychnis viscaria.
Now it was Mrs Hudson who blushed. "Oh, it was the least I could do, with Sherlock standing up with his mother. I couldn't leave you standing there with no one."
subsequent books go left to right."
"No."
"Because my dad would kill me if he thought I was going to a party," John explained with a wince. "So I told him I was spending the night here."
"He was livid when he found out, fired both of them on the spot. But she had to get through them first," Sherlock explained. He moved another piece. "After the failure with my book and after winning gold at the Olympics, I was at loose ends. So Mycroft decided to have me intern in a couple different departments, see if there was anything I might be interested in."
John barked out a laugh. "That other person is
Sherlock took a deep breath and whispered into the phone, "He liked my book."
"Well, thanks to you and Mummy, I don't get that luxury," Sherlock sneered. "I am the only sixth former that was asked to the prom, and I can't go because you don't feel like it."
John smiled down at the detective. "I know," he whispered back, as they pulled up to 221. He got up and went to open all the their doors to make getting Sherlock in easier. He came back and paid the cabbie.
"I just want a normal life," Sherlock whined. "And dating is part of that. Everyone dates."
"Oh!"
"He liked it," Mycroft said sotto voce.
"Now, listen here," John said, his voice cold and piercing as steel. "Sherlock has been nothing but supportive and he never faked sympathy to get in my pants."
Mike and John caught up to Greg at lunch and demanded to know what had happened.
The TV host stood there for a moment, in shock but then moved to wrap his arms around John. "Thank you."
"You look fantastic," John said, as he moved to the side to let Sherlock in.
"I told her where I was," Sherlock scoffed. "She just didn't believe me."
"Gotcha!" Mycroft taunted.
Murray sighed. "Well, no. But how else would you explain it? There was no one else there. No evidence of anyone out there but you, surrounded by those not so lucky."
"If you don't mind," John replied. "It would be good to walk around before being pretzelled into the back of car." He lifted his cane ruefully to make his point.
Enjoy!
Sherlock nodded and then ducked his head. "I was worried that maybe you quit because of me fainting," he admitted shyly.
Sherlock smiled up at him. "Good." He chewed on his lip for a minute before he blurted, "Iwantyoutomoveinwithme!"
So John learned to grit his teeth and bear it. Today, he wasn't so lucky.
"You order that mango sticky rice you ordered last time."
"Sherlock kissed me," John admitted shyly.
Mycroft was so absorbed in his task of brushing down his horse that it took him a few minutes to notice the boy watching him. He rolled his eyes and squared his shoulders. He turned to face Greg, mask firmly in place.
"What? Did the bastard over-estimate the amount?"
Ajay laughed. "Greg, you're of age, you can go wherever the hell you want. But you know why I've got to ask."
"Hello, this is Sherlock. I do hope you'll forgive me if I'm being presumptuous, but Mycroft sent me your contact information and I wanted to let you know that my business has kept me away from the bookshop longer than I anticipated. I didn't want you to think that I had been avoiding you or the shop since our return to London -SH"
Sherlock scowled and Mycroft turned away.
Sherlock stormed out and nearly ran into Mycroft. "Can't you convince some muppet to take you to prom so that I can experience a normal adolescence for once in my life?"
"That's a wrap, everyone!" Sally called out.
John mentally noted that, "Anything else you can tell me that might help?"
Then the most popular boy in school, Bertie Gruner, spoke up, "As opposed to a bitter, self-righteous tosser who has no friends?"
John dug the black box out of his pocket and tossed it to Mike, who caught deftly in one hand. The two women shared expressions of shock as Mike got down on one knee in front his long-time girlfriend.
"Yeah," Mary agreed. "What surprise?"
Okay, so Sherlock wasn’t much better, but he was only rude to Cathy because she was rude to him first. John wanted to run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair...
John's phone beeped signaling he got a call.
Now, the reason it took a little bit longer to get this chapter out is because after I hit the part this chapter ends I realized (with no small amount of horror on my part) that if I left it as is, the next chapter will be LONG, like by almost 1000 words or so. So I kept writing and ended it on cliffhanger. But I sent it to my beta, and to my husband Sidheman and they both agreed the original stopping point was better story-wise. But I was still having a panic attack that the next chapter was going to be so much longer than this one. But as my adoring husband pointed out, 1000 words may SEEM like a lot, but it's only a couple more pages. So I let cooler heads prevail and you get the chapter as it was intended. And you know, the joy of a nice looooonnnng chapter for next time, of which I have head start on.
draft and it's killing me. I'm trying to bridge these two scenes," he said defiantly.
Sherlock chuckled darkly, "Who said anything about turning it over to the police? I would have sent it to every news station and publication on both isles and watched as your reputations went up in flame."
Once the car came to a stop, John got out and made his way to Mr Holmes.
John cleared his throat and lifted his chin, his back ramrod straight. He did a perfect about face and looked Sherlock square in the eye.
Bertie strolled up to Greg with all the confidence of the perpetually dense. Brazen and without care.
Mycroft waved him off. "Yes, yes. Fine. I need to get back to my client."
"And how in the hell are you going to do that?" Greg asked. These two didn't look like they shared a single brain cell between them.
John chuckled and got up. He cleaned up their mess of clothes and he smiled when he heard the shower turn on. He picked up the ice lollies and put them in the ice box, then finally made his way to the bathroom. He felt happier than he had in ages.
Sherlock sighed. "What about other things?"
His lips found Sherlock's and the world fell away. He always thought that phrase was a literary device, but it was true. The world had become just the two of them, on the hearth rug at 221B Baker Street.
"You were absolutely brilliant, Sherlock," John said as he neared the dancer.
"Oh, no, I'm fine," David said with a smile. "I'm staying the week with you all."
Had Sherlock been standing, his knees would have gone out from the sheer relief of John taking over. "That would be wonderful."
"We know their names. If you were paying attention when they were trying to fight off our hypothermia," Sherlock replied smugly.
Anthea browsed some more before deciding on the first dress, the wine gown. She supposed that she should have picked something more Shakespearean, but she didn't think that a dress from that time period would fit through the doors at school.
"Me, too."
John nursed the beer Mike Stamford had bought him.
"John," Sherlock began. "I pledge to remember when running into danger that the most important thing is that you are always with me, even if it means I have to stop and explain. I pledge to try and understand that there are times and places for genius and there are times and places for gentleness. And trusting you to guide me into knowing which is which.
I would love to say that this means the next chapter should be out faster, but I'm really not taking bets on that right now. It kills me that it's taking so long, but it will be done. Otherwise Old Ping Hai will being doing the kicking instead of my depression. :D
Okay. That wasn't what Greg was expecting. "Excuse me?"
John went home, feeling pensive. He hadn't thought much about Sherlock's romantic past. He had asked Mrs Hudson once during the Irene Adler fiasco, but other than Janine, John hadn't seen him with anyone. But it did seem more than a tad ridiculous that Sherlock had never had a romantic entanglement before Janine.
Sherlock opened his mouth and then closed it. "Better yet, I'll have Mycroft email it to you."
Sherlock cracked a small, fragile smile.
"It's one face to face, it's not as though I'm asking you to do this all the time," Mycroft reasoned. "In fact, this is the first time I have ever done so."
"Why? What's wrong with burgers?" John asked.
John smiled, "It won't be a problem."
John came back and Sherlock had his dance. They danced really slow, and Sherlock held on for dear life. When he started this, he was so sure that Mycroft and Mummy had been wrong, that the world wasn't as bad as they had made it out to be. But he had gotten his taste of cruelty and it hurt.
Mrs Hudson smiled at him, "You already are rich, darling."
He read and reread the message before he hit send. And then came the part he detested most of all, the waiting for a reply.
But yay! New chapter. And I think because of the raise in level of angst it has made me a bit anxious. But here you go!
many doors. And trying to figure out which one held a certain annoying publicist without feeling like he was invading the owners' privacy was quite a bit of challenge.
About halfway through the practice, music began to play over the loudspeakers. Mycroft thought he recognized the the first strains of the song, but as he was about to put a name to it, Greg stepped out from announcer's box and slid down the flag pole to the bleachers. Greg pulled a microphone out of his pocket and began to sing:
"Let's do this," John muttered.
"Why couldn't you get ready at your house?" Mike asked, as John styled his hair.
John walked into the room and realized that he was seeing a Sherlock Holmes with his defenses down. The fancy clothes were gone, the makeup absent, and his expression open and trusting.
"Why?"
He handed it to Greg and then turned on his heel and walked off, leaving behind a stunned and completely poleaxed Greg, who looked at the £100 in his hand and shoved it in his pocket. Now to figure out how to ask a bloke out. He ran his fingers over his face and sighed. This was his literal worst nightmare. Despite how he looked, he had never gone out with anyone before. He just didn't have the time before...and now? Now he's about to ask the most difficult person in the whole school out on a date. He was in hell.
"Mike..." Sherlock began. "Wait, he's a fan of the show?"
John trotted up to Mike, "Hey, you okay?"
Why was it so hard for John to ask for what he wanted? What he really wanted. Of course, Sherlock thought that it was wanting his family back. But that ship had sailed.
"I bet the records she showed me weren't Shercroft Publishing financial statements, but our own," Jim growled. "She told me if I started messing around with their orders, I could make them come crawling to us and we could renegotiate at a much better rate.
David grinned at John, who couldn't help but think he was in competition for something.
She twittered happily when they got out of the car and stood there looking at the fancy front entrance while Sherlock handed off the keys to the valet. Sherlock ushered her in and up to the maitre d's station.
Greg leaned forward, eager. "Where?"
He had bought the ring about a week ago and he was practically vibrating with pent-up happiness. It was a wonder that Mary didn't suspect something. Well, to be fair she
Which prompted John to plan a birthday party for the lanky detective, much to Sherlock's obvious dismay.
And John soaked it all up.
Greg shook his head. "I was at the cafe over there and saw your car, so I thought that I would stop by and say 'hi'," he explained, pointing across the street to the cafe which had his Triumph parked out front.
Sherlock had been in his mind palace since John snuck off to work. There was only one option left, but he didn't think he could go back to that. Running around the world chasing down the remnants of Moriarty's cell had taken a rather sizable chunk out of his soul, and he wasn't sure he could give any more. Plus that meant asking Mycroft for help.
"Hold tight, you're in no fit state to drive yourself home," Mike said. "One of us will take you home, okay?"
Mike raised an eyebrow, "Watch this. Hey, guys!"
Mike and John shared a shocked glance.
"Mummy, this isn't some horrid John Hughes film. For one, those are set in America, we're British. Two, they are fiction! Those things only happen to those that want them to."
"I've slept over at my boyfriend's flat before, but I doubt that's what you mean here," Sherlock said with a shrug.
Mike looked at his mum. "Always thought that having a dad was better than not having one at all, but not if he's like that. Sorry, Mum." Mrs Stamford hugged him.
Mycroft whipped his head up and snarled, "You leave him alone."
Mycroft's eyebrows furrowed. "You are part of this company, it is the least you can do while I deal with one of our most
Mycroft ran for the door and couldn't be more grateful that Prof Smallwood was too shocked to call him back.
Sherlock snuggled in close and just before slumber overtook him, he said, "Me, too."
Sherlock: New characters were added and their arcs were included to round out the story a bit more.
She squealed for joy and thanked them all before dashing out to her car. She couldn't wait for prom.
"That sounds fantastic," John said.
Anthea paused. Mike seemed like a good enough guy. Knew his Shakespeare, didn't immediately stare at her tits, and
Sherlock opened the door and before John could take three steps into the study, he was blasted by screaming.
The maitre d' rolled her eyes and then spoke slowly, "Because this is an upscale restaurant. If you want to take your mother out to dinner, go to some franchise."
"Looks like we'll be having our guests stay a little longer," Mike said with a smile.
"I thought I wanted a simple life. A quiet life with a white picket fence, a pretty wife, and the requisite number of children. But Sherlock showed me that I didn't want that. That in all likelihood, I never have. I was still chasing that desire when Sherlock fainted running after a criminal."
There were a few moments of contented silence before Sherlock spoke. "Mycroft told you about Victor, didn't he?" he murmured.
Sherlock moved his hand off his eyes and looked at John, confused. He had been expecting to get some kind of pity from John, but when there was silence he looked up. "What?"
Sherlock listened again. "Oh for fuck's sake. Tell Jim to get his head out of his arse and read the God damned email. It's for the trade paperback and not for the standard."
It very much had the opposite effect. Once people found out that I had used a pseudonym, the backlash became a veritable shit storm.
"I'm sorry, John," Sherlock whispered. "I couldn't stand it."
There was silence on the other end for a moment before, "Oh." It was quiet and a tad reverent.
"Well, I happen to think you're worth it," John insisted. "So tell me what you've been up to. What does a fancy publicist do?"
"Uh-oh, what's he done now?"
John looked back at the house and saw Mrs Holmes staring out the window at them like some horror movie villain.
John pulled his lover in for another hug. "Love, you could have shown up with takeaway and you and I would have been over the moon."
"Hey, Mycroft," he said when the other person had picked up.
The crowd looked far more apologetic at that.
John looked at the hand that held the drink for the toast and the other hand that held Sherlock's and sighed. "I don't have enough arms. But I will swat you for that later."
Toby: Agreed!
"I hadn't thought about doing a strictly romantic story, to be honest," John replied.
Sherlock's long fingers sought thighs, and skidded across abs. His lips pressed against ribs, and the neck. All John could do is hold on to Sherlock's shoulders for support.
Sherlock laughed. "I'll say, my John is quite the romantic."
Sherlock was starting to notice small changes in John's behavior.
"I hate you," Sherlock growled, stalking his way to his office.
John shouted for the women and they sprang into action. Mary and John called out the orders to the others for blankets, to boil water, and to stoke the fire back to full blaze. Mike began pulling off the wet outer layers of the travelers. Afterwards he spread the coats and sweaters to dry over any surface he could find that didn't have a warm body on it.
"Hey, don't be like that, My," Greg soothed. "It was nice of them to take us in and not only provide a warm place to stay the night, but breakfast. They didn't have to do any of that."
Sherlock coughed. "A lot of things happened after the meeting that could have changed his mind."
"And you're gonna tell me that you were just swept up in the moment and went along for the ride?" Greg huffed in disbelief.
Mycroft was in his office, standing over his desk getting ready to leave for the Diogenes, when Anthea poked her head in.
Sherlock blushed. "You can't possibly now that."
A couple of kids passed by him talking.
Suddenly Mrs Hudson was at his side and directing him to a chair to sit on. "I'm so sorry, John. You warned me and warned me, but I thought it was just a silly old crush that she would get over. I never thought she would do this!"
"Club Dio as in Club Diogenes?" Greg asked. They both nodded. "I can't be seen there. All right?"
John blinked. He assumed that Shercroft was the last name of whoever owned the company. "And I guess that would mean that Mycroft is the 'croft' part of that equation."
Mary Morstan, you arse."
"Right in here," Mike said, opening the door to a storage closet.
Mary rolled her eyes. "Of course I do, John. But as your girlfriend, I have to be there to support you."
Mycroft's face crumpled and he looked at Mike and John who were steadfastly looking elsewhere. "I did not mean to sound ungrateful. Of course, I appreciate all that you've done for us. I'm just concerned about Mummy. I could not get any reception up here, and she must be over her head with worry."
Once Victor had pointed it out, Sherlock could see the family resemblance. Which was actually worse; suddenly he had the overwhelming desire to run.
"Yes," Sherlock managed to croak out.
Mycroft rolled his eyes again, "As opposed to planet 'look-at-me, look-at-me'?"
No amount of cheering and dog whistling would convince them to stop.
Mike turned back to John and flashed him a grin. "Uh, just ignore them."
Greg rolled his eyes again and stormed out.
The whole class remained silent. Even Greg, who rarely made it class, ducked his head and hoped Mr Lyons wouldn't call him. Mycroft saw Greg shy away and made a decision.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nodded, "I am sorry, but being duped doesn't excuse the absolutely appalling behavior, so I will not be losing that tape, no matter how sorry I am."
He was bone-weary tired. That could be the only explanation.
Sherlock shrugged even though Mycroft couldn't see him, "Better terms than that meeting should have allowed for, certainly, but I'm not sure it could be counted as
John dropped the poker and leapt for the door, pulling it open before Mike could holler for him to wait. The wind threw the door open wide and four bundled figures fell through, the one in the back falling on top of the other three.
"It's so good to see you, Sherlock," Victor enthused, warmly taking Sherlock's hand and shaking it, while placing his other hand on the detective's shoulder.
Something must be done.
Greg took the box and groaned when he saw that it contained nicotine patches. "So I'm a non-smoker?" he asked as he threw the box into his bag.
Anthea nodded, impressed. "I didn't think he had it in him."
"Stop card counting, if it's illegal in Las Vegas, it's against the rules," John growled.
"I'm afraid so."
I haven't started typing up my other story yet because I found out that I have cubital tunnel syndrome. Which is like carpal tunnel syndrome but instead of it being in the wrist, it comes from the elbow. So my left hand is super weak, and even typing this up aches, so... yeah. It's going to be place on hold until I get better. Which sucks.
Mycroft paused and then let out a strangled, "When?"
Sherlock: I was seventeen.
John ran to get towels and the first aid kit in case it was needed. Burns were nasty and shouldn't be taken lightly. But by the time he had returned, Sherlock Darling had taken off. John sighed, but went about cleaning up the mess.
"Come on, boss, would I come to ya with just assumptions?" Wiggins whined.
Seriously, though. Greg's backstory was written and rewritten so many times that it makes my head spin just thinking about it.
John moved to sit next to him on the stoop and said, "You know those things will kill you, right?"
Sherlock nipped at John's throat and he let out a low moan.
He could only see John's back, but he had a clear view of the PC. She smiled at his John and said, "So I was wondering if you wanted to go and grab a bite to eat. I'm really starved."
"Actually, it's John," John replied, "and yeah I am."
There was above the belt when Sherlock needed to squeeze past him in the kitchen. Sometimes in the back, sometimes his sides. Down the arm when trying to get John's attention. From the wrist to the fingers when he'd take something from John's grasp. But there was one touch that John loved. The one he couldn't get enough of, the one that Sherlock did most frequently.
Greg flashed Mycroft a smile and then bit his lip as the band started playing.
"Call me John," John said.
Sherlock wasn't sure which emotion took dominance. It seemed like there was a battle between fear, jealousy, anger, and distress. Victor nudged him again.
"I don't think so!" Mycroft called.
Mike looked at Anthea for help. "Fine, Mike will take Sherlock home, I'll see to Mycroft and John can see to Greg."
"That was for making my date bleed," Sherlock snarled and then hit him again in the nose. "That's for my brother." And then he kneed Bertie between his legs. "And
Sherlock nodded.
The next morning John was up and making breakfast when Sherlock came out, wrapped in a sheet from the bed.
"No, I don't," Mike ground out. "Look, he's like the stars. You can love them, but they won't love you back."
"Uh," Sally pointed out, "that was for your nose."
"Wow." She looked at the card in her hand. "Did you go?"
Sherlock turned in dread to John, assuming that he was going to yell at him for Molly.
"Right in one. But they weren't the only stories he had stolen from her, he had been stealing her work from before they got married," Sherlock explained.
is for me."
Also I have chapter seven done and will be getting that one edited soon. Hopefully in the next day or so. And eight is on the pipeline.
"I quit."
"I want to pay you to take Mycroft to prom," Bertie snarled.
Sherlock couldn't have been more grateful when his schedule evened out and he was able to return to the bookshop for his morning gossip with Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock ducked his head and then reached into his bag and tossed Greg the phone. “You know the pass code,” Sherlock growled.
"I didn't know the red pen was still a thing, I thought it would be all digitized at this point," John admitted.
" Sherlock protested.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's not ours either!" Sherlock bellowed.
Greg looked at the scrawny kid who had squeezed past him as he walked into Mrs Hudson's office and immediately pegged him for the new kid. As long as he stayed out of Greg's way, he didn't really care.
"Mhmm," Sherlock agreed, licking into John's mouth. Kisses became heated and soon they were lost to the world.
"Christ, if I know," Greg huffed. "He dashed off like always. By the time me and my team caught up to him, the suspect was gone, and Sherlock was there on the ground. There was no physical damage or any indication he was drugged, so passed out is the best thing they could figure."
Divya came up and kissed John full on the lips as well.
"Of course he's going to say yes, Sherlock," Mike said. "Now go get him." He thumped Sherlock on the back and stood to the side to let Sherlock pass.
John huffed out a disgruntled noise before taking his own running leap to the other building. He landed on his feet without so much as a steadying hand for balance. He raced to the far side of this building, where Sherlock was already leaping to the next. They barreled down this building's escape ladders and straight through to the street, where Sherlock slammed into their suspect.
"He threatened me!" Moriarty crowed.
"You don't want to go home?" Mike asked, frustrated.
"Not really, no," John grumped.
"Did lightning hit the tree you were in?" John asked gently.
"It pisses me off. The book had a good plot, better characters with realistic relationships, and good pacing. I don't know why it got such vitriol." John stopped for a moment. He was on his feet. "No, I take that back, it's because not only was the main character gay, but it showed him in a healthy relationship with another boy with all the trappings of a hetero relationship."
John thumbed through them and grimaced. There were a lot of Indie punk with really weird names in the pile.
"John, please. Just calm down, you're overreacting now," Mary murmured.
"Where do you think Sherlock learned it from?"
"Oh hell no. Her and Clara are in the middle of one of their knock-out, drag-out fights at the moment. Harry throws things when she's pissed."
The three of them stood in front of the door that led back into the study. John took a deep breath and braced himself for the screaming as Sherlock opened the door.
"Seriously, John. You look like a good stiff wind would knock you over. We can suffer one night with him if you want to go home and get a good night's sleep before tackling a grumpy flatmate."
"So he's not failing for the Lestrade charm and you don't know what else to do?"
John's eyebrows shot up, "All right, then. Chapter eleven..." He turned to the appropriate page and began at the top. "
"That's the plan," Sherlock growled. "I assure you, next time I'll be more patient."
John was taut, a white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel, fighting the urge to do just that.
Mycroft tried to get away and scrambled on all fours, but Greg grabbed his hips and put Mycroft back into a standing position.
John brought Sherlock down for a kiss and then said, "Meaning that I will be in charge of your Valentine's Days for the foreseeable future."
Cathy stopped in the middle of hopping on one foot trying to get her shoe on. “Um...well, I’ll be on location for a couple of days, so probably not until the weekend.”
," Greg sang, and as he reached the end of the chorus, he pointed to Mycroft, who couldn't help but laugh.
Bertie grimaced at the amount, but while he wanted to haggle the price down, he knew that Greg had a point and if he wanted to win that bet with Jim, he was gonna have to pony up. So he dug into his wallet and pulled out the other £80.
Rest in Peace
"And I plan on staying that way," Mike said firmly.
Mycroft rolled his eyes, "Oh, for heaven's sake! Hemmingway was a drunk narcissist who squandered his life trying to get a leg up on Picasso's leavings."
"You're a publicist?" John asked, and suddenly everything about the man made sense.
"Yeah, well, shut it," Greg growled. "It was something he had to find out for himself."
"It's all right, darling. I understand, which is why when you go to Oxford, I hope you'll let me at least cheer for you on the bandstand."
Update: apparently ao3 glitched and people only saw chapter five today. I also wasn't getting notifications when people did comment. So hopefully people can see it now.
"Of course," John said, already pulling out his phone.
John nudged Sherlock and even whispered in his ear, "He is just a friend, Sherlock. I only have eyes for you."
John frowned. "Why?"
John decided to put some distance between him and Mary so that he could see the relationship with a fresh perspective. So all night, while everyone celebrated the season and the happy couples, John watched Mary interact with his friends.
"He's being re-deployed right after and won't have the time to devote to it."
John didn't know where to look. He just wanted to be gone.
"John here," Mike pointed to John, "would like to date Sherlock Holmes, but seeing as his brother is a bit of a tough nut to crack, we thought we could lend a hand," he explained.
John went and got a bit of his favorites and sat down at the table. He watched Sherlock pour two drinks and handed one to John.
Mycroft's voice cracked and he was forced to stop a moment before he could go on. Greg held his clasped hands to his face, elbows resting on the desk and tried to fight back his own tears.
Mike's smile grew bigger. "Deal. Enjoy your date, Watson. And don't worry, I'm staying the night at Divya's." he added with a wink at Sherlock.
Mycroft sneered. "Of course it's not Sherlock's fault. It's clearly John's."
"Sure thing," Wiggins replied.
Sherlock sighed. That was the question, wasn't it? "I was trying to punish you for being away all the time," he admitted after a long silence.
John blinked at her for at least a minute, bleary-eyed. He coughed into his sleeve and away from her. When he looked up, she was giving him that pitying look she had down to an art.
When John showed up to work the next day, tired and rumpled, he got exactly three reactions. Sympathy from Mrs Hudson, amusement from James, and from Mary? If he didn't know better, he would have said that she was brooding. And he had no reason for her attitude, it stumped him.
John's head shot up. "Oh. Right."
"We are doing fine," Sherlock growled. "May I remind you, we aren't small time, and haven't been in over thirty years. We have our own e-book line and are adding more and more books from our catalogue every day. I do not need a handout or pittance from anyone, least of all, Whiphand Publishing."
“You do remember you have a girlfriend, right?” Mike asked, concerned.
"He won't need you for a couple of hours, he's asleep for fuck's sake!" Greg pleaded. "I need to stop this guy before he slaughters half the population of Brixton!"
Brook turned to Anderson, "If I see so much as a second of this on that show of yours, I will ski-in you."
"Excellent! Excellent!" Angelo thundered. "I'll have it out to you soon."
Bertie led Sherlock away from Mycroft and further into the party.
"What the hell, Sherlock!" John yelled, and slammed the door behind him.
"As long as the lightning and thunder is going on out there, it's best if you focus on you," John murmured.
Mycroft sidled up him as he stood in the doorway, stunned.
Mycroft rolled his eyes and kicked his horse into motion, leaving Greg behind without so much as a word or backward glance.
"Are Croup and Vandermar going to be my jailers?"
The band stopped as if on cue and quietly marched off the field as if that was as far into the song they had intended to play.
"You?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock bent down and began to pick through the larger pieces of glass with his handkerchief. He picked up the thumb drive and held it up for Wiggins to see.
"Are you all right?" the publicist asked, concerned.
"You do realize that after a couple of nights sleeping on the floor, you are going to be stiff and cranky beyond measure, don't you?" Sherlock asked, as he added the linen closet to his map.
John rang off and then bit his lip. He looked around briefly and then jumped in the air from joy.
"What am I doing here?" Sherlock moaned again.
Mycroft chuckled. "Only if you include interest."
"I just wanted to date too, but I honestly thought they were just trying to set you up with him. I didn't know about Bertie and everything."
"I'll tell you what," John said, coming further into the room, "if you come out fully dressed and are moderately polite, I'll let you do the experiment with the pigs feet. Which sounds vile, by the way."
"You must despise me at this point, and guess what? At least three more days of this!" Sherlock gestured to himself. "Catering to the whims of your worst enemy is enough to drive anyone mad."
Here we are at the end and I want to thank everyone who has commented on this story. With particular thanks to purplehedgehog13, OhGodYes_CptWatson, NotaCapriSun, and sweetmarly, who commented on so many chapters (and in some cases all of them) and made it so much easier to dive right into the next chapter so I could see what their reactions would be. This story wouldn't be the same without you.
John and Sherlock shared a glance. "Actually, that brings me to my good news," Sherlock explained.
"Like I believe that you didn't know it was me coming down here today," John scoffed.
"What should we do?"
"I behaved childishly," Sherlock muttered.
John smiled. "All right, last call. Anything else you need to grab from the flat?"
"Sounds good," Greg replied. "So...um...kicking Chuck Magnusson in the bullocks?"
John carded his fingers through Sherlock's hair getting out the rest of the debris. "Purple is just fine, though red would be good, too. More forever or undying than one-sided or hopeless, I think."
"Oh, bloody ha," John murmured. "They know I can be discreet. I've done it before. I think it's more that Sherlock has turned down one too many 'my necklace is missing' and having it turn out to be pawned for gambling debts or given to the mistress. But Sherlock has been trying. He's been around to the Yard and his brother's office every day and that's when he's not calling them every five minutes."
"Let's get this over with," Sherlock snarled.
Sherlock frowned. "Worth what?"
Greg didn't even bother to look up, "I'm kinda busy here, John."
"Now, Mummy, it was just a boy..." Sherlock replied. He glared at Mycroft, who stuck out his tongue at him behind their mother's back.
John took a deep breath and squeezed his eyes shut. He imagined that he could smell her perfume from here. He opened his eyes. Mary wasn't next to her latest conquest, she was out on the dance floor. She moved so slow and sensuously, John was entranced.
"And you're worried he'll go back."
"I don't care," Sherlock snarled, throwing his hands in the air.
"You can fuck off."
John could hear the assassin bride screeching in agony and then nothing. He looked up when Sherlock touched his shoulder.
Sherlock's eyes darted around the heart and gasped, "It's yours!"
"What does she make of all this traveling?" the publicist asked.
"David, you need a hand, too?" John asked as Mike dug out as many shovels as he could find.
"I prefer to work with people I am comfortable with," Sherlock said, dryly.
"As you wish. What is your association with Sherlock Holmes?" the man asked, kicking his umbrella, swinging it up to examine its tip.
John got a text message and smiled when he read it.
Sorry!!! I had this chapter done for a long time, just not typed up and edited (by the wonderful Old Ping Hai, no less). But here it is. I have this other story that is making my muse salivate in anticipation and I want to get this out so I can focus on the other story sans guilt about this one.
"My pleasure, love."
"That's different," Sherlock replied haughtily. "This is what he gets for ruining my life."
"Oh?" John asked, intrigued.
Sherlock shook his head, "Just rest, I've got you."
"It's good to be walking again," John admitted. "It appears that I just needed a cause to fight for."
And sure enough, all four men laid in a heap on the floor, still laughing.
"Oh? Checking your eyelids for leaks, then?" John asked.
"I'm guessing chicken, pork, or beef?" Sherlock asked, setting a napkin on his lap.
"Does he kidnap all your boyfriends?" John asked, jerking his thumb at Mycroft.
Major Watson raised an eyebrow and got into his car without a word. John sat there on the ground as he drove off. Once the car was out of sight, Mike and his mum came running out to the street.
"When the alternative is watching you twitch, I'll take plying you with booze any day."
John rubbed his face. "I don't have a fear of crowds or public speaking or any of that, but for some reason my anxiety spiked and began to hyperfocus on the sudden upheaval of my life." He stopped for a second and then swore a blue streak. "Okay so maybe not for no reason."
The party was going better than expected, Sherlock thought. John promising that he could test the toxicity of the holly versus the mistletoe, and that wasn't even his present, had kept his mouth from running too far. He had John's present in his breast pocket and it was making him nervous.
"Oh yes. It's just so lovely seeing my boys finally tying the knot."
"I saw the notice said that everyone could bring a plus one," Mary said with a sniff. "You bringing anyone?"
"You know Vauxhall Cross?" Mycroft asked, incredulous.
It was time.
Mike chuckled. "I'll raise you ten that not only will John get him out, he'll be mostly pleasant. John was in the army, after all."
"Hello, gorgeous," he said to both of them.
Mike cracked his neck. "It's a waste. They should just sell it, but they keep saying they'll come back up here. They're retired and they still haven't made the effort."
Sherlock sighed. There was nothing for it; if Greg of all people could see it then there was no point hiding it. “He’s a rugby player, the star of the London team, apparently.”
Sally and Sherlock looked at each other in disgust and replied together, "Ew."
"If I've done the math correctly, somewhere around three-quarters of a million pounds," Sherlock replied.
"And yet you pine for her like some Byronic hero," Sherlock insisted.
John started coughing and Dillon led him away from the hall to John's office and into his own.
"His outfit is going to be made to match whatever you buy, so go off," one of the other women said, leaning on the counter with her elbows.
"That sounds lovely," Sherlock agreed. "Just name the place and time and I'll be there."
Greg lifted his head and leaned back in the chair. "You don't have to publish it, if you don't want to. But Sherlock, you said it yourself, you wanted to be a writer, not a publicist and marketer."
John blushed. "You were always better at seeing that sort of thing than I was, " he said, kissing her on the cheek. "Thanks for standing in for my mum."
Toby: Ouch. So is he one of the new characters in the sequels?
Mycroft's usually silver tongue decided that the best time to abandon him was when he needed it most. So he made shit up.
She waved her hand at him dismissively. "You knew what I meant, dear."
"What?" Mary screeched.
"See you then," John signed off.
"My sister is an alcoholic, I know what people look like when they are jonesing for a fix. Trust me, you display none of the signs."
Mike elbowed his new friend hard in the ribs.
"Of course," Sebastian said, rushing to assure him.
"I didn't tell who I was going to see, did I?" John asked.
Sherlock coughed and turned his head. "I'm not the man I was, Molly. It suited my purposes at the time."
Mycroft leveled his gaze at John and the doctor didn't falter for a second. Mycroft rolled his eyes. "Fine. When Sherlock was a teenager, our mother passed away. I was already finished with university by then, being Sherlock's elder by seven years, and had moved away. When she first passed on it seemed that our father was merely grieving. But he began to have people come over to the house. Mystics, mediums, shamans. All trying to communicate with our mother.
He was adding the sauce over the top of the finished ones, when John came stumbling out in his clean pajamas.
love me," Sherlock breathed.
So the present that John was sure Sherlock couldn't give turned out the be the perfect gift for them both.
"Okay," John began, after they had finished dinner on the third night. They had settled in to the library to play chess. "I have to ask, how did you and Mrs Hudson become so close?"
John gulped. He knew what that meant. "I-I thought Harry was coming home this weekend to take Mum to her appointments."
getting John's number before they parted.
"You talked about me?" Sherlock interrupted.
John tilted his ear up and then nodded. He could hear the pelting of the rain beating heavily on the roof and windows, but there wasn't a flash of light or even a low rumble.
"Not until after the first of the year," Sherlock muttered.
And now he was starting to worry that John might think he was avoiding the bookshop, and by extension, John himself.
"Welcome to Tegan's," she said with a grin. "I'm Tegan, me or any of my staff can help you out."
door. Well, almost. John was about to knock on this beautiful set of double doors when he heard some shuffling and muffled muttering coming from the other side.
Mike frowned, rubbing his arm.
"I mean, Irene," Sherlock growled, "that I make seven figures now, I head not one, but
"We can talk about it when we meet up at my house, all right?" Mike pressed.
"Yeah," Mycroft agreed, "What are we supposed to do with these?" He held up the bag.
Sherlock and John both jumped at the sound. John immediately turned to yell and curse at the driver. He chased the driver down the street a few feet before he waved his hand and came stomping back to Sherlock.
"That was before Sherlock kissed me," John explained.
Toby: He was always a self-insert.
"None whatsoever." Mycroft grinned evilly.
"Go."
"I know."
John trudged up the stairs, his sports bag draped over his shoulder. He kicked in the door to the sitting room with his foot, the door had only been partially closed. He threw his bag on the floor and kicked it viciously for good measure.
John kissed the inner thigh, "There's this bit. So tight and oh so toned. I'm so jealous of the legs on you."
They still got visitors, of course. Will would come most often after his father died and Molly became too ill to walk. Lily had outgrown their stories and had stopped visiting when she was but a teenager. Mycroft didn't live much longer than Greg, the stresses of his job put such a strain on his heart.
The next event was the couple's first dance, and Sherlock walked up to the front and cleared his throat.
He realized that he had been staring off into space when he noticed John shift nervously.
"It's not like that, Mummy," Sherlock insisted.
"Someone is eager," Sherlock whispered.
"You gorgeous thing, you," John purred into Sherlock's neck.
"It's John, right?" Sally asked and then turned to Sherlock with a look of 'Why are we talking to this person?'
"You never have been able to, you know?" Sherlock muttered leaning into John's touch like a cat.
drunk and throwing herself at random blokes. Would you get her somewhere safe? Somewhere where no one could take advantage of her?"
Sherlock shrugged. "Secondhand booksellers, auction sites, friends...who knows. But they get their little grubby paws on it, and they want to blast me for daring to write a gay love story."
John chuckled. "Have you met him?"
"Aww..." Jim drawled. "I'm beginning to think you don't like me." He gave Sherlock a wink.
Sherlock shrugged again.
"Tells you something about who you were marrying, doesn't it?" Mike said, with that same knowing smile from all those years ago when he declared, "Yeah, he's always like that," to a stunned John Watson.
"Made a mistake so costly that about two hundred and fifty to three hundred books need to be pulped," Sherlock replied wearily.
"Some lights, the kitchen; no internet, though," Sherlock replied, his shoulders hunching up around his ears.
Divya offered to take Molly home and the poor girl agreed.
Enjoy! (No cliffhanger this time)
She walked back to Greg, "Do you think we should help him?
The Mastiff more surprised than anything else came to dead stop. The man looked up and muttered, "John?"
Sherlock flopped in a nearby chair and looked at John, sizing him up. "You didn't make fun of my fear of thunder, so I guess I can trust you with this..."
John's smile turned sad and he lifted Sherlock's chin up. "Hey," he said and Sherlock couldn't help but look up. "It doesn't matter if there was no one before me, all that matters is that you'll never have to worry about it ever again, because I will always love you."
Also thanks to my beta, who is, as ever, my rock and very, very good at what she does. Old Ping Hai, you're the best.
"What you fussing for?" Tobias growled. "Either he brought a date and only wants to be friends; in which case it's better you know now anyway. Or he brought a friend for support because he's in love with you and is feeling too nervous to go it alone."
That wasn't even the worst of it. No, where Sherlock's jibes had been in defense of an unprovoked attack, these days he was on the offensive, turning his once silver tongue to barbs. John, himself, had rarely been the recipient, but when he was it was scathing. He was starting to wonder if he was going to have to give it all up as a loss.
When he came to, he was draped over the shoulder of an army medic. And if the boots were any indication, it was most likely Bill Murray, the combat nurse. The man had very large feet.
John rubbed his eyes and yawned. "Not really." He huffed out a sigh. "These new hires are going to kill me. I'm used to giving orders from my army days, but this training shit has got my patience down to my last nerve."
There were five people, two men and three women in the shop all wearing variations of the same outfit, black trousers, white button-up and comfortable shoes, so Anthea assumed that they were all employees. She briefly wondered if there was a Tegan or if she had been made up or was no longer part of the shop, but the next moment answered her question.
"Hot damn, can you show me how you did that?"
"John," Sherlock panted and arched into his touch.
"That's easy enough," John said, pointing to a large crowd of people that had Bertie in its center.
Sherlock stopped in the middle of laying out a couple of his suits when he saw John's hangdog expression. "Oh, for Christ's sake, John!" he huffed in frustration. "I'm going to be fine. I'll be too tired to do anything but crash after each performance."
"John," Sherlock breathed out like a sigh. They stumbled through the kitchen and into Sherlock's room, the remainder of their clothes leaving a trail behind them.
you two broke up."
"You make the most amazing sounds," the rugby player whispered into the other man's stomach. John settled between the dancer's thighs.
John missed this. The way her body moved in sync with his. He wanted her. Even after all she'd done he still wanted her. If she kissed him, he fall in love all over again. He knew he was a fool, that she really didn't care about him.
The problem with a house as large as the one the Holmes brothers lived in was that there were
John's head whipped up, "No, surely not..." he pointed to a curly-haired older gentleman with a straggly beard who was laughing with Bill.
Sherlock was stretched out on his bed, still in his bed clothes and in his thinking pose.
Sherlock let out a shuddering sigh. "Okay."
"Yes, do in get in the car, Victor. I'd make some kind of threat, but I'm sure you are aware of the danger you're in," Mycroft said, leaning forward so he could look up at Victor.
John's eyes went wide. "Wait, I've heard of you. Professors
"It will be expedited, of course. And I would give them access to the account until you get the card and swap the payment method. I suspect that what they want will barely put a dent in the interest. But still, take out the thousand for other things like food and rent."
Enjoy!
made me a deal," he replied. "If I make it through this year of school and pass all my exams, she'll let me play polo during my gap year. So here I am."
Enjoy!
"Maybe he was trying to get publicity for being the real-life inspiration for Ajay," Sherlock said, still reading through the thread. "Had the book been a success, it would have been a real feather in his cap. But only if people knew I wrote it."
Sherlock: That makes me sound like I'm twelve.
He shook so many hands that the faces began to blur together, so it came as a surprise when James hugged him.
He looked across the hall and smiled. Mike followed his gaze.
John waved his hand. "Don't worry about it, I'm just saying I'm gonna be the last person to mock anyone for being afraid of thunder."
"Hey."
As for the next story, it's supposed to be the Beauty and the Beast AU, but it has been a LONG time since I worked on it because I would say I have three or four chapters worth of world building material that is important to set up the story, but I haven't even got Sherlock yet. And usually with my fan fiction I don't have to do that sort of world building I can just into the meaty parts of the story. But I can't do that with this one and it has left me frustrated. And writing out of order has never worked well for me.
John grinned. He pulled Sherlock to his feet. The detective wobbled, but before he could fall, John caught him and scooped him up by the legs.
"Stay right here," John commanded and then got up.
"John!"
Sherlock shook his head. He pulled out his phone and did a couple of things on it before handing it to John.
detention, so there's that."
Sherlock shook his head, "She's fine, just frightened. That was the last straw for Lestrade, actually."
Sherlock's head rocked back. "Excuse me?"
John moved to the fully stocked kitchen, where he began to make them tea. Once it was through steeping, he added milk to his and sugar to Sherlock's. He sat down in the sitting room and settled to wait.
But just thinking about Sherlock made him feel frustrated. Not only had they never made it to lunch, John had missed a perfect opportunity in the summer, too. Sherlock had invited him to go sailing on his boat.
It wasn't until she had almost finished her first cup of coffee did she properly greet her boyfriend. "Morning, John," she said pecking him on the cheek. "Thank you for the coffee. You know I'm a beast without it."
going to prom, Mummy," Sherlock explained. "You see, he found this bloke who is perfect for him, which is perfect for me because⊷" he never got to finish that sentence, because Mycroft chose that moment to breeze past them, dressed to the nines.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist and drew him in close. "Their scrum line was as big as their props, so they ended up literally bowling you over."
is going to date Mycroft Holmes is if someone pays them. And I happen to have a bloke in mind," Mike explained.
"For fuck's sake, John, calm down," Mike hissed for what felt let the hundredth time since they sat down.
Everyone seemed oblivious to Sherlock's inner turmoil, everyone but James it seemed. He stepped forward.
Mike sighed. "Look, I get it. Most days he sets my teeth on edge, too. But he didn't used to be like this. He was a great kid when I first met him."
He laid down on his bed and pulled out his phone, dialing the one number he had memorized. He smiled when Sherlock picked up after the second ring.
So then the question becomes, what should I work on next? I have several ideas and this is your chance to chime in with what you'd like to see me do next. So post in the comments with which one of these stories you'd like to see after the author AU. They are all Johnlock.
"I don't think that you will be a topic of conversation tonight. Gregory and I have plans as well."
Anthea nodded and led John away as Mycroft answered the phone.
"Mary!" The words were out of John's mouth before he could stop them.
Greg was noticeably absent from the rest of his classes. Mike and John didn't even see him at lunch. By then it had spread throughout the whole school what had happened at prom and Mycroft's poem. John chuckled at some of the rumors that were flying around, but it was distressing that Greg had vanished. And worse, he wasn't taking anyone's calls.
"But it's the one Mummy gave me; if she sees me without it, I'll never hear the end of it," Sherlock defended.
"Oh dear," Mrs Holmes murmured. "We would have been, but there was this horrible accident that slowed everything down."
The corner of Greg's mouth tilted up, "Of course I do."
When Sherlock finally came up for air, he looked down at John, and there on his love's face what that expression that he had been trying to figure out. It was love. Pure, unadulterated love.
"Sherlock!" Mycroft protested.
John shook his head fondly and just patted Sherlock's leg as he passed. He decided a nice walk around Regent's Park would be good for him. He walked to the bank of the lake and watched the swans. He kept his distance, though. He knew better than to get close. Swans were beautiful but real bastards.
"I got the ice lollies you like," John said hopefully as he turned around and stopped. He finally took in his lover. Sherlock was wearing his robe and it seemed very little else. The robe sought the floor and the one side had slid off Sherlock's shoulder, revealing a "V" of pale skin, his nipple barely peeking from the swath of fabric.
Mycroft glared at their retreating backs. Someone passed by with a tray of drinks and Mycroft took one and gulped it down. The kid holding the tray cheered him on.
"Sir, it's Sally," she interrupted gently.
"That's good," John agreed. "I'll still probably stay in the library for sleep though."
John chuckled. "I'm sure there are less painful ways to befriend someone."
It was John's turn to scoff. "You do realize that sometimes cots were a luxury item in the army and sleeping on the ground was pretty much a given, don't you? And trust me, a level floor with lots of blankets and pillows is going to feel like a dream."
John stood up in a daze and walked out into the hall, and as he did so he brushed past a tough-looking bloke in a leather jacket and plain black backpack. John murmured his apology but the guy ignored him.
All round them Sherlock's friends and fellow dancers celebrated, Mike even joined in, but across the hall, standing in the shadows, there was one who was not pleased by this turn of events.
kid. "Mike told me that it was straight up hated. But to attack someone who is still a kid is monstrous."
"Until the end of days," Sherlock whispered when they came up for breath.
Bertie immediately jumped in and began cheering Mycroft on, joining the throng of other students chanting and cheering.
"Right, okay," John mumbled and then turned to scurry away.
John snorted. Now there was an understatement. John watched Murray for a moment before taking a deep breath. "And if I said, I didn't do jack shit, someone else did?"
John hung his head, "Nah, it's fine. That probably would have made him angrier."
"We can't chase criminals forever," he breathed.
John needed to have him closer, so he dragged the detective down to the floor with him. The soft moan that came from Sherlock was the most wonderful thing that he had every heard. It was so pure and yet so sensuous. John loved it. Loved him.
John held up a hand. "It's none of your business. I don't care if you're family of Sherlock's, on the board of directors for the Royal Ballet, or even the god damned British government, you don't get a say in who
Sherlock chuckled. "I know what you mean."
Sarah's expression softened. "You haven't heard from him?"
"I knew you would act this way," Sherlock snapped back. "I knew the second I saw
Mycroft furrowed his brow and cocked his head to the side, "So why don't you go back?"
John took a step forward.
"I don't believe that voicing one's opinion can be classified as a terrorist action," Mycroft argued.
Greg looked down at the three bags and then raised an eyebrow at his lover.
The young woman looked over her list. "I'm sorry, I don't see you here. Are you sure you made the reservation?"
He rounded on his brother, "Did you offer him money to, what's the phrase? Oh yes,
Until tomorrow! ;)
Sherlock let out a different kind of sigh. This one was a breath of resignation. "My meeting didn't go as well as I would have hoped."
Mycroft glared at him, hoping he would take the hint to go away. "It does its job."
"Did you give me his table?" he asked.
They exchanged boxes.
"Too late," Mycroft teased. "It's already gone to the printers."
Sherlock walked into his final meeting with M&M Prints, cocksure.
Once in the cab, Sherlock called Irene back. "I'm on my way, keep your knickers on."
The oldest of the lot, a woman with dark brown hair and warm, twinkling blue eyes spoke.
Sherlock laughed. "No." He grabbed her by the arms and looked her in the eye. "I don't need a best
Mycroft came around to Greg's side of the car, "What would that be?"
Mycroft raised a questioning eyebrow but didn't voice his disbelief out loud.
Hello, and happy early Valentine's Day. I was going to try and get another Valentine's Day story out like I did last year, but the flu is seriously kicking my ass. I swear I have gotten three different strains of the damn thing and all at the most inconvenient times. But at least I'll have an idea for next year.
Thanks to my beta Old Ping Hai who kept poking at me to finish it even when I despaired. I hope it is well worth the wait. The ending is much different then when I wrote it months ago. But better I think.
This pronunciation was greeted by sighs of relief from Mycroft and Molly, who had come out, too.
"My brother wouldn't know how to use a GPS if it bit him on the arse," the youngest sneered.
Thanks as always to my chief cheerleader, friend, and best beta on the planet, Old Ping Hai. Seriously though. If you guys liked this story, you should thank her, too. It would have never been finished without her.
John cleared his throat and lifted his chin, trying to choke back the tears that had threatened to fall.
"If I had, I would have stayed in London for the weekend!" Sherlock bellowed.
James grinned. He just patted John's good shoulder and moved on.
Peut-être que ç’est dans ton cul- Maybe it's up your ass
"You were marvelous," a warm voice murmured into John's ear.
"Oh," John breathed.
needed to know.
"What makes you more qualified?" Greg asked, when the silence stretched on for too long.
"I tutor Sherlock in French, and I could ask him what kind of things Mycroft likes and pass them on you."
Mycroft sighed. While his head was feeling much better, it still felt like he was walking through water some of the time. Though maybe that had more to do with the pain in his chest and not in his head. He had really thought that Greg liked him like that, and then to be rejected when Mycroft was in pain just made the whole thing a million times worse.
"Thank you for the clothes, Mr Holmes," John said earnestly. "I don't know what I would have done if I had to spend that week in the same kit."
"Well, well, well, if it isn't little Mikey," Bertie sneered.
"And of course we can't forget this beautiful thing," John rasped and took Sherlock's cock into his mouth. Sherlock jackknifed off the bed and curled his body around John, his hands gripping the rugby player's head, trying to grasp at the short strands, his leg still draped over John's shoulder.
"No," Sherlock growled. "A boy's room is private."
"You can have him," Sherlock assured her.
As Mycroft and Greg neared Mycroft's house, Mycroft became more aware of his surroundings and more lucid, but Greg kept checking on him out of the corner of his eye.
"Ah, and there is our Detective Inspector Lestrade," Sherlock smirked. "
I held on to this chapter in hopes of getting more people to vote. But alas, I only got three on both sites. So by the sheer fact there were so few votes, the winner is Curses! The beauty and the beast AU. Have no fear, I will get around to writing all of them, I just hope it won't take two years.
When the classroom door slammed shut, Greg coughed and discreetly wiped away his tears. He didn't even hear Mr Lyons call for their poems. He was struck by the raw emotion and that Mycroft had dared everything just so that he could hear it.
John and Sherlock shared a look and a feral grin spread over Sherlock's face. "Oh, yes, let's."
"Where do you think you're going?" she hissed just as Sherlock snarled, "Can't you just be normal?"
Apparently, he had a type.
Mrs Hudson laughed. "Bratwurst? Aren't we the optimist? Next time, keep it in your pants. Now, shoo!"
John showed up to the after party late because he was trying to make sure that Mary wouldn't do something stupid. He called her roommates and let them know what had happened. They didn't seem surprised. John had also called her brother, who was listed on her CV as emergency contact, and let him know what had happened. Again, he seemed more resigned than surprised. John thought briefly about calling the cops, but he didn't want her in trouble, he had just wanted to make sure she was okay.
"Oh goody!" Anthea fake enthused. "Something new for us."
"Mr Watson! Mr Holmes!" a booming voice cried from above them. "So good to see you at last. I was unfortunately out of town when the terrible incident occurred."
Sherlock just shrugged. "I grew up on dishes like this and I had the choice of learning to make it myself or hire a chef to get it wrong. I learned instead."
"What's it to you?" he asked instead, flicking away the butt.
"Brilliant," John said. "Where are the spare toothbrushes kept?"
"What!" Mycroft squawked.
A note of warning this chapter has a cliffhanger, so if you want to wait until the next one to read this one, I won't blame you.
"I wouldn't do that to him," John urged. "You know how much I respect the guy's work. It's just…" he broke into a grin, "can you imagine the look on that sour grapes Sally when it comes out I'm the real deal?"
"Figured out that for myself, thanks," John ground out.
"Right," Mike said after explaining what Greg said to the others, "I think Anthea and I should see to Mycroft and you and Sherlock should see to Greg, because you know Mycroft might not want to um...see Sherlock right now."
"Still she was your wife," John said.
The doorbell rang and Sarah went to answer the door. Poor Bobby was being pushed out of the way by the oncoming rush of his fellow students. She watched in horror as they set up a live DJ, filled coolers with ice and beer; plastic cups and paper plates made their appearance.
"Excuse me?" Mycroft asked. "Mr Lyons‒"
"You'll be okay," Molly said, putting her hand on her Sherlock's arm. He smiled wanly back.
Sherlock winked and went to do as he said.
"Thank you all for coming," he began. "Especially to the man of the hour, John Watson."
There was a small grumble of disappointment, but it seemed for the most part everyone was happy for them.
Mike held up his hands to show that they were empty. "Why would I want one of your stupid invitations?"
John chuckled, "Sounds about right. So that's what you did then, you asked Mycroft for the trust fund?"
John took a pillow and tossed it at him. Greg laughed and tossed it right back.
Molly turned to check herself in the mirror; she was wearing a deep blue, sleeveless tea-length dress that had a v-neck top gathered in the front and culminated with a matching flower. Her hair was pulled back away from her face and tied in a pretty bun. Her jewelry was minimal and her makeup light and airy.
Once they finished dinner, they walked around the city just taking in the sights of London and enjoying each other's company.
"He's just trying to look after you," Greg said.
"Was it just one shipment of a single book or were there several books in the order that were bound incorrectly?" Mycroft asked.
John shook head.
"Not at all," Mycroft said, glaring at Sherlock. "But I'm afraid something has come up and I am unable to make our meeting."
Sherlock frowned. "It was the biggest news piece for nearly six months ten years ago, you would have had to have been living under a rock not to have heard of 'Griffin's Steps'."
John looked round him as people milled about the small Westminster shop, more than there had ever been during the rest of the time it was open. But no matter how hard he scanned the crowd, the one person he wanted to see wasn't there. Yes, he knew that Sherlock had said he wouldn't be able to make it, but he still held out for a miracle that he would be here.
Finally they came up for breath.
"We've had conversations via text and over the phone about it, but he can't let it go. Though, when we are together he doesn't bring it up."
"If you want to meet him, there are other, better ways," Mycroft said with a chuckle.
"Dated a florist at uni," John replied.
suits to match the other groomsmen.
"It's okay, you aren't the first to make that mistake, and won't be the last."
Bertie stuck his hands in his pockets and slowly advanced on Mycroft, "Oh, I'll leave him alone, but I can't guarantee that he'll leave me alone."
"You could always ask Mycroft," Sherlock whispered. John had to strain to make sure he had heard him correctly.
"Separation anxiety?" she asked, stepping back.
Mike's smile became more confident, "Oh, I think you might want to hear what I have to say."
John raised his head and snapped, "I'm sure the two of you will be very happy together." He tried to shrug Sherlock off, but the publicist held on tighter.
"You berk, get up here and kiss me," John groused. Sherlock came up and did just that, the smile refusing to leave his face.
"What's another word for engorged?"
It was quiet a moment and John went to the sitting room. Sherlock looked up at him shyly.
But! I know that at least on the east coast of America, it is still Saturday and it still counts.
It had been a rough year for both Sherlock and John. With the mystery behind the video and all the fallout that came from that. The nasty encounter with Culverton Smith. And the disappearance of Mary after the death of her and John's daughter, Rosie. They had weathered it all and they were certainly far worse for the wear.
"Whoa," John said as Sherlock pulled him along. "What was all that about?"
"Four is better than thirteen," Mike teased. "But look in the fridge."
"Yep," Greg agreed, popping the "P". "If Ajay or Rhys had been female or if they both were, it wouldn't have gotten the hate it did. If it was written today, it would be a best-seller."
John sat back and looked up at him, "Hey, that's not in the this chapter. Let's do this right."
John bit his lip and forced down the barracks language that sprang to mind when she did this. He knew what she was attracted to. His confidence and swagger which, to be honest, John thought he'd lost. But with Sherlock Holmes, not only had he gotten it back, he had gotten it back in spades. And to a young woman like Mary, it must have been intoxicating.
Sherlock sighed happily. "Thank you for this, it has been a hell of a week, and I just needed to get away from it all for a bit."
Greg had relented and told him that he would find some juicy unsolved murders for him instead. That pleased Sherlock. Just then John had come down the stairs and Greg had turned around and invited John out for drinks.
"Incredible!" John breathed.
"This is underwear," Bertie explained, posing with his hands on his hips, head to the side, expression bland. "And this is swimwear." And as far as Sherlock could tell, there was no discernible change between the two.
"I was about eighteen when it was published," Sherlock began.
"We have an opening in..." she said, looking at her list. "In April."
This story just keeps growing and growing. But that is the final count, I swear.
"You'd be surprised," Sherlock said dryly.
?" John groused as Sherlock asked for aces, of which John had all three remaining.
He blinked a moment or two and then shivered. When his brain came back online it said in Mycroft's voice,
John had never worked with someone about his stories and could only remember all the times that he had heard about writers having to fight for scenes because the editor didn't think they were necessary to the plot. He set his cane in the crook of his elbow so that he could wipe his hands on his jeans.
"Ready, dearest?" John asked as he was nearing his own climax.
"I just need a minute, can I have that?" John snapped.
Sherlock: That's not what people usually say.
"Fair enough," John agreed. He looked out at the idyllic scenery and huffed out a breath, creating a cloud of steam next to Sherlock's exhale of smoke. "I want to apologize for Mary. She's not usually like this. We were expecting only five of us for skiing and merriment, not nine of us and everyone double or tripling up in the bedrooms."
They curled up on the sofa, and John whispered, "You know I'll never leave you, right?"
Murray adjusted his morphine drip and John slipped into the arms of Morpheus, dreaming of three brothers playing soldiers in the warmth of the afternoon sun.
"I hope you weren't waiting too long," Murray said.
," Sherlock deadpanned.
And of course at this moment Sherlock chose to interrupt with a shrill, "Did you really crash into Bertie's car?"
Major Watson grabbed John's arm and shook him, "Where the
"Please!" Sherlock begged. "I need you up here."
"I've been reading your book and it's marvelous, you did a really good job," James enthused.
The horse raised his head and nudged Mycroft's. Mycroft petted his horse's nose. "Quite right. Let's get out there, shall we?"
"You were hitting the cancel button again," John admonished. "One is red, the other is green. It's not that hard."
"Mate, please do my inner ear imbalance a favor and sit down," he pleaded.
"This is out of the way, and my brother has seen to it that this residence is outfitted with the best in security," Sherlock said.
"Sounds like a plan," Sherlock agreed. "It's a date."
"Hello, John." She smiled at him before shooting off a message on her Blackberry. "I've come to take you home."
"We won't want for anything for a really long time. And if we keep to the modest living we're used to, it will last us our whole lives," Sherlock murmured into John's shoulder.
"Of what?" John squawked.
"Where did you learn to cook?" he asked, leaning over John's shoulder to watch him work.
"This is all on you, Watson," Bertie goaded. "You and that cunt."
She giggled. "Oh, you say that now, John, but you'll come around." She tossed her hair over her shoulder. "Men
"Oh yes, his boyfriend was a real piece of work, too," Sherlock replied.
I hope wasn't too over the top. Until next time, dear readers.
A young woman came bounding over the bush, but skidded to a stop when she saw the scene in front of her.
"I let you out of my sight for two minutes and you catch my murderer by what, exactly? Tackling him to the ground?"
This one is a bit angsty at the end, just remember, happily ever after is always the end game with me.
"Now come here, watch his face," Mike directed. Sherlock walked out to stand by the door.
"Sherlock, it's gorgeous."
"I heard he ate a live raven once," Bertie said.
"Oh!" Sherlock breathed as John's lips found his nipple and he arched into the touch. John raised with him and trailed his hand down Sherlock's side to rest it on the dancer's hip. He moved to suck on the other nipple and Sherlock's gasp turned into a moan as he hit the bed.
Sherlock was more merciful than John as he quickly divested John of his trousers, revealing a lovely pair of red trunks.
Gregson looked at Sherlock briefly before he snapped his attention back to Moriarty. "What's this then?"
"What about you?" Greg said pointing at him, "You look absolutely fantastic."
The Seasons of the Beasts series
"You saw me, Murray, what kind of shape I was in when you found me?" John pressed. "Do you think I could have done what they claim I did?"
Mary whipped around, "David!" she hissed. "Not now!"
"It's nice to meet you, Miss Hooper," Sherlock said, his fake smile firmly in place. "I'm so glad you agreed to do my show. Are you familiar with the format?"
He took John's hand and led him away from the rundown warehouse.
"I don't care what she thinks about me, but I do care she's being rude to James. The bloke doesn't deserve her ire."
The first French lesson after the kiss, John thought, had gone well, but Sherlock seemed to be disappointed about something. John couldn't figure out where he'd gone wrong.
There were a few
So he knocked. On
"You could have used one of my bathrobes," John said, indicating the sheet with a nod of his head.
He whirled around. "Sherlock!"
"Good," John agreed. "I'll see you at the party."
"You're dead on your feet," Sherlock admonished.
here has experienced it at some point in their career, some might even still experience it. They just got better at hiding it," Mycroft explained.
By the time they finished the warm-ups, it had spread all through the building that Sherlock Holmes was honest-to-God, genuinely happy for the first time in years. Since....
John waited until Sherlock had dropped off in a doze on the sofa. John looked fondly at the sleeping figure. This mad man had done it again. Just like with his wedding, Sherlock had gone out of his way to make his Christmas perfect. And it was. Well, nearly.
Bertie sneered, "Maybe we should ask Mycroft."
John started to read and a hush descended on the shop, allowing him to weave his tale. When he stopped, there was a quiet, like the crowd was holding its collective breath, and then there was applause.
John looked behind him and twisted to grab the papers Sherlock was talking about. The top page was a census taken in 1860. Henry and Violet Watson, three boys, Harry, Albert and John. The second was a letter written by the army letting Violet know that Bertie had died and that John had been wounded and was being sent home, dated July 1880. The last piece was a faded photograph with two men in the 5th Northumberland regimentals. He looked closer and he could see the smiling face of Bertie Watson, his arm slung over the shoulder of the other man. A man that looked startling like the current John Watson.
"I'm not most people, John, in case you haven't noticed..." Sherlock trailed off as he looked up at John.
He was grabbing a serviette or two when a beautiful woman came up to him and stuck out her hand.
Sherlock looked at the outstretched hand with skepticism. "How are you going to get me up the steps?"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "That's unusual. He doesn't take on first-time authors as a rule. He must have really thought your book was something special."
"Stay here," Greg piped up. "I could take you to work with me; after all, we'd be going to the same place."
He knew John was right. But he didn't know how to even the score. He would have to do something so embarrassing that Mycroft would forget all about that disaster of a party.
"It's the only thing that makes sense, he framed one of his guests. Why else would the player not know he is the murderer?"
John and Mike shared horrified glances before they shook their heads.
John nodded. Yeah, he had this. Then he started shaking his head. No, no, no, no. He didn't have this. But before he could make a mad dash for the back room to never come out again, he got a text message.
"The reservation is at eight, so I'll need to pick you up at half seven," John explained as they made for the door. "Where can I pick you up?"
"Oh hell no," Mike snorted.
Sherlock blushed and began to poke at his breakfast. "What's on the agenda today?"
John looked around at the greyness that smothered London these days. Whatever snow they had gotten had either melted away or turned grey, if not out-and-out black.
"Wait!" Mr Lyons shouted but it was too late, Greg had already gone.
"I didn't mean to giggle, John," she pleaded. "It's just laugh or cry right now."
Sherlock scoffed. "I most assuredly do not need you, Shercroft is not in dire straits, and the Diogenes Print Club has already agreed to begin printing our books after the beginning of the year. I don't know where you got your information, but you should have done your own digging."
After the helicopter set down in London, they bid each other goodbye.
Mike turned to him and deadpanned, "Mediums."
Finally free of the girl, Greg turned to find Mycroft, but he was gone. Greg cursed.
Of course that went out the window the second Sherlock walked in. John leapt to his feet to greet the publicist. He had forgotten how good-looking the man was. He cut quite the figure in his designer suit and tousled curls. And John was standing before he even knew what happened.
With everyone's attention on the other newly enfiancéd couple, John mouthed "Thank you" to Mike, who nodded.
She sighed heavily again. "I don't do it to be malicious or hurtful," she explained. "I don't even charge for it, really. Sometimes they'll give me money or a small gift, but that's it, I swear."
John got on the train like he usually did, his rucksack slung over one shoulder, but strangely couldn't find his seat. He finally gave up and asked an attendant. The attendant led him to the first class cabin that he had all to himself. The attendant then told him that all food and drinks were included, to be charged to the tab of the mysterious Mr M Holmes.
"Now that's been taken care of," Mr Lyons continued, "who is brave enough to read theirs out loud?"
John clenched his fists and looked over at David. "And Sherlock isn't the one with the most blatant crush, Mary."
John laughed politely as Bertie dropped his arm from around Sally to focus on Sherlock. "Come on, we're all gathering around Culverton Smith. It's pretty awesome."
Mycroft shook his head, "You never give up do you?"
Sherlock cocked his head to the side. "Thank you for that," he said, dryly. "And bringing it up doesn't really help your cause."
Sherlock hadn't shown up, but John figured he'd be late in order to minimize the amount of time spent at the club.
"I was lecturing on rare diseases and Mike was there. He came up afterwards and asked me to drinks so he could ask me more in-depth questions. The rest is history."
Mrs Hudson just laughed. "John, you should feel flattered that she thinks you're so
John swallowed and then nodded. John had only ever focused on two things. Rugby and medicine. He just didn't bother with anything else. But his boyfriend was a completely different creature. Sherlock went after everything he wanted to learn with desire to perfect his knowledge of it.
"Married or..." John knew he should keep his mouth shut but he couldn't.
Sherlock wrung his hands as he paced back and forth. He should have gone with them. What if John found out how much was really in the account? Would he be angry, upset, thrilled? With John it was really hard to tell. John always surprised him.
"I did it on a lark," Sherlock said with a shrug. "My fencing teacher said I was too lazy to do anything with the sport, so I went out of my way to prove him wrong." He grimaced. There was a reason his fencing teacher thought that, but it wasn't anything
Mummy glared back at him. "Oh very funny, dear." She folded her hands on her lap and smiled. "So how was prom? Was it fun?"
I hate you so much it makes me sick
Thank you for all the lovely comments and kudos along the way. It made me really happy inside to see all the love this story got. Thanks again to indomitable Old Ping Hai, who helped me through when I got discouraged and Sidheman, whose brain I picked ruthlessly when I got stuck. You both are amazing and I adore you to pieces.
John was coming back from the shops when he heard the first shot. He ran up the stairs fearing the worst. While it wasn't death and destruction, it was Sherlock shooting at the walls, and that's bad enough.
"Hmm...?" Sherlock murmured. "Oh, yes. Apparently it was the combination of a couple things, people being idiots, and people thinking I'm an eccentric."
John's knees threatened to buckle. "I can't wait," he said, voice rough.
Sherlock was looking at his closet yet again. This time he had the sense to leave the clothes where they were, he hadn't enjoyed the clean up when he got back from tutoring John.
"Be sure that you do," she huffed and grabbed her purchase, strolling out of the store angrily.
Mike had also brought the satellite phone and the Yellowpages. After calling several mechanics, it was clear that they weren't going anywhere soon. Most of them were closed for the holiday and those who weren't, couldn't make it up the mountain until some of the snow had cleared, Monday at the earliest. It appeared that they were stuck until after Christmas.
"Yep, I had Mike and Molly help with the scan and then Brandon turned the scans into art." He snuggled in close to Sherlock. "You gave me your heart with that lovely proposal, and as literally as I could, I gave you mine. I love you so much."
"Yeah, sure," John replied, leading the way to his car.
Sherlock chuckled and moved his piece. He placed his head in his hand, one finger on his temple. "Another one of those things everyone knows, but you missed out by being overseas, I'd imagine."
Irene scoffed. "As if you have any design on my knickers."
Julie opened her mouth to squawk, but Barbara held up her hand. "I have given you too many chances as it is. Go."
"I was out at the pub but the other person bailed on me and I was wondering if you would like to join me for drinks instead?"
"All kidding aside, I just don't like doing what expected of me. Why go the ways others want me to go, when I can go my own way."
Greg watched Mycroft from the stable doors, leaning up against the frame with his shoulder, hands in his pockets, legs crossed at the ankles. Mycroft was brushing and saddling his polo horse and Greg was itching for a cigarette bad.
Sherlock finally looked up at John, a wide-eyed expression of wonder on his face. John thought his friend looked so adorable in that instant. Not that he would tell Sherlock that; the detective had an aversion to things that put him in a light that went against his cool facade.
"I want to be this John Watson fellow's editor," his husband insisted.
"I touched your arm when you stepped to your right and I could see her. She was screaming that I couldn't have you. But she vanished when I yelled for her to stop."
Mary rolled her eyes. "You want to talk about unprofessional, how about we talk about how you were quite obviously out all night and came in looking like you had had sex."
"Well, no, sir..." she conceded.
Toby: So who is he?
John got out of the car and closed both doors before heading for the boot. He pulled out their luggage. A large army duffle for him and a sleek leather overnight bag for Sherlock.
"Are you asking me out, James?" Sherlock began, a calculating smile on his face.
"Too loud," John reasoned.
Greg smiled. He had no intention of heading to detention again and nodded his agreement.
John chuckled. A bit like Sherlock.
John walked over to the cash box where Mary Morstan stood with the customer. Mary was a sweet-faced young woman in her early twenties. She had bright blue eyes and dyed blonde hair. She was studying to be a nurse and would be working nights once she was fully trained at the shop.
Damn it! John cursed in his head. Sherlock had invaded every corner of his mind. So much that he couldn't take a walk without thinking about the lean detective. He was about to give up and go back home, when crashing through a nearby bush came a large Mastiff with a long, blue scarf in its mouth.
When they got back to the stables, Mycroft was almost out of breath.
"I hate parties," he growled.
"Hey," John said, cupping Sherlock's cheek and gently moving his head so John could see the expression on its face clearly. "Did you think I brought someone else?"
Mycroft scoffed, "The only thing people 'know' about me is that I'm 'scary'." He used air quotes around know and scary. "My own mother wishes I was someone else."
