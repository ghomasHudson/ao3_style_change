rather like them - Sherlock needed so much more than he let on to people. People except John. He needed John to take the lead in all the emotional spaces he had been so afraid to occupy for so long and, yes, sometimes it felt almost dangerous, even to John. To love a person so much. To choose to be with someone who excited and infuriated and cared for and protected and baffled him at every turn. And made him want to do the same.
“It’s not a risk for
“Who is this person?” Detective Gregson asked, clearly affronted at Sherlock’s presence. Where was Lestrade? Where was Mycroft? Who was this Gregson to question Sherlock’s being at the crime scene?
It was electric. Neurons lit in Sherlock’s mind like fireworks and he met John’s fervour with a rough growl, gripping the hem of John’s waistcoat and pulling him harder against himself. Loathe though he was to admit such a thing, he had missed this. Kissing John was an experience unlike any other; he kissed with such determination and confidence and Sherlock had forgotten the shaky feeling it brought to his knees. It was good, God, it was good.
"What on earth is that sound?"
"No, John, stop," he murmured, pulling his head to the side to quell his husband's kissing. John would not be put off so easily - he licked up the side of Sherlock's neck and elicited a positively sinful sound. "
," Sherlock panted. "Of co-course not, Captain."
His. That was the word. For the moment.
I'm so glad folks have taken to this story - I'm having such a fun time writing it and your notes of praise literally give me life. Always open to suggestions and edits. Love and Happy Christmas!
Also, I should probably mention the unbelievable inspiration that is illwick's "Unwind" series here on AO3. While nothing I write is an intense in regard to a BDSM relationship, I am constantly enthralled by their deep, inward characterisation of John and Sherlock both. I couldn't recommend this series any more highly. The detail involved regarding John's journey to come to terms with his sexuality, as well as Sherlock's storied past, is definitely in the back of my mind when I write this story. I hope that if illwick ever reads this comment, they will regard this as the compliment for which it is intended.
His brief panic subsided quickly as Sherlock popped back up like a gopher. Sherlock waved to John and they met at the gate of the park. In his hand, Sherlock held a slip of torn paper with very little writing on it, but he looked absolutely ecstatic. “Another woman, John. Still alive,” he answered John’s unasked question. “This is her corner. She wants to talk about the man they call Jack.”
“Cheaper than buying her off.”
Running the crop against the other cheek and down to trace Sherlock's full lips, John watched as that long, pale throat swallowed excitedly. With a sharper
…" Sherlock breathed against his lips, but John undulated his hips again, this time managing to press the bulges of their cocks together. "
There was a thought.
"Molly plays it all the time," he answered with a flip of his elegant hand. "Apparently, it's from some film she quite likes about colour schemes or something."
His teeth sank into Sherlock's shoulder as he arched impossibly further back into John's embrace. John twisted his firm grip on Sherlock's erection and ran his thumb over the swollen head just before Sherlock came with surprising force. John did not relent, milking Sherlock's erection for all he was worth as his own orgasm bulleted through his body and into his husband.
across the face. "Don't be so cheeky, dear." Then John leaned forward and delved his tongue into Sherlock's willing mouth. His tongue rolled over Sherlock's, further asserting his ownership, and tasting his own sweat and pre-cum. Finally, he spoke into Sherlock's open mouth, "But yes. Twice." He kissed him again, deep and swift, running his thumbs over the lovely red welts on Sherlock’s face. "God, I wish I could stretch you out - fill you with a plug and make you wear it til we get home." Sherlock gulped and his eyes widened slightly. "But I'm not going to do that - not here. You're mine - not for anyone else to gawk at." Another kiss, Sherlock surrendering his mouth with a soft moan. "And I don't usually carry anal plugs with me, anyway."
“Sherlock? What’s wrong? Is Rosie –”
and John took a sharp breath through his nose. Sherlock's expression calmed as he recognised the apology on John's face. "Sherlock, I - I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to -"
meeting her – not you?”
“John,” he said softly and John’s skin tingled at the almost tender sound of his name on Sherlock’s deep voice. “You have to know that I would never purposefully do anything to harm Rosie. Or you.” This last he said making the most open and sincere eye contact with John he had ever seen on that slim, sharp face. He had a sudden urge to put his hand on Sherlock’s pained face, but he shook it off.
The bartender took the photo and gave it a good look, but shook her head, raising one pierced eyebrow in an apologetic expression. "Sorry, love. I don't think I've ever seen him." John took the photo and reached for his wallet, but the woman waved him off. "Don't worry about it - I hope you find your man." John nodded his thanks and took a sip of his whiskey. The bartender winked at him and said, "Try to have some fun while you're here, Daddy."
Over an hour later, the car pulled to a stop in Whitechapel and Julia slid out onto the sidewalk. No sooner had she exited the vehicle did Sherlock retract his hand and his affectionate behaviour. John got out behind Julia to speak to her before she got too far down the street. “Hey – thanks so much for your help.”
(See the end of the chapter for
, Lestrade!” Sherlock snapped. He whipped out his wallet and handed over his Coutts Silk Card. Lestrade’s eyes widened at the sight of it and he reached out as if for the Holy Grail. “Put them all up in a hotel - high security - until the case is settled.”
?” Rosie whined. “I like when he makes the chair flip back!”
“You’re going home to ice and elevate that ankle,” John replied. When Sherlock made to argue, he pressed on with full military authority. “Now.”
"A remote?" It was a single button, no larger than John's thumb, and suddenly he remembered what it was for. "Ooh, you
The bar was in his prescribed pathway, so he took out the photo of their missing person from his coat pocket and headed toward the line of people vying for drinks. He didn't see the victim in the crowd, so he pushed his way to the bar and flagged down the woman serving. She was wearing a tighter-than-tight black leather dress that barely passed her buttocks.
"Know a lot about cocks, d'you?" John slurred around another chuckle. Sherlock crossed his arms and his pouty mouth curved into a very serious frown. "Alright, alright," John waved his hands apologetically, "tell me about the -
Then John remembered.
Well this only took forever, didn't it? This chapter feels a bit short and it's been so long since I wrote anything, but I'm finally back to it. Now that school has been cancelled for the rest of the term, I'm hoping to get back in the habit of writing every day like I did before I started teaching. Wish me luck and send all your good vibes to break through the muddiness of my ADHD-induced writer's block.
“I was planning on it,” John answered as Sherlock dashed across the road and took a running leap over the wrought-iron fencing of the park using a parking meter for leverage. This daredevil-ish action elicited a squeal of delight from Rosie and John couldn’t help but smile at the sight of Sherlock, so excited and energized. He landed in the shrubbery and ducked down until John lost sight of him. That made John uneasy – he liked to always have eyes on Sherlock, just in case. But with Rosie in-hand, he could hardly go running after him.
“Byron?”
“So you’ve said,” John muttered, rolling onto his back and throwing an arm across his eyes, attempting to lower his heart rate. “What don’t you like?”
John’s eyebrows climbed nearly up to his hairline as he stared at the darkened neon signs which read, “Adult Video ‒ Peep Show.”
"You're welcome," John replied, finding himself staring at Sherlock. He had put on weight - that was funny. Just a pound or two, but right in the tummy. That would be the result of Rosie's baking lessons with Molly. Sherlock was always eager to critique her latest creation, which made John happy because parenthood had not repaired Sherlock's incredibly uneven eating schedule and food was food.
“Close your mouth, John,” Sherlock said casually over the thumping music. “You look like a surprised carp.”
Still, John had let his mind wander. "Sorry, love."
“’He’?” Lestrade repeated. “You mean ‘she’.” He pointed down to the dead woman, but Sherlock shook his head.
Sherlock did not back down. “You were out unseemly late with a strange woman, one who obviously has less-than-honourable intentions with you, given her shameless enthusiasm to be alone with you.”
John grabbed Sherlock roughly by the lapels and threw him against the narrow stretch of wall beside the door with a snarl. “I am so tired of hearing about the bloody Work!” He gave the taller man a violent shake and Sherlock shoved him back, but John’s grip was relentless. “The case is over, Sherlock! What’s your excuse now?”
John swiftly redid his trousers and gestured for Sherlock to stand. Jackets replaced, they both smoothed their clothes and regained their composure. But when Sherlock made to leave, his movements forced the plug, still pulsing, to shift inside his body and he threw out a hand to John. He sucked in a hissing breath, squeezing John's fingers, before finally managing to compose himself. Sherlock threw his shoulders back and walked as properly as possible toward the door, though John grinned to see him walking almost with a limp.

"Which is it today -- morphine or cocaine?"
1) “I am in the West.” Meaning, “I’m all out of sorts today.”
“Not in the least.”
Breaking the stunned silence, John said to Anderson, “I think you’d better go.” Anderson nodded – as much as he did not care for Sherlock, he had developed a certain amount of respect that Donovan did not yet share. Taking up the small box of photos and notes they had already collected, Anderson took Donovan by the elbow and led her out into the stairwell. He shot John a slightly-apologetic look before Sherlock slammed the door in his face.
sprained. You landed directly on your ankle bone – you’re lucky.”
“Obviously.” He settled into his seat and stared excitedly out the window. As the car took off, John felt a jostle against his knee and looked down. Sherlock’s leg was bouncing wildly, brushing against John’s with every movement. Suddenly, Sherlock clapped his hand down onto John’s knee, nearly causing his heart to stop. “John!” Why did he always say John’s name? No matter what he was thinking or feeling, he
“I know, love,” John said, putting up a hand. Sherlock fell silent as John straightened his shoulders and drew himself up to his fullest height. Despite his smaller stature, John could be very imposing when he wanted to. Tightening his jaw and narrowing his eyes, John put on his Captain voice. “If you so much as look at my husband again, I will make you regret having drawn breath this morning.” The man took a moment to size John up, then decided against an altercation. He put up his hands in surrender and walked away.
Sherlock's cheek lifted in that beautiful, smug, smile and he said no more about it. "John, would you  change the radio station? I can't stand to listen to
“Oh, I get the fancy treatment, then?” They smiled together and John was amazed at the ease he felt around her. But then, he supposed, that was her job. She was rather… well, rather classier than he had expected. He’d never solicited a prostitute before but he had encountered his fair share working with Sherlock and the Yard and they were never so sweet and healthy-looking. They reached the car and John opened the door for Julia and she slid smoothly inside before John heard her exclaim at the sight of Sherlock in the car. “What’s going on? Who are you?”
. Deep crimson against stark white. Beautiful in its own way. Reassuring - he was still alive.
“No, no – just a, ah, a sale at Waterstone’s. Much more my speed.” John pocketed his mobile and resumed leading the way. “I’ve got a car waiting on the corner.”
Sherlock's shiver was visible as John adjusted his grip on the handle, his fingers coiling deliciously around the smooth leather. John took the few remaining steps to close the distance between them, staring up at Sherlock with their chests almost touching. Sherlock's pupils were blown wide and John could feel the bass of the club music vibrating between them. His voice firm and even, John said, "Now, Sherlock - we came here on a case. I'm sure you're miles ahead by now, so just tell me: is there anything important? Anything we should take care of before we continue here?"
a clever boy, aren't you?" John ran the pad of his thumb tantalizingly over the button and Sherlock's eyes followed his movements. "You just walk around with a vibrating plug up your arse now, do you?"
“And the humility, apparently.” Sherlock removed his hand from John’s knee as he took up his phone again and John bit his lip at the loss.
“Man’s got to make a living.”
Sherlock turned in John's embrace and he looked down with a little less ire than before. "Did you enjoy your night out with Lestrade and Stamford?"
That was it. John decided right then that he wanted Sherlock's cock in his hand - in his mouth - sucking him with far more enthusiasm than Sherlock was giving to his fingers. Reaching down, he undid his safety belt and shifted in his seat so that he could reach Sherlock’s fly with his left hand.
“This doesn’t seem terribly safe, doctor,” Sherlock said, his voice having dropped lusciously.
"Cocktease." Another bubbling laugh fell from his lips, but Sherlock waved it off as he spun around the cabinets.
"Arthur." Double bastard. That was adorable. John tried to disguise his grin by turning his head and pursing his lips. "You approve?"
“I suppose you have.”
Really, he had wasted so much time pretending to be completely straight. Anyway, the soundtrack contained so many examples of glam rock that were not David Bowie, and John needed to see if it were the genre or the artist that Sherlock was responding to.
For a dog, he was surprisingly empathetic. When Sherlock was sad and illogically missing home, he placed his silky chestnut head on Sherlock’s knee and simply waited. When he was angry, Redbeard goaded him into a game of tug-of-war. He gave chase when Sherlock couldn’t sleep, he cuddled when Sherlock couldn’t get up, and he listened with an intrigued tilt of the head when Sherlock had an idea. And he watched diligently with his head resting over Sherlock’s heart the first time he had been compelled to test his transport on cocaine.
John snorted. “Could you not do that?”
The word sent a jolt straight to John's groin. He breathed heavily through his nose as Sherlock sank to his knees in front of John, keeping their gaze locked. God, this man. John could never find the right word for him. Fantastic. Genius. Incredible. Gorgeous. Miraculous. His.
Sherlock.
John raised an eyebrow. "Excuse me?" Her eyes raked over his conservative outfit and she smiled salaciously.
Sherlock instantly took a step behind John as he faced off with the stranger. “What the fuck are you doing?”
So, I'd like to break out of my own box a little bit here as ask for suggestions. I have an overall structure for this fic going forward, thanks to watsonshoneybee's original prompt, but I'd love to know what else my fantastic readers would like to see. Characters? Situations? Quotes? Headcanons? I don't usually ask for suggestions like this because I don't like to let anybody down, but I've really enjoyed all the input on this story. So keep it coming!
“Where are you going?” John twitched as though he were about to reach for Sherlock but thought better of it. Sherlock grabbed his coat from the peg and swept it over his shoulders.
“Who could
He especially didn’t like it when the man gripped the back of Sherlock’s neck and shoved his tongue down his throat. John leapt to his feet and dropped his empty glass on the thick carpet. Before he even realized it, he was marching across the dance floor and had pulled a very shocked Sherlock away from his assailant.
He glanced back down at the covered corpse and a hideous though occurred to him. “She was pregnant.” When he caught Sherlock’s eye again, the detective nodded solemnly.
"Fuck off."
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ve heard enough – this ends now.” John’s eyebrows were high and stern on his face as he held up a warning finger to his daughter. “You are staying here with Aunt Molly until Sherlock and I come collect you tomorrow morning.”
“You know that the Work comes first‒”
killer, Daddy?”
“No worries, we still have time.” Sherlock was on his mobile when John returned to the car. As he slid into the back seat, the detective continued, “Because that woman’s already dead, Lestrade, and so far we have no reason to suspect he will kill again right away. Now, listen, you know I don’t –” Sherlock’s voice cut off suddenly and John looked over to see those mercurial grey eyes studying him. “Lestrade, I’ll text you later.” He abruptly hung up and stared intently at John. “You’re upset.”
He’s got better things to do now, anyway.
"Sounds good."
“I suppose that’s when our friend Brook got involved,” Sherlock said. “The fireman said it was Brook who paid him to move the dead body and ‒” he paused for dramatic effect as he reached across the table to grab an official-looking packet of papers, “Brook is on the list of founding members of Janus Enterprises.” He plopped the business formation paperwork in front of John with a satisfied grin.”

you shoot him?”
“Yes, in my time it’s referred to as a shell corporation,” he confirmed. “It only exists on paper ‒ no employees, no office ‒ used only to move money from one person or enterprise to another without any direct contact between the two. The name Janus should have been a dead giveaway, honestly.”
going on. “But… when one has eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Right?” He stared up at John expectantly.
The doctor met him at the stairs, panic in his eyes. Mrs. Hudson was gone – that was good.
“I don’t care to speak to you any more ‒ where is Lestrade?”
“Well, I call it fear. Old age. Complacency,” Sherlock spat out the words as if they had an unpleasant taste. His legs bounced up and down and his fingers danced on the armrest of his chair. John tried to swallow the little smile that arose at the sight of him.
What an unbelievable drama queen.
“Do you think I could convince her to change it to ‘Pater’?”
"Who is that?"
John started after him, calling out, “Foot’s feeling better, then?”
It had started in the kitchen. Two days into being Papa, Sherlock was practically high on fatherhood. He carried Rosie everywhere, despite her ability to walk for more than two years. He hummed that frustrating song John had learned in grade seven that listed all the elements (John preferred the original
John shifted on the sofa, almost uncomfortable under Sherlock’s odd scrutiny. He cleared his throat before saying, “Erm… I know you’ve got a brother, and going by the way you talk about him ‒ which isn’t much ‒ I’d say you don’t care for him at all.” Sherlock scoffed and the corner of John’s mouth lifted in a small smile. He went on, “Your birthday is January sixth ‒”
“I like that one!” John replied, returning the mouse-printed garment to the drawer and searching for another.
"Leave them, I have extras. I'll do it later." Git.
John blinked at him in more confusion. “What for? Do – do you think this upsets me?”
“You look rather good in that vest.” He winked slyly at John before walking away without another syllable. John slid unsteadily down the ladder until his feet hit the floor and he took a moment to steady his breathing. He straightened the aforementioned garment before squaring his shoulders and returning to work, absolutely not thinking about shagging Sherlock senseless against the shelves after hours.
"Irene Adler, professionally known as The Woman."
Their investigation had taken an unexpected turn when their missing person's neighbor confessed to a casual sexual relationship. This wouldn't be anything too out of the ordinary, except that the two of them frequented a special members-only club in Brixton, where John and Sherlock found themselves staring out onto a sea of writhing flesh and leather.
Standing with a slight grimace, Sherlock redressed and ran his fingers through his hair, smoothing out his appearance. He licked his lips, swallowed slowly, and blew out a breath through pursed lips. The Detective was back.
John instantly felt his cheeks redden. "Oh, um… just, playing a little air guitar, I guess." He tucked his hands between his knees and pulled his lower lip inward, trying to abate his embarrassment.
After about two blocks, a sleek black towncar slowed to a halt and Sherlock threw the door open. He held it and waited for John to get in before sliding in himself. “Mycroft?” John asked, looking about the car’s nondescript interior.
He was thoroughly spent, but Sherlock was not, and John left him wanting for less than a second before sliding out of Sherlock and crawling down his body to take him in his mouth. His fingers slipped back into Sherlock and pressed firmly against his prostate and it took only a few short moments before Sherlock moaned deep in his chest. The rumbling timbre of his voice vibrated through his thighs and around John’s ears as he drank his lover in. At last, John let his head fall to the side, resting comfortably against Sherlock’s thigh as he caught his breath. He planted a lazy kiss there and Sherlock’s fingers wound their way lovingly into John’s hair.
"There's nothing wrong with that, Sherlock --"
(See the end of the chapter for
Of course, Sherlock led. He wrapped one arm unabashedly around John’s waist and took his right hand in his left. He stepped forward with his left foot and John hesitantly followed with his right. They stepped out to John’s left, and closed the step with a half-turn to John’s right. The next step was a mirror to the first, then started over from the beginning; after a few measures of string quartet music, John felt that he could at least manage to follow Sherlock’s lead.
“We broke in to a complete stranger’s flat,” John said, adrenaline catching up to him and causing him to grin a little with nervous energy. “I don’t know that our own crime constitutes a position of self-defence.” At that moment, Thompson passed out from the pain. John knelt again to ensure that he was still in no danger of dying.
“Sherlock,” John warned. The detective sighed, exhausted at always having to accommodate the laypeople around him.
“Good God,” John groaned, flopping back onto the sofa. “Sherlock,
and took up his chair to observe Sherlock's reaction.
“No,” he answered. “Identical drinks, identical poisons. One killer, two targets, only one victim,” Sherlock recited. “The ice. The ice was poisoned and set aside for these two men. Dodds had three drinks, went through them rather quickly, too, I’d imagine. No time for the ice to melt. Crewe, however, nursed his one drink for a couple of hours and drank not only the whiskey, but the poisoned ice water mixed in. Dodds left the ice in his glass, which has since melted, and now presents a slight scent of garlic where Crewe’s does not.”
Man, has it been a while since I updated. Sorry everyone. :/ Life, you know? I've been submitting book queries and preparing for a job interview, so cross your fingers and send all the good thoughts. In order to sublimate my anxiety while I wait to hear about the job, I shall dive right back into writing. Huzzah!
Dropping his glass down in front of him, she said, "You a cop?"
John huffed a little laugh and looked about the room in disbelief. “It’s a crime scene, you maniac!”
The waltz ended and John found himself wondering with growing disappointment if Sherlock would abandon his dancing experiment, but grinned when he was steered into another dance he didn’t know. It was quite possibly the most openly-homosexual activity in which John had ever engaged. He didn’t care. This was Sherlock and Sherlock was the exception to just about every rule. John smiled and sighed and rested his head against Sherlock’s shoulder; he was at just the right height to press his cheek to Sherlock’s clavicle and feel his pulse next to his ear. Sherlock surprised him and planted a swift kiss to the top of John’s head before resuming his observations.
“Will that be all?” Sherlock stood impatiently from the chair in front of Lestrade’s desk. The little wobble on his still-sore ankle diminished the effect of this gesture, but Rosie reached up to take his hand and he steadied. “We have places to be.”
“Yes, I think you killed him with the…” she pointed her finger and thumb at him like a gun.
"You think you're such a machine, Sherlock, but I swear, you're one of the most emotional people I've ever met! You just don't know how to express or handle your feelings and for more than thirty years, people have been insisting that you're incapable of emoting. You may struggle with empathy, sure, but you feel too much, not too little."
He was right. He was always right eventually. And, Sherlock begrudgingly admitted to himself, he was right with John’s help.
Silently, Sherlock reached out and slammed the door shut before John even had time to be embarrassed. Taking a steadying breath, John squared his shoulders and marched into the store. He had
I honestly can't remember if I updated last week or not. Hubby and I are out of town, but this story has proven to be an exercise in writing commitment. It feels pretty good to stay (mostly) on track.
John was left staring at the open doorway, his own coat in his hand. What on earth…? Sherlock only occasionally spoke French when he wasn't speaking to a French person. Sometimes he did it when they were having sex and John found it incredibly erotic. But this was different - as if he couldn't be bothered to speak English today.
“Harry’s short for Harriet.”
"… Ravenclaw, the clever ones --"
“Yes,” Sherlock said, jumping on the thought, “yes it is. What sort of ethnic food is available around here?”
Holy shit, you guys! I cannot believe how many comments this little fic got after just one night! Each and every comment and kudos and visit just makes my little heart soar, so thank you all so much!
“Yes she has.” John rocked back on his heels with obvious satisfaction before tucking the card into the breast pocket of his tweed jacket. “Wants to have dinner.”
“You always guess the ballroom.”
“No, I didn’t!” Sherlock exclaimed, affronted. “John, I didn’t-”
“John,” he said, his tone very insistent, “you are the best father – the best man – Rosie could ever ask for.” John hated when people said things like that to him. If only they knew – knew how angry he felt sometimes, that Mary was gone, what she had done; how the world looked at him and saw such a small, quiet doctor; how much he
John was conducting an experiment.
“You could always punch me again – make it look like a struggle.” Sherlock couldn’t help the grin that spread over his own face.
“Yes, and he’d very much like us to stop shooting people without a police presence.”
So John decided to test individual genres, starting with glam rock.
Not like he usually danced, unknowingly around the room as he was lost in thought. This was
John stopped, now on the stair above Sherlock. His face went through several expressions in rapid sequence, Sherlock soaking up each one.
“I said,” Sherlock repeated firmly, “he’s with me.” A shiver ran down John’s spine at Sherlock’s commanding tone.
John’s entire body tensed as he listened. Sherlock’s eyes widened slightly as he observed John before their gazes met in the pale silver light of the moon.
"What?"
Sherlock hummed as John’s lips traced their way up to that painfully-sharp jawbone and said, “It’ll keep.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and John smirked. It made Sherlock happy when John was clever. Luckily for Sherlock, John was often clever - more clever than people assumed, which was ridiculous on their parts. John was quite possibly one of the cleverest men Sherlock had ever had the pleasure to know.
Sherlock's eyebrow twitched. John knew that expression. He was hiding something.
“You’re not as recognizable.”
Sherlock turned, apparently surprised, to look out of his window, but he spun back around to look at John after a moment. “Do you think so?”
“No,” John said emphatically, picking up the remote and quickly turning off the telly.
“Detective Gregson works for New Scotland Yard,” Watson explained calmly. “Don’t worry about any of that now ‒ we’ll be at Bart’s in no time.”
Sherlock sighed a sleepy sigh and, eyes still closed, replied, "I told you, John. It is about us - it doesn't merely 'remind' me. I texted her to ask her how she knew so much about it… about how I feel about you."
It couldn’t have been ten minutes in before Sherlock said around a mouthful of chicken and rice, “So that Irish fellow, he’s the villain?”
“Too right you did.”
So now that we've started to get a bit of a routine (and I've figured out ways to hold a baby and still use my hands), hopefully, some more updates will be on the horizon. I beg for patience, but also for constructive criticism.
With an imperious huff, Sherlock said, “I’m sure he does.”
“What do you think?” Sherlock gestured calmly down at the man as though he routinely came upon mysterious crime scenes in bars. John supposed he probably did.
“How did –”
John’s words rang out in the sitting room. Even Rosie was quiet. Even
?” John insisted, starting past the slim detective.
"It's fine." Sherlock was back to work, fully-focused. After a moment, John heard something he had never heard before.
He threw his hands out onto the bed to keep his face from hitting the floor and John pulled his head back by his hair. "Don't you
With a sigh, he held up a hand and said, “Don’t… don’t say that.”
. John took a deep breath through his nose and stood slowly, glad that he wasn’t quite hard enough to show yet, but seriously regretting that he hadn’t just gone ahead and had that wank in the shower earlier. Their run had rather worked him up ‒ the blood pumping through his veins, the friction of his pants against his cock, Sherlock covered in sweat and barely-hanging on cotton trousers had nearly done him in, but he didn’t want to hog the shower. Now, he wished he had because contrary to everything John had ever known about sexual attraction, Sherlock somehow looked immensely better with
Still slightly dazed, Sherlock said, “Alright.” Bart’s was good ‒ he knew the hospital like the back of his hand. He would be safe there from all this confusion. He did not care for confusion.
"… Hufflepuff…"
“Sherlock,” Mycroft whispered, his voice resigned and tired, “have you made a list?” Sherlock tried to answer, but found that his voice was being held down by the pain in his stomach. His fingers fumbled in his trouser pocket and managed to extract the small bit of paper. It fell from his grasp as another wave of sobs took him over.
“Stop right there.” John grabbed Sherlock by the upper arms and spun him until they were facing each other. “You did the right thing. If you’re going to be Rosie’s ‘Papa’, you have to put her first. Always. And you did that without hesitation.”  John paused for a brief moment, but eventually decided to voice his feelings. “I’m… proud of you, Sherlock. You did good.”
Sherlock moaned, open-mouthed and hot, against John's shaft before taking the whole of his length into his throat. His head thrown back in ecstasy, John snapped the crop down again, this time on Sherlock's other cheek. The detective moaned richly around Johns cock before he took a deep breath through his nose and swallowed, the muscles of his throat rippling up and down John's prick.
“What, can’t you work that out?” the man sneered. “You’re supposed to be so smart, aren’t you, Mister Holmes?”
“Sherlock it is, then. You can call me John, if you like.” Watson ‒ John ‒ added another careful stitch to the side of Sherlock’s head.
“Hmm.” Sherlock drummed his fingertips together. “Dodds had three, Crewe had one… But why Crewe and not Dodds?”
.” Sherlock said the name as if it were a curse word.
"Sherlock?" John sat forward and spoke into his husband's ear. He didn't answer, merely sighed and worked his jaw with arousal. "Sherlock."
"I know," Sherlock said, almost confused, as he sat up on the couch and stared over at John. "My mind seems strangely clear." He stood and straightened his shirt before leaning down to give John a swift peck on the lips. "Let's go and tell Lestrade."
-ed a quiet laugh.
It was, in fact, very similar to an experiment John had conducted in grade four, the objective of which was to determine if soybeans would grow at different rates when exposed to different genres of music. Sherlock did not need to grow any more and, in fact, John wished he wouldn’t. He was currently the perfect height. But he did have a very interesting reaction to different genres of music and John was very keen on his observations of the dressing gown-clad bean-pole in their sitting room.
There’s always something.” John chuckled again.
Sherlock's head began to nod casually as he worked and the furrow between his brows softened. "This is a much better group, John, thank you." John smirked into his newspaper.
“Sherlock, keep your voice down,” John said, waving his hands in a lowering sort of gesture. Looking out the window to the darkened street, John continued, “What time is it, anyway?”
Sherlock withdrew his arm and ran his hand along the back of his neck, still not looking up. "No," he said slowly.
(See the end of the chapter for
2) “You are breaking my feet.” Meaning, “You are getting on my nerves.”
"Wassamatter?" John hadn't intended to slur quite so badly that time. But his arousal was intensifying the mottling of his intoxicated tongue and it was the most pleasant floating feeling. Orgasm would be better, though. Why was Sherlock upset?
Now it was Sherlock’s turn to fix John with an intimidating stare. He smiled, slow and sinister, as he brought the details he had taken in about Sarah Sawyer to the front of his mind. Nice clothes, but at least two years old; repaired twice at the hem and once at the elbow. Traces of greying hair at the temple, minimal makeup. Letter in hand stamped from Norwich, likely family.
“It’s best not to cross Mummy.” They left it at that and John felt his cheeks lift the littlest bit at the notion of Sherlock as a “momma’s boy”.
John was dumbfounded. “How can you
’. I was investigating this body and searching for the killer when ‒”
Through an exasperated smile, John replied, “Well, it’s better than the alternative. It isn’t broken.”
“‘Pretty smart’?”
“It was
“This is his flat,” the man replied as if this were evidence enough.
True to his nature, John felt guilty that he was so distrusting of Sherlock’s mood. He was happy – he was happy with Rosie and with John. Why shouldn’t John feel happy? Perhaps because it likely wouldn’t last and just when he’d get used to the idea of Sherlock cheerfully making burnt toast every morning, he would crash back into one of his sulks and that would be that. Or possibly, just maybe, because John had no right to be so happy to see Sherlock so happy with his daughter.
“And we know this…  how?” John prompted. Finally, Sherlock stood and began pointing authoritatively about the townhome.
"Hmm?"
of laughter against Sherlock’s mouth, but slid his arms up Sherlock’s sides to wrap around his back and deepened their kiss. Tongues swirling and teeth clashing, the two of them surged closer to one another, breathing heavily through their noses. John ran his left hand down over Sherlock’s hip to grip his buttock and leaned them to the side, pressing Sherlock onto his back on the sofa.
Leaning upward, John ran his tongue along Sherlock’s neck, tracing the jumping tendons of his throat. With a heady breath in Sherlock’s ear, he said, “Pull over. Now.”
Got to be friends first, came that snide inner voice that he had not heard in several weeks. Sherlock realised he was sneering at the woman’s back and swallowed his expression, affecting an air of curious nonchalance as John looked up and saw him.
“Oh, sure, but we’re both a bit older than all that. It’s not as if she’s a fresh deb,” John laughed off Sherlock’s attempt to dampen his spirits. “And neither of us is the heir to anything important. No one with an obscene amount of money is checking to see that nothing untoward has happened.” Damn. The one time Sherlock was relying on this blasted time period’s restrictive rules of order and John felt fit to let it all slide. “Back to Baker Street?”
"I'm not --"
“Vatican cameos,” John whispered harshly. Sherlock inhaled sharply through his nose and nodded. Silent as the night, John reached under the pillow beneath Sherlock’s head and retrieved his service revolver from where he had stashed it earlier in the evening. John jerked his head and Sherlock slipped off of the sofa and padded over to stand against the wall beside the front door. John went to stand on the other side of the entryway and he grabbed Sherlock’s gaze with his own.
"Probably good we didn't bring Rosie along on this one," Sherlock said.
"I don't th-" John slapped him again and Sherlock let out a short, low moan.
John liked
When John released Sherlock’s foot, he let it fall listlessly to the ground, his arms spread out in a pathetic pose. He was pouting. With a heavy sigh he said, “I am an island.”
“One more gunman,” Lestrade answered, “and just this woman. For now. We’re on our way to pick up the last assassin now.”
“Oh, Daddy,
So, I know you guys are all *dying* to know (wishful thinking, much?) -- but I GOT THE JOB!! I'm so excited and now that my anxiety has lifted, I can write again! I'm so relieved! I've just been typing like crazy and have even outlined my next novel-length fic. Johnlock, obviously. Johnlock + Exit to Eden = smutty, smut smut. Woo!
“Something to hide?” A nasal voice sounded from the doorway and Sherlock’s jaw clenched.
“Pity.” Sherlock sniffed in disdain.
"What's this we're doing?" John asked, his head feeling pleasantly swimmy again as Sherlock led him in the steps. Back with the right, back with the left, step to the right, together.
"And were you any good?"
"Doesn't seem to know much about anything, does he?," Sherlock muttered, but John shushed him with a finger to the lips.
She was already in her pyjamas after her bath – it was Thursday, so that meant the whale-print jammies – so Sherlock put her straight in her crib. She was getting a little big for it now; soon she’d have to move into a toddler bed. Sherlock had actually found one online that would expand into a full-sized twin as she grew, which seemed the most practical option. But he had ordered the one shaped like a pirate ship. It was only one size, but Rosie would prefer it. And so would Sherlock.
"Fuck off." But John did not leave Sherlock to fuck off. Instead, he pulled Sherlock firmer against his chest, away from the counter, and took a larger step backward. The song had a good, bouncy rhythm - easy to dance to if, like John, you didn’t actually know how to dance.
, Sherlock thought.
He breathed a sigh of relief. Behind the suggestive signage on the outside of the building was, in fact, an almost painfully hip bar. Clearly, the facade of an adult store had been left as an ironic decoration, and John rolled his eyes.
Sherlock looked rather pleased with himself. “Spot on, then. I didn’t expect to be right about everything.”
He was too loud, so John clapped his free hand over Sherlock's mouth, stifling his eager cries. "Sshh," John hissed into his ear, "someone will hear you." Sherlock's lips fell open at the thought and he greedily sucked John's fingers into his mouth. John delved his fingers deeper as he took his first thrust, hard and deep, and had to bite down on Sherlock's shoulder to silence his own shouts of pleasure.
“The book.” Sherlock glanced up at the top shelf and then back down to John expectantly.
"Well, that's just sort of an overview. They each have a lot of defining qualities. Gryffindors tend to be headstrong and confident, if a little short-sighted. Ravenclaws are wise, creative, if a bit odd. Hufflepuffs are hard-working and fiercely loyal, but generally everyone agrees that they're the sort of the stoner House."
." With that, Sherlock threw open the door and led Rosie out.
“You don’t want to –” John started, but Sherlock cut him off.
? The three of them were a family, but what were the
"… Hufflepuff, the friendly ones --"
John stared out into the club and every glance offered some new sinful experience to witness. People were doing everything from undulating in the dance floor to blow-jobs in the corner to a full-scale orgy in a large conversation pit. There was all manner of leather and satin and feathers and chains and suddenly, John’s plain denim jeans felt simultaneously very vanilla and very tight.
The first time John noticed Sherlock's increased response to glam rock was when they were at Bart's. Molly had the radio turned down low and had gone to fetch everyone a cup of coffee, despite John's insistence that she did not need to serve them, and Sherlock was swanning around the morgue. While examining the corpses of three triplets who had died after having their eyes, ears, and tongue removed (respectively), John noticed Sherlock's body moving in a more unified manner. As his hips gyrated gently to the rhythm of
“Lestrade managed to get a photo from a security camera of the man we think is the culprit. Unfortunately it’s not of very good quality and he doesn’t appear to be in any of the criminal databases. I thought this might help you should he come back in – there’s been another murder with the same M.O. so he’ll have to stop by within the next day or two to chronicle his activity.”
John's own orgasm was building again and he marveled at Sherlock's self-control - he was about to orgasm for the second time in an hour and Sherlock was still holding back. His long, slender length was leaking onto his muscled stomach as John pounded rhythmically into him. At long last, John reached forward to grasp Sherlock's erection in his fist, eliciting a desperate cry, before whispering harshly, "Cum for me, Sherlock. Now."
“I’ve told you before, Sherlock. Redbeard is gone.”
There was the silence.
“Then at least go to bed so
Sweeping his hand behind himself in quite the dramatic fashion, Sherlock knocked the microscope and his precious soil samples aside. In no time, he was on his feet, his hands planted on the smooth, metal surface. He spread his legs seemingly without thought and John felt an intense surge of power at his eagerness.
John stopped working entirely and gave Sherlock a shrewd look. “No, it does not. Only, it seems, when I ‒”
“You can’t just kiss my husband like that.” John's chin jutted forward and he felt very much that he would like to hit this man.
“Not – what’s the word – appropriate?” Sherlock questioned genuinely.
Making rather a show of it, John stretched out his arm and took his time selecting a dumpling from the plate in the center. Finally, Sherlock did a little double-take as John’s unnecessarily fancy chopsticks closed around one and transferred it to his mouth. At the sight of the utensils in John’s hand, Sherlock’s eyes widened fractionally and the slightest trace of a smile pulled at his lips. He said nothing, merely retrieved his food and visibly relaxed.
“Obviously.”
“Sketch artist,” Lestrade filled in.
Rosie crossed her arms and stomped her foot and John was almost disappointed at how cliché she was being. She gripped her space printed quilt in a vice grip and scrunched up her face until more angry tears started to fall. Despite his frustration, John felt his will beginning to weaken.
"John?" He blinked and realised that Sherlock had been saying his name several times in an attempt to get his attention. "How long have those soil samples been in with the chemical compound?"
“Investigating? Who let you near the body? It’s only just been reported to us.”
“I’ll never tell you!” Thompson cried and Sherlock let out an exhausted sigh,
John felt very much as if his chest might burst as he stared down at the sweet, odd, ridiculous man in front of him. It
“The game is on!” Rosie cried out from Sherlock’s arms as they bounded down the stairs and out onto the sidewalk.
“That’s what partners do.” He was always so matter-of-fact, and while it often came off as very annoying and condescending, it occasionally felt very genuine. This was one of those times.
Short chapter, I know, but I'm sleepy. So I'll cut it off here and return tomorrow. All my love and I cannot thank you all enough for the beautiful outpouring of love this story has gotten! It was completely unexpected -- especially seeing as I wasn't necessarily taking this fic seriously when I started. It was just a cute little prompt response and I absolutely did *not* expect so many people to respond so well. I love you all! <3 Diana
"And which one are you?"
“John?” Sherlock’s voice snapped him out of his frozen panic.
“Yes, I can,” Sherlock replied in a tight tone. “And I must admit, I don’t care for it.”
That caused John some confusion.
"Never heard of them." Sherlock shrugged and returned to his beakers. But after a moment, he stopped and turned to look at John again. "Make it stop - they have a terrible tonal quality. Haven't these people ever heard of harmonizing?" John was nearly indignant, but lowered the volume and changed the track via the bluetooth connection between his phone and speaker. For a few minutes, John played something else, some classical something-or-other, and Sherlock was quiet.
, John – not since you and Rosie moved in.” His grey eyes were filled with panic and John squeezed his arm reassuringly.
“I don’t know how to waltz, Sherlock,” John hissed.
The victim was male, mid-forties, slumped forward on a barstool with his cheek pressed against the bar and a whiskey glass clutched in his right hand. There was an identical glass on the bar to his left with a bit of liquid left in it. “What can I do?” John asked Sherlock quietly. “How can I help?”
The mantle clock read 12:37 AM. John was still not home. What is he doing? Isn’t it obscenely late? Where are all the overbearing morality watchdogs I was led to believe ruled this wretched time?
John smiled, his eyes drooping shut as he breathed in Sherlock's cologne. "Probably not." He took another deep breath. Versace Pour Homme - it smelled a little bit like Earl Grey tea - Sherlock's favourite. It also always managed to send a little shiver down John's spine.
"That she's been a fan for years, didn't believe I was dead, was thrilled when we got together, that sort of thing." Sherlock turned onto his side so that he was murmuring against John's abdomen, eyes closed, ready for sleep. "Apparently there are people all over who are very invested in our relationship."
“Leave them.” He moved his tongue to Sherlock’s neck, eliciting a groan.
“John?” Sherlock. His face was unusually gentle as John met his gaze. He shut his open mouth and cleared his throat. Shoulders squared, John shook off the uneasy feeling and joined Sherlock at the bar.
Anyway, to tide you over until I hear about the job, how about another chapter?
John was certain that he could feel Sherlock’s heart beating from across the coffee table. The hair on his arms and neck stood up with an electric charge as Sherlock stood slowly from his chair. Those long, beautiful hands reached out and cupped John’s face and surely he was dreaming as Sherlock bleeding Holmes bent down and tentatively kissed him full on the mouth.
“Mycroft,” John answered. “He never uses it. Except in emergencies.” John gave Lestrade a short nod, which he returned with one of amazement, and he and Rosie left.
Red. Bright and dark at once.
“Don’t worry, I do.”
“Of course I could work it out, but I don’t particularly care to,” Sherlock replied with a sigh. “I’d rather hurry this along, if you don’t mind. I’ve got a bedtime story to get to.” At that very moment, Mrs. Hudson was finishing up Rosie’s dinner and giving her extra shortbread biscuits before she attempted to put her in the bath.
“You’re married to me now,” John reminded him before sucking fiercely at Sherlock’s collarbone. He soothed the raised flesh with a kiss and Sherlock melted - actually physically slumped in John’s arms with a delectable sigh. John slid his hands down Sherlock's ribs to untuck his open shirt before taking a firm grip on the band of his bespoke trousers and spinning him sharply so that his back was against the table. “Work can wait.”
John's phone
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic, of course you will,” he said. Turning to John, he said, “I imagine Lestrade is on the way.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shouldn’t you know that?”
“I’ll never trust you again.”
There was a soft

“He’ll live?”
"Of course." Sherlock stopped set down his kitchen timer (ensuring that his second batch of soil samples wouldn't be ruined) and looked sincerely up at John from his perch on the metal stool. "'You're the fear, I don't care, 'cause I've never been so high'," he recited. "'I'll let you set the pace 'cause I'm not thinking straight'. That's me for you, John."
“Up,” John commanded, pulling at his prisoner’s shirt. Reluctantly ‒ and none-too-gently ‒ Sherlock jerked his own captive upward and the intruders were forced onto the sofa. “Hands behind your heads.” They complied, John’s revolver trained on them, and Sherlock quickly collected the fallen pistols. He slipped one into the band of his trousers and turned the other on the supposed War Officials. “I’ll check on Miss Adler,” John said. “You… do whatever it is you do with these two.” Sherlock nodded and John went quickly up the stairs to his own bedroom door.
"In what inane activity are you participating now, John?"
. He tucked in to his food with gusto and bit back a smirk as Sherlock slowly, almost tentatively, reached for a container of Kung Pao chicken ‒ his favourite. He was being so cautious, no doubt still confused by John’s abrupt appearance at 221B. Good. John liked when Sherlock was surprised, especially by him.
Worth it.
We had a baby!
“But not ‘your’ flat.” The gunman’s face fell. “That makes you… the muscle, I’m guessing.” Of course, he wasn’t really guessing, but people were so fond of their colloquialisms. “What’s your name, Muscle Man?”
“We’re going to do our best,” he reassured her. “Call us if you need anything, or if you get into any trouble.” Julia nodded solemnly and took a collecting breath. “Thanks again, Julia.”
not enjoyed it a little. Trying to look calm, casual, and relaxed, John walked through the fine jewellery department until he saw the Cartier display.
“The truth is, Sherlock,” he said softly, “that I haven’t done anything to earn you, either. But I will.” He nodded gently at Sherlock, trying to reassure him that this was, in fact, a momentary aberration. John reached forward and squeezed Sherlock’s long, bony fingers in his own before saying, “Just… text me next time. Okay?” Sherlock nodded.
“No, no, nothing like that,” Sherlock laughed and squeezed John’s knee affectionately. John tried not to tense under his touch, despite the tingle that went through his veins. “We’re detectives – we would like to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind.”
“I –” John started, but a realization hit him. He hadn’t mentioned his name. “Julia?”
"Maybe Ravenclaw - the smart ones.
Sorry again for the late update. I have no excuses. I offer your my undying love instead. <3 Diana
“Where can I find Jack?” Sherlock asked, unshaken.
"Why on Earth would you do that?"
"You think I'm on the
"I don't -"
“I’m sure it’ll be wonderful,” he murmured against her skin. The smell of her perfume was so sweet and comforting. Mary gave an indulgent little huff and leaned into his embrace for a brief moment.
I typed most of this chapter on my phone so please look for edits. ❤️
“Right. Okay. You’re unattached. Like me.” John schooled his expression into one which was incredibly casual. He rolled his neck and shoulders in a stretch, dropping his left arm onto the back of the seat as he did so, and shifted his hips as though extending the stretch. John’s right hand fell to his thigh and he let his fingers drape towards his groin.
began, Sherlock had moved to the bookshelves and was practically twisting about the sitting room. His hips rolled round and round, his chest following just behind in a smooth and very attractive wave. Watching him undulate from shelves to desk, John found his mouth going a little dry. As he considered the papers and books in front of him, the fingers of Sherlock's hand found their way to his chest and started elegantly tapping out the quick beat against his exposed sternum. Similar movements followed through
Immediately, John wanted to slap him. Ennui, indeed! Didn't he think John would like to be taken up on the couch in a fit of metaphysical angst? But things needed doing and he could really use Sherlock's help - if he could take Rosie to daycare, he might not been too late for the surgery.
“We’ve only just met ‒ the poor chap’s gone and split his head.” Watson put his hand on Sherlock’s arm again ‒ that was pleasant. Steadying. He urged him onto a stool and quickly but calmly gathered a few tools while Sherlock removed his soiled coat. Armed with a needle and tread, a small basin of hot water, and a bottle of alcohol, Watson gently pushed back Sherlock’s hair. He took to cleansing the wound there, which was larger than Sherlock had initially determined. When Watson pressed an alcohol-soaked cloth to the cut, Sherlock hissed with pain. “Apologies, sir.”
“Now,” said Sherlock, following the other two men inside, “we establish a social network – other girls in the ring, see if we can find out who the pimp is.”
“Mmph ‒ no, stop.” John pulled away so quickly that Sherlock nearly bit his tongue.

John wasn't conducting his experiment today. Not on purpose anyway. No, he was cutting the crusts off a peanut-butter sandwich while arguing with Rosie about the difference between
"Ah..
“Yes, it is.” Sherlock’s tone was surer, more insistent, and John quieted. “We share everything. We live together, we share holidays and family events – I have an equal part in raising Rosie, which flies in the face of all logic. You came back to me even after I faked my death and I have been here for you as best I know how since you lost Mary. You killed a man for me, and I for you, and I would do it a thousand times over to protect you and Rosie and to keep you here with me because I
The buzzer went off and both men jumped.
Instead, he stood up, tossing the paper aside and facing off with John from across the sitting room. “I can’t imagine that the sort of woman who practically begs to go out with a man, especially these days, has much in the way of honour about her.”
John’s mouth fell open a bit at Sherlock’s observation, but he cleared his throat and looked away. “No, I’m fine.”
By the time
It was very soft, very low, and very unintentional. But singing, it was. "
“That’s what people do, isn’t it? Leave a note?”
They could do a lot. As John pulled Sherlock down into a surprised kiss, they pressed against his own with a practiced fervor. Even though John had pulled him away from his work, Sherlock did not appear upset. Those hips took control, leading John backward to the bed as their tongues danced in their mouths. Those hips submitted to John's as he flipped them over so that Sherlock was on his back and his legs wrapped around John's waist. Those hips snapped up as John plunged his cock into Sherlock's willing flesh and the pulsing rhythm of the music seemed to swim around them.
His fingers pressed into the soft-hard flesh of Sherlock’s shaft as if he were finding notes on the fretboard. Dancing up and down, the digits pressed and released in rhythm with the radio, eliciting a deep groan from the detective. With one last strong, cheek-hollowing suck, John pulled off and replaced his left hand with his right. He dropped his left hand down to Sherlock’s warm balls, pulsing with arousal, and tickled.
“John? Where’s the tin opener?” Mary’s voice called from the kitchen and John leaned around the doorframe to what would become the nursery.
“Quite right.” A constant surprise. “God of beginnings, endings, and transitions. Appropriate, given that it seems that Mr. St. Clair is moving on to a new life in America.” John nodded and continued to sift through the paperwork in front of them.
“Er…” Sherlock floundered and refused to let his cheeks flush, “wouldn’t you like to get some lunch or something?”
“Sherlock Holmes,” he muttered, unable to make eye contact as he scanned the room around him.
“No. No, you said, ‘I know how you like the four o’clock hour.’” Sherlock took a step closer and his eyebrows lowered fractionally. He towered over John, but his demeanor was quiet and curious.
rather lovely, but who in their right mind…
,” Sherlock’s voice was breathy as John’s fingers finished undoing his buttons and slid expertly over his nipples. “The case… work…”
“Oh, Sherlock.”
But John also knew how much Sherlock enjoyed looking up at John from that angle. He knew that Sherlock loved to be at his mercy, controlled by his more-practiced hand and especially by his commanding tone. John tightened his jaw and glared down at his husband, whose nostrils flared with his heavy-breathing. "It was more than that, and you know it." John slapped Sherlock's right nipple with the crop, harder than he had hit the other one, and Sherlock bit his lip. "Sing out, dear. I want to hear you over the music."
“Harrod’s? Not exactly the seedy location I was imagining to pick up a prostitute.” John leaned over Sherlock to stare up at the iconic building which positively oozed of class.
“I imagine he’ll have several,” Sherlock confirmed. He stood upright and captured John’s gaze with his own. “I have what I need – let’s go home.”
“Why was he so eager to talk?” John mused, suspicion setting in. Thompson had been so keen to protect Jack - why would this man be so keen to sell him out?
“You’ve already seen it, though.” John shrugged.
He walked for hours, reacquainting himself with the city in it’s antiquated form. Previously, Sherlock had not taken much time to traverse the streets and alleyways to update his mental map. He’d preferred to remain in John’s company than wander the city alone. That impulse was gone now.
"Yes. It's rather catchy." Sherlock put away the final slide and made to change tasks - John's failed soil analysis. John turned the volume back up and went to stand beside his husband.
“You think this is easy for me?” John’s expression was vacillating between fury and self-loathing. “I haven’t stopped wanting you, Sherlock, but I can’t have you, so what good is it to just sit around pining after you? Traipsing around like a trained puppy. I deserve better than that!”
John huffed a breath through his nose. How incredibly uncharacteristic. Sherlock usually texted – why hadn’t he texted?
“It’s an internet quiz to see which of the four school houses from Harry Potter suits me best. In the books, they do it with the Sorting Hat, but I’ll have to settle for the Internet.”
“All taken care of?” John asked affably, his face relaxed and smiling for the first time in days. And that woman had done it. He tapped the card jovially against the fingers of his right hand.
Sherlock was dancing.
Sherlock didn’t respond to
One thing about Sherlock – when he was honest, you could tell. There was a very distinct difference in Sherlock’s mind between acting and lying. He would act as anything or anyone to get information or even to help someone, but he would never lie. At the moment, John almost hated his earnestness. He wanted so badly to be allowed to be angry with Sherlock – to be angry with anyone. Truly, he was just afraid. He had endured war, and injury, and tragic loss, but he was afraid of losing Sherlock again.
With a frustrated sigh, Sherlock pressed himself against the back of his seat and opened the car door. Clearly, he had no intention of moving for John’s convenience. Rolling his eyes, John crouched in the car and crawled awkwardly across Sherlock’s long legs. He managed to get his feet out and underneath him, placing a hand on the seat for balance. Only it wasn’t the seat, it was Sherlock’s thigh, warm and firm under his hand.  John jerked his hand away as if he were on fire and nearly tumbled onto the sidewalk, but Sherlock did not so much as look up. How dense could the man be?
"I'm a doctor?"
"If I may, Captain?" Sherlock brought one hand from where he was gripping John's thighs and gestured toward his trouser pocket. John nodded and he slipped his fingers into the fabric. Sherlock produced something small and black and held it up for John's inspection between his long fingers.
"Fine. I want a puppy." He made a tiny shrug as if to say
“The bartender’s missing.”
“The only thing we know
. “At the very least, I doubt that the sort of man who keeps careful inventory of his prostitutes is the sort of man who gets his hands dirty.”
The first man entered with a pistol in his hand, but his manner was relaxed ‒ he clearly was not expecting an ambush. Once he was a few paces inside the flat, his partner breached the threshold and John and Sherlock pounced. Sherlock’s left hand shot out and caught the first intruder square between the shoulders with the heel of his hand before grabbing the man’s right wrist and twisting his arm around. He turned the man’s wrist sharply toward his own forearm and kicked the back of his knee. The man hit the floor and his pistol clattered to the hardwood behind him.
The detective swallowed dryly before answering, "Because I behaved poorly, Captain."
“What?” Sherlock snapped and John thrilled a little to see the slight flush rising in Sherlock’s cheeks.
Sherlock pointed over to John’s chair. There, propped against the Union Jack pillow like a flat little person, sat a large piece of blue craft paper. In Sherlock’s nearly-illegible scrawl, John deciphered, “John – gone to S.Y. Lestrade got a lead. Taking Rosie. Be back by tea. – S.”
“Afghanistan,” John finally answered. “Kandahar, about fourteen years ago.” His shoulders stiffened as he remembered. “I was shot in my service as an army doctor in the Second Afghan War.”
“Well, that’s a turn. Are you sure it wasn’t Dr. Black himself?” he asked in a mocking tone.
“He’ll live,” John affirmed, his gun still trained on the wailing man on the floor.
Someone please double-check the end of this chapter for typos and other mistakes. I am drunk and listening to Hozier, so anything could have flown out of my fingers. <3 Diana
. “Why don’t I put Rosie to bed and you do the same with Mrs. Hudson?”
“Yes, of course. Julia.” They were quiet for a moment as they clambered into the newly-arrived taxi.
was quiet.
to be seen with her?”
“That’ll be the concussion ‒ not to worry. I’m heading to Bart’s now to meet an old friend. Come with me and I’ll tidy that wound up. You shouldn’t be left alone until you’re a bit steadier on your feet.”
“Yes.” At the mention of his so-called “wound”, John’s stance shifted so that his weight was on his left leg. “How did you know that?”
John laughed out loud.
“Don’t say that woman’s name to me.”
“I don’t like The Woman sleeping in your bed.”
"Not a psychologist. And certainly not one of the dozens that interviewed me as a child."
know about the drinking?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, but he did not dissent. His lip pursed, he turned on his good heel and stormed from the townhouse, the action somewhat diminished by his awkward gait.
"And you don't want to be the good guy?"
“Why not? This where you keep your stash?” she asked cruelly.
“Talk about what?”
“It’s psychosomatic.” John looked at Sherlock with a deep expression, his dark blue eyes boring into Sherlock’s in an attempt to determine his character. He had overstepped again. He was always doing that, according to Mycroft. Changing the subject, Sherlock asked flippantly, “Will I live?”
love Sherlock – he felt it in bottom of his heart. He also felt very stupid for not having admitted it to himself before now. But it was too soon to say – it would make things too intense too fast. And John wanted things to be as comfortable and familial as it had always been.
"I don't have friends."
I'm so sorry this chapter is late -- or maybe it isn't, at this point. I always have an aim of posting on Sundays, but I have a feeling it's been more Mondays and Tuesdays than I've realised. But, we got some news yesterday that could potentially be completely life-changing and absolutely AMAZING, so I've been a little distracted. Can't say more about it, but keep your fingers crossed and if it all goes off according to plan, I'll gladly share the news.
This time, Sherlock had been dashing away from a crime scene after someone that John had not even seen in the first place. When he had come to the intersection, he took an unfortunate misstep and placed his foot directly on the edge of the sidewalk. The concrete slick from the morning’s rain, Sherlock’s foot had slid out from under him and he landed, hard, on the unforgiving pavement below. It had been a truly spectacular fall – Sherlock was usually so graceful. Of course, all Sherlock could focus on was that his prey had slipped away.
He had dropped the crop onto the couch, but he found it again as his arousal spiraled in his abdomen. Running the tongue of the crop down Sherlock's twitching spine, John continued down until the shaft slid between his arse cheeks. Sherlock's hips rolled upward, begging for more, and John obliged. As he pressed as hard as he could on the plug, Sherlock cried out around John's cock and buried his nose at the base. That was it - John came so hard and so long that he thought he might black out. But he focused on the feeling of his cum filling Sherlock's throat, spilling from the corners of his mouth, his tongue writhing against the underside of his shaft and John shouted violently, "
“That…” John murmured, unable to stop gaping at the man beside him, “was amazing.”
“Let’s be quick about it. I’ll take the left, you go around the right and we’ll meet back up at those sofas in the back.” Sherlock straightened his shoulders and his suit jacket before taking off into the crowd.
It was a struggle to get his eyes to focus - they were moving out of rhythm with his thoughts. But finally, Sherlock’s head lolled drunkenly to the side and Mycroft swam into view. He was upside down.
As always, you have all my love and undying gratitude. <3 Diana
"What about you?"
He took in another deep breath and sat up. This was something Sherlock didn’t understand and that was part of John’s job as Sherlock’s friend – to help him understand. “Because life partners is something else, its… not just mates. They’re…
“The violin is out of tune,” Sherlock said with passing annoyance, his eyes still scanning the room with almost unsettling rapidity. “By about a half-step.” He squinted at someone over John’s shoulder, but must have decided that they were unimportant, for he soon resumed his observations of the room as a whole.
"Yes, Captain," Sherlock breathed heavily as his hands flew to John's waistband. He swiftly untucked John's shirt and undid his fly, bringing John's trousers down to his ankles. Sherlock pressed his fingers into the flesh of John's arse in a desperate grip. He buried his nose in John's crotch, still covered by his cotton pants, and
try to go back to sleep.”
Sherlock looked as though he were considering one more word, but licked his lips and nodded instead. Turning on his heel, he stalked toward the sofas, found a relatively unoccupied stretch of furniture, and tossed his jacket onto the seat. He held out his hand to take John's coat and when it was carefully deposited on the sofa, Sherlock faced John and placed his hands obediently behind his back.
Ugh. When are they going to kiss again?! Probably in the next chapter, if I had to guess. And I should know, right?
“It was you,” she replied confidently. Sherlock’s mouth twisted up in defiance, but the front door opened before he could defend himself. “Daddy!” Rosie called as John entered the flat and dropped his jacket on the peg.
Sherlock was motionless for a second, standing by the still-open door, staring at John as he moved about the flat. Finally, he seemed to reboot with a little jolt and scurried into the kitchen, dropping the tongs and cricket ball into the full sink with a clatter. By the time John had gotten the TV over to the correct input (Sherlock had gotten them mixed up when he electrocuted the telly a few years ago) and the DVD started, the kettle had boiled and Sherlock brought two steaming mugs into the sitting room.
. And I never will again.” He stepped forward and made as if to put his hands on John’s arms, but thought better of it. “I’ll never
“John,” Sherlock finally spoke, his voice drawing John’s gaze upward. “I am sorry. I never should have said…
“Thompson, right.” Sherlock rocked back on his heels and glanced around the flat. “Well, Thompson, since you’re not actually going to shoot me, why not put that gun down and tell me about Danielle?”
John shook the uncomfortable feeling away and returned to his examination. There was a faint chemical odour around her face – something he couldn’t place, but could have been a sedative. “I’m not sure – we’ll have to wait for Molly’s final opinion – but it is possible that she was still alive at the time of the uterine extraction.” Lestrade started pacing then, breathing through his mouth, but John pressed on. Looking down the rest of her body, strangely unmarred by knife or other assault, he noticed a tattoo inside her left elbow. “A barcode?”
John was achingly hard and he knew Sherlock would be too. So he knew that when he brought back the riding crop and snapped it forward on Sherlock's erection, his reaction would be exquisite. And he was right. Sherlock's entire body tightened as he arched backward with a deep, loud, indulgent moan.
“I know you do, love, but you can’t. Not today.” John pulled her tight against him and kissed her head. “Now, I won’t see you at bedtime, so give me my kisses now so I can go to sleep later.” She pouted up at him, but he continued, “You
He had bounded into Sherlock’s arms without hesitation and that had been it. Sherlock had given over his whole heart. He missed Victor so much.
"Hamish. John Hamish Watson. Just... if you were looking for baby names."
into glam rock.
“Nothing,” John agreed. “But if he hasn’t had a heart attack or something, I can’t think what else it might be.” Sherlock gave a deep, contemplative
“It’s the only way I have of getting in touch with Brook,” Sherlock replied. “His letter didn’t exactly include a return address.”
“Oh ‒ her name’s Sarah Sawyer.” Plain. Simple. Boring. “She’s training as a midwife. I actually met her the day of the explosion down at the Barley Mow. She was having lunch with a friend, who I am glad not to have run into again, I have to say.”
"I certainly don't think you're a sociopath."
“Finish with that tomorrow,” Mary replied. “Can you come get the cooker? My hands are full.”
"I know." Sherlock removed the current slide and reached for a second. He took a moment to roll up his sleeves - a look John very much appreciated - and exposed a tract of skin on the inside of his forearm, marred by something John had not noticed before.

“No, you cannot,” the doctor insisted. “It’s not broken, but it
“Y-yes?”
?” John suggested. Swallowing thickly, Sherlock nodded shortly, still not making eye contact. “Sherlock – Sherlock, look at me.” He did, but it was with great effort. “If Rosie turns out half as smart, as passionate, as – as

, this man - John sucked in a thick breath through his nose and felt his orgasm beginning to build.
“Or for when we get home.” Sherlock flicked an eyebrow and John’s mouth actually fell open.
It was such a gentle press of lips, so nervous and uncharacteristically shy that John didn’t want to breathe for fear of ruining the quiet of the moment. Sherlock pulled away, but John leaned forward and kissed him again, unaware of his intent to do so. After a moment, he realized that his hands were gripping the lapels of Sherlock’s obscene purple shirt so tight that his knuckles had gone white.
With a huff, John replied, "Obviously."
“Listen, I know thinking about Redbeard is hard for you,” he said gently. “But I think this is going to be good for you.” John shifted the bundle in his arms and gave Sherlock’s elbow a light, reassuring squeeze. “And Rosie is going to love it.”
“Have you got a badge?”
"Hmm?" He was nearing sleep. That was good.
After a few seconds of soft guitar, Sherlock took a deep breath through his nose and his eyelids drooped shut. His hands were still pressed against his lips, so he wasn't asleep, but he was visibly calmer. His eyebrows unfurrowed and his breathing became uncharacteristically calm and even. It almost seemed as if he was meditating. Then he elicited a deep hum in the back of his throat - John was utterly fascinated. How could the same artist elicit such completely different reactions? Before he could think too long about it, Sherlock took another deep breath and opened his eyes.
she’d be in trouble.” John offered Sherlock a little smile, hoping to relieve the tension. Instead of relaxing, Sherlock stood straighter and his eyebrows fell with severity.
“Prove it,” Sherlock demanded, gesturing toward the game board. “I deduce that the killer is, in fact, Miss Scarlett, and that furthermore, the weapon of choice was the spanner and the location was the kitchen. Can you refute this accusation?”
"You're not, are you?" Sherlock was silent. Never good. "Sherlock? Have you gotten her a puppy?"
“What?”
,” he whined and John suppressed a chuckle. “That boy was clearly reporting back to the killer and now it might be
John laughed. Laughed, a sharp, rude bark of a laugh that bore little humour. “‘Less-than-honourable intentions’?” With another little huff, John dropped his shoes unceremoniously by the door and put his hands on his waist. “You’re concerned for my honour now? Wouldn’t it be a bit more traditional to worry about Miss Sawyer’s honour?”
Well, wasn't that weirdly sweet? "You think so, love?"
“And then called the police on himself?” Sherlock scoffed. “Very helpful of him.”
. Two halves of one life. Two people who…
"Who's Sam Cooke?"
"Research suggests -"
A cold shiver went from the back of John’s neck all the way to his knees. How dare Sherlock say that –
“Speak for yourself,” Sherlock quipped.
“And you remembered?”
When they reached the main street, Sherlock stopped dead in his tracks. There were no cars, only carriages. Women were wearing bustle skirts and bonnets, the streets were cobbled stone, all the street lights were gas. Sherlock’s mouth actually fell open.
“Somewhere else,” he said curtly. “Don’t follow me.” The door slammed violently behind him as he fled the place that had once been such a comfort.
"Afghanistan or Iraq?"
"No - I… Nevermind."
John could feel the music thrumming through the car, through Sherlock’s body and into his own. “Jesus, Sherlock... so good...”
Christ!"
Sherlock's hands were shaking as he undressed as swiftly as possible. John followed suit, watching as Sherlock slipped out of his trousers and pants before crawling onto the bed. He knelt on the duvet, his face down and arse in the air, his hands already digging into the blankets. Now completely naked himself, John ambled onto the bed behind Sherlock and gave the perfect globes of his backside a firm squeeze. John traced his finger from between Sherlock's balls and up to his hole, beautifully stretched by the plug, and pinched the toy between his fingers. With his free hand, he finally relented, pressing the button a fourth and final time, stilling the vibrations and Sherlock nearly sobbed as John slowly removed the plug.
"I want you to cum," Sherlock moaned. "I want your cum -
“It’s meant to be paella, but we’ll see when it’s done.” Mary offered him a self-deprecating grin and dumped the contents of the tins in her hands into the rice. She had never been an excellent cook, but John appreciated the effort nonetheless. At any rate, she was leaps and bounds better than he was. Overcome with affection, John stepped up behind her and placed a small kiss at the nape of her neck, his hand falling to her belly.
: that says he wants you to stay in touch. You’re looking for cheap accommodation, but you’re not going to your brother for help: that says you’ve got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you
Ugh. Take forever, why don't you, Diana?!
“What did you say?”
The words hung heavy in the space between them and, for a moment, John thought he had upset Sherlock. Perhaps he had worked harder than John had realized to get the words into his mouth and now he had been cut short. The truth was that John
“Excuse me?” It was Captain Watson now, straight-backed and glowering. And if Sherlock were a fool, he would think it laughable that such a small, plain man would be trying to intimidate him. If he were smarter, he would stop.
"… and Slytherin, the evil ones."
’!” John blinked in bewilderment. “’
, John! You’re not ‘Papa’, you’ve always been ‘Daddy’!”
After a moment, Sherlock whispered, “John?”
<3 Diana
“Actually,” she said with a wistful smile, “my real name’s Mary.”
"I've never begged for mercy in my life."
Grumbling constantly, John pulled a wheeled ladder toward him – a ladder which Sherlock would not have needed – and started up it. “What’s it called again?”
Sherlock sighed and seemed to work up the courage to say something. “John, if you don’t want to… do
Oh. My. God. This update took for-fucking-ever and I'm sorry. But I have a really good excuse.
*A little BDSM ensues, Top!John*
Red hair, that made more sense.
“I have a brother, but I don’t care to darken your heart and mind with tales of
“Really?” Donovan asked unbelieving.
Sherlock danced.
“Who?”
"Not… not the clever one?"
"Easy." That wasn't really an answer, but it was likely all John was going to get at the moment.
Then…
John smirked and replaced the chopsticks in their sleeve. “Yeah,” he said, “they’re mine.”
"But you're also determined, foolhardy, manipulative, definitely odd —"
“Yes, yes. I love you, too,” Sherlock replied and despite his impatient tone, John knew he meant it. He smiled at the great softie disguised as an aloof detective and stood, his heart warming.
(See the end of the chapter for
He leaned back on the sofa and brought Sherlock's mouth back down onto his cock. Sherlock relaxed his throat until John's unforgiving length was fully-seated in that wet heat again. John held him down for a moment until Sherlock's throat began to convulse and his spit fell languidly around John's shaft. Vibrations from Sherlock's moans, the plug, the heavy music, all converged on John's erection and it was glorious. His grip tightened in Sherlock's hair and he began to thrust.
“At least twenty-one, including her,” Sherlock answered. “I’ll start canvasing the homeless network – very closely connected to prostitution – see if anyone has seen anymore of these tattoos.”
“I know that,” he replied indignantly. “Someone else doesn’t. Their pimp, most likely.” John was taken aback – Sherlock never acknowledge other people’s humanity.
I feel as though this story might end up being between 45-50 chapters -- the end is nigh, I can feel it. But, to paraphrase Old Lady Grantham, I never use one word where twenty will suffice. While this story is drawing to a close, I have been writing a lot in the background on another long one that will actually be published with a schedule. I hope everyone likes FTT enough to keep reading my other stuff -- I certainly enjoy writing it. As always, you have all my love and kisses. <3 Diana
“Pfft.” John’s reaction made Sherlock’s lip twitch uncontrollably. “You think your deductions are enough to really know a person? It takes so much more than glancing at someone to‒”
As he observed, Sherlock noticed Watson rest his cane against a cabinet and move unencumbered around the room.
Sherlock traded places with John, taking out his magnifier and looking over every inch of Mary’s body.
"Whiskey neat," John shouted over the thumping music. She smiled and proceeded to pour his drink and John placed the photo on the counter. "Tell me, have you seen this man anytime recently?"
“Why you’re upset.” Sherlock cocked his head and looked rather like a tall bird.
"… that's when I determined that the substance was, in fact, the powdered beak of a cock."
“Your wife?” Julia asked playfully.
"What would you know about it?"
"Doubtful." That made John chuckle. Yes, doubtful. Even John could see gaping plot and characterisation problems - just imagine Sherlock ripping into the
"Sherlock, I don't care about your ridiculous French laziness right now. I need you to get Rosie to school," he said firmly.
“What? Love?” Sherlock spat. “You love this woman now, is that it?”
I changed "troubles" to "upsets" because it just felt more like John.
"And will you ever do this again?" John trailed the tongue of the crop down Sherlock's sternum and pressed it firmly against the bulge in his bespoke trousers.
“Come inside, won’t you? I’ll patch you up and you’ll be right as rain.” He was gesturing toward the door of a lab Sherlock had visited before, though under very different circumstances. “It’s not exactly clinic conditions, but we’ll make do.”
