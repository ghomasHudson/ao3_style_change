“So what’s this about, Bobby?” he asks finally.
. There’s nobody left on Cloud Nine now. But then it all just got so
“You mean like prayer?”
“Does it...bother you?” The thought has honestly never occurred to him. Can angels feel shame? It’s not like Cas has anything left to fear from Heaven. “When I...You know.” The way Cas is looking at him suggests that no, he doesn’t. Dean sighs. “When I touch you like that. In public. Or...like this.”

Sometimes Cas helps Sam with the archives when he’s needed there, sometimes he goes with Dean—whether he’s on a hunt, manning the bar or just lounging in bed in his underthings, although that last one is usually not for long.
“Oh, gross. Dean, would you do something with him?”
“Exactly,” Cas says. “But I chose my own path. Creation can be the reason I exist. I can make it my purpose.”
“Yes, which reminds me,” Cas says, growing less disbelieving and more furious, “I still can’t believe you trusted a vampire enough to let him go.”
“Yes. With time,” Cas says, lowering the borrowed t-shirt. It’s simple and green but makes his eyes look bluer than usual. “But my battery is drained.”
“It’s not spying,” Cas says irritably, shuffling up close to him in the checkout line. “I was watching over you. After what happened in that graveyard—”
“Yeah...yeah. It’s bad,” he says. “He finished the trials, you know—closed the Gates of Hell.”
“Isn’t the point just to enjoy yourself?” Dean glances back at Charlie. “I mean, that’s why I do it.”
Dean traded up to the main office at work, so now he’s only ten minutes from his clock-in spot every day. He has the same hours, but the pay bumped up a half dollar. All Dean’s got, besides the bags of hunter shit in his car, is a twin size mattress in the shed and all the tools he uses for work.
And then, like always, Cas takes the inch Dean can stomach extending and gives him back a mile. He settles in behind Dean, over the blankets, back partially to chest; and Dean touches his hand another second before he gets comfortable again.
“Yeah! And nothing happened!” he shouts. “I had that thing made before I even got out of the car.”
“Why not?” He doesn’t know why he’s picking a fight about this. It just rises up in him, void of reason and impervious to will. “That seems right up your alley.”
“Sure, Dean,” he says. “I would like that very much.”
“Nothing,” Cas says finally. Dean raises one eyebrow, and he relents. “She thinks that I’ve...spent a lot of time down here, that’s all. It’s made me more human in some ways...I’m beginning to care about things. People.” Cas glances at Dean’s face again.
“Sometimes,
“Yeah. Yeah,” Dean says, blinking—and then says it again with more conviction. He touches Cas’s lower lip with two fingers. “I’m here. With you. Come here.”
Then, a blinding white: In the corner of the green sky, a light is descending. It falls slowly at first, but then faster and faster the farther down it travels, and the closer it gets, the more Dean’s eyes and ears begin to hurt. It starts off as a dull ringing but then it’s piercing, it’s bloody. The light comes right to him and he’s screaming worse than when Alistair cut into him, because he’s on fire, his eyes are on fire, his body is—This is what they always said was Hell, right…? Then the heat gets, impossibly, more searing—but just on his left shoulder. It burns so hot that it turns cool to the touch. Dean shuts up and lets the light take him.
“How do you know my password?” Dean asks, but Cas shushes him as the other line rings and pulls one of his arms more comfortably under his back.
“Well now I’m not sure it
, or maybe the other way around—he’s surely the first to find out about this? And this, and this and this.
Benny’s arms come around him in a bear hug that’s so tight, he and Dean automatically sway to the left. Clapping Dean on the shoulder with one big hand when he pulls away, he shakes Cas’s with the other so enthusiastically that Cas looks a little bit alarmed. Ruffling up Cas’s hair in the back, Dean gestures them over to the booth he saw Benny in before. Cas doesn’t move over that much when he slides in, so Dean has to press up against him just to fit in the same side of the booth.
After some deliberation about staying in the library, Cas returns to the kitchen with paper and pen and posts up in the corner. For ten or so minutes it’s silent except for the scratch of Cas’s writing, water bubbling and whatever song Dean’s humming under his breath. Then Dean finishes chopping some carrots, wipes his hands on his apron and comes over to the table where Cas is crouched over.
“Hey Lis. I’m fine,” he says. He cringes when she presses on his bruised spine.
They go back to bed around four in the morning. Cas acts like he isn’t following Dean’s lead, so he waits a couple of minutes to shut off the TV as well as the lights. And Dean, who feels like he can’t protect anyone worthwhile most of the time, holds out his arms for Cas to curl into them on top of his chest.
“We didn’t have plans,” Cas said. His hands were in his pockets as he crossed the yard.
“I’m going to bring this tray out,” Cas finally says.
. Nobody knew him better; and nobody still does, save Cas. Bobby loves him well enough to
“Or it will,” Cas adds. “I assumed we all collectively agreed to make that choice.”
“Yep. Warm and fuzzy, that’s my Cas.”
Benny grips his hand tight when he shakes it.
Cas shuts the door and angles his body between the square window inset in the wood and Sam’s face as Dean puts his hand over his mouth and starts muttering Latin.
A middle-aged woman with a shock of blue hair is standing in the doorway with her hands open by her sides, poised as though ready to strike. A thrill of terror runs down Dean’s spine, although he doesn’t consciously know why.
“Because you’re picking fights with me like you do,” says Cas.
“That’s what you said last time right before you pulled them open,” Dean says. His jaw works beneath prickly skin, at least two days’ worth of stubble built up on his cheek. “Would you sit down and let me have a look?”
. It’s always been my life.”
“I promise you, the second I got back to Heaven that night, I told them to stop what they were doing,” Cas intones. “You have to believe me.”
for it. It seems as though he can feel every inch of the space between them burning in his fingertips, itching to reach out and pull him back in. He watches Dean walk out of the room and then turns around, blinking at the movie screen, trying to get reoriented with the plot through his hazy memory of the first forty-five minutes. He thinks he can feel Charlie watching him but either he’s wrong or simply too slow by the time he turns to check for himself.
“I'll see you on the other side,” he tells her. “Probably sooner than later.”
After they finish the five mile round trail, Cas finds a bar with a good wings special with his free hand while the other traps Dean’s over the gearshift. Dean downs three rum and cokes while he’s eating, and then they hit the remainder of the road.
Dean beams, swiping bacon off the plate in his hands. Cas pauses at the foot of the stairs.
“Don’t roll your eyes at me,” Dean snaps, holding his shoulder to keep him still while he finishes cleaning up his bruise. “This is serious.”
“She’s not
“I’ll drive. Grab your stuff and meet me outside in five,” she calls back to Ben. To Dean, she waves a finger in his face. “I have to go, but we’ll talk about this when I get home.”
Scowling, he does head outside.
“Neal, this is Castiel. Cas, Neal.”
It’s a good dream for once. He and Sam are tracking a werewolf through Memphis when they catch wind of a demon attack the next state over; they finish off the cub quickly and head on over, only to find Cas already dealing with it. They help him finish off the last couple of demons swarming the safehouse, each of them wielding a copy of Ruby’s knife, and then get takeout and watch a movie at the random motel they find off the freeway. That’s the part of the dream Dean lingers on, when the three of them are shower-warm and laughing with nowhere else to be.
fake credit cards that you’re using—”
Cas enjoys sports. Although Dean strongly suspects that he chose his favorite wrestler based mostly on costume and gravitas, and he refuses to change his mind regardless of how determinedly Dean tries to sway him to the contrary, it’s funny to watch Cas comment on the match in that grave voice of his. Dean shouts and swings his arms when he cheers on his player, but Cas just brushes his lips against Dean’s temple and says, “I’m glad I chose The Mountain as my preferred wrestler.” Sometimes he shouts or groans when the guy Dean’s backing pulls off a spectacular move.
“It was worth it,” he says honestly.
“It’s good,” he says, near enough that Cas hears him breathe in deep. He studies Cas’s face for a long time, a small smile playing on his mouth.
“I’ll get it,” he says before she can, and shoves his chair back with a loud and horrible scrape. Literally anything that will get him out of this dinner, away from the kitchen and this indescribably terrible conversation.
“Have you been using my laptop again?” Dean complains. “Man, I told you not to touch my stuff. Your phone—”
“I,” he announces, “want to join your operation.”
“Right. But that won’t be done for awhile, and that shed is...I believe you would call it a ‘shithole.’”
“How are you feeling?” Dean asks, prodding around the tender scabs and beginnings of a scar.
“Is she alive? Is she hurt?” he asks.
Cas doesn’t like the way he says ‘friend.’ He is so sick of people saying that to him.
“I think you guys are sweet,” Ben pipes up. Dean makes a face, and Ben sticks his tongue out right back.
“Woah, woah! Easy—”
“No.” Cas stands up. “I love it when you come home falling down drunk and wake me up at four in the morning.”
“But you didn’t
“That would be right here.”
He finds Dean lurking in the library when he’s done, flipping through old books. Whatever it is can’t be important because when Cas touches the inside of his wrist and quietly says his name, Dean puts his tome back and turns around.
Cas’s favorite, most familiar voice in the whole world is in a goddamn bitch of a mood tonight. Well, it’s going around.
“I’ve been thinking,” Cas announces from one foot behind Dean, which is apparently how he thinks it’s appropriate to introduce himself.
“No!” Sophie cries. “I don’t care about Heaven. The souls up there are free. I
Looking at him up close, Dean
Dean’s house is coming along. It’s only been three months, and he doesn’t have a second set of hands anymore, but he dedicates most of his free time to it and that’s starting to show: The whole front room is coming together, and pieces of what will be the bedroom is half-constructed too. Dean’s drilling when he notices movement right on the other side of the table and startles, looks up, and nearly puts a screw through them both.
When he’s yawning more than playing the game, they go to bed. This time Cas follows him down, no pretense. He lays an inch away in the dark motel with just the alarm clock for illumination and feels Cas touch the side of his face, but again he can’t sleep.
“No. But it needs something,” Cas says. Dean joins him on that side of the bar. “It’s creepy with all that darkness coming in.”
them doesn’t mean he can’t
“What are you talking about?” Dean demands.
“Alright, princess, dial back the dramatics. I’ll fix it when I get back,” Dean says. He sniffs. “But I meant...how are you feeling about all this Metatron stuff? We didn’t really get a chance to talk about it when…”
“What happened? What hurts?”
Confused, Cas raises his hands and cups them beneath his outstretched one, and the man drops a handful of quarters into Cas’s palms. Cas gazes up and up at him. His scraggly white beard hides most of his lower half of his face, but Cas thinks the man is smiling.
“What are you doing here?” Dean asks. It’s easier to hold in his guts and glare than he would have thought. “I thought I made myself clear at the drugstore.”
“And then some,” Cas says grimly. Dean gives him a look, and he relents. “We’re going to...put him away somewhere safe. Somewhere he can’t incite anymore havoc up there.”
“I suppose you’ll just have to teach me, then.”
“Are you saying that was a religious experience?”
“Oh, excuse me,” she says. “You sounded like you didn’t know.”
“I…I don’t know. I suspect the other angels’ graces would have fallen too, much like Anna’s did.”
“Please!” the siren gasps. “I can help you!”
“I...Sure,” says Dean, taken aback.
Since the diner, things have been...different. It’s in the little things, and Dean can practically lie to himself for a living but he can’t lie that the tides have turned: Nothing overt, but it’s in the way Cas inclines his head nearer when they sit on adjacent sides of the table; the brush of Dean’s hand against the small of his back when he lets Cas through a door first; it’s in their arms brushing when they walk, how Cas brings him the right coffee whenever he visits now, the excruciating five-act play Dean sat through last month because Cas never saw a show in all his years walking the earth. Dean’s arm around the back of the couch, and how Cas’s far shoulder is still close enough for his hand to brush.
“Wait is that—Raphael? What the hell are you doing to him?”
“Hey, better than the blood bag emergencies you keep ringing me up about,” Dean says. Benny gives him a sheepish grin.
“I did all of this to save him,” Cas tells her patient expression. “It terrifies me how much I’ve done with that goal in mind, and what else I might be capable of if he continued to be put at risk or threatened.”
“Nothing,” he says.
Glass clinks on the other end of the line. Cas tilts his head.
“OK first of all,
Before they can broker a clear-cut agreement, they hear Ben clamoring down the stairs.
And then Cas is there: Not the one who came to see him in his dream last night but a different one, colder. He isn’t looking at Dean; his eyes are fixed on Jo instead.
“How did you find me in the garden when you couldn’t pray to me before?” Cas asks after awhile.
“Go, Dean,” Hannah says darkly.
The pain is the same, every time. It’s the worst heartache he’s ever experienced; it’s the most bloody wound he’s ever had. He writhes against the floor while the hellhounds cut into his leg, his chest. He screams and screams, and Lilith smiles, and Sam screams too.
For the first time since Cas fell from Heaven, the air in the bunker is tinged with hope.
“Hey...” Dean’s eyebrows pull together, and he reaches out as though for Cas’s knee; his hand stops in the air between them and falls to the mattress, where his fingers clench loosely in the sheets. “That’s not what I meant.”
“Was?” Crowley says. “Ah. I see you’ve come down with the same sad disease as I: Humanity.”
“I know.” He pauses. “I’m trying, Dean.”
“This is a nice...place you’ve got here,” he says. Dean rolls his eyes.
“I don’t know,” Dean says, who’s smiling somewhy. “Is there a good reason I should?”
“No.”
“Yeah, I’m, uh—” Dean slung his arm around Cas’s shoulder, pulling him tight to his side. “I was just teaching my friend here a few things about building a house.”
The compliment sits hot and strange in his chest, like fizzling electric wire. It threatens his voice too, so Dean focuses instead on the bitterness: About Sam, about how hard being normal is, about everything. He brings it up to the surface like it’s fresh and feeds off it so he doesn’t do something stupid, like cry, or say thanks.
“She didn’t corrupt me,” Cas insists, watching Dean closely. Were his eyes always this
Cas and still barely made a dent in Cas’s expression. “We’ll stop for snacks first thing. You can pick out whatever you want.”
“Sure. We can,” Dean agrees slowly. “Dinner or drinks?”
“It’s not in there,” Dean says before he’s even fully freed his ears.
“They’re FDA approved painkillers,” Dean counters. “Just promise me you’ll take the damn medicine, alright, so that I can sleep easy?”
First he sits on the side of the road and buries his face in his hands. Then, when he’s cried his fill, he gets up and walks until he comes upon the lights of the nearest town, about four miles down the road. From a payphone just outside of Albany, New York, Cas dials a familiar number with one quarter he found after a painstaking search of local convenience stores’ floors and all along the side of the road on the way here. The phone rings six times. Is this what it feels like to wait, to not just fly away wherever he wants to go? Cas is missing his wings more than he thought was possible.
Dean always has to go places and talk to people. Eyes straying back to the book he was reading before something one of the characters said made him think of Dean, Cas murmurs, “Be safe, Dean.”
When he’s not working, or distracted, Cas wanders around on his crutches with Sam’s headphones hooked around his head, one ear on, the other always listening out for abnormalities in the bunker that never come. (The Winchesters and five years on Earth have taught him better than to let down his guard.) At first he tries to aid in Dean’s endeavor of fixing up the bar, but it’s too hard with his broken leg and ribs that can’t move very far; even breathing still hurts sometimes if he takes too deep a breath. Cas rearranges a couple of chairs and then tires, and goes to the library to do more research for Sam instead.
“Yeah, you should have,” Dean says. They look at each other for a moment, and then Dean shakes his head. “Look, man...I’m going to check out this hunt. I’ll—I’ll text you when I get there. See you in a few days.”
Cas appraises him with one eyebrow raised. He looks vaguely amused.
“Her bio has, like, three astrology references on it.”
“Bobby?” he asks. “I haven’t heard from you in…”
“I just...You used to be an angel. I didn’t know if it would all...
“It makes me feel good to take care of things,” Cas says when he’s catching his breath. His fingers trail down Dean’s sides. “This garden...Miracle…”
not.”
doing what I was told. Believing I was better than humanity; that what I was doing was for the greater good. And then I pulled you out of Hell…” His eyes dart to Dean’s face and away. “I began to question—”
Cas is giving him that look again. That
Although Dean ribs her and Bobby initially about getting together, he learns that Jody’s actually found herself a girlfriend and an adopted daughter since Dean last saw her over a year ago.
“You know that’s not an excuse,” he says. “And you know that you have me, always. And Charlie. And Sam when he wakes up. We’re gonna help you figure all this out. You do know that, right?"
He nods at Dean’s coat where he’s clearly clocked the gun in his inner pocket; Cas frowns, scanning him too to see what Benny’s looking at. Dean chuckles and tugs on his jacket to curtain the gun from view.
“Is that this weekend already?” he asks, trying to feign interest for her sake. This means that Dean’s going to be gone all weekend, which equals a lot of sleeping and painting on Cas’s part. Maybe Sam can find them a hunt so they’re not too bored without him.
“Oh what is this, some messed up scavenger hunt?” Dean calls, spreading his arms.
“I told you, I don’t torture them!” Cas says. He grabs Dean’s shoulder and spins him around. “When I found out what they were doing to find the Alphas, I was furious with them.”
“Pleasant dreams?” Cas asks, looking around the room. He walks along the wall a little, examining it. Dean sees his eyes catch on the same spider.
He has absolutely no experience with painting, and only two big buckets that are supposed to be for the walls. He just knows he’s got a big ball of something in his chest, something sickening he thinks is great dark
They finish the nachos, and Charlie smokes the rest of the bowl and cleans that up along with their food. Cas gets very cozy in the corner of her couch, and when she comes back, they put on another episode of her show while paying extra close attention to the pre-episode recap. Most of it still goes over Cas’s head.
Dean warmly kisses him good morning and fixes them coffee while Cas finishes up breakfast. Dean had to convince him that just because Cas liked the smell of toast didn’t mean that Dean wanted to
“Well, Sam’s finally out of the hospital…”
“Then we’ll gank the bastard and skip merrily off into the sunset,” Dean says, throwing his arms out. “I didn’t even know if you were ready to
ago? Bobby isn’t usually that slow. He waited, he waited until the anniversary so he could—What? Have an excuse to bring it up? See how Dean’s doing? Try to reunite under the guise of shared grief?
A lead weight lives in Dean’s chest most of the time now, but it feels heavier tonight for some reason. The air is still and a little stuffy now, so Dean gets up and flips off the heater that he wanted so bad when they came in. He tries to find a few different sources of entertainment: From a show about a teenage medium (definitely fake, and the kid talks funny) on a higher channel to the whiskey stashed in the fridge to internet porn, Dean still ends up bored as fuck by eleven and not nearly tired enough to sleep.
Cas helps him to his feet. It’s a long walk back to the car, but at least he can use his flashlight again. Cas is back in his usual overcoat and it keeps getting snagged on twigs, but he refuses to just take it off for some reason. Honestly, Dean is pretty sure the guy is more caught up on honoring Jimmy than he likes to admit.
Cas rolls his eyes.
“How’s your work?” he asks. “You seem to be doing better. Fewer sore muscles than last week.”
that little traitor is sneaking off to sleep in Dean’s bed most nights, although Dean’s usually lying beside Cas in his room anyway, so it takes some sting out of the blow.
“So, what?” Dean asks, stabbing at his food. “You felt bad enough to make me a pet, so you could get a second chance at playing guardian angel?”
“What? I’m not picking fights—”
“Of course, Dean,” he promises gravely. “Will you show me how to set that up?”
“Heaven’s work is none of your business.”
“I’m outside,” Crowley’s voice announces over the speaker. “Would you be so kind as to let me in?”
Eventually he decides to try his luck with some habanero salsa and what appears to be some kind of queso dip with no cheese-like substances on its ingredient list whatsoever. The drunk cashier gives him a lopsided grin, and Cas instinctively smiles back.
Cas looks from their hands up to his face. Dean’s got an exceptional amount of freckles this close, which he knew but it never fails to amaze.
“Are you insane?” he asks. “It’s Dean.”
“Ex-demon,” he reminds him. “And Dean’s new best friend.”
“But you chose to destroy my house instead. That’s really awesome.”
“I said no.”
that you wanted.”
Charlie reaches out to touch his arm.
They have a quiet, amicable lunch. Dean invites himself to TV night with Charlie. As they’re clearing away the table, still engrossed in a low conversation about mermaids and sirens, Dean’s phone lights up and starts buzzing.
“I think that’s where the bathroom sign goes,” Cas calls.
everything's growing in our garden, you don't have to know that it's haunted...the doctor put her hands over my liver, she told me my resentment's getting smaller...no i'm not afraid of hard work; i get everything i want.....
“Actually, it is. Apologies if that’s disappointing or repulsive to you.” Cas’s voice is thick with offense and vitriol and grief. He shakes his head. Two fingers pinching the bridge of his nose, he adds, “Go on your hunt, Dean. Perhaps killing something will make me more bearable to be around.”
“I’ve got the plates,” he tells her. “I’ll clean up the mess in the backyard too.”
Dean flips over, his eyes flying open. Cas is sitting propped up on the other side of the bed right where Dean left him, reading a newspaper that’s fanned out on his lap, a closed laptop on the bedside table that he was probably up on all night. Dean jolts upright.
“I came to ask you for a favor,” the vampire returns amicably.
“It doesn’t have to be...words,” Cas says. “Even just a feeling, or a...longing will do. You wanted my help, so I heard it.”
“I’m just checking to see how you were doing,” Cas says, stepping closer. He cocks his head in the other direction, considering him wholly.
“So you’ll do it?” Cas insists anxiously, hovering close again.
“There’s dinner in an hour,” she says in a soft voice, as one might use to avoid spooking a horse. “Ben will be home soon. He’s studying at a friend’s place. I’m sure he’d love to see you before you go.”
. “It seemed more cost efficient than driving to see Charlie every time I needed to buy more...and the rude lesbian teenager who offered me some at the grocery store seemed very untrustworthy—”
“Yeah,” he whispers to his lap.
“I don’t need to touch myself to achieve orgasm as a stress reliever like you do.”
“You, as usual,” Cas says, shaking and sure like a stake that isn’t buried right. “Are you coming down here or do I have to explain Sternberg’s triangular theory of love again?”
“Of course I thought it through,” Cas says. “I am not stupid, Dean. Do you think I didn’t notice
His phone vibrates on the table again, Crowley’s number visible on screen. Dean silences it with a grunt, but when he goes to scrape at his plate again, Cas reaches out and touches his wrist to stop him.
“I am, I...I’m good,” he says. “Look, Lisa...I really appreciate everything you’ve done for me this year. I don’t think I could have made it this far without you, so...thank you.”
Tucking the phone to his chest, he whispers, “What?!”
“Say goodbye,” Cas repeats, the words landing somewhere just right of Cas’s heart and hovering, warm. Generally he doubts that Dean even recognizes how kind he is, but that doesn’t make it any less charming. Still, a pit opens up in his stomach beneath the admiration. “But you just got back.”
What do you do with the weight of somebody else’s rebellion on your shoulders? In Dean’s case, he cracks Cas a beer and sneaks one of his disgusting veggie burgers onto the grill, even though Cas doesn’t need to eat and it frankly taints the entire tradition of barbecues to even put vegetables in Dean’s presence, but.
He yanks his shirt to the side and, sure enough, the once-deep wounds are just pink scars now. He’s healing slower than usual.
“So?” Dean prompts when he’s settled in with food. He’s getting real sick of prepackaged sandwiches from 7-11, but it’s better than granola, which is what Sam would probably bring. “What is this big, pressing matter you’ve been thinking about?”
Dean puts his hands in his pockets. Cas is watching him, he can feel it—and from about six inches away too, Dean wants to shoo him away on the wind. But if Cas goes now, he won’t be around to sober drive Dean home later. Plus he needs a sounding board for all his drunken shit; he owes big tips when he spills it to the bartender instead. Cas rarely knows what to say but at least he’s always there to say it.
“I decided to take up painting,” he says.
When he pulls away, he spots a glass of water on the bedside table and passes it back to Dean without turning away from his fallen friend; and Sam just looks him over, lips pressed together and smiling.
When the light came, Dean wasn’t on the rack; he was in a red room with a blade in his hand. He doesn’t really remember the details anymore, in truth, because that was Before he knew Castiel, and because he’s worked very hard to block Hell out of his mind completely. But in the dream he’s lying there splayed on the rack while Alistair and Alistair’s mutt cut into him, and voices he recognizes as Sam, his parents, Jo, Ellen,
“Sam will wake up,” Cas says, reaching across the table to touch his wrist. “He didn’t die in that church. We may not know the reason for it, but that’s a
“What, me? Yeah, go, go. You should enjoy yourself. I’m just going to be getting some work done around the house today anyway…”
, Cas hears the underlying insult, though he doesn’t voice it; Dean’s too sweet on him to press a bruise.
“Really?”
“Dean,” he sighs, tired of plucking this conversation out of him thread by thread. Where’s the rest of the blanket?
“But Metatron tricked you.”
“It’s time,” he says, this time with a frustrated edge to this voice. He paces away across the kitchen, then turns abruptly. “I’ll be back as soon as I know things are still in order.”
He wakes up groggy, but something in Dean’s internal clock is telling him that it’s later than he usually rises. He cracks open one eye and gropes around for his phone charging beside the pillow. 10:14AM. He groans, rubbing his face against the sun.
you do anything besides fight Raphael and his gang of mooks?”
“You’re supposed to run,” Dean informs him over a water break.
“Luckily, you don’t have to find out.”
“Hiya, Cas,” he says. “I see your Dean still isn’t here to save you.”
“That’s actually suboptimal,” Cas says. “I don’t know about—Where did you say we were, Dean? Bumfuck, Indiana—but most humans consider an ‘A’ to be a—”
He puts it on mute, on speaker, looks at Dean and just waits. Contrary to the beliefs he held up until a few weeks ago, Dean is decidedly
“Are you kidding? A queen can never have too many knights hanging around.” Charlie thinks something that she appears to find amusing, because her lips quirk up in a smile, but she just finishes packing her bong and slides it to Dean. “Are you…partaking?”
“Easier?”
The morning wanes on a messy canvas and rows of happy plants, although Cas doesn’t know it locked away in the bunker. He only registers the time when the door opens behind him, and he glances at his watch as he’s turning around to watch Dean amble up the stairs, running a hand through his bedhead. He comes right to Cas and winds an arm around his waist, pressing a warm kiss to his cheek: If his bleary-eyed look isn’t evidence enough that he just woke up, the heavy way he leans into Cas gives him away completely.
“Hiya, Ben.”
thing, Dean.”
It’s a slow news day on all the relevant state channels, which more or less means that there’s nothing particularly funky going on within Indiana’s borders. They’re watching a politician lay out his new clean water initiative while Dean finishes eating, and Cas gets dressed; he throws on a pair of jeans and leaves on the shirt printed with Schrödinger’s irony along with the only non-dress shoes he owns.
Cas covers the mouthpiece. “Jody’s girls are mucking up a crime scene again.”
Dean gets lost in the kissing for a little while. He deserves this, maybe, a little bit of a break from overthinking, and Cas’s hands on his waist and the edge of his jaw, and the quiet rasp of Cas’s stubble on his cheeks. Dean pulls him in closer until Cas lays down, bare chest touching bare chest.
What’s that running in an undercurrent? Some kind of wobbling. Cas thought his chest was already aching the worst it knew how, but now Dean has to go and get weepy.
Dean agreed to meet Crowley at a café in town, insisting that a) he can handle himself and b) they turned Crowley human in order to close the Gates of Hell, so he’s not much of a danger to them regardless. Cas is still deeply shaken by the idea of letting him go in alone; Crowley may not be juiced up, but he’s still a nasty son of a bitch, and Cas doesn’t trust him. Call it an ex-partner’s intuition.
“Really? That’s it?” Dean demands. “So what, if I never brought up your falling then you just never would have said anything?”
,” Cas informs him. “So you’ll excuse my impatience when I tell Sam to, how do you say it? Stow his crap long enough for you two to come pick me up.”
Dean beams. Go small town teenagers, always good for apathy when you need it.
“Make me.”
In the same second, Dean’s throat feels like it’s closing up. He gasps, hands flying to his neck so quickly that he loses his balance and falls sideways, landing hard on his elbow. The witch smiles.
“Shit,” he mutters, scraping his chair back across the floor. “Shit...Dean, before you say anything—”
“So where is he?”
“I...have fallen,” Cas whispers as Dean’s kissing down his jaw, down his neck. His hands slide, pushing up Cas’s t-shirt. “In...
He clears his throat, feeling unnecessarily awkward again. You’d think a guy pulling you out of Hell would make you instantly impervious to discomfort around him, yet somehow, despite Alistair, despite
That afternoon, Dean and Cas stay on opposite sides of the bunker and don’t see each other all day. Cas holes up in his indoor garden with some pre-rolled joints, ready to stay up there for awhile. He assumes Dean’s drinking with Crowley, or getting betrayed by Crowley or throwing out his dog; whatever it is, he doesn’t hear him at all and makes sure not to go to bed until long after Dean’s taken his nightcap back to his room.
Dean’s throat is suddenly very, very dry.
“Yeah, I don’t think Krissy’s the best at relaying intel,” Dean agrees, “but she definitely got the name right. How many Metatrons can there be running around?”
Dean groans, turning away from him. “Oh, God, was I talking in my sleep again?!”
“‘That’ is my stomach, handsome,” Dean muses. “What do you want me to do, cut it out?”
“Dean,” Ben says warmly, squeezing him tighter around the middle.
“Peachy,” Cas replies, crossing his arms.
“I know.” Cas looks at his feet, uncharacteristically awkward. Well, the dude’s always awkward—just usually minus the shame, or whatever it is that’s flickering over his face now. “I didn’t want to get in the way.”
Cas elbows him. Grinning, Dean ruffles Cas’s hair and throws an arm around his shoulders, pulling him closer. Cas rolls his eyes, and Dean cups his face and smiles close until it’s all that Cas can see: His happiness, his brightness. He gives in and lets Dean kiss him and kiss him.
a few fights where you shouldn’t bring only a gun.
Cas grins. His hand settles in Dean’s hair and strokes gently, enjoying the way Dean angles toward the attention like a cat seeking light.
“Ah, shit,” he mutters as he cuts the engine.
“No, that’s OK. I know how private you are,” Neal said. He was jerking his thumb at Dean, but said to Cas, “It took me three weeks of stubbornly hassling this guy before he would even tell me where he worked. How do you get him to talk to you?”
Dean’s tilting up his face, teeth catching on Cas’s lower lip, tongue slipping into his mouth and Cas’s teasing drifts away from him, his thoughts draining fast through a sieve.
“I find you less grating when we’re on an even playing field.”
Dean’s knife is relentless, stabbing him in the chest. Sam’s crying but it turns into a horrible, vicious laughter. Blood bubbles from the corners of his mouth.
“It gets better and better with age,” he sighs.
“I still don’t see the difference,” Cas says, tilting his head in the other direction. “They taste the exact same to me.”
“On the front lawn?”
Dean keeps yawning but can’t seem to sleep; he curls around Cas even while Cas talks through his show and generally pushes his buttons, for no reason except that he had a 5PM coffee and can’t get appropriately tired himself. Not long after Cas tries and fails for a fourth time to sleep, he nestles his head closer to Dean’s pillow. His eyes are barely open and his breath lands on Cas’s collar, comfortingly even.
“Cas,” he says, and his voice cracked right down the middle.
“Well, not completely.” Dean shrugs one shoulder. “But out of the big stuff. I just think Heavenly wars, angels—It’s all a bit...big for me nowadays.”
“What was that last part?” Dean says, tilting his ear up.
“What’s the news, brother?” Benny asks, sliding them both beers. A third is already sitting half-finished in front of him. “You don’t usually come up here strapped and loaded.”
me down there!” Sam snarls right in his face. “I’m already down here
It’s also the most at home that Dean’s felt in months, the minute he hunkers down with pie and cards on a dirty motel carpet. Cas picks up his hand confusedly, glancing up at Dean’s face for approval.
Dean coughs. “No.”
Seeing his opening, Dean slides across the floor and cuts one of his pocket knives through the vampire’s leg restraints. Dean pauses, catching his eye; the vampire nods, and Dean slices away at his hand bindings too.
When Charlie leaves, Cas and Dean look at each other.
“You don’t like angels either, but you took me in,” he says, turning to look up at him. “Give her a chance.”
“Yes.”
“Oh. Of course,” Lisa says, glancing down and then back at his face. “I know we didn’t talk much about it tonight, Dean, but—Are you doing OK? With the one year anniversary and everything, I just want to make sure you’re in a good place.”
This is clearly not the reaction he was hoping for; Crowley’s smile slides off his face like honey.
He runs the ghoul back into the opposite counter, up against the kitchen island. The creature swipes his arm out to grab Dean’s chin, twisting his head away but throwing everything on the counter to the floor first, and a stack of plates shatter. Two mugs break and pieces go rolling all the way under the fridge. Dean glances at the mess, then back at the ghoul.
“Have you been using Location Services to spy on me?”
when he really wants—Dean would be a pile of maple-scented ash on this diner floor already. Instead Cas is silent for about five long, uncomfortable minutes; it makes Dean itch underneath the collar, even though Cas is probably just relishing in the environment he’s creating in this little diner booth between them. That knowledge does nothing to soothe the awkward feeling in his gut. Meanwhile Dean can feel the seconds ticking by like each individual one is crawling down his skin while he sits there, and Cas is a marble statue on the other side of the booth.
“Jen’s sister is getting married, so we’re all up here for the rehearsal dinner.”
“It didn’t take,” Cas says quietly, looking at the grass. “Maybe for a moment…but then you called out for my help again, and it’s like I fell even quicker than I had before. Like they only had a tenuous hold over me, but you broke through…”
Cas inclines his head.
“Oh, you’re not worried?” He can
“Yeah, I—I know.” Dean clears his throat. “And I...um…”
“I already told you, you’re not a coward,” Cas says, but it sounds like more of a command in his way. “So stop acting like one.”
“I got an eighty-five on my science test,” Ben offers after yet another extremely uncomfortable silence.
“As a matter of fact, ever since tall, dark and not-so-handsome put me on a special diet of his
Hannah nods and the angels converge on the box. Cas glances at the weapon, and then back at Dean.
“So what?” Dean asks, trying for levity; he chokes out a laugh, dry and bare and blatant once it’s out in the open. “You just defaulted to the first guy you saw? Like a duck?”
“No offense, but you really couldn’t sway my holy war one way or the other,” Cas says, glancing at the chotchkies on the mantle. That’s the kind of shit that hits the worst, the kind he says matter-of-factly. Dean sneers while it smarts. Cas’s eyes slide back over to him. “I just came to bring you this.”
He lights a joint that Dean nearly bit his head off earlier for spotting in the vicinity of his car and Dean absently passes him an empty beer bottle.
For a moment he basks in the sudden, comforting dark; then a quiet, deep laugh sounds from above, and Dean looks up from Cas’s naked chest to glare at his face.
“Mine didn’t fall,” Cas says, frowning up at him. “Metatron stole it.”
“We could play a game,” Cas suggests. One of them accidentally tore off the corner of a page when they were reading. He balls it up and flicks it across the table.
Dean goes to get them checked into a second floor Red Roof room that has a flickering light over the bathroom sink and a mini fridge he’s not convinced will be powerful enough to preserve all their carefully prepacked food. Dean grabs the first shower, so Cas scrounges a chicken veggie wrap and finishes the first episode of a very compelling dating show. This season is Valentine’s themed.
!” and turns around, frowning. “Mom, great news. God’s dead!”
. Not to mention the other ninety years that he’s been—”
They chat for another few minutes before the family makes their excuses and everybody promises to hang out for real once they’re all back in Indiana. When they’re walking again down the picturesque residential side street, Cas turns and looks at him up close.
They order pizza for lunch, and after a lengthy argument between Dean and Charlie about whether pineapple or anchovies taste better as topping, they get one of each and make Cas the tie breaker. He thinks that both of them have incredibly out-of-whack taste buds and picks off the anchovies to eat it plain.
“Check this out!” Dean calls. He’s crouched behind a long counter, and when he straightens up, there’s a half-full bottle of Jim Beam in his hand. “Score!”
“OK. Great.” Rolling his eyes, Dean throws the covers off. “I’m making eggs. Do you want any?”
“Good morning,” Lisa says. He pretends not to notice how her smile seems a little forced. “Are you hungry?”
Even though he brought it up, he takes a minute now to organize his thoughts.
“Really, I’ve made the angels’ to-do list?” says Dean, spreading his arms. “Keep saying stuff like that, I just might get a big head.”
Cas watches him, searching for signs of subterfuge, but Dean is sincere and so Cas gives a resigned sigh. This turn of events doesn’t surprise him completely. Dean hoists him off the table and onto his feet, and together they stumble into the big empty space Charlie created in the movie room where Dean grabs him by the sweatshirt, forcing him into movement. His smile is very very close.
Cas shrugs one shoulder.
“That’s not…” Dean interjected.
Getting ready for bed is such a chore when you’re tired, so Dean speedruns it so he can climb in and immediately curl up under the covers. Across the room, he hears Cas murmur goodnight, but when Dean looks he’s already alone.
He rolls his eyes. “Thank you, Captain Obvious. I didn’t know it was you!”
“No, slow like actually listen to me this time,” Dean said. He rummaged his spare pair of safety goggles out of his bag and slipped them over Cas’s head, even though Cas went cross-eyed in protest when he did it. “First step, don’t get your eyes poked out.”
“You should go to bed,” says Cas, resting his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
Cas blinks.
He tosses the phone down and sighs, turning to Charlie ready to commiserate—but she’s got her triangle lined up and aimed, and he startles, putting up his hands.
Three things happen in quick succession: Dean bolts for the door, Ishim rips free of Hannah’s slack arms, and Ishim roars,
“It’s just—I went into this with my eyes closed,” Cas says, shaking his head. Charlie frowns, shifting too to give him her full attention. “I thought I was doing this for the right reasons, I—I
“That line can’t possibly work for you,” Cas says, but it clearly does because he lets Dean distract him for minutes anyway, digging his fingers into Cas’s bedhead and twining their bodies together in the warm blanket cocoon they’ve made for each other all night. Finally his own hunger kicks in when he’s been awake long enough to welcome it, and he tucks himself against Dean’s side and swipes his phone off the nightstand to find their favorite pizza joint in Dean’s recent history.
“Well compared to everyone else at this table, you pretty much
“It’s chocolate cake,” Dean confides in her. “Sorry. I told Cas you preferred lemon meringue.”
“Why wouldn’t I want to?”
“Great.” Dean claps his shoulder, and then he hesitates. His palm drifts to cradle Cas’s cheek: This is all still very new to him. “Ready to go?”
That makes him pause. “It’s not?”
“Thank you,” he croaks.
a house appear?” Dean asks. “If you really wanted to, I mean.”
“Because Claire and Alex are in Wyoming, and they’re calling in the big guns,” Dean says grimly.
“They don’t
It isn’t long before the days slip into a rhythm. Family breakfast and the news; Ben goes to school or a friend’s house on weekends, and Dean works on the car unless they’re attending one of Ben’s soccer games; he and Lisa have a drink and chat most nights before splitting up for bed, after mostly silent afternoons. He’s sleeping six to eight hours these days, double what he’s had in years.
“Ex-demon,” Crowley crows.
“Yeah, I’m good,” he tells mostly to his glass of whiskey.
Cas flips his book closed and gets up to find his gear bag that’s stashed somewhere in his closet underneath the sewing things and a box of weird games he found on sale at the mall when he went shopping for Christmas presents. He and Dean have expanded their pre-case routines, to-do lists expanding with the flipping calendar.
“Aren’t we...going to the property?”
But when Dean lays them down, Cas wraps his arms around Dean’s neck and molds his body to his, and they kiss for awhile. Dean would normally keep trying to go farther but it seems an impossible task when Cas has his arms fastened around Dean’s neck, when he’s making soft happy sounds into Dean’s open mouth. It doesn’t seem worth it to try; what could he want other than this?
Cas plows on as though he doesn’t hear him.
Something is strange about Dean’s smile. He asks, “You know I can handle myself, right?”
Dean doesn’t look directly at him, eyes jumping from the floor to the door to the rest of the room down below. God, Cas really wants to beat that smug grin off Crowley’s mouth.
“If either of you were here, then I would have protected you,” he says, hard but nonplussed. He steps closer. “I’ll always protect you.”
thing, isn’t it?”
“Yeah, I’m…” Dean shakes his head. “It wasn’t...I wasn’t even having a
On his way back to the registers, glancing down aisles, a sign catches his eye and makes him pause. Backing up a step, Cas pauses—then wheels the cart around and halfway down the row. Finally curiosity gets the best of him, and he drops two buckets of paint and a huge canvas into his cart.
“Dean—”
In the morning, the news. Breakfast. Fix Baby’s tail lights. Tell Lisa about Death in Chicago. A cemetery got broken into and the cops found joints and an unopened condom wrapper there. Hash browns and eggs. Tweak the horn back to full volume. Lisa’s Sunday yoga has her finally flattening her palms to the floor when she bends over, a feat she’s very proud of. A kidnapped woman found alive. Fruit—cereal for Ben. Touch up the paint job where Dean got thrown into the door. Explain what a hellhound is. Local animal shelter hosting a fundraiser that weekend, looking for people to adopt their overflow of huskies. Blueberry pancakes. Replace the car’s oil. Reminisce on their weekend ten years ago over a bottle of sherry (it’s okay, because he shows her another good CD while they talk). Amnesiac woman kills her husband by dragging him behind their car. Sausage, egg and cheese.
“I distracted you?” he echoes, surprised enough to jolt out of his mood for a fraction of a second.
One of Raphael’s goons jumps out before he lands on his feet. Dean snarls with renewed fervor, fueled by his fury at the interruption, and presses his opponent back to the perimeter in seconds. He stabs him three times just to be safe.
“Yes, that is our rallying cry,” he says wryly, cracking a smile. “But it’s different for me. I’ve been at it longer...and it’s not just an abstract concept for me anymore. It’s tangible.”
The first thing Dean understands, when he jerks awake in his dark bedroom, is that his hands are shaking something fierce. The second thing is that there’s a warm touch on his chest that’s getting more and more familiar every single day.
Cute guy takes a step back. “Oh. You’re cops?”
Dean jerks the steering wheel, nearly driving them into oncoming traffic. Cas is a serene statue, open palms resting on his thighs. He looks over, his eyes just drifting from the open road to the driver’s side.
“Dean,” he admonishes. Dean puts up his hands in surrender. “It’s what we need to win this. Then we can finally go our separate ways.”
“It’s a beer tour,” Cas says. He touches Dean’s wrist to draw his attention. “Which do you like better?”
After they eat they watch TV together, or Ben goes to a friend’s while Dean and Lisa have drinks and chat, or Dean sits in the yard and thinks out into the dark night while Ben and Lisa sit inside talking at the dining table, their heads together and mugs of tea in their hands. Dean has a nightmare, or he doesn’t; either way Cas doesn’t visit him at night anymore. Dean doesn’t think about that, either.
“Dean,” Lisa and Cas both say, sharply and slightly exasperated, respectively, and then Lisa closes her eyes, breathes out, and tells Ben, “We didn’t want to worry you.”
“That’s a sad testament to the rest of your relationships.” Cas squints to the right, toward nothing but highway and trees. “Besides, it wasn’t friends that I was worried about.”
“I’m sorry,” she says, meeting his eyes. “I just need to buy myself some time. I don’t want to hurt you either. I didn’t want to hurt any of them.”
Dean grunts. But he doesn’t have a choice: He only pauses for a few seconds before he’s back scribbling into the dirt. Another scream rips through the camp, and then a different sound: Lower, just as loud as the first. This one seems to come from the bowels of the earth—or whatever it is they’re standing on.
He wonders if Cas could simply think a house into being on his behalf. He’s curious, because right now Cas seems just as content to do the heavy lifting with his hands: Dean watches him heave a wall into place for Dean to drill together with the other side.
Dean flips his book shut: That means no dice. He’s already grumpy because Cas brought up Azazel again, and Dean gets his back up at the mere mention of his comatose brother going darkside once upon a time. This makes it very difficult to have a productive conversation.
“Yeah, just some pathetic not-woman mourning the loss of her girl,” Dean says, shrugging out of his jacket.
“Most of the time it’s only done by...couples. Sometimes parents and kids, but mostly, you know...You know!” he says, flustered and annoyed. Cas finally smiles, saving him from going on.
“I could come back tomorrow,” he offers, the first word he’s said in nearly ten minutes.
“Why?”
Cas breathes through his nose.
“What are you doing?” Dean asks when he turns off the TV to go toss his garbage.
“Do you think they’re gonna hunt you down?”
“That’s not what I came to talk about,” he says gravely.
“We will buy you more lamps,” Cas says gravely. “Though perhaps we should wait until the end of the weekend.”
“Like I said, I’m awesome,” Dean says sharply. “My house is really coming together, and I’ve got a steady job. It’s exactly what I was picturing, Bobby, it’s freaking perfect.”
“Bothers me? Nah,” Dean says, rocking on his feet. “It
“Well what did
This makes Cas smile in that slow, thoughtful way that he does.
way imaginable…”
“I’m just being honest, Dean,” he says, not sure why Dean’s looking at him like that. After riding Cas so much over the past several years about telling him the truth, always, he looks a little strange now that Cas actually is. “You know I always appreciate our talks and our time together.”
There’s a pause.
“Cas?” he asks, kind of lazily kissing his jaw, kind of just lying there and watching his fingers trace the bumps of Cas’s ribs underneath his bared skin.
“What? I know,” Dean says, shaking his head. “I didn’t...I mean, of course they are.”
“Well,” Dean says, holding up his hands. “I guess this is my lucky day. Five of you bottom-feeding sons of bitches all in one. What did I do to deserve such a warm welcome?”
“I saw it, Cas! I saw—” But Dean cuts himself off and turns away, cussing. He runs his hand over his mouth. Cas waits patiently, no stranger to Dean’s mercurial mood swings; when he finally looks back, his eyes are closed. Another telltale sign that he’s blowing everything out of proportion. “Back when Zachariah was trying to get me to say yes to Michael.”
Before he can think himself out of it, Dean takes the sides of his face in either hand—he’s still standing close enough that he barely has to reach out—brings Cas close, and kisses him. Cas is warm and resolute against him, his mouth firm, his hands grasping. He keeps stroking the sides of Dean’s face, leaning all of his weight into him and touching him the way Dean imagines he did the first time Cas put him back together: Reverent, greedy, sure.
“Good morning,” Cas says, smiling at him.
“Closing up Heaven, you mean?”
“Where are you going?”
“Um, obviously, dude,” Dean chuckles. Was there ever a doubt? Cas asked, so Dean will help in any way that he can. He kind of owes the guy a million times over, and anyway—Well, anyway. It’s

Cas waited until they’d cut up the wood and Dean was grabbing another from the pile, a brief respite from the noise of the power saw.
for not being supportive?” Dean says finally in a low, dark voice. “Sam’s in a coma!”
“For the last time, I don’t want your weird pizza.”
“Well, yeah, but that doesn’t mean it’s any easier to deal with,” Charlie says. She claps Cas on the arm, and her touch lingers. “Let’s do something else. Do you like peppermint vodka?”
“How do you do it, Dean?” he asks quietly. “Handle all of this so easily...”
“I never said that you were inconvenient, Dean!”
“Castiel has us,” Hannah intones.
Cas’s expression is bordering on hilarious: He looks simultaneously like the entirety of the English language dropped straight out of his vocabulary and like he’s never wanted anything more than to spend the night in ratty sweatpants pretending not to watch a guy sleep.
“By being here for you!” he says, his voice cracking down the middle. Against his instincts, Cas’s heart jumps at the sound. “By giving you space to do your thing.”
The witch, who calls herself Sophie, loses her shawl on the rolling chair and leans back against the desk. Her legs are long and exposed, drawing the eye as she crosses them and raises her glass. Cas, painfully aware of her leer without the distractions of the club around them, drinks more of his cocktail than is perhaps considered polite when he
“Dean keeps having these truly horrific nightmares,” Cas informs her gravely. “I was bringing him something to help with that.”
“You’d better wait outside for me to cut your head off,” Dean warns him, even though he knows that he won’t.
“I’m writing back,” Dean says, pulling out his phone.
“And what do you know about building, huh, Cas?”
“Lucky for you, I got a spare bag in my shed.” Dean beamed at him, feeling smug, because he had a shed.
Cas smiles at him, warm as the noon sun. Dean smiles back and gets going with the salads.
“I don’t want to hear it,” Dean says, suddenly sure that he can’t deal with this at all. He puts his hands up and steps around him, shrugging away from the insane intensity of his stare. “I don’t need you, Cas.”
This prompts Cas to try his too. He considers and pulls a face.
Dean flinches. “Don’t put it like that,” he complains.
“I’m fine, Cas,” he says, turning his face away. “I barely even think about—”
“What?” Dean looks behind him to the hallway like he’ll see something else, something more celestial and important there. Dean’s never even
Dean’s already shaking his head.
“At the end of the hallway.”
Two months after Dean moves into Lisa’s, he gets a job: Four days a week on a construction crew, mostly fixing up poolhouses or adding on units over on the rich side of town. Three weeks after that, Dean celebrates his fourth nightmare-free sleep in a row. He thinks that drinking a large glass of whiskey before bed is his lucky charm.
“I’m handling it!” Dean snaps.
Dean covers his eyes with one shaking hand.
Dean looks at him for a long time. Maybe he can’t think of anything to say to that, or he can’t make himself give voice to it. He twists Cas’s shirt tighter and drags him down to his waiting mouth.
, he warns himself. He is not feeling very angelic today.
I gave you.”
He can hear himself breathing; Dean studiously examines the floor. His expression won’t break, though: He looks like he wants to shove Cas up against the wall in a bad way, and now he probably could. He looks like he’s going to storm out and go solve a case guns-first. Probably could do that, too. Cas wishes he had his powers back. Cas wishes a lot of things, since going to Hell.
The lightning crackles down with a sound like a brutal gunshot beside the ear. The witch’s head snaps up to the window, and then she’s standing over Dean, glowering.
“It doesn’t incapacitate you,” Cas says, pacing away from him like he’s going to bolt out the front door. Instead he just whirls around. “You’re not in a coma.”
“That’s enough,” Dean snaps. “I have enough to worry about without you two bickering on either shoulder. Christ, when did my life become a cartoon?”
“The King of Hell,” Cas grumbles into his coffee.
“I did hear about this thing from Jody that sounds like it could be a
It’s fitting, Dean thinks. He hopes that when the sky inevitably opens up, the hurricane soaks him to the bone. He hopes it’s chilly, he hopes it’s torrential. It’s not even a fraction of what Sam’s been through since Dean let him jump one year ago to the day.
. He hides it underneath the blanket and pretends to be gathering it closer. “Just—What do you need?”
“It wasn’t a lucid dream until I came here. It was a nightmare,” Cas says. “That’s...actually why I’m here. You were saying my name while you slept.”
“Hey, if you’re looking to apologize for yanking me out of Hell, look somewhere else, pal. I ain’t complaining.”
“No, we’re heading out soon,” Dean says. “It’s about a two and a half hour drive—Lisa, who do you think you’re talking to? Yeah, Cas is glued to the weather report every morning. I know…”
“Are you angry that I have business up there?” Cas asks him now.
Cas is wearing his
“Hey.”
“So, what? You need me to go in and retrieve it for you?”
“You told me,” Dean reminds him. This time when he tries to loosen Cas’s grip on his shirt, Cas lets him pull free. But his hands linger, covering Cas’s, for a few precious seconds. “You’re becoming human.”
“Huh.” Cas tips his head, drinking his beer. “Ex-angel hunters.”
at him. Stubborn, prickly sonofabitch—
Dean’s mouth drops open, and he tugs on Cas’s elbow, still in his grip. With the corners of his mouth turning up in a smile, Cas twists out of his hold so he can take Dean’s hand.
“I’m sorry. It’s just more intense than it used to be,” Cas explains. “I assume losing my grace had something to do with it. It’s not as dull anymore, it’s just...it’s always there. Maybe I’m only noticing it more often because I have all these other, new human considerations that should take precedence in my head, but I always find myself...” He blows out a heavy breath, eyes unspacing out to roll back to Charlie. “Distracted.”
get better.” Dean’s voice is gruff, but he realizes now that his chin has started wobbling, too. It’s too late. “Ever. It’s all I think about, it’s all I
It’s awkward for a beat. Cas clears his throat, and his voice is lower when he says, “I wasn’t talking about the cage, Dean.”
It’s not funny, but he laughs anyway. Then that makes Cas laugh, and then they’re doing it harder, and Dean’s bent over the table trying to get a grip on himself if only to stop his ribs from hurting.
? Where my family lives?!”
“Sorry.” Dean pulls a face. “I don’t think they stock up on heavenly bombshells in the homegoods aisle.”
“Yes! Exactly.” Dean throws his arms out, then pauses. His brow furrows. “I think.”
tw: ptsd, weed & alcohol, lesbianism shoehorned in with determination and hard work, depression, who’s sam? and liberal references to op’s obnoxious interests
“Are you finally learning to run it by me first before you do something stupid?” Dean asks. He glances over and sees Cas’s face, then does a double-take. “What’s wrong? You’re acting weird. Well, weirder than usual.”
“Just once won’t hurt them.”
“Who?” he demands. “Who have you been talking to? Who are you afraid of?”
So he makes himself at home in Dean’s arms and gets to creating.
Cas shoves him in his bad shoulder again. Dean jerks it away.
“Just...watch a sport for once in your life,” Dean sighs.
“This is Lieutenant Nile.”
As they run, Dean snags two angel blades off a table that’s boasting a few other weapons Dean wouldn’t begin to know how to work but absolutely wants Cas to teach him to fire off. Raphael’s own turncoats are slipping out of hiding around camp, holding knives to angels’ necks. Dean slices two of them as he passes by and gets caught in a tussle with three others who close ranks around him. Dean disarms them with his two blades and cuts open their necks, then slips by before the last one even hits the floor.
“You’re kissing me,” Cas concludes brilliantly. He’s not rejecting it; by contrast, he holds Dean closer. “You argued with me the whole drive here. You hate my TV show. And I’m keeping you awake.”
“Nothing. We just finished clearing the table,” Lisa says, smiling brightly. She tries to act natural when she eases into the room, not like they ran in to make sure that her weird friend’s awkward immortal boyfriend isn’t sharing any of his whiskey with her average teenage son. “What are you boys playing?”
“I won’t.” Cas wears contrite well. He seems smaller in his coat, and he glances up and down like a child. It makes Dean relent before he wants to; it makes him want to reach out, although he doesn’t know what he could possibly do.
“Cas, I hate to break this to you, but you’re not an angel anymore. You’re not strong enough.”
“Can we smoke this together?” he asks.
They make it back to the bunker in the early afternoon the next day. Dean gives Cas a room down the hall and then points him in the direction of the showers. He’ll have to borrow...everything. Man, being a human is expensive.
He finally, mercifully, meets Samandriel in the middle. The angel barely touches his shoulder, muttering, “Go, Dean!” before Dean takes off running for the center of camp.
The doorway’s hidden under some leaves beneath a marked tree, which he has to look around a bit for because the angels were a bit cryptic (read: completely fucking useless) with the exact location. Debris litters the floor and greenery climbs the walls inside the underground tunnel, and it’s dark but Dean doesn’t want to risk a flashlight shining through the crack at the end of the passage. He uses the weak glow of his phone screen to make sure he’s not going to trip or run headlong into a monster but it’s still a relief when he sees the other door come up on him around a curve. He can hear the TV more clearly now too.
“Three days.”
“Stop calling for me. I’m busy,” Cas says furiously, sticking one finger in Dean’s face. Then he disappears in a flurry of wings.

They enjoy the episode while they eat; or at least Cas does, and Dean doesn’t complain enough to ruin the show. He doesn’t get into it, but he bears Cas’s theories and exclamations with indulgent smiles and a warm shoulder against his own. Dean cleans up for them and gets ready for bed, and then convinces Cas to get ready for lights out too because Claire and Alex will be here early in the morning and they need one of them to book a room next door, neither one being eighteen for a few more months. Dean still doesn’t like minors coming here alone, which is another reason why he drove to meet them.
“Shut up!” He stabs him again, and again, trying to make him stop… “Just shut up!”
“I told them not to send any more angels,” she says, an edge to her voice that he thinks sounds like
“I just meant that you missed Saturday,” Dean said, ducking his head to remeasure the plank of wood on the worktable. He wanted to put a saw through this by ten. “You should really call if you’re gonna stand me up.”
want my freedom. I didn’t ask to tune into angel radio—”
“We want the location of the Alphas, yes, but I didn’t realize that that was what Hannah met by reconnaissance.” Cas sounds exasperated. “Dean, look at me!”
Bobby scoffs. “How are you
Cas rolls his eyes, bereft of anything to toss at him and too far to pinch his side or sock him on the shoulder. He turns away and cleans the pitcher under his hands with a wet rag.
“How much longer?” Dean demands of Hannah, who’s nearest.
Dean shakes his head, dropping it down between his shoulders. With a playful grunt, he yanks on Cas’s shirt until he tips forward.
And then he hangs up.
“Yeah, well, we’ve gone farther for less,” Dean sighs. “Thanks, Bobby.”
“I also cleaned the kitchen,” he offers.
no secret. That it’s all just something he has to learn.
“I don’t understand this game,” Cas says. “Why is this ace a losing move? Usually when we play, it’s a trump card.”
“Cas,” he asks eventually.
It’s fitting, Dean thinks. He hopes that when the sky inevitably opens up, the hurricane soaks him to the bone. He hopes it’s chilly, he hopes it’s torrential. It’s not even a fraction of what Sam’s been through since Dean let him jump one year ago to the day.
“I just…” Dean swipes a hand over his face. “I don’t know what you want from me. I can’t…”
“What do you mean? You’ve told me about the little project you’ve got going on up there.”
“All the same, I’m glad you’re getting a little R & R,” Benny says. “Right, Castiel?”
“It’s mean-spirited,” he tells Dean flatly.
“No, I’m meeting Charlie tomorrow,” Dean says. “She’s gonna help me out on this one.”
“You come down here, and you—you tell me that most of the time, you wanna be here. With me,” says Dean. “But then you keep running off to play soldier again—”
All’s quiet on the homefront for a long time. He’s settling in alright at Lisa’s, once they get into a steady rhythm. They watch the news over breakfast, although some days Lisa trades it in for her favorite soap opera instead. She watches
“Cool. That’s—That’s great.”
Dean frowns. His eyes are on the burgers he’s flipping when he asks, “What, the angels’ personal lapdog?”
“I just thought that...it would help.”
“Hm? No,” Cas says. “I’m texting Charlie.”
“OK...What does that mean?”
-angel. Why should you get a second chance when I don’t?”
bad.”
“A half-snake woman?”
Cas doesn’t have many of those. It’s too warm for a winter coat, and the only other jacket he owns is a sweatshirt with weird stick figures on it, which Dean informed him were created by some artist called Keith Haring. Cas still hasn’t gotten around to becoming more familiar with his work, but he shrugs that on and meets Dean in the study.
“Flirting for tips, I imagine,” Cas says, bored. Dean spends half his days up in the bar now that Cas and Sam are both back in working order and fighting fit. Without anybody to mother hen, he turns his paternal instincts on a crowd of new drunk best friends.
“So you’re just gonna sit there and watch me sleep?” he demands.
“OK, OK, I’ll stop giving you trouble,” Lisa laughs, warm and familiar in his ear. “Give Castiel my love too.”
“I need to finish making dinner,” she says finally. “Will you be okay?”
Cas sighs. “OK.”
“Seriously? I knew it!” she says. She smacks Jody on the arm. Jody shouts, “
“Get out of my face,” he grumbles, pushing him back into his chair. Cas stabs his next bite of dinner unnecessarily hard.
“It’s to help you with your nightmares,” Cas says, inclining his head.
Cas narrows his eyes. “Really?”
“What does that mean?” Dean asks impatiently.
“I just assumed…”
“To pick up chicks, man.”
“Yeah, yeah. Go,” she insists.
Dean watches him for a long moment. His thumb traces circles behind Cas’s ear, and he memorizes the way he looks right now, with the bright South Dakota moon painting his dark face with pale light. For once, Cas looks as eternal and powerful as he really is, and Dean can’t fathom why it is something like him would ever choose to stay here and give up paradise for
Benny’s grip is firm, his smile pleased, his expression unbothered.
“Don’t you?” he demands, and touches Dean’s shoulder. Dean winces, flinching away. “You are
“The angels wouldn’t bother cutting off her head. Give me a chance to prove it to you,” says the vampire. “I’ll tell you where I’ll be. You catch even one hint of a slip-up in the area, and I’ll surrender myself to you in an instant. All I want is to be given a second chance. I wasted my first one thinking about her.”
“It’s not easy for me like it is for you!” Dean bursts, spinning around to face him. “I don’t...I don’t know how to do this. With you.”
“Robert Callahan Jr.,” Cas answers immediately. He looks at Dean. “He lives in Clifden.”
“Hey, Winchester!”
“It’s not too late to power up the weapon, right?” Dean asks, trying to gather up all of his work stuff which has somehow scattered all around the motel room since yesterday afternoon.
Cas huffs an exhausted laugh.
He’s stripped down low for bed and answers the door that way for their delivery. Claire’s in the adjacent doorway, paying some pimply kid for two large pizzas, and she glances over Cas with an unreadable but slightly distasteful expression. Frowning down at himself, he misses when Claire closes the door without comment—and in his fluster, accidentally tips the delivery guy 40%.
“Woah, it’s early,” Alex says, patting her sister on the back with some concern.
Cas frowns, wishing he hadn’t flicked away the paper so he had something to fiddle with.
The UPS guy dropped off a new couch this morning. They’ve already argued about moving the TV into the living room now that it’s finished—argued about it a shitload of times.
His jaw works.
That’s how they end up knocking feet beneath the table at the closest iHop, Dean digging into a huge stack of pancakes while Cas stares and picks at his bacon and stares. It used to be impossible to eat in front of the guy, but he’s used to the big blue eyes routine by now.
Cas’s brow creases just so when he’s thinking about what to say. Dean fights the urge to tell him to spit it out, because all that’s likely to get him is Cas zapping out of here before he finishes the thought. Dean used to be able to brush that stuff off, but it’s lonelier out here with nobody around. Living with Lisa and Ben was a classic case of not knowing how good he had it ‘til it was gone. Now he just looks at Cas’s constipated expression and tries to find a port of patience in a veritable hurricane.
Cas reaches over and puts his hand on Dean’s wrist.
“Hey, Lisa.”
They sizzle the overhead light to nothing and crack Dean’s phone screen right down the middle where it’s sitting a little too close on the bedside table. Afterwards, when he’s feeling boneless and satisfied and like Cas is the most important not-a-person in the entire world, Dean curls around him and kisses him for another twenty minutes just because he can.
“So?” he asks, shrugging one shoulder.
“It’s OK, Dean,” he murmurs, nose brushing, meandering up toward Dean’s neck. “You’re OK, you’re awake now. You’re here with me.”
“What the hell was that? Huh?” he demands. “What are a couple of angels doing torturing vamps in the basement?”
“Dean,” he commands. “Listen to me. I think Sam
“I’m not stupid, Dean,” he reminds him in a low voice. “I know what holding hands mean and I can follow a simple conversation.” Dean clears his throat, shifting, but the back of his hand is still in the same place when Cas’s fingers reach down and brush it. In that same slow, melodic drift Cas adds, “And these feelings...they’re not
“Just one,” Cas promises. He sits up and pulls Dean to him by the back of his neck.
“I understand, Dean,” he says fervently. “I won’t ask you for any more help.”
Dean makes sure Miracle has enough food for a couple of weeks, even though Sam’s more than capable of looking after her himself. He packs enough premade food that he doesn’t have to live off corner store sandwiches (Dean long survived on the road but, like his exposure to Cas, now spoiled he’ll get short if he goes without homemade dinners) and carefully chooses which extra books to bring for leisure, which he hides in the bottom of his suitcase so Cas can pretend not to see them. He’s learning many lessons, taking solo hunts with Dean.
Sometimes Cas is so very much—just, his
Dean catches his eye for a second, but it burns in his throat and he swiftly looks away.
“There was only so long I could take it,” Cas says quietly, his eyelids heavy. “Dropping by here, spending time with you...There was only so long I could hold onto that feeling, to keep it inside. It was bound to burst out eventually. I thought it every time you smiled, every time I spent the night in your bed, every time I brought you lunch at work. That day just happened to be the day I couldn’t take it anymore.”
“Of course he is,” he says, throwing his arm around Cas’s shoulder. “He can’t resist a good homecooked meal.”
“Ah,” he groans quietly.
“Well...Yes,” he says, glancing around as if for answers to Dean’s rising tone. “We’d never just hope and not have a plan.”
“I thought so.” Cas slides him a look. “Dean threw it on the ground.”
Alex is a grumpy but clearly bright young woman who mostly sits by the fire and uses her phone rapid-fire without looking at any of the adults. Donna goes to occupy her after awhile, pretending she doesn’t notice that Alex dumped all the soda out of the can she’s holding and filled it up with beer instead. Dean hears the girl ask if she can take off early to go meet up with a couple of friends. Jody and Bobby are sitting on the other side of the flames, huddled close together beneath a thick blanket and talking in low voices. Dean realizes that he hasn’t seen Cas in awhile; he finds him in the kitchen, picking at a nicely arranged platter of cheese and crackers.
“When I told you to stick around, I didn’t think you’d actually be stupid enough to do it,” Dean shouts, not unkindly.
Lisa closes her eyes. She takes a deep breath.
Cas smokes and stares at the ceiling when he eventually makes it back into bed; he toys briefly with the idea of going to sleep early, then decides against it. Dean lent him a tape a little awhile ago; he puts it in his music player and tries to focus on the lyrics, but he’s finding it difficult to focus tonight.
“Have I mentioned how badly you need a hobby?” Dean asks, pausing in the doorway. “You’re turning into such a nerd.”
“I can...crash on the floor,” Dean says.
doesn’t have a place between your ribs?
Cas’s mouth pulls up in a sneer, but before he can reach out and slam Crowley’s head into the table, Dean pulls him back. His hand splays on Cas’s chest, right over his pounding heart, and he shoves Cas back.
“You don’t have to do penance,” Cas tells him. “I’d rather you asked me.”
“Shh, shh. Oh, Dean. It’s okay. It’s gonna be okay,” Lisa’s telling him, right in his ear—all the usual bullshit people say when somebody’s upset at their feet. All of it just batters at his armor and falls right down to the floor, cracked in half straight down the middle. Dean gasps and claws at her, mindless, for a while.
“He trusts me,” he says shortly. “Don’t embarrass yourself, Crowley. I’m not jealous of a demon.”
“You think your purpose in life is...to do bad art?” Dean catch’s sight of his expression and his eyes widen. “No, no, that’s not what I meant!”
look. Dean shakes his head and climbs into the empty side of the bed, touching the bedside lamp to turn it off. He expects Cas to disappear now, or at least go to the other room and entertain himself all night. Instead, he hears clothes rustling together. The other side of the mattress shifts. A gentle touch lands on his left shoulder.
“No,” he says. “I mean, I hope not. We want information on Metatron.”
“What are you doing here?” Dean asks around a yawn.
Dean rolls his eyes. “She’s fine, Cas. She and Alex probably sneak way more than two beers at Jody’s.”
despite everything in between, Dean couldn’t think of one thing to say here, staring up at the pale blue morning, side by side in the aftermath of it all.
“You’re upset because you’re beginning to appreciate what Taylor Swift has to say,” Cas surmises, and won’t be dissuaded from this horrifying train of thought.
“Do we have a deal?” Benny asks.
One of the phones in Cas’s side drawer rings. He pulls it open and checks the caller ID.
Cas still can’t tell if he’s being insulted or not, but Dean’s cute when he’s flustered. He relents to Dean’s diversion despite being aware of the neon sign.
“Creation is the reason that existence started. It’s why we’re all here,” he explains. “So maybe it’s the reason I exist, too.”
Cas shrugs. It makes him sway on his one planted foot.
This isn’t what Dean was expecting. He doesn’t know what he was expecting, but definitely not that. His hand freezes and he splays it out on Cas’s chest, using it to push himself up so he can stare down at him.
“It’s Enochian. It means something...not very nice,” Cas tells him. He steps back so Dean can stand on his own weight, at a distance.
“Cas, I—” His throat works as he swallows and looks at the wall. Cas keeps his hands on Dean’s shirt but loosely, not pulling. Anchoring.
There’s bacon and eggs on the stove and toast on the table; Ben’s digging into a slice overloaded with butter and scribbling in a math workbook. Dean glances at it as he passes by and wrinkles his nose. Long division—Gross.
But Cas glances over his shoulder right when Dean looks up from arranging plastic cutlery on a tray and catches his eye. The sunlight is landing on his hair just so, and he looks like a completely different person in a t-shirt with a beach on it and big, cartoonish letters reading
“We are,” Cas says. “How’s research going?”
He looks up to find Dean in the doorway with his arms crossed, debating on a smile. Cas mimes a phone and Dean’s face crumples in confusion.
“Down, boy,” he says mildly. Dean’s gun clicks, and Crowley puts up his hands. “No need to test out your trigger finger there, Dean. I come in peace.”
“I love you,” Cas says.
“Alright, I’m taking the chaperone to bed,” Dean announces. He grabs the beer. “Girls, I’m taking the six pack. You can have
“But you’re not up there helping them now.”
“Nothing, nothing,” he murmurs, shaking out the paper to read the ad. “Just didn’t know you knew the meaning of the word.”
Cas sighs, small and content. Dean strokes his hands down Cas’s thighs where they’re spread over his lap and looks at the ceiling and breathes while Cas puts his mouth on Dean’s neck; he shouldn’t be thinking of things like dead brothers and whether or not he’s got graveyard dirt caked beneath his nails when he’s got Cas moaning into every kiss and half-naked on top of him, but it’s hard to screw his head on straight tonight. The room feels like it’s spinning. He shouldn’t have had so much whiskey, but then, he didn’t expect the night to go like this either.
“The residual effects of the full moon’s power will continue for twelve hours in either direction,” says Cas. He glances down at his shirt, plucking at the mountain range. “I suppose I should change into something a little more professional.”
It’s a ghost possession case, the kind that stains his nailbeds with ectoplasm for a week no matter how hard he scrubs at them in the shower. Dean gets through it without any major life-threatening scares, but he does get knocked in the head and the bitch slashes at his shoulder, so that’s bleeding into his jacket while his ears ring the whole way home. His bum shoulder gets zapped with a lightning flash of pain every time he jiggles the wheel just so; it’s only ten minutes back to Lisa’s, but it sucks major ass.
Then finally, Cas says, “Hael, now,” clenches his fist, and steps back while the woman throws a vial into the ingredient bowl. Cas tosses in the golden blade for good measure, and the light in the barn explodes.
It was a long, cold stretch of months running away from him. Pretending like he couldn’t hear. How often did Cas want to fly to make sure he was alright—or to help him when he definitely wasn’t? Now he lives just down the hall, and they can’t talk to each other at all.
“Thank you, Dean,” he says seriously.
Dean doesn’t bother trying to temper down the grin he throws at Ishim, who snarls in reply.
