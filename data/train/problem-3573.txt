A massive smile comes to his face as he hears the Impala get closer, and then come to a fast stop just in front of them. It revs twice more before idling.
But now memories flash through Sam’s mind. Dean and Cas sharing flirtatious smiles. Dean completely breaking down each time Cas died. How much he hated Jack because of it. The looks that were a little too intense, the hugs that lasted a little too long, the way they stood a little too close to each other. Sam always thought it was just that Cas didn’t understand personal space, but now it occurs to Sam that Dean had stopped moving away when Cas stood too close; Dean sometimes leans closer even.
Time and space suddenly lurch under Dean. In a single instant, a million things happen. Cas kisses back, he says he isn’t ready, they drive several hours with Sam and Jack, they investigate a few blocks, Naughty Edith gets her head scratches and leaves, they find a body, and then Chuck has then pinned against the wall, all within an instant.
“This is weird.”
“Dean’s fairly open about pursuing women.”
Sam finally gets a grasp on it, and brings it up out of the water. It’s shiny and has a dark cord, and the whole thing is covered in seaweed. Sam pulls the seaweed off of it as he walks out of the water and back toward them.
“Oh… You” the ghost facer says upon seeing Sam. He doesn’t seem to recognize Cas. “What do you want now?” He asks Sam.
Sam laughs while Cas responds with a small smile. Dean can’t help but feel disappointed.
“Please,” Sam responds, “Could we maybe speak to the boss, or whatever?” The TV switches to an image of Dr. Sexy looking contemplative. Then the volume cranks up all the way and it hurts Sam’s ears as the scene switches to a doctor yelling into a phone, “come back to me!” Sam thinks this might be the show calling to the boss but he really isn’t sure. It could mean the piece is already gone? Sam really hopes it’s the prior.
“Her name’s Naughty Edith.” Cas tells them. And it’s no less weird hearing it the second time.
With his heart breaking, Sam realizes it’s Dean as a kid. Jeez, he’s probably only four.
Once they’re close to the reception desk, a nice TV sat behind it comes to life, the volume increases and Sam recognizes Dr. Sexy M.D. on the screen.
“Romantic love, self-love, things he loves, and compassionate love; the love he feels toward strangers, people he’s obligated towards but not friends with.” Sam doesn’t know who would be the guardians of those places. Romantic is probably Lisa? But Dean hasn’t seen her in years. Still, she’s the person he’s loved most in that way, Sam thinks. Self-love must be Dean, right? And Sam has no idea what to expect from things and strangers. He knows he and Cas and Dean wouldn’t give Michael the heart pieces. But he doesn’t know about Lisa, or whoever’s in charge of objects and strangers. Hell, could the objects even stop Michael?
Cas turns to Sam. “The real Jimmy blames me and himself, not Dean. But we won’t be able to convince Dean’s sub-conscience of that.”
“Yeah no kidding.” Sam smiles at that. He looks at Cas’s face, and can tell he’s thinking hard about something. “What?”
“Yeah we’re okay, Dean.” Sam reassures him but Psyche-Dean doesn’t look convinced.
“No you aren’t, you’re just trapped in your own head.” Dean shrugs like it’s no big deal. “Just let us help you!”
At that moment Psyche-Dean with the necklace grabs them and drags them sprinting to the back of the office under the cover of distraction.
“Dean,” Cas says, even as he looks at himself. “I know you can’t. I understand because I can’t either.” Sam’s mind hones in on that statement, pausing on it but not quite understanding. “But it doesn’t matter what you can or can’t do. Because you
“Not even that pretty face makes up for asking so rudely.”
At this point Sam notices that somewhere along the way, he and Cas have ended up sitting in chairs in front of Psyche-Cas’s desk. He doesn't remember how that happened but it's the least of his concerns right now.
Out of the mist they approach another door.
Before Sam approaches he notices that this office looks smaller than the others. He can’t see the whole thing, but he can tell. And it makes sense, Dean’s certainly had a lot fewer romantic interests than friends or strangers he’s saved or even people he considers family.
“It’s the cassette you made me.” Dean immediately remembers the one Cas is talking about. The mixtape of Dean’s favorite Led Zeppelin tracks. “I lost it when I died, when Jack was born.”
“How? We don’t know how to find where they are.”
“So do you.” Cas says, looking at Dean’s nightcap. “I found a lead on Amara.”
“What was that!?” Sam shouts, sounding rather frantic.
“I’d like to go.” Jack says with a smile, completely oblivious to the teasing he just helped Dean avoid.
It’s cold, ice cold, but it doesn’t particularly bother Dean. The instant his skin first touches the water, he hears the siren song. Not literally, but he thinks he hears it in his heart. It calls to him, and he thinks that maybe if he goes deeper into the water than the others, perhaps the waves will return to him something more.
“It might help.” Chuck defends, before time again halts, reverses, and restarts with Dean in his pajamas eating crepes.
Unsurprisingly, it’s another door.
Cas looks totally unfazed by the whole thing, but when he sees Dean, an amused smile breaks out on his face and he looks Dean up and down (careful to move only his eyes and not his head, lest he upset the cat), as though Dean is the weird-looking one in this situation!
“I think you’re right.” Cas tells Sam after a bout of silence. “I think Dean’s saving the more difficult ones for last.”
Dean looks back toward Cas, standing in the waves and staring out to the sea. And Dean’s heart is briefly gripped with terror. For a moment, Dean sees Castiel, black veins wrapping around his neck like tentacles, holding up his arms and wading in deeper and deeper.
It’s difficult for Dean walking through the sand in his boots, but Cas walks slower than he has to, keeping pace with Dean.
“When I went to heaven to save Jack. What I didn’t tell you was that the cosmic entity that rules over the Empty came for him.” Cas sighs and looks off into space at the memory. “Being that he’s part angel, the entity felt it had a claim on him. I made a deal, for it to take me instead. But instead of taking me right then and there, the entity wanted me to suffer. It told me it will come for me when I’ve forgotten about it, when I finally allow myself to be happy.”
“Bite me.” Dean spits back.
“He’s coming.” The ghost facer tells him rudely, but Sam doesn't particularly care.
“I can’t believe it actually worked.” Sam says as he holds the necklace out to Dean.
Sam leans toward Cas and whispers, “Why is it an office?”
“I don’t know if anything of mine is lost.” Jack says thoughtfully. “The things I’ve lost are gone and I’ve accepted that.” Jack says. But just as he’s finishing, something catches his eye a few steps down the beach.
Before he can talk himself out of it, Dean closes the distance between them and takes Cas’s face in his hands. The moment their lips meet—
“You’re kidding, right?” Sam asks Cas. No way did Cas actually not know he was Dean’s best friend. Cas doesn’t respond. “You seriously didn’t know?” And now that Sam sees how serious Cas is and thinks about it, it makes him sad. How could Cas not know?
He’s barely three feet tall and 40 pounds for Christ’s sake and their Dad treated him like a soldier.
“Cas, you’re the best friend Dean’s ever had. I’m his brother and he loves me like crazy and we’re friends but it’s different than what you two have.”
“Supernatural musical?” Cas asks, brow furrowed in confusion.
“No.” He answers simply. “There are reasons that myth spread, but those reasons aren’t terribly important right now.” Dean can practically feel Cas’s eyes on the back of his head. “Dean…”
Dean’s not sure how long it takes, it simultaneously feels like forever and no time at all, but Cas eventually pulls out of the kiss slowly. Still, he remains just a breath away. Dean slowly opens his eyes to see Cas’s are still closed. He watches until Cas opens his, and they lock onto each other. It’s exactly like every other time they’ve looked into each other’s’ eyes, but also so different.
“Hey” Sam says giddily. This is weird and the situation is serious, but he can’t contain his absolute delight at this. “Good to see you.” He tells the car. It honks back quietly twice in response, which only causes Sam to smile wider. The Impala sits there idling, and Sam can almost tell it’s waiting for them to explain themselves. He doesn’t know how, he just feels it from the car. “We’re trying to collect all the different hearts so we can talk to Dean. Could we have the heart you have?”
“Sam and Cas are here. They want to talk about taking the heart, I guess they need it to help Dean… Okay I’ll bring them over.” Lisa hangs up and smiles up at them as she stands. “Follow me.” She tells them.
“So what now?” Jack asks.
“A deal’s only binding until it isn’t.” Sam retorts. Cas doesn't respond again right away, but he maintains eye contact with Sam the whole time.
He’s not sure why, but the reasons don’t seem so convincing anymore.
“Just tell me why you kissed him.” Chuck shoots back, as if Dean’s being the unreasonable one.
“We’re interacting with a very abstract part of Dean’s mind. It has to represent itself in a way we can comprehend and apparently an office space is its chosen form. It makes sense, given the nature of quantum entanglement in the human mind. I can draw a diagram.”
Seeing her, there’s still a sadness and love there, but mostly he’s taken aback by how young she is and the passage of time between now and then.
He splashes through the water, bringing his legs awkwardly high as he does so, and scrambles to grab something.
Cas leans over to reassure Sam, “The door’s lock is just another manifestation of more abstract safeguards preventing his entering. Michael cannot get through unless Dean unlocks the door. It’s similar with the blinds.” Cas points at them. “Michael can’t hear or see anything that’s happening in here. He can sense my presence, but outside of that he won’t know anything.”
“What’s the difference?” Jack asks.
“Why do you care so much?” Cas asks from where he’s still pinned to the chair. Chuck turns to find Cas glaring at him.
“He was still stronger than me.” Jack says, sadly.
When Dean sees Cas with a black cat wrapped around his head, he’s hit with the strongest sense of déjà vu.
“Everyone okay?” Dean asks as he gets himself a bowl and milk so he can also eat some of Jack’s sugary excuse for breakfast. No one answers for a little while as Dean gets his breakfast set up and sits down next to Cas to eat.
In an instant Cas is kissing him back. Cas kisses gently and sweetly. Dean can’t get enough; his heart bursts with that warmth, and he doesn’t understand why he’s been so scared of something so perfect, why he ever fought something so blissful. He forgets the world around him as he and Castiel remain wrapped up in each other, moving their lips gently against each other.
“That’s great.” Dean says, meaning it. But he can’t stop staring at the cat. “But uh, what’s up with the cat?”
“Do you even know why you did that?” Chuck asks. This time, he’s actually asking Dean rather than simply talking to himself. And that’s the kicker. Dean doesn’t know. He knows why he wanted to kiss Cas, but he himself doesn’t understand why all those reasons not to suddenly seemed so unimportant. If Dean did know, he’s pretty sure he would tell Chuck at this point. He wouldn’t want to out of pride, but really, he needs to get them out of this frickin’ time loop. Still, Dean shakes his head no, he doesn’t know why he did that. Chuck sighs, like he was expecting that answer, “Guess we’ll have to keep watching.”
Castiel answers, though his voice sounds weak and rougher than usual, “He oversaturated my… what you can think of as my true form’s pain receptors.”
“Dean doesn’t love himself very much.” Cas practically rolls his eyes at that, but continues on to explain more in depth. “This piece is the love Dean feels for himself. And, well that Dean’s right.” Cas nods his head toward the demon version of Dean, who winks at them. “Dean hasn’t let himself use this piece of his heart. He won’t trust us with it; he doesn’t trust anyone with it… with loving him because he doesn’t think he deserves it.” Cas looks sadly at the many Deans in the room, then turns back to Sam. “He guards this piece of his heart ferociously.”
“It is, Sam.”
His thoughts are interrupted by knocking at the door. “Dean?” Jack calls. “I found a hairball that Naughty Edith left in my bed. Can you help me with the stain remover?” Cas huffs a small laugh and smiles.
Cas’s eyes then flit up to Dean’s, and Dean immediately looks away, out to the sea.
“Only one way to find out.” Sam opens the door.
“Seriously, Dean!?” Sam should have known Dean would be difficult. “Michael’s after us.”
“No, of course not. We’re here to protect it.” Sam knows he means that all the people in this office, Bobby, Mary, Cas, Charlie, Ellen, and more that he can’t see right now, are here to protect that piece of Dean’s heart. “I turned Michael away.”
Dean quickly pushes that thought aside and refocuses on the conversation.
“Oh.” Sam says. “We have a guest.”
“That’s not Dean. It’s Dean’s subconscious projection of himself.” Sam realizes Cas is right, but this Dean is pretty damn close.
“Now,” Psyche-Cas gets back to the topic at hand. “I’m assuming you wouldn’t be here for this heart unless it was for something very important so…” He holds out the shard again, and Cas takes it in his hand.
“Thank you, Dean.” Sam thinks it’s weird for Cas to talk to Dean by talking to something that looks like himself, but he gets it. It’s weird but he gets it.
He’s met with Cas’s face.
“I wanna go deeper, man!” Dean calls back. “Maybe I’ll get something better; I could find Bobby’s entire house.” Sam doesn’t even rolls his eyes, he just looks on with concern.
“Dean?” Sam asks as he pulls back gently from the hug. Psyche-Dean looks up at him with open and trusting eyes. “Do you have one of these?” Sam pulls out one of the shards he has in his pocket. Psyche-Dean’s eyes roam over it and he pokes it, then nods. “Okay, could you please give it to us?” Psyche-Dean nods and makes his way over to a countertop at the side of the office, which Sam only now notices has an apple pie on it. Psyche-Dean stands on his toes to reach it, and carefully brings it down.
As soon as he’s gone Cas turns to Sam.
“Mostly.” Sam answers eventually. “Cat’s out of the bag about Jack being back but we’re alive.”
Dean pulls his jacket around himself a little tighter as he steps off the pavement and onto the sand. The cold breeze and overcast sky aren’t exactly what he’d had in mind all those times he dreamed of a beach vacation. Whether it be the mark, or the darkness, or British asshats, or whatever else, Dean hoped each time that they’d deal with the problem, then be free to stick their toes in the sand and soak up some sun. Obviously, that didn’t happen. Another problem always arose and prevented Dean’s vacation dreams from coming to fruition.
Psyche-Cas stares at Castiel, face breaking. And Sam can only stare because even though he's wearing Cas's face, all Sam can see is Dean.
“The best analogy is that they’re pieces of his heart. And Dean’s psyche is guarding them so that Michael can’t reach them. There should be six but…” Cas sighs. “I don’t know how to reach them. And I don’t know how Dean’s guarding them; every human mind organizes these things differently.”
Psyche-Sam looks between them expectantly. “You wanted to talk about taking the family heart?” Sam’s having a tough time focusing on having a conversation with himself. It’s like hearing a recording of your own voice only times 100.
He’s not sure why, but the reasons don’t seem so convincing anymore.
“Uh…” Sam says as he finally walks into the room. “Has there been some sort of mistake? We already saw you at the friends place… This is for Dean’s romantic interests.”
“He’s right.” Demon-Dean calls from the copier. “You’ve been trying to convince him for years to let go of this piece of his heart and he hasn’t. You really think you can convince him now? With one stupid conversation?” Demon-Dean laughs at them and goes about his business.
“Bingo. I think.” Dean says.
Dean’s in love with me.” Psyche-Cas tell Sam like he’s an idiot. “Sam, you must understand that giving someone you’re in love with your heart can destroy you.” Now Psyche-Cas seems angry. He gets louder and his tone sharper. “And with how often I die? What do you think that would do to him?” Psyche-Cas gives Sam a moment to really think about it. How destroyed he was after Jess died. And Sam does understand. He understands perfectly why Dean might guard that part of his heart to protect himself. “Dean hasn’t allowed himself to give this part of his heart to me, and yet, he’s
She walks toward a closed door at the side of the office, and Sam and Cas follow behind.
Before he can talk himself out of it, Dean closes the distance between them and takes Cas’s face in his hands. The moment their lips meet—
“But why can’t you? You just convinced Dean that he can, so why can’t you?”
The door automatically locks behind him.
“Come on,” he says as he stands and holds out a hand to help Cas up, “I’ve got something that’ll make you feel better.” Sam snorts quietly, and Dean sends him a glare. Though, to Sam’s credit it looks like he’s trying his hardest to hold back any teasing, or any serious comments or questions about feelings. Dean knows it’ll come eventually, Sam can’t help himself, but he’s grateful to have a little space for now to process. Hell, Dean hasn’t even had time to think about the kiss himself, let alone articulate his feelings about it. And now he’s got a load of other crap to process on top of that.
“Wait.” Sam interrupts. “You’re supposed to be guarding this thing; that was way too easy.” Psyche-Castiel and Cas both tilt their hands slightly to the side and squint as Sam, and Sam tries really hard to only focus on one of them at a time or he’s gonna get a headache.
“Right.” She says as she dials on her phone. “So I’m guessing you already got the whole spiel on the bosses around here?”
“Don’t you need to wash those at some point?” Sam teases as he walks into the kitchen, seeing Dean sitting at the table in said pajamas. Before Dean gets a chance to respond, Sam asks, “Did you make pancakes?”
“I’m omniscient.” Chuck explains. “So when there’s something I don’t know, I need to know.”
Dean nods, “Okay.” He tells him gently. “I’ll wait.” But because he’s selfish, he leans in to give Cas one last, barely-there touch of lips, before he pulls back and releases Castiel. “Let’s go save the world.”
At the reception desk with a huge smile, sits Jack.
Sam stops breathing when he sees Jess.
She knocks twice on the door and opens before getting a reply, then ushers Sam and Cas in.
“I want to.” Dean argues, but he can practically see the cogs turning in Cas’s head.
While the mixtape and the samulet might be meaningful, misplaced objects aren’t what Dean was hoping to find here. But he walks into the water anyway.
“Yeah something like that.” Dean says with a bit of a smile.
“No, I mean, yeah he’s open about sex but not about romance, especially romantic love. Any time he’s had anything more serious than a hookup he’s all skittish about it.” Cas doesn’t seem to have any intention to respond. “It just seems like it’s been too easy so far, you know? Like these are supposed to be guarded but everyone’s given us the hearts basically right away. Maybe that’s because Dean’s getting the easy ones out of the way first.”
“Bite me.” There’s a commotion, the sounds of things falling over. Psyche-Dean with the amulet silently communicates with the other Dean’s in the room.
Sam stares at Cas in confusion, the two of them standing alone in the darkness inside Dean’s mind.
Sam and Jack are waiting for them, standing just shy of the ocean.
“Dean trusts us greatly.” Cas tells Sam as they again walk through the mist. His voice is mostly matter-of-fact, but there’s also a great deal of emotion in it. Cas is touched.
“You look good!” Dean tells him. “How’s it feel?”
“I trust you both. But to give you the piece of Dean’s heart I have to run it by the boss.”
“It could be useful.” Cas reasons, seemingly trying to put a positive spin on this even though the tone in his voice indicates that he knows it won’t work on Dean. “Chuck implied that he can’t kill me, not fully anyway. I’m not sure what ‘not fully’ means, though. Possibly he could put me in the veil, or in—“
“Huh.” It doesn’t seem like important information, but it does help Sam more solidly grasp the idea that these people are just projections and not the real people. These people don’t exist outside of Dean’s idea of them.
A light in the Impala turns on, and Sam follows it to the initials he and Dean had carved into it, “S.W. and D.W.”
They reach the next door.
“Haven’t you watched enough, perv?” Dean asks before Chuck can rewind everything again.
As he does so he tells Sam in such a little voice, “I really like this rock thing, Sammy. But I’ll do anything for you so you can have it.” Tears come to Sam’s eyes but he can’t get distracted with Michael right outside. “Just don’t lose it, okay?”
“So what do we do?”
“She’s my lead.” Cas says as the cat chews on a lock of Cas’s hair.
Inside is another office, much like the other one.
“Yes, her name is Naughty Edith. She saw Amara two days ago. It’s difficult for her to communicate exactly where, but after some bribery she agreed to show us.” The cat meows quietly and Cas purrs back. Purrs! Dean’s trying to formulate a response to all of this when Sam enters the room, Jack also in tow.
“Dean,” Castiel interrupts, “You don’t have to.”
Dean looks down at his crepes and snorts as he scoops some strawberries and powdered sugar onto one, “Crepes.” He corrects and gives Sam his best disappointed glare. “Shame, Sam, shame. And,” He adds as he wraps up the crepe, “I’ll have you know, I have been washing this.” He motions to his nightgown. “Mrs. Butters left behind some awesome fabric softener.”
“I made a deal.” And yeah, Sam’s heard that a lot in his life, sometimes from his own mouth, and it’s never good.
“Yeah, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that romance and self are the last two. And that he started with family and friendship. Those ‘guardians’ were obviously going to be you and me. And he started with the friendliest receptionist.” Sam huffs a bit, thinking about the contrast between Jack’s smile and eagerness to explain the whole system versus the grumpy ghost facer and the Dr. Sexy M.D. show they had to figure out.
He was just a college kid; he was going to propose to Jess and start law school. And now he’s solidly back in the hunting life, fighting an archangel from a different universe who wants to restart the apocalypse. And he’s raising a Nephilim with his brother and their best friend, who’s also an angel.
In front of them is a thin hallway, at the end is a reception desk, and the hallway opens up to a large office space. There are printers and office plants and chairs and desks and computers.
“Because I wanted to, jackass.”
“There’s some temporary damage, but that should heal within a few days.”
“Oh.” Is all Sam can say.
They walk for another long period of time, and it drags on long enough that Sam’s starting to get impatient.
“I wish I could tell you that you don’t have to do this.” Castiel says sympathetically. “But unfortunately, we need you.” Dean snorts. “If it’s any reassurance, you’ve taken her on once before. And this time, Sam and Jack and I will be with you. You don’t have to do it alone.” It is reassuring. Last time, he turned himself into a soul bomb and had to trek to Amara, completely alone and expecting to die. This time, he’ll have his family with him. And there’s only about a ninety-five percent chance that he’s going to die. “And,” Castiel adds, “I didn’t sense any ill-intent from Naughty Edith.” Dean huffs a small laugh and meets eyes with Cas, who returns a lopsided smile. It fills Dean with warmth: a warmth he feels often with Castiel. He knows what it is but he’s always been too scared to put a name to it.
“Of course.” Cas answers, full of compassion and care.
“I prefer to think Dean’s just embarrassed about his crushes.” Cas chuckles lightly in agreement.
“He looked at Cas’s memories but didn’t even try with you.” Sam reasons. “He kept rewinding time instead.” Sam shrugs, “Seems like a lot of effort if he could just look at your memories.” Dean thinks about this for a second and then realizes Sam has a point. “And,” Sam continues, once he sees that Dean concedes that point, “we know that Chuck can be lured out.”
Dean finds himself choking up, and painfully swallows around it as he forces himself to stand up and walk to the others now that his shoes are off and he’s ready for his turn.
Dean realizes he’s done making Cas wait.
“You’re being selfish.” Sam tells him, fully knowing that he’s long beyond talking to Dean’s projection of Cas and instead trying to talk directly to his brother. “You’re so afraid of getting hurt that you’ll let Michael destroy the world!?”
Sam searches for words, as does Cas, and then Sam settles on all he can think of. “Because Dean always gives this piece of his heart. He gives it to strangers all the time, because he cares, even when it hurts. He would want you to give it to us.” Psyche-Jimmy doesn’t even think it over, he just walks away, leaving the two standing there.
To say that Dean’s devastated would be an understatement. What’s been getting him through all of this utterly horrible crap is the potential light at the end of the tunnel. If they just get through this, there could be freedom and happiness waiting for them on the other side. Sure, the chance of them succeeding is small. The chance of them succeeding and getting through with their whole family alive is even smaller. But the chance was there. Now, Dean’s finding out that there is no potential light at the end of the tunnel for Cas. Even if they get through this, even if happiness is within Cas’s reach, he can never take it. There is no happy ending here, just pain and more pain until he inevitably dies.
By all accounts, they should now, finally, be free to vacation and unwind. Chuck’s defeated, the universe is balanced, there aren’t any apocalypses hanging over their heads. There’s a calm now that Dean hasn’t known since Sam was still in college.
“…Maybe his sub-conscience is more reluctant to show us certain things. He’s always been closed off about himself, about romance.” Cas squints in confusion.
“I don’t care.” Dean says, voice suddenly almost hysterical. “Don’t you get it?” He clearly doesn’t. “You’re… The only thing that’s getting me through is the stupid hope that at the end of all of this, that the people I care about can be happy and safe. So this is the more pressing concern, okay?” Only now, as Dean’s vision of Cas blurs, does Dean realize how wet his eyes are. “’Cause I can’t do this, I can’t fight Chuck unless I have hope that you’ll be okay.” He wipes away some of his unshed tears and tries using that moment to compose himself. He doesn’t think he’s very successful, but he manages to get his vision mostly clear again so he’s got that going for him.
“Hey Sam, Cas.” Psyche-Sam greets them.
He stands with the water halfway up his shins, foam occasionally rushing up to just below knees.
“Uh uh. No way. I’m not taking that while it’s covered in seaweed and fish poop.” Sam rolls his eyes at Dean, but doesn’t pressure Dean to take it and instead gets back to work getting the worst of the goop off it.
But when he enters the map room, he stops in his tracks.
The car sits, engine still working, thinking it over. Then the passenger door opens.
They should have had time to get to know each other.
“I just don’t want to bother or upset you or—“ Cas cuts him off gently.
“Dean gives his friendship freely to the both of you. For anyone else I wouldn’t give the heart so willingly, and I certainly protect it from those who would do it harm.”
“Alright.” Sam’s not happy about not knowing what they’re walking into. But it’s not going to stop him. “Let’s start looking.”
The fog grows denser and heavier, until Sam can barely see. He keeps walking, but more cautiously now, should he collide with something right in front of him that he can’t see.
“That’s strangers and acquaintances.” Cas reminds him as they walk inside.
“If you don’t know something then you’re not omniscient.” Cas states, matter-of-factedly.
This child is clearly the guardian of this heart, the version of himself Dean feels the most love for. And it’s the Dean that was Sam’s older brother, but before the fire. Dean before John was ever disappointed in him. Dean when he didn’t know about monsters.
When they look back up, another door stands in front of them.
to give the heart but he
Sam frowns but forces himself to not focus on that right now. “We’re here for the friend heart.” Sam holds up the shard he already has. “We already got the family one, if that helps you trust us more.” Psyche-Charlie looks at the piece suspiciously.
“Will you shut up!?” Dean yells. As he opens his mouth to say more, he’s violently hurled into the water as a massive wave crashes over his head. His body tumbles in the cold and gets thrown around in ways Dean’s mind can’t keep up with. He’s crashed into the sand several times and is numb everywhere before he even has time to realize what’s happened.
He can’t even feel hatred towards his father right now because all he can feel is his heart breaking for Dean.
The way Cas’s face contorts in regret tells Dean immediately that he’s going to absolutely hate the answer. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.” Cas starts. “You already had so many worries and I didn’t want to add to your burden.” He takes a moment to breathe, maybe he actually has to right now given how weak he is. “When Jack died and I went to heaven to retrieve him, it wasn’t as uneventful as I’d let on. The Cosmic Entity that rules over The Empty came for Jack; it thought it had a claim to him since he’s half angel. So to protect Jack, I made a deal.” Dean’s stomach drops. He knew this was going to be bad, but few phrases induce the same sort of dread in him as hearing someone he loves has made a deal. “Me instead of Jack. But the Cosmic Entity doesn’t like me very much. It wanted me to suffer. So it told me that it would wait to take me. It wanted to wait until I forgot about it and gave myself permission to be happy.”
Psyche-Jimmy watches them impatiently. “So why should I trust you with the heart?”
He didn’t see this coming though.
“No. He hasn’t found us yet.”
“This one’s gonna be you.” Sam explains, even though it’s obvious. Cas doesn’t look convinced.
Sam thinks that they should be more cautious and considerate upon entering, especially since Dean’s left this one for last and Sam can tell his brother’s conflicted about it, but he’s still in flight mode, so when he reaches the door he yanks it open without hesitation.
How on Earth are they supposed to communicate with objects to get the heart? Sam doesn’t know, but Cas strides forward toward the reception desk like he doesn’t see a problem.
Sam feels a little bit guilty for not remembering his name, but they have more important things to worry about right now.
“I trust him.” Psyche-Sam calls back. Psyche-John grumbles to himself. “He’s got Sam with him.” Psyche-Sam adds. That seems to placate Psyche-John enough and then everyone is in agreement. Psyche-Sam turns back toward Sam and Cas with a smile. “Follow me.” He tells them, before walking deeper into the office. Sam and Cas follow him to a room within the office, presumably Psyche-Sam’s. There’s a large, fancy desk and Psyche-Sam rounds it to a safe behind it. He positions himself so Sam and Cas can’t see the combination, and then he opens it.
“Are you just gonna keep rewinding time and rewatching this morning until you figure it out?” Sam asks, distressed.
“Dean, we need the heart before Michael finds us.” Psyche-Dean shrinks away from Cas as he says it.
“Well is he gonna be okay? What did Chuck do to him?”
“It’s not too bad.” He tells them, “You go numb pretty fast and can’t feel how cold it is anymore.” He smiles at them before something at his feet gains his attention.
“It’s the best shot we’ve got.” Cas admits, and they start walking through the darkness. But eventually Sam notices a fog has started settling over them.
“Okay.” Dean says. But he’s not going to let Cas die. Not like this.
But then Psyche-Cas quickly straightens back up and continues. “Lest we forget all of the other issues.”
“Don’t say things like that, Dean.” It sounds like it pains Cas to say it. “Don’t say you care about me. I’m not… I need to survive through the end of this mission. I’m not ready to die yet.” Suddenly, it hits Dean. After he kissed Cas, Dean tried to tell him he loved him. But Cas interrupted; he said he wasn’t ready. But he didn’t mean that he wasn’t ready to hear Dean say it, or that he wasn’t ready to be together. He meant that he wasn’t ready to die. “There are many things that affect my happiness. I don’t think your actions alone will cause the Cosmic Entity to come for me, but I can’t take that chance.”
“Yes.” Castiel says. Cas seems to think this whole talking-to-himself thing is completely normal. He doesn’t skip a beat. Maybe it’s not a big deal to him; this isn’t his true form anyway.
“Thanks.”
Psyche-Cas nods and stands staring at them as they leave.
Holy crap. Dean’s in love with Cas!
“Dean, I gave up everything for you, and I would choose that every single time. Falling for you is the best decision I’ve ever made. So please, I know you can’t, but I need you to do this for me.”
When Dean sees Cas with a black cat wrapped around his head, he’s hit with the strongest sense of déjà vu.
“No.” Psyche-Dean tells them.
The next instant, time lurches back to its normal speed and Dean gasps.
“Stop!” Jack screams. A pulse of power accompanies the scream, enough to get Chuck’s attention. He releases Castiel, causing the high pitched noise to stop and the white light to stream back into Cas’s eyes and mouth. He gasps, only for that gasp to be interrupted as he violently coughs blood.
“I’m in the right place.” Psyche-Castiel tells them. “I’m Dean’s best friend but he’s also in love with me so I’m the guardian of both hearts.” And okay, that’s a massive bomb that he just dropped super casually.
“You didn’t give it to him, right?”
“It could be Michael… It could also be Dean reaching out to us.” He adds on more hopefully. Any development is a good development.
“Wait, have you been using that on my laundry too?”
Cas shrugs, “Well, I’m happy I came back.” Sam claps him on the shoulder.
Once he does, he turns toward them, holding up a pink, glittery bouncy ball. One of those things you buy for a quarter or get for a few tickets at an arcade or at the dentist. The massive smile on Jack’s face is, in Dean’s opinion, way out or proportion considering it’s just a bouncy ball.
“Where’s your friend?” Dean asks, having noticed that the cat is no longer draped over the angel.
“It just is!” Castiel yells at him. He then turns away from Sam, and sighs in frustration. Sam allows Cas to stew and think in silence.
Then there are the sounds of sputtering, struggling; Michael must be holding Psyche-Dean up by his neck. “I can sense Castiel nearby. Which means he’s here and the heart is still here. So give them to me.”
“That’s not right.” Dean says, still unable to fully convince himself the lady is dead.
“Not even to you?”
But before Cas can answer, Psyche-Jimmy returns, shard in hand and tosses it to Cas.
“I like her.” Jack says with a big smile.
He’s not disappointed, per se. He’d obviously choose this mundanity over danger, and it’s odd enough seeing himself and others who are long dead. But still.
He reaches inside and takes out a glass-like shard. It’s translucent, and has a pinkish-reddish color to it, but also glows faintly. It has an aura to it that Sam can’t describe, and that’s part of how he knows this is what they were looking for.
“It just…” Dean answers, finally turning to look at Cas now, “it seems like a lot of bad. Bad luck omens, and my eyes itch, and Amara…” He takes a moment to put his thoughts together. “Look, the way I felt about her scared me. It terrified me. Even when I wasn’t with her it was all consuming and horrible but I couldn’t stop it. And I don’t feel that way anymore. I don’t feel any sort of draw to her, or a need to protect her, or any of that. She’s just, you know, she’s just another thing now. But I’m scared that if she’s right there in front of me. What if she flips some switch and makes me… I’m scared of what she did to me, and I’m scared that she’s powerful enough to do it again.”
Until he looks back at the real Castiel, and sees the shard resting in his hand that was not there before he held Psyche-Cas’s hands.
“Dean, it’s okay for you to be selfish sometimes.” Cas is so sincere, and the affection in his eyes is almost overwhelming. Dean wants to be selfish. And since he’s always been better with actions than words, Dean acts on that selfishness.
“And escaping his force-hold.” Dean adds.
He surges forward, wrapping himself tightly around Cas, clutching at the back of his head and at his shirt.
“The fact that you have to specify which time you died really shows how messed up our lives have been.” Sam says, brushing his hair out of his face with the cleaner of his two hands.
“Cas,” Sam interrupts, and Cas pulls his eyes away from Jimmy and to Sam, “that’s not actually Jimmy.”
“You’ll find another way.”
“Michael won’t destroy the world. You’ll find another way that doesn’t require me giving you this piece of Dean’s heart. It’ll destroy him.”
“So you said there were six of these places.”
“I fell from grace for you, and I gave up everything for you. And it hurt, Dean. But it was worth it. It was worth it because… because I love you. Because I’m in love with you.” Sam’s sure he’s tomato red and also shocked all over again. Jesus, Cas is in love with Dean too? These two idiots are in love with each other and… okay it’s a little bit weird since they’re both family to Sam and he didn’t know any of this an hour ago. But holy crap they’re in love with each other. They could be happy together. If they can get past all this Michael crap they could actually be happy.
When did that stop?
“You’re protecting the heart, but you’re not turning us away when we seek to steal it?” Cas states with a question at the end. Jack finishes dialing and holds the phone to his ear but smiles up at Cas to continue speaking to him.
And Sam feels himself deflating.
Sam turns around to see the real Castiel still standing there, squinting in confusion at the projection of himself. Then he turns back to Psyche-Castiel. Then back to real Castiel, who’s no longer squinting in confusion and now looks more like a dear caught in the headlights. Sam doesn’t think he’s ever seen that look on Cas’s face before.
“Cas,” Dean says, startled by the confidence in his own voice. He walks across the room until he’s standing a few feet away from him, “can I tell you something?”
“You haven’t even felt it yet. Just try it on and you’ll see. It’ll fix you right up.”
He’d always known that Dean was four when all that responsibility was put on his shoulders, he knew Dean was too young, but it’s completely different actually seeing Dean at this age, feeling how small he is as he hugs him tight.
He thinks of Cas offering to wait for Dean to take off his stupid boots, walking slowly with him because Dean’s too stubborn to take them off, waiting for Dean to forgive him and catch up and let go.
It finally occurs to Sam to see how Cas is taking this news.
Sam turns, trying to figure out where they’re to go next, but instead finds himself face to face with a small child.
“It’s okay.” Cas tells him. “I’ll come with you.”
Despite himself, it fills Dean with hope. This is it: Cas sitting here in a nightcap to humor Dean, Jack learning how to get stains out of bedding, and Sam off at the farmers market probably buying organic vegan conditioner or something. This is what he’s fighting for. Not something grand or flashy, just his family and every family like or unlike his, which is perhaps the grandest thing of all. The freedom to spend time doing unremarkable things with the ones you love.
There’s a tense moment of not-so-silent silence. The wind whistles around them, rustling the tall grass and carrying the fading sounds of Sam’s and Jack’s voices, barely audible now over the sound of crashing waves.
He’s not sure what he was expecting inside, but it wasn’t an office.
“Okay.” And then the shard falls from Psyche-Cas’s sleeve into his hand and he holds it out to Castiel.
“See, I can kinda see why you wanted to. But what changed to make you act on it like that?”
“Hello, Sam.” Cas easily greets. As though he isn’t even fazed by this. He probably isn’t.
When time resumes moving in the correct direction at the correct pace, Dean doesn’t remember what’s to come.
“We have more pressing concerns.” Cas argues back.
“You don’t have to convince me, Sam; I saw Dean’s projection of me.”
Psyche-Cas looks between Sam and Cas before settling back on Sam. “Especially not to Cas.”
Psyche-Jimmy doesn’t look at Sam; he’s focused on Castiel. And he doesn’t return Cas’s pleasantries. Only now does Sam look at Cas instead of at Psyche-Jimmy, and he wishes he didn’t.
Cas is there alright, but with a black cat wrapped around his head. And suddenly Dean’s hit with the strongest sense of déjà vu. He swears he knows this image. He’s seen this before: black cat perched on Cas’s head, one paw on his nose and another digging into his cheek. Cas, standing there like it’s nothing, looking way more adorable than a grown man has any right to.
Sam laughs. “Seriously, Dean never told you about that? Not even about Destiel?”
The ghost facer looks uninterested.
“Yeah I don’t think it would have given you your soul.” Dean agrees, then adds on, “Your soul wasn’t really lost. It was gone; there’s a difference.”
It’s the same body as Cas, but Jimmy inhabits it so differently. He stands in it so casually, so naturally, just a regular guy. His eyes are different, regular human eyes instead of Cas’s intense, penetrating ones.
Dean watches as Sam reaches into the ocean, scrambling for a bit to get a grip on something that seems to be tumbling in the waves.
“Why now, though?” Chuck asks thoughtfully.
“Yeah,” Sam agrees, “it was a good proof of concept. He’s in firing range.” Jack nods, seemingly satisfied with these answers. “We also learned that he can’t read Dean’s mind, or at least doesn’t want to.”
“Michael came through a little while ago looking for it too.”
Yeah, Dean thinks, all it takes throwing him off by kissing your best friend. He doesn’t mind the idea of having to do that again, but somehow Dean doubts it’ll work out the same way a second time.
need you to.” He leans forward and takes Psyche-Castiel’s hands in his own on the desk. And yeah, it looks like Cas’s body, but Sam can feel Dean in there. Some deep down part of Dean looking at Cas, anchored by their eyes locking and their hands touching.
“You can trust us.” Sam tries to placate him.
“Yeah… So you’re calling up Dean’s best friend?”
“Us?” But as Sam questions it, he finally looks away from Psyche-Dean at the rest of the office and sees variations of Dean at desks; one’s at the copier, one’s at the coffee machine, they’re all scattered about.
“Think it’s Cas?” Dean says after swallowing what’s left in his mouth. But he’s already up before Sam can respond. “You finish your breakfast, I’ll go see if he’s found anything.” Dean’s excited to see Cas again. Dean had called and texted him to let him know about all the goings on with Mrs. Butters, but he still wants to tell him and show him things in person.
A wave crashes and shakes Dean out of it, and he realizes his knuckles are turning white from where they grip the rock below him.
Sam and Jack remove their shoes before taking the narrow path down to the beach. They walk ahead comfortably, chatting as the breeze sends Sam’s hair flying and he struggles to control it.
Back at the bunker the next morning, Dean emerges from his room and makes his way to the kitchen, this time wearing a different set of pajamas.
“Michael.” Cas states, alerting Sam that he’s here.
“How are you?” Cas asks gently. Dean internally sighs; Cas knows him too well. Dean’s not doing so well, and based on Cas’s tone he already knows that. Still, Dean’s not going to talk about his feelings without a fight. He turns toward Cas briefly before getting back to his preparations.
“No, you can’t.” Psyche-Cas agrees. “So you won’t." Of course Dean's being a stubborn idiot about this. "But you can escape. You can leave Dean’s mind and leave the pieces with me for safekeeping. Once you leave I can safely return them to their proper offices.”
“If we don’t talk to Dean, he’ll stay buried in Michael while he destroys the world.”
“But you’re still going to tell him you, you love him, you’re in love with him, right?” It feels weird to say aloud. Sam hadn’t expected these sorts of bombs to drop today.
Halfway through.
to. We need you to.
“I swear to God, Dean, if you’re wasting our time because you’re shy about relationships, I’ll kill you the minute we get Michael out of you!” As if on cue, something becomes visible through the mist.
Sam nods, silent for a few moments as he processes all of this. “Why didn’t you tell us?”
with Cas!? Like
He wasn’t sure what he expected when he came here. But the way it called to him, he was sure it was important. He’d hoped it would help him find what he was looking for, help him move on from all the trauma that he’s dealt with his entire life. But it looks like the ocean will only bring trinkets: childhood toys and jewelry.
“Was Michael here?” Cas asks.
Then speaks a voice Sam hasn’t heard in years. “I don’t know about that Cas fella.” Psyche-John Winchester pipes up from somewhere in the back of the office. Sam was already off kilter from interacting with himself, but now he has to hear his long-dead dad’s voice? He knows it’s just a part of Dean’s imagination or whatever, but it doesn’t sound any less real. His voice is filled with suspicion and distrust, disgruntled too. The only striking difference between this John and the real one is that the real one would never let Sam be in charge. Instead of suggesting to Sam that he’s not sure if he trusts Cas, he would outright tell Sam that they aren’t giving the heart to some stranger.
But Sam’s not sure about Cas’s assessment. He just gave himself the heart, after all. “Seems more like I trust myself.”
“I thought perhaps it would be you or Charlie or Benny or-“
“Did it help?” Cas asks, almost seriously.
“Oh I will, not yet though.” He then turns his attention to Castiel and walks to him. “Come here, son.” Chuck pulls him off the wall and throws him into a chair a bit away from the others. Chuck then squats in front of him, fingers steeped, and evaluates Cas thoughtfully. “See, I was just going to watch. See what you boys were up to, but then I noticed something about you,” he then turns to Dean, “and you, and I realized I missed something when I was away.” He turns back to Castiel and stands, leaning over him and pressing a hand to Cas’s forehead. For a horrifying moment Dean thinks Chuck is going to kill Castiel. Instead, he continues his monologue, “Let’s take a look at some memories of yours.” Castiel scowls at Chuck as a light glow emanates from his palm and Cas’s eyes lightly glow. It only takes a few moments and then Chuck releases Castiel and pulls back.
The corpse on the floor doesn’t look right. It isn’t particularly grotesque or anything; the problem is that it looks alive. It’s even still warm, despite the body being two days old.
“What!?” Dean barks out. “We stormed in to kill your sister and that’s what you’re worried about?”
“Now what?” Sam asks Cas. They’re not leaving or giving up, but he’s not sure how to convince Jimmy to help them.
“We’ll find a way to get you out of that deal, Cas. We can help you.” Cas shoots him a skeptical, almost annoyed look. “You can be happy, but you have to let us help you.”
“Later.” Sam actually is interested, but they’re here on a mission. With that, Sam approaches the reception desk, Cas just a step behind him.
Sam walks forward, and once he can see past the flowers on the reception desk, he sees that the receptionist is Lisa.
“I’m sorry, Dean. You’re braver and stronger than all of us.” Sam gives him a last hug and then swings himself down the pole as Dean waves to him from above and then closes the trap door.
Well, that isn’t promising but it’s not like they’re just going to leave.
“For what?” Sam asks confused.
“We need the heart.” Cas tells him.
“The boss?” But just then Jack speaks into the phone.
Still, even if Dean doesn’t know how to process everything that happened yesterday, the many times he experienced yesterday, one thing he does know is how to take care of people. He leads Cas through the bunker slowly, supporting his weight as Dean bring them to his room. He helps Cas sit down on the bed and then goes to his dresser to retrieve his ultra-soft nightgown and nightcap.
It doesn’t take Sam long to figure out, and soon the person Sam assumes is the boss of this familial love office approaches and stands before them.
“Dean is hiding inside his own mind.” Castiel explains. “Michael is everywhere, but there are pieces Michael cannot touch. If we bring those pieces together, we might be able to reach Dean.”
Sam thought this would be less trippy than being face to face with himself, but this is actually way worse. At least the two Sam’s had been wearing different outfits. These two Castiel’s look exactly the same and Sam can see them both at once.
“Hi, Sam.” Jack greets with his classic bright and innocent smile. “What can I help you with?”
He lands in the mist nearby Cas, and the two take off running, hoping Michael won’t be able to follow them. Hopefully Dean will protect them in the mist.
Psyche-Sam holds out the shard to Sam, but before handing it over tells him seriously, “I know I don’t have to tell you this, but keep it safe.” Sam nods and takes the shard.
“It’s speaking to us.” Cas tells Sam before turning back to the screen.
And okay, now Sam understands why Dean didn’t want them coming here.
“Okay.” Dean says, relieved that Cas is going to be okay. He’s less thrilled about the state Cas is currently in. “Okay let’s get you back to the bunker to rest. Do you think you can stand?” Castiel attempts to stand, but quickly falls back into the chair and shakes his head. “That’s okay. Come on, I’ll carry you.” He positions himself to lift Cas up. “Put your arms around my neck.” Cas does so and Dean lifts him up bridal style. “Just focus on keeping your head up, alright?” Cas leans his head against Dean’s shoulder in lieu of an answer. He doesn’t say anything else as he carries Cas out to the car.
“He can’t hurt you or take the pieces of Dean’s heart from you.” Psyche-Cas chimes in. Well, that’s great and all but it’s all still useless if they can’t reach Dean.
“He’s not me, Sam.” Cas reminds him.
“What?” Sam asks. Now snapping back into action after the revelation about his brother. “He’s literally you.”
But now's not the time to dwell on old resentments.
Cas explains the cat: Naughty Edith. Sam and Jack arrive in the map room and they discuss their plan of attack while Dean tries to ignore his sappy thoughts about Cas being cute. He leaves to his room to change out of the pajamas and otherwise prepare, but he’s soon interrupted by Castiel showing up, asking questions and giving Dean reassurances and soon, Dean finds he can’t keep avoiding putting a name to the warmth he feels.
“It could also be that he’s trying to protect us from Michael.”
Somehow, the waves have brought him back to shore, and when he opens his eyes, Castiel is over him, saying something that Dean can’t hear. But Dean locks eyes with him, and he certainly doesn’t feel calm, but he does finally feel peace.
But when Cas sees Dean, an amused smile breaks out on his face and he looks Dean up and down (careful to move only his eyes and not his head, lest he upset the cat), as though Dean is the weird-looking one in this situation!
“I’m at peace with my decision, Sam. I don’t regret saving Jack.”
“Have we been walking for a really long time?” Sam asks Cas after the mist stretches on for what seems like a lot longer than last time.
“Michael will destroy him!”
Soon something becomes visible in front of them in the fog. A wooden door against a beige building. They get close enough to it to see a label on the door:
“Dean’s in love with him and Dean trusts him to guard his heart. How can Dean ‘especially not’ be willing to give it to him?”
“Yep.” Psyche-Charlie pipes up from her desk. “And I told him to fuck off.”
“I just don’t want to bother or upset you or—“ Cas cuts him off gently.
He isn’t used to the proximity anymore, and he tries to remember when that happened. He thinks maybe it was after Mary died, but that’s not true. At that point there was already this building space between them. It happened slowly, without Dean even noticing.
“Cas… He loves you back. You… Now that you know, why wouldn’t you tell him?”
Somehow, he convinced Sam, Cas, and Jack to come with him.
Chuck just shakes his head, “I just don’t get it.” He says to himself. “What am I missing?”
give this piece of his heart. Michael came by asking for it earlier. It’s technically a different Michael from the one who started our apocalypse and ruined my life, but” he shrugs, “all Michael’s are dicks.”
It takes a while for Sam to recognize the reception desk; it’s so covered in crap. There are burgers and fries and milkshakes all over it.
She’s so young it’s painful. And it reminds Sam of just how long ago that was. How far they’ve come.
“Alright.” Sam nods. That’s good to know.
Mrs. Butters may be gone, but Dean still has the memories, and perhaps more importantly, the pajamas.
Still, there’s a reception desk by the front, this time manned by Charlie.
“We can’t just stand here. Maybe if we start looking we’ll get lucky, or maybe Dean wants us to find them and he’ll lead us to them.”
Psyche-Cas stands and crosses to the door to his office. He locks the door and lowers the blinds.
Finally, Cas settles on whispering, “I’m not ready.” Dean thinks he should feel rejected. But it’s not a rejection. The way Cas kissed him back, the way he continues looking at Dean like he’s everything, the want Dean sees in his eyes: none of that is rejection. Dean’s spent years not being ready. While Dean wondered why he was so scared, it doesn’t change the fact that he was. So Dean understands not being ready. Not being ready to hear Dean say he loves him isn’t rejection. Dean wasn’t ready, but he still loved Castiel through it all. He loved him more than Dean can put words to.
“Ask Sam.” Dean calls back, not wanting to leave Cas right now.
“What does he mean?” Sam asks Cas.
“Huh?” Dean asks, not understanding where that conclusion came from.
“Thank you.”
Dean’s yelling something, he isn’t sure what. But it doesn’t stop Chuck. The light continues streaming and the noise continues growing in pitch and volume. Horrifyingly, Dean realizes it sounds like Cas’s true voice, screaming.
Regardless, Jimmy and Cas have the same body, almost the same outfit, but Sam would never mistake them for each other for more than a few seconds.
“Cas?” Dean says as he takes the man’s face in his hands, not caring about the blood getting on his jeans and his hands. Cas’s eyes have a far-off look in them, full of pain and defocused. “Hey, hey, focus on me.” Dean lightly slaps Cas’s cheek in an attempt to gain his attention and startle him out of wherever his mind is. Cas’s eyes slowly focus on Dean’s and Dean rewards him with a small smile. “You’re okay.” Cas seems to argue that with a well-timed blood-bubble. “Okay maybe not totally fine but I’ve got ya. Jack?” Dean calls over to their son, who quickly leaves his pointless task and strides over to them, “Can you fix him?”
“What?” Dean turns toward them.
“You’ve got something in your hair.” Dean jokes.
“I know… I would have done the same thing.”
Just then, both Cas and Psyche-Cas tense and become alert. They look in the direction of the main door.
He also notices that Jimmy looks younger than Cas. Sam hadn't noticed it, but Cas has aged. Or his vessel has anyway. Sam's pretty sure angelic vessels aren't supposed to age, and he files that away to ask Cas about later.
“You go first.” Cas says.
He tries to avoid accidentally brushing against Cas for the remainder of their walk down the narrow path to the beach.
Dean quickly interrupts, “Who’s going next?”
Once inside, Sam’s able to catch his breath and he calms down a bit. He knows they aren’t safe, but it feels safer than sprinting through the mist, nothing in sight in any direction.
“I know you believe in the healing power of hugs,” Cas says, referencing Dean’s description of the pajamas, “but I doubt they’ll work for my injuries.” But even as he says so, he sheds the blanket draped over him and also works his arms out of his trench coat sleeves. Dean pretends to be busy hanging up Cas’s trench coat and suit jacket so as to give Cas a bit of privacy as he divests himself of his button-up. When Dean does eventually turn back to look at Cas, he knows he wouldn’t have been able to fight his smile if he tried.
When he gets them off and puts his bare toes in the sand, it’s cold and hard and a little bit wet even this far up the beach.
Psyche-Cas doesn’t exchange pleasantries. He gets right to it. “You want the heart.” He tells them.
A noise from elsewhere in the room draws both Dean’s and Chuck’s attention, and they both turn to see Jack stepping off the wall he’d previously been pinned to, eyes glowing yellow and staring at Chuck.
He isn’t angry anymore. He doesn’t care that Cas didn’t tell him about the snake, he doesn’t care about being stubborn, and he doesn’t care about anger; all he cares about is fixing things with Cas.
“I’m fine! I’m not even waist deep, it’s not like I’m gonna drown or anything. I just want to see if the magic water will give me something more for my trouble.”
Another office, this one decorated with cheesy Valentine’s Day decorations.
“I wasn’t ASKING!” Michael yells, accompanied by a cacophony of sound: the high-pitched, near-deafening sound of true angelic voice; wood snapping; bone breaking; tornado speed wind blowing paper about and knocking over office plants, one of the Dean’s screaming.
“I burned through my soul to kill Michael. So it was destroyed, not lost, even though I ended up getting it back.” Jack says slowly.
“The magic here probably isn’t strong enough for that.” Cas answers.
“Let them go.” Jack says, probably with more bravado than he should given that he’s pinned to the wall and relatively powerless, Dean thinks.
“What do you want?” Psyche-Jimmy asks them, all the scratch present in Cas’s voice absent.
The ghost facer hangs up the phone but doesn’t look at them or say anything.
“Yeah. Yeah Okay. But we’re talking about this after we get out of here.”
“That’s true.” Psyche-Cas confirms for them. “He wouldn’t leave so Charlie called me and I also told him to ‘fuck off’.”
He doesn’t even see people milling about. He recognizes Cassie at one of the few desks but she’s the only one he can see from here in the entryway.
“Dean has trusted me to protect this heart, to protect him.” Psyche-Castiel’s voice rings with finality and power, anger and righteous fury. But Sam’s not going to give up.
Sam wishes he’d had this better understanding earlier when they saw their deceased loved ones.
The layout and colors and furniture are different here than in the previous office. Whereas the other office had many wood tones, this one is a little bit more colorful and playful. And it isn’t just the décor and decorations, there are more people milling about, and the atmosphere is louder and more energetic.
Sam stops at the threshold upon seeing Castiel sitting at the desk in the office.
There Cas sits, comfortably swimming in the pajamas. He’s even put on the cap, surely more to humor Dean than for his own benefit.
And now when Sam looks more closely, he notices how they’re different. One is younger and still has Sam’s necklace. There’s Dean Smith in his suspenders. Sam also sees Dean, bearing the Mark of Cain, and Dean with black demon eyes. He isn’t sure which of those two scares him more.
Sam opens the door and immediately locks eyes on Dean sitting behind the reception desk. “Dean!” He begins to rush over but Cas grabs his arm to stop him.
“You noticed.” Dean smiles as he fills his mouth and then pushes the crepe plate toward Sam. He tries to say, “come have some”, but it definitely gets muffled by the food in his mouth. Still, Sam seems to get the message. Their conversation fizzles out as Dean continues eating. Sam tries to talk with Dean, but he quickly gives up after Dean spews powdered sugar all over the table when he tries talking while chewing. When Dean’s almost done, he hears the sound of the bunker door opening and perks up.
He takes them off, followed by his socks, and looks up at Dean once he’s done.
Sam ushers Cas down the fire pole first. And hearing Michael outside, Sam automatically wants to take this young Dean with him to save him. But he knows this is just a projection of Dean’s mind, and taking him will not do anything and probably won’t even be possible.
“For now, let’s just recharge and get better.” He claps Cas on the shoulder as he says the second part. Dean then uses his other hand to push away his now-empty cereal bowl and turns to address Cas directly. “Can you walk?”
“Yes, though slowly and not for long.”
The path forces them close, sometimes brushing shoulders or elbows as they go. And it occurs to Dean that they always use to walk like this. He used to be so comfortable with his and Cas’s little touches and the lack of personal space.
“I’m not gonna take them off yet.” Dean says, turning back toward Cas.
“Yeah, us too, Cas. Dean?” Sam asks, looking at him expectantly. And Dean realizes it’s his turn to enter the ocean.
Before he can talk himself out of it, Dean closes the distance between them and takes Cas’s face in his hands. The moment their lips meet—
“Okay so what are these pieces and how can we find them?”
“We got some information out of it.” Dean says instead, much to Sam’s apparent relief as he continues eating his fruit. “We know that Chuck and Amara are hanging out, or at least that Chuck’s tailing her. We know that Jack can take him.”
“You go first.” Cas says.
Dean’s
“Dean,” Cas protests.
“When I told Dean that I understand why he can't, because I can't either, I meant it.”
“I know. But he is a reminder of what happened to him, to his family.”
He opens a door and shoves Sam and Cas through it, staying outside himself.
“I’m not going to do that.”
“I promise, we won’t do anything unless we’re sure Jack is safe.” Cas still doesn’t seem convinced. “Let us help you.”
“You shouldn’t have doubted in the first place. And you shouldn’t ever doubt that again.” Cas mulls this over for a long moment, and just when Sam thinks Cas isn’t going to say anything he speaks.
He quietly asks Sam and Cas, “You have the other five hearts, correct?” Sam nods.
“No, just a regular cat. She saw Amara two days ago and can show us where.” That gives Sam pause, and the two begin excitedly discussing the battle plan while Jack listens intently and Dean’s mind drifts elsewhere. There’s a word bouncing around in Dean’s head: cute. Dean thinks it’s really cute how the cat’s perched on Cas’s head like that. But it isn’t the cat that Dean thinks is cute.
Sam’s heart breaks a little bit. He’s only just started getting use to the new Charlie from the other universe. And this Charlie still isn’t their Charlie, but it’s as close as they can get working off of Dean’s memory of her.
“Romantic, Self, and Strangers left.” Sam says, more to himself than to Cas. “Is there any reasoning to the order we’re going in?”
Sam had of course noticed that Cas stood a bit straighter than most people, but until now, seeing them both at once, Sam hadn’t really realized how striking the difference is.
“Cas.” Dean whispers. He’s never been one with words, but he thinks he can manage three, “I lo—“
Chuck seems almost speechless for a moment. He taps his foot and contemplates, then turns his attention to Dean, “See, you and Sam,” he turns to address both brothers at once, “are so interesting. Somehow, you manage to surprise me. Which is pretty novel considering I’m omniscient. Normally I’m okay just rolling with it, enjoy the show and all. But some things just…” He twirls his hands in the air, searching for the words, “irk me. You know? They’re too out of left field and I’m left obsessively wondering over why you did that. I need to figure it out. So,” he turns his attention solely to Dean, “Dean, I need to understand why you kissed Castiel.”
And then Psyche-Cas pulls his hands away swiftly, turns in his chair and buries his head in his hands.
“Because I’m a protective brother.” A familiar voice answers from the door. Dean and the others turn just in time to see Chuck stretch out his hand and send them all flying into the walls. “Can’t have you killing my sister, now.” He smirks between Sam and Dean, “Surely you two should understand that.” He sounds chipper and it pisses Dean off.
Jack looks over Cas and hovers a glowing hand over his head before shaking his head. “I’m sorry,” He says, sounding completely torn up about it, “I can’t.”
Before he can talk himself out of it, Dean closes the distance between them and takes Cas’s face in his hands. The moment their lips meet—
Mrs. Butters may be gone, but Dean still has the memories, and perhaps more importantly, the pajamas.
Again, Dean feels time come to a halt, then he feels the last day of his life rewinding until he’s again at the kitchen table, eating crepes in his pajamas.
A song plays in Dean’s head, calling him here like a siren. The lyrics are in a language Dean doesn’t know, but he understands what they mean. The haunting melody sings of a secret shore, where the tide returns lost things.
Sam walks around the door to look into the passenger seat. And as he looks at it, the glove compartment pops open to reveal the shard sitting inside. Sam smiles and reaches to take it. He pats the Impala’s roof.
“I can’t do that for you, Sam.” And Psyche-Castiel looks genuinely regretful. Like he
“Are you gonna be okay?” Cas nods weakly.
“Dean’s my best friend too.” And Sam already knew that, but maybe it’s the sincerity or innocence of how Cas says it, or maybe that Cas is a powerful ancient angel, but it makes Sam smile and feel like he’s stumbled upon something profound.
Sam rolls his eyes. When Cas said they’d be going into Dean’s mind to talk to him Sam imagined something a bit more fantastical. He didn’t expect it would be running errands between different office buildings.
“We should discuss this later. After we talk with Dean.” Sam knows Cas is trying to avoid the subject, but he’s also right.
“No. And you won’t tell him either.”
“Hi, Sam.” Lisa greets Sam as he approaches the desk. From here, he can also see a young blonde woman in the back who Sam doesn’t recognize. Probably someone Dean knew while Sam was off at college.
“So protect him by helping us defeat Michael.”
“No it isn’t.”
“Sam and Cas are here and they want to talk to you about taking the heart…” they're met with silence as Jack listens to whomever’s on the other end. “Sure thing.” Jack hangs up the phone and smiles up at them. “He’ll be here in a minute.” He then seems to remember the question Sam asked just before he took to the phone. “Oh right, the boss. We’re all here to protect it but ultimately Dean’s put each piece into someone’s protection. Someone he trusts with it. The person he feels the most of that sort of love towards.” Okay, so the person Dean feels the most familial love toward.
But Psyche-Sam calls out to everyone in the office, “Hey, guys! Everyone okay with me giving Sam and Cas the heart? They need it to save Dean from Michael.” There’s some mumbling in the office. Most people nod and give Pysche-Sam thumbs ups.
“Do you want me to wait with you?” Cas asks, glancing between Sam’s and Jack’s retreating backs and Dean’s laced up boots.
“Your goal isn’t to be stronger than him,” Cas argues back, “just strong enough to be on a similar level. You demonstrated that by overpowering his attempts to ‘rewind’ time.”
Up ahead of them is a reception desk, as expected. This one has many vases of roses and other flowers on the top.
“I’m not giving it to you.”
“I apologize.” Cas says forlornly.
Sam wished he’d seen more before Cas closed up.
“What?”
Sam looks around the office. He doesn’t know most of these people. He recognizes a few, probably people they saved in hunts (or didn’t save), but he doesn’t know their names for the most part. A few names he can pick out.
“Thank you, Jimmy.” Cas tells him with such sincerity that Sam feels like he’s intruding. Sam walks out of the office and waits for Cas on the other side of the door.
“Heyyy…” Sam trails off when he remembers he doesn’t know the guy’s name, “there, dude.” He cringes at his poor save for forgetting the name. But he soldiers on. “We’re here about the heart. Can we speak to the manager, or the boss or whoever?” The ghost facer guy rolls his eyes but grabs his phone.
Sam responds, “Dude, you’re gonna get sick. Come on.”
“We’re here for the heart.” Cas tells Psyche-Cas.
“For the record, Sam, Dean doesn’t
“Dean!” Cas yells again, more urgently but Dean yells over him.
Dean’s in his room getting ready to go find Amara when there’s a knock at the door. Just from the knock, Dean can tell that it’s Cas.
“We can’t just take it from him, can we?”
But when he enters the map room, he stops in his tracks.
“Yeah.” Chuck answers with a small, nonchalant shrug. “Look, if you tell me, I’ll release all four of you. I’ll even erase everyone’s memories of this to save you any embarrassment.”
Cas takes a little bit of time before joining Sam and once again setting off into the mist.
“Of course.” Cas answers, full of compassion and care.
Cas agrees as they take out their shards to put together Dean’s heart. Sam’s learned a lot today, and he’ll be thinking about all of this a lot. But before any of that, before he even starts thinking about saving Cas so he and Dean can be happy, they have to save Dean from Michael.
“Give me a minute” Lisa says as she grabs her phone, and Sam realizes he zoned out and missed the conversation, probably just Cas explaining that they’re here for the heart.
He reaches them just as Castiel is exiting the sea, gripping a plastic ziploc bag that’s dripping onto his pants, but Castiel doesn’t seem to notice.
He explains, “Because you know, it’s my mind out there, which is scary enough.” The side of his mouth twitches up a bit in amusement, but quickly settles back to being more serious. “But Michael’s also on the loose.” Sam really hopes he didn’t come through here like he did with the other locations. Dean, even a fake projection of Dean, shouldn’t have to deal with that.
“Uh, Jack?”
“Cas…” Sam doesn’t know what to say to that. That’s a really horrible deal. But Sam knows he would have done the same to save Jack from going to the Empty. He knows that. And he knows Cas would make the same decision every time.
“How!?”
Cas is there alright, but with a black cat wrapped around his head. Dean can’t figure out exactly what the cat’s body is doing, but one paw is perched on Cas’s nose and another is digging into his cheek. It’s harder to tell where the other paws are, but Dean thinks they’re probably tangled up in Cas’s hair somewhere.
“You—” Dean starts at the same time that Cas says, “Are—“ they both stop.
“We’re being led down this path by Dean’s sub-conscience. Perhaps he’s helping us avoid Michael?”
Sam turns to look at his friend, but whereas before Sam saw his face changing from confused to whatever that shocked look was, Cas’s face is now completely closed off, carefully crafted to reveal none of his feelings or thoughts.
When Cas turns back toward Sam, gone is the stony, blank face. Cas looks overwhelmed with emotion, too many for Sam to read. But he can tell how much Cas feels.
“What’s in there?” Dean asks, pointing at the obscured contents of the bag.
Inside is a disaster.
Mrs. Butters may be gone, but Dean still has the memories, and perhaps more importantly, the pajamas.
By the way Chuck doesn’t say anything, it apparently didn’t help. Still, Chuck looks at Dean thoughtfully before finally speaking, “Maybe if we watch again.”
“You’re really sitting there sassing me?” Chuck asks with something close to a laugh. “You realize you’re a side character.” He slowly and casually approaches Cas as he speaks, “You don’t have the same plot armor that Dean and Sam do, and yet you’re sitting there, sassing me. Me! I mean… do you want to die?” Chuck’s smile fades into a dangerous glare as he reaches Cas and leans into his space, “Oh, that’s right,” Chuck says mockingly, “you can’t. Not yet. Not fully. Doesn’t mean I can’t hurt you.” Chuck reaches forward and takes hold of Cas’s hair.
“It’s not mine to give; I’m merely the heart’s guardian and Dean doesn’t want to give it to anyone.” How can Dean simultaneously trust Cas to guard the heart but also doesn't trust Cas with it?
Cas wipes away a bit more grime and smiles.
Okay, and yeah Dean hasn’t expressed real interest in anyone in a long time. He’s been having a lot fewer random hookups.
He thinks he might die. And as the merciless ocean beats down on him, cold and uncaring and relentless, all he can think of is Cas standing barefoot in the sand, offering to wait for Dean to take off his boots. Dean’s frozen in that moment.
Sam can’t see all of them, but his eyes immediately latch onto Mary, and Bobby, and Ellen, Charlie, and Cas (another Cas, not the real-Cas standing next to him, and wow is that going to be confusing) and many others milling about in the office space.
“Oh, nothing.” Chuck answers. “You guys are my favorite show. I’m just trying to get a better grasp of what happened by rewinding and rewatching.”
“Yeah, come in.” Dean answers, without even turning. Dean hears Cas gently open the door and step into the room, then close the door behind him.
“Shhhh it’s okay.” He’s talking more to himself now than to the child.
Gone is the junk covered office. Now they enter an extremely boring, nondescript place filled with different shades of beige and grey.
“Good.” He then sits down at his desk. “Lisa might let Michael in; she doesn’t know any better. But Michael can’t get through that door if it’s locked. We’ll be safe here.” There’s a crashing sound outside. Sam doesn’t feel as safe as he’d like.
“You’re okay, Dean.” Cas says into Dean’s shoulder and Dean nods.
in love.
“The cat is your lead?” Dean asks incredulously.
“I’ll keep is safe. I promise.” Sam tells him. And then Psyche-Dean reaches a little hand directly into the pie, and digs out an apple-goo covered heart shard. Which he hands to Sam delicately.
The last thing Dean remembers feeling is a snapping sensation as the world rights itself and time returns to the correct direction.
“Can I though?” Psyche-Jimmy squints at Sam, but somehow in a way that’s different than when Cas does it. “I’m dead because of you two and Dean. Lots of others here are dead because of you three.” Just then, Sam catches a glimpse of Jess across the office and he swallows down the pain. “Do you know how much it hurts him, every time he gives this piece of his heart to someone and he fails them?” Sam thinks he does. He feels the same pain. Or at least he thinks he does. “Like he failed me?”
Mrs. Butters may be gone, but Dean still has the memories, and perhaps more importantly, the pajamas.
The patient looks up at her and says, “What do you want?” Then the scene replays.
Before he can talk himself out of it, Dean closes the distance between them and takes Cas’s face in his hands. The moment their lips meet Dean’s sure Cas’s wings are back because he swears he’s flying. He’s soft and warm and it feels like coming home.
He refocuses on the Psyche-Dean in front of him, which thankfully seems like a projection of their current Dean.
He’s so small. He’s so incredibly small and Dad put all that responsibility on him. He was this small when he was put in charge of Sam’s safety, when Dad taught him how to load a shotgun with rock salt and a pistol with silver bullets. When he uprooted him from his life to travel across the country, killing and drinking and forgetting the possibility of a normal life.
Without saying anything, Castiel walks toward the ocean. Dean doesn’t even watch this time. He turns away to find a nice rock to sit on as he unlaces his boots.
He also notices Bela Talbot. Because of course. Sam rolls his eyes and hopes she isn’t the head honcho here.
“You—” Dean starts at the same time that Cas says, “Are—“ they both stop.
“Dean, it’s okay for you to be selfish sometimes.” Cas is so sincere, and the affection in his eyes is almost overwhelming. Dean wants to be selfish. And since he’s always been better with actions than words, Dean acts on that selfishness.
“That wasn’t you in there, Sam. It takes your image and is influenced by how Dean perceives you, but ultimately, it is a manifestation of Dean’s psyche. And he decided to trust us with this.” They both look down at the shard in Sam’s hands.
“Don’t you need to wash those at some point?” Sam teases as he walks into the kitchen, seeing Dean sitting at the table in said pajamas. Before Dean gets a chance to respond, Sam asks, “Did you make pancakes?”
A very attractive male patient lays on a hospital bed shirtless. Approaches a very attractive doctor, scrubs formfitting, looking at the patient with sad eyes.
Sam generally likes to think he knows Dean and can read him pretty well. And sure, he’d thought of Dean’s and Cas’s relationship as a bromance, he even teased him about the whole Destiel thing.
Sam’s still shocked, but also feels incredibly foolish for not noticing before.
With Michael on their tails, the second outweighs the first easily now, because they arrive at the door much faster than it took them to get to the “Self” door.
After clenching and un-clenching his hands a few times, Sam looks at Cas, who looks back at Sam and nods. Sam opens the door.
“Do you think…” Dean backtracks, “Aren’t black cats bad luck?”
“Cas?” He knows any sort of development is a good sign; better than wandering through darkness forever anyway. But developments could also mean danger. It could mean Michael.
“Yeah and I won’t give him the heart either. If he can’t get all the hearts then I’m safe.”
“Perhaps…”
“What was it?”
But the juxtaposition here is too strong to keep denying. What he felt toward Amara was intense and toxic and dark. Dean didn’t have a choice in the matter and he was powerless and terrified. He’s scared of this, too, but there’s no terror, and the fear is for different reasons. This isn’t toxic or dark. Cas fills Dean with light, he makes Dean want to be better. Dean has a choice and he’s always chosen Castiel. He’d told Sam that what he felt toward Amara wasn’t love. And he was right, it wasn’t love. But this warmth Dean feels for and from Cas is.
