Sherlock’s stomach twisted inside of itself at the thought of being alone in a room with Hannibal Lecter Magnussen.
Slowly, obviously sore from sitting for so long, Alexander crawled over to the door and pushed it open, and all four of them squinted into the light as their eyes adjusted, until finally they saw who had come to get them: Antonia Blake.
“Still the Capitol,” he replied, which was true. Despite all the changes that had taken place over the past ten years – all of the great changes that Sherlock wished that Mycroft was alive to see – the Capitol was still the largest city in Panem. Sherlock hated the place back then, and he hated it still, now. “Pretty uneventful, all in all,” he lied smoothly, and Hannibal didn’t even blink. John had kept his distance from Sherlock – if he had gotten any closer, Hannibal might’ve been able to smell John on him, but thankfully he couldn’t.
“Oh my god –” he whispered, stepping forward, and it only took an instant to remember what building once stood on top of the rubble – what building was missing –
As they made their way up the staircase and into the hall to his brother’s room, a single thought crossed Sherlock’s mind: Mycroft had a friend – a
He then cut a hole in her pants, and ripped the fabric apart. John started shaking as Magnussen took himself out again, and finally the cameras cut away, before it showed him doing the worst possible thing.
“Well, they should. Because I am. And now, I just wish I...I wish I could’ve been better. Let them know that I had a heart.”
In Sherlock’s hospital room, Mycroft had kissed his forehead – something he had never done since Sherlock was a child –
“Dean,” John cut him off sharply, standing, and Dean looked at John. “I’m asking you to step off,” he said, his voice low.
Nightmares of losing Sherlock had broken themselves into John’s dreaming, as of late, but really John wasn’t sure why he had been surprised the first time one had occurred. The idea of Sherlock’s loss occupied John’s every thought and feeling, and it was now extremely obvious that it was occupying Sherlock’s too, driving him mad with fright.
And so he did. He went off, locked himself in his room, shot up with Morphling one last time (the twenty-four hour mark was going to pass within the next few hours), just to get him through this, and poured his heart onto the pieces of paper that became Mycroft Holmes’ eulogy.
“Hm,” Sherlock nodded. John. God, he missed John. But he was going to see him that night – in mere hours – and the thought of that alone jumpstarted his brain into full alertness. “Is that ice cream?”
“You’re lying, Sherlock,” Harry said in a sing-song voice, and he glanced at her to see that she was grinning ear to ear, eyeing him knowingly.
The map in the corner of the screen tracked her movements as she closed in on the border, leaving the Ghosts’ sector and entering the next – John checked the list – Tracker Jackers –
“Sorry – couldn’t exactly leave a note. I was just here,” she said, gesturing the clearing. “You nodded off – I figured it had something to do with the tracker jackers since you never sleep at home, so I let you get some rest.”
So just after Dean stood up and told the others he was going to be in his room for the night, a thought occurred to John – one that hadn’t crossed his mind in months – and he used a trip to the washroom as an excuse to make his way to Dean’s room.
After fifteen eternities (or so it felt), they were finally done and they left him naked to wait for Cinna. The moment they stopped touching him the robe that he had been clinging desperately to was back on his body, even though he knew from what John had told him that he would be taking it right back off again. On any other day, at any other time, he wouldn’t have cared a bit about being stripped naked and put under the eyes of someone who wasn’t John or Mycroft. In fact, there were countless summer days where Sherlock spent the day with nothing but a sheet wrapped around him when he didn’t feel like showering, and if Mycroft ever stepped on the edge to piss Sherlock off he would just walk away with the sheet still under Mycroft’s foot (whenever John was around, though, Sherlock only threatened to do so, which Mycroft knew wasn’t a bluff). But today – here – he would’ve given anything to have a pair of pants. The Capitol had no right to do this to him – first off to send him here and into their Arena, but to also strip him of everything he was, making sure his dignity was torn to shreds. First they took his name, and now they put his body – his body that he could not and would not change – under a microscope, and made rude comments about his relationship with John, which they had no right to say. They had no right to do any of this.
As soon as he stood up, he felt more pain spreading throughout his body, and he upped his Morphling intake to the highest amount. He then looked down at himself, and discovered he was in nothing but a stark-white hospital gown, one that matched his bedsheets and the walls around him now that the florescent lights were on. His eyes swept over the room, seeing if any of the nurses had kept his clothes out, but when he found there were no clothes to be seen, he went on with his mission.
“You did great!” she exclaimed, kissing Sherlock’s cheek, and then Harry’s before giving them room to breathe. “Oh my god – I’m so sorry I wasn’t able to come meet with you two before the recap; there was so much we had to get done today and John’s been lonely as hell, so –”
to every limit you possess,” he said, sending a chill down John’s spine. “I’m curious to see what will happen to you.”
He was only aware of two specific people who had not taken the stage to speak: himself, because it wasn’t his time yet, and Clover Frankland, because she couldn’t, as her hands were still bandaged from the Battle.
“Of course you did,” he breathed, as if cursing himself that he hadn’t thought of that before, when he should of – that five minutes’ conversation was all it took for Sherlock to fall in love –
“I...I need a break,” he admitted finally, and Harry helped him sit down against the wall of the hedge.
“Don’t be – what could you have done differently?” he asked, and before John could give him the first answer that came to his mind –
There was an unbearable silence, Sherlock’s hand waiting between them, shaking slightly, as Magnussen thought about Sherlock’s demand. Finally, he shrugged, removed his glasses, and put them in Sherlock’s outstretched hand.
interested in personal privacy, which he never was before because, well, I’m me, and according to Mycroft I have no idea what a sense of privacy even
John refused to sleep that night; every time he closed his eyes he could see Sherlock and Harry falling dead in the Arena, and feel Charles Augustus touch John’s body in ways he was terrified to think about.
Sherlock nodded, vaguely remembering. He shouldn’t be scared – he was never scared – but he was, and since he was, his mind was a mess. Suddenly, he looked at John, his voice urgent as he spoke.
And then, the worst feeling of them all flooded through him: he wanted to tell everyone every little thing within him. About John, about Mycroft, about the Games, about Harry. Even about his mother. Even about his failed sex attempt with John the night before he went into the Arena. Even that he was an addict. Even that he was high right that very second.
Sherlock entered the room as cautiously as he could, fully aware of the fact that Hannibal could be anywhere in the room, ready to avenge his brother, but he found Hannibal fairly quickly – Hannibal Lecter Magnussen stood across the room with his back to the door, looking out the window on the farthest wall.
“But his sister – his sister is refusing to go on if she doesn’t see him – it’ll just be for a minute, sir –”
Unable to do much else, Sherlock watched as Harry took her jacket out of her bag and laid it down on the ground, and let her lay him down upon the makeshift bed and run her fingers through his hair, keeping it out of his face. It felt so nice, despite the fact that they were both covered head-to-toe in a heavy red substance – blood, Sherlock was sure – but he wasn’t sure if it was a hallucination or not.
“No – no no no no no Sherlock –” she gasped, wiping his face of the red rain – blood? – and lightly slapping his cheeks. “Sherlock wake up –”
Which led John, once he was finished with his nightly routine, to stand alone, stranded on the island of the doorway to his room’s bathroom, leaning against the doorframe, staring at Sherlock, who was sat on his own private island, although he probably didn’t see it that way – sitting on John’s bed. They were once again alone together in the world of John’s bedroom, but separated by miles compacted within just a few feet and a few words that needed to be said.
John was glad that Sherlock had listened – that he had dropped it, but something inside of him wanted Sherlock to keep pushing – to keep trying to get John to say something – because maybe, just maybe, then John might have.
John looked to Sherlock, who was silent beside him during the various exchanges taking place within the car. He watched as his boyfriend followed each conversation with only his eyes, his face unchanging as his eyes darted back and forth.
He had seen them sticking out of trees in the woods with John – the first sign of human activity beyond the fence that they had ever found – and so Sherlock used the spile the only way he had seen it used.
“This ‘shaky hand’ as you so eloquently put it is just the tip of the iceberg, Will. This illness will take my body and mind more and more, until I am just a shell of the man I used to be, and when I am just a body, unable to move or speak or think, I will drown in my own saliva, covered in ulcers and laying in my own filth. Could you imagine that, Will? Someone like me reduced to something like that? I simply can’t have it, but the tremors started about two weeks ago, and my speech is already beginning to slur.”
“Oh. Can I go on your shoulders, Daddy?” Hamish asked, and Sherlock let go of his hand, only to scoop him up and set him upon his shoulders, putting him directly in front of the marble face of Mycroft Holmes. “Hi, Uncle Myc,” he said happily, and planted a kiss on the statue’s nose.
like John – I’m not –” he skipped over the word, the word that would make him the faggot Gideon Jones always said he was. “– he’ll never like me, I shouldn’t like him – the body’s just a transport – I don’t like anyone – I will
John asked, being the first person to speak once Sherlock had finished his explanation. “Can’t he wait until
For the first time ever, John was glad to be in the Capitol. They arrived the night of the tour’s stops in Districts 1 and 2, practically falling into their beds. The next morning, Sherlock and John were woken early to be prepped for the victor’s check-in interview with Caesar Flickerman.
toes in line to keep him safe. And as the idea bounced around in his head, John realized that even the
“The same way you live with Sherlock, I imagine,” she replied, a smirk playing at her face, and John nodded, looking back up at the screen, focused on Sherlock and Harry whisper to each other in the dark.
“That’s Louise’s brother, isn’t it?” John had asked the day Mycroft revealed that piece of information.
“I have ideas, but I don’t know for sure. I observe people’s behaviors and make inferences based off of that information; I’m not a mind reader. I’d need to see Snow up close in order to figure it out, but, as we all know, Snow rarely speaks to people who he views are lesser than him.”
“Alright – that’s fine – perfect,” Sherlock said, and with that, Hannibal made his way to where Dean had previously stood at the podium.
John, just let him go around and do whatever he wanted. It was the only time John didnt' feel like he had to
John and Mycroft reached the main room, which looked like a laboratory, and the first thing John noticed was a Peacekeeper, his hands behind his back, attached to a pipe near the wall, unconscious.
“Right,” Louise said. “I still can’t believe they’re doing that to you. You guys have been separated for days already, and Sherlock nearly died in the Arena – twice – and now you’ve got to wait even longer to see him. And your sister – your
“I’m fine –” Sherlock repeated. “Um, I’ve gotta – I’m gonna walk home by myself today – mind palace,” he muttered as an excuse, already turning away from John as he spoke.
He hadn’t known their names that day – he had deleted it from his hard drive – leaving room for only Magnussen to take up his focus.
“John!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed, practically bowling John over and into Alexander as she hugged him. Suddenly, he felt the urge to hug her back, and, forgetting for a second that his arms were restrained, he pulled at his handcuffs. Mrs. Hudson didn’t seem to notice the cuffs or the Peacekeeper behind him as she kissed his cheeks. “Oh, it’s been for
Of course she would be crying – her three year old brother, Archie, was a tribute in the Hunger Games. Her three year old brother just left her side to get prepped – to get plucked and shaved and washed and scrubbed until his skin was raw. John shivered at the thought. He had barely survived it without crying out in pain – how the hell would Archie get through it?
Dean, still squinting at Sherlock, still trying to figure out if he was lying or not, slowly began to nod.
“Well, you both just lost your older brothers, just days apart – neither of you have any family left –”
It might’ve been the deadly concoction of booze and morphling Sherlock had ingested that day, or the crippling loneliness that was quickly forming a place in his heart, but Sherlock found himself taking the next train to the Capitol before he could fully consider the consequences of his actions.
“Who was it?” Sherlock found himself asking, suddenly hungry for a name. He didn’t want anything else – just his name.
“Shame,” he said, and took a step forward, into the light. For the first time in person, Sherlock Holmes saw Hannibal Lecter Magnussen’s face. “A low heartrate is a true indicator of one’s capacity for violence,” he explained. “Your choices affect the physical structures of your brain. Killing changes the way you think.”
He found his right lung, and plunged the sword through, through his whole body, until the sword tore through his back. He then twisted the sword and pulled out, and pushed Magnussen down on the ground, on his back. Sherlock then punctured the other lung, and Magnussen cried out in pain. He stepped on him to hold him down, stepping directly on the first wound for good measure, and then a thought occurred to him.
As soon as he decided this, his foot slid out of the boot. He curled into a ball, wrapping his arms around his head to protect himself, and then he landed – right on his back.
“Nah; too anxious,” John replied, leaning against the doorway. “It’s so hard knowing they’re in the same building but I can’t go see them.”
“I know that Mrs. Hudson’s supposed to give me cards I’m to read. Other than that...I dunno, be myself? Do what I’ve always done?”
At once, the celebration over Harry’s score stopped, and everyone’s eyes were on Sherlock, their jaws on the floor.
“Some of the Avoxes are janitors – they’ve been working on this since before everyone arrived for the Quell,” Alexander explained, pulling on the bricks more, and John discovered that he wasn’t just pulling out bricks – the Avoxes had broken down the wall to make a hole at about waist-level, just big enough for someone to crawl through, and then built a door out of bricks to cover the gap.
Sherlock saw it now – how could he have been so blind? Mycroft had believed – he had believed this whole time – that Sherlock would get both of them out of the Arena, alive.
As soon as he was gone, Mycroft went to the nearest bench against the wall, sat down, and put his heads in his hands. Didn’t you know Mycroft had five heads? That’s right: he was secretly Hiram McDaniels, the five headed dragon. This is just all one complicated way of saying that I wanted Hiram McDaniels for Night Vale mayor. I’m kidding, of course. I was team Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives In Your Home all the way.
He forced the words out, feeling like a moron for speaking to the animal, but then the Stag moved out of his way.
“But you might’ve done the same if it had gone any further,” Mycroft reminded him. “Sherlock just reacted first.”
“It’s a branding. He does it...with everyone he...” he drifted off, letting his tears fall. “You remember Helen Hewlett, from District One? He’s done this stuff to her since before she can remember –
“Right –” John said, already having enough, balling up his fists and trying to move past Charles Augustus. When Charles Augustus stepped in his way, John felt the urge to shove him to get him to move – he might have even raised his hands to do so –
There were moments where good times were recounted, and soft, tearful laughter tittered throughout the crowd, and there were times where the speaker was sobbing so badly they couldn’t get a word out, even though they wanted to – even though they tried. Sometimes John felt like he was intruding on something he shouldn’t be seeing – there were times where he wanted to leave, for he didn’t know these people and he never would and he shouldn’t be part of their families’ final goodbyes – but something kept him there.
Sherlock looked around the crowded auditorium as if he had just realized that there were other people there, and then he returned his gaze to Dean.
Mycroft’s eyes searched John, and John could feel himself being deduced – he could almost feel Mycroft’s brain at work, trying to solve the mystery of what exactly had been done.
At one point, John looked to the front of the audience, where he saw one man sitting down on the floor, facing the opposite direction of everyone else – facing away from Dean. It took a moment for John to see who he was kneeling before realizing why: the man was signing, translating Dean’s words for Clover Frankland, who was sitting in the seat in front of him. Someone from District Ten must’ve come for Clover’s benefit – a friend of hers, maybe, or a family member of the deceased – for Clover didn’t have much family left to call her own to sign for her.
He decided that the proper thing to do was to at least express some sort of polite comfort and did so by quietly mumbling one without looking at her while doing so.
“I’ll look into that,” he had murmured and then made his excuses before Mycroft could come up with anything else that pointed out how neglectful John had become of his duties.
John’s hand lashed out against that pale, still somewhat damp cheek and Sherlock’s head flew back from the impact but beyond that his features didn’t change, he didn’t look surprised, he merely stared at John, his eyes completely blank.
There were other things they could do to occupy themselves as well, and as he looked over at Sherlock, lounging in the chair opposite him, he could feel how much he had missed the man these past couple of days. Just like this, for his use only, with nothing to disturb them.
John felt the discreet tingle in his fingers out of a desire to smack his friend over the head for his insolence, but there was a fear that such actions would actually provoke Sherlock into doing something irrational out of pure spite.
He had been shot while in the middle of some unsavoury act with the other motionless body in the room, Sherlock who was positioned just as John had seen him earlier, but now with his eyes closed, as if merely asleep.
“Why does it matter? You made it clear this morning that my actions were not up to your standard. So I decided to focus on my own personal and far more interesting investigation instead.”
“Keep your phone ready, however finds him first or ends up in trouble needs to reach out. I have my gun but...”
But before he had the opportunity open his mouth to express his misgivings in a way that would actually make the other man listen for once, Sherlock snapped his head up in an exasperated gesture, accompanied by an impatient sigh.
John had felt a cold lump of dread form in his chest when hearing those words. Had he been slipping, become too negligent, only bothering with what Sherlock had to offer and not made sure that their scheme would not be exposed?
“My theory is that he indulged on something throughout the evening, he was uncharacteristically subdued and solemn during the whole dinner party.”
Quickly he pushed it away, he had no time for diversions and right now they needed to go down for dinner, he had a conference call at nine that he couldn’t neglect and he needed some time to prepare for it.
But he simply couldn’t gather the will to end this blissful moment by rising and prepare himself for his departure. The more time he spent with Sherlock, the more reluctant to leave he became by each visit.
He stepped out on a small balcony to clear his head in the crisp chilly air and it was on that balcony he had been standing when the presence of another person finally snapped him out of his thoughts. He was escorted down to the waiting black car with the tinted windows and the surly chauffeur. At least one familiar detail in this chaos of conflicted emotions and confusion.
He would probably argue and fight with him on many more times to come, get angry, lash out, despair over his behaviour. But he would never leave as long as Sherlock didn’t ask him to.
The whole gun wielding incident had been unfortunate though and it spoke loudly of the irrational mood Victor was currently suffering from at the moment.
But a larger part of him had no interest in listening to that voice, he was completely ready to jump straight back into the shark tank, heart and soul exposed, ready for the sharp teeth of heartache and jealousy to tear into him again, if only for the opportunity to put his arms around that lithe beautiful body once more.
“No why would that topic come up in conversation? I didn’t know who you were until I met you at the dinner party. Your world is not exactly my area.”
The chauffeur was Mycroft’s so he waited for his employer to confirm the order. When Mycroft gave him a short nod he started the car and they were off.
It was too murky in the room and he was too tired to see any details properly but he immediately flinched in shock and then quickly began reaching for his service gun that he still, out of habit, kept nearby within reach.
“My original strategy had been to hold on to the stolen plans for a day just to spite him, then return them by dropping them in his lap at breakfast, taunting him with the fact that I had broken into his office and stolen something of importance underneath his nose, naturally threatening him with a repeat performance if he didn’t stop interfering with my life.
He needed Magnussen to take him to Dr Roylott after all. Whatever retaliation his mind could conjure up in the meantime, it would have to wait until afterwards, when Sherlock was back safe and sound.
With thoughts of retaliation still whirling around in his head, he stepped into the room and joined Mycroft who had positioned himself by the fire while Magnussen had opted for seating himself in one of the chairs, a wing-backed monstrosity that made him look more like a character from a Hammer horror movie than a man of this century.
“He is a successful businessman, not everything he has achieved is based on blackmail and leverage,” John pointed out but knew that Mycroft likely wouldn’t foresee his expressed outcome for Magnussen without some knowledge in the matter.
was more correct, presented in the past tens, as Sherlock no longer was interested in pursuing the case, probably deciding to focus on the mystery guest completely instead. Or even forgoing the whole matter entirely if DI Lestrade called with a more tempting offer.
He truly was a pitiable creature, a rare combination of melodrama, jealousy and hatred that Mycroft had difficulty enduring. If Sherlock had somehow been a part of making him this way or if this was all his own doing was difficult to say, but that the two of them should never have met was evident for everyone except Victor.
But for pretence sake, because Sherlock needed to learn that manipulations were no longer going to work between them, he cleared his throat and gave a grim glare:
John climbed into the backseat and felt the humming sensation of expectancy as he was driven the short ride over to the large house he had visited yesterday. But this time he was not brought inside and Mycroft was not there to greet him.
But he did agree with Magnussen on one thing: it was much more preferable to be on the team that dictated the rules of the game, rather than being the one others toyed with, for sheer amusement.
“Of course I’m bloody upset, Sherlock! I’ve just found out that the man I’ve been sleeping with for the past couple of months is a damn junkie, and not only that, he has been lying and manipulating me for weeks, doing his very best not to expose his secret. According to Mycroft you’re running a drug lab in your room and tonight you were close to dying from an overdose, and yet you have the gall to sound surprised that I’m disappointed in you??! Disappointment doesn’t even begin to describe it!”
“What if I was to tell you that there might still actually be a chance for us to gain our freedom back and get out of this game unharmed?”
Before Mycroft managed to open his mouth, John had grabbed him by his arms and with a wild stare looked him straight in the eye.
When John and Mycroft climbed the steps to follow, it almost looked like Dr Roylott was about to stand in their way, but then, as if changing his mind, he turned his back to them and went inside, allowing them entrance by removing himself.
Mycroft silently prayed that Magnussen at least would have the common sense to keep his photos of Sherlock to himself, especially considering that they were all sitting in a helicopter that was already jittery to begin with. He held no doubt that, if provoked sufficiently, John would resort to physical violence and where would that lead them? Worst case scenario was a full-blown crash down a field in the middle of nowhere, and if possible, he wished to avoid such a humiliating fate to an otherwise distinguished existence.   It would hardly benefit Magnussen to end his days in such a scenario either.
Damn it! Personalizing a quote from the Godfather was hardly any better than quoting James Bond, but if Mycroft thought that he tried to make fun of the situation, he didn’t let it show, in fact he didn’t so much as bat an eyelid. Instead he just carried on as if John hadn’t said anything.
He had never been this duped in his entire life and it smarted to realise how easily it had been done. Take a lonely desperate man craving for affection, put stars in his eyes by giving him exactly what he wants and off he went, no wonder Sherlock was so surprised by how easily it had all gone down.
Hurriedly he gathered the pile of clothes he so neatly had folded for this occasion specifically and then he headed for the window.
The remains of Magnussen had been found not far from the gate, ironically just a few feet away from freedom.
Just as John waits to see what will happen next, as he usually doesn’t stick around to see the aftermath when things turn toxic between the Holmes brothers, he hears the sound of the door being unlocked behind his back, so he presses the pause button and turns around to face the person he assumes must be Mycroft, hopefully coming to deliver some news, but likely is here simply to stare disapprovingly at the glass of whiskey and John’s finger on the remote.
“He doesn’t exactly strike me as the romantic type of man at all. More sexual predator than sensual lover if I’m honest. That car ride was all about spurning his advances by the way, I'll have to thank Mycroft for that later. He should consider pimping me out to a less sex-driven individual next time. When we finally reached Magnussen’s flat, I had been forced to endure far more than my brother’s suggested peck on the cheek. Luckily for me, things got more interesting when we entered the building.”
He has not yet managed to rid himself of the feeling of regret whenever he considers that he went to work while Jeremy Marcus most likely already had Sherlock in his possession.
"Thanks," John grins, leaning back into Sherlock's hands. When the suds are rinsed completely from the blonde locks, Sherlock's hands come down over John's shoulders and his arms wrap around the smaller boy's torso. In return, John loops his own arms backwards around Sherlock's neck.
that much about the taller boy, but he's pretty confident that he wouldn't do what Anderson accused him of. And yet there was notable tension between him and Victor on Friday, so much that you could cut the air with a knife. Victor was... nervous. Timid, almost. And Sherlock? Well he just looked
"I have to get it done, Shez," Victor doesn't throw him off, but he does gently prise his arm away. "Mr N will go batty if I have another outstanding homework."
"Oh, I've done a number of things," Sherlock says, and he begins counting them off on his fingers. "Oh, let's see. I had a shower. I slept. Did the homework that's actually worth my time. Watched a film. Breathing, did a lot of breathing. Blinking, too. Oh, and-"
"Oh, come on Sherlock," John sighs. "I know there's bad blood between the two of you, but he's hardly going to make a scene in the middle of a
"That's so fucking rude," he comments and Sherlock just shrugs again. He stops at the end of a corridor.
"I'm not," Sherlock says, with a shrug. "Ask him if you don't believe me, I'm sure he'll have no trouble in telling you. Why don't we phone him right now in fact? I-"
John observes. Evidently something of a loner - he's been by himself every time John's seen him, although that is only twice. He hopes he's not intruding. John can't tell
John. Why you're so very concerned with what happened between Victor Trevor and I, I don't know. I was wrong about everything to do with the boy, and I learned the hard way that caring is
"We can make a pitstop. You're getting wet. Get in," he says, and this time John does so immediately. He has a small fight with the old, stiff seatbelt and then takes a second to look around the car. It's so not-Sherlock that it's almost alarming - he himself is always so put together, so
"He's okay," he says, though he doesn't really know for sure. Sherlock doesn't ever really show any emotions one way or the other and seems horribly embarrassed any time his stoic façade slips. The only time he's ever really gotten animated about anything, it's been about Victor. Usually, he wouldn't say anything, but the four lagers that he's sunk make John that bit braver.
"Did you want the whiskey?" Vic offers the open bottle to Sherlock, who closes the gap between them and takes a long hard swig. He drops the bottle and it breaks, shards of glass and amber liquid splashing around their feet. Vic barely has time to let out a small noise of surprise before Sherlock has grabbed his shirt collar, backed him against the wall and kissed him - no chasteness or gentleness to it. It's all raw, carnal, animal passion; a violent storm of lust and anger.
"Only me!" Harry's voice comes from the porch. They hear her kick of her shoes and she pads through into the front room.
"It's a maybe," he says, because he's Sherlock, and he'll never fully change his mind. But for John, he's willing to meet halfway. It's good enough for the little blond and he bounces up to the balls of his feet so he can kiss the tip of Sherlock's nose.
When they get in, John removes his shoes. He always takes his shoes off at Sherlock’s house because it’s carpeted all the way through with pale colours and John’s really conscious of making marks. Sherlock keeps them on, clearly not giving a shit. He goes out of his way to piss of his dad and brother most of the time, and this is probably one of his acts of rebellion, John thinks.
"Um. Hi, Sherlock," he says and, although reminiscent of a child who's just been severely told off, it's the least unpleasant way in which John's heard anyone speak to Sherlock since he came here.
you," John shifts uncomfortably, because he's not entirely sure how trueit is. "She just think you're a bit... she thinks you're..."
It's a longer kiss than last time - they actually get to move their lips together this time. John's definitely the more experienced, so Sherlock lets him take control, just going with everything John does. Kissing is totally new to him, and he's pleasantly surprised that it's infinitely better than the research he's done. John's lips are full and soft and he tastes faintly of tea and toast and spearmint chewing gum. Gentle, calloused fingers weave their way into Sherlock's curls and, after a moment's hesitation, his own hands rest on John's hips. Seconds later, the big light snaps on and they hear a gasp on the other side of the room.
It's hot in the house, so John comes to cool off out in the back garden. It's quiet - the rainstorm that ended ten minutes ago had pushed everyone inside, and it doesn't look like many people have been brave enough to come back out yet. The only other person in Victor, sitting on a rusty old swingset and smoking. He smiles at John as soon as he steps out, waves him to sit on the next swing over.
"Great," Sherlock breathes, squeezing John's hand. That's encouragement enough for John, who gently pushes Sherlock down until he's lying flat on the bed. John goes to lie down beside him, but Sherlock pulls him down on top instead. They lie like that for a bit, Sherlock's hands resting on the small of John's back, John propping himself up on his forearms so he can smile down at the tall, slim boy underneath him. And God, he's never noticed before how truly gorgeous Sherlock is. His face is pratically angelic, framed by those soft black curls. And
But then, is holding hands really such a far shout from cuddling? They very casually snuggle up together all the time, and that always feels pretty natural. Holding hands is much more intimate, John realises. Lots of friends cuddle (admittedly usually girl-girl friends, but that's beside the point) but holding hands is a couple thing. It's something people do when they're together. John knows he should pull away, but his hands are cold, and the feeling of Sherlock's glove against his icy skin isn't totally unpleasant.
"He really is," he agrees. "Taught me how to do it, actually. Never quite got the hang of it as well as he seemed to."
"I don't like her, not like that," Sherlock insists. "And beauty's subjective. She's got nice hair and eyes, I suppose but her mouth is too small and so are her breasts. We're going shopping because I have things to buy and she offered to come with me."
"Charming as ever, Amelia," Sherlock quips, lightly. "Judging from the way you were practically just throwing yourself at Philip, I'm assuming Robert finally saw sense? I must congratulate him. I never thought he'd open his eyes."
"You wouldn't understand so don't try," he states. Evidently he wants to leave it there, but John reaches out, puts a hand on top of his.
It's cause for some concern - generally, Sherlock arrives at an ungodly hour, before the school is even technically open. But the librarian, Mr-Lestrade-but-call-me-Greg is always there at an even more ridiculous hour, coming in at stupid-o'clock to make sure Sherlock has somewhere to go when he arrives at the crack of dawn. He doesn't even look up from his computer screen when John walks in and he says "Morning Sherlock."
of kissing Sherlock per se, he'd just rather not have everyone know he snogged a bloke last night, that's all. He finds himself almost dreading seeing the taller boy sensing the inevitable awkwardness that only he would feel; Sherlock seems to have no concept of awkwardness at all, and if he does he hides it well.
It was only then that John let Mycroft put the cuffs on him. Once they were comfortable for John, Mycroft assumed the positon of a Peacekeeper set to relocate his prisoner from the laboratory they were in to Caesar Flickerman’s interview across the street from the training center. He placed his hands on John – one on his shoulder to steer him, and the other on his handcuffed wrists to keep them in place, and they exited through the door on the right side of the room and started down a long, dimly lit hallway together, leaving the real Peacekeeper behind.
Alexander Waters was one of the last people to share his story, about two months into the meetings, in a quiet voice that John had never heard him use before, all of his usual charisma gone:
; you haven’t missed a thing though, don’t worry,” the only man in the team assured him, which sounded contradictory in Sherlock’s head. But then again, everything about the Capitol was contradictory in some way or another.
“Promise me,” Sherlock begged, cutting him off. “I never want to hurt you like that again, or embarrass you, or anyone who doesn’t legitimately deserve it, and you never deserved it –”
The winters were always difficult for Mycroft; John could at least get away from his Arena, but Mycroft’s Arena came to him every year. Mycroft did a good job of hiding his flashbacks, but Sherlock had learned one thing over the years: Mycroft only smoked when his mind got to be too much.
When I first wrote the epilogue for Constantly, I originally planned for Sherlock to keep Hannibal reaching out to him a secret, but after writing it, I couldn't keep a line from chapter 71 out of my head: No more secrets. I felt like it went back on the character development if Sherlock turned around and, YEARS later, lied to John and kept secrets from him again. So, I fixed it.
Little by little, John got to know each of the Magnussen victims – the people that he shared the most in common with, trauma-wise. He listened to their stories, each one more tragic than the last, and he found himself growing attached to a few of them; befriending them, more or less. There was a twenty-year-old girl who attended the meetings while her boyfriend stayed home watching her five-year-old son – a boy who she loved to death but sometimes couldn’t bear to look at, simply because he had Charles Augustus Magnussen’s facial features. There was also a fourteen year old girl who had fallen pregnant with the last Magnussen baby – she started talking to John because of the medical experience he had mentioned off-handedly during one of the meetings, but the two became friends after a while.
“Yes, you were,” John cut him off, and when Sherlock glanced at Harry, his face very subtly wishing her luck, John waved him away. “No, don’t look at her, just go,” he ordered, and, standing, Sherlock finally obeyed.
Antonia’s eyes fell on them, and even though they had just won a war – and even though Sherlock’s brother had just died – John could see her challenging them to say something about what she knew they were both thinking.
“Think about the Hunger Games, Mycroft. I imagine you’ve seen footage of all of them. Why do you think we have a winner?” Before Mycroft could open his mouth to reply, he went on. “I mean, if I just wanted to intimidate the districts, why not round up twenty-four people at random and execute them all at once? It would be a lot faster, don’t you think?”
Then, suddenly, John was leaning his forehead up against Sherlock’s curls, and whispering in his ear: “Do you want to go?”
“I remember,” John replied, but shook her hand anyway. “But, um, not to be rude but, why are you here?”
“And am I allowed refuse this?” Sherlock asked. “Or would I immediately be arrested for saying no to the President of Panem?”
“It doesn’t matter. It’s never mattered to me,” John promised. “You don’t need to give me anything – and if we were to, I’d rather you do it because you really wanted to, not because you thought you had to.”
“Can’t do anything about it now,” Dean sighed, shrugging. “But for Christ’s sake, Sherlock, could you
The hot water seared his skin, burning him to his bones, waking him up more than a cold shower could. He could feel it in every pore, and, wanting the fire to envelop him, he put his head underwater.
“You...” he looked down, trying to find the words – trying to find any words – to describe how he felt. “I hate you,” he whispered, but it didn’t feel right.
“We do too, Hamish. We do, too,” John agreed. “I can’t believe it’s been another year,” he added, after a moment.
“Right,” Sherlock said, taking another scoop of ice cream. “So...whose idea was this? Surely not Mrs. Hudson’s.”
Gideon was in Sherlock and John’s class, and was one of the people who had seen Sherlock and John interact the most out of anyone in their school. He, like every other boy (and even some of the girls) at school, had it out for Sherlock, especially after Sherlock deduced the fact that his father hit him when he was drunk. Sherlock tried to avoid him at all costs – Sherlock even went as far as to make sure that he left each and every classroom after Gideon to ensure that he wouldn’t be followed – but today, apparently, Gideon had forgotten something in the classroom, and was forced to double back, passing Sherlock in the hall.
Grab the tribute’s leg, pull him off-balance, call out to Harry as the tribute falls out of the tree, jump out of the tree himself, and then kill both of the tributes who had made the attempt to end Harry’s life. It was easy – he could do it.
But Sherlock didn’t care, because for the first time in weeks, he felt somewhat at ease. He was alive, he wasn’t about to die, he wasn’t consumed by guilt or by the responsibility of keeping Harry alive, and he was surrounded by everything that made him think of John. As he crawled under the covers of John’s bed and drifted off to sleep, he idly thought how the only thing missing from this scene was John himself. His heart ached for a moment before remembering that, by this time tomorrow, he would be in John’s arms once more, on the way back to District 12, where they could finally –
game. I told him that the people who lost didn’t die – they just couldn’t play anymore. I told him the other tributes from District Nine were so embarrassed by their losses that they never leave their houses, which is why no one sees them. He’s not even upset by the Games – he just doesn’t like being in this place that he doesn’t understand. He doesn’t even understand why I cry. He says he’s not going to hide if he loses. I want to tell him – I want to tell him so badly – I
“Of course – your brother and the closest thing you’ve got to a sister get out of the Hunger Games alive and you
Although it felt fine just a moment ago, John’s room all the sudden felt too small for Sherlock – he could feel the walls of John’s bedroom beginning to close in upon him – there was no physical evidence of this, of course, but he could
The Capitol’s speech was over, and he quickly opened the envelope that contained Victor’s speech – wanting to get it over with before he lost all of the little strength he had to just stand there and speak –
“Mayhem this is Antarctica; I’ve got Mind and we’re on our way,” Mycroft muttered, and Sherlock looked up to find him pocketing something that looked like a portable phone.
I got a comment from Beatrice, and I'm sure she'd mind if I put out the ENTIRE thing, but there was a few things that she said that I really wanted to reply to in a public post, so I'll quote a few things and reply to them here:
One of the doctors was right next to his ear, cutting the stitches on his shoulder that Harry had given him and flushing out the infection with some ice cold liquid; two other doctors were at his hands, removing the shattered pieces of Magnussen’s glasses from his knuckles; the fourth doctor wasn’t a doctor at all but a nurse, simply helping out by giving the doctors the tools they requested and keeping an eye on Sherlock’s vitals.
“Of course,” Sherlock cut him off, before he could complete the sentence. “A moment,” he went on, covering the mouthpiece of the phone as he turned around. “John?” he called to his boyfriend, who had been sitting on the sofa behind him the whole time, writing, not really listening to Sherlock before that moment. John looked up, and Sherlock offered him the phone. “It’s for you.”
“Good point,” Harry replied. “Well, the hearings start in less than twenty minutes – if Dean asks I’ll let him know you’re on your way.”
The men talked to Mycroft as if they were old friends – they probably were, considering they visited every year. The older man – the man with the glass eye, whose name John had forgotten already – smiled down at Sherlock as he took John’s hand.
physical sign of support. Normally, this wouldn’t have been an issue, but today – right now – it was. Sherlock wanted to look like he was dethatching himself from his friends – legitimately considering Hannibal’s offer – and he couldn’t do that if he was still kissing his boyfriend and hugging his boyfriend’s sister. He had to make sure that, when Hannibal was watching him – and he
Lastly, this was all damage control. If they didn’t do this now and another rebellion was made, the people who fought against Snow and the Capitol would be in the same boat faster than they could even imagine.
give a genuine, real deduction – one that was not only coherent, detailed, but also within an acceptable timeframe (which, for Sherlock, was within half a second to about a minute) – it left John and Harry in shock, as opposed to in awe or in a state of being so used to it they weren’t even surprised.
In the beginning, when John first came home from the Arena, it was so incredibly hard to love Sherlock. It had nothing to do with Sherlock himself as much as it had to do with John. If it wasn’t for Sherlock confessing his undying love and causing the Capitol to blow up their love story to unbelievable heights, when John got home he would’ve probably locked himself in his room and never spoken to anyone ever again. The only thing that kept him in touch with the rest of the world – kept him human – was Sherlock Holmes. At first, it felt like he was just going through the motions of love – kissing when kissed, smiling when smiled at – the only thing that came naturally to him was holding Sherlock’s hand, because it grounded him. Of course John loved Sherlock, but it’s hard to love anyone while you don’t even know yourself, anymore. But John was learning – over the past year, everything was becoming as natural as breathing. Now he couldn’t imagine living without Sherlock’s love – without kissing him every day – without waking up every morning and falling asleep every night by his side. He had been ready to let his life begin – he had been ready to be happy with Sherlock – to show Sherlock every bit of what his heart was feeling. He wanted to grow old with Sherlock – get married to Sherlock – maybe even make love to him if they both ever stopped beating around the bush about it. He wanted Sherlock, and, for about nine months, it had seemed like he was going to have him.
When Sherlock first discovered the Stag that was following him, John’s chest seized up, afraid that Sherlock would try to attack him on instinct and trigger an aggressive response, but luckily he didn’t. And so, Sherlock was able to pass by the Nightmare Stag, and it followed behind him, a good ten feet back.
John was lucky last year – his Arena was on a raised platform. The only way to get to the force field was finding a way around the anti-drop technology that they also put around the tribute buildings to keep the tributes from committing suicide by jumping off the side. But not everyone was so lucky – there had been times where the tributes were either paralyzed or straight up killed over simply touching the barrier.
"No problem, darling," he says, and John's taken aback by the pet name. He's never heard Sherlock call anyone by any kind of pet name before (except last year when he got in an argument with a teacher and called her 'sweetheart', but that was sarcastic and condescending, not affectionate). He doesn't really know how to respond, so he doesn't. Instead, he squeezes Sherlock's fingers in return and smiles at him.
"Tell who? And tell them what? My dad's a prick? Hardly think they can do anything about that," Sherlock breathes a line of smoke out. John sighs. He wants to tell Sherlock to stop being so god-damn proud. He wants to make Sherlock realises that his dad is more than just a prick; he's an emotionally-abusive waste-of-space prat and there probably is something the authorities could do about it. He just wants to help his best friend. But he knows how much it will upset Sherlock.
"They natter on while they change," John shrugs. "It's like being stuck in a room full of old women, sometimes."
"Hey, how's your hand? Feeling any better yet?" John asks, noticing how Sherlock's been using his right hand a lot more.
John's mum is in the kitchen, making a cup of tea. She looks up when they enter the room, and then grins broadly.
"That was..." he begins. "Wow." He passes the cig back to Sherlock. "I've missed you, these past few months."
Sherlock doesn't even realise he's said it out loud until Vic pulls away properly and looks at him with a combination of fear and alarm. Before Sherlock can say anything else, Victor gets off the bed and starts putting his clothes back on.
"That's because you're an idiot," Sherlock states, and John's shocked at the bluntness of it. Sherlock sighs at his expression. "Don't be offended, most people are."
Sherlock stands in front of the full length mirror, running his fingers over the scars Phil's rings left that night. The worst ones are on his chest and his back, where for some reason Anderson had been intent on doing the worst damage. The scars aren't big,, but they run deep. Running his fingers over them, he can feel that they're raised and even now, they're red and angry looking. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath and pulls out his phone. It's picked up within a couple of rings.
"Me too," he agrees, taking a long drag and blowing the smoke out in rings because he knows Victor finds it impressive.
The latter, John is unwilling to accept. It's been almost three months, now, and he's positive Sherlock's not capable of...
Sure enough, he doesn't yell or scream once. They take their time - fifteen minutes by Sherlock's count. He's really fighting the urge to cry and, with a sadistic laugh, Seb delivers one final kick to his ribcage and calls him a pathetic baby before all three of them run away. Vic's the last one to go, hesitating for just a moment as if he's going to say something, try to make what he just helped do better. But it's only a moment, and then he's gone, feet pounding the pavement in a half-run, half-drunken-stagger behind his friends. And Sherlock is alone.
"You're right," Sherlock agrees, surprising John. "However I'm entirely unconcerned with whether or not he's going to cause a scene. I've told you already - the man is an almighty bastard and the less time I spend in his presence, the happier I'll be."
He doesn't even leave his room for dinner, but that doesn't matter. He has strange eating patterns anyway, often going days without anything substantial. His body has learned to cope with it - not that that matters. His mind is the only thing that matters. The rest is just transport. That's why he so often forgets to sleep until he just crashes out. John's constantly on at him about that. He's got plans to be a doctor, so he's looking after his health and does his best to look after Sherlock's too. It's usually in vain, but Sherlock appreciates the gesture.
"Of course not," she says, before skipping off ahead up their road. John smiles. For all they argue, and for all he complains, he really does love his sister.
"Not what I heard. Why don't you go to your German class and leave Mr Holmes here to his reading, eh?" he says, stepping aside and gesturing towards to door.
"They're alright, really, Phil and Seb," Vic sounds uneasy. "It's just... well they've both got a weird sense of humour, that's all. I know they take it too far with you sometimes, but it's 'cause you bite back and that's what they want. You should ignore them, babe."
"Why don't you come to mine? It's closer than yours," he says. "And you can borrow a scarf and stuff so you don't catch hypothermia or something on the way home."
Vic accepts it, lets it dangle between his lips as he finds his jeans and wriggles back into them, breathless.
flatten - for the most part the curls are stubborn and spring straight back up again.) Sherlock smirks back and wipes John's lips, wet from a combination of their saliva, with his thumb. John grimaces.
a lot of fun, John,” he says. “And anyway. You’re the one who follows me into trouble every time, so what does that say about you?”
Armed with an eight-pack of Fosters and a brave smile, he ascends the steps to the front door. In all honesty, he'd partially hoped that Sherlock would come just so he didn't have to go in alone. But it's evident the taller boy is well and truly in a sulk with him - he's not even replied to any texts since yesterday. John makes a mental note to pick up a box of Earl Grey and a packet of dark chocolate digestives to tempt Sherlock out of his mood on Monday.
suprising is that you'd bring a boy back here for sex when anybody could walk in," Mycroft's voice is as level and even as Sherlock's.
"I like you, John, you seem like a decent bloke," Phil says. "And because I like you, I'm gonna give you a bit of advice. Stay well away from Sherlock Holmes."
Mum brews up a pot of tea, even breaks out a couple of the white chocolate wafer biscuits she hides away for special occasions. Then she launches on her torrent of questions again, and John tries to answer them as fast as she's asking. Overall, a good first day. It was easier to get around than he thought, though he got a bit lost on the way to Chemistry. Teachers were, on the whole, firm but fair. The lessons were challenging, but nothing that John can't cope with.
about anything when Sherlock could be right instead. John has half a mind to wake him up and tell him what a fucking prat he is, that's it not fair to mess with people's sexuality and emotions like this, doesn't he
"Sorry. I don't usually have passengers," he says it like it should be shocking and John scowls at him.
John and Sherlock's first kiss goodbye is a sweet open-mouths-no-tongues affair. Sherlock tastes of cigarettes and bubblemint gum and John knows it should be unpleasant but it really isn't. When they pull apart, Sherlock smiles and kisses John's forehead.
"Are you really going to make me spell it out for you?" he says, and when John just blinks at him in confusion he heaves an exasperated sigh. "Jim got a little bit too excited on Saturday night."
Sherlock tries to stand after a couple of minutes. The first time his legs can't take it and he crumples to his hands and knees. He heaves a couple of laboured breaths, his ribs burning with pain each time. On his second try, with the aid of a nearby bench, he manages to get back to his feet. His legs scream in protest with every step, but he manages to stagger home and up the stairs to the bathroom. Seeing himself in the full length mirror on the back of the door is alarming and sickening. His face is streaked with rivulets of dried blood and his jeans and shirt are torn up and dirty. He can already see some bruises forming, and there are several places he's going to have scars from Phil's rings. His whole body screams with pain, and he strips down and sits in the bathtub while it fills. It's soothing, the warm water washing over him as it runs out of the tap, and he stays there for a long time before he actually starts to clean himself off. After he climbs out of the bath, he sits on the edge of the tub and has a good cry. Not because of the pain, although it's bad. But because of the thought that keeps replaying in his head, over and over...
“Can I have one?” he asked, and Harry nodded, a small smile appearing on her face. “Awesome, you’re the best –”
deeply in love. And the two had kept their vows, and had also kept the one promise they had made back before leaving District 12, seven years ago: that there would be no more secrets between them.
They danced and ate until President Snow came out to make a short speech, after which Mrs. Hudson found them and Mycroft, Cinna, and Connie Price and regrouped with them to bring them all back to the train for the ride home.
They approached the door to the backstage area – a door that was being used by bystanders trying to find the nearest exit, and found Alexander – still in his Peacekeeper uniform, the helmet completely disregarded, now – pushing his way through the crowd of people.
“Stay –” Sherlock managed to say to Archie before he sprinted after the sword – his sword – Mycroft’s sword – and put his fingers around the hilt just before it slid from his reach.
For the rest of the evening, the group sat around the table and talked as if they were all old friends with John as he ate what Alexander and Oceana had given him. For what only felt like a moment or two, the reasons why John was sitting there instead of about eight stories up in the penthouse or down at President Snow’s mansion with his family, depending on where they were at the time, were forgotten. He briefly stopped thinking about the fact that he wasn’t allowed to talk to or be near Sherlock or his sister, the fact that Dean and Alexander had lost their older siblings only days ago, his normal prejudice against Career Districts, or the meeting with President Snow that was tomorrow morning. For just a few moments, the thoughts and feelings in John’s head were almost normal – something they hadn’t been since the Quarter Quell was announced.
“I think it's obvious what I'm trying to do,” Sherlock replied quietly, and John gasped out a bark of nervous laughter. “Unless you’d rather I didn’t?” he asked, his eyes searching John’s expression for an answer.
As soon as John said this, Dean looked back at Alexander, and they both burst into laughter, immediately confusing John.
He wasn’t even sure what came into existence first, the cannons or the guns, but it seemed like one inspired the other, for they sounded like warped versions of one another – the cannon blasts long and deep and looming, and the gunshots quick and sharp and abrupt. But it made sense for them to sound alike, because they both inspired the same feeling – the same feeling that was stirring in Sherlock’s chest – either he, or someone he knew, or someone he loved, was dying, already dead, or going to die.
Hamish is funny, reckless, arrogant, and rebellious. Rosamund is more reserved, rule-following, and has a better social life. While Rosamund is book-smart, Hamish is street-smart.
The Avox grabbed his hand, making a strangled sound, not so different from the one he had made moments before, but John knew she was trying to say his name, trying to call him back to the present.
“It doesn’t have to be right now – or any time soon, really – I know we’re still recovering from everything and mourning our losses and picking up the pieces but –” Sherlock added quickly, trying to backpedal, and that was the only thing that inspired John to speak:
“Yes, I know exactly what it is, and I’d prefer it if you kept this information to yourself, or I’ll have to spread some unsavory information about you – and we
He picked up the spear and stepped on her back, and Aurora Blake screamed as Magnussen plunged her own blood-soaked spear into her body, pushing it through the space between her ribs and through the other side, into the dirt and moss beneath her, pinning her to the ground.
Speaking of Chapter 24 (Last), there's a sentence that Dean tries to start when Mycroft brings up the idea of giving up his place in the tunnel (and possibly his life) if the Battle for Panem turns into...well, a battle. Dean says: "But if you - I - Sherlock won't forgive you." Idk how obvious this was, but in case it wasn't, Dean was going to say "but if you die, I won't forgive you," but ultimately bailed on that sentence, only because he knew that his feelings wouldn't be enough for Mycroft to change his mind, but
Sherlock put down the dog tags that he had fallen asleep holding onto and pushed away the tray that contained his meager breakfast, discarded the white sheet covering him, and unstrapped his torso and ankles from the bed, suddenly grateful that Hannibal had come and undone his binds in the middle of the night. Then he pulled off his various monitoring devices, only pausing to consider whether he should take out his IV or if he should bring it with him. He settled upon bringing it with him, simply because of the pain he had felt when he had woken up, and knowing it would only increase if he took out the IV, now.
“Now, an outline of the next few days,” Dean went on. “We lost a lot of people in the Battle For Panem, including twenty-eight previous Hunger Games victors and countless others throughout the nation, so tomorrow I planned a memorial service, of sorts, to commemorate those who had lost their lives during this fight for freedom.” As soon as Dean had announced the amount of mentors who had been lost, it seemed as if everyone looked around the group, making a mental count of who was left, and Sherlock did, too.
John had the thought to argue with him, to remind him of all the things he had lived through, how he had survived a detox before, but he knew that wasn’t what Sherlock needed, at that moment. What he needed was his boyfriend, and so he was. He kneeled there with him, running his fingers through his hair, wiping the sweat from his brow, and kissing his forehead, promising that he was going to be okay.
“I thought you would hide within yourself; go to a place where I couldn’t reach you. Fearing that outcome, I didn’t know how else to tell you that your perfect world wasn’t going to last, and that things were going to change and that people were going to die, and there was nothing anyone could do to change that, so I just said –”
Whatever, then – this was fine. At least he had medical supplies, at all. One hundred bandaids? He could work with this.
When Mycroft finally unlocked and opened the door on the other side of the hallway, he gave the keys to Lavinia.
“Yes, you do, John,” she said quietly. “Because I have one, too.” And then she turned to face him, pulling down the collar of her shirt.
He should have been doing the same with his brother, but every time he looked at him he felt his stomach drop down to his feet – Sherlock was all he had left. Come summer’s end, Mycroft would be the only Holmes left.
“He was beheaded. Right in front of me,” he whispered. “I don’t know if he felt it, but I know he...he died mid-laugh. He wasn’t afraid, and he wasn’t alone. Which is, I think, the best way to die.”
And finally, for the first time, Sherlock looked out into the audience, and almost instantly felt his throat close in on itself – his vocal chords constricting – and he almost laughed. He had stage fright –
They reached the hovercraft just in time, and were surprised to see Louise sitting in one of the seats, wiping away tears. She looked up upon their arrival, and she lifted her shaking hand in a wave that never looked so sad. John and Mycroft sat beside her, John on her left, and Mycroft on her right.
“But if nobody wanted him – if he made sure that nobody wanted him – why did you two –” Sherlock asked, after a moment, after he had calmed down enough to find his voice.
And then Sherlock spoke again, his voice wet, a line a dribble oozing from his bottom lip, tears streaming down his face as he looked up at his boyfriend.
But, just by the way Harry was looking at him, he knew he had failed, and she had about a thousand questions that she hadn’t had ten seconds ago.
“I’ve found Dean is unlike most of the Career tributes,” Mycroft informed him. “Not to mention the fact that I didn’t have much a choice, either way.”
“How long has this even been going on for?” he asked, prying the nearly empty bottle from her other hand.
The rest of the day’s hearings went by smoothly – or, as smoothly as it could, considering. There was no one who had secrets as horrifying as Hannibal’s, and there was no difficult decision as to where to place each victor. Antonia admitted out loud that she wanted to kill Charles Augustus Magnussen for what he had done to her sister (which neither John, Sherlock, nor Harry could blame her for), and Augustus was as charming and charismatic as usual. Dean had spent his questioning proving again and again that he was the best person for Mycroft to place his trust (and the future of Panem) in, though he did seem a little short with Sherlock when Sherlock came up to ask his question and, sensing that he would be short with Sherlock, Sherlock chose not to ask anything about Mycroft for this reason. But after the last person (a Morphling addict from District 6) was finished being questioned and the voting ballots had been given to Dean, the first day of the hearing was over, and everyone was free to go.
Within moments, tracker jackers were everywhere, attacking Harry and the two tributes who had gotten them into this mess in the first place.
“So...” John started, trailing off, unsure of what to say, and Sherlock found himself opening his mouth, starting to speak before he could stop himself.
There were also nights where Sherlock would find himself in places that he knew of, but had never been to himself, like the remnants of an abandoned house in the woods beyond the fence, or the wall that bordered District 11, or the entrance to the mines in which his father died in. At first, Sherlock had no idea why he was going to these places – these places he had never been – but after doing a little bit of thinking he figured it out, pretty easily: he was, subconsciously, trying to find one place that didn’t remind him of his brother. But everything reminded him of Mycroft, because Mycroft had saved every single inch of Panem. There was literally no place in the world that Mycroft hadn’t touched, now, in one way or another.
“When do you think Magnussen will...” she waved her hand around, searching for the word. “...kill again?”
But, when John and Harry woke up the next morning – the morning of Harry’s last day of school, the morning of the move – Sherlock was gone.
“Do I get to play the Hungry Games?” Hamish asked, excitedly, and John and Sherlock exchanged looks of distress. “Does Rosie get to play the Hungry Games?” Hamish asked, looking at the baby girl – his sister. “I wanna play – I wanna win like you and Papa.”
“Hello, citizens of District Twelve!” he started in his most official voice. “May I present to you, John Watson, and the two victors of the Final Hunger Games, Sherlock Holmes and Harry Watson!”
The room was very nearly exactly the same as it was the last time Sherlock had been in it. His bed was still neatly made with the same blankets and sheets; the framed photos of their parents and of an eight-year-old Mycroft with a one-year-old Sherlock (photos that Sherlock used to stare at for hours on end when he was younger) still sat in the same place upon Mycroft’s neatly-organized desk; Mycroft’s Hunger Games crown was still placed in the center of the top shelf of his bookcase, with his medal of valor still hanging from a nail directly above it on the wall. The differences in Mycroft’s room were slight, yet easily noticeable to Sherlock: there was a copy of the mentor manifesto on Mycroft’s bookshelf, along with multiple small notebooks that matched the one that was found on Mycroft when he died; there were newer, bigger clothes in his closet, different from the ones that hung there the last time Sherlock had set foot in the room; a case holding a beautiful violin and bow rested on his bed, a tag tied around the scroll with the words
Sherlock Holmes finally fell asleep, listening to his brother and his boyfriend being interviewed from the Capitol.
“Well, of course there will be people – that’s the point of a banquet, after all! Attendance is non-negotiable, Sherlock Holmes, and if we don’t get going we’re all going to be late!”
“N-No – nothing – I’m – It’s okay – I’m fine,” Sherlock finally replied, but John was nowhere near swayed.
The biggest reminder were the passing Avoxes – they waved to these Avoxes as they passed, but the Avoxes immediately avoided eye contact. Another thing they changed when they realized that there were two tributes and the mentor in the stairwell was their hands – they moved them in the same way that Clover did when she spoke until they noticed they were not alone, and then dropped their hands immediately at their sides. They were signing – all of them were.
Sherlock and John dancing on top of the fish is literally the most romantic thing I’ve ever written.
The sound of Mycroft’s voice was cut off by the sound of firing bullets into the stage behind them –
“And where will John be during this?” Harry asked, still obviously unhappy about the fact that Sherlock and Mycroft could see each other between then and the next night but she and John could not.
After I post all the behind the scenes stuff and deleted scenes, I'm going to be doing a Q&A! If any of you have any questions about the fic or whatever, please leave a comment, and I'll save it for later! :D
One of the times Sherlock went to the park, the spring after the park’s opening, was for his wedding with John. As soon as the Capitol caught wind that Sherlock and John were engaged and were beginning to plan their wedding, their old prep teams came out of the woodwork, and Mrs. Hudson was there right along with them, filling Sherlock and John in on all of the Capitol’s wedding traditions and ideas for an extravagant ceremony. John had tried to tell her that it wasn’t necessary, and that they’d probably just have a traditional District 12 wedding, but Mrs. Hudson was having none of that:
He wasn’t sure why he did it – he’d try to boil it down to just being sick and tired of being in the Capitol or the fact that there was
“But it’s never like this – you can’t see the fish in a frozen pond; the ice is too thick. Do you think we’re scaring them?” he asked, looking back up at John, puzzled.
The man sighed and rolled his eyes, pulling out his money card. John watched hungrily, anxiously, as the man punched in an amount.
“If this meeting takes that long, which I don’t really see happening, but it’s better to be prepared.”
But Aurora Blake was too quick for him, putting her spear between them, and he couldn’t stop himself in time – he ran directly into her spear. He swiped his knife at her, and she ripped the spear out of him, blocking it with ease, and using it to swipe his feet out from under him.
Another rustle of leaves sounded from his right, and he spun that way, just in time to catch the leaves about thirty feet ahead of him settling, and a silhouette vanish into the brush.
“Okay,” John whispered, and with a quick kiss goodbye, he was off to take the stage – to bare his soul in the name of Mycroft Holmes.
“That’ll be simple enough to do,” Sherlock said. “We’ve been playing off each other for years – that's how being friends works, right?”
Other sectors in the Arena that were never mentioned in the story: Quicksand (every cartoon character’s ever-present NIGHTMARE), Beasts (I keep thinking Giant Stone Gargoyles for some reason idk why), a Minefield, blood-sucking Leaches that sucked you dry, super venomous angry Snakes, literal Indiana Jones/127 Hours-esque Boulders (those came from Alexander Waters' Hunger Games, if you'll remember), a sector that just spouted Fire at you out of nowhere (or maybe just caught on fire at random intervals?), a sector I labeled “Simulation” but it’s been so long since I looked back at these notes that I have no idea what I meant, and a sector I labeled “Poison” but it’s been so long since I looked back at these notes that I have no idea what I meant (maybe every food source within it contained poison?).
“You better get used to it,” he said, pursing his lips together in a smile, “You’re basically a victor now.”
And so they ran through the jungle, following the sound of John’s voice as it got louder and louder around them.
allowed to watch it – they wouldn’t shut up about you for almost a year after you won – you were a legend in District Twelve,” John explained.
After the names were read out, Dean invited members of the audience to the stage to say a few words for the deceased. It took a moment, but finally someone stood up to take the stage – a now-widowed wife. After her words, soon everyone started going to the stage – parents, friends, spouses, children – even a little boy took the stage to tell his “grandpapa” that he loved him one last time. Even Harry and John left Sherlock with Louise and took to the stage to speak of their parents, who hadn’t died at the Capitol but were still killed as a result of the rebellion.
“Right. Of course,” Sherlock said quietly, more focused on how to breathe than he should’ve been. Of course John would care about that; he had been close to Mycroft, too – Mycroft had been John’s mentor. Mycroft had been John’s friend, too, in the end.
“He told me that he’d call sabotage if I touched him – since he was a tribute and I was a mentor from different Districts – but all the while he kept walking towards me – and I felt the wall touch my back –”
There are only a few more chapters left! I'm so weirded out by this I'm probably gonna cry at some point about it.
“Well, no one’s allowed near the coast, so maybe there’s something there. And if not...we’ll find something that can go on the water and see what’s out there.”
“Nothing I can think of. We’re stopping at District Eleven tomorrow; you’ll be meeting the families of –”
“You think you and your brother could just destroy the Hunger Games? Just like that?” Seneca hissed in his ear. “Absolutely not – not even close –”
And with that, Sherlock left her and approached the nearest horse trainer – one who was just a year away from retirement, sick of doing this year after year – the perfect person to try and coax a favor out of.
Which put them here, about to re-enter the party with a sense of accomplishment: Sherlock Holmes had come back from the dead, and
As soon as Alexander got John’s hands free, John brought his hands to his front and rubbed at his wrists, and then, as if they were waiting for that moment, his prep team seemed to appear out of nowhere, and started making his face stage-presentable, adding makeup and fixing his hair. Mrs. Hudson kept talking the whole time as if nothing was happening.
started showing, more than just a bump that could be hidden with the right kind of dress – every time he saw me his eyes would kind of bulge out of his head, for just a second. It was like he couldn’t believe there was a human being growing inside of me – he had no idea what to make of it.”
John then felt a gentle hand on his shoulder, and he nearly jumped out of his skin, fearing that it was Charles Augustus Magnussen, come to try to corner him again. Once he spun around and found that it was one of the other tributes – a blonde girl in her twenties, the other tribute from District 1 – he relaxed a fraction.
John watched the screen as this happened – Will snuck after Hannibal and watched him rip a twelve-year-old girl named Abigail Hobbs apart with his teeth and eat her alive. Will was horrified, and definitely vomited a few times off-camera, but by the time Hannibal made it back to the Careers’ camp, Will was back to normal, or as normal as Will could have been, considering. He informed Hannibal that he seemed to lose a few hours, and Hannibal informed him that he had just returned from killing a tribute, and Hannibal had just helped him clean up. Just as before, Will panicked, but this time John knew that he was faking.
And as he shot up, Sherlock came to the conclusion that this was not normal, not like he thought it was. Sherlock had always been infatuated with John, ever since the day that they met, but it had never been like this – he had never once thought about John’s body – about
Dean has some news for Sherlock; Sherlock reveals something to John, Harry, and Dean; Sherlock has a meeting with someone he never wanted to see again.
“Please, sit down; dinner’s almost ready,” he said, gesturing to Sherlock’s place at the table, and Sherlock obliged, part of him wishing he had taken another hit of morphling before the train stopped at District 12. “How was the Capitol?” Hannibal asked as Sherlock watched him cook, and Sherlock shrugged.
“Okay,” Sherlock said, slowly, and was surprised to realize he wasn’t entirely sure of where the conversation was going.
And now, as John stood in the place that Sherlock stood thirteen days ago, John realized that they both had thought about the same thing in that place, even though Sherlock hadn’t known it at the time.
At one point, he glanced over at John, and saw his mouth moving. He concentrated for a moment, and was soon able to hear the words coming from his mouth, but only faintly, as if he was talking underwater:
Since it was dark, Sherlock heard them first – the soft flutter of wings, the utterances of their speech – but soon they landed by his feet and hopped along aside him, pecking at his feet as he walked.
After the interview, Sherlock and John and the team were whisked away to President Snow’s mansion for the Capitol’s Victory Tour banquet and party.
“Probably not as much as you and Mycroft were – are. That Jim Moriarty, man...” Alexander trailed off, puffing out his cheeks and exhaling.
“Of course not. She’s upset by his death, yes, but she saw you avenge him, she knows about how you took care of him, and she knows that he didn’t die alone and in fear. Frankly, I think she likes you more than she had going into this year’s Hunger Games,” he said, and Sherlock nodded.
Mycroft had invited almost every living Hunger Games Victor to join in the fight, and most of them found their way to the Capitol the night of the battle. The only people who he hadn’t invited were most of the mentors from Districts 1 and 2 – the few mentors Mycroft didn’t trust. But somehow, probably because of the Quarter Quell and the history-making news that there were two Hunger Games victors this year, some of the past mentors from the Career Districts made their way to the Capitol, only to die just hours later. The only person who was in on the whole thing but wasn’t allowed to stay and fight was Nana; Mycroft had ordered that she be returned to District 7 before the night of the final interview. Louise had told them that the victors in their fifties and sixties persuaded Mycroft to let them stay and fight, but Nana was too old, too frail, and had too many disabilities to fight against young, strong, and heavily armed Peacekeepers. Nana was supposed to leave the day of the Finale – John knew that now, thinking back to the last time he saw her, with Alexander Waters at the party in the City Circle.
Despite himself, John half-smiled up at the screen, watching an upside down Sherlock trying to shimmy his foot out of his boot.
“No you’re not –” Sherlock cut him off, anger flaring up inside him. “You’re not sorry about me or Harry or Archie Neal –”
But at that point, Sherlock had stopped listening, instead taking a moment to consider Dean’s question. He imagined everyone in Panem, people he never met and never would meet, people who didn’t know him
The sudden grip of a firm hand around John’s neck almost startled him, fingers digging deep into the skin and as the other man spoke, his voice was much closer now.
But there was something worrying in the eyes peering over the titanium rim of his  glasses, a glint of something on edge and for a second Mycroft wondered if he had perhaps been too late with his plan to shackle Magnussen, maybe the man had already managed to find something to use against him and his colleagues and last night had simply been a waste of his time, a fruitless game that had held no consequences for the actions to come.
“It’s tempting.....” he said and heard Sherlock emit what almost sounded like a groan of despair, like a child realising that a hand stuck in a jar would not so easily be dislodged.
John watched her disappear and then stared down the darkened shadow that made up the head of the stairs, the distinct feeling of stepping into villain’s lair crossing his mind for a second, almost expecting to see a bald man in a grey suit sitting in a swivelling chair with a white cat on his lap .
John couldn’t help but let his eyes widen at these words. Both because he was surprised to find out that Mycroft was related to the young man, they certainly looked nothing alike, but also because a wave of sheer relief washed over him with the information that the person he had last seen being carried away on a stretcher had after all survived his ordeal.
Despite knowing this for the deception that it was, John couldn’t help but shiver at the idea of Sherlock lying lifeless in a bed somewhere, with the threat of never waking up again. He knew it was all a ruse, he had heard it from Sherlock’s own mouth last night, and yet it made him uncomfortable hearing it like this, spoken so bluntly by Magnussen. It had felt quite differently hearing his co-workers talk about it earlier today. Back then it had still felt like a game.
He had already caught a glimpse of repentance in Sherlock’s eyes back at the hospital, he knew Sherlock felt regret over many things even if he hadn’t said a word about it. And that was the core of the matter really. John knew a conversation was not the way to go about the issue. Not this time.
And while those words actually caused John some discomfort because it reminded him of how far along he had gone in the ruse to fool Mycroft, he promised to not overdo it in the future.
“Oh, Sherlock....” John took the younger man in his arms and held him tightly, inhaling his warmth, his unique scent, his fingers cradling through those glossy soft curls, “I don’t know what to say.....”
He paused and stared John down with an intensive gaze, drilling into his very core to see how John would react.
But soon enough that crush turned more serious and eventually formed into full-blown sexual desire combined with genuine love and affection for Sherlock and John realised that if he thought that he had already reached the bottom of the rabbit hole earlier, he was in fact still falling and had no idea how the force of impact would affect him when finally hitting the ground. There was always the risk that it would all end in a big painful crash for him, the further down he went. And yet, he never hesitated.
It didn’t seem likely, but still, Sherlock wouldn’t have minded getting a closer look. If he hadn’t cut Mycroft off from the case, he could have asked him about it, he probably knew if other pairs like it existed, but as the situation was, he was on his own in this.
Whatever the reason, he is sure it will be matter of no importance and consequence to him and he actually whistles a small tune as he grabs his umbrella from the stand, twirling it in his hand for good measure before he heads out the door to meet with John Watson.
Magnussen always enjoyed sniffing out weaknesses in others and exploit whatever he had on them in a show of power, and Mycroft Holmes in particular had always been a particularly tempting opposition to take down, with his starchy persona and reputation for being veritably impenetrable.
“I’ve told you what I wanted to say, what you choose to do with it is up to you.  I just wanted you to know that there is a strong possibility that your brother is slowly going to kill himself with those drugs if he doesn’t get proper help and by my estimation, looking at his face while he was seated next to his fiancé, hearing Victor talk the way he did about them, I would say that their marriage is going to end in misery if they go through with it, and drugs might be the only consolation your brother has to cope with that disaster.”
The headache, his drowsy state and the feeling that he had been thoroughly played in every way possible by the man in front of him caused a spike of anger to pierce through him. He didn’t like the feeling of having been kept in the dark despite offering his help with Magnussen, it was as if he had been a helpless bystander without a bloody clue about anything.
“It’s a reward he isn’t aware that he has accepted. He is one of those people with enough principles to never accept a compensation openly for something he didn’t see as anything beyond performing his duty. He thinks I offered him a deal when in reality I could have picked any doctor of my own choosing to look out for you. It was the only way to repay him somehow. He will get a promotion for his troubles if he sticks it out with you, so try keeping that in mind before you unleash your most hair-brained shenanigans upon him. He is after all the reason you’re still breathing right now.”
Experience dealing with Mycroft over the years had taught him as much and even if this repugnant man was nothing like his brother otherwise, the matter of remaining in comand of things, still put them in the same category of emotionally stumped men with far too much power and need of omnipotent control.
John downs the remains of the whiskey in one go and then casts a final glance at the picture of Mycroft frozen in place on the screen, hovering above Sherlock’s still seated form.
“I realise that this evening has been one shock after another for you. It hasn’t been particularly pleasant for me either. But our main focus right now is to locate my brother and do as much damage control as we possible can. Whatever you choose to do afterwards is your own business, I’m not getting involved in any of it. But right now, all I want is for us to find him before he does anything even more idiotic. If that’s even possible anymore. “
There wasn’t any ridicule in what he said, it wasn’t even a real question because they both knew the answer.
Mycroft knew that Sherlock intentions weren’t as bad as they appeared, he cared very much for his doctor companion and would mourn the loss of him if it came to that.
Magnussen remained by the door for a moment to take in the view presented to him. Then a predatory smile broke out upon his lips and his tongue slowly emerged to wet his upper lip in an obvious display of appreciation before he stepped inside the room and softly closed the door behind him.
John had grabbed a firm hold of the wandering arm and twisted it against the other man’s back, pressing a little more forcefully than strictly necessary just for the pleasure of hearing a gasp of pain. Then he deftly turned the struggling body so he could face it before he pressed his mouth to an ear, his turn to do some whispering, his voice decidedly more hostile.
Sherlock took a long drag from his cigarette, as if vying for time, but then launched himself into it without hesitation or pause.
Considering her boyfriend’s strange behaviour of calling the whole thing off the very next day, it sounded like something Sherlock would probably do once establishing that he had gotten what he was after.
Inwardly John wondered where Mycroft kept his assistant stashed away to be so readily whipped out whenever he needed her, but instead he asked a different, more significant question.
John nods to himself, but not letting his eyes move away from Mycroft’s pacing form. It does indeed sound suspicious but still very vague. There has to be more to it, otherwise Mycroft would not be so worked up about it.
Because if Mycroft was the person Sherlock had to rely on regarding advice on life, no wonder his views on how to behave when it became to human relationships was so skewed.
“What did you mean when you said that I would not be able to figure out what happened to you yesterday? You said it wasn’t caused by a wasp. If not, then what promted your reaction?”
"Pretty big misunderstanding that ends with you trying to get someone blatantly not interested into your bed," Phil scoffs. "Fucking pervert."
"Ex-boyfriend," Sherlock says, because it doesn't matter if Jim knows this crap. "And two of his mates."
"I'm only taking an interest in you," Mycroft raises an eyebrow without looking away from his newspaper.
"Ooh, hey up, lads," Brad - a blond boy who John's never really been keen on - piped up. "He hesitated there. Who would've thought it, eh? Captain Johnny, got himself a little crush on Sherlock Holmes, of all people."
want friends. He's just grown up believing that nobody likes him anyway, so what's the point in trying?
"I would've assumed you'd have heard by now," Sherlock's voice is flat, emotionless, gives nothing away.
"Victor," Sherlock states. There's a line of tension in his jaw and John's alarmed to see that he looks
"Are you okay?" she asks, and Sherlock just shrugs. The side of his face aches and his jaw and teeth feel weird, but he's not about to tell her that. He doesn't want to upset her. She so hates when he and Dad fight. Sherlock would avoid it if he had any other way of defending himself. Her footsteps clack across the room and she stops behind him, putting her hands on his shoulders. "Oh, Sherlock."
Her skirt is rucked up even shorter than it usually is, her blouse buttoned (or, rather, unbuttoned) to show even more cleavage. She's wearing sparkly lip gloss, which has several stray hairs caught in it, and her nails have been recently done. She's put on a few inches around the waist in the past week. Comfort eating, no doubt. On top of all that, she's leaning over the table in what Sherlock supposes is intended to be a sexy way as she's talking to Philip Anderson, the damn idiot. He's positively
"Yes, I think we've established that," Sherlock says. "Really, John, don't speak if you're going to be boring."
"Oh no, Mr L, not at all. I was just um... asking Sherlock for some help with my homework, that's all," she says. Lestrade cocks an eyebrow in disbelief.
"You shouldn't smoke so much, you know. It's not healthy," John says. "What's Mycroft done this time?"
"Hello love," John's mum practically pounces on him the second he walks through the door. "How was your first day? Did you find your way around okay? Were the lessons very hard? Were your teachers nice? What about the other pupils?"
It’s a quiet ride back to Sherlock’s place, but not at all awkward. It’s that sort of comfortable silence that can only occur between close family members or closer friends. Their hands are still clasped loosely on the middle seat in between them. When they get there, Sherlock pays for the cab – something he never does – and they go up the steps and into the house together. John’s always liked Sherlock’s house, though it’s nothing particularly spectacular; a five-bed two-bath detached in a leafy suburb with gardens in the back and the front. It’s beautifully ordinary, but compared to John’s three-bedroom one-bathroom end terrace in the city centre, it’s practically a mansion.
"Oh!" Everything finally clicks into place in John's brain, and he feels himself blushing deeply. He clears his throat. "I thought you said you didn't have a boyfriend?"
"Cheers, mate, you're a star," John beams as he catches up with him, and Sherlock starts again. Almost as if he didn't realise the little blond was still at his side. He clears his throat, and John can't tell that he's embarrassed about having been shocked or flustered by the sudden compliment.
those cheekbones. They're like a work of art, could've been carved from marble. He's got pretty eyes too, ice blue, with tiny flecks of green and brown here and there. They're fixed on John's lips now, and his own are subconciously pouting. John stares as long as he can take it, and then he dips down and lets their lips touch.
"Are you going to Mike Stamford's party tomorrow night?" he breaks the hour-long silence in which John has been doing his History essay, and Sherlock has been reading the obituaries for murders to get excited about.
"Sounds like a plan," Sherlock grins, following John out of the shower and along to his bedroom. They both dry off and redress - or, rather, they blast each other in the face with the hairdryer a few times and laugh and kiss and wrestle in their underwear for ten minutes.
"Mad?" John repeats, spluttering. "Sherlock, I've just let you into my house and made you a cup of tea at midnight because you randomly arrived outside my house and asked to be let in. D'you think I'd do that if I was mad at you?"
"Possibly," Sherlock shrugs, like it's no big deal. The cool demeanour is back, but John saw the flash in his eyes.
Sherlock doesn't say anything in response - he's in no mood for exchanging pleasantries. Instead he fumbles roughly with the fastening of Vic's trousers. Victor has clearly had the same idea - he's clawing at Sherlock's chest with such vigour that he quite literally tears some of his shirt buttons away.
"Don't be sorry," John says, his hand lingering on Sherlock's arm, perhaps for too long. "It's alright."
"You've just had your tongue down my throat and I'm a minger for touching your spit?" Sherlock raises one eyebrow, and John shoves him playfully.
sorry," he whispers. "Sherlock... mate...babe... look at me." Sherlock hesitates, but obliges, and John pushes curls off of the tall boys forehead. "I'm going too fast, aren't I? Look. I'm not put off by being your first. If anything, it's more endearing. We'll take it slow, yeah? At
"You'll want to keep it immobilised as much as possible," John advises. "Don't move your fingers if you can help it. Your wrist, either. And keep it as dry as possible as well. I'd recommend bathing rather than showering for a bit, so you can keep it out of the water. If it does get wet just give me a ring or come round and I can change the dressing for you. It should be okay to take off in a week or so, but even after that you'll have to rest it for a little while. What?" he notices Sherlock is staring at him with a strange expression written all over his face. John expects something sassy or snippy, but Sherlock smiles at him.
It was hardly a surprise - they've had the longest losing streak in the area for nearly three years now - but the lads still grumbled about it in the showers and change room. Still, they all managed to clap the new boy on the back and congratulate him. As captain, John felt it was his duty to do so more than others, and approached Phil with a forced smile on his face.
gay. He's into girls. He's known for being something of a smooth bastard on the rugby team, and he always manages to pull when he tries. He's snogged most of the girls in their year and slept with a lot of them too. Cuddling with Sherlock is nothing.
"Oh, miserable, sweetheart. Rained the whole time we were there. Didn't it, Richard?" she turns to the doorway, where Sherlock's father stands. He ignores her question. Instead he regards Sherlock coldly.
"Was your dad really angry?" John asks. He knows this is a sensetive and uncomfortable topic, and not one Sherlock can usually talk about without breaking down. But this time he just shrugs one shoulder.
"It was all a misunderstanding," he finally wrenches his eyes away from Vic and looks back at Phil. "I misread some signals, is all."
"That's not what I meant and you know it isn't," he says. "I meant that little to-and-fro with Mr. Tall-Dark-And-Handsome there."
"For heaven's sake, Sherlock," that makes Mycroft put the paper down. "You'll get into trouble if you keep this up. I'm paying good money for you to go that school, the least you can do is turn up to your lessons."
"You do?" John says, feeling slightly put out. It's not often Sherlock has plans that aren't with him. "What plans? Who with?"
He's not certain how comfortable he is calling Jim his boyfriend, but as far as he's aware the two of them are exclusive to the point where Jim has turned down several other propositions, telling people that he's 'spoken for'. Nothing changed much between them, except now when Sherlock's a little short of cash or when they've done maybe a little too much of something together or heck, when they feel like it, they find themselves between Jim's bedsheets. And now, when Sherlock spends the night, it's not on the living room floor or the kitchen table with the other strung-out junkies. It's wherever Jim is, an arm holding him sometimes uncomfortably close to the Irishman's body.
"You played well today, Watson," Phil tells him. "I'm glad you joined the team. You're a real asset to us."
John is waved to sit down in the front room, where Sherlock is dialling the number for their favourite Chinese place. They order from there too much, Sherlock realises, as the woman on the other end of the line reels their usual order off to him immediately after he gives the delivery address. He chuckles, thinking they should probably eat more healthily. Or at least widen their range of takeout places.
"I don't smoke. Thanks for offering, though," John smiles at him.  Victor smiles back, blows smoke out in rings. John laughs. Without even thinking about who he's talking to he comments "Sherlock's really good at those."
"Or you all need to stop pushing me to lose it," Sherlock retorts, with a casual shrug. Mycroft's jaw sets and that's how Sherlock know's he's right, knows he's won. It's a rare victory, and he doesn't have long to enjoy it because it starts to rain and they both rush in through the door. Sherlock shakes his curls to get rid of the water droplets and Mycroft shrugs off his coat, hanging it on the coat rack. Their father is waiting for them in the hallway. He regards Sherlock coldly.
"Please?" John kisses the corner of Sherlock's mouth. Then along his jaw. Then down his neck. Each kiss is accompanied with a 'please'. When he reaches the spot where Sherlock's neck and shoulder join, the taller leans his head back against the tiles of the shower wall, closing his eyes and sighing blissfully.
"You've been staring at me for fifteen minutes and you haven't said a word," Sherlock pipes up, not even looking up from his notes. "Clearly something is bothering you. What is it?"
"I'm going to miss this when school starts up again," Vic says, with a sad sigh. Sherlock swallows, passes the fag back over.
to look like he's doing some work, to avoid getting in trouble with the teacher. He also notices the way Sherlock's right hand is clenched into a fist, shaking slightly with the obvious effort of keeping it that way. "Sherlock. What happened to your hand?"
"Not even if I do this?" John says, leaning up and pressing his lips against Sherlock's. Sherlock chuckles and winds his arms properly around the smaller boy, deepening the kiss. Before John can properly get into it, Sherlock pulls away.
"We're going to make sure it doesn't," Phil says, and Sherlock admits he has a surge of fear when Phil's hands ball into fists. He wears two pretty sizeable rings on each hand, and Sherlock's heard about the damage he so enjoys inflicting with them. He can fight if he needs to, but this is three on one and he doubts anybody would fancy those odds. He takes a step back.
to be a pompous twat, a mindless government drone and quite frankly a diabolical dresser, I'll let you know," Sherlock shoots back. "Until then I'm quite happy
He barely remembers getting to bed - just vague recollections of stumbling up the stairs and of Jim's hands and of feeling like he was gonna throw up but not actually doing it because getting out of bed was too much effort. Jim is still asleep, curled in that way he does, one arm resting across Sherlock's waist. He's a heavy sleeper, always has been, and he doesn't even stir when Sherlock gently eases out of his grip and redresses. He heads downstairs, slips out into the darkened back yard and lights up a cigarette. His phone screen tells him that he has several unread messages from John.
"I know it's okay," Sherlock leans back on the chair again. He looks so comfortable, so content, that he could be lounging an armchair at home.
John doesn't realise he's got tears in his eyes until one trickles down his cheek. He wipes it away furiously and sits up, sniffing. He looks across the room and notices that the picture of he and Sherlock is pinned directly across from it, where it can be seen straight away from the bed. That makes him smile a bit. It's not a particularly great photo; it's a little too bright so their faces are kind of washed-out and its sort of grainy but they're both grinning like loons and it's the only photograph John's seen of the curly-haired boy where he looks genuinely
Sherlock's eyes meet Victor's for a second, before Vic swivels his away. He has two options. He can tell them the truth and - if they believe him - lose Vic his best mates and likely out him to the world, but ultimately same himself from getting his head kicked in. Or he can roll with the lie, fight the pair of them as best he can and let Vic's dirty little secret stay a secret.
"Right," is all John can say, because he's somewhat overwhelmed. He's always assumed, from the way Sherlock talks, that Mycroft treats him the same way as their father. It never really occured to him that Mycroft does the things he does to
"You're going to Sally's birthday party," Sherlock points out, and John's about to argue that Sherlock didn't know about that until about two minutes ago, but he knows there's exactly zero sense in starting an argument with Sherlock; they both know who'll win in that situation. They're scraping the bottom of the ice cream carton now, and it's getting late. Sherlock stands up, stretching his back. "Come on. Let's go up to bed. I'm exhausted."
"Why? You haven't done anything," Sherlock starts to say, but he's cut off by John's lips attacking his own.
"Fuck. John, hand me your tape," he holds out his hand without looking up, and John passes the roll over, feeling mightily confused at the exchange he just witnessed.
"Well. Thanks, I appreciate it," Sherlock grins. "Mum and Dad are away this weekend and Mycroft's finally fucked off home - why don't you come and stay? Takeaway on me - consider it an apology for tonight."
John is staring at his now-exposed forearms. Sherlock looks too, and quickly pulls the sleeves down to his wrists again. It’s too late. John’s already seen. He strides over to Sherlock and rolls the sleeves up again. He strokes the pad of his thumb over the cuts, both old and fresh, and Sherlock shivers, his eyes fluttering shut.
They were sceptical of him at first - quite apparently some of the boys have been on the team for years and there's something of a clique mentality. John was something new and they were unused to that. But after they saw how well he plays, they welcomed him into their group with open arms. The only one he's unsure of is Phil Anderson, the team captain. He's a little
"Go ahead," Sherlock waves at the three empty seats across the table from him, indicating John should take his pick. He settles in the centre one.
He can hear voices in there as soon as he enters. Strange. There's never anybody here this early in the morning. He rounds a corner to see Lestrade, deep in conversation with John. They both look up.
"I think you're overreacting," Mycroft says. Sherlock's eyes narrow and his jaw clenches. With a sharp breath inwards, Sherlock turns and leaves the room.
type of bullshit. Instead, Sherlock can abandon his homework, enjoy his own company and marathon reruns of The Jeremy Kyle Show. It's his secret guilty pleasure. It's fun to deduce the results of the lie detector or the DNA test before they're revealed, and it's nice to see people who aren't him being yelled at for a change. If Mycroft knew, Sherlock would never hear the end of it.
By the time he arrives, fat, cold drops of rain are starting to descend, and he curses himself for not bringing an umbrella.
They don't even make it as far as the hallway. Sherlock presses John's back against the wall and the smaller boys hands find the buttons of Sherlock's shirt. Seconds later, a rush of air hits Sherlock's skin and he's vaguely aware that his button-down is on the ground near his feet. He finds himself tugging at the hem of John's t-shirt and grumbling when they have to break the kiss to pull it over his head.
Mum holds him for a long time, before turning to leave in silence. She's at the door when a thought strikes him.
John had cursed himself because he stared at Sherlock for too long (as he often does) and had lost his mojo, lost his 'zone'. It'd take him forever to get back there.
He doesn't really seem to be sexually inclined either way; too wrapped up in books and his own ego to even think about being attracted to anybody else. John just can't imagine him so full of lust that he'd do something so very horrific. And yet, so many people
After a brief chat, John makes his way to their usual corner of the library, where he pulls out his phone and opens his messages.
"Don't go," Sherlock pleads, kicking the sheets off and putting his hand on Victor's arm. "I'm sorry, Vic."
"Are we gonna have fun?" Sherlock smiles, trying to be seductive. Truth be told, he couldn't care less about fooling around with Jim tonight. But he keeps thinking about how John has gone to this party, where Phil and Seb are. Where Vic is.
"I believe I was promised a hot chocolate," Sherlock reminds John as they go into the kitchen. John laughs.
"I've to pick up my sister from Cedarstreet on the way..." he says, and Sherlock makes a motion with his hand like he's brushing it aside.
Sorry about not updating for a while. Been helping my friend move house and just been busy busy busy.
Like Sherlock hasn't been called it, and worse, a thousand times over. He sounded... almost disappointed that Sherlock wasn't going to come into the class with him.
"Where've you been?" Mycroft asks. It's dark but Sherlock can just about make out the mock-concerned look on his brother's face.
"Hello, darling," his mother breezes across the room, in that way that she does, and stretches to kiss him on the cheek.
