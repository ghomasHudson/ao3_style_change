They stared at each other, baffled by what the other person was saying.
“Jarvis, what’s his vitals look like?”
Looking back now, Tony knew that moment was the small spark that ignited his love for Steve. He put the tickets in the scrapbook, along with a few snapshots he took from the boardwalk and pier that day, and turned his focus back to the box, reaching in to retrieve the next memento.
Tony went to sleep that night without mentioning the dream.
When Steve woke up, he was in a hospital bed. From his bed, he could see a sunny day out the window, with a tree line he recognized as the one that surrounded the Avengers Compound. The beep of monitors rang in his ear, as an aide was restocking one of the room’s cabinets.
“Steve! Steve, can you hear me? Where are you?”
Tony sighed. Jan was right - not that Tony would ever admit it - and this would be a tiny step and a good way to maybe get a temperature on how Steve felt about him.
Tony turned around and whispered, “Come with me. Can I show you your gift now?”
Steve had realized he had feelings for Tony since the end of the prior school year. It started out as a little crush, innocent enough. He objectively had thought Tony was handsome from the first time that they met - but over their first school year together he found himself having passing thoughts about Tony.
From what he could tell, Tony felt similarly. Every once in awhile Steve would turn to watch Tony, small headlamp on his head, face buried in focus in a small pile of metal, hands playing with small tools and wires and gears. Once Tony looked up, catching Steve staring, and just gave him a soft smile. Steve felt his heart do a big flip.
want to go? It’s actually being hosted at an art museum this year.”
When he returned to the dorm, Sam immediately noticed that something was wrong. Steve explained what had happened.
Nat slowly eased herself off the couch to join Tony in the kitchen.
The first time was three months ago, at the start of the new term when Tony thought he had finally gathered up the courage to ask Steve out on a date after their winter break. He had thought a lot about how he’d ask, but as Jan had reminded him, Tony had asked dozens of people out before, so why should this be any different?
They quickly got out of the hot tub, throwing on the robes and running inside and out of the cold. Steve shut the door behind them and Tony’s hands were immediately on him, pulling off both of their wet shorts and guiding Steve back to the couch. Tony gently pushed Steve onto a blanket on the couch and mounted him again, naked this time. Steve pulled Tony back in close, kissing him and feeling Tony let out a small gasp as their cocks brushed against each other. Steve began to pepper kisses down Tony’s neck as Tony said, “fireplace on,” igniting the electric fireplace and letting the room fill with warmth.
“Alright, settle down everyone. So first, a few announcements.” Fury took a piece of paper from Steve, who as Student Body President was required to sit on stage for these assemblies. “In extracurriculars news, tickets to next month’s Spring Formal go on sale this week. See Student Council Events Coordinator Wasp for more details. The Fitness Club will be doing a charity race through the obstacle course on the 6th. The outdoor pool at the Aquatic Park is now open for the season, and the Collector’s Museum now has a new exhibit on Celestial Artifacts. I believe those of you in Odin’s Relics course are required to go but I encourage you all to check it out because, well, it’s pretty neat.” A small chuckle went over the audience as Director Furry continued.
Tony just smiled and kissed Steve back.
“STEVE!” Tony screamed in horror. He hadn’t known what Steve was planning to do, but first, he couldn’t see Steve, he didn’t get a response from Steve, and then there was an explosion. The threat of missiles now gone, Tony plummeted back to the ground and frantically began to search through the rubble.
“And that’s not all. Since we’re here in New York you let me know where you want to go and I’ll take you out anywhere, my treat.”
“Thanks, doc.” Tony sighed as Steve showed the doctor out. He knew he had the tendency to overdo it. Before the Avengers, Tony couldn’t even count the number of times Pepper or Rhodey had found him asleep at his desk in a pile of reports or in his workshop having dozed off after a design brainstorming session. But there was so much to do! So many people to help. He pouted a little as Steve returned to the room.
“Grab your coat.”
The rest of the day was uneventful, with the pair spending a few hours reading (Tony) and painting (Steve), followed by a nice lasagna dinner.
Steve froze.
“What’s wrong?” Steve called out over his shoulder.
, Steve. I thought - I thought -”
Steve - of
Tony began to zoom back to the fight, where he could now see the figures of Hawkeye and Hulkling assisting from a distance as she continued to raise her bow and fire and he made quick use of the new piles of rubble. Tony turned and could see lights going on around campus. People were waking up, and they would have assistance soon, but not just yet. He flew in closer. “Cap, Hawkeye, Hulkling, keep those agents busy, I’ll work on a way to stop this tank.”
“So what’s your plan?” Sam asked.
“Oh, I know. Figure it’s a good balance to let those two have some fun and make sure the Guardians don’t have
It was clear Tony was still upset. “I’m sorry I scared you out in the woods,” Steve said. “Thank you for coming to help.”
“Oh! Sure. What’s up?” Tony asked as he sat down next to Steve, who now seemed very nervous.
Tony sat up. “Wait, seriously? I mean no - no judgment it’s just you’re one of the most handsome guys at school, I’m just shocked no one has asked you out.”
Steve plopped down on the couch, amazed at his own boldness, still in disbelief. Did he hear that right? Tony felt the same about him? The Tony Stark, the genius, one of the most caring men Steve ever knew, actually had feelings for him too?
“I know it’s not the elegant bistros of Paris or the ristorantes of Florence, but -”
“Steve, I told you. You’re incredible. C’mon, let’s head home.”
“Tony, I know we butt heads sometimes and we don’t always see eye to eye. But you know I care about you so much. Both as teammates and as friends. But the truth is, I don’t actually let on
“I tried. A couple of times. Once I freaked out because you were so damn handsome swinging on those monkey bars, and a couple other times were, uh, interrupted by a certain pair of football fanatics.”
And the reflection looking back wasn’t human.
slow.” He had a giant grin on his face as Steve found his way back to Earth.
“For sure? Honestly? Battleworld. The look of pure joy when you saw me, how you ran to me and swung me around in that huge hug - no one’s ever looked at me like that before.”
“Oh, don’t give me that look. And I brought over pizza. I’m helping.” Tony kneeled down and opened a box of pizza, showing it off to the tsums. “Here, babies. Come here! It’s pizza time.”
For Tony, it meant pressure. The pressure to keep cool, not be a nervous wreck, to answer Steve’s questions and be present for their work - not daydreaming about how nice it’d be to be cuddled on the couch together as Steve stroked Tony’s hair.
Steve tried to get up and immediately crumbled back down to the ground. “It’s me - I need help, I’m down -” Steve managed to croak out in pain. He’d been hurt before - shot, jumped out of a several story building, hit plenty of times but somehow this injury was different. He felt a burn begin to course through his veins.
Back at the control box, Tony was quickly sorting through security files. “Basic monitoring system, Christ Fury why not just tape camcorders to the outer walls - security logs, software - okay. Let’s see here - alarm systems, bug reports and -” Tony stopped as he pulled up the programming for what should have been the anti-cloaking system. The files pulled up designs and specs for a massive cloaking device, all detailed in the name of AIM.
“I’m not going anywhere, Tony. I want to be right by your side, always, and I’m not going to let anything get in the way of that.”
Since Tony had gotten injured, it had been that much harder to hold a conversation with him. Steve couldn’t figure out what was wrong, and decided to push a little.
After a few days, the weird feelings subsided. Until a few weeks later.
“Would
“I own it. I told you I might have a place. Just wasn’t sure if I had sold this one or a beach house I had last year. Had to check. But looking at it now, I’m glad I kept it.”
Tony explained.
“Steve, are you there? I was right, the anti-cloaking system, it’s the opposite of that, it’s what keeping them hidden. AIM hacked this somehow. I’m gonna disable it -”
“What?”
“No. God I wish it was that simple,” Tony responded, propping himself back on his elbows. By this time, Steve had made another lap back to the quad. Tony watched Steve run off, and Loki and Jan watched Tony. Loki looked up to see who Tony had been staring at.
Tony and Steve entered the private residence elevator alone, and stood close together as the doors closed. For the first few floors, there was just silence, nether Tony or Steve able to speak or make eye contact with the other.
Tony gave Steve a reassuring smile and Steve felt his heart melt.
“Like shit. They said I have to stay overnight, bad concussion. No internal bleeding or anything like that, but they want to make sure.”
Director Fury looked over the four students and gave instructions. “Alright. To start off your patrol, the four of you should take one sweep across campus together to see how things currently are. Get a baseline. Then in pairs go around again, in opposite directions of each other. Once that is done one pair should continue to wander the perimeter of the campus, the other pair seek higher ground and engage in more advanced tactics. Decide amongst yourselves how to do that, although looking at you four I think I already know the split. Keep communicators on, don’t burn anything down, don’t
“Sir, next time, can you just let Tony build a new security system for us? He’s pretty great at it.” Tony sat up at this unexpected praise from Steve. It felt like a small boost in confidence he hadn’t felt in months.
“It’s just a date, Tony. It’s not like you’re asking Steve to marry you,” Rhodey added, reaching over to grab a handful of popcorn and throwing one piece at Tony.
“You scared us out there, man,” Sam said, sitting down by Steve’s bedside. They chatted for awhile, Sam clearly trying to distract Steve from what had happened. Steve felt better after talking to his friends already, even though he was still in a tremendous amount of pain.
“Steve, I’ve gotta say I’ve dreamt of this for a long time. After all we’ve already been through? We honestly have to make up for lost time. Don’t worry, Steve. I’m not going anywhere.”
Before they got off the ice, Tony pulled Steve to the side of the rink and kissed him. Steve’s knees almost went out from under him; kissing Tony was everything he’d thought it would be and more. It was one of the happiest moments of Steve’s entire life, and he felt like he was in heaven.
“Hey, JARVIS, write down the ingredient list for that raspberry vinaigrette dressing, that sounds good.”
think Steve would say yes to an actual date with you. But if you want a second opinion, Loki . . .?” Jan asked, looking at Loki.
“When you said ‘global emergency’ I didn’t think we’d be having an impromptu pizza party,” Tony said, putting his visor down to do a quick scan over the tsums. “Oh! They have skeeball! Want to go play a round while your buddies eat?” Tony asked over his shoulder to the tsum sitting there.
Steve looked at the mistletoe, and the perfect man underneath it, and couldn’t help but lean forward.
“Well, you dropped immediately, Loki got pissed and charged at Scott saying he killed you, and Steve came back for another lap -”
“Steve, I love you. I’ve always admired you since I was a kid, definitely had a crush on you when I was a teen - but meeting the man himself? You’re kind, and loving and compassionate and o protective of our team. You make me feel safe and you make me want to be better. You’re my best friend and I just - I can’t imagine waking up and not having you there.”
Steve and Loki mad at the same person. Must have been making quite a scene.”
“You know, speaking of Club A, would you wanna grab -”
“Last October? As in five months ago last October?”
Tony smiled. “Could I maybe . . . I don’t know, get some cuddles?” The tsums instantly jumped forward, Tony-tsum curling up against Tony’s neck while Steve-tsum laid on Tony’s stomach. Tony dozed off easily after that.
Steve took deep breaths and let Tony work. Tony took the time to lovingly scratch Steve’s ears, and then massage his scalp and then went down to Steve’s shoulders and upper back, doing this cycle over and over. Steve continued his deep breathing and started to feel that wound up energy inside him begin to uncoil. Slowly, with every pass of Tony’s touch, the tension fell away from Steve more and more.
Tony had asked Steve out so directly, so smoothly, that Steve didn’t realize this was actually a date. That he then told Tony he wished was a date.
While Steve would gladly take the couch - it was Tony’s cabin after all - Steve knew better than to try to argue with Tony by offering to sleep on the couch himself. If he tried to go to sleep on the couch he’d wake up later being carted off to the bed by some kind of robot, or Tony in the Iron Man armor himself, and while the latter had admittedly been a passing fantasy of his, Steve wasn’t about to start their week together with an argument about a bed, and certainly not one as large as the one inside this bedroom.
“Alright. I guess we’ve gone on enough sweeps for now that we can split up. Hawkeye, Hulkling, I know you two are friends. I think it’s safe to say you’d rather continue patrol together than spending the rest of night with us, right?” Steve asked.
“As your date? Tony, I’d love to.”
“What’s happening?” Tony asked.
Tony reached up, fastened the mistletoe in place and turned back to Steve. “Perfect.”
“I’m not, I’m okay,” Steve mumbled, at a loss for words.
“Oh I . . . well, I like my classes this semester. Not sure what I want to take next year though. And I told you, I’ve loved working on armor and learning so much. I might be signing up for some mission in Europe for the first half of the summer, but I’m not sure. Staying here for spring break too.” Steve trailed off with a sigh.
” and “
“Seriously, Steve. You’re making this too complicated. Just ask if you can buy him a drink and chat him up,” Sam said.
Steve then paused, the last few words hanging in between them.
“You got up to go with Loki to go talk to Steve, to get that second opinion? And from my understanding from how defensive Scott was getting: a few weeks you told him to make a robot, he and Clint made a robot that would throw footballs so they could practice going long to catch it, except Scott is better at making robots than catching footballs, and the football thrown went too fast right over Scott’s head and right into yours as you were just turning around.”
“Tsum!”
“No, no. It’s fine. Um. I mean, it hasn’t been the best semester? Classes are okay. I’ve enjoyed working on this project, I like the concept a lot. I actually haven’t been building other armors, not even because of the injury. Just no inspiration, you know? My choices for spring break are go home or stay here at this point, so I’ll probably just be spending the week at the pool in the Aquatic Park. No missions for summer yet. And no, as far as love life goes I’d describe it as a bunch of tumbleweeds rolling through a ghost town.”
“Tony -”
“Are they having some kind of party? And we’re stuck here?” Tony asked, annoyed.
It would take several minutes to get students out of their beds and into their gear and out to the main gate, so as far as Steve saw it, right now the Academy’s main defense was Tony and himself.
Steve paused and thought about it for a moment. “
“I’m sure you all will. And I haven’t seen him but I think I remember seeing a training session of his reserved for the obstacle course around now. Maybe check there?”
“Tony, you got anything?”
Jan frowned. “He literally picked you up and carried you to the hospital in his arms.”
Tony put a hand on Steve’s front to calm him. “It’s okay, it’s okay Steve. Relax. It’s okay. We should get out of here. We can walk for a bit back toward the compound if you’d like.”
The wind roared and the lightning cracked; Steve watched the rain fall outside and felt a bit restless. It had been pouring for a few days, just overall miserable conditions to be outside. He had tried to burn off energy in the gym, hoping that the exercise might make him unwind, but it just made him that much more excitable.
Tony felt himself melting. How moving it was to have Steve put his heart and soul into making this meal, and this night, just in the hope that Tony might feel the same. The thought sent a jolt through Tony’s body and propelled him forward. He gently reached over and cupped Steve’s face, meeting Steve’s lips in a sweet, tender kiss.
‘Lemon chicken risotto with peas, yeah.”
“And finally, the installation of the new security system has been finished around campus. Many outside forces have begun to recognize the strength, power, and capabilities you all possess. It’s good to put people on notice, but that can also attract . . . challenges. Our new campus security system will provide more peace of mind as you all train and build skills. Some of the features include anti-stealth technology, reinforced walls around the campus, and motion sensors. As you know, while there is no formal curfew at the Academy, I hope these new security features may inspire some of you to use more, uh,
Steve was actually surprised at how many people were coming and going through the market - and it wasn’t just tourists either. Tony would occasionally link his arm through Steve’s to make sure they didn’t get separated in the crowd.
That was all Jan could respond. Tony tried his best to avoid Steve whenever he could for the next week or so.
“Yeah, I think so.”
Tony laughed, “Listen I’m in my suit, it’s too heavy I might accidentally squish one of these tiny guys!”
Relaxation slowly took over Steve’s whole body and turned to bliss.
Steve looked down the slope of the hill and at the ice covered lake. “Is it safe?”
Steve couldn’t help it - as a dog hybrid, running around outside was one of the things he loved to do. His tail wagged with a nervous energy. It wasn’t like he wanted to go play fetch or something, but a good run around all of Central Park or all along the East River would have felt great at the moment.
Soon enough, the students went their separate ways.
“He’s a little lovesick.”
“Heat signatures, but no visuals. Too much smoke -”
“You don’t owe me anything, but I’m here for you.”
“Yeah! I was going to ask if you wanted to hang out, and then I got knocked out. And you carried me like the hero you are, and I wanted to die afterward.”
” - Tony returned to the Tower, with a robot to repair, as Steve was packing up his stuff.
They continued to stroll, eventually ending up by the skating rink.
“It’s the rain. I wish I could go for a long jog around the city, and I know I’m not going to get sick running around out there, but even I have my limits. It’s too gross out,” Steve replied.
“Incredible,” Bucky noted.
The visor snapped up. “We need to get them all out of this ball pit. But some of them are pretty far back. . .”
But the “Steve conversation” was one that they had all the time. Tony, who in the past had zero issue flirting with girls - some might say even a reputation for being suave - couldn’t seem to get it together to ask out Steve.
"You sound so confident. How could I ever doubt it?" Scott responded drily. "Besides, it's not true. You're not dumb. You pretend to be dumb. That's why you frustrated me so much on the team. You have this," he gestured vaguely, "this persona. If you really were just a dumb berserker, that would be one thing, but you're pretty goddamn smart, and that made you dangerous. To me, anyway. It changed the game too much. I'd gotten kind of used to being a big fish in a small pond. You stay where you've always been, and it's comfortable. People know you, they respect you just because you're there. Just for staying. Once I noticed all that, I guess that's when I started thinking maybe I needed to stop staying. I started realizing maybe I needed to be someplace where I had to be good enough, not just be there."
Clint was immediately on his feet. "Sir?"
Clint's eyes drifted closed at the contact, his fingers digging into Phil's hips as if hanging on for dear life. It felt strange, being on his knees there in front of his handler, doing things he'd never really imagined doing. It sure as hell changed the context of all the times Phil had looked at him with razor sharp eyes and barked an order. Clint felt goosebumps rise on his skin at the thought. Clint's tongue wandered to the end of Phil's cock, cleaning the precum from it before he slowly started to take the shaft into his mouth. Phil was bigger than pretty much anyone Clint had ever been with, but the archer was definitely anxious to meet the challenge, his tongue sliding along the underside of the throbbing flesh as he focused on keeping his jaw relaxed.
"Where are you? Do you need back up?"
Clint shuddered as he felt Victor's hot breath against his neck, his fingers digging into the hard, rough floor of the cell. He tried to keep his expression neutral as he watched Phil, but he could barely hear anything over the blood rushing in his ears. He remembered feeling Loki pressed against him in a similar way, the god looming behind him as he gave himself freely... Something warm and wet against his wounds jolted Clint out of the memory only to draw a shudder of revulsion from him as he realized Victor was licking the blood from his back. Clint couldn't hide the panic he felt, not anymore. "Please... don't..." he rasped, squirming helplessly under the hulking mutant.
Bruce glanced up and smiled faintly. Fitz-Simmons were actually really good. He also knew Stark cared nothing for grades and degrees and everything about results. "I'll just have a mocha. Just however they normally make it is fine." He made sure Tony wasn't looking before he mouthed, "No Irish," on the off chance that Simmons thought it'd be a good idea to actually do what Tony said.
"I've found cognitive re-calibration to be rather effective." Natasha smiled at the uncertain look the woman gave her. "We hit him hard. In the head."
Clint scanned the area around them, looking for any detail, any clue as to where they were. In the distance, he caught sight of the faintest hint of an electrical pole. "That way." He swayed slightly, trying to get a feel for how far away it was. "It'll be a good twenty miles. I don't know if it's a highway or a town, but it's civilization. Sort of. Unless it actually is El Paso."
Feeling Tony sinking inside him was, simply put, perfect. Steve's eyes fluttered closed, his lashes dark against his cheeks. He let the loss of his sight focus the sensation in until all he felt was Tony. He could smell the man's cologne and a hint of sweat, he felt the small centers of pressure as Tony's fingers dug into his hips, and Steve relaxed into the couch to just let himself enjoy it. He'd been eager to have it, and Steve didn't want to miss cataloging a single sensation in his mental library. "Gonna paint you like this later," Steve murmured, "the way you look... just for me."
They first stopped at a small empanada stand, and then at a chocolatier to get fresh hot cocoa. They wandered around the market, chatting and looking at candles and wall art and homemade scarves. Then they made it over to the carnival games - which Tony was surprisingly good at - and then continued to peruse the booths.
of all people? Sure for a few days. But you’d been lethargic for weeks. And yes, I noticed. I monitored. I didn’t want to cause a fuss if nothing was really wrong, so I just watched at first.
Tony was waiting, already in the tub and staring off into the distance as Steve placed his robe and towel down and quickly climbed in.
“Wow,” Tony said, looking flustered.
The evening of the gala, Tony still had a knot in his stomach. Happy pulled the car up to the front of the museum, transformed with a large red carpet. Tony took a breath, and looked at Steve, who provided a reassuring smile. They stepped out of the car to a wave of camera flashes.
“Do you need help with something?” Tony asked, looking around.
Steve thought about it, taking a look around the market. “Wow, you know, this
“Ohh, last thing,” Tony said, and hopped over to a box to pull out the last decoration. Green branches and small red berries. “Mistletoe! And it should go right in the center of this doorway.”
“Except maybe I’m going to the kitchen to make us some pancakes?”
“Oh, nothing much. Director Fury is putting in a new security system for the school.”
“Honestly, guys I don’t think I’m gonna tell him.”
, Steve thought to himself. “I guess I’ll think about it.”
Answer me, honestly. Why are you so scared of asking him out?”
. One football-wielding robot tries to take you out and want to hide? You’re supposed to be a big brave superhero -”
So they had waited. Quiet dinners in private rooms, discreet outings, dinner and dancing alone in the Tower. Their time together was sweet and intimate, but Tony also wanted to test the waters. He knew that someday, their relationship would come out one way or another. But how did Steve feel about it?
Tony chuckled lightly behind him. “Someone’s enjoying themselves.”
The thoughts raced around Steve’s head -
“Got the exact same talk from Sam. Many times. Bucky too. They deserve medals for having to put up with me.”
But Steve pushed forward, running into the smoke.
“Wait! I almost forgot.” Steve got up and grabbed a cheese grater and one of the parmesan blocks Tony had ordered, and quickly grated the cheese over their dishes.
“Would you have any recommendations if a guy wanted to get away from the harsh city winter?”
Sam stared at Steve at a loss. “Oh yeah, I’m seeing it alright.”
But Steve couldn’t bring himself to close the gap between them either, so when Tony pulled away, Steve was disappointed.
Steve began to explore Tony’s mouth as Tony began to slowly roll his hips, where he could already tell Steve was half hard.
“OH MY GOD NAT, BRADLEY DROPPED HIS CHEESECAKE,” Steve screamed from the living room.
Tony put his visor down and began to scan the ball pit. “Okay, alien life. Small, there’s a few dozen here, they’re actually just resting above the actual ball pit. No detections of venom or poisons.” Tony reached forward and put a hand out to the ball pit. One of the creatures that looked like his armor crawled over and into his hand.
Steve sighed. “You want me to go into the ball pit, don’t you?”
He felt himself begin to swell, his perspective shifted, first growing higher, the rip of his clothing sounding out as he began to growl - not scream,
“Yeah, sometimes it seemed like when we were all just hanging around you’d just clam up around me. I know we’re all friends but I just assumed you wanted me at a small distance.”
“Well, what about you?”
After lunch, they went on a hike through the woods on Steve’s suggestion. Light snow blanketed the woods, and the men exchanged knowledge about the trees and animals they saw through their walk. On the last part of their hike, they had to walk over an icy trail, so Steve took Tony by the hand and they slowly crossed the ice together, feeling Tony gently squeeze even through their winter gloves. At one point, Tony began to slip, but was immediately caught by Steve and never hit the ground.
Rhodey turned on the game console in Tony’s room as Jan passed the popcorn bowl to Tony, who sighed.
“Tony, we need a blast chiller for the kitchen,” Nat said, as she finished the chips.
Before he knew it, Tony had spent the rest of the day on the couch with the others, getting just as hyped up about frying techniques as Steve was.
“Can you stand?” Tony asked, and helped Steve up after he nodded in the affirmative. Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist as Steve put his arm over Tony’s should for support. They quietly walked out of sight, turning a corner when Tony stopped, picked up Steve bridal style.
Tony looked incredibly concerned.
He wanted to talk to Tony but he didn’t think Tony wanted to talk to him. Was Tony scared of something happening to him? Was Tony scared
“I feel like I owe you an explanation.”
“Oh look, it’s snowing!”
And almost as Steve had read his mind, he looked over at Tony and said, “I know you want to keep working, and helping people. But if you keep burning yourself out like this you’re going to keep getting sick like this, or worse. It’s okay to take a break now and then.”
Tony reached out and grabbed Steve’s hand. “Steve, no, shit, I
“Well I’m sure he’ll be running back around to do twenty more laps before you can finish your iced coffee, so you can get another look.”
Steve moved to the back and crawled underneath the tank, pulling his shield with him. He examined the underside of the tank as best he could.
Steve woke up the next morning with Tony’s back against his.
“Oh, wherever you think. You’re an artist. I trust your aesthetic judgment.”
“Gotta get them out of here and back to the Tower. But how are -” Tony got cut off by the little red tsum jumping out of his hand and bouncing over to the restaurant area. It hopped up the chairs and to the table, where it immediately started to gobble up pizza.
“Hey, I don’t mind,” Bucky was quick to reassure him. “You’re a good leader. Always have been.” His features darkened, and another bout of melancholy settled over him like a storm cloud. “Only wish I could’ve been around to help you.” Bucky had learned all about the Battle of New York while he’d been recovering. It was staggering to think of what had happened, and that his best friend had been front and center during the entire fight. “Maybe if I ever get my head sorted out I could join you again?” he offered hopefully. “Y’know, be like old times?”
Clint raised an eyebrow. "Since when did you make something and not want to try it? Especially if it's likely to backfire and kill you."
It was the better part of an hour before a doctor appeared again. The man looked haggard but less fearful than before. "Captain Rogers is in stable condition. We still have him on oxygen since he's having some difficulties breathing, but his heart rate is normal. We hope he'll be waking up sometime in the next few hours." The man hesitated, looking the group over. "I don't think too many visitors would be a good idea."
"Valid point. Very valid." Panting, Darien gave up on the idea of pride. He wanted to get off, and he wanted it as soon as possible. "Right here works, then. You just tell me how you want it. I guess at this point it's dumb to pretend anything is off the menu."
Logan knew it would be more suspicious to argue against that request than to quietly allow it. He glanced warily at Scott. If they were thrown off the team, it was no big deal. But Logan had a feeling that a simple ousting wasn't exactly SHIELD's style.
The shaky rasp in Phil's voice was enough to drive a deep moan from Clint. He'd taken as much of Phil's cock as he could into his mouth, and he was bobbing his head slowly. He wouldn't be able to move fast for what was next, though. His handler's cock was far too big to shove it down his throat and let the man fuck his mouth like he wanted to. As Clint slid forward on Phil's cock once more, he let the shaft slide into his throat a bit, focusing to relax as the thick shaft pushed him past his usual limits. It felt good, though, and Clint's fingers dug into Phil's thighs as the archer's eyes rolled back and fluttered shut, another low moan rumbling up from his chest.
Tony knew how to take an order when it really mattered. Steve's head fell back against the wall, and he let himself enjoy the simple pleasure of the act. Tony had the softest lips he'd ever kissed, and they felt just as good below the belt as above. He gently carded his fingers through the man's curly hair, inadvertently ruining all of Tony's efforts to look presentable. Their press was done, and Steve didn't care anymore whether either of them looked presentable.
Clint gladly took control, though it was to slow Phil down a little. He was already insanely close to cumming after having sucked the other man off and having seen Phil take him down like he was starving. Not wanting it to be over too soon - though realistically he knew it would be - he bit his lower lip and hoped Phil would accept the slower pace as his hand dropped back to his handler's shoulder. As it was, Clint was practically writhing with every move Phil made, his toes curling in his boots as he fought for control. "Not... Not gonna la... last long..." he managed.
Logan raised an eyebrow. "He's got you there, slim," he said, then caught himself. He was already viewing Steve as Scott in some weird sense or another. //That's a little unfair. He's not nearly as much of a tool.// "Don't really have a place to stay. Usually just find a place where I can work off a night's rent. But if you two have a couch I could sleep on somewhere, I'll admit I could use a break from washin' dishes."
Bruce smirked and shook his head at the idea of anyone really trying to contain Tony. The man had even managed to give Coulson the slip once, and Bruce had a feeling that was a task not easily accomplished. "Well, maybe you could at least hold him down for a little while if he gets overtaxed," he decided, leaning back in his seat a little. The further they got from the Fridge, the more comfortable he felt. Hopefully, Loki had left once the source of his interest was gone, hadn't harassed any guards or prisoners.
Taking the words to heart, Clint shifted his weight to one elbow, leaving his other hand free so that he could slide two fingers into her. He licked at her around his digits before his tongue slowly worked back up to her clit. He teased the nub slowly for a few moments before his lips closed over it, and he began to suckle at it intently. His fingers kept a steady rhythm, thrusting inside her as he worked. These slow, rare moments with Nat were something he rarely got, and Clint wasn't about to give anything less than every effort he had to make it perfect. Their wilder, rougher fucks were fun, but he always found himself wishing they had more time and feeling as if the woman had been torn from him as she so often left with barely a kiss on the cheek and a "thanks."
What the others couldn't hear of the medics' conversations, Logan could. He had to fight the rush of guilt he felt. This was his fault. All of it. If he hadn't been so stupid... The weight of the weapon he'd just barely managed to take from Steve's hands before the man collapsed reminded him what he had to do. He focused on Nat. "I won't need a medic. I might need a few minutes, but no medics. Or they'll need medics." It wasn't a threat, just a warning. Logan didn't want to come to finding out he'd maimed or killed another person. //Hospitality's worn thin already,// he thought to himself, hoisting the gun and looking at it closely. He still remembered exactly what Steve had shown him. It was the least he could do.
"Right behind you." Steve climbed into the passenger seat and got comfortable - which wasn't hard considering that the car, like everything else Tony Stark owned, was the best that money could buy. The leather seat fit like a glove, and Steve found himself reflecting on the benefits of being a billionaire. "Nice ride," he allowed with a smile as he looked over the sleek interior. So what did a billionaire playboy genius do when he wasn’t  picking up women or buying fancy cars? "Where to?"
Jemma's eyebrows rose up toward her hairline. "Uh, is that... is that a good... nevermind," she decided halfway through the question. It really didn't matter whether it was a good idea or not. It was probably the only idea, and she knew it. Instead of dwelling, Jemma smiled faintly. "Well, I am glad to hear that we get to finish this. I'd hate for you to only have half a muffin. They're divine, aren't they?" She could read the anxiety easily enough. Bruce needed a distraction. She was completely fine with the idea of providing one.
Logan tilted his head at Clint and then shifted his gaze to Nat. "Startin' to get a little uncomfortable, how you people seem to know more about me than I do."
In which Logan tries to help, Tony is a terrible patient, and Scott takes his new eyes for a test drive
Bruce was pretty sure he hadn't put more than two seconds' thought into what he was going to wear in years. Going through his wardrobe, it was hard to feel like he had any decent options. He finally settled on his typical button-down shirt tucked into his jeans, then spent what felt like forever fooling with his hair before leaving his room looking more or less the way he always did. He was also painfully early, and he couldn't help but smile when he caught sight of Jemma already waiting for him. //Wow.// "You look nice," he said, feeling oddly nervous. That was an understatement. Jemma looked incredible in the sun dress with her hair down. Bruce suddenly felt woefully sloppy in spite of having a fresh shave, but still managed a smile. "So, you know all the coffee shops within five miles of here. Any recommendations?"
Logan narrowed his eyes, though he stilled a little at the mention of other mutants. //Magneto? Couldn't be... It sure as hell wouldn't've been Xavier, unless Loki had pulled some weird god-tricks.// "If you think I'm givin' up anything just to get outta here, you can stick that staff o' yours where the sun don't shine. You don't have anything I want," he growled, though he couldn't help but wonder in the back of his mind what a god could offer him. He shook his head as he tried to shake away his doubt. "I ain't makin' any deals with you. I could'a thrown Stryker's fat, bureaucratic ass further than I trust you."
Steve smiled but couldn't quite help blushing all over again. Tony was still wearing nothing but a towel, and Steve couldn't quite decide whether to look toward the man or away from him. He didn't know which was more conspicuous. "This looks perfect." The room was decorated in the tasteful, modern style that was the norm for Tony. Steve was surprised to find that instead of finding it foreign, he felt immediately at home in the space.
Steve sighed and jumped out behind them. No matter how the mission went, it was going to be a mess. Loki didn't do neat and tidy and, so far, neither did they. The Avengers were effective, but they were a long way from a cohesive, smooth unit. //Neat and tidy's overrated,// Steve decided as he deployed his shoot. A water jump was one thing, but the fewer bumps and bruises he landed with the more he could tolerate getting if the fight got rough. He hoped with the course they'd mapped out, the other team would land on the other side and, with the help of the surrounding terrain,  make it less likely for Loki to get past them.
"Jarvis, cancel the drunk excuse. Steve, I think Joe Public knows about everyone else I've kissed, so I'm not worried about what other people know," Tony explained. Really, it barely mattered anymore. As far as his social life was concerned, the most shocking thing Tony could think of would probably be met with an adoring grin, shrug of the shoulders, and a comment along the lines of "That's Tony Stark!" At least, as far as most people were concerned. Fury seemed able to get his eyepatch in a twist no matter how many times Tony managed to push the bounds of human decency. //Or inhuman decency,// he reminded himself, flicking a look at Logan.
Bruce made sure to grab a hug from Tony and tell the man he was glad he was alive before he headed back to his suite. He took a few moments to put on clothes that didn't smell like the inside of a cargo plane and put himself back together. He knew he should probably be resting, but he didn't feel tired. Far from it. He was anxious to see if Tony's nanosuit had uploaded it's information once they'd gotten back to the tower. If Jarvis was on his game, it would have been. He was even more anxious, though, to just see Jemma and give her some good news.
Feeling awkward again, Logan shrugged once more. "You can think about it. Meantime, I'm gonna get some coffee and maybe some breakfast from the kitchen. Want me to show you how to get there?"
"I think it might take me at least a half hour to eat breakfast," Tony decided, running his fingers through Steve's hair and clearly not intending to get up anytime in the immediate future. He would have been reluctant to get up at any rate, but the possibility that he might very well be going into a true shitstorm in the next few days with no assurance of survival made it damned near impossible to resist the chance to steal every last second with Steve that he could. "And I promise not to kill Fitz-Simmons. I might completely destroy their sense of self worth, but that's another story."
Logan grinned broadly. Maybe he couldn't get drunk, but he was definitely convinced that alcohol was an amazing substance. "Oh, I know it could be fun," he rumbled, leaning in to press his lips to Scott's. He wasn't sure if he owed Scott or Nat more for this one. "Pretty sure you won't regret it. Especially considerin' the company." He wondered absently about the remark regarding Clint's freedom of choice but decided to let the comment lie. He had a feeling that Nat and Clint had a relationship on a whole other level of complicated.
"Shut up," the burly man grated out. His accent was heavy, and Darien had no idea whether it was Russian or German or just really terrible English. "Quiet. No move."
Clint frowned, clearly hating the idea. He reached out and grabbed Nat's hand, holding onto her, hoping he could reassure her a little. "I'll get him this time, Nat. For good." It had been jarring being compromised the first time. This time, he'd been manipulated into doing things he'd never have considered. He wasn't sure which was worse. He knew he wasn't going to tolerate Loki messing with his friends any further.
"Okay? That just happens to be my favorite." Tony paused as he stepped inside, glancing toward the ceiling. "Jarvis, you haven't been divulging all my secret to Captain Rogers, have you?"
Tony's first conscious thought was that his mouth felt like sandpaper. A jolt followed as his eyes flew open, his last solid memory being of the fight that had landed him here. //Here...? Sick bay,// he assessed, relaxing and then smiling a little as his gaze fell on Steve, leaned over some book or magazine or another. "Y'know, smartphones're more entertaining. And make you look less like an old guy," he murmured tiredly. He could tell he'd been given painkillers. His wounds still hurt, though. "Could use a glass of scotch..."
"Fine," Logan sighed as if put out. He was far from exhausted, but having a healing factor could do that for you. He still didn't mind the idea of sleep, though, and he pulled Scott in close to him. "Kinda unfair, though, tellin' me I can take care o' your needs and then goin' to sleep. I think ya might owe me one." He closed his eyes, then mumbled, "Also, regarding the singin', I'm not the one who had a Backstreet Boys in the CD player when I stole your car and drove to Bobby's house."
Steve woke in the morning still curled happily around Tony. He smiled against the man's bare shoulder and then nuzzled against Tony's neck. He didn't care if it was sappy or silly. He liked cuddling Tony, damn it. And try as he might to pretend otherwise, Tony liked it too. "Morning, handsome," he whispered with a kiss to Tony's ear. "Gonna put on some clothes and get us breakfast. And decent coffee. Any requests?"
"Za Vas!" Natasha clicked her glass against each man's in turn and then smiled at Scott. "For the record - and, Logan, stop me if I'm wrong on this - I don't expect it was a real step down for him. Given that scoop, I take requests. Men? Women?" She smiled at the slightly stunned look on Scott's face and decided to keep the disclosure salacious but not specific. "It's fun showing off sometimes. Not really a threesome. Just fucking with an audience. Luckily Clint has plenty of friends who enjoy watching." Natasha arched an eyebrow in Logan's direction. "How's that?"
Tony smiled, settling easily into the new position. "Well, I am pretty enjoyable," he said easily, pressing his lips to Steve's. "And you can take advantage of about anything you want. Pretty sure I'd have a tough time telling you no." He ran his fingers through blonde hair, stealing another kiss before his fingers lightly dipped between the buttons of Steve's shirt. "Pretty sure you've seduced me past the point of being able to disagree with you."
A pleasantly surprised grunt escaped Clint's lips at the aggressive move, and he braced his hand against the wall behind Darien. "Fuck..." he managed. "Damn nice mouth on you." Impatient, he thrust forward again. "You look good down there. Like the perfect little bitch." He took a few moments to use Darien's mouth before shoving the man away. "Take your clothes off."
Steve eyed the chair. "No, I'm fine. I don't need the-"
Tony had to shove back the cold swell of fear the words inspired. He didn't ask about them. Loki seemed set on keeping his promises in his own weird way, and Tony felt safe assuming they were alive. Details he didn't want. "Considerate," he said, trying to keep his bluff in. He wasn't sure how much Loki could read off of him, if the god could see his worry for his friends. The billionaire had tugged his pants back on in Loki's absence but hadn't bothered with anything else. He'd settled into Loki's armchair, managing to nibble at the food a little more. "So are you gonna keep turning bluer?"
Clint held out his hands for the massive triple shot mocha like a kid reaching for a candy bar. He smiled as he took the first sip, then nodded his approval. "Okay, this place is definitely acceptable. Maybe even awesome. I also may have to get some kind of revenge, though, for you not telling me about it sooner."
“Yeah. Of course.” Steve tried to sound at ease, but he knew he wasn’t managing well by the look on Tony’s face. “I’ll come back as soon as I can - hopefully to visit you in your room instead of here.” Offering what he hoped was a bright smile, Steve made his way out. He was so distracted that he almost bowled over Natasha, who had apparently been lurking nearby. “Oh! Sorry.”
Scott's stomach was twisted in knots. He wanted to fly off the handle and hit someone, but he'd spent long enough keeping such impulses in control that it was second nature. "So where do we start?"
Tony wasn't accustomed to having someone significantly larger and stronger holding him close. It felt oddly safe, and the near-constant buzz of internal energy within Tony ebbed a little at the sensationg of security he felt when Steve pulled him in. He sighed, relaxing against the blonde as Steve spoke. The words brought his gaze up to Steve's face, and Tony grinned a little. "I think I might be alright with that," he said, knowing that he was, at the least, committing to some exclusivity. He knew he wanted at least that much with Steve. He also knew it was way too early to plan on more. They were close. They gave a shit about each other more than simple teammates probably should have. // But you have a terrible way of ruining really good things,// a harsh voice in the back of Tony's mind reminded him as thoughts of Pepper flickered through his mind. Shoving the worries aside, Tony leaned resolutely against his lover, listening to Steve's heartbeat gradually slow in the aftermath.
"He knocked one of the guys the fuck out with a bag of flour. Well, distracted him and then knocked him the fuck out," the clerk said, grinning broadly. "Your buddy's a real badass." She seemed to register the way they stood together, the oddly protective give-and-take between them, and smiled. "And you make a cute couple."
"Funny how people think it only takes once," Victor said, faintly amused. He wondered how long it took the X-Men to figure out that heaving him off a high cliff hadn't done much in the way of killing him. "Well, let me know when we're ready to move. I'd love to finish what I started on Stark, and that shitbird archer, too."
Tony yawned, "You should get sleep, too. I mean, serum aside, you're cranky when you don't. I mean, relatively. You're still excessively nice, though. Even when you're... cranky..." Between the drugs and the rough day, Tony didn't have much consciousness left in him. Finally giving up on proving he was fine, he let himself fall asleep.
"I just like to make sure I'm clear."
"Once we have a decent buzz on, we should see about some dancing." Scott nudged Logan. "What do you say?"
Tony was literally speechless for a few seconds. "I... uh... Sorry. I just got very suddenly manhandled, and I'm going to need a second before oxygen starts moving to my brain again," he panted, swallowing hard and wondering if it was his heart or the arc reactor that felt ready to hop out of his chest. He squirmed anxiously underneath Steve's powerful frame, but when that didn't do anything to get some kind of gratification out of his partner, Tony used every ounce of what little willpower he had to try and formulate a real response. "Well, you could start by touching me, and then maybe fuck me until I forget English? I think I'd like that," he breathed, nipping at Steve's throat and then reaching down to run his hand over Steve's shaft once again. "Y'know, actually... wouldn't mind sucking on this some, too."
"No, you're not," Clint agreed, forcing himself to slide away from Phil's lap. He was already half hard, his voice rough from arousal, and his goal had been to take things a little slower. He was pretty sure that if he stayed in Phil's lap, he was going to miss that goal. They'd started out with no brakes, and now Clint wanted to make sure that this wasn't like all his other flings. "But I think that's why it's a good thing. That we're a good thing. I don't think I need my usual. I think I need anything but," he said, his hands still roaming over the other man's chest.
"So, I'm not much of a chemist."
Phil's phone buzzed, and he pulled it out, half expecting to see a message from Fury. Instead he saw Logan's name on the screen. Given that he was doing little more than standing outside the door ready to play interference if the doctors wanted to try to chase Tony out, he tapped a quick reply. ALIVE. SERUM EFFECTS HAVE BEEN NULLIFIED. TONY'S WITH HIM.
“Me too,” Steve agreed solemnly. He thought of what Tony had confessed and felt the taste of bile in the back of his mouth. Bucky Barnes was the best man he’d ever known, and he was beyond furious over what Hydra had done to him. “If they don’t let you out… I mean, I was supposed to, uh… to see Tony tonight, but we can reschedule.” The idea of doing that made him feel like the worst potential boyfriend in the world. The idea of not doing that made him feel like the worst friend in the world. “I want to make sure you’re okay, Buck.”
"Would you say that if I told you I'd still want it if I was sober?" Scott didn't want to stop. He could tell that Logan wanted it as badly as he did. The other man wasn't exactly a master of subtlety, and the situation didn't call for subtle. "I don't wanna wait." Scott knew himself well enough to know that he'd stop if Logan really wanted to. Swallowing hard, his hands came to rest on Logan's thighs. "Don't make me stop." The words were a plea rather than an order, weighty with the renewed need he felt.
"Not sure I could deal with listening to Stark give Rogers a BJ in the row behind me while I tried to watch a movie. We can keep it you and me. Maybe drag Nat along if she isn't horrified by the idea of bad 80s movies," Clint decided, flexing his arms back and twisting until his lower back popped. Walking out of the theater, he noticed that the weather was lightly overcast and generally rather pleasant. "Wanna go for a walk or something? Not up for going back to the tower just yet." He knew it was selfish to run away from their issues. He also really couldn't bring himself to be unselfish just yet.
For a moment Steve glanced up at Logan, smiling lopsidedly at him, unable to keep from sharing the shaky elation of the moment. He met Tony's gaze in the next heartbeat and held it. With one hand braced against the bed, Steve carefully guided himself toward the other man's twitching hole. The muscle protested, tried to force him out, and then gave all at once. The larger man pushed harder and slowly slid home, inch by agonizingly slow inch, unwilling to rush even for a second. "You feel so good... so good, Tony," Steve murmured as he moved. Finally his cock was fully sheathed inside the other man's body, and Steve paused to let them both catch their breath.
Logan raised an eyebrow. "You rebel, you," he deadpanned as he started to dry himself off. "Never would'a pegged you as someone who'd snooze through a meeting. I'd figure that'd be tough to pull off with the Professor around." Tossing the towel carelessly on the floor, Logan sidled up beside his lover and gave Scott's ass a squeeze and his shoulder a nip before he moved back to the bedroom, stretching and settling on the edge of the bed. "So now what? When're you going to try out your new eyes?"
"So... what is it that you... do... exactly?" It had definitely occurred to Clint that the Cap had taken the heavy hitters and left them with a wildcard. He knew that Steve wasn't the sort to do something stupid, so there obviously had to be more to this guy than just being an asshole. Clint had to admit he hadn't read Logan's file; looking through hours of footage and pages of text just weren't what the archer had signed up for. //Yeah, that's a habit I've gotta change, I guess.//
“If you say so,” Bucky decided, hearing the emotion in Steve’s voice. “We’ve come a long way since Brooklyn, haven’t we?” His gaze wandered over his friend’s form; Steve looked exactly the same, except for his eyes. They spoke of untold things Steve Rogers had seen and done. It made his heart ache not only for Steve, but for the time they had both lost. “So,” he started, searching for a topic to break the awkward silence, “sounds like you’re still suiting up.”
Tony looked down at their hands as well. "I was kinda afraid I would freak out," he confessed. It still felt a little surreal. He smiled when Steve looked back up at him. "Still love you." Knowing that wasn't the only question in Steve's mind, the billionaire leaned down, lips a breath away from Steve's, hand coming to rest on the blonde's lean hip and eyes darkening a little. "Still want you, too."
"Captain Rogers, it's good to see you awake." The man took in Steve's suddenly erratic vitals and frowned. "You need to breathe slowly. It's been awhile since you had to worry about it, but you're stuck in a hell of a bronchial spasm right now. We're going to keep you on the oxygen until it relaxes, and we've given you a steroid that should help too."
The rest wasn't an easy one, and Tony's mind was filled with images of Loki, moving over him, doing all the right things to drive him out of his mind. The dream reached a crescendo, and Tony woke with a jerk, hard and gasping the god's name.
Steve managed a genuine smile at that, "There aren't a lot of people who would consider someone who fought in World War Two young, so I'll take that as a compliment."
Bobby turned his gaze to the building and looked it over. It looked for all the world like a standard bunker. "I'm guessing it's bigger on the inside."
Scott's chest heaved like he'd been running a marathon. He gripped Logan's belt loops to pull their hips into closer contact. His own cock had gladly risen to the occasion, straining against his jeans. The duel friction from the denim and Logan's body was torturous and wonderful. After all the uncertainty and fear, letting go was a revelation. "You have no idea much I want you right now."
Logan, barely able to articulate words by then, nodded and pressed his head into Scott's hand as the man stroked fingers through his hair. Muscles rippled visibly in his jaw as he fought to keep control. As if to vent some frustration, he nipped at Scott's collarbone. He knew he had to be bruising his lover, but he figured it was far better than what he wanted to do. "Scott..." he moaned, a combination of arousal and slowly breaking discipline behind the word.
Clint had the decency to blush a little at that, but mostly because the mention of the shirt reminded him of the related conversation centered around boxers and pajamas. "Yeah, uh, apparently I have merchandise," he said, looking a little sheepish. "We were trying to stay casual. Trying to keep from going crazy. One of our best friends was in jail, and I wasn't even allowed to see her without handcuffs, soooo... we got a little stir crazy. But, yeah... uh, apparently there're boxers and PJs, too. I'm blaming Stark."
"Love you, too," Tony said with a smile. "I'd offer myself as a body pillow, but I'm told the reactor's kinda pokey." He pushed himself up as well, glancing at the aftermath of their coupling. "Yeah, we're gonna have some cleaning to do. And then some mystery stains to make the cleanup crew take care of." He pulled Steve in for another kiss. "Worth it. I like making you all messy."
Bruce made a point to stand aside, trying to edge toward Frigga. Logan might be right, but he preferred to at least try the easy way first. “Think you can help us out here, Your Highness?”
Clint had raised the hammer the minute Tony had run at Steve. "Loki, if this is some kind of illusion..." he growled.
Logan nodded. "Fair enough. You pencil necks come up with somethin' I can use, and I'll help."
With every second that passed, Darien felt like he'd walked in on something he shouldn't be a part of. "I can... go. You two seem like you need to catch up."
Logan took over pushing the gurney, though he felt as if, for the moment, Creed needed protection from Clint more than any of them needed protection from him.
Logan hoped that Scott didn't catch the slight flutter of his jaw as he started to volunteer himself in answer. //That took a sharp left turn.// "Uh, not offhand," he answered, his mind flashing back to Steve and Tony and their fling together. He swallowed hard, looking way more composed than he felt internally. "I could, y'know, keep an ear out, but maybe you should take it slow? With all the... uh... y'know..." //The whole nearly getting raped thing…//
Logan took another step back. "Y'know what, maybe I should just--"
The sentiment was grudging, certainly, but earnest, and Loki said, "Thank you, Captain."
Muttering to himself, Tony complied, climbing into the front passenger seat, much to the cabbie's apparent chagrin.
"Use the word 'porking'. Very important. There's a good tip in it for you, too."
The look went straight to Tony's cock and he barely bit back a whimper in response. "Fuck, where'd you learn to look like that?" he breathed, unable to keep from voicing the thought. Getting a better hold of himself, he shook his head. "I don't ask nicely." His slickened fingers brushed slowly over the blonde's puckered hole, pressing lightly as if to penetrate and then sliding a little lower, teasing the perineum before gliding back up. "Think I'd rather just make you," he said, putting a slight growl into his voice.
Tony picked up a shirt, started to pull it on, then reconsidered when he tried to raise his arms above his head. "Y'know, this didn't hurt as much a few minutes ago. Maybe I should take some aspirin. Or gin."
Coulson found himself wishing Clint would come out more with each passing second. He wanted to know how Nat was and how Clint was handling it.
"Maybe it doesn't matter who you were before," Steve answered earnestly. "What matters is the man you are now and the choices you make from here." He ducked his head, suddenly sheepish. "Sorry. Tony always tells me I sound like a cheap recruitment poster when I talk like that." Instead of saying more, Steve tucked into his food. As always, the fare was filling and well cooked. He liked even more that the restaurant's atmosphere was quiet and laid back with none of the bustling, overwrought energy that infused the rest of the city. "Maybe the two of us should go out to a bar or something. We did pretty well with the waitress."
//I can't handle another minute o' this.// Logan was sick and tired of the parade of slaves, wannabe pimps, creepy billionaires, and shady nightclubs that had made up the majority of the past ninety-six hours of his life. He couldn't exactly declare that he was looking for "something with overpriced, red-tinted sunglasses and a weird penchant for boy bands" and have himself lead to the man he was looking for. Half of him wanted to wipe out every dingy little smallfry slave dealer he encountered and set all their "acquisitions" free, but he knew that he'd create a dead end for himself and for SHIELD if he did so. His mission was to save Scott and collect enough intel for SHIELD to be able to dig into this ring and shut it down in a more permanent fashion.
"And Logan?"
"Neither did I," Nat agreed with the faintest hint of a smile. "Sit down. Get comfortable. I think you need to see this." More gently, she assured, "I won't tell you to leave him alone. I won't tell him to leave you alone. I'm just telling you that until I'm done with him tonight, he's mine... unless I say otherwise."
He could hear Pepper's worried voice among the buzz of sounds behind him, but he couldn't bring himself to move aside to let her be the one crouching at Tony's side. Leaning in, he was relieved to feel Tony's breath stir against his cheek despite the harsh bloom of blood on his forehead. "Tony? C'mon, talk to me... I need you to wake up. Bruce isn't here, so you'll have to open your eyes for me instead." He reached for one of Tony's hands, squeezing it without thinking about how strange it might look to someone watching. All that mattered was Tony opening his eyes again.
"Damn, there goes my plans for every day for the rest of our lives." Coulson rolled his eyes but considered the problem at hand. "Tell you what, you go to your place, get some fresh clothes, I'll get dressed. You meet me downstairs in fifteen minutes and I'll have a plan." Making plans was, after all, what he did. He just didn't usually get to make plans that included anything social. "And if you see Natasha, tell her the fruit basket's in the mail."
Logan shifted uneasily at the mention of Jean, his eyes sliding to Scott. He knew it was irrational, but he couldn't help but wonder if such sentiments might convince Scott to return to the mansion. The prospect of Jean actually showing up and making Scott reconsider - directly or not - definitely had the feral mutant worried. "It'll be good to have some help," he said. "They... we... know them pretty well."
Natasha chuckled at his obvious surprise. "Sex is easy. Something that might be more than sex..." She shrugged and danced in close to Scott. "Appearances can be deceiving." It could still all go horribly wrong, and she knew it. Clint and feelings could get awkward pretty fast, and Coulson didn't exactly have a string of long, meaningful relationships behind him either. The hope was that together they could figure out the rough patches. "If you boys can do it, I think anyone can."
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
"Of... oh, come on, Jemma! I like Dr. Banner, you know I do, but he... well, he... he's still..."
Across the table, Natasha smiled. "Let's make it hurt." She hadn't missed the fact that Clint and Phil arrived to the meeting together or the way they kept glancing at one another. Her heart warmed at the sight, but it also worried her. The timing was bad. Loki would use any connections they had. He'd already done it to try and tear the team apart once. "And let's all come back in one piece."
"Well," Victor said, calculating blue eyes looking over Clint's face, "I was told I get to entertain myself with the two of you." His gaze fixed on Phil. "I just have to decide who I want to break first."
Tony quirked a faint smile. "That look works just fine for Barton. And now the secret of his fashion success is out: medical. But yeah, we can get you something else. You could always borrow one of my t-shirts to mix it up until then." Tony was pretty sure that even his clothes would be too big for Steve, but the idea of the blonde in a baggy Iron Maiden shirt actually made him smile a little. It was reassuring in a way that Steve was focusing on practical concerns. It meant that he wasn't as preoccupied with his physical state as he had been. //Little steps.//
Victor was already drawing away and searching for his discarded clothing. "What? No 'thank you'?" he said, grinning and chuckling. It had been a good fuck, no doubt. Surreal, almost intimidating, but definitely good. Victor pulled on his pants but didn't bother with anything else. He headed to the door, the rest of his clothes bundled in one arm. He paused by the door and glanced back at Loki. "Lemme know if you need some more o' this," he said, tossing the god a confident grin before disappearing out the door.
Tony's smirk faded. His expression shifted to something indistinct. Vulnerable. Uncertain. Tony shifted uneasily, looking away for a moment. "I, uh... thank you," he murmured, reaching up to place his hand over Steve's. It was hard to know what to say. Tony quirked a faint smile before looking back up at Steve. "Sorry. I'm... not good at this whole... feelings thing. At least, not talking about them. I am pretty happy, though. With you."
Clint nodded at Steve's promise. "I think it's gonna be the only way to get rid of him permanently. His brother's already proven soft on him. We can't let him leave the planet this time," he insisted, then fell silent, poking at his food again. He realized a moment later he was being watched and looked up in time to catch Phil's apologetic smile. He clapped a hand on the man's shoulder. "It's okay. You're just looking out for me," he said, then dug back into his food. They were right. He knew they were, but it ate at him that Loki was still standing. If he'd had just a few more seconds, just a little bit better advantage, or if May hadn't called him off…
The touches seemed to leave trails of tingling heat in their wake, and Logan rumbled, nuzzling Scott's neck. He grabbed a handful of Scott's firm ass and pulled him closer. "Not tired yet, hm?" he asked, clearly amused. It was hot, how much Scott wanted him. Being able to inspire that kind of lust in someone was a powerful feeling, and Logan's animal half could definitely understand and appreciate the primal nature of such pull.
The tension in the room had ratcheted up so quickly it made Steve's head spin. He held up a hand. "Guys? We came here to have a drink and relax, not to pick apart each other's habits. You need to play nice." Even though the music pumping through the speakers wasn't his usual, Steve rose and offered, "Want to dance?" Maybe if he could at least separate the two men for a few minutes, things could go back to a base level of animosity.
"Remind me not to combine thinking and blow jobs. It's a bad way to go," Steve answered with a sigh as he righted his clothes and did his best to make his hair presentable. When the door opened, he nodded solemnly to the men filing in for a meeting. They all looked vaguely shell-shocked at the implication of what had been going on in the room and Steve tried to pretend he had no idea that they were staring. His cheeks were flaming red by the time they were free of the distraction. "Right now I think I'm done with thinking for the day. What about you?" Steve asked in a tone that seemed oddly coy considering he'd been on his knees sucking Tony off a few minutes before. "You have any plans?"
"That's your team," the man agreed placidly, "but that's not what I asked about. The two of you are living together. He's hardly left your side. Had to knock him out just to get to you. That's seems very, very friendly." It was easy to see that the drugs were making Tony a little loopy, but that was for the best. The more pliant he was, the easier it would be to put on a proper show. "Your conquests are common knowledge, Mr. Stark. Are you trying to tell me that you have no interest whatsoever in Steve Rogers apart from professional courtesy?"
"He seems, uh, colorful," Scott allowed. "Kinda hard seeing him being the kind of guy who'd end up hooked up with Captain America."
Steve felt like he could finally breathe again when the door to Tony's room closed behind him. He tried to be as quiet as possible, not wanting to wake the man if he was resting. Naturally when he arrived, he found Tony propped up in bed tapping away at his tablet. The sight brought a smile to his lips, and Steve leaned against the door frame to watch. "I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be resting." Apart from a few bumps, bruises, and scrapes that would heal up quickly, medical had been satisfied that Steve was in one piece.
"Really good." It felt normal. Since they'd gotten back, nothing else had, but sitting at the counter with Clint pressed against him and a plate of food was a slice of perfection. The silent assurance that eventually things could be normal and okay again soothed Phil's soul. "You're excellent breakfast company." Clint in the morning, he was coming to learn, was different than Clint once he'd had time to wake up and get his brain firing. He was a softer, more subdued version of himself - and every bit as wonderful. A glance at the clock made him frown briefly. "Unfortunately I think reality's going to intrude soon. After that, I suspect we're going to have to check in with the team. Nat's not going to take our word for it that we're alive."
Clint smiled grimly, the thought a solid bit of reassurance for himself as well. "That'd definitely make me feel better. Especially if I can use him for target practice a few-" The sound of the cell door opening froze Clint's blood in his veins. He tensed, shoving himself to his feet, looking ready to fight as he put himself instinctively between Victor and Phil.
"Good," Clint purred, his breath hitching as he felt Darien's muscles tighten around him. Almost as if he could hear Darien's desires, he murmured, "You don't cum until I tell you to." He couldn't blame the other man. He wanted more, too. Reluctantly, he shoved Darien away, onto the plushly carpeted floor. He didn't allow the separation to last long, though, more or less pouncing on his partner. He nipped roughly at Darien's lower lip as he guided his cock to the man's entrance once more, his hooded gaze fixed on Darien's face. He was silent for a moment as a drop of sweat trickled along his jawline, then, "Beg me for it."
"You're honestly doing brilliantly. Still a good deal of weight and a few inches to put on, of course, but, Captain, you're very nearly normalized." Simmons was beaming at the man as she spoke and offered a soft smile to Tony as well. "I think you're well on the road to recovery. Give it another day or two, and I don't think anyone will have any idea this ever happened.
Despite his surprise at Coulson's vehemence, Steve echoed, "He's not wrong." His own tray was laden with at least twice what either of his companions had taken with them. "We're down enough people, and after what happened last time... look, we don't know if that left any holes." For all they knew, it would be easier for Loki to get inside of Clint all over again if he chose to. "I'd rather be too careful than not enough."
, Mr. Stark.”
“That’s the sledding with the tire, right? No, I haven’t done that.”
Tony didn’t have to ask, he knew Steve wasn’t going to let him go, that there wouldn’t be a safer place than by Steve’s side. He knew Steve would be there in the morning, and they had finished, and Steve tenderly cleaned them both off, Tony quickly fell asleep hugging Steve.
Tony’s cat ears were now up at attention as he put the coffee grinds in his hands down. “Have you been working out?”
“Yeah, it didn’t burn off the energy like I hoped it would.”
Steve pulled Tony in closer and deepened the kiss, with a pressure that Steve meant as
“Thank you so much, Tony, I love it! It’s so sweet and lovely, and . . . has some blank pages?” Steve looked a bit confused as he began to turn through the second half of the book, which was all blank.
“I know he told you two to watch over me but it’s very disturbing trying to go to sleep with two sets of eyes glaring at you.”  Tony turned over in bed to look at the tsums, who were still staring at him.
It had been a few months since their unexpected camping trip by the lake, and Steve still thought about that night fondly. The crisp air, swimming and telling ghost stories by the campfire, snuggling up at night - it was a great way to make the best of a bad situation, made even better that he got to do all of that with Tony. It had also been a surprising opportunity to enjoy being out in nature, something Steve barely got to do now in his busy life as an Avenger but never got to enjoy as a child.
“Sure,” Steve replied with a smile.
Steve shrugged. “Eh. There are worst ways to spend your 94th birthday. Not really like I was gonna have plans anyway. . .” Steve said, trailing off quietly. He stared down at the floor, away from Tony’s gaze. “Guess I better go get ready.”
“Steve, we literally fought giant monsters with flame breath two weeks ago. I think you and I can handle a ride on a large tire.”
“Sure, Mr. Stark,” the nurse replied as she whisked Steve away and Tony quickly left. Steve was so confused, and wondered why Tony decided not to stay. He was cleaned up and went back to his room that night, still unclear how he ended up both outside
“Tsum tsum!”
, Steve thought.
Tony looked at Steve curiously. “You’re not mad that I didn’t speak up?”
“The doctors kept asking me for details but I honestly don’t know what to tell them. What happened?”
“Don’t know, but this is why they called us - specifically you and me - in.”
The sessions were fun, and in hindsight, probably the catalyst for Tony’s crush getting worse. Spending alone time with Steve just confirmed that he was as much as a cute dork that Tony thought he was. Hours spent debating designs, watching Steve make sketches, pouring through history books from the Timeless Archives, examining models of armor from the past, Tony tinkering with wires - a lot of time spent in close quarters alone.
And definitely not the brown wolf whose reflection he had seen in his dream. Steve quickly changed and took a cold shower to wake himself up. After his shower he got dressed and went to the common area to grab some food.
“Why can’t you just tell him how you feel? I honestly don’t get it, Tony. You’re making yourself miserable over wanting to be with him so badly - just ask him! You used to ask out girls all the time, no problem. Steve is one of if not the nicest person on this campus. He doesn’t bite! Just ask him out for a drink or something.
The news was currently on the weather report. “And the skies over the tri-state area are expected to be clear for tonight’s supermoon. Before you go to bed make sure to take a peek outside and you should see a beautiful big full moon somewhere in the sky. It’s sure to be a treat,” the meteorologist said.
Finally clear for a moment, as Hulkling and Hawkeye took out the rest of the agents, Steve felt around his pocket and felt the ring from their armor project.
“Yes, Tony.”
“JARVIS, raise the alarm. Alert Director Fury about an incoming attack, and that all hands on deck are needed. Red alert. Iron Man and Captain America responding first right now,” Tony shouted as the security siren went off.
“Is something wrong?” Tony asked, pulling Steve aside a metal art booth to let shoppers pass.
“But this is a Chuck E. Cheese.”
naked.
“Uhh -”
made me nervous and distracted. I honestly didn’t think I’d be seeing you there, those mixers can be fun but sometimes they’re an awkward nightmare.”
To make matters worse, Steve was in love with Tony.
“Hey, it’s okay. You’re safe now. You’re with me, and you’re safe.” Steve reached an arm around Tony, who was still shaking and pulled the man in close to his side. Tony curled in toward Steve, and Steve moved his hand reassuringly up and down Tony’s back. After awhile, when Tony’s breathing calmed down and returned to normal, Steve moved them both back onto the bed, pulling Tony into his arms and letting Tony lay on Steve’s chest.
The pair finally ended up back by the doorway to hang the last of the decorations. Green garland went around the doorframe, with Steve and Tony each taping up a corner.
“That sounds great, Tony.”
And Steve did as he promised, passing small appetizers to Tony as they walked through the museum and Steve pointed out artists or pieces he knew. They made their way to the rooftop patio, and the slightly cool spring air made Tony move closer to Steve for warmth as they stared out over the last remaining bits of sun setting over the river.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said, siding up next to him at the bar.
Nat leaned against the kitchen counter with her back to the living area. “
They found a free booth and Bucky got up to grab them drinks.
“I’ve got you, Tony,” Steve would say, carefully catching Tony every time he was close to falling.
Tony let out a small laugh. “It’s silly, thinking about now. I wanted to ask you out so badly and was too terrified to do it. Didn’t know how. But Jan would always tell me -”
The tsums not on Steve quickly scrambled over to the edge of the ball pit as Tony put his phone down and extended a hand to pluck the tsums out and put them down by the pizza.
But now he was an adult, and one with super abilities at that; so as much as he understood and appreciated his mother’s apprehension he wasn’t going to miss out on the winter fun now.
Steve’s cheeks turned a bit pink. “Aww, thanks.” He picked a branch and placed a candy cane down, and began to move around Tony as they proceeded to decorate. Ornaments, bells, and lights. Steve wrapped the string lights around the tree as Tony walked back and forth under Steve’s arms, placing ornaments in spots all around.
“Are you sure?”
“Tsum?” Tony heard a worried noise from his tsum as he opened his eyes to see both his and Steve’s tsums staring at him. The happiness he felt to see the tsums quickly got replaced with a pounding headache and a burning sensation in his throat. His ears were clogged, his head felt a little swimmy, and Tony’s first attempt to sit up was an immediate failure.
He reached a clearing with a small lake, just like he had seen in his dream. The bright full moon reflected off the lake. Steve trotted over, without hesitation. He knew, and he wanted to see it for himself.
Tony thought about the past couple of months since the football incident. “I just don’t think Steve is into me.”
Jan was right.
Tony cleaned up and walked over to the common area. Steve was sitting on the couch, the TV off and the lights dimmed. When Steve saw Tony he immediately stood up.
“- I enjoy spending time with you, Tony. Plus, like you said - we all need a break sometimes. Thank you for putting this all together, it means a lot.”
She chuckled and raised a hand to straighten Steve's hair with a quick flick of her fingers. "I don't get paid the big bucks because I'm awful at this." She winked at Steve and then gave Tony a long look as if assuring herself he was actually standing there. "You have meetings tomorrow. Lots of them. As many as I can actually schedule because you have no idea how much paperwork and how many board meetings I've been through in the past two days. No idea." When he opened his mouth to say something, she held up a finger. "Let me enjoy you being alive. Later, you get to speak."
"Mmm hmm." Coulson knew the difference. Clint could fake his tone, but he couldn't really do much about his heart rate. Still, he was willing to play along. It was hard to resist doing a little something anyway. Phil let his lips brush against the shell of Clint's ear. "Well, far be it from me to keep you from sleeping on a beautiful afternoon like this. Even if I do enjoy hearing you talk." He actually did. There were missions where the steady stream of conversation from Clint had helped keep him sane. "Just going to keep kissing your ear, though. Hope you don't mind."
Clint had to actually chuckle at that. He had to give Phil credit: it was tough to fluster the guy. He went behind the counter and found the case of stout, taking one and breaking the cap off on the counter. "Well, wouldn't wanna piss Fury off by breaking his new toys, right?"
Bruce, meanwhile, had sequestered himself carefully behind an overturned shelf. While hiding was hardly what he'd have preferred, he was fairly certain that being boxed in with a mix of friend and foe would end poorly for everyone but him.
“Probably not,” Steve admitted with a hint of a smile as he settled the pillow back on the bed, “but the tower doesn’t have a gift shop. At least not one I’ve found. Big as this place is... well, let’s just say I might’ve missed it.” Even as a work in progress - only about half of the rooms and other facilities were fully finished - the place was a maze. At times it made Steve miss the tiny, poorly lit apartment he’d occupied in Brooklyn. “Besides, I bring candy and flowers, people are going to think I’m asking you out, not helping you heal.”
"You speak the truth," the woman agreed, her own posture relaxing somewhat at the words. "I am Lady Sif of Asgard. I had hoped to find Phillip, Son of Coul amongst you. He is a friend of Thor's."
Scott snorted at that. "Not so much. Not that I object to getting laid, but... First problem is that she's terrifying. Second problem... I don't know. I need something to get me out of myself, and going after somebody who looks like Jean's little sister doesn't exactly sound like the right follow up." He paused and took a long drink. "I need change. I came here because I need change. I don't want to let myself start doing the same things over again. What's the point? What the hell's the point then?" The idea of letting leaving his life behind and going through hell be for nothing was disheartening. Scott shook his head and squared his jaw resolutely. "I'm not doing it like that again."
Fitz' expression of disgust at the familiar address evaporated for a moment at that thought. "And apart from the science-y checking, I'm assuming Captain Rogers vetted him, yeah? Things that only, uh, they would know?" He didn't want to know a single one of those things, but it seemed fair.
Clint looked away and smirked as he bit his lower lip. "Oh, I think you've still got more than a leg up on me as far as secrets go, considering I'm pretty sure you saw everything that happened in my suite for - what? - six months? A year? However long it took Fury to decide I wasn't still Loki's flying monkey. Hell, for all I know, you're still supposed to be watching me," he said with a teasing grin. He seemed much more adjusted to the idea then than he had before, but he couldn't keep himself from trying to fluster his handler all over again. Phil got flustered pretty much never, and when he did it was too endearing for words.
"I think it should be more like we'll definitely have dinner together," Bruce decided, smiling broadly. He'd been running it through his head as they walked how he'd ask for a follow-up date, and he was relieved that Jemma had beat him to the punch. "I know a great Italian place. Not too fancy, but good food." He got the feeling that neither of them wanted to go anywhere with a dress code. Though he was pretty sure he'd be more than happy to see her in sun dresses anytime she cared to wear one. "I think they have a live pianist on Friday nights."
Clint straightened, looking less upset and more like he was honestly surprised by the offer. "A cup of coffee sounds good," he finally agreed as a cab pulled up to the curb. He piled in, leaving the door open for Coulson to follow. While it obviously wasn't unusual for him to spend a night on Phil's couch or even have a cup of coffee together, he hadn't expected the agent to immediately want more time with him. He'd halfway expected Coulson to avoid eye contact or discussing what they'd just done in any context for a week, after which he figured they'd get back to eye contact and that'd be it. Immediate and further interaction of any kind hadn't really crossed his mind. //Really must be drunk. This seems crazy.// He knew he was only buzzed at most. //Maybe... No. Don't be dumb.//
Steve couldn't help but agree with the assessment. Tony felt amazing wrapped around him, and the sheer pleasure of that mingling with the harsh pain of the bites and the intrusive thrill of Logan's finger working him open all combined to make him feel dizzy. It was too much. He also didn't want it to stop for a second. Steve let his head fall forward, exposing the flesh of his shoulders gladly to Logan.
Clint smiled, feeling himself blush a little. "It was pretty cheesy, really. Just a lot of me doing a lot of acrobatics and shooting things while wearing spandex." He was downplaying it, but he hated bragging on himself. People had loved his act, especially the mercenaries that had offered him an opportunity to 'really utilize' his talents. "Though I guess if you've seen me on an op, it's about the same. Just less trapeze and more people getting dead."
Fitz muttered, "Too strong last time, obviously." He tapped at a few keys on the keyboard before raising his gaze to make actual eye contact, "We're hoping with the modifications you could make two, even three shots before you were, er, incapacitated."
The god resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the crumpled form on the floor. He'd tried to relay orders through the ranks to stand down, but naturally Creed hadn't listened. //It's on his own head, then.// Given that they'd bothered to bind the mutant, he apparently wasn't dead, though Loki couldn't profess any deep concern either way. Loki held his hands up in a universal gesture that he hoped would be understood and acknowledged. "I do not seek to fight you."
Phil had no idea how much time would be enough. How long would it take SHIELD to figure out where they were and get there? Coulson wouldn't allow himself to doubt that it was going to happen, but that didn't make a timeline any easier to put together given that he hadn't the faintest idea how far they'd traveled. For all he knew the alien gadget had flown them halfway across the world. "Don't touch him," Phil finally grated out. He knew it wasn't exactly a smart decision, but he knew that it was better than watching Clint tortured. It was better than letting one of Loki's flunkies violate him after everything he'd already been through. "Please, I'll do whatever you want, but take me first." He chose his words carefully, mindful of the fact that Creed had made it clear they were taking turns, not getting off the hook. The more placating he could be, the better it would sell. "Just tell me what you want me to do."
Tony grinned, relieved that Steve was handling the loss of the serum so well. Shifting off of his lover, he immediately tugged Steve along with him. "Love you, too, by the way," he said, settling into the sheets. "You... seriously, though. I don't think I remember having had an orgasm that intense. Then again, it could just be all the brain cells I just lost."
Bucky sank back into the sofa cushions, exhaling heavily. He pressed his fingers to his temples, massaging lightly. It did little to ease his headache. He didn’t want to talk about the flashes he’d seen, but Steve seemed so insistent that he reluctantly gave in. “I saw people… dying,” Bucky replied hesitantly. “I think… I think I was… killing them.” He glanced up at Steve, his eyes dark and haunted. “But… I couldn’t have… I don’t remember ever hurting anyone.”
Coulson waved them ahead. "I've got the paperwork. You two get out of here before someone notices."
Tony drank the issue down gladly, then wiped his mouth on the back of his hand. He grinned up at Steve, "Couldn't've said it better myself." Standing, he pressed against the blonde, helping him stay on his feet and leaning up to press their lips together. "Feels fucking good to hear you call out for me like that. You're beautiful when you cum." He grinned and nipped at Steve's lip, then ground the aching bulge in his pants against his partner's thigh. "Of course, I think you made me a promise earlier."
"Jarvis, why did I program you to make recommendations? You know I won't listen."
Logan quietly wondered to himself if Tony ever actually shut up, but decided the visuals he was getting more than made up for the chatter. "Do it," he urged, his voice a rough growl in Steve's ear. Logan had his own plans for Steve, but discussion of that could wait.
"Much appreciated, Dr. McCoy," Steve agreed, gritting his teeth as he rose to his knees and tossed his shield toward Pyro, who was steadily advancing on Bobby again. The Brotherhood was definitely dangerous. Steve was beginning to think he didn't care much for Loki's new friends. Speaking of which... He tensed at the sight of Loki squaring off with Clint and Coulson. "Beast, keep our lady friend occupied." He hated to leave the man who'd sprung to his rescue, but Loki was a lot more of a wildcard than even the mutants.
"C'mon. Before we all lose patience and strip down naked. I think the good Director might have some bones to pick if I 'defile' his car again," Tony said with a faint smirk.
Darien tensed immediately when the woman touched Clint. It was a strange situation to be in. He knew that Clint wasn't invested, not really, wasn't interested in more than a good fuck. When the striking redhead pulled away, he didn't see a great deal more affection there, which made him wonder just what or who Clint really was interested in. "I don't do girls. Just for the record."
"No one is." Coulson moved to the next shelf in line and began scanning the contents. "Some of it's here because it's potentially too dangerous to even test out. The rest has been tested and deemed... inadvisable for use."
Though he'd felt bad at the idea of pushing the man out of a public space, Steve was visibly relieved to have Darien gone. "Tony had some files on Logan, stuff that went back to SHIELD's founding days. Turns out Logan moved an artifact back in the day, some hammer that's like an evil version of Thor's. He didn't know where, said somewhere cold... it's not a lot to go on," Steve admitted with a sigh. He leaned back against the counter with his arms crossed. "I was thinking maybe we shouldn't go this alone. Maybe we should reach out to the X-Men. They know the people we're going up against."
Coulson gazed mildly at Tony until the silence became slightly uncomfortable. "It might be better if Captain Rogers handled this alone."
The quiet confession was harder to hear than the yelling, and Steve tried to find the right words to ease the situation. The truth was that Bucky had a point. If things had happened a different way and at a different time, his own reactions would have been entirely different. He’d spent half his youth being in love with Bucky without ever realizing it. But things were different. Despite Tony cutting him off entirely, Steve cared more than he really knew how to express. “It isn’t fair. This whole thing,” Steve agreed with a sigh. “It’s not fair to you or to me or to Tony. It isn’t, and… I’m not helping. Not the way you need me to.” He glanced around the room, at the boxes still littering the space. “I thought things could go back to being the way they were - just us being roomies and looking out for each other, and that was stupid. It’s a different time and a different place. Nothing’s the same. I’m sorry. I… I should get my stuff, get back to my old room. I’m making it worse right now, and that’s the last thing I want to do.”
"I'd have to say that is one of the least lame stories there are to explain it," Clint agreed, his hand tugging the rest of the buttons loose after gaining open permission. He slid his thumb along Phil's collarbone before finally gently tracing the scar with his fingers. "Matter of fact, I hear it's right up there with shark bite scars for getting you laid."
Fury shook his head in immediate negation. "He's also here for more than just babysitting the Avengers. No."
Phil knew it was silly to be huddled so closely together when they were already baking, but he didn't want to let go. He needed to hold fast to Clint and feel the steady beat of the man's heart. It made their escape feel more real. Much as Phil wanted to murmur a million different things he'd be embarrassed about later, he settled for silence and feeling Clint against him and knowing that somehow, when they woke up, they were going to get home and be just fine.
The woman smirked. "You say that like I'm above such things."
The words sounded true but they didn't feel that way. Nat squeezed her eyes shut and tried to feel nothing but Clint's touch. "I will,"she agreed before opening her eyes. "Go. Talk to Coulson alone. Make him believe you. Tell him that I said. We can't let Loki in here. He could tear us apart, and he will if he has a chance."
"I've heard some nutty stuff about what these people can do," Clint said, sobering a little. He had to remember that they weren't necessarily wandering into friendly territory. "I mean, not that our bunch doesn't already do some crazy stuff, but... I hear they have a guy made of metal. And not in the Tony Stark sense. Just not getting turned inside-out would be great. Then I'll worry about the being listened to part." He paused. "Maybe you should knock on the door, and I can cover you from a distance."
Clad in a simple white shirt and skintight black jeans, Natasha smiled at the group as a whole. "We're awfully pretty."
It bothered Coulson to realize that the fact Steve couldn't breathe *wasn't* the thing weighing most heavily on his physician. He swallowed hard. "And?"
//To be fair, my dear, I wouldn't expect him to.// The fact that no one had yet seen Erik was troubling. He could be working with Loki, or he could be somehow in the man's thrall. Through everything, the idea of him being taken from even himself was troubling. It struck at Xavier's core, and he reluctantly allowed, "I will share partial files. What I believe you need. If any of the X-Men want to assist you with future missions, they will have that opportunity. Jean and I will speak with the team. If anyone agrees to join you for the excursion, I will contact you immediately. Is that acceptable, Agent Coulson?"
The small exchange almost made Steve smile - at least until he considered what it might mean. He hadn't been able to access the full report of what had happened while Phil and Clint were held captive, and he'd found that more than slightly troubling. Coupling that with Natasha's sudden protectiveness left him wondering just how bad it really was.
Steve couldn't help but smile at the visual. He even managed to bite back any scolding about Tony being careless with his fresh stitches. Instead he stripped down to his boxers and happily curled up next to the man. //Maybe things aren't going to be as complicated as I thought.//
“So why cooking?” Tony asked as Steve poured them each a glass of wine.
“Sounds good. Iron Man?” Steve looked to Tony for approval.
Tony laughed, and took Steve’s hand. “Okay, but Steve, don’t you see? I have feelings for you, you have feelings for me. None of that past awkwardness matters now.”
He pulled the shield over his face and let the ring pulse. He felt the ring get warm, and clicked the trigger. A big pulse of energy fired upward, hitting the interior of the tank and BOOM. The tank exploded in half on top of Steve, as he curled up further under his shield as pieces began to rain back down.
Tony had learned to push his feelings down. Steve was nice, but sometimes just seemed so distant, quiet. Not eager to upset the team dynamic by confessing his feelings for someone that didn’t seem interested, Tony was more than willing to keep his mouth shut.
Feeling a bit lonely, Steve finally forced himself out of his room to go seek some company. Yeah, most of the team was gone, but someone else had to be in this big tower, right?
“Uh, no. I haven’t been on a date recently or . . . at all, really. Nothing since I got pulled out of the ice,” Steve confessed.
an improvement - it truly was better to vent to Jan and Rhodey about how much he truly liked Steve. Better than the year or so of vehement denial where Tony refused to even admit he had feelings for Steve, and a million times better than before he had confided to them that he was into guys at all.
About ten minutes later, Steve and Kate arrived back at the security gate.
“If he was he would have just asked me out to begin with. That’s what he usually does, right?”
And after a moment, a second text
“I’m ready, Tony. I’ve been ready. I’ll be fine, you’ll be fine, and I know you’ve been taking this slow to protect me - don’t deny it - but we’re gonna be okay, and we’re gonna go to a gala together and eat fancy foods and I’m gonna talk your ear off about the works we see and it’s gonna be a great night.” Steve smiled and leaned over to kiss Tony, cupping his cheek with one hand.
“Can someone go tell my team I’m awake right now?”
much fun. I’m not trying to spend this weekend writing incident reports for Director Fury.” Steve smiled softly and looked back ahead, as Tony felt his stomach do a small flip.
“Just a feeling. Could tell your mind’s going a mile a minute. Is something going on?”
“Because I knew you were anxious about it. How we’d be received. How I’d handle it. You care, and you protect people as much as you can. It’s one of the things I love about you.”
“I was bit, I guess.”
Steve was complaining that he was a terrible cook. He would try to follow recipes but he needed to get techniques down first. So I told him to watch cooking shows on TV and videos on YouTube. And this has been going on all weekend.”
“With words, Tony. ‘Steve, I like you. Can I take you out for a night?’ How hard is that?”
“You absolutely don’t need to apologize, Tony. You’re still helping as much as you can and I really don’t mind doing the manual work.” Both of those things were true - as temporarily restricted as Tony was, when Steve would encounter a problem he would bring it to Tony who usually had a quick fix without even needing to look at a computer screen for it. And in the meantime, Steve enjoyed learning how to solder and wire and use new tools. After a few days of building armor, Steve realized why Tony liked doing this so much.
“I’m sorry, Tony. I guess I was so excited at the thought of spending time with you I didn’t realize you were actually asking me out,” Steve said as he could feel all the blood in his body rushing up to his face.
“And then what?”
Steve had no idea what to make of that. “Not only do I not mind it, I’m happy you’re here. I -“
Steve grabbed his coat and rushed out of the club and into the chilly night air before Sam or Bucky could stop him. He quickly walked back to his room, and slammed his door behind him, sliding down and sitting on the floor.
“On your six, Cap,” Hulkling said, spiking two agents into the ground.
“Tsum tsum tsum tsum!”
“Uh, thanks,” Steve said. Over the past several months, Steve couldn’t help but notice Tony’s flirtatious comments. And because he had liked Tony so much, Steve never knew how to handle it. Tony also had a reputation of flirting with most people, even if he didn’t intend to do so. But just a small smile from Tony would make Steve’s stomach do flips, so how could he properly judge what was casual flirting and what was something more?
“Steve? You with me?”
Tony could see Steve studying him out of the corner of his eye.
“After I told you I hadn’t dated anyone since getting out of the ice.”
Tony was still quiet. Steve knew this wasn’t the concussion - he had seen Tony talking normally with Jan and Rhodey just the other day - so it was clear something was off.
“Steve, wait, I can’t tell where any of the enemy are, or who they are -”
Tony skipped over confusion and went straight to anger. “What the hell -
“Tsum tsum sum tsum!”
“What’s wrong with him?” Loki asked to Jan, pointing at Tony.
“Is this . . . is this about America Man?”
Tony groaned loudly. The worst part was, this actually
“I’d like that,” Tony replied, sitting up in bed. His usually neat hair all tousled and sticking up from being pressed into the bed. Steve chuckled.
“Steve, I’m so sorry. I should have spoken up. I love you and I never wanted you to get hurt."
“Steve, where did you go? I don’t have a visual on you,” Tony said, as he continued to dodge missiles and shots from the tank.
Once they got on the ice, Tony held Steve’s hand as they joined the crowd skating around the rink to the music. They laughed, almost slipped several times, and made so many laps around the rink they lost count.
, Steve thought. “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe I just haven’t made the connection with the right person yet?” Steve proposed.
“Thank you all. I know, I know I have to slow down sometimes. But it’s hard to want to stop when there’s so many ways we can help people, you know?”
” Tony let off a hard sneeze that almost took his breath away. “Okay, maybe yes to the water and to a doctor. I’m sure it’s nothing though.”
Tony smiled. “Steve, if you were so ready to make our relationship more public, why didn’t you say anything earlier?”
Tony didn’t stay much longer. Steve felt bad; it was clear to him that the sight of his injury must have shaken Tony up pretty bad. He knew Tony had seen a lot of terrible things in his lifetime - but it still couldn’t have been easy to see a teammate get hurt. He felt a pang of guilt - he and Tony had a bit of a complex relationship. They hadn’t seen eye to eye when they first met, but Steve was glad to be wrong about his initial impression of Tony. Though they sometimes disagreed, Steve cared about Tony. He was caring, funny, and compassionate; they had different personalities but under Tony’s sarcastic remarks, his handsome smirks, and his showy lifestyle there was a realistic man who knew he could help others, and felt the responsibility to do so. Steve respected that, and like with the rest of the team he wanted to continue to build that bond with Tony. He hoped that this incident wouldn’t cause Tony to pull away.
Steve jumped in surprise to see Tony standing behind him. He hadn’t heard Tony enter the room - unsurprisingly, a cat hybrid like Tony would have the reflexes of one. Steve knew the rainy days suited Tony perfectly - content to hang out in a cozy lab, snuggled up next to warm machinery as he worked on suits. Tony was standing by the kitchen counter, starting to prepare a warm beverage for himself. Steve watched as Tony’s black, fluffy but luxurious tail lazily flicked back and forth, narrowly missing the cups and coffee maker on the other counter behind him.
Steve looked around. The dotted lights across a sleepy campus gave off faint glows. What was usually a bustling school was quiet, peaceful. Between the few remaining lights and the height of Stark Tower, Steve could see many stars across the night sky. “Wow. I never realized how beautiful the view is up here at night.”
But then they found Tony. And now they were home. But being home didn’t prevent Steve from feeling uneasy, from fearing that Tony, as well as the others, would be ripped away from him again at any moment. Steve had yet to confess his true feelings for Tony because it almost felt like it was tempting fate. And he knew that the unease wasn’t just felt by him.
The creature fit right into the palm of his hand, and while Tony was still a bit nervous the creature seemed perfectly content.
Oh god. You’re right. It’s official. Let the registrar know. I’m going to go by ‘the Awkward Nightmare’ from now on.”
Steve had drafted their pitch for the project. “
“Thanks. You’re so good to me, Steve.”
’ As in, implying that everyone you currently know isn’t the right person.”
“Yeah. While I didn’t realize you had feelings for me, it was pretty obvious you did care and that you were shaken up. Deep down I didn’t want to jeopardize that.”
“So what happened out there?”
“You don’t have to, Tony, we’ve shared a bed before. And this one’s massive.” Steve surprised himself with how confidently he had just asked Tony to share a room with him. And before Tony could retort, Steve took both their bags and brought them into the bedroom. Tony didn’t seem to argue about it, so Steve considered the matter resolved.
Tony chuckled lightly. “No need to apologize, Steve. I could have been more clear. I figured I’d ask, and since we’re already teammates and live together, and that’s pretty intense for two people just starting out, we could just start slow. So I thought a low-pressure date around a holiday market would be better than a one-on-one intimate dinner at a fancy restaurant. But I really should have just said that.”
