“Mycroft will take care of that and you’ll be allowed in tomorrow.” Greg tried to reason with him.
“I love you.” He breathed out softly and their lips met just brushing together softly. The world stopping for the two were one.
"Screw my record. Why isn't there anything!" Sherlock slams his hand against the desk as the search comes up clean again. "They must have been changed I need access to your physical files."
Calling John from on top of Barts the emotion he hated in his voice, trying so hard not to convey it to John but use it to comb him of his lies. He was the worst friend to ever walk the face of the earth. He regretted every second of it.
When he slept, he slipped back into the past. He’d have nightmares often in the snippets of sleep he got in the early hours of the morning. Once he had a dream that they were back at baker street and Sherlock was telling him about his day and John would smile and just stare. He’d watched how gorgeous he looked in the sunlight and how passionate he sounded about whatever it was he talking about. It didn’t even matter, it mattered that he was there and safe and entirely happy. Then John woke up and Sherlock was still in the bed and that was worse than the nightmares.
“What is it?” Sherlock asks annoyed that he didn’t know why she was so smug.
After a few minutes of silence Sherlock sighed and rubbed his hands over his face, scrubbing at his eyes.
It was cold and suddenly the lights got very bright, very quickly. His eyes burned with the sudden change and he blinked quickly, a sort of ringing filling his ears shortly after something powering up in the distance he couldn't see. He turned sharply as he heard a voice, although his senses were impaired he knew who it was immediately.
"I have to get to an interview, thank you so much." John started to walk to the door before he suddenly turned around. "Oh, I almost forgot. Just as a thank you um I could tell Molly is a bit of a fan." John looked pointedly to the wall where John's most recent album sat on a shelf along with two posters and three little figurines. "So I thought I'd offer tickets to my concert next week, there front row. If you don't want to that totally fine but it'd be nice to see someone familiar."
“...Alright.” Sherlock caves uncertainly but hopefully this will be for the best. “You really can’t tell anyone before I talk to him though, okay?”
Sherlock made it to his room but before going in wen to check on John and Lestrade. He peeked through the window at the top of John's door peering through the darkness the only light John's small night light that lit the ceiling. Lestrade was sitting up on the bed against the headrest with John asleep on his hip, he was idly running his fingers through Johns hair while his eyes were closed head turned up towards the ceiling, they both had content smiles.
“Probably yes.” Sherlock stands stretching a bit as he stands. “I’m going to grab that file I stole from Lestrade.”
“Do you honestly think that?” He sneered, falling back into his cold mask which he observed bodies and chased killers with, John had never witnessed something so terrifyingly empty from his new friend. John was so taken aback he almost took a step back before he realized Sherlock was the reason he was still standing.
“None of us do. We’ll get him. It’ll be okay.” The words weren't out of his mouth before a piercing screech broke the silence and they both went to cover their ears turning towards the building where the noise had come from. The door opened a moment later and a man emerged unfamiliar to both the men by the cars and every gun was pointed to him instantly.
The world seems to be spinning as if in a washing machine. Round and round it goes. Slowly but surely pulling itself apart. Pulling thread by thread until it comes unraveled, taking all the information he knew with it.
He didn’t think about it until this happened but this was it, the last of the pips, the hardest one of them all and it was a jibe at Sherlocks only weak spot that a lot of times was more strength than weakness. His heart.
“Don’t!” He shouted and pressed the gun to Sherlocks forehead. “You don’t get to convince me.. you’ve run out of chances.”
“I told you already.” He laughed, a carefree laugh with a light smile playing about his lips.
John wasn’t here actually, of course he wasn’t. Sherlock had jumped off a roof and left him two years ago in London, never to see him again. John was lost and Sherlock felt it flood him as he stepped closer to him.
“You do. I know it’s difficult and doesn’t make any sense but you really have to. I promise I’ll be right there when you wake up.” Sherlock says hoping that even though he was younger his sense of reason was still intact and he would do so without much more of a fuss.
“Christmas, a brilliant Christmas that is.” John replied taking his glass up.
"Ex-wife?" Sherlock questioned, curiously.
"Boyfriend." Sherlock says extending his hand and she chuckles a bit nervously shaking it. John blushes and pinches Sherlock's leg as but he ignores it as she introduces herself and shakes his hand before letting go.
He didn’t recall what had transpired to get him to this point but for a moment he wondered if he had died. Enveloped in some sort of afterlife he never believed in, if it were that he was dead he certainly didn’t belong in an afterlife of any sort. Curious now to what had become him, he attempted to open his eyes although when he did nothing greeted him but more white.
“Exactly. You have to live John, and not from behind the glass of my hospital room while your stuck to a bed.” Sherlock knew he already would cave and go anyway but he had to prove his point. He’s been stuck in that bed for god knows how long. He needs to see the world for himself.
“Yes while you were at the clinic each day I worked on it. I dug out some of the old engraving as well from the top.” Sherlock said as John flipped it to get a better look.
Sherlock woke up startled by the beeping sound around him, looking around widley as he realized he was in a different environment than what he remembered. Less gracefully arised from sleep than pulled from it suddenly.
Greg gasped, coughing and convulsing in a desperate attempt to bring in the forever fleeting air. Aching to have clean air. Whatever had been pumped into the room with mysterious puffs of steam was slowly taking away the air he had, some sort of poison or sedative. He couldn’t think very well to know for sure.
“Definitely, I can’t stand her.” Sherlock replied moving to walk by his side as they made their way slowly down the hall.
“No that sounds familiar.”
“That’s good to know.” John murmured quietly, they stood in the hall in silence after that. It was a comfortable silence the kind people are almost afraid to break surrounded in the peace of it. “The dark.”
"Yes that's because you starve yourself and then scarf down those pills, which are not actually doing anything but slowly shutting you down." Sherlock jumped up from his bed and grabbed his coat and scarf. "If you intend to poison yourself Molly don't do it around me, it's rather addictive and I like to get hooked." He slammed the door shut on a very confused Molly.
“Alright, we’ll go together.”
“Sebastian Moran.” Lestrade said finally catching on and Sherlock nods approvingly.
“You’ll get out soon, both of you. This was a setback but it will make you stronger.” Greg affirmed for him as he sat, Johns legs on his lap massaging them to try and get the muscles to stimulate into working correctly.
"Yeah well you're the one that got me to buy you a whole new wardrobe last week." John tried to put blame on Sherlock but his smile ruined it.
John carefully pushed himself up off the ground and on shaky legs moved to a crouching position. He looked around the room carefully trying to find the fastest way out ignoring the pounding of his heart.
“Sherlock.. no, no.” John said in horror under his breath as he drops to his knees beside him not able to hold himself up, landing right into the pool of blood that starts to flow from Sherlocks wounds.
It didn’t take long for him to arrive at the power plant, knowing the streets of London better than any cabbie in the city he made it there faster than anyone else could have by car. So while it didn’t take long to get there the seconds between not being with John and not knowing he was safe was terrifying. Every second meant a second he could have lost John.
“Why not? Don’t you want to see them?” John questioned confused as to why someone wouldn't want to see their parents on Christmas.
"Well, didn't we-" John tried to say and Molly just shook her head."Damn it."
Sherlock watched the car go numbly from the sidewalk unsure what he was supposed to be feeling, it was easier not to know, to step back and turn around before the car was even out of sight and go back inside the flat with a renewed purpose. To bring John Watson back.
“I’m serious I’ll be fine. Plus I’ve got Sherlock.” They smiled at each other for a moment before looking back to see she had a smug look on her face.
"I think so." John replied taking a breath before stepping forward Sherlock walking beside him as Greg follows behind.
“So humble.” Lestrade said as he looked through the window. “He’s sleeping maybe we should just-“
He gasped, his body falling to pieces and vision blurring. He knew it wasn’t what he was thinking but it felt like his insides were falling out of him, scraping across the floor.
"I was gone for like ten minutes, what happened?" She asked curiously coming to sit in front of his oddly still form.
“Nah it’s alright that was so many years ago.” He shrugged. “I’ve had time to get over it and people to help me. Sure I still miss him and think about him some days but I still have many people who will help me on those days, one of them being the British government.”
“Yes. Don’t strain yourself. He’ll be fine, he's just resting for now which you should do too.”
"What would we do? You know, if your plan works?"
“You researched me?”
I sincerely apologize for not posting for so long! I got this new app Animo and it’s very addictive! Anyway I hope you enjoy this long overdue chapter!
“Sherlock, stop!” John called out, pushing himself away from the door and sprinting towards him but it was too late.
John shook his head looking down at the small box turning it over in his hands gently before removing the ribbon around it and lifting the top.
That's all that matters, they were completed with each other.
“Don’t. Don't start with me. You left.” John said in the harshest tone Sherlock had ever heard and he felt tears prickling the back of his eyes.
“But-“ John tried to protest standing up but got pushed down halfway there.
“Sod off.”
”And I told you to call.” Mycroft replies coolly watching in amusement as John squeales quietly and gracelessly stumbling off of Sherlock to hide behind him. “Oh he’s afraid of me, how quaint.”
Their breathing was ragged as they rushed through hall after hall searching for a way of escape.
"Why?" John wines to himself feeling humiliated and yet angry at Sherlock. Of course he had to pick today to be a jerk.
"How do you mean?" Sherlock asked suspiciously.
Winter slowly got more and more frustrating, time spent indoors was awful. But time spent outside was just as awful with John all jumpy by his side. If they did go outside it was spent in a tree- one of John's favorite activities -or on John's balcony with his guitar and Sherlock's violin. The days seemed to be stretching out as Christmas draws closer and with each passing day Sherlock becomes more antsy.
“No but Mycroft showed me pictures and told me stories. He sounded like a right terror to me. I saw him once on graduation but I didn’t meet him officially until I became a detective lieutenant. Christ he was an arse.” They both laughed the mood lighter now. When the laughter died down John became sollom.
The cuts on his back grinding into linoleum, dirt and rocks digging into the cuts all over him. He tried to turn back over clawing at the ground to try and find something to hold onto. To pull himself up.
“You’re afraid of Mycroft.” Sherlock states watching John with a critical eye. John just shrugs picking at the large jumper he was wearing. “Why?”
“Not yet. Be here much longer with these people, who knows. You’re already slipping.”
"Yeah.." A tragedy indeed, to only have control over your own body when your mind sees fit, is unimaginable. He'd have to ask Lestrade if he could get his file maybe this could be a cold case, maybe he could help John.
The scream.
Sherlock and John sat together in the back of an ambulance shock blankets around both of their shoulders. Their hands intertwined between them as John sat still with a face devoid of emotion. Sherlock was worried for John but desperately needed to focus on this case for him.
A knock from the wall the music was coming from caused both of them to stop yelling and stare. The music had stopped leaving an eerie silence in its wake till a voice broke down their stillness.
“Sure you will.” He sincerely doubted it.
“Molly Hooper.” “Sherlock Holmes.” They both replied equally as fast and they all chuckled.
“Ah you finally see. Now what’s it for?” James asks rhetorically practically twirling, a dance of his own excitement. Trotting over to the main computer and powering it on, that corner of the room momentarily basked in light.
“Don’t give me that, it’s not true and you know it. Tell me why you really did it.” John said crossing his arms over his chest and glaring at him.
John felt his heart practically jump into his throat at the thought of what Sherlock must be going through. Especially since it seemed they were more than just friends, lovers or perhaps even married. Though neither of them had a ring.
John is younger, again. Much, much younger. He's eight or nine at most though John's always looked small for his age -according to the baby pictures he's seen- so he might be ten or eleven. Sherlock holds him to his chest as he sobs and he thinks about what he's going to do.
“I don’t care.” Jim insisted tired of the endless game they had of being fearful of his father.
"Mrs Carson, I uh-"
After that he sat there looking out the window doing nothing, it was dreadful. John’s door had been closed all day so he figured it was a bad day, then again he never asked. It was odd he wanted to see John again, it’s not like they had some deep conversation or anything, he walked in spoke to himself practically and got caught. But for some unknown reason the feeling remains.
“Boring. They never teach anything interesting.”
“Fourth, actually.” Sherlock corrected instantly as if a reflex, then turned to the voice. “Ah, Lestrade. Impeccable timing as always.” He drawled sarcastically. He looked down taking notice of the briefcase he had dropped.
The man moved to sit on the bed as he took both of John's hands into his own. He kissed them holding them to his lips for comfort, though it only succeeded in bringing back the ache of wishing to remember who this incredible man was. John closed his eyes as he felt tears fall from his cheeks and warm breath into his hands.
Together.
His father clapped a hand on his shoulder and led him to the car. They both got in and drove away while Mrs Holmes stands in the doorway with tears in her eyes.
"Sherlock." John said irritated and afraid, as he stops suddenly causing Sherlock to pull him slightly as he was pulled to stop by John's arm.
"I told you to stay where you were." Sherlock says looking down at the little boy who held just the slightest bit of resemblance to his flatmate. John looked up at him and shrugged before standing, only being able to stand as tall as Sherlock's abdomen and turned then walked back to the living room.
“Fascinating.” Mycroft said studying the picture and Lestrade looked to him incredulously
He hit rock bottom at midnight of the fourteenth day, in a desperate attempt to find the cure before his time was up he started doing anything he could even if it was dangerous to get a reaction. Adding chemicals that shouldn’t be mixed to the complex of John's blood and he thought it might actually work.
“That is what I just said.” Sherlock stated looking at John as if he were stupid.
"I had hoped you wouldn't remember." Sherlock says moving to stand again and head to the kitchen. John stood and followed behind him slowly.
“No. Stop you right there. I don’t need an out, I've only been here one day I can suffer through at least one more then i'll ask. I need a case a specific one.”
“Sorry, mam.” Another voice said somehow familiar though Sherlock just ignored paying more attention to the files. It was probably a boyfriend Molly tended to get them quickly and break up with them even quicker.
"Holy shit Sherlock! This is huge!" A small smile came into his face as Molly's split into a grin.
Yellow smiley faces appeared on the walls, biscuits and tea on the tables, Johns gun in his hand, blood on his forehead, the smell of John’s cologne, his clothes in the corner, the dim flicker of firelight in the hearth, so many words on the top of his tongue and so many other sensations and feelings he couldn’t put words too.
Logically it should be impossible, scientifically it’s feasible though generally at an extremely high risk. This wasn’t simple and was clearly thought out and planned thoroughly, for what purpose Sherlock hadn’t figured out. There were many possible reasons one simply being to incapacitate himself as well as John by doing so but it seemed so simple Sherlock wasn't and couldn't be entirely sure to his reasoning.
“You go.” Sherlock said weakly, gesturing down the hall.
““I know.” He says and sighs placing his hands over his face. Not a lot of people knew it due to her cuddly, cute persona but if you got to know Molly you’d find out she is a control maniac.
“Trust me, you’ll be back out solving cases soon.” She patted his ankle as she picked up some article of clothing from the end of the bed.
“It’s okay, it’s alright.” Sherlock says moving closer to him rubbing John’s arm lightly not entirely sure how to comfort him without John latching onto him and doing what he needed himself. He maneuvered John onto his lap trying not move him too much in case it would hurt him but John didn’t protest simply leaning against him as much as he could in this state.
"I'm sorry." Sherlock as he hobbled over to Johns bed his IV stand the only thing keeping him upright. He sat with a sigh then rubbed his hands over his face. "I was nervous John. I wanted it to go right. So I took them."
A sob wracked John’s frame as his hand fell from the mans face. The man sat there in what seemed to be shock before gathering John in his arms and holding him to his chest murmuring comforting words into his hair. John found the smell, feel and sound of this man so enrapturing and calming he wished he knew if he had discovered these things already. If he had experienced the overwhelming amount of love pouring out of this man.
Inside the room John hides his face in his pillow and brings his arms up to cover his ears. Sherlock just had to keep him up late and now he had to wake him up early as well. He just didn't understand that John had to get a normal amounts of sleep unlike some people.
A bitter laugh broke free from Sherlock, a biting rotten sound that consumed his entire face, twisting into a grim look of determination.
When he moved in with John, when he became attached to John, he’d stolen his dogtags and knew immediately they would be his totem. For nothing else would ever be as strong to him as those are. They pained him now to have and he did feel some gully for stealing them from John but they were necessary.
"I knew it. You fancy him so much it's borderline love."
He took Mrs Hudson’s car -with permission- and started to follow the blinking as best and as quickly as he possibly could. He was worried out of his mind although he refused to acknowledge it, determined to find and return John home.
Sherlock could physically feel his brain short circuit. It was as if time had stopped and he couldn’t move, couldn’t speak, couldn’t think. He tried to rationalize. There had to be multiple Johns at this college it’s a common name. Molly couldn’t possibly have done the impossible. Could she?
“You know you could be a little nicer to him. He’s just trying to help.” Molly said quietly from where she was putting away her clothes by the dresser. Always trying to be the peacemaker.
John was far to shocked to do anything but just stand there as Sherlock snogged the living daylights out of him. Though it did effectively warm him. When Sherlock pulled away he was grinning madly.
As John disappeared Lestrade came inside a bit looking questionably- astonished -at Sherlock. Sherlock looks to him saw he was floundering about like an idiot and looked to his computer scowling. Lestrade got his footing- so to speak -and sat where John was sitting a few moments ago.
“Told you.”
“Yeah it seems like it, according to Mr Genius over here.” John says teasingly as he points to Sherlock with his pencil. Sherlock smiles to himself and continued writing while John goes back to his own page.
“And you were going to eat that blood.” John said exasperatedly rolling his eyes. “Why I brought you, I have no idea. It probably would’ve been easier alone.”
“I think they need it.” They both grinned as they headed out of the building starting to form a plan.”
“You’re on wasted time, Holmes.” Moriarty taunts standing over him with a gleam in his eye, the only emotion he could seem to put in them was malice and hatred, some type of deep destruction of murder. There was nothing else for him. “I think you’d be much more interested, to what's going to happen to dear ol’ Johnny boy once you’re gone.”
“Of course not.” Molly chuckles pushing him teasingly. “I have Jim but this is amazing, I’m so happy for you.”
His phone buzzing brought him out of his head so he arranged the bags he was holding then pulled it from his pocket. Molly was calling that was odd she knew he hated calls must be important.
"It is isn't it. We'll be right in the front and everything." As Molly flipped out Sherlock sat grinning, wondering about what he was going to wear.
That was until he heard a voice he’d know anywhere, John. He could recognize his voice among thousands if he had to, it was stark and clear in his mind. More so than either of the other voices, what worried him was the tone John seemed to have. He seemed to be upset, it was an odd tone he wasn’t sure that he’d ever heard from him before.
“You should have stayed.” Mycroft says as he waves off the security guards and they enter the room.
“I tried, I did-“
Sherlock shakes his head and changed quickly not even caring about Molly watching him then. “Tomorrow.” He says and moves back to his bed climbing into it.
Most of the lights were off except a few select lights where there weren't any doors. John imagined them to be flickering like some horror movies he'd seen, they weren't but he couldn't get the image out of his mind. He shivered to himself and rubbed up and down his arms in an attempt to calm himself. He just succeeded in freaking himself out more when he thought he saw a figure standing down the hall. He blinked and it was gone.
As if summoned by his thoughts, Mycroft was there when he arrived back instead of Mrs Hudson. Mycroft turned to look at him acknowledging his presence but not speaking and John was grateful, he didn’t make an attempt at conversation either, he usually didn’t. He dropped his stuff by the door and settled back into his usual position at Sherlocks bedside.
He grabbed Mycroft's arm and ran with him, Mycroft followed numbly that Greg didn’t succumb to pushing to get him to safety before he lost him too. Something crashed behind them and Greg glanced back briefly to see a car crushed by a piece of machinery from the plant.
John was devastated as well as his sister and father who had loved this woman more than anything. John had expressed that as much as he was devastated he was relieved she was put where he always believed she belonged. They would help her. Harry didn’t share his sentiments and left without a word.
The puzzle was complete and that when John realized it wasn't a puzzle at all but his heart perhaps even his soul. Cracked and broken into pieces with years of pain etched into each piece.
"What, why?" John asks confused with his mouth full.
“No, it’s not about that. He’s not who he says he is.” He says gently sitting down on his own bed across from her, dreading this conversation and wondering if he should wait to talk about this with John.
“I play the violin, have taken music classes, as well as can write music.” Sherlock explains simply then looks at her expectantly.
He tries not to think about it, taking up the clipboard again to keep himself and -more importantly- his brain occupied. His mind was a weapon right now full of poison and knives just waiting for him to touch and create a wound he couldn’t fix. He couldn’t afford that right now.
Time passed slowly, far too slowly for the two as they finished with the food and ate. Both wanting to get this over with and dreading it entirely, after finishing they cleaned up in silence both stuck in their own thoughts.
Sherlock creeped into the room slowly as the door clicked shut behind him. He tried to see into the darkness as his eyes got used to it the only light from the skylight above.
"Hmm?" Sherlock hummed turning around to look into her eyes in their darkened room.
“The fob watch..” John breathed out picking it up gently as if it might shatter in his hands. “I broke this months ago, how did you fix it?” He asked turning the old Victorian style watch in his hands, it was perfectly intact and ticking away as he opened it up.
"It wasn't your fault, you know. It wasn't your responsibility to warn me." John says as thunder rolls outside.
Something shifted in him as he viewed the scene before him, slowly getting out of the car. The firetruck trying to put out the raging far engulfing the car, flames licking nearby police vehicles with the wind. It was producing a great wave of heat amongst the cold of London.
“Must have slipped my mind.” Mycroft says prettily, oblivious.
"Please, Sherlock?" John begged and Sherlock gulped unconsciously. John made him weak, quite literally.
"Right." Greg cleared his throat ignoring everything that tied John to this case to get it done. "Victim is early thirties, Emily Watson deceased 10 years ago stabbed through the abdomen and bled out shortly after, seems to have been preserved. There is a.." Greg clears his throat again and Sherlock looks to him. "A note." Greg hands him a pair of rubber gloves.
“Contrary to popular belief, I do have relationships Sherlock. Albeit nothing close to what you have with John, but relationships nonetheless.” Mycroft replied tightly.
‘I can handle more than you can, remember?’
"Clearly you're smarter than most as you've got the attention of two geniuses." Sherlock smirked a bit.
They weren’t dating. They couldn’t be. Even an idiot could see they weren’t. She wasn’t interested and neither was he. His attention was focused elsewhere. His smile turned much more genuine. Although his inner fangirl was flipping out he played it cool.
A much longer chapter than usual as an apology for the wait, hope you enjoyed!
“From what I remember, and I remember that one well, trust me. It started as a call, just some domestic violence the neighbors heard shouting and called, it was a poor area the house was a trailer in a trailer park, and I was the closest so I called in first. This was six years ago but I still remember it like it was yesterday.” He stopped for a moment to take a shuddering breath, Sherlock waited frozen. “I could hear the yelling from outside as I got out of the car, it was just me as my partner was away on her maternity leave, anyway. When I tried to open the door it was locked so I knocked, everything went eerily silent, it was creepy to hear screams go immediately quite. The door opened to an older man fifty’s or older I’d say, I asked him if I could come in, he asked why and I said cause the neighbors called and he shut the door on me. The yelling started again and I could hear a kid screaming for help but I couldn’t get in, I called for backup the fire department got there first and broke open the door. They helped restrain the man as I looked for the kid,-“ he paused again seeming to choke on his words, Sherlock couldn’t blame him, he already felt like throwing up and he hadn’t even heard it yet. “Oh god, the state I found him in. He was beaten on the ground locked from the outside, in a room in the back. I picked him up and brought him out, by that time an ambulance and more police officers were there so we got him to the hospital. It wasn’t anything that could permanently disable him but the man, who turned out to be his uncle was arrested and the boys parents were killed a year before so I offered to take him in for a while.” He paused again but it didn’t seem like he wanted to continue.
“I bet you twenty pounds he is.”
“You don’t understand.” John choked again trying to get the words out, feeling as if the emotions of someone else were flooding him. Perhaps it was the part of him that could recognize this man. “I-I can’t-“ John tried to breathe but the feeling of his throat slowly closing was taking over him. “I don’t-“
“John..” he started and John raised his gun to him and Sherlock dropped his, it clattering to the floor loudly
“I have this great song idea but I need your help.” John says happily and takes Sherlocks am with his free hand pulling him down the corridor.
Time. Time was something Sherlock didn’t have much of but he needed to stall his inevitable homicide for John to get the police. He didn’t know either of their state but he hoped they were able to get the police.
"What?" Sherlock asked sharply as he turned to look at her.
“You seem happy tonight.” She commented.
Sherlock shakes his head before thinking about Molly a moment and remembering their conversation. “Oh right. We need to tell Molly about Jim.”
"What happens if I disappear?" Came the quiet voice from the couch laced with fear and uncertainty. Sherlock stopped what he was doing and came out into the living room crouching in front of the couch.
(See the end of the chapter for
John is crying before Sherlock takes his first step and he feels himself break into a million pieces at the sounds coming from his small form. Sounds that he caused, he just wanted to help and protect him but right now he wasn’t doing either of those things.
"I hate you." John calls back pettily and Sherlock spins around on his heel smiling softly at Johns retreating figure.
Sherlock sighed lightly dropping the act as fast as it was put on, sliding a hand over his face. “Yes. John, this is going to be the last time I’m going to be able to see you for a while.”
He just blinked at John after his lips stopped moving, John blinked back. He couldn’t reply, Sherlock didn’t want him to anyway. He just liked to talk and have John listen to him, which John was happy to do anyway. Well not so happy right now but he was fine with listening, he liked Sherlock’s voice no matter what it was that he was saying.
“Okay I do but it’s a stupid reason.”
"W-What? Why would I-. I-I don't think of him like that." John cursed himself internally for stuttering.
“What did you do to him?” John asked, Greg was hardly moving and each of the screens were terrifying with the lack of movement.
“What was that..?” John whispered his breathing increasing in fear, anger forgotten entirely he reaches over and takes Sherlock’s hand.
“Sherlock.” John called again with a smile adorning his lips as he took Sherlocks hands in his own, gently moving his fingers over his pale knuckles.
“Don’t say addict. I’m not and never was addicted just occasionally a user. Besides those events are boring and useless, I’m not an addict like all those mind numbingly stupid people.”
John calmed down eventually, his tears turning to pitiful sniffles as he buried his head in Sherlock’s neck, twisting his suit jacket between chubby fingers. John whined quietly in the back of his throat, unhappy, tired and clutching to the only thing familiar to him.
“You know the sappy-crying-all-the-time one. I’m sick of being that one, it’s his turn.”
“She does have a multitude of witch like qualities.” They laughed again a much less controlled fashion. Sherlock found himself laughing more and more lately, smiling as well.
"They never leave notes." Sherlock grumbled as they came upon the scene, snapping the gloves on.
“What are we doing then?” He asked rubbing a hand over his face to try and push away whatever emotion was left over from his earlier outbreak, attempting to be positive for John like he was doing for him.
“Yes you do.”
He went upstairs and grabbed the small black box that held John’s end of the tracker, he could use it to locate John, it would take some time but he believed he’d be able to use it quite effectively. Of course time would be an issue and there was a chance Moriarty had already considered this but it was the only lead he had at the moment and he intended to follow it until he found what was on the other side.
He used the bathroom and washed his hands then his face but when he looked into the mirror the face looking back wasn't the same as the last time he looked. As little as John could remember he knew what his own face looked like and this wasn’t it.
He was slightly taken back by the action he just helped no less touched another person willingly. He never helped anyone let alone touch them in any form so this was a bit of a shock. The boy looked slightly more aware now and was noticing his discomfort, so he tapped his foot lightly to the edge rail of the bed, the shackle and metal bar clanging against each other loudly in the silence.
“Still afraid of me.” James grinned his shining canine teeth visible in the dark room, shaking John to his core.
“Nap time, then?” Sherlock suggests moving his arms to John’s back rubbing it lightly up and down. Despite what people might think Sherlock was rather good with kids he just never put in the effort. He didn’t know everything to do with them but he was good at understanding and getting along with children.
or the way his hands seemed to shake as he laid him down. He didn’t notice these things so his eyes slipped shut peacefully and the world went black.
He stood up with a determined nod to himself and took both of Greg’s hands starting to pull. Dragging him as fast as he could out of the room. He couldn’t go very far, he wasn’t strong, he could hardly pull him at all.
It seemed universe just loved to prove them wrong.
He was walking home from the shops well home was a loose term. Sherlock was living with his parents for a short time until he was shipped off to college. His family wasn’t what you would call stable but that’s another matter altogether.
"It's not that I don't trust him, it's that I don't want any unnecessary injuries." Sherlock said probably thinking a little too drastically but he had to make sure.
“Alright, you already know I’ve done both..” John tells him a bit awkward about it. “Sorry about that by the way.”
“I’m sorry, I want to remember. I really do, I just.. can’t.” John said as he continued to brush through the detectives curls. Sherlock looked up at him tears still in his eyes as he looked at John in determination.
“I’m assuming that is the point of this, for you to remember that fear.”
“Youre kidding?” John asks incredulously at Lestrade tale as he laughs.
A few hours later they were in a cab on their way to the flat. Home, Sherlock kept saying though John could only think of it as ‘the flat’. John sat uncomfortably stiff and slightly drugged up with what the hospital gave him. He could already feel fatigue falling over him.
“Yes, so it seems.”
“No, no. It’s fine.” He really didn’t sound like it.
“I don’t wanna Shewock, pwease.” John begs pitifully clutching Sherlock’s shirt and hiding his face in his neck, tears gathering in his eyes already.
"Nope." She replies popping the p.
“You took the most important person from me-“ James said harshly, any sense of false niceties falling from his feature as he stalked closer and John stood quickly.
“Alright I’m coming.” Sherlock chuckles following him quickly as John rushes through the halls to get back to his room. John grins and starts to run pulling Sherlock along with him as they run through the halls, dodging people as they go.
The little icon in the corner said it was coming on next so they just had to wait. Time went by like sand in an hourglass that’s hole was too small for sand to fall properly through it. Single grains at a time slowly falling in time. Sherlock feels like he’s shaking it willing the glass to open and allow the sand to flow. Then it shatters hitting the ground as the sand pours out the side and Johnathan Watson shows up on the screen.
"Ah, John." He paused a moment to look at his facial expression. "What's wrong?"
“I know, I’m not as stupid as you seem to think. I know how to keep my feet under me.” They moved out of the room Sherlock on Johns left, hand on his hip for support as John held to his shoulders. They walked alone for a while in relative silence, with the exception of the occasional doctor or nurse who seemed to all know John and want to have a conversation. After a while of doing loops Sherlock got bored of doing circles so he started pulling John a different way.
"It was nothing." He replies abashed. Lestrade clasps a hand on his shoulder causing him to look over from John's blond hair.
Perhaps one of those has been permitted with the sound of flatlining. Perhaps they wouldn’t bring him out of his darkness where the memories and thoughts are gone. Perhaps he would be allowed to succumb to the peace, to the sound of silence.
“Yes, I’m serious.” He grins and sits up looking at her excitedly. “I have a boyfriend.”
“I found something for us.” Sherlock called out as he dug around in the kitchen cabinets.
John followed, his face heating up significantly and ignored every person staring in favor of trying to figure out what the hell Sherlock was thinking.
"Yes. Did you enjoy it?" He said casually as if he didn't care either way though the underlying of vulnerability struck John where he didn't think Sherlock could.
“You have no idea.” Sherlock replied astonished and wanting to pass out. They heard a knocking sound coming from Jonathan's side.
“Oh so you’re up to date on slang then are you?” Sherlock teases pocking John’s side with his fingers cause John to squeal softly. “Fine than he’s a bellend.”
Happy Valentines chapter! No fluff and happiness today people, sorry ^-^ Enjoy!
‘Hateful isn’t it?’
Sherlock watched from across the room, he stared at John and John stared back silently. John imagined he was surprised too that Mycroft was being so kind and open with his worried expression. Sherlock didn't show it though. He sat directly across from them in the waiting room, blank faced and still although relaxed in his seat, leaning against the armrest to the right and away from the women sitting beside him and crying silently. Sherlock didn't like emotional people.
“You murdered me.”
John swallowed thickly as the darks of Moriarty’s eyes seemed to take over the rest of them. James used to have some sort of compassion in him, for one person. Sebastian seemed to make him human but now without him.
How long can he run, Away from the fun,
"What do you-" John cleared his throat when his voice broke off. "What do you think happened?"
The clock hits tens, And then it all ends.
The door opens and as Sherlock steps through John stands about to ask him where he went but when two other men follow him into the office he takes a step back.
“I had them set up in the spare room.” Mycroft says simply moving his gaze away from the doorway and back to the two across from him.
"You're always bossing me around John." Sherlock teases trying to lighten the mood and John puffs out his chest as he stands up.
Sherlock sighed and after a moment gave in moving towards the car with John not able to deny him anything. "Fine but I'm not responsible if you get hurt." He warned pointing a finger at Greg.
“Don’t you realize?!” She screamed jumping up and running to sit next to him on the bed then stared at the wall. “That is Johnathan Watson’s song ‘Pretender’!”
“Sherlock!” He heard John call from the bathroom, seeming frantic. Sherlock dropped the clothes and quickly rushed to the bathroom door just as John opened it. Sherlock felt his jaw drop open as he looked at John who stared at himself in the mirror before turning to him.
"You okay?" John asked taken aback when Sherlock just groaned and fell back on the bed.
“It would be much better for both of them to admit it though.”
"Okay, so maybe I don't know anything but maybe his mother would." John suggests almost insecurely.
"Mrs Hudson." John coughed a bit and looked over to see her pick things up around the fireplace. "What do you mean, 'finally'?"
“We’re both men.” Mycroft points out.
"Moriarty, the criminal we were facing. He kidnapped you that's how you got your amnesia, he must have done this in that time as well." He said as if the admittance pained him. John still didn't understand what their relationship was but he assumed it was very close by the way he was acting.
The last thing he remembered was being wrong.
"I was afraid. Afraid I would mess this up, evidently I did more harm than good." Sherlock took a moment then looked over to John who had his eyes on the floor. "I let fear control me and I will never do that again. I want to stay by your side John, no matter what. Please let me."
“Shhh keep your voice down.”
“Your grandmother would be proud.” Sherlock’s grandmother had died a police woman and even though Sherlock's mother was terrified of it happening again, she knew he had to do this.
“His hand will probably linger on his butt.” It didn’t and John gave the man a pat on the shoulder they laughed then continued playing. Sherlock looked to Molly smugly.
They were at a crime scene, although that was nothing new. Sherlock was running around like a madman going off about body parts or something. Someone- Katey?-laid dead from something John tried not to pay attention, it was far too early for this.- All he knew was that the last name was Landers.- Lestrade was yelling at Sherlock half heartedly but he was just as tired.
They rushed, tripping over their own feet and sliding in crimson liquid.
"Sherlock, can you go get more ice from the school?" Molly asked later into the day when it was slowly getting colder out and yet there food was getting warmer until it melted. the school was selling ice for a dollar a bag and coolers as well but they already had one.
The day he met John, in Barts he would look over to him in the door and see the way his eyes scanned the room and landed on him. A curious sort of fascination behind his eyelids, some confusion and awe as Sherlock spoke to him. He was never angry, he was always so proud and amazed with Sherlock's deductions.
"Perhaps you should do the album." Sherlock suggests before popping the chip into his mouth.
"You are getting younger, I want to know why. The answer might be in your blood and perhaps even a cure." He says already putting a bit on blood on a slide and putting it under his microscope.
Johns screams and cries, trying to get out of Sherlock’s arms as if knowing what was going to happen. He squeezes John gently as they enter the upstairs bedroom fearful for him and how this would go. The room is almost unrecognizable with all the people and equipment everywhere as they enter and the doctor gets John set up.
Like a little family they all needed each other even if they all denied it. There would be fights and disagreements silly arguments and squabbles but like any family they will pull through.
“No, no. Of course not. It’s just to keep you safe, that’s all. You’ll come back here soon, okay?”
Sherlock had to make sure there weren’t many people in the halls to put his plans into action. He slipped out and walked over towards the elevator nodding at the random passerbyers. His bare feet hit the ground with a light smacking noise filling the quiet halls. The sound of the nurses cane around the corner so Sherlock quickly found a wall to hide behind. Sure enough Mrs Hudson and Mrs Carson were among them talking profusely, one look from them and he’d be sent back.
Sherlock slinked back into the flat building quietly. He climbed the seventeen steps taking them unusually one at a time, the process much more agitating than what he’d remembered. He stood at the doorway to the flat and stared at the dull flat blankly for a moment.
“Just silently exploding but yeah I’m great.” Is how she replies in a odd tone and promptly stands, goes to her bed, falls onto it and screams into her pillow in what Sherlock hopes is joy.
The presence of John Watson was one that would make or break his brother. For better or for worse though he would be there.
“Oh just a little something in the air vents, suffocation is imminent, Johnny. The question is, which will you save?” James asked with this bloodthirsty smile that turned John's stomach.
Three words the real John would never tell him. It had been years of being together and just those words broke everything. He didn’t know how to cope. Their world started crumbling, crime scenes and shops falling apart. Streets of London folding in on themselves. Just three words.
“You’re just going to leave me?” His voice was harsher and Sherlock felt his throat tighten as he swung his legs out of the window.
Sherlocks teeth clenched and John held onto his hand soothing him in what little way he could. The blood loss was immense and he wasn’t even able to defend himself let alone John. There wasn’t anything he could do.
"Stressful day?" He asks in mock sympathy moving over to the window to watch the alleyway idly.
There was a ringing in his ears as he ran but it might as well have been in slow motion as the red string flowed to the ground. Pictures fluttering to the cement as the knives in the ceiling holding each picture up, dropped. Simultaneously they fall to the ground and the silence before they reach their target is terrifying with only John's hurried footsteps to mark how long had passed.
It opened it with a loud screech and the silence surrounded him. The echoes down the dark hall faded quickly and the silence blanketed his senses, for a long moment he remained imobile. Until he heard the most terrifying noise he had ever heard, it turned his stomach inside out and cut it in two in a way he could only explain as sickening. Words failed to explain the scream of his lover that came and echoed seemingly for ages through the hall he could see.
"You.. want to go out with me..?" John was stunned in the moment Sherlock was a perfect being in every way and John was just a person. He couldn't even compete with Sherlock and just the thought of Sherlock even being interested in him was laughable.
“You interest me.” Sherlock thought for a moment trying to phrase this next part as John peered over at him. “You’ve changed me.” He looks over at John as well. “I’m not this nice, I’m not this stupid or mundane. I'm not this person."
"Definitely not. I-I don't even know what I'm supposed to think right now." John sighed sinking into the mattress beside Sherlock their shoulders almost touching. "Why, Sherlock? Why would you do that?" John whispered into the silence.
They stood in front looking at the building and silently Sherlock takes John's hand. "Ready?" He asked quietly.
Sherlock felt it was over, he tried to move to get away but it wasn’t working. He presses his forehead to the floor, hating every bone in his body that refused to move. He never told John he loved him back, he’d die here without him ever knowing that.
“He’s here.”
“Who?” Sherlock snips half heartedly only hearing a sigh on the other end as he leans against the window. John always hated it when he did that.
"You are the most infuriating arsehole." John said angrily as they walked away from the house looking for a cab. It was getting dark and the street lamps were just coming on to light the sidewalks.
"You're as red as those tomatoes." Sherlock muttered under his breath just loud enough for John to hear the satisfaction in his voice. Sherlock kisses John lightly on his check before spinning around to help his aunt.
In a way Sherlock didn’t want to find a way out of whatever reverie he’d found himself in, it seemed blissful after what he could recall experiencing. There didn’t seem to be any reason to leave his soft confines of light, why would he want to anyway.
“What do you think then?” Moriarty asked as he turned around and it should have been a moment of stupid vulnerability but it wasn’t, it was calm collected assurance that Sherlock wouldn’t fire, couldn’t. “Am I all you thought of me to be?”
“And what's that?”
John nods and watches him a while but eventually getting bored and went back to the living room and sat on the couch, thinking.
“BBC News. Just hit number one.” Molly pointed to the number and he quickly pressed it waiting as her slow tv buffered. “I have connections with everyone unlike you and they tell me when there are secret interviews. Your welcome.”
"Someone came to talk to Molly." John said to Sherlocks questioning gaze. "Do you have any idea what happened?" John asked as he sat again across from Sherlock at the desk.
“I need a case.” Is all he said back. There was an audible sigh and groan on the other side then the ruffling of papers.
"I don't need your help." Sherlock said immediately leveling a glare at Greg.
"What?!" John yelled following him around another corner to see Sherlock scrambling up a fire escape. "Oh." John breathed rushing up as well, halfway up the some of the gang showed up pointing their guns at him. Sherlock grabbed his arm and yanked him up the rest of the way, just barely avoiding a bullet and causing the fire escape to flip up and hit one of the guys in the face. John in the back of his mind thought it cheesy and rather comical. Sherlock vaulted onto the roof and John tried as well but couldn't quite make it, being as short as he was.
“Give me a month to find a cure and if I can’t you can take him and do so yourself.” Sherlock says albeit reluctantly not liking the idea of leaving John at all right now in this state but he had to at least guarantee this.
"My mother, she disappeared two or so years ago. It was the strangest thing." John told him as they sat at the desk in Sherlock and Molly's dorm, like a proper investigation. Molly took notes.
“Then walk slower.” Mycroft tried to reason with the aching detective who was holding onto his IV stand like a lifeline. Sherlock gasped as he took a step his insides lurching uncontrollably. “You should have taken the medication.” Mycroft said as he held Sherlock’s hand and elbow that wasn’t on the IV stand.
“I hate sitting idle like this.” John grumbled as he laid on the couch in his room.
The sound of papers ruffling echoed through the dark building, the only break from darkness the cloudy sky light above, opened just a crack. Shaky fingers marked with stains of various substances flitted through files and documents. Dark eyes gleamed in the dim light.
"Read the sign, Sherlock!" John yelled at him, his voice muffled by the pillow to Sherlock but he could still make it out.
There was nothing John could do. John knew he couldn’t fool this man, he knew somehow without actually knowing him that this man could tell if he was lying or acting. He couldn't tell him or remember him so how was he supposed to keep the happy look in his eyes? He wishes he knew something of the man, just to keep him happy.
"What do you mean, what else could it be?" John asks skeptically.
"Why are you is intent on being privy to our private life?" He avoided the question and Lestrade took note of this.
“Roof.” He answered smiling mischievously pulling John quickly again towards the elevator. John looked like he might pass out from worry.
Molly's boyfriend, John's drummer went by the name Jim Moran but Sherlock had a sneaking suspicion that wasn't his name. He searched through everything he could until he came upon what he was looking for.
Sherlock squeezed John's hand lightly watching Johns breathes float in white puffs into the space between them. He dared to look over turning a bit to see what was behind them that had made the noise. If it weren’t for the moonlight he wouldn’t have seen it, the shining blade beneath all the pictures.
“What? Yes?” Sherlock says quickly recovering from his haze of sleep, sitting up and looking to the doctor expectantly.
The puzzle was in place all its pieces laid out in front of him waiting to be placed. Slowly meticulously he created the edges, a shell. Soon to be filled but first it must be cleared.
“Whatever.” Moly made a frustrated noise -quite like Mycrofts but more of a growl- and continued putting clothes away in an angry silence.
"I don't know, I knew him along time ago. Even then I didn't know him."
“I never touched him, it was your father. Seb-“ John started trying to explain.
“W-We can’t leave the hospital. I promised-”
“Sherlock! Sherlock!” He heard her scream at him then practically got thrown over when she ran straight into him and hugged him.
“Got to get to rugby. I’ll see you around.” John never took his eyes off Sherlock even when Molly said goodbye. He only did when his back hit a bookshelf and he ran out with the librarian chasing him down the hallway for knocking over books. Both Molly and Sherlock chuckled at the sight.
The woman hanging was John's mother.
“No, of course not.”
“Yes, sir.” The doctor says with a smile trying to reassure him. “Everything about the procedure is on a clipboard on the nightstand as well as everything we know about after effects.”
The W.A.Y. beeped and the screen turned on, but it was facing away so Sherlock couldn’t see what it said. From the smile on her face he was guessing it was good, John’s face relaxed as he saw her smile.
“Ha ha.” John said sarcastically as he jumped down causing more snow to fall into Sherlock.
"I don't know what to tell you Sherlock. He's just a regular guy like you and me." Lestrade said as he sipped coffee, sitting at his desk.
“How was school?”
"I really do hate repeating myself John but you can go to bed. I need to finish this." Sherlock says as he studies the map in front of him pinned to the wall -with what looks to be a needle-. John leans into his side placing his head on his shoulder and wrapping his arms around his other one.
"Is. She's not dead, I know it."
They drove for what seems like ages during which they explain everything they've figured out so far to Greg. Lapsing into silence after there's nothing left to say the only sound the hum of the engine and tires against the pavement.
“I don’t know if I’ll have so much help after this.” Sherlock choked out past tears that threatened to fall. His mind was poisoning him conjuring up any and every scenario that could happen when he meets with John again. Most of them being of John and Lestrade leaving him one way or another. Mycroft watched it play out on his face, practically desperate to help he leaned forward.
“Yoo hoo.” Mrs Hudson said as she made her way into his room picking up stray items as she goes. He was a natural mess maker to some kind of fault he just seemed to throw things around, his father was the complete opposite always keeping things in order it was probably one of the reasons they never got along well. “How are you doing today dear?”
“You asked if there is anything else you should know, I don’t like the dark. It doesn’t frighten me necessarily just sorta puts me on edge. I’m not exactly sure why. Um..” John thought for a moment before looking up to him grinning slightly. “I’m allergic to strawberries, if that is of any importance.”
“He opened his eyes yesterday.” He said simply, it wasn’t a question more like a confirmation and John nodded silently, he nodded in return. “He’s moved three times since I’ve been here. There’s evidence to suggest that he's progressing from the coma.”
"We will, tell me where you think he is." John shakes his head.
"Didn't he tell you all of this yesterday?" Molly complains again sitting on her bed and wrapping up in a blanket. "It's freezing in here."
“Oh, so you’re dating now?” He asked not actually caring as she practically swooned.
“Sherlock!” Molly yelled coming in through the door. It banged off the wall and broke through the silence of the library.
“What happened?” He asked slowly, cautiously. He heard Lestrade sigh again and start typing while he spoke.
He wouldn't figure out Sherlock had been to every single one of his concerts he could get a ticket to.
“Are you Johnathan Watson?”Molly asked in an out of breath completely in shock tone.
"Yes, and I intend to keep all of them including this one." Sherlock reassured taking John's hands into his own and looking into his deep blue eyes. "So, will you go out with me?" John chuckled a bit at how it was like a marriage proposal and Sherlock smiled wirily getting the oddity of it. "You know what I mean."
“No, not here but we could go across the street they have pretty good coffee there.” Greg offered shoving his hands in his pockets.
John didn’t know what was about to happen in the morning, he didn’t deserve it. He didn’t deserve any of this, Sherlock just couldn’t protect him and it dissolved his very soul.
“How do you come up with this so quickly?” Sherlock asks as he reads over it briefly smiling at the lyrics.
“I don’t see why they shouldn’t, they’d certainly get more customers. Unfortunately, I nicked it off one of the stupid doctors.”
"I don't care what his name is and how is that magazine helping with your figure Molly? You haven't lost any weight at all."
‘Tick tock goes the clock, Begins Johnny’s shock,
“That’s true your oddly subdued.”
"Silly tradition, there is no real point to it anyway." Sherlock smiled softly at John who giggled a bit at the statement. They looked deep into each other's eyes practically feeling the love pouring from them.
“Fine.”
The screen lit up, security footage coming onto the screen in crisp, vivid colors.
“How are we gonna fix that?” Greg asked as they walked across the sidewalk.
The men exited the car, the ground wet and mushy beneath their feet from rain the days before. It had taken them a long while to arrive at the building, the sun coming down to rest just at the horizon. A dream like haze lay over the whole place, fog coming up out of nowhere to cover the building like a coat.
“Just when I thought you were cool.” Lestrade just hummed uncommitted and inspected the lighter.
John didn't care that his aunt was there he wrapped his arms around his detectives shoulders and pulled him into a hug. Sherlock hugged back almost desperately as if they were the only two people in the room and placed his head atop John's own.
"When I was a child I would have panic attacks often but it has been many years since I have had one." Sherlock spoke just as quite yet dismissively, watching the storm brew outside. The snow slowly piling up on John's balcony as the storm becomes more erratic.
“Two.”
“It’s not that I think he’s harming him.” Sherlock says turning around to look back at him from his place at the end of the hall. “It’s that I don’t trust him to protect John.” Sherlock turned and left.
“Good luck.” Sherlock says patting his arm and moving back to his desk.
He knew Moriarty was one to play dirty -not just in light of recent events- and he wouldn’t be foolish enough to go into this thinking it was safe. Nothing really was safe, not anymore. Everything was to be questioned and nothing left to chance, not with the criminal still active. Not even to mention what he had done already.
Sherlock sat on the ground in front of his door and popped open the pens. He pulled out the ink cartridges and used them to pop the lock. He sat for a few moments fiddling with the lock till it opened with an audible click.
and lighter from his hand. It was all in quick succession and in less than two seconds.
“Fans, I assume?”
"Facts..?"
"Hmm?" Sherlock replied disinterestedly thinking of ways to kill Lestrade and his brother along with Moran. He'd make it look like an accident.
Greg lifted a fist, shaky and weak dropping it against the doors one last time as he could manage. His hand only falling back beside him lifelessly. The sound resonated in the small room, he had only assumed it to be a closet of sorts. Echoing back to his ears over and over like the sound was mocking him. Truly telling him he would not escape this prison alive. For if the sound could not escape, how could he?
Sherlock shook himself to disband his thoughts which seemed to be spiraling downwards before flicking off the light and exiting John’s room then walking the few steps back to his own. He opened the door to his room quietly and closed it gently hoping Molly was asleep and crept into his bed.
“No I’m fine.”
'I find myself truly content, happy and all around feeling whole for the first time in a while. I have a sneaking suspicion as to why.
With the sound of a door slamming the apartment building lapsed into silence. Quiet footsteps slowly made their way down the hall and the stairs. Sherlock sat counting in his head for three minutes before jumping up and heading for the door.
"Of course, dear." She just takes it all in stride. "So head wound they rushed him into surgery ten hours later Terry-Mrs Carson- checked on him and she found out,(Some technical crap the author didn't want to look up or even think is a thing) basically he has been cut off from most of his functions or so his mind thinks."
“Yes, John?” Sherlock asks softly not able to resist the temptation of brushing Johns light bond hair away from his eyes.
"She was well informed, in a poor environment. She hardly had any attachments from what I hear besides your sister, who I guarantee you knows whats been going on and has been keeping in contact with her. As I said simple."
"And that is?"
“So what? So what?! That very well could be him he was coming here and you know it!”
“No, no. I don’t think so.” John said shaking his head though a smile came onto his lips.
When Sherlock woke up again it was late afternoon not yet getting dark but sun just starting to go down. The first thing he did was look over to John; he was watching his window again but this time sitting up on his own, looking much more in control. He only had a breathing mask instead of the tube which was good they could talk and no shackles. Sherlock got up from his bed stretched a bit before going over to John’s doorway tapping it to get his attention. John looked over smiling slightly before removing the mask and setting it beside him.
“Seems like we have a musician in the building. Wonderful.” Sherlock replied sarcastically closing his eyes again.
“Plan..?” He asked instead of anything else as he wearily started the car. In all honesty he was tired of this nonsense. Tired of running around and worrying over the people he cared about, he often considered leaving his career altogether but at the same time it was something he wanted to do. He wouldn’t leave people when there were so few who could do this job like he had.
“You’re not serious..” Sebastian trailed off not understanding what he was saying.
The key is in the name~
“Gregory.” Mycroft acknowledges curtly, stoic.
Mycroft narrows his eyes at him. “Do remember I am not doing this without charge and the payment only grows as I wait.” He eyes him distastefully before turning and exiting the room swiftly, leaving the two alone.
“Stay.”John whispered against his lips and Sherlock smiled freely easily.
“I don’t see why it matters to you so much.” The second it came out of his mouth he wished he didn’t say it. He figured it showed on his face because Lestrade didn’t scream at him then leave. He just closed his eyes took a deep breath then moved the briefcase to the floor and sat beside Sherlock his eyes focused on the door.
"You can't stop us." Sherlock said lifting his chin to appear more threatening. "It's our decision to make."
“Of course, my apologies”
“Nine minutes.” He replied dancing on the edge of a box on the very tips of his nice dress shoes. Well they had been nice anyway.
They arrived at the door and this time Greg goes first, pushing the door open and it creaks on its rusty hinges. He creeps inside looking around for possible traps but the darkness was difficult to see through.
“Whatever shhh.” Molly never took his rudeness personal thankfully and just laughed slightly. They both sat down and leaned it as the television whired on.
“To what then..?” Sherlock asked as he handed John his glass.
"Thank you." John smiles to himself and even though he can't see him, knows Sherlock's is smiling as well.
“Sherlock-“ He could feel Molly falling his shoulder and plastered on a smile as his thoughts continued to conjure things out of his control. “-are you alright?”
They ended up making a lasagna, some old recipe Maggie had lying about Sherlock had picked. John figured it was just ordinary lasagna and he wouldn't like it much.
“Always the irregular, brother mine.” Mycroft says looking at him disapprovingly as he lowers his umbrella from Sherlock's foot. Sherlock just rolls his eyes as Lestrade stands up once again.
"To prove a point." Sherlock says as John gets up throwing John's jacket into his arms.
“What’s happening to me?” John asked looking into Sherlock’s shocked eyes that matched John’s own. John was at least ten years younger looking like a college student and all Sherlock could think of was ‘Shit, now I’ll have to talk to Mycroft.’
“Of course you will.” John stopped.
“You can’t just tell me now?” Molly asks extremely curious now especially to why Sherlock was acting so odd.
In the midst of the silence Sherlock hears his phone ringing he gets up to pull it from his coat. It’s Lestrade, of course it’s Lestrade. The only people that call Sherlock are John, Mycroft and Lestrade. Sherlock hasn’t done anything worth Mycroft’s attention and Johns…incapacitated.
"I'm not entirely sure, I'm not his doctor mind you but from what I hear, he was in an accident, not sure what. But the ladies in the lunchroom seem to think it was a house fire, anyway. Head injury when he came in, you only missed him by a day actually when you were discharged, which reminds me-"
Jim Moran wasn't his name well not officially, he was married to a Sebastian Moran but registered under a different name. His birth name is Jim Moriarty he had been all over the news two years ago. John's competition those few years ago until he went missing, obviously to get a new face and identity. He'll destroy John, from the inside out then steal everything.
“Obviously.” Sherlock replies tersely and stands lifting John with him going out onto the landing and closing the flat door so Mycroft couldn’t hear. He crouches and sets John down placing his hands on his petite shoulders lightly.
"And did she have a job? Provide for you and your family?"
Sherlock turns to John and places the tomatoes on his cutting board then placing his chin on John shoulder from behind. John stands there in shock, embarrassment and a rising amount of anger.
“Sherlock..” John said quietly, putting his hands on the screen as Sherlocks form appeared as if he could help him through the feed. Bleeding out in the middle of the floor in the hallway, his heart hurt seeing him like that and he just wanted to make everything right again.
He didn’t reply, he never had to. Not out loud, not in his head, Sherlock just spoke and he listened and occasionally basked in the feeling of a sliver of his presence. That didn’t help either, pretending he was there when he was just a figment of his imagination, this Sherlock didn’t compare to his own. He wasn’t living. Not just in the physical sense but he had no passion or emotion, at times he’d say things that seemed like they should but there was never anything behind it.
Sherlock gags to himself and as he does so, he remembers that when he used to do so, John would laugh and roll his eyes fondly before kissing his cheek and would call him jealous. As annoying as it was Sherlock finds himself
The knives came crashing to the ground.
“What’re you guys names?” He asked quickly.
Reaching the top of the stairs Sherlock takes a quick breath and turns the doorknob until the door clicks open and he pushes it to see the room inside. John had never looked so small, he was of course nothing older than a toddler but the big empty room in contrast to his small form made him seem smaller.
“Not right now, I have to see if it’s okay for me to bring you. My landlord is a bit strict.” Sebastian said he was uncertain that Jim would even be allowed to stay but he’d try.
“Sherlock, listen-”
“You’ve always been so weak..” he snarled at him, following him until he was backed into a corner. “You couldn’t even stay for me.”
“Yes you do. Come on, tell me.” Molly tries to get it out of him, moving to sit on the edge of his bed just to keep the conversation going. “I won’t judge you or anything you know, just tell me.”
“Good. I’m going to need something a name at least and probably a description of what happened.”
"Got the tomatoes." Sherlock announced coming in from the slider door holding up two shiny red tomatoes.
"Shh." Sherlock says as he takes his left hand in his right. John went silent immediately quickly looking out the window and slouching in his seat a bit. Sherlock smiles smugly to himself as he texts Greg that they're safe and heading to the aunts. Out of the corner of his eyes Sherlock sees John's blush and small smile.
“No, no. He was just examining his form look he’s helping him now.”
"Damn it!" Sherlock does yell now as he rushes from the room.
Sherlock didn't waste any time and actually fell into John's embrace even in a rare chance of seeing behind his mask, John didn't try to look into Sherlock's face to figure out what he was thinking or manipulate him while his defenses were down. Sherlock hid his face in John's shoulder trying to collect himself at least a little bit. Sherlock breathed in Johns calming smell a mixture of something like tea, biscuits, fire and something very distinctly John. It was comforting and Sherlock felt safe for the first time in a long while.
“Sherlock.” John calls excitedly as he leaves the classroom practically running over to Sherlock his bags hanging from his shoulders. “Come on, come on!”
“No, not at all. I actually asked for yours as well, John.” They both smiled abashedly looking down a minute before John tapped the space on the bed next to him.
“Sherlock, they will stay and even if for some reason -that I don’t believe will happen- that they don’t stay, I will. I have been there for you before and I’m here for you now.” Mycroft sat on his bed and took the now crying detective into his arms, like he had done before. Sherlock was emotional and the more he repressed the emotions the more they built up and soon would burst. Become explosive.
"Friend of mine, well I say friend.." Sherlock says at the unasked question then continues to clean things a bit. John hums in acknowledgment as he ventures into the kitchen. It's full of messy science equipment and John can't help but be the slightest bit impressed.
“Sherlock.” A quiet voice called and so Sherlock sat up slowly, the bright and warmth around him calming and peaceful. He turned, seeing John beside him sitting in the grass of such colors, lush bushes and trees behind him.
“And I can’t believe he’s sleeping with my brother.” Sherlock gags comically and leaves the room to go to his own and grab the file.
"Then don't let me, just say I took the computer for all I care." He grumbles as searches with every reference he can think of.
"Because I appreciate your company."
“Relationship I had with John.”
“You know my name, I know you do.”
"Maybe that's why I want to." Sherlock said bitterly before taking on a more subdued expression. "John I am a ridiculous man as you already know, I wreck the flat, put body parts in the fridge and I do experiments on your belongings. I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all around obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune of meeting. And yet you John Watson seem to be the one and only constant presence in my life, for what reason I can not possibly fathom. I have been horrible to you John and for some reason I have only just realized. I am truly sorry." Sherlock hung his head ashamed refusing to look at John's eyes.
John’s thoughts seemed to run along the same track as he started to tear up and sniffle quickle to try and be strong and push away the feelings. “You’ll come back for me..?” He asked very quietly his voice thick with emotion just as his eyes were as he looked up to Sherlock to read the sincerity in his eyes.
"You never asked specifically. Phrase your questions correctly." He adminoshes pulling out a pair of metal tongs and fishing the needle out of the water. He mentally curses himself, he sounded like Mycroft.
The yelling was even louder in his and Molly's room, coming through the thin walls as if the people yelling were in the room. Molly was on her bed and looked to him in confusion Sherlock just shrugged and fell to his bed.
"My mother was a drunk, as good as she was a mother- -when she wasn't passed out- -she was still an undeniable drunk and an absent minded parent. Sometimes she'd disappear go who knows where and show up again a day later like nothing happened. When she disappeared that day we thought that was all it was, until she didn't come back.
What he didn’t expect was the buzz on his radio that a firetruck had arrived on scene of the location. Sherlock had not told him anything of a fire and he was starting to get worried what else he hadn't told him about.
John scoffed somewhat. “Of course, you’re not even happy to see me.” The scene changed before them, a room from the mind they were tailoring to appeared quickly. He didn’t recognize it but John sat and settled back as if he belonged there.
"For taking precise amounts of liquid."
"Let's go out."
John stopped that thought immediately, that was the last thing he needed to be thinking right now. As he ran as fast as his legs would carry him and unfortunately he didn't have much time to run at the hospital leading to him losing his breath quickly but he pushed through, dashing through hallway after hallway until he reached the place.
I meant to have some plot here but it didn’t happen, oh well!
Not having done the same, still in his own horror of seeing the building his brother was in disappear in front of his eyes. Greg called for him and ran to him as quickly as he could although he felt as if it was in slow motion. He pushed faster, ran harder to grab him and pull him away from the building as chunks hit the ground at high speeds around them.
When they finished Sherlock took out his violin and began to play not the melodramatic sad song he usually did but a beautiful upbeat melody of Johnathan Watson’s song ‘Pretender’. Molly found herself humming along and if she paid enough attention she could hear Sherlock doing the same.
"He asked if we wanted to go to his concert."
“Yeah, okay. Good luck.” As she left with the equipment a silence fell upon them. It wasn’t necessarily an awkward silence but it also wasn’t a comfortable one. Sherlock got up and came around the bed to hold his hands out.
“I said I’m fine.” He snapped and she left him alone, he closed his eyes to think. Sherlock was angry, angry at himself. He was such an idiot for doing that. Doing that to John. This was supposed to be a start, a new start he wasn’t supposed to be going back to old habits.
“Who am I?” John asks carefully and watches as Sherlock’s expression crumbles. John is taken aback at the sudden emotions of pain, longing and what he couldn’t only describe as heartbreak. “Y-you don’t have to-“ John quickly tried to amend.
As he bit into it he was proven wrong. It was vegetarian lasagna -which John always liked better- and John could taste every ingredient from the butternut squash to the nutmeg. It was deliciously familiar and John felt tears come to his eyes, he blinked them away.
“I’m sorry.” He continues to apologize, over and over again. He had so much he needed to apologize for. For not being able to help him and allowing this to happen for not being strong enough to keep this from happening.
John shook Sherlock as gently as he could to not disturb his wounds but he had to wake up. He tried his best to wake him while keeping from opening his wounds further but it just wasn’t working.
“Yes.” He grabbed Sherlock’s hands and pulled himself up and Sherlock steadied him by grabbing his waist as John held his shoulders. “Now, let's go.”
“Of course we are, thank you.” Sherlock says in just as soft a tone pressing a kiss lightly to the top of John’s head rubbing his back gently as a comfort. He calms himself for John’s sake not wanting to make him nervous then steps out of the room to face whatever would happen.
“You are in no such thing. I’ve told you before they are having activities every night that you could partake in. Even specific ones for recovering-“
Greg waved him goodbye as the car took off into the early morning. Greg didn't know where Sherlock and John had gone but he knew they'd be safe with Mycroft's watchful eye over them. He was exhausted and knew he'd probably stay that way until this case was sorted out.
"You're going to poke me with that thing aren't you?" John says disliking the idea but putting his arm out to Sherlock.
"Of course. Good luck with the case , Gregory." Mycroft said solemnly then slid into his car.
“Totally gay.” Molly said smuggly. Sherlock handed her a twenty pound note and walked away. He didn’t want to see her smug face but was grinning despite himself.
"How so?"
They wrote and rewrote everything multiple times until they had something concrete and then worked on the sound. Notes and what instrument what went best until a song was formed.
“And what is it you need?” Think fast, is what people say in these situations but Sherlock was too focused on the promise of a cigarette to even think of an excuse. What need had done to his mind would be mortifying at any other time but he was far to blinded to care now.
come in." The women ushered them into her home and closed the door behind them rushing to get tea and such. They sat down in her living room and she handed out tea and biscuits.
"What plan?" John feels like screaming. Soon enough he might.
"Sherlock.." John says quietly and unsure from behind Sherlock as he pulls him through the streets.
“No!” She thought a moment. “Okay, I see what you mean.” Sher grumbled.
(See the end of the chapter for
The room was large and open, a gymnasium of the school it seemed. There were papers hanging from strings in the middle, moonlight shone through the single skylight above as it illuminated the area.
"Because that was the plan and it worked." Sherlock states matter of factor as if John was to know as well.
Basked in the soft blue moonlight there stood John looking as if he were frozen in time by his stillness. His breathing coming out in small white puffs into the cold room with fluttering photographs only a few steps ahead of them. John’s eyes were blown wide, transfixed on the papers in front of them, gently swaying in the wind.
“Oh, please.” Sherlock drawled as he sat up on the bed. “I’ll be here for ages. Stuck in silent solitude.” He fell back again on the bed, dramatic as always.
“Hurts.”
Sherlock opened his eyes a blue sky with a soft fuzzy glow about it was the first thing he saw. A tree to his right he saw next with leaves of green and yellow shades, some falling around him. The whole scene had an almost angelic glow to it and Sherlock had never seen anywhere as beautiful.
The knife in his leg, removed from frustration to what seemed like hours ago kicked behind him in a desperate attempt to follow John. Moriarty having taken him away with a knife to his neck and Sherlock was defenseless to help him.
‘Too hard to deal with. I just want the facts, John. That's all that matters, feelings just get in the way of things.’
The next morning was dull to Sherlock, Mrs Hudson came in and checked him over. He asked for morphine, she said no, he asked for cocaine, she said no, in a last attempt he asked for a cigarette, she smacked him upside the head and left. ‘Still wasn’t a no’ he had yelled back at her, she didn’t seem to care.
Limbo wasn’t so bad at first. It was all talk he thought, creation was something he’d always enjoyed. He hadn’t been able to do it so freely in such a long time.
"What?! Why would I- I wouldn't- even if we were- We aren't-" John stutters over his words dropping the knife and spinning to face her.
“Setting up a surprise for you.” James said with a grin before he disappeared behind the computer screen again.
“It was a Christmas present.”
He needed to finish the puzzle. How important was the box with a lock to not open. It mustn't be very important if he wasn't supposed to open it.
“What are the possible chances of that ever happening? One billion to one and probably even worse odds with my luck.”
“Do we have to do this now?” He asked in an almost whiny way.
“Should I even ask?” Lestrade asks suspiciously sitting back down -correctly- into his chair.
"I know I was being stupid. It definitely won't happen again, I promise."
“Did you meet Sherlock when he was little?” John found himself asking actually surprising himself. Greg laughed a bit.
Greg arrived at the power plant just as Mycroft did, each with their own respective forces. Almost ten cars pulled into the area and within minutes the place was locked down, every section covered but the actual building that stood in the center.
John woke up crying with a shout for Sherlock in the bedroom and Sherlock cursed his existence for failing once again. He grabbed a towel and cleans up himself quickly before going to the bedroom to John.
"Last time?"
After the long case with the Irish diplomat Brandon Mongan in Ireland, my fiancé Sherlock Holmes and I have returned to Baker Street, and all is well.'
“I don’t know who I am.” John admitted quietly, his eyes closed shut and his body shaking. Once the words were said more just seemed to flow out with them. “I don’t know where I am or why I’m here. Worst of all, I don’t know who you are and why it hurts so much not to know that.”
“Thinking.” Sherlock says simply and at John’s inquiring glance taps his head lightly. “In here.”
The click, click of elegant shoes on cement, ever present behind the two but never a body to be seen.
In the wake of happiness John softly placed his lips to Sherlock's own. Testing the water so to speak. Sherlock reacted immediately practically throwing himself at John crushing their lips together in a heated kiss. John gasped as he fell backwards because of Sherlock, who took the liberty of sticking his tongue down John's throat. Sherlock ignored the pain in his abdomen in favor of leaving John breathless. The light and feathery kiss turned into a full on snogging session and a fight for dominance. In which Sherlock won.
“Because every handsome man is either married or gay.”
He became aware of some noise after an unknown amount of time had passed in his thoughts, what sounded like muddled voices coming from above him. Finding his drive again he tried to open his eyes and this time a veil of color came through the white shell he was entrapped in. The voices were familiar as were the colors and yet he couldn’t seem to place it. Realizing just now how muddled his mind seemed to be, suddenly feeling in disarray.
"Is that your way of asking?" John asked sitting back to look up at Sherlock.
“What?” John asked surprised looking up at Sherlock. “How did you know I had one?”
“I’m going to go look.” Sherlock said slowly moving away his hand falling away from Johns as he creeps over to the papers again.
“Try to.”
He hoped Molly didn’t take the news too badly, he still wanted to be able to work with her and be her friend. For now he could only wait and see.
It was time to go home.
"Yeah, he only told you about a hundred times." She grumbles as she pats her hair with a towel.
She started to hook up the machine to the wall while Sherlock sat beside John who was nervously fidgeting. John couldn't seem to keep his hands still, they were in the rough blankets, then in his too long hair then back down again, this continued for a few minutes while she fixed the helmet. Sherlock was starting to get annoyed at the movements and apparently John was too, as he was slightly glaring at his hands for moving on their own.
“Not him, his henchman; Sebastian Moran.” Sherlock froze with silent fury, he had done this to John, perhaps under Moriarty’s order but it was still him. But John needed rest and he couldn’t leave him here.
“You loved someone.”  Sherlock pointed out, unable to refrain. “Why the pictures?”
“Sorry.” Sherlock muttered looking over to the elevator then looking around for anyone who might rat them out.
‘Lost puppy.’
“Oh, shut up.”
“Probably not, you’ll find out.” Sherlock replies absently as the door opens again. He stiffens slightly as footsteps come his way and something taps his foot.
"Coming." John grumbled binning his cup of disgustingness and walking over. The body was odd. By odd he meant dead. Obviously.
Sherlock came upon the ambulance where John and Mycroft sat where he left them. Neither had moved much though it seemed Mycroft was speaking to him, John didn't look like he was listening.
“Then why do you look so guilty?” She adds suspiciously, positive that something had happened.
Sherlock looked back to the wardrobe, their wardrobe filled with John’s clothes as well as his own. Mixed together like they used to be, one being instead of two separate entities. He trails his fingers gently over John’s jumpers that hung beside his suit jackets. They were opposites and yet so similar in so many ways, he smiles at the thought, missing the way the clicked together so flawlessly and yet could argue like fire and ice were clashing together.
I apologize for my absence I have recently started up school again and don't have much time to write anymore. I am trying to get back into the swing of things again, promise. Welp hope you enjoyed!
“Why did you ask him that?” Sherlock was quiet for a while Molly didn’t think she was going to get an answer till he stood up and went to his bag to unpack.
“So you think, but I don’t believe this is over. As little as I know about John Watson from my brief conversation with him told me that he is not planning on leaving.” Mycroft watched as Sherlock processed the information, watched the relief crash over him and knock down his defenses. “I will stay, I realize I cannot have others help you. I need to do it, like I have in the past. This time you do have more help.”
Occupying the mind is a difficult task, especially the mind of one consulting detective Sherlock Holmes. As time moves at a snails pace all he can do is tap his fingers to the tune of the clock. Waiting for something to happen, something to change unlike the repetitive movements of his fingers of his mind asking a single question. ‘When?’
"Evidence? I didn't know this was in your job description." John said as he sat down in the free chair not before moving papers off of it of course.
He waits and waits and waits. The seconds suddenly feel like hours, minutes like days, hours like months and days might as well be years or lifetimes. Sherlock can’t tell anymore, he’s lost all sense of time but from the ticking of the clock in the kitchen it's been about three million ticks and he's stopped counting. Counting the seconds pass, like counting sheep to fall asleep there’s no logic to it, all it does is make you realize how slow time is really moving while you do nothing to make it go faster.
“Go on then.” Moriarty smiled, Sherlock didn’t like it when he smiled. He didn’t like much that he did, actually. He was tired, sleep deprived and quite literally starving. He felt the world falling around him and all he wanted to do was follow it down.
"What do you need the needle for?" John asks giving up on looking and just fiddling with his fingernails again.
John had to shake himself from his own thoughts needing to focus on Sherlock and keeping him from bleeding out. He quickly took off his jacket, first aid training kicking in as he wraps it up and ties it around Sherlocks bicep as a tourniquet. He removes his over shirt as well, pressing it to his back needing to keep the bleeding down. He had to stay calm and keep a level head if he ever wanted to get out of this with Sherlock alive.
John's calling his name but it's drowned out by the sudden ringing in his ears. His vision is tunneling and he can't feel his legs as he collapses into John's arms. He can't breathe, his throat is constricting and the air is so thin, it's not helping. He tries to clutch at John's shirt but his arms won't move as his body shakes with tremors.
"Alright, I'll grab our stuff." Sherlock replies as he opens the door to the halway. "Oh, John?"
You failed.
"Are you alright?" John asked after a few moments of quiet breathing. Sherlock looked over to him to see John staring at him intently and with a worried expression.
The city's power went out within a few moments of him sending the text and a silence followed that London hadn’t experienced in a very long time. The car buzzed around him and he pushed the gas in response. It was only early morning the sun had yet to rise, he was alone on the streets and the further he drove the less vehicles he encountered.
"Fine. Good luck brother mine, I will be watching."
He moved quicker, a map forming in his head of what he assumed the place looked like as he moved through. He wasn’t one to frequent power plants so the terrane was new to him while he had a rough idea it was difficult to say for certain taking turns blindly having lost the echo of Johns voice -what felt like- a long while ago now.
"What're you doing?" John asks curiously trying to sit up more and see over the microscope.
"Finally realized your mistake in ignoring me?" Sherlock snips as soon as he answers the phone and starts pacing around his room. He smirks to himself as he hears the answering sigh on the other side of the phone.
“Sherlock.. you’re okay? How..?” John asked in amazed bewilderment, looking him over and turning him a bit to check his back. Not a scratch.
“I’m not.” Sherlock admits sitting and pulling his legs to sit criss crossed, watching John’s reaction out of the corner of his eye.
'The Personal Blog of Dr. John H, Watson
“Stay here.” Greg made some noise, propped up against the brick walls of the old building as John dashed back inside. He was insane, he had to be. He saw Sherlock, felt him against him the warmth of his chest still ghosting over his back as he sprinted through the building.
They both hit the ground at a high speed as the ground shook around them, Greg rolled putting himself over Mycroft to protect him as debris fell around them.
"You're going to fix me then?" John asked quietly looking up to him after a few moments of silence. Sherlock glances at him before looking back to the fireplace.
“Are you okay?” Sherlock asks after Molly has screamed her heart out and is now just laying there on her bed.
"That's because you don't need a doctor to find you a cure." He smirked at the baffled John. "You need a detective to find you a distraction, and I intend to do so."
“Deal.”
“God, he’s hot.” Molly said practically purring.
The candle cast an eerie glow across the room and shadows over Sherlock's prone form. He drew Sherlock and the odd shadows across him in the dark but after he was done he wasn't any more tired. He noticed his mirror on the other side of the room, there were more odd shadows in it and one that John thought to be in the shape of a person. When he turned to see if it was there was nothing so he drew that to.
“Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes. I’m a consulting detective at Scotland Yard.” The man- Sherlock - said with a carefully blank expression, though somehow John could tell he was sad. John nods to himself as he thinks for a moment.
“It’s hard to when your in pain.” Sherlock snapped then took three more steps and sighed dramatically. “I am happy and thankful that you are helping me Myc, but your not making it any easier.”
A rush of blood to Sherlock's head and the world came into focus, the adrenaline kicking in as he tried to sit up.
“You don’t do that by eating it. I should’ve just came alone.” John grumbled to himself. “Just don’t put anything in your mouth alright?”
“Hey.” Sherlock said holding John’s arms lightly to get his attention. “It’s fine alright? Just an accident.” He assured him rubbing his arms lightly.
Five of them. Each with their own challenges and risks to force Sherlock to think and work harder to get what he wanted and beat the mad game. In the end he wondered if Sherlock was stumped, if he didn’t know what to do sometimes or if he couldn’t follow this but then at the same time he hoped that he could because no one else could.
John glanced over to the black chair, Sherlock shrugged indifferently and looked away from him staring somewhere off by the fireplace. He was inclined to agree with Mycroft this time actually, Sherlock didn’t want him on his own but he’d rather not spend any more time with Mycroft today.
"So you have nothing."
“Good try but don’t turn this on me. I’m not an idiot.”
"You know the only reason I'm here is to be a third wheel." She said as if it was obvious which confused John more.
"Homeless network all around the city, picked it up for me. Probably not the best-"
"'Is?' Not 'was a good parent'?"
People came out of their rooms wondering what the commotion was then went back into their rooms assuming it dealt with. None of them looked towards the window.
He couldn’t move more than a foot forward before having to stop again, a streak of blood across the linoleum. Rocks and rubble of the building getting caught in his wounds tearing at the sensitive skin.
She threw a pillow at his head, he thought about flipping her off but then he realized she wouldn’t be able to see it.
He watched as John scanned the area with unfamiliar eyes not know he was tearing Sherlock up inside. Sherlock watched as John walked the halls he had walked down so many times with cautious and wary steps. He watched as he entered their room, fully expecting him to leave the door open a crack so when Sherlock came to bed he wouldn't disturb him, he watched as the door was shut. Like a gunshot it rung in his ears.
"Well, yes. I would hope." Sherlock replied sheepishly. He didn't mean to jump to conclusions or anything he just enjoyed John's company so much he wanted to have it there in the future as well.
A knock came from his door and Sherlock told them to come in without opening his eyes.
“So am I.” Sherlock stated swiveling back around to look into Johns eyes as he stumbled into him. “You haven’t broke one rule your whole life have you?”
“Would you stop bringing that up?” Sherlock said dramatically with a roll of his eyes. “It was hideous, you said so yourself. You should be thanking me for getting rid of it.”
“John Watson. I wouldn't be calling you if I knew what happened.” The silence on the other end was terrifying. “What? What, is it? Why are you silent?” He demanded, slightly panicked.
“Well, I like you to.” John says confused as to why Sherlock has told him that after everything he just said.
"It depends on the day, sometimes he can walk with the nurses help, some days he's stuck in his bed and other days like today he doesn't have any control, his body moves without his command and we have to tie him down and sedate him. His doctor said that may just be his life, some doctors and nurses are convinced he just needs love to help keep his mind off of it. It's a tragedy, like right out of a book."
Sherlock was simply praying that at the end of all this John wasn’t de-aging anymore and the tracker would be removed. In the end, end of all this madness, John would be back to normal and they could get on with their lives, together. Finally together.
“Yes, yes I’m sure.”
A gap.
Sherlock adjusted his clothes a bit to hide the indent of the gun better before taking a large breath to get into the right mindset. Doing so he noticed the faint smell of smoke and looked around himself confused before realizing it was coming from the kitchen. Thinking the worst Sherlock rushed to kitchen coughing as he entered the room as smoke was steadily rising.
"You two are shagging aren't you?" Lestrade asked almost in a pleasant manner which confused Sherlock further.
"The yard. Blubbering idiots need me to identify one of the thugs from last night. I don't know why they can't just follow my description. Idiots the lot of them." Sherlock grumbled grabbing his scarf and arranging it oh his neck. "I managed to get you out of it and It shouldn't take more than an hour."
Sherlock sighed heavily to himself adjusted his bags and headed over actually grateful to not have to go home. So he started heading to Molly’s flat which was just up the road.
Every jagged breath from Sherlock gave John just a little bit more hope as he tried to tend to his wounds. The knife still in Sherlocks leg was the worst of them but John knew better than to remove it without having anything to bandage it with. The knife was thankfully relatively small and with that small good thing John hope it didn’t hit anything important.
The peace was all but comforting in the midst of the darkness, an eerie silence was yet to be a welcome, yet he traveled on through the silence and oncoming danger that was all too appealing. It was sick. He was sick for thinking such things although it was true, he liked it and hated it all at once. The drama, the mystery and confusion. The perfectly maddening opponent to him.
“Don’t worry, it’ll go away.” Sherlock says soothingly placing a hand on his arm and watching John’s face carefully as he seems to be slowly panicking.
Sherlock returned in a rush to his room with no incident, he closed his door and with a small victory twirl pulled the cigarette and lighter from his pocket. Anderson would just think he had left it in the lounge, idiot. Just as he was about to light it the door swung open then a loud thump of something being dropped and someone pulled the cigarette from his mouth
“Almost three now.”
"Pretty much yeah." John answers scrapping the remnants of chocolate ice cream from the tub.
“What?” John turned infront of him. The hall was empty and nearly silent when John’s hand slipped from Sherlock’s. He felt the loss of warmth practically pulling away all his own warmth, chilling him to the bone. “How could you..?”
“Alright.” Mycroft agreed and they lapses into silence the only sound their footsteps on the linoleum. The sound echoed around them ominously.
He sighed quietly sticking his hands in his pockets and trying to push his line of thought to the back of his mind. He didn’t want to reminisce, it would only lead to more pain in his chest as it seemed to be ripping itself apart from the inside out.
John gasps lifting a hand to his mouth and looking at Sherlock as if he’d just said something truly scandalizing. “The bad one?”
Sherlock smiles softly at the thought and gently lifts John off of him shifting away and lying him down into the bed. He places a soft kiss on his forehead and gets his phone his phone -which he had dropped to the floor in the excitement before- stopping at the door to watch John a moment. He looked angelic the sunset coming in through the windows casting a lovely orange glow to his features.
“I always did say ‘Love can cure all ailments’ and they both do need it.” Terry replied as they continued cleaning surfaces.
"What now?" Sherlock's voice comes through the other side annoyed at being yelled at again while going to get "supplies." Yeah right. John and Molly giggled slightly like they had the last five times they've asked him to grab something when he's about to leave.
"Sherlock-"
"Yes, your forgiven." John pressed a kiss to corner of Sherlock's lips before sitting up and binging Sherlock carefully with him. "You could have just told me you know. Or Greg or even your brother."
"Now I know for a fact that there's more ice on the balcony. So, what was that about?" John asked after a few moment of silence and Molly turns toward him.
There was something he was forgetting, something very, very important that lost meaning as quickly as it came when John was hurt. The pips. The bloody pips. He should have been paying attention, he should have known not to get distracted by personal matters. Things that could very well be easily taken away now that he hadn’t done this correctly.
“Then I’ll come with you. I’m not leaving you.”
“Then help me too, alright.” John said his anger slowly evaporating into concern for Sherlock. He sat beside him pulling his legs up onto the bed turning to Sherlock. “I want to know.”
Hanging a woman with long blond hair and blue eyes. Hanging by her neck arms pinned to the tree like on a cross. The saying was ‘your past will come back to haunt you’ and that has never been more true.
Sherlock took John's coat that he'd grabbed on their way out and helped him to put it on, there wasn't much to be said, although they both felt that they should. After he got his coat on and there was nothing else to do Sherlock was the one to break the silence.
“Oh shoot, you’re right. I had completely forgotten.” John says worriedly stilling what he was doing and running his fingers through his hair. “She’s going to flip.”
“Skuwwy.” John whines quietly, pulling Sherlock from his thoughts to see John reaching for the skull as far as he could but unable to reach. Sherlock moved over and grabbed the skull handing it to John who held onto it clumsily with his little arms and chubby fingers.
The darkness is unexpected compared to the bright scenery of his dream and he soon realizes that’s all it was. He hazey wave of dread is now at the forefront of his mind as his eyes adjust and he finally is able to focus on what is around him once again.
That’s when the fear sets in.
He couldn’t breath. It was impossible through the thick substance. Death was imminent, he knew that and yet he struggled not one to greet death so easily. He’d hold on for as long as it took, he told himself though his body protested. Not able to take much more of the abuse to his lungs.
"How could you..?" John questioned faintly his frustration and anger falling apart at the guilt in Sherlock's eyes that he stared into.
"Always, John. Always."
"So? He's my best friend."
“That’s what you think.” Sherlock said coming back over with two glasses for them.
Something scuffled in the distance increasing Sherlock’s already rising unease of the area and soon enough the tracker was blinking erratically in his hand as he came up to one of the storage units. The doors were already opened, not that it mattered because half of the metal shell had already seemed to be ripped apart. Bad weather and years of rust having taken off the back end easily.
John almost smiles at the thought. A detective, it's what he needs and Sherlock just so happens to be one. Sometimes it's funny how fate works and John almost wishes he didn't have to expose him to this, to the madness.
“Where..?” John asks turning back to see Sherlock’s eyes closed again, once again stoic.
forgot."
“So now we’re all happy.”
Clawing to the walls, scratching at the paint and leaving blood stains everywhere.
"It'll only take ten." Sherlock stayed and they were off once again. The interrogation actually took him fifteen minutes and John made sure to be a dick about it. Sherlock cracked the case open and after a small chase the other criminal was behind bars as well. John made sure to voice his adoration for his brilliance and as they decided to walk home that night Sherlock took his hand pleased beyond words.
“I don’t care, leave me. You duty is done now go away and bother that boyfriend if yours.” Mycroft made an unrefined huffing noise and left. Sherlock smirked to himself from his place on his bed.
John makes a happy noise in the back of his throat allowing Sherlock to take over.
"My condolences." Sherlock said honestly.
"This is my friend, Sherlock Holmes."
Sherlock Holmes is a seventeen year old with black hair and skin as white as the snow around him. It was currently Very early in October snow was already everywhere in London.
“Interesting.”
"Alright." John practically jumps for joy as he makes his way to their -yes it's theirs now- room down the hall, Sherlock in tow. "But only because you said please."Sherlock teases and John swats his arm but says nothing too happy about finally getting some sleep.
He silently cursed himself and his weak body for not cooperating, trying to push himself back up only resulting in hitting the floor again. He was useless.
“Yes, I agree. Silent pinning won’t do anyone good.”
“It wasn’t a date.” He mumbled into his pillow before propping himself up on his elbows, changing the topic quickly. “I should be asking you that. How was.. I want to say Jacob?”
“Please do take the opportunity.” He pushed a harsh breath out from his nose and glanced around. He decided he hated this hospital, he’d met John here and that had been about the only good that had come of it. The carving was about his ankle cuts in the tree to which he knew what it read already, it hadn’t been long since there was someone else in this tree. Hanging from this tree as he now was. “I’ll take notes of the aftermath for you.”
"And that's supposed to mean?" Lestrade asked exasperated already used to Sherlock's antics, John just seemed captivated.
There wasn't a point to words when actions were much better and without a care in the world they fell asleep.
“I thought I knew but everything seems different.” John said helplessly trying to understand why it wasn’t the same.
“He already is.” Mycroft said rather ominously.
"It will be dealt with along with everything else, though I believe we must freeze the.. de-aging process first then work from there."
Mrs Hudson was with Sherlock today and so John stood alone in the building now. He stared up at the stairs and couldn’t find the will to move up the stairs. He could already feel the pressure setting in on him, the weighted silence making his chest hurt.
“It was nothing.” John smiled anyway he looked like he was going to say more but Mrs Carson came in with that helmet looking thing again and John’s face dropped. His eyes went back to that vacant state.
“He’s really cute you know.” Molly said dreamily once again staring at John. This time they were sat in a seminar that everyone was required to take. Neither of them were listening.
“So Johnathan how’s life been here in New York?” The women asked her American accent in contrast to his British one.
“Greg..” John said to himself a moment -for some reason- just realizing that he wasn’t there with them, therefore missing. “Oh no.. Where is he?”
“Oh Johnny boy, here we are again.” James said slowly circling the room that he seemed so comfortable in but John's eyes hadn’t adjusted enough to the darkness of the new space to recognize it. “You have grown but you’ve not changed really, have you?”
Sherlock pulled himself up again grabbed his silk robe and left to go across the hall. He peeked through the window before entering, they were both awake watching something on Johns TV in the corner of the room. They looked the happiest he's seen either of them in a long time. He smiled to himself at his success to bring them together before schooling his features opening the door and walking in.
“My crew and I will get out of your hair now. Good luck Mr Holmes.” Doctor ‘whatever his name is’ says before turning around and joining the rest of the doctors in heading down the stairs then out of the flat.
"It's alright dear. I'm sure John would like a friend. You go see him, just make sure you tell Terry before heading over so she can tell you how good he's doing that day."
John moved immediately to get into the car not having a problem with this arrangement in the least. Sherlock on the other hand didn't budge not letting go of John's hand therefore not allowing him to get in the car.
“John Watson.” John staid sticking out his hand to shake. “We didn’t really meet properly.”
“In recovery. Nothing but a few scratches. We found him in a building nearby” Mycroft assured and spun his umbrella slowly between his hands. “We found the cure you had as well, nearly broke.”
“What I mean is questions arose as to the origin of the problem. As you often say the ‘who, what, when, how and why.’” Mycroft explained to Lestrade who suddenly looked haunted
“Would you stop touching them.” John said, snatching Sherlocks wrist away from the photos. “You don’t know what’s on these things.”
Sherlock's hands were on his hips and Johns were around Sherlock's neck and in his hair, completely immersed in the feeling of his lips. Later John would blame it on the hysteria but in that moment he couldn't stop himself. There wasn't a fight for dominance John was far too tired for anything but to admit to Sherlock's talented tongue. When they parted Sherlock laid his forehead on John's own, they were both breathing heavily -from running and also kissing- their breaths mingling in the rain dripping down from the platform above them. John's arms fell to Sherlock's chest holding onto his wet coat with freezing fingers, they were both starting to shiver.
A buzzing noise clicked on behind him before he could create a plan and he turned slowly back behind him. There was a monitor he had been leaning back against on a shelving unit on the lowest shelf almost on the floor.
“A specimen definitely.” Molly looked at Sherlock oddly.
“Me either, she drags it on for as long as possible and we never actually learn anything. Besides she looks like a witch.” Sherlock couldn’t contain a laugh and John smiled giggling slightly.
Mycroft lived two floors below them with his flatmate Greg Lestrade. They were dating but had to keep it a secret or be expelled for campus dating which was prohibited. Greg and Molly have been friends for longer than her and Sherlock have and she introduced them years back. Sherlock made an effort to forget his name just to piss Mycroft off. He liked Greg despite everything. Greg was going to be a policeman a detective inspector so Sherlock would need him later.
"Well, that's it. Your frankly obnoxious sister can leave and stop hitting on Molly; she's straight." Harry had actually cornered Molly and started hitting on her far too obviously in her drunken state.
“Yes.” He said firmly and pushed himself out of the window holding onto the edge for a moment before dropping, controlling the pain of his short drop. He didn’t look up to the window again, he didn’t have time. He was busy.
“Everything is settled, sir.” The doctor says simply clasping his hands behind his back respectfully.
"Dad is great he is an amazing man. He really does love us and tried to give us everything, still does really. He is currently in the hospital if you would need to speak with him, he's been fighting disease with a weak immune system for a long while, any day could be his last."
“I’ll call Nicole when we get back inside. Speaking of which-” John got to his feet and held out a glove clad hand to Sherlock. “-come on, it’s freezing out here. You can do all your work stuff back in to the thankfully heated dorms.” Sherlock chuckled softly as John faked his teeth chattering.
"I'm only saying it's nice to know where we are going after this is over." Sherlock argued wild hand gestures flying everywhere.
"Wha-"
“How do you know?” Sherlock demanded snapping eyes open and staring at Mycroft with renewed vigor. “How could you possibly know?” He asked, his voice cracking slightly.
He’d chosen the wrong room and now he could only hope that Sherlock found John and they would be okay.
“How long ago?” Lestrade asks pointing to the when.
“You do want that then, right? A relationship I mean.” John says watching him closely, hoping that he hadn’t gotten that wrong.
They both sighed longingly, staring at Johns table which had bodyguards and people surrounding. The thrill will wear off and people will lose interest, they always do.
"Don't even try Sherlock. Just don't." John took a deep steadying breath before speaking. "I can't believe you did this. I won't believe it. I don't want to."
"You don't know that." John replies quietly, afraid and refusing to meet his eye.
“I didn’t say I bought it, I said I found it.”
“Oh sorry but do you see it, it’s amazing!” She whispered yelled doing little circles looking at everything. “And we get to be here at the same time as Johnathan Watson! Do you think we’ll meet him!? Oh my goodness I don’t know what I’d do! And do-“
"Yes, I trust him. Besides he's an officer, if anything goes wrong he can call for backup." John reasoned keeping a level head as he could about this.
"Curious." Is all Sherlock said then went back to the blood. "Name?"
He pressed his palm to Sherlock’s cheek and called his name trying to get a response but none came, he got louder and louder and started to shake him. Someone tried to pull him away but he pushed them off and just screamed his name louder. His world was dying in his arms and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it.
“Don’t call me that.” He groaned some breathing slowly until the pain subsided again.
“No, he wouldn’t be. I can protect him just as well as you without the poking and prodding of your laboratory dogs.” Sherlock says firmly looking up to Mycroft in the eye. “He needs me as I need him, so leave us be.”
"Sherlock, now is not the time." Came the reply, Sherlock could imagine clearly his brothing running a hand over his face.
“Piss off.” John says throwing a pillow at his head.
“Come on lets go before she gets all weepy.” His father said. He always understood everything he needed.
“I trust you.”
It would be enough to save him but blood would be shed.
"Mycroft-"
"What were you doing?" He ignored the question.
"Dating then." Sherlock rolled his eyes again at his positive tone.
"Sherlock." Molly said curled up on her bed as he placed his hand on the door knob.
“Because this is a lot more personal than you seem to think. Because when I found him he was just as much of an abandoned kid as you were when we first met. Because I solved his parents murder and imprisoned his uncle. Because l let him stay in my house after he got out of the hospital. Because every night he had a nightmare I let him stay in my bed. Because every time he woke up screaming for his father I was there to be that for him. Because when they took him away I didn’t stop them. Because when that son of a bitch broke out I didn’t get there in time. That’s why it matters.” He took a breath and cleared his throat. “My rules, got it?”
“Well 99% of the time.”
“Talk to me.” Sherlock said softly moving his hands comfortingly up and down Johns back. “I want to help.”
“There was no way you were going to come here alone. If not with me, Greg would’ve followed you.”
When they were walking inside Sherlock realized John hadn’t let go of his hand. He blushed silently as they walked into the heated building, feeling John’s warm gloved hand in his own bare one. They walked for a while until they came to their rooms hallway. “So you don’t like snow, anything else I should know?”
"I figured it out this afternoon and tried to get you, believe me John I did. I drove all the way down to the ferry but I missed it by a few minutes and you we're gone I tried calling you a hundred times. I swear, I tried, I did and I'm sorry. I got back and you were already.. he was.." Sherlock trails of as suddenly there not enough air in the room and he's gasping.
“Happy Christmas, John.” Sherlock said amusedly and lifted his glass up to John's own.
Sherlocks body bleeding out, right in front of his eyes John quickly remembers he had to save him. He shakily presses his hands to Sherlocks back watching as blood pools between his fingers and he feels the urge to retch in the sick fascination.
“Very.” He reached for John’s gun and pointed it straight at him as his vision surfaced. The colors returning to the room and giving him an actual view of Jim Moriarty, the criminal, mass murderer, certified insane genius who had taken John from him. For a moment there was the loathing, the red flash of ‘pull the trigger’ and end it. Then there was a sickening sense of fascination, the psychological aspect of being similar in a way he had thought no one could be until he found out this man existed. In a place of misplacement finding someone in the same space was an odd feeling he imagined they both felt.
He smiles as she introduces him and the crowd applauded for a time that was probably too long.
The End ;)
John sat up blurry eyed and leaned against his chair which was still across from the fireplace. He rubbed his eyes in an attempt to wake up but just found himself nodding off on the chair. He needed tea but it was so far away.
"Yes. I know where your mother is."
The death.
"Stop this ridiculous sentence and say what you're implying, Lestrade. I don't have tolerance for this nonsense." He ground out snapping his laptop closed to openly glare at him.
"'What're' is not a proper word try again." Sherlock reprimands him lightly leaning against the counter waiting for the water to boil. He's not sure when he started caring about grammar but it seemed important.
"Sherlock." John said immediately as he walked in then patted the bed in front of him. Sherlock sat in front of him and got the surprise of John hugging the life out of him he quickly grabbed John's arms to stop from falling over. Sherlock started cataloguing the sensations of hugging John and having him in his arms.
John was far too shocked to do anything but stand there looking at the place Sherlock had been, arms still up where he was holding the consulting detective up just moments ago. He turned his head tentatively over to the side to see the whole MET just stood there staring at him and some at Sherlock with shell shocked expressions. Sherlock paid them no mind and got into the cab.
“You had sex, didn’t you.” Molly says very proud at herself for seeing or observing as Sherlock was always telling her to do.
John stood at the door and stared at the wood blankly, willing himself to take the handle and go inside the building that would surely bring back the memories of a life he no longer could attain. He pushed the door open and stepped in regardless and the place was silent.
He wasn’t entirely sure what had happened but one moment he was standing there, Moriarty in front of him and Sherlock telling him it would be okay. Him, the man practically hanging in front of him was telling him that it would be okay when he was the one with both his feet on the ground not Sherlock.
“And you’re so bloody short.” Sherlock quipped back in the same tone kissing him again, letting his tongue invade John’s mouth.
Together they laid through the night drifting in and out of dreams, peace and the tranquility of love washing over the both of them. As they slept.
So he did just for the man who declared him John.
"So you finally did it, huh?" Lestrade asked quietly as if it was some big secret he knew all along. Sherlock rolled his eyes still not looking up.
As Sherlock slowly lets his hands down John turns his blushing face away and tucks his hands under his arms. With crossed arms, a blushing face and a hidden smile John walked around Sherlock.
“I was wrong.” He snorted at that, even through the phone Sherlock could tell he was rolling his eyes with bitter laughter.
“I had to know what it was.” Sherlock said simply not seeing it as a problem.
John chuckled softly and went to scrape off what he had burned and try another attempt at cooking. Sherlock made everything better and he felt more at peace with himself knowing that he would always be right beside him.
“I got involved, attached. You know it made me almost believe you when you said ‘caring is not an advantage’.”
After a very romanticized version of the case at the very end lay this.
-don’t leave the hospital.” John said with her at the end making her smile.
"What are you doing?" John amends and leans so he can see the stove.
As his eyes adjusted to the room around him he’s able to see the room he’s been brought into. The security room, black screens around them and desks, shelves of technology John had no idea about.
“Yes, and it’s been brilliant”
Sherlock waits until he hears the resounding click of the flat door and for the building to lapse into a familiar silence before stepping onto the landing. He looks up the stairs to John’s closed bedroom door and lets out a quiet breath, childishly crossing his fingers before moving to walk up the stairs.
"Do you really think I'd stick around if I thought you weren't treating me right. Yeah you can be an arse but so can I. We all have our days, you  sometimes more than mine but your who you are. I like who you are. Why do you think I'm still here?" John took a breath and laid his hand on Sherlock's own. "I like you for you, not for your ability to act Sherlock. I don't care how much of an arse you are as long as your not putting up a front and just being you. You don't have to apologize because you didn't do anything wrong. I stay because I want to and nothing you do will make be leave so get that out of your head." John rounded the table and held out his arms although he was starting to hide it Sherlock looked ready to burst into tears. "Now come and hug me you git."
