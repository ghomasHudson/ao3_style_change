Gabriel walked out from the kitchen. Cloth swung over his shoulder, lollipop in his mouth grinning like he was anywhere but in Purgatory.
“Dean!” Sam called out for his brother. Being on his own was not good for Dean right now with a target on his back the size of Kansas.
“Another?” Cas asked.
Finito!
“I’m never leaving the bar again,” he states matter of fact when he returns. Dean shakes off the unwanted attention and turns to face the bar to take another order. A familiar face is staring back at him.
“Has Dean given him the seal of approval?” John asked.
“Couple of hours later I walk pass, see the bloody body covered on the floor still. It’s not covered probably, just a plastic sheet over it with the navy uniform sticking out. That was two years ago I wanna say.”
“I got you.” Ash scoops ice into two tumblers he holds in one hand.
The next exam coming up had Dean more anxious than usual, no amount of porn seemed to be helping him. What he’d give to have Cas hold him down, pull an orgasm out of him and then for Dean to repay the favour would be everything right about now. He’d do it without the alcohol at this stage he was jonesing that bad for it. Dean sat at his desk, drumming his fingers on his laptop. The article he had been reading for the past hour still on the screen.
When Dean's Mom asked them at Thanksgiving for the story of when they first told each other they loved one another Dean nearly choked on his drink and Cas had to hide his mischievous smile. How could they possibly say it entailed a comment from a fan who watched the live feed of Dean getting fucked for the first time? They couldn't. So Cas said the next best believable thing.
When he put his tongue back in his mouth he looked up at Cas. “Like that?”
Dean challenged it. He had to.
Gabriel hummed in agreement, "They always do."
“No, I just…” Dean moved to sit on the chair. “I used to beat the crap out of anyone who looked at me the wrong way in here and now it feels like I’m back to square one.”
Sunday night his phone vibrated on his desk. He put down the piece of charcoal to read it.
“Did you talk to Castiel about
Dean debated what to send. He had no idea, pulling up blanks. Did he want to go out with Benny? His profile pictures showed him as a handsome guy. How true could that be though? People lied on the internet all the time. Even the photos Dean picked were of him on
Now they were alone, he could talk to his brother about what happened that morning, and last night and the last couple of weeks or months depending on how far back Dean wanted to go with this. He knew his brother could tell something was off about him and that Sam had been patient all day, waiting for the right moment to bring it up or until Dean found the balls to bring it up himself. They were in sync like that, even since the last two or so years they’ve lived apart. It’s hard to break that kinda bond.
“I need to get going but I’ll check over that email and spruce something up for the whatever…” He waved his hand dismissively, making a bee line for the exit.
“I wouldn’t say no.” Ash replies downing the rest of the beer in his hand. He scrambles himself off the couch where he was sitting with Jo and heads to the fridge. The only thing in it being beer and more beer. He rarely cooks in his place too busy working and coming back late at night with take out from various places around town. Manual labour keeps him in shape.
“Let’s start with one.” He gets off the bed, taking his book with him. It’s time to say goodnight.
His stomach flipped like back when he was a teenager.
Charlie excused himself, having to take a leak.
Things Cas is not allowed say while his hand is on Dean’s dick.
“Seems straight forward enough,” Cas put the paper down and pulled his laptop from under his pillow to pull him a search engine. “We can do it on Stonewall. It’s not in the school curriculum, not readily known about unless you’re a part of our community.”
“What was what back where?” Cas replied, not moving away from washing the dishes by the sink. It infuriated Dean, the casual tone, the lack of care that at what he did.
“Fuck that’s good.” He exhales. His voice wrecked. Dean has fists of Cas jet black hair in his hands and he’s torn between pushing them further into his neck or pulling him back to feel that tongue in his mouth again. So many decisions…
“Where?” Dean replies running his hands over Castiel again. He touches his back, pauses and waits for an answer. Castiel shakes his head, letting it drop to Dean’s chest, remembering to breathe, just breathe. He licks his dry lips and Dean’s chest by accident, the salted taste of his sweat on his tongue. Dean smells like beer, cigarette smoke, sweat, gas, a concoction of his jobs rolled into one scent.
“Sam, you beautiful genius,” She mutters to the phone before putting it back in her dress pocket. “Okay I got it. You’re going to need to write this down.” She smiles and leans forward ready to relay the information. Castiel grabs one and a scrap of paper. He listens attentively to her instructions, the smile on his face growing as she writes. He could do this.
“He put up good fight.” the Russian answered in broken English. “Good actor.”
“You have got to be kidding me!” he shouts. As he bends down to grab the keys the door to Cas’ opens up and his neighbor’s head sticks out into the hall.
Even if Dean knew that it was just the bottle talking, that when they lost their Mom, they kinda lost their Dad too it didn’t make it hurt any less. Those words sank in and take root inside of Dean. If it weren’t for Sam and Charlie, chances were Dean would have turned out just like his old man. A drunk, making his way to an early grave and croaking it before he turned 45. He was on that way before Charlie showed up in his life if he was being honest with himself, not even Sam was going to save him.
Dean watches it.
“Yes.”
“What’ll it be today?” his eyes darted between the brother.
The girls were shedding their snow jackets, shoes and hats. The snow had gotten into their clothes. Dean shrugged off his own jacket, hanging it on the back of a chair. He picked his shivering daughter up into his arm. “You’re freezing, why didn’t you say anything sooner?”
Time seemed non-existent.
He looked up, wild eyes boring into him, sweat gathering in Dean’s hair line, down the side of his neck. Cas’ fingers twitched to touch, and his tongue suddenly intrigued to find out what Dean’s sweat tasted like. He could feel Dean’s hot breath on his face, making his lashes flutter a little. They were being swayed by the crowd, being pushed closer and closer till there was nowhere else to go, chest to chest, groin to groin. He tried to push away, not wanting to freak Dean out more with his semi till he felt Dean’s own on his thigh. Cas caught his breath, feeling the length of it against him. Memories flooded his drunken brain of Dean’s cock, how it fitted so perfectly in his hand.
“Sorry.” He says.
The hand touched his hip, silently telling him to turn over which he did. He was about to speak when his mouth was sealed with another. Morning breathe and all. Dean wanted to say he pulled away but who was he kidding, kissing Cas was the best and even with his internal freak out going on somehow kissing Cas dimmed it just for a moment. Their tongues passed each other’s, exploring and it felt like Cas was trying to pull out all of Dean’s worries.
That didn’t stop Dean’s stomach doing a nice 180 when he saw Cas’ name pop up on his screen.
Dean slipped his fingers into Cas’ waistband of his trousers and shimmied them down without any protest from the man underneath him. Cas’ unashamed, unself-conscious attitude only added to the attraction Dean had for him.
Cas shrugged, taking a sip of his water to swallow his food. “Not sure, I’ve attached my PayPal to our account so when the money comes in, I’ll let you know.”
Dean wanted it, his complete attention on Dean, just
“What?”
“Dammit Cas, you can’t expect me to have a conversation when you’re doing
“For you?” he places the glasses of prepared drinks onto the bar. Cas nods. Dean hadn’t been wrong about his beer choice. He hopes his spirit choice also holds true. He reaches for a bottle of bourbon and triple sec and fashions Cas an apple sour. Dean pours it into an old-fashioned glass from the cocktail shaker and adds it to the line of drinks for Cas.
Gabriel takes a swig of his coffee and grimaces on the bitterness of it.
“Come in.” he closes his email window on his computer. Jessica comes in. The usual effortless smile on her face isn’t there.
“Cas, I…” his voice cut off as Cas felt Dean’s boxers dampen. His quiet orgasm spasming his body slightly in front of Cas. Words like
A desire that needed fulfilling over a week ago.
“No loitering you three, move it.” A guard told them. Dean walked on. Showers were not leisurely things. They went in, washed and got the fuck out of there before anything could happen. The guards hated working the showers. It was hard to see with the steam. Stabbings were known to happen and everything else you could imagine. It was a minefield.
“You’re not going to let me read, are you?”
Sam spotted Dean. He stood up off the bench and walked towards his brother. Sam didn’t stop walking till he ran his body into Dean’s, winding him a little.
“You’re not going to let me read, are you?”
“Have you been watching gay porn Dean?”
“You sure you don’t want somethin’ stronger than a beer? Your friends will be hospitalized before you even get tipsy man.” He adds ice into the glass as he talks. He feels Cas’ eyes on him, pushes him to add some flare and moves around the bar to get the vodka and rum. He turns the two spirit bottles upside down in one hand to fill the glasses.
The Russian looked pleased. He brought his messed hand up to his mouth to taste Dean’s cum. One finger at a time he cleaned them while Dean caught his breath back and returned to earth. The walls he used to protect himself in Purgatory were back up and fully operational.
“Have a little fun,” Dean replied. “Didn’t realise I needed your permission.”
Unknowing when his roommate would be returning Dean decided to do this in his bedroom, on the other side of the living space to Cas’. The rooms were pretty much identical, double bed shoved to one side, desk filled with textbooks at the bottom of it, wardrobe, chest of drawers to the side. It was all non-descript and functional. He had his record player in here, along with a photo of he and Sammy but other than that he kept it basic.
” Cas nipped Dean’s neck, “Want whatever you give me.”
Cas chuckled. “Something like that.”
out of safety, paper, paints, cups with water and different shaped sponges arranged neatly, for now. Claire was holding out two tops, they looked like Cas’ that were covered in paint splatters.
He tried not to think too much about how Cas was so sure that Benny would be willing for sex on the first date and put his phone down to drive off, not wanting to be late. The nerves had settled, thanks to Cas. Also, there was a part of him that was more eager for a blowjob if it meant he got to tell Cas about it. Again, he tried not to think too much about that either.
“I got something on my face, don’t I?”
Dean was about to chew his shoe he was that hungry.
When Cas came up from behind and saved him.
he mimicked his brothers’ puppy lovesick tone. Sam rolled his eyes. “Yeah, you’re going to need to fill me in on all of this.” he waved his hand over his brother and his radiating tenderness for the new Russian.
Saturday morning, he headed to the showers.
He wrapped an arm around Cas’ waist and breathed the life back into himself.
“I can still remember the first lecture he ever gave. He was talking about the ultimate story we can tell is the lives we have lived and continue to live,” Jess smiles thinking back to that memory. “That our stories mattered, that we were interesting enough to make someone want to read what we had to say if we wrote from within. Our dreams, our imagination, our experiences are all worthwhile and not to be afraid to use it when story telling.”
Dean kicks the ground, churning up dirt that rest on his boots. He groans into his hands then screams into the air because there is not much else, he can do. This boy. This boy would be the end of him one day, he’s sure of it.
“You said don’t hit on the Moms nothing about the Dads.” Gabriel pointed out.
“What do you want me to do?” Dean asked.
“What?” He snaps. He doesn’t mean to. Cas stiffens up, tries to loosen his hand after being stung, but Dean doesn’t let him go, he doesn’t want Cas to let go. They keep on walking.
“When it comes to monogamy yes, but he is a good Father to Claire.”
Cas went cold then, he stepped back from Dean and readjusted himself, taking off his hoodie to wrap around his waist to hide the wet patch from the public. Dean didn’t move, head hanging low and trying to catch his breath back. His shoulders looked relaxed.
“I’m cold.”
be quiet.” Dean takes the paper, careful about their hands not to touch like earlier. He settles himself better beside Castiel, drops his other knee and crosses his legs. Their body language now mirrored.
“Shit Cas,” Dean grunted, hips bucking a little under his touch. He couldn’t move much with the weight of Cas in his lap and Cas enjoyed that. Smirking at Dean’s failed attempts to fuck into his hand. He let his head roll back to revel in the touch and pace Cas was hell bent on setting. Slow and steady, like the Russian was trying to memorise every twitch or move Dean made depending on what he did. Cas pressed his thumb into his slit.
He didn’t need fifteen minutes. He didn’t even need ten. Cas gave him one hell of a bone shattering blow job. It was full of filth and skill and Cas’ mouth was so hot and his tongue so attentive and Cas didn’t have a gag reflex and took Dean so deep in his throat that Dean saw stars on the ceiling. Dean kept his hands embedded in Cas’ mass of darkness, pulling, pushing and tugging on the strands as he sang Cas’ name over and over and over. He came with a cry, loud enough because there was no one around that would hear him and Cas ate him up.
He blushed seeing how much he let go, the frantic nature of him chasing Cas’ hand and arching into the other than was massaging his balls. Jesus, he looked like he loved it.
When Cas was done, he touched Dean, telling him to move. He did, barely, just enough to get higher up the bed so he wasn’t hanging off the end of it. Dean rubbed his head into the pillow, content and sated, sleep slowly creeping up on him. The thought of having to go back to his room and leave Cas ached him.
“I heard your old man got put down today,” it was Gordon. His voice was low as he leaned into Dean’s space. Dean ignored him, kept walking into the crowd that was exiting the yard. Gordon stayed glued to his side though, clearly not done antagonizing Dean.
As the orgasm hit its crescendo something sinister stirred in Cas. The show, although fun to watch was desperately missing his participation in it. He lifted his hand to a book, using his index finger to push it down and make it crash onto the floor. Thud. It caused the other two to separate from each other instantly, fear spreading on their faces as they looked down the aisle to see a book on the ground and Cas staring at them with a smirk on his face.
Dean grabbed his brother, pulled him back to give Cas and the others space to get to the window. He watched Cas wipe the blood off of his hand as he walked then handed it back to Balthazar. His fist was cut from the force of his hits. Dean was hesitant to speak with others around, with his brother around.
She sounded fierce, not to be messed with but a fair leader. Anna reminded Dean a little like Cas in that way. They seemed suited to one another. Cas spoke so fondly of her as a person as well as a boss.
Dean moves then, breaking from his mouth and peppers Castiel’s jaw, his neck, his chest in kisses as Castiel attempts to get his breath back. He feels Dean suck on his collarbone, pulling the skin into his mouth in such an obscene fashion Castiel lets a curse slip out.
He looked down between them, noticed Cas was hard in his trousers too. He moved his hand around, been thinking about touching Cas’ cock since his little display earlier. Cas stopped him, other hand on Dean’s wrist. He lifted his head to Cas, the slight worry on his face made Dean think that Cas thought he was doing it out of obligation, something Cas didn’t want. He only wanted Dean to do it if Dean wanted to, which he did. He definitely did want to get his hand on his cock, rip an orgasm out of him as hard as Cas did to him.
“You’re shaking Dean,” Cas held his chin gently. “I’m worried I’ve somehow caused this.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“I want you to take me to bed.”
“That was such a teacher response.”
Then someone spoke, “Leave, before I skin you with that shiv in your hand.”
They caught their breath, taking two of three breathes each then Dean hit his forehead against Cas’. It was sweet, head nuzzling in their mushy afterglows. Cas tilted his head to kiss Dean once more before he had to leave to shut off the live feed.
“It’s cool man."
“Alright then, I’ll bite. Where were you?” he asked then he remembered Russian’s never handed out things for free, he had the fine print to deal with before he landed himself in hot water again. “Wait, you’re giving me this information because you want to, right?” Cas looked at him attentively as Dean continued to explain himself. “Balthazar aint gonna come knocking for me to do something for you again cause if that’s the case, you can keep your damn secrets Cas.” That came out stronger than he intended.
“Dean.” Cas replies, as if he hadn’t been with him all this time, as if he hadn’t seen him in years. His hand reaches up to touch Dean’s face, his cold palm brushes Dean’s stubbled cheek. It’s so soft and tender. Dean’s gut twists, he’s not used to touches like that. Touches that reach further than his skin. He lets out the breath he’s been holding, it flutters Cas’ lashes. He wants to sink into this bed with Cas, but Cas is drunk, and Dean won’t do it. When he does it, if he lets himself do it as soft and tender as Cas’ touch, he wants Cas to remember it too. He leans back.
and Cas couldn’t help but smirk into his arm, but Dean was getting a move on. The sound of the wrapper tearing brought a hidden smile to his face. He was safe here between his arms. Here Dean didn’t have to see how much Cas wanted this.
“What about it?’ he asks pulling at it a little just to tease. He wants to know, everything in Cas’ mind he wants to know. The man is so quiet, his brain must be filled with so much. Is it filled with Dean? What he wants to do to Dean? What he wants Dean to do to him? Cas doesn’t answer.
He didn’t want this. He didn’t want to get raped, beaten and left for dead. He was losing energy fast though, the adrenaline exhausting him. Sweat covered his body mixing with the bright red strips of blood and he knew he was done for. No one was coming for him.
“Chin up Dean, sulking only going to make you look weaker,” Bobby told him.
“You’re saying yes?” Cas checked, watching his friend take the whiskey from the cupboard.
“Trending!” Dean shouted. A few people turned to them, making Dean blush at his over excitement to the situation at hand. “You serious?” he whispered.
Next was Cas. She touched his shoulder. There was a pause. “Eh, what was it again Daddy?” she turned her head around to look at Dean. He scoffed, broke character and got down beside her to whisper it in her ear again. Cas’ blue eyes squinting and full of curiosity.
Dean turned down the volume on the TV. “You want to do this over the phone?”
Cas looked up at his brother with furrowed brows. “What?”
Dean hadn’t asked about the money since the third video. The facts were there.
“Well look what the cat dragged in,” Gabriel puts his hands out wide. “Haven’t seen your faces here in days, I was beginning to think the worst.”
____________________________
Dean lets Castiel out of the lift first.
He liked the girth of it. They were matching somewhat in length department however Cas’ cock made Dean’s jaw ache in all the right ways. The weight of it too and how it felt in Dean’s mouth, taking up space like it lived in there. The word cockslut suddenly coming to mind. He kinda was, at least for Cas’. His mouth salivated and yeah, he wanted a taste, fuck the video. He needed to satisfy this hunger.
“Not many opportunities with a four-year-old to look after.” he said returning back to Cas’ conversation about how Dean isn’t having much of a sex life. Conversations he never really thought he’d be having with Cas. They kept it to the kids, the pre-school and work. This was a level up conversation, pals to friend’s conversation if they had been on a video game. Dean seriously needed to get laid if he’s comparing conversations in real life to video games.
Cas raised his ring finger, showing Dean a tattoo of a circle with a dot inside. “Sirota.”
When Cas’ body left his side, Dean flipped himself to lie on his stomach. He nestled his head into his pillow, arms coming up to wrap around it for support. Taking a few breathes he sank himself further into this space. He heard the sound of his door locking and then the bed dipped behind him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas leaned closer into him, his other hand resting above Dean’s head. “What I give you.”
“You’re looking for aisle four.” One of the staff members said. He followed the voice, seeing her stack other paint sets onto shelves. The girl made no attempt to hide the fact she was checking Dean out. Eyes darting from the top of him, to the bottom and back up. He was flattered, always good to know he’s still got it even with a four-year-old hanging out of his arm trying to pull him along because they were as usual running late. He got checked out without Charlie, rarely got checked out with Charlie.
Cas gave him everything he wanted and then some.
Dean watched him walk with heavy eyes, the shiv that was on his throat Cas slipped into his waist band, his tawny skin peeking out with some more ink there too.
When he gets to drawing Dean’s boxers, he sees that Dean is actually wearing Cas’. He smiles to himself, enjoying the slow warmth that realisation creates in him. Once Dean finishes his couple of cigarettes, he’s ready to go again, taking Cas’ pad from his hands and dragging him back to bed.
Dean had to put his fist in his mouth to stop a moan that was dying to be heard.
Dean took a sip of his beer, focusing on the bubbles in his mouth rather than the swell of emotion he always got whenever Sam said something about his daughter. Sam never minced his words. The sincere one out of the two of them. If Sam thought Charlie would be alright, Dean believed him. “It’s like you’re in my mind sometimes Sammy, I swear.”
“One more time! You promised!” she shouted back. Damn, she was right. He had promised, promised her four goes on the slide if she let him tie her red mane of hair up. She hated having her hair tied back, liked it wild and free but rules were rules apparently. Charlie had only been at the pre-school a couple of months and she’d been sent home with the clothing and hair criteria
Alastair was unmoving in his stance.
The guard, Zachariah, did the count, passing them clicking the clicker in his hand and eyeing them up.
Dean sighed, kicked off the blanket he was lying under and hopped down from his bunk. His bare feet came into contact with the concrete floor. Cas wasn’t lying on the bed, he was sitting up, back to the wall and kneels tucked under his chest. He looked small, smaller than Dean’s ever seen him. His hair a mess from tugging at it presumably. Arms wrapped around his knees holding him tight.
How can he say that to Gabriel without sounding like a crazy person? He doesn’t.
He feels Dean chuckle, it vibrates his chest. Arms come around and pull Cas closer, till their chest to chest and there’s no space between them just like Cas wants it, needs it. He breathes in Dean’s scent, leather and stale smoke and pine because that’s his shower gel and Dean showered in Cas’ this morning. It smells like home. His new home.
Cas was looking at Dean like he hadn’t eaten a meal in weeks. It made Dean gulp audibly.
“Was I good?”
“I told you if you ever touched me again…”
“Papers.” Castiel replies. Do not look up, don’t do it. He’s hoping the short answers will let Dean know he doesn’t want to talk.
Sam had his jacket ready for him. Great, now he was feeling reluctant to leave her. That worrying feeling in the pit of his stomach that something bad was going to happen. Was it irrational? Yes. Did that matter? Apparently not.
“You know what that means,” Cas waited for Dean to respond. He didn’t give one. “I thought you didn’t want to be a…”
“What makes him so special?” Dean wants to know, maybe it’ll give some clues as to why Dean finds him so interesting, there is just something underneath Cas that Dean wants to figure out. He knows he’s drawn to him, like when Cas looks at him, really looks at him and Dean’s mouth would go all dry and then there’s the other part, where he’s innocent and kind of adorable when Dean makes him a little flustered. He feels there’s still more, like he got the previews, he’s in, now he wants the main event.
It wasn’t till the day before Thanksgiving that they both could get away from their kids, over a week since their conversation. Over a week of standing in the pre-school yard, a week of playdates and having to keep his hands to himself. It was torturous to say the least. Claire was spending Thanksgiving with her other Dad meaning Cas had a free house. It was sort of hilarious, felt like being back at high school sneaking around behind parents but they were doing it with their kids.
It excited Cas, knowing that Dean’s voice cracked already and yet he hadn’t even begun what he had in store for him, it made him jump ahead to all the sinful noises he’d get from Dean, all the begging and pleading and Cas wouldn’t give it up, not till he was sure that he had him and no one else would touch him ever again.
“Fine, such a spoil sport,” Meg tugged on his arm to make sure he heard the next words to come out of her mouth, “But be careful my angel ok? He might be up for moving some furniture around with you on the internet but that doesn’t mean he’s ready for the real world to see how you make him feel.”
He didn’t ask though. Cas gave him something else to think about for the time being.
“Oh, can it Jess and eat your damn burrito,” Dean says. He feels a warm hand squeezing his thigh under the table. That also assures him. “It’s not like Cas is some dried-up old bastard like Sam’s professors.”
“You lying?”
He was glad for the Autumn chill. Meant the fists he was making were hidden in his jacket pockets. The fake smile had dropped.
Dean took the cup off the table to do something with his hands. He was well aware he had a temper, especially when people he cared for were hurt by others. “I’ll take your word for it.” He mumbled.
Cas wasn’t going to save him this time.
Gabriel hung out with them for a bit, retelling tales of his adventures in South America, specifically the numerous orgies he attended. Half of the time Cas wasn’t sure to believe him. They were completely outrageous though they were those kinds of stories that due to them being so outrageous they were probably true. If anyone could attend an orgy that involved two sets of twins, it would be Gabriel.
He could have blamed the alcohol, or the fact that he knew that their heating was going to get shut off again for the second time this year if they didn’t think of something quick. His friend looked over at him, head tilting trying to understand the smile that was making its way onto Dean’s face, then he clocked what he was insinuating.
Dean paused his kisses, pulling away to look at Cas underneath him. His lips parted, chest rising and falling steadily, eyes searching for the answer in Dean’s questioning break.
This lasts about three weeks before Castiel decides he needs to be brave and do something about it. On his calendar is a meeting with Jessica and he takes the opportunity to bring up Dean. She never brings up that night, Castiel appreciates it. He is going to have to in order to figure out how to get past the concrete wall that was Dean’s anger. She knocks on his office door.
Sam made it sound so easy. Maybe it was easy. Maybe it didn’t have to be complicated.
“Why do you want to see my office?”
“I’m calling it a night.” His brother stretched in front of him. The lurch grew more inches over the years, filled out more, hair behind his ears instead of over his face. He can still see his little brother in there sometimes. The years hadn’t been kind to them. Purgatory weathered them more than they liked to admit at times.
The words meant more to Dean than Cas would ever know.
“You have a second Professor?” she asks. The weight of academia on her shoulders.
Gabriel brought them up dinner. It was all rather civil, friendly even and when Dean left around 8pm Cas couldn't help notice how empty his room felt.
Cas nodded. “True, I can only indulge when Claire is at her other Dad’s house.”
John wasn’t buying it. “Someone Castiel has been seeing for a few months now and you don’t know him that well?”
The fourth time they have sex Cas rides Dean for all he’s worth, hands scrambling for purchase on Dean’s sweated shoulder blades and his face buried in the crook of Dean’s neck. Dean’s matching every thrust, one hand to steady himself on the bed, the other wrapped around Cas and he’s spewing a litany of curses that are getting more incoherent the harder Cas goes.
“Next time you land yourself down here Dean, I’ll forget you even exist and let you rot till your decomposing body is smelled all the way in gen pop. Do I make myself clear?” Shurley, the warden, man who ran the whole prison from his ivory heavenly tower warned.
More, he wanted more, needed more.
He could now. Drunken Cas was always up for new things with Dean, wanting to show him the finer things in life, like frottage. Cas moved closer, getting the angle right for Dean, thankful they were the same height to pull his off. “Give me your hand.” It was presented to him immediately, palm up. He smiled at how receptive Dean was to his orders, made him think of all the other things he could get Dean to do, how far did that submission go? Thoughts for later. Pulling what spit he had in his mouth, he dropped it into Dean’s hand. “Ok, that should be enough.”
“Move!” Cas tried to bark but came out more like a plea.
He catches Cas stumble to unlock his door. They turn down the music and Dean has to resist the urge to get Jess to tell him everything on Professor Novak.
He slept amazingly, best night’s sleep in a long time, curled up with Cas and his strong arms holding Dean close to him. His sex haze not giving a crap, needing to be close to Cas and looked after. Dean remembered reading something about after-care before in his Sex and Psychology module in first year. Subs needing to closeness after being overly stimulated to avoid dropping into an emotionally vulnerable state.
Cas put the glasses into the sink. “Better?”
Thing was, Dean had all day. He was one year into his sentence, a whole lot more to go. Dean had so many days in here he wasn’t even gonna try counting. For now, he was just gonna try to not get sent back to Empty.
He watched Dean get up on the bed, moving on his knees slowly careful not to knock the laptop around too much. His approach had Cas’ body spiking with heat. His neglected cock asking for touch already. The likely hood of this lasting their usual five minutes was optimistic at best. Dean moved between Cas’ parted legs, sitting back on his calves not saying a word. He was nervous. Perhaps Cas over-estimated Dean’s willingness to try new things. He sat up on his elbows, making his way to a sitting position. “We don’t have to—”
“Okay, a lot.”
“Yeah, I was in the Empty for a few days, so didn’t recognise you was all.” Dean replied trying to keep his voice neutral. Don’t show weakness, don’t show anything other than neutral and angry.
He ran a hand over it. His body twitched with wanting to sink into it, wanting the weight of Cas on top of him pushing him into the softness of the brush cotton sheets.
Cas took a grip of the top of Dean’s hair, taking a fist of it to keep him in place. He was used to submissive, pliant Dean, well this wasn’t what they were used to. Dean pushed Cas back. He stumbled. Dean pushed again, and again till Cas hit the back of the couch and Dean pounced on him, attaching himself to Cas’ neck, biting hard.
Cas nodded, also leaning in to continue the conversation. “We’re trending.”
“You ok Claire?” Cas asked, wanting to check in with her daughter.
It always did when the sun was out.
“I know dude,” he looked down again. “I’m full of them.”
Cas took both Dean’s hands, placing them above his head.
“Shit, yeah the orphanage.” Dean scratches the back of his head again. Castiel has deciphered he does this when he’s anxious or aroused, often two emotions overlapped.
Cas got the privilege of not caring what people thought about it, they were so beneath him it made no difference in his life. Dean was bottom of the barrel. He was only a year into his sentence. What people thought about him mattered, he was still building some kind of a reputation for himself. This rumour was going to set him back on top of the fact he wasn’t allowed to react to other inmates. The threat of being sent to the Empty still there.
“Me too.” Sam agreed.
They walk back in silence, a comfortable distance apart. Some students greet Castiel as he walks, some faculty members too. The English building is grand and old. Dean gapes as it as they walk into the main entrance. He stops walking, assuming Dean will leave now.
Cas chuckled, shutting off the feed and closing the laptop. He crawled back to Dean who was cleaning himself up. Cas took the cloth to take over, wiping Dean down as best as he could. They’d need to shower, later. For now, he wanted to wrap Dean up and hold him close which Dean welcomed.
“You really got me!” they all shout.
Dean hadn’t brought it up and he brought up the last one. Now that he thought about it, Cas brought up the first one. Did that mean that Dean had been waiting for Cas to bring it up? Some unspoken game that he fell into he didn’t recognise till this moment.
“It’s you and me and Claire and Cas.” Charlie pointed out the figures. Yeah, Dean could see it. Two purple people and two blue people. He also noticed that the two-purple people, the taller ones were joined at the end of their stick arms. They were holding hands. Dean didn’t know what to make of that externally, internally his heart was clenching, and his stomach was doing somersaults like it didn’t know what hit him but on the outside, he was unsure what to portray. “We’re eh…” he showed it to Cas who had come in.
“Thank you, Professor. I needed that.” Jessica smiles, her tears are gone. She leaves.
Cas led him upstairs. They both stripped down and crawled under the covers. Sleep consuming them as they were wrapped up in each other’s arms.
He took the shiv started slicing Dean up with shallow cuts over his torso. He took particular interest in Dean’s stomach because it had him howling the loudest from the pain of it. Gordon took his time, figuring he had time to do whatever he wanted to Dean. Probably been biding his time for months to get Dean alone and vulnerable. Dean had been too focused on Alastair he never gave Gordon much of a second thought after their last run in during free time.
“Look, I’m sorry Cas, please…” Dean pleaded. His heart beat rang in his ears.
“Great, see you tomorrow then?” Dean slotted the invite into his back pocket.
“Huh?”
A shaky breath left his mouth when he felt Cas put his palm in the center of Dean’s stomach. It was warm and strong, and somehow Dean was convinced in that moment Cas’ touch could heal him of just about anything. That the cuts on his body would close up instantly and any wounds on his mind would be wiped clean. He believed it so much that when he closed his eyes, he could swear he felt a warmth wash over him as Cas moved his hand around his body. His soft touch sealing up the cuts and his fingers erasing any imprint Gordon left on his body.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Morning maggots,” He had his trade mark shit eating grin on his face. Still not allowed to step out of line Dean nodded in his general direction. “What no good morning back?”
Dean’s at the auto-shop, doing what he usually does, fixing cars, talking to Benny and trying not to piss off Bobby too much. The last part doesn’t go too well, he’s whistling underneath a car he’s working on and gets a kick in the ankle. He can see the boot and knows the culprit it belongs to.
They don’t talk much but it’s not awkward. Sometimes Dean will spot something that reminds him of when he was young and he tells Cas with ease, wants to tell Cas about himself. The more Cas knows, the easier for him to understand and he wants to Cas to be able to understand Dean like one of his stories. The park he got drunk in with Ash, the cross roads he was in a fender bender before he was legally allowed to drive, the old cinema now a nightclub where he’d bring girls on dates. His life etched into the concrete blocks of this place. Cas listens, a fond look on his face as Dean speaks.
“The ladies love the hair man.” Ash runs his hand through his mullet. It hadn’t changed in the twenty odd years Dean knew him. Their Dads were regulars at the Roadhouse. They’d sit in a booth in the corner doing their homework together and figure out ways to prank Sam. His Mom was a lover of the 80’s and when she died, he vowed to never change it. So yeah, everyone else thought it was for the ladies. Dean knew it was just for one particular lady.
“Alright, four times. You’re done kiddo.” He said defiantly. Charlie huffed into his shoulder but complied. They worked on deals, bargains, bribes and that worked both ways. He knew how to get her to do things just as she knew how to get him to do things. Charlie had Dean buying her the coconut shampoo she loved for the small price of not leaving her building bricks everywhere for him to step on. He hated coconut but it was worth it for the sake of his feet. Lego were the devils work. Two peas in a pod Dean and Charlie were.
Dean knocks on his door around eleven. He answers still in his pajamas.
And fuck did he. A hip raising, breath catching, white spots in his vision orgasm ripped from him like he was exorcised right in the middle of his bedroom. His top was ruined, his hand was covered, and he couldn’t give one damn about it because he could hear Cas cumming, every vibration from his chest crawled into Dean’s ear, finding a new home in his wank bank.
“I’m 35 next month.” Cas answered.
Yay, they're ok again, kinda...?
– this I’ve wanted, really wanted when you were telling me about fucking that guy and...” he was cut off with Cas’ hand finding his nipple, he groaned, craning his head back to lift his chest up higher chasing the hand that was moving away. Such a damn insufferable tease.
Had to start somewhere right?
Dean pulled his keys out of the ignition and was about to get out when Cas stopped him. He tugged Dean back and his lover went, falling back onto his lap. Tired green eyes looked up at him. Cas ran a hand through Dean’s hair then caressed the side of his cheek.
“Give Castiel what he wants.”
Yeah, this was a terrible idea.
“Dean.” Sam’s concerned voice echoed out from the cell. He couldn’t look at his brother, choosing to walk away and climb the stairs to his own cell. It was like he was psyching himself up for it with each step he took, hands gripped tight onto the bannisters as he went. He passed the Russians outside their cells, eyes on him, quiet murderous smiles on their faces. Cas wasn’t with him which meant he was probably in his cell, waiting for Dean.
Cas broke the kiss. “Dean,” he pulled back, voice disconcerting.
“I was going to get a cloth,” Castiel replies. “Unless you want to shower.”
"They're not wrong," he mumbled, a little shy. "Are they?"
He put his hand out, clasped it in Cas’ and shook. It was done. Dean was offically owned.
Dean crossed the road in a hurry knowing he might have to jog some of the way back home. He hoped Bobby was too hungover to give him an ear full for being late again.
To call the atmosphere between them awkward would have been an understatement.
“You can watch,” Cas said, slightly hissing as he pushed in some more, “if you want.”
“Crowley.” Dean nodded. Crowley managed to get himself one of the best work details there. Everyone wanted to work commissary. The English inmate refused to tell anyone why he was in there made everyone think it was something bad. Dean assumed it was for something stupid and he was too embarrassed to say it. The guy was sleezy and had eyes everywhere, he wasn’t a part of any gang, but he did own most of the sex workers in Purgatory. Kept one with him in the commissary to run around collecting the things, this week it was Masters, a favourite among Dean’s particular block. Crowley had the guy out to flaunt him no doubt, get the guys in his block thirsty for whatever Master had to offer.
Cas smirked and handed his hand over. Dean took it carefully, brought it close to him to inspect it. Most of the stained blood was gone now. It wasn’t that bad all things considered. The other guy was sent to the infirmary, broken nose, teeth missing, fractured cheek. He would live and he wouldn’t talk to a Russian like that ever again.
“Dean.” Cas’ voice was particularly deep this evening.
“I didn’t kill him for them.” Cas handed Dean back the piece of paper. He lay down behind Dean, one hand behind his head, the other on his bare chest. “I killed him for you.”
It was easy enough to tell who belonged where. Folk Nation, an all-black prison gang, aggressive, intimating by their stature usually in for drugs and weapons. Aryan Brotherhood, white as fuck usually skinheads with a Nazi symbol or five plastered on their bodies, most of them meth heads and bat shit crazy tended to be in for human trafficking or drugs. The Bratva, Russian gang, cold, collected, ruthless when provoked, tattoos etching their bodies too but less obvious than the Aryan. People speculated what their sentences were for, not that they’d ever say for certain. Dean had his money on them being in Purgatory for money laundering or racketeering, though chances were their list of illegal activity was endless. The Russians were next level bad news.
His friend chuckled darkly.
“Bobby, I’m taking my break!” he calls out not waiting for Bobby respond. He walks out of the shop with Sam and Jess towards his car, so they can lean on it to eat and put their food on it. Dean keeps her pristine, people could eat their food off of her. Dean has eaten food off her, granted he wasn’t sober at the time.
He stood outside of his cell for count. Cas climbed the stairs, shoulders tense, anger radiating off of him. The closer he got to Dean the more Dean could see how his usual spotless orange top was stained with what looked like splatters of tomato sauce. That didn’t make sense, they had mac and cheese for lunch and Wednesday’s dinner was meatloaf. He lined up beside Dean, eyes looked straight ahead. Dean looked down, noticed how the sauce was on his hands, in his fingernails and his knuckles were cut. Yeah, that wasn’t tomato sauce.
This wasn’t play, Cas wanted Dean in whatever way he chose to be.
Dean pulled a face. “Excuse me?”
The Russians advanced in sync as did the brothers. Dean took the first hit. It was too easy. Cas didn’t even try to protect himself from it. Cas wiped the side of his mouth, slowly turning it into a grin. Dean realised that was the first time he’d touch the Russian. He’d laugh if he wasn’t supposed to be angry but if anything, he was thinking he was gonna enjoy this. It had been too long since he’d hit something and if Cas was letting him, then why waste the opportunity.
“Wow, and you still have all your teeth?”
Cas let go of his grip, watched as Dean reached in to feel Cas. His cock twitched in Dean’s grip, hips rolling on their own accord chasing Dean’s hand. He pulled it out to get a better look at it, pink and throbbing alongside Dean’s.  “This ok?” he asked stroking it with a firm enough grip. It’s how liked it, hoped Cas did too.
“Problem Winchester?” the guard asked after hearing Dean raise his voice at his brother.
Sam had graciously decided to join he and Charlie towards the end of rec-time after spending the majority of it with Gabriel. They didn’t share a cell, so they had less time to do, well, what they needed to do. Dean refused to acknowledge his brother was fucking a Russian. He didn’t need those mental images on top of the actual view of the sex glazed look on Sam’s face as he sat down beside them.
Before Dean had a chance to give Sam a dead arm, he had rounded the car to give Cas a hug. Cas looked startled, usually was when it came to physical contact that wasn’t Dean. “Hug me back Cas,” Sam told him. Cas wrapped his arms around Sam. “There you go.”
“Hello Dean.”
“I need to talk to Ash about something, catch you losers later!” Jo walked away from them.
“Good boy.”
“Home at last, eh Cas?” he asks. Cas grumbles something. “What was that?”
Cas got off the bed, padded into the kitchen area to check their fridge. It was sparse. No surprise there. He checked the cupboards. Ramen noodles, pasta, beans and a few spices. He sent Dean back a message.
“I know.” He said.
“Are you?” Gordon ran his hand along the steel table. “Seems to me that the Russian has lost interest in you these days.”
“Everything alright?” she asked.
“Cas,” He attempted to mimic the Russian accent and failed. Dean flicked through the pages, all in Russian. Go figure. He handed the book back. “What is it? Recipe book?”
Castiel steps back, gesturing to his apartment. Jessica told him not to give his cards away too soon. Dean can’t help himself to take bait apparently. Dean doesn’t move.
“Touch me, just…get him off of me.” he clawed at his chest, wanting to shed it his skin.
“No, I’m merely checking…” he looked around, spying Dean lying down on his bed, completely relaxed, completely naked, scrolling on his phone. A far cry from the beginning of these videos. He could see the nerves roll off of Dean then and now he looked at home, where he belonged on Cas’ bed about to get fucked.
“Dean, this is Anna,” Cas introduces the woman to him. “She’s less…”
They seemed to take the lie which brought a sigh of relief to Dean. He was out of the woods.
“New Russian?”
He stared at the message.
No smut, but plot and set up for the next super smutty chapter.
“Sorry I’m late, I eh…”
Free time here had none of those things, well, he could sleep with something with a pretty smile if he was man enough to go for it. He knew he could get Cas to fuck him. The guy wanted it, that wasn’t hard to decipher but Dean still had his pride and hated that he was owned by Cas even if it was for his own good. His stubbornness was ruining any chance he had of getting laid. He had been close enough to asking for it on more than one occasion, glad he had the pillow or his fist to essentially gag himself with.
“The thunder, it took longer for us to hear so the lightning must be moving away from us.”
mid-term is next week!”
He moved his head to catch Cas’ open lips, licking them moist and delving inside without much finesse or skill. Cas broke the kiss, trying to get his breath back within the heat that was consuming them. He knew they could get off like this, just grind one out together but he didn’t want that. “Fuck me Cas, fuck me like I know you can.”
“Thought so,” He stepped over Dean to put back some of the returned books to the area Dean was hiding out in. “You do realise being his prag means you can drop the whole straight act around him.”
He passed it, moving on to Masters who was standing outside of his cell, topless, trousers slung low on his hips. Cas didn’t pause, didn’t talk to him just walked right into his cell and Masters followed in.
Once inside he shoved Dean up against the closest wall he could find, hands reaching under Dean’s top to get at his warm skin. Dean made the sweetest noises. Hands found their way to Cas’ belt, trying to take it off. He got caught up in the moment, memories of bathrooms and eagerness that he forgot he was supposed to be punishing Dean.
“You wanted to talk Cas, so talk.” Dean says staring at Castiel’s floor pensively.
Back in Cas’ bed he lay himself down on his comforter. A similar set up to their first time. This time the laptop further back, enough space for the dim lighting to not make Dean recognizable. The light on his desk was on, casting brightness to the ceiling above them therefore dimming the space they were situated. A role reversal. Dean stood at the edge of the bed, waiting for Cas to get comfortable before hitting the record button.
He didn’t have a chance to take her hand to bring her up, once out of the seat, she had already darted up the driveway, up the stairs and was banging on the front door.
He must have found a pretty mouth to soothe his anguish, whatever it was. Cas tried not to feel bitter about it.
Cas waved his hand in Dean’s face, dismissing him. “Why do you care?”
“This ok?” Cas asked.
Cas smiled because he wasn’t planning on it either.
“I don’t mind strangers watching them, hell, the more the merrier I say but Meg? People we know? It’s weird Cas! You can’t tell me you’re not a little creeped out that Meg is getting off to us getting each other off. You’re like her best friend.”
“Let it go? Let it go!” Dean pushed against his brother’s arm that was holding him in place.
She tapped the baton on her side, clearly deciding something in her mind before gesturing her head for him to come out of the cell. He obeyed, joining her outside.
.” There was a smile in his voice, like he knew Dean wasn’t going to talk.
just to make it clear what Dean had been getting at with the video. His leg bounced, waiting for his friend to notice the message and respond. He could see Cas online. What in the hell was taking him so long to open Dean’s window? A minute past before
His cock felt warm. It was salivating for Cas to have Dean like this again, pliant for him, letting Cas touch him without protest. His hips starting to move with Cas’ hand, like he wanted more but was too afraid to use his words. Cas slightly bewitched at the situation unfolding between them.
“I think I’m gonna dump them in the shower. That cool with you Cas?”
He weighs it up in his head. That professional boundary he put down would be pushed but seeing Dean would be nice, help get through the rest of his day and Dean did drive all the way out to campus for him. Be rude not to.
“And the boxes earlier?”
“If it makes you feel any better, I’m good Dean,” he gave his brother an unconvinced face. Sam put his hand on his chest. “I am. I mean sure things could have been better, the riot was touch and go for a few days, but things are more settled now, more than they have been in weeks. I mean we’re still stuck in here and it still sucks but it’s better than it was.”
“Yeah, course, go before she bites your head off and dips it in her soy latte.” Dean stepped out of Cas and Claire’s way. He did have to get to work, already cutting it close himself.
Castiel was stunned, too many thoughts and emotions running through his mind to really comprehend what he was saying. On top of that Dean had to go and call himself handsome, smoking,
He kissed Cas’ neck, slowly trialing his mouth down Cas’ bare body. Dean was still getting used to this closeness, how he didn’t really have to account for breasts because Cas didn’t have any. He had nipples though and Dean tested their sensitivity, sucking them into his mouth.
“You gotta admit, was kinda fun.” He tried to smile, it stung. Sam rolled his eyes, but Dean saw through it, his brother loved fighting as much as he did. Underneath that good guy wrong place façade he liked to portray he was programmed just like Dean. A good fight made them feel alive.
He shot Cas a message asking if everything was ok.
“Me too Cas,” he admitted. “I tried to forget about it, forget about you, went on a date with a woman just to forget but…”
He knew he was being bossy, kinda sassy and downright needy but fuck it, he didn’t care. He needed this like half an hour ago. Deciding to take matters into his own hands, literally speaking he grabbed his semi over his trousers. Cas dropped his eyes to it. Fuck he loved that kind of attention from Cas. Rolling his hips, he watched Cas’ mouth slightly part like his breath got caught in his throat.
And it didn’t take long for Cas to pick up on it, his hands started to move further down Dean’s back, kneading into the top of Dean’s ass. Dean hid his head in the pillow, trying to hide the pink on his cheeks from the Russian and muffle of his moan. There was nothing straight about this, literally nothing about getting off to a guy who had his hands on your ass.
“Yes, I’m gathering that.” He could feel the smile between his chest.
Cas listens, sitting in the space between Dean’s spread legs.
He turned to look at the guard. She was from Hell and new. He sighed, pointing to the pile of clothes beside him. “Pair of boxers and a top are missing. Probably still stuck in a dryer or something, it’s happened before.”
Dean scoffed, he hadn’t even finished that sentence though he was going to go with something along the lines of ‘incredible’ or ‘insane’, both were good descriptions of what just happened. He took a few more breathes in euphoria before coming back down to earth.
Cas raised his head to see Dean standing a few feet away from him, cigarette in hand, jacket collar turned up to keep the cold out. That it was particularly cold, the wind still had a chill though. He looked relax, not like what he appeared earlier.
His studio apartment was bigger than his car, he’ll give it that and bigger than most of the motel rooms he slept in over the years. The windows were big, brought in a lot of light. His kitchen was operational, one of the counters had stools underneath to function as a table. The furniture the old tenant left wasn’t all that bad either just needed some rearranging. He never had a place of his own, so he was making the most of it. Dean needed his bed by the window and his sofa between the bed and the kitchen to distinguish the areas. Cooking, chilling and sleeping, done. He bought a stereo system his first day back in the thrift store and brought up some of his tapes from Baby (his car) to play.
He scrambled inelegantly to the top of the bed, hands wrapping around the wooden bed head to steady himself. Cas was close behind him, the feel of his body pressed against his was heavenly. Dean let his head roll back onto Cas’ shoulder as his hands moved around the front of Dean, leaving trails of lube in his wake.
He had been keeping things from Sam. Trying to tell himself he was doing it to keep Sam’s mind at ease when probably it was more to avoid the judgement and concern his brother would give him. His attraction towards Cas was something he kept inside the cell, clearly the Russian didn’t have the same sentiments if his minions were picking up on it.
Reference to rape/sexual assault, actual sexual assault, graphic depictions of violence, flash backs, panic attacks.
. Cas shook his head smiling at his friend for his sudden need to feel like they were actors in a show. His humour eased Cas. Dean’s ability to make Cas laugh pulled him out of most of his anxiety. It shouldn’t have surprised him that he could do it in this situation as well.
So much for some lighthearted sex without the extra baggage.
The phone cuts dead.
Dean appreciated it. “Thanks man.”
He fell in line with his brother, heading towards the Warden’s office.
“You better not puke.” He mutters and starts up the engine. It’s a quick drive to their place and when he’s on the road he runs a hand through Cas’ hair as he winds through the empty enough streets of his home town.
“Have you found love in the shape of a dominatrix Dean-o?” Jo joked.
“Bring Dean-o here around back, show him the pies.” Gabriel gestures towards the kitchen. Cas’ tries to hide his smile, looking at the floor instead of Dean, the chance to get some time with Dean while at work is a nice surprise. “The cuties and I will sort the other stuff.”
He wanted to say that he gave Cas the biggest glare of his life but he’d be lying, no, instead he looked at his friend longing, earnest, blissed out and vulnerable because he’d give him anything he wanted as long as he got to cum with Cas’ hand on his cock.
They were alone. At last.
“Bingo. Ten points to the stud in the lumber jack flannel.” Gabriel shouts like a game show host. He gets up out of his chair and stumbles ungraciously. Balthazar is out of his chair quick to lend Gabriel a hand.
“I don’t know Cas,” he scratched the back of his neck. “I don’t even know if I like the guy.”
He released himself from Cas’ back once the kitchen opened up and less bodies were around them to hide what he had been doing. Cas turned to him, curious to see the look on his face. Dean winked and then was attacked by fellow classmates, lifting Dean up into the air to celebrate the end of exams. Someone threw their arms around Cas too, Balthazar already drunk and pulling Cas away from Dean to have a shot with him. Cas went, he’d get to Dean at some point during the night for the fun he had spoken about.
“To me, yeah,” Sam handed him a book that was near the section he was in. “I’ve known you my whole life Dean. The only other time I’ve seen you look at someone like you look at Cas was Lisa.”
“You freakin’ pinched me?!” he licks his lips and leaves them agape.
Yeah, Dean was well aware of how this was sounding and coming across. He knew he lost it last time someone thought Dean was Cas’ prag. The shame and embarrassment of it wrecked him and it wasn’t even true, now it would be true. Now, everyone would know.
He showed Benny his car. The man practically drooled over it. His southern drawl was enticing to Dean. He drove around for a bit, listening to classic rock tunes that Benny enjoyed. His voice sounded even better when he sang and when he put his hand on the back of the seat, letting his thumb touch the hairs on Dean’s neck he knew he was in some memory rejogging as Cas put it.
Dean waits for him after his run. He’s sitting on Cas’ bed, already stripped down to his boxers and he has this look on his face that tells Cas he’s up to something and Cas
It had a been few days since Cas tried to slit his throat, nothing more had happened since. That didn’t stop Dean from thinking about it. He thought about it at work, in bed, in the shower, you got the drift. Cas’ hands left an imprint in his brain, on his body. When he ran his own hands through it, it just never satisfied him. He never thought he’d be seeking out the hands of a Russian gang member on him but damn, he kinda was, not that he’d ever admit that aloud, ever, to anyone, not even to the Russian and his magical deadly hands.
“What’s your end game here?”
“C’mon Cas, don’t blue ball me.” Dean shook Cas’ shoulder to spring him back into action.
“I can do what now?” Dean asks. He must be too tired, has to be. Cas did not suggest Dean sleep fall asleep on him here in the basement of their apartment building.
He wanted the Russian back, wanted Cas back. He was starting to miss him for crying out loud. It was pathetic and seriously pissing Dean off. Especially when Cas would pass him on his way to Masters. That pissed him off to no end. Pissed himself off even more because he had nothing to be pissed off about. He got one hand job off the guy. It wasn’t like they were…whatever. Cas got what he wanted out of Dean and was done with him. Transaction complete, debt paid, people used Dean for his body before, why was Cas any different? So, he was pissed off about that but also, he missed the attention, missed those eyes on him and hated that Masters was getting it instead.
“I’m not touching you Dean,” Cas interrupted, lifting his hands up as if to surrender. “You’re the one with their hands on me,” he leaned into Dean’s space to whisper, “Not that I’m complaining, but might I suggest you put them somewhere a bit more useful.”
He seriously loved everything about giving head.
The Tran’s kid Mom saw the ordeal and was sniggering into her mug. She walked over to him, handing him a napkin covered in stars. Dean took it, wiping the sugar off his face and swallowing down the donut before thanking her.
“First one to make a noise loses.”
He likes messing with his brother. A daily duty he feels obliged to fulfil. The sound of Sam’s voice lets him know he’s rattled him enough for one day.
Cas sat back on his knees, continuing to pump Dean’s cock while he dipped his fingers into the opened tub of lube beside him. He pushed out one of Dean’s legs with his kneecap and Dean seemed to get on board with what he was doing, widening his legs for him.
Cas couldn’t reach into Dean’s hair from this angle, he knew he wanted it, so Dean leaned forward, braced himself on one of the metal rods that was keeping his bed above Cas’. When Cas’ hand reached into his scalp Dean let out a soft moan. He couldn’t help it, so weak to that touch.
“Sweetheart? What about sweetheart?” Dean asks. He has his hand behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. His chest is rising and falling steadily, a far cry from his bated breathes moments prior.
“You were em…” Dean gulped. “…jacking the guy off and…”
Dean would give his left hand to understand what they were saying. Cas had taken off his top, which Dean was grateful for as it had his cum stains on it and it made Cas look even more intimidating that already was with all of his ink on show for everyone to see.
. “Anyway, sorry.”
Dean ran his finger along what looked like a knife wound above the Madonna’s halo. It felt deep, jagged like the knife wasn’t all that sharp. Cas hitched his breath, stomach flinched. Dean moved his hand away with a quiet apology, “Shit, sorry.”
“Making you feel guilty?”
John closed Dean’s door quietly. “He looks at Cas like he hung the damn moon Sam, now go to sleep and not a word of it to anyone. Not even your Mother.”
“Me too.”
The windows in his studio apartment are open, they’re tall nearly spanning up to the ceilings and broken so he has to use books to keep them open. His curtains don’t move because there is no wind in this dead heat. It has seeped into every corner of his apartment, the only solace in his bathroom that has no windows. He thinks about having another cold shower, but it seems excessive, he had one before he went to bed. Counting sheep, he attempts that next.
They take a stroll through town after breakfast. Dean feels good, good food, good coffee and well, Cas aint so bad either. He was nervous, couldn’t sleep very well thinking about Cas’ story and their date, texting Sam at stupid o clock in the morning asking the best place for breakfast. When he saw Cas in his pajamas, sleepy eyed and soft part of him wanted to pick him up, bring him back to bed and nap for the whole day tangled in each other’s limbs. He wanted to do that one day, that and lots of other situations he had running around his mind. Situations he thought he’d never get to experience till around 3am last night.
Sam didn’t respond straight away. Balthazar pressed his thumb into the gauze above Sam’s face making him cry out in pain. Dean swung his feet around to reach for him, pulled on the metal cuff that was holding him back. The other Russian pushed Dean back onto the bed tutting at him for even trying something as stupid.
With a plate of smoked duck chow mien and side of prawn toast Dean reclined back onto the couch with crossed legs to hold the plate up. Cas ate from one of the boxes while he messed around with his laptop. He hadn’t played the video yet, just with the image on the screen started to alter the lighting, dimming it down and slightly blurring it to gain some anonymity. Christ, he was taking this seriously.
Cas spoke softly, kneading Dean’s ass. “You don’t need to be.”
Cas tilted his head. “What are you doing?”
His dick twitched at that remark. This was not going to end well. Dean fixed himself in his sweats willing it to stay down.
“What you two nerds talking about now?” Dean asked when he got close enough to them.
“Did you tell him that pie he made was for me, that we shared it on your tiny couch?” he asks. Their eyes meet. Dean is angry.
He wasn’t trying to be insulting. The apple pie still slightly warm from the bakery he had just spent the morning in. Gabriel’s bakery. Dean bought the pie while Castiel was in the back day dreaming about what his body would feel like on top of his. He was having those thoughts while Dean was picking out which pie to get Castiel to say sorry for what happened on Wednesday.
He pulled at the lapel on his beer, quietly answered. “Not what I wanted.”
“Sorry I should have asked first,” Cas looked down at the ground. “I thought it would be…something the viewers would enjoy.”
Cas turned himself around to look at Dean. “We had a deal. You fuck me, I leave you alone.”
“I do have
Cas nodded and didn’t say anymore about it.
Gabriel lifts it up to his lips. The strong smell he breathes in, his stomach flips.
. “and I couldn’t keep up. You’re very fast Dean and I’m well, not.” He lets out a big exhale after that. He’s rarely this honest with new people in his life about himself. He wants to be honest with Dean though.
“Why don’t you just play it through once unedited?”
The more the teasing continued a sheen of sweat started to coat Dean’s naked body. His chest starting to glisten a little as he writhed under Cas’ touch. Cas picked up the pace, jacking Dean off with enthusiasm, bringing him right to the edge again that had Dean crying out in the most desperate way.
Dean looked at the Russians. Cas and Gabriel were out for blood by the looks of it, using whatever they could get their hands on to take each other out. Gabriel was using a tray as a shield to block Cas’ onslaught of punches. They looked breathless, like they’d be at this for a while. Their faces bloodied, their fists too and when Dean caught a glimmer of something shiny in Cas’ hand, he knew this was not going to end well for the other Russian. Cas had the height advantage and now a weapon.
His words had Dean cumming untouched. His body jerked and cries tried to leave his mouth, so Cas gagged him on his fingers to silence him. Dean reveled in it, felt so full of Cas and the images in his mind of Cas’ words only made his orgasm that much sweeter. When he was spent, his body laxed into Cas’ chest. Cas’ fingers fell from his mouth and ass and arms wrapped around him to hold him tight.
He spotted Sam and Charlie coming out of them as he headed in, both of their hair slicked back from the water, towels wrapped around their waists. They were deep in conversation.
Cas moved a hand, palming over Dean’s erection.
He unfortunately had to go pick up Charlie, not unfortunate to go see his daughter, just unfortunate he didn’t get enough time to repay the orgasm or get up to much else other than the best blowjob he’d have in a seriously long time.
The silence eventually broke.
“Did I stutter Winchester?” Dean was about to flick over the card from the deck in his hand when Cas came down the wrought iron stairs and onto the ground floor. He was pulled away from the game while he watched Cas walk through the mass of people. Some people moved, some didn’t seem him till he was nearly on top of them and spurted out a million apologies. It was like he was Moses and the sea parted for him. That power radiated from him and it was felt by everyone around. It didn’t take long for Cas eyes to meet his.
“Mne vse ravno. Vy vypolnyayete zakazy. Vy ne vydayete zakazy.”
“Holy shit, that’s…fuck…I can’t…” and Dean tumbled too, hot spurts filling the space between them.
He dropped the glass into the sink and took his suds covered hand to Cas’ face, pulling him in for a bruising kiss. A kiss he hoped showed how freaking much he wanted this man, wanted this life and everything in between. Cas froze for a split second then kissed back, chapped lips pressing with as much enthusiasm into Dean’s. He felt his whole body heat up, how one man, one kiss could do that to Dean he wanted to spend his whole life figuring out.
“I wasn’t going to give you an orgasm.” He explained. “I can help with your pain.”
“Hey!” Dean punched him in the arm.
Dean nodded, words failing him as they usually did. The Russian pressed his mouth to Dean’s collarbone, easiest part for him to reach at this angle. His mouth hot and wet from licking them before touching his skin. Dean inhaled from the sensation of it, it being too long since someone’s mouth had been on him in this way. He hated how tactile he was sometimes, how much his body responded to things like this, something as simple as Cas’ tongue licking the into the dip of his collarbone.
“Like a rapid dog. Shot right in the temple,
He watched Cas. The tiniest of smiles showing up. He wanted to know what the smile was for. Was it because they were holding hands? Because Charlie painted it? Because it looked like they were some kind of family? The smile had too many answers. Answers Dean wasn’t about to get.
“You going to cause me anymore trouble Winchester?” the guard asked. Dean shook his head, making a point to not even look at the guard as he spoke. Zachariah was a dick to Dean, liked pushing his buttons. Seemed this time would be no different. He liked making a spectacle out of him.
Dean replied in a hum mixed with a moan as Cas sped up, taking his other hand from Dean’s balls and gripping onto his hip tight, holding him down. His strength pushed Dean into the bed and that pushed Dean over the edge unexpectedly, body writhing and head thrashing back into the pillows as Cas pulled his orgasm out of him.
“Damn Cas, this stuff is better than sex.” He licked his lips to catch the drops left there.
“Because I’m tired of hiding.”
Dean glared at his brother before continuing with their chick flick moment. “Who I was with last night it’s eh…” he paused. Wow this was harder to get out than he thought. His hand started to slip on the bottle he was holding from the clamminess.
It wasn’t till Dean was in bed that his phone starting vibrating on his bed side table. It was Cas, checking in for his after date debrief because that was apparently a thing they did now. Slightly buzzed Dean answered.
about the guy did things to Dean now that they didn't do before, his hands, his strength, his mouth, his voice, his eyes. And then there were the things that he discovered since he let his friend touch his dick, the way he could turn Dean into putty, how Dean trusted him enough to let go and just be whatever he wanted to be in that moment. There was no worries or fears or anything, just him and Cas and
“Don’t be vulgar Meg.”
A hand pressed onto his chest, stumbling him back to sit on the edge of the bed and away from those lips he wasn’t finished with. Dean took the top in his hand again, yanking Cas down to get them back instead of going with the top, Cas ducked his head through the hole and used the opportunity to take it off, leaving him bare for Dean to see standing in front of him. It was a smooth move he had to admit.
Dean took more of Cas, halfway down and rested there, sliding his tongue along his cock that was safely secured in his beautiful mouth. Quiet moans escaped Cas’ dry mouth, each one a praise to Dean letting him know how good this was. He could tell Dean listened well, opening his mouth, letting Cas see the saliva drip down and make contact with his balls.
He fell back onto his bed.
“You sound incredible.” He let slip. He could have kicked himself, probably would have if Cas hadn’t responded in the way he did. Telling Cas earned him a louder moan. The man was trying to kill him – God – his voice sounded so wrecked.
“Sit on your hands.”
The Russian smiled again. Dean was enjoying this much more than he probably should. His trousers were getting a bit tight in the crotch region, happy that Cas wasn’t sitting that close on his lap to feel it. He needed to keep some dignity, getting a hard on for someone playing with his hair like he was a teenager was not dignified.
“You a teacher or somethin’.” Dean reaches for a paper on Castiel’s lap. This guy is incapable of sitting still and minding his own business. He’s like another Gabriel.
Dean scoffed at that. “Yeah right, and you’d answer me honestly?”
“Oh man,” Dean wiped his eye. “That was gold.”
“But Dean…”
He had been downright primal, shoving the guy off of Cas when it felt like they were going somewhere Dean
It might have been Cas’ first date, but this is not Cas’ first kiss unless he’s read it enough times in books to understand what it is. Cas kisses him like he has the biggest quench and Dean is the first sight of water in miles. His hands move up Cas’ chest, flitting over his shirt collar up to take his face to tilt it slightly for a better angle.
“How are you feeling?” he asked tentatively, keeping his voice clear and void of suggestive undertones. The hand he wasn’t using to hold himself up he used to touch Dean’s face, caressing his cheekbone and under his lip.
That response sparked an interest in Dean. “Wait, you’ve done this before?”
Great, he just effectively told Cas he was hard.
“I’ve taken the liberty to email you some easier baking options, less time consuming and more reasonably priced.”
“You built a tree house?” Claire asked, doubting his capabilities. Seriously, what was up with Claire and hating on Dean? His daughter came to his rescue before he had a chance to give her some sass back.
“Don’t you think you should maybe find out?” his brother asked. Dean pulled a
– wait…” Dean’s voice starting to crack a little and Cas hadn’t even really started. The things he wanted to do to this boy. There weren’t enough pages in a book to write it all down. He had no idea what had come over him. His need to rip an orgasm from Dean was all he could think about.
“Thanks.” He smiled back then let Charlie whisk him away in the wrong direction. He didn’t have the heart to tell her, so they were definitely going to be late to the party.
For so long Dean had shut this part of him out in Purgatory. A part of him he thought he’d keep hidden for years till he was released. He thought he could never trust anyone with it and then Cas showed up and ruined that thought. The most dangerous man in the place and Dean wanted to give this part of him to that man. He wanted to show him what he meant to Dean, show him appreciation for everything he’d done for Dean.
Did you enjoy all the adorableness as much as I did? They're so cute it hurts.
His arm stung from the impact of it none the less though it was a welcoming distraction from the fact that Cas confirmed to Dean’s voice being sinful. He’d know after all. Clearly Dean wasn’t as quiet as he thought he was either. Fortunately, this time he didn’t have to be quiet.
“Fine,” Cas agreed reluctantly. “I’ll jack you off for money.”
He’s fumbling with his keys, trying to get find the right one while his other hand is bleeding through the cloth now. The drive home had been less than safe only being able to use one hand for most of it, now he can’t even open his front door. The keys drop for the third time.
Cas scooped Charlie out from Dean’s arms with ease, rested Charlie across his arms as if she were flying. “Let’s fly brave knight!” he flew her back into the sitting room.
“Someone with a pretty mouth.” He said matter of fact. It made Dean suddenly aware of how dry they were, that they were slightly parted which happened sometimes to Dean when he was distracted. He licked them on impulse. The guy’s brow raised slightly, watching Dean’s tongue coat his bottom lip. He was more conscious of himself now. That stare made him feel like he was on show. He shuffled in the seat, why in the hell did he choose to straddle it.
The Russian answered.
Why didn’t he want Cas to move away?
“What?” Sam asked. “Why?” he added.
He came to in the infirmary. The florescent light slightly blinded him as he opened his eyes.
“Cas.” He gasps hand gripping his heart. Castiel seems to have gotten himself into a habit of scaring Dean. He’s not in overalls this time, already changed back into his day clothes but he has been at work. Dean’s got a smudge on his neck running up behind his ear. His hands haven’t been cleaned properly.
Cas’ spread his cheeks. A pad of his finger brushed over Dean’s rim, coated in his spit. They hadn’t gone much further than this. A finger, testing, teasing. Cas never pushed it more than that even when Dean wanted more. Something about wanting it to be special, apparently having lust filled angry sex counted as special because he pushed his finger in and…
“Thanks cutie.” One of the girl’s friends says. He sighs knowing she’s leaning back to check out his ass, working at the bar gave him a whole new level of perspective for objectifying people. Dean ignores the comment and heads back behind the bar. He can hear the whistles and cheers as he walks away.
“I know, I know.” He huffed. It didn’t take a genius to figure out that Cas was probably sporting a scowl for Dean’s attitude. Dean took a few deep breathes to try and relax.
“Fine, I’ll stop my fun.” He ran his hands down Dean’s arms. “What do you want?”
justifiable.
He could shrug it off to the protection, say that Gordon was hot on his tail (which he was) and they needed to keep this up in public, really milk it for all its worth but deep-down Dean knew that was a crock of shit. He might be able to fool everyone else. He couldn’t fool himself though. He relished in the closeness, in the affection and attention Cas gave him.
“You’re looking good.” His brother noted.
“Can I ask you a question Cas?” he sounds nervous. Castiel doesn’t want him to be nervous.
“Here’s good?” Dean asked, making sure the Russian wasn’t just humoring him.
Cas sighed. He was irritated and locked in a cell with nowhere to go.
“Someone like me?” Dean raised a brow not really paying much attention to the words, more focused on how his eyes shifted around Dean’s face subtly, the tiniest darts like he was trying to join up Dean’s freckles.
“IT’S SNOWING!” she shouted over and over, bouncing up onto the bed. It was too early for this kind of enthusiasm. Dean hadn’t even had his coffee yet. The sun hadn’t even fully risen yet and somehow, she was a fire ball of energy. He got off the bed, reached for his daughter and stuck her under his arm to carry her out in search of caffeine.
45, 46, 47, 48. There was movement outside of his cell, the sound of keys rattling.
The Russian decided to be caring for a moment. “Dean.”
“Don’t be stupid Gordon,” Dean warned, moving around a table to create some distance between him and the guy who wants his head on a spike. “You know I’m protected.”
There was a pause and it killed him. It can’t be over. He needed to hear the end.
Cas stepped out of his way, putting his hand out gesturing Dean to take a seat. Dean moved past him, taking stock of whether to sit on the chair or bed. He opted for the bed, moving to lean against the top of Cas’ bed once his shoes and jacket were off. When Cas felt he had stopped moving he went to straddle Dean’s lap to continue what he had initially planned on doing which was to get Dean’s cock in his hand.
“Then yes, same again please Dean.” he replies.
Smut and feels all the way.
Dean got off the bed, needed to create some distance between them to get his breath back, get the imprint of Cas’s hands off of his body, compose himself back to who he usually was in here. He was Dean Winchester for crying out loud and he was no one’s prag, even if he wanted Cas in every way imaginable, it wasn’t happening. He wasn’t going to give everyone in Purgatory the satisfaction that Dean was getting fucked by the head of the Russian gang because he owned him.
Benny didn’t look where he was going, walked backwards, tipped over the bucket of soaped water spilling it over the road.
Dean doesn’t respond, just lights his cigarette and keeps it out the window. Cas turns over to look at him, calm, peaceful, blowing smoke out the window into the wind. Its turning dark, the sun setting behind the trees of his back garden. The light rays dance on Dean’s almost bare body.
The thought of it stopping now was too much to bear.
“You got any pie left?” Dean asks noticing there aren’t any in the cabinet. Gabriel looks over to where Castiel is standing.
He got a hum as a response.
“I wouldn’t say that.”
He took the jacket off Sam, slipped his arms into it. “You two gonna be alright with her?”
He wished he could laugh. He could laugh if he wasn’t worried about opening his mouth and saying something he’d regret for the rest of his life. Too many people Dean cared about were struck with his venomous words in the past. He wasn’t going to subject Cas to the same fate even if the man was crushing his heart in this very moment.
He gulped before answering, “Wanna suck your cock.”
“You’re beautiful Dean,” he praised Dean. “My lev.”
“What? No, just still have a bit of sex brain is all sooo…”
There was a slight dark slur in his voice. He must have been a bit buzzed too from his date.
“No!” Dean spoke a little too loud. He stilled his body. “No, I’ll be good Cas, I promise.”
“I want to, just, talk me through it ok?” Dean whispered.
When he gets home, he notices a familiar brown box outside his door. It’s from Sweet as Heaven with a note on it saying,
Dean laughs, head back, from the gut laugh. Cas’ watches him, head tilts in confusion which only adds to the hilarity that Cas doesn’t even realise he’s ruined that girl’s night.
A hand went around his mouth, silencing him. He needed it. Cas shushed him over and over as he kept his finger in there, just to the first knuckle. It was a lot. Christ how was he going to take Cas’ cock one day if he was sweating already from just this. His body stilled, giving into Cas for this moment.
Gabriel laughs. “I
Cas let him in. He was in his weekend clothes. Dean tried not to pay attention to how soft he looked in his red hoodie and striped socks. The warmth of his house made Dean shuck off his hat, coat and jumper. Cas didn’t say much other than to sit down in the sitting room which he did, taking a side of the couch to hug. The other man disappeared for a brief moment and returned with two cups of coffee.
The orphanage made him wary of big spaces, he’s used to closed quarters. Gabriel convinced him once he graduated to buy a big apartment, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, separate everything and he couldn’t cope with the space. It was too much for him. He founds this place and bought it outright, cash in hand, he liked the exposed red brick and big windows, he found carpet too soft so wanted wooden floors. It ticked all of his boxes and didn’t give him anxiety which was the main thing.
“Who did this to you?” Cas asked quiet yet stern.
“You’re going to need sugar then, my cure all for bitchy mid-terms,” Gabriel starts making a box to fill. Sam, Jessica and Dean all lean closer to the glass front to inspect what he has left.
“Dean!” Shurley’s voice.
“How else was I supposed to interpret you calling me insufferable and an inconsiderate asshole?” Dean asks. His voice is curious, not angry. Small steps. Castel continues, “I’m not really what you might call a people person. It takes me a while to get used to someone, to understand someone and for them to understand me, so when you gave me the pie I…”
Cas climbed up the stairs to his brother, Gabriel seemed to be more than elated at the situation for some reason. He wondered if it was because Gabriel had done something to Cas’ poor school peer or if it was just due to someone from Cas’ school being at his house. It wasn’t like Cas brought anyone home.
“You friendly with the Russians now?” Dean asked.
“I will Dean, I’ll take care of you.” Cas promised. Dean believed him. They stayed like that, close, breathing the same air while Cas’ hand took Dean’s cock, jacking him off to bring him over the edge. Dean gripped tight onto Cas’ hair. “Come on Dean, cum for me.”
Cas shrugged. Dean gestured him to come closer, but he didn’t budge.
The urge to peek through his window to get a look at his new neighbor is there but he resists. Castiel refuses to leave his bed this early on a Sunday. He closes his eyes once again in the hopes of going back to sleep. The guy is humming a song loud enough for Castiel to hear. It relaxes him enough to dose off for another couple of hours.
“I have fucked up people’s lives too Dean. I’m not a good man.”
Little lock down day dreams, a Dean POV included, enjoy x
The back of Cas’ hand touched under his chin for their eyes to meet.
“NO!” Dean gasped.
“Slack your jaw.” Cas pushed Dean’s jaw down with the order and Dean obeyed letting it relax completely. “That’s a good boy.”
“Dean, your mouth.” Cas says in an exhale like he’s been holding his breath up until this moment. Dean feels that in his dick.
The internal struggle in Dean’s mind ruined any leftover sexual endorphins from last night. He moved to the edge of Cas’ bed, noticing a glass of water and his glasses perched on the side. Those weren’t there the night before. More of Cas looking after him, keeping him hydrated another thing he needed to make sure he did after last night’s sexcapades. He gulped down the water, lukewarm from probably sitting there for some time. Cas must have had an early exam or paper to hand in.
The grip on his arms loosened and he used the opportunity to slip from the hold. Thankful for the sweat on his body it was easy enough to do once the other guy was distracted by the presence of Gabriel. He shoved both of them back and managed to scramble away towards his brother who was there to catch him as he legs gave way.
The Russians were cooking up the Angel Grace, turning these people into crazed lunatics. If Benny was right, that the Angel Grace was just a distraction that meant the Russians were cooking up something bigger. The Russians were the reason for the riot. Were they the reason for the possibility of another one on the horizon too? Too many questions, ones he knew he wasn’t going to get out of Cas. He was selective of what he told Dean and Dean knew when to push and when to accept what he was given. This time he was accepting of the privy information and didn’t press for more.
Cas sat down on his bed, crossed his legs and threw the wet towel into his laundry hamper.
“You haven’t managed to piss him off yet?”
Another gulp.
“I can’t.”
He’d make sure of it.
“I have two, I personally don’t think it equates to be being renowned. My publicist added that in without my consent.” he plates up the pasta. Dean puts the book away, leaving it on the counter top within arm’s reach and grabs two beers from the fridge as if this is his place. Castiel finds it endearing.
“I’m going to shower,” Cas grabbed a spare change of clothes. “Try not to break anything.”
Last night had been just about as overly stimulating as Dean had ever gotten with someone.
Dean burst out a laugh at that. Suddenly he didn’t feel so cold. His phone buzzed again, an email reminder about the Fete quickly followed by an email reminding parents of Charlie’s class about the bake-sale. It had completely slipped his mind. He had to bake something. Dean remembered the cookies at Claire’s birthday party and the delicious chocolate cake he got a slice of when Cas had cut it. He had made that. Dean opened up his messages with Cas again.
“Hi Cas!” Charlie beamed her biggest smile, swinging on her feet trying to ignore the unimpressed look Dean had on.
“No.” they answered together.
Dean starts to walk towards his car, stomping his feet as he goes. His keys weigh heavy in his hands and by the time he turns on the ignition the guilt has set in.
Dean seemed to understand, his body no longer fighting against Cas. He let go of Dean’s wrists and Dean didn’t move them, kept them there as if still held there. Cas hummed in appreciation of the sight, hands running down Dean’s flanks.
“You shouldn’t ask questions either.” Was the response he got. Benny rolled the canister towards the kitchen door and disappeared inside. Dean sat on the edge of the truck, feet dangling off the edge. He took his hat off, rubbed his hair that was starting to get sticky from the sweat. It would take a while for Benny to get that 40-liter drum inside, he had time to get his breath back.
Summer had been everything Cas had wanted and more. Beautiful sights to take photographs, at least half of them of Dean if he were being honest. A muse of green eyes, tanned skin and darkened freckles from the sun. The days spent near water were his personal favourite. He had more photos to develop than he knew what to do with.
“Ash, you’re about as cheap as that haircut.” He grips his hand onto his friend’s shoulder.
“What the hell you playing at Cas?”
His orgasm punches him in the gut, makes him arch his back and tilt his head back letting out a quiet cry of Dean’s name, he feels Dean lick up his neck and whisper some sweet nothings in his ear about how amazing he is or something along those lines he can’t quite fathom.
Dean’s fist was so tight he gave himself white knuckles. He hopped up onto his bed and tried to calm himself down. He dug the heel of his palms into his eyes trying to get the words “pretty mouth” out of his brain, trying to get those looks the AB were giving him out of his brain. Trying to not let Zachariah rile him up any more than he already had.
“History and Law.” He replies.
Cas asked. Images filled with what he wanted, exactly what he wanted, how he wanted it, where and when over and over. He had already cum that night and yet his cock still twitched with interest.
Benny was still alive. The Louisiana smooth talker was surviving by getting ahead of the game and actually supplying Angel Grace to the nut jobs who were looking for it. His work-detail meant he could roam around the grounds with enough freedom and lack of supervision to get away with it. He refused to give Dean his source, though chances were that it was the Russians.
The silence falls between them again. He starts to think he hasn’t made things better, if anything he’s made things worse. What he said doesn’t make any sense to Dean even if it makes complete sense to Castiel. His brain isn’t wired like other peoples. Or maybe Dean is still hungry, maybe he should have gotten more chili cheese fries, another burger. He fights the urge to touch his hair again, it’s probably a mess already.
“Yeah Cas,” Dean took one, wiping himself up. He’ll shower in a minute, once his legs start working again. The chances of him moving were slim right now. “You’re a son of a bitch, you know that? What was with that orgasm delay?”
“I thought you wanted my help.” Cas replied turning back to the mixture. He was gentle with the flour, like it was precious or something, folding it in and over the mixture. Dean hopped back up on the kitchen counter, let his legs swing underneath him.
Cas punched him back quickly. He learned how to punch from Dean in first year after having to deal with some homophobic assholes in their building. Although it stopped the assholes from bugging Cas, it didn’t stop his friend from then turning his new skill on him. He wanted to say he regretted showing him but the look on Uriel’s face was totally worth every bruise he got from his roommate since.
“Hello Dean.” Cas replied, he smiled at Dean. Yep, definitely not cold. He was distracted trying to figure out the shades of blue his pal had in his eyes that when a small body head butted his thigh, dangerously close to headbutting his crotch. It wouldn’t have been the first time his daughter accidentally left Dean speechless and writhing in agony.
“Did I get it?” he asks. Castiel shakes his head. “Where is it?”
“Yeah well,” that smile came back. “He’s a big part of why things are better for me.”
“I don’t want to be seen to be a prag, it’s pathetic.”
“It was just some chick at a bar alright? I fucked her in a bathroom stall,” he lied, turning up his collar to hide the marks again and the red rising up his neck. “I didn’t tell you two because she meant nothing to me. I don’t even remember her name.”
He looked up to keep an eye on Charlie. She was in the train, pretending to drive it with another kid. Her choo choo noises carried over to him on the bench. He re-opened the messages.
Cas hit play.
“Cas, fuck me, c’mon just fucking – fuck – fuck me.” He blabbered, completely incoherent and riding the fingers stretching him open because yeah, he was eager and needy and when it came down to it basically a massive cock slut.
Their video played in the background. Cas’ grunts filling the sitting room as Dean gagged on his cock on the screen. He thought he’d cringe at how submissive he looked but all he could think about was how full he felt and how containing it was to be held like that. Cas’ fingers dug deep into Dean’s head while he skull fucked him, the marks on Dean’s neck starting to tingle, like they remembered being formed.
"Even hotter,” Meg’s eyes widened. “Gay friend fucks straight friend. It’s a thing.”
Zachariah didn’t let anything out, just motioned for the guard to grab Sam by the shoulder and hoist him up off the bench.
“Someone’s feeling brave today.” Zachariah noted.
“A lot I’d say.” Charlie stubbed out his smoke on the bench.
Cas and Gabriel initially refused. They fought relentlessly about it for months. The two sets of brothers coming to blows more than once. Dean ran his tongue over a chip in his tooth. Another reminder of Cas on him. Only once their grand plan worked did they stop making it. It took nearly two years, failed attempt after failed attempt to get one of their own out of a cage in Hell. The rioting in Purgatory being used to distract everyone enough for Lucifer to escape.
