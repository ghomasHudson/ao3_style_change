that Tony was referring to was, but he knew he wanted to kick every single one of their asses. He did
. There was nobody he had to worry about hurting him besides himself. That was a comfort he just wasn’t ready to give up.
He didn’t mean to sound so pitiful, honestly, but he was having an embarrassingly hard time not crumbling. Honestly, he wanted to break down and ugly sob in her lap. Tony knew if he was upset enough she would allow it for a little while, too, but after that, it would be back to the regularly scheduled program. From experience, he knew it would end up being even harder on him to submit than before. It was just another form of stalling and it all had the same result.
“Good thing nobody asked you, huh?” Tony spoke, sending him a cheeky smile before taking a swig of the beer in his hand. He didn’t want to do this - Steve was one of the few Dominants in his life he wanted to respect. He wanted to pursue whatever this was. But he was too scared. He didn’t want him to get too close.
"You'll stay?" he asked softly, peaking up from under wet eyelashes in the most pitiful little tone Steve had ever heard him use, "In here...with me? Promise?"
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Steve chuckled, taking a step closer to Tony, “I’m not about to dignify your bitchy behavior, boy. I don’t think it’s all your fault; I think you’ve been given up on too much, but I also think you running any and everybody off isn’t helping, Anthony.”
“Of course you’re not in trouble, Tony,” she assured him quickly, sounding exasperated, “You didn't do anything wrong. You're being a very good boy and I'm proud of you for letting Steve take such good care of you.”
Pepper was heading out of the room and down the hallway before he could say anything else on the matter, throwing him a smile over his shoulder, “Thanks, a lot, by the way. You didn’t have to stay.”
"He hasn't been too bad," Steve lied, shrugging, "Nothing I can't handle, at least. Besides, I get why he may want to act like that. It's nothing for you to apologize for."
"Hi, sweet boy," Pepper greeted just as she had earlier, returning his smile. The nickname didn’t seem to throw her for a loop at all, "You feel a little better, now? All ready for bed?"
“Good, because you won’t be,” Pepper continued after a beat, sounding relieved, “It’s up to you; Steve can stay with you until I get back in the morning or we can have Rhodey come stay with you. Your choice, sweetheart, but you have to pick one, or I will for you.”
"I'm glad to hear that," Pepper responded mechanically, not pausing her onslaught on his behind to speak, "You
Steve kept his voice low as he explained the obvious, gesturing to the wet, loose collar of the undershirt that Tony had been using to wipe at his face all night, “It’s perfectly okay if you don’t want me to see. It’s nothing for me to step out for a second just so you can-“
He wasn’t surprised when Tony whined and clung to him, shaking his head ‘no’. Steve clung back, shushing him softly, “I know, honey, but you have to rest. In a few more hours, Pepper will be here, so you have to sleep like you promised her.”
"Yes, please, sir," he voiced in the most polite tone Steve ever heard him use after a moment of just nodding. His eyes were hopeful and bright, and he was practically vibrating in his spot. Steve was sure his heart was some kind of puddle by then.
There was a pause in Pepper's movement and shortly after, her face was back on the screen. The look she was giving him was wary and Steve knew that the trust issues were about to come back to play, so he quickly continued with his point.
“Nothing,” Steve told her calmly, making sure to keep any and all defensiveness out of his voice. He definitely didn't enjoy the third degree that he was getting, but he could understand why she was so overprotective. If he was in her position, he would probably be ten times worse. He hardly even knew Tony but by then, he felt like he could kill for him if necessary. Deep down, he couldn’t help but be scared of how protective of him he’d be if he actually could claim him.
Steve couldn’t help but stare at him for a few minutes, just admiring his beauty in the dim light. Even with the worst of behavior, he was still gorgeous, but he was truly angelic like this. Steve felt honored to be able to see it, honestly. He didn’t want to creep Tony out, however, so he did eventually rest his head on the headboard and closed his own eyes.
Tony just hummed in response to the teasing before a jaw splitting yawn hit him. The drowsiness was starting to catch up with him, but he didn’t
“Then I’m gonna do it,” Steve informed him, gentle but firm. He didn’t want to sound threatening or spook Tony, but either way, it was getting done. By then, though, he figured that was unspoken. He braced himself for whatever reaction Tony gave him, but was pleasantly surprised by what he got.
Steve was a six-foot, two-hundred-something-pound fucking super-soldier. There were very few people living that he couldn't beat in hand to hand combat and for the most part, he feared nobody. But at that moment, right then and there, he was embarrassed to admit that he kind of feared the hell out of Pepper Potts. He wasn't quite sure what she could do to him, but he was sure that if he were to hurt Tony, she'd do whatever it took to follow through on her promise. It was a good thing he had no intention of finding out.
"We'll just have to see," he continued smoothly, not addressing Tony's grip on him as he gestured towards his clothes, "If I step out for a minute, can you get changed for me?"
was especially cute. With his head lying on Steve's chest, eyes still wet but shining brightly at the screen, and still trying to scoot impossibly closer to the Dom that, two hours prior, he would have sworn on all things holy he couldn't stand. Steve wondered how much of this progress would reverse in the morning. Not all of it, he hoped. He definitely wasn't looking for a reward for taking care of Tony, but if they managed to make it past the
Tony had been without a legal dominant since Pepper and her submissive/wife bonded almost three years ago. Although, Pepper still spent a lot of her time treating Tony as if he was still all hers. He didn't mind, he loved Pepper more than anything in the whole world. Their relationship was never romantic or sexual, however, and though Tony acted like he didn’t need anyone on that level, he did. He definitely did, and that’s why he acted out so badly.
“I can go to sleep with it on!” Tony fought his case, and Steve cursed himself when he noticed his eyes were welling up with tears again. He was
"Why'd you stop?" he managed to whine out, but quickly shut up when Steve resumed the comforting touch. There wasn't one singular part of him that cared how absolutely mortifying this should have been. He had no fight left in him.
him like this. Before he knew it, he was just snuffling, hiccuping, and fighting to keep his tired eyes closed. He didn't like to sleep, but it was the easiest when Pepper was there so he figured he should try to take advantage of it.
“I did something...” Tony mumbled out what he could come up with, peaking up at Pepper’s face through his wet lashes to gauge her reactions. He hated when she was mad at him and if it wasn’t for that, he probably would have kept up with the lie for even longer than he did.
When all Tony did was continue to pout in response to that, Steve offered him the rag, “Do you think you could wipe your face off for me?”
Tony just nodded in response, breathing in her scent and basking in her presence. It had been a while since her last visit -
Once he saw his look wasn’t working too well, he diverted his eyes to the floor and curled up under his blankets. He blinked tears out as he hugged his pillow, whimpering out another broken little apology.
When Tony slowly pushed open the door to the bathroom, Steve hurriedly set the phone to the side and beckoned him towards him. The tear tracks on his cheeks had been washed away but his eyes were still wet, indicating that he'd continued to cry as he readied himself for bed. Steve had probably never seen him look so skeptical (which was really saying something when it came to Tony), but Steve still felt his heart melt. God, the submissive was just so fucking cute. For the thousandth time that night, Steve wondered how anybody could have
and even though he wouldn’t say it aloud, it was hard to behave without any guidance. He was scolded plenty of times over facetime, but that could only go so far. And although it had nothing to do with him disabling the babysitting protocol, he had been itching for a real reaction for a while now.
Tony's heart swelled without his permission. Steve had barely even done anything, but the slightest, gentle and caring gestures were sending Tony head over heels for this stupid man he'd been running from and he could hardly even help himself. He was so far down he found himself wondering what the hell he was so afraid of.
"Uh oh," Steve muttered quietly, looking in the direction of the bathroom, "I believe our reprieve is just about up."
"Yes'm," he answered politely, pushing the covers off of him and beginning to stand from the bed. He wanted a bath before he started his day, and he was hoping Pepper would give it to him. Before he could open his mouth to ask for that, though, Pepper was pushing down on his shoulder so he'd stay seated.
There were the ones who needed more attention and tough love than others, but he didn't believe there should be
Of course, he was being sarcastic. That was probably the last thing she was hearing. Nonetheless, he couldn't help but be glad that Tony had brought him up to her at all. No matter what Tony was telling her, that had to count for something.
Steve stayed in his place on the arm of the couch after he finished taking off Tony’s shoes (undoubtedly unaware of how expensive the piece of furniture was) and stayed there for the remainder of Tony and Pepper’s conversation. He was silent, but he did keep a comforting grasp on Tony’s ankle. The submissive was appreciative, but he still would have preferred to be back in his lap. He definitely wasn’t about to ask, though, so he just settled for the periodic ankle squeezes Steve was giving him. It was better than nothing, after all.
be a pleasant morning for you,” she threatened, tone deathly serious. This was regarding Tony's well-being (well, at least a little bit) and she took stuff like that very seriously. “If I get there tomorrow and I find out you haven’t even tried to sleep, you will have a very sore bottom. Do you understand me?”
Tony didn't really want to choose. Not because he didn't know what he wanted, because he did. He just wasn't sure if there was a right answer or not, and he wanted to upset neither Pepper nor Steve. Pepper usually made his choices for him when he was this far down and he preferred it that way.
needs to be taken care of, Anthony,” Steve reiterated after a moment of silence, carefully watching his reactions as he spoke, “Doms, too. Just in a different way. That’s why we bond.”
"Yes'm, I'll try," he assured her obediently, though Steve doubted the validity of this, "Is it time for you to go yet?"
what he’d done. Tony mentally kicked himself, because seriously? He should have fucking known. She always found out everything, eventually, and his whole scheme had worked out a little too easily in the first place.
Okay, well, maybe not 'hardly trying', but he definitely wasn't giving it his all. And once he started to drop, all of Steve's previous flirtatious behavior went out of the window. He wasn't about to try and pursue a sub while he technically wasn't even in his right mind. He was in a vulnerable position and Steve would never take advantage of that, but he still needed to be a good Dom, whether Tony was his or not. And in this particular occurrence, that meant coddling and petting Tony to help him relax.
’ argument going out the window as he took several gulps of the cold liquid. Steve figured it was just his natural instinct to decline or to argue when offered something, especially food or drinks. His body, however, knew he was parched.
“Oh, you bet I do, but I’m asking you, Anthony,” Pepper retorted firmly, darkening her look even further. Tony winced at her tone, watching his tears drop from his face to the wood floor beneath him instead of looking up at his Domme. He
Tony squirmed in place at the praise, blushing as he allowed Steve to take the shirt from him and toss it down the chute to join his slacks. It was clear to Steve how much he loved to be praised and he planned to bury Tony in it every time he got the chance.
“Mhm,” Tony hummed his assent, smile not faltering at all as he sent a quick glance up the man in question, “He’s takin’ care of me.”
Some odd and small part of Steve wanted to laugh again. The sub he was after apparently came with a warning label.
night, he hadn’t really gotten any sleep, and he was vaguely aware of how gross he was starting to feel in his clothes, given how long he’d been in them, but he felt gratified in a way that he hadn’t in a long time. Once he stepped into the elevator, still wearing a smile, he realized that he left his suit jacket somewhere in Tony’s bedroom.
Pepper was noticeably upset, even to a stranger, but Steve figured this had to be a stressful situation for her. Tony needed more than she could give him and deep down, she probably knew that. It wasn't quite her fault - her hands were more than full - but Steve imagined that there was an underlying sense of guilt from not being able to do more. Once again, he understood.
. At least then, his feelings wouldn’t be hurt like a little kid because he left him without saying goodbye. He didn’t
Steve didn’t miss the beam of pride in Pepper’s eyes as she nodded, a smile tugging at the corners of her lips, “He is
“I turned off your stupid babysitting protocol,” Tony could help but sass as he finally gave his answer. He looked up to glare at her, tear-stained face and all as he continued, “I don’t need it. I’m a grown man.”
Despite having a plan, he figured he could refrain from sharing it with the submissive for the duration of his timeout. Tony, despite being borderline dramatically upset, would be just fine. Steve wanted him thinking over his behavior, after all. The comfort Tony was getting from him was already a soft touch; Steve figured it could do without getting any softer.
?" Pepper inquired, disbelief lacing her words. Steve barely stopped himself from chuckling at that; He was originally just as surprised as her. Expressing what he actually wanted was very clearly not in Tony’s nature, “Is he drunk?”
“I won’t,” he stated with no hesitation, rolling his eyes in amusement. He didn’t want to get back into conversation on whether or not Steve could handle Tony again. Not yet, at least, since he was sure it would come up again, sooner or later, but he still preferred to postpone it, “I’m not intimidated in the slightest, just marveling is all.”
“Love you,” he mumbled, letting his face fall against the pillow he was gripping, swallowing back the guilt. He was ready for her to be back already. He'd missed her.
"I think you probably know how to work all this better than I do," Steve joked with a smile when Tony just continued to give him a sad look, patting his stomach, "Don't you?"
"You can't blame yourself," he comforted. It really wasn't her fault; Tony just needed more attention than she had to give him. And he didn't want anyone
"Yeah, he does that when it's been a while," she sighed out, her tired eyes now focused on something off-screen, "I'm not there to help him and he refuses to ask Rhodey, so he was trying to hold out until I got back. I’m guessing you soiled that plan for him.”
Pepper was in there talking to stupid Steve (undoubtedly about him) while he was in his room, alone, feeling sorry for himself, too pitiful to even get himself in bed.
“I’m sorry I’ve been gone so long, honey,” she apologized sadly, squeezing Tony’s hands and forcing him to look at her with wet eyes, “And I know it’s so hard for you. I promise you we won’t be leaving for a long time like this ever again. But the fact that it’s hard on you is why I’m letting all of the bad eating and sleeping habits that you developed while I was gone slide. Not to mention the attitude I hear you’ve been throwing around at anyone who can catch it. What you
Tony’s stomach fluttered, both at his words and the gentle touch. The way he phrased it like a suggestion instead of a flat out order, unlike every other Dominant he seemed to encounter...The way his touch just felt so
"I'm at a dinner party that I've been ready to get away from for ages," she said, smile widening again, "That's why I didn't see your first call, but no, I'm not busy."
Tony did relax for a moment but just tensed more and more the longer the phone rang. When it finally stopped ringing and the call ended, Steve bit back a groan. He didn't have to know Tony as well as Pepper did to know that this wasn't good. She was the only person who could actually
Steve figured that was true all along, but this time he accepted it and confirmed so with a quick nod. Curiosity began to overtake him before the subject could change, though, and he couldn't help but ask something.
Steve hushed him, massaging his shoulders a little when he tensed back up. He stopped moving the second Tony started to put up a fight, not wanting him to feel forced into anything, “Yeah, you do. We can call Pepper or Rhodes and we'll see if they can help you go down easier, but you’re going down, Anthony. Let’s go.”
That’s not to say he had a problem with Helen; he absolutely loved her and she was one of his best friends. He just more than missed having Pepper to himself. Everything was so much easier back then. He didn't have to go Dom-less so often and he really didn’t have to worry about whether he wanted to keep stupid Steve around or not.
“Band on your wrist says otherwise,” Steve spoke nonchalantly, giving the submissive a wink when he just blushed again in response.
"You're more than welcome to put something on the TV and watch it," she informed him with a smile, clearly used to this line of questioning, "Just as long as your butt stays in that bed. And why is it the only time you want to eat is when you're supposed to be
“No, ‘m not tired, Pep!” he whined out his complaint before she could even finish talking, not caring how childish it sounded. He was tired, obviously, but he knew on top of everything else that meant he'd have to get off of Steve and take care of himself for a moment. Or, maybe all night. Would Steve leave? Tony didn't really want him to. He wouldn't admit that out loud, but he wanted him there. At least until Pepper got home.
Steve smiled a little to himself as he thought of how utterly excited Anthony had been to see his Domme earlier that morning. He’d be surprised if Tony didn’t implode with excitement when he finally saw her face. This thought warmed his heart at first, but then he realized that his reaction to seeing Steve still around would probably be the exact opposite.
Still, he didn't care. He knew what he was getting himself into. Maybe not fully and by every single detail, but he knew, and he was prepared. Tony had endless potential when paired with the right Dominant, and Steve knew he was the right person for the job. By the looks of it, he may have a few grey hairs (or more like a head full) by the time Tony's where he wanted him to be, but it would still be worth it.
Steve's heart had been a puddle for a while by then, but it melted even further at his words. God, he was totally sprung. And every single time Tony looked at him with those
"He is," Steve admitted, even though he was getting fairly comfortable with the idea of Tony-sitting until his Domme got home to take care of him in the morning. He just spoke to Rhodey not too long ago at the party and he knew he couldn't have gone far since then, "I talked to him at the party. You don't need to call him, though, unless you're not comfortable with me staying. Honestly, I don't mind."
He shrugged, seeming much shyer all of a sudden as he averted his eyes. He began to play with the buttons on Steve's shirt again to avoid eye contact, “It just...seems like you should...by now.”
He would never let anybody else hurt him either, not again, but he didn't voice this thought to Pepper.
“I missed you, too,” Tony managed to whisper, eyes trained on Pepper’s knees below him, “You just got here. I don’t want you to do this.”
This wasn't the time to work on him, though, and when he heard the water shut off abruptly in the bathroom he was reminded of that.
“No,” Tony managed to whisper when he realized he was being led back inside, trying to still his feet, “I’m o-okay...I don’t need-“
The attitude from before was gone (for the time being, at least). His voice was soft and sweet, just like the eyes he gave Steve when he looked up at him. The affection he felt for Tony was just so
His attitude began to slip away as quickly as it came and before he knew it, he was ready to start bawling again. He pulled his bottom lip in between his teeth, shooting Steve the most apologetic look he could muster as he forced himself to stand. He wasn't even trying to look all that pitiful when he drug himself towards the bathroom, but he couldn't help it. He was rude and he gave Steve attitude and now the Dom was angry with him. Well, at least that's how he felt. All because of one fucking look.
"Jarvis," he managed to croak out after a moment, accepting that nobody would be coming to check on him for a while, "Could you tell 'em I'm ready?"
Then again, there was probably no possible way for him to fuck anything up. Not unless he did something vile and completely out of his character. That's how he knew what he was feeling was irrational, so it helped him swallow down his self-doubt. Plus, Tony didn't need a psyched-out, panicking Dominant taking care of him, either. Steve's usual demeanor seemed to be working pretty well for them by then, and he wasn't about to change it.
“Don’t have to try,” he grumbled, shooting a glare up at Steve. He didn’t know it at the time, but Pepper had been trying to instill that he was good and loved into his head for years upon years. He'd been scolded, spanked, and even had his mouth washed out with soap for refusing to acknowledge that his bad thoughts weren't true on multiple occasions. It had helped him learn his lesson when it came to unnecessarily expressing those thoughts, but that didn't mean he stopped believing them.
Tony sighed, obviously not ready at all, but nodded and finally let go of the Dom’s shirt so he could step back from the hug.
This was something that had obviously been discussed while Pepper and Steve had been speaking privately, and the fact that Steve sticking around was an option meant that Steve must have offered and Pepper decided to trust him. And that’s saying something, because Pepper didn’t trust easily, especially when it came to Tony, and he knew it, too. Apparently, stupid Steve had the same effect on everybody. Great.
“Easy,” he murmured, placing his hands on the man’s shoulders. Tony flinched at the touch, not expecting it despite the fact that Steve's movement was slow. The last time he'd ended up in such a vulnerable position with a Dominant he didn't know too well...it didn't end well. And Tony didn't want to be taken advantage of
and he adored it. Only Pepper pet him like that. Only Pepper did a lot of things. This was all new to him.
Steve did his best to comfort the Domme's worries, but he knew there was only so much he could do to lessen her anxiety. When he told her he was happy Tony had somebody who cared enough to worry so much, he truly meant that. The poor thing would have been way worse off without Pepper. That still didn't mean he wouldn't be better off with Steve.
“I told Steve I was really sorry!” he quickly tried to defend his actions, borderline panicking. Pepper wasn’t going to take hitting a Dominant lightly in any sense, no matter how far down he was. No matter what, he knew better, “And that I would never, ever do it again!”
“Pepper!” he exclaimed excitedly before Jarvis even finished speaking, trying to wiggle his way off of Steve’s lap. He paused for a moment when he realized he didn’t know where he was going, “Your phone? Where’s your phone?”
“Aht-aht,” he reprimanded softly, gently moving Tony back to his original position. When the boy whined and pouted up at him, he just gave him a look, “Bedtime means no more watching movies. Do we need to turn it off?”
"Do you think you can brush your teeth and wash your face for me really quick?" she asked him softly, "I know you don't like to go to bed without getting that done first."
"She's absolutely right, y'know," he told him with a small smile and a wink, "All you need to worry about is just letting me take care of you, okay?"
“That’s my good boy,” she praised in a much softer tone then she was just previously using. Despite the fact that he wasn't happy with what she'd told him to do and how she told him to do it, those words were nice to hear. No matter how hard he tried not to, he still always wanted to be a good boy and it was always nice to hear it. Even if he didn't think it was all that true.
“No!” Tony protested again, frustration bleeding from his voice as his fists balling up at his sides. Considering his body language and whiny tone, Steve wouldn’t have been surprised if he stomped his foot. He took a deep breath before, eyes squeezed shut as he ground out his words, “I don’t
Pepper gave him a look but fortunately didn’t push any further, moving to fill the mugs with a sigh, “Well, at least he didn’t run away…right?”
“Right,” the man laughed, stepping forward so he could lean against the railing next to Tony, “Seems like you're avoiding your own party to me.”
"Okay, honey," Pepper was using both of her hands to comfort him before he even noticed she'd set the brush down, using one hand to rub the sting out of his behind while the other gently rubbed his back. He could feel a cold sweat on his skin; it made him feel gross but
To that, all Tony did was whine. He knew a simple sorry wasn't going to get him off of her lap; in the end, nothing would. Safewording wasn't an option - he knew what that was for and it was one thing he took very seriously - but unfortunately for him, nothing else swayed Pepper. Or, at least, as far as he could tell nothing else swayed Pepper. There
"Still fast asleep," Steve nodded behind him towards his closed door. He hadn't heard any movement of any sort so he knew Tony was still resting, "I managed to sneak out without him hearing."
Those words hit him like a ton of bricks. He didn’t want to care. He truly didn’t, but he did! If anyone else called him a brat, he would have laughed and agreed. But this...Steve telling him that just hurt more than anything. He didn’t
And, that was true. He got it dealt with pretty easily, but that was mainly because Tony came to his senses quickly. Had he have continued to push to at Steve, it would have been a different story.
Steve didn’t know what part of “earlier” he was referring to at first, but he knew better than to ask, so he just racked his brain for a moment. He’d pretty much forgotten about Tony’s little fit already, but it came to the forefront of his mind after a short moment in thought.
stay curled up against Steve in silence and watched the movie for over another hour with no complaint, silent aside from his soft breathing; he just wouldn’t go to sleep. When the first movie ended, Jarvis played another on his own and Steve didn’t immediately have the heart to make him stop watching. It was peaceful and despite it not being progressive, they were both enjoying it.
Steve knew that Tony was upset because he’d left his sight (even if it was only for less than a minute) but he still couldn’t help but shoot him a smile as he moved to take the half-empty water bottle from his hands. Setting it on the nightstand, he reminded Tony again, “I told you I wasn’t going anywhere.”
Looking up, he seemed to muster up the most innocent look he could manage before shrugging his shoulders and asking, "Well, why didn't you, then?"
"Thank God," she chuckled, heading towards the kitchen, "I'll leave him be, then. He needs as much sleep as he can get."
Of course, she knew. Pepper always figured him out eventually, no matter how slick he thought he was. It had been a while,
He wasn’t sure how comfortable he was omitting some of the truth from Pepper, especially so soon, but Tony’s little voice was just so
This time, he did laugh and it was loud and openly. It had barely been five minutes since Tony'd left - he doubted that the sub had even managed to get out of his suit and into sleep attire by then. Nevertheless, it was entertaining and adorable that he was already calling for them again.
dealt with on Steve’s terms, albeit lightly. Tony already had a spanking coming from his Domme, even though he didn’t know it yet, and Steve didn’t want to make it worse. Was that the
He didn't necessarily regret petting Tony on the balcony – had he truly not wanted it, he wouldn’t have allowed it. And he definitely wouldn't have melted into Steve’s touch the way he did. The poor thing was obviously as touch starved as they come and in need of some attention. Still, the fact that he accepted it from Steve made it clear that he didn't hate the super solider as much as he pretended to. That didn't mean Steve felt any less terrible for accidentally breaking him into a bunch of little pieces. It most definitely wasn't a part of his plan to get Tony to open up.
. That was enough to run most Dominants in their right minds away from him, but Steve didn’t seem to mind. Steve wasn't scared.
“Relax, Tony," Steve shushed him, calling him by his nickname for the first time. He kept one arm wrapped around him while the other hand kept his head cradled against him, "You're gonna be just fine."
"I mean..." Steve started, thinking over his plans for the following morning before confirming, "I don't
Steve paused at the door to make sure Tony hadn’t followed him, but once he was sure he stayed in the bed he began to looking around. Before he could ask Jarvis for further directions, though, a tall cabinet in a corner began to glow (yes, literally
Almost as soon as he mumbled the words out, Pepper laid down the final set of swats on the crease of his ass, right where all his weight goes when he sits. To this, all he could do was let out another miserable howl, bucking over his Domme's lap. It was a shorter set than she usually finished off with, but Tony chopped that up to her being soft with him because she missed him. That may have got him a lighter punishment than he deserved, but he wasn't about to complain. His ass hurt plenty, and the sick, guilty feeling at the bottom of his stomach was now the least of his worries.
This didn't surprise Steve, but it still broke his heart a little bit more. The thought of having to hear whatever it was that terrorized him in his dreams only added to the awful feeling. He was fully aware that Tony was far from ready to unload his trauma like that. Quite frankly, Steve didn't think he was ready to hear it. He knew that didn't matter too much, though; Pepper's point still stood. If for whatever reason he opted to talk about it, then that's what they would do.
And once again, Steve just laughed at him. It pissed Tony off that no matter the amount of back talking and bratty behavior he threw at the man, he never even seemed irritated. He never walked away. He never snapped back. He just laughed. All that did was make Tony want to scream and push until he got the response he was accustomed to.
“How about I just turn around?" Steve offered up as the last attempt, hoping Tony would recognize that he was trying desperately to meet him in the middle, "I’ll still be in the room with you. You'll still be able to see me, but I can't see you, so you can get changed on your own. Is that okay?”
“Yeah, he did and no, he’s not,” Steve confirmed, not being able to help but laugh this time. He couldn't ignore the way he felt something warm in his chest swell knowing that he was able to get such a rare action out of Tony, “He didn’t really…use his words to ask, but I was about to walk away and he told me to wait.”
He nodded to himself, grateful for the A.I's help. He could clearly be useful when Tony was choosing to be petulant. Steve couldn't help but chuckle when Tony rolled his eyes and grunted up at the ceiling. He clearly didn't want to have to change his clothes, and Jarvis blew that for him.
“Yes, Madam,” came the familiar response from Jarvis, and before the sound of the bass of his deep voice had even faded, Pepper was tugging Tony over her lap.
"Anthony," she spoke back to him, matching his soft tone with a warm smile, "We told you that you'd get the phone back."
He also knew that she wasn’t letting this go and he wasn’t getting away with it. The logical part of his brain
The word came out as a shriek, causing Steve to sigh. This was definitely becoming a tantrum, and the ‘easy way’ was slipping further and further out of his reach. He loosened his grip on Tony to the point where he was barely touching him but could still catch him if he fell backward. If he needed some space while he worked through his fit, Steve would give it to him. He would not, however, let him hurt himself.
“I’ve never tried to use it before,” Tony explained tentatively, turning his head so he could awkwardly peek back at her, “I just…always figured I knew what it was…and, well, I was right. You’re not very creative, ma’am.”
Tony was about to try and convince Pepper that he didn't want to leave the phone because he needed to keep talking to her, but then he was made aware of Steve's hand still in his hair. The Dominant gave his tresses a light tug to get his attention and smiled at him when tear-filled eyes met his.
Much sooner than later, it was starting to hurt more than just his feelings. Tony was very sensitive, so it never took much with him; just Pepper's hands could reduce him to tears pretty quickly. It was one of many things he hated about himself, but he couldn't help it. Growing up, he got
“I’m sorry,” Tony finally offered after a long moment of silence, anxiously picking at his comforter. This all still sucked – he didn’t want to be spanked, and he
“Really,” she confirmed with a soft smile, “For you and you only. I’ll be there around seven; I am expecting you to be
Lucky for the both of them, Steve obviously knew what he was doing with a panicky, dropping submissive, because he saw the signs and he immediately reacted.
He felt a small pang of fear as he thought about Steve taking advantage of him with nobody there to help, but he looked at the Dom who was still untying his right shoe and the thought left just as quickly as it came. None of the men who'd ever hurt him before had cuddled him on the couch or took his shoes off for him because he didn't have the energy to do it. They definitely hadn't called Pepper for him to help him calm down. If Steve wanted to hurt Tony, he probably would have done it before then. Besides, Jarvis was always watching, whether babysitting protocol was enabled or not. If Tony told the A.I. to get him help, Jarvis would do just that.
"He headed out just a few minutes ago," Pepper informed him, still combing her fingers through his hair, "Was he as
Steve knew that was the case when he asked, but he just gave an innocent shrug, “Really? I haven’t noticed...”
“I knew Steve was fibbing when he said everything went smoothly,” Pepper continued in an amused tone, much to Tony’s surprise. He was expecting her to be demanding answers, but she just continued lightly, “As much as I’d
"Go ahead and give him the phone, Tony," she directed when he didn't answer, her voice a little harder, "It won't take long, sweet boy."
Once the phone hung up, it was silent. Steve couldn't help but begin to feel nervous again. Now, the real games began, and he could only hope he was ready.
Tony felt his lips part, but he couldn’t come up with anything to say. His face was burning and his mouth was dry and the submissive in him was screaming. Nobody besides Pepper had ever checked him like this before and he was having a hard time pulling together a defense. How did he
She spoke nonchalantly, but Tony knew that she knew what she was doing. At the time, he felt like that was the best news he'd ever received.
"It's okay," Steve cut her off, not really wanting to hear another word about anyone hurting Tony, "I understand. But just so you know, I would never hurt him."
He’d tried to find someone - more than once - but nobody could ever handle him. He ended up getting beat, fucked, and left more times than he wanted to admit because he didn’t know how to just be
to sleep. He never wanted to sleep. He only time he ever did was when he physically didn't have a choice anymore or when Pepper made him.
don’t know what the hell you’re talking about, Rogers,” Tony spat out, his usual anger and flat out brattiness out coming back to him. He didn’t want to do this, but he had to. Or at least that’s what he kept telling himself.
noise in response to the suggestion. Steve expected getting him to sleep would be the hardest part, so he didn't push him any further than that. It would take time, but he'd get it done before Pepper arrived.
“You don’t have to come,” Tony finally forced himself to say, his own stomach turning. The submissive part of him had tears streaming down his face yet again, but his logic and his constant need to not be a bother forced him to continue to lie, “I-I’m fine, Pep, honest. If Helen needs you then I’ll-“
Tony just pouted harder, so Steve continued with something he knew Tony would like a little better, “If you behave yourself and drink some water, I’ll hold you again and help you fall asleep. But, that’s
“Is he gonna be okay?” Steve still couldn’t help but quietly ask after he was sure Tony was out of earshot, turning his attention to the ginger woman on the screen. He didn't like the idea of leaving such an obviously heartbroken sub to his own devices for too long, but he figured Pepper knew what she was doing with Tony far better than he did. Still, Steve had to force himself to stay seated on the couch instead of following behind him.
“Uh, have her call me, Jarvis,” Steve instructed carefully, handing Tony his phone. When he curled up against his chest again and waited patiently for the phone to ring, Steve felt his heart flutter. He was actively seeking him out for comfort. Intentional or not, that was a start.
Well, at least now he did. In the past, he couldn’t care less. Now, though, he'd met Steve. And whether he liked it or not, he wanted to be good for Steve.
When he realized Steve was done, Tony reached up to scrub at his eyes and let out a jaw splitting yawn. Steve didn’t hide his chuckle this time; it was fond and he didn’t hide that either, but Tony didn’t seem to mind. While he was busy with that, Steve shrugged off his blazer and tossed it over the back of the couch. He loosened and removed his tie, and gave it the same treatment. He wanted to lose his belt, too, but he didn’t want Tony to get the wrong idea about anything. They’d done well so far; Tony was putting a lot of trust into him, and Steve didn’t want to ruin that by accident. He’d survive being a little uncomfortable for one night, especially if it kept Tony more comfortable.
Twenty-four hours ago, if you asked him, he would have done anything to get Steve to leave him alone. Like
By the time Tony realized that what he said sounded like the sass she just told him to hold, Pepper was chuckling lightly, “I suppose I could have done a little better than you and Helen’s birthdays, huh?”
to know what trouble you caused, since he didn’t feel the need to tell me, I’ll assume he took care of it. Is that the case?”
If it wasn't for someone calling her name, she probably would have pushed further, but luckily for Steve, she didn't get the chance. Steve heard the quiet conversation for a minute before Pepper was standing up and heading to where he figured she'd be getting ready to board her plane.
being punished for, though, was flat out insolent, Tony. You did it for your own benefit and to have even more free reign than you already had. Do you think that should go unpunished?”
true. He just didn't always act like it. But in the moments he made his promises, they were pure and he had full intentions to keep them. His Pepper knew that, too.
Tony didn’t seem to care about the way he was dressed until Steve pointed it out to him, but even then he just shrugged and pushed at the waistline of his pants. It didn’t take long before he’d given up with no progress, "'m not tired."
Steve was hoping for the easy way; the way where he could just hold and rock Anthony until he fell asleep and then lay him in his bed without his knowing. He didn’t want to be mean (or, at least what Tony would consider mean) but he also wasn’t letting him stay up all night. He pretty much had one job and it was to get Tony to sleep; he did not plan to fail.
“You will hush, Anthony,” Pepper scolded before he could finish, sending him a disapproving look through the phone. They'd been there before, “You know that Helen will be just fine for a couple of days. I am coming to see
hoping they were done with the tears, but it was clear that Anthony’s reaction to every single slight was going to result in crying when he was down like this. The poor thing was an emotional wreck – he couldn’t help it – but it was going to take Steve a little getting used to.
“Wishful thinking,” Steve couldn’t help but chuckle, finally taking a swig from his mug. After one night of putting Tony to bed, Steve figured Pepper probably deserved some type of award if she was getting him to sleep on a proper schedule, “I doubt he’ll stay put long when he realizes he’s in there alone.”
His admiration was cut short when Tony softly announced that he was finished changing, prompting Steve to turn around and smile at him, “Good boy. I knew you could do it.”
"I know you will," she responded cheekily before kissing his head one last time, "Now, back to sleep. I'll be here when you get up, I'm not going anywhere."
Steve was a little excited to hear Tony admit that the way he usually behaved wasn't the real him, not really. It confirmed Steve's theory. He was about to continue to push when he heard his name called in a deep, British accent, “Mr. Rogers?”
"I missed you more, Anthony," Pepper responded warmly, kissing the top of his head, "I promise, I don't like to be gone either. I miss you
A familiar wave of guilt seemed to wash over him as he was forced to remember that this wasn't very fair for
Tony made a face but still settled for a simple nod, allowing himself to be led back to the couch. He was eager to climb back in the Dom’s lap once he sat down, even after the declaration he just made, cuddling against him with a content sigh. His head rested over Steve’s heart, taking fistfuls of the cheap fabric of his shirt. When the Dom pulled the blanket that had been conveniently placed on the back of the couch over both of them, he practically purred.
Overall, that was good news for Steve. He much preferred a bratty but comfortable submissive over a guilt-ridden one who was walking on eggshells trying to ensure he wasn't in any trouble. That in mind, he intended to nip the sub's current distress in the bud as soon as possible. The longer he allowed Tony's thoughts to run free, the more worked up he'd get himself. None of them wanted that.
Was that...a compliment? An insult? Tony didn’t know what to make of it, but he knew Steve was wrong. No amount of help could steer Tony straight. He just knew it, and he didn't want anyone to waste their time trying.
Steve gazed down at the sub resting his head in his lap as he thought, continuing to pet his hair. He was just so
"It's not his fault," Pepper quickly defended, some of the earlier fire coming back into her tone, "He's not that bad."
"Yes, I know, honey," Pepper jokingly sympathized, "I can see how 'not-tired' you are all the way from here. Unfortunately, it's time to rest now."
The relief she felt about the lack of bad dreams seemed to be stumped by that news, but she just settled for a sigh and a nod, “That’s better than nothing. I just hope he’ll stay asleep for a while; he needs it.”
Tony wasn't thrilled with that answer; he didn't like feeling like a bother. Knowing he'd pulled Pepper away from something upset him, whether she claimed it bored her or not. It was just a small burst of emotion, but it wouldn't be long before his anxiety took hold of the thought and ran with it.
He scrubbed at his face with his hands to remove all of the built-up tears and snot (which left his face looking even more of a mess) and tried to suck it up. Sucking it up was often one of his greatest talents, so he figured that wouldn't be too hard.
“Right,” Steve agreed with a laugh. Her words reminded him that it could have gone a lot worse, “Just a little tantrum about having to lie down. He didn’t try to take off, but I was prepared for it, nonetheless.”
Tony wasn’t all the way…back, yet. He’d only slept a few hours and he wasn’t all the way out of his space just yet. This diluted his anger just enough for him not to immediately shoot out of bed, find the big behemoth, and give him a piece of his mind. He still wanted to; he just didn’t quite have the energy.
“He’s begun to stir, Madam,” Jarvis informed her dutifully, ever the babysitter, “Would you like me to inform him of your arrival?”
Steve was sure that Pepper was doing her absolute best. It was somewhat of an impossible situation but he understood that it was the best that could be made of it. For them to still be so close, even after Pepper got married, made it clear that she was putting in an effort to make it work.
Steve chuckled at the smart-assed response, figuring he probably should have anticipated it. He wanted to reprimand him for it, but considering how that had gone last time he decided against it. A little sass was far from enough to ruin what they peace they had going so far, "Well...because I don't."
Much to Steve's relief, Tony giggled in response. He shyly brought a hand up to wipe at the tears that were forced to fall when his eyes crinkled, "Do you know how to work
big, but it wasn't that big), but because he was just so drained. That didn't mean he wanted to sleep, because he definitely did not, but it did mean he'd just rather be curled up with stupid Steve.
big it was for so long. It kept him from drowning in guilt, sure, but the way he was feeling now made up for it tenfold. Now, he was wishing he could go back in time to that night and just mind his curfew instead of being a
He didn’t elaborate any further than that, and his pointing wasn’t really helping Steve in terms of directions. Fortunately, there was a soft light surrounding the miniature fridge on one side of the bar so Steve was able to find it without too much trouble.
, this is part of why he couldn’t do this. Neither his body nor his mind was accustomed to any sort of affection, so whenever he got it he tended to go down too fast. He knew better, and he was stupid enough to allow it anyway. God, he hated himself.
After taking a moment to stretch, Steve dipped off into the restroom to relieve himself. He was sure to be quiet with that and the handwashing that ensued. Once he finished with that, he slowly and stealthily made his way out of Tony's bedroom. He shot one last look over his shoulder to confirm the submissive was still sleeping peacefully as he left the room. Once he confirmed that was the case, he pulled the door up behind him as he exited. He headed down the hallway, following the sound back to the living room where he spotted a tall, ginger woman rummaging through her luggage.
“Yes, you did,” Pepper said after a moment, realizing that Tony had nothing else to offer, “Would you like to tell me
"Of course, sweet boy. I always keep my promises," she assured him with a smile. Steve was glad Tony didn't pick up on it, but her eyes were definitely wet with tears. He couldn't blame her. If Tony said something as sweet and absolutely
Steve wasn't sure if he'd do fine or not, but he nodded nonetheless. He wasn't sure why he doubted himself all of sudden, either, but he most definitely was. He didn't really get nervous. Especially not about basic sub-care. The fact that this was
, nor had ever been, easily spooked. "I'm not scared of him. I know all you want is to protect him, and I'm so glad he has someone like you taking care of him. But I'd really like you to understand that you don't need to protect him from me. Besides, I'm honestly not even
"You're gonna talk about me," Tony grumbled, some of his usual attitude starting to return to him even as he forced himself to sit up. He was still pretty far down, but he was coming up a little bit, or maybe he was just more comfortable with his surroundings (or just Steve, really). As that was happening, a little bit more of him was shining through. He was a much sweeter boy than what he usually pretended to be, and he had a great heart, but he was still kind of a brat.
“You promise me?” Tony asked, turning to straddle him. “You won’t treat me like something breakable?”
. That was another thing throwing him off. Tony couldn’t deny that it made him feel fuzzy inside, but he didn’t get why Steve kept using the nicknames, considering that he was just waiting for the other shoe to drop. This behavior couldn’t last forever. “Uh...I like to build things?” He winced inwardly. That was not an omega task, he probably should have said stitching or handling kids or something, they were certainly more of an omega’s tasks. “I used to have a workshop at home and Howard, erm, father, would leave me,” he mumbled, tugging his lower lip in between his teeth, a nervous tick that Jarvis used to say would make him chew right through his lips. “‘Was nice.”
he doesn’t want scars for this too, doesn’t want it anymore than anything else he’s got. “I’m sorry.” he tries with shaking fingers to pick up the little pieces of glass but he knows he’s got some in his feet and there’s probably blood dripping on the ground, but he’s so tired and he needs to fix this
“I meant together,” Tony said, his shoulders slumping as he brought a hand up to rub over his face. “We haven’t gotten a second of time to ourselves in
Tony smiles at him shakily and rolled out of bed, padding softly to the door as he stayed draped in Steve’s clothes that made Steve’s inner alpha growl.
Tony huffed playfully, leaning in to poke his forehead. “We can’t exactly afford a nice one, Steve. The only thing we can pay for is more of the same shit since my bank account is severely depleted sans Howard."
“No,” he hurried to say. “Not to my babydoll, not for my babydoll, you deserve the best. Nothin’ but that.”
Steve’s face was gentle and kind, even as he looked like he was one gust away from being torn apart. “Tony,” he said softly, and Tony choked on a sob.
Tony hadn't expected to be grabbed by the neck and swore at in an alpha voice to make him settle and hit over the head repeatedly with something blunt until everything swam, and he faded blissfully into the world of darkness.
“Mr. Rogers, do you like Mr. Stark?” Ned asked out of the blue, and Steve muttered something colorful under his breath when he jumped and his pencil jerked.
“Well, we were up for hours, Steve, and I know I’m a handful,” Ton laughed. “I don’t blame you for literally falling asleep. Also, last I remember, your knot was pretty snug.”
Steve pulled back with a helpless whine, moving his hands from Tony’s waist to under his thighs to take the pressure off. He let the corner of his mouth twitch when Tony sighed and slumped all the way into his arms. “Are you alright?”
He loosened as Steve laughed, blue eyes sparkling with mirth. “Nice ta’ know honey,” he managed through laughter as the train’s whistle blew, shrieking and making Tony cringe unbidden. The alpha stood smoothly but Tony didn’t miss the way Steve flinched right along with him at the shrill squeak. He offered Tony a hand, and Tony took it, relishing in his warm hands, and purring unintentionally as Steve helped him into his coat and slid his hands into gloves. “Thank you,” he murmured, curling up under his arm instinctively.
Tony comes too when the door to wherever he is slams open with a bang and the scent of alpha comes in. He thinks he recognizes the scent, turning his nose us and blinking blearily at the source, getting a flash of red hair before curling back into his ball. "Oh my god," the person whispers, footsteps approaching him, and Tony forces himself to straighten to look up because the punishments were always so much worse when he didn't acknowledge the alpha. "Tony?" the alpha whispers and he shrinks into himself, looking at the alpha. It feels like it's been forever since someone's called him anything but bitch.
His omega froze, and a soft noise escaped Tony. Steve didn’t even think Tony recognized it and belatedly he realized that this was probably a little more intimate than either of them were ready to get to, but the omega looked halfway to down from a little and touch and some praise and Steve would be surprised if he could get his clothes off all the way without going into shock or having a panic attack.
“Mr. Rogers, do you like Mr. Stark?” Ned asked out of the blue, and Steve muttered something colorful under his breath when he jumped and his pencil jerked.
“C’mon, honey,” Steve murmured instead of the choice words he had for Tony’s family and reached for the zipper and clasp on the back of the dress. “Let’s get you into something comfortable.”
He realized belatedly that he probably smelled distressed considering he hadn’t had time to pop a scent blocker in between going down (God, he was never gonna live that down, he was so
Tony stared at him a while longer. “I lucked out in the alpha department didn’t I?” he breathed, and Steve’s brain went blank. Hundreds of tours across Europe and the country, giving speeches to thousands of soldiers, and he couldn’t think of anything to say to that.
?” the incredulous shouts came, as Sam and Clint gaped, Natasha looked mildly surprised, which for her was about the equivalent of her jaw on the actual floor, and Thor looked surprised. “Tony Stark?”
“It’s interesting that you like to build,” Steve went on, and when Tony looked up, he looked nervous, rubbing his wrist. “I can’t do anything mechanical for shit.” His eyes opened comically wide and Tony tried -- badly -- to muffle a laugh. Steve blushed all the way down to his neck. “Sorry, I gotta curb in my tongue, Buck says that I’ve got a dirtier mouth than a sailor, though he never spent any time with th’ Tommies, I swear they were worse than me--” Tony noted with amusement that Steve was rambling and rubbing the back of his neck--nervous?
him, good god, and Steve restrains himself from tensing up. He knows omegas like Tony would always expect to be the reason for the anger, or at the very least something to take his anger out upon, and this is probably a rash decision, but Steve promises that he won’t ever make Tony expect to be hit on purpose. He’ s not gonna continue the cycle of violence. “You’re so good,” Steve croons, guiding Tony onto the bed and very forcefully not looking below Tony’s neck where he’s sitting in nothing but a sheer bralette and panties. He knows what they dressed Tony up for, and Steve would rather die than make Tony…
Steve did his best to smile. “Well, I’ll be the first,” he said earnestly. “I’ll come back, sweetheart. After all,” he leaned down to scent Tony. “I’ve got plans.”
i was inspired by reioka's teacher au, so if it seems familiar that's why. you should definitely go check it out!
Bucky growled softly and nosed at Tony’s bonding mark, scenting him. “I gotta surprise for ya lovely, but after that why don’t I give you a massage, huh?”
“Tony, sweetie, I’m not mad,” Steve hushes and he can feel himself being pulled into Steve’s lap. “I’m not.”
Steve shudders and hurries towards Tony, kneeling right in front and holding his ankles, smiling up at Tony’s uncertain face. “You didn’t do anything wrong, baby,” he murmurs, patting Tony’s knee. “And you can always ask, I’ll never be mad at you for asking a question.”
Steve didn’t like to think about what Tony would be like if he’d grown up in a household like the Rogers’, where love passed freely, and how sweet Tony must’ve been to be like that, joyful and free.
Steve groaned and pushed Tony further up the wall, hiking up his dress over supple thighs and tugging at the modest neckline. Steve swallowed Tony’s broken moan into his mouth and wrapped his fingers around the omega’s leg as he wrapped them the best he could around Steve’s trim waist. “Steve,” the omega gasped, shuddering in the most delicious way when the blonde-haired alpha just moved his mouth to his neck. “Steve, stop.”
Tony covered Bucky’s knee with his hand a squeezed. “I know what it means. My best friend, he’s in the air force.”
He shrinks, hips dropping from where he had been holding them up, thighs shuddering and twitching. The alpha sighs, distantly. "They did what they always do to omegas."
Steve hushed him again and got onto his feet, scooping Tony up with careful hands. “Do you wanna sleep some more?”
Tony sniffed and grabbed a fistful of Steve’s tunic. “Heroes never come back,” he said, soft enough that Steve wasn’t sure if Tony was talking to him. “Heroes don’t get happy endings. Hercules, Jason, Achilles, they all died,” Tony looked up with ready eyes. “They don’t get a happy wife and a home, they get killed in some foreign land, fighting someone else’s war, or some god decides that they've done too much and they die of madness or bloodlust.”
Tony shook his head, “In a good way Steve. Your performance yesterday was great, 10/10 would recommend. Well maybe not. I’m keeping you,” he whispered, tugging Steve down for a kiss.
Steve folded him into his arms and Tony was enveloped in warm alpha scent and something that his brain screamed as
Steve reached around to turn the stove off and led them both back to the couch. “C’mon, let’s sit down sweetheart,” he crooned, holding him close. “Sh-sh-sh,” he murmured, brushing away Tony’s hair from his face and running his hand over his back as Tony hid in Steve’s lap. “Baby, I am so sorry.”
“You know, of all places to meet my soulmate, an IKEA would not be the place I thought of first,” Tony choked, staring up at the mass of muscle-y man he had bumped into and immediately felt his soulmate bond spark.
"Oh, sweetheart," the new alpha breathes and strides forward, the footsteps surer than the other ones. He doesn't see what the new person does, but he can feel another set of hands, both flesh and skin and bone this time, gently moving him out of the omega's arms who let’s go of him willingly. He whimpers with discomfort but squirms as the new alpha tugs him into his arms and hold him tight. He feels a hand stroke up and down his back before dipping down between his cheeks and pulling out whatever has been pinching inside him, the bright pink sex toy landing with a thud a few feet away. There's a heavy scent of anger and a growling noise that makes Tony feel all frozen and tight inside before it leavens out and feels something heavy and leather drape over his shoulders and he sniffs it precariously. Smells like the omega.
Steve leaned in and pressed their lips together again chastely, guiding Tony’s head to the hollow of his neck and rocked them slowly back and forth, his heart aching for how young Tony sounded and how stupidly happy he was that Steve was just hugging him. “So long since somebody touched you like what sweetheart?” he said softly rubbing Tony’s back through the thin fabric of his dress. God, his omega must be freezing and Steve wouldn't have even been able to tell. He felt another surge of anger go through him as he realized how used to suffering Tony must’ve been to be able to stand in thirty-degree weather in what was basically just lace and not have even a single tell.
“Which is why I’m pleased to say our beloved Captain is home,” Secretary Ross droned and that was his cue. Steve anxiously stepped out into the stage light eyes squinting a bit under the glare. The crowd was miraculously silent for a moment until Maggie squealed and sprinted towards him.
"Tony, honey, no." he whimpers at the disapproval in his voice. He was trying to be good, why didn't he--Was he doing it wrong? "Bucky you need to get in here. Now."
Steve smiled. “Yeah? I’m glad I could make you feel that way.” he sees Tony melt and his shoulders lose their last remaining tension, and he kept one hand on his waist, as high up as he could without touching his chest or his ass. “Good boy,” he murmurs, quickly unpinning some safety pins from the bodice and skirt, before turning Tony around with gentle hands on his waist. “Tony?” Steve asks quietly when the omega just stared at Steve with big doe eyes, brimming with tears. “Hon?”
“Aw, you think I’m hot?” snarked Clint, jumping off the building. It said a lot that Tony wasn’t even fazed by it anymore, and just twisted to go catch him. “I’m flattered.”
"Tony,” Steve sighed, trying to keep the irritation out of his voice. “We really have to get this done.”
“Alright, are you okay?” Tony finally asked when he saw Bucky show up at his door for the third time in two days, holding a basket -- fabulously smelling, he wasn’t going to lie -- of what appeared to be cupcakes. “This is the third time you’ve shown up in two days.”
“You know damn well that we do,” Tony answered back and thanked Thor that his voice didn’t waver. “Hottest people on Earth, right here.”
Steve thumbed a nipple, watching Tony jolt and bat at Steve’s hands with a pout. “You were sucking my dick as if your life depended on it.”
“Steve,” he interrupted, going out on a limb. At the very least, he would at least know Steve’s boundaries for punishment. “Howard’s got a worse mouth than you do. I don’t mind.”
Tony laughed out loud, before covering his mouth in a futile hope of stopping his surprised laughter. “You burn like a lobster,” he giggled, pressing close to him. “I thought I blushed, but I guess not,” he wheezed, laughing harder as Steve blushed harder judging from the way his face felt like it was on fire.
He scooped the little brunette up and tucked him into the sheets, stipping out of his suit and getting a t-shirt and sweatpants on as well. Normally he slept with just boxers, or at least bare-chested, but he figured the skin-on-skin would just make Tony uncomfortable, judging by how awkward he was already with him. Lord knows they’ve broken more than enough boundaries for the day. “Okay, doll, let’s go ta bed.” he hurried across the room and slid under the sheets with Tony. He swallowed, suddenly nervous and reached a hand across the bed. “If you want to cuddle, you can just come here, but--” Ton moves so suddenly that Steve is taken aback when Tony burrows into his arms.
. He whimpered pathetically, shuddering as the alpha came inside him filing him up in a dirty way that made Tony want to claw off his skin. "No," he moaned, spit dribbling down his chin and dripping onto his chest, jerking with a scream of pain as the alpha tore his knot out of Tony's hole and he was abruptly filled with someone else's cock.
Steve wouldn’t have a problem if Tony wanted to cook, but he knew enough about the Stark household to know their expectations, and he worried (understandably) that Tony only did it out of obligation. “Sweetheart if you don’ wanna cook, I can do it.”
“In here!” came the response and Bucky jogged towards the bedroom faster. He stood in the doorway, seeing Tony sprawling on the bed, two hands over his stomach avidly watching some documentary, even though he did turn to look at Bucky when he came in. “Hi,” Tony said, lifting his arms and making grabby motions.
Bucky didn't need any further encouragement, striding to the bed and tugging Tony into a hug, pulling back to rub his nose against the omega. “Hi, sweetheart,” he murmured, fingering Tony’s collar. “Have you been watching TV all day?” he asked disapprovingly, cupping Tony’s cheek and sitting on the edge of the bed.
“Chatter,” Steve chided, interrupting their snark fest, his shield making a telltale ringing noise as it bounced off of doom bots.
The brunette on the pole turned and winked at them from where he was hanging, before flipping upside down and spreading his legs.
“Hi, sweetheart,” Steve said, opening his arms for Tony, longing for Tony's warmth against his own, as the other man hurried down the stairs and folded himself into Steves's chest.
“No,” Tony moaned, a dam breaking, clutching onto Steve’s jacket with a desperate kind of urgency. “It’s been so long, it’s been
“Well,” Steve said awkwardly. “I assumed this was a longterm thing, so pet names. But if it isn’t--”
Steve laughed, and reeled Tony in, kissing his stomach teasingly and blowing a raspberry. He clutched Tony as he squealed, and tugged him into his lap, hugging him warmly as Tony relaxed. “Sorry, Tones,” he chuckled, ignoring the way his hindbrain (stupid things with its outdated ideas) urged him to sink his teeth into Tony’s unblemished neck. “But we do gotta talk about it.”
“Oh, and Tony?” He called, smiling widely and not bothering to hide any emotion that thrummed through his blood and head and heart until all he could think of was Tony’s soft, chapped lips against his. “Think we both lucked out,”
Steve smiled. His Tony was so sweet. “As long as I’m with you, love, I don’t care where I am, Heaven, Hell, or this damned kingdom.”
“We think Mr. Stark is lonely and he needs a friend,” MJ said calmly from her station, where she was painting--something.
