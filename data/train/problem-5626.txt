However, before he could say another word, the door opens a sliver and and Rhodey pokes his head out, affectively blocking the view into the room. He looks at Steve then the private and says, “It’s fine, the Captain can come in.”
Toni blinks up at him, blinks at the rental motorbike behind him (Toni knows it’s a rental because it’s freaking sports bike), then down to herself. A black tank top, pajama pants that used to be red but now faded sporting grease and coffee stains, and bare feet greeted her.
“Have you visited dad yet?” Toni asks before picking up her glass to take a drink of water.
Steve nods. “Makes me wonder why I put the Valkyrie down in the first place if Hyrda was just going to pop up all over the globe after that. We’ll need to put together a strike team soon and start going after these bases.”
“What?” Steve feels bad for snapping when the woman jumped a bit.
a traveling circus. So, I have some experience. All this to say, I’m not the only one who thinks this is a little fishy, right?”
She’s been cleaned up nicely, with all her nicks and cuts nicely disinfected, her shoulders wrapped in gauze, and her reactor carefully hidden by a dark camisole underneath the button-up shirt Rhodey managed to find her along with a pair of suit pants and a matching jacket.
“Hurry. I actually might die if you don’t.”
Toni frowns at him. “Mission? What?”
Steve gives Toni’s hand a comforting squeeze.
“For you, miss: always,” her AI chimes.
Steve nods.
she types back and scrunching her nose at the way the suit looked in the titanium gold alloy. Not even her outlandish sense of fashion can stomach this. Then she sees the Roadster through the hologram screens next to the suit. Huh.
Hawk pouts, like the five-year-old he really is. “You can still ask him though.”
For a second, King Howard simply stares at him, before a small smile twitches at his mustache. “Yes,” he says, “I believe you are. Sir Carbonell, please, step forward.”
"That's cuz you came around late in the game, Wilson." Dad rolled his eyes, and Peter chose to ignore the way Pops seemed to have stiffen.
Toni sniffs. “Whatever.”
Rhodes grins. “I got the General on my back, fret not, friend. You, however, well...keep an eye out on Tony for me. He tends to make things go boom sometimes.”
“I will when you ask the Widow to a dance, Master Archer.”
Peggy snorts, loud and so full of disgust it momentarily stops Thor in his words. Peggy waves at him to continue. He does, and so does she. “They still claim that it’s too dangerous to gather everyone in authority in the capital so soon. The enemy could still strike back, they say, those fucking cowards. They weren’t the ones sacrificing their lives in the front lines. They didn’t see the destruction our enemies have wrought or the destruction we’ve paid them back with. They weren’t there when we marched Shmidt’s head down the roads to the victory cries of our people. The supposed immortal Red Skull. They act as if they had seen the war when in fact they are spitting on the lives of those who died by saying they don’t think the capital is safe yet. As if their deaths did nothing to secure our lands.
“I’m trying to turn this thing around but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch ‘em.” And  Stane says. Then he points toward Toni’s chest where Steve knows the reactor is hidden safely under her clothes. “Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, drop some specs–”
"That doesn't sound healthy," Steve says.
Natasha blinks, recalibrating. Then she nods. “What do you need?”
Steve settles Peggy on one of the leather loveseats before helping Edwin with a food cart parked in the corner of the room, handing Peggy a cup of tea and some biscuits while Edwin sorted Howard out.
Howard grits his teeth. "Can't give a definite answer on that, Toni."
“He’s awake now, if you’re wondering.”
Christine shake her head, and the movement finally snaps Toni’s attention back to her. The blonde has a disbelieving smile on her face. “ I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.”
Steve sits in the uncomfortable hospital chair across from the door to Howard’s room, foot tapping against the floor to the music he had playing in one ear while he stares down at the book in his hands, half of his mind absorbing the letters as the other half catalogs every little sound and scent in the hallway.
“Captain, I need you to check this,” Hawk’s voice says behind him.
Toni nods. “A-SAP.”
Peggy gives her late husband’s picture on her desk an apologetic smile. “You’ll forgive me for this, won’t you love? I know you’d understand. Just keep watch over me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Edwin motions him out first before following after him and leading the way to a private room. Steve knocks on the door before pushing it open. Surrounded by beeping machines and hooked up to most of them, Howard Stark looked nothing at all like the fierce business tycoon he’s been known to be. Instead, he looks just like any aging old man. But when Steve meets his eyes, there’s still a fire burning there—the same spark he’s seen in Toni’s gaze many times before.
That was her thoughts three months ago.
“I’m not asking you to befriend the boy,” Peggy continues, voice tired as she rubs at her temples. “You don’t even have to give him a chance. Simply watch over him when needed.”
“I kept tabs on you,” Steve replies, seeping as much calm as he can into his voice. Some very selfish part of him had hoped that they would never have this conversation, that perhaps they could move on from their past. But Steve also knew that their tentative and unspoken truce wouldn’t hold forever. “Is that so hard to believe?”
A cheer goes up at his words.
Steve blinks.
Her heart swells with emotion and she knows her eyes are red with unshed tears. She’s done crying. Pepper wasn’t though. And neither was her dad.
No one answers because it brings them back to the reality of normalcy. Steve could practically see the cloud of defeat hanging over their heads.
And so, not another peep is heard and they reach the throne room in silence.
Last he saw of Bucky was when SHIELD doctors (
, was left unspoken.
Toni wants to laugh, so she does, but it probably came out as an ugly huff if she’s to go by the concerned furrow of Steve’s brow. Right. She needs a nap. She shakes her head. “Yeah. Maybe just a little tired.”
When Bucky received his after a month since his arrival from Wakanda, trigger-free yet not entirely the Bucky from the forties, and Pops breaks the glass he was holding after Dad leaves the room...Peter wondered, not for the first time since this all started, how long Dad was gonna ride out the petty wave for.
Toni looks down to her chest and huffs, a wry smile twisting at her lips. Steve doesn’t think there’s anything funny. “They saved me, actually. They needed me alive so they made do with what they had to make sure the shrapnel stays away from my heart.”
"Because you don't have a history with baby Stark." Natasha's smirk comes through loud and clear even without Bucky looking at her.
Stane chases after her. “Oh, c’mon, Toni, Toni!”
“And I need to see the cargo for myself.” Steve taps Rumlow’s box. “This goes in the third cart over.”
Hef turns around before beaming. “Toni! What a surprise!”
They settle on the old thing, all lumpy yet strangely comfortable and Steve’s pretty sure it’s the same one she had in her dorm at MIT.
Who? Oh, yeah, Jarvis. Wait, no, not Edwin. JARVIS. JARVIS…
"Comms check!" Clint shouts back at them.
Toni smiled back up at him.
Toni shakes her head. “No. No doctors. I can’t trust them not to spill no matter how many NDAs we make them sign. I can’t risk the public, or God forbid, all the others who want me dead to know. Plus, it’s stable and the infection is expected. It’s easily combatable.”
“What?” he asks, incredulously, looking down at her. “I leave you alone for several hours, Toni. Not even a full day. What were you doing?”
"Uh, Dad, Doctor Strange, I think I found how to stop these things," he called in, "but I don't know how."
Toni’s already shaking her head. “No.”
The clouds in Bucky’s eyes bled out as his gaze goes to Steve, clear and intent as he picks up on Steve’s mood, like he always used to do when they were still kids and blissfully unaware of their future.
Howard was perched on a barstool next to her, eating his own cookie with a mug of coffee and a pile of unopen mail that he doubted he'd be able to make a dent in even if he had all afternoon to look through it.
A nurse points down a hall. “Last door on your left, Captain.”
“Because this is what we’ll be mostly doing for the foreseeable future,” Steve replies dryly.
Honestly, napping’s suddenly the last thing on Toni’s mind right now, because her godmother’s coming, she needs to replace her old reactor ASAP, fix the damage she’s done by shutting down the weapon’s division–
“With pleasure, Spider Boss.”
Steve looks away from her reflection to meet her gaze, eyebrow cocked as he continues to smile. “Like this how?”
Toni looks down to her chest. “Was. It’s an antique now and I need your help to instal this new one. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. Just ran into a little speed bump.”
The castle doors swings shut behind Rhodes.
“Shit,” Steve says under his breath just as the elevators come to a stop.
Steve takes a sip of his drink and works of dividing the fruit bowl into the plates as Tony says, "Better now. Though, I don't think I've used so much aloe vera gel before. This is definitely worse than that one trip to the beach we did in eighty-six."
In sync, Steve stands with his men and steps forward, bowing low at his waists “My King, we have returned upon your call. Please, bestow on us your will.”
Toni nods. “That’ll be all, Mister Potts.”
Toni smiles, reserved for the press. “You got it. A little cabin fever. I’ll be just a minute. In-and-out.”
The young man flashes him a rakish grin. “Tony Jarvis at your disposal, Captain. Well, not really, but I always wanted to say that. I’ll be one of the help for Sir Carbonell’s people.”
Despite the gelatinous liquid dripping from his quivering hands, Potts was looking down at Toni with such tenderness Steve felt like a Peeping Tom from witnessing such a moment.
Toni stares at the design of Mark One, the memory of donning on its’ pieces still fresh in her mind, Yinsen frantically helping her before eventually giving his life. She manipulated the hologram, tilting open the face plate, removing the bulky chest plate and chunky outer armor, tossing them into the equally holographic trash can.
"Never gonna let me live that down, huh?"
He waves the cameras away and steers Toni around so his back is to the crowd.
They all turned to see Potts speed-walking towards them, looking a bit harried if Steve were to go by the other man’s rumpled clothes and wind-blown hair. “The office is in a bit of a hurricane right now,” he says as he comes to a stop around their little huddle.
JARVIS doesn’t say anything else and instead starts the fabrication process just as she had asked. Toni smiles before she pushes herself up from her work bench, reaching for her mug of cold coffee before heading over to the kitchenette in the corner of her workshop to fetch the Saltines.
A few beats of silence goes by where they just stare at each other, gauging each other. Toni knows how this game goes, and so does Christine. “You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction?”
Toni nods a bit gathering her thought, "Well, doin' a little better than walkin'."
to be alone for it. She needs to face this by herself.
"I think...I think I need bleach...yeah, definitely bleach."
“How is my girl doing, Steve?”
“Tomorrow around noon. She wants to go out for lunch.”
Steve pauses at the last step of the stairs and looks back up to the second floor of Toni’s Malibu home before answering Peggy, “She seems more distraught over Howard than the fact that she was held in an Afghanistan cave for three months. I don’t know if that makes me feel relieved or more worried.”
Steve stares at the tablet in his hands, haunched over the device where he sat in the back of the Quinjet Fury had sent to pick him up from California. It’s been two hours at most since Steve saw Toni off into the care of her friends and family. He should’ve known she would’ve pulled something like this. He only wished it hadn’t come with such a dangerous repercussion.
Potts nods. “What the Captain said.”
Edwin hesitates. “Doctors says it’s not looking too good.”
“Planes have wings,” she says to Steve as he’s lifting her from the floor, careful so he doesn’t slip.
Toni slowly nods, suddenly weary. “Lunch. Okay...I should get everything done by then. JARVIS, how’s the fabrication–”
“Tony,” Rhodes groans.
“I need a scotch. I’m starving,” Toni tells the bartender before turning to Phil. “Agent. Fury let you out to play tonight?”
“Miss?”
“Just don’t know who to trust right now,” she tells him, and that...that probably stings even more. With Hydra/SHIELD, her kidnapping, and all those Stark weapons...she’d be a fool not to be suspicious even if she doesn’t want to. Ignorance is bliss, and she’s been ignorant for too long. “‘Til further notice, why don’t we just keep it all on my private server.”
State nods with his own reserved smile. “Alright.”
“It’s doesn’t matter,” Toni insists, continuing the discussion, “we own the controlling interest in the company.”
“I’ve made a breakthrough.” Toni joins him in front of the stove and dutifully takes the bowl he hands over to her.
Steve fought him, hand to hand and found himself almost overpowered a few times. Then the mask fell off and Steve’s world shifted yet again.
“I would like to apologize if that’ll make a difference,” Toni says quietly.
“You’re a soldier?” Steve asks, brows raising.
Steve was waving at her from the other side of the tinted window. Dutifully, Toni rolls it down. “What can I do you for, Cap?”
(let’s ignore that I was gone for a while, yeah?)
“No,” is Tony’s immediate reply. “But I helped out where I could. Mostly with Rhodey.”
"How are you, dearest?" Peggy asks as soon as the server was out of earshot.
turn his face away, unreadable. Her breath hitches. “Are we?”
Toni rubs at her watering eyes.
There was static in Peter's ear which he was well acquainted with now to distinguish it as Doctor Strange's sigh and not a fritz in the comm line.
One his other side, Aunt Pepper rubs his back.
Peter tells himself not to cry.
It reminds her of the time she and her family went to vacation at one of their lake houses. They brought Steve who had just been defrosted for two months, hoping it will help sooth the man just a little. Toni remembers being very fascinated by him (still is), and as a ten-year-old she felt maybe she could do something for him. So, she begged and begged her dad and the Jarvises for a picnic/swim party. They agreed and within a few hours, they had a table set out near the lake dock with finger foods to tide their hunger while Edwin manned the grill with Steve. Toni could hardly contain herself as Ana helped her tie up her watermelon-themed swim suit and almost jumped into the lake if she hadn’t remembered her plan all along.
He doesn’t get to Toni fast enough, however.
The chuckles get louder. "Was it Ivan?"
The landline rang just as Toni opened her mouth to ask yet another question, and Howard thanked whatever diety was out there for the interruption. He loves his daughter, truly, but sometimes, it's just hard talking to her, because even after five years, Maria's ghost still hovered over Toni with her beautiful smile and doe eyes.
Toni waves them both off. “Don’t worry this is perfectly safe. Last time I did this was in a less sanitary environment with trigger happy terrorists watching, so I say this is a huge step up. Come on, Pep. Cap, you can hold my hand if it’ll make you feel better.”
“I’d like to open up a new project file indexes as mark two,” she continues, mind fully back into work mode. Rhodey’s rejection still stings, but she has to do this no matter what. She pulls up the digital blue prints of Mark One and, with a guide pen, leads it over to the hologram table.
Steve ends the call.
Steve gently shakes his head, unable to hide his grin as he says, “It’s quite alright, Lady Potts. One of my men had temporarily lost his hearing for a while so we all had to learn the Signs to communicate with him.”
Steve keeps an eye on Toni out of his peripheral as she reaches into the toaster and plays hot potato with a slice of garlic bread before dunking one end into her stew.
He slowly takes off his gloves and places a hand over her knee. Her eyes flicker to him and finally focuses on his face. “I’m sorry,” he says, “I didn’t realize it was that bad. Have you had a doctor look at it, at least?”
“Ah.” Steve nods. “You got a moment to spare, then?”
“How old are you?” Steve asks with a frown.
“Of course it is.” Toni wipes at her face and arms. “I wouldn’t have stuck it in my chest if it wasn’t. And anyway, where did you run off to?”
Bucky calls for another refill.
“Toni!” Steve snaps his eyes back up to the hologram, terrified of what he might see.
Stood at the end of the dock to the Stark-Roger’s lake house, Dad and Pops watched each other while Thor (who’s slowly gaining back the muscles he had lost) spoke on about the hardships and trials and eventual rekindling of the two’s love as the officiator of their vow renewals.
With a huff, she leaves her bed, tugging on an old MIT sweater over the cami she wears to bed and a pair of joggers, before heading down to her lab. The lights are out in Steve’s borrowed room when she passes by it.
Potts blinks rapidly at the tablet with a bewildered look. “What?”
“I never got the chance to know mom,” she tells him, and her speech finally starts to come together in her mind, so she continues, louder this time so everyone can hear, “I never got to know my mother. I have so many questions for her. Growing up, everyone told me that she was an amazing woman, someone who set up charities for children orphaned by the war, for other women who lost their husbands, for soldiers who came back but whose souls never left the battlefield. I would like to ask her if she ever felt conflicted with what Stark International did for the weapons industry, if she ever had doubts about her husband. Or maybe she had found peace in knowing that what she did healed others...”
Steve shares the man’s anger, and as he looks around the fire, he knows so does the rest, but Steve has long since realized that Peggy loves Prince Anthony, and for whatever reason, she continued to love him even as stories of the young Prince’s...shenanigans reached them on the front lines.
Steve strides in with his squadron behind him, and what portion of the court that had returned to the capital watch them with curiosity, whispering amongst themselves. The throne room is as grandiose as Steve last remember it to be, all marble and stone with the Kingdom’s banner hanging from every pillar in gold and reds, and at the head of it all, His Majesty, King Howard sat on his throne, while Her Majesty, Queen Marie sat next to him, and behind her stood Peggy. They were all regal as ever, Their Majesties dressed formally, while Peggy wore her uniform.
Still, when Dad finally pulled back, Sam looked like his soul had left the building.
“Yeah.” Steve looks to her. “Yes, you have.”
“Why the hell are we doing this?”
Steve is an emotional man, though no one would believe Toni if she told them that. His poker face is enviable and the reign he has on his reactions is absolutely impressive. But Toni has grown up around Steve. She’s seen him adjust to the new century; had heard him break down and rage at Howard for saving him. Steve has a lot of emotions that he chose to suppress because with the shield, with the Captain America cowl, following each step he took, people looked to him to be the level-headed one.
“Hey Toni,” Steve says, suddenly standing right in front of her. It takes her a second to realize he has a hand on her shoulder and another second to comprehend that he was steadying her because she was suddenly swaying on her feet. Great. “You okay?”
So I stumbled across this manga called Barbarities and one of the main characters reminded me so much of Tony is terms of character design. There was a short secret identity plot in the first chapter, but that was enough to get my brain going and before I knew it, this happened...
“Hey, Buck. So I won’t be back anytime soon.”
“Of course you are,” he says in the way that borders on placating and judging. “You’re Toni-fucking-Stark.”
Toni frowns at the blond. “I resent that. My back took the brunt of the fall.”
“Where are we?” Toni asked after her eyes roam around the crude room they were being held captive in.
” Hawk says, tossing a twig into the middle of their bonfire.
Peggy sighs once more, eyes turning to the flames. “The Crown Prince is arriving tomorrow.”
“Want me to bring Toni?”
Steve looks up from typing a reply to Peggy about lunch as he caught sight of Toni. He pushed off the side of the car from where he'd been leaning against it, and asks, "How'd it go?"
Steve takes that as his cue to step forward while Rhodey moved aside and waves at the medical crew to hurry up. Steve kneels in front of Toni and takes her hands into his, peering into the abyss that is Toni Stark’s doe eyes. “It’s me, Bambi.”
Instead of answering, JARVIS opens a hologram in front of him and displays a satellite feed of…a silver suit of armor flying through the night sky. Steve doesn’t bother picking his jaw up from the floor as the suit, no, Toni, rockets past the Santa Monica pier and over the building before she shoot straight up, higher and higher. “JARVIS, what is she doing?”
“There’s garlic bread in the toaster.”
Tony is quick to recover, bating ridiculously long lashes at him. “My, my, Captain, so forward. Has no one ever told you it’s quite rude to ask a gentleman for his age?”
They stop outside a heavy, mahogany door Steve hasn’t seen in ages, and Peggy curves her red lips up at him, “We’re not completely blind. She was taken by a group called Ten Rings. We have plenty of reason to think they’re affiliated with Hydra.”
Tony Jarvis.
“No?” Pepper’s eyes bores holes into her profile.
“You know I was naive before, when they said, ‘Here’s the line. We don’t cross it. This is how we do business.’ If we’re double-dealing under the table,” Toni trails off as she watched Obi, her
Steve has seen and been around Toni’s workshop back in New York over the years and to see her workshop now is no less awe inspiring. It’s all sleek angles and organized chaos of an engineer. In the middle of it all, Toni sat on an inclined chair, wearing shirt with a cut so low it showed off the reactor in her chest and the wires taped just below her collarbones hooked up to a heart monitor. Potts typed in a code on a holographic screen next to the door.
Steve opens his mouth, “Who–”
There was a pause then a quiet chorus of ‘Miss Stark’ goes around while one guy raises his own. Toni recognizes him and points. “Hey, Ben.”
"Toni?!"
They find her three months later.
“Touché.” Tony lifts a shoulder in agreement. “I am twenty-six if you are still curious.”
“Recovering back in New York. Jarvis said he’s already threatened to fire him a dozen times for making sure he keeps to the doctor’s orders of bed rest.”
It took Dad a while to start giving the "Rogue" Avengers kisses again after the whole Accords debacle.
Tony snorts into his tankard before he starts to violently cough, a fist pounding against the table while Rhodes slaps a hand against his back.
Rhodey shuffles a bit to make space for him, but doesn’t let go of Toni’s hands. Instead, he drops a kiss to her knuckles and keeps his lips pressed there while Steve joined him on the floor. Toni stares at her lap, anguish twisting at her beautiful face, and Steve feels a little guilty for the relief that floods him because at least her face was no longer blank; no longer neutral as if she had nothing left in her.
He squeezed the hand on her knee and she immediately reaches for it. Steve allows her to hold it and watches as she stares into his eyes and says, “You have to promise though...you’re the only one who’ll read it. Not Aunt Peggy, not Fury, and definitely not my father.”
When they landed, the base was a flurry of activity and Steve immediately pushed his way through the throng to get to the medical building where he comes to an abrupt halt. He expected it to be as busy as it was outside but instead of the rush to provide Toni Stark with the best medical care they can offer, doctors and nurses alike stood around, nervous and confused. They all turned towards him in perfect sync when he burst through the doors.
“You call Captain Rhodes, Rhodey?” Hawk asks the question on the tip of Steve’s tongue.
She looks down and sees her chest wrapped in gauze and two wires trailing out between the layers. She follows its length over her shoulder towards another table where it connects to a car battery.
Toni can’t sleep.
“Now I just need you to reach in and lift the wire out,” Toni says breathing deeply as relaxes back into the chair. “Your fingers are about as slim as I need them to be and if my hands were longer I’d do this myself but alas, here we are, so go for it.”
“Can you hear me, Captain?”
“What’s going on, Edwin?” Steve asks as they rode up to the third floor. “When did Howard wake up?”
Toni stumbles across a worn tennis ball just before she reaches the door and lobs it across the room for DUM-E to chase. The bot gives a delighted trill as he wheels after the ball. Toni chuckles and finally makes her exit, regretting her decision to take the stairs almost immediately.
“Hey, hey, hey, Toni, listen.”
“Next time, you ride with me, alright baby girl?” Rhodey says as he pulls back.
Toni doesn’t answer, her gaze stuck to something on the other side of the room. Steve tracks her line of sight and ignores the slight twinge behind his lungs when he finds Potts. The man is sharply dressed in a blue suit that’s obviously been custom-tailored for him.
Across the sea in a small Italian cottage overlooking a clear, quiet beach, a Stark phone buzzes with a message on the bedside table. It’s drowned out by the sound sighs, shared soft kisses, heady groans, choked off moans and the slapping of skin against skin.
She could feel Christine’s eyes boring holes into the side of her face. “Yesterday.”
“Thank you, Rhodey-bear.”
In the split second after she pressed the hand control buttons, Toni is airborne before her world tilts upside down, pain explodes across her knees and shoulders, and she’s back down to earth.
“So, Tony,” Bucky suddenly says, and Tony swivels around to face him. “Any reason aside from being the help for the help that you’re assigned to this political caravan?”
Toni wiggles a bit in his arms which he understood as her silent request to be put down which Howard complies to. Once back on her feet, Toni reaches for his hand and tugs him towards the table. "I was making something for you!"
Steve hums.
“Take care of yourself, okay?” he murmured against her skin before he took a deep breath and went back to his bike, this time not sparing another look behind him, using all of his self control when Toni’s wreaked sobs trailed into the night and was drowned by his bike’s engine.
“I had coffee.”
“I’ll see you around, Captain!” Rhodes calls over his shoulder.
Toni lifts a shoulder. “Sure, what’s up?”
Steve can make out Toni’s familiar silhouette through the tint of the glass doors leading out to the balcony. He sidesteps and plants himself by one of the pillars next to the door, hidden from Toni and Potts' view, but still able to keep an eye on the room.
Toni watches as her bots clean up the mess that used to be the Shelby Cobra, pressing an ice bag to her head as she slumps further on the couch.
than I anticipated.”
Dummy slumps again, making his disappointment well-known.
Natsha got hers first when she came down to the shop, a mug of coffee in one hand, and hot chocolate in the other. Peter thanked her with a hug, and Dad did so with a kiss to her cheek. She only froze for a second, before she smiled at them both and bid them good bye, leaving with a reminder not to overdo it.
Howard hands him the tablet. “These...are the shipping manifestos over the last...thirty years of every Stark weapon that has ever been made. At first glance it looks correct. In fact, it is. However, upon a much, much closer look, well. Once I found the pattern, it was easier to find and identify.”
The hologram of the new reactor blueprints floated in front of her in doubles and Toni knows it wasn’t supposed to do that.
Tony yelps when Rhodes flicks at his ear and sighs, saying, “Forgive him, Captain, he was raised in a barn.”
Obi– no, Stane, meets her gaze, steady as can be and Toni knows. “Does dad know?”
“This was– This was a Board of Director’s meeting?” Toni repeats in disbelief, shooting her godfather a bewildered look. “Who was going to tell me?”
“It is somewhat my business, though,” the young man says, nudging at Rhodes’ side with an elbow and an amused quirk of a dark brow. “They’ll be guarding our caravan after all. If they’re not all that up to the task, then I need to know so I can make adjustments for my own safety.”
“Pulling a Wright brothers,” Toni quickly replies from the cradle of his arms. “Maybe I should replicate the wings?”
“Toni’s been kidnapped.”
Pepper shares a look with Happy, but neither of them say a word in further protest. Instead, Happy radioes Jarvis’ car and lets them know of the change in plans.
Bucky disguises his agreeing grunt as he pierced the sand with the shovel once more.
Pepper's hands are warm as they curl around her own where they were fiddling with her own mug of coffee. His eyes are clear and Toni feels the tension between her shoulders release. "Okay," he says quietly. "I trust you. You've never once given me an excuse to not trust you, Toni. Question my sanity, yes, but never to not trust you."
Toni tries to play it cool, tries to calm down the roaring in her ears as she shakes her head. “I didn’t approve any shipment.”
Dazed by the sudden request/order, Toni can’t do much but nod, really. Not that she’ll deny it anyway because she had already done it. The Ten Rings are dead, Yinsen took the blueprints to his grave, and she hadn’t let any of the doctors see her. When she got back, she had JARVIS clear the web of any pictures that has been taken of her upon her return that may have even hinted at the reactor in her chest.
Toni starts to smile just as she catches Dummy start to move out of the corner of her eye. She quickly raises an arm out towards him. "No– AH-AH-AH!"
Toni spots Stane just a few seconds after Steve and she taps his arm. Steve appropriately slows down so Toni could give her greetings to the man. She easily cuts in through the conversation Stane is having with a gaggle of reporters saying something about having a great quarter or something.
you,” Tony says with a shrug before his mouth twists into a wry grin, “Kinda hard not to. Word of your brave Knight-Captain and his loyal squadron is always quick to spread amongst the soldiers. Not a day went by that I didn’t hear of some unconventional plan going off without a hitch with Hatten’s Unshakable Shield at its helm.”
Steve steps back as Toni hops off the chair and Potts wipes his hands on a towel.
"-what was his name?"
Peter didn’t really care (neither did Pops and Morgan). Dad is alive and well and renewing his wedding vows with Pops as the rest of their friends and family watched on, Peter’s back from being dusted, and he has a little sister!
Nat hugs him and Clint throws him a salute which Steve returns. Then he’s off and watching as the jet lifts off and disappears into the night sky. When he turns around to the gate, it was already opening and the familiar stature of one Edwin Jarvis was standing at the front doors. Steve jogs up the drive and greets the butler with a handshake, taking note of the weary slump in the man’s shoulders.
Toni takes one last mental check of everything, taking in a fortifying breath. She really doesn't want to get flung at another wall. "In three, two, one."
Toni doesn’t.
“Oh, hey,” Toni says, like she didn’t just watch the woman cut through the crowd and plant herself in the open space by Toni’s side.
"Huh."
The fire extinguisher droops with the bot but Toni pays him no heed, shifting a bit in the boots to get more comfortable. She's nervous, her hands are shaking, but she's also excited. Back in the cave, there was no room for such luxuries as it was a matter of life and death. But here, back in her home, she can let herself be that four-year-old who excitedly ran up to dad with the circuit board she just finished putting together.
Steve frowns at the brunette. “Toni shouldn’t we have a professional do this?”
“Fury has some ideas.”
His phone vibrates in his coat’s pocket. It’s a text from Coulson. A file. Encrypted.
“Forgive me, then, General,” Steve chuckles, finally sheathing his sword. “Tell me, what shall I do to earn your mercy?”
Toni wiggles a bit in the boots, idly wondering if she made them a bit too big. “We’re gonna start off nice and easy. We’re gonna see if ten percent thrust capacity achieves lift.”
“Mr. Rogers,” the man greets before ushering him down the hall towards the elevators.
“Still Howard.” Steve smiles wryly. He’s never been fond of Obidiah Stane, too much of a businessman for his taste, but his contributions to Stark Industries are no joke, and Howard trusts him so Steve tries not to antagonize the man...too much.
“Listen, I’ve worked in politics before,” Hawk says, “not on the level of the court, of course, but a traveling circus isn’t
Bucky looks up from strapping on his gloves at Natasha who directs the question to the room at large. She's standing opposite the bench he sat on of the military plane Fury had found for them (apparently, the Quinjets don't take too kindly to sand in her turbines), checking her weapons.
“I don’t really trust a lot of people right now, Pep. So when it comes down to it, you’re the one I’m gonna go to...and I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
"Chatter." And Peter is well acquainted with Pops' voice to know that the blond man is not happy.
Steve Rogers stood outside her front door, hands stuffed in the pockets of his jeans, and looking for all the world like a H&M model with a blue shirt two sizes too small stretched dangerously across his broad chest, a leather jacket tucked in the crook of one arm and a pair of aviator glasses pushed carelessly into his blond head of hair.
Toni blinks and realizes she’s been slowly munching on the same cracker for a whole minute now. She shoves the rest into her mouth before pushing off the counter while dusting her hands off from any crumbs. “Yeah, sleep. Gotcha. Wake me up as soon as you’re done with down here.”
Toni smiles to herself as she watches her best friend from a good distance. He’s clearly got the full attention of the group of pilots. But it’s her time to shine now.
They’ve already reached the elevator but instead of pressing the call button, Toni turns around to face Stane. Steve presses the button.
Steve stares, immobilized by everything that’s just happened and unable to stop DUM-E from dousing the crash site with his fire extinguisher.
Toni’s vain, ask any of the tabloids that dedicate pages to her vanity. Too bad for them, Toni is human enough to admit to it. She likes being fit, she likes looking good, and she likes that people find her attractive because of those factors.
"Nope. I don't think so." A loud bang echoes out after Dad's answer as the dummy explodes, flaming limbs flying out to the four corners of the earth. He turns to Pops with a frown. "Must be your age catching up to you, honey. See you at dinner."
Steve watches with mild horror and a lot of concern as Tony’s coughing fit transitions into a full-belly laugh, ale running down his chin. “Oh, my gods!” he cries gleefully. “I can see that! I can clearly see it! She would!”
Toni’s mouth drops open in indignation even if her eyes told him she was proud of him for the joke. It doesn’t stop her from punching his arm though. “Jerk.”
"And we were having such a moment," Toni sighs, not quite successful and in keeping the smile off her face.
Obie was understandably less enthusiastic as her. He was the one dealing with the board after all, and simply saying, “Green energy,” wouldn’t smooth out all the ruffled feathers. So she promised to lay low and leave the board to him. Which worked out great in Toni’s favor.
She still couldn’t get the look of frantic fear in Steve’s eyes when she finally lifted herself from the wreckage of her landing out of her head. The image is at the forefront of her mind as if it had frozen there. When the as the last time she saw him like this? There’s a fuzzy memory from way back when he first came out of the ice, but not since.
“Okay.” Steve nods. “That’s fine.”
(Don't let her professional mask fool you into thinking she isn't being petty to Pops in her own way.)
“It’s nothing, just a little snag,” Toni waves him off then reached for the reactor in her chest and twists. “There’s an exposed wire-” she grunts as she slowly pulls the reactor up, “-and it’s contacting the socket wall, causing a bit of...shortage.”
“Howard,” he greets curtly. Better let it be known that this was an unwanted call.
Peter did not want to think of the implications of
“Hey, I’m just the messenger. Pegs is on her way.” Steve shrugs and accepts one bottle when she held it out to him.
“Do we wanna keep tailing them?” Clint asks.
"All done!" Toni declared triumphantly, holding the watch out to him.
Steve frowns. Suspicion and confusion waged a short war before he decided not to voice any of his thoughts and nods instead. “Okay. I’ll be over in a bit.”
Pepper leans forward as he says, “Take us to the hospital, Hap–”
She saw them and waved before stumbling to her knees, holding out a peace sign as they came around to land. Rhodey was already rushing towards her even before the helo finished landing. Steve wasn’t too far behind him, though he hung back as Rhodey wrapped his arms around Toni, fierce but mindful of her injuries which Steve took inventory of.
Peggy takes a deep breath. “I apologize, that was uncalled for. But, you also should know better by now, Hawk. I make no excuses for Anthony, but that child has been through a lot in his own way, and I would appreciate it if His King’s Knights would not alienate him on his first day back in the capital.”
was Miss Stark, Captain.”
The glass door opens automatically, making Toni look up from whatever she and DUM-E were working on. Is that a boot?
“The reactor, who else knows?”
"Are you staying for Christmas?"
Steve does just that, taking note of the tablet Howard had propped up on the overbed table.
A doctor near him answers, “Miss Stark refused any help from us, Captain.”
With a start, Toni’s gaze snaps up from the book in her hand to the hospital bed.
"Why do I put up with you?"
Steve stops himself from smiling because that was such a Toni-thing to say and he hopes—prays, really to a God he’s not so sure he believes in anymore—that his Toni was still somewhere in this new woman that sat before him, forged in the fires of war that he never wished for her to see.
The question, though delivered innocently and with nothing but child-appropriate curiosity, stabbed at Howard's heart. Jarvis and Ana already gave him enough scathing glares everytime he left for another expedition to last him a lifetime. Still, he tried to smile at Toni as he answered, "I don't know, pumpkin."
“I’ll be at home if you need me!”
Another sentence, and another translation; “He is honored.”
“Just because I brought you pizza back from New York doesn’t mean it went bad.”
“–It’ll give me a bone to throw the boys in New York!”
And just like that, Steve’s already on his next mission. He types in a number in his phone and waits for the other person to answer.
Toni tilts her head at the red and gold of the suit and smiles before checking the time. Then she types out,
"Solar."
Toni’s gaze remains on him, hard and cold. “Yeah, Steve, that’s a little hard to swallow considering you made it very clear you wanted nothing to do with me—with us Starks.”
Hawk’s head pops up. “You know me?”
The elevator descends.
“Why would they?” Hawk scoffs. “He brought a lot of disgrace to the Royal Family. I wouldn’t want to see his face either.”
“–and he’s saved my ass more than a couple of times over the last decade. He’s useful in a tight spot, quick on his feet, and if you learn how to properly utilize this kid, you’d find your life on the road a little bit easier.”
Toni woke up with a gasp after flashes of agonizing pain, bloody hands, foreign shouting and ringing in her ears.
Toni crumples the burger wrapper in her hand, gaze flickering over the tops of the reporters heads. Rhodey stood in the back, a small encouraging smile on his lips.
"Don't do that, they'll believe that-"
It was a space still completely foreign to Steve even after being back for over a month and he doubts it will start growing on him anytime soon.
“I want two things.” Toni holds up the amount of fingers she’d need. “One, I want an American cheese burger, and the other is a press conference.”
"He'll be pissed," Natasha says, quirking a red brow.
He settles back down on the MIT couch with his devices, thinking to give Toni a few more minutes with her project before he’ll intervene.
“–but our Tony has a good heart–”
"Okay." She turns around at Dummy's whirring behind her and finds the bot raising his extinguisher. "Please don't follow me around with it either 'cuz I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously."
He stirred something in a pot above the fire he had going. He looks up at her with a raised brow, almost mocking and very passive. “What did
“I’ll admit, I could’ve handled that night better, but don’t you think you’re misconstruing the details a little bit?”
So he nods, backing away, giving her space he knows she needs. "It was nice seeing you, Toni."
Before the media dubbed Civil War, Pops helped Dad and manned the grill with Uncle Rhodey.
There had been a too soft rug under his too soft bed once, but Steve had it removed else he goes crazy. There is only so much softness a man who’s been on the battlefield for ten years can take.
Piloting the plane, Clint remains silent, so Bucky takes that as the archer's way of passing him the hot potato.
“Do you understand me? Do as I do!”
Peter groaned at the nickname as one of the "things" flew towards him. It was an ugly creature of what appeared to be robots fused with fleshy monsters from hell and glowed green.
There was a short silence before Hawk asks, “Is that why Nat’s been so busy lately?”
“Right,” Steve says before he turns her around by her shoulders and starts nudging her towards the stairs. “To bed with you, Stark.”
“No, it wasn’t,” Toni replies in a frigid tone, and when Steve returns his gaze to her, she’s glaring a hole into the table, lips pursed and jaw tight. Then she snaps those deep brown eyes back to him and stands. “But I never had anything to prove to you, Steve.”
Wipping at his neck with a face towel, Peter grins. "S'long as you keep the instant kill mode in there, sure."
Or Happy...
carries over from the other side of the ‘shop. Steve tears his eyes away from his phone to look where Toni had her arms up, as if in victory, followed by JARVIS saying, “Congratulations, Miss.”
Potts had pulled the magnet out.
“Woah, woah!” Steve halts her progress by stepping in front of her, hands up by his shoulders. “Visiting hours will be over by the time you get there, and when I left, Howard was sleeping. You can go tomorrow.”
Shame that he was assigned to the Prince as soon as they got back, so Rhodes had left after the victory celebrations for his new post.
The young man didn’t waste his opportunity to ask the hard questions. “What happened over there?”
“Miss, might I suggest sleeping?” JARVIS, her AI modeled after the butler himself, chimes in softly. “And maybe consuming something other than coffee?”
“To think,” Steve begins with a smile, eyes on the old bot, “that was once your greatest creation.”
Or even Aunt Pepper.
Steve doesn’t jump like Potts when Toni gives the reactor one sharp tug that disconnects the wires from her body, but it’s a near thing.
She sniffs. "I said what I said. And don't believe anything my sour patch has to say. He's still mad at me so anything he says is null, capiche?"
Next to him, General Margaret Elizabeth Carter chuckles under her breath, ruby lips curved into a smile Steve has loved for so long. “No, not really. Just that it’s always precious seeing you watch over your men like this.”
“That’s unfair,” Steve frowns, unable to keep the expression off his face. “You’re the closest thing I have to a family in this era, it wasn’t an easy decision to make, but your father was going down a dangerous path and so were you. I couldn’t stick around and watch that happen.”
Steve shares a bewildered look with Hawk and Bucky, and when he turns to Rhodes for help, the man simply shakes his head, a fondly amused smile curling at his lips.
Jarvis simply heated some milk and brought out a tupperware of chocolate chip cookies. He patted Toni on the head as the girl sat at the kitchen counter munching away at a cookie - a Jarvis recipe.
“Hey, what’s up, punk?”
He has everything he’ll ever need right here in this moment, and he’ll do anything to keep it.
Toni can't believe this. He's serious. "What, 'cuz I'm a woman?"
To him, it’s a small price to pay in order to give complete strangers just that bit of peace of mind.
Steve huffs a fond chuckle as he shakes his head then looks around the open living area. “JARVIS, does Toni still like spaghetti and meatballs?”
The five-year-old in his arms only looked mildly guilty and very much sheepish. "Sorry."
Steve gives her a meaningful smile. “It’s really good to have you back, Toni.”
“There’s our troublemaker,” Obie laughs bending down to accept Toni’s hug. “You haven’t made working easy these days.”
“You, too, Edwin.” Steve allows himself to be ushered through the doors. “How is everything?”
“That’s enough,” Steve finally says. They never once break stride as he continues, “We are His Majesty’s Knights and we will act accordingly. Now, I don’t want to hear another peep about Prince Anthony.”
“I may be dumb, but even I know not to take that bet,” Clint says.
Steve watches the hustle and bustle idly until Sir Carbonell comes out from the castle accompanied by Rhodes’ imposing figure.
“Just wanted to say to take care of yourself.” Steve braces an arm over the car’s roof, effectively blocking the sun with his ridiculous shoulders. “And next time, do ride with Rhodey.”
He was about to start the engine when he came to an abrupt halt because, finally, something Toni said filtered through the angry haze in his mind.
The side-eye glare Steve sends her is quite impressive and tells her that Steve is not at all in a mood. Toni couldn’t find it in herself to be defiant.
"If that's the case, they got your looks," Doctor Strange replied drily.
Toni smiles, breathing easier even with the weight of the reactor in her chest. "Have I ever told you I love you?"
“What’s going on?” he asks the room, frowning.
Sir Carbonell nods, shaking Rhodes’ hand before stepping into the carriage.
“I’ll buy you a cask later. We need to go, now!”
While this all happened, Steve turns his gaze back to Peggy, studying her for a moment before saying, “That’s not all though?”
” Bucky repeats again, waving the stick he’d been using to poke the fire at Hawk who was sat one person away from Bucky, making Sam eye the piece of wood with concern as he was the one most likely to get hit should Bucky’s hand slip. “It’s been, what, a month, more than a month, and that’s the best you can come up with?”
And like that, they’re off, Steve’s cloak flaring out behind them.
Howard ruffles Toni's wild, brown curls with a fond smile before looking at his work table. "What were you doing down here anyway?"
Steve types in a quick reply even though Toni said he doesn’t have to. (He’s a stickler for any AI Toni makes, no matter how rudimentary, sue him.)
“Rhodes!” Steve stands, shaking hands with him after he pulled the young man to his side.
Toni smiles fondly at the older man. “Love you, Obie.”
Even after he and Howard had their fight and he stormed out of the mansion (out of her life, tearing her heart in two and bringing all the pieces with him) like the hounds of hell were nipping at his heels.
“Word sure does travel fast,” Steve says with a pointed look at the other man.
“As you wish, Captain. And thank you.”
"Wanda's gotten one! And she's a late comer, too! Hell, the Vision gets one every morning! You playing favorites, Stark?"
“I’ll catch you inside, Hef.” Toni pats the man’s shoulder before sliding back against Steve’s side.
"That party!" Toni waves to the remaining screen where the news continued to play and hurried up the stairs. A second later she hears Steve follow.
“I saw young Americans killed...by the very weapons I built to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I...” she takes a breath, “had become part of a system the is comfortable with zero accountability.”
He showered Peter in them since day one, and those who got them were honorary Starks. Like Uncle Rhodey, and Aunt Pep, or Happy. Then the Avengers happened and he saw Bruce get one, then Natasha, then Clint, then Thor (which the God of Thunder took as an invitation to just sweep Dad up into a kiss everytime he felt like it) and finally Cap (because he was still Cap back then and not Pops).
Stane flicks a look in his direction but isn’t given the opportunity to answer as Toni says, “We knew the stocks dipped forty points, we knew that was gonna happen.”
"Okay, this is where I don't want to be. Eugh, oh, god. Not the car, not the car!
They share a quick hug and exchange cheek kisses. Steve can see the shift in Toni’s smile, the curve of her lips relaxing just a tiny bit but it’s enough for Steve to see the genuineness.
The thrusters slowly power down and Toni returns to the ground. If she nearly landed on her ass at the last second, well, no one had to know and she could just have JARVIS edit the footage.
they’re missing...and where they went.
Toni smiles, shaking hands with a couple of the guys in front before saying, "Speaking about manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about when he guessed wrong in spring break. Just remember that, spring break-" out of the corner of her eye he could see Rhodey shaking his head with a rueful smile, "-nineteen eighty-seven. That lovely lady you woke up to-"
There were bruises scattered across her face and bare arms, her lips were chapped with dried blood, but the worse of it was on her shoulders where the sun had burned blisters into her skin.
Peggy had called it saving his ass.
If it wasn’t for the serum, he wouldn’t have heard her. Wouldn’t have heard the vulnerable tremor in her voice, and wouldn’t have turned around to see her standing on top of the steps leading up to the doors, her wild curls drifting in cool night’s air as it drifted around them. She was dressed in nothing but an oversized MIT shirt that hung just above her knees, her feet was bare, and her lithe arms were wrapped around her shivering body. If that already didn’t make a pitiful picture, her eyes would’ve taken the cake. They were wide, scared and hurt and Steve found the fight leaving him in an instant.
He steps forward, hand out to reach (Toni, her shoulders, anything to assure him that she’s breathing– alive–), stops and swallows the sudden knot in his throat. “What did they do to you?” the horror was clear in his voice and he couldn’t look away.
Next chapter’s gonna be big.
They torture her.
As soon as they step out, Hawk says, “We’ll that was interesting.”
Steve chuckles in response, looking away from the bowl of beef stew he’d been preparing and over his shoulder to see Toni enter the kitchen with a big smile. He returns to the task at hand, asking, “Something good happen?”
He had waved her gratitude away because Steve’s just as bad as receiving thanks as she is. “If you’re really thankful, eat. And if you want anything g cooked, lemme know. I’ll see if I can do it, or order it as takeout.”
“Of course, sweetheart.”
Steve tips his head to the side, not exactly conceding, but not disagreeing either. He can’t make up his mind about this right now, not yet. Howard understands, because despite their estrangement, they were friends first, and Steve owes the man his life. So, Steve doesn’t reply, Howard doesn’t stay to watch him go as he speeds out of the garage and into the dawn.
Potts sighs and Toni smiles triumphantly before saying, “You’ll be perfectly fine. It’s just like Operation. Just don’t let it touch the socket wall or it goes beep.”
So she turns to Obie and says softly, “It’s good to see you.”
Then his phone rang again.
“You’d be surprised how much you can learn from animals,” Tony says with a cheeky wink.
There’s already coffee brewing in the pot when he arrived, no doubt JARVIS’ doing with the help of the house bots. Steve quickly gets to work on breakfast as soon as he finished gulping down two bottles of Gatorade. He scrambles some eggs while the bread toasted, slathering one slice with butter and the other with blueberry jam, then when Toni’s tray was ready, he whipped up a salami sandwich to go with his mountain of scrambled eggs and brought them all down to the workshop with a huge mug of coffee and another bottle of Gatorade.
"I'll take it in my office." Howard got to his feet and dropped another kiss to Toni's forehead and says, "Want to come back down to the 'shop later and see if we can make a solar watch from scratch?"
And just like that, Dad was on Sam planting a big one right on the man's mouth.
“Let me know when she wakes up,” Steve says to JARVIS as the workshop door close behind him.
What else could he really say? “Okay, I promise.”
Clint scoffs. "But so does Bucky, but he's not babysitting."
“Why are you crying, sweetheart?”
He looks up to the ceiling and asks, “JARVIS, how long has Toni been up for now?”
Three hours later, she woke up, groggy and with a headache. Steve was a saint because he had coffee brewing and he handed over her favorite large mug full of glorious caffeine with only a little frown of disapproval. So they spent the rest of the afternoon in her kitchen as Toni checked some emails, glared at Rhodey’s contact on her phone, called the hospital to check up on her dad, and touched bases with Pepper over a video call, all the while Steve puttered around, tapping away at a laptop at times or putting something together to snack on that he pushed in Toni’s direction.
Stane says, “Who do you think locked you Starks out? I’m the one who filed an injunction against you...It’s the only way I could protect you.”
He sighs again after rubbing the sleep away from his face and casts his gaze around the moonlit room. At his orders, the curtains had not been drawn shut, so the full moon’s silver glow had full access through the massive windows, spilling across the floor, over the lounge furniture, the dressers, and the four post of the canopy bed.
“Hey!”
Tony hums. “I think I’d rather like this Loki person.”
“Toni,” this time, Steve grips her gently around the arms and she steadily ignores the tingles that run up and down her body at the contact, “tomorrow, please. Your dad’s fine. He’ll be more awake and lucid tomorrow. Come on, let’s get you cleaned up and maybe hunt down something to snack on. Did you even eat lunch?”
A small piece of scrambled eggs comes flying his way and it was only thanks to his reflexes that he manages to catch it in his mouth. He glared at Toni who gives him a shrug.
“Uh-huh,” Toni says drily, settling her hands on her cocked hips. “Sure did.”
“Toni?”
“Right.” Steve nods to Nat and she approached him. “I’ll call when I’m five minutes out.”
He knew what they were thinking and he knew what was being said around base. Toni Stark is dead, they’re just looking for a body now.
Steve could cry, but he doesn’t. “You, too, jerk.”
“Testing the suits limits, I’m afraid, Captain.”
Steve regrets it the moment he steps out of the car and walks around amidst the flashing lights to open the driver's door for Toni.
“And three...two...one.”
Until he hears the familiar not-engine sound from earlier followed by a loud crash that has Steve jackknifing from the floor in time to see the suit fall through the ceiling and land on top of the Shelby Cobra, destroying the vehicle beyond repair.
Toni breathes, realizes she couldn’t take a full breath, stares at the black and white picture of the weapon she built meant to save the lives of American troops, not take them, and thinks back on the soldiers who had already died trying to keep her alive, pictures a world where her weapons were in the wrong hands...
“Everything we have so far. Keep me updated, Nick.”
Hawk sputters and promptly falls back from his log, making Bucky and Sam howl with laughter while Thor encourages Hawk to do it again. Loki only further buries his head in his tome.
“I mean me on the company’s behalf–” She looks to Potts and sees the frown on his face, “–being responsible for the way that– wow, this is great.”
“Toni, you know that’s impossible–”
with His Majesty to leave the capital when moral has been steadily rising since their Highnesses return. It’s like they want the people to be as miserable as they are. Oh, what I would do to get my hands around Lord Stane’s greasy neck and just shake him until something clicks in that empty sphere he calls a head! But as it were, they still refuse to tell us where they had gone into hiding!”
“Her convoy was fucking blown up into pieces, that’s what’s changed!”
“Thank you very much, Lady Potts.” Steve bows again.
Steve stares at his helmet before settling it on the tank, feeling oddly defeated.
When they got hack home earlier in the day, she had left Steve to his devices to take a nap, slathering her healing shoulders with more aloe vera before she flopped onto her unmade bed. God, her conversation with Rhodey and lunch with Aunt Peggy had her mentally exhausted.
“Let’s take a picture,” Stane says instead, arm wrapping around her waist. It feels too much like a snake coiling about its prey but Toni insured it, stone-face as she dutifully faces the camera. Her arm is on auto-pilot as she settles it between Stane’s shoulder blades. “C’mon, picture time.”
I’m so sorry that these chapters are really heavy on Steve’s POV but since so think we get a good sense of what Toni’s POV is from the movies, I feel the need to write a lot of the scenes out through Steve’s eyes and how he would react to the events of IM1. I hope it’s not too boring for you guys!
“Has no one ever taught you manners?” A familiar voice says, cutting Steve’s question off before the young man was yanked back by the pony-tail at his nape. “Not even a minute, and you’re sticking your nose in someone else’s business.”
Bucky carefully eyes the man running towards where Raza, previously thought dead, stood, and handed something over to him.
“Yes, please,” Steve says with a grin and allows himself to be steered around the kitchen as the AI tells him where everything is.
“Not like I planned it, kid.” He pauses, gaze intent on hers. “How’d the board take to you shutting down the weapon’s division?”
Natasha manages to squeeze his shoulder through his armor and it has him relaxing just a fraction. Natasha knows, after all, what it's like to do all those things and still remember them. Bucky still remembers how it felt to grab Toni Stark by the neck and drag her out of the mangled passenger seat, her side catching on the jagged metal and she screams, her vocal cords flexing under his flesh and blood hand. He tries not to think what could have happened had Steve not chased after the Super Soldier serum Howard carried in the trunk and stumbled across the crash when he did. Just a second later, a moment's hesitation before Steve threw the shield at him, and it would've been the end of Toni Stark.
?” She places a sheaf of photographs in Toni’s limp hand.
For the next week, Steve and his men work hard to prepare for the journey, while the castle prepares for those who were accompanying Sir Carbonell’s people. Steve does not once sees Tony amongst them, and when he voiced this to Bucky, his friend had shrugged and pointed out that it’s an unusually large caravan so it will surely be hard to spot someone who’s supposed to be the help for the help.
Toni waves him off, grabbing two bottles of water from the fridge. “Semantics. I don’t need security.”
As if she understood, she snorts.
Howard didn't need to look to know his daughter was pouting.
“Thank you.”
“I’ll hold you to that.”
Hawk groans in agony, dropping his head onto the table with a
“Not witchcraft,” Tony says on a grin, plopping himself in the seat across from Hawk which had been Steve’s until Rhodes arrived. “Just good genes, I’m afraid.”
Steve shrugs. “You really wanna try and change her mind?”
Toni doesn’t whine when her AI answers, she doesn’t, but she scowls.
The kiss he gave her on the forehead was nothing new. It’s a thing he’s done since her eleventh birthday. But this one was no doubt the most heartbreaking one they’ve shared.
“Different cultures and beliefs are now united under our banner so even more must be done to ensure we can all live amongst each other peaceably. So, to start off my plans, I am sending Sir Carbonell to travel to the major cities, get together with the local authorities, and implement the laws that have governed our prosperous Kingdom. Within reason, of course. What do you think?”
Peter was sweaty and tired. But it was a good tired. It was a testament to a well-spent afternoon testing out the new web shooters with Dad in the lab, and taking it out for a test run in the simulation room.
Now, she’s changed. She felt it the moment she stared at her own last name in that desert right before it exploded in her face. She felt it as they shoved her head under water time and time again. And she felt it as Yinsen’s life slipped from his eyes.
Steve reads some emails, composed a few replies, read up on Nat and Clint’s recent missions, assures Rhodey that everything is fine, before Toni’s excited
The man doesn’t even look down but he doesn’t need to. Toni’s heart sinks. “Have you seen these pictures? Huh?”
“Good morning, Captain.”
SHIELD doctors) were looking him over and assessing just how much damage Hydra had done to him and how they could undo it. The prognosis wasn’t very enthusiastic and they suggested that Steve keep his contact with Bucky to a very minimum. At least until he’s recovered enough.
“JARVIS, where’s Toni?!” Steve quickly asks, heart pounding in his ears. He wasn’t so out of it that someone snuck past him, right?
“But my ale!” Rhodes complains even as he stands with no protest when Tony tugs at his arm.
Then he registers what he’s seeing. Toni isn’t falling anymore. Toni didn’t fall to her death. She back up and flying, twisting and looping in the air and headed back home.
Steve remains still as Toni says, “Huh…quite surprised you know that, or anything at all, about me these days.”
Steve immediately feels a stab of guilt and he exhaled harshly, shutting his eyes. “I’m sorry,” he says, “that was unfair of me.”
Sighing, she slumps against him, all traces of the General gone as her head leans against his neck. Once upon a time, this had flustered Steve, turning his face into a poor imitation of a ripe tomato, but all manner of propriety had been thrown out the window on the battlefield. These days, they have to worry about how close they are in each other’s company.
Maybe she can actually start to fix things and do what’s right this time around.
“Right,” he says into the emptiness, voice a rasp, and pushes himself to his feet. “Let’s see what the others are up to.”
“What’s up, Cap?” Nat arches a red brow at him. The tight worry lines that had been around her eyes when they got Bucky onboard had disappeared. She was the Black Widow once more. “That was Stark?”
Toni stops dead in her tracks and frowns. “What?”
They’ll see it later and smile before video calling their children, content in the knowledge that for now, their war is done.
Now Steve’s really confused. Rhodey is the second most protective person of Toni, Steve wouldn’t be surprised if Rhodey pulled all of the best doctors on base just to check on her. There’s something fishy going on and Steve wasn’t about to let it go.
They come to a stop in the living room. Toni does her best to look nonchalant as she meets his suspicious gaze. "C'mon, Steve. Go to a fancy party with me. It'll be just like old times. I could do something that would absolutely scandalize the rags, while you scowl at every poor shmuck who tries to approach you with the intention to use your connection to the Stark name. It'll be fun."
Ana was near tears as she gave Toni an earful about disappearing and Toni was properly chastised, wrapping her bony arms around Ana's neck fiercely when the woman swooped her into a hug, promising to let Ana and Jarvis know the next time she wanted to go somewhere.
The courtyard is bustling with activity with last minute preparations as servants ran back and forth from the castle and between carts and carriages. Steve was stationed in the middle by Sir Carbonell’s carriage, reaching down to pat Valkyrie’s neck every time she snorts when someone comes a little too close to her.
Her breathes came out in harsh, short exhales that she could see in the cold air. A shiver runs through her body as she stares up at a dark ceiling of dirt. There was an orange glow off to her left and a weak flickering of artificial light off to her right. Someone’s whistling, there’s an annoying trickle at the back of her parched throat. Gingerly, she reaches up to her face and chokes when her fingers catch on a tube traveling up one of her nostrils. Suddenly panicked, she pulls on it, gagging and gasping but not stopping until the whole damn thing came out. Who knows what the hell they’ve been feeding her.
Hawk is the first to recover, having scrambled back atop his log. “Crown Prince, Prince Anthony Stark? That Crown Prince? The one who ran off to party, womanize, and drown himself in booze while we fought for our country? That Crown Prince? The one who holed up in the Winter Palace with the slaves he bought when we almost lost? That Crown Prince? The one who hasn’t even shown his face since we returned?
“Good job on keeping your cool,” she tells Steve after a moment. “I really didn’t need you guys to continue the fiasco of the one Christmas we had together.”
“What is this?” Toni doesn’t have to elaborate what she was asking about.
“Squirt.”
She had followed him after he steadied her, her steps hurried as she tried to keep up with Steve’s infuriated march, talking a mile a minute, and though Steve wasn’t listening, he could tell she was trying to get him to calm down. But nothing anyone could’ve said then would’ve calmed him down, so he kept on marching until he bursted through the front double doors and quickly got on his bike.
“What witchcraft!” Hawk cries, pointing an accusing finger at their guest. “I’m a year older and I have almost the same amount of wrinkles as my grandmother!”
"Damn right." Toni nods, mind racing to recalibrate to the new development Obie dropped on her. "So, no matter what the Board says, I'll keep doing what I
“I haven’t checked. Left that all up to Obie, he’ll take care of it.”
“I mean, come on, we’re the King’s Knights.
He steadily ignores the way his heart pounds insistently against his ribs.
The door clanks open and Toni eyes her companion warily as he quietly urges her to raise her arms as he was doing. She follows, apprehension making her stomach twist and turn as a group of heavily armed men spill into the room. Their weapons are frighteningly familiar.
The rest of his Knights were either spread out along the train with Bucky at the very front leading a small group and Sam taking up the rear with his own group.
“Shall I store this in the Stark Industries’ central data base?” JARVIS queries as she moves away from her desk to stand before the table.
Apparently unperturbed by the dramatic display, Tony reaches across the table to give Hawk’s shoulder two pats, short and clinical as he says, “There, there. Let it all out, Master Archer.”
“Well, aren’t you a suspicious one?” Tony squints at Bucky even as his smile stays fixed on his face.
"Fun," Stever repeats dryly, silently letting her know that he's on to her. But he sighs. "You and I have very different definitions of fun. Fine. It's been a while since I've been to one of these parties anyway."
look certainly’s it. So, why is she not telling?
“Good.” Howard nods, relief clear in the action before he reaches for her hand again and says, “Don’t tell anyone else. Any trace that this exists in you? You get rid of it. Okay?”
Toni winces. “Ah, that bad, huh?”
“Yes.”
Peace!
“You’ve really gotten better at cooking,” Toni says after a while of silence. She’s nearly finished with her bowl. “You used to be such a disaster in the kitchen.”
“You summoned me, ma’am?”
Her dad had been taken to a hospital where he remains stabilized but unconscious. Toni snuck in during the early hours of the morning, bribing the front desk and spent a good two hours just staring at her father as she held his hand. She hadn’t been able to follow him right away to the hospital due to all the reporters and had instead hidden away in the reactor room, staring up at the behemoth that now say in the middle of her chest.
“Would’ve went better if you were there.”
Steve blinks down at the floor, wondering how he ended up on all fours through the ringing in his ears. Then he idly realizes he’s heaving in shallow breaths.
“You gave me specific orders not to let you sleep in this morning. I will now initiate Super Soldier Wake-Up Call protocols.”
“…Certainly, sir.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve looks up to find Rumlow holding a smaller box with a scowl on his face. He stops before Steve so he can check the label plastered across on its lid.
Lady Potts laughs quietly behind a dainty hand. “Sir Carbonell and I simply wanted to see how the preparations are going. And, Sir Carbonell would like to extend his gratitude.”
God, it’s been a long two decades.
"Okay," Toni shrugs.
"It's supposed to light up the numbers and clock hands," she explained, already reassembling the watch. The small screw drivers were just the right fit for Toni's hands.
Instead, he pretended not to notice how Toni would always stick to him like a magnet whenever he was around and kept on pretending that he wasn’t enabling her crush by caving every time she turned her doe eyes on him.
With a wave to the closest camera, Steve leaves the mansion and heads down to the beach. He runs for the next three hours, putting the serum through the hoops as the rising sun beat down on his back, then on his front when he retraced his steps towards Toni’s home.
Silence reigns in the hallway once more with Stane watching Toni with a half-smile that wasn’t far from being incredulous.
They see Peggy off at the front where a SHIELD car was already waiting. She hugs them both and dots their cheeks with a kiss, leaving behind a faded red imprint from her lipstick. When the nondescript car pulls away, Toni says, “She’s up to something.”
Steve grins. “Never.”
From the rear, Sam blows a horn. From the front, Bucky raises the Iron Reign flag. From the middle, Steve takes a deep breath.
Peter smiled while Pops brooded even more.
Her lips are still chapped and Toni wets them with her tongue before rolling the bottom lip into her mouth, her gaze flittering back down to her lap. She nods. “I know. But...maybe not now?”
Pepper was obviously taken back by her sudden show of affection, but it took him only half a second to react, his own arms wrapping around her body fiercely. Though he’s still very gentle with his touch. Pepper’s awesome.
“Captain,” Stane nods. “How is he?”
kiss with much fanfare during movie night. There was idle chatter between everyone as they reached a lull in the movie they were watching (Peter couldn't remember what it was because he was sitting under Dad's arm and Dad was cuddled back into Pops and hope was blooming in his chest), when Sam voiced that he's never, since becoming an Avenger, received a Stark kiss.
“I’m on it, Captain.”
"Sure," Bucky says, aware that he doesn't sound convinced at all.
“I do still call you Stevie,” Bucky points at him. “I refuse to call you Captain unless we’re in front of His Majesty.”
“Last night,” Edwin says, a worried frown twisting at his weathered face. “I asked if he wanted me to let Miss Toni know, but he refused. Asked for his phone and tablet instead. He’s been working non-stop.”
Steve gently kicks at Bucky’s leg under the table, a silent command to lay off on the suspicion, at least for now. Bucky gives a small nod and Steve could see the way his shoulders slowly relax. It still frightens Steve the way Bucky could so easily slip into the role of a soldier, but he can’t expect Bucky to stay the same after ten years of war. Hell, Steve himself has changed a lot, so he’s just thankful they made it out alive when so many didn’t.
Rhodes pats his head, flattening the curls there. “You’ve stopped growing a while ago, Tony. Isn’t it about time you accept the fact?”
“Don’t freak out, please. I had limited options on how to keep shrapnel away from my heart and this was the best solution I could come up with.” Toni hopes the explanation could somehow soften the blow of seeing the reactor. She unbuttons her blouse and slowly reveals the device to her father. “It works and hasn’t blown up on me yet.”
In the dim light of the tavern, Steve can just barely make out the red making Tony’s cheeks glow, but it’s unmistakable. It could also just be the ale, though if Steve were to go by the way Tony had suddenly gone fidgety and refused to look at anyone but Rhodes, he highly doubts it.
Gently, Peggy nudges Toni’s chin up to meet her eyes and the younger woman complied reluctantly. Peggy says, “It’s not your fault, Toni. Your dad and I? We’re old, love, these things happen to us, okay? He’ll get better and when he does, I’ll help you convince him that closing down the weapon’s division was a good move, yeah?”
“There’s still approximately two hours, thirteen minutes and six seconds left, Miss,” her AI interjects. “Might I suggest taking that nap now?”
He would’ve been the biggest fool in the world if he never noticed Toni’s crush on him, especially since Peggy and Howard loved to tease him about it. It was supposed to go away, which was why Steve never let it bother him. She was twelve for chrissake! She was supposed to go on to find other boys her age to have a crush on, then turn fourteen and realize boys are disgusting, then turn eighteen and find herself a decent boyfriend that Steve would watch like a hawk, before finally getting married at twenty-one and rule the world.
“I just don’t want this winding up in the wrong hands...” she spins the stripped blue print. “Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.”
He quickly got dressed and definitely broke several speeding laws on the ride over to the Malibu hospital Howard’s been checked in to. He finds a free spot in the visitor’s parking lot and jogs his way over to the lobby. Edwin Jarvis is waiting for him there.
“I’m learning to fly, Steve,” she replies, seeing no sense in lying about this specific situation. “Turns out, the arc reactor has a bit more
Phil’s smile is amiable enough. “You know I’m the life of the party, Miss Stark.”
Toni tried to say something, but her mouth doesn’t cooperate as she drifts off.
“I’ll leave you two slices,” Toni says, stepping into the elevator with Steve.
“...Looks like some kind of mask,” Natasha finally says. “Cap and Rhodey picked Stark Jr. up not too far from this location...how much do you wanna bet that whatever they’re digging up has to do with Toni?”
They don't say anything else after that so Steve fiddles around with the radio for a bit until he finds the sports station. By the time they arrive at the restaurant Peggy chose for them, the team Steve had decided to root for was ahead of their opponent by a mile. He gets out first, then walks around to open the driver's door for Toni, taking in the Italian bistro. It seemed so at odds with the hustle and bustle of Malibu but it also worked. Toni takes his proffered hand as she slides out from behind the wheel, thanking him quietly, before passing off the car keys to a waiting valet. Bistro the place may be, it was still Malibu, so of course, there'd be a valet. The hostess behind the podium recognized them right away, or at least, Toni, as she quickly comes forward to greet them and offered to lead them to their "usual table."
“Lady Potts. Sir Carbonell.” Steve bows. “What brings you here on this hot day?”
The whistling continues.
Bucky nods. “I know you do. Take care...punk.”
“Ah, forgive me, Captain,” Tony sighs after a moment as his laughter dies down, wiping at the corners of his eyes. “I have had the immense pleasure to meet the General a couple of times. But please, your answer–
“We don’t know.”
It was logical, Toni thinks later as she stares into the fire back in her “cell” while her fellow prisoner taunts her with words of encouragement as she tries to breath, and wraps the scratchy blanket tighter around her shoulders.
“But–”
Dad looks out through his safety glasses at the range and to where the dummy stood innocently a good ways away from them. "Hm? Familiar?"
“How do we remove it?” he asks a few seconds of silence later. His voice is rough with emotion and he clears his throat.
“Come in.”
She retraced her steps and went up to Steve who looked only a little bewildered that the small Stark was choosing to talk to him. He recovered quickly, bending down so they could see eye-to-eye as she asked him if he’s like to swim with her.
She was just about to head up to her room when JARVIS says, “Miss, Captain Rogers as at the door.”
Steve felt in his bones. “The world is just not fair!”
“But you didn’t prove me wrong, did you? I wasn’t the one who tried to revive the super soldier program! I wasn’t the one who kept selling weapons without looking where they went!”
"It's Mister Stane, Sir," Jarvis announced, holding the phone out to him.
She trails off because Rhodey's shaking his head, a disbelieving smile twisting his face. "What," he asks, "you humanitarian now, or something?"
“Oh, this makes things so much easier then,” Lady Potts says turning to Sir Carbonell. “But Peter will still be joining you.”
Steve gives her a small smile, not feeling like he could do more than that. “Thanks, Nat.”
Toni beams up at him. "Yes, please!"
Steve feels like an outsider as he watches Potts panic even more, and Toni calmly guiding her assistant with what to do next-
In the Stark-Rogers’ lake house living room, the glass top coffee table comes to life with blue lights before the picture is projected upwards to float just above the surface and rotate slowly.
Potts gapes at Toni. “Are- Is this safe?”
He can feel Peggy’s eyes boring into the side of his face.
“Just tinkering with an idea,” Toni says, and out of his peripheral he watched her twirl her fork in the air. There’s bags under her eyes, but there’s a spark in her gaze, a clearness that’s never present when she’s just tinkering. If the lack of music wasn’t already proof that this—whatever it is—is something big, then
He only needs to shift his head a little and he could press his lips against her forehead, but Steve stops himself. He can no longer do that. They can no longer do any of that. So, he nudged the crown of her head with his chin instead. “It is yours. What ails our great General so much these days?”
“Alas, shield brother, you ask of me the impossible,” Thor replies, the usual beginning to his usual speech whenever Bucky or Hawk brings the subject up.
“I saw you once, you know,” the man continues, “at Bern. You were giving a speech about integrated circuits–”
"Can't I try roughing it, Pete?" Uncle Rhodey's words were followed by a long rip as he tore the front page off.
Rumlow grumbles and trudges on.
It was a breeze tiptoeing out of the house and into the stables now that Steve had done it so many times over (i.e. since he got back), and because he kept Valkyrie as his steed even after the war, it was even faster getting her all saddled up and ready for another ride into the night.
Steve drops to a knee before his King and Queen. Behind him, the rest of the knights follow suit.
“Yes,” Peggy nods. “I’m going to see Toni later for lunch so I want you to keep an eye on something.”
“Sounds like Howard,” the old man laughs.
“Shit,” Toni mutters under her breath.
So he swung his leg off his bike, closed the short distance between them and shucked off his jacket to wrap it around her trembling shoulders. He never intended to hurt Toni, the thought never even crossed his mind. But he needed to leave.
"-'Cuz that little stunt, at the press conference? That was a doozy."
Thank you,
Bucky doesn’t deny it and instead takes a sip of his drink.
"Just stand down. Something happens, then come in," Toni adds as she steps back in place and addresses the room at large, "And again, let's bring it up to two-point-five! Three, two, one."
He thought he heard Dad chuckle.
Instead of questioning it though, he points towards the couch with his chin and says, “Breakfast, eat.”
Prince can bring down his mood.
Steve gives a sympathetic nod. “I understand. Is Toni awake yet?”
Bucky continues to wave his stick. “Oh, I noticed, just thought maybe normalcy will get those tiny cogs in your brain turning.”
As an adult in her late thirties with a best friend who’s been in the military for the whole of his adult life, Toni understands that it was trauma. The memory of crashing the plane into the ice and ultimately freezing...it was too fresh in his mind.
Steve concedes to Bucky’s point and doesn’t think about it until the day of their departure.
Steve isn’t sure how he feels about that. But he nods because it’s Peggy whose calling the shots. “Alright.”
Toni yawns again and only allowed Steve to lead her under the covers of her bed because she’s too lazy to tell him off. “Damn right,” she says as he pulls the blanket up to her chin. Her eyes begin to droop. “And don’t you forget it.”
"I understand, but I need you to trust me, Pep. This is–" Toni shakes her head, looking out past the pool and at the darkening skies. "This is wildly different from anything I've ever done before and I need you, I
Sir Carbonell shuffles a bit more on his feet before clumsily bowing.
“‘Cause I was referring to your company’s involvement with this latest atrocity.”
misses you."
Dumbfounded, but not that much, Peter copied the gesture then nodded wildly before rushing to his room as quietly as possible.
“That is a huge understatement,” Rhodes cuts in. “Should’ve seen him. He was down on all fours, nearly prostrate–”
Steve clenches his free hand and very carefully keeps his hold on the phone firm. “Where then?”
Toni ducks out from under Stane’s arm and briskly walks past Potts in the direction of the elevator. Steve quickly follows.
Toni huffs, amused. “Yeah, I don’t think I’ll be going anywhere too far from Rhodey’s sight. Or dad’s. Or SHIELD.”
“Coming up on the LZ,” Clint’s voice crackles over the comms.
Pops' slightly possessive behavior was no trade secret among the Avengers, especially not to Dad.
At that point, Steve was ready to snap. It was hard keeping his cool, and he could tell Rhodey was in the same boat as him. Howard wasn’t faring better. He looked more and more like he was on death’s door step with each video call Steve made to report another day of dead ends.
“What–” Steve abandons that train of thought and runs toward the driveway. The door remained open so Steve hurried down. “Toni?! What was that?! Toni?!”
Toni doesn’t like being handed things, but she closes her fingers around the glossy papers, trying to comprehend the conviction in Christine’s gaze. Then Toni looks down and everything narrows down to the first picture.
Then he’s gone, leaving Toni there on the steps under the scrutiny of the media, stiff and unseeing.
Wide, doe eyes that reminded him so much of Maria locked onto him before there was an excited squeal. "Daddy! You're back!"
Howard flips the disk over then asked, "How were you planning on powering it?"
“What the hell did you do to me?” she rasps minutes later, sitting up in her cot in a cold cave after she examined the damage done with the mirror the man handed her.
Toni turns her eyes out the window, smiling. "I'll let you know when to turn."
“Oh hey, Steve!” Toni gives him a little wave and only then did Steve notice that she was holding what appeared to be another arc reactor.
“Don’t start the party without me!” Hef gives a small wave.
Guys...I learned a whole new set of codes for this chapter...please...please validate my efforts with many praises xD
Clint’s confused hum comes through. “The hell is that?”
Toni gives into the urge to hug him because there was a time in that cave she left behind that she thought she’d never get to see her scarily competent PA ever again. He’s way too qualified to be Toni’s glorified babysitter, and if she was a decent human being, she’d have found a way to give Pepper a job he deserves. But she’s never claimed to be decent. So she kept him by her side because she’s selfish and knows that starting any type of relationship with Pepper outside of their professional one (and their surprising friendship) could only end in disaster.
“Oh, well, thank you.” The doors start to close. “You gonna show me what you’ve been working on while you’ve been keeping low?”
Potts opens his mouth to reply when another tablet that was propped on the coffee table chirps and a picture of Toni looking all professional pops up on the screen. Potts quickly swipes at its screen and Toni’s voice filters through, “Pepper, how small are your hands? Never mind, that was a stupid question. I need you down here.”
Steve returns the gesture.
the best insult
Toni laughs. “Definitely come a long way, huh?”
Steve opens his mouth to call her out, because that’s bullshit, but then Potts spoke first, “Will that be all, Miss Stark?”
“Steve.”
“I think it’s a great first step, Your Majesty. I look forward to the fruits of Sir Carbonell’s endeavor.”
It's been a week since the Avengers banded back together under the ammended Accords, and Peter still doesn't know how to feel about Pop (it has been two years), but in the moment, he was sympathetic.
However, this was the first team barbecue since the Avengers banded back together, and Dad...well, Dad's still riding the petty train and Pops is in full-on brood mood. He's growing out the beard again.
“This was a Board of Director’s meeting.”
I actually planned on having Steve be there to hear the news of Obi’s double-dealing, but I realized, this moment, where Toni’s world is falling apart and she’s realizing just how big this whole thing actually is, she
“At ease, Captain,” the King chuckles. “Ever so eager to work. I imagine resting has not been rejuvenating?”
Steve tries not to glare too hard at the not-young man and grumpily makes his way around to the open seat next to Hawk.
He frowns. “What?”
"Want to fiddle around with some upgrades for Karen next, kiddo?" Dad asked as they step out of the elevater and unto the common floor. He had stripped out of his track suit's jacket and had tied it around his waist, leaving him in a black tank and the nanite housing.
“What is going on in Gulmira?”
"I thought you're laying low?" he asks, easily catching up to her.
Howard’s eyes widen so Toni pushes on, “I was thinking this could be where we go next. Go green like no other company in the world can even dream of. I know we can do it, especially now with more manpower to focus in the energy department. My estimate is in two years we can fully supply green energy to a tower as tall as the Empire State Building, but right now I can’t be sure because you’re not saying anything and I really need you to say something, pops.”
“Captain,” Potts says as soon as the other man notices him.
Steve paused, memories of watching over Toni’s slender shoulder as she typed and drowned in coffee coming into the forefront of his mind before he shut them down and says, “Right. And the search party?”
Sir Carbonell visibly perks up, and though Steve can’t see his eyes through his thick spectacles , or his mouth through the thick white beard that framed the lower half of his face, Steve thinks that Sir Carbonell is as delighted as him.
The man follows her gaze then smiles again and says as he goes back to his cooking, “That’s right. Smile.”
The laughter stops.
“Much appreciated, Captain. Have a good run.”
in my presence. Understood?”
“Oh, get off your high horse for a minute Rogers, and listen.” Howard’s words were as sharp as ever, but there was a tremor in them that stopped Steve from tearing the man a new one. A sound that he’s only ever heard when Howard talked about the dearly departed Maria. “Someone took Toni.”
Steve rubs at his eyes. “It’s the King’s orders, so I certainly think we can. And, you heard Lady Potts. The nobles know this is not the proper way to do things, but these are unprecedented times, and we must do what is needed to keep order across the nations. If that means escorting a lawyer across each capital then I will fulfill my duty as per His Majesty’s order.”
She caught sight of the blonde out of the corner of her eyes after putting in Pepper’s order and tacking her own at the end. Out of all the people she could’ve bumped into at this venue, it has to be the last woman she fooled around with before her stint in Afghanistan.
“Are you sure you’re my bodyguard and not my live-in caretaker?”
King Howard smiles widely. “You shall accompany Sir Carbonell in his travels, Captain. You and the King’s Knights.”
They flew low, because even though life signs would show up on their computers, Steve and Rhodey wanted to see a visual with their own eyes. And what a visual sight Toni Stark made.
“Remove it?” Toni’s brows twitched up as a laugh, broken and dark, leaves her lips. A travesty of her actual laugh. Steve hates it. She reaches up to tug at the hospital gown’s neck and her eyes are wild when she stares at him, then through him. “There’s no removing this, Steve. The moment you take this out, I die! Sure, maybe not immediately, but definitely before the doctor’s can get to the shrapnel. It’ll be a slow, torturous death, and I’ve had enough torture for the past three months so I think I’ll pass on
She waves at him, digging into her suit jacket for the other burger she stuffed in there. “Hey, would it be alright if everybody...sat down? Why don’t you just sit down?” Toni then waves at the obviously confused reporters and nods when they slowly comply. “That way you can see me and...” she opens the burger, “little less formal and...” she takes a bite, staring at a spot on the linoleum floor before leaning back against the podium. God, she’s tired.
Chastised, the bot slumps once again.
A minute later, the elevator dings to announce Stane’s arrival before the sound of expensive shoes on linoleum floors fill the silence. Steve looks up at the appropriate time to find the man coming forward with his media smile. Steve braces himself.
"What is it?" Howard carefully takes the disk and squints as he held it under the desk lamp Toni had on.
Once they were all situated in a triangle around the table, a server comes up and sets the glasses of water Steve ordered on the table, one for Toni and the other for him, followed by an assorted fruit bowl, three small plates, and three small forks. They thank him and the man gives a small bow before saying he will bring them the menus.
– he’s here.”
The next thing Howard knew, short arms were clinging around his neck in an almost suffocating hug. "Thank you, daddy!"
He couldn't see Wanda's face but he saw her wipe at her cheeks before Dad smiled and leaned in to give her forehead a kiss.
It was pure desperation that put Steve on the helicopter that day while Rhodey hopped into another one. They had three birds in total, and Steve resisted the urge to tear into his crew when he saw the doubts on their faces.
Hours, minutes, seconds go by, before the jet’s ramp lowers right at the gate of the Stark’s Manhattan mansion. “Tell Fury I want a full report on the situation ASAP,” Steve tells Natasha as she walks with him. Bucky stands as they come near him, and Steve stops. He sighs and hopes his smile was at least a little bit encouraging. “I’m sorry, Buck. But I really need to do this.”
Steve checks it off his list as another set of his men carries the crate past him to be loaded onto one of the cargo carts.
"Long enough to know you plan on flying in that thing again," Steve says with a shrug. There's still a bit of strain around his eyes but for the most part, he's relaxed, slouched back against the couch instead of curled over his knees. "Why would I need a suit?"
"I don't know, sweetheart, should he?" Dad asked with a saccharine smile as he retrieved a popsicle from the freezer.
“Toni, Toni,” Obi repeats, no longer meeting her gaze. “You can’t afford to be this naive.”
December 16, 1991.
He can train later.
So, now that the King had called them back, Steve was more than ready to go. Of course, he was expecting this, after Peggy told them last night that Prince Anthony was returning. But not even the reminder that Steve would most likely finally be meeting the
As soon as Sir Carbonell stops, Lady Potts says, “Allow me to translate, Captain.”
“About as bad as you can expect,” the older man sighs, just as the sounds of heels in marble reaches Steve’s ears.
Toni's little head snapped up so quickly, Howard felt a phantom twinge in his neck. Big brown eyes sparkled with hope. "Really?"
Steve looks up from wiping down his sword to his best friend and right hand sitting across the fire from him, amusement making his lips twitch. Lieutenant James Buchanan Barnes, however, was looking at where Hawk was sprawled across a log, his usual ruggedly handsome face twisted into something between disbelief and disappointment.
Steve tunes him out in favor of focusing back on his sword, a smile on his face. In the reflection of the blade, he meets a pair of laughing brown eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Christine,” Christines corrects and Toni’s Brian goes,
Over the last three months of Toni’s disappearance, Steve had gotten to know JARVIS over Stark Pads that Pepper Potts made sure they always had as they searched the desert for the inventor. For a moment, his worry for Toni was overshadowed by his pride for her. He was there when she was still theorizing about AIs, filling the notebook he brought back from Paris as a souvenir for her with lines of code, formulas, and other notes that Steve knew many would love to get their hands on.
Steve’s armor clanks with each step he took down the castle’s main hallway.
When there’s not an immediate response, Steve looks away from the shelf of ridiculously expensive booze to Phil’s contemplative face. He’s known the man since he joined SHIELD but Steve’s never been able to fully read Phil. “That bad?” he ventures, apprehensive of the answer.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t fish for compliments, Captain,” she says with a haughty sniff, chin lifted in faux derision. “It’s very unbecoming of a Knight. And his King’s Knight, no less.”
Had Steve known what the road ahead held for him...well, he wouldn’t change anything, but he would’ve definitely guarded his heart a little more.
“You don’t want to keep it?” Steve frowns and hands over the device to Potts when he held out his hand.
Tony leans to the side to see around Steve’s torso and says, “Nope, I’m just always annoyingly charming.”
Steve hops down from Valkyrie’s saddle to pull the carriage door open.
A muscle ticks in Clint’s jaw but he nods.
“Why are you so adamant about his presence?” Sir Carbonell signs sharply.
Peggy Carter is a busy woman.
“Is this what you call
Anyways, I’m back, and I’m also sorry for taking more than a month to update!!! Hopefully, I won’t take as long with the next chapter. I have big plans for that one.
“Good, good.” King Howard nods, shares a look with his wife, the says, “I’m glad you think so, Captain. Very glad, because you’ll not only be able to see the results of Sir Carbonell’s mission, you’ll be able to see it happen first hand.”
"What happened to using lighter fluid?" Peter asked tentatively as he handed over a comic.
“You have something to say, General Carter?” Steve asks, quietly so as to not overlap with Thor. Though he doubts he could ever compete with the other man’s booming voice, but still. He was raised with some manners.
“I’m sure, dad,” she assured him softly, breathing in his familiar and comforting smell and pretending she doesn’t feel the wetness against her neck. She smiles. “I’m home.”
"Of course," Pepper chuckles, giving her hands a squeeze before pulling back. "Now, I need your signatures for these documents."
"Peter, grab me some of those scrap paper down there so I can start this fire." Uncle Rhodey points with a pair of tongs to a stack of old, but not collectable, Captain America comic books that appeared to have been haphazardly dropped unto the ground next to the grill.
“Sure,” Tony easily agrees, “but words travel even faster through a Rhodey.”
“Indeed, but it was still–”
Steve sighs and Bucky waves at a passing tavern worker with his empty tankard.
"You hear about it all the time, it builds up a reputation, you know," the Falcon pointed out with a smirk.
Her smile turns coy. “Maybe. Gotta do one more test-run before she’s ready for an audience.”
But then Toni’s squeezing his hand one more time before releasing her hold and starts to pull the wires off of her chest. “Anyway.”
Peter gave Pops an awkward smile and wave before ducking out of the shooting range.
Steve tamps down on the urge to rail on the man; to say,
“It’s the truth and nothing but the truth, dear Capitan. I have been told many times before I look not like my age suggests I should look.”
“What’s the world coming to when a gal’s gotta crash her own party?”
"Young Miss Stark?!"
Which is why she smiles and tells Obie there’s none left for him as she takes out the last one and allows her uncle to shuffle her past flashing cameras and cheering SI employees.
"So, we're really not telling Steve?"
“Toni, the Board has rights, too.” Stane gives her a pointed look. “They’re making a case that you and your new direction isn’t in the company’s best interest.”
His phone chirps with a notification.
“Indeed she does, Captain. If you could give me the recipe I shall check for the ingredients.”
“I didn’t expect it to be so...so,
“Worried, definitely worried.” Peggy sighs on her end and Steve can see her rubbing at her temples in his mind. “I managed to get a group together to search the site of where Toni was held so I expect some news from them anytime now. I’ll send their report to you as soon as it arrives.”
The inside of the venue is buzzing with just as much activity as it is outside, though it’s more muted. But Steve watches out of the corner of his eye as heads swivel and follow them cut through the crowd and straight for the bar that Toni’s subtly tugging Steve towards.
A tankard of ale is slammed down in front of Tony who jumps. Rhodes looms over his shoulder with an unimpressed look, nursing his own tankard. “Drink up. You said you still have things you want to do.”
“The hell are you doing here?”
“This isn’t a game, Toni,” Potts protests even as he reaches into said socket, long fingers disappearing into the opening quickly followed by the sound of thick liquid moving about. Potts almost gags. “Oh god, there’s puss.”
The panic returns tenfold as Toni claws at the gauze, ripping it apart until she was staring at the mangled mess that had become of her chest and a crude, silver device that sat right in the middle of it all.
“Children?” Tony’s smile is entirely too pleased to be innocent.
Crown Prince?!”
It was empty save for him now that Edwin had gone back to New York to prepare for Howard’s homecoming. If everything goes to plan, they’d have Howard out by evening and have him on a plane bound for the East Coast.
There are only a handful of things that can make Steve Rogers speechless, and he can count them all on one hand with fingers left to spare. A glowing blue orb in the middle of Toni’s chest is something he can add to that count, it would seem. She’s sitting on the bed, eyes gaunt, cheeks ruddy from sunburn, legs, all scratched and bruised, dangling on the side and dressed in a backwards hospital gown that affectively left her sternum exposed; a very scarred and infected sternum. Maybe under normal circumstances Steve would’ve been embarrassed to see the edges of Toni’s breast, but he was so fixed on the mangled mess of her chest that he couldn’t really find a rats ass to give.
“Are you sure you don’t need that, honey?” Howard rasps, and Toni smiles as she steps forward into his open arms, careful with her hold. He looked older and way more frailer than the last time she saw him. God, it must’ve been hell on him, the past couple of months.
“JARVIS, has Toni gone to bed?” he asks, frowning just a bit.
Toni taps at the reactor, hard enough that Howard could hear the very non-fleshy sound. “This.”
“What?” Toni blinks, thrown by the seemingly unrelated question.
“Rise up, my Knights,” King Howard says, waving his hand.
Stane clears his throat with an uncomfortable grimace. “The Board,” he continues softly, “is claiming a Post-Traumatic Stress, they’re filing an injunction.”
The thrusters engage and Toni finds herself a good foot in the air. Toni barely stops herself from exclaiming in triumph, focusing instead of balancing herself as best as she could with the hand repulsors. She looks to U's camera, then around the 'shop, not quite shaking the surrealness of the moment as her heart pounds loudly in her ears. Finally, after a few more seconds, she cuts the powers and lands on her feet with a metallic thunk, nearly losing her balance.
"Okay, we're good." Toni quickly sets her arms back to her sides and...stabilizes, hovering near-perfectly with minimal struggle even as she does another turnaround.
Howard’s calling him.
“I was out of town for a couple of months, in case you didn’t hear.”
“I don’t want to be there when you meet,” Rhodes says.
“What’s going on?” Steve asks.
On the tablet, he watches a news reel of Howard Stark being wheeled in a stretcher from the SI building and into an ambulance. Toni was nowhere to be seen, though Rhodes and Edwin was among the crowd, helping the security guards clear a path for the medical team.
“You’ve read the latest reports?”
Howard Stark hobbled forward to meet her as Rhodey and Steve assists her off the ramp, where she immediately pulls a face at the stretcher being wheeled her way. Steve was quick to catch on and politely waves it away.
“Fifty-six and a half, actually.”
Steve snags another towel up to dry his hair with and speeds out of the room to grab said phone. He only questions why Howard is calling him (and the fact that he’s awake apparently) for a split-second before he’s answering, “Howard?”
Cheers and wolf-whistles went around from everyone but Pops. At this point, Peter wasn't surprised.
Steve smiles and makes his way back into the kitchen, rattling off what he thinks he’ll need. “It’s a simple enough dish that I’d be surprised if you’re missing something.”
He showers quickly and efficiently, despite the luxury of the bathroom telling him to relax and slow down. It’s an unfortunate habit from his Army days that Steve has yet make an effort to kick. Just as he steps out of the steaming shower stall and wraps a towel around his hips, JARVIS speaks up, “Captain, Master Stark’s is calling your phone.”
Toni laughed. “Okay, Steve.”
She’s vaguely aware that Obie has nudged her away from the podium, but she didn’t fight it. She walked right on through the crowd and towards the door that lead towards the fire exit, Obie’s voice following after her as he tried to placate the press.
“Captain,” Rhodes says and Steve appropriately shifts his gaze over just as the other man places a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Rhodes meets his eyes gravely. “I know he looks shifty, talks too much, and definitely doesn’t inspire anyone to trust him–”
They were in the middle of figuring out how to fit a solar panel in the watch without risking its aesthetic when Howard brings it up to her.
When Toni doesn’t immediately squawk indignantly, Steve looks up from where he’s tearing a slice of garlic bread in half to see the woman watching him with furrowed brows and a look in her eyes that Steve had seen many times before on TV.
“Please excuse me, Lady Potts.”
Steve can live with that. “Alright. I’ll see if I can get her to take a break, too.”
Peggy sighs again, sitting up straight once more before she shakes her head, “You know very well I can’t answer that, Barton. Our not-spymaster doesn’t believe in keeping in touch whenever she does these sorts of things. So whether the King had ordered her to find out where our missing Lords and Chancellors had holed away themselves, or something else entirely, I cannot say.”
“Afghanistan.”
It’s a solid inquiry. Toni needs to stand up. “Uh, I- I had my eyes opened!” She walks around to finally stand behind the podium. “I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just...making things blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacture division–” all hell breaks loose as the reporters stand up in unison and Obie comes around to try and do some damage control, but Toni keeps going, “–of Stark International, until such a time that I can decide what the future of this company will be, what direction it should take, one that I’m comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country as well.”
Pepper sniffs, his own mouth quirking in a shadow of a smile. “Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.”
The sand shifts under his feet as he digs, seamlessly blending in with the others around him. In his ear, Natasha’s voice is clear. “We have some activity.”
“Tell me you got something,” Steve pleads.
“So, the fuck am I supposed to do now?” he asks himself silently.
Steve tilts his head, confused. “Your Majesty?”
The sun is hot on Bucky’s back, and underneath all the layers of clothes he had “borrowed” from the unfortunate goon of the Ten Rings, he’s sweating profusely.
“Miss Stark is right, Captain. She’s does not have a concussion.”
Potts grimaced. “Not any more than what we’re already dealing with, thank god. It was getting too much really, so I decided I’d get more work done here.”
“Captain,” James Rupert Rhodes offers Steve a kind smile. “It’s good to see you again.”
Then the explosion happened. It was big and pinged clearly on radar. Rhodey was on radio in an instant and Steve agreed to check it out before the words were even out of the other man’s mouth.
“And because it’s Loki, something will definitely go wrong,” Hawk adds.
Steve squares his shoulders, meeting Toni’s gaze in the distorted metal surface of the elevator. “It was tempting, but I figured you could use more adult influence in your life, so...”
But then she straightens up, tugging at her white coat. “She insisted she was fine and needed only the assistance of Colonel Rhodes.”
“Well, maybe that should change,” Howard replies, shifting so his walking stick was perched in front of him, perfectly in the middle as he gripped it with both hands. If it weren’t for the obvious air of despair around the other man, Steve would’ve thought he was staring at the Howard Stark the media loved to praise and hate in equal measures.
"Sorry for snapping earlier," she says, taking the free seat across from her PA.
This time, she lifts over four feet into the air and before Toni could stop it, she begins to swing around the open space in a small circle that turns her back to U before she starts going backward. Toni grits her teeth and forces herself to not panic too much as she hovers across the floor, swiveling her head around to keep track of her surroundings. But then she starts heading for the cars.
It wasn’t until Steve chose a random key from the motorcycle options hanging on the wall that Howard finally spoke. “After you get Toni back,” he says, “let’s talk.”
I really shouldn’t be writing another fanfic...but it’s 2:53 AM and I don’t make good decisions when I’m sleep deprived soooooo
Steve hums, an affirmative that while he's paying attention to the road, he's listening to her.
Over her, holding a small light, Steve recognizes DUM-E.
“I heard he didn’t even send a messenger ahead of him,” Hawk says behind him, quiet enough that the servant will not hear. “Just–
Steve makes quick eye contact with the other man over Toni’s head as she slots her arm through his again. Something passes across Stane’s face but it’s too quick for Steve to read so Steve nods a silent greeting instead and brushes it off as Stane’s general dislike for Steve. There really is no love lost between them.
Pepper is waiting for her beyond the edge of the plane’s ramp, standing tall beside her father who’s leaning heavily against his walking cane. Behind them, Happy and Jarvis were waiting by their respective cars.
It was honestly pure chance that the Knight Captain and his close circle all found themselves back at their old training grounds, the place having been forgotten during the war. Then it simply became a nightly thing. Sometimes not all of them show up, but there’s never only one person tending the fire. They wordlessly made sure of that.
It wasn’t until two years later that he saw her again.
). It cuts Howard off from whatever else he was saying.
Steve watches as a short man, dressed in scholarly clothes, beard white as snow to match his shoulder-length hair, and glasses so thick he couldn’t even make their eyes, shuffled through the crowd and stands before Steve.
This is how Steve finds her, hours, maybe just minutes later. Toni wasn’t really paying attention as  all her brain power was entirely focused on different ways she can help stabilize herself in the air.
“Where to, boss?” Happy immediately asks.
Toni blinks, freezing in her actions. “Voluntarily?”
He said his good-byes to Peggy and Edwin, and Howard walks him to the garage in silence. Steve suspects that the older man wants to say something, so he keeps quiet, but when they arrive at the vast expanse of the underground Stark garage, Howard still hasn’t said anything.
Heaven only knows what would happen if she didn’t.
DUM-E chirps.
“Care to share with the class?”
"I was gonna put it back together afterwards," Toni reached for a small steel circle the size of the watch's face with odd pieces soldered unto it and held it up to him, "but I can't figure out how to make more space to fit this."
-and makes sure he doesn’t squeeze Toni’s hand too hard, body coiled like a spring and ready to jump into action as the heart monitor beeps faster and faster, then, a sigh of relief as Potts successfully connects the new reactor and Toni goes lax in the chair.
“Thank you, Steve.”
Rhodes smiles over Tony’s head.
It’s his first time back in the castle since the victory celebration. Under King Howard’s orders, the King’s Knights were to rest until he called for them.
“It’s a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?”
With a heavy sigh, Steve reached into the third pouch of his utility belt, and pulls out his SHIELD issued Stark phone, lets it ring one more time before answering.
So, she rarely eats anything fast food. When she does, however, Burger King was her go to. And she never shares.
Steve turns around to set the glass on the bartop, steadily ignoring Phil’s gaze, asking, “How’s everything?”
But Pepper’s in the back sitting down as well, murmuring something back to Rhodey who was just as confused as everybody else, and Obie sitting down next to her, a solid warmth that reminded her of summers spent in the garage with Dad and Uncle Obie...and she can do this, because her family’s here. Dad’s probably in one of the private rooms watching the conference. She needs to do this because of her family. To keep them safe. To keep everyone safe. From her. From the things she’s made with her own two hands. She needs to start washing them of the blood of those innocent soldiers with her in that convoy, and all the others before them who died by her weapons.
The ringing of his personal cellphone was loud in the cabin of the stealth SHIELD jet even through the hum of its engine. It makes Bucky jump.
Lady Potts waves his concern away. “As you were, Captain. Sir Carbonell and I will check on the carts.”
“Boom?” Steve parrots, but Rhodey simply sends him a lazy salute before briskly making his way back up to the castle. Steve shouts after him, “Rhodes! Why would Tony make things go boom?!”
“Captain,” JARVIS says, low enough that it isn’t too much for his ears, but not too low that he can ignore it. This is Steve’s own fault.
Steve blinks then huffs a laugh through his nose. “We’ve never really been good at talking, Stark.”
"You missed the chance to build it here, huh?"
“It’s not really my place to say,” Phil eventually replies, the furrow between his brows not quite disappearing. “Also, your charge has gone.”
Steve stares at the side of Tony’s face.
"Really?" Rhodey crosses his arms, gaze just a little suspicious.
"Now this is a view. Oh, hey, there's the house."
Then he slips back into the room, leaving the door open a crack. Steve got the message. He nods to the two soldiers and they salute as he follows Rhodey’s lead and immediately shuts the door after himself as soon as he steps into the sterile smelling room. He turns around to face Toni, mouth open to deliver his speech, and stops dead in his tracks.
Eight minutes and twenty-one seconds later, Toni slumps against his shoulder, snoring quietly where her cheek is mushed against his bicep. The tablet is on her lap and the stylus hangs limply from her fingers. Steve is careful to extract the devices from Toni’s person.
“Yeah.” Natasha replies after a beat. “I wanna see what has them so desperate enough to go digging through shifting sands for whatever it is Toni made.”
He stops at the family picture that Uncle Rhodey took of them and smile.
, finally, they got him back. A little worse for wear, sure (if you count decades of brain washing, torture, and mind control, worse for wear), but he’s out of Hydra’s grasp, back with Steve, with
Toni really doesn’t care.
“Hey!” Bucky cries, glaring at Sam.
He waits for another twenty minutes before finally moving the genius to lay down across the couch. After tucking the blankets firmly around her, Steve packs up his things and leaves Toni to her z’s.
Stane chuckles, tucking his hands into his pants’ pockets. “I should’ve figured. How’s Toni been doing?”
"Hey, Steve, did you bring a suit?" she asks, waving the screens away to return her attention back to Steve only to nearly have a heart attack because what the fuck, he's already watching her, clearly fully recovered. "Jesus Christ, how long have you been staring?"
It’s a testament to how much Steve is holding himself back from making a jab at Stane that he doesn’t hear Toni open the door to Howard’s room, saying, “Toni is doing just fine, Obie.”
“And you know to send a bird our way should any trouble arise,” Rhodes is saying to the older man as they reach Steve.
"I need you to listen to me," Toni says, the familiar rush of frustration making her jaw tight.
“Who?” he asks when everything came rushing back (sounds, smells,
“Oh, uh, Rhodey, Steve, Pepper, and Obie. And now you.”
He groans.
As a ten-year-old, Toni didn’t understand the way Steve’s face twitched while his eyes went distant and he quietly thanked her for the offer but declined.
“Steve.” Howard’s voice is raspy and tired, slow with each syllable. “I need you to come to the hospital.”
There was a time in Steve’s life where he didn’t need an alarm clock to wake up. He’s learned to take life a little easier since then, however, so sue him if he grumbles a bit when he hits snooze on his phone after it goes off. He promptly shoves his head under one of the many pillows the guest bedroom afforded him.
“Yes, yes, you are.” He presses a long kiss to her cheek, then brow before pulling back. She loops her arm through his and allows him to walk her back to Pepper, the strawberry blond man waiting patiently as ever.
“Must be used to it.” Steve raises his voice so his men can hear him, “Let’s hurry up, Knights! We have a big lunch waiting for us!”
“Excellent!” Thor thunders from Steve’s left. He was sitting on the next log over with his not-brother Loki, nearly taking up the entire thing, massive arms raised in a cheer. “Truly, an entertaining display of your superior aiming skills, Master Hawk, Lieutenant.”
Not from doing Spider-Man stuff, not entirely.
“Well, he sure has the whole castle in a frenzy,” Bucky comments from Steve’s side. “Isn’t it kinda weird though, that this is the first time any of us will ever see him? I don’t think they even have his portrait up in here.”
"Because we're awesome facial hair bros?"
But as he had told Peggy, he has taken an oath, and if he wants to keep the peace, he has to set a good example and be courteous to the Prince else he’d “accidentally” throttle the young man.
Steve doesn’t answer, but his shaky sigh speaks volumes, so Toni silently waves at JARVIS to pull up some screen so she could start fixing the problem with the ice. Toni is absolute shit and comforting and she knows Steve is absolute shit at receiving said comfort, so she does what she does best: pretend everything’s all fine and dandy.
She gives him a tight hug, and Steve breathes in her familiar scent of roses and peppermint. “What do we know, Pegs?” he asks as they pull away.
“Oh!” Toni immediately drops the towel to start unbuckling at the straps across her shoulders. “You should’ve led with that! Let’s go!”
Steve huffs a silent laugh. “And you haven’t improved at all.”
“Just as extra protection, Miss Stark. Hydra’s merely been exposed, not entirely taken care of.”
“Hey, listen.” State stalls her departure with a hand on her elbow, patting her arm. “Take it easy okay? I think I got the board right where we want them.”
“How did you even fall?” Steve sets her down by the couch and Toni’s legs are back on the ground with a loud clang. He stares pointedly at the boots then at the rest of the stuff hanging off her back. “What’s going on, Toni?”
“I’m looking into where they could’ve acquired their weapons,” Howard tells them, and Steve has to set his mug down or else he’d crush it. “I have Toni’s assistant and AI looking into it.”
Steve frowns and opens his mouth to speak when the door was opened and Howard stood on the other side, leaning heavily on his walking cane and looking as if death warmed over. However, there was still a spark in his dim eyes. “It’s very convenient timing, if you ask me,” the man says gruffly as he leads them into his office. Obviously, his hearing aids were working just fine.
She and Howard were heading somewhere for Christmas when they were attacked by the elusive Winter Soldier. It was dumb luck that Steve found out what Howard was carrying with him and drove after the man, catching up just in time to see a masked man pulling Toni by the neck out of the mangled car.
Steve manages to get away from the mess DUM-E made and briskly walks over to the couch. “JARVIS...does Toni have a concussion?”
Steve also thanks whatever deity is listening for the music and chatter going about because he can focus on that instead of having to consciously stop himself from straining his ear to hear what Toni and Potts are talking about. As it is, however, he can still make out muted words every now and then. Still, it means Steve has no idea why Toni comes back in a couple minutes later, looking distracted as she makes a beeline back to the bar. (He ignores the warm bloom of relief that courses from his chest.) Coulson isn't there anymore so Steve dutifully follows her, only sparing Potts' silhouette a parting glance.
“I’m so sorry,” Potts apologizes again as he lifts a length of copper wire up, hand dripping from said inorganic discharge of the device (whatever that means) and continues to pull and tug just as Toni says, “-and make sure you don’t pull out the magnet at- at the end of it!”
“I don’t think they meant it for your entertainment, brother,” Loki says drily, emerald eyes rolling before he goes back to reading whatever tome he had decided to bring tonight, magic light dancing across his fingertips so he could see clearly.
Hawk points at Steve and Steve already knows the words that are about to come out of his mouth. “He’s the mom to General Carter’s dad on the battlefield.”
Much later, after talking with Obadiah and going through papers for Stark Industries while trying to work out a rough timeline for his next expedition, Howard whisks Toni away from the Jarvises, an idea blooming in the back of his head.
It’s an unusually hot spring day, so they weren’t wearing their full armor, but they were all still burning. Some had already thrown aside their tunics, Bucky had removed his left glove, and Steve was close to striping his own clothes off.
“I’ll see you inside.” Toni presses a quick kiss to Stane’s cheek and Steve takes a few steps ahead to intercept her.
Sir Carbonell’s shoulders slump before he waves a hand dismissively.
Steve saved her then despite his trauma with big bodies of water, and she’s looked up to him ever since.
Peggy chuckles. “Not quite. I’m looking into this Ten Rings people, using what agents we have left that I trust. I know Steve said the place was a fiery mess when they checked it out, but with groups like this one it takes more than one attack to take them out completely.”
She looks at her captor straight in the eyes. “I refuse.”
Several times over the ten years of the war, Steve had fought side-by-side with Rhodes who became a Captain of a special task squadron several years before Steve. No one really knew what Rhodes’ team did, but he worked a lot with Natasha who always had nothing but good things to say about the other Captain and his men, so the common speculation about their squad is that they dealt with the behind-the-scenes battles that Natasha thrives on.
“That Toni knows what’s she’s doing. She’s a grown ass woman, Steve, who’s been in this business for almost two decades now.” Howard exhales harshly on his end. “This isn’t anything new. She’s been to Afghanistan before.”
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Steve tells Rhodes.
Steve's chuckle is nearly lost to the wind, but he's standing close enough to her shoulder that she was able to hear the fond edge to it. "Tell a Stark they can't do something you might as well be giving them you're blessing to do it."
“Yeah.” Toni huffs around a tired smile. “Okay, Aunt Pegs.”
“Okay, let’s do this right,” Tony calls out into the workshop, metal boot clanking as she moved about, doing once last check of her surroundings. “Start mark, half a meter, and back and center.”
Howard hums. “And? What’s the next step?”
“Ah.” Steve had thought as much. This has been an issue since the end of the Great Civil War. “Still refusing to come out of hiding and join us mere mortals here in the capital, huh?”
