“It would get him through the rift with me,” says Dean, snapping his fingers as he realizes another problem that can be crossed off the list, “and it would rip up his contract. The Empty only wants angels, right? If he’s human, it can’t come for him again, even if he’s happy.” God, Dean hopes he’ll be happy.
Oh holy Varg, he had invited Dean over to dinner! What was he thinking? That was incredibly untoward. And his brothers were right there. Who would also be at dinner!
Castiel just nodded, still overwhelmed with the whole situation, and hesitantly stepped into the tub. As soon as he sat down and was covered with the warm water, he let out a blissful sigh. Nothing could compete with a hot bath – especially not after the cold of the last days.
“Very good talk.” Castiel stepped even closer to Dean and inhaled at the taller man’s neck. After the couple of hours apart, Castiel loved to drink in that scent again. He had not been upset or anxious while Dean was gone like he had feared – but it was wonderful to have him back home.
“Well, I like to think I am a healthy mixture of both,” Gabriel grinned. “But in all honesty: I have lived in the East for quite a while now. And no matter how much I might have hated it at first, life is a lot easier here. You just need to know how to handle the packs around. For example, the Winchesters are hung up on honour. And since I have never offended them, and I came here without protection, they will not charge at me unless I insult someone in a very public way.”
. He was used to ruthless, scary alphas, quiet betas and timid omegas. But Charlie was not at all like any alpha Castiel had ever seen, and Garth seemed awfully sweet for a beta, not to mention that neither Jody, Kevin or Alex acted submissive at all.
“What took you so long?” were, of course, his father’s first words. His tone was rough, almost accusing, not worried. “We had expected you days ago.”
Six? Castiel perked up, but Dean looked only mildly interested. At least to the others in the room – Castiel knew the alpha well enough to notice the tight line around his mouth as Alastair continued stroking a hand over Castiel’s chest down to his pants. Then he started to open Castiel’s fly, and a muscle in Dean’s jaw twitched. While the knife was still hovering over his stomach, Castiel did not dare to move – and send out a silent prayer that some miracle would happen. Soon. Because right now, he did not see a way out of their situation. Castiel closed his eyes and fought the feeling of defeat that was starting to claim his whole body. He opened them again as images of the past victims showed up in his mind. It would not help him one bit if he thought about what Alastair might do to him. So he forced his mind to focus on the gun mere feet away, trying to find a way to get there. Or maybe, if they could deflect the couple long enough, Jody Mills would worry because they didn’t answer anymore. It was unlikely however, since they should only report if someone would leave the place or act conspicuous – and no one had expected the murderers to ever act in Little Heaven, much less for Dean and Castiel to be an actual target. But Castiel was willing to grasp at straws.
“Exactly.” Castiel smiled. “So, instead of you being reckless, I think you were rather cautious by telling someone to call Sam. You listened to your gut – and that is what you usually do best.”
The next couple of minutes, Castiel got more and more excited at the prospect of meeting with his brother. Dean was pacing back and forth through the apartment and Castiel assumed the alpha was subconsciously marking his territory. That presumption just intensified when the alpha kept coming back to his mate and let a hand rest on Castiel’s neck for a second or ran it through his hair.
“We should get something to eat. I thought… I wanted to go to the Roadhouse with you. It’s a diner I often visit. The owners are good friends of mine and they have the best burgers you ever tried. But… this day has been exciting enough already and we will see Ellen and Jo tomorrow anyway. You would rather go home and relax a bit? I mean, otherwise there will probably be some more nosy questions. And hugging.”
Castiel went upstairs to change his clothes while Dean freshened up downstairs. Before they could get out of the door, Missouri bellowed: “Take the trash with you, alpha. Since you are heading for the garage anyway.”
“As you probably know, the mating bond means a profound change for an omega. This does not mean, however, that you as an alpha are unaffected. It is normal to feel rather possessive of your mate, some alphas might also manifest a strong urge to protect and provide for him. And of course, the impulse to breed.
“I guess … that is even better, isn’t it? Having your brother here. Just let me text Sammy, tell him and Jess I will come over.” Castiel looked confused. “To give the two of you time to talk? I mean, I definitely want to meet your brother, but then I can just excuse myself for an hour or so.”
This was very different from whenever Michael was seen outside palace grounds – the people were expected to bend a knee and hail their alpha. No one would ever dare to just wave their hands or call their alpha by his given name.
“Then maybe you could ask him when he is going to finally make an official move on Lisa. That should shut him up.”
But if any of them ever felt desperate, they did not let it show. Balthazar made jokes and flirted with Anna every time he started to shiver while the alpha countered with dry humour and repeatedly encouraged the other two by telling them how far they had come already.
But thank heavens, when Castiel trotted towards him and even nuzzled at his side, almost playfully, Jack only growled. It was a strange sound, more poutful than threatening. But he was far away from safe. Dean understood that Castiel thought he could tease his friend to come out again, but Dean didn’t agree with him. He had seen this countless times before, and with wolves who were weaker and older than this one. But his Mate still tried to rub his head over Jack’s and licked over his left ear affectionately. When Jack suddenly snapped his teeth at Castiel, Dean’s patience ran out. He had let him try, but Dean would not give the boy the opportunity to kill his Mate.
“But… why? I mean how did you come to this conclusion?” Castiel was honestly curious. No details had been given to the public that would make anyone think of Little Heaven.
Castiel tipped his head to the side, exposing his throat to the alpha. Dean let out a low growl and buried his nose in Castiel’s neck. The feeling of a scruffy cheek rubbing over his sensitive skin sent shivers down Castiel’s body. The omega suddenly felt all too hot and wanting for something. He moved his hips upwards, because it seemed the right thing to do. One of Dean’s hands had moved down to Castiel’s thigh. Which also seemed very right.
Dean rolled his eyes: “Jesus, Cas, let them get in first. Let’s eat in peace before we start questioning them.”
With Michael hardly able to walk, it became Gabriel’s task to hunt for them. Castiel offered to help, but he had never tried to catch a rabbit before, so he acted like a klutz more often than not. Gabriel repeatedly snapped at him, losing his temper more readily than usual. The fear that some of Lucifer’s pack followed them just added to the tension, and the three brothers sometimes hardly spoke with each other for days.
“That’s not true, Dean. Charlie and Benny are working right now with the team of SecCo. They probably just need more time to…”
Castiel still looked angrily at the man, and Dean could understand him. He tried not to pay too much attention to the cut on Castiel’s neck, or otherwise he was certain he would just punch the beta to death. In front of his kids. But Castiel had released him in the first place, so Dean thought he pitied him as much as he did.
Alastair wraps an arm around Dean and spins him to face his rack. “I mean, look at what you’ve done here.” The once-woman stares through Dean with eyes gone flat in shock, barely hanging onto consciousness. “You’ve made progress. I haven’t seen such genius, such raw talent, in centuries! Maybe not since your friend Azazel.”
They both scream. The searing imprint of Castiel’s hand burns into Dean’s skin, raising it in red, angry bubbles and sending lightning through Dean’s body. At the same time, a choking darkness crawls from Dean’s skin up Castiel’s arm.
like his Father’s other creations. This man is only human, after all. How could he possibly warrant an emotional response from an Angel of the Lord?
Dean curses their universally shitty timing. He looks around them once again, as if there might suddenly be a glowing exit sign beside their heads. Moving his neck brings on a rush of dizziness so intense, it could only be blood loss. The crushed arm must be practically hemorrhaging by now, especially if the rocks around them have shifted. “Okay, well, no way a human could do what you’re doing right now. They’d be squashed like a bug. Besides, you teleported to our motel, what, yesterday? You’re definitely still rocking the angel mojo. Now why don’t you prove it by stowing the existential crisis and zapping us out of here. Capiche?”
Dean can’t shake the churning anxiety in his gut that maybe he hasn’t heard from him because something happened. A hint of shame rises at the thought, like he shouldn't be worried about an angel when they're the ones who orchestrated this whole fiasco.
Instead, Cas simply twists at the hips and flips the man over his head, smashing him to the ground like it’s nothing. The crash echoes through the bar, and tussles and yelling die down. Everyone turns to stare at the slight man who’s just destroyed three much bigger guys, leaving a wake of carnage in the form of groaning goons and splintered floorboards.
Because he’s not wrong. It was his job to protect Dean, his literal God-given purpose, and the role reversal must be a trip. Dean has definitely felt a degree of self-consciousness whenever Sam is the one sponging off the blood, like him taking care of Dean somehow violates the laws of physics. Dean traces the line of knots down Cas’s forehead, and eyes the injured ankle tucked between his own knees. Cas isn’t prepared to cope with the struggles of humanity like the Winchesters are. For millennia, he relied on his power and strength, and now this crucial piece of his identity has been taken from him. Dean thinks of the ironic scars running down his back, the ones Cas tries to keep hidden whenever he changes. They seem like nothing more than a cruel reminder of Heaven’s wrath, of how severely Cas has been punished for choosing free will. He must feel so powerless to stop any of this, and Dean knows just how much that can set you back on your heels.
Cas closes his eyes, and light passes from his hand into the injury. Dean winces at the heat of it. Sometimes angel healing mojo wraps around him like a blanket, warm and comforting. Right now, it feels more like a static shock.
He holds him for a few minutes, lets the shaking subside before he pulls away. Cas stares at him for a beat, that old charged look from his angel days, but his expression turns cold and distant when he swipes a finger across Dean’s cheek. He presents the smear of red.
With both of them distracted, the swirling energy threatens to overpower their connected hands. Fear rises in Dean’s throat, choking him, but Castiel refuses to fail his charge now. He gathers his power and channels his own grace directly into the spot where hand meets shoulder. He seeks out the ragged holes in Dean’s spirit, the tattered edges of this man placed on the path to monsterhood. He eases the mind and soothes the heart, sets the bones and cleanses the blood.
Cas stares with bated breath. Dean reaches behind his sternum and unlocks whatever ugly thing it is that kept him from blurting this out years ago.
It isn’t until he stands, leveling his eyes to the thing’s chest, that Dean catches a glimpse of the perfect circle of gold ringing the creatures heads.
Dean steels himself against the programmed flush of shame. He is not embarrassed by this. He’s just so used to pushing down his own desires. But wants this, and he’s gotta say it. “I want to tell him I love him, Jack. I need to. He’s gotta hear it. And I want to get him out of that turbo hell void of bullshit and hold him in my arms and know that he’s safe and okay and alive.”
with the most inferior territory. It was a lot smaller and had fewer riches than either Michael or Lucifer’s kingdoms – but for some reason, the youngest brother had never complained. The estrangement between the brothers had only began when Gabriel refused to join the attack on the Winchester pack – his own land nearly bordered to the desired territory and thus, the older brothers would have liked to use this to their advantage. But Gabriel had shown no interest to subdue the Winchesters. He even went as far as to say he did not need more space anyway – a point of view both Michael and Lucifer could only sneer at.
Robert was the first to lift his spoon to his mouth and even before he had tasted anything, he brushed his plate aside and claimed: “I don’t like this. I want carrots.”
The Alpha was completely torn in that moment. Castiel looked absolutely adorable in his pride, but some part of Dean could not help thinking: You’re a goddamn wolf – couldn’t you have at least gone for something as big as a rabbit! He tried to reason with himself that squirrels were fast and not a bad catch for Castiel’s first attempt – but still, there was absolutely no meat on them.
Only afterwards did Castiel realise the older alpha must have thought that the couple had been fighting – and Dean left because might still be angry.
His father shot Dean a glare, but he would not apologise for his remark. He and his men had fought against Lucifer almost single-handedly while Michael had safely waited at home and took half the credit. John chose to ignore his son, but Dean was sure he silently agreed with him.
Castiel did not like the melancholic look on his friend’s face. “So, you mean if Benny asked, you would say no?”
here?” Castiel had started to feel self-conscious and the last line sounded probably too defensive, like the alpha had accused him of anything.
“I … ahem… I am grateful, that you saved me from Lucifer’s goons, Alpha. But I thought I would now… I don’t know… go back to being on my own… Sir.” Castiel added when he remembered whom he was talking to. The man in front of him just didn’t look like the master of all Alphas, so it was easy to forget how dominant he was, even for another werewolf.
“What?!” creaked Charlie and Balthazar at the same time while Rowena crooned: “Aniol seems a lot more interesting than Winchester…”
Castiel felt a weight being lifted from his chest. Maybe it was possible that someone else had come in and left again without being seen or recorded. That would be enough for reasonable doubt, wouldn’t it?
“Ah, Castiel, there you are,” Michael sounded impatient, like Castiel had kept them waiting instead of arriving perfectly on time. But he was used to his brother’s briskness.
“Thursday?” Castiel was glad Dean had asked the question – since all he could do was blink rapidly. He had known that the Captain was in a hurry, but that would leave them only three days. Three days until they had to pretend to be newly mated. “You mean like
“You know, I thought growling and snarling was frightening, but Dean remained completely quiet while Mirabel confessed. Only his jaw twitched from time to time – and that was
he met with any of his exes. He remembered how Dean had told him about Lisa; and how he had consulted Castiel if it was all right for Dean to train Ben’s baseball team after the boy had asked the alpha. But since Castiel’s guilt would not help him now, he concentrated on his anger. Later, he would apologise to Dean. He just hoped the alpha had not yet noticed his absence.
Just when Castiel feared this might have put Dean over the edge, his alpha turned around with a somewhat creepy smile and said with as much Alpha in his voice as Castiel might have ever heard: “Sit down, Uriel.”
So, the abducted prince found himself on a horse, sitting in front of the leader of the rebels. It felt awkward, but not as bad as he had feared. Castiel’s upper back constantly pushed against Dean’s chest, but otherwise the alpha seemed intent that they touched as little as possible.
“What a coincidence, that is exactly why I am here; to invite you as well!” Lilith clapped into her hands in excitement. “I will hold a little party on Friday night, and you and your omega simply have to come as well. Everyone important will be there.”
For three days, Castiel had not returned any of Sam’s texts. It was probably not too noticeable since it was not like they had ever had any long conversations over the phone, but maybe Sam was suspecting that something was wrong already. The beta was emphatic like that.
“You’re strong. I guess I couldn’t see that before. But I always wanted a strong mate.” Castiel scoffed. He did not believe
The episode had hardly ended when Castiel hurriedly excused himself, faking fatigue and not watching the news with Dean like he usually did. When he was under the shower, Castiel could not stop the pictures running through his head: Dean in his perfect suit, Dean’s dominant posture while he was talking to Lilith, the honest smiles at Cain’s dinner table. How close he had been to Castiel in the kitchen. And before he knew what he was doing, his fingers had wandered to his backside and into his hole, teasing his sweet spot while the warm water ran down his body. A few minutes later, he came with a loud cry.
He and Jack were standing a little uphill, looking down at the meadow. The sight was breathtaking. The damp grass glistened in the sunlight, still little clouds of mist here and there. The people moving eagerly, young and old. Laughter and grunts reached his ears.
It took a moment for Castiel to comprehend, but then he chuckled. “Definitely. I feel very much satisfied. In fact, I did not think I could ever feel like that.”
But that changed on the day when Michael, Gabriel and Castiel were formally accepted as pack members. Like it was tradition in most packs, the initiation ceremony included a scent marking ritual, performed by the Alpha. The three new members lied down in their wolf form in the middle of a circle formed by the rest of the pack. Dean first rubbed his head over Michael’s, marking him as one of his own with his scent, then he moved on to Gabriel. Castiel still remembered clearly how Dean then turned to him and rubbed his scent over Castiel’s head and back with a reassuring rumble. He thought it odd that up until this point, he had never realised how good Dean smelled. But at that moment, Castiel felt like rolling over to grant Dean access to every part of him, so he would be thoroughly marked by his new Alpha. As it was, Castiel did not expose his belly, but, almost equally embarrassing, he did tip his head to the side, exposing his vulnerable throat to Dean. A second later he felt a cold nose at his neck, tickling him a little. He hoped he only imagined his responding purr.
Dean moved so fast, Castiel could hardly see it until the alpha was right next to him. “What? Are you all right, Cas? You should not go out alone as long as you are not used to the place. You could have asked me.”
“That would be your decision.” Castiel looked at her with wide eyes and Jody smiled softly. “Of course, only as long as the alpha agrees. But I am aware that this is not an easy task to ask of you, and for this whole thing to be believable, it needs to be someone you would feel comfortable with. Someone you can trust. Otherwise, your scent would give away too much. Distress is not easily concealed – and from what we could learn, the omegas had been happy enough with their mates,” she said in a disbelieving tone. “Or at least they did not seem to be constantly scared. Now, unfortunately, you don’t work with the detectives too closely, so this will be difficult for you, no matter what. I could make a few suggestions of course. Like Mr Gadreel Ezekiel, who might not be as dominant as hoped but that just means he would be less intimidating, I assume. Then there is Benjamin Lafitte – quite dominant, but he has worked numerous undercover cases before, and has even done some courses on omega behaviour. I might even ask Bobby Singer to come out of retirement. It would be your choice however.” She looked Castiel straight in the eye; there was a directness about Jody Mills that Castiel liked. “I have worked some strange cases in my time as well, so let me give you some advice: Listen to your gut. Close your eyes and think about an alpha in this precinct you think you can trust. If there is no one that comes up, that is completely understandable, and I will look for another solution. Maybe the primary gender is not that important after all, and I can send out Donna with De…”
“No, not yet. But I heard he came back early this morning.” Alfie had not stopped grinning. “I have gifts for you.” He handed Castiel two --- pieces of wood. “They are clean, I promise.”
Benny seemed to be the only other person who noticed Gordon made a mistake, even though he did not seem to get the whole meaning as he said towards Gordon, in an all too gentle tone that fooled no one: “You’ve been brought down by a walking stick, Mr. Gordon? Care to explain how you mean that?”
Jody Mills might have seen Castiel – eyes falling closed while he was fighting sleep and Rowena still probed him with questions like he was a suspect – because she suddenly barged in and yelled at the Federal Investigators for risking the health of her detectives; detectives who had just been wounded while single-handedly stopping serial killers no less. Something the FI had not been able to do.
Castiel followed Dean through the line of tents and fireplaces, Sam on their trail. It had become dark by now, but Castiel was too deep in thought to really notice. Was this possible? That they should all be able to shift? Everyone? He heard the truth within himself. Castiel shuddered. To think that there were people out there, who had this Other just like him, but could never reach it.
Castiel tugged the blanked tightly around himself and was fast asleep in a moment, despite the uncertainty of his future.
Castiel frowned, but before he could say anything about not leaving Dean behind the alpha added: “I mean, your uncle knows you’re a magpie, right? You could just seek him out if we have trouble at the gate. Then, after you talked to him, you can come back and get me.”
Dean returned with his phone in hand and put the call on speaker, so Castiel would be able to hear the whole conversation.
Castiel scoffed. Of course he had. There was probably no alpha or omega on this planet who had not occasionally wondered about meeting their perfect other half. Still, Castiel said, mostly abiding to the truth: “I actually prayed I would never meet him. What good would that do? Knowing that some guard or soldier was my perfect fit, but never being allowed to marry him? That sounds worse than not meeting him at all.”
Castiel felt tears swell in his eyes. Dean was on him the next second, rubbing his head over Castiel’s, pulling the omega toward his chest. The alpha let out a reassuring rumble and settled closer to Castiel, practically cuddling him from top to bottom.
I always play a little bit with the characters’ ages in my fanfictions – but I feel like I have to say this on Tim Omundson’s behalf: Cain is quite a bit older than he looks in the show, about in his early seventies. ;-)
“Why should I? I think you’re right.” Dean raised an eyebrow. “I know that you only want to protect your own. Jack is young and strong; I can see now how dangerous that is. And running into a burning house without a plan was definitely a stupid idea that I hope he won’t repeat in the near future. Or ever.” Castiel stroked a hand over Dean’s arm before he stood up and put his plate in the dishwasher. “And no matter how much you might intimidate him from time to time, we both know you won’t hurt one of yours unless it is absolutely necessary.”
“Hey there, little brother. You scared me quite a bit.” Gabriel tried to sound humorous, but even Dean could see that his eyes were intent, searching over Castiel like he was looking for injuries. He knew the other alpha well enough to realise he had been seriously worried for Castiel. Dean almost chuckled when he thought back how Gabriel had argued with him that he wanted to be part of the searching team – even though he had hardly been able to stand up at the time. It had needed Sammy to calm the two alphas down before they could start a real fight – and to persuade Gabriel that he would not be much help if Dean needed to focus more on his wellbeing than Castiel. And now that nerve-wracking alpha would be part of his family. Dean rolled his eyes.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean said, and then looked to the ground. “I hope you feel better… I mean I hope you’re good. Not that you’ve been
Castiel was still sweaty though, despite the chilly air, and he looked calculating towards the river again. With Dean telling him he could take his time – and promising that he would keep the others away… and the water looked shallow enough that he was in no danger to be pulled away by the stream. Nodding to himself in encouragement, Castiel undressed completely and quickly walked into the water.
In retrospect, Castiel could not say how long they stood there, kissing with tongue and teeth; he only remembered how absolutely wonderful he felt.
A few minutes later, Castiel felt the same way when he and Dean stepped out and made their way to the assigned office. The couple with the collared omega just left the room. The alpha patted the administrator on the back while his mate looked even paler than he had in the waiting room. Castiel gulped as he watched them leave, suddenly overwhelmed with fear. Right now, Dean could make life-changing decisions for him. Would he be allowed to drive? To work? To carry money with him? To simply leave the house?!
“Yes! Good. Keep that up, Alpha. It works well with your role. Lucky for you both, the other alphas were all some degree of possessive bastards.”
After that, the conversation came to a halt and the detectives got up to leave a few minutes later. There was a grumpy agreement between Dean and Crowley that they would share any important information if they found something.
“A challenge.” Jody answered. “The class will try to attack Dean and Benny as a group. Before they will be deemed fit to guard the pack, everyone needs to pass some tests, mostly in single combat, hunting or survival training. But this is a group effort. Shifting is prohibited. At the first sign of wolf, the group loses. It is as much about defeating Dean and Benny as it is about holding their wolves in check.”
Pack law dictated that the winner had to spare the life of his opponent if he or she admitted defeat. Michael, bloody and fallen, bowed his head in submission – but Lucifer just snapped at his throat. So Gabriel stepped in, saving his brother’s life. Castiel did not know who had been more surprised by that – Michael, or Gabriel himself. Usually the mouthy beta tried to stay away from any serious risk.
“Look, Cas, I know you can handle yourself, and I don’t want to act like the jealous boyfriend here. But I really don’t like that you hang out with Uriel. Not because he is your ex, but because he is a dick. And the fact that he has been following you around the last couple of days… I just want to know you’re safe. I don’t want to patronise you or anything. I’m not like
“As ready as I’m gonna be. Seems to be a piece of cake. Charlie already sent me some presentations and whatnot. Guess I just have to repeat what the team has prepared for me and act confident.” Dean made it sound so easy,
His fingers played with the scarf that still hang loosely around his neck while he thought about a way to start the conversation – maybe Dean would be so surprised to hear Castiel talk about a mating bond that he’d forget all about Gabriel’s words. But in the end, Dean was the first one to speak. He made a few steps in Castiel’s direction and once he was close enough, he stroked a hand over the omega’s cheek.
And then he made the mistake of imagining Dean doing the exact same thing right now. That he would think about Castiel as he was pleasuring himself.
As soon as Sam halted at the station, Castiel basically jumped out of the car – it was either that or forcing Sam to take him to his alpha; right this second.
female alphas in Little Heaven since women seldom presented as such and were often unwelcome in alpha’s societies, or at the very least seen as inferior. Castiel assumed that most alpha women preferred to live in a place where your standing was not so much dependent on a penis. Though at the same time, strangely enough, being a male
Jack was seated at the table with Cesar, Garth and Charlie. All three seemed to treat the young man more amiable than before. After all, he was pack now.
Dean stroked a thumb over Castiel’s cheek. “I thought I might have lost you. When I ran up the stairs, and I smelled that sulphur scent – I thought I might be too late.”
“No, you’re not. Just two hours ago, you thought I considered you my property! You have hardly had enough time to think this through. And I don’t want you to do this because of some twisted form of gratitude or whatever. Not to mention that you have been raised to wait until after bonding. It is the way of your pack.”
“Here, Al, I hope you had a nice evening.” Castiel handed over the pie, hoping his voice sounded neutral. But then he could not stop himself from frowning; tonight, Alastair reeked even more than usual – Castiel thought he could detect lust and anger in the atrocious smell.
“In the end, we always sit on the couch, as close to each other as we dare, and watch a movie. And it helps, to have an alpha scent close to me if only for a couple of hours.” He chuckled again. “Just don’t tell him I know about these fake excuses. We never ever talk about it. I imagine he doesn’t openly want to admit how worried he is. And I feel like as soon as we address the matter, I would have to tell him it really isn’t necessary.” There was another shy smile on his face when he admitted: “And I really don’t want to do that.”
They had been on their way for hours already when Castiel felt ready to give up. After the shifting and the fighting, he was tired and exhausted. It was only the fear of another attack that allowed him to keep going, otherwise he might have just lied down on the ground to take a nap, for a week or two. From the corner of his eyes, he could see that Dean was looking at him with worry. Somehow, it made Castiel raise his chin and move on with a determined expression. They had come so far; he would not give up now. No matter how tempting a short nap sounded.
were the better suspect, Victor. But Uriel might have contacted the thief as well and he – or she – thought it would be easiest to just get rid of the problem altogether. By killing Uriel. That makes a lot of sense, doesn’t it?”
There was a soft knock on the bedroom door, and Castiel heard a muffled “Dean? Should I come back later?” from Sam.
“Ahm… no. No, it is all good.” Sam looked at his partner. “Should we go now? It’s already rather late.”
“So you became my friend to keep an eye on me. And on Dean.” He was surprised his voice was steady and did not show how hurt he was – even though he knew he had no right to be reproachful. After all, he was still lying to Meg himself.
“Like I said, you’re not what I expected, at all.” This time, there was definitely an appreciative tone in his voice.
Castiel stood in front of the bed, box still in hand, and looked rather shocked at Dean. “You want me to stay
– his words. And to top it off: He was probably even involved in killing his Alpha in collaboration with that Meg Masters who started the revolt. They seemed to have been close friends and were unhappy with how Zach handled things. I mean, that’s exactly what we need, a wolf plotting the murder of his Alpha.” He looked at Sam almost accusingly. “That would be me, in case you forgot.”
“What’s wrong, Cas?” Dean pulled back a little and his green eyes looked concerned. Obviously, he had only picked up on the sharp scent of fear so far. He looked down at the omega for another moment and Castiel could see exactly, when Dean realized what had happened. The alpha leaned down again and started licking at his claiming bite and for some reason, this action calmed Castiel down considerably. He felt safe.
Dean ruffled the beta’s hair. “Thank you. And you know I always said you’d be much better at the job than I am…”
After that conversation, Castiel had decided he would rather die than be mated into the Adler pack. Fortunately, Anna had had the same thought, and together they planed Castiel’s escape. They did not have much time to prepare – but at least they instantly agreed where they would be running to.
Harry Potter. And he had obviously no knowledge about Star Wars whatsoever. Dean readily supported the beta’s proposal to introduce him to a list of movies he must absolutely watch. Even Kevin, who was by no means as outspoken as the other two, chipped in that the world was meaningless without Star Trek. After that comment, a discussion arose about which was superior – Star Wars or Star Trek. Castiel didn’t really understand it – as far as he could make out, those two were just completely different things.
“But you don’t look overly dead to me.” Again, Castiel did not really know how the alpha meant his words. But he realised that he liked his voice – it was deep and full. And Castiel thought it could be even soothing, under the right circumstances. It reminded him of someone he could not name at the moment.
There was a moment of silence again and Castiel tried to take in everything he had just heard. He would have never guessed that Sam had been through such a nightmare – but there were just some scars you couldn’t see. At least, the brothers seemed to have been able to heal the wounds they had inflicted on each other.
“Good morning, handsome.” Dean smiled, leaned down and blew a kiss over the tip of his nose. Castiel turned fully towards the other man and let out a low hiss as he stretched on the bed. Dean frowned.
. Castiel let out a little purr of contentment. He could get used to waking up like this. Then he smiled softly at the thought that he actually
anyways,” Ms Mills muttered under her breath – and Castiel almost smiled. He knew that his Captain had a strong aversion to gender discrimination. It was a huge part why Castiel felt so at ease in this building, in a profession that was outnumbered with alphas and betas. “But the only thing the investigators seemed to agree with is that the offenders
But as much as it was okay for him to admit to his insecurities, Dean could do the same thing. Castiel knew his partner was in no way as
“Oh Gods, you smell so good. Will you be very mad at me if we delay dinner and I haul you upstairs first?”
Castiel was surprised at his own bold words. But neither Dean nor Bobby seemed to be angered by them.
“Eat a little. And pull that on – it’s gonna get real cold in a few hours. This time of year, it’s not pleasant to sleep outside.”
Castiel was immensely proud of himself. He enjoyed hunting, and he loved that he had another use for the pack than watching their children. And every time Dean barked out a “good work, mates” after a successful hunt, Castiel preened like a pup, tail wagging and chest puffed out.
“I’m gonna break the glass. You have to jump down. We are not that high anymore. It might hurt, but we should survive. But we have to do it fast. With the sudden pull of oxygen, there might be an explosion.”
During the short drive, there was so much tension, and arousal, in the air, it seemed like the premise of every literotica ever written for omegas in heat. And Castiel had read plenty of those.
Wonder and relief washed over Balthazar’s face – and only now did Castiel understand. With the Angyals, a messenger with one hardly working leg and a crippled hand would serve no purpose at all. Most likely, they would have been thrown out of the pack, left to fend for themselves. Michael had even once abandoned one of his own sons in the woods, right after he was born. And healers – at least those who tended for the common folk – rarely knew what they were doing. And the one or two who did, they only worked for the Angyal family. Castiel had heard whispers of women who would sell herbal teas and other medicine, but they better not get caught by the palace guard.
The Lord of Loki seemed somewhat appeased and resumed eating his panna cotta while chatting with Dean about the cultivation of cocoa beans. Both men seemed to be absorbed in the subject. Huh. Castiel wondered at the familiarity in which the two men spoke. When had that happened?
It was Charlie who came rushing into Castiel’s office on one Friday morning, nearly three weeks after Uriel’s death. Her hair was rumpled and she looked like she had not slept at all last night, with a little help from excessive caffeine consumption, probably.
After nearly two hours, Dean looked at Castiel: “I like it. I do. I believe we are going to work very well together. Our companies, that is.”
thoughtless, the beta was a cunning businessman and certainly would not try to expand without solid evaluation beforehand. Castiel did not want to make any promises without talking to Dean first, though. Not because he thought Dean would forbid him to take another job, but because it felt right to him to discuss such a big step with his mate.
“Don’t worry. Just give Dean his 24 hours. You know he’s always had your back before. He’s not going to stop now.”
“Well, I have seen your smile before, but not those maps. And they are intriguing – to someone who has never been in this area before.”
Claire licked her tongue all over the face of the man on the ground, and everyone around laughed, including the victim. Castiel assumed this was some form of apology – but he was not sure. It would not have placated
Castiel shuddered at the thought of traveling through the wilderness with a band of gruff alphas. At least Dean would be among them; it was comforting for Castiel to know one of the group already. And he was certain that Dean would not let anyone approach Castiel in a disrespectful way. Especially since they needed him to convince Gabriel of their cause. They would not get anywhere if they suddenly decided to
The storyline is cliche - it always is in low class pornography - but it’s enough to get Dean’s mind wandering. The actress is a little younger than he would have liked, but her dark eyes and darker hair help remind him of Lisa, which is all he really wants to think about. How he’d had someone, right there, warm and soft and welcoming, and he’d fucked it up once again.
Castiel’s hands clench and release next to him on the bed, and Dean knows he’s going to regret his actions, but he leans over just to put a palm over the growing tent in his pants. “There. You want to touch it. How you wanna touch it is - it’s different, every time. But for now, start easy. Over the pants.”
“How you doing, Cas?” he asks, voice rough and deep and Cas can only groan in response, a nod of his head as his eyes open to meet Dean’s. There’s a look of ecstasy that can only come from finding the joy of sex on his face, and Dean wants to
They sit there in silence, Dean waving a hand in the air to prod Cas into talking. It takes another moment, but somehow it’s never really awkward with Cas. Just...natural. Dean blames it on the ‘profound bond’ Cas claims they share, but really, his silences are just different than Sam’s. It’s not like Cas will keep things from him - like that he’s missing a soul, for one - but more like he just needs to figure out a way to get it out of his brain and into words for Dean to understand.
“Ground rules,” Dean instructs, pushing them both back to the beds, Casa Erotica still playing silently - a new scene now, a cheerleader in a skirt much too short to be allowed on any playing field and her friends all giggling and touching one another. “We are absolutely never to speak of this again. That’s rule number one. Understand?”
He leaves Castiel there, but even with his offer, he knows Castiel will be gone by the time he returns. He’s not proven wrong, either - the air is still, quiet when he comes out of the bathroom, his head clearer than it had been since he turned on the damn TV almost an hour ago. But he is surprised - not at Castiel’s disappearance, but at the emptiness that follows it.
. Dean nods in his direction, prompting him - he gets the hint enough, though Dean wishes he wouldn’t take off his pants entirely, the scene is jarring enough without seeing Castiel in a trench coat and little else.
,” he grumbles. This is definitely not how he saw his night off going. But he’s got no choice - the poor guy is going through his own awkward version of puberty, and it’s not like anyone else is going to teach him about the birds and the bees.
. He’s trying not to look too hard at him - the vessel Cas is stuck in, a face as familiar to him as Sam’s at this point. Confusion is evident, almost always is when they’re in a non-work related topic, but there’s a new glint that Dean hasn’t ever seen from Cas before.
Castiel tilts his head momentarily, but nods in agreement, and only then can Dean allow himself to continue. This - this is about to be the weirdest night of his life, and the last thing he needs is Castiel to accidentally blab about it in his garrison, or whatever.
Castiel doesn’t stop watching Dean at all - it would be disconcerting if it wasn’t so hot - eyes boring in on Dean’s hand as he works it up and down his shaft, his other kneading his balls. He tries the motions out on himself; Dean can tell the way he’s gripping almost too tight, trying to figure out what the right amount of pressure is, how he tests the weight of his own balls in his hand. A thousand inappropriate questions flow to mind, but Dean chooses to ignore them, focusing instead on the way Castiel’s tongue darts across his lips, wetting them before he gasps out loud. It had been a twisting motion, a slight jerk of his hand but he does it again and even from a couple of feet away, Dean can see the way Cas’ eyes flutter close, the look of pure contentment on his face.
Instead, he launches the thing across the room, in the direction of his bags on the floor. What he needs is some fucking sleep - that’ll cure his ache for human touch, or not so human as the case may be. And if his dreams consist of lush brown hair interchanging with surprisingly blue eyes, no one needs to know but him.
“I’m sorry,” Cas responds, but Dean can never really tell if he is or not - he’s seemed to pick up on the custom of apologizing for minor inconveniences. Dean just shakes his head, wiping his hands off on his jeans and trying to kill his own erection with the power of positive thinking. ( Cas is really a cock block, so it shouldn’t be that hard, but Dean was
“Rule number four.” His mouth forms around the words and he goes back to staring intently at the blondel on the screen, watching her spit on her hand for lubrication before wrapping it around the dick on screen. “How unsanitary.”
“It’s true. Even when demons aren’t present in a situation, their shadow finds a way to, um...wreck? No. Wreak. Wreak havoc on human life. Or perhaps in the bigger picture of this case, accident’ly inspire med’cal breakthroughs.”
Once his head is really starting to spin, Dean manages to mumble. “Cas...I need you to keep talking.”
The rough saw of his voice is lacking the bass that shakes through Dean’s skull most days. It’s breathier, higher pitched, like someone flipped off his subwoofer. Dean closes his eyes for a moment and remembers the stoic gravel-gargling SOB who walked into that barn, and considers how little he resembles the man before him now. This Cas gave up everything he had ever known just because he believed in Dean, and Dean said this was worth dying for. True humanity, in all its glorious raw edges and beautiful imperfections. But also in its horror and pain. Cas is hurt and scared and rejected by his
“Everybody leaves me, eventually. Especially when I don’t want ‘em to. I assumed it was only a matter of time before you did, too.”
Dean fixed his eyes on the carving of Castiel’s name, a stubborn set to his jaw. He took a few deep breaths.
“Are you sure about that?” Alastair lands a kick to Dean’s shin, shattering the bone. He can barely gather enough breath to scream. “So what, you’re dreaming? I don’t think dreams are supposed to hurt this much.” One more well placed slice has Dean gargling his own blood. “You never got out, boy. You’ve been here with me all along.”
Their lips meet for the first time in a bunker in Lawrence, Kansas, and it isn’t fireworks or confetti or a trumpet fanfare. It’s the quiet snapping of a twig in a dam, long since holding up too much weight. It’s the final puzzle piece that makes the whole picture fall into place. It is freedom and glory and love, quiet and simple like no one ever expects it to be.
Dean’s eyes shine. With a deep breath and a single tear rolling down his cheek, he performs the noblest display of courage Castiel has ever seen.
Dean feels a cold shadow pass through him. He instinctively pulls Castiel hard against his chest and tries to scan through the darkness.
Cas doesn’t rise to the bait. “Sam called for me. He said you needed assistance that he could not safely provide.”
Something cold flutters through Dean’s chest at that. There’s nothing in the world that he could say to make it better, so he doesn’t try. He lets it shroud them both like a blanket of snow.
Sam Winchester’s voice may be grating at times, but in this moment it is the most beautiful sound he has ever heard.
“Well, what if I’m not?” Dean shouts. “There’s barely any human left in me! I am everyone’s worst nightmare, myself included. Monsters belong down here. You need a Righteous Man for your big heavenly plans? Guess what, I’m not your guy!”
Dean blushes. "Yeah, that sounds like me. Sorry, it's probably distracting to have me yelling inside your head when you're trying to gank some monster."
“My true form likely wouldn’t allow for the type of movement dancing requires anyway.” Cas goes on as if he hasn’t just earnestly and calmly set Dean’s pulse racing twice its resting speed. “What is that phrase? The bigger they are, the harder they fall? If I had tried to dance, I probably would've fallen pretty hard. And since taking
“I know, I know,” Dean says, shaking his head. “That’s not what I meant. Shit. Look, I love Eileen, and I love how happy she makes you. God, Sammy, what I wouldn’t give for you to have that picket fence.” He smirks, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Imagine how cool I’d be as an uncle, huh?”
The staring contest resumes. It bothers Dean's neck from this angle, but he doesn't want to look away.
If there’s anything that might prompt Castiel to move faster, it’s the head of that demon rolling back towards his decapitated body.
One hundred and thirty nine stitches, two titanium rods, four screws, and one cast stretching from palm to shoulder later, Dean is laid up in his own private hospital room. The medication he was given in surgery should keep him unconscious for the next six hours or so. Sam managed to get Cas discharged with some flirting and forged signatures, but he couldn’t convince him to return to their motel room to rest. Instead, Cas sits by Dean’s bedside and listens to his heart monitor.
Cas pulls him to his feet. Dean wobbles a bit with vertigo, but is able to brace himself with one hand on the wall and one on Cas’s shoulder. The guy feels surprisingly solid under the baggy trench coat, so Dean dares to drop more of his weight there. Cas compensates easily, positioning an arm around Dean’s waist. The steady pressure of his hand warms the skin of Dean’s hip, currently clad in nothing but thin shorts. Cas supports him into the bedroom, having to turn nearly sideways to drag them through the narrow door frame. Then he flips back the covers and deposits Dean into bed.
Dean wades into the dark and blinks as his pupils dilate at the drop in brightness. He hears the whisper of skin on rock and can just make out how Cas is sliding his fingers along the stone walls. He silently walks the perimeter, testing its borders. Dean's warning to avoid the crystals dies on his lips as Cas starts weaving his palm through the spaces between them. Right. Angel. He can probably sense creepy magic better than Dean can. Aside from the faint glow of the gems, there’s ambient light from the entrance. Day and night do cycle here, but there's a chronic dusk to purgatory; a hazy, cool-toned fog that absorbs all warmth and never dissipates. As evening falls outside, that telltale purplish tint illuminates Cas’s profile, angled away.
“Humans should probably adjust their definition of ‘voice of an angel,’ huh?” Dean snickers. “I’m guessing celestial harmonies would leave my ears bleeding.” Cas makes a disgusted sound, like a child feigning being sick, and the bark of laughter from Dean’s core comes out like an honest-to-god
Things are honestly going...okay. Dean wonders if he’s jinxed them for even considering it, but they’ve settled into a pattern that works. The Devil is strangely quiet for now, Sam is back to being his regular bitchy self, they’re working normal cases like the old days. And having Cas around is, if he’s being honest, actually really awesome.
Cas pulls away after a dizzying moment. The gentle smile on his face is small and blinding. “We're terrible dancers, Dean.”
“The interstitial space between us is closer to my cerebral cortex.” Dean doesn’t think he’d be able to understand those words in that order even with all his blood still inside his body. “Now brace yourself. I’ll shift us above ground, laterally from the building.”
He walks back into the bar to a cacophony of yelling. The tattooed man has a hand fisted in Dean’s henley while the other is smashing blows across his face. Behind them, four of his buddies are crowding the brawling pair, shouting insults. The entire bar roils with violent energy, and smaller fights begin to erupt.
“I’m so sorry, Cas, it was the only way we could think to get you out of there, and I-I just couldn’t live with myself knowing you were there because of me, so-”
An enormous creak shakes the ground above them. Cas lets out a gasp as rocks shift and slide. The weight on his back suddenly lightens by half, but the abrupt change is enough to shock his muscles into failure. His elbows buckle and he dives to protect Dean’s head as the remaining concrete crushes them together.
A careful exploration reveals that the cave is uninhabited. It’s no more than eight feet wide for the first ten paces or so, but then it opens up quite deeply, and is high enough for Dean to stand at full height without bumping his head. The walls of rock are a slick dark grey, and a few stalagmites spike upwards from the back corner. Dean is about to deem it worthy and turn back when his eye catches something glittering on the wall. Upon closer inspection, he finds a cluster of iridescent crystals growing out of a crevice. There are more of them along the walls deeper into the structure, clearly thriving in the cool humidity of the cave. They glow from within, casting a warm haze inside the otherwise dark enclosure. It's not the first time he's stumbled upon something straight out of a fantasy book in purgatory. Dean has seen a pond gleaming pure silver like mercury, an archway of dead flowers and vines calling for him to pass through it, and some truly goblin-esque creatures looking for all the world like garden gnomes, eager to grant him wishes. But if his lifelong education in myth and legend has taught him anything, it's that beautiful things can still hurt you. He gives the crystals a wide berth as he skirts back to the entrance.
“I missed you,” he mutters into Jack’s shoulder, tears prickling behind his eyes. The return of that almost imperceptible hum makes them spill over.
He will be truly useless here once his powers to protect, defend, and heal are gone for good. Sam is the greatest human lore researcher Castiel has ever met, so his own encyclopedic knowledge will prove unnecessary. Dean can hold his own in a fight against nearly any creature, provided his arm heals properly and they don’t battle any more falling concrete in the future. And they have each other. Neither of the boys have ever truly needed anything else as long as that part remained true.
It’s a good life they have now, Dean thinks. The big bad demons are taken care of. They’ve perfected the home cooked dinner routine. They’re safe, they’re together, they’ve got a dog. By all rights Dean should be happy with it.
“It’s a long story,” Dean says. “The cliffsnotes version? We got you out of The Empty. And…” Dean reveals the glowing vial around his neck sheepishly. “...we had to make you human to do it.”
He can't name this feeling, this need to carry something in his arms like it’s precious. Not just because letting go would mean something horrible, but because having it and holding it forever could mean something miraculous.
As he watches Dean’s chest rise and fall, he ponders his gradual descent from Heaven. Lucifer’s plummet was violent, lightning fast, full of fire and brimstone. There was no doubt as to what was occurring. Any angel close enough to smell the sulfur knew to drop to their knees and mourn their lost brother.
“I’m fine, don’t...” Cas trails off as Dean’s hand reaches his shoulder and slides past a hot rush of blood to hit concrete.
form, I haven’t had the occasion to...move in a way that wasn’t violent. Fighting off angels, defending against monsters.”
Look at me." Cas tilts his head down, forcing eye contact. “Breathe. Your arm is still attached. It’s broken, and crushed beneath the stone. You’re likely losing blood, but I can sense that it’s still there and still connected to the rest of you. I promise.”
“No, you're right," Cas admits. "I should've told you. I just didn't know how, because I didn't want it to be true.”
“I can’t tell you how relieved I am that you’re here. Of course, because we missed you, but also because I really need your help, man. We gotta-”
Jack’s sudden presence standing above Dean startles Mira so much that she jumps to hide under the bed. Dean gets to his feet.
The Angel is stronger than Alastair. It seems to have infinite stamina and power, while towering three feet above the demon. Its bright glow never once falters with the clang of weapon on weapon, and Dean can tell it’s making Alastair angrier the longer the fight lasts. He gets the sense that ordinarily, this would hardly be a fair match at all.
Jack reads grimly through the passage. “Given the historic framework of this text, we can assume it’s bad.”
Sam rolls his eyes. “You’re not the only one who’s lost a person you love, Dean. I’m not judging you.” Sam takes the broom from his brother’s hand, puts it down, and grabs Dean’s shoulders. “I’m trying to jump start your problem solving skills.”
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean mutters before meeting Cas’s eyes one final time and turning away. He shoves past his brother into the bathroom, barely stopping himself from slamming the door behind him. In the dusty mirror, he can see how brightly his cheeks are burning, and turns towards the shower to escape the sight. It feels a little unnecessary now that he’s been mojo’d clean, but he could use the warmth anyway.
In the months Dean and Benny had been traveling as a duo, they’d passed most of the long, eerie nights pressed back to back on the dirt ground, staring into the inky blackness and watching for glowing eyes. Every now and again they’d stumble across an abandoned shack or a ramshackle cabin to hide in. Dean sighs thinking of those moments when he had actually been able to close his eyes; they were the closest he’d come to letting his guard down in what felt like decades.
“Shit, Cas,” he mutters, ducking his chin to hide the embarrassed flush of his face. “Warn a guy before he starts talkin’ bout his bodily functions.”
Cas stares at a spot over Dean’s shoulder, eyes blurring out to the middle distance. “Well, we frequently rejoiced, in Heaven. When our brothers returned victorious from battle, when Father created humanity.” An impossible fondness rises on his face. “When I rescued you from Hell.”
Gently, like he's handling something precious, Dean presses his chest against Cas’s back. The heat of the contact between them simmers, and Cas melts into it.
Dean squints at him, but Benny doesn’t budge. He playfully punches Cas in the shoulder instead. “We’ll work you into the rotation, Feathers, don’t you worry.”
Eventually, Dean wipes at his eyes with his sleeve and takes Cas by the tie for one more slow, delicious kiss. “We should go find Sam and Jack. I’ve been hogging you, and they’ll want their turn.”
Cas looks much the same as the last time they saw each other. Dark hair sticking up in all directions, trench coat wrinkled, blue tie facing the wrong direction. The purple circles under his eyes are a little more pronounced, but otherwise, he looks comfortingly familiar.
the ravine was right there. If he’d known the ghost would shove Cas like a rag doll, tumbling into the dark of a thirty foot drop to a stone outcropping.
A hard expression drops over Dean’s features, wiping the twinkle of hope from his eyes. “But since when do we get what we want, right?”
Castiel reigns in his focus to the angry green eyes boring into his own. The Righteous Man has been saved. That was his mission, and that mission is complete.
“You misunnerstan’, I'm not opposed.” Cas mumbles. “Just, perhaps another time...when I...can actually breathe?”
Dean rolls his eyes to hide a grin. “Yeah, well. You’re getting better. Now stop ruining my favorite song with Bible study.” Cas gestures weakly for him to continue. Dean’s voice gets stronger with each line.
Cas keeps his eyes open this time, and the grace shines out of them like sunlight on Dean’s face. The blood vanishes in an instant, leaving behind the sensation of his skin scrubbed clean. His nerves tingle, raw.
Dean gets the sense that he's dissembling, but he lets it go with a half-hearted swipe at Cas’s torso. Then he drops a hand to the polyester-clad knee beside his own and gives it a squeeze, careful not to disturb the fingers on his neck. “Whatever, man. Keep your secrets.”
“What, you didn’t think I was bi?” Dean lets out a humorless laugh. “Hate to burst your bubble, Sammy, but I’ve been sleeping with men as long as I’ve been sleeping with women.”
He sits up and tries to get his eyes to focus on the creature before him. He has to squint through his lashes to see any contrast in the light, for any form to become evident. As the thing steps closer, more details shift into focus. Eventually Dean makes sense of a vaguely bipedal shape. There is a torso, two legs, and two arms, one holding a viciously sharp silver blade. But that is where any humanoid resemblance ends.
“If you insist,” Cas gives in, eyes dropping to his own knees. “A prayer doesn't have to be in words. If the emotion is strong enough, we can pick up on it without them. A feeling, a hope, or a yearning can be enough when the need is dire.”
“Sam wasn’t here, that doesn’t count. I’m always regulated...reg-relegated to the...the back when iss th’ three of us.”
Dean sighs gratefully and dry swallows a few pills, ignoring the water until Sam glares at him pointedly. He rolls his eyes, winces again, and downs it all. Sam sits in the chair opposite Dean.
Dean weakly presses up against the stone, unsurprised when it doesn’t budge an inch. “Fuck, man. How many pounds of rock are you holding up right now?”
Castiel instantly feels a modicum of pain in his chest. In a nanosecond, he sends his grace sweeping through the vessel’s torso to examine the superficial injuries. None of Dean’s bullets have pierced his true self, and the body’s damage should hardly register to him.
over and over. Dean will roll his eyes, brush it off, and deflect away from the hot rush of blood in his cheeks with some crack at Sam’s outfit.
“Okay, shh...” Dean tilts his face down just so, and his lips brush Cas’s temple. His brain shrieks, tells him to pull back, step away,
When Sam comes back from Eileen’s the next morning, he finds Dean like that, slumped over the table and looking dead to the world. His heart skips a beat, but settles at the sight of the empty bottles strewn around his brother. Not dead then. Just dead drunk.
“Lean back against that...yeah, lean back hard.” Taking the wheel back with one hand, Sam pokes at the wounds with the other and pulls a hiss from Cas. “Sorry. This is really deep, man. We gotta find an expert to stitch you up, or the muscles won’t heal right.” Cas wonders why Sam can voice his worries aloud, articulate them so clearly, while Dean prefers to bury emotions and obscure his true meaning with jokes. “Press straight back into that, it’ll help slow the bleeding.”
Cas, the bastard, certainly seems angel-ed up enough to still be reading his mind. Either that, or Dean isn’t quite as smooth as he always claims to be. “Are you quite sure you’re qualified to be the instructor of such a skill, Dean?” He’s clearly fighting a smile.
“Absolutely not, Dean!” Sam yells. “You are not going to run a suicide mission that will cage you and Cas in The Empty, there’s gotta be another way.”
Sam and Dean both become horrifyingly domestic in the months that follow. Sam buys dog toys that quickly find themselves scattered across the bunker floor, chewed to bits by Mira, as they now call her. Dean goes a whole week without putting on real clothes, opting strictly to lounge in his robe and slippers, no longer fearing that he’ll wake up to a monstrous attack. Sam starts reading for fun again, dense science fiction novels and obscure biographies. Dean cooks them food every single day. Burgers, pasta, sandwiches, even that veggie bacon Sam had requested. He earned it, Dean thought.
“Dean?” Cas asks, and he snaps out of his reverie. Cas is sporting that little furrow between his brows. God, he’s always so concerned. Dean wishes he weren’t, wishes he didn’t have reason to be.
Humans in hell have a tendency to disintegrate over time. Demons are formed once the soul burns out of someone, past the point of no return. Once the heart gives up hope entirely, the demonic spirit takes over and the human soul is beyond saving.
“Hey! Just because I helped you kick Alastair’s ass doesn’t mean I’m coming with you!” Dean takes a deep breath. “I didn’t want to see you hurt just cause you came looking for me, but he wasn’t wrong. I am beyond fucked up. I have done worse things to souls down here than demons who’ve been around since the goddamn flood, alright? I am tarnished, broken, demon
They meet for the second time in a barn. It's a Thursday in September, and while autumn air blows a chill through the slats of wood, it is far warmer now than it was at their initial meeting.
He presses a hand to his opposing wrist; pointer and middle fingers extended and aligned, all others held together by the thumb. It is so often a motion he has used to heal, a miracle that has now been taken from him. Instead, he uses it to monitor the metered drumbeat under his skin.
"I'm just saying, you can't quote a man to himself like a song you've known by heart for years, and then pretend it's no big deal."
I am going to find Cas. Dean thinks, over and over. I am going to find Cas. I am going to find Cas. I am going to find Cas.
But Dean said what he said, so he sets down the bottle, gets to his feet with a groan, and brushes off his pant legs. He makes a big show of straightening out his collar, rolling up his sleeves, and clicking the heels of his boots together like Dorothy heading home. He may be as scared shitless as Cas looks, but hell if Dean isn’t practiced enough at humanity to hide it.
Next he reaches for the hem of Cas’s shirt, and helps him remove it slowly so they can get at his ribs. Dean expects the swath of bruising, the shallow breathing, the way Cas is holding his torso stiffly for fear of aggravating the injuries.
“But Cas has gotta be your exception.” Dean whispers fiercely. “We are this close to a chick flick happy ending, but none of it means a damn thing without him by my side.”
Dean checks his watch and curses. Ten minutes until the rift closes. He grabs the bandage from his pocket and quickly covers the oozing slice in Cas’s neck. There’s no light anymore, only normal, seeping, human blood. Jack said being human would wake him up in this realm, but Dean gets no reaction from the still unconscious Cas. He’s limp even as Dean presses on the cut harder, which ratchets up his anxiety a few thousand notches.
“You know, you can tell me if there are any sort of problems. Maybe we can find a solution together.”
Dean and Claire returned right before Jody had dinner ready. The two alphas had been out for over six hours and they both looked exhausted, having stains and a few scratches all over them – no blood though, as far as Castiel could see. They both reeked of sweat and excitement, but otherwise they seemed surprisingly balanced. As soon as he had stepped into the living room, Dean stalked towards Castiel and kissed him fiercely. Claire on the other hand was instantly on her way to the bathroom, yelling through the house that she needed to take a quick shower before dinner. Dean had grabbed a change of clothes from the car and occupied the guest bathroom to freshen up as well. Castiel was grateful for that – his body had a somewhat embarrassing reaction to his mate’s intensified scent. The smirk on Dean’s face told him that he had not been very good at hiding it.
The omega was surprised by the simple clothes Dean wore – most influential alphas at his home dressed in flashy colours, heels and precious fur coats. The most valuable part of Dean’s outfit seemed to be the artful knife on his belt.
Benny let out a sound between a growl and a sigh. “I don’t know anything, Castiel. Rogers questioned me for two hours yesterday. Between his attempts to trick me into saying something incriminating about Dean, he was mocking me for my relationship with Victor.” Benny clenched his fists. “It was not really how I planned to come out at my job. But I suppose I had to tell him what Dean and I had been talking about. And by now I’m sure everyone knows.”
“May I introduce you to my second son, Castiel? This is Samuel.” They bowed at each other after John’s words. “You will get to know him better in the next few weeks, so you can make your choice. Adam is still inside; you should meet him tonight at dinner if you feel well enough for the company. But of course, the most important thing now is to focus on your health. I imagine the last weeks have been quite exhausting for you.”
The taller figure ran towards Castiel, but Dean held her back and threw her to the ground before she reached him. There was a loud yell from underneath Dean, and someone exclaimed: “No! Chrissy, go back!”
Castiel shook his head no, suddenly feeling very stupid for having mentioned anything. “No. Not anymore. Like I said, it was probably nothing.”
After everyone was done and still chatted on, Alfie walked to their table and announced, eyes fixed on Benny: “I have watched you return today, you were all very successful with your hunt. Thank you for this delicious meal.”
Lilith clapped in her hands in delight, and even Alastair let out a gurgling laugh. The female alpha stroked a hand – not the knife – over Castiel’s chest. And Dean seemed unable to stop the snarl. But his voice sounded unexpectedly calm when he said: “Keep your hands off him.”
is that I have you bound and at my mercy. I can do with you whatever I want, and with your mate. And if you don’t believe it yet, you will in just a moment.”
Dean did his sexy eyebrow thing, and Castiel chuckled lightly. It felt wonderful to engage in a little light banter right after waking up. Until he remembered that maybe they would never again be in the police station together, that Dean might never again try to coax him into a little bit of fun in the office – and Dean instantly noticed when his scent turned sour. The alpha kissed him again, until Castiel felt dizzy, and then suggested: “What about a shower? That’s not a public place.”
Even though Castiel had replied in clear, short sentences, Dean felt like his brain could not keep up. There was too much information at once. The omega only snuggled against him again.
Dean was dreading that day, even more so because he feared Claire would take Jody and Alex with her – but for now, that future was still far away. And he had to admit, he was a little proud of her every time Claire tried to look into his eyes directly. That girl had a lot of fire. She just needed to keep her strength – and her wolf – under control before she would be able to hold any pack.
“See me? Now, Cas, you only had to ask.” Dean hopped off the bed and slowly reached for the buttons on his pants. The alpha made a whole show of pulling the piece of cloth off him, until he stood proud in front of Castiel. The omega took his time to drink the sight in. Dean looked stunning, from head to toe. Castiel let his gaze wander up and down the man’s body, blurring out the midsection until he was ready to look at the man’s cock. It was standing proud to the stomach, curls of dark hair at its base. Castiel swallowed. He knew Dean would be bigger than himself, being an alpha and all, but he had not expected him to be quite so--- well endowed. His eyes had been fixed on that certain body part for a while, and as soon as Castiel noticed he had been staring, he blushed to an even deeper shade than before.
The children were mostly interested in which kind of jam he preferred or whether his mom had made him eat spinach as well or if he knew exciting stories about alpha knights. Even when it was Garth’s turn, the beta did not ask anything about his heritage but if he was able to roll his tongue – and for the next ten minutes, all children tried to do just that.
Dean left his room in leather pants and a green tunic, still sniffing a little at himself to check he didn’t smell of omega in heat anymore. He had a strange feeling in his stomach as he walked down the corridors to meet his second in command. On the one side, he felt positively glowing. He had just spent the better part of four days in the bed of one amazing omega – and if that wasn’t enough to light his mood, he didn’t know what could. But on the other hand, he felt disappointed that he was not allowed to shout out to the whole world that his fiancé – even though that would probably not be official until they had talked to his father – had gone into a True Heat. But he could understand Castiel’s reasoning – well, he tried to. It was not that easy to follow his concerns since the perception of a True Heat seemed to be very different in Veenah, judging by the shocked look on Castiel’s face. But Dean had to admit that even in Winchester alphas often made lewd jokes about starting an omega’s heat – but that was just talk. Now that he thought about it, it was probably uncalled-for in any situation, but Dean had just never taken it too seriously. Because when it did happen, when an alpha and an omega would find each other, no one ever laughed about that. It was a blessing. Something to be celebrated with your friends and family.
Dean rubbed a hand over the back of his neck. “He did not need that much looking after, actually. He’s pretty tough. He might have even killed Abaddon after she attacked him. And after the excitement of the last months, a little bit of quiet probably did me some good.” Benny only raised an eyebrow at him – Dean was not exactly known to enjoy peace and quiet. At least not when it meant to just sit in a room and … what, read a book? So Dean changed the subject quickly. “Are there any news about Abaddon?”
Michael looked at the girl with terror –and tried to feed his own son a spoonful of mashed potatoes, without making a mess. Of course, that was forlorn hope – and then nine-month-old Charles spit a little bit of yellow mush on Michael’s shoulder. Castiel chuckled as he watched how his alpha brother still tried to look dignified as he whipped it off. Lisa just laughed at her mate – she did seem to find him endlessly funny.
, he was just --- focused. The smirk on the man’s face grew wider. “Now don’t turn that death glare to
So the next few days, Castiel tried not to stare as much at Dean as he had done before his heat. He did not succeed, but at least every time Dean turned around or glanced up at him, Castiel quickly looked away. Or tried to appear busy with something else.
Neither of the three had said a word since they left Castiel’s room, but for the last two hours, the omega had noticed that both Anna and Balthazar shot him concerned glances every now and then. And he knew why: He was getting tired. As an omega, he possessed neither the same amount of resilience nor strength as the other two. His wolf was a lot smaller, and never before had he needed to perform such an exhausting physical task. It didn’t help that he had hardly been allowed any substantial food for the last couple of weeks.
If Castiel had to guess, he would assume that the young beta in front from him would like to have his own submissive omega at his beck and call. After Dean had handed him the paperwork, he skimmed over the files and finally declared that they had everything they needed.
The omega shook, but his feet started moving before his mind could catch up. He had seldom heard so much force before. He was so shaken with it, he hardly thought about what would happen between Dean and Lucifer now that he was inside the house and up the stairs. He felt humiliated. Knowing that at least Lucifer and Crowley assumed he would be waiting for his punishment right now.
They sat around the table for a while, Sam and Jody joined in later. Everyone laughed and relaxed. Dean was quiet, and Castiel hardly said a word after he had arrived. Dean was holding Garth’s shoulder and the beta leaned into the touch. Castiel felt almost jealous. He wanted Dean to do that to him as well. He didn’t even feel like this was solely a Mate-thing, he had also craved the touch of the Alphas he had hated.
Castiel let go before Dean’s knot could form and slowly crawled up Dean’s body, kissing and nipping at various body parts on the way until he reached the alpha’s lips. When he pulled back again, Dean looked breathless, and Castiel felt smug at the thought that he was responsible for the alpha’s blissed-out expression and the distinctly happy scent surrounding him.
But, truly, alphas never tried to chat him up. On the other hand, usually, Castiel was not alone when he was out on the weekends – and, if they ever noticed them, alphas only sneered at him, the unmated omega. And Jack, his
Maybe that was the reason why Dean was still a little miffed that he had not gotten the chance to fight Lucifer himself. Maybe he had not only wanted to kill an old enemy, but also felt the need to avenge those in his care. Like Castiel, or Sam. Even Jack. Dean was very protective over his wolves. It was something that pleased Castiel as much as it annoyed him sometimes – and he knew quite a few others who shared that feeling. But in the end, no one in the Winchester pack would have Dean any other way.
Castiel held still in his submissive pose and when he could finally feel the alpha’s reeking breath on his throat, the omega turned his head and sank his teeth into Zachariah’s neck. It was just one bite, purposeful and deep. Time seemed to have stopped.
“Of course.” He handed the taller man the knife that he had just started to arrange on his belt again.
The two men left and Castiel helped Gabriel, who had been uncharacteristically quiet throughout the last hour, with the dishes. His brother had tried to wave Castiel off to go to the living room and relax, but the omega needed to do something.
“Yes. Look… Lisa, she is an omega and she has never been mated – and she has a son.” Castiel felt a cold stone in his stomach at the thought. “We already had had a little fling ages ago, when we were both still in school. And then we met again a couple of years ago – when she had a four-year-old and no mate. And we started dating.
The undercover couple walked Benny and Donna to their car and waved them goodbye – putting on a good show for Cain, who was out in the garden with his bees. But when they started to return inside, they were held up by another alpha who suddenly stood in their way. Even though Castiel had never seen him before, he knew it must be their direct neighbour to the right – since it was the only possible explanation of how he could have sneaked up on them from behind.
“He was very sadistic. He knew I didn’t want him and I think that turned him on even more. That I didn’t want him, but I still had to do anything he asked. He… he liked to hear me beg for him and every heat I was filled with something the entire time. When it wasn’t his knot, it was a dildo or a plug or a … bottle. But I was not allowed to come.” Castiel sobbed at that and buried his head in the crook of Dean’s neck while the alpha soothingly ran fingers through his hair. “I would beg and beg since he ordered me to – but he only let me come at the very end. I hardly slept or drank, I never ate. But I had to prepare food for him and while he ate I was to… to
“Cas…” Dean started to protest, but Castiel shut him up with a glare. “Fine. But we have to drive by our place anyway. Can you at least take a quick shower, change your clothes and use that lotion that dulls your omega scent a bit?”
“Like I said, I can wait.” Dean walked to the door, opened it with his elbow and stepped into the corridor. Before he closed it with his foot, he winked at Castiel – who was still lying on the bed with a confused look on his face.
“Believe me, Cas, this is not normal. Don’t forget, I was mated before – and there is no comparison to how I feel today.” Castiel felt bad for reminding his friend of her old mate. Metatron had been neglectful and short-tempered. There was a reason why the two omegas met at a self-help group. Hannah’s mate had just died of a stroke – the death of an alpha was the only way an omega could break a bond. It was still painful and arduous. But Hannah was strong-minded and had preserved. She had started to work again and frankly Castiel had always been envious of how Hannah would still go out and meet with friends, not letting her fear get the best of her.
Castiel did not have the heart to tell him that within twenty-four hours he would be a married man – and then there was nothing left to talk about anymore. He just needed to make sure that Dean would not be allowed near him until then. So he would not cause a scene. Luckily, tonight was supposed to be a private dinner.
Aside from being a vegetarian, Jack was also a big fan of seasonal and regional food. And Castiel fully supported him on that issue – so the Novak-Winchester-household basically added pumpkin to all kinds of meals from September to November.
But even if he claimed his intentions had not changed, the alpha had been reluctant, almost cautious, at first – Castiel did not know how much of it had been because he was still guilt-ridden by Castiel’s assumption he was being owned, or because Dean was simply still angry with him for lying – but by now, Dean was just as attentive as he had been before. The difference was, now Castiel could fully enjoy it.
just a second before a horse had kicked out one of his hindlegs, and would have hit Castiel if he had not, in fact, stepped back at the right time. His Other did not make him timid, it helped him to avoid getting hurt. Or doing something stupid. Castiel did not know how it worked exactly – even if his Second Skin had a conscience, how could it possibly see the future? Or maybe it was just good at reading body language, or had a better eye for his surroundings than Castiel did. Animals were aware of a lot of things humans never noticed.
Castiel had always had a weird obsession with hunting. His books explained that wolves were perfect predators and why not use the skill? Also, food or shared meals held a very powerful symbolism in pack cultures, most of them remnants from the Old Ways. For example, the strongest alpha of the pack would still generally get the first bite. But in the past, lead alphas had mostly been prudent to share their food and care for those who could not hunt themselves – the only thing at Heavensgate that was echoing this tradition was a weekly donation to the poor. Otherwise, Michael had never been too keen to look after all his subjects equally. Castiel had also read that in the Old Ways alphas would hunt down prey and deliver it to their mates to show that they could provide for them. These days, the custom had been twisted: The alpha would still offer their omega mate food – but the act was not caring but simply another sign of superiority. Castiel had mostly eaten in a small group, but whenever he had attended a big feast, he had only been allowed to eat the food Michael had handed him. And of course, lately, he had been constantly reminded that in the future, he was only to eat whatever Zachariah offered him.
, but I will feel a lot better once we are out of Niebo. I can stay upright for a few more hours, and I probably couldn’t sleep here anyway.”
at the same time. The claim on the omega would never vanish afterwards, even though the one on the alpha’s neck would fade away after a few days. But despite the fact that they had not taken that final step yet, Dean would mark Castiel most times during sex – and everyone had gotten used to it. The few times when the mark on Castiel’s neck was so faded it was hardly noticeable, his colleagues often frowned at him or looked surprised. Castiel assumed they all sometimes forgot he and Dean were not actually mated yet. With the constant marking and their mixed scents, it was hardly distinguishable – that had been the whole premise for their undercover operation after all.
Castiel perked up at that. He liked the idea to keep training. He enjoyed the exercise, and he would not feel as useless next to the others. Most treated him respectfully, but Castiel could not stop thinking that they all secretly saw him as some pampered prince. And they were right – that was the worst of it.
At that, Castiel perked up. He had known that Jessica was not Sam’s first mate, but Castiel had not realized that he had been with an alpha before. He had once asked Dean about this, but his mate had only answered with:
With one last moan of “Dean!” Castiel came and fell back, completely limp on the alpha’s bed. His vision had blurred, and he was unable to move for a minute – or thirty, he really didn’t know. When he was able to focus again, the alpha lay next to him, slowly stroking over his chest, tracing invisible patterns, head deeply buried into Castiel’s neck.
Before the three men left, Cole turned around to Dean: “Are we still on with our meeting in…” He looked at his watch. “…about now. I also invited Cesar and Donna.”
“Oh, I can handle Gabriel. I’ll just bring him a bunch of chocolate muffins and he is as tame as a kitten.”
Before he had become the Alpha of his own pack, Dean had never really understood what made omegas quite so special. For him, they had felt like any other wolves – more balanced, yes. But he had thought they were just lucky. But as an Alpha, with a capital A, he had quickly learned that omegas were important for pack safety. Dean not only never had to worry that they might lose control of their wolves. Because they just wouldn’t. But when he had to work on other wolves that were about to break free, Dean could also draw on the omega’s ability to live in peace with their animal side, which automatically grounded everyone around him.
“Oh, Dean-o, I didn’t know I would bring you so much luck.” Gabriel said in a low voice and with half-lidded eyes. “Maybe you should switch from omegas to alphas. You might like it. And I might be willing to show you some good times, you know, you’re not that bad looking.”
Dean was still surprised how satisfied he felt. Years ago, when Sam had started the whole we-are-the-good-wolves campaign, Dean had only agreed hesitantly, and mostly to keep the humans off his back. He would not like to look over his shoulder all the time, and he had cared more about his pack than them. But by now, he was pretty sure he would have run into that building, no matter what reporters would write about it later.
He closed his eyes, listened to the noises inside the house, and felt the new pack bond settle into his bones. For the first time, he did not feel like he wanted to break the strings. On a hunch, Castiel jumped from the bed and to the window. He was looking in the direction of the forest, and Castiel felt tempted to run outside.
Castiel rushed down the corridor, feeling more like dancing than walking, when there was suddenly a firm hand on his arm and he was forcefully pulled to the side.
Castiel twitched, suddenly timid, and Dean pulled his hand away immediately. But then he saw the boyish smile on the Alpha’s face and realised he had only meant to tease him. It wasn’t a reprimand. And there was something else Dean had said that seemed odd.
Castiel was surprised. He had not known that Crowley and Meg had stayed in touch after their own undercover mission. A few minutes later – in which Meg told Castiel about that big case she had worked on in all gory detail – the two omegas said their goodbyes and Castiel joined Dean on the couch in the living room.
“You got it, Cas. We’ll finish early and check the place out as soon as Charlie can give us the address. And we’ll also head to the hospital. See if we can find out whom Uriel had tried to call. Although I have a pretty good idea already.”
Suddenly, Anna’s eyes fixed on something in the distance and she ran a bit faster, Balthazar and Castiel merely trotting behind at this time. She soon returned with a satisfied look in her eyes.
“All the sweet-talk worked like a charm on me. So, I agreed to stay with her – as long as she promised she would not bite me. She did, and I trusted her.
He quickly washed and dressed and then hurried to the dining hall – it was much earlier than he normally came in, and he was surprised at how crowded it was. But at the same time, it was a lot quieter than at dinner – most shifters seemed not completely awake yet.
Today was the anniversary of their wedding as well as the official peace agreement, and the palace had organised some festivities. Right now, Castiel and his Consort were sitting in a theatre with about a hundred other people, only some of them noble, most were commoners. The play was about a prince who met his True Mate in the stables – Castiel was certain that the idea had been proposed to a playwright by his cousin. That was why Castiel shot Gabriel a dirty glare every now and then, but the beta just wiggled his eyebrows at Rowena. Sam, who had visited for the celebrations, clapped Gabriel on the back every now and then, that traitor. But on the outside, Castiel stayed perfectly calm. Few people knew how he had met Dean, even though it was public knowledge that the King of Aniol and his Consort were True Mates. It had sparked quite the excitement when Castiel had married the former king of Winchester instead of his brother. But the official story said that Castiel and Dean had only met at dinner that night. Even though nothing had happened, Castiel would not have enjoyed the gossip once people found out they had been alone in the stables before. He just hoped no one would associate the play with him and his Mate. Castiel sighed. He
Castiel nodded and excused himself. As he walked a little away from the camp, he allowed himself to wallow in self-pity for a moment. He would miss Sam on his journey. But he knew that it was not possible for both Winchesters to leave the capital at the same time, much less the whole kingdom.
“Spit it out, Cas,” Dean said harsher than he had wanted. He was still overwhelmed with feelings of fury and relief. And they were sitting too damn close.
“Uriel committed treason by trying to kill me. I want him to be thrown into the dungeon, heavily guarded, until the day of his trial.”
Gordon bristled again, and looked like he was ready to attack someone. But in the end, he followed Benny outside, with a sneer in Castiel’s direction. Like any of this was his fault.
After many discussions and rearrangements, Castiel found himself squeezed in on a bench between Robert, who was currently yelling at Petra for stealing one of his sweet potatoes from across the table, and Bobby, who watched his namesake with a mixture of fondness and impatience. Castiel himself had a fifteen-month-old girl on his lap. Gabriel, who walked up and down the room, currently rocked her sobbing twin brother, Jack. Castiel would feel guilty if he had not known that Gabriel had deliberately picked
“It’s time for you to officially join us. You’ve done the legwork,” he gestures to the rack, “and now all that’s left is to sign the contract. One more touch from me and you get your very own black eyes, along with the welcome packet and the campus map.”
He and Sam have been patching each other up for decades, and there’s an unspoken understanding about it between them. Pain is inevitable; apologies and platitudes won’t make it go away. They do what needs to be done and leave it at that. It’s been a while since Dean has bothered trying to comfort someone he actually knows, and it’s harder than he remembers. So many of the consoling phrases he could resort to,
“Someone, please help me.” Dean gasps, eyes closed against the onslaught of pain and Alastair’s sharp laugh in his ear. “I’m beggin’ you, someone, please
“Of course I have, man,” Dean reassures him. It’s a lie - he’s reduced dislocated shoulders plenty. Ankles, not so much, but he figures the technique is similar enough. No need to worry Cas any more than necessary.
But if there’s anything Dean knows about his master, it’s that he fights dirty, especially when standing on his own home turf.
“That’s not true,” Cas rumbles, irritation in his voice, and presses long fingers to a spot on Dean’s torso.
The next morning, Dean wakes to discover he is significantly less nauseous. He shifts into a sitting position, bare feet sliding against the carpeted floor, and stretches out his stiff muscles.
Dean steps over another root and jostles the body in his arms as hard as he dares. He’s rewarded with a low moan.
If anyone feels inspired to draw fluffy whumpy fan art for my stories, I will 100% cry tears of joy.
“I never…” Dean sniffs hard, wipes his shirt sleeve under his nose. “I never let myself think that it might be possible he felt that way.” He pulls away to bring his face level with Sam’s. “How did you all know?”
Light bursts into the room. Dean and Alastair are both knocked to the floor in a powerful blast, shielding their eyes from the sudden blinding radiance.
Cas heaves a sigh of relief. “Thank goodness you’re awake.” He gives Dean an exasperated look, like he chose an inconvenient moment to be knocked out. “You’ve been unconscious for nearly ten minutes.”
“I can’t,” Dean mutters. “You’re gonna keep talking because I told you to, and then when I pass out you’re gonna hang on exactly as you are right now, until Sam finds us.”
“Well, I am, for sure,” says Dean. Cas’s eyes flare and he can almost see the light that isn’t there anymore. “Cause I’ve waited so long to say this.”
“No, I’m not buying whatever you’re selling today, thanks.” Dean keeps one hand cradled behind Cas’s head, pressing the slack face into his own shoulder, and rotates the other hand to look at his watch. Shit. Only five minutes remain. “And would you look at that! I’ve got a previous engagement, so if you don’t mind?”
If it was the real ground, he’d have broken his nose for how hard he faceplants. As it stands, he gets a mouthful of shifty dusty darkness, and peers around to see what he tripped on.
The angel appears directly in front of him and presses his fingers to the heads of the goons holding Sam down. They drop like sacks of potatoes, leaving Sam to catch himself against the sticky bar floor.
Cas looks back at him, something like dread on his face. “I feel, Dean. I feel each and every pound of this weight, in my muscles and bones. And I feel...scared, I think.”
Cas steps in and tilts his face til their noses brush and his breath puffs against Dean's lips. "Physical presence, check. Heartbeat, present and accounted for." Dean collapses against him in relief, their foreheads meeting. He slides a thumb up to run along the glowing rainbow resting on Cas's bottom lip.
Sam sighs. It’s been a long week for them. The demon they were after managed to capture a 9-year-old boy, and even though they were able to exorcise the thing and save the host, it had been too late for the child. Dean had stood tall as the mother cried into his arms earlier that evening, but Sam knew it had seriously rattled them both. No one likes losing a kid.
“I don’t wish to embarrass you.” He finally says, eyes still jumping around the room. Cas is less still these days, Dean has noticed. Less marble statue than he was a year ago. He’s begun to pick up tics, like shifting his jaw side to side, or pinching his thumb and pointer fingers over the seam of his sleeve. “It relates to emotions, which I know you generally avoid.”
Cas’s mouth twists. “I was beside you when that horrible witch blew the ceiling to pieces.” A grim satisfaction fills Dean’s stomach. Damn right, even the angel is gonna know how much witches suck. “Thankfully, I was able to block the worst of the falling stones. But then the floor collapsed beneath us as well.” He won't meet Dean’s eye, guilt swarming his features. “It was all I could do to shield your head and torso.”
my brain feelsso muddled, it’s infuriating. And the emotions, the pain, they’re all too much, it's like I'm...drowning.” Cas goes to bury his face in his hands, but Dean grabs his wrists to stop him from pulling at the stitches. Cas rips away. “I don’t want to be some tragic obligation of yours. I don't want your pity, or your help, I don’ want it! I don’t want
A note of fear enters Cas’s tone, his thin breaths going shakier. “If I can’t protect myself, how am I supposed to protect you? W...what am I even doing here?”
Dean thinks bitterly, swallowing past the lump in his throat. “Yeah, I’m lucky I found someone to watch my back. Hint, hint.” Cas doesn't rise to the bait. “Benny has saved my hide on more than one occasion. But truth be told, we’re scrambling. We’re lucky if one of us gets to take a nap every week or so.”
“I was congratulating you. It’s been forty years to the day since my hellhounds dragged you kicking and screaming to my humble abode.” Dean clenches his jaw as Alastair gestures at the bloodstained dungeon. “And nearly a decade since you joined the staff. Do you know what that means?” Dean doesn’t trust himself to speak. “That means it’s basically your tenth birthday, little boy.”
Dean tapes another gauze patch over the last of the open wound. The blood has mostly stopped flowing, and he can finish stitching in the morning. Cas has had enough pain for one day. They’ve both earned some rest.
to be here. It will mean accepting that Cas is only a temporary addition to the team, and will eventually realize there are better options out there. Dean can’t handle that thought right now, so he doesn’t try.
Cas, inhibitions drained out with half his blood volume, places a hand over Dean’s heart. “I used to be able to heal you with a touch. I had the power of Heaven at my fingertips. Now I can’t hunt a measly ghost without-” Cas spits out a little blood into his cupped palm.
Dean focuses on the heads, specifically the light fanning out above them. It’s like an optical illusion, where he can tell there’s a picture there but can only see it from the exact right angle.
“Wait, how did you even know to come help me?” Dean notices with a start. “I couldn’t remember anything but Hell, there’s no way I dream-dialed you.”
“Alright,” Dean mutters, and tunes his ears into the song beginning to play. A finger-plucked banjo starts to arpeggio some basic chords, followed by a few piano riffs. The tempo is nice and easy, with a swing of syncopation. The sound quality is so crackly, Dean is sure if he turns to look at the speaker it will have transformed into a hand-cranked radio.
Cas refuses to hunt with them. Once they ease back into it, he makes it clear that he’s only interested in the research side of things. He dances around the subject for a while before admitting that being out in the field in his "current state" (yes, air quotes included) won’t end well. They don’t push him. Sam is ecstatic to have another nerd on the team, a partner with whom to pore over dusty tomes and obscure lore. Dean mocks them, but feels grateful to be off book duty while his brother and their not-quite-angel dig up all the info they need.
Dean’s eyes close and Sam can practically see the horrible pictures projected onto the inside of his brother’s eyelids.
Dean hasn’t heard from Cas in a few weeks. It’s understandable, given the fact that he’s been running from his douchey angel brethren since he rebelled and Lucifer walked free. He’s also new to the whole “cell phone” thing. When Dean had gifted it to him and programmed in his number, Cas had done that birdlike head tilt as if he didn’t understand its purpose, so it is possible he just doesn’t know how to send a text message.
Tomorrow morning, Sam will arrive with the rare book he has been tracking down. He’ll walk in and see Dean cradling Cas’s bruised body, spooning him with an arm around his waist and lips pressed to the top of his spine. Sam will tease his brother mercilessly, whisper-chanting
“Don’t be sorry, man.” Sam shakes his head. “You wiped yourself out to save our asses, we should be the ones apologizing to you.”
After a moment’s silence, Sam exhales loudly. “It must hurt. You were holding up a lot of weight there.”
Today, Alastair wears a gaunt, stubbled face with yellowing teeth. Here in Hell where the demon wields such power, his form changes daily. Sometimes mid sentence. Only inches from Dean’s nose, today’s horror show twitches with mercurial energy, features morphing from one disturbing face to another. Dean stares unblinking at the one trademark that remains unchanged - the pitch black stygian eyes.
Dean can hear the hitch in Cas’s rough voice, and realizes with a start that he has let his eyes sink closed. “Why?”
On the nightstand sits a full glass of water, a box of saltines, and a bottle of Pepto Bismol. Behind that lies a small glint of silver. Curious, Dean holds it up to the light streaming through the window.
“Yes, baby, you’re getting it now,” Alastair snarls as he sees panic overtake Dean. “No one is coming to get you. It’s just you and me down here, forever. Doesn’t that sound fun?”
Dean looks over to see Castiel’s hand mimicking the same motions, Casa Erotica forgotten as he watches Dean. So Dean does what he’d do next if he was alone - unbuttons his jeans again, just to give himself a little more freedom. He doesn’t pull his dick out - not just yet, but Cas follows suit pretty quickly, finding the button on his slacks and pushing his hand inside.
Dean hasn’t been alone on his own in awhile - not truly alone, without Sam fiddling at his computer next to him or pretending to sleep. The weight of the world is on his shoulders, again, because apparently stopping the apocalypse just wasn’t enough for one man. Of course not.
They sit there for a few moments, the heat fading away and Dean finally manages to reach for the remote to turn the television off entirely. Castiel doesn’t entirely seem himself, but an orgasm can do that to a person - and Dean doesn’t really know how to broach the pillow talk that comes after jerking off with your friend.
and not bothering to think about the ramifications that Dean’s going to have to sit with afterwards.
