"Fuck sake, Gabe." Dean swore. Cas giggled and hid his face in Dean's neck.
"Oh, of course. If that would make you more comfortable." Castiel nodded shyly. "Ok, let's go."
"Now that everyone is here." John started, "The matter at hand." John gestured to the Omega sat in the head chair.
"He's not pregnant?" Dean asked worriedly, his voice breaking slightly. Cas' eyes widened at the thought and he gripped Dean's hand tighter.
"What's up?" Dean asked.
"How about egg and sausage
"Dean." Cas moaned softly, still moving back into Dean's thrusts.
"I will when you calm down." Dean responded calmly, standing from beside Castiel. He laid his hand on Castiel's shoulder before he moved back to his seat and gathered Castiel's belongings to put them in the satchel.
"I beg to differ, it's unfair to make such assumptions when you don't know me." Castiel interrupted harshly. Sam recoiled in shock at the difference between the way Castiel addressed them. "Just because my father and my brothers have a preconceived ideal about your kingdom does not mean that I share that notion. And I would appreciate if you came to know me before making the same judgement of my character as my family has done so of yours, which clearly you don't take too kindly to. Yes, I have been told horror stories of your kingdom but I have been brought here without knowledge of where I was being lead and have allowed my experiences with Alpha and his men to guide my judgments rather than letting my father's history of hatred towards you cloud my views." Dean smirked at his brother as Castiel ranted, enjoying the shock on Sam's face.
"Are you alright Dean?" Asked the younger Winchester when the waitress left. Dean looked at his baby brother with furrowed eyebrows.
"No-one ever believed us." Dean repeated louder. "We always told people that Golden Bonnie took Jimmy and Eli but no-one ever believed us."
"Papa." Dean answered honestly, he couldn't see any other way around it. Cas looked at Dean, wide eyed and surprised.
When they returned home, everyone gathered in the living room. Levi was toddling around happily with his otter in one hand and Cas' bee in the other. Cas was making everyone dinner, watching Levi with a small smile.
"Deanie!" Cas exclaimed excitedly. To the surprise of Gabriel and Sam, Dean's face split into a wide grin and he quickly scooped the toddler into his arms. Said toddler squealed in delight and giggled into the now teenager's neck. Without hesitation, Dean strode over to Sam's bag and pulled out two of the hair ties the younger Winchester kept there before taking a seat at the table with Cas on his knee. Sam and Gabriel exchanged worried looks and joined them at the table both staying quiet as they watched Dean tie Cas' hair up in high bunches.
"Gabriel! Language." Cas reprimanded.
"Look, Daddy! I you!" Levi shouted. Dean turned at the sound of his son's voice and smiled, he set down his beer then took Levi from Cas to stand him on the counter. "Papa dress me like Daddy." Levi announced proudly. Dean grinned at the boy and looked up at Cas.
"Cas, did your dad know where Jimmy had gone?!" Dan asked desperately. Cas shook his head and closed his eyes, trying to hold back tears.
Cas sighed to himself and turned back to the cafe. He could feel that whatever was going on was much bigger than it seemed, it could badly affect a lot of people. But he also felt that they needed to be the ones to figure it out.
"He's a psychopath." Dean reasoned. Cas shrugged and smiled up at him. He placed a hand on her head and she hid her face in his stomach.
"Come on, princess, we climbed through a window so you wouldn't have to, you can hop the fence." Dean said. Cas scowled halfheartedly, his cheeks flushing delicately.
"What?" Dean asked, his voice low. Cas scurried to Sam's side and John removed his arms from around his wife.
"Ok, let's get this party started." Dean said. He picked up a squishy present and looked at the tag. "Levi, this is for you, from granny and grandpa." Levi kicked his feet excitedly and took the present. He ripped into the paper and squealed when he saw the Stitch plush toy.
"Oh hi, Cas, was it?" A high pitched voice interrupted the fond moment between the family. Cas stopped recording and put his phone away once more so that he could address the new comer.
"Hey, Mark stand here." Cas muttered pointing at his feet. He continued past the corner, following the lip until he came across another corner. "Dean stand here." Then he carried on. "Phil stand here." He ignored the lip after the third corner, instead he went back to where Mark was stood to follow the lip from there. "Dan stand here." Then he stood back and his eyes widened. Mark and Dan and Phil and Dean were stood about a foot and a half to two feet away from each other while Dan and Phil and Dean and Mark were about 5 feet apart.
"Yeah, just need to grab my duffle then I'm good to go." Dean said.
"Yeah." Dean frowned again and turned his gaze to the floor.
Cas didn't talk too much in the week after what happened, but Dean didn't blame him. He let the angel handle the situation however he wanted to, he was just happy that Cas didn't completely collapse into himself, he let Dean be affectionate towards him and returned his affections, he was the same with Levi. He was the same loving Cas, he just didn't talk as much. And Dean was ok with that because he still had his angel.
"Forgive, buggy, not forget." Cas corrected with a smile. Levi repeated the word then his sentence.
"Unca Sammy say it good I come to him, he said you do adult things so it good that I not go in." Levi said. "What this, Daddy?" Dean frowned and hissed quietly when Levi pushed down. "Look like teeths." Dean stuttered and looked over to Cas for help but the angel was just as speechless. "A monster?!" Levi panicked when neither of his parents gave him an answer.
"Sit." Castiel turned to the voice and froze. Fenrir hadn't answered his hopes. The Head Alpha wasn't Samuel Winchester. It was, in fact, Dean Winchester. But Castiel couldn't help but to swoon at the sight of him; his bright green eyes had translated into his human form, his hair was cropped at the sides but longer and styled on top. He too was completely naked but Castiel was so glad that he was because Dean's thick, defined muscles were on show and Castiel could see his softer stomach and that the man was extremely well-endowed. Castiel didn't know he craved such a thing until he saw the alpha's long, thick cock hanging between Dean's legs. Castiel whined slightly before shifting himself. He made sure to keep his eyes on the floor and exposed his neck slightly to appease the alpha. "Cole, go and find Sam. Tell him to haul ass down here, and with clothes for me. Don't go telling the elders yet."
"Afton Robotics..." She read, pointing to the copyright claim in the bottom left hand corner.
"Cas is having a baby." Sam replied without taking his eyes off of Cas. Pain ripped through Cas' stomach and he desperately grasped Sam's hand.
"That's not what I meant." Dean shook his head. "I meant, Levi is younger and so needs me more than Ben does. Ben has lived for six years without me."
"Then we can have some fun." Cas struggled against the bindings desperately. Zaqiel, Samyaza and Sandalphon stepped back, their graces not allowing them to physically harm another living thing. Gadreel looked at Cas' tear streaked face and backed up too. Shateiel stepped up with a piece of cloth in his hands, he stepped behind Cas and shoved the cloth in her mouth then he tied it around the back of her head. He then stepped back with the others. Gadreel was the only angel not grinning sinisterly at the younger angel rather he looked remorseful but he did nothing to stop Sathariel leaning down to whisper in Cas' ear.
"I suppose you are here about the deaths." He asked solemnly. Dean raised an eyebrow.
"Yes honey?" Cas asked.
"No I'm here with our older brothers." The lie rolled off of Dean's tongue naturally. Cas tilted her head in confusion but said nothing, understanding that they had to lie.
"Rough path in your relationship?" She questioned. Cas smiled sadly.
"I think we're going to find them." Cas commented after a moment of them watching their elders silently. Dan's head snapped towards Cas in surprise.
"May I know your names?" Michael asked politely once he was seated.
"Cas, is the house ready for a storm?" Mark asked.
It didn't take the long to buy each other presents and soon they were all carrying bags, now they were just wandering around waiting for Dean to finish.
"Levi, go play in your room for a bit." Dean ordered gently. Levi immediately ran up to his room. Dean followed his son up the stairs but went to his and Cas' room to lay Cas on their bed.
"Levi, I have been telling you all day, Daddy and your uncle's are at home." Cas answered with a frustrated sigh. Levi pouted again and crossed his arms over his chest. "Here you go." Cas said laying a plate of food in front of the toddler. Levi huffed and turned his nose up at the food. "Stubborn boy, just like your daddy." Cas murmured with a fond smile. Eventually, Levi began to eat. Cas smiled at his son and picked up his phone.
"I will stay out of the way while you speak." Castiel explained simply.
Levi sing-songed as he did every morning. Dean dropped his head back onto his pillow while Cas giggled above him.
"How are my angels?" Dean murmured fondly. Cas smiled at the hunter and continued playing with Levi. Dean laid his hand on the back of Cas' neck and gently stroked his thumb over Cas' skin.
"Was everything ok?" Dan asked as they shut the door behind them. "We saw you run out of there real fast." A distant flash of lightening lit up the room before a rumble of thunder followed.
"But your son was having nightmares, Dean, he should be higher up in your priorities." Cas retorted quietly. Dean took a deep breath and pinched the bridge of his nose. Behind them, Mary's jaw had clenched and John was trying to calm her down. Sam recognised the clenched jaw, she was about to blow.
"It's by the door in my room but be quiet 'cause Levi is asleep in there." Sam nodded, patting the back of the sofa. Dean stood up and made his way to the garage to check the Impala before returning to the house.
"That would be great, baby, thank you." Dean murmured. He held Cas' chin gently between his thumb and index finger and guided the angel into a soft kiss. "I'll text you to let you know where we are."
"I didn't even resist that much. It was so much like Dean that I didn't even want it to stop, I figured if I couldn't have Dean then it would be the last time I'd feel it but then I felt so bad hence..." Cas said gesturing to the sick covering his shoulder and side. Sam pulled Cas into another hug.
“He wanted some book for a case he found.” Dean said. Levi looked up at Dean from his book and frowned.
"Finally you're awake." Said a voice from the darkness. Cas squinted in an attempt to see who was approaching.
"I'd like to check my father's office now." Cas said to Dean softly. Dean looked into Cas' eyes and saw the fear there.
"I could but your son and your brother need breakfast and I need to feed your appetite too." Cas moaned quietly as Dean sucked a mark into his neck.
"Thank you, Ezra." Chuck said. His father said nothing to him as Cas tentatively sat down in Chuck's reading chair. Ezra, the beta servant, softly shut the door behind him and left the two alone. "Castiel, what in Fenrir's name gave you the idea that leaving castle grounds without a guard was safe?"
"Is there something you want to say?" Dean took a breath then shrugged.
"I'll go find you some clothes, you two go get underwear." Sam said awkwardly.
"The Omega is clearly a spy, he's going to report back to his family. They'll plan an attack." Rufus rambled.
"Funtime Freddy has a child size space in his torso." Phil noticed.
They left the main building through a side door and headed towards a small one storey building off the property. Everyone baring their necks to their Head Alpha still bemused Castiel but he was coming to terms with it, his father had always told him that he adjusted to changes quickly.
"Sam?!" Cas exclaimed as the younger Winchester cautiously dropped his unconscious brother on the armchair. "What happened?" He noticed that Sam had a bloody nose and his shirt was in ribbons and bloody too, but the blood on his torso was dried. He hesitantly turned his eyes to the father of his child and his heart dropped; Dean's cheek was split open, he had a cut on his forehead and his lip was cut too, his arm seemed to be broken, along with his hip and multiple ribs, his chest was covered in deep cuts and the arm that wasn't broken was slashed to the bone in some places, there was a small cut on his neck and his breathing was incredibly shallow.
Castiel smiled sadly but stroked a gentle hand over the smallest pup's fur.
"I'm fine, Sammy. Why?" He answered without a glance to the woman placing their coffees on the table in front of them.
"One thing at a time, Sammy." Sam shook his head and glanced at the omega. Dean gazed at the omega for a moment then his eyes slid to the satchel.
"Oh yeah, the siren." Sam said. "The sirens appear as what the victim desires the most. Do you remember what could kill it?"
"Yeah." He admitted reluctantly. Cas smiled as he watched Dean kneel down in front of his chair and pulled Cas' shirt up.
"How long do we have to sit here, Levi?" Dean asked. Levi hesitated, he knew that when he was naughty his parents said that he had to sit with his hands on his head for 2 minutes but his parents were older. He looked to his Uncle Sam for help. Sam raised three fingers.
"Alpha..." Castiel said quietly, just loud enough to get Dean's attention. "Would you mind putting some pants on?" He asked nervously when Dean hummed.
"Can you help me, Levi?" Sam asked, setting the present on his lap. Levi smiled up at his uncle but turned to his parents, who nodded. Sam and Levi opened the present. "Yes! Thanks Dean." Sam exclaimed, revealing the Game of Thrones boxset.
"Is he ok?" Sam asked.
"Stop!" Phil barked before either of them could say anything more. They all jumped at the unexpected shout and shrunk back into themselves. "Cas, Dan is right, there was no reason to snap at Dean, I didn't believe you when you said that the animatronics had moved, none of us did. It was hard to believe and we didn't look straight away because we were focusing on Golden Bonnie." Cas opened his mouth to protest but Phil raised his hand to stop him. "I know you're scared, we are all scared, but that is no excuse to snap at each other. In our situation, we need to be working together, not at each others throats. Any anger you have about this situation, direct it at the man who took you brother rather than your family, who are helping you find him." Cas looked down at his hands, feeling ashamed and thoroughly scolded.
If Dean hadn't have see it happen himself, he wouldn't have believed it.
Cas' Promise Ring- http://newpromiserings.com/product/black-gold-plated-infinity-promise-ring-women/
"I Levi!" He exclaimed happily. Dean smirked and glanced up at his parents. All of their eyes were soft as they watched the boy, it had been decades since any of them had been around a child.
"I am aware of the prejudices I face." Castiel said simply. The family stayed quiet as their dinner was placed in front of them.
"That was a long time ago." Cas argued. Gabriel laughed.
"It's like we've switched places, switched mindsets. Even since you've had more hope about Eli and Jimmy, I've had so many doubts and fears about them." Dan trembled. Cas laid his hand on Dan's knee comfortingly. "Like I still believe their alive, with everything I have, but... What if we do find them alive?"
"Papa!" Levi exclaimed excitedly. Cas gave the toddler his wide, gummy smile then leant forward to rub their noses together affectionately. Dean watched them fondly for a second as the water boiled. "You back, papa," Levi mumbled, looking into his father's deep blues, "Daddy say we be happy now."
"Good morning, Omega Prince." Said a soft voice, rousing him from sleep. Castiel whined and pulled himself up. "Alpha Prince Michael is expecting you for breakfast." The omega servant commented. Castiel looked at her through half closed eyes and tilted his head.
"How's breakfast coming along?" Dean asked, leaning against the wall. Sam and Cas stopped immediately and Gabriel's smile slipped away. Cas' wide, happy smile completely fell and was replaced with resigned sadness.
"Dean, what a nice surprise." A brunette omega greeted the Alpha with a bright smile. "You weren't scheduled for a visit today." Dean's eyebrows furrowed slightly as he stood, rocking on his feet as the pups clutched at his legs.
Mentions of abortion. Don't worry, paternity tests happen quickly. Lots of cuts, sorry.
Castiel stayed at the Remembrance Ball for his required two hours before he hurried to his bedroom to prepare for his great escape.
"That." Levi said, pointing towards the swings. Dean pulled Levi into his arms then wandered over to the baby swings. Dean put Levi in the swing as Cas joined them then gave the boy a gentle push. Levi giggled excitedly and kicked his legs. Cas pulled out his phone with a smile to take a video. "Higher, Daddy." Levi squealed, Dean laughed at the boy and pushed the boy harder so that the swing would go higher. Dean let the boy swing until it stopped so that the boy could get his breath back. "Papa?" Levi asked once his heart had calmed down. Cas smiled at his phone then pocketed it so he could answer his son.
"Dean, we don't know what's in there. We don't know what the siren put in there to keep us away from Cas." Sam stressed. Dean looked between the building and his brother before relaxing in his brother's hold. Sam lead Dean back to the Impala. They loaded themselves with everything they needed then made their way back towards the building. They crept down the halls for a while with no real direction, the building was so much bigger than the front suggested. Eventually, the halls opened up to, what looked like, a living room. Sam turned quickly upon hearing Dean retching behind him. "Dean?" Dean waved him off and pointed at the floor. Sam followed Dean's gaze and covered his mouth. There on the floor was a pile of clothes, skin and hair.
"God, if you can believe it." John said with a laugh. They all sat down around the coffee table.
"Zachariah." He whispered. Dean let out a rumbling growl and ran a hand over his face.
"Mornin' beautiful." Dean greeted. Cas rubbed his cheek against Dean's chest before jumping back and sitting on his feet with his hands on his knee. Dean frowned at the worry in the angel's eyes and the quick movement, he propped himself up on his elbows, managing to dampen the wince of pain.
"What did you find?" Phil asked, cupping his hands around his mug. Charlie glanced around the cafe, the quiet clinking of cutlery and cups was consistent enough for their conversation to continue provided that their voices were low.
"Maybe it's the same person that had opened the window in the first place?" Phil guessed. Dean hummed.
"Hey beautiful." Dean greeted sleepily, his voice raspy from sleep. Cas gave the man a fond smile and stroked his hand over Dean's cheek.
"Lilo!" He exclaimed. He tugged the box to his chest with his Stitch toy. "Thank Unca Bobby." Cas looked at Levi fondly, then his eyes flicked up to Dean. Dean went to pick up a box from further underneath the tree but was stopped by Mary.
"You're scaring Levi." Cas said softly, he kept his eyes on Levi and tried to keep his own fear out of his voice. He may be an angel, a warrior, but that always seemed to be inane when it came to Sam and Dean. Dean sighed deeply and ran his hand down his face.
"Keep that faith, Sammy." Cas murmured with a sad smile. They fell into another sad silence, not daring to look at each other. The waitress cleared away their plates quickly and hurried away without a word.
"Gabriel, as much as I would love to simply go for a run, you know what I truly want if not to stay at home all day." He said. Chuck leant back in his chair and sighed.
Cas was laying on his stomach; his hands buried beneath his pillow, his face partially hidden by his arm, the blanket had slipped down to his shins in the night exposing his body, one knee was slightly bent. Dean smiled fondly at the man and approached the bed. He gently laid Levi in front of Cas, where the boy quickly cuddled up to the angel, then he laid behind him. Dean let his eyes trail the lines of Cas' body, how the borrowed shirt had ridden up in his sleep, the curve of his ass covered in the panties that they'd bought when Cas had been a girl, that image alone had heat stirring between Dean's legs. He shook away those thoughts away and leant over Cas' body, propping his arm up on the other side of Levi. He pressed gentle kisses over Cas' neck and jaw.
"I do want this baby if it's yours, Dean." Cas said lowly. He looked into Dean's eyes, his cheeks still tear stained and his eyes were red but his eyes held sincerity and hope.
"Ok, it's ok, Cassie. We're here. Levi needs you to concentrate on your grace and help him detach, ok? Can you do that for him?" Gabriel asked softly. Tears collected in Cas' eyes as the pain intensified.
Trigger Warning (Specifics in End Notes) Serious comment included
"But where-?" Sam started but he was promptly shushed by Dean. "What...?"
"Stay here, Eli. I gotta ask Daddy if he's seen Jimmy." Cas said to his brother after plonking the little boy on the bench seat. Eli nodded once which made Cas smile softly, he kissed his brothers forehead then turned to the wooden door by their table. Cas tentatively knocked on his father's office door and waited patiently for his father to answer.
It was as though his mind was constantly listening for the soft 'hello Dean' that his nurse always greeted him with. The nurse's voice was nice and gravely, and Dean knew he was unusually attracted to his nurse.
"You don't need to hate your brother, Sam. It was stupid for me to believe that he would feel the same after Gabriel restored me to my original form, I'm just happy that he's accepted Levi as his son." Cas answered. Sam shook his head in disagreement but said nothing. It wasn't long before everything was packed.
"Pretty, Papa." Levi said, leaning over the arm of the chair to look at the amulet.
"Hello Dean, I got the job." Cas said proudly. Dean chuckled down the line.
"I don't know why you insist on wanting to go outside the gates, it's a mess beyond the kingdom's limits." Michael commented, taking his drink from a servant, Ion.
"There is no way that your baby is fathered by the man that assaulted you. It's definitely Dean's." Dr Ottoway confirmed happily. Cas released a sob of relief and finally let his hand fall to his stomach. "Do you have medical plans in place for the pregnancy and birth or do we need to sort that out for you?"
"If... If I tell you, you have to promise that you won't interrupt me until I'm finished... and that you won't shout at me." Cas stated, glancing up at Dean shyly, "At least not in front of Levi." Dean frowned at that. Shout at him?
“I missed you too, love bug. Were you good for Daddy?” Cas asked. Dean smiled fondly at the sight and laid his hand on Levi’s back. Levi nodded enthusiastically and grinned back at Dean.
"I agree that the deaths reflect the elements but all of The Elemental's apprentices died in the great flood." Gabriel muttered as he furrowed his eyebrows in thought.
"No, I asked Maria for the day off." Cas' heart fluttered at the charming grin he received from Dean.
"Hey, hey baby, it's me." Dean said, his tone hurried and concerned. Cas choked out a relieved sob and cried into the floor. He felt Dean pull his pants and panties back up then he pulled him into his arms. "You're safe, I've got you. You're safe." Dean promised. Cas relaxed into Dean's hold, he felt safe.
"I forget you, Daddy." Levi murmured. Cas and Dean laughed softly at the boy's mistake.
"What is it?" Charlie asked, trying to see what Cas was seeing.
"Don't worry, if you want to keep it at this length then I can style it before a hunt." Sam said with a brotherly smile. Dean turned to Sam with an incredulous smile.
"He left again after 20 minutes." Charlie explained quickly before returning to her conversation with Mark and Phil about some video game. Dan was curled up between Phil and Charlie, his head resting on Phil's thigh and his feet in Charlie's lap.
"I think we could set everything up on the kitchen island. But I need to get my equipment from my house." Charlie decided. Dean and Phil had a silent conversation then turned to the group.
"We go in Honey?" Levi asked with a head tilt. Dean shook his head sadly, then turned to press a kiss to Cas' neck before pulling away.
"Of course not, honey." Mary said sweetly. Dean smiled at his mother then gently lead Cas towards the bunker's door.
"Did he make you say that?" He asked angrily, pointing over to the angel. Dean clenched his fist and looked at Lisa, who shrugged.
"Your coffee." Cas remembered, reaching out to the empty cup. Dean chuckled and pressed a lasting kiss to Cas' temple.
"Change them back." Gabriel demanded angrily. No matter what powers Aether now held, he was once human and for a human to show such disrespect towards an archangel was blasphemous. Aether laughed.
"What?" Dean asked.
"What was he like as a fledgling?" Dean asked with childlike fascination. Gabriel grinned and leant forward.
"No, you're not teaching Levi your bad habits." Cas answered after a moment. Dean chuckled and slid his hand from Cas' wrist to the beer clasped in his hand, he eased it away from Cas and set it down on the shelf in the fridge before slipping their hands together. He leant forward to close the gap between them. Cas' lips fell apart naturally before Dean's met his, Dean sighed happily when he felt Cas' parted lips and eagerly pulled the angel closer. Cas lifted his free hand up to grasp at Dean's hair, responding to Dean's tongue meeting his with a breathy moan. Dean pulled back slowly, ending their deep kiss with gentle pecks. He pressed their foreheads together and smiled softly.
"Daddy, come help me please." Levi called out from the climbing frame. Dean kissed Cas' temple then joined his son. "Catch me, Daddy!" Levi exclaimed from one of the higher tiers of the climbing frame. Dean positioned himself under the boy, his heart beating fast. Levi jumped off the frame and into Dean's waiting arms with a joyful squeal. Dean gave a low chuckle when Levi landed in his arms, holding him close. Behind them, Cas tugged his phone out of his pocket again so he could record them as Dean flipped Levi over and held the small boy over his head, his big hands holding Levi by the waist, then began to run around. Cas' heart clenched when he realised what Dean was doing. He was letting Levi fly.
"Shapeshifter?" Cas interjected.
" Cas heard muttering away from the phone and the distant answer Dean gave. "
"No, the reason these witches are so powerful is because they harness the power of nature, which is the strongest form of power on Earth. It's destructive and merciless yet loving and accommodating. However, Aether took the essence of a tsunami, an earthquake, a volcanic eruption and a storm to make himself The Elemental; him taking the essence of natural disasters meant that his powers would be predominantly destructive and his intentions were to be as such. Should he be caught in any one of the disasters he strives to control then he, as the exploiter of such power, will perish. Which is why his students met their demise when faced with the flood." Gabriel told them. The conversation turned to Gabriel's resurrection when Sam decided he should look into The Elemental.
"I know, but this may be my only chance to see out there." Castiel sighed. He knew how crazy, how life-threatening, his plan was. Gadreel rubbed his forehead in thought and leant back in his chair.
"We should get you two some clothes while we look for Aether." Sam reasoned. Dean placed a gentle hand on Cas' head and nodded in answer. Gabriel smiled at the pair and rose out of his seat.
"Papa?" Levi asked as Cas sat next to him on the couch. The boy looked over the back of the couch at Dean then laid against Cas. "I get a brother?"
"So I see that you're wanting a paternity test." Dr Ottoway read from his file. "Can I ask why?"
"What?" Dean asked confused.
"Big plans for that fish." Cas finished.
"And Cas knows if they look right or not." Mark said definitively. The parents looked at each other, concern was starting to show in their eyes. Their children genuinely seemed to be worried that James and Elijah were missing and they rarely messed around if real concern could be raised.
"Why are they acting so normal about this?" Dean inquired once the elevator doors had closed.
"Are all of your phones charged?" Phil asked. Everyone checked then nodded. "Ok, Cas were do you want us?"
"I'm sure I'll be seeing you again soon." Castiel said soothingly. He rose to his feet and shyly curled his hand around Dean's forearm. Dean walked through the room, smiling as the crowd of pups followed behind them slowly.
"Y'all ok now?" Daryl asked after a second. Dean looked at him and nodded with a grateful smile. "I'm gon' get gone. 'm glad yer ok, Cas." Daryl murmured then stood up.
"Hey, Dean, do you have a minute?" John asked as he emerged from the Bunker.
"You and Dan only got back a year ago?" Cas questioned, realising what had bothered him earlier.
"Levi, uncle Sam is coming to pick you up." Cas said softly after kneeling next to Levi. The little boy perked up at the mention of Sam.
"Wapples?" Levi asked quietly. Dean chuckled and carried Levi to the table where the boy's waffles were sat. Cas stood at the counter watching Levi eat as Dean joined him and wrapped his arms around the angel's waist.
"Ok then. You need to drop the attitude, your Papa only asked you to put your coat on. You get one warning when we go out, if you misbehave after the warning then I am bringing you straight back home, you understand me?" Dean asked. Levi nodded. "I said do you understand me?"
"I just broke up for summer last month." Charlie added. Cas raised his eyebrows in shock, but he was proud, he wasn't that surprised that Charlie had started college a year early.
"Dean?" Cas murmured.
"Because I don't want to and you two 'have a more profound bond'." Sam answered then turned and walked to the women section of the store.
"So, we've got 8 months left to go until we meet baby Winchester number 2." Dean commented with a grin. Cas giggled and rested his head on Dean's chest.
"Yeah." Cas moaned, letting Dean pull his head back a bit. Dean groaned then brought Cas into a passionate kiss as he re-positioned himself at Cas' hole. "Please, Dean, I want you, I want it hard, I want to feel it tomorrow." Dean straightened up as he pushed into Cas' open hole again, gripping tightly onto Cas' waist. Dean could feel Cas quivering beneath him and bit his lip at the sight.
"Cassie, can you take Levi to his room?" Gabriel asked calmly. Cas stuttered his breaths but he couldn't calm down.
"No, Dean, please." Dean chuckled and quickly pressed a kiss to Cas' lips.
"Levi, do you know why Papa didn't come home with you?" He asked after a moment of silence. Levi looked down at his dad and frowned. Why were both of his father's sad?
"After you told me that you and Dean were sad about missing out having normal pregnancy experiences, I gave you the ability to have a normal pregnancy." Gabriel explained. Cas dropped his head into his hands and sobbed.
"Cas, our present for you is in the back of the yard." Mary interjected before Dean could move on. Cas gave Mary his signature head tilt.
"Holy shi- you are a very lucky man." She muttered as she looked at the picture.
. I think that he is still in denial about his love for male Cas because of our dad but I'm worried about what it'll do to Cas if Dean goes back to his bachelor ways after you turn him back to normal." Sam said softly. Gabriel nodded and looked away thoughtfully. Sam continued with his research for a few hours while Dean worked out. Eventually Dean appeared in the library, shirtless and sweaty. Dean was looking over Sam's shoulder when Cas rushed into the bunker. Dean looked up to as what was wrong but stopped short upon seeing her. She was dripping wet after taking a shower and only had a small towel wrapped around her waist while she held her chest in her arms. Sam looked up at her unaffected and Gabriel wore a small, smug smile.
"What? Cas what the fuck?!" Dean demanded. He was the only one who hadn't noticed a difference in Cas, he didn't know there was something wrong with Cas. He didn't know what was happening.
Levi cheered and a pleased smile made its way onto Cas' lips.
"I know, but they could be." Sam retorted defiantly. Cas huffed humourlessly.
It was then that he stopped.
"Dean, why are you acting like this towards Cas?" Mary asked. Dean simply shrugged, he didn't know how to word his feelings, he never knew how to.
Gabriel started.
"I'm fine, I'm a little sore but I'll live. As for Levi, why don't you ask him yourself." Cas asked with a small smirk, he gestured to the archangel behind Sam. Sam turned, only now noticing the older angel. Levi turned his head to glance shyly at the tall hunter. It took the toddler a minute to recognise the younger Winchester but when he did, he threw himself into the others arms.
"I don't mean Leo." Lisa sighed.
"We go town?" He asked. Dean nodded and turned his gaze towards Cas.
"Yeah." Dean replied with no elaboration. Cas sighed softly, reaching up to take Dean's hand and guiding him to take a seat next to him.
"Levi, swallow first." Dean grumbled against Cas' lips. A small smile set on his face when he heard Cas giggle and he moved to press kisses to Cas' neck so that he could answer Levi.
"I let another touch me." Cas whispered, so quietly that Sam had to strain to hear it. Sam frowned and wrapped his arm around the angel's shoulders.
"Don't apologise for great sex, beautiful." Dean murmured with a smirk. Cas blushed and fell forward into Dean's waiting arms. The older Winchester chuckled while the younger watched them with a smile.
"Look Papa, me tall." Levi called over to Cas. Dean chuckled at the boy. Cas nodded and reached over to ruffle Levi's hair up. They wandered up and down the aisles, placing things in their cart as they went, Levi happily babbling to his fathers and himself.
"The gate is locked too, genius, now hop over the damn fence." Dean countered. He gave the younger boy a cheeky grin which caused Cas to stick his tongue out at the boy.
The inside of the restaurant was dark in comparison to the sunny outside, the only light was from the fire exit and the beams of their torches. It was warm outside but once the boys crossed the threshold of the building they were hit with ice cold air.
"I figured you'd want to watch them after you finished the books." Dean explained, his eyes shining. Sam grinned at his older brother then turned his attention to the box.
"Papa make egg and sausage." Levi said. Dean nodded and headed to the fridge.
"Morning, sunshine, we're meeting everyone for breakfast in 20 minutes." Dean greeted with a grin.
"She's with the shifting." She answered reluctantly. Dean nodded his thanks.
"Want Daddy." Was the quiet response.
"She slept in it last night and didn't want to take it off this morning." Dean lied, he'd already planned his answer before they left the car.
Dean piped up.
"Good morning, Sam, breakfast is nearly ready." Cas answered. He too was cleverly ignoring something but it wasn't going too well as the something was Dean kissing his neck and it was getting distracting. "Dean." He muttered as the hunter took hold of his hips.
"No, I mean they literally shouldn't be able to move off the stage, they're bolted to the tracks like in my room." Cas insisted.
"We should get going then." Cas smiled. They drove to the cafe in their own cars, pulling in on either side of Phil's car.
"He'll start aging one year after he was born. You won't have missed that much, if you're worried he won't be influenced by you then that won't be an issue." Cas reasoned.
"For fuck sake, Cas, can't you a least be a little optimist?! You have no proof that Eli and Jimmy are dead. These kids were the ones your dad was talking about, that's all." Dan challenged, tears in his eyes. "You always do this, always. Why can't you just believe that they're alive?!" Phil stepped to Dan and wrapped his arms around the other to comfort him, Dan relaxed into Phil's touch and let his tears fall.
"I mean, when we were at the water park he didn't touch you below your shoulders because you were in a bikini. It may seem like it's because he doesn't want to but he really does, he just respects you as a person."
"How did you manage to get Levi to look so much like you and..." She asked, trailing off when she realised that she didn't know Dean's name.
"Dean 'King of Avoiding Chick Flick Moments' created a chick flick moment." Gabriel commented lightly. Everyone laughed, the mood lifting. Bobby took it upon himself to restart the festivities by opening the presents on his lap. Sam and Dean had given him some of the lore from the Men of Letters, Cas had given him an angel blade.
been able to contact Novak since he's been here?"
"Boys." Chuck called with a laugh. The princes shuffled to a stop, their hands and cheeks full of food and wide smiles on their faces. "Our guests will be arriving soon, perhaps stop giving Hannah and Ion a workout and be more presentable."
"All is forgiven. You boys may have some fun together before our guests arrive." Chuck murmured, he pulled his children into a hug then left the ballroom.
"Ok, here Gabe, from Cas." Dean said. Gabriel smiled at his brother and opened the present.
"He told Novak that you kidnapped Castiel, that's the only thing that would prompt Chuck into wanting to start a war." Sam finally inputted. Dean slammed his hand on the table, causing everyone to flinch. Castiel bared his neck and whined softly.
"Look at you." Dean murmured. Cas watched the scene with a racing heart, the feeling of love rushed though his body but his heart clenched painfully. He didn't know how Dean would respond to him now that he was back to his usual state, he was hopeful but he didn't expect Dean to treat him as he did when the angel was female.
"Come on, we just need to go and unlock the fire exit to let the others in, we can fix that later." Dean rushed out as he pulled himself up onto the window ledge. Phil nodded and followed Dean through the window. The sound of their feet hitting the floor echoed throughout the quiet building ominously. They hurried out of the arcade room and made their way across the main showroom to the fire exit on the opposite end of the show-stage. Dean made quick work of flicking the lock and pushing it open. Dean held the door for Phil but the other had paused. "Phil, we gotta get the others." Dean insisted. Phil shushed the other and looked around the dark room suspiciously, he felt eyes on him, he looked at the animatronics on stage then laughed at himself quietly. Of course they were facing the way they should be. Phil shook his head dismissively and followed Dean out the door.
"He took aspects of nature in order to control it. No-one likes to be controlled, Sam, so when the victim has the opportunity to overpower the controller then they will do so. Nature, being the most powerful thing on Earth, despises being controlled by a lesser creature and will do anything to go against Aether when given the chance and will be kind to those who use her against Aether. The only problem is that, to be able to use nature against Aether, one must use magic however she will allow it if it means she can break free from Aether's grasp." Gabriel elaborated. "Hence why only nature can harm him." Cas tilted her head to the side as she looked over to the waitress then crawled around the booth and climbed onto Dean's lap.
"This isn't your problem." The alpha above him growled. Castiel shook his head desperately at the new wolves, begging them to help him. The biggest wolf growled again and barked loudly. The alpha above Castiel flicked his eyes between the omega and the three wolves then shifted suddenly, ripping through his clothes. Castiel followed the alpha's lead but cowered away from the alpha and the three new wolves, which he could tell were all alphas too.
"Dad has never said anything about designing more animatronics. And these aren't by my dad." Cas said. Dean frowned and looked over the blueprint again.
"This is your granny and grandpa. And Uncle Bobby." Dean introduced. Levi waved happily. The elders smiled at the little boy softly, they'd never seen Dean look at someone with so much love before.
"Yeah, do you want to go in Baby or Honey?" Cas asked.
"Some witnesses, kids, are saying that they saw Golden Bonnie near the victims before they went missing," Cas gritted his teeth, his nostrils flaring angrily. He shook his head and turned away from his father, "but the golden suits were locked away years ago! After the springlocks failed and that kid died."
"M'ok." Cas said, his eyes slipping closed. "Look in on him though."
"That was no-one, bug, she's not important to us." Dean explained simply. Levi tilted his head to the side in confusion causing Dean to laugh lightly.
"I don't know." Dan said softly. Dean and Phil looked at each other then at Cas.
"It's a Tulpa." He said sadly. Gabriel had been unusually quiet while Dean was on the laptop.
"What about Levi?" Sam plead, desperate to keep them together.
"See you later, Levi." Cas murmured as he leant down to kiss the boy's head. Sam wrapped his free arm around Cas' shoulder's in a brotherly hug and said his goodbye. Dean stood as Cas came towards him and took the angel's hand to lead him into the garage.
"The men who are missing left with the people they killed and they weren't mine." He explained. The Winchester's shared a look as Cas nodded. "I have photos of the people who do work for me, you're welcome to those."
"Wanted Daddy." Levi murmured. John smiled and leant on the counter.
"Why did daddy tell you off?" Cas questioned.
"Yes Levi?" He asked.
"Er, Dean." Phil called uncertainly. Dean looked over to the other boy and frowned; Phil was staring out the window at the storm with a panicked expression on his face. Dean stroked his thumb over Cas' cheeks once more before he stood to join Phil.
Castiel groaned loudly as he was awoken by three pairs of fists banging on his bedroom door. He called out to them to let them know that he was awake and getting dressed and the banging slowed to a stop, replaced by quiet chuckles. He changed out of his night clothes into a light pair of pants and a light long sleeved shirt. He opened his bedroom door as he tugged his cloak over his shoulders and was met with his brothers smiling brightly.
"I felt a surge of celestial energy about 5 minutes ago." Gabriel said without elaboration.
"What does that mean?" Sam asked.
"I need to go to work." Cas whispered reluctantly.
"You underestimate me once again." Gabriel said. "They're in your rooms. Get into them then I'll take us there." With childlike excitement, the brother's ran up the stairs to change. "You too, Cassie." Before long, the boys were downstairs waiting for Cas. Dean turned when he heard Cas' soft footfalls on the stairs, Gabriel had given her a simple, black, halter neck bikini. Dean smiled softly and made his way to the door with Sam.
"What do you want to watch, Cas?" Dean asked after a minute, startling Cas slightly. Cas smiled to himself and turned to Dean.
"You assumed that I, someone who had no idea that the pizzeria had been closed for so long and only found out what actually happened today, would have a way to get into it?" Cas queried sarcastically. Dan and Charlie laughed softly as Mark shrugged timidly with a little smile while Dean and Phil observed the building in front of them. It was only one floor but it was big, and every window had been boarded. Without a word, the older boys moved away from the group to survey their options.
"Hey, where's Gabe?" Sam asked, putting his laptop on the desk. Cas pulled out a chair and sat next to Dean.
"Good morning, Sam." Cas greeted with a smile. Sam returned the sentiment and sat down at the island with his brother and the archangel.
"Papa laugh." Levi said in his version of a whisper. Dean turned to Cas, who was still laughing, and gave him a predatory grin. Cas slowly stopped laughing and looked at Dean with worry in his eyes.
His childhood home.
"No, I mean, other than us. I feel like there's someone else, just in the shadows." Dean hummed and laid his hand on Cas' to catch his attention.
"I've been with Alpha all day." Castiel argued quietly.
It took them a few hours without stopping to get to the house that held Cas. Dean had jumped put the car as soon as they'd stopped, barely taking the time to turn the engine off. Sam grabbed Dean's arm before the elder could run into the building with no protection.
"Yes, Unca Gabe." He had muttered while running his fingers through Stitch's fur.
"What the fuck were you thinking, Dean?!" Sam started, not even acknowledging Castiel's presence. Dean scowled at his brother and let out a low growl. Castiel knew that, even if they were brothers, to disrespect the Head Alpha in the presence of company was punishable. Sam immediately bared his neck when he heard the growl.
"Yeah, can I see Papa's bees?" Levi asked into Dean's neck.
"Hey Cas, do you want something to eat?" Dean asked softly. Cas looked up surprised and blushed delicately.
"I have reasons to be." Dean stated. Cas blushed delicately and nuzzled his face into Dean's thigh. A light knock on the door caught Dean's attention.
"When are you going to tell him?" A voice asked from the door behind him. Dean jumped and turned to face his brother.
"Fuck it's cold." Phil muttered.
"But we don't know if it's a boy or a girl?" Cas argued. Dean shook his head.
Cas nodded along.
"Ok, do you mind waiting here a minute? We'll get everyone up then you can come in and we'll talk." Dean said. Michael nodded and stepped back away from the door. Phil bowed his head slightly and closed the door gently. "We letting him in?" Dean whispered.
"I'm Agent McKagan, this is Agent Rose and Fortus. We're here surveying the neighbourhood and we'd like to ask you some questions." Dean said.
Dean turned from his place in front of the shelves to look back at Cas, the angel hadn't followed them as he'd expected.
"It's just that Dean really wanted to experience what it's like to have a normal pregnancy. He said things like wanting to look after me while pregnant, first smile and first steps, things like that. And I didn't realise that I missed that without realising it. I love Levi with everything I have but he's so advanced and I didn't realise what I'd missed before Dean mentioned it." Cas explained. "I know it's stupid that I'm sad about that but..."
"You have... Chris Brown on your playlist?" Dean asked. Cas nodded absently, focusing on the road.
"It's ok, you're ok." Dean reassured.
"That's it, baby, so good." Dean praised gently when Cas got the hang of bouncing on his cock. Cas mewled and dragged his nails down Dean's chest, his head falling back slightly and mouth opened in a silent gasp.
"Yeah, baby, I'm fine. They're just a little tender." Dean reassured softly. He took Cas' hands in his own, joining their fingers together to pull him down and press their lips together in a loving kiss. Dean released one of Cas' hand and pulled Cas closer by his waist. Cas sighed happily and curled his now free hand around Dean's head, letting his thumb gently flick at the hunter's earlobe every so often.
"Hello Gabriel." Cas smiled. Gabriel entered the room and sat on the bed in the place Dean had just left.
"Well it's not like loads of people know how to use the springlock suits." Chuck disclosed with a sheepish smile. Cas huffed and shook his head, a small smile made his way onto his lips. "I don't blame you, you know?" Chuck told Cas, his voice soft and fond. Cas frowned and tilted his head to the side, confused. His father reached over and took Cas' hand in his own. Cas noticed the plethora of scars and calloused skin on his father's hand from decades of drawing blueprints and working with metal.
"Cassie." Gabriel called as he jogged towards Cas and Levi. The seraph turned with a smile, shifting Levi higher on Cas' hip.
"I'm carrying...? I have a...? Dean and I have...?" Cas stuttered. She glanced down her body and tears welled in her eyes as she realised the inevitability of both her and her child's death. "Sandalphon, how can you want the death of this baby?" Cas asked, tears now dripping down her face.
"When do you have to leave?" Cas asked keeping his voice low so as to not disturb Levi.
"How are you back, Gabriel? Lucifer iced you." Dean asked after watching the two angels hug it out for a moment.
"Why?" He asked.
"Thanks, baby." Dean whispered before he leant in to press their lips together. The kiss was short and they quickly re-positioned themselves as they had been when Sam interrupted their family time.
"He be back soon?"
"I think we should take Jack back to the Bunker." Sam's voice startled him out of his daze. Dean wiped all the emotions off his face then he turned to his baby brother.
"Beta's can do little to stop an Alpha from taking you, Castiel, you know that." Chuck growled. Castiel sat up straight at the sound, baring his neck slightly to ease his father's irritation.
"Where's Jimmy?" Charlie asked. Elijah and Sam shrugged, they'd been too distracted with the brightly coloured balls in front of them. The older children looked around the arcade room for the young boy but came up short. Charlie stepped around the ball pit to look behind some of the games and out the door but she saw nothing.
"What?" Dean asked softly. Phil didn't move his eyes from whatever he was looking at but turned his head slightly to acknowledge him.
"Cas, there is nothing wrong with you and you are perfect for him, everyone knows that. He probably doesn't want to sleep with you yet because he respects you." Sam said, his tone low and comforting.
"Yeah, it was just another hunt. Another monster of the week that can blur into all the others. We don't need to remember the details, sweetheart." Dean murmured. He cautiously lowered his hand onto Cas' neck and rubbed his thumb along the angel's hairline. Cas smiled and leant his head back into Dean's touch.
"Yes, bug?" Cas asked, turning around in Dean's arms.
"Where the fuck is Cas?" Dean shouted, he puffed up his chest slightly and towered over the siren menacingly.
"How can you be so sure of this?" Dean questioned. He looked over each members face, noticing how nervous they looked.
"That book must be awfully interesting." A deep voice said from above him. He moved his gaze up to the owner of the voice and groaned internally, God was not on his side. The handsome businessman was stood next to the spare chair at his table with a small smile on his face and a coffee in his hand.
"Go play, lovebug." Cas muttered after pressing a kiss to Levi's forehead. "Should you be so stern with him, Dean?" Cas asked, there was no judgement in his tone only curiosity.
"Your room is the Head Omega's room. We have separate rooms because, in Winchester, we don't mate immediately as is expected in royal Kingdoms. As the Alpha, I'm expected to court you, prove to you that I can provide for you and any future kids, to prove that I can protect you. As you are expected to show that you can keep a happy home and care for me and our pups. During the courting process, we are trying to show that we are compatible. Biologically we already are compatible. But being mates is more that biological compatibility. Until our relationship progresses, until we get closer, you are in the Head Omega's room. Even if we do mate and we share a room, the Head Omega's room is always available for you. It's your space now." Castiel nodded his understanding and stepped closer to Dean, holding onto the Alpha's hand. Dean lead Castiel up to the mansion and guided him up to the top of the mansion where a separate apartment lay. "This is where I live." Dean announced as he opened the door.
Gabriel immediately hovered over Cas as soon as the family walked through the door.
"Why are you talking to him?" Sam asked. The tall man stepped forward to watch Castiel work. "He's in a coma." The man sounded bitter and annoyed, as though the nurse hadn't been informed of Dean's current state.
"Who says I have an appetite for food?" The hunter whispered into Cas' ear then he continued to mark Cas' neck. Cas bit his lip again and pressed himself against Dean more fully. A content sigh passed Cas' lips and he moved his hand around Dean's body to grip his shoulder blade. Much to Dean's dismay, however, the baby monitor on Dean's bedside table came to life.
"He's getting our things out the car." Dean replied. It was a few seconds before the garage door opened and Sam and Cas walked into the kitchen.
"Hi Zeppelin, it's daddy." He murmured happily. The baby kicked again then Dean leant back. "Do you think dad will mind that I used Bobby as Zepp's namesake?"
"Our Father wouldn't want this to happen." Cas plead. Af laughed.
There seems to be about 6 or 7 chapters left but I can't be certain as nothing in this story has been pre-written (which may be obvious) and I just sit and write but that's my guestimate
"Why can't you stay with him?" Cas asked lowly. He reached his hand behind himself and took Levi by the hand. "Why must you make that decision for me? Why don't you want to stay with your son?"
"Sam, can you help Cas get in safely? I need to check on Levi." Dean asked as they pulled up to the house. Sam nodded and helped Cas up to his room.
"Will- will he lose respect for me if I try to seduce him?" Cas asked tentatively. Sam smiled and shook his head. Cas nodded slowly then stood. "I should get back to him, thank you Sam." Cas left the room and returned to Dean on the couch.
"Potential mate?" Mutters filled the room as the others discussed the news but Dean silenced them with a simple stomp.
"Why?" He asked. Gabriel laughed.
"I want to do it." Cas decided. Dean leant over and kissed Cas on the cheek.
"We need to discuss the presence of the Omega within our walls." Sam explained.
"You don't sound sure." Gabriel observed.
"I'm just hugging Papa." Dean replied. He shifted slightly, which caused his dick to thrust deeper into the angel. Cas bit down on Dean's shoulder to smother a moan.
"Why did you call me down?" Cas asked, keeping his voice level.
"I'm not hungry, Isham, but thank you. Would you gather maps of the kingdom and bring them here please?" Castiel asked. Isham nodded and started to leave. "If I am sleeping when you return, leave them on my desk please."
"Yeah, yeah." Dean muttered. Cas looked up at the hunter and leant up to press their lips together. "You don't want to know what's happening?" Dean murmured against Cas' lips.
"For what Cas?" Chuck asked. Cas shook his head into Chuck's shoulder.
"I'll take it from here, sweetheart." Dean said softly, resting his hand on the back of Cas' head. Cas smiled to himself and leant back into Dean's hand slightly. Dean felt Cas lean back and stroked his head bit before removing his hand.
This chapter is pretty sad towards the end, I nearly cried writing it.
"Yeah, my boyfriend's just asking me something for Levi." Cas explained. Maria nodded with a small smile.
"I'll go with Cas and Dean." Mark piped up excitedly. Dean and Phil shook their heads fondly at the boy. Phil took Dan and Charlie's arms to lead them through the heavy swinging doors that lead to the kitchen, storage rooms and the security guard's office. "I'm glad we weren't around when your dad introduced these." Mark commented, looking over the newer looking animatronics that were stood against the wall next to Chuck's office.
"No, no, of course not, Alpha." She stammered.
"Dean." Cas greeted sleepily.
All of the victims had brusing around their wrists and ankles, which suggested that they had been bound and restrained during the torture. They had extensive bruising all over their bodies that coupled with many lacerations that varied in severity. Many bones were broken in each victim but they differed between the indiviuals, however, all of the victims had broken legs. They all had dark, distinctive hand marks around their necks but none of them died of asphyxiation, perhaps they had meerly been starved of oxygen momentarily as part of their torture. Death Wish had mutilated some of his victim's genitals but not all, the reason for this factor had not been found. The cause of death was found to be starvation and dehydration. Of course, there was the signature DW carved into every victim's chest, which everyone assumed stood for Death Wish after the lead investigator had publicly said that the public 'must have a death wish to leave their homes at night with this killer on the loose'. This explanation would make sense if the initals had appeared after the investigator made his announcement but they had been there from the beginning, they'd been there with Lisa.
"Dean and I are taking Levi home." Cas told the others as he picked up his bags.
"Cas! Nice to see you awake, man." Sam exclaimed, pulling Cas into a tight, brotherly hug. "How are you feeling? How's Levi?" Sam asked with a happy grin.
"Ok, Dean, ok." Cas relented, shocked by the raw emotion the hunter was showing. "I think I understand." Dean took a deep breath and rubbed a hand over his face.
"The bunker?" Dean asked.
"Who's that?" Dean asked gesturing towards the boy that Levi was skillfully avoiding. Lisa grinned and crossed her arms across her stomach.
"Yes, Alpha, thank you." Castiel muttered without moving his gaze. Dean frowned at the shorter man and sat in the seat next to Castiel. He had opened his mouth to speak but the door to the room opened before he could. A tall man with longer hair, that Castiel knew to be Samuel Winchester, stepped through the doorway and joined them at the table.
"How do we kill a witch of nature?" Sam asked shutting his laptop to turn all of his attention on the angel.
"He? My baby's a boy?" Cas asked with an excited smile. Gabriel grinned back and nodded. Cas smiled down at his midsection, his mind racing with names. Gabriel took Cas' arm and flew back to the house.
"Pretty much, at least we know he's moved on from Alyssa." Gabriel offered. Dean sighed and picked up his food. Gabriel stared down at the table briefly before his head snapped up. "We need to go."
Dean looked out into the garden to watch his family with fond eyes. Cas was running around after Levi with a big grin on his face while their son giggled excitedly. Dean smiled then turned to the coat hooks and pulled his jacket on.
"Yep, then God made humans from that fish, well he allowed creatures to evolve, and told us to bow to them, to you. Cassie, of course, loved the new creations, as God requested. But then Lucifer rebelled, and Cas was scared of him, of the fighting, of the outcome. Then I left." Gabriel finished, an underlying sadness weighing on him about abandoning his favourite brother when said brother probably needed him the most. "You've come so far, birdie, I'm so proud of you and what you've become." Cas smiled fondly at the childhood nickname and stood to approach his older brother. He embraced his brother tightly, burying his face in Gabriel's shoulder. Dean watched the brothers fondly, barely turning his head when he heard his own brother approaching.
"We have an appointment with Dr Ottoway." Dean said. Cas was relieved that Dean managed to keep the sharpness out of his voice as he addressed the brunette.
"You love it, I see you blush every time." Dean replied with a smirk. Cas gave him a half-hearted glare as the blush on his cheeks deepened, Dean winked at the younger boy and shoved him towards the stairs. Cas stuck his tongue out at Dean childishly and made his way up the stairs. "Ok, let him in." Dean said to Phil, waving towards the door.
"What?" The Head Alpha questioned lowly. He didn't take his eyes off Castiel as he addressed his pack member.
"Well, if this is all just a misunderstanding then we can just send Omega Novak on his merry way back to Novak and prevent another War of Kingdoms." John said with a clap. Castiel clasped his hands together and bowed his head, it made sense to send him home. The room erupted in agreement, though Benny and Missouri watched Dean curiously.
"I can't! I've suppressed my grace for so long that it takes longer than Dean has to work it up to full power. His ribs have punctured his lungs. I don't have enough time." Cas sobbed, his panic starting to lead into hyperventilation.
"Thank you, father." Castiel blushed, not used to compliments.
"What do you mean you're not strong enough?! You're a half seraph, half archangel hybrid who could become a full blown archangel with the right power but you aren't strong enough to heal my brother? The father of your child?" Sam shouted angrily, fury in his eyes. Tears fell down Cas' cheeks as he looked at Dean desperately.
ohana.
"You two should get to bed." Dean looked up at him confused.
"That's lovely." She exclaimed. "Does she live with you guys too?"
"Be careful." Cas nodded with a grateful smile. Cas walked into Dean's room somewhat shyly. Dean was leant against his drawers. His eyes raked over Cas' body and bit his lip. He raised his hand to gesture for Cas to come forward. Sam may have been right about him forgetting that Cas was a man or that he knew he wasn't great at relationships but if he could do one thing exceptionally well it was sex. Dean pulled Cas against his body and smirked down at her. Cas' arms tightened self-consciously around her chest as she flushed shyly. Dean raised an eyebrow but said nothing, he leant down and pressed his lips to her neck, his hands gripping onto her bare waist. Cas let out a soft hum and leant closer to the hunter in front of her. All of her worries about Dean's affections towards her slipped away as Dean sucked and nipped up her neck, in that moment she didn't care if it all ended when she was restored to her natural state. Dean gently grasped her wrists and pulled them away from her body so she could drag her perfect nails down his sweaty chest. Dean pulled back to look into Cas' eyes then gently cupped her neck so he could press their lips together in a passionate kiss. Cas mewled quietly and pushed her body flush against Dean's. The hunter huffed a laugh and began to push her over to the bed. When she felt the bed press against her shins, she allowed herself to fall back. Dean grinned down at her and tugged at the towel around her waist. Cas took a deep breath and nodded hesitantly. Dean carefully pulled the towel away from around her waist.
"I think that this conversation has long since been over done, don't you?" Balthazar said, focusing on his plate. "We are all well aware of how dangerous the world is, can we eat?"
"Ok, ok. Where's the archangel?" Aether asked looking behind them for the angel.
"So Adler must have told Chuck something that would cause him to start a war." Rufus commented.
"What the fuck?" Dean murmured in disbelief. Golden Bonnie was leaving the kitchen, but he had accumulated a plate with something on it, food most likely. "Did you guys get around to looking in the kitchen?"
"He's very protective." Cas explained as he leant towards the computer, hoping that she'd take the hind and continue their lesson.
"Wait." Cas replied calmly. Dean did as he was told and knelt beside Cas. "Come on, bee." He mumbled encouragement. Dean frowned, he knew Cas was talking to the baby because he called both of the kids 'bee' but he didn't understand why until something hit his hand. Dean looked up at Cas, awe in his eyes.
"Yeah, I'll come and say goodnight after Papa has told you your story." Dean confirmed. He leant down to kiss Levi on the forehead then left the room. He had just gotten downstairs when the front door opened. "Hi Dad." Dean greeted. John nodded and followed Dean into the kitchen.
He pushed the invading thoughts from his mind and basked in the sunlight. He heard his family returning; the rumble of Dean's Baby, the clunk of the garage door and Levi's excited footsteps. Cas' smile widened but he kept his eyes closed.
"Woah." Mark mumbled in awe. He had only known the original Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria.
“You was away for two Monday’s last work.” Levi struggled to get out.
"Don't wanna, papa." He mumbled.
Any mistakes will be sought out and corrected tomorrow (24/08/18)
"It's alright, Cas." He mumbled into Cas' hair. Cas shook his head and moved it to the crook of Dean's neck. "Come on, it's nearly 3 am. Let's get you to bed." Dean whispered. Neither boy moved for a moment before Dean pressed a light kiss to the top of Cas' head and went to stand. "You in your old room?" Cas nodded and smiled to himself. When they were younger, they loved to come to Cas' house to play in his room, they loved that his dad had made so many hidden doors and toys. Dean followed Cas up the wooden stairs, smiling when he saw Cas' FredBear sat on the arm chair. Dean's smile faded when Cas' fingers glided over the dark wood of Elijah's door. Cas turned to Dean with open arms, presenting his old room to his friend. "Just as I remember." Dean muttered, looking around the room. Cas nodded and smirked. Dean walked to one of the cranks on the wall and turned it, looking up at the light where the bees and clouds circled and danced around it. A small smile came to his face as he watched them, his mind drifting back to when he was younger and did the same. He pushed another button and watched in the same childlike amazement as the ceiling lit up like the sky on a clear night. When he looked back to Cas, the younger boy was watching him fondly. Dean smiled at him but he saw the underlying sadness and confusion in Cas' eyes. So he stepped forward.
"We want you to get up and dressed, we have a visitor." Dean replied. Charlie and Dan rolled out of bed and pulled their bags with them up to the bathroom.
"After what happened when I went on a hunt last time, I'm not sure I want to go on another hunt." Dean explained. He found that he couldn't meet Cas' eyes.
"Papa shout at me." Levi sniffled, he rubbed a chubby fist over his eye. Dean frowned and spoke to someone on the other end before he moved into another room.
Dean greeted. Cas smiled but his eyes flicked around nervously.
"I hope I get to meet Dean soon." Maria said changing the subject quickly. Cas grinned at her.
"Hunt." Dean replied simply. Cas nodded and kissed Dean's neck gently.
"Why don't we go and check it out?" Mark suggested. Everyone turned their gazes to him.
"My name's Michael." The man said after a moment. "Michael Afton."
"Don't you dare. Don't you dare criticise me
"There aren't any other... savages?" Castiel asked once the clearing was empty again. Now, knowing some of the people in Winchester, he felt uncomfortable calling them savages when he felt differently about them. Dean sat down next to the Omega, smiling at his position.
"No, baby, of course not. Lisa was a brief fling, years ago, I don't know that kid from Adam. You and Levi, you're my family, you've been there for nearly a decade, Cas, Levi is my son, for certain. I'm not leaving you unless you tell me to go." Dean said, looking deep into Cas' blue eyes. "Come on, babe, let's get Levi home." Cas nodded and smiled contently when Dean leant over the handbrake to give the angel a quick kiss. Cas connected his phone to his car and pressed shuffle on Spotify. Dean withdrew his hand from Cas' neck and looked at him with furrowed eyebrows as Freaky Friday started through the speakers. "What is this?" Dean asked as Cas started the car.
"What ott?" He asked. Dean turned his smile to the toddler. With the otter toy in hand, Dean carried Levi down the aisle to join his brother and the angels. Cas glanced at the hunter sadly and looked down at his feet. "Papa?" Said Levi's quiet voice. Cas turned to his son and put a fake smile on his face.
"You smile a lot more, man, I hear you laugh more. After so many months of you being consistently sad, I'm happy that you're happy." Sam explained.
"I'll get him, let you guys have some time." Gabriel murmured. He kissed Cas' hair gently then moved off the bed to get Levi. Cas curled up on his side then pulled Dean down behind him. He sighed happily when he felt Dean wrap his arm around his waist, his hand resting on his chest over his heart, and pressed little kisses on his neck. Dean's other arm tucked itself under Cas' neck, Cas reached up and intertwined their fingers. Levi scrambled up on the bed without a word and curled himself against Cas' chest.
"He's just taking you away from us!" Lisa exclaimed suddenly. "If it weren't for him, you'd come with us in a heartbeat."
Sam opened his eyes and glanced around, he was still at the house but his family weren't there. He checked all of the doors, all of them bricked up. He relaxed into the couch. It wasn't long before he started to hear rustling and footsteps outside. He calmly wandered over to the window and looked out. He turned when he felt eyes on his back. He slumped back into the couch when it appeared in his face. It's dark eyes boring into Sam's bright ones, it's sharp teeth glinting in the dim light. Sam's heart rate increased and adrenaline coursed through his veins, his muscles tensed and sweat beaded on his forehead. Suddenly he was back on the couch with Cas and Dean.
"What have we missed, Dean? You were there when he was born, you've been there nearly everyday." Cas asked softly. Dean laughed humourlessly and looked into the living room where Levi was twirling and dancing to the music.
"Do not speak to him like that." Dean roared. "You will treat my potential mate with respect. Father or not, I will exile you from the mansion if I see fit."
"Ok, be careful." Dean sighed. He had to admit it would be nice for them to spend some time as a family of 3.
Once everyone had eaten, they moved into the living room, putting Christmas songs on quietly in the background. Mary, John and Bobby sat on the sofa, Sam and Levi shared the arm chair while Gabriel, Dean and Cas sat on the floor.
"Your brother... Your brother died here." Dean eventually said. Cas frowned.
"I know, but how do we know for sure that everyone is the same?" Castiel asked. He stepped out onto his balcony again, he could feel his brother following him but he kept his eyes on the lights below; he could faintly see flickering lights further in the distance, further into the forest.
"Afton..." Cas repeated. The name sounded familiar but he couldn't place it, he probably just saw it when the incident happened.
"Shortly after Levi was born, she got back into trouble with... the wrong crowd and got herself shot." Cas babbled, hoping that it was believable enough to close the conversation. Maria nodded and looked around the library.
"It nearly Kismas, Daddy." Levi stated softly.
"You done holding the poor man hostage?" Sam joked when Dean stepped away to grab Levi's plate. Cas laughed at the younger Winchester and started on the brothers' pancakes.
"I'm sorry, Dean." Cas' voice was muffled by Dean's shirt but Dean heard him.
"Dean!" Cas shouted as Hayden picked up his knife again and started towards the kitchen. Ryan watched with a grin. Sam noticed this and glanced in the TV, seeing the siren's true form. Sam lunged for the siren as Dean flung the door open. The siren scowled at the younger Winchester and dodged his punch. Sam was tackled to the floor, the knife slid away from him out of his reach. The siren grinned and began to lean down. Sam's hands held the siren's neck, holding his face away. He kept his mouth firmly closed so he couldn't ingest any of the poison.
"Come on, Dean, you gotta wake up." Sam whispered.
"Brother, I need to to focus all your attention on your grace." Gabriel said softly. He was sat behind Sam with his hands resting on Cas' stomach. Cas closed his eyes, his eyebrows furrowed in pain. He squeezed both Winchester's hands as another wave of pain flowed through him.
"I love it." Cas whispered. His hand rubbed over his stomach again, a soft smile set on his face. "Hiya Zeppelin." The smile turned into a grin when the baby kicked against his hand. Dean leant down and pressed his lips against Cas' stomach.
"Yeah, he's going to encourage Levi to detach his soul from Cas' grace so he can start to form his body because if Levi stays attached any longer than today then it could get dangerous for Cas." Gabriel explained. Sam nodded and looked up at Dean. The older Winchester had an odd look on his face as he looked at Cas, Sam could tell what he was going to do. A few tears leaked through Cas' closed eyes as his body began to shake. "He close to detachment." Cas' eyes snapped open and began to shine bright blue as his grace powered up. The Winchester's watched in awe as a swirl of blue and green light materialised in Gabriel's arms. "You did it, brother." Gabriel whispered proudly. Cas' eyes focused on the light and he smiled fondly. Gabriel gingerly passed it over to Cas.
"They have no reason to." Chuck answered certainly. Michael nodded, content with the answer, and pushed back from the table.
"Brotherly love that I feel for your brother and Gabriel, love for burgers and err..." Cas confided.
"We still going back to Freddy's tonight?" Mark asked curiously, his tone was laced with excitement. Mark had always been the one that was the most interested in adventures while the others preferred to be inside watching films and TV, reading and playing video games.
"So how will this one be different to Levi?" Dean asked. Levi frowned and turned to look up at his parents. Cas watched Dean's hand fondly then turned slightly to look up at Dean.
Dean asked bluntly, not bothering with a hello. Really, he knew he didn't need to be so sharp with Cas since he knew that the angel would only tell Levi off if he needed to but he was stressed out about the hunt and being away from his family.
"More, Dean, please." Cas begged. Dean sat back on his heels and traced Cas' waistband again.
"Yes, bitch, I can be professional." Dean bit back with a returning smirk. "Suit up we'll go in 10 minutes." Sam and Dean went upstairs and changed into their FBI suits.
"Of course I wasn't! I told her to leave after I pushed her away." Dean argued. Cas sighed in relief and let himself move forward to press himself against Dean. "Did you really think I would?" Dean asked softly.
"No Cas, you haven't pissed us off." He insisted with a small smile. Cas' cheeks flushed delicately.
"I sorry, Papa." Levi muttered. Cas huffed a small laugh and hoisted the boy up into his arms.
"Really,
"Cas, do you want to leave?" Dean asked, kneeling by Castiel.
"I'm not the one you need to apologise to either." Dan said. Cas sighed deeply and looked up at Phil, who nodded back seriously. Cas' shoulder's slumped defeatedly and he dragged his feet outside.
"Caught ya." The alpha growled with a wicked smirk. Castiel struggled and begged for the alpha to let him go. The wolf just laughed at the omega and ripped the cloak away from Castiel's body. The wolf froze momentarily, taking a deep breath, and moaned lowly. Castiel could smell it too; terrified and distressed omega filled the air. "Mmm, a prince." The alpha said gripping painfully onto the omega's wrists. Castiel refused to submit to the alpha but he wasn't above begging for the alpha to release him. The alpha shifted to hold Castiel's wrists in one hand while he ran his hand over Castiel's omegan curves.
"I'm good, Sam." Cas said with a soft smile. Sam returned the smile and ran his hand through his hair.
"Merry Christmas, guys." Sam greeted with a wide grin. Levi popped up and raised his eyes excitedly.
"Oh Fuck."
"What's up, buddy?" Dean asked when he saw the boy's face.
Cas looked at the door that lead to the Golden animatronics stage, his father hadn't told him that Golden Bonnie was only in animatronic mode and they'd definitely gone to him for help. Dean wrapped his arm around Cas' shoulders, as Phil had done with Dan while the others crowded around them in a group hug, Sam was safely packed in the centre of the older kids.
"He doesn't know what it means, baby." Dean whispered. Cas hummed in disapproval but made no move to get Dean's hand to a more appropriate location in his body then he glanced over at Levi, who was focused on The Lion King.
Cas smiled and shook his head. He quickly replied, grabbed his keys and wallet then headed back out of the door. On the drive to the restaurant where his friend's were waiting for him, he had to drive passed the now closed Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria. The windows were boarded up and the door was chained shut but the paint was still vibrant and the outside play area looked like it was in good condition, then again, Cas didn't know how long it had been closed for. He quickly looked away and carried on driving.
"No, of course not. I just think it would be safer if you didn't antagonise them." Michael replied with a shrug.
"Adler, Zachariah, he attacked Cas earlier this morning. He must have gone back to Novak to talk to Chuck." Dean explained.
"Papa?" Levi asked through a mouthful of food.
"Hey sweetheart, I got your sandwich and milkshake." Dean said as he entered their bedroom but he stopped short. "Cas?" The angel choked out another sob and shook his head. Gabriel looked at the hunter with sad eyes and gestured for the other man to sit down. "Cas, baby, what's wrong?"
Ahead of them was a wall, the wall to Winchester. Castiel looked around in awe as they stepped through the gate, but at the same time was cowering cautiously, he had been told that these people were savages after-all. The first thing he noticed was that it was so much bigger than he had expected, than he had been told or what had been implied, the next thing he noticed was that everyone was wandering around the village- though Castiel suspected it was larger than a village- without fear; omegas and betas weren't walking in fear of the alphas, and the alphas weren't propositioning every omega they saw, rather everyone was walking around... as an equal. A stark difference to the village in Novak.
Dean said with the laugh lingering in his tone. Cas and Levi bid their hunter farewell and put down the phone.
"What happened, Levi?!" Cas asked hurriedly, panic rising in his tone. Levi crawled into his Papa's arms and sobbed into his neck.
"Time how long he's in there." Dean instructed. Charlie immediately grabbed her phone and started the timer. It was approaching the 10 minute mark when the Golden Bonnie emerged from the security guards office and walked to the kitchen.
"Hey Sam, did you find anything at the library?" Dean called. He shrugged when there was no answer and footsteps disappeared up the stairs. Levi had just asked Dean for a drink when the footsteps came back downstairs and into the kitchen.
"Hiya Dean." Lisa purred, looking up at him through her eyelashes. Dean rolled his eyes and scratched the back of his head.
"Don't forget about Levi." Cas slurred after Dean had pulled back. Dean chuckled as Cas curled back into a ball and snuggled into the covers. After a brief, lasting glance at the angel, Dean shuffled over to Levi's room. Being light-footed on a day to day basis for a majority of his life came in handy as he crept towards Levi's crib.
"Anyway, these ones, the Funtime animatronics have design features that are decidedly more dubious. Funtime Freddy has a luring feature, Funtime Foxy has parental voice sync and replay, Ballora has deter and misdirect, Circus Baby is fucking massive. They don't fit with the others." Charlie pointed out. Dean and Phil leant closer to look over the blueprints.
"Yes, Dean, I'm sure. Thank you." Cas reassured. Dean pursed his lips slightly, as though he didn't believe the other but didn't want to say anything, then nodded slowly. With a tight but genuine smile, Dean tapped on the hood of his car twice and slid into the driver's seat. Cas watched him pull away too with a little wave. Once the black car was out of sight, he leant forward and rested his forehead on his car. He had missed his friends greatly, even though he'd spoken to them frequently. Cas smiled to himself and got into the car.
"I sorry I bad, Papa." Levi mumbled as he was lifted into Cas' arms. Cas smiled, Levi nuzzled into Cas' neck. Cas hugged his son for a minute then set Levi on the island. Dean watched as Cas cleaned Levi's face. He'd watched the angel before, taking in the details of his face, but he'd never allowed himself to really appreciate Cas' features. He'd never appreciated how beautiful the angel was; the smooth tan skin of his cheeks and throat, his impossibly blue eyes, the dark tousle of his hair, his light 5 o'clock shadow and his full lips. He truly looked like an angel, in the most cliche way possible. When Cas looked up, he caught Dean smiling at him causing him to blush delicately. And for once, Dean didn't look away. Dean's eyes softened as did his smile.
"This is Levi, my son." Dean answered, resting a hand on the back of Levi's head.
"Oh my god, guys wake up." Dan exclaimed loudly. The way Dean's head popped up behind the back of the couch was almost comical but the younger boys' hearts were beating so fast they couldn't find it funny. Mark and Charlie rushed over to them while Dean tugged Phil out of the chair, ignoring the black haired man's complaints.
"Excuse me for wanting him back to normal." Dean sighed. Cas looked at Dean and smiled, she too reached under the water to grasp Dean's knee. They relaxed in the hot-tub until darkness swallowed the sky.
"I find it amusing that you believe you have superiority over me." Gabriel started. "You are but a human who stole the immense power of nature to become something you do not deserve. You dare confront me, an archangel, with such disrespect when you would be nothing without your theft." Aether scowled at the angel then his eyes flicked back to the others, who were attempting to regroup. Aether threw a blast of wind in their direction to throw them off and they all flew apart with a gasp. Cas fell onto the floor with a grunt then began to roll towards the crack in the ground, she managed to hold onto the side as the rest of her fell.
"Who's going with who?" Dan asked.
"Right there?" Dean asked against Cas' mouth. Cas moaned a yes and continued to claw at Dean's back. "Does that feel good, beautiful? Because you feel so good around me, you're so fucking hot."
"Exactly, so I'm not going to cheat on you. I know I don't have a great track record with relationships but you're different and I'm not going to ruin it just because we're under this stupid spell." Dean said reassuringly. He pressed a kiss to Cas' forehead and continued on their path to the checkout.
"I'm sure they're just playing in the ball pit." Dean's mum, Mary, said reassuringly. Sam shook his head vigorously, as did Dan and Cas.
"Your loss." She replied lightheartedly before strutting away. Cas smiled appreciatively and rested his hand on the Winchester's thigh. Dean bit his lip and smirked, placing his own hand high on Cas' thigh. Cas' free hand reached up and curled around Dean's neck. Sam frowned in confusion but he turned back to the other patrons in the club to give them some privacy.
"You think that Dean is going to think less of you?" Sam questioned.
"Yeah, Cas, can we have Christmas?" Dean asked with a hopeful smile. Cas sighed and looked around the table for help but every member of the family we watching him with hopeful eyes.
"No, no, it just feels weird." Cas insisted then he pushed down on Dean's finger. Dean kissed the angel to distract him as he gingerly added a second finger. Cas' mouth dropped open when Dean brushed the tips of his fingers against his prostate and he let out breathy gasps, encouraging Dean to speed up his fingers. "Mmm, Dean." Cas moaned, digging his nails into the muscle on Dean's back. Dean sat back to watch his fingers disappear into Cas.
"It's not a lure, Dean, it's a promise, it's a positive about coming with us." She insisted.
"Benjamin, come on, we're leaving." Lisa called out. Ben ran over to his mother.
"Phil, help me clear these paper's off the table." Dean asked, already starting to tidy the papers. Cas and Dan sat down on the sofa, watching their best friends.
"May I ask how she died?" Cas swallowed and looked down at their hands, trying to find a believable cause of death.
"I am happy, Cas, I really am. Happier than I've ever been." They separated with small smiles on their faces and leant back into their places, back into their comfortable silence. Dean padded down the stairs to his family watching Blue Planet, he paused at the bottom of the stairs then turned to the kitchen to make them some drinks. He heated the milk in a saucepan and grabbed three mugs ready. Once he deemed the milk to be hot enough, he added the hot chocolate powder to it and mixed it until it was ready. He poured the hot chocolate into the mugs, then he excitedly added whipped cream and marshmallows to the top. He carried them carefully to the living room and put them on the coffee table. "Oh thanks, Dean." Sam said surprised. Dean nodded to his brother and flopped down onto the couch, his back against the armrest and his leg propped up on the couch, his knee leaning against the back of it. Cas smiled across the sofa at Dean and shuffled to sit between the hunter's legs with his back against Dean's chest.
"No, Levi, you're too little." Dean murmured. Cas stood and wiped his hands dry.
"I added chorizo." Dean explained when Cas turned to him, clearly still confused.
"You know, with helping out with Cas and helping my brothers I don't really have time for any alone time." Dean said then pressed a light kiss to Cas' temple.
"No thank you, Dean." Cas said. "I just wanted say hi to Levi before I continued with my book." Cas mumbled.
"Told me 4 more kids went missing and, at some point, another kid died due to 'springlock failure'. Seems like I was right, 5 more dead kids hanging over our heads." Cas muttered bitterly.
"So I'll go with Sam." Cas said simply. Dean laughed humourlessly.
"I want to base my decision on why you thought it was unnecessary." Cas said firmly. Dr Ottoway sighed and opened Cas' file.
With a quick look at his phone, he hopped up and shoved his blank note-cards, pens and tape measure back into his bag then hurried back around to the front of the restaurant.
"It doesn't seem like 'your omega' wants you and you're on my territory" The Head Alpha repeated lowly. Castiel breathed in the head alpha's scent and whined softly, the alpha's scent was protective and threatening. The omega slowly moved closer to the new alphas, keeping his eyes on Adler, they were making him feel safe. Adler moved to get closer to Castiel but yelped when the Head Alpha snapped at the alpha. "Leave." The Head Alpha growled. Adler snarled at the Head Alpha then turned and ran into the forest. "Omega Prince, are you ok?" The Head Alpha asked softly, pressing his body closer to the ground to look smaller so that Castiel wouldn't be threatened by the alpha. The other two alphas followed their Head Alpha's lead and laid on the floor with their heads on their paws, whining softly so that Castiel wouldn't be frightened by them either.
"Why should I? If I tell you now, you'll kill me. At least if I show you, I get to live longer." Not-Cas retorted. Dean scowled at the other then shoved himself away. He turned angrily and threw his fist into the bunker's door then ripped the lamp from it's socket, throwing it onto the floor.
"The animatronics, they shouldn't move when the power switches on, they shouldn't be able to move off the stage." Cas yammered.
"Levi, this is from Uncle Gabe." Dean announced handing Levi the present. "And I bet I can guess what it is." He muttered afterwards, scowling up at the archangel, who shrugged.
"Levi, it's Daddy." Dean smiled and took a deep breath.
Sam jolted at the loud slam of the bunker door and shoved his chair back at the sight of his older brother; Dean had tears streaming down his cheeks, his face was red and he was breathing heavily, like he couldn't catch his breath.
"What basement, Dean? There isn't one, we've looked everywhere." Sam reiterated.
"What's happening?!" John and Sam asked together. Dean held the boy close and shrugged, the little boy as shoving his face into Dean's neck desperately trying to move away from Cas.
"No, of course I didn't, I pushed her away when she started pushing up against me." Dean replied, offended that Cas would think he'd kiss her back.
Cas groaned as she regained consciousness. She went to rub her head but she couldn't move her hands. She slowly opened her eyes and looked around confused. She was no longer in the Winchester house, instead she was in a dimly lit, decrepit room. She lowered her eyes to her restricted arms and struggled slightly to see if there was any give.
"Can I rent a room for an... undetermined amount of time?" Cas asked, shifting Levi on his hip. The woman gave him a sympathetic smile.
"Dean, open some of your presents." Cas said softly once everyone had calmed down. He reached over to stroke his hand through Levi's curls. Dean's eyes softened on the angel, he nodded and looked through the presents to find one for him.
"The siren." Dean answered in realisation.
"Oh fuck, Cas, fuck fuck fuck. Oh baby, I'm right there. Just a little more." Dean panted. "Look at you, you're so beautiful, you feel incredible." Dean started to thrust up into Cas desperately as the heat pooled in his own stomach.
"Did he tell you why?" Castiel asked politely.
"Deanie loves me." Cas said to the girl confused.
"It's ok, baby, it's going to be ok." Dean murmured reassuringly. Cas nuzzled his face into Dean's neck and relaxed.
"I'll tell Levi." Dean muttered as Cas turned up the stairs. After a lot of crying from Levi, the Winchester brother's and Cas left for Utah.
"It's a pagan amulet, Seal of Solomon Health and Prosperity." Bobby explained when Sam and Dean turned to him in question. Cas thanked Bobby as he put the amulet around his neck.
"The shapeshifter. It looked like Dean, he... he did this to me... I... I allowed... I let him touch me." Cas murmured. Sam's frown deepened and he pulled Cas closer.
"It's from a kid." Phil realised softly. "Keep digging, let's see if we can find more." Dean, Phil and Mark nodded and started with renewed vigor while Dan and Charlie stepped back with their torches shining on the hole. As they dug, they handed Cas anything they found so he could piece them together. The three other boys dug and searched through the dirt for more bones for hours before they started to come up with nothing.
"Hey, Cas." Sam murmured as he sat next to the angel. "Hey, have you thought of a name for him?" Cas' eyes focused on Sam's face and a fond smile set on his face. He quickly glanced at Dean but other than that he looked at Sam as he answered the younger Winchester.
"No, Dean, he took his arms out of his car seat straps and I panicked." Dean nodded at him and looked at Levi briefly.
"Bear!" Elijah exclaimed pointing at the brown bear standing centre stage.
"Helping you escape the kingdom is akin to letting the serpent into Eden." Gadreel said. He pulled the maps towards him and started to show Castiel what the path of least resistance would be on the day of his escape. They spoke for hours until it got too dark to see without lighting the candles. "Come on, Castiel, I will walk you back to the gate."
"2018 Chevy Impala, I got you your own Baby." Dean finished, his chest puffing out in pride. Cas looked at Dean with his mouth opened wide then turned back to the car. He unlocked it and slipped into the driver's seat, stroking the steering wheel. Dean moved to stand between the two Impala's so he could watch the angel.
"What do you need the book for?" He asked. Sam looked up at his brother then turned his laptop toward him.
"Sam, I'm worried about Levi." He mumbled sadly. Cas smiled and walked over to his brother.
The last thing she saw was a white face and dark, black eyes.
"It's fine, just my first coma patient." Castiel explained. Jess smiled softly and laid her hand on his shoulder.
Once their stomachs were full, they turned to the stage to watch the show. All of them watched awestruck as the animatronics went through their routine, despite all of them having seen it regularly.
"Daddy, I help." Levi said after everyone had made a request and Dean stood. Dean took Levi's hand and lead him to the kitchen. Dean pulled out two beers for John and Bobby and sodas for himself, Mary and Levi.
"Nothing! We're playing hide and seek but Jimmy is real good at hiding." Cas said as nonchalantly as a 6 year old could. Chuck raised his eyebrow incredulously but nodded his ok. He bent down and pressed a kiss to Cas' head before gently leading Cas out of the office. Cas grinned back at his father as the elder shut the door then turned to his table where he had put his brother down. But Elijah wasn't there. He'd gone. In a panic, Cas ran around the pizzeria frantically looking for Elijah, he didn't want to draw attention to himself by shouting out but he soon resorted to looking for his friends, hoping one of them had seen Elijah. He found his friends in Pirate's Cove, quietly talking next to Foxy's stage. "Guys!" Cas exclaimed running up to them.
"Really?!" Cas nodded excitedly, happy tears welling up in his eyes again. Gabriel tugged them both into a tight hug with a relieved laugh.
"Come on, ladies. It's getting really dark out here." Charlie observed before stepping forward and climbing over the fence.
"Thank you, Hannah." The omega servant gave him a small smile then started down the stairs. Castiel made his way quickly through the corridors to a side door of the castle, carefully avoiding any of his family. "Good afternoon, Isham." Castiel greeted politely. Isham simply opened the door and guided Castiel down the small cobblestone path down to the gate. "Thank you."
"Spread your legs a bit more, sweetheart." Dean said against his lips. Cas was quick to obey and held onto Dean's shoulders. Dean rubbed the lube over Cas' hole, getting Cas used to the feeling of his fingers being somewhere he'd never been touched before. "You're alright." Dean whispered at Cas' pained whine when he started to push one finger into the angel. "It gets better, trust me." He promised. He paused once the first finger was up to the third knuckle to let the angel adjust.
"I doubt that. I can't just stay here all the time, I'll need to take Levi out sometimes. I have to put both of us in danger every time that we go out. And I know it. You know it too." Cas continued. Gabriel sighed and retreated to his room. The Winchester's watched Cas carefully but said nothing. Sam eyed Dean skeptically. The older Winchester had sat as far away from Cas as he could, Levi sat between them. After a moment of watching Levi, Dean stood and left to retrieve his laptop. When he returned, he heard Cas talking quietly to both Sam and Levi. "I knew it was too good to be true."
"What do you mean?" Cas inquired. Dan frowned and looked out of the window into the dark night, Cas could see the beginnings of tears pooling in his eyes shining in the moonlight.
"Am 'right, daddy." Levi said. Dean watched him with soft eyes then pulled Levi into his arms.
"Are you going to say goodbye to Levi?" Cas mumbled, leaning into Dean's hand as he continued to stroke the other man's hair.
"Ok. Ok." Cas whispered to himself.
"Is it as good as Papa's egg?" Cas asked in a stage whisper. Dean chuckled softly. Cas' heart ached at the domesticity of the scene but he savoured it, this may be the closest he'll ever get.
"Where Papa and Unca Gabe go?" Levi asked. Cas picked the boy up and rested him on his hip.
"He wouldn't listen when I told him I couldn't pick him up." Cas explained. He heard Dean sigh and could almost see the hunter rubbing his hand over his face.
"That doesn't matter, Cas. It doesn't. You've been cursed or something, your grace is weak, you're on low power. That doesn't mean anything. Me, Sammy and Gabe still love you. We don't care if you're weak but you are
"Just look." Levi decided. Dean sighed heavily but agreed.
"It's beautiful." Castiel whispered, awestruck. Dean smiled and gave the Omega a tour.
"Here you go, Levi." Dean said as he set the plate down at the table. Cas carried Levi to the table and sat him down. Cas and Dean watched their son eating with affectionate eyes. Dean's arm was stretched out behind Cas, if he were to move it forward slightly it would be wrapped around Cas' waist. Levi ate his lunch with happy hums, his content noises were the only ones in the house. That is until the Winchester's returned.
"They've been gone for 10 years!" He exclaimed.
"That's what you want? Me to touch you?" Dean asked teasingly. "But I am touching you." Dean continued after Cas nodded desperately.
"A week and a half ago." Cas replied. The doctor hummed and a deep furrow appeared between his brows, he made a quick note then turned to the screen.
"How do you know?" Castiel whispered nervously.
Castiel happily swung the heavy bag at his side as he walked down the street towards his favourite coffee shop. He often spent a few hours at the coffee shop; he sat near the back in a secluded corner so that he could read his books in peace and without judgement. From his seat, he could see the entire shop and its customers. He noticed a few regulars sat sparcely around the coffee shop but there were a few people he didn't recognise. Like the handsome businessman stood in line.
"No, not that one. Main presents are at the back." She protested. Dean nodded then found and moved two smaller presents to the back too.
"We have quite a few TVs in Winchester." Said Dean, easily catching onto Castiel's train of thought as the Omega frowned at the device. "Winchester is more affluent than we like to let royals believe." Castiel smiled at the Alpha and stepped further into the room. "Would you like to be alone for a bit?"
"That means you're not." Cas replied softly, his tone certain. Dean chuckled quietly then slid Cas down off the arm of the chair onto his lap, letting his arm curl naturally around Cas' waist.
"Did that really just happen?" Phil asked, he was still in a state of disbelief.
"It is, are you ready to go get some breakfast?" Cas replied. Levi nodded excitedly and scrambled to the end of the bed to wait for his parents. Dean kissed Cas' temple then moved his arm so that the angel could get up. Levi curled into Cas' chest as the angel followed Dean down into the kitchen.
"I really want a BLT and chocolate milkshake." Cas explained with a shrug. Gabriel frowned and observed his brother for a moment then his eyes widened marginally.
"We got Cas some pull ups too, you know, just in case." Gabriel said when they all met up in the centre of the mall.
"Elijah? You said that you thought that Elijah was alive, Jimmy too." Cas said slowly.
"Dean." Cas said in a tone of warning. Dean chuckled softly and nuzzled his face in Cas' soft hair, his hand tightening. "Dean, Levi is right there." Cas reiterated lowly. Dean kissed Cas' temple and moved his hand further over Cas' ass, his large hand nearly covering one cheek.
The man's short, brown hair was greasy and flattened against his head, he had an angular jaw that was covered in day old stubble and plump lips. His bare torso was toned and muscular, his legs were muscular too and were covered in fine hair. Everything about him screamed masculinity, though his face was relaxed and youthful in his unconscious state.
"He's on the other side of the castle walls, Castiel, are you taking a guard?" Gabriel asked hurriedly, his tone laced with concern.
"Hiya, fledge." Gabriel chuckled. Levi laughed joyfully as the archangel tickled him. Cas watched them fondly, his hands subconsciously came to rest on his stomach. Gabriel caught his brother's movement and looked back to Levi. "How about you go play in your little kitchen for a bit?" Levi nodded excitedly and slid off the bed to run downstairs to his kitchen play-set. "Cassie?" Gabriel said softly to get Cas' attention. Cas turned his eyes from the door where he had watched Levi leave to look at his older brother.
"I know but how is it not hurting you? Hearing him cry for you like that?" Cas asked into Dean's shirt.
"Good Afternoon, Castiel." Michael greeted. Castiel gave his brother a little curtsy and smirked as they laughed. "Here." Michael opened the box and revealed a simple golden tiara with amethyst stones decorating it. Michael and Gabriel already had their crowns on their heads and Castiel could only assume that Balthazar was wearing his, since the alpha was nowhere to be seen. It was their tradition for Michael to don Castiel's tiara on him when the omega met them in the ballroom on the Day of the Spirits.
"Hey, baby." Dean's voice reached him and his eyes opened. Dean's voice was soft but Cas could hear the happiness in it. Cas stood gracefully and stepped into Dean's open arms. "I think I found a way to tell."
"Whatever he wants he shall have." Dean grinned. "How hungry are you guys?"
"How long is Sam going to be gone?" Cas asked, leaning against the counter next to Dean.
"I assumed Cas would have a way in?" He tried, though it came out as a question rather than a statement.
"That's Freddy, Eli!" Castiel corrected with a small smile. Elijah tilted his head and tried the name a few times. "And that's Bonnie." Castiel continued pointing to the purple bunny on the left of Freddy.
"What? Dad? How are you back?" Dean asked as they exchanged hugs, albeit a little awkwardly due to him holding Levi.
"Hello?" Cas murmured.
"Which one of you is Castiel?" Dr Ottoway asked. Cas tentatively raised his hand with a shy smile. "Nice to meet you."
"Cas?" Dean said softly. Cas turned to face the older boy and nodded in acknowledgment. "Are you sure you want to go to Freddy's tonight?" Dean asked, his voice was soft, concerned. Cas smiled fondly at Dean's question, a familiar feeling setting in his heart.
"Well, if that's the case, then I may be able to arrange home visits for you." Dr Ottoway said.
"Go ahead, Omega." Dean encouraged gently. Castiel turned to Mick and shook the hand in front of him weakly.
"Gabriel give me my towels and clothes back." She hissed angrily. Gabriel laughed and shook his head. Cas rolled her eyes then her gaze landed on Dean. "Erm... Dean can I borrow a shirt or something?" Dean's eyes ran over her exposed form and a small smirk appeared on his face.
"I wanted to see you again, I remembered how amazing we were together, how... amazing you were when we were in bed." Lisa murmured, looking up at Dean through her eyelashes, trying to look innocent and coy. Dean found that he didn't find that look as appealing when it wasn't coming from Cas.
"From Gabe." He announced before he ripped the paper and opened the box. "Aw packing peanuts?! I always wanted packing peanuts!" Dean joked, Gabriel chuckled around a piece of candy.
"Three?" Levi asked. Dean gave the boy a proud grin. Levi preened at his father's pride and turned his eyes to Cas.
"Cas? What's wrong?" Dean asked. Cas shook his head and turned his head away from his dirty shoulder. Dean pressed a gentle kiss to Cas' forehead and started on cutting Cas loose. Dean sat on his heels as he cut Cas' legs loose and looked over Cas for injuries. "Sweetheart, what happened?" Cas glanced down and his sobbing continued tenfold.
"Cas, listen to me. I know I messed up, and I'm sorry, I shouldn't have treated you the way I did when you got your junk back. I do return the sentiment, Cas, I really do and I'm working on treating you better. However, you did not betray me Cas. I promise you, you didn't betray me. That shifter used your weakness against you and it isn't your fault you gave in, I did the same with the siren but we can move on. We can just forget about it." Dean reassured gently. Cas looked at Dean surprised.
"Daddy, you been gone 2 Monday's." Levi objected. Dean frowned and looked beyond the phone, presumably to look at Sam.
"We'd need tools to break that open." Dean muttered to him. Phil nodded in confirmation then dropped the chain. Dean lead the way around the perimeter, checking every board-covered window, until he reached the outside play area. They jumped over the fence to check the back door. "It's a fire exit, not chained but locked. If we can get in this time then we can unlock it and close up the way we come in. Leave this open." Dean suggested. Phil nodded, he stepped forward and pressed his face against the cool glass of the door, his hands cupping around his eyes so he could see better. It was understandably dark within the building as he peered in but his eyes were drawn to the light streaming in from deeper within, behind the show-stage.
"What was that superhero movie you wanted me to watch?" He asked. Levi stopped his running and looked at Dean with bright eyes.
Levi ended up choosing Baby after nearly half and hour of deliberating. However, they eventually go to town and were walking down the street, Levi was skipping in front of them while they wandered behind.
"The springlocks in those suits are old, they're older than me. It takes skill and knowledge to operate them. Chris' wiggling and tears would have loosened them, causing them to snap shut." Cas explained. Michael shook his head again.
"Get Sam, don't tell the elders. Get lost." Without another word, Cole run out of the room to find Sam. "Omega Prince, here, sit down." Dean's voice softened and quietened considerably as he addressed Castiel. The omega was quick to follow the Alpha's orders but couldn't stop the shivers. "Are you cold?"
"We sleep in Daddy's bed, Papa say it make us closer to Daddy." Levi blurted. Cas hid his face in Levi's curls, holding the boy close to his body. Dean laughed happily. "But I want Daddy here."
"I'll let you get him comfy." Sam said softly to the crying man then he tugged Cas into his long arms. "He's ok, Cas." He murmured. Cas started to calm down in Sam's arms and took some deep, steadying breaths. "You good?" He asked after a moment. Cas nodded against Sam's chest then stepped back, wiping his eyes.
"Yeah?" Dean asked skeptically. Cas looked at Dean worriedly, expecting him to explode with anger and yell but it never came. Cas nodded hesitantly. Dean smiled affectionately and raised his hand to brush Cas' hair over her shoulder, Cas closed her eyes to savour the feeling and leant into Dean's hand. Dean's expression softened further and he leant in slowly so he could watch the angel's reaction. Cas' blue eyes bore into Dean's green and she raised her small hand to Dean's neck then rubbed her thumb across his stubble. Dean caressed her cheek gently then pulled her in. Cas sighed contently when their lips met. Dean cupped her face in his hands and let his tongue slide across her plump bottom lip. Cas shifted to straddle Dean's thigh so she could get closer to him as his tongue flicked into her mouth. She let out a soft moan and tightened her hands in Dean's cropped hair. Dean pulled away slowly and smiled when Cas chased his lips with a whine. "Wanted to do that for the past 5 or so years." Dean whispered. Cas looked at him shocked but it quickly softened as Dean leant their foreheads together.
"Not any old blueprints. The blueprints from the first Freddy's, the one we went to as kids." Dean explained. "I realised that we're watching the cameras, right?"
"Yeah." Dean shrugged.
"Thanks Cas." Sam smiled. Cas nodded and turned to get any toppings they may want.
"We don't like it when you fight with Mary." Cas said softly as they stood up and Dean's wrapped his arm around Cas' waist.
"I special?!" Levi exclaimed excitedly. Dean nodded and took Levi's hands in his.
"I'm thinking angels." Dean stated. Sam started to nod but then he remembered something.
"My dad, he asked Gabriel for my bank details, so he could send me some money." Cas said, still lost in his mind, replaying the conversation and the million thoughts that went with it.
"Yeah, but Daddy and Granny yell." Levi murmured softly. Cas sighed heavily and looked down at his son.
"Dean." Phil called out wearily. He could hear Dean shuffling in the room behind him but the other boy didn't reply. "Dean." He called out more firmly. His eyes stayed trained on the doorway.
"You know, Levi, Baby is much cooler. Daddy and Uncle Sammy grew up in her." Dean insisted, trying to sway his son towards
"I don't..." He started but Cas interrupted before he could finish.
"What do you plan on doing today, Cassie?" Balthazar asked.
As he had been told to do, Levi had turned on his nightlight and was curled up in his crib, his bed sheets wrapped around him.
"Something is buried here." Cas explained, gesturing to the mound in the mud.
The two Winchester's and Cas entered the house as quietly as they could but Cas could tell that the brothers were worried about Aether sensing Gabriel. Both angels had assured them that Gabriel could shield his presence.
Inevitably, his legs got too tired and the adrenaline that was running through his system stopped helping him run, his chest was heaving as he tried to get enough air to his screaming lungs. The alpha growled loudly as Castiel slowed down enough for him to be able to tackle the omega to the ground. Castiel cried out as he hit the floor and had his limbs pinned down by the bigger wolf.
"Not well, she took a more physically approach after I explained to her that I wasn't leaving with them twice and I'd told her that she was jealous of you." Dean answered. Cas turned around quickly, his hands coming up to cup Dean's face. Dean laughed softly at the man, his own hands resting on Cas' hips.
"Three more todays, three more monday's." Dean explained in simpler terms for the boy. Cas sighed and turned to Dean. "He's still a baby, Cas." Levi smiled again and began dancing again.
"Erm, Omega Prince Castiel of Novak." Castiel murmured. Dean smirked at the Omega's formal introduction.
"I know, baby, and if it is mine I'll be so fucking happy. But if it's not, don't worry about it. We can sort it out and then we can try again if you want to." Dean reached up and stroked his thumb over his angel's cheek. "No matter what happens, I'm going to be right here. I'm going to be by your side until you send me away, remember?" Cas gave Dean a soft smile and cupped Dean's cheeks gently.
"I remember this." Cas remarked excitedly. "It used to sit in the corner by the door." Dean smiled at his best friend fondly and turned another blueprint around to face him.
"Afton." Cas connected. Cas and Dan shared a look.
"Mick brought some friends from overseas and some are amazing sculptors." Dean explained. He held his hand out for Castiel to take then he lead the Omega to the platform.
"Hello, Jessica. I'm Castiel." He greeted happily. The omega in front of him was beautiful; her long hair framed her face, her eyes were kind and unassuming.
"Unca Gabe say I not have wings." Levi cried. Cas pulled him out of the swing and gathered Levi into his arms quickly, holding him close to his chest. He made eye contact with Dean, who had anger in his eyes.
"But there was nothing there. We looked. It's just a wall." Phil objected. Dean chuckled and turned to his friend.
"I know, sweetheart, I'll try to tone it down but she's as stubborn as I am." Dean replied just as softly. Cas leant into Dean, he turned his face to lay his forehead against Dean's neck briefly. "We should go on a date." Dean said suddenly. "When we're done here." He finished when Cas stood up straight again.
"They aren't dead, Castiel." Chuck bit out. Cas laughed humourlessly.
"You don't need the whole body to work out the height, you just need the femur and national averages." Cas protested as the phone got passed around. "They're definitely not Jimmy or Eli." Cas couldn't explain it but, being back in Lawrence, being back with his friends, back with more knowledge than he had 10 years ago, he was hopeful. Hopeful that he'd finally know what happened to his brother or hopeful that his brother was still alive, he didn't know. But he had something that resembled hope. Dan turned his eyes to the trees behind the building and a small smile played at his lips when they flicked back to Cas.
"He's worried about you. He was looking for you this morning." Sam answered. Cas sighed, pushing back the thoughts that maybe, just maybe, Dean loved him too.
Mark threw his arm over Charlie's shoulder with a grin. Charlie chuckled at her friend and walked to her truck so they could get her equipment.
he thought. Cas slowly walked back into Dean's room wearing the shirt; it was Dean's AC/DC shirt, the grey fabric was soft from years of being worn, it was tight around her new chest and fell down to her thighs. Dean let out a shaky breath when he saw her.
"You need to be a part of your son's life." Lisa repeated, turning to face Dean. Dean rolled his eyes and wandered to the fridge.
"Cas!" Said an excited voice coming towards him. Castiel turned to the voice and grinned. Running towards his table was his best friend and his best friend's little brother.
"I found something weird." She said. She arranged the blueprints out in front of her neatly then turned to the boys.
"Yeah! He chase, he monster!" Levi shouted with a laugh. Cas chuckled at his son and started to creep forward.
"Your son. We need to get him somewhere comfortable." Gabriel rushed out. Dean watched in shock as Sam and Gabriel lead Cas upstairs to his room. Dean followed them upstairs to Cas' room. Cas was laying on the bed, sweat was beading on his forehead.
"Yes, please, Dean, please." Cas begged, desperately pushing back against Dean's fingers. Dean sucked Cas' earlobe gently and pushed in a third finger along side the others. "Dean, please, I want you."
have to go? Why can't I?" Cas implored.
"We're having a baby." Cas announced with a wide, gummy smile. Gabriel looked between them in shock, taking in their happy expressions.
"Alpha, why didn't you tell us that we could be having a Head Omega soon?!" Donna demanded playfully, her hands resting on her hips. Dean chuckled and scratched the back of his head absently.
"Kismas?" Levi asked again. Gabriel nodded.
"Of course not, Cas." Dean lead the way into the house, collecting Levi on the way to his car. With Levi safely in his car seat, the family headed to the grocery store. "What are the rules for going out, buddy?" Dean asked as he got Levi out of his car seat, setting him down next to Cas.
Gabriel sat back and listened quietly while Cas spoke to Dean about their son. He quietly mentioned Cas' appointment and the younger angel hurried to say goodbye to Dean so that they could hurry to the opticians.
"I'm not a child, Dean, that doesn't work with me." Cas looked away from Dean, turning his eyes to Levi. He smiled softly at the boy, reassuring their son.
"But we're watching the cameras for
"Come on." Cas encouraged, pushing Dean towards the driver's side. Dean always found driving to be relaxing.
"Ok, thank you. How's the hunt?" Cas asked conversationally. Dean smiled fondly at Cas.
"No, the last I saw him was when I came to get you and Dean earlier, when they arrived. Why? What's wrong?" He asked, he tried to keep his concern out of his tone so he didn't alarm his son.
"Yeah, he is. And you can put whatever you want on yours." Dean said once he stopped laughing. Levi grinned at Dean then put bacon and cheese on his bun. "Nothing else?" Dean asked, hovering the burger over Levi's plate. Levi nodded his head once and followed the burger with his eyes. Dean carefully lifted Levi over the plates and set him on the floor. "Go sit at the table then." Levi climbed onto his seat and bounced happily on his knees. "Cas, Sam, grub's up." Cas and Sam hopped up and joined Levi at the table. Dean carried their burgers to them, knowing that if he gave Levi his straight away it would be gone before Dean had even sat down.

"Mhmm." Dean mumbled, he removed his arm from around Cas' waist to stir their food.
"When did you talk to Chuck?" Dean questioned, his face twisted in confusion.
"Then that's more weight on my shoulders." Dean shrugged.
"Are you ready to go?" Gabriel asked. After all round agreement, Gabriel took them back home. They got changed then Cas took her place on the couch once again while Sam and Gabriel retreated to their rooms. Dean smiled softly when he saw Cas on the couch then went to the kitchen to make himself a coffee.
"Sorry, angel, that won't work." Said a familiar voice from the shadows. Cas squinted in the direction of the voice and his eyes widened.
"This book contains every rule that every Kingdom abides by." Dean explained. Castiel leant forward, his eyes lingering on his own Kingdom's name before sliding down to Winchester. "And they are all archaic and stuffy sounding but it's our way and I like it." Castiel nodded in understanding. Dean nodded his head once then flicked through the book until he found the rules of Winchester. "Ok, 'everyone must refer to the Head Alpha as 'Alpha' when in the presence of company or outsiders, it is up to the Alpha to restrict the title further.' For me, I only expect the title if in the presence of outsiders or members of the pack that aren't close to me, I'll point out who my family pack are so you know." Dean started. Castiel nodded. "If we were to mate, this rule would apply to you as you would be Head Omega."
"Mom? Dad? Bobby?"
, that sort of thing. The only odd one is that the security puppet was designed to only watch and protect children wearing a blue wristbnd."
"I have a nephilim." Cas mumbled.
"You can tell?" Cas asked. Their voices were soft, they didn't want to disturb the calmness of the room.
"Do you mind watching him while Sam tells us about the case?" Cas asked nervously.
"We need to go back to Freddy's, see if we can find anything."
Levi spent nearly the entire drive whining and shouting, and Dean was getting close to shouting himself. Cas had been trying to keep the hunter calm with a comforting hand to Dean's thigh while Dean's hands were white knuckled on the steering wheel. Gabriel was trying to stay out of the situation, he didn't want to make Dean more agitated.
"I'll go get them." He said then headed back outside. "Dean, Levi, there are some people here to see you!" He called. Dean nodded and swung the boy into his arms. Cas lead them to the living room. "I'll go and get some groceries, I'll be back soon. Be good, lovebug." Cas said then, with a quick kiss to Levi's forehead, he disappeared out the door. Dean watched him go then turned to the guests in shock.
"Why don't you two go and have a bath before Levi goes to bed?" He suggested. Cas leant his head back and smiled softly.
"Mm, I'll call you." Dean muttered then he reluctantly backed into the garage. Cas rushed to the front door to stand on the porch as he watched the Winchester's drive away.
Castiel sighed and laid his book down. He turned back to his balcony and gazed out unseeing. He didn't even have to go far from Novak, he just wanted to explore a bit then he would come back.
"Ok." Dean whispered through the lump in his throat. He coughed to try and clear his throat then he glanced back up at Cas, who was breathing heavily. "Ok. I'll get Levi back. Then I'll go. Everything will go back to how it was before. Just like you want." With that, Dean turned on his heel and hurried out of the room. Cas watched him leave, his hand reaching out to him, and tears began to fall again. Anger still coursed through his system but it was now coupled with an overwhelming sense of dread and fear; yes, he was angry but he didn't want to lose Dean. He hoped that this just meant that Dean would wait for him to cool down but the slam of the bunker door gave him the feeling that maybe he'd upset Dean more than he had intended to.
"Here you go, brother." Gabriel said, handing Cas a credit card and a phone. Cas smiled gratefully and pocketed them. The brothers embraced quickly while Sam strapped Levi into his car seat.
"Levi?! You want Daddy to catch me?!" Cas shouted breathlessly. Levi laughed and clapped loudly. Cas went to turn so he could get an advantage but Dean reached out and pulled Cas to his chest. Cas screamed with a laugh and struggled uselessly against the hunter's hold. Cas' knees gave out and he started to fall to the floor but Dean held him tightly. The hunter leant down and began to pretend to eat Cas' neck. The angel giggled loudly and wiggled, trying to get out of Dean's grasp. Dean chuckled to himself and pulled the angel closer so he could reach his neck, making the same 'nom' noises as he had with Levi. Cas tried to dead-weight himself but Dean just followed him to the floor. Levi ran over to his parents and picked Cas' arm up so he could pretend to eat his father too. Cas laughed loudly, trying to get away from their mouths. "Stop! Please, please, Dean! No, ah Levi." Cas shrieked. He started to shuffle away from Dean since the hunter was distracted with 'eating' his neck. However, Dean noticed his attempted escape so he straddled Cas' thighs to stop him from moving. Levi giggled and scrambled over to Cas, moving to sit on his father's stomach. "Are you done?" Cas asked, trying to catch his breath. Dean smiled down at Cas and wrapped his arms around the little boy in front of him. Cas’ eyes softened as he looked at the boys who were looking down at him with grins in their faces.
"I haven't really spoken to John and Mary since the first day you left for the hunt, Gabriel is... Well, he's Gabriel." Cas smiled. Dean was silent for a moment his eyes focused on the screen. Cas ran his tongue over his bottom lip and glanced away shyly, an action that caused Dean to smile at the angel fondly.
"But they're different interpretations, the way I envision the story won't be the way it's shown on film. Besides I've seen you watch movies more than once before." Cas said. Dean smiled and nodded his head before turning back to the kitchen. Sam came down the stairs with his laptop and sat down opposite Cas, he saw the book she was reading and smiled.
"Do you guys want in?" Sam asked to the elders of their family while Levi finished his lunch.
"But I... You... No... I don't... No." Castiel stuttered, shaking his head in a panic. Dean frowned and cupped Castiel's cheek, letting the omega scent his wrist to calm down. "How do you know?"
"There's..." Cas trailed off, pointing his thumb behind him. "Basement." He finished lamely. Charlie's frown deepened and her eyes flicked between the boys.
"I'd like that." Cas smiled. Dean grinned widely then leant down to press a sweet kiss to Cas' lips.
are you?" Dean asked. Cas grinned at the man.
"We know you guys said that you didn't want us to get you anything but got you things anyway." Dean said handing the elders their presents. Bobby took his two, and John and Mary took their three. Mary opened her's first, she received some lore books off Sam and candles off Cas, which made her laugh.
