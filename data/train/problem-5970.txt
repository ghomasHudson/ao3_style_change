Sympathy notwithstanding, his blood began to simmer, protectiveness flaring inside him. “She’s your daughter, Howard, she’s not one of your experiments!”
“Sorry, Steve,” Peter apologized, whispering now, and it never failed to amuse her how the child couldn’t master volume regulation on his whispers either. “When are we waking Mommy up? Can I do it?”
Steve choked a little on a sound that was half a laugh and half a splutter. Having heard Toni speak to the kid, all fluent, sexy Spanish, he was pretty sure that the child didn’t speak English, but his Ma had always said that little pitchers had big ears. Granted, she had always been referring to him when she said it, but that was beside the point.
He pinned her with a suspicious look, but as the person kept calling for him, he stood up. “You won’t try to go to your lab?” he double-checked. “You’ll rest until I come back?”
“What’s he even doing here?” she eventually managed to ask, casting a helpless glance the way they had come. The way that led to the man who had destroyed her as a child, and then haunted her as a ghost through most of her adulthood.
Terror made them pale and a little green, and Toni watched in detached amusement as one of the three dropped to his knees in supplication. As if that would save him now.
Anyways Stephanie’s opinion of the pilot dropped even further when he fell asleep in the passage and well some wind storm, or sand storm struck and Stephanie did her best to protect her crew, herself, and her cargo. Though in the end of the debacle she was quite stuck, lodged sideways in the Suez canal. She was even more uncomfortable than before. She was wider than the canal, and while Brock was blaming everyone else.
Rhodey, while skeptical, was supportive of Tony’s desire to exercise. With ample forewarning, Tony agreed to let Rhodey take him to a nearby Air Force base at an ungodly hour. While Tony protested a bit - Air Force isn’t the same as Army - Rhodey adamantly assured him he’d get more out of training with his guys than what any Army general could do.
He grumbled to the armor as Jarvis rebooted. He needed to make the suit waterproof. The under suit was chafing his backside. With it still damp it was very hard to remove so Tony decided to head down to the water to get it off, and drape it on one of the flat rocks that dotted the beach.
Steve was going to object that he wasn’t trying to become an engineer, but Victor’s statement struck a chord, maybe he was going about this the wrong way? Could it be that Sam had been right?
He kept his tutor, and at first, Tony was a bit possessive, insisting they do the math tutoring at the YMCA so he could keep up with his exercise and the renovations. Steve had a harder time with Tony right there as he studied, and while Tony did his best not to snort at how basic this was he was very vocal in his body language. Victor fixed this by bringing his partner in to keep Tony busy while they resumed math.
Tony repressed a shiver. He could feel that cute pill’s eyes on him. He would be strong in the face of Ty’s attempts to sway Tony, not like Tony could go anywhere, anyways but being a shelf lower than Ty really helped. Right now he could still hear him but eventually the mutterings from below. The health shelf would drown Ty out, thankfully. Middle shelf next to the cute rucked up lozenge was the best spot in the cabinet.
The Selkies started to sing, as the fireworks ended and a lady rose from the ocean wearing a lovely steel grey fur coat. She grinned as she approached Tony.
He must have dosed in the cage because he woke with a start colder than before and the tent flap was open and he could hear someone talking and then the man in the red and gold armor tramped in followed by the red haired child, holding a platter of food.
“Steve, they like it because it feels good, they have a nice relationship with the girls. I’m hoping we’ll have one too.”
If that was even possibly Steve was pretty underwhelming. His whale tale was skinny, his tsum tum was concave, he looked sickly. He pushed forward, kicking the water with his frustration.He could see some of the floating bits of debri from the explosion, he gathered up some of the flotsam, using the rope bits he found along the way and picked through the salvage. He found a dingy with a tool box in it. That was the best find, he dumped the stuff he’d been dragging along.
Steve wanted it to matter, he wanted to provide Bucky that safe haven in the tower, only for Bucky to slip away again, was this how Buck felt when Steve would slip away? To get into another fight? The anxiety and worry about what if?
“Sometimes, we’re aren’t good at something. I will probably never understand poetry. Shame because my partner loves it. I want to celebrate his likes too but it doesn’t mean I have to be a poet.”
Cap tsum inquired about his own gift, everything had been so thoughtful, naturally he was curious. Iron tsum remained mum.
It was worth it hearing Tony complain that he didn’t need an English tutor, but failing to remember what an oxford comma was and just comma splices everywhere, he retorted, “This is why I have JARVIS.” Incidentally Tony was equally put out that the English tutor was also buff, and gave him a work out on the courts, as well. Sometimes when Steve finished early he would come and watch Tony run around. More like ogling but it was fine Victor never said anything.
Steve shook his cage annoyed he was essentially a caged slave. While he found himself enjoying Tony’s company more and more. The desire to be free, was his goal. Tony turned towards him. Steve had been right Tony was masturbating, rubbing the oil over his length as he talked to Steve. Tony’s red lips parted as he moaned Steve’s name while Tony rubbed his cock. Steve flushed it was everything he desired, but so shameful. He turned his body away to give Tony privacy.
“What’d your ma tell ya about eavesdroppin’?” Bucky demanded, eyes reproachful as he cut in. It made Steve feel like a kid again, as the instigator of most of the trouble him and Buck got into, contrary to popular opinion. “And what are ya doin’, skulking around insteada just counting sheep or somethin’ like a normal person? I know the serum helps and all, but ya still gotta get a solid six, Stevie, it may not seem like...”
And it went without saying that Rhodey knew exactly how graceless the emotions inside Toni ran when he left.
But watching him figure out that Steve was irretrievably in love with him? Not so much awe inspiring as it was completely terrifying. More so than anything else in his life.
It's a raw spot and being formal and professional really did help him get over the realization and despair of bucky being alive, that behavior definitely put him in a bad spot team wise. He’s the leader and every one seems reluctant to talk to him. Bruce is wary for some reason and Tony doesn’t even chat with him much anymore. Though that was probably with the accords fiasco luckily nothing came of it.
“He asked that I didn’t tell you until later, This has been very hard for me. But it's fine now, he’s been broken free of Hydra. The reason I asked about you two is because he has mentioned you sometimes and he gets this face. I get the feeling he’s still in love with you. I’m selfish and I wonder what my role will be when he returns.”
Tony offered a small but genuine smile as he patted the bed beside him and the Tsums moved out of the way, still watching Steve though. Maybe the cold gaze had been more hopeful. He sat next to Tony and let the tsums cuddle up to him, Tony leaned on him.
At any one of these locations, Tony would enjoy a workout with limitless interesting options, flawless machinery, fresh air, and clean equipment. At any one of these locations, Tony would risk Steve finding out about his new proclivities, and Tony wasn’t ready for any sort of a reveal yet, not when he was still in the miserable shape he was in.
“I was sure this place was just made up in that song,” he deadpanned to a disinterested receptionist.
They finally got back to the matter at nub, Tony's gift which was a jacket with a huge pouch ment for a cat but clearly in this application it was for tsums. Human Tony was a big fan of just having tsums so this made sense they could be with him while he did other things. The pouch was big enough to fit all the spider tsums which was good.
Steve was asking questions now, too, and with Tony’s even poorer sleep habits, it was nearly impossible not to be crabby and defensive when Steve asked where he went every morning. Tony sometimes shot back with an immature retort, a snide comment about how Steve’s schedule had changed too, and when the arguments grew from hot to fiery, they went their separate ways.
“Tony, good to see you. I’ve set up a path for you to follow, it will take you to the westerly sea. They have those steam boats!”
They exchanged a look that Tony could only equate to love, which he desired for himself. He held the bag gingerly feeling the warmth, ducking his head when Ana puckered up.
The vampire spook again as he tilted his head towards the scene where Rumlow was back peddling on the coat, while also implying that Tony cheated. The onlooking crowd was a mix of human and Fae so Rumlow tried to incriminate Tony he would also be outing himself so he was keeping rather quiet on that front. The vampire whispered something not so quietly to his companion and soon the rest of the crowd was shouting variants of ‘give him the coat’.
All Bucky and Sam knew was throught the trip Steve was wasting his time probably trying to tell them how stupid this endeavor was. Steve didn’t trust easily, and when Sam shrugged and Bucky frowned Steve had started to pout.
He could blame his attitude on the lack of sleep, but if Tony was being honest, he knew it was the hurt he felt over Steve’s cheating.
“I don’t think anyone would object to that. I hope this works out. Still think it's crazy that you don’t need to take any prerequisites. When I was a student, I had to take humanities and speech.”
The tiny lozenge waved one side of his wrapper in return. Tony felt his contents shift, the cute lozenge was named Steve! Peter was a miracle worker!
Iron tsum rubbed against him, urging Cap to help him mint up the gifts that he’d bought. Their own personal touch, tsum musk.
He fiddled with a pad of paper as Pepper listed them being found in a rat cage, one was missing a leg, and the other seemed to have blunted teeth.
Steve nodded his head agreeing with Mrs Marvel, as he’d always known Rumlow was more of a show off. It would make sense that his muscles were also that.
Tony sat on the beach far enough to be away from the waves, but close enough that Steve didn’t have to do the worm for much longer. Tony thought the seal land movement was adorable, Steve pulled himself into Tony’s lap and flopped down with a sigh. Tony pet his back as the fireworks started, making good on Steve’s requests and telling how soft and smooth he was. Very pretty the prettiest, like spun silver and cold cast aluminum. The metal analogies got Steve to lift up his head and snort at him.
Tony closed his eyes as Steve pressed the fig into his lips. He tolerated the kiss, feeling lingering heat in his cheeks as he accepted another salmon slice. They continued to feed each other and Steve was getting warm fuzzy feelings. His eyes drooped.
“So if you aren’t dating that man, why are you gone so much? Why are you so tired, and taking not-so-secret phone calls?” Steve asked, almost relieved but still very much confused.
Steve nodded languidly, Bucky did have a very talented tongue. It was good Tony could experience it. He wanted Tony to look at him though so he squeezed down on the dick and Tony shuddered, eyes flicking back up to him.
Tony lunged over the back of the couch to yank the remote out of Clint’s grubby mits, He tugged and fell ass over the kettle onto the couch and then floor. Clint twisted the remote away while wiggling, Tony hooked one of his legs over Clint’s side pinning the archer for a short minute. After a deafening fart that had Tony stunned he managed to flip Tony over in his arms and deposit him on the couch.
Bucky was cackling as he settled back into the bag out of the way, the side of his wrapper bopped Steve in the head.
“Yeah he flirts like he breathes, mmm that would be nice. You don’t have to do this for me though Tony.”
Tony spoke one night with his back turned to Steve he was doing something. Steve wasn’t sure what but at the same time didn’t want to know. Tony was nearly naked and he was using oils, and it didn’t take a wild imagination to figure out what he was doing.
“Explain.” Rhodey prompted, and for the first time, Tony’s stomach sank. In all honesty, Tony was just throwing proverbial darts at the wall, and trying to be as dramatic about it as possible to justify the ominous feeling he had. But, if Rhodey was willing to hear him out, maybe there was some merit to this fear after all.
“Damn it, Steve.” She gritted her teeth as he teased her with slow thrusts. The drag of his cock, hot, hard and throbbing inside her, was enough to drive her nearly out of her mind. “Please, c’mon. Need you to fuck me. Need to feel it, feel you.”
She blanched at the thought of basically living with her father again. “Can’t you make up a reason to keep him here?” she asked, not caring how desperate she knew she sounded. Even in the mansion, there had never been enough space between her and her father, and she would be damned if she let him anywhere near Peter or the home she had built.
At least Natasha had always known she was an asset; Toni had been brought up to know she was an asset, act like she was a spoiled rich girl, and think that she was nothing more than an irksome bug. And if the rumours about Howard Stark were to be believed, that last one had been a particular pleasure of his to enforce.
“Not your fault, Steve,” Howard waved his words away, a look of angry disdain twisting his features into something unpleasant. “Toni’s been a problem since childhood that I could never quite fix. I’m not surprised she grew up to be the kind of fuck-up I knew she would be.”
It was a combination of his reluctant empathy and the immovable certainty that Toni would give him her disappointed look (more lethal than any of theirs for how rare it was) that kept him acting semi-gentle with the Captain. As the man identified himself and the suit flashed blue in acceptance thereof, though, Rhodes had the distinct feeling that nothing would help either of them when they saw what was stored on the suit’s servers.
“You’re right,” he rasped, taking a different approach to his usual one and feeling his heart break a little more when his lover only flinched slightly in acceptance. “Peter saw you knock your father flat on his ass. Peter will live the rest of his life knowing you’re capable of that.” Pausing deliberately, he gently urged her face up to look at him. Only when he was sure she was listening, did he continue. “He will live the rest of his life knowing that you’re capable of taking on anyone, even your own father, in order to stand up for him. He will live the rest of his life knowing that there is
The glance he’d exchanged with Rhodes had given Bucky an opportunity to take stock of his surroundings, and the waning light was the first thing he noticed. It sent a spike of apprehension through him, wondering as he was whether they would be able to get much done without the benefit of 20/20 sight, but for the moment, he kept working.
Howard Stark. A feeling of foreboding curled in his gut and he couldn’t stop the way his mind automatically leaped to bad case scenarios; and that unexplained bruise she’d been sporting when he’d gone to her room all those months ago.
So that was what Bucky did whenever he felt his protective instincts turning him into a basket case. He focused on what he could do, and he did it to the best of his ability. In this case, that meant removing rubble and debris without care for anything other than his end goal; getting to Toni.
“You know you’re not supposed to come to the workshop without one of the others, sweet pea,” she whispered softly to him, pointedly keeping her back to her father and ignoring his muttered obscenities. “Where’s Steve?”
Shaking his head in an attempt to shake off the amazement, Steve replied, “Just peachy, uh… Shellhead.” He grinned to show that he meant the nickname with affection. “If you count out the fact that we got shot at multiple times.”
Halfway through the song, Peter’s breathing evened out, and though she knew that he was asleep, Toni still finished the lullaby. She vaguely recalled her mother explaining, once, that the lullaby was magic, meant to imbue a mother’s love and protection to her little bambina. At the time, Toni had been but a baby girl herself, and yet even when she knew better, the lullaby had always made her feel safe and loved. She hadn’t yet explained the meaning of the words to Peter, in the way that her mother had, but it seemed to have the same effect on him.
Okay, so it wasn’t a spectacular defense. Fine, maybe it wasn’t even much of a defense at all – sort of like saying
And it was only after the battle had been won, that he’d realized what a brilliant friend he’d acquired, too…
Blue, robotic eyes fell on him, feeling bizarrely as though they were speculating on him. Evidently, though, the soldier decided against whatever he was thinking, and instead simply shot him the same, customary lazy salute that Steve had begun to associate with him. “You got it, Winghead,” he agreed, predictably, and before they could continue their conversation, their ride was there.
He returned her smile, shaking his head fondly at the familiar words and gesture, but started toward the tent entrance to see who needed what from him this early in the morning.
For the first time in her life, she had been accepted. Clint’s family had not only opened their arms to her, as Clint himself had, but they’d loved her in a way that she’d been trained to think of as weak, except… well, it hadn’t seemed like a weakness when she’d been faced with it. To her, it seemed to be an immeasurable strength to be able to find love in their heart for one whose hands were stained so deeply in blood red, as hers were.
He became surer in his conviction the longer he stood watch over Peter, helpless to do anything against the fitful rest and small whimpers that occasionally left the child’s mouth. Thor had so hoped that regaling the boy with a tale of one of their battles before his nap would provide some reassurance; would, at the very least, serve as a reminder that his parents were Avengers and heroes and warriors of the highest order, and thus capable of surviving far more than a mere earthquake; but it seemed that the fear had followed the child into sleep. Curling his fists in frustration, Thor aimed a stormy blue gaze out the window, set off in the distance as he wished fervently for Heimdall’s power of Sight. If he could just see Toni, just know that she was alive, then he would be far better equipped to shelve his own fear and worry and deal with Peter’s.
“I think I would just be very happy that he didn’t get hurt, honey,” she told him, sensing the importance of remaining within the parameters of the child’s question rather than telling him outright that she didn’t think his mother would care about anything else, other than the fact that her baby was alive and safe.
“Soon,” was all she said in reply before cutting the call, trusting that Nat would hear her just the same. She had plans to make, and backup plans to the plan just in case.
“My armour,” she answered in a clipped voice instead. “The guys who came after you will more than likely want the chance to get a chunk out of me, too, and in that eventuality, I’d prefer to have my Iron Woman suit on hand.”
For the longest time, Toni hadn’t realized that love and lust, when they were with the right person, could co-exist simultaneously. It was one of the many things Steve had taught her, and something she never got tired of seeing on his face. The way his eyes got dark, but also softened. The way his lips parted as his desire ran rampant, but also lifted in the slightest smile. The way he wanted to possess every part of her was something she hoped never to take for granted.
“They aren’t even considering that you’ll fight back,” Bucky realized faintly, and Tony nodded a little grimly. That assumption was the long and the short of what his entire plan hinged on.
Nobody. Nobody was to say, and Steve wouldn’t let them even if they wanted to, because he needed to believe right now that she would beat the odds yet again. Nothing less than that was an acceptable outcome to him.
There was a brief pause, within which Toni tried to estimate how long backup power would last on JARVIS’ basic functions, and she was just about through all the internal calculations before her AI replied in the affirmative. “My servers indicate that the Captain is already aboard a Quinjet, en route to your location, Madam,” JARVIS added.
“And what?” Steve asked harshly, helpless to soften his tone even knowing that his target was undeserving of his ire. “He told you that you needed to calm the savage beast?”
Though he knew not the specifics of the trouble, Thor had no doubt that Peter was well aware that his mother was in some sort of distress. Perhaps his certainty came from his own unerring sense of danger when it came close to his mother, but Lady Frigga was not nearly so courted by trouble as his iron clad comrade and Thor knew that it could just as easily be coming from him projecting his own anxiety on to the child.
Whatever Toni meant by that reference, it stopped the Colonel’s pointed repetition of the word in its tracks. “That’s cold,” the man commented, but there was a flicker of a smile on his face that told a story of the smothering relief he was masking, the same kind that Steve had felt when he’d first heard her voice on the Quinjet. Maybe a little less, though, because Steve was pretty sure he loved Toni more than anybody. “You know I’m still gonna yell at you when we get you out, right?”
Thor nodded and took the plate heading down to Bruce’s labs with a full grin. Clint looked confused, not sure if this was a prank or not. Tony slid up to Steve.
Steve stalled when his eyes landed on the holograms of an arm, was Tony? He walked over to Tony, careful not to crowd the other, as he looked over the project.
“No, but I saw you just kick that jar under the table. It's obviously big dick energy to take down that terrible peanut butter jar.”
The fish had been massive when he was younger but now it was maybe medium sized, and it avoided trying to nibble on Steve all together so he did his best to chase the stupid thing off by aggressively chasing and hitting it with his entrails. The other cucumbers thanked him and started to follow him on his journey. Which had been a bit of a moral boost for Steve feeling that he finally deserved the Captain title.
“This is definitely her work, the change is simple though. I feel the red witch doesn’t actually want to hurt people. She has enough power for far more deadly spells but instead she chooses this one.”
Tony didn’t realize that other Selkies had waddled up on the beach and were watching the fireworks. Not till one flopped over near Steve’s face, that he realized he was surrounded by seals. One that was missing a flipper was letting Steve use it’s body as a pillow, and another with ret flecks resting at Tony’s back. The red flecked one was eating something out of the seaweed sack Steve had been carrying. Tony snickered and looked back down at Steve, the fireworks were not as amazing as the Selkie in his lap.
Cap tsum was currently so overwhelmed by the lavish attention he was receiving that he’d gone all floppy. Iron tsum was right next to him rumbling up a storm as they were both tucked into the pouch on human Tony’s new gift with the rest of the avengers snuggled around them, the longest group snuggle to date. Iron tsum was too clever thinking of something Cap tsum had only dreamed of.
The tsums followed Steve around the room from the bed, it would have been amusing if not the circumstances to watch a bunch of tsums run from one side of the bed to the other. He took Tony into the bathroom to get him dried off. Fetching some clean clothes when Tony seemed a bit more aware of his surroundings.
Steve clamped down on Tony experimentally and Tony wiggled in response. It felt really odd but in a good way. Steve released his muscles and slowly made his way back to the clearing. Tony was still wiggling trying to find the best place. Tail stroking his insides so skillfully Steve paused in his trek to melt.
Tony huffed sensing that Clint wasn’t done but obliged to get the popcorn, and a short break would be good.
There was a thump, and he looked up briefly to see Tony smushing himself on the observation port of the puzzle palace. So he had noticed Rhodey’s absence. He shrugged and returned his focus on the two ferrets that were checking each other out.
So that was why he was in a bit of a hurry, full on running to his room before he transformed. The battle hadn’t run over but the debriefing certainly had. So doing his best to ignore the banter as he legged his way to his room, already feeling the tingles that happened at the beginning of his transformation. Tony was calling his name but he had to go.
Steve of course was the man with the plan, and after much dedication, he went over it with Sam. His chosen courses were Intro to Computer Science and Trigonometry. He’d taken math back in the day and figured that it was generally all the same. Sam thought he should just talk to Tony about the paparazzi images, since he didn’t see any difference in Tony’s face in the science schmoozing clips.
He sighed into Iron tsum’s side as laughter engulfed the group when Clint made a comment about everything smelling like mint. The vibrations of it were most pleasant.
Pepper looked alarmed, she had come over to see how the lab ferrets were doing, to Seeing a mildly panicked Bruce looking under things. In the play pen the chocolate ferret and bucky were playing with the tubes, chasing each other and then wiggling over each other in the tube and the chasing would start again.
Steve nodded quickly to change the topic to the latest baseball game, pleased with how his plan for mental betterment was going, and more hopeful that it would affect his relationship, too.
The human wasn’t aware that Rumlow was Fae which worked to Steve’s advantage, at first but she was really confident that the coat she wore was Rumlow’s. That also irked Steve but he managed to keep his ire under control, carefully weaving magic that would have enthralled just the right amount to hamper Rumlow’s free lifestyle. He wouldn’t be able to come around her area without having her advances and perhaps family getting on his case.
All this new tension bled beyond their private life, and into their shared profession as well, battles becoming tenuous and bordering on incohesive.
They had areas, usually the bedroom of course for the scenes, occasionally the penthouse kitchen and living room as well. Tony was brilliant with reading Steve, some days after a really hard battle, they would retreat and watch some show and Steve would curl up by Tony’s feet and be fed. Other times when the battle was not as fruitful and they came back with tensions running high, Steve would be strapped down and railed, with the Irondong mark 69 a toy of Tony’s invention that was monitored by JARVIS, and was extremely pleasurable to both parties.
Cap peered into the dimly lit box that was iron tsum’s workshop, no tsum there. Which was unusual as iron tsum spent most of his time in the workshop. When he wasn’t snuggling up to cap tsum. Or getting stuck in cables or tentacles which was something that happened quite frequently. Cap tsum blamed that on the human Tony influence.
“Bucky!” The other boat with a bird painted on it was chastising the silver and black tug. Stephanie found them rather cute, as a pair.
Which Rumlow had an issue with, because apparently he was aiming to steal Natasha away from Bucky? Steve frowned as he crouched over a tide pool, there was the purple urchin that Natasha loved, to eat but also fashion little darts out of to hunt and warn off other predators. Anyone could see that both Natasha and Bucky were in love and even if Bucky didn’t have a flipper that wasn’t going to change anything. Plus as much as Steve loved Natasha he didn’t love her in that way.
The finger pressed down a bit harder on Steve and he closed his mouth, excited about the possibilities of Bucky coming back.
Cap snorted, Clint thought they made the musk by having sex, and Iron tsum wasn’t going to disabuse that notion. ‘Let him think we get it on, he won't try and shoot us from his bow anymore.’ Which had turned out to be true, the rate of scary Clint and tsum interactions had dropped thankfully.
Tony nodded and accepted them and felt nothing. He sighed and bid them a good hunt as he headed down that flowering path.
Steve was wheeled in, he was looking around eagerly, eyes shining when they landed upon Tony’s form. Tony stopped kicking his legs and waved at Steve, Bucky parked him close by so he could see the ultrasound images. Bruce toddled in with his charts. Still muttering about the odds of cross species reproduction.
After art class, Steve knew he had to seek out a tutor for his other subjects. The math lab was tucked right up against the science lab, and was spaced out with many desks and chairs. He signed in at the front, listing the classes he needed help with and the young man at the desk asked him a few questions.
No use, he pushed the heavy body of the star up to the surface and looked around. There were burning bits of the ship and other land tsums complaining. He looked up at the sky getting his bearings and swimming for the atoll he’d passed by a day earlier. Using some rope he tried the star to him, and swam. It was very heavy and while Steve wasn’t certain where the star’s face was, he went on how the nubs were oriented. It was still breathing, that was good. Steve took another deep breath as he dove under the water, the Star was behind him on the surface still as he swam.
Back at the tent Tony had full sized blue lacy gauzy materials that he insisted Steve wear. Steve snubbed them, shucked off his makeshift clothes and burrowed deep into the furs on the bed. Coming up and resting his head on the pillows. Wiggling down and making a show of comfort in Tony’s bed. He wasn’t sure if he could match Tony’s flirting, but apparently he didn’t need to. Tony slid in next to him with a tray of food. Mostly things Steve liked, there were a few figs too.
While it was a curse he found he didn’t mind it so much, he would just rub himself off as a tsum under the moon and be back to human. Of course as a tsum he found the closet to be to spartan so, Steve accumulated things that he felt he would like as a tsum. The most cherished item was an ironman plushie, Steve felt terrible about it but as a tsum. Humping that doll was really exciting, and while he felt terrible about it as a man. It didn’t stop him getting all lusty with it as a tsum. He held some deep unrequited love for Tony stark and it seemed to manifest as a tsum.
Hawkeye, Falcon, and Bucky were navigating in a circle around a larger tugboat named Colonel, while chanting.
The white fur curled up even tighter, and Tony slid down the bars and landed with a soft thump on the floor. He climbed up the other side, pressing his snout into the cage from the safe surface of the side table.
Ok, so, he’d failed - big time. A militaristic boot camp wasn’t something he could endure in order to bring him closer to Steve, and he was sure it had done more damage to his body than help to build his strength to keep up with Steve physically.
He told Rhodey through text later that night that he wouldn’t be going back the next morning to the draconian training session, nor any other day of his life. It was probably a miracle that his fingers still worked to send a text after flipping over dozens of tractor tires, as he was too tired to ask JARVIS to inform Rhodey of his decision.
The top cover of their enclosure was removed and gentle hands came down to pick up a still sleepy Peter.
“No, we were together in the loosest sense it was a crime back then. We really couldn’t be out. Buck liked both men and women, so I insisted that he go out with dames. He tried his best to get me on the dates too, but I think the ladies knew. I was very awkward with them. Well until Peggy, but I think we can both agree she was in a whole class of her own.”
Steve really liked it when Tony would man handle him, though oftentimes to really do it right Tony had to be in his armor. Which Steve didn’t mind at all, unwilling to say that he had an armor kink on top of everything else. Tony somehow knew after a while, he was a genius, or it could have been his self incriminating sketches of ironman holding him down.
So for the movie night he spent his time in Tony’s lap and then trying to get under Tony on the couch thinking that would be a nice place. Under the full moon and with Tony on top, it made natural sense to the tsum mind. Steve felt that everything was getting very simple but he could hardly argue the point because he WANTED it so much and Tony was very accommodating to him as a Tsum.
Steve lowered his eyes trying to understand. Tony thought they were done? And he was upset that Steve was hiding his computer from him? And those calls were to a gym? Nothing really made sense.
Why did Steve have to do it? Or, why did Tony have to push him away? And, most of all, could he really prove himself worthy of Steve’s uninterrupted affections ever again?
Thankfully most Fae spells were open to liberal interpretation, probably why they were considered so wile to man. One statement could mean many things, cloth or clothes to the Fae it was the same. The spell lifted and Tony felt a bit lighter as Janet smiled and moved away.
Cap flipped iron tsum off and stacked him. Rubbing his face on Iron tsum’s shiny red shell. The trickery he’d fallen for cap tsum’s ploy. Under his plump cap tsum wasn’t a bad place to be. It was nice he could order the rest of the gifts for the avengers later.
Bucky sighed pleased that Steve finally settled down in the sling. Sam had always been pretty good with soothing the feisty fires in Steve. He was kind of jealous about that.
“Steve, I don’t know if you meant it but your tone towards Iron Man wasn’t good. His actions speak for themselves, but, when speaking to him or anyone else on the team like that, you can’t be surprised by their disregard of your orders.”
It was starting to come together, Tony’s worst fears, and if Rhodey wasn’t trying to dissuade him, it had to be true. In the past, Tony had been with people who weren’t faithful, and while it stung, he also knew to expect it. He tended to date those without any semblance of a moral compass, after all. But something like this coming from Steve, Tony couldn’t chalk it up to some dubious character flaw. This time, it had to be Tony’s fault. Something he did - or didn’t do.
Tony felt wounded he’d never intended his weapons to be used against his own kind but of course that was what they would be used for Obie was a right bastard. Always trying to separate Tony from his supernatural roots.
To make matters worse the Dever behind her lost power and was drifting towards her. Aiming for her broadside, she did have a little panic attack there. Stephanie couldn’t do any fancy evasive maneuvers they do in those hollywood movies, mostly because cargo vessels just don’t turn fast or move fast, but right now she was pretty much stuck, also run aground, and she was really hoping the tug boats could do something but, she already knew it probably wouldn’t amount to anything.
Tony shyly tapped her claw against the bulb, dripping water over it. She dunked her claw back into the canal and trickled another clawful over it.
Tony’s hoarse voice as Steve lifted the other up in his arms to Tony’s rooms so he could dry the other off and grovel for his terrible prank.
Steve offered his hands palm up realizing exactly what had gotten Tony in a snit, it was well deserved.
Tony grinned, as they left. He’d had a nub in the date. Rhodey had been tragically overwhelmed by the amount of dates he could take Buck on. Tony with Steve had let it slip that Bucky rather liked fresh fruit, and any space themed franchise. A netflix and chill date, Sounded like good fun. They had gone just a day earlier and they had gathered up some berries and with the help of human Bruce some plum wedges, Steve insisted Bucky liked plums. Tony frowned as he looked at Steve crafting another bunch of eggs. Time to help.
Tony’s armor retracted, and once free from the encasement, he looked furiously at Steve. “Well what about your computer? Every time I ask you about it you close it or lift it above my head!”
Using his shield he chucked it at the wrecker, buying Hawkeye some time to duck down on the fire escape, and get out of the ‘demolition zone.’ Iron Man was still flying around, firing repulsars, and sure, he did have the Wrecking Crew on the run. But at a substantial loss to their own team, Widow was doing her best to hide a limp, and Hawkeye was covered in dust and probably scratches based on the blood dripping from his hair. Steve had some shrapnel from the car in his body; he could feel it as he stood up looking over the damage done to the bank’s façade and surrounding neighborhood.
Tony groaned and wiggled out of his armor, he was sore but alive. He looked around the island he was on, very small and the surrounding water seemed calm. He poked Jarvis a bit, still soggy. His under suit was also still moist, and parts of it were shredded, but it was mostly intact. He dragged his armor towards the tree line and flopped down in the shade. He had not been expecting such retaliation on the ship. If only he’d sunk it and flew home.
A hand resumed massaging Steve’s scalp as he drifted, Tony didn’t speak up, and Steve was very hopeful that they could be a triad. If it didn’t work out though he was pretty sure he could live with just Tony. He flopped over on top of Tony rubbing his face into Tony’s chest
The colonel looked fed up but also amused and while Stephanie was sure they probably wouldn’t notice. She’d been wrong before and now stuck sideways in the Suez canal so she wasn’t going to second guess anything.
Tony was a bit miffed Rhodey had been playing with a new ferret, an all white one with blue eyes and he'd come back and with the trace scent of the other ferret. Rhodey seemed a bit smug about it too. Tony was the best therapy ferret!
Her bow was entrenched in land, she was fucking stuck good. Thankfully Dever did stop, though apparently they were sub tweeting her, Stephanie could only shrug. It hadn’t been her fault, she’d covered her basics and was now duitifly hauling out flag zulu hoping against all odds a simple tug could get her out of this mess.
He popped out of his package and shot off falling with the mathematical precision and knocking Steve back on the counter and himself. Safe away from the ledge. Steve wrapped his arm around Tony, as they cried in relife. Not noticing the ‘dressed for chaos’ cat lurking nearby. A white mitten reached out and batted the pill and lozenge across the smooth granite countertop.
He found Steve’s white shirt, the one with the little blue stars in the cuffs and collars. Steve had been wearing it this morning, during breakfast. He’d come up with a wicked pincer maneuver and had been dressed his best for Peggy. There was a hole through the center but no blood. Bucky folded it over his arm as he continued to search.
Pushing through, Steve entered the kitchen to see a very surly Iron Man, still in his suit and leaning against the counter. Natasha and Clint were nearby, but not close enough for an actual debrief. There was no food on the table which was fine, since Steve couldn’t eat with the tension in the room anyway. He let his shield-bearing arm fall, he hadn’t realized he’d brought it up subconsciously anticipating a fight. He couldn't fight Tony, he loved him so much that if he was happier with that other scientist maybe he could let Tony go? They could still be Avengers, he could still be near Tony. But before he could let him go, and before Steve could articulate anything Tony launched into a fight of his own.
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand hoping he’d spill the beans if he gave him the puppy dog eyes. Steve sighed
“It has been great, you’ve done a lot. You don’t have to attend every week, maybe instead twice a month. Maybe take this art class here as well?”
Bucky rubbed his eyes unsure, the potato held a resemblance to Steve. Deciding this was beyond his abilities, and that the potato was indeed breathing. He swaddled it up in Steve’s shirt. Peggy would have a better idea, hopefully.
Steve nodded but still felt bad about it, it didn’t help that the Tsum tsums were watching and judging him with their beady eyes from the vantage point of being stacked on Tony, a jury of his peers. Steve feels like he was found wanting, in their cold eyes.
There was a pillow fight, and Steve let Sam pummel him while laughing as Sam. Cried "I told you so!" and smacked him with the pillows.
Steve really liked caring for Tony and this would have been a big deal, if he hadn’t been the one to send Tony into some ptsd attack. He showed off the cloth and placed them on the counter, gathering up a fluffy towel and carefully helping Tony out of his soaked clothes and patted him down till he was mostly dry.
Tony sighed as he pressed shifted in his casing, he had the perfect view of the honey lozenges, he had caught the feelings for the one that was smaller and the wrapper looked kittywampus, one side had more of the wrapper, the other side was short that it reminded Tony of a sausage ending. He found it endearing, and that lozenges was pretty much always facing him anyways. Tony flexed his capsule watching the lozenges blush the wrapper taking on a purplish color.
The jar of miralax thankfully nudged Ty into the gel which really muffled his attempts at poetry. Which consisted of him reading from other labels and trying to rythme things to it. Not a lot of things worked well with ‘frequent stool’ and it really tested Stane’s patience. Reading other’s labels outloud was down right rude. Tony though had read all about the natural honey flavored lozenges, in an attempt to learn more about the tiny one.
Steve wiggled even more and suddenly the thick form of a seal was gone and the cylinder was gangly arms and legs of Steve holding on tightly to Tony.
“Can you put me through boot camp?” It was the first thought that came to mind, something Rhodey knew about, that Tony could possibly use to relate to Steve.
Tony did a little wiggle dance in the dirt it was rather endearing. Then she was back to packing down the disurbed dirt and back to digging a channel around Stephanie’s bow.
Even if Tony was pretty sure the idea of easter was not to hide the eggs in people’s ass. Which is what Steve had been trying to explain to Tony when Hawkeye had come in and cheered Steve on, with pithy replies as “he’s right you know,” and “tell him Steve,” Steve merely took that as confirmation that he was right. Forgetting entirely that Hawkeye had never learned their language.
“I don’t know. One minute, he’s fine, meeting me for lunch nearly every day of the week, movie dates on the occasional free weekend, enthusiastic in bed-”
There were still occasional bystanders watching from the windows, but with the sound proofing, Steve’s dirty little math secret was safe. It didn’t matter though, since differential equations was still handing him his ass every class. He liked to think he was doing better and his grades did seem to reflect that but truthfully, he was mediocre at best in that class. It did aggravate him but Victor had shrugged at Steve’s persistence to master it.
A little dejected, Tony wondered why Steve hadn’t asked him to join him, then remembered how much he hated going running, especially when trying to keep pace with a super soldier, and tried to pay it little mind. He would just have to make an effort later to talk to Steve.
It was probably going to be coconuts and those little tubers that Tony had found. He could try fishing though he was certain that he wouldn’t catch anything without Jarvis’ help and his suit was pretty much immobile.
“That was a greeting! His paper on filtration was..” Tony did a chef kiss trying to articulate how good the paper was. “Plus he’s like married.”
Cap tsum pushed back, puffing up as iron tsum darted away. He grabbed some yarn in his mouth and chased down Iron tsum. Very grateful that his partner was annoying him enough to focus on that rather than the previous not good enough scarf idea.
His role was to just tick Obie off just enough to slip up and offer Tony some clothes and release him from the contract. Thus releasing the house from the spells that had been crafted by his mother, and let the rest of the Fae in to seek retribution. He was doing a pretty good job of it just being himself, also Obie had a big issue with him being an unclaimed omega. Creeping in on Tony during his few and infrequent baths.
He was on his feet in an instant, only mindful enough to make sure Peter was still preoccupied with his toys while Steve took jerky steps away from his son. “Pepper?” he croaked out, his voice thin even to his own ears. “What… what’s going on, what’s wrong? Where’s Toni?”
Clearing his throat slightly, he tried for an answer. “Yeah,” he nodded, pleased to find that it was easier than he thought it would be to return her smile. His nerves steadied some in the face of her conviction, and if nothing else about Stark was endearing, he could at least appreciate that she was being decent to him right then. Even if it was more about her experiment than actual concern for Steve.
Also, shout out to Lily, the reader who wanted to see Cap apologize in Mommy Quandary. Your wish, my dear...  :D
Toni batted his arm away without breaking the kiss and slid herself closer, looping her arms around his neck. She rocked down against the bulge in front of Steve’s sweatpants and instantly, his hands snapped to her hips, clutching her in a punishing grip to keep her from moving. Almost immediately, he gentled his hold, and it made her want to huff a sigh of impatience.
“You need to get those cuts checked out,” Barnes blurted, and it was the most obvious deflection in the world but it was still enough to turn Steve’s ire on himself instead of Tony. “They need bandaging.”
Stark only laughed and threw a wink over her shoulder before leaving the tent. Steve and Peggy followed after and watched as she approached her father, beginning to ramble something before he could do so much as greet her.
She stayed in that position for as long as it took for her tears to dry – minutes? Hours? – before shakily rising and walking away without another word.
That hope strengthened a little when Iron Man responded, as prompt and battle-ready as always, when the call to assemble came in the early hours of the morning on day three. Steve felt relief come close to smothering him as Tony approached them where the Quinjet landed, but it was tempered when the genius didn’t raise his faceplate like he normally did. Or send Steve a bright, infectious grin and a snarky comment about how they were late to the party. Or stand next to him in that wordless way that told anyone who cared to look that Tony had Steve’s back, just as Steve had Tony’s.
It was telling of the affection between the pair that, despite his words and her hassling, Bruce still critically examined the work that the medic had done thus far, and ever so carefully began helping by cleaning cuts that hadn’t yet been treated by Kevin-the-stupid-paramedic (the amendment to his nickname well-deserved to Toni’s thinking). His exceedingly gentle touch told her volumes more about his worry for her than Bruce himself would have done.
“Everything okay, darling?” he asked her in a low voice as they broke apart, using his foot to close the door. She stayed leaning into him, in a way that would have made Steve think she was drunk, if not for the firm knowledge and proof he had that she hadn’t gotten drunk since they’d gotten together.
Then there was more screaming, only this time it was Bucky’s. His best friend. Screaming as his hand still reached out to Steve, still trusting, but he was falling, falling, falling…
Hobbling sluggishly towards the front of the jet, Toni figured she could keep company with Bucky while her lover and science bro rested. The former assassin, like herself, was a little more tolerant of sleep deprivation than the others, and it wouldn’t have been the first time that they’d kept each other awake in the interest of finishing a project or warding off nightmares or a flashback.
“What I need, is to keep a promise that I made to my son,” Toni stated with firm finality in her voice, when she realized that there was no option left but to be entirely blunt. “A promise I made to
After all these years, and the family that he’d managed to build, the archer had forgotten about the punch of pain and anger and loss and regret. He’d gotten soft, in a manner of speaking, and had gotten used to the feelings of comfort and happiness that had invaded what had been an existence dominated by darkness.
The first, was that the woman was entirely unnaturally beautiful. It was disconcerting for Steve, who’d never really done well around women in general, leave alone ones as gorgeous as she, but after a few moments of being tongue-tied and dry-mouthed, he’d just accepted it and filed the strange feelings she had stirred in him, deep in the recesses of his mind. No use dwelling on things like that.
After she’d given him everything by agreeing to be his forever, things had somehow just begun to fall into place for the archer. His family had grown, and not only biologically; he’d met Natasha and found a family in her that defied logic and expectation, given that she was initially meant to be his next target. Instead, she’d become his friend and partner, and then something akin to a sister. She was the most important thing in the world to Clint, next to Laura and the kids, and for the longest time, he’d just unquestioningly accepted that she was the only thing he would have to stand as his own family.
“Not happening, soldier boy,” she replied cheerfully, only her soft eyes indicative of the emotion of the moment. “Whatever we do, we’re doing it together.”
“What’s that?” Tony asked, a bemused grin lifting his lips in response. The sight made Steve’s own smile easier still, and a lot more natural.
It hadn’t been very long since the last scare she’d had; since an earthquake in Argentina had conspired to take her away from her family; but 8 months could have been 8 minutes for how fresh she knew it still was in Steve’s heart. They were still arguing during fights because the Captain kept trying to protect her mid-battle, and Toni knew without asking that her lover would be going out of his mind with worry until he was back home.
“You sound like you’re a really nice mama,” he told her shyly, burrowing close for another hug while she was momentarily struck into inaction. Smiling softly, she wrapped her arms around him and cuddled him close, allowing them both a single moment where they could pretend they were at home, hugging their own families.
“Yes,” Tony gasped out lowly, rocking against him and holding on to Steve like it would kill him to let go. “Yes, Steve,
Steve cringed, but took comfort from the way Tony squeezed his hand, and laid his free palm over Steve’s, where it still spanned his jaw. “Person,” he repeated dully. Not man or woman, but person, in general.
Toni didn’t voice the thought, because she didn’t think either of them needed to dwell on what could have been, but it was the unfiltered truth. She’d faced death so many times in her relatively short life that it no longer scared her. That wasn’t to say that she wanted to die; not at all, not since becoming Iron Woman, at least; but at the same time, her mortality was an incontrovertible thing that Toni didn’t feel the need to fear. Death, as far as she was concerned, was what happened to the people who were left behind.
Erskine’s questioning voice brought him back to reality, and even as he listened for the reply, he got none, save for the tube he was in being slowly opened and lowered slightly. There were hands – broad and warm, his mind couldn’t help noticing, not cool and small – and Steve leaned into them as Erskine helped him down. The ground was… a lot closer than it might have been before, but before he could dwell on that, he was being surrounded by people.
“Okay,” he agreed quickly, sensing that this was the best he was going to get. For now. “But we work on my definition of an emergency, not yours.”
The rest, as they say, was history. Rhodes had developed an inexplicable bond with the young Stark and in turn, she’d begun to tentatively learn how to lean on someone other than herself. He protected her as best he could and took on the role of an older brother with the way he was constantly looking out for her. The common misconception had always been, though, that the relationship was a one-way thing. What many people didn’t realize was that big brothers needed little sisters just as much, and in keeping with the metaphor, Rhodes needed Toni more than anyone could immediately see.
As he lowered his head now, his kiss tasted different. This wasn’t a marking; it was a prelude. Her body reacted at once, as if Steve had his own personal call to it, like a puppet on a string. Toni would’ve hated it, if she didn’t know that she could call to Steve’s body just the same.
At home, the first thing Tony did was to gather up the folder he’d tossed just a few hours previously. He staunchly refused to look at it, not now that he knew just what they were, and instead just put them haphazardly in place and relocated to his and Steve’s bedroom to wait for the blond’s stormy approach.
“Here’s lookin’ at you, kid,” the guy grinned, and Steve got the aggravating feeling that he was missing a reference. That concern took a backseat as Tony moved forward without hesitation and brought the man into a hug. A hug that was way too long and familiar for Steve to be happy with. “Now, I’ve got the excuse of working a case, but why are you slumming the streets of New York at 3:30 in the morning?”
see it, but I do now, and… and I know you’re with Coleman, I do, but sweetheart you can’t just tell me that what we have is nothing anymore. I’m not over you, I’m never going to stop loving you, and I can only hope that you haven’t really stopped loving me, because we’re once in a lifetime, Tony. You’re my once in a lifetime.”
at you? Why would I yell at you?” Rhodes deadpanned. “Couldn’t be that you got yourself trapped under a decimated building because you thought you could out-speed a fucking earthquake. You’re not that reckless and stupid.”
Understanding dawned in the spy’s keen eyes, and equal parts sympathy and exasperation clouded them over again. “You didn’t know?” she asked astutely, a crease appearing on her brow.
He cut her off by yanking her impossibly closer into his chest. Finally, she looked up at him, and as soon as she did, Steve caught her lips in a deep and possessive kiss. A small noise in the back of her throat made him deepen it, mapping out her mouth with his tongue like he was trying to memorize every detail. His hands were clamped around her waist and hips, proprietary because he could never stop feeling the need to make sure everyone knew that the amazing woman was his and his alone, and he relished every point of contact between her body and his.
“Peter okay?” she asked first, partly because she already knew without asking that Steve himself wasn’t.
It was a mistake that she still sometimes berated herself for making. How often had she delivered a flawless performance of her own, living the lie so that others wouldn’t question it? She’d always thought it a strength of hers to pick up on the act, because there wasn’t a trick in the book that she hadn’t already played, but Toni… she’d more than lived the lie. She’d perfected her lie so that it became impeccable, above reproach or doubt. Certainly, it had been months after their last meeting before Natasha had realized that she’d been played.
But years spent trying to keep a promise to Toni wasn’t easily erased. “Thanks,” Steve nodded politely, capping the bottle after draining the last of the water. He’d promised to be courteous, not particularly friendly. Without needing him to holler, Bruce dragged the imaging equipment to where Steve was, fatigue tightening his features. It was an arduous procedure, tossing out an echo every twenty minutes or so to make sure that they didn’t remove rubble that could potentially cause another collapse and take Toni out with it; arduous, but extremely necessary. Any more harm coming to Toni was totally unacceptable, and that was something all the men involved could wholeheartedly agree on, differences aside.
Tony had laughed at him, that had stung. He wasn’t sure why it had stung so badly. He wasn’t getting friendly with the enemy! He was gathering intelligence when Tony showed him that map with the iron clan’s territories. He was however handing out really good advice, but that didn’t matter because nobody could understand him.
He greeted Tony as he returned to the tent, waving him over as he offered the rest of the fig to Tony. who accepted it gratefully. Then made a show of eating it, which had Steve blushing and ducking his head under the tent scrap.Why did he do that? The fig wasn’t that good, must he moan like that? Tony, Steve decided, was a very dirty man.
Ah it made sense Iron tsum hadn’t figured out what to get human steve, luckily cap tsum had an idea. They could focus on that with all the other gifts ordered.
Tony was smitten; he let Steve show him around, Steve dragging him along. Steve was surprisingly strong. Ever thankful that Pepper had packed some money away in the clothing bag. He could pay for the little fish game that Steve was very good at. The little fishes were gifted away to children at the booth. Steve mentioned that they weren’t good for eating.
Knowing what was coming really helped and Tony’s response about Steve being a good easter bunny died on his lips as an onslaught of eggs slid into him. Some were cooler than others and the sizes were different and he was undone. Steve was rubbing and his belly moving the eggs around he could feel it, the toy was still lodged in his ass.
That's how he ended up at the door to Tony’s lab, it wasn’t locked and he was granted permission to enter. Tony had managed to recover Jarvis but the AI had been less communicative, Steve didn’t know the reasons but presumed that the mind stone had wreaked havoc on the verbal bits of the AI. Tony’s back was to him and he stalled, realizing when he’d run off to track down Bucky it had left Tony alone in the tower without his friends.
They settled into the grotto and both faces aflame as they spoke about their desires and hopes for the relationship. Steve was quite willing to leave the ocean as long as they made time for the bond assurance, Tony didn’t mind the idea of taking a week break every month sounded nice.
If it was best for everyone that they weren’t together, then maybe Tony would have to learn to let go, no matter how painful it would be.
Steve started to lose focus in battle, he’d manage to balance his school so well at the beginning but with Tony’s new questions while hiding the phone calls, and altered habits. Even if he was using Trigonometry in the moment of filing his shield, he never really needed math; he could see the angles and do all of that in his head. He did appreciate that there was math. Thankfully he’d shifted his focus on the real beast of differential equations.
Bruce got a onesie, and then next to it was a huge onesie for hulk in a giraffe pattern, cap of course asked about that and Iron tsum had just said ‘trust me’. Which Cap tsum was fine with cause Iron tsum was much closer to the human counterparts of Bruce and Hulk. Minting up the hulk’s onesie would take a few days, they could probably play hide and seek in it.
Thor swooped in and took a cookie off the plate and took a large bite out of it and after swallowing exclaimed how delicious they were and made eyes at the rest of the plate. Steve handed the whole plate over.
He was a trim athletic pill with an easy to swallow coating on his body that was flavored artificial strawberry, he was a bit ashamed of that. A childish feature, but at least the lozenges were also flavored. He’d seen Pepper eat them like jolly ranchers, So he felt safer with them. Also down here, he could ignore Ty stone better than the loathsom suppository that thought since they were both NSAIDs that they belonged together.
“I know but I figured it's not used to being this exposed. Want to give you some relief. From everything here.”
Tony decided to buy some fried fish, along with some shrimp. Steve didn’t seem to care for the fish, which was fine Tony ate it. The shrimp however were devolved and Steve looked ready to jump the vendor for more. He wasn’t sure if Steve was a merman, he wasn’t super up on the lore of the ocean folk and Fae, as it had been a forbidden topic at home. Not that Maria had followed that rule, but she was of the land community so if she had discussed the ocean it might have been when Tony was very young.
Tony kicked his legs as he sat on the cot in the med-bay, a lot had happened after being rescued by Shield. First off Steve had recognized the man that had come to save them, Bucky apparently had once been a mer-tsum. He was no longer and had been searching for Steve ever since he’d come back to his own mind.
No, he’d just never pulled a boat that could fit several land tsums in it. Maybe with the boat the land tsum would look at him? Steve breached and huffed, he needed some air. Thinking about the land tsum dancing in the water and removing that black skin. How the sea cucumber like tsum had managed to be graceful in the water. The way the star had moved their hips, the red material shifted, Steve frowned and he was cold all of a sudden.
Steve slowly patted Tony's shoulder as the other seemed to calm down a bit, he could feel how the trembled under his hand. He was kicking himself that shield file had something about water boarding in it. Shit, Steve had triggered something obviously and he just continued to talk slowly and quietly till Tony stopped shaking so much.
Tony was laying on the beach with an improvised butt-pug in his ass basking in the sunlight. Steve had fucked him thrice before needed to get some food for them both, he was ample in the middle. Made a promise not to remove the plug, but had managed to fix the suit somewhat while waiting. Jarvis was currently trying to reach out to shield, see if they could be located and rescued. Though Tony wasn’t sure if he wanted to leave.
Bruce looked up sharply at Tony, aware of both idiots pining for each other. He felt Hulk agree, which was slightly unnerving since Hulk wanted them to kiss already. Though his attention fell on the tsum in tony’s arms, being squeezed like that was enough to overload the thing, he could see it losing some of the roundness, and heading into floppy territory.
Raising a bruised hand, she sent the agents a clear denial of their help. Peter, whether he didn’t understand it, or simply didn’t care for it, didn’t heed the action, instead scampering into the workshop and making a beeline for her. He threw himself into her arms and she hushed him softly, trying to favour her knee and balance the child at the same time.
“You’re on,” Tony agreed, some of that softness in his eyes that was usually directed at Steve alone.
All the flashbacks here! Hope you guys enjoyed the other dabbles and the fluff, and for those of you who were as hurt by Endgame as I was, you can count on copious amounts of fluff from me in an attempt to make things better. Also, I'm about to post another fem!Toni fic that isn't part of this verse, but has a lot of fluff if you need it! <3
, took for me?” Steve balked at the very thought, realization making him sick all over again. “Because I do. I know
“That does seem like you,” her father sneered a moment later, after she’d turned back to her suit. Determinedly, she kept working, trying to ignore him. “Always coveting those things that you shouldn’t have. That you don’t deserve to have.”
Toni felt each and every movement like it was a lightning bolt of pain rocketing through her aching body. Her muscles sang with strain, evidently unimpressed by the pushing she was doing while dehydrated, and sleep-, food-, and oxygen-deprived, and her head throbbed vilely with the reminder of the concussion she’d yet to properly acknowledge. Her arm still bled sluggishly, seeping through her makeshift tourniquet at a slow but steady rate, and at some point – she wasn’t entirely sure when – she’d managed to split her bottom lip with all the gnawing she’d been doing on it.
She wasn’t aware of dropping her mug, and the subsequent crash as it fell to the common room floor. She was only peripherally aware of dialing Bruce, and the moment that Thor entered the living room, wielding Mjolnir and looking as dangerous as a warrior in the midst of his fiercest battle.
It was a testament, too, to the reluctant affection that Loki seemed to have gained for young Peter during these infrequent visits with Stark, that he didn’t scoff at the notion of Thor obeying orders instead of helping Toni. Instead, he nodded once, looking displeased and agitated. Though he understood the sentiment, Thor was helpless to offer his brother any platitudes. They had both been raised with the clear knowledge of how fragile human life was.
“Hey, c’mon.” Tony softened just as quickly, leaning closer and cupping a hand around his neck. The contact was like a hot brand on Steve’s already heated skin, and he relished it even as his genius gently nudged him upwards so that they were face to face. “I’m gonna ask you this one more time, because you still haven’t given me a real answer. What’s going on with you, Steve?”
Steve cut him off one more time, claiming his lips in a deep and possessive kiss that bypassed sparks and went straight into a raging inferno. He didn’t let go of Tony’s hand, but he did move his other hand from the genius’ jaw, to all the way around his waist. He pulled his love in close and tight, gripping Tony’s hip like he wanted to leave an imprint of his hand there.
, and suddenly, she was in his arms, silently sobbing into his chest. It hurt him all over again, especially now that he knew why she had learned to cry so quietly, but he resolutely held on to his girlfriend, gathering her tightly against him and murmuring a soft barrage of comforting words into her ear.
It was ridiculous that Steve had possessed and explored her body more thoroughly than anyone in the universe, and yet Toni still somehow blushed whenever he called her ‘baby’.
“She’s going to be fine, honey,” Laura finally spoke, her voice brokering no argument. Apparently she’d bypassed most of her fear and went straight to fierce conviction, which Clint realized he’d really needed to hear. “This is the woman that 99 percent of the universe hails as the most brilliant mind of the millennium. Some rocks and gravel aren’t gonna beat her, you’ll see.”
The sharp call of her name made the genius realize that she had paled spectacularly, her expression frozen in equal parts foreboding and dazed shock. Darting her eyes back to Steve, she saw that the Captain was in full-battle mode, not knowing why but recognizing that Toni did.
In the distance, Toni heard the sound of the Quinjet. Something akin to disappointment curled on her tongue, knowing that she would have to share her retribution, but it was her own fault for taking as long as she had to launch her attack. In her defense, she’d maintained the presence of mind enough to wait until they’d taken their captive to a place where he wouldn’t be subjected to what she was about to do.
“I’m okay,” he confirmed with a happy nod, snuggling closer still. With a gentleness that not many his age possessed, Maico touched his fingers to the top of her arm, just above the first stitch. “You got hurt without it. I’m sorry.”
As she surveyed her surroundings, smoke still dissipating in the air that reeked of firepower, she had to wonder whether they’d ever realized just how dangerous she could be.
“Clint,” she cut him off slowly, an almost dangerous edge to her tone. “You feel like telling me just why I can hear my son crying?”
Steve replied, the relief in his tone making Toni feel guilty for lying. But, she reasoned, having her boyfriend strung and stressed out and worried would not have been very conducive for a retrieval mission as delicate as this one.
If someone had told her then, that she would develop that trust with a former assassin, two world class spies, a mythical God and the famously unreachable Doctor Banner, she would have demanded they take a sobriety test. And that would have been before anyone said anything about Captain America being the love of her life, with whom she would adopt a son.
As he spoke, Stark listened carefully, and her expression grew more incredulous with every word out of Steve’s mouth. He found himself feeling defensive, and as he always did when he felt himself on the defensive, he struck out to be on the offensive instead.
With his Uncle Loki grudgingly following, Peter began to explain. “We’re going to use magic to get Mommy to come home tomorrow! All we have to do is wait for the magic time, and then wish
“Agent Carter!” She turned at his call, sending him a bright smile, and if he’d had any doubts, then the complete lack of flustering or enchantment he felt at the sight confirmed that he was there with the wrong woman. “Do you, uh… do you happen to know where Toni is?” he asked hesitantly, when he was within earshot.
When they absolutely had to come up for air, he pinned darkened blue eyes on her, needing his message to be heard. “Don’t you dare think that Howard Stark has any idea who you are, and what you’re worth, because darlin’, he doesn’t have a single clue.” His eyes were burning with intensity, but Steve didn’t intend to stop before saying everything he’d wanted to tell her yesterday, when he’d heard the words Howard had thrown at her. “Don’t you dare think that you’re the undeserving one in this relationship, because if either of us is, it’s me.” She looked like she was about to interrupt, but a warning squeeze to her hip kept her silent. He continued, “Don’t you dare think that you’re not every last one of my dreams come true, and even more that I didn’t dare to dream of. And don’t you dare think that there is anywhere, or any other time, that I want to be in, more than this one.” He smiled softly down at the love of his life; nuzzled against her temple with utmost gentleness. “Right here, in this moment, with you in my arms, this is exactly where I want and need to be. I wouldn’t ever go back, because this is my home, Toni.
He’d shown her that it wasn’t a weakness to give into her emotions, and taught her how to, in the same way. He held her when she woke up screaming against the demons in her head, and he held her when the pain got to be too much to keep from crying. He held her when she couldn’t stop trembling at the idea of her son being harmed in their line of work, and he held her when one of the team got hurt and she could barely stand for the guilt that ravaged her. He even held her when nothing more was wrong than a simply shitty day with an overbearing Board member or a difficult upgrade. And it made all the difference in the world.
With great difficulty, she cleared her throat. “Uh… I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to be in here.”
“Can’t I just knock him out?” the man grumbled to his partner. “I know the boss said to save the damage until The Captain was there to see it, but this is just fucking ridiculous.”
So instead of leaving, as he might have a few months ago, he strode determinedly forward, kneeling in front of the bed so that he was at face-level with her as she sat cross-legged upon it. “No,” he replied simply, the previous anger in his voice giving way to throbbing fear and sincerity and desperate need all at once. A need for her to listen and understand just what his mind was screaming at him. “Do you even understand…” he stopped himself abruptly, shaking his head as he realized how wrong a track he was choosing. There was fire in her eyes, lighting them a hot amber, but to his gratification, she didn’t try to stop him. “Do you know just how many times… how many hits Iron Ma-
So instead of yelling at her, he’d stripped off his MIT hoodie and threw it around her shoulders before settling on the couch next to her and asking her what she was doing there. Warily, she’d explained that she was a student, and in stops and starts over the following two hours, Rhodes got the rundown on Toni Stark, girl genius.
Tony shuddered at the encouragement, and it only took another couple strokes before the inventor was spilling all over Steve’s hand. His face, and that breathy little mewl of Steve’s name as Tony exploded, was by far the hottest thing the super soldier had seen in his lifetime. It would have been enough for him, too, but Steve learned quickly that it wasn’t in Tony’s nature not to reciprocate, as the man turned in his arms, kissed him deeply, and then proceeded to slide to his knees right then and there.
But after a while, the memories would fade to something fuzzy and the jagged edges of the fear would smooth out. They’d fall asleep every night curled around each other and gradually, the nightmares would be warded off by the sheer force of their combined presence. Steve would unthinkingly go on a morning run when Toni had an early meeting that Pepper would force her to attend, and they’d remember that it was okay to continue with the mundanity of their day-to-day without worry and fear. The first few fights or missions as Avengers would be a little more difficult to get through, but they’d do that too, because they were co-leaders of the Earth’s mightiest heroes and that demanded a level of trust that transcended everything else.
He wasn’t sure who was holding on to who at this point, because when uncertainty had finally sunk its merciless claws into him, he’d begun to loosen his grip, but they were still in the same position so Tony had to have clung back at some stage. A quick internal inspection told him that Tony’s hands had, at some point, found his arms, but all he really knew was that he was looking into the amber-colored eyes he loved so much… and Tony wasn’t looking away.
Realizing as he did that Steve was acting on emotion, Bucky didn’t retaliate, although the tightly sealed lips and clenched fists wasn’t lost on the Captain. Rhodes had far less grace than his best friend, on the other hand, and had no issue with flipping up his faceplate and getting in Steve’s space right back.
Of course. Toni would want to siphon that supply to the kid instead of herself, increase his odds of survival. Jim really fucking hated the honor in that plan.
Hey y'all! A quick thanks again for the warm reception, both to this fic and to the first in the series! :D I'm thoroughly enjoying writing this, so I really hope y'all enjoy reading it!
“I’m only going because it’s you,” she informed her lover primly, shifting warm eyes on him when Steve finally lifted his head to smile at her. “You’re lucky you’re so pretty,” she added with a playful smirk.
Steve flicked his gaze towards his best friend, hoping to warn him against any opinion that might upset Toni before he expressed them, but Bucky wasn’t even looking at him. Instead, he was aiming a wide, disbelieving grin at Toni.
They watched in relative silence as father and daughter spoke, bordering on heated at times as Howard obviously disagreed, before Toni finally shoved the papers and gadgets into his hands. There was a moment of contemplation as Howard looked between her and the things in his hands, and then between Peggy and Steve, and Toni. He looked like he was struggling to make up his mind, and Steve wondered what it was that had swayed him from what had looked like an outright denial.
When he finally couldn’t handle it anymore, he got up on his knees, quick fingers making quick work of both their pants and underwear. There were so many things he wanted to do in that moment; taste Toni, touch her, anything to make her writhe for him; but the need to make sure she was comfortable outweighed all that, and there was only one way to touch her and still keep an eye on her to make sure she was fine.
When the little boy did eventually drop off, the genius paused in her work for long enough to slip her watch off and attach it to his wrist instead. The device in the little wristwatch that monitored her heartrate and her O2 levels was still functional, and right now, she needed to know the kid’s vitals better than she needed to know her own. She already knew that she was struggling for every fourth or fifth breath, but with Maico asleep, she’d have to rely on her tech to let her know when the kid needed extra help.
As Tony devolved into disjointed sentences, vision blurring and throat closing up, Steve tossed the folder to the floor in favour of gathering him close to his chest. “Shh,” he hushed softly, sweetly, as he thumbed away tears and nuzzled Tony’s temple and pressed kisses everywhere he could reach. “Shh, Tony, hey, it’s okay. I’m here, we’re safe, I got you sweetheart.”
Just as a mutual understanding existed between her and Thor, that the Thunder God would not storm her with his boisterous hugs without any warning.
The soldier in the armor laughed indulgently. “Well, Barnes, that’s because you decided to go for a goddamn vacation before you could see all this brilliance come to fruition. Hold on, boys,” he added warningly, and Steve looked up to see a crumbling ceiling. Without preamble, the soldier fired what looked to be a missile at it, making both Bucky and Steve curl closer in an attempt to evade the falling debris. It worked as well as could be expected, creating a hole for them to escape into without burning any of them.
Steve’s breathless voice cut across whatever response Bucky had been about to make. Her boyfriend sounded like he’d been sucker punched; pained, shocked and disbelieving; but there was an edge of hope, like he couldn’t believe it was her, that sounded so achingly young, Toni’s heart broke a little in the face of it.
For his part, Steve looked completely shattered as he zeroed in on them, all but sprinting to where they were seated. Toni stood up quickly, automatically on the offense and wanting to eliminate the height advantage, but when Steve raised his arms towards her, she couldn’t help the instinctive flinch that drew her back.
“Your son,” he added teasingly, aiming to lighten the mood, “thinks that I’m easily confused, and that I need remedial classes.”
Really, there wasn’t going to be a delicate way to ease Steve into the fact that she was calling him from underneath a fucking building. On the plus side; gotta love StarkTech.
A special thank you to DarkPhoenix123, whose gesture of support was a huuuge help in getting me back to this work. Thanks, love!
Steve nipped her throat softly without warning, startling a breathy gasp out of her. “You’re thinking too hard,” he commented lowly, but Toni felt his smile against her skin. The arm that was wrapped around her waist tightened, tugging her impossibly closer against his chest; he was a solid wall of heat against her back. “Must be doing something wrong if you can still do that,” the supersoldier added musingly, teasing her by trailing his fingers underneath the oversized t-shirt she’d worn to sleep; his t-shirt; and swirling a senseless pattern over her belly and now-healed ribs.
“You’re right.” He nodded, even though he knew she couldn’t see it. “This is Toni Stark we’re talking about. She’s gonna kick my ass for even thinking different.”
“I know, I know,” Phillips forestalled whatever Stark had been about to say with a sharp tone and an annoyed, dismissive hand gesture. “You told me so. Born and made and what-the-fuck-ever. Give it a rest, Stark.”
“We’re being careful,” he promised lowly, ignoring her attempt at humour. She couldn’t blame him for it. “
In the end, it wasn’t megalomaniac scientists, or terrorist organizations, or Norse Gods hell-bent on world domination. It wasn’t Doom bots, or mutated creatures, or destructive aliens. It wasn’t even something out of this world.
Peggy rolled her eyes but smiled slightly, clearly fond of the other woman. “I need your help on a bit of a suicide mission.”
Steve was reluctant to let go as his friend pulled her away, but he reminded himself that Bucky had known her longer and they were friends (or more) so it was a good idea to let him handle this.
He swallowed, going even whiter if that was possible. His knees trembled where he stood, she observed, and he looked like he was about to start having heart palpitations. It intrigued her – what had they expected, when they’d made their move? To have her in helpless hysterics? To hold some sort of power over her? – and it also deeply satisfied her. For every nanosecond of pain and fear they’d caused in him, this was nothing less than what they deserved.
The genius nodded in thanks and wrapped the blanket around her precious little limpet. She sat with him in her lap and at some point, began to sing until Peter fell asleep; she wasn’t sure for how long she kept it up, but she did know that the Avengers had returned while she was still singing. Steve had taken a seat beside her, a quiet and steady presence, and it was only when they were both sure he was asleep, that he deigned to speak.
At the wobbly sound, Steve’s face rippled with pain, but he took a step towards her, arms carefully extended.
I'm so sorry for my lengthy absence. I've been going through a really tough time with some RL stuff that knocked me on my ass and then some... it took a while to get muse back, and get back to writing, but I'm back now and I hope the lengthy chapter makes up for my absence!
” Swallowing a little, because the knowledge and the skill wasn’t without its toll, he added determinedly, “I don’t like it, but I’ll use it. Especially when it’s for Steve.”
He could hear the returning smile in her voice. “Damn right. Keep me updated, honey, okay? I gotta go make sure the kids stay away from the TV. You know how much they love their Auntie Toni.”
For whatever his reason, she didn’t seem to care, and instead invited him in with a careless flick of her head. He eyed a bruise he saw along her cheekbone, wondering just how and when she’d taken any hit.
In fact, she’d been just shy of fifteenth birthday when a couple of guys, hired to kidnap her, had blindsided her coming off campus. She’d fought them off, sure, but that had been the first time that Jim had realized the true extent of the danger that Toni had been forced to grow up with and live with. He’d been aghast when he’d opened his door to a bruised and battered little Stark, but that was nothing compared to what he felt when she’d faced his inquiries with little more than a shrug and a dismissive response. As though it were nothing to be taken seriously because she’d
Steve didn’t think any further than that point before he burst out. “What the fuck were you thinking? Were you thinking at all? Or did you just get bored and decide to spice things up a little?”
The thought played on repeat in Steve’s mind; like a broken soundtrack that was interspersed with frequent images in front of his eyes, of Toni hurt and in pain.
He didn’t have much time to dwell on it before Howard Stark was approaching them, Toni hurrying off in the opposite direction looking determined and steady. She was, he guessed, going to secure the prototype she’d been working on.
His hands framed her face, brought her forehead to rest against his because it was easier to speak when he was able to feel her breath, every life-affirming one of them, against his face. “I wouldn’t have been able to tell you that I think of you every time I need a boost of courage on a mission. I wouldn’t have been able to tell you that you’re the biggest driving force behind me fighting to get back home. I wouldn’t have been able to tell you that I love you, God, so much that it doesn’t even make sense sometimes, because you would have been gone before I could say anything. And I wouldn’t have known, Toni.”
“I don’t…” Tony tried, and abruptly clamped his lips shut again, shaking his head as if he were trying to solve a complicated math equation. Come to it, that might have been easier for the genius to do. “I didn’t want you to know and feel guilty for not returning my feelings. I was happy just being your best friend, if that was all I could get.”
So, instead of giving in to her desire to say the word, Toni murmured a familiar phrase. “Maybe next time, honeybear.”
And there was just a hint of real insecurity, of real pain, in Tony’s voice as he spoke, but it was enough to run Steve through like a joust. All at once, it didn’t matter where the chips would fall in the wake of his truthfulness; all that mattered was that Tony understand that the issue was Steve’s and not his.
“Well, Toni and I,” Erskine amended with what looked like a pleasant smile on his face despite the pointed hint of steel in his tone. “But yes. We did.”
Toni frowned pensively, standing abruptly from her chair and pacing the length of her workshop. Wisely, JARVIS didn’t comment, and even DUM-E and the rest of her bots were exercising caution by giving her a wide berth.
In the month following the accident, father and son had dealt with things very differently. Howard had binge-drank himself into six separate cases of alcohol poisoning and used Maria’s funeral as a forum to publicly declare that it should have been Tony who’d died. Tony, on the other hand, had developed a miniaturized version of the arc reactor to replace the car battery, and subsequently realized that there were far better avenues of development to explore than weaponry.
He needed to be more like Steve before bucky and the accords came crashing down, and Steve wasn’t sure how he could do that. Before he found out that hydra had been living inside of shield, before he learned of the terrible things his brother had to endure at the hands of hydra? There was not going back but he could try to loosen up.
He took a bigger bite and was surprised by the flavors. He looked concerned at Tony not sure if he should voice the idea that his tongue was confused? Chewing on his bit he decided not to, the flavors seemed to work better after the initial bite.
Arms wrapped around him and tugged him back onto a firm chest. Tony opened his eyes he was greeted by a very naked human Steve.
Obie was sly, Tony wilted under the gaze, even with a few cups of wine he was still too sharp. Obie huffed and moved past to get the first guests, ignoring Tony all together thankfully. Tony made to leave and hide when Obie returned and announced Janet van Dyne. Who reeked of Fae, Tony froze she was seducing Obie for lack of a better word.
When it became obvious that Steve was too busy to talk or to keep the dates they had set, Tony sought out the help of the most level-headed person he knew.
It worked out amicably for everyone that Steve and Tony returned to their borderline-codependent status. Sam had practically crowed when Steve had told him he was right.
Steve made his way over to the tutor unafraid of the other’s stature. Victor greeted him happily and dropped the book quickly. He spotted ‘poetry’ before the book was swept aside, in favor of cracking open Steve’s textbooks.
“He gets a little sleepy, energy’s low, and you’re making it into something it’s not.” “I think he’s cheating on me.”
Tony’s rubbing started out with purpose but Steve rolled back into Tony and all of his control went to the wind as he rubbed himself raw against Steve’s sticky blue side. Steve was moaning softly as he felt himself melting inside his wrapper and joining in Tony’s gel coat. Smearing themselves around on each other a mark of ownership. Just thinking about his blue getting on Tony’s garnet and gold shell, pushed him closer to the edge.
When Steve tugged him to their nest under the couch he followed eagerly. Steve wiggled into the snuggling sock. Which human Tony had engineered to feel like a big sleeping pile. He smiled and then Steve did that think where he vibrates ever so faintly, Tony wiggles his hips in response giving off a throaty rumble as he stalks over to Steve. Who while still vibrating is flushing an adorable pink.
He looked over his calendar, if he cut back on some of his activities he could probably take something in the afternoon. Seems feasible. Now, to figure out which math he needed, he decided to see what the requirements were for the Stark Internship and use that as a guideline of sorts. Slowly, but steadily, his plan came into shape.
It was the grey clad warrior that spoke, gesturing to one of the larger tents. Bucky looks back at the youth holding the bird cage at arm’s length.
The excavator was turning more red and Stephanie was still processing the boat BDSM comment. She wanted to talk to Tony, she would answer this even if it was kinda close to her hull.
Though all this changed when Bucky was swept off their pad and tumbled down into the crack between the coral shelf and the open ocean. The current had been generated by a big fish and Bucky who had shoved Steve under an empty shell had been picked up and tumbled down into the inky darkness. Steve had been inconsolable, occasionally looking down into the abyss of the shelf drop off only to shrink away out of fear.
Tony blinked eyes aching slightly and he nodded while trying to hide the fact he was starting to cry. Obviously some eyelash had gotten in his eye.
Tony nodded standing up with his arms full of whine seal. He thanked the lady profusely and headed for the grotto while trying to avoid stepping or tripping on any of the Selkies.
Tony wiggles into the sock face first, relishing in how the elastic puts just the right amount of pressure against his sides. He’s wiggling against Steve as he twists around. Steve is still vibrating but it is intermittent now. Tony sighs when he’s oriented Steve rubs his cheek against Tony’s.
He pulled the bundled fabric apart, and there was a slab of smoked salmon about half the size of his body. He stilled in his motions trying to listen for his captor, but the other must have gone to bed because there was only the sound of breathing and the fire. He swaddled himself in the cloth and ate the salmon quietly, he got about half way till he decided to save the rest for the morning.
Clint took the other bowl of popcorn and fled the room. Tony sighed as the tsum was humping him, it was a bit humiliating clearly the tsum was very lonely and did Steve do this with the little guy?
Steve nodded from his tank, having been going over the housing improvements with Tony. Eager to raise his pups with Tony, with Bucky helping they would be fine. He dipped under the water quietly waiting for his turn.
Well if Steve thought it was hot Tony would let him continue this, and the attempted dirty talk to that could stay. The nest was going to need a cleaning though. The gelatin eggs were slowly oozing out with Steve’s careful attention, and Tony somehow he fell asleep during it.
It was nice to have some familiarity even if the art program was alien to him, some of the icons for the tools made sense. Though there were quite a few that didn’t, he spent most of the class making pretty gradients, and then gradients over the text, studiously following the teacher’s instructions.
