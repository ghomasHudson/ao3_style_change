“He’d hate that, and you know it,” the younger man chuckled back. “I can’t let this power go to my head. He is, after all, better than me in every way.”
Hours later, John Watson emerged from the surgery looking exhausted and a bit downtrodden. As one, he and his younger sibling rose, worry coming to a point.
“You’re welcome.” Watching the broad back of the young man leave his office, he rang Sherrinford. The veterinarian picked up after the second ring and patiently listened to his thoughts.
He nodded, showing his understanding, and gave her neck a small nuzzle. Inhaling deeply, he stretched, his back popping lusciously, and jumped lightly off the bed, making Mycroft snort in his unshakeable slumber. Shaking his coat out, he padded across the wooden floor and, rising on his hind legs, he opened the door, slipped out, and shut it behind him again. He had a full day ahead of him and not enough sleep to run on. Once the older twins were up and off to school, a nap was most certainly in order.
He could hear his quasi-daughter moving about the apartment upstairs. He wouldn’t have paid her any mind except that her steps were heavy, very uncharacteristic of the soon-to-be fourteen year old. She was usually so light in her tread, like she was floating on clouds, that it gave him pause. Enough pause that he was pulled from his Mind Palace.
“Ta!” she said, hanging up on the man she loved and setting to work. She had some serious cleaning to do.
“Dear Lord,” Mycroft hissed, tossing a handkerchief at the younger man who caught it with a laugh, “Have you no sense of propriety?”
“He’s exposed us all,” he stated, eyes narrowing at the device in John’s free hand. “He’s condemned us.”
“If he gets killed, the rest of them get sloppy and we have easy pickings. Don’t forget about your family, Girl. This is what we do. We Hunt monsters so that everyone else can be safe.” There was a pause. “Don’t tell me that you’ve actually fallen in
“Honest!” she shot back, beaming. “They’re becoming little people. It’s all about self-discovery. That must be true with your patients, right?”
“Well, I’ll be quick then,” he said, leaning back and away from the Wolf in what he deemed to be a non-threatening gesture. Sherrinford did not move an inch, a muscle in his jaw flexing.
John Watson had gotten some of his color back; for that he was grateful. The wound had also begun to heal, not as rapidly as if he were transitioning, but not as slowly as he would have liked. It was far from human. And therein lay the problem. Wolf bites, when not acted on by the Moon’s power, were painful and achy and notoriously prone to infection. It’d leave a beastly scar from it’s faster-than-average healing, and, due to it’s horrid location, could cause movement problems in the joint. T
“How are we feeling?” the doctor asked, a tight-lipped smile on his face, the calm but constantly watching Thomas in his arms.
The smirk twitched into a genuine beaming smile which gave him a split second to brace himself for the incoming impact. The young woman flung herself into their arms, wrapping them close together in her unbridled joy. He pulled her close, inhaling her wonderful aroma of fresh-cut grass, crayons, vanilla, gun powder and a bit of his own scent of chemical compounds. It was the most wonderful scent in the world in his (admittedly) love-addled mind. Unable to stop himself, he pressed a gentle kiss into the top of her head before turning his head to capture his Mate’s lips.
He clutched his eighth cup of coffee since the entire fiasco began, watching the rather massive Wolves pad through the precinct, one leash held by Mycroft, the other by John, probably fooling no one. Dogs just didn’t come in that size. He stood, grimacing at his tight and sore muscles and eyed the enormous, furred detective and what could only be his larger, natural born brother. “Morning,” he grumbled with a small twitch of his lips (A tired attempt at a smile), “Thanks for getting back here. I assume you want to see the cell first.”
“Did something happen, Mycroft?” he asked, the only one with the ability to read the statesman as well as speak at the moment.
The room was large - much larger than the one that he had at 221 Baker Street. In fact, he was sure that his room on Downing Street was larger than the combination of Sherlock’s sitting room and kitchen in 221B. The bed would be a nice change from his rather rickety twin cot in the spare room, seeing as he could sprawl in the middle without any of his limbs touching the edges. The window had a window seat beneath it, giving him the opportunity to look out the window for hours at a time, observing his niece and nephew at play. There was an ensuite bathroom, which was also very large in comparison to any logically-sized room for relieving oneself or for bathing. His brother, obviously not wanting to get his fur on any of the cushions or furniture, had a large, very soft-looking doggie bed tucked in the corner. Everything was a shade of off-white or light grey, which was slightly odd, in his opinion, missing the eclectic mess that surrounded him in 221 Baker Street, the Holmes family flat in Baskerville, and even the homes that he had been raised in in Germany.
“I’ll meet with the patients as they arrive, hopefully put out a few fires, and get them all settled before the politicians show up,” he stated around his mouthful of ham. “Will you be present, Mycroft?”
“Nothing, Evelyn,” Sherlock stated, his eyes fixed on her father, his head slowly tilting to the left. “Your uncle simply does what he wants, not thinking about the consequences. That is why, Darling, you should always think before you act.”
The crowd quickly fell silent, their curious gazes fixed on him. He allowed his teeth to flash through his smile as he came to a stop. “For those of you who are unaware of who I am, my name is Dr. Sherrinford Holmes, the leading expert on the Lupus sapiens species, the director of this Transitional Facility, and the only Natural born Wolf in the U.K.”
Three days later, he shivered back into his human shape under the watchful eye of John Watson. He hissed, feeling the final fusing of his almost healed collarbone. Tipping his head to the left, exposing his neck, he rolled his shoulder, testing it. It pulled a bit, the muscles reminding him of their lack of use for the last few days, but, ultimately, felt the same as ever.
The eggs and bacon crackled happily on the stove, so he cut a thick slice of bread and shoved it into the toaster before turning to face his little family. “Am I over thinking this?”
The brown Wolf chuffed, giving him what he would equate to a sharp, obedient nod, and rose from his seated position. The sound of claws and the light wave of the tail as the younger man darted back and forth across the gymnasium (Chasing trails left by dragging the dismembered piece of flesh about rather haphazardly) made him smile and raise his eyebrows at the two men at the desk.
The man’s flush deepened to a lovely beet red and the doctor turned his back to him slightly, giving him a bit of privacy and showing his shapely rear. Despite his chosen outward indifference, his manhood twitched with interest at the sight.
He yipped again, running away from the door to paw at the hall closet, nosing the door open, and grabbing a pair of tennis balls in his rather large mouth. Lifting his tail like a banner at his achievement, he trotted back to the main door and pawed at it, dropping the balls and their odd rubbery, hairy taste and texture out of his mouth with another yip.
The consulting detective did not grace the statement with a response. “Anything else you can tell me about them? Family names, perhaps?”
“He’s practicing, has been most of the week,” he murmured. “It’s strange to go from being unable to move about on one’s own to having legs to waddle around on. Of course, the eyesight of a newborn human is not particularly good but the loss of it is disorienting, nonetheless. Thomas is learning how to rely on his senses of touch and smell to propel him around.”
Shifting a bit in his chair, the natural born wolf replied, “Soon, Molly. Very soon, I think.” His eyes traveled to the rounded stomach that punched upwards like a beach ball. “What are your plans for the birth? Hospital?”
His son, for once, listened, dropping his hands and stepping back as his daughter took a swipe at her sibling. “Lucy! That was uncalled for. Apologize. Both of you.”
The statement made him freeze, an eyebrow cocking with interest. “Oh? Is it a man, five foot nine who smokes cheap cigarettes and wears a leather jacket?”
), he slipped into the loo, neatly stacked his clothes, and shifted. It was more comfortable to sleep as a Wolf on the carpet than to curl up on the sofa in his lanky human body. With a quick shake, letting his scent fill the bathroom, he nudged the door open and loped into the sitting room. Taking some time to find a comfy spot on the carpet, he curled up and laid his head on his forepaws, drifting into a dreamless sleep.
) gave the poor toddler a tender lick on his jowl, comforting him. Sherrinford nudged him, urging him to greet the guards again, in a more appropriate manner. Hesitantly, the Pup put his head beneath the guard’s waiting hand, his forepaw rising to bat at the man’s pant leg. His blue eye remained on Sherrinford, his quasi-guardian, practically begging for his praise. Their uncle didn’t disappoint, breaking into a wide grin, his tongue lolling out.
“Shall we come in, Mother, or are we going to eat dinner outside?” she chimed in, wrapping her arm around the man’s thin but sculpted waist. “Sherrinford is eager to meet everyone.”
“I’m just going to eat and use the loo,” John said. “Then back to bed, I promise.” He nodded, showing that he understood. Hunkering down again, he curled tighter around himself and let sleep take him.
“You already do,” Mycroft chuckled, rubbing the small of her back and pressing a kiss to her brow before continuing into the ensuite bath.
“Her uncle’s going to do what?” Sherlock asked, striding into their flat in his pajamas and blue silk dressing gown, his fingers flashing over his mobile’s keyboard.
The family members that had tried to kill her Mate had all been imprisoned for a long time, with condemning evidence found on all of their properties. Despite being revealed as murderers, they had all backed her great-uncle, who disowned her for loving ‘an animal.’ Her brother, Frederick, had been the killer Sherlock had hunted, falling into the height requirement and the man kept a green house with mistletoe and wolfsbane among it’s occupants. He would never see the light of day again.
Sherrinford’s cheek turned a deep shade of red, his hand dropping to his side. “I am much more than that, Sir,” he stated calmly even as his jaw muscles spasmed. “I am well-educated, having attended some of the best private schools on the continent and I have a double first from Cambridge. I am the foremost researcher of Lupus sapiens in the world-”
He took a step back, a hand fiddling a bit with his exposed tags. His confidence dimmed slightly as the crowd shifted in their seats. Sean, Elizabeth beside him, rose and pulled his own tags from beneath his shirt. “Thank you, Sherrinford, for being candid. I, too, am done hiding who I am.”
Knowing that something had to be said to continue the momentum of the movement that his brother had started, he paused just outside of his car. He opened the door, in case his brother wanted to escape, and turned to face the reporters and protestors. “I will be making one statement, and one statement only: I believe in my brother and the work that he is doing for himself and for people like him and I will support him, no matter what, because I know that he is a good man. There are people in government and on every street who will think differently, who will try to make the unknown and less understood out to be monsters because of a genetic condition that they lacked control in contracting. The Lupus sapiens, are first and foremost, men and they should always be treated as such, their actions received as those of their human counterparts. I am glad that the Kensington Initiative has been shot down but I know that there will always be other Kensington Initiatives. Please, be vigilant. Stand for what you believe to be right. And, through that work, we can build a better Britain. Thank you.”
sorry, John,” the youngest Holmes murmured as the man closed the door behind him and he sat down again.
“Right,” Sherrinford took over, “If Eddington wants to come that way tonight as well, he is more than welcome. Do you have an extra tracker for him, Mycroft?”
The facility, part of the River campus, was rather plain on the exterior, and unassuming. On a normal day, no one would suspect that there was a werewolf living there in captivity. But she knew better. As did the hundreds of protestors camped outside, some of whom were supportive of the werewolves, others who were vehemently supportive of her uncle and his racist initiatives.
Jogging lightly down the hallway, he beamed at the excited pair. “How was school?” he asked at the top of the stairs, holding up his hands in a quieting gesture.
Hours later, the new Kensington Initiative was being rallied into law and any hopes of added freedoms for his brothers’ kind had vanished. The bill, brought forward to bring safety and security to all, especially the Lupus sapiens (
His mother’s eyebrows shot up. “That’s not necessary, Sherlock,” she stated. “Sleep here. We’ll leave the back door unlocked. Sherrinford was able to open in that…shape.”
Sherlock sighed, torn. Something within him longed to hold the man to him; something that his Wolf from could not do for his lack of hands.
“Inadequate? You? Imogen. You are amazing.” Sherrinford beamed at her, his smile radiating joy despite it’s lack of visible teeth. “And everything smells delicious.” His lips met hers before he drew back and pulled a chair out, gesturing her into it. “Thank you for seeing me. And for cooking.”
, he thought sarcastically, pulling his two pairs of trousers from his sack and placing them rather unceremoniously on the nearest shelf.
Sherlock leaned into him heavily, Sherrinford mirroring his stance with Molly, his body covering her legs.
The elderly couple were seated in the main parlor with Molly and Evelyn when he entered, ears pressed flat against his drooping head. He was beyond exhausted and certainly not in the mood to socialize. Sherlock had settled himself onto the floor at John’s feet, allowing Nathaniel and Lucy to pet him and play with him, his tongue lolling out blissfully. Molly held Benedict, a soft maternal smile on her face while Thomas was clutched protectively in Evy’s capable arms, his slumbering human face soft and smiling.
He watched their retreating backs with apprehension. This was dangerous. So very dangerous. And the last thing he wanted was to have his youngest brother killed to bring about change for his kind. Over a mistake that he had made years ago in the creation of “The Declaration of the Rights of Werewolf Kind”.
They had been up all night, the morning sun was just peeking through their curtains as the twins yawned and she handed one of the blue bundles off to her husband to burp. Exhaustion was coming on fast, making her glad that Sherrinford had come to stay for a while. The older twins would need a sitter to get them ready and off to school today, seeing as she and Mycroft would not be leaving this room for a while. Of course, her in-laws would be over as soon as Mycroft called. She prayed that he’d wait until the afternoon at least. They didn’t know anything about Thomas’ inheritance from his uncle but they’d discover it soon enough, she was sure. It would certainly wake old memories and regrets.
Her brother-in-law licked the baby once more before nuzzling her own arm tenderly. “Thanks, Sherrinford,” she murmured, drifting to sleep.
“Sherlock,” the other man murmured, wrapping his arms around his middle and squeezing like he was the only thing keeping him afloat. “I have been experiencing something that I cannot understand. Ever since my accident with St. Pierre-” He growled, unable to help his interjection at the mention of the rabid Wolf. “I know, Sherlock. Let me finish.”
God, he needed Sherlock. He’d even settle for Eddington, his unit’s K13. Both, however, were where they were required to be by law - in their transitional facilities. This break-out was obviously carefully planned.
“Hmmm, yes,” the British Government intoned. “I can see how that could be a problem.” Another sharp bark followed. “Oh, Brother, do shut up - you’ll wake Evelyn. There is nothing that you can do now.” A warning growl split the silence. Sherlock was not pleased. “We’ll be back in the morning. He’s smart but he won’t be able to hide - not this time.”
Titling his head, in an attempt to look cowed, he muttered, “We have several members in our K13 units whom are Lupus sapiens. The Yard takes care of their own, so why not others?”
“Yeah, well,” she muttered, flushing, “I was always a bit of a rebel. And I’ve met someone who filled all the emptiness that I felt. Someone who showed me that everything my family believes is so wrong. Someone who I really can’t think of living without - much less killing!” She groaned, feeling the man’s large hand squeeze hers comfortingly. “Oh God, Sherrinford, I -”
Sherrinford looked offended at the suggestion while Molly gave him a small, knowing smile. She knew that keeping the secret was hard and the wolfsbane injection was truly awful with very little end gain.
As much as he wished to not admit it, he did like the Pups. The Wolf was easy to determine via scent. He sniffed the other one first, memorizing his scent, including the odd hint of Lupus sapiens that lingered about him. “That’s Benedict,” Sherrinford stated from his side, his own nostrils flaring.
The wolves had all turned their attentions to him at this point, nostrils flared but unable to pick up his unique musk through the smoky mixture of the pub (
The cell was rife with St. Pierre’s odor. It had to be, with the blood message on the wall. It wasn’t Gregson’s, he had been killed - murdered - after the Moon would have taken the Wolf’s ability to write. The message, with the crusted rust color of the man’s blood, traced with hints of the shimmering mucous that was laced with dangerous DNA , was simple.
Her uncle’s fiancée joined them, easy down beside them with an even bigger sigh than the one her uncle had released. His hands instantly found the small rounding of her stomach, his lips quirking in a gentle, loving smile. “And how are you, Darling?” he asked, his mouth hovering just over hers.
He stiffened. He remembered the Hunters in Germany. One of the reasons he was sent to boarding school was to protect him from them and their twisted, deadly games. His great-uncle, his father really, was a hard man and an even tougher Wolf who had made more enemies than friends. Because of that, he had attracted the attention of Hunters and kept moving, particularly after an incident when he was five. It was the first time he had seen a man die.
“To what do I owe the pleasure, Brother Dear?” Mycroft asked, turning the corner into the kitchen. He whined again, tail wagging slightly. “Molly,” his brother turned to his wife with a soft, tender smile. “Let’s get him in a more verbal state, shall we?”
He should have known that that question was coming. Friday was well away from the Full Moon. It was also only the first date - she didn’t really have to know. He could gage it and tell her if things seemed to be progressing. It would, however, have to come up at some point early in their relationship. He could not hide what made him distinctly himself.
“Sherlock.” The single word carried an immense amount of weight. It settled on the room like the blanket, except heavier, more commanding. Their eyes snapped to the only woman in the their midst. “You know that there isn’t anything that you can do about the case at the moment. There is nothing more to uncover - you just need time. Besides, why are you worrying needlessly about it? It’s one incident; it’s probably isolated. So, take a deep breath and try to enjoy tonight! After all, the little one could be here before next month and you’ll be stuck on proverbial nappy duty.” She beamed brightly, her husband’s lips twitching themselves into a smile of their own.
He woke up in the early morning light, his sharp, wolf ears picking up on the fussing of his sister-in-law. Sighing, he rose, the mattress jostling beneath his weight, and stretched, his back popping gloriously. He shook out his coat before shifting back into his human form. It took about thirty seconds and felt almost comfortable now, the pain feeling almost sweet. A release instead of a punishment.
He chuckled, as if at a personal joke. “Oh yes. A handful, thanks to your Uncles and their research. Sometimes they shift back after a Moon and need someone to patch them up. Your uncles apparently don’t trust any of the other doctors in Britain. That’s why I can tell you that they’re no different than anyone else.”
He dropped the device into his lap and shifted his laptop closer. He had spent the last several days scanning and compiling every bit of information that he could find about Kensington and his family of Hunters. In retrospect, everything was glaringly obvious.
Without waiting for him to open the door, the detective threw the van door open and allowed his younger sibling to hop in. He followed, any thought of privacy gone in his excitement to get at the bit of information that his younger sibling was able to garner from the crime scene before them.
. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Imogen. He trusted her with everything that he was and more. It was her family that he didn’t trust. He had flashbacks of his life with his adopted father, moving every three to four months, being chased by Hunters.
“Yeah, Mum,” she sighed, trying to steady her racing heartbeat as she watched Sherrinford reveal his true self to the world for the thirty-second time, “It’s everywhere.”
The teen stood and practically ran to the sofa, throwing herself down on a cushion and picking up her notebook and a pen from the coffee table. The adults followed, John thankfully staying by his side, giving him strength and courage that he didn’t realize he needed until now. He sat opposite the blonde girl, John on his right, Sherrinford, his left. He fiddled with his collar, well-worn by now, in his pocket, before giving his younger sibling a small nod.
“Mother and Father are here,” the muffled sound of Mycroft came through the wood of the door. “Sherlock is still...furry...he’s being immature, as usual.”
“We’re planning on telling them tonight at dinner.” The woman paused, her smile slipping a bit. “If you’re up for it?”
Imogen had taken it all well (As far as she could tell), though she was sure that her Uncle Ford helped. She had forsaken her family and her very name to stand beside the man that she loved more than anything. Their love for each other was so evident and so incredibly cute that she hoped to find someone who loved her that way. Their six month anniversary as a couple had been marked by the significant bonding experience that had resulted in a small, slim, ebony werewolf with bright green eyes that stuck to her lover’s auburn side like a bur. This, of course, meant that the baby she was carrying was going to be a natural born Wolf, like his or her father.
“You’re hoping to stop the passing of the bill.” It was a statement but it was said without emotion, giving him pause.
) This doctor, however, is a top general practitioner in London and he has had Lupus Sapiens patients before you (
“Don’t say that,” John whispered, shaking his head. “You have paid time and time again for the mistakes you made all those years ago. I really hope you found someone. I can’t imagine my life without Sherlock. I just hope that this woman understands.”
“How did you find us?” the statesman asked before he corrected himself, tapping his temple. “Never mind that.” His elegant hand waved the first question away. “‘Why are you here?’ is a much more apt question.”
little about modern pop culture), she most certainly was his Mate. The feelings only intensified through their three subsequent dinners and a trip to the theatre.
“It was a pleasure to meet you, Imogen,” Mycroft said, still looking the couple up and down apprehensively. That woman, with her family history and her ties to Kensington, could be the end of everything that he had worked for - that his brothers had worked for.
). He continued his explanation, “I’m on patrol, not sure how it happened. He killed one and Bit four. Five good men - lives changed forever.”
His parents, to their credit, were trying. Still, he felt as if they were trying more for Sherlock’s sake than for his own. He was a lost cause, born with a pelt and a tail. Sherlock had been born normal and had simply suffered an accident. The feeling of loneliness, of never being able to fit in, and, at times, self-loathing, was not something that Mycroft (The wanted, perfect child) had ever had to face. He would never understand the awkwardness of sitting in silence with the pair of them simply staring at him, wringing their hands with looks of pity on their faces. To him, it was sadly commonplace.
One by one, the wolves tilted their heads to the left, consenting to his input, though the bald man (
Gesturing Imogen into the Red Lion with a bit of a bow, he turned to face the Turned wolf. “Sherlock,” he grumbled, peeling his upper lips back a bit to reveal his teeth, “Back. Off. I do not need a
“Oh,” she breathed, her heart beginning to race as she picked up the device and slid right. “Hello?”
“Fine,” he replied, “Leave the door unlocked and put the extra mattress by the door with some water. If we use it, wonderful. If not, don’t be upset.”
“I’m sure that could be arranged, Evy,” her father stated from the stove, giving her adoptive father a look. She beamed, glad to have her ‘dog,’ though she’d never tell her father that.
, he thought, wishing that he could growl convincingly at his youngest sibling, annoyed at his airs. “Most are already situated. Their families are here as well. I believe that our little success story, Sean, has already shifted. Elizabeth is expecting.”
. The pressure made her palms sticky. She wiped them on her pants before reaching up to take the brass knocker in her right hand.
“Ah,” the doctor breathed, moving to ascend the next set of stairs. “We’ll be ready in fifteen. Come on, Evy.”
Bleary, blue eyes blinked open beside her followed by a slow smile. “Good morning, Beloved,” that husky baritone murmured right before the perfect pair of lips met hers passionately. A large, warm hand left her hip to cup her cheek, the thumb running over her cheekbone.
“They’ve already been informed,” Mycroft groaned, straining a bit under Molly’s increased weight. “But thank you. We’ll be in the dining room tonight. We can meet you there.”
“Why was it bad?” he queried, his nerves rising and he allowed a rather weak sounding rumble resonate through his chest, the little Pup lifted up to his nose to allow him to snuffle his scent glands before settling him over his heart. Thomas, enjoying the attention, quickly quieted even as Benedict continued to mewl and fuss.
Concerned, he nuzzled one of her arms, huffing along the length to her neck, which he licked, making the girl jump awake. The motion startled him and he leapt back with a soft yelp.
The men, an air of solemnity hanging over them, exited without a sound. He inhaled deeply, the strong scent of Wolf lingering along with the pungent odor of nervousness as they closed the doors behind them.
“We’re studying wolves, like the wild ones in Siberia, and the teacher is reading faery tales with wolves and all they do is eat children! I’m just afraid that they’ll come eat me and then eat Lucy because all she wants to do is pet them. And then Vincent said that the wolves in faery tales are real. That he saw one on the news. That he was a man then he turned into a wolf and
), understood the gesture and tenderly placed the finicky child against his belly. It was far enough away from his injury that Thomas shouldn’t injure him further but close enough that he could feel and hear his heartbeat. Unable to bend as agilely as he had wanted to, he draped his tail over the fussy babe and rumbled in his chest as Sherlock shifted to rest his head over his flank, nosing at the Pup.
“Thank you, Sherrinford” John murmured to the open air, a small, relieved smile playing at his lips. His blue-grey eyes found his, wide and filled with relieved love.
The young woman leaned her head against his shoulder, sighing. “It’ll happen,” she breathed, “I know it will.”
The fingers extricated themselves from his fur, taking some of his remaining winter fur with them. She smiled at him, her tears dried though her eyes were still puffy. “Thank you, Uncle Ford,” she murmured with a soft smile before looking back up at his older sibling. “Thank you, Sherlock.”
He flushed and bowed his head, embarrassed. “I don’t.” He slid into the seat beside her, averting his gaze to his feet. “I’m sorry.”
Needing to do something about the rather sterile room and the invasive expectant parent smell that clung to every surface, he finished placing his clothing in the closet and began to strip his clothing off, willing the Shift in order to claim the room as his own. He shook his coat out, the loose fur falling all about his body, his claws scratching the wooden floor. The room shifted when he was on four legs, making him notice the doggie door in the main door, allowing him to leave the room while leaving the door closed and keeping his more mobile niece and nephew out of his room.
He bit back a growl and followed the other man down the stairs, aware that the teen was following him while still allowing him to have his own space.
“In order to get a good pelt, she’ll need to strangle me somehow. So, I’m going to meet her family for dinner, make an excuse to Shift, and she’ll pretend to kill me. Wire my collar and, as we fake my death, move in. Sherlock or Eddington could find our killer and can put a hate group away for a long time.”
“Let’s adjourn until half-past eighteen hundred hours,” he stated, rising from his chair and gesturing his remaining guests towards the door.
The door in front of him opened, allowing a wash of Sherlock and John to stream into the room along with the father of the child wrapped about his ribcage. “Oh,” the doctor breathed, eyebrows shooting up as he blinked at him lazily, one ear trained on the older man, the other on the sleeping child behind him. “Wuh-wuh...?” The other man swallowed. “Morning.”
Her adoptive father, her dad’s partner, was in a surprisingly good mood; the door to 221B was open as she passed it on the way to 221C.
The Wolf responded with his own growl and a fierce shake of his head, still trying to dislodge his hand. He squeezed harder, pressing further against the exposed underbelly and throat. “Shift! I am Alpha! You obey me! Now -
With a sigh, he rose to his feet and gave his coat a shake. He bent, retrieving the remains of the balls and moved back to the road, eyeing his sibling speculatively. The dark wolf rolled his eyes, sighing, and rose with a yawn and a stretch, his teeth catching the moonlight. Snuffling, the other wolf nudged his mate’s leg with his wedge-shaped head, ushering him towards the gates of Baskerville. He watched the human doctor simply shake his head and place his hand on the other man’s furred shoulder tenderly, the pair walking side by side. Perfect for each other - completing each other.
The woman nodded at him, looking relieved. “That’d be great, thanks. If I could get Myc to look after Ben for a bit too, I could shower.”
He hear a resounding click. “I hate to tell you that it is almost predictable that you have a hidden office, Mycroft. I was disappointed to find it on my first tenure in your home. But I am even more disappointed, however, that it doesn’t appear behind a revolving bookcase.”
Sherlock rose and strode to an abandoned fire barrel, the scent of slightly singed Wolfsbane growing sharper with each stride. He ran a finger around the barrel rim before tilting the barrel and grasping a bit of the crispy black leaf at the bottom. “His attention was lured over here by a well-timed, small explosion and the burning scent of Wolfsbane, not that he would have known what it was - most likely, just that it smelled repulsive.”
Nodding, he licked her chin and snuffled her hairline before laying his head on her stomach, warming her and releasing her tense muscles with his heat. Evy smiled at him, hand still stroking his ears, as she closed her eyes and her breath deepened.
He paused, his gaze scanning the crowd. Mycroft gave him a small nod. Some of his patients seemed to be as supportive and hopeful for the night. Others still looked pissed off at him while the rank stench of fear still clung to the air. With his own hint of hope, he concluded, “Regardless of what happens tonight, I will continue to be here to support you and I look forward, as always, to our chats tomorrow. Let’s go and have a great night. Enjoy the Moon and do not be afraid to
“If you visit Uncle Sherrinford after school tomorrow, I’m sure you will. We’re getting closer to the Moon, so he’ll be trying to get more comfortable on four legs. He is a newborn, after all. Newborn Pups are blind, you know.”
He growled, the sound echoing around him and reverberating about the stone and cement. He had figured that some form of retribution would come for him, but nothing like this. He had assumed that They would have put him down. They could have, three of them, all Alphas and much stronger than he was, could have ripped his throat out those five years ago. And yet, they had given him something far worse. They had given him this:
) growled softly. “Thank you,” he murmured before continuing. “Was there anyone that was bothering Stevenson? A confrontation here or at work, perhaps?”
“This is a huge risk.” The consulting detective had his hands placed under his chin, his gaze was calculated. “But...” The other man cocked an eyebrow. “I wish you happiness. You do deserve it, baby brother. I just hope that she is worthy of you and our trust.”
He gritted his teeth, not even attempting to suppress a growl. His feet had surely worn a track in the carpet by now with all of his pacing. His usual New Moon pursuits (experiments) were so unimportant at the moment that he felt that all he could do was pace.
“Yes, it certainly is. It’s been in my late-husband’s family for generations, dating back to the mid-sixteenth century when a single hovel dwelt on this very spot.”
Baskerville loomed on the horizon, causing all the occupants in the car to tense. Sherrinford’s eyes flew open and he inhaled sharply. “So it begins,” he intoned, running a hand through his hair before refocusing. “Mycroft, Molly and I will go to the hospital wing. See if we can confirm the Pup before tonight, and, more importantly, before his birth. Sherlock, we’ll join you in the family flat, have Angelo’s, and wait.”
“Uncle Ford!” she said, rushing forward after kicking her shoes off in the entryway. “You look so much better!” She closed the distance as he stood, taking her into his free arm and pressing his nose into her wavy hair.
John looked like he was going to refute the placement of himself into his room but then thought better of it. He simply closed his mouth with a small snap and shot him a strange look. The detective pulled a bit closer to the older man until their hands brushed, needing the protective gesture and the comfort that his Mate’s scent brought this close to the Moon. He pressed his nose to the top of John’s head, inhaling his scent in order to comfort them both.
The flashbulbs that greeted them were blinding. Sherrinford cowered beside him, his massive body pressing against his leg, no doubt covering it with fur. Unable to stop himself, and maybe to drive his own thoughts on Lupus sapiens, their rights, and their humanity, he placed a hand on his youngest brother’s wedge-shaped head, ruffling and tugging at his ears.
) filled the tunnel. Two large, squalid bodies went barreling past him and into the tunnel that John had claimed. A gunshot, echoing about the pipes, reached his ears and he was running, sprinting through the slop to get to the doctor and what he now guessed to be three massive werewolves. Howls rent the air, punctuated by snapping jaws and menacing growls. Human shouts and screams made him run faster, tripping and falling through the muck until his torch lit the scene.
. Opting for honesty, he said, “Well, it was nice to think of you when I wasn’t busy worrying about my other responsibilities that come with the Moon.” He paused before uttering the dreaded words. “Imogen, we need to talk about something.”
“Everyone,” a ginger with a beer gut stated. “Even his bosses at the firm felt awful letting him go. But...well...it’s difficult to get good steady work now that we’re not...human.”
The sound of John’s feet on the stairs reached his ears but he didn’t move, simply listening to the other man’s descent. The strong, sturdy body of the army doctor settled beside him, a rough hand tugging at his ears and his brow with soft mutters and reassurances. It was comforting, soothing, to know that John was with him. His Mate in every sense of the word but one. He knew, no matter what happened, he would protect this man to the last. The world might be less than ideal but it would certainly be a much darker place without John Watson.
“Alright,” he said, tasting the next word on his lips before he voiced it, “Imogen.” He offered a hand. “It’s been a pleasure.” She took his hand, her smile slipping a bit as she shook it and dropped her own. “It may seem forward of me,” he said softly, averting his own gaze before refocusing on her eyes, “But, may I ask you to dinner? Maybe on Friday?”
“Sir,” the young officer said evenly, “I am already viewed by many members of our team as less than human. You heard Morris today: I’m one of
Oh, they were going to regret this, those Holmes Boys. They are going to wish that they had never stood in his way. Especially not now. Not now that he had a backer. A powerful ally. One that could take down the Holmes’.
“Yes,” he replied kindly, reaching out to place a hand on the soldier’s shoulder. “I need to welcome them, acclimatize to their scents.”
“Well,” the doctor sighed, taking a few steps forward, a soft smile on his lips, “We know that Sherrinford is babysitting and we will be staying in. None of us are in imminent danger-” The man broke off as he got a brilliant idea. Unfortunately, after living together for so long, John could read his facial expressions like a book. “No. NO! Sherlock! We have Evy to think about now. We are
The door to Imogen’s flat was ajar, the woman hanging out of it, watching his approach. “I’m glad you’re here!” she exclaimed, wrapping her arms around his waist in a hug, before standing on her tiptoes and capturing his lips. “It’s a wonderful surprise!”
He welcomed his anxious wife into his arms, taking Benedict from her as he pulled her close. “You are a wonderful mother, Mol,” he murmured, pressing kisses onto her forehead and into her hair. “This is our first Full Moon. Next time, Sherrinford and maybe even Sherlock will be here for Thomas the whole time. It can only get better from here. I promise.”
Yanking his tie off and pulling his suit coat from about his broad shoulders, he knew that he was lying to himself and that it wasn’t quite working.
He beamed at her, his lips pressed together in his widest grin. “I’m glad,” he said, following her into her flat. “I’m sorry it’s so early - it’s just...I needed to see you.”
“Because,” he cut in, setting his utensils down on his empty plate, “There are some people that can do that. That’s what I research up at Baskerville. And I help the men, like the four that were bitten, come to terms with the fact that they can become wolves now too. But you mustn’t tell anyone - it’s top secret.”
Thomas quieted, making Molly breathe and audible sigh of relief. “How did you…? Never mind, never mind…Just keep doing whatever you’re do…” She stopped, gasping as the baby began to quiver.
Another pile of raw meat sat in the corner among smashed crockery (Though how the man was given something that breakable, he had no idea), the second, almost more terrifying note lying among them. The pair of Wolves spotted it, eyes narrowing as they read the deception.
Breaking the kiss, she whispered, “It certainly is a good morning.” She beamed, watching him flush, the rose color on his cheekbones making him even more handsome. “We should have sleepovers more often.”
“It’s Uncle Shock.” Lucy’s educated guess surprised him. She had obviously inherited some of the family’s extreme intelligence. Mycroft would be proud.
He woke the following morning to the sound of breakfast being consumed, the scent of toast and jam reaching his nostrils. He rose slowly, a bit stiff from a night on the floor, and stretched.
Knowing that the teenage years were an extremely vulnerable time, he murmured, “I think, Evelyn, that anyone would be glad to have you call them Pop. To have you in their lives as a daughter. I do think that he will say yes, but you do have to ask him first.” He ruffled the blonde head beside him before changing the subject. “How about some ice cream? I think the debate winner deserves a treat, don’t you?”
He did not grace the question with an answer. “We should leave soon. I wish to avoid running into my parents.”
“Well,” the matriarch stated, taking a step back from the door and gesturing them inside to the expansive and richly marbled foyer, “Then by all means, come inside. Welcome to our home.”
The soldier shook his head infinitesimally, his head shifting slightly on his sternum. “I can’t believe we’re here,” the man’s voice, gruff with sleep stated.
“Between the three of us, we’ll be able to find a cure,” the mortician murmured, girding her own mug of caffeine a bit tighter, “Or a decent suppressant at least. Honestly, anything would be better than the wolfsbane delay. It might take some time, but we’ll fix it.”
His fingers wound themselves through Sherlock’s thick, velvety fur. The wolf growled possessively, low in his throat, and leaned further into his leg and side. He couldn’t imagine his life without the man beside him, a realization that had been reenforced time and time again. It had been just after the capture of St. Pierre that the detective had told him about their bond. His younger sibling had beaten him to it, years previous, but it was nice to hear it from the other man’s mouth.
“They’re a handful,” she chuckled. “Why I ever thought that having another set of twins was a good idea, I don’t know!”
“Nothing,” she murmured, diverting her daydreaming gaze from a spot on the wall to her maths homework, “Just thinking of Uncle Ford.”
, or wise. There are two types: Natural Born, meaning they are born with the genetic mutation that allows them to transform into a wolf at will; and Turned, meaning they were bitten by a Lupus Sapiens, contracted their DNA through the bite and were mutated from there. A majority of Britain’s werewolf population are Turned with only two registered Natural Born wolves that are documented at this time. Many speculate that there is a Natural Born pack in the country that has refused to register with the government, but it would be impossible to tell.”
“I’m sure that Evy will be by this afternoon,” John began, leaning forward in his seat and placing a hand on the man’s uninjured shoulder.
A nurse pushed him back at the surgery doors. “Take care of him! Please!” He collapsed, unable to support himself anymore, his hands shaking uncontrollably. "
All CCTV in the area had been put on a loop from the shots the night previous. Kensington definitely had personal access to the live footage and the last thing he needed was the man bent on bringing destruction of the Lupus sapiens knowing that they were gathering on his doorstep.
He grinned down at her. She was beautiful - by far his favorite niece (though Lucy was so young and he had spent so little time with her, it was difficult to claim otherwise). Her blonde hair had a light curl to it and her eyes matched his, a dancing blue. His brother was lucky to have such a wonderful pup through his connection to his Mate. Maybe, thinking about the woman he had just left behind, he would be lucky too.
The woman’s rich laughter, rising like a bell through the hills of Germany, met his ears as he exited the bedroom with another inhale, taking the aroma of their mingled love-making with him. It was exquisite and he made a promise to himself that he would carry that perfume with him everywhere until the day he died.
The man nodded. “We’ve discussed it. If there’s a serial killer who’s going after us, we want to take him on head-on, even if that means Shifting without the Moon and at work. We’re willing to do what it takes, even if we Shift with restrictions: collars, leashes, vests...muzzles.”
She beamed at her fathers from her seat on the expansive lawn. It was the perfect place for a late-spring day like today. The sky was that perfect, peerless blue with thin wisps of cloud making their way across the expanse. The trees had leafed out and the flowers were in full bloom, swaying in the light breeze.
The answer was frank and very true. The idea of an incredibly specialized serial killer was not one that he particularly wanted to entertain, but it was becoming more evident that that was what he and his team was dealing with. “So now we wait for Jack and hope for a mistake,” he mumbled, taking a much needed swig of his black coffee, watching Sherlock continue to dance about the alley, hoping beyond hope that he might find something, anything that they could use.
“She’s worried about you, of course, but she’s been keeping up with her school work. I’ve been taking care of her for you, though she’s really been taking care of herself - she’s quite a remarkable young woman, John.” He smiled broadly, lips closed. “Would you like to see her?”
“Is there a reason why you find that keeping them in separate kennels is better than allowing Packs to form?” he asked, his head resting on his fist, his elbow propped on the desk.
On the other hand, her uncle was continuously checking on his Mate. He nuzzled her, sniffing her all over between bites of his own. He allowed her to take some of his bunny when she asked for it, licking his muzzle tenderly in thanks.
Smiling to himself, he settled down beside his Alpha’s pup - his favorite niece and allowed sleep to take him.
Sherrinford stepped a bit to the side and gestured her out the door before stepping back and allowing her to lock her flat. She could feel his gaze on her, though his eyes flickered back and forth along the hallway, as if watching for something. Noticing her attention, he smiled again.
“Well, thank you,” she replied, giving him a quick peck before leaning around him to smile at her. “And how are you today, Evy?”
“In the future,” the man murmured, his gaze distant, “Yes. I would have you at my side, always. The Alphas of our own Pack, running together.”
The other man nodded distractedly, no doubt still thinking about his children, his family, and how he couldn’t tear them apart. With a final glance at the Pups, he rose and strode to his room, his thoughts swirling. His fingers beat a tattoo on his mobile screen, typing in a number that he rarely called.
The buzz of her mobile against the worn wood of her coffee table roused her from her spiraling thoughts.
The woman’s face became serious. “For what?” she queried, “Wanting to raise our own child to the best of our abilities or for giving you a place to stay while you generously help us with our Pup? Because both are things that we all want and they are making us so happy. Though I am ready to be done with this bedrest business. I feel so lazy, it’s ridiculous.”
He wondered if the little girl knew what she was getting into. If she understood the weight of her responsibility and the importance of this secret. Of how it could truly impact the lives of the men that loved her enough to tell her. Judging from her rather jovial juvenile grin, she had no idea.
Footsteps, a heavy tread accompanied by the scent of sugar exited the bedroom. “What?” Mycroft muttered as the knocking came a third time. “That was fast.” His eldest sibling raced past him, down the stairs and across the foyer, opening the door while wheezing slightly. “Thank you for coming so quickly.”
“Sherrinford. How are our patients today?” He cut to the chase, very much over the niceties and Pack hierarchy mumbo-jumbo.
She bit her lips. “I-I....” She exhaled. “I’ve been ordered to take you out by the matriarch, who probably received the kill order from the patriarch.”
. “Shit,” she hissed, knowing that she couldn’t ignore this call even though she desperately wanted to. Swiping right, she breathed, “Hello?”
“Great,” the midwife replied, her lighter tread following that of the British government. “Not too stressed?”
Knowing that the wolf was probably rolling his eyes at the request, he gave a small tilt to his head as the device was place in his outstretched hand. His fingers closed over it and gave it a tug, meeting resistance from the other man’s grip. He growled, glaring up at Sherrinford who was glaring back at him. “Seriously, Sherlock?” his younger sibling muttered, teeth briefly flashing, “All that yelling for something that was on the coffee table. Acting like a child is not going to fix our problem.”
His mobile dinged, alerting him to a in-coming text. He shifted his gaze, fingers continuing to fly on the keys of his laptop.
Sliding shoe covers over his feet, he moved closer to the body and squatted down. Grimly, he slid on a pair of gloves and began to search the corpse for any distinguishing features. “Do we have an ID on our vic?” he asked, as the pockets turned up with nothing.
“I have no complaints,” she replied, her eyes flicking back to the playing Pup and his twin. “You sure you’re ready for that?” She pointed, teasing. She had known for some time that her uncle had desperately wanted his own Pups. She had been a surrogate, of sorts, for a while now. And with Thomas, well, he was more than ready.
He furrowed his brow and folded his hands on his desk. “Then I am sorry, Eddie, I cannot help you if you will not help yourself.”
While his instincts demanded that he court the teacher constantly (Making his trousers uncomfortably tight), his logic was telling him that that would be a rather poor idea. Instead, with the Full Moon three nights away, he had decided to speak with his eldest brother and his wife about their potential Pup problem. It had not been difficult to find his brother’s residence on Downing Street, and, by assuming his four-legged form, it was easy to sneak past the Prime Minister’s abode, with it’s vigilant security, to find Mycroft’s swanky city home.
Once the Pup quieted, Sherlock snuffled the little ears and back before lapping at his muzzle, welcoming him into their Pack. He carefully, and painfully, stretched his head back to snuffle and lick at Thomas’ pink, flared nose.
Sherlock growled at the insult, so the younger Holmes shoved him out of the way, scampering down the corridor. It diverted the older wolf’s attention long enough to give chase, that all thoughts of being a lapdog were forgotten, their strides beating a tattoo on the slippery linoleum of the hallways and into the packed dirt of the main yard.
John subconsciously shuffled a bit closer to his side even as he replied, “Thank you for letting us stay here, Timothy. It’s quite kind of you, considering everything that has been going on.”
“You know why we’re here, John,” he replied. “Staying in London would have been unbearable for everyone involved.”
The new silence between them was much more comfortable than it had been. “Sherrinford,” she murmured, “If I wasn’t a Hunter, what would you be doing?”
The pair fell silent, though their lips were still pulled back revealing their savage-looking teeth, their ears pinned against their wedge-shaped heads. The alpha broke free first, pulling John from the room hastily. Sherrinford, whom Mycroft referred to as Jack (John apparently being his ‘real’ first name), followed, his nose pressed to the ground.
my family - I haven’t killed; I’ve never wanted to, though I’d never second guessed it before. And then I met you...Now I know how wrong my family is, how wrong all the Hunters are.
Sighing and sharing a rather trying glance with the British Government, he clambered into the van. To his surprise, he found, sitting on one of the various hard, plastic tool boxes and looking like a cat that had gotten into the cream, a very naked and unashamed Sherrinford Holmes.
The doctor gave a peculiar smile, but reached out his arms, taking the squirming Pup. Thomas gave another whimper, his nose obviously working, nostrils flaring at the new odor that held it. “Hello,” John murmured, a single finger stroking the Pup’s head, gently teasing his ruddy cheeks. “I-” A strange look played across the soldier’s face. “I remember when Evy was this small. So precious, even then…”
Gently, he handed the furry twin to his sister-in-law and moved off deeper into their apartment. He found Mycroft’s empty study and closed the door to a sliver. Stripping, he folded his clothing and placed it on a wooden chair in the corner, where it would be out of the way. With a prolonged sigh, he called the Wolf and Shifted, almost purring at the sweet release. His paws sunk into the rich carpet, the fibers tickling his toes. Gripping it a bit, his nails biting into the pattern, he shook out his coat and headed to the door.
“I suspect that I will find a history of Hunters in his family,” his sibling stated matter of factly. “If he takes another Wolf out, it’s murder. He, or anyone else that kills you, will go to jail for a very long time. With Sherrinford’s secret out, you have an ambassador-”
, he thought). “I care for your daughter, John. Evy is smart and kind and I love her. But not as anything more than my niece. She is the pup of my brother, the heir to his Pack. It is my duty to protect her and care for her, John. Just as it is my duty to protect and care for you. Do you understand that?”
The girl smiled at him again, giving his hand a knowing squeeze, and followed her father up to 221C. He watched then go with a soft smile playing on his lips, his nostrils flaring at the lingering scents of gunpowder and fresh-cut grass.
“Hello Nadia,” he replied, glad that his secretary worked weekly at the facility even if he didn’t. “I need some files while in London. Could you overnight them to me?”
). They were no longer required to Shift at Transitional Facilities, hence why Baskerville had more areas open to the general public than ever before. The original transitional facility had found new life as a museum after the occupants no longer used it as a safe Shift space. Sherrinford was still in charge of the campus but now so much of what her uncle oversaw fell under medical research, creating better Shift delays while still trying to crack the formula that would prevent the spread of Lycanthropy to those that were infected against their will. The giving of care to patients was something that her uncle took very seriously, carrying out his therapy sessions weekly with those that requested it. Some Lupus sapiens still came to Baskerville monthly, whether due to nostalgia or personal comfort, but most remained at home with their friends and family for the Moon, thick leather collars worn when they ventured outside on four legs. The collars served as a means to identify them as human while bearing color-coding that warned whether they were friendly (Blue) or just wanted to be left alone (Red). It allowed them access to public places, though most simply took the freedom to rove the streets and traverse the parks without fear. Wolves were simply who they were. They were no longer seen as terrifying ‘others’ but as
The meal passed quickly, everyone feeling excited if slightly stressed about the upcoming evening and the following day. The Wolves ate as if it were the end of the world, as did Molly, who was eating for three, one of which was a Natural Born Lupus sapiens. The dishes emptied rapidly and Mycroft’s cake was consumed in hearty bites until nothing was left. The detective rose and cleared the plates, loading them into the dishwasher one by one.
“Well, I know your feelings on the topic. Though, I’m starting to realize that it will have to be breached.” Her father sounded a bit nervous in comparison to her uncle. “I’m ok with it - if you are. All of you.”
He smiled brightly. “It’s time that you learned that Wolves have characteristics that are retained, regardless of the form, Brother. Namely, their eyes-”
Steps on the stairs of 221 Baker Street did not make the child stir, and, not wanting to wake her, he continued to lay still. Sherlock would know where they were. He’d probably deduce that he was in his furry form; he usually was when he ventured into 221C, he realized.
Between her husband and his youngest brother, she was able to get back to the master suite. Upon reaching the door, Sherrinford stopped, opting to lay just outside, his ears twitching, always listening even as his eyes focused on her. She was grateful that the younger man had decided to remain outside. She was not going to be wearing too many articles of clothing very soon and he was protecting her modesty.
His brow crinkling, he rolled over to look the natural born wolf in his deep blue eyes. The other man was looking at the floor, his eyes, usually piercing, were glazed. “How do you know that?” he queried.
The case was...well...it was. The one lead that they had had come back as untraceable: the cigarette smoker wasn’t in the criminal database at the Yard. The other information from Sherrinford only did so much, no matter what he wanted to let slip to Lestrade. He was Sherlock Holmes, after all. He didn’t have any unsolved cases - he just didn’t. Besides, this case had the widest range of effect since Moriarty.
He wandered over to the settee and took an armchair across from it with a soft exhale. “Everything is great,” he said, “Thank you for asking. I appreciate your willingness to do this, Molly. Both you and Mycroft are too kind.”
“Why do you do that?” she asked, her hand still covering her cheek and the atrocious ink blot that resided there.
He shook his head slightly. “If we live through this, I will tell you why.” He scooped the eggs onto two plates and placed them on the table. “And please, Imogen, believe that I truly want to tell you.”
He grinned, knowing that the action was slightly terrifying, but also needing to express his joy some how. Against all odds, he had (
“Yeah,” the older man sighed, his lips twitching into a small smile as he shot a quick glance back at him and his naked glory. The doctor flushed again, turning his back again before taking a seat on the grass. Cross legged, his chin coming to rest in his hand, his Mate murmured, “Stop showing off, Sherlock. I could use a cuddle right now…”
“Come on, John. Admit it - you like me.” Sherrinford did not hide his broad smile, his teeth slipping out momentarily as he chuckled.
Evelyn inhaled excitedly though John’s voice was the one that he heard next. His Mate looked tired and a bit haggard but, as he heard about Mycroft’s demand, he began to look wary. “They’ve come.”
Dinner consumed, dishes washed, Evy back at her homework, Sherrinford left to check on John and to let Sherlock out of the room to use the loo and to (potentially) eat something. A soft yip reached his ears, making him pick up his pace. He opened the door to the spare bedroom to find an awake but groggy John Watson. Sherlock was nuzzling him, still laying on top of the human doctor like a fur rug. “John!” he said cheerfully, grabbing his file, “Welcome back to the land of the living. How are you feeling?”
The apartment was, thankfully, in one piece when they arrived, though the detective was pacing enough to wear a track into the wooden floor. His scent had perforated the area, saturating it with his unique essence. He inhaled deeply.
Closing his eyes, he pulled himself from his four-legged form until he was squatting in the nude beside his bed. Sighing, he stood, rubbing his neck and shaking out his limbs before grabbing his robe. He pulled the silky creation over his skin, cinching his waist and exiting his chamber to join his family in 221C.
The wall, with it’s smattering of maps, scraps of paper, and various photographs, frustrated him. He pulled at his hair, his fingers tugging at the roots before he shook it out. He could hear Sherrinford above him, pacing as he chatted away with someone...
At the top of the stairs, the detective followed his nose to the last door on the left, noting that it was the room that Sherrinford had been placed in. “Mind?” he asked, already reaching for the handle.
Yawning, he nodded and let his head fall to his front paws. Listening to his brother’s retreat, he thought,
The detective’s eye roll was large and impossible to ignore. “I suppose that it might be necessary-”
He waited to the man to meet his eyes before he began to write his prescription, keeping his eyes kind though his mouth was hard. “First, you should tell the person closest to you and invite them to share next month’s Moon with you. It can be either here, at Baskerville, or at your regular facility...” He scanned the files. “Ah, yes. Torchwood. Or,” he paused for dramatic effect, unable to resist, “You Turn more regularly. It is a myth that Turned wolves can only Turn on the Full Moon. If you trust yourself enough, find a secure location, lock yourself in, and force a Shift. The more time you spend as a wolf, the more in-control of your natural instincts you will become.”
“Daddy!” Evelyn said enthusiastically, emerging from the kitchen to wrap her arms around his waist, snuggling close. She placed a kiss on his weathered cheek before adding, “How was your day?”
A rumble of general positivity and happiness at the success of the K13 program moved around the table with wide smiles and shining eyes. “Refocus, please,” Mycroft stated, his hands folding in his lap.
“We know that the murderer is male, of a slightly below average height who has a more than basic knowledge of the lunar calendar and it’s implications on the Lupus sapiens. He drives a diesel car or knows someone who does, and he has access to wolfsbane, which is hard to come by, as well as mistletoe, again, not easy to come by outside of holiday time. He has a smoking habit but is not wealthy, hence the cheap, pre-rolled cigarettes. He also wears a leather jacket and/or boots because he can’t afford good, leather shoes. That is something to start with and something to be aware of. To take it a step further: That cigarette by the curb could be our murderer’s.”
, he snorted, nose pressed to the ground as he traced the trails made by the maids and housekeeper as they had prepared his room.
Evelyn shook her head, used to seeing him freeze suddenly. She probably thought it was one of those strange ticks that everyone developed. A side effect to something or other that he had gotten into before she was born. She did know about his drug habit, Lestrade having run a drugs bust when he was babysitting one night while John was dating a rather horrid woman whom had instantly set him on edge. John came to his senses pretty quickly and the little girl did not judge him for his odd behaviors and he made no move to explain them.
Slowly, she reached a hand out and pulled on the chain of small, metal beads that was currently poking out of his collar. A pair of worn, chipped and dented dog tags flopped out onto his shirt front. “We’ve started to study the Werewolf Rights movement and all werewolves have to wear tags. At least all the registered ones do. The ones that are following Uncle Mycroft’s law.”
Molly tenderly stroked Thomas’ head. The little one yipped once, his nose working furiously in his mother’s direction. “So soft,” the mortician murmured, “Hello Thomas. Mummy and Daddy are right here! Feel him, Myc. It’s amazing.”
“Oh.” He had forgotten about the debate surrounding his eldest brother’s controversial law that ruled the lives of both himself and his other brother. “Which side do you take?” The teen had been through so much regarding his people in the last few days that he was no long sure if she would condemn them or stand by them.
He had been too concerned with the vestigial tail than scars when he’d seen the man naked all that time ago.
He crept through the grass, his shaggy belly fur catching on the strands, his nose following the trails of the small rodents deeper into the night. Though he had originally caught the scent hours ago, the rabbits were still out, tasting bits of his mother’s prized garden. Catching the old, weak one was easy and he only had to bowl over one petunia to do it.
. “I’ll get the scent description out to the K13s but I’m not sure if we can do anything about it. The input is great, Sherrinford, but I don’t know what else to use-”
Lestrade sent the younger officer a grateful smile, glad that he had covered for the other man, but then he realized that the K13 didn’t know about Sherrinford Holmes the Natural Born werewolf.
The next morning, he woke to find Evelyn Watson pressed against his back, arms wrapped around his neck, face buried into his ruff. Steady, even breaths played through his coppery coat, making him sigh calmly. His ears flickered about, catching the muted conversation that John was having with Sherlock. Both men were nervous, discussing options and possibilities for their relationship as Mates as well as the potential for John to become a target if the wolf murderer killed again.
She certainly liked to think so, though she definitely didn’t have the time, energy, or money to put into making it as special as she’d like. Most of the furniture was secondhand and the paint that clung to the walls was a bit drab and chipped in places, but it was home.
The taller man cocked his auburn head. “It hasn’t stopped you,” the other man whispered with a soft smile, his eyes flicking to Molly’s rounded shape. “They are willing to take the same chance.”
He rolled his eyes. The drama between the pair of Wolves played out similarly every time they Turned together. Sherrinford, being Natural Born, was faster and more adept at every part of being a Wolf. However, though their common bloodline, and the fact that the younger man was his last addition to his rather unorthodox Pack, he usually triumphed. Secretly, he knew that Sherrinford was letting him win, which made the whole exercise tiresome and completely unnecessary to his human logic. His wolf instincts, however, were immediately drawn to the fore directly after a Shift and demanded the drama to play out continuously. “Must we?” he muttered, making the auburn-haired man chuckle.
He slowly edged his way back along the alley, hoping that he wasn’t too far away from his squad car. He shouldn’t have been chasing the bloody perp to begin with. All he did was slip out of the drunk tank. But no, he was DI Greg Lestrade and he didn’t let anything slip by his watch.
) on the other end. “Detective Inspector, I hope that your people are on this.” The lofty tones of Mycroft Holmes cut through the Wolves’ cacophony.
“Was I, John?” he growled low in his throat, whipping his head around to face the shorter man. “Because last I checked, you wanted her sheltered from all of this.”
“Yes,” his youngest sibling chuckled, opening the door and exiting the vehicle, stopping to inhale deeply, checking his territory. “It’s close.”
“How is she?” the Wolf asked, the realization that the teen was probably worried sick about him sinking in. His Shift, incarceration, and assassination attempt had, no doubt, made the news. And Evelyn was incredibly preceptive and attentive, even if her fathers had shielded her.
Not waiting, knowing that the usually overbearing Mycroft, would follow, he left the flat and made his way down the quiet halls. Making a quick stop at his office to grab his notes, which his shoved into his brother’s waiting hands, he made his way to the central courtyard. The open space was large enough to hold all the Wolves in one spot before they dispersed about the campus for their Shifts.
. He raised his head, making the woman jump a bit at the top of the stairs. “He’s a big beast, isn’t he?” she breathed, walking by him even though her fear skyrocketed. He opened his mouth, panting, and gave his tail a small wag.
“And what if I did?” he shot back, processing her surprise and slight embarrassment that carried through her voice and her thrumming veins.
“I don’t want to, Sherrinford. I-I don’t think I can. I never wanted to. Please know that,” she breathed, tears flooding her eyes and running down her cheeks. “I meant it when I told you that I love you, Sherrinford. I am not
As he entered, the men there stopped and turned, nostrils flaring. Several pairs of eyes narrowed at him. He smiled, lips closed, and gave a small wave, “Hello, Gentlemen.”
Mycroft sighed, giving him a small nod. “Glad you could come,” he murmured, “Meet your nephews: Thomas and Benedict.” The man shifted his arms slightly, allowing him enter and snuffle about the babies.
Sherlock waved him away, already fascinated by the month old Pup and his tiny appendages. “Grab my mobile and my measuring stick while you’re out!” the detective called, completely unaware that both items sat on his bedside table.
“That’s what Ms. Crowley said. I still think it’d be cool, though.” She stood and shoved her homework back into her school bag, readying herself for bed. A thought, more like a memory flashed into her mind. It was old, almost grainy - from when she was a young girl.
“Well, for the most part. Stevenson’s Pack will be a wreck for the first hour or so, but after that, they should be alright. Remind me, when all this is done, to pay Sean a visit. I want to hear more about his new job.” He cocked his head playfully before asking, “Shall we?”
, he reiterated to himself even as he wanted to tell the petite brunette everything and more. “I’m getting a new patient, yes. A type of patient that I’ve never dealt with before and he will need most of my time and attention for a while.”
The man continued to shake his head back and forth. “I mean it, Sherrinford. None of this is your fault.”
“Of course,” the soldier replied, accepting the keys and the access card, sliding them into a pocket, heading towards the door. “Are you coming, Evy?”
The sound of a door slamming below told him that at least one of the Holmes brothers was home. “Mrs. Hudson!” the deep voice of the detective called from the foyer. “Dinner is nearly ready.”
IMAGE ON CCTV - FACE COVERED BY HOODIE BUT DEFINITELY MALE. STEVENSON FREQUENTED A PUB, THE RED LION, ON TUESDAYS. ALWAYS FROM 9-11. CAME AND LEFT ALONE. NOTHING ELSE OUT OF THE ORDINARY. - MH
Slipping into the back seat of his town car, he sighed. His own stupidity had brought this on, but so had Sherrinford’s rashness as well as St. Pierre’s serial Turning streak. No one had been Turned since the deceased Wolf had been ‘put-down,’ to use the term that the Houses of Parliament had been using when discussing what to do with the ‘Werewolf Problem.’ Either way, his task, laid before him partially of his own volition and partially as a request from New Scotland Yard, would not be an easy one.
Raising the instrument to his chin, he turned away from the younger man, doubting his weak defense. “I suggest you get another date with her. I can’t have our Pack compromised.”
After an hour of staring, he pulled his robe off and shook himself onto four legs. Shifting did nothing to stop his whirling thoughts - it hadn’t for a long time. He was focused on what was coming, on what his brother had done. Taking the step from the shadows and into the glaring light might have given Sherrinford freedom to be himself but it felt like he was being further restrained. After all, the Holmes family had a reputation to uphold and one monster was more than enough for the public to handle. Having two sons and a grandson mucking about on four legs would ruin everything that his posh parents had created and it would ruin Mycroft and his powerful career.
“Where are they?” Lucy squealed quietly, her eyes wide. Nathaniel looked just as excited but he masked it well.
, he calculated, though it did not seem like a short enough time for Molly, who groaned, rubbing her stomach gently.
“No,” he intoned, adding a bit of Alpha to his voice, “You are the same. The sooner you accept that, the easier it will be for you to retain your memories and your common sense during the Moon.”
With another kiss, he took his charge from his Mate and left their room with another backward glance. Imogen smiled as she watched them leave, one of her hands pressed to her abdomen. His feet brought him down the stairs and into the kitchen, his desire to get back to the bedridden woman so instinctually strong that it was terrifying. Molly was there, Benedict at her breast. “Oh, hey, Sherrinford. Is he fussy?”
The woman smiled, still rubbing her stomach even as her hand came up to rub her neck. Unlike her own father, who had decided against being Turned and had continuously insisted that she not get Bitten at all, her former teacher had taken a Mate Mark and become a Turned Lupus sapiens as soon as she had been cleared of all charges. She had been the first to complete (and help perfect) the process of becoming a Lupus sapiens, though she had insisted on being Bitten instead of injected with venom.
It was peaceful. The nocturnal sounds of the moor and the forest beyond tickled his ears, causing them to flick this way and that. Somewhere, in one of the many Pack enclosures, a lone Wolf took up his call. His Packmates joined him, the cacophony making beautiful music to the stars, blotting out the crickets.
The man, palpitating his upper torso and rotator cuff before offering the newborn his finger to hold, muttered, “Couldn’t leave you to bleed out. Evelyn would never forgive me if I let her favorite uncle die on my watch.” The older man chuckled, his teeth flashing briefly before his lips covered them again.
His padded feet took him down the hall, his tail swishing as his claws scraped against the well-worn wood. Once he reached the end of the hallway, he grinned at the sight before him. Stretching, his paws skidding a bit on the hardwood, he made his way back to the bassinet. His eldest brother was sitting beside it, his cool demeanor converted into a small, tender smile as his hand rose and fell with the motion of his sons’ chests. Smiling a bit to himself, he lay beside the basket, body curling about it protectively.
He nudged the other Wolf, worried about the attention they were receiving, causing the younger man to stumble a bit to his right, not breaking eye contact with the woman even as one of his ears swiveled to face him. Sherlock growled and nipped at Sherrinford’s ear, shaking the other man from his revery, nipping back at his snout with a huff. With a desperate nudge, he turned his brother away from the mysterious woman and turned for Baker Street. He could feel her eyes on them as they retreated, making him antsy and jumpy. He did not like the way she was staring at them. It was as if she knew what they were.
The ultrasound room was relatively close to the entrance of the second building, his hospital wing. While the surgery, equipped for both human patients and their four-legged forms, seemed normal, it was odd for him to have an ultrasound machine. However, with Sean’s wife in a family way, he felt the need to check on their child and he had petitioned the government for one (It was human). Thus, the ultrasound machine was purchased. Swinging the door open, he gestured Molly and his eldest brother into the darkened room. “Let’s take a look, shall we?”
The other man smiled, teeth out. “Oh, yes. That’s the plan. You’re in the clear. He explicitly stated that he was alone, an unexpected monster in an ordinary family.”
With a sigh, he lay down at Molly’s feet, warming them and her swollen ankles with his high temperature. His eyes, still blue and human, he knew, followed the frantic hands of Evelyn Watson as she gave his Alpha, her quasi-parent, a belly rub. John, who had adapted surprisingly well to being the other Wolf’s Mate, rubbed too, laughing at the carefree detective.
. A second later, the sound of a door slamming caused both men to jump. The smell of denim and cotton sank into his flared nostrils.
) and raised his head to look at the other man in his eyes before grinning, his tongue lolling out in a pant. Licking his Mate, he cuddled into him further, trying to show the other man that he had feelings for him, too. Feelings that he had tried to suppress but was failing to after all these years. “I know you do, Sherlock,” John murmured, scratching behind one of his ears (Sending his leg that was dangling off the arm chair shaking). “I’m just afraid. I’m not gay…right? And what about Evy? What would everyone else think?”
Eventually, their stare off ended with John sighing, pulling the laptop away from his chest to read the entry. “It reads, ‘
“Thank you,” he replied, gathering his shaky courage and his nearly nonexistent confidence as he strode into the chamber, all the eyes of the leading men in Britain on him. He fixed his face into a mask of pacificity even as the hair on the back of his neck rose. He knew that he was entering a hostile environment, something that his instincts pushed against vehemently, but he continued to move further and further into it. Becoming defensive would not help him now. He may be walking into a trap, but it was one that he was knowingly springing.
A small, tender hand raised slowly to cup his cheek, rubbing the patchy scruff there. “He’s adorable.” Her smile made him melt. Her other hand teased the Pup, his mouth opening and closing in search of his bottle. “Hello! Aren’t you the most precious thing?”
He sighed, stomping his tired feet up to his flat cursing the third floor location in harsh, muted tones while simultaneously glad of the exercise.
John chuckled humorlessly. “You hate that it keeps you from escaping the business of your Mind Palace.”
He smiled, recalling the conversation that he had had with the young man who had inspired the movement.
“Have a seat,” the statesman said with a small roll of his eyes, “I’m glad that you’re in a chatty mood today.”
He shook his head, his mouth occupied by his breakfast. Swallowing, he added, “You should be there. You’re handling this evening, after all, and you should be aware of the faces that go with the names.”
His final stop was at Sean’s flat. Knocking on the door, he waited for it to open and tipped his head when it did, submitting in another Wolf’s territory. Elizabeth, glowing beautifully with a small, four month bump, greeted him. “Dr. Holmes! How are you?”
“Mycroft called me at work. Said that he couldn’t reach you even though he tried calling six times!” his Mate shouted, moving to block the picture. “Sherrinford’s been
He watched the man go, already regretting his presence. He would not be allowed to speak. He could do nothing but watch as his Law was dissected and rebuilt, hopefully with more freedoms and fewer restrictions. Exhaling steadily, he made his way into the gallery of the chamber. He had to be his brothers’ eyes and ears and hope for the best.
“Nothing,” came the other man’s reply. It was obviously a lie, but he smiled at Evelyn and helped her from his youngest sibling’s shoulders. “Did you learn anything new, my lovely girl?”
“See how long you can postpone - I need to be at Baskerville for the Moon and for my new patient. You will then capture me after and bring me to your leader.” The werewolf on the other side of the barrier chuckled. “I’ve always wanted to say that: ‘Take me to your leader.’ Ehehehe.”
“And you did such a lovely job with Evelyn,” Mycroft threw in snidely, a smirk twisting his upper lip, “I don’t see why you wouldn’t do the same with your nephew.”
Placing that thought at the back of his mind, Sherrinford refocused. He gave them, especially Evelyn, whom he had missed desperately, a soft smile before rushing past to stop the over-eager elder pair of twins.
The tawny wolf nodded sharply with a soft exhale and trotted through the gate, his tags clicking jovially as his claws beat a tattoo on the packed earth. Apparently, unable to resist, Sherlock left his side and snapped playfully at the other Wolf’s flank before darting away. A brief game of chase ensued, the pair racing about the carpark and main entrance grounds of the facility, yipping and snapping at each other. “Come on, Boys!” he yelled from the doorway, “Let’s get a move on.”
“He does miss you, Evelyn,” the grey-haired man smiled, his teeth flashing. She briefly wondered what her other father and uncle would look like if they smiled with their teeth showing.
With a deep sigh, he sat behind the table and reached towards the first file. “Since this is his idea, let’s take Eddington first.” Idly flipping through the file that he knew rather well, he expected Sergeant Isaac Eddington to pass with flying colors. He was not one of his, Shifting at Torchwood with most of the K13s, but he was an early victim of St. Pierre and, if his file was to be believed, he seemed to keep his head about him on the night of the Moon.
“Wonderful,” the natural born Lupus sapiens smiled brightly. “I’ll look forward to speaking with him in the next couple of days.”
The tears came, cutting rivulets down his cheeks. He wiped them away quickly with the silk sleeve of the dressing gown. Molly smiled at him and offered him her free hand, which he took with a tight smile. “We’re going to need some help,” she said kindly. “I couldn’t think of a better teacher than you! You can help all of us.” She laughed, moving his hand to the side of her bump where the Pup was thrashing back into it’s human shape. “We’re going to need it.”
He took another inhale and Shifted, shaking his coat to it’s full length and luster as his snout and tail erupted and his paws gripped the carpet fibers. With a soft whine, he extricated himself from the remains of his pants. The eyes that were focused on him in his struggle made him self-conscious, his ears flattening themselves against the sides of his wedge-shaped skull and he retreated several steps until his tail brushed the back wall. He fixed Mycroft in his wide, overwhelmed gaze, needing the man to get him out of the suddenly confining flat.
His original thirty were here. They had all grow into their furry forms well and had even been given a special yard for their thirty-person Pack to roam about when they Turned together, their territory covering the better part of five acres. Other similar Packs had begun to form and some Wolves had even begun to bring their loved ones, making the entire experience much less traumatic. One even transformed in a slightly modified apartment with his family petting and playing with him, as Evelyn did with Sherlock.
“Well handled, Brother Dearest,” the voice of his eldest sibling called behind him. He paused, beaming back at him with his teeth flashing.
“Hmmm,” he hummed, “Prejudice at it’s finest.” He spun himself away from the man and flopped down on the couch, his hands rising to rest beneath his chin. “I hate the New Moon.”
“But...” the girl moped, her eyes growing hugely as she begged almost as if she were one of the oversized puppies that his brothers turned into.
“I was thinking that, for once in my life, I can live as I choose, even if it means that my life is forfeit.”
Mycroft didn’t reply verbally, though his eyebrows rose before turning to the stair. “I’ll show you to your room,” his brother intoned, striding up the stairs. Still rather in awe of how his eldest brother lived, the sheer size of the foyer, much less the mansion status of this residence made him wonder why Sherlock chose to live the way he did - in a dingy flat that he paid rent on. Mycroft stepped off the stairs on the second floor landing and followed the hallway to it’s end, opening the door on the left side. “It faces the back yard,” the older man stated, “And it’s only on the second floor. Figured that’d be better to deal with on four legs. Besides, the nursery is on this floor. First door on the right.”
Sherlock lay down, done with hiding from his family. If Sherrinford could place his trust in the two children, then he could to. He sighed, waiting for the onslaught of Puppy enthusiasm, glad to have his Mate and child beside him.
“And it couldn’t come over the phone?” his elder brother asked, his frustration seeping into his voice.
Her great-uncle’s mansion loomed before them. She drew closer to Sherrinford, needing his warmth to remind her that everything was going to turn out just fine. He pressed his nose back into her ponytail, inhaling deeply.
“Yeah,” the woman murmured, her eyes wide but her fear subsiding a bit. “Let’s see to the Missus, shall we?”
He smiled at her kindly, cupping her cheek with his hand tenderly. “Darling, that is true, but dog tags have been used by the military for over one hundred years to identify soldiers if they’re killed in battle.” His hand rose to play with the thin pieces of metal that hung off the chain. “These are mine. We did three tours of Afghanistan, me and these tags. I wore them the day I left home. I wore them the day I was shot. I wore them the day you were born and I will wear them until I die. Then they’ll be yours.”
“But what’s the plan?” He leaned closer to the receiver, intrigued. Imogen Crowley had proven to be a lot more interesting than he though she’d be at their single, brief meeting.
. The grey-haired man cleared his throat, causing the Wolf’s head to whip around, facing them, hackles raising and teeth exposed.
Mycroft stewed, again reminded that he was a Subordinate in his middle brother’s Pack. It was strange and he wasn’t entirely sure he liked the lack of authority or relished it. Finally, his youngest brother greeted him, his lips pressed together in a smile, his chin slightly raised in a power play. “Mycroft.”
“A few ground rules before we begin. No photography and no recording is allowed on grounds, seeing as the men here are, in fact men, and, like myself, are unable to give verbal consent to being captured on film and then placed on the internet. Do not touch any of the Wolves without expressed permission. Do not taunt them. Do not feed them. They are men but have the instincts of a wild animal as well. They should be treated with respect, as one would treat a strange dog that happened to have the intelligence to understand what you are saying. If you have questions, please feel free to ask them. My brother, Mycroft Holmes, will be on hand to speak about anything that piques your curiosity. He is well-versed in the world of Lupus sapiens and is also the acting Deputy Director of Baskerville as well as my mouthpiece when my lips are no longer able to form words.” He smirked slightly, setting the crowd chuckling again.
His mobile buzzed, drawing his attention to the inevitable complaint text from Sherrinford. He’d have to find another babysitter for Thomas if he couldn’t escape the delegates and government officials that would be touring the facility.
“Only with your consent,” he replied. “Only if that was what you truly wanted. Your life is your own and I won’t make any decisions for you. I can only have hopes for our future together. A future that I can still hope for, once this has passed. If you’ll have a natural born Lupus sapiens?”
The door slowly opened behind them with a creak. The white head of his father appeared, a sheepish grin on his face. “Oh, I’m sorry boys,” he said, “But I thought you might like breakfast.”
. He tucked the information away, trying not to let the worry ruin the evening. He could be wrong, after all. There were ways to test and check, all of which he knew but could not perform, due to his lack of hands. John, on the other hand, could run the tests next month, just to be sure.
She was lying in bed, pretending to sleep, listening to the conversation that was coming from the kitchen beyond. It made little sense but she had always found her Uncle Sherlock’s deep voice to be comforting, even if he could be a bit brusque. It was the perfect timbre to promote sleep.
He nodded, guessing the the man would want to talk. “Please,” he said kindly but authoritatively, “Have a seat.”
“He’ll be furry, yes, but relatively harmless. If that makes you nervous, Sherlock will simply have to do. Unless you want the family secret escaping?” There was no reply. He knew that Mycroft valued the protection of their family more than anything else in the world, including England itself.
Standing at the threshold of the inevitable, of destiny, of fate, was terrifying. He tried to keep his cool, keep from letting his plan slip before he was ready to unveil it.
There were thirty K13’s in all, though only 26 were coming that evening. They were all veterans, having been Turned by St. Pierre at least five years ago. The four remaining K13s were the unfortunate victims of the man’s escape almost two months previous. Those men, under his charge at the Moon, were not adjusted enough to handle the stimulation that he was going to make the other men undergo. While he had a flutter of hope in his stomach, he was also a realist. Things could go horribly wrong if the Wolves attacked the two men with him. He was stronger and more adept than any of them and would escape relatively unharmed, though unmasked. Mycroft and Lestrade, however, were not as young as they thought they were. They may not have the strength to survive the shock to the system that was the Bite.
He sighed, rather annoyed at the man’s inability to cooperate. “I believe that people are people, regardless. Besides, I have a family member who’s just like you. I don’t want a serial killer on our hands.”
, she thought, looking around the small kitchen. Despite their oddities, her family was truly perfect.
The red head laughed lightly, her hand still rubbing at the protrusion. “Of course it’s shifting, Sherrinford!” she chortled, “It’s trying to find room in a small, uncomfortable space.”
“There is something that you’re going to want to hear,” the Wolf stated, the sound of his chair scraping closer to the phone coming across the line. “The murders are definitely being carried out by Hunters and I am the next target.”
When he arrived, furry and panting from exertion, he was rather glad to catch John just as he was closing the door. The man cocked an eyebrow, obviously not aware that Sherlock ‘Needed to Talk’. He tipped his head to the right ever so slightly, his newly awakened inner Alpha snarling at the very thought, and pushed past the man. He took the steps in leaps, easily making it to the third floor before the doctor, the scent of Italian food and salt pulling him upward.
Evelyn came bounding back into the room, tugging an already tired looking John behind her. “When can we see the werewolves, Uncle Mycroft?” she asked excitedly.
Putting her curiosity aside briefly, she walked up the stairs, passing 221B and made her way to her own flat to set down her bag. It was empty, as it usually was at this time of day, so she threw her bag on the table and pulled her homework out to begin setting to work once dinner was in the oven. Her father had taken over food duty since Sherlock was ‘on the case’ and ‘didn’t eat’ because it ‘slowed him down.’ The Wolf inside would not let the man go hungry, but he truly only ate when something was set in front of him. That left the cooking to her overworked, overanxious father. The least she could do was put the casserole dish into the oven and keep it from burning.
The detective nodded. “Of course.” The man released a small smile in his direction before his face went blank again.
The other wolf leaned forward, his jaw set. “You make it sound like you want to actually find a cure, Sherlock,” he said pointedly. “Unhappy?”
“Why would one of you want to help one of us?” the bald man, obviously the Alpha within their little gathering.
She knew that she was trembling now, her mouth open and her eyes wide. She knew that the plan they had worked so hard on had vanished. She knew that her family had never intended to give her the opportunity to kill Sherrinford Holmes. She had been the bait, the person to draw him there, and nothing more.
“Can’t have ‘em catching the Wolf,” the bald man practically snarled. “Surprised that Scotland Yard’s even caring about Stevenson and send a detective out here to talk to the likes of us. I’m surprised that they haven’t just passed it off as good riddance. A dead dog is better than a living problem.”
It was surreal, really. This enormous secret that had covered so much of his life and the lives of the people around him, his family in a way, had been revealed to one of the people who truly mattered most to him. And she had taken it in stride, after the initial shock of it all.
“If the shots came from below and above, how can you guess this man’s height?” Lestrade asked, lost and not following.
Attempting to comfort her, he lay down with a faint whine and a couple of solid thumps of his tail on the polished oak of the floor. His brother, not to be out done, trotted forward before laying at the girl’s feet, his own tail wagging expectantly. “Wuh-Willie?” she hesitated, a hand extended. The dark wolf, curling fur rustling gently, licked it. She giggled, reaching out to scratch the other wolf’s ears, causing the tags to click together and his brother’s leg to jiggle. He panted, tongue lolling out over his sharp teeth and his eyes closing in utter contentment.
“Oh Lucy,” he said, still smiling, “You’re so special, just the way you are. Besides, being a wolf is not just a ‘cool’ thing that I can do. It’s hard because there are a lot of people that are scared of me because of who I am. I don’t have very many friends and I have to be careful about who I tell my secret to so that no one hurts anyone that I love because of it. Can you keep my secret?”
Imogen pulled some of her hair over her shoulder and straightened in her seat. “You will follow at a close but safe distance. Please bring the K13’s and any officers and agents who are sympathetic to the Wolves’ cause.”
. “Yes, but his job is of little importance to anyone who isn’t a werewolf. And there are so few.” He stood, pushing his chair back, the hair on the back of his neck bristling at the notion that his secret, and that of his younger sibling, was going to be revealed to the little girl that they both deeply cared for. “Shouldn’t your teacher actually teach you something of importance? Like how to differentiate soil based on the amount of loam, silt, sand, and clay with in it? Or how about the
He signed off before releasing his pent up growl and turning back to the list of his waiting clients. There were more important matters than one center manager who refused to be a decent human being.
“This is going to be a stressful Moon,” the detective realized, hearing Sherrinford plundering the fridge behind him, obviously starving from his Shifts. “Evelyn made dinner upstairs. There’s some leftovers for you.”
He chuckled, wrapping an arm around Molly’s back and offering her his other hand, which she squeezed tenderly. Slowly, he helped her to her swollen feet before moving his hands to cradled her stomach. “Twins again, Mycroft Holmes,” she chided. “And at my age. How could you?” Her lips met his, showing him that all was forgiven.
His eyes narrowed. “That’s a bold assumption. I know that you’ve put yourself out there as the face of the movement but there’s no guarantee that you’re the next target.”
He wasn’t entirely sure why he had packed a bag. It was highly unlikely that he would be wearing many articles of clothing while he was at Downing Street. He still had a flat at Baskerville where many of his meager belongings were located and he’d still be returning there on the days around the Moon, his nephew in tow with the rest of his eldest brother’s family. Even then, he’d only spend the patient time as a man and the rest as a Wolf, the Pup lacking any sort of control around the Moon.
Images, flashes of his sons’ childhoods as they should be appeared before his eyes alongside pictures of what could become reality.
The position left the rogue Wolf’s body open for him to take a shot, inhaling slowly, Greg raised his sidearm and leveled it at the beast’s chest, hoping the bullet would weaken the brute at worst, and puncture a lung at best. His hopes were realized as the projectile punched through the grey wolf’s ribcage and the animal’s jaws let go of the doctor’s shoulder. Sherrinford, casting him a quick glance before deferring to his Alpha, did not let go. Sherlock dropped the hind leg and growled low in his throat. With what came across as grim satisfaction, the younger wolf gave his head a violent shake, snapping the grey wolf’s neck.
“Molly’s gone to bed and I’ll be right behind her. Still determined to take the night shift?” the Government asked, his eyes carrying a tired glint in their depths.
. And he understood the man’s desire for his own space. After all, he was never pleased to have another Wolf in 221B, including his younger brother. It took so long for the scent to truly leave the flat.
“Yes, Angel,” he replied before patting the table and rising to begin dinner. “I’m sure that your uncle can tell you all about it tomorrow.”
“Good night!” she called after him, her face hot with the fierce blush it was sporting. Slipping into her flat, she closed the door firmly behind her and flicked the light on. “Oh, my God, Imogen! He’s
Setting his radio, now a buzz with activity, aside, he reached for his mobile and punched in a number that he hoped would be answered. A familiar voice picked up on the third ring.
He smiled up at her and his elder brother. “You don’t have to,” he grinned, “It’s enough to know that this little one will have a better childhood than I did.”
“You’re right about that,” the man murmured, one of his hands reaching across the table to take one of hers tenderly. She stiffened, waiting for the worst.
“And yet, she seemed to know that we were not ‘normal’ dogs.” He plucked at the strings of his Stradivarius, tuning them nimbly.
He nodded. They had taken enormous strides in their relationship over the last few days in the semi-privacy of the Holmes’ country home. The first night had been filled with exploring and learning, John discovering everything about his ‘new’ body as he learned every line of his. Every twist of scar-tissue, every tracing of hair, every place of arousal. Last night, the night of the Full Moon, they had run together beneath her rays and, as the morning light had taken him from his fur, they had consummated their relationship in the filtered light of the forest, solidifying their dedication to each other, and cementing their status as Alphas of their odd little pack. “You know I don’t care what Sherrinford or anyone else has to say,” he stated, his nose inhaling the wondrous odor of gunpowder and sex and
The dark, shaggy wolf trotted ahead of him, allowing him to stand at his shoulder. It was the position of the Pack Beta, the second-in-command. If Mycroft understood Wolf dynamics and hierarchy, he’d be stewing right now.
Mycroft Holmes leapt from their bed and rushed to grab his mobile. She smiled, despite her growing discomfort, and moved to stand on her unsteady feet. The contractions became more frequent and more painful, but she knew that it would be a few hours yet before the big show. Molly closed her eyes and inhaled slowly, centering herself before rising. “I’ll get Sherrinford up. Let him know,” she grunted.
As the class filed out, he gave Evelyn a wave and a smile. “I will meet you in the hallway, Darling,” he said proudly. The teen beamed at him, her teeth flashing.
The crowd fell silent, eyes fixated on him. Slowly, he closed his eyes and squatted, his fingers brushing the carpet of the adjoining parlor. His tags bounced against his chest with the movement. His collar was tucked into his trouser pocket and there it would stay for the night. He was done hiding in plain sight.
Rising a bit stiffly, he pulled his robe tighter about his thin frame and walked to the door of 221B. He opened the door and leaned against the frame, smiling broadly yet tight-lipped at the two people who were making their way up the stairs.
“I’ve always had a soft-spot for dogs,” the low baritone murmured, his mercurial eyes focused on the baby with a gentle affection. “Thomas has made me realize it again.”
She laughed. “When are they not, Myc?” She shook her head. “Are you coming to help me get to dinner?”
“They’re bigots and killers. You’ve proven that to me time and time again,” she murmured, explaining her decision. “So, I’ll ask again: What do you need me to do?”
“Well, Uncle Sherlock helped, but yes, I made it.” The young woman was positively beaming, her warm scent of lilac, wool, crayon, grass and vanilla (a recent addition as she matured) mingling with her father’s unique fragrance, filling his home (Den) with the smells and sounds of home.
As sunset neared, he finished the preparations of the tanks and made his way back to the apartment and his Pack. He opened the door to find Sherlock sitting on the couch, eyes closed, hands under his chin. Molly looked uncomfortable, her hand pressed against the (no doubt Shifting) baby and Mycroft looked bored. “How is everything?” the detective asked quietly, shutting the door behind him as his eyes opened slowly.
Instead, he threw off the robe and tossed it onto the sofa with a stiff ‘You’re Welcome’ and Shifted, heading out into the night and back to Downing Street.
The teen relinquished her grip on the older woman and gestured them towards the table with a worried look on her face. “What about Uncle Ford?” she asked, her voice quiet.
He shook his head, chuckling a bit at her train of thought. “You are so right. I never thought of it that way.”
at hiding his wolfish traits - his flaring nostrils, his sniffing, his head tilting, his smiles without teeth - that she had figured it out quickly, especially with her upbringing. It hadn’t bothered her, really; not at first. And now, now she was thinking that it had been a horrible idea to have continued their relationship with that hidden knowledge. “God,” she breathed again, rubbing her temples with her fingers.
to be able to take my Shifted form without fear of being discharged or worse, locked away for ‘giving in’ to the animal.” His eyes shot up to look at him in the face for the first time. “Please Mr. Holmes,” he murmured, begging, “Change the Law. Let us do our jobs to the best of our abilities.”
He gave the pair a tight-lipped smile. “Let’s get you gentlemen inside, shall we?” he intoned, turning, umbrella swinging at his side. He knew that they followed, even though they were silent, padded paws on gravel and grass. A soft whine escaped one of them, sad to leave the wild for the restricting white of the building. The sound made him smile sadly as he swiped his card to gain access to the residential building and strode in, followed by the sound of claws clicking along the linoleum. He heard a tired sigh. “The guest room is empty if one of you wishes to take it.”
The children predictably woke every two to two and a half hours in the night. Shifting back and forth presented him with a slight problem that was quickly corrected, the blanket on the back of one of Molly’s well-worn sofas covering his modesty in case the cries woke his sibling and his sister-in-law. They didn’t (thankfully), but he vowed to buy and bring a robe everywhere after tripping over the carpet, warmed bottles sloshing droplets onto his exposed arms and chest. The smell of breast milk was not among his favorites but it clung to him for the rest of the evening, even after Shifting twice after the incident.
“Yes, I can smell the raw steaks.” The veterinarian turned to face him with a large smile on his face. “Brilliant. Especially if we’re not getting out tonight.”
He shook his head and headed to the nearest cruiser, hoping that Eddington hadn’t left yet. They had a lot to discuss.
“Everyone is fine and yes, Molly is resting,” he replied, cocking his head. “Things did not go well, did they?”
The older man, the silver of his hair catching the moonlight, closed the door behind him and lay beside him. Hesitantly, the man’s lips brushed his, setting his body on fire with desire. He deepened the kiss, pulling his mate down onto the mattress beside him.
When they were finally back in their shared flat, Sherlock retreated to his room to allow his bones to rearrange themselves. He could hear Sherrinford finish well ahead of him, the other man simply releasing a soft sigh through the process. The detective gritted his shifting teeth and, once everything was back in it’s proper place, he threw a robe about his body, not wanting to redress.
Unlocking the door to his family’s flat, he ushered the duo of wolves in and knelt. Sherlock’s nostrils flared but he sat, the sunrise beginning to cast lengthy shadows across the floor. After a moment’s hesitation, Sherrinford followed suit, keeping one eye on the Alpha. “I’m just going to take these off,” he murmured softly, keeping his voice deep and low, non-threatening. He quickly pulled off Sherlock’s well-worn collar, shaking the tags free and ruffling his neck a bit, causing his younger sibling’s tail to thump on the floor a couple times. He repeated the action with Sherrinford, who took the collar from his hand and began to chew it off in a corner of the kitchen. He watched Sherlock retreat down the hallway and into the guest room, the door clicking shut behind him. Silence descended upon the flat. Molly, and hopefully, the babies within her, would continue to nap for another couple hours.
Her thoughts had carried her to the steps of 221 Baker Street and she produced a key, fitted it in the lock and entered the building. She inhaled deeply, taking in the faint scent of gunpowder that made her eyebrows raise.
John blinked at him. “Yes, of course. It went public when the addendum to Mycroft’s Act was passed about six years ago.”
Her heart stopped, unable to see what had happened, looking from her rather poor vantage point to see if it was a flesh wound or a mortal blow. She tugged at her wrist, still astonished by the impossibly tight grasp the old man had.
A cursory sniff of the air told him that the house staff had been dismissed in the morning, their steps leaving en masse from the front door for three days. The flowers were in varying stages of bloom, the gardener was getting lazy (and old) and simply couldn’t (or didn’t want to) keep up. There was a brace of rabbits nearby. He made a note of the direction for later - they’d make a great snack.
“He ordered your hit,” the statesman reasoned, his nemesis’ need to create holding centers and his prompt action against Sherrinford’s plea making more sense, puzzle pieces flying into place.
