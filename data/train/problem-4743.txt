A grey cat, and three tiny scraggly-looking kittens. One of the kittens was fidgeting with what seemed to be a tiny version of the oxygen mask Peter had, while the other two kittens nursed from the mother cat. She was lapping at a bowl of water, occasionally pausing to glance over at the masked kitten as if to make sure it was still there.
Steve gave him his number and sent him on his way, confident he was awake enough at least to get home alright. Then he cleaned up the spilt coffee and soggy danish and mopped again.
Tony braced himself against the cold, the suit jacket which had been sufficient to keep him almost warm now soaked through, sending icy misery through his body, worse when a gust of wind buffeted him. He gritted his teeth and reached for his phone, cold fingers fumbling once before managing to grab it.
“No, Stevie, let’s just buy him something. You know those games are always rigged.” Bucky was pretty sure that was something that hadn’t changed since their childhood.
Right there on the doorstep, as that single blue eye watched in confusion, Tony unhooked his belt, unzipped his fly, and then pulled the edge of his jeans down just enough to reveal the pink flower on his hip. The shape that had now been visible for a record forty-three days.
The thought of what his death--or his return to the Winter Soldier--would do to Tony hurt Bucky more than the idea of death itself.
The man--presumably Steve’s roommate Bucky--gestured Tony inside, then started picking up, tossing a blanket from the floor onto the sofa, picking up a pizza box and some glasses from the coffee table and carrying them to a tiny kitchenette. The place was cramped and in disrepair, but it looked lived in, books and pens and notebooks strewn around, photos and art decorating the walls.
along the lines of ‘no’ or ‘I can’t’, I’m going to stop and ask what you need, and you’re going to tell me. If you need to keep going, we can. If you need to stop and cuddle, then we’ll do that.”
Something flickers across Tony’s face too fast for Steve to identify, but it gives him a moment of concern. Taking a guess, Steve emphasizes, “
Tony grimaced in sympathy. Work had been hard to find for some returning from the war, and he imagined it was even harder for amputees.
Instead, Tony simply greeted, “How can I help you? Need that fixed, or wanting to sell it?” He nodded at the radio.
When he pulled away, Tony’s eyes met his for a moment, then glanced to Steve, and some of his normal cockiness seemed to come back (not that shy Tony wasn’t adorable). “Now don’t be jealous, you can have some, too...” He tilted his cheek toward Steve.
Tony started to glare, then shrugged. “Sure. JARVIS, I want protocols in place to alert me, or Steve or Nat if I’m not available, if you detect that Bucky is awake and unresponsive for more than five minutes.”
He tracks the target down a day later, but the task is harder with the armed escort, and he takes a couple bullets.
With Steve’s shouted warning, Tony had managed to turn enough that now he’s on his back, Steve lying on top of him. A gauntlet raises to blast the offending robot to pieces, then drops back down as the faceplate retracts.
The response shocks Steve--not just the answer, but the delivery. “You--I really thought you just wouldn’t answer.” There’s an uncomfortable feeling in his gut.
“Perhaps we should refrain from asking the good Captain further questions until the spell has faded,” Thor suggests, as though anyone believes Tony doesn’t know what he’s doing.
“What if I need you to perform ‘The Star-Spangled Man with a Plan’?” Tony’s eyes sparkle through remnants of tears, a playful smile on his face.
“Why do you do this? Why are you willing to kill for them?” She looks calm yet angry, like some of his handlers before they hit him, but he knows she can’t touch him.
Steve felt something tickle the back of his throat. He tried to clear it, then coughed, covering his mouth with his left hand.
The man seemed an exceptionally strong swimmer, treading water easily after apparently swimming some distance. He didn’t appear out of breath, but looked a little frantic, dark wet hair plastered to his forehead, expressive eyes scanning the surface until he spotted them.
“If you’re seriously offering, then yeah, I'll take it. Probably should take any job I can get at this point, but... this seems like a nice enough place to work, with a nice enough boss.” Tony hoped he wasn’t imagining the appreciative look Bucky gave him at that. “So, when do I start?”
Steve squeezes his eyes shut. Shock had momentarily eclipsed his humiliation, but now it’s back a hundredfold. “...the guy who met his soulmate while throwing up on him? Yep, that’s me, apparently.”
Steve nods, relieved Bruce chose something he’s mentioned particularly enjoying. “That sounds good, thank you.”
So the armor was sparkling clean like he’d been through a car wash (though the one time he’d actually tried that it had gone... poorly) when he landed on the tower platform and walked through the removal mechanisms. The t-shirt and jeans he’d been wearing underneath weren’t exactly clean, but they only had one day’s worth of sweat and grease from the workshop, so they weren’t the worst they’d ever been, either.
“I know, and that’s not the point!” Tony shouted. “You act like your healing factor means the injury, the
Other times, he thinks about the nonchalant way the others have adapted group meals to make sure Steve has something he likes, not just tolerates. He thinks about how Tony modified the Mario Kart game to give Steve an actual challenge, and even built out the off-road areas to let him explore. He thinks about the photos and other mementos from the Howling Commandos that Tony dug up to give him a more physical connection to his past.
Well, honestly, a tiny part of him expected Tony’s whole “My lawyers have gotten the Accords shelved and full amnesty for all of you, even Robo-Barnes” pronouncement to be a trap. And really, most of him expected the awkwardness as Tony welcomed the wayward Avengers back into the compound. The fidgeting, the quick, joyless smiles Tony gave Sam, Wanda, Clint, and Scott weren’t surprising, nor the wince as his eyes slid past Bucky.
Steve was overcome with emotion--relief, guilt, but above all, love. “I’ll do my best,” he promised, then pulled Tony in for another kiss.
Steve looked around the cave. It was a more furnished than he’d expected a dragon’s lair to be, a large cushion near a metal table, another few cushions of varying sizes in the corners, a wall hanging depicting a blue and gold dragon soaring through the sky, various metal odds and ends sitting around. No pile of gold and gems, as dragons were supposed to hoard, but Steve supposed one might be in a nearby cavern. There was a clanging sound coming from somewhere, but the cavern was too large and echoing to determine which direction the sound was coming from.
“Yeah, sorry I didn’t mention that sooner.” Tony’s mouth quirks in a self-deprecating smile. “So, uh, I suppose you want me to head out?”
kill you, so I’m doing my damnedest to minimize the chances of that.” He turned away, fingers pulling up a few figures on a holographic display. “Hydraulics will help you use the shield despite decreased muscle mass, and I’ve added electromagnets to make catching it easier--I expect your reaction time won’t be what you’re used to. The HUD will account for your diminished eyesight and color blindness. Most suits already monitor vitals, but this one will also be able to administer things like a bronchodilator if it detects breathing issues...”
She shrugged. “Fine. I’ll go a few more rounds with you.” She resumed a fighting stance. “But I’m warning you, Cap, I will
He mentally added humiliation to the list of things he’d learned about in the 21st century that get him off as he thought back to Tony’s degrading comments from the dream. Late at night in the confines of his own room, he could let himself indulge in the fantasy. Tony in the dream had been right, he’d happily bare himself for him and let Tony fuck him. His hand sped up on his cock as he imagined how Tony’s voice would sound as he told Steve what he was going to do to him.
Steve nudged him with his elbow. “See? Take it from me. People here are happily turn in stuff like this to the authorities.”
It turned out that the man wasn’t Japanese after all. In fact, he looked like he might even be an American.
Tony had covered him up with a blanket to keep him warm and preserve what little modesty the man had left.
One hand on the railing, Steve leans forward and moves his other hand down to Tony’s stomach and—oh, oh God. There’s an unmistakable curve to his belly, the skin taut and tender. Steve always comes a lot, even for an alpha, but this much is a hell of a lot more than usual. Like his body can’t get enough of Tony and has to keep going, keep filling his omega—claiming him. As Steve’s hand moves over the warm, distended area, he’s overcome with a wave of possessiveness. He leans forward over Tony’s back, bringing his hand down to embrace him.
As he heads for the elevators, he tries to ignore the voice of doubt in the back of his mind, but he can’t. Maybe this is their way of letting him down nicely? Maybe they’ve picked another candidate already? Heck, maybe they decided they didn’t need the position after all and canceled it. He’s heard of companies doing that before. It’s a dick move, but definitely possible.
It just isn’t fair, Tony thinks to himself as Steve’s words tip him over the edge and he comes with a cry in Steve’s hand. Usually he lasts longer than this. Honestly, though, he has no chance against Steve pulling out the dirty talk at the last second. The situation would usually annoy him, but he’s too busy being completely blissed out against Steve’s nice, warm chest. And anyway, it’s better to keep his attention on listening to Steve breathing hard in his ear as he keeps rutting against Tony’s abdomen. Tony just goes along with the ride, as Steve gets closer and closer to orgasm. It isn’t long before he finally hits his climax with a soft grunt. Tony closes his eyes and lets himself enjoy the sensation of Steve’s cock pulsing against his sensitive skin. His orgasm keeps going, too. It’s then that Tony realizes that Steve comes
Or maybe… Steve thought back to what he could remember of what happened. Sure, he liked Tony… but could he really assume that Tony felt the same? He would’ve done the same thing Tony did had their situations been reversed and wouldn’t have judged his teammate. But maybe Tony… maybe it was different for him.
Before Tony can say anything else, the man’s hand is on his shoulder. That’s when Tony’s hit with an all too familiar scent: deep and musky with an undercurrent of something unique.
That’s when he hears a knock at the door. He stops for a moment before deciding to ignore it. Bucky’s out with their friends tonight, which makes it more likely to be a solicitor or some overly eager proselytizer.
“Gradual increase in heart rate, but still within what SHIELD records estimate as a safe level for his enhanced physiology. An increase in blood pressure as well. Also within estimated safe levels.”
Tony’s hand on Steve shoulder felt far heavier than it should have. “I’m glad,” he said in a way that Steve had no doubt was sincere. Tony looked relieved, but also… intrigued. “You really
Tony chuckled. “Should’ve known you wouldn’t go for the easy way.” He moved his hand down toward Steve’s soft cock. “Well, for your information, the easy way would just to be have them go back to a more… fluid form and have you push them out that way. The fun way…” His hand passed down below Steve’s balls toward his perineum. “The fun way is to have you push them out just like they went in.” Steve flinched when Tony’s fingers reached the loosened ring of muscle and pushed inward. “You’re still a bit loose down here. I think you could pull it off.”
“Though going from the footage…” Bruce winced. “And don’t worry, I only watched what was absolutely necessary for me to understand the situation—”
The mass of the alien’s body began to shift, moving Steve’s limbs on its own. He allowed himself to be moved, groaning as he felt his legs spread wide. Like this, he was completely exposed. Going by the loose, wet feeling down there, he knew the creature must have prepared him somehow.
The first time Steve comes, he pushes forward hard and groans. Tony can feel Steve’s cock pulse against his inner walls, it’s so intense. He bites down on a moan as Steve’s orgasm keeps going, his cock continuing to fill Tony up deep inside. It’s probably the serum, Tony thinks to himself, as he pushes back a little and stretches out on the musty sheets. The last thing he expected when this day began was to be getting it up the ass from Steve, but after everything that’s happened… he can’t really complain.
“There was an interview that you were expected to participate in, Sir, but I’ve sent instructions to reschedule it.”
It seemed to take forever for the first one to travel back to his entrance as he continued to push, his whole body straining as he focused. He wasn’t sure exactly where it was until he felt a strong jolt from his prostate.
“Feel that?” Tony asked, his tone the same as when he was explaining a new breakthrough in his armor’s tech. “It responds to your body heat and changes shape once it’s deep enough inside of you. Peristalsis takes care of the rest.”
“T-Tony?” For the moment, the creature’s movements had stopped and Steve’s mind cleared somewhat. Tony was here, which he knew was a good thing. But… it was hard to remember
As much as Tony was enjoying this, he could feel the minutes ticking down until he had to go back to his lonely luxury suite. Back to the boring reality that was hanging over him like a shadow. Steve with his blond hair, bright eyes and even brighter smile was like sunshine keeping the shadows away. And if Tony was getting all poetic about things, he knew he was screwed.
The other man lets out what sounds like a giggle. “You’re wrong about that. I just met you today and I can already tell you have a winning personality.” He smiles up at Steve.
Steve shook his head again as he tried to think of what to say to Tony. He really was okay. He just needed to take a breather, was all.
Steve didn’t even realize he had been avoiding Tony’s gaze. His eyes snapped back up to meet Tony’s.
“Oh, huh.” Tony took a sip from his coffee and gazed out the window of their cafe over the busy Tokyo street. He looked back to Steve. “So you teach kids English?”
Even better, he must’ve either dropped his wallet or left it at the shabu shabu place. So much for that. Which left him with his phone that wouldn’t get him a cab back to the hotel.
Steve was about to reply when it hit him—did the whole team actually see them like that? “A married couple? Really?”
Tony resists the urge to whistle, instead just staring in appreciation. Steve’s cock is fairly sizable and stands up impressively to almost reach his navel. There’s already precome beading at the head, and Tony’s flattered to think that’s for him.
Neither of them were interested in shopping, but Tony insisted on heading into an arcade they passed by. It was noisy and full of screens and flashing lights. To his surprise, though, Tony walked past the video game machines toward a different area filled with glass cases.
Christmas really was a couples’ holiday in Japan, Steve thought to himself with amusement as he relaxed into Tony’s kisses. He had a feeling that this would be a very nice Christmas, too.
“Wait,” Bruce said. Steve stopped with his hand on the doorknob. “He hasn’t said anything to you at all?”
Just as the display hits the 27th floor, it goes black. A fraction of a second later, the elevator comes to an abrupt stop, making Steve almost stumble.
Steve eventually grew impatient enough that he just pulled at his underwear until it tore in half. He let out an obscene moan when his cock finally sprang free to bump against his stomach. He grabbed himself in a too tight grip and stroked himself as the creature continued to crawl over him. It didn’t take long for him to come with a loud cry, his cock spurting thick streams of come all over his abdomen, some of it landing on the creature as it crawled across his chest. Everywhere the creature touched left him tingling with pleasure. As he blinked up at the hazy room, he couldn’t help letting out another giggle.
Tony took that moment to reach down to slick up Steve’s cock, his fingers wrapped lightly around Steve’s dick as it moved up and down. “I’m going to take you now, okay?”
As they continued their walk down the large street on the lookout for restaurants, Steve could feel the big, goofy grin stretching across his face.
Steve started approaching it slowly. “I’m not really sure, to be honest. It’s curled up against the wall or something.”
Steve abruptly stands up and nods. “Okay. Sounds like a plan.” He heads for his discarded uniform belt slung over the chair by the fire.
He answered with an enthusiastic moan around Tony’s cock buried in his throat, which seemed to be what pushed Tony over the edge as he finally came down Steve’s throat with a cry.
Sure, Tony maybe—kind of—sort of had a thing for Steve. Who wouldn’t? The man was literally human perfection. Not that that was the reason, necessarily. When Tony was a frustrated teenager figuring out his sexuality? Captain America comics and some select memorabilia from his dad’s collection were enough. Actually meeting the man and realizing that he more than lived up to the legend was another story entirely. Tony had a thing for competence, and Steve had that in spades both on and off the battlefield. That would have been enough, but this back and forth thing they had going ever since he’d moved into the Tower? Natasha kept saying she could cut the sexual tension between them with a knife, and Tony had to grudgingly agree. He liked Steve, at the end of the day. And, well, if glimpses of Steve in the showers after a mission were fuel for some fun time alone, that was Tony’s business and no one else’s.
Tony turned and nearly fell out of his chair when he saw Bruce standing on the other side of a table, as though as he’d appeared out of thin air.
Chuckling, Steve turned his face back toward Tony’s thigh. It wasn’t long before Tony’s fingers against his scalp lulled him back to sleep. His last thought was how lucky he was to have someone as ridiculous, wonderful, and brilliant as Tony Stark in his life.
He was tempted to roll his eyes. Tony could be so controlling when it came to missions. He was about to tell him that he had everything under control when he felt something bump against his leg. He glanced down to find that the creature had crawled all the way over to him. No longer curled up, it was now crawling across the floor on its dozens upon dozens of legs toward him. Smiling to himself, he reached down to pet it.
He gives himself credit for how quickly he grabs Steve and escapes through the cockpit window. Considering the situation, it’s a pretty good maneuver. Everything after that happens so fast that it’s almost a blur. There’s a loud explosion and the quinjet starts to veer downward as one of its engines is taken out. Tony does his best to get clear of everything, but there’s another explosion that must have hit the fuel tank because it’s bigger than the first.
Tony kept a hand on Steve’s stomach, idly rubbing soothing circles into the stretched skin. “Now, then. Are you ready?”
That’s how Steve found himself watching Tony proceed to win prize after prize from the UFO catcher. He went into a long rant about positioning and picking machines where the prizes were set up to actually be reachable. They even changed machines a few times. By the time they were done, Steve was holding onto an alarming number of cute plushes.
Steve moaned as Tony pushed his tongue into his mouth. Before he could think better of it, he ran one hand around Tony’s thigh to pull him up against him. That got him a nice high pitched whine out of Tony’s throat, which only made him want more.
Tony looks down at Bruce’s hand, then across the table. Meeting Bruce’s eyes, he admits, “Yeah, you’re right.”
,” Steve panted as he writhed against his restraints. His cock twitched against the underside of his belly, slick with precome. He’d lost count of how many times he’d gotten off by this point, but it felt like he could keep going forever.
Tony leaned back on his elbows, his earlier frustration seemingly forgotten. “Tell me: what’s your favorite part of getting fucked?”
He kept running things over in his mind again. Was Tony really put off by what he saw? Steve wasn’t one to let embarrassment bother him too much; so this kind of… shame was new to him. He shouldn’t care so much about what Tony thought of him, yet the feeling wouldn’t go away.
Amused, Steve followed him and watched him as he posed with some of the snowmen decorations around the tree and took some selfies. Eventually he gestured to Steve. “Hey, come on! Get in the shot!”
Tony pulled back and pushed himself up to look at Steve, who was smiling as he turned his head toward him. “Damn, Steve. You really
Steve nodded. “Yeah, down in Kyushu, actually. It’s a really small town, but… it’s nice.” He rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. He usually wasn’t this nervous when talking about his job. He
Once he’s finished, Tony’s already sweating. He knows it’s necessary to clean the wound, but it sure as hell isn’t pleasant.
Steve hummed in assent, and Tony assumed that he was going to sleep. A minute later, though, he spoke up.
Pulling back, Tony returned his smile. “You’re pretty far gone, huh?” Steve shuddered when Tony stroked the side of his face tenderly. “You okay?”
There was a loud clang behind Steve and the next thing he knew, the handle was in his hands as well as the rest of the cable with it. He blinked a few times and turned around to see that he’d pulled the weights straight through the top of the machine with enough force to get them tangled in the top part of the structure.
He let his head fall back against the mattress and groaned. The details of the dream were still fresh in his mind, and the rest of his body was on board with it. He slowly reached down to palm his dick through his now sticky boxers and sighed. It usually took him more than one orgasm to be completely satisfied, anyway.
He hastily cleaned up and tucked himself back into his pants. This had gone on long enough. Full seal or no, he was going in there.
Steve stands up. He hesitates for a moment before giving Tony what he hopes is a sultry smile and asks, “How about you join me?”
Steve’s knees hit the mattress, and then suddenly he’s so close. Tony watches Steve’s gaze move across his body. In this position, Steve towers over him and it makes Tony shudder in excitement.
Panting heavily, he could only lie still and groan softly as the object continued to travel further inside him.
Somehow, Steve had almost forgotten in light of everything else going on. He did as he was told and leaned back on his elbows to give Tony access to his ass. He could only imagine what he looked like right now, with the end of the plug visible between his ass cheeks. Just the thought made his ears feel like they were on fire.
Tony starts to relax again and actually pays attention to his phone instead of the blond hottie on the other side of the car. That is, of course, when the whole elevator jerks to a sudden stop and the lights go out.
Whomever he was, he must’ve had money, Steve surmised as he started to scoot back toward the capsule he’d reserved for the night. The suit he’d been using to drag the guy around looked like it was tailored and probably worth more than Steve made in two months at the very least. The shoes looked just as fancy and were shined to perfection except for some scuffs probably incurred while walking around the city.
Steve couldn’t help laughing. He motioned for Tony to follow him as he went for the trash area. “Are you kidding? This is Japan. If someone found it, chances are good that they reported it.” He couldn’t help a grin at how Tony still looked skeptical.
A year ago he’d scrounged enough money to travel home for the holidays. This year, though, he wasn’t so lucky. Bucky was doing better but insisted that he shouldn’t spend so much just to hang out with him, and it wasn’t like he had any other family to stay with. That left him alone in Japan for the end of the year.
Steve felt something like a jolt in his ass as the hose or whatever the hell it was went taut. He wasn’t sure what to expect until he felt something slightly warm and wet enter him. He couldn’t help tensing up at the unfamiliar sensation.
That got Steve thinking. He glanced around the café, noticing the cutesy Christmas decorations spanning across the walls. The people working the counters were even wearing Santa hats with their uniforms. It was a weird feeling, seeing Christmas celebrated like this. Way different from how it was back home.
Tony stretched against the high thread count sheets of his bed while stifling a yawn. He felt good even as his muscles protested his movement. It was the feeling of having had a good round of sex, and as he’d just learned, sex with Steve was very,
Before he even realized it, Tony was approaching Steve. His hand flew down to his belt, but then he hesitated.
It seemed that Tony noticed as his eyes trailed down. “Already getting into it, huh?” His expression turned devious. “You really are a needy little cock slut, aren’t you?”
A minute later, as he was coming down from the high of his orgasm, he felt the other end of the creature reach his ass. He rocked back, bringing his hips upward, to give it space to move further down. Something cool hit his skin as the creature’s legs crawled across his ass. Whatever that stuff was, it was easing the creature’s way across his heated skin as it went lower.
As an omega in a high, very public position, control has always been the key element in Tony’s life. Sure, there was a period in his twenties to mid thirties when he’d thrown that idea to the wind and done whatever the hell he’d wanted. Even then, though, he’d played the game of manipulating what the media saw and said about him. He had to control everything: his scent, sex drive, and most of all… his heats.
“You feel so goddamn good like this,” Tony said as he started to move a bit faster. “So full for me. Fuck, Steve, you’re so good to me.” He followed up with a particularly hard thrust against Steve’s abdomen.
Bruce gives him a lopsided smile. “Not a soulmate. Though you could look at it that way if it makes you feel better.”
“What?” Bucky shrugs. “You said he was fine with it. I don’t see the problem. Is it kind of random? Yeah. But I mean, shit like that happens. You hear it on the news sometimes.”
“T-Tony…” Steve said, his cheeks burning. Apparently feeling exposed like this did things for him because he could feel his cock harden further, too. More precome leaked down his shaft. He couldn’t help shivering.
“Will do, buddy.” Tony did his best to smile in what he hoped was at least a partially convincing manner. “And I’ll get back to you on that polymer ASAP!”
Steve doesn’t look impressed as he stands back. That’s when Tony realizes more time went by than he thought because Steve is down to his undershirt and boxers. Tony can see his uniform drying on a chair that’s been placed by the fire burning away in the hearth.
Bruce nods. “It’s very similar to what the studies I’ve read described. Accelerated heats, alphas going into rut in a shockingly short amount of time…”
Tony attempts to shrug, hisses at the pain, and decides that’s a bad idea. “Guess we’re even, then.”
“Good,” Tony said with a nod before settling back on his knees. He produced some lube seemingly out of nowhere and squirted some out onto one hand. It wasn’t long before he was reaching behind himself, letting out a gasp soon after. Turning his attention back to Steve, he said, “Won’t be too long, now.”
Tony continued. “Look, Cap, save the apology. It’s my fault for not having a suit prepared for that kind of situation.”
“There we go,” Tony said in a soothing tone. “Just like that.” He ran a hand along Steve’s thigh almost as though he was rewarding him. “You’re being so good for me, Steve.” He glanced up from what he was doing to meet Steve’s eyes. “You’re always perfect for me, aren’t you?” He added with a chuckle.
Swearing under his breath, he hopped up off of the padded bench and did his best to undo any of the damage. Unfortunately, even once he’d removed the weights and set them back on the stack, the top part of the machine’s frame was bent horribly out of shape. Steve sighed. There went another piece of gym equipment.
Steve took a drink from his water bottle and glanced down at Natasha next to him with a lopsided smile. “I hope so.”
“And our fault for storing an unknown alien creature without more precautions.” Tony stopped his pacing to pinch the bridge of his nose again. “Looking back, I’m not even sure why the hell we bothered—”
“You got us out of the jet, remember?” Steve’s hands are gentle as he applies the adhesive bandages.
“Oh God, what is that—” He flinched as the strange sensation quickly became a strong pressure. It seemed to increase rapidly every second until it felt like even Steve’s stretched hole wouldn’t be able to accommodate whatever this was.
After his third stop to find an alleyway to empty his stomach in, he’d stopped to take a break against the side of a building. Once his stomach had settled down a bit, he finally caught sight of the bright blue sign above him on the building.
“Of course not,” Tony assured him. “These have already proven safe in clinical trials. I’m just tweaking them a bit for this.”
He wasn’t sure how Tony was going to react. Accept his apology? Ignore his apology and barrel on? What he didn’t expect was for Tony to throw his hands in the air and start pacing in a circle.
Steve took it gratefully and let her help him up. He apologized as he ran a hand through his hair in frustration. He’d been feeling off all day and had been hoping that sparring would take his mind off of things again.
Steve couldn’t help shutting his eyes again as he felt his face heat up. Even now, as the alien was caressing his cock with its soft body and legs, he still craved more. Tony was right, he really couldn’t get enough.
He needs a cold shower. That, and a nice night with some of his favorites from his sex toy collection. As he’s thinking over which vibrator he’ll start with, the elevator starts slowing down. Glancing up at the number, he resists the urge to sigh. Fucking floor 52—he’s not even halfway to the garage.
Natasha was heading off of the mat. “Like I said, we’ve decided this situation needed an intervention.” She turned to him, her red hair swaying over her shoulders. “No hard feelings, Steve. Tony will be here any second to let you out.”
He groans when one of Steve’s hands moves down to the swell of his stomach. Feeling Steve’s hands over the stretched skin is deeply satisfying. Eventually, Tony brings one of his hands up to place over Steve’s. Steve hums into Tony’s neck. He sounds as content as Tony feels. He’s not sure how long they spend like that. Steve’s knot is still going strong and Tony’s tired cock throbs pleasantly from where it sits against the jut of his round belly.
Steve pushed his head up into Tony’s hand. “Mmhmm.” He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so completely drained like this. It was almost like he was still floating, though he was far more grounded now than he had been back in the workshop. He let out another groan from deep in his throat when Tony’s fingers pushed back through his hair. Usually even this much stimulation was enough to get him aroused. Now, instead of all of that sensation going right to his cock, there was just a nice, pleasant heat simmering under his skin.
“Sounds good,” Tony mumbles as he starts to drift off. They still have a lot to talk about. For one, how the hell they’re going to get out of this blizzard. Tony also wonders what they are to each other, now. And, well, Steve’s bizarre way of saving his teammate’s lives requires thorough investigation. For now, though, Tony is content to slip into a restful sleep, warm and safe in the arms of a man he trusts. A man he loves.
Tony glances up from his phone to see blondie staring at him from the other side of the elevator. Even in the dim emergency lights the man’s blue eyes are striking. Tony feels like he could get lost in them; maybe over a romantic dinner before riding the guy like a V8 engine.
; more full than he’d ever imagined he could feel. It was everything he’d hoped for and more because it was Tony, and Tony always took such good care of him. After all, the nanites were Tony’s technology; so just like the suit, they were an extension of him. The fact that he was carrying them inside of himself like this made him feel hot all over. He was definitely aroused, but not in the way he was used to. It wasn’t all centered in his abdomen and his dick, for once. Instead, his entire body buzzed with a pleasant lassitude.
Bruce nodded. “Like I said, it’ll take a day to run the rest of my tests. As far as I can tell, though, you’re fine. There haven’t been any lasting effects.”
Tony’s expression only turned more troubled. “Steve, even if it wasn’t hostile…” And then, much to Steve’s horror, Tony’s gaze drifted lower.
Tony seemed to notice his uncertainty. He shook his head. “In this case, we won’t be using them for testing purposes, really. More for…” He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “Well, more for the purpose of pleasure.”
Natasha did a feint to Steve’s right, which he caught, but then she twisted under him when he went left. Next thing he knew, Natasha was under him and Steve instantly knew he was in trouble. Within the next few seconds, he ended up flat on his back. Natasha took the opportunity to get on top of him, straddling his thighs. She was smirking at him, again.
When he’d started sleeping with Tony… well, Tony always insisted on making sure his partners were satisfied.
Tony shrugged as he put 500 yen into the machine’s slot. “Kind of. But they’re not that bad if you know what you’re doing.”
Keeping his eyes closed let him focus on everything else: he was warm and dry, which meant that Tony must’ve cleaned him up afterward. He smiled to himself at the thought.
Sparring with Natasha really did end up taking his mind off of things. She was always an amazing sparring partner and could keep him on his toes more than anyone else on the team, except Thor.
Steve tried to imagine what would have happened if he hadn’t been there. Knowing Tony, he might have tried to go in by himself without the armor if he felt there was no better option. And if he had, well… Steve didn’t know the details, but he knew at the very least that Tony’s heart wasn’t the healthiest.
Steve turned back around to see Natasha strolling into the gym like she’d just arrived, though he doubted that was the case. She was wearing a gym tank top and yoga pants with an expensive looking pair of running shoes.
And there Steve goes again with that tenderness in his eyes. Those blue, blue eyes focused on Tony like he’s actually something worth protecting.
.” When he meets Steve’s eyes, again, he’s smirking in a way that reminds Tony how Steve can be devious when he needs to.
Bucky leans across the table with a grin. “Oh yeah? I’ve known you forever, man.” He grins. “Don’t think I missed how hot and bothered you got when you were telling me what happened.”
Tony shrugged. That was the last thing he wanted to talk about. “Yeah, this is a business trip. Trying to make some deals with some Japanese electronics manufacturers and all that. Pretty boring, to be honest.”
Steve moaned at the praise and strained against his restraints. He could feel his cock twitch against his sensitive skin.
“That’s fine as long as I bring the rest of the team in on this. That way we all can be prepared next time.”
...Steve awoke with a start, shooting up in bed only to get tangled in his sheets and nearly roll off the edge. It took him a second to get his bearings, by which point he noticed three things: he’d had such an intense dream he’d been thrashing around in bed, he was sweating profusely, and he’d just come in his boxers.
A faint rustling noise in the corner of the room caught his attention. It seemed to be coming from the other side of a large cabinet. Steve quickly approached the other side of it, shield up.
“The pheromones that that creature secreted were incredibly strong. From what I can tell, it would have completely overwhelmed any baseline human being. Looking at their chemical makeup, they would have likely increased a person’s heart rate well past safe levels.”
She ran a hand over her chin as she considered his words. “If you can even find him. He’s gone full hermit lately, it seems. I think the only living, breathing human that’s seen him in the last three days is Bruce.”
He was so damned sensitive that it was almost impossible to ignore. As much as he wanted to be good and wait to let Tony take care of him, he’d already gotten himself off twice. Once in the shower because even a lukewarm shower wasn’t enough to discourage his dick.
Bruce sits down at the stool on the other side and reaches for his bottle of water. “Honestly? Pretty low. But not impossible.”
Tony’s hands clenched on the console as he hung his head. His eyes were closed tight as he tried to not think about what was going on right in front him on the screen. Unfortunately, the audio was still loud and clear, and he could hear Steve’s moans of pleasure as he gave into the alien creature.
He’s halfway through his glass of water when he hears the knock again; this time far more insistent. Annoyed, he sets the glass down and heads for the door. He undoes the locks and opens the door, getting ready to chase off whichever idiot has decided to stop by his door on a Friday night.
“Oh that? Didn’t I tell you it was fine?”, Steve said as he took the money. But instead of accepting it he returned it by putting it inside one of Tony’s front pocket. Eh?
“Oh…great. It seems like we all knew Tony already then”, Steve let out a nervous smile. So he just introduced Tony’s friend, Bruce to the others.
“It doesn’t matter. Just break the spell before I break you”, he said, hands clenching tightly on both sides.
“Tony?”, he called out, earning the attention of the said genius. Tony looked over at Steve who came by to sit besides him. Tony didn’t say anything, simply stared at him.
“I thought you hit me with a book but….Did you hit me with your fist just now?”, the brunette asked in astonishment. Pepper just continues staring at him coolly. “You did, didn’t you? Wow, how scary”, he admitted smiling nervously.
Just as he was occupied in his thought Tony came out from the bathroom wearing a clean shirt and wiping his wet hair with a towel. “Man, that was refreshing”.
Tony was shouting over at him from his seat to get in the game and score some or he was gonna regret it later. The guy sure was determined to win the game. Seeing him like that Steve resolved to play a better game in the next half. He didn’t want to let him down for some reason.
During the day if Steve happened to see him in Brooklyn for one of his secret info dealing jobs or something Stark would usually taunt him into a fight and then run away from him and his bullets or if he was currently in his job, he’d pointedly ignore him. So seeing him act like this was rare. And weird.
Steve then opened the door for Tony to get in. Joining him soon after. Steve gave Jarvis Tony’s address and they rode out.
“Just your shirt…And what are you doing clenching my sock?”, Tony asked as he pointed at it with a blank expression.
I might be busy watching Young Justice so I posted this chappie in advance lol. Btw I can't stand superboy being canon couple with Miss Martian (- . -) I ship him with Robin otherwise no one at all.
“It’s her own fault for assuming. They’re always the one who confessed to me to begin with. But they get all disappointed when I’m not what they expect me to be”, he said as he twirl his pen again to avoid the idleness of his body. His hands were itching to work on a new idea that just popped up but he couldn’t until class was over.
“Good morning, DUM-E”, Tony greeted his bot as he was packing up to make his way to his new school. DUM-E whirl happily in response making him smile. He mom sent him off with a kiss on the cheek and he boarded the bus.
That ticked him off. Isn’t he the one who has one? Some girl probably confessed to him by now. “No but aren’t you the one who got something on right now?”
But then he got to know him. The real Tony Stark, who underneath all his outside bravado gets hurt easily. His true self, hidden under a number of layers which takes ages to get through but Steve did it. Got to see Tony for who he is, learned more about him. And as he did, spent time with him, talked to him, fought along side him, he also fell in love.
Steve showed a knowing smile, “Just wanted to make sure our new genius don’t climb anymore gates soon”
He had already told his other best friend, Bucky about his attempt at trying to confess to her today. It seemed like Bucky was happy for him too. Even wishing him good luck and teasing him about how he already knew he liked the girl. That it was plain obvious, making the blonde blush red.
Anyway, those girls don’t know anything about me except my looks. But it’s human nature to judge by appearance. It’s not just guys who are superficial. No one bothers about things they cannot see. Like the heart.
Steve was working on a sketch he had started a few days ago, sitting by the window of Bucky’s living room.
That put a smile on the blonde’s face. Giving a grateful smile in Tony’s direction before running back into the game. Though his senior didn’t notice it as he was still busy scolding the guys and even attempting to give them a few punches. Too bad they ran off to the fields before he could.
Steve then checked up on the rest of the gang. He found that no one suffered any serious injuries. That was a relief. Telling them to get themselves patched up Steve got onto one of SHIELD’s bike and droved off to see his lover.
That’s weird. I mean does he…? Was he just joking around that time? Steve thought as Tony closed his eyes like he was deep in thought, crossing his arms in front.
“No, I won’t. I don’t really mind leaving, sir. If you don’t allow me to wear it like this I’m coming to school stark naked”, he said staring pointedly at him.
Tony was laughing so much while Steve profusely apologized as he gave the shoes to be packed by the shopkeeper. He gazed over to Tony who was still trying hard to clam himself down, failing miserably. He felt a bit angry at the prank but…
“You just knocked over the centerpiece, the Renaissance vase that the school was gonna auction for the upcoming charity event”, Clint said bending over to Tony, trying to hide but his devilish grin was all too apparent.
“Didn’t you know? Steve Rogers is the president of the Student Union at SHIELD. He’s the school leader. He’s a very capable person with good leadership quality. He’s a popular character at SHIELD. Everyone knows him”, Bruce explained.
“Shut the fuck up, you fools. If you want to be just as good work harder. Complaining ain’t gonna make you get better, you jealous pricks!”
“Eh? You do?”. Steve was surprised to hear that. He thought only Tony knew him from the club, oh and Thor. When did he got to know the others?
“No, I had some work I needed to finish today and I’m glad I didn’t” came the blonde’s sincere reply. After searching for a good fifteen minutes Steve felt something and grabbed it. He turned around and showed it to Tony. “Could this be yours?”
Picking up the one of the broken piece Bucky asked Steve what they shall do. Steve looked over at Tony who seemed like he was almost in tears. His heart clenched a little at the sight. For some reason he didn’t like seeing Tony feeling so hopeless.
Steve had been awake all along and was feeling quite annoyed at Stark’s antics. He deliberated on what the damn bastard was doing coming at his place in the middle of the night and just getting into bed with him like it was a normal thing to do. How the hell did he find it anyway? But then again, the guy could get any info he wanted so he guessed it was easy.
Steve was about to talk to Tony again when his phone rang. Picking it up he let out a few ‘yes’ and put it away in his pocket. “Seems like I’m needed in the club room. Have a good day”, saying that he ran off in a hurry. Gazing at the retreating back of Steve Tony suddenly shouted startling his friend.
“I’ll give compliments to the chefs then. Glad you’re having fun though. Tell me if you have any problem. I’ll try my best to help out”, Steve offered.
“I’m sorry”, Steve says, looking kind of down at the comment. Tony couldn’t take the sad puppy eyes he was being shown. Made him feel…kinda like he was bullying Steve. Argh! I bet that’s why girls forgive him so easily.
“Heh, as if I’d tell them the truth. Of course it’s not true so stop looking at me like that and get back to work” , Tony simply replied. But Steve felt like that wasn’t quite true.
Built in a famous plot in the uptown district. It was originally an elite school for well bred young women until it became co-ed a few years ago. Ever since then it began taking in boys as well. But the ratio of boys to girls remains low with an overwhelming number of female students. The reason for this would probably be on the fact that the middle school sector is still an all-girls institution.
“You don’t need to bother with me. Seriously, I’m doing great. Already ditching classes on the first day thanks to your friend”
“But Steve…. I won’t have any memories of you. I’ll forget everything. The feel of your lips on mine, your touch, the warmth of your body…..That I love you with all my heart”
Tony followed Bruce to the cafeteria, feeling a light rumble in his stomach. “Damn, you call this a cafeteria?”, he asked amazed, gaping at the huge dining hall. It was set up just like how a high class restaurant would be and they were free buffet at one corner.
“Tony, was what you told the girls really true?”, Steve asked after Tony had escorted his guest out the door.
“Well, yeah.  I think you’re the first person I’ve dated who isn’t afraid of them or weirded out by them.”
The first day of his visit to Pepper’s had been uneventful.  Considering that she was the CEO of a company, Peter’s mom was usually so busy that she hardly noticed Peter.
“Peter,” Ned said, testing the sound.  “I like it; it suits you.”  Ned’s focus fell back to his lunch tray before he realized that Peter still hadn’t sat down.  “What’s the matter, dude?  Now you get to tell your dads and they throw you a big coming out party or whatever.  I mean, how weird can they be about it?  They’re gay after all.”
“You’re coming out party.  It was supposed to be to introduce you to the business people in SI, but it’ll have to be duel purpose.”  Tony took Steve’s hand as the trio made their way to the elevator.  “We’ll have to look at getting you a suit, my dad got me my first suit when I was your age.”  Tony paused to smile at his son and make sure that he was still comfortable.  As they stepped into the elevator, Tony added, “and we’ll need to talk about binding and stuffing.  Have you read about that online yet?”
“It’s pretty normal for new parents to wonder about their child.  You both got lucky with Peter presenting so early; it’s common for many types to only present once the child is two or three years old.”  The pediatrician spoke with a gentle voice while she weighted and measured Sarah.  “But let’s see if we can’t rule anything out.”  She began a thorough examination of her tiny patient, occasionally muttering to herself.  “Fully human features, unlikely a were-creature."  "No vestigial organs, probably not a shifter, either.”  Moments passed while she looked something up on her phone.
Steve took a pause to check on Peter.  His eyes were drifting shut and all of the remaining tension was dissipating.  Steve smiled, glad he could still help his kid relax, even now.  “Then things started to change, your parents got divorced and your dad and I started dating.  And I was all nerves again.  I never thought I’d have kids.  Hell, I still don’t know how to be a father.  My dad, he would beat the crap out of my ma, and if I ever happened to see, he’d tell me that he was ‘teaching me how to handle a lady’.”  Steve immediately regretted giving this bit of information when Peter seized up against his side.  But he continued, “so, when I knew things were going to get serious with your dad, I read every parenting book I could get my hands on.  Your dad laughed at me for it, but they’ve really helped.  You were such a sweet kid, and I was so scared I was gonna mess you up.  I mean, it couldn’t have been easy growing up with Iron Man for a dad and Captain America as your step-dad.”  Peter started to gently snore against Steve’s shoulder.  Steve was glad that he’d finally gotten Peter to sleep, the dark circles around his eyes were worrying.
They were sitting across from each other at Pepper’s favorite Italian restaurant, and Peter thought it was the perfect time to tell his mom.  “Well, um… actually, it’s been going ok.  I’m… ugh, trans, and I’d prefer if you’d call me Peter.”  Immediately after the words were out, Peter wondered how he managed to be more awkward this time than when he’d come out to Steve.
When Steve didn’t start talking immediately, Peter began to fidget, and continued, “like I’m a boy… not a girl.”
“Of course, we’ll love her no matter what.  But Steve’s been a little nervous that we might not be meeting her needs, since we don’t really know what they are.”
“What do you mean you want me to call you Peter?  Your name is Maria, after Tony’s mother.”  Pepper’s tone wasn’t angry or confused so much as dismissive.  Peter had not anticipated this kind of response.
“Yes if they’re strong enough.  But I’ve never been particularly strong, so you’d turn to stone for 15 minutes or so.  Long enough for me to flee danger, but not long enough to kill.  Do werewolves have any enemies?”
“Well, we have big news to celebrate.”  Tony said squirming under the weight of his teenager.  “Let’s go to that Thai place you like and talk about your party.”
Peter looked at Ned with clear distress in his eyes.  Ned hated to think of it, but it reminded him of those months ago when Peter first came out to him, teary eyed and certain that Ned would hate him.  “Well, for one thing, your dads would never do that.  And even if they did, you’d stay with me.  But,” Ned continued seeing the argument on Peter’s face, “you can tell your dads first, and if they do kick you out, which they won’t, you can just move in with your mom.  There, problem solved.”
“Hey, Morgan,” Steve called from the stove.  “Do you want pancakes?  Or did Aunt May take you to that place you like?”  Steve, seeing Peter’s confusion, wanted to help but didn’t want to interfere if Peter had a plan.
“No, you don’t have ‘dad’s’, Maria, you only have one dad.  Steve isn’t your dad, he’s your dad’s whore.”
“Well, you know,” Peter began, while dumping the contents of his sock drawer on the bed and looking through it.  “I’m only there for a weekend, and I don’t want to rush anything, you know?”
As Tony turned to leave, Steve clutched Peter tighter and called “Wait, you can’t leave us like this.  I don’t know how to take care of a spider.”
“Listen, Maria, I know that it’s hard for you growing up with Tony and Steve.  You’re just confused.  And I should have spent more time with you when you were little.  It’s not your fault – you didn’t have a normal childhood.  It’s not normal to grow up with parents who are
The smiles Tony received from both Steve and Peter told him that he had said the right thing.  The room’s tension finally drained, and Peter began to look more like the relaxed kid Tony knew.
“No, I can’t control it, which is why I don’t take these off, unless my eyes are closed.” Tony indicated the sunglasses that he always wore.  “They do make a nice accessory, though.  So, Bucky’s a vampire who’s social.  Who else was in your pack?”
“That’s it?”  Tony let out at long breath.  “With the way the cops were acting, I thought someone died.”
“So, I used a new spell that Wanda taught me, but it was stronger than I expected and sent him flying across the room.”  Sarah spoke quickly.  “I know that in theory how strongly you feel about something impacts the strength of your spells, but I didn’t realize what would happen in this context.”
"Wait, Sarah.  If you were there with your friends, why were you the only one who got picked up?"  Tony called
With that, the two packed up their picnic and delicately made their way back through the mess to leave the workshop.  From the doorway, Tony called, “Jarvis, make sure to save everything for tomorrow.”
It started when Peter was crying in his crib in the middle of the night.  Steve and Tony had it down to a science at this point. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday Steve handled Peter’s midnight wake ups, so Tony could work in the workshop and be ready for anything that came up with SI.  For the remaining days, Steve got to sleep, while Tony cared for their child.  It so happened that one Wednesday night, Steve trudged over to Peter’s nursery planning on changing his diaper and giving him a bottle as quickly as possible.  Just as Steve bent to pick Peter up from his crib, something strange happened.  Peter’s body spouted dark black hairs while his shape began to contort.  It took Steve a surprisingly long time to understand what was happening.  Long enough for Jarvis to wake Tony and send him to Peter’s room as well.
“Yeah, we went to the breakfast place, and then we got muffins, and then Aunt May got coffee.”  Morgan began her new story with enthusiasm as she walked over to Steve to see what kind of pancakes he was making.  “But she said, I couldn’t have coffee on account of I’m not big enough, so I had hot chocolate.”  By the time she finished, Morgan was standing at Steve’s side peering into the pan.  “Do they have chocolate chips in them, Papa?”
“I remember what it was like to be fifteen and think that other people only wanted to hangout because I could shift.  I just don’t want that to happen to Peter.”  Burrowing deeper into his husband.
“I haven’t told him yet.  I was going to let fate decide who I told first.”  Peter’s whole body had relaxed with Steve’s comfort.
Morgan, always full of surprises, simply responded with, “I’ve always wanted a brother.  My friend Jackie’s brother taught her how to fish.  Can you teach me how to fish?”
“No fishing until after breakfast,” Steve said, as he placed two plates of pancakes on the breakfast bar. “And eat your breakfast before it gets cold.”
Eventually, Tony came up from his workshop for coffee and breakfast.  Sitting at the breakfast bar with his sister with his dads close by, Peter felt relieved to have told his family.
“No, Bucky’s a vampire, and he’s been my pack since we were kids.  Mostly, vampires like to be alone or just with their mate and wolves like to have huge packs, so we don’t mesh very well.  But some vampires can be social.  Do you have control over the stone glare thing?  Or does it happen regardless?”
With that line, Peter knew the conversation was over.  He’d heard it many times before and it never hurt any less. As tears gathered in his eye, Peter was glad to see their food coming.
Peter saw his chance to tell Morgan and took it.  He got off of the bar stool and knelt in front of his sister so they were eye-level.  “Well, Morgan, I’m Peter.  You know how some people are men and some people are women?”  At Morgan’s nod, Peter continued, “well, I don’t feel like a girl.  I’m your brother, and I’d prefer to be called Peter.”  As Peter finished, he worried that his sister didn’t understand.
Tony’s observation proved correct.  With the guidance of Wanda, Sarah grew up to be a talented witch.  Which is how Steve and Tony ended up picking up their 16-year-old daughter from the police station at two in the morning.
“We’re figuring it out.  Besides, she was standing up for her friend, so I think she was on the right track.  We do need to have a chat with Wanda, though.”
Meanwhile, baby Sarah seemed to enjoy being the center of attention, giggling to herself while grabbing at the doctor’s name badge.  Suddenly, Sarah sneezed, looking quite startled by herself.
Tony still seemed too stunned to respond, so Steve handled it.  “We have a witch in our pack, Wanda.  I’m sure she’d love to help her niece out.  Is there anything we should know about witch-proofing the house?  How powerful will she be without being able to say any spells?”
“Yeah, except when they wake up in the middle of the night and slither across my face, which I still haven’t gotten used to, in case you’re wondering.”  As Tony spoke, he also began petting his snakes.
“Ok.”  Tony ever impatient.  “Maria, honey, wake up.”  He gently shook Peter’s arm in an attempt to wake him up.
“Why would I be afraid, they’re sweet.”  Steve reached out a hand to gently pet on of the snakes, who affectionately butted against Steve’s hand.  “Is that it?  Are you out of werewolf questions for me?”
The problem hadn’t started until dinner on Saturday.  Peter always knew that his mom wasn’t fond of Tony and Steve’s relationship.  Though he’d never tell his dads, she had made comments about Tony’s “love affair with a man” since the two had started dating.  Despite Steve’s confidence to the contrary, Peter wasn’t sure how his mom would react to the news.
“Imadesomethingforyou,” Tony said in a rush, “And now I’m realizing now that I probably should’ve talked to you instead of just building a solution that might
Tony swallowed, trying to make this new information make sense in his head. “Does that mean... you’ll come home?”
Note for this chapter: I’m not saying “spending time with loved ones is sufficient reason to expose yourself to situations you know are traumatic for you.” In this case, Steve decides his risk and degree of possible traumatic reactions are low enough to be worth the extra time with his family. If this is ever not the case for you, do what you need to do to take care of yourself.
Steve watched in horror as Iron Man swooped around and let the giant monstrosity get closer and closer with its enormous claws, until they reached the bay and Thor’s lightning, sparking through the water, finally downed it.
Tony shrugged. “Your current uniform isn’t going to cut it right now. And I know you, the next Avengers call and it’d kill you to sit on the sidelines. But going out in your normal getup might
, he’s your friend!” She’s shouting the same things the target is saying, but he can’t listen to either of them. He has to complete his mission.
“Oh, well, that makes it okay, then,” Tony retorted, voice dripping with sarcasm. “It happened over an hour ago, just how long is this supposed to last?”
The bickering friends looked back at him. “Of course,” the blond said. “I’m Steve, and this is Bucky.”
mean I’m going to do anything to make you need to safeword.” Tony relaxes at that. “I just want you to use it sometimes when you don’t
The dragon looked... regretful? “There have been a few I’ve had to kill or they’d have killed me. The rest, I manage to scare or nonfatally injure, and they give up and leave.”
Bucky looked over to see DUM-E backing up and swirling his arm around, beeping offendedly. He didn’t look damaged, though there was a small blackened spot on the floor. Snowball was scratching at it, as though expecting to find something underneath.
“Okay, you supersoldiers are supposed to be digging in right now and replacing all your battle energy. Something wrong with the burger?” Tony keeps his voice low, leaving the others to their more boisterous conversation.
“Well, time to work on your strategy, then,” Steve suggested, packing a light ball and throwing it squarely in Nat’s face.
“The subject of kinks I didn’t know you had is a pretty good one, but I guess we can put a pin in it for now.” Tony’s grin fades. “I do like it when you push me, when you make me do more than I think I can, I don’t want to stop that entirely.”
“Ned?” he asked, a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, as his coworkers around him started getting the equipment ready.
Of course, loving Steve wasn’t the same as wanting him. But it was more important. It was enough, right?
Also strange has been Thor’s morning behavior. Each morning for several days, Thor comes into the kitchen looking confused, on the verge of asking a question but then not doing so, even when Tony presses (after two cups of coffee, of course). Eventually the confusion goes away and, instead, Thor starts looking at Steve in a strange new way--admiring, and somehow smug. Tony tries not to feel threatened by a (kind of) god looking at his boyfriend like that.
Through it all, there were moments when Steve was briefly distracted by the cold, by the chill seeping into his bones and gripping his heart.
you, and pain meds don’t do shit for you, so all I can do is try to make sure you’re comfortable, okay?”
Tony sighs, glaring over at the pile of fabric and straps on a table. “It’s distracting; it doesn’t let me move normally.”
He was about to stand back up when he felt a soft weight settle over his shoulders and back. Suddenly, there was protection from the wind, the cold of his soaking jacket not so bad. What...?
Content warnings: Mention of divorce (Tony/Pepper), no cheating but feelings toward someone while in a monogamous relationship with someone else.
“Consider that repair your interview, I’ve been needing an assistant around here.” Pepper had been nagging him about getting one, anyway, insisting that since she kept his books she knew better than he did what he needed and could afford, and one of the things she thought he needed was more time away from the shop. Which he couldn’t do when there was no one else to run the place.
Steve looks back at Tony, who doesn’t give him a chance to chastise him. “What’s a movie we’ve watched that you hope you never have to see again?”
“Sure thing, kiddo,” Steve promised, returning the hug, then allowing Peter to lead him to the fort.
He thinks he’s seen women here before, even well-dressed ones, but there’s something off about her even before she starts screaming.
Unfortunately, that stop is the last straw for his stomach, which immediately hurls its contents (he definitely should not have had that hot dog) up his throat... and onto the chest of the person who grabbed him.
“I’ll do my best.” Tony’s words are light, but his eyes are serious. Then he smiles and pulls Steve in for another kiss.
Then came several traditional bauble ornaments, each carefully hand-painted with the face of someone on the team. That had to have been Steve.
“We only brought home the three, though,” Steve rushed to say, like he worried Tony would protest to having a room full of stuffed toys. (Normal people probably would, wouldn’t they? Pepper hadn’t seemed to appreciate a similar gift from Tony when they had dated, now that he thought about it...) “We gave the rest to kids around the park.”
Across the room, Tony barked out a laugh at something Rhodey had said, his eyes crinkling with genuine pleasure.
He’s trying to pay attention to the mission briefing, to see the documents on the target, but the woman is in his way, blocking his vision, and no one else seems to notice or care.
After they all got their ice cream, they were headed to the outdoor seating area to enjoy the breezy summer afternoon, when suddenly someone pushed by Tony in a rush, shoving his cone up into his face.
“I can’t tell you that,” James answers, preferring to remain mysterious than to try to lie. “I just know she’d want you to have it.”
“I left to help my friend. I wanted to come back to my lover. I didn’t know you thought I loved him. I should have explained better before I left, should never have let it come to this. I’m sorry.”
But then--the reflection’s gaze drifted down. Tony was looking at “his” reflection’s eyes, but those eyes were directed lower--Tony’s lips?
The next day, Bucky’s getting sick of all the food that doesn’t hurt his teeth, and watches with envy as Clint and Thor eat ice cream in front of him and he has to turn down their offer to share.
Still hanging from the line close to the boat, it suddenly stopped flopping. Then one of the small beads--were those pearls?--that functioned as eyes turned to look at them, and a mournful warble emitted from it.
Here, both Steve and Tony turned to give their son a disapproving look, but Peter just shrugged, gesturing at the animals on the table as if to say “What else could I do?”
But all it took was a hug from his son, a punch on the arm from Nat, a terrible joke from Clint, or a kiss on the cheek from Tony, to bring him back to the here and now. To his family, who would always keep him warm.
“Exactly,” Bucky agreed, though the truth was that when he’d signaled he hadn’t been a hundred percent sure she was harmless. And even now, it seemed safer to depart with his armored boyfriend than to walk out alone and assume she had no backup plan. Still, it was more fun to banter flippantly with said boyfriend than to let the woman who’d tried to use him believe she’d accomplished anything. “I’m dating the richest man in New York, gotta travel in style.”
“Legend says Fury trusts you to take care of his cat when he’s away.” (“Partly true.”) (Natasha’s amused smile makes Tony curious what could be only
“Surgery?” Steve asked Natasha, not remembering what the stories--apparently horrifyingly true stories--had to say about that.
“That’s so impressive,” Bucky replied, “Everything you build is so amazing.”  He enjoyed the resulting blush on his boyfriend’s face.
“No, that one’s Steve,” Steve says, pointing to the one still in the cage, now looking up between the two of them. “And Little Steve loves Little Tony.”
“I think vomit is disgusting, I think you’re adorable, why... oh.” Tony’s eyes widen. “Shit. Those are your soulmark words, aren’t they?”
“Of course!” came one man’s reply, while others gave mixed grumbles. “Well, it carries off some of the livestock, and once kidnapped a young lady!”
“Ow,” he said, not sure if he’d activated the comm channel first, but pretty sure he was supposed to have reported more than that. Constructing a complete sentence seemed beyond him at the moment, however.
Tony’s mouth opens and shuts a few times, before finally he smiles. “Legend says I’d be crazy to turn down a date with Steve Rogers.”
It’s been three weeks since the end of the war. Three weeks since Tony knocked Steve out, took the station’s shuttle through the wormhole, and destroyed the passage from the other side, preventing any more Chitauri from making it through to terrorize this end of the galaxy... preventing any chance of his ever returning home.
“Yeah, I am”, he replied looking away, staring out the window. He does not want to continue this particular line of conversation.
“That’s cause stuffs like falling in love….You never know when it’s gonna happen to you”, Tony said with a grin, silencing her. Pepper stared at him contemplating thoughts in her head when…
“So, are you gonna share or do we have to find out ourselves?”, Pepper said poking at Tony’s side. Tony dug into his school bag for the letter, handing it to his friends with a grin plastered on his face. They opened, read it and soon both of them had the same expression as their friend.
“So, we decided to mix it up. This club does host club activities on Monday, Wednesday and Friday while we use Tuesday and Thursday as a normal help club. I rather enjoy it”, Natasha said as she passed their table to get a drink from the bar.
“Tony!”, he called back, running to him and engulfing him into a hug surprising the genius. Tony froze on the spot. Why is Steve hugging him infront of everyone?! It feels really nice but the Pres should seriously let go now. People were whispering and eyeing them suspiciously.
“No, not there… Don’t push in…!”, Tony gasped out as Steve suddenly thrust three of his fingers into his hole. He finally came when one of Steve’s fingers brushed at his prostrate. Wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck, his whole body trembling in pleasure.
“Tony, wait”, Steve said grabbing Tony by the arm. He leaned down to his face, making Tony blush at the action. Wait, what the hell is Steve doing? He thought in a panic. Steve brought his other hand up to brush his fingers near Tony’s lips. “You had a piece of jam near your mouth”, he said showing it to Tony and proceeded to lick it off making Tony blush even harder.
Tony let of a groan and slings his bag pack on his shoulder, “This is one of the reasons I hate these kind of schools. The stupid dress code”
“It’s about time you got conscious of things like that and do something about it”, she continued propping herself on a nearby desk looking down at her best friend.
They found Loki inside a building, a type of bar, being served wine by the women. Loki, on seeing them gestured the girls to leave the room. “My, my, what brings earth’s mightiest heroes to seek my presence?”, the mischief god asked twirling his wine in his glass. It took all of Steve’s effort to not charge at him and beat the crap out of him. Maybe the spell would break along with him.
“There you are, Thor. Why didn’t you come to meet up? The chairman was asking for you,” Steve said jogging towards them, carrying some paperwork. Tony looked in the direction of the sound, realizing it was Steve he quickly dug behind Bruce for cover. He didn’t feel like meeting him again so soon.
“Tony….Even if you forget me, I won’t. Even if you don’t love me anymore, I won’t. I’ll just have to make you fall in love with me all over again. It doesn’t matter how long it’ll take. You’ll find yourself telling me you love me again”
“But it’s really cold now and dark. The bus would take a while to reach and I don’t want you to catch a cold waiting for it in the night”
“I think he knew that someone did that to you on purposed. Barnes maybe scary but he’s nice once you get to know him better”, his friend explained. And Tony felt like he finally understood Barnes a bit. He really isn’t so bad.
Seeing Tony cry his eyes out, Steve felt as if he’s being engulfed by a wave of sadness. He hates it, really hates to see Tony in this state. He wrapped his arms around the brunette as he continued crying on his shoulder. Tears staining his shirt, leaving behind a wet patch. But he didn’t mind, not a bit. He rubbed Tony’s back, thinking it’d help.
WHY did they put a wall in the middle of the hallway?...No wait, this wall is kind of warm. He looked up to see a tall guy with long blonde hair, smiling down at him. “Are you alright, little guy?”, he asked. His voice loud and clear. It’s like he has a loud speaker stuck in his throat. Tony should totally be angry at the address but decide to keep his cool. The guy could easily beat him up with all those bulging muscles of his.
Well, this sure is unfortunate. Hmm, how come, he seems like he’s not how he looks from the outside. “It’s honestly kind of cute”, Steve said to himself as a smile starts to curve on his lips, re-reading the text. He was caught by surprise when his phone rang.
“Cause it’s was the name of a superhero group I liked since my childhood”, Clint said putting an arm around Tony’s shoulder, surprising him.
“New comrades? Would the lot of you want to be shown around the place? It would be my pleasure to do so”, Thor offered with a huge smile. Before Bruce and Tony could decline the offer, they were being shoved along by Thor and his super strength. For guys like Tony and Bruce, they hardly could put up any noticeable resistance. Might as well went along then.
Tony let out a breath he didn’t even know he had held back, sighing in relief. “I thought I was dying for sure. Oh my god….”
They were interrupted by a girl calling over for Steve, telling him that he was wanted by the teachers. Thanking her he followed her back. He took a few steps forward, then looking back at Tony he smiled, “I guess I’ll see you tomorrow then”
Steve was crushed on getting to know the truth. His friends knew it, everything, his feelings. But they had acted like they didn’t and even fake supported him knowing all this. How important it was for him. Peggy was the only girl he had ever like. Who had treated him the same before and after his physical change, from a scrawny kid bullied everyday to the muscular, handsome blonde who caught the eyes of everyone.
“Ah, I’m so hungry~ I don’t think I have enough energy to make it to the canteen. Brucie, be a dear and carry me there”
“But I’m certain though that he’ll still retain the memories of him becoming Ironman. That’s all I can assure you, but no more than that”, he told them.
“Hmm, cute?”, she questioned to which Steve recalled the time he happened to catch Tony working on his machines through the crack in the door of the Engineering club late into the day. Everybody had already gone home. It was just a few football players staying back for a long practice. But seeing the senior who was well known for his pretty yet at the same time handsome face and for being a playboy busy with his invention rather than girls was a rare sight to him.
“Oh, you guys noticed, eh, honey bear?”, was the reply the brunette gave with a sly smirk, sipping on his drink.
“Shut up. Aren’t you the one selfishly wearing my shirt? Take responsibility”, Steve growled at him as he grabbed the front of his shirt Tony was wearing while the smaller male glared at him with an annoyed pout.
No, this can’t be. Tony forgot about him? It’s not true. Someone please tell him this isn’t true. That this is just a sick joke Tony is playing on him and that he’ll say ‘Ha! I got you good, Cap’. But it never came. Tony continued staring at him not knowing what to do. Steve felt tears flowing out his blue eyes and falling on top of his hands. He couldn’t stop it even if he wants to. It kept pouring out, he can’t help it.
Well, from that day something in him changed. It took awhile but he did learn to forgive them and wish them happiness. They were his best friends after all. But it was never the same again.
“Tony, stop laughing. Barnes looks like he wants to kill you”, Bruce warned while Clint urged him on. But Tony couldn’t stop it. Barnes pulled on his collar, yanking him to look up at him.
“Mr. Stark! Did you just sleep during my class?”, the teacher barked at him. Geez, he’s even more pissed today. Why am I always unlucky in his class? Tony thought with an annoyed sigh.
“Thanks for the concern but I already got dumped”, he admitted with a slight curve of a smile on his lips.
Hitting the ‘send’ button he put down his phone and then letting his face hit the pillow. He let out a yawn.
The teacher came in to take the class and just as Bruce had feared Tony got called out for his attire. He got sent to the principal’s office. Sitting in front of the one eyed principal of SHIELD Tony felt an urge to make fun of the eye patch but he didn’t. He was currently in trouble. “Already sent to the office on your second day, huh, Stark?”, Fury said leaning his arm on the desk.
“You’ve been really quite today, Steve”, he told him, “I really hate that, okay? That you are actually unhappy about something but you just keep quite and go along with it”. Tony put down his half eaten Shawarma to stare at the guy, putting a palm on his chin.
Just as he was wondering whether the girl was Steve’s girlfriend of the week their eyes met for a second when the blonde glanced over. Steve then continued his conversation with the woman for a while longer. Waving a quick goodbye to her the woman drove away giving him a smile.
“Heh~ Something happened between the two of you yesterday”, a devilish smirk spread out on his lips sending shivers down their spines.
It was a good thing he guessed. Since most of the girls had already gone home. It was nice to not be surrounded by girls for a change. Felt relaxing.
“Oooo~ A fight between Barnes and the new errand boy? I wanna watch”, Clint chimed in as he and Natasha came into the class, followed by a meek looking Bruce who was smiling nervously as Thor boomed in disagreeing Clint’s claim saying comrades shouldn’t fight each other, putting a strong grip on Bruce’s shoulder.
They soon reached a room with the ‘Vice Principal’ written in the display sign outside the door. “Here we are, the office of our vice, Mr. Coulson. Just introduced yourself and submit your invitation letter and he’ll sort you out with the details, okay?”, Steve said looking at the brunette.
First I want to thank all of you readers for reading my fanfic. A special thanks to those who left kudos and bookmarks. It means a lot since it's my first work in ao3 as well as first time writing BL fanfic.
“That would be great. Thanks. Lead the way then, big guy”, he said trying to keep a cool posture, shifting his gaze away from the blonde.
It was going fine for a while. The two of them simply sharing a bed until it got really weird when Tony licked the back of his neck. Steve shot up from the bed and quickly pinned him down onto the mattress quite roughly.
“Shut up…What are you saying…How the hell can I stop!”. With that he thrust his cock into Tony’s stretched out hole in one swift motion.
“I can’t believe girls fall for such talk”, Tony scoffed as he took a break to sit down with Bruce who had been reading alone at one of the empty table.
“Nope, never heard of it. I am kind of surprised to see that you’re still alive. Thought you were dead”, Tony said glazing over to Natasha polishing her knife and then at Clint.
“Should I stop then?”, he stares down at him. “You also don’t want me to put this in either, right?”, he smirked as he rubbed the tip of his cock to Tony’s ball, brushing pass his hole and making it twitch in anticipation.
Tony laid naked on the bed as Steve started to work him open with his lubed up fingers. Stretching his hole in a quick rhythm.
“Just leave it to me, Steven. I will take care of it. You do not need to worry”, Thor told him as he put a hand on Steve’s shoulder in a reassuring manner and gave a warm smile. Steve thanked him and handed him the paperwork. Thor waved them goodbye and went on his merry way, greeting people loudly as he go.
I didn’t think the seniors knew. Steve thought looking at the brunette who seems like he was deep in thought.
“Um, will it be alright if we ask for you again next time?”, the girls asked in unison sighing happily.
As Tony was getting his much needed sleep the rest of the gang were busy on finding the location of Loki. Natasha and Clint had gone to SHIELD’s headquarters to see if they could get any information. Thor had gone through the portal to talk with Heimdall about his brother while Steve not wanting to leave Tony stayed back with Bruce at the tower to help out wherever he could.
“Instant coffee?”, their guests said in unison looking lost. Like they’ve never seen it before. Wait….they really don’t know about this!
“If you’re gonna be that persistent then I guess I have no other choice but to leave it to you”, he said giving a playful punch at Steve’s chest. Then he nodded to Loki to start the spell. The magician came over and his hands gave off a blue glow, shining it upon Tony’s feature. His friends watching in anticipation.
Tony sat down at his desk, totally out of breath. The shitty bastard, why did he have to go and do that? Couldn’t he just point it out instead? There was no need to get up close and personal to get rid of a jam. Bruce watched Tony as he slumped down onto his desk and grumbled to himself, giving off an angry aura.
Natasha and Clint looked at each other and stepped out of the room. Bruce and Thor followed them out as well and the sorcerer opened a portal to let himself out.
Tony smirked. “Oh, I see. If it’s gonna be like this, I wish I came out while you were doing perverted things with my sock”, he teased. Tony’s eyes widened in surprise as he felt Steve suddenly bring him into a tight hug. Burrowing his face in the crook of his neck.
It wasn’t getting better. Tony seems to keep forgetting stuffs. From small things like forgetting what he was doing at the moment it became worse with him forgetting even people’s name and faces. Even of Steve and the rest of the avenger. It happened during a fight as well. Ironman had abruptly stood still among the chaos of the battle with their enemies, like he forgot what he was doing there. Steve had to tackle him down in an attempt to save him from the on coming danger.
“Wow, Rogers seems to hit the goal every time”, one of his teammates told to his friend as he wiped off the sweat from his face with his shirt.
They continue their chat as they made their way back to class and taking their respective seat near each other. They kept telling Tony how much of a lucky bastard he was and teasing him that he should not forget them just cause he got to study in the big shot school. But their conversation was put to halt when the teacher came in to take the class. They make no attempts to continue their chat as this particular teacher is the strictest person alive. You know, the types that simply punish kids for the heck of it.
“That’s okay. You should get going before your pizza gets cold”, he said handing the box to Tony, “I have to go that way. See you later”, he continued leaving a confused Tony behind.
Speaking of which, something smelled. He wondered where it was coming from. He saw a black sock hanging off at the end of his bed and picked it up. Was it this? Did that shitty Stark left this stinking thing behind?
The trio of friends were currently eating lunch together in their special area on the rooftop. “Alright, what’s got you in such a good mood today, Tones?”, Rhodey started ,eyeing at him as he packed up his now empty lunch box.
“I can’t help it. I feel as if I’m in a dress. It’s too formal and feels suffocating. Had to mix it up a little”, Tony explained.
Making his way out of the detention room with a loud slam of the door he met up with Pepper and Rhodey who were waiting for him at the hallway. “I don’t care about anything. I’m joining that new school first thing in the morning. Damn teacher thinking he can send me to detention just for dozing off a bit”, Tony complained with a huff. “Still managed to get detention even on your last day here,huh?”, Rhodey said with an amused chuckle. “Life’s gonna be so boring now without you around”, Pepper said giving Tony a side glance, a small smile adorning her lips.
He’s gonna pay the debt up even if it’s the last thing he do. He won’t run away. But seeing the slight devil smirk on Barnes kinda made him dread his up coming days.
I think one week is enough for a dream. Steve…he’s perfectly faithful. He remembered Pepper saying that about him.
They finally found an old looking door, it looks abandoned from the outside. Tony gazed back to Bruce who gave him a nod, agreeing to enter the room. They were soon blinded by the colorfulness of the room filled with decorations of bright lights and an amazing set up. It was like a penthouse suite.
“5 MILLION DOLLARS?!” Tony shouted at the top of his lungs. He slumped down, crouching at a corner, totally depressed.
Steve let out a small chuckle as he took out an ID card from his pocket and swiped it across a panel near the gate. The gates finally opened up to let them in. Tony realized that Steve is a student here after he finally pulled himself together to check out the guy. He was wearing the traditional uniform of SHIELD. He followed Steve through the gate and into the building and man was it as grand as it looked from the inside. Like they used an old royal family estate for the academy. Tony stood out like a sore thumb. He was soon met with a number of stares from the people he met along the way. ‘The hell they’re staring at? Haven’t they seen a normal person or what?’. Angry and feeling kind of down he almost felt like dropping the whole thing off and go back home already.
The car ride home was comfortable and quiet, jazz playing softly on the radio.  Peter was safe with Morgan and his dads.
“It’s been a couple months, Steve.  After we went to that party and met Loki.”  Peter’s sniffles tapered off, and he shifted to lean more of his weight on Steve, who was still running fingers through his hair.
"I told them to leave before the cops showed up.  I was the one who cast the spell, so I was the one who should get in trouble."  With that, Sarah headed towards her room.
On the way to the car, Steve noticed that the nervous energy hadn’t faded but decided to leave it be.  Tony was always telling him that the kids would let him know when they wanted help.  “You can always call me, anytime, and I’ll be there.  I promise.”  Steve didn’t know if it was enough to comfort Peter, but he needed to say it just in case.
As Peter woke up, he sat up so his body wasn’t fully leaning on Steve.  “Dad, you might want to sit down.”  Peter began.  “I have big news.”  His voice was steady and sure.  Steve felt confident that their conversation had helped to put Peter at ease.
Steve noticed the flash in Peter’s eyes that meant he was about to bolt. Not wanting to risk him running off, Steve set the pizza on the coffee table before sitting down next to Peter on the couch.  “Oh, Maria, tell me what’s wrong.”  Idly stroking Peter’s hair, Steve waited for him to be ready.
Steve, looking at the fully packed suitcase, realized that this was far worse than usual.  “So, are you planning on telling your mom when you’re there?”  Steve asked directly – they didn’t have time for beating around the bush.
“You didn’t get picked up by the cops for being at a concert.”  Steve passed cups of tea to Tony and Sarah.  “And I know that you know that you should have run that by Dad or I before going.”
Their lives continued much the same as time went on.  Peter found comfort in his spider form, which Steve recognized, as he too found solace in his wolf form.
Peter chittered as he climbed into his dad’s arms and got comfortable.  In the shift Peter’s diaper had slipped off, exposing all eight long thin legs and the black hairs that now covered his body.
The next morning, Steve (and Jarvis) researched spider shifters and what they needed, while Tony tried to convince the now baby shaped Peter to shift back to his spider form.  They learned that Peter could still eat the same food, but that if he stayed shifted for longer than a few hours he should snack on spider food (which Steve dutifully ordered) and that their pediatrician specialized in shifters of all types, so they made an appointment for later that week.
“Well, you know, I’m just, I’m not a girl.  I’m a boy, and I picked Peter as my new name.”  As the apathy on Pepper’s face shifted to thinly vailed shock and anger, Peter thought that he shouldn’t have told his mom after all.
“Because I want answers, munchkin.  This isn’t like you.  Let’s start at the beginning, you were supposed to be at a sleepover with Wanda for witch stuff.”
“I don’t want to push you either way, kiddo, but she’s your mom and she’ll love you no matter what.”  Steve always aimed for diplomatic when talking to Peter about Pepper.
The next day, Peter was sitting at the breakfast bar when Morgan got home from Aunt May’s house.  A jubilant 4-year-old, Morgan raced to Peter to tell him about the adventures she’d had with May.  By the time Peter’s half-asleep brain fully began listening, Morgan was already halfway through a story about trying on May’s make-up.
“I mean, for now, I’m sure I’ll think of something later.  And you, no more gorgon questions?  Not gonna ask if the snakes sleep when I sleep?”
“Anyway, we told him to get lost.  The bartender told him to get lost. He wouldn’t leave.  And, like, I didn’t want to haul off and punch the guy, since I’d definitely get kicked out for that, even thought he was clearly in the wrong.”
Sarah had thought that she’d was free and clear when the only questions her dads had asked on the way home was if she was ok.  When she could honestly report that she was fine, hadn’t been drinking, and hadn’t been doing anything else illegal, she believe that that was the end of it.  She only realized that she was wrong when she got home and wasn’t allowed to go straight to bed.
“No, she has a point.  Keep going, Sarah.  We’ll talk to Bucky about that in the morning.”  Steve wasn’t entirely sure how to broach the subject of his 16-year-old daughter being hit on by a ‘weirdo’ with Bucky, but he probably should.
“I’m not trans because my dads are gay,” was all Peter could muster in response.  How had this conversation devolved so quickly?
Ned looked up from his lunch tray to see his friend.  Since coming out as trans, Maria had lost weight, obvious now from the loose hem of his sweater he was fiddling with.  “Well, sit down.  What’s this grand name, huh?  I have to make sure it’s good enough for my best friend.”
“We’ll have to leave pretty soon, Pete.  I’m dropping you off at your mom’s then heading back here for that team meeting.”
Steve walked into Peter’s room and sat on the edge of his bed.  While Peter was usually fairly neat, before his weekends with his mom he usually upended his whole room.  He said it was to make sure he didn’t forget anything, but Steve had always thought it was the same stress induced chaos that Tony exhibited.
The silent cab ride home gave Peter time to consider his next move.  He could hardly stand to stay with Pepper when just across town his sister and dad were willing to accept him as he was.
"Oh, sweetheart, what happened?" Steve hadn't seen Peter this upset in a long time, but he'd noticed him isolating himself more and more recently.  He’d also noticed the weight loss, but Tony hadn’t thought it was a problem when Steve mentioned it.  “She’ll come to us when she’s ready, Steve,” was the only answer he gave.
“Yeah, that’s fine, Steve,” Peter said, while pulling clothes off of their hangers and dumping most of them directly onto the floor.  “I’m just looking for one more thing.”
“Speaking of, now that we have the full story, I think we can be done for tonight, right Steve?”  Tony briefly glanced at his husband.  “We’ll talk about punishment in the morning, for going to a concert when you shouldn’t have.  I’m proud of you for standing up for your friend, honey.”
Peter bounced up from the couch, the promise of Thai food reviving him from the onset of starvation.  “Yeah, let’s get Thai.  By the way, what party?”
The clouds started to clear from Peter’s face, the glimmer of hope returning.  “Yeah, Ned, that’s a great idea.”
After Peter had been asleep for about a half hour and the pizza (still on the coffee table) had gone cold, Tony stepped off of the elevator into the penthouse.  It took little time to find Peter and Steve in the dimly lit living room, still on the couch.  Over the years Tony had been married to Steve, he and Peter had become close, so finding them snuggled together was not a surprise.  What was a surprise was that they were both fully asleep at six thirty – they hadn’t even bothered to turn on the TV.
“Besides, you’d be naked if you shifted back.  And you can’t talk as a spider.”  Steve switched tactics, sensing he wasn’t going to win this one.  “What if you need to call home but can’t because you don’t have any clothes on?”
On the couch, Peter was curled up in the fetal position crying into the cushions. Noticing his step-dad walking into the room, Peter tried to sit up and wipe off his face. "Hey, Steve," replied the shaky voice.
“I’m pretty sure our little spider is snoring against your shoulder right now.  Just put him back in his crib, and let’s go back to bed.”
“Waited for your whole alpha-wolf shtick to come out.”  Tony crawled out from under one of the dismantled Ironman suits.  “You know, coming down to find me.”
“Well, Tony should be home soon.  I hope you weren’t too nervous about telling us.  We’ll always love and support you, Peter.”  Steve felt the beginnings of guilt flow through him.  “Did I ever tell you about the first few times we hung out?”  Peter shook his head no and settled in, Steve’s stories were always the best.  “It was before your dad and I started hanging out more.  Heck, I think it was even before your mom and dad got divorced.  Anyway, your parents were fighting, and you found your way into my office looking for someone to play with.  You came in and sat with me while I planned mission schematics and team strategies.  I think you thought it was a game.  And I was so nervous.  I had no idea what to do with a kid, but you just kept coming down.  Anytime your parents were arguing in the penthouse, you’d sneak down into my office to ask about line ups and why Bruce couldn’t always be hulked-out.”
“None really, I do get a bit touchy around some of the Greek Gods, but I don’t imagine that’ll be an issue.  We get along best with other snake types, which is why my best friend is a snake shifter and Pepper is a naga.”
“Ok,” Tony said, sitting down, “whatever it is, you can tell me.  I promise I won’t be mad.  I’m here for you sweetheart.”  Tony let his ramblings stall out, worry etched into his brow.
For the duration of the meal, Peter poked at his pasta and only issued monosyllabic answers to Pepper’s questions.
Sure enough, when Steve glanced down at Peter all eight eyes were closed and very human like snores were coming from his mouth.  “Fine, I give up.  But we’re looking into this in the morning.”
“They get energy from what I eat, but they also like the taste of food.  So, I like to give them a bite or two, of whatever I’m having.  So do you actually turn into a wolf or is it just the ears and tail?”
“His friends don’t seem the type.  Plus, I know someone who’ll beat up anyone who makes fun of him, even if they are kids.”
“It’s nothing bad, Dad.  It’s just… I want you to know, I’m trans.  And I’d prefer if you called me Peter.”  Though he was much calmer this time, Peter still didn’t meet Tony’s eyes.
Life proceeded as chaotically as ever, and Peter’s semi-regular shifts were no longer a cause for concern.
Peter let out a big sigh.  “Ned…” he began, but let his sentence trail off.  A few moments passed, filled with the noise of the cafeteria.  “It’s just…” Peter tried again, “sometimes… like it’s different for trans kids, you know?  And I’ve read all these horror stories online.  And like what if they kick me out or something? Where would I even go?”
“Yeah, but I keep the antivenom on hand just in case.  Plus, they like you, so they won’t bite on purpose.  At least, not with teeth.  Do vampires and werewolves really hate each other?”
When Peter dragged his suitcase out to the living room, Pepper shot up from her seat on the couch.  “Oh, so you’ve decided to leave?  Do you think you’ll like Tony’s reaction better?”  Pepper still held herself with the steadiness of a person with full confidence.  When Peter didn’t respond and continued to take his bag to the door, Pepper became even more angry.  “What will your sister think?” She shouted cruelly.
The world was still swaying a bit, but now there was only one Bucky, crouched over him, flesh hand resting on Tony’s armored chest. “Just stay still, okay?”
Tony slid the ring onto Bucky’s finger, bringing the metal hand up to his lips to kiss. Then he laughed, and Bucky gave him a curious look. “Tastes like plums,” he explained with a grin.
“More or less,” Steve confessed. “And I’m here for you. That is, if you want to come with me.” He was prepared to accept that Tony may not have held onto the feelings they’d shared so many years ago, but when he’d learned of this opportunity he’d had to take the chance.
When JARVIS let Tony know he had a location on Bucky, Tony went alone. He knew Steve would be pissed when he found out, but he just had to see the man. Talk to him. Alone.
Steve stared. Tony’s posture was loose, easy. He didn’t seem to be hiding residual anger, forcing himself to forgive for the benefit of team dynamics. He just seemed... blank.
He manages to dismount in time to grab the charging girl and spin her around in a hug. “Hey there, kiddo! You’re getting big!”
“Goddammit, we’re not expecting him to leave you. But Tony at least deserves an apology for the way he left.”
In the men’s room, Tony refuses Steve’s help to take off the jacket. He removes it, folding it and looking at it with a pout before placing it on the counter.
Tony turns away, and Steve’s heart plummets. “Yeah, well, legend says I’ll never be good enough for Captain America, so that doesn’t matter, does it?”
It could be anyone, but... why would Tony have called him out here to tell him this alone, if it’s not...?
Steve gives in, and leaves Clint in the dust, ricocheting against obstacles deliberately and barely slowed by the blue shells Clint hurls. He completes his final lap before Clint’s halfway through his second.
“For what?” Unlike with Rhodey, the words weren’t laced with hostility. Instead, Tony seemed genuinely confused.
My needs at this point are to care for you and to get you what you need to recover. What do you need?”
“I could have a heart attack and die,” Steve points at the sign listing all the “do not ride if...” conditions, several of which he’s had over the course of his twenty-one years.
scale. (A 5 tends to be reserved for teammates who endanger themselves or others, or news anchors who expect Captain America to be as racist or homophobic as they are.) “Why aren’t you wearing your sling?”
Bucky watched as his boyfriend, often hesitant about public displays of affection, leaned in to give Tony’s cheek a quick peck, then pull back and lick his lips. He smiled. “Buck’s right, real tasty.” He tilted his cone toward Tony. “Wanna try some of mine?”
Tony snorts, and Steve frowns. “Steve, darling, I know you try to rock the humble ‘just a kid from Brooklyn’ look, but you do want to show off.” Before Steve can protest, Tony continues, “You hide it because you don’t want other people to feel bad about themselves, but you do
Steve was cleaning the stove when Tony came in, walked to the coffee pot, and turned it on, all without saying a word.
Steve heads over to Tony, and Tony raises the umbrella high enough for his boyfriend to fit under it as well--not that it will do any good considering Steve’s already drenched, but it’ll let him stand closer.
you...” His eyes widened. “That was horrible, I’m sorry, ignore me, I haven’t slept since Tuesday--”
Tony hovered as Steve hobbled out of the elevator with the single crutch, hovered as Steve made his way to a couch in the common area, and hovered as he sat down. After wheeling the ottoman over for Steve to prop his leg on, Tony gathered about a dozen pillows from the various plush seats and propped them around Steve.
Tony sighs. “I... once or twice, I might’ve thought about it. Briefly. But then you seemed to pick up on that, changed what you were doing, and I ended up enjoying it.” Tony’s eyes drill into his, radiating sincerity. “I love sex with you, Steve. Really.”
...” Steve means for it to come out as reprimanding (though he should’ve learned by now Tony never reacts well to that), but his voice cracks with emotion instead.
“Or you could just stay here with me until my ride shows up,” Tony suggested, leaning down to push a button on some sort of small device attached to an elastic anklet Bucky hadn’t noticed.
He heard Tony chuckle again. “Yeah, it’ll take some getting used to. But that wasn’t even the best part.”
“There we go,” Tony said in a soft, reverent tone. He smiled down at Steve before saying, “Do you have any idea of how gorgeous you are like this? Wish you could see yourself right now. Such a perfect mess for me. Never seen you give yourself up so completely like this before.” He reached down and stroked his own cock once with the hand covered in lube and moaned. “I could get off just watching you like this. But that wouldn’t be as much fun, now would it?”
There was no mistaking it, it was Steve’s voice. He sounded like he was in pain. Tony wasted no time dashing around the corner and nearly crashed into a cabinet as he skidded to a halt at the sight before him.
“I-I’m fine. There’s uh, one other person. But uh…” Steve’s nuzzling his neck again. “Can you give us ten minutes?”
“Not an egg,” Tony said with a smile, like he was reading Steve’s mind. “It’s what I’ve determined to be the best shape for what we’ll be doing. So it’s shaped like an egg but it is definitely anything but.”
“Huh?” He can’t be so obvious already on the first day of his heat, can he? Usually his cologne does the job of masking just about anything he puts out. That and the building’s air filters…
And really, it wasn’t his fault. This whole stupid business trip to Japan had been Obie’s idea. “Show the world what Tony Stark can do,” he’d said. He’d read up on Japanese business culture to prepare. Even learned enough phrases to sound decently polite.
Laughing, Steve followed her. “Fine. You’re right. I could use something to take my mind off everything.”
Steve stifled a yawn as he stood in the crowded train in his own little space carved out partially by the duffel bag sitting between his legs and the fact that his height made him stand out. He glanced around over the dark-haired heads of the car’s other occupants, all of whom were occupied on their phones or asleep. Tokyo was like nothing he’d ever seen before, not even like New York. The city was far more crowded, more chaotic, and yet also calmer than the city he’d grown up in.
“Brother, is there nothing you can do?”, Thor pleaded. Looking over to his brother, Loki maintained the stare for a while and let out a long sigh. He then told Thor that he might be able to lessen the amount of memory loss. But he’s not sure it’s enough and could instead cause permanent damage to the Avenger’s other memories.
Tony retorted saying , “Isn’t that a contradiction to what you were telling me earlier?”, feeling confused, to which Pepper ignored with a hmph.
“How did you managed to get Steve to come for the match?”, Rhodey asked in wonder when he saw Steve changing into his jersey. Tony just gave a proud smile, “I have my ways, Honey bear. Now go win that game”, he told him patting on his shoulder. He then slid out the changing room to give their football team some space but not before looking back to Steve and mouthing ‘You better win’ to him to which the other smiled nervously.
Tony looked around frantically. The guy was suddenly bursting out in tears. What was he supposed to do? Pat him on the back and comfort him? The way he had talked to him. He felt like he was close with this person. And for some reason he heart clenched painfully at the sight of him crying. God, someone please help.
“I won’t give up, ever. Until I make you mine again. So what if you lose your memories, we’ll make new ones. Together. Prepare your future self for a persistent courting from Steve Rogers”, he told him earning a small laugh from the engineer.
He was walking around the hallway looking for the locker room when someone suddenly jumped down from the vents, almost hitting him, scaring the life out of him as he fell backwards. “Oh, hello there. Sorry about that”, the guy said dusting his clothes, “Need a hand?”, he asked looking at Tony who was still sitting on his ass.
Tony continued running errands for the club like making coffee and handing out treats for the guests. He looked at the hosts in their element. They seemed pretty focus on their job. Passing over Clint’s corner he heard him say something about how the girls were all so beautiful he felt like he was surrounded by angels in heaven and was soon followed by girls who were all screaming in joy.
A habit like this. The ideal would be to send this to the same person every week. He pondered on whether to continue sleeping a few more minute or get up for school. But then his phone chimed a notification message.
Just having you stand there glaring at me is scary enough revenge. He thought gazing over to Tony where he stood in the front with the rest of the crowd. He was watching him intently. Staring directly and solely at him.
“I did say that drinking something for commoners would upset the body”, the girl smirked in her seat. She was totally shock as everyone else when Steve smiled brightly, ”This is delicious, Tony. I’ve never tasted something so good”, he said putting a smile on the brunette’s face as well.
There weren’t a lot of passengers at the time. It was just an old lady knitting on the last row seat and a few middle aged men who passed out in the bus. They must have a tough day at work.
Tony woke up from his sleep feeling like he’d been asleep for years. He also felt like he was forgetting something important but couldn’t put his fingers on what it is. Dressing up he decided that a good cup of hot piping coffee would help him clear his mind. So, off he went to his favorite coffee place near the tower. Taking a seat in his usual table he gave his order. With nothing better to do he gazed out the window and onto the bust street.
“Thor, it is I, Thor Odinson. Nice to meet you fellow comrades. How may I address the two of you?”, he said putting his hands on each of their shoulder.
“Oh? That time? I don’t really remember it but I guess it might have happened by mistake. I would not have done it on purpose as I have no reason to cast such spells on Stark”
“Don’t be so dramatic, Tony. I’m sure it isn’t as bad as you said it”, Pepper told him. He wondered what she would react when she finds out that it is exactly as he told her. After talking with them a few more minutes about when they’d have their movie night he ended the call and slept on the couch until his mom came home. After dinner he was still tired as fuck. He’s never like this unless he put up a week of all nighters on his projects. Just one day at SHIELD sure did a number on him. He didn’t think he’ll survive even the month if things keep going like this. The school was not good for his health.
Steve finally getting what Tony was saying gave him a smile. “You’re not very observant. Wrong on both accounts”, he told him.
Dang! Tony couldn’t believe his luck and the fact that he got a scholarship from the best school in the country. Even better news is that he’d be able to have newer and better equipment for his projects instead of simply using old parts since he couldn’t afford good ones. This would definitely help him build even better stuffs than before. Not saying what he made with whatever he got lying around isn’t awesome. He was able to do a pretty amazing job up till now. But with this chance he’ll be able to make the best of the best.
“As you’ve heard before Steve is the most popular host. He’s the ‘Gentleman type’, Natasha as the ‘Mature type’, Clint as the ‘Mischievous type’, Thor as the ‘Jock type’ and finally me as the ‘Bad boy type’”
While he pondered over where he should stay an idea hit him. Rogers lived in Brooklyn. That delinquent classmate of his during high school had stayed here and was currently working as a bodyguard for one of the top mafia boss.
“It’s fine ladies. Here, I’ll drink it first”, the blonde said taking a sip. The room went silent as the rest watched in anticipation. Steve stood frozen at his place, looking as if he’s deep in thought.
“Sorry about him”, Natasha said as she dragged a protesting Clint away from them, joining Thor and Bruce who had went ahead already.
“It’s fine. You’re okay”, she said smiling at him, stroking his head in an affectionate manner. “What is with the big coat on you though?”
Even if I do fall for this person. I’m sure that it won’t go as I want it. I have to tell him! This isn’t some kind of game. So if I don’t split up with him right now….
Tony wasn’t surprised to find Natasha acing this host act and even Thor was a good one. What surprised him was that Barnes was pretty good at this. He’s never gonna admit it out loud though.
They want the guy of their dreams to be beyond perfect, which is obviously impossible for anyone. Sheesh. Real life isn’t fairy tales you read in a book.
“Hey, Tony! Did you get everything on the list?”, Clint said coming over to meet him with a grin. Tony handed him the bags, Clint smiled as he rummage through the things and took out an instant coffee can. He tilted his head to the side, “What is this?”
A smile curved on Bucky’s lips. He had an idea. “That’s good to hear. I like that you have some backbone, kid. Tell you what, you can be the club’s service boy. We’ll pay you for the errands you run for us”
“Can you afford it though? Aren’t scholarship students from low income family?”, Clint stated. Tony hung his head in defeat.
Tony went inside their apartment and quickly flopped down on the couch. His time at SHIELD really took a toll on him. He took out his phone and saw that there were two messages from Rhodey asking how it went and a miss call from Pepper. Tony rubbed his tired eyes and dial Pepper’s number.
Wanda suddenly reached out and grabbed Tony by his tie and pulling him down, landing on top of her. “What did you do that for? That hurts”, Tony winced trying to get up. He noticed a camera flashed from the side.
Though he was all alone in the dimly lit room he seemed so satisfied and happy to be there. How the brunette’s lips curved into a relaxed one as he was putting his invention together, an excited glint in his brown eyes. Totally engrossed in his own world.
Tony felt like a deadly aura was coming from Pepper, “No way….Agreeing to it so lightly!”, she yelled at him.
Realizing what he just did Steve quickly let go of Tony, rubbing the back of his neck in a shy manner. “I…didn’t know what came over me. I’m sorry for doing that”
“Nice to meet ya man. How are your views about our prestigious school so far?”, Clint asked spreading out his hands, gesturing the school.
“Hmm…I guess that’s true”, Tony admitted. Bruce had told him that he didn’t mind spending his free time here. He even added that he was kind of enjoying seeing Tony with the other hosts. Tony felt like Bruce was just having fun at his expense but having him here was kind of calming.
“Now everyone will know how you tried to assault me and you will soon find your poor self being expelled once my brother and I post this around school”, Wanda said with a sly smirk.
“You weren’t?”. Well, that was embarrassing. And now he really wants to wipe that smug look off Bruce’s face.
Tony looked horrified on seeing all the members of the host club together. “Don’t tell me….all of you are in the same class?!”
As Steve was typing in Tony’s name in his phone contact Tony could see a ‘Peggy Carter’ which seemed to be the only girly name he could see. Must be special.
“Finally !! Someone who agrees with me. The uniforms are an overkill. I can’t express myself enough, my awesome individuality with having us wear the same clothes. Also it doesn’t stretch enough to ease my vent trips”, he said in a dramatic manner.
“I like you already. Here we are, the locker area. Knock yourself out. Just search for your name and swipe the I.D. and voila! All you need for class will be right there”
After the host club activities ended for the day Tony went over to pick up his bag he found it to be missing. He asked around if anyone had seen it but no one did. He then looked out the window and noticed something in the fountain. He squinted his eyes trying to make out what it was and soon realized that it was his bag. Someone had thrown his it in the water. Even in an elite school bullies were everywhere.
“Steve….”, Tony started, his voice hoarse from crying. “Steve…I don’t want to forget you…I don’t….Steve”, he continued in a shaky, barely audible voice as he pressed further into the crook of Steve’s neck. It brought tears to the super soldier’s eyes. He couldn’t help it. He doesn’t want that either. He wants Tony to keep the memories of them together. To remember how much he loved the genius, to never forget. He wants Tony to love him, always.
“Then, are you really fine with anyone as long as they confess to you?”, Tony asked, making eye contact. “Even if they are totally not your type?”, he added.
“Don’t answer me with a question! And you better not skip it mister. I decided that I’m going to go watch the match today and you’re gonna play. This is what happens when you wake me up for no reason. I’m getting my revenge. That’s all”
Getting to the car the blonde was greeted by his driver who was telling him he was getting worried and almost searched for him when he took so long to return. Steve apologized for the trouble. The driver who Steve introduced as Jarvis looked at the boys interlinked hands with a thoughtful look. Feeling nervous Tony took out his hand reluctantly from Steve’s.
“I knew I feel like I saw you somewhere before even if I don’t go out much. Saw you on TV a few weeks ago”
Tony caught by surprised slipped off his grip on the railing. He shut his eyes tightly, was sure he was gonna hit the ground and broke a bone or something but the pain never came as he felt himself being caught by a pair of strong arms. Adrenaline rushed through his whole body, his heart pounding loudly in his chest.
“Are you alright, Tony? Are you feeling any pain? Do I need to call the doctors?”, he asked him, reaching out to hold his hand. Steve felt a pang in his heart when Tony flinched at the contact.
