John entered the pub a few minutes late and found Greg wedged into a corner table, curled around a mostly empty glass with two more full ones in front of him and picking through a half-empty basket of chips.
John turned his attention to the fairly large, quietly murmuring crowd, which had formed seemingly out of nowhere. This was starting to happen more and more frequently with crimes committed in public. One or two people tracked the police - they even knew which car was Greg’s - and waited to see if Sherlock and John showed up. Then some sort of electronic notice would go out, and the fans would appear. Fans. At crime scenes. As long as they stayed behind the tape, there wasn’t anything the Met could legally to do get rid of them. The officers had taken to quickly erecting black tents around the more grisly scenes - if they didn’t, pictures of dead people ended up on Twitter and families started talking about lawsuits.
Sometimes it was nowhere near terrific, and John found himself answering all of the client email and scrubbing experiments out of the bathtub two days running. “
(My aim is to update this story daily until all ten parts are posted. My schedule's a little wonky right now, so I might miss a day, so I'm not promising. But I expect that's what will happen.)
They ended up back on the couch with heaping plates of food and more still on the table next to them. Sherlock insisted everything John had selected tasted better but refused to switch plates with him, nibbling delicately at the choicest pieces of everything available while John shook his head and ate around him. In this way, it was as if they’d never been apart. Sherlock filled him in about Mrs. Hudson and the hip replacement she had scheduled for the spring and John talked about a few of his favorite regular patients that hadn’t made it into the blog posts. They talked about cases Sherlock had been working on and Molly’s nice but incredibly dull new boyfriend and how Sherlock had been trying for two months to get Lestrade to admit that he and Mycroft had gone out to dinner.
I understand that you felt you needed to leave London, but what I’m saying is that he’s not okay. No matter what temporary stupidity made him turn you down, he’s not okay with your being gone.
John’s heart slammed against the walls of his chest and his eyes grew hot again. “You read it. When could you have read it?”
“There's an update on the London Pollinator Project--that thing where they put the little license plates on bees to make them easier to track, remember?” John kept his face carefully blank as Sherlock stilled completely.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Don't be ridiculous. I'm letting a Magic 8-Ball app decide. It's not quite as trustworthy, but the actual Ball ruins the line of my coat.”
No one had ever said anything to John that felt more like a punch. He fisted his hands in his hair, desperately trying to figure out what was happening, and Sherlock kept talking. “You have spent the last several years--all of the years, really, since we met--choosing anyone and everything that wasn't me. I know I pushed you away the very first night, but there were a thousand moments after that where you could have. Had me."
“We died that day, Sherlock,” John pressed on, a rasp edging his words now. “We died, and it almost killed me, and I can’t do it again.” Sherlock watched helplessly as John raised his other hand and scrubbed at his cheek. “I thought I could do this, that we could do this--”
“Excellent timing, John. I see you’re still being held hostage by mundane habits.” Sherlock tilted John’s chin up and pressed a brief kiss to his mouth. “Shall we go investigate the contents of that hamper?”
John might have to start his own mind palace just to catalog the sounds Sherlock made during sex, because fucking hell, he'd never heard anything so unbelievably hot in his life.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. He swung his feet down to the floor and pushed himself up to a sitting position, leaning forward and staring at his brother. “I usually believe that, but you never agree with me.”
John’s eyes were wet and his fingers tightened over Sherlock’s. “No more waiting.” And then he leaned in, or Sherlock leaned in, and he let his eyes slide shut and…
is the house where he is staying, perfectly located for a 15-minute walk to and from the clinic every day. (That site--for Beara estate agent J.J. O'Sullivan!--doesn't have an address, but wherever I originally found that house did - I mapped it out pretty carefully. I wanted to be able to picture him somewhere specific.)
"And now," continued Mycroft relentlessly, "he will give up even more for you. He will give up the work he loves and the city he calls home so that he can take a job with me that he will hate just to get away from you. Tell me, Doctor Watson--why is it always
John opened his mouth to tell Sherlock exactly where the popcorn would end up if he did, when another voice came from behind Mycroft.
. More than once Donovan had snarked about putting a red carpet along the tape line, but Sherlock just brushed her aside as usual.
“I am, aren’t I. Christ, I don’t know what’s gotten into--” John shook his head again, staring down at the ground, and still he made no further move toward the door. Sherlock’s heart cracked wide open, and he knew what to do. It might not be what people did, but it would be what he would do.
John couldn't even fake surprise when he stumbled numbly out of the front door of 221B and saw the black car idling at the curb. When the door opened, he got in, closing the door quietly as he slid into the seat. There was white noise in his head, and it wouldn't clear. Maybe he was asleep and about to wake? Surely this wasn’t his reality now, this world without Sherlock? He watched his hands clenching and unclenching in his lap and wondered, idly, if Mycroft was planning to kill him.
Sherlock’s voice, nearly inaudible, came from the sitting room. John took a few steps closer and finally recognized Sherlock’s figure, slumped low in his armchair, lit only by the embers of a dying fire. He reached for a lamp, but Sherlock’s voice stopped him. “Leave the lights off, please.”
“He’s not exactly calling me at all hours either,” John spat, and heard the sudden bitterness in his tone.
, and he grit his teeth and he swallowed down the screams and the vomit that mingled in his throat every minute and he packed away the detritus of a failed life. It was the kind of task your best friend might help you with, he thought, forcing down yet another hysterical laugh, if your best friend wasn’t Sherlock and if you hadn’t spent years slowly and methodically breaking his heart. In the back of his mind, every day, he thought how convenient it would be if someone would just blow the house up and save him from having to deal with it.
“I love you.” John watched Sherlock’s shoulders sag, and then his eyes opened again, slowly, and they were unreadable. “You haven't deduced everything,” John pressed on.”I love you. I want to come home.”
“Of course not, John! I’m just putting in a search for the new hashtag so I can look at everything later.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes, turning the ball window-up. To John’s surprise, his lips quirked a little, and he thrust the ball out.
The first finger slipped in easily, thanks to the rimming, and John mentally added another point in that act’s favor. He pulled it out and eased two in slowly, stopping at the first knuckle when Sherlock let out a hiss of discomfort. They breathed together, John rubbing slow circles on Sherlock’s stomach, and John only moved again when Sherlock nodded. This time Sherlock exhaled as John pushed in, and soon both fingers were completely inside. John moved them in and out slowly, carefully, twisting them a little and pressing down until...
The November wind bit at John’s cheeks, ruffling his hair and slipping under his coat collar as he fumbled his keys out of his pocket. His phone was buzzing in his trousers, but his hands--clumsy in thick woolen gloves--were barely capable of fitting the front door key into the lock, let alone checking a text. It wasn't until he'd dropped his coat onto a chair, put the kettle on, and gone for a much-needed trip to the toilet that he remembered to check his phone.
“Yes, and I won’t say it again, so don’t ask. In a moment, we can both pretend this conversation never happened. What you are doing won’t work, Sherlock. It won’t change anything for you, and I am…afraid. For you.” Mycroft pushed on before Sherlock could say anything. “Generally it is my practice to pretend you do not have interpersonal relationships, so let me just get this over with. I know I promised that I would not tell you anything about him, and I will not. I will simply encourage you to take a look around the back end of that hideous blog of his, if you’re interested in perhaps reading any entries that he hasn’t bothered to make public. I feel quite sure you can deduce the password without any help from me.”
John swallowed hard, unable to look away. "I don't--what--" He shook his head sharply and tried again. "What are you really asking me, Mycroft?"
, and I still love you.” He huffed out a laugh and shook his head a little. “Trying to get you to remember that I existed or to be a little nicer to Molly was not trying to improve you. There's a you in there that already knows how to treat the people he feels affection for. I just helped you...remember he existed. That same you is also sometimes a selfish arsehole who puts decaying body parts in the crisper with the spinach and passive-aggressively saws at the violin instead of calling up Mycroft and telling him to fuck off.” John paced away a little and then back, sighing. “Christ, Sherlock, I'm an insufferable prick too. We've both been different this year, apart, and maybe we’re both permanently different. I'll admit I wouldn't hate it if the Sherlock-who-cleans visited every once in awhile; I'm guessing you'd be happy to see the last of the John-who-storms-out. We might get home and find out that we are both changed, or we may be the same fundamental Sherlock and John we've always been. I don't see how we are supposed to know that until we're back in London together.”
With an inaudible sigh, Mycroft sank into one of the green armchairs and waited for his brother to wake up. He used the time to examine the flat and Sherlock himself. It was true; he’d never seen 221B cleaner than it was right now. The sitting room was completely free of clutter. He suspected Sherlock had boxed up everything that reminded him of John and either discarded it or put it up in the second bedroom - probably the latter - and when that was completed, there simply wasn’t much left.
As I've been posting each chapter, I've been reviewing the rest of the fic every time. Last night I decided that the end needs something more, so I'm adding a chapter. Posting schedule for the rest: chapter 10 tomorrow; no chapter on Friday (I'm out all day and all night for work); chapter 11 on Saturday; epilogue on Sunday.
Said madman was standing in the open doorway of 221B, having just set the last of the suitcases down in the front hallway, and gazing at John with a combination of love, and anticipation, and disbelief. Slowly, he held out a hand, and John bent down, snapped the lead off of Einstein’s collar, and nudged the dog up the stairs and through the door. When he hesitated, however, Sherlock came down the steps to join him.
The day is not one of significance (though it is about to become one). It is nothing more than an ordinary London Tuesday, gray with threatening rain, a hint of winter chill still clinging to the beginnings of spring.
Mrs. Hudson pursed her lips, and her whole face pulled downward. “I’ve seen him in a lot of moods, but this is a new one. There wasn’t nearly the amount of breaking things and screeching violin as I expected there to be after John left. I’m not sure what to make of it. You’ll understand when you see.” And with that, she gestured him up the stairs and went back into her flat.
John grinned. “God help me, I do.” Sherlock had always mocked the terms of endearment that others used, but John had quickly learned that the easiest way to bring a flush to his skin was to use one.
Early in the trip they'd lost two days after Sherlock had walked too close to the edge of the Cliffs of Moher and impulsively opened his arms to the rushing wind. When he'd turned around to find John and seen him crouched on the ground, nearly hyperventilating with panic, he’d realized his mistake immediately. It was fortunate they'd been renting a tiny cottage for a few days, because the horrible succession of arguments, accusations, and confessions they'd hurled at one another for nearly 48 hours straight would have certainly gotten them ejected from a hotel. It had been during those days, however, that Sherlock had finally, haltingly, begun to tell him about those lonely, harrowing, horrible years, and that John was finally able to listen and begin to understand. Through his acceptance of Sherlock’s truths, he'd been able to share his own pain in turn.
Tea and toast and quiet Baker Street mornings. Crime scenes and danger and the triumph of getting it right. Waking up in Sherlock’s--no,
Calmly, Sherlock pushed back from the table, rising to his feet and opening a cupboard. He removed a box of biscuits, offered them to Greg first, and at the DI’s head shake, slipped his own hand into the box. He ate a chocolate-covered biscuit slowly, staring off toward the sitting room, while Greg sat and drank tea, waiting to see what else he would say.
Neither of them had said anything in the fifteen minutes since they left the house. He suspected John was waiting for him to speak, and he allowed that it was a reasonable expectation. He had been the one to send John away in London, and he had been the one to renew their contact. He had been the first to say “I love you” that day and the one to express lingering uncertainty. He was the one that needed to work out what was in his head.
John’s mouth dropped open, but then the implication behind Sherlock’s words hit him like a freight train. The water seemed to suddenly run cold, and he shivered once, violently. John knew exactly how long Sherlock had waited to have him, to love him, to be loved by him, because it was entirely his fault. They could have had this, all of this, so long ago. If he hadn't been so fucking stupid. He swallowed hard, wondering if there would ever be anything he could say that would make this better.
It was two hours before John, his head and heart on emotional overload, closed Sherlock’s notebook and set it aside. He wiped away a few last tears--he’d cried more this year than he had during the entire rest of his life--and put his head in his hands.
“John, I wouldn’t have let her lick the lichen,” Sherlock said, quietly fervent, and John could feel a lump start in his throat that he needed to swallow around before he could reply.  Reaching out, he took hold of a bony shoulder under the expensive silk dressing gown and squeezed tight.
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes.  That’s the whole of it,” he said triumphantly, sketching a bow and releasing John’s hand.
That provoked a glare as vicious as any dagger-strike, followed by a look of hurt that John felt guilty about until he recalled that bailing his dear, drunken sister out of the city prison was the entire reason he was in Pandathaway to begin with.  Well.  That and…
So he fought against the poison of the iron, the way it lanced into him like a spear and slashed jagged red lines of pain into every breath.  And when Mycroft gave him Rosamund Mary’s true name (he suspected as an apology, though it was never stated as such) he used it to ruthlessly expose her purpose.  A spy from Underhill.  A ‘compatriot’ of Moriarty, a servant to the Queen, meant to quietly dispose of Sherlock and his human pet so that the Unseelie Court could avenge its lost knight.  When he commanded her to forget she had ever known John Watson, she could do naught but comply.
*Of course I can read minds.  I know a lot more than just your name.  I know you’re a soldier recently invalided home and dismissed from service due to a grievous arrow wound to your shoulder.  Your sister welcomed you home but you’re hesitant to stay with her, possibly because she drinks far too much, more likely because of her strained relationship with her lover Clara who likes you far more than she should and who thinks your limp is psychosomatic – quite correctly, I’m afraid.  Satisfied?*
His sister’s voice, loud and reckless with the wine she’d indulged in earlier, cut through the noise of the market and made John wince, shoulders hunching reflexively.  He still wasn’t used to the crowds here.  And the chaos.  Everything comes to Pandathaway, was a well-known saying back home but he’d thought it a bit of an exaggeration.  Now, being surrounded by the pushing crowd, dodging horse dung and begging urchins at every step, it didn’t seem like ‘everything’ was such a stretch.  He caught sight of Harry’s brightly coloured tunic by an ironworkers stall and shoved his way through the throngs of people to follow her.
“Oh,” Sherlock finally exclaimed as John handed over his tea.  “I suppose I could…relax a little.  For an hour or so.  If you were joining me.”
*No need to panic,* Sherlock said.  *I’m very clever, you know.  I’m not going to let us get caught.*
“I’ll leave you to think it through, then.  Sunrise at the airfield.  Oh, and Sherlock…”  He took an envelope out of his pocket and placed it on the table.  “For old time’s sake.”
He only had time to gasp before the flames hit him, but it didn’t burn his skin or blacken his hair.  His clothes weren’t even singed!  The coating of sewage on his clothing, however, crinkled into ashes and floated away leaving him clean as if he’d just stepped out of the bath.  The next jet of flame covered Sherlock’s own body, peeling away centuries of waste in an instant and leaving the scales shining and sparkling like obsidian in the sun.  The golden collar and the rest of the chains fell away into slag at John’s feet.
John thought, and then gripped the chain.  Nothing happened, no burning, no pain.  There was still no pain when he brought the butt of the dagger down on the chain, nor when—on the seventh strike—the link finally broke.
Still blushing, Sherlock took a long sip of tea and then retreated to his microscope, away from John’s suggestive grins.  Well satisfied with how his ‘unwinding time’ was progressing today, John eased himself into one of the kitchen chairs and cuddled his daughter on his lap.  It might not have been the way he’d imagined his life turning out three or four years ago, but he had to admit that he’d rarely ever felt so satisfied, so grounded.
John smiled and said, “Absolutely feel free to come by anytime we are home. If you have any concerns or questions, don’t hesitate to ask us if Sherlock is not willing to answer them I most certainly could.”
I pulled my eyes away from the picture and said, “Mostly only girls in her fashion class I mean there was this one exchange student she would meet for coffee on Saturday’s, but I assure you that’s not him in the photo I had seen of him he was Middle Eastern. This man appears to be I don’t know American-ish looking though some of his features look slightly Asian. Judging by how he appears dressed, he might be a resident here. I mean, I have seen some English people dress like that well in photos to be perfectly honest.”
I leaned into the demon's chest, my body slowly relaxing the longer the demon kept peaceful, finding this all confusing and slightly overwhelming, but my reckless curiosity was telling me he had to know more so I asked: “Do you know what happened to Mabel?”
John looked up at the statue and asked, “So this is the dangerous creature you faced seven years ago? I don’t know he looks kinda cute.”
John looked like he was thinking, “What if we talk to some of these shop keepers? Maybe they saw this man and your sister at one point?”
I made myself dinner using the food in the house, knowing Mabel wouldn’t mind and hoping she was okay. I sat down and watched television for a couple of hours, finding nothing eye-grabbing on and finally clicked the flat screen off and moved to the guest room, not having the emotional strength to sleep amongst Mabel’s things cause that was asking for a night of bad dreams. I laid down curling up in the blanket dozing off when I felt a weird feeling like something wasn’t right, followed by the sweet smell of cinnamon, which I had never smelled in Mabel’s flat before.
Sherlock jumped up like he was on a spring and said, “Excellent, then I shall go get John, and we will accompany you.”
“So it appears William is in town and not of the same alignment he was for the past millennia. While I am curious to speak with him, I highly doubt I am someone he has the nerve to speak to at the moment.” Theodore said while sipping out a lidded Styrofoam cup.
John looked away. “I don’t want you to get hurt. It's different when you’re dealing with human beings, and normal criminals cause there is always a solid answer, but now we are dealing with real monsters here and real magic with no definitive answers…I…I…”
Sherlock suddenly made a noise of accomplishment and said: “I knew I would find it if I looked in these files.”
Mycroft just smirked, “I would assume not. Well, best not hold up your detective work I am sure the boy wants his case solved so he can return home.”
Dipper shook his head, explaining, “I’m not sure anymore I mean, all the signs are there, but his personality is the complete opposite of Bill. He’s too polite even after he is outed for doing something bad, and the Bill I know would have killed me for attacking him. I have to come to the conclusion that’s not Bill, though something to keep our eye on.”
John seemed to perk up when Sherlock called his veteran status into question and gripped his dog tags giving Sherlock a determined face and walked towards the art museum as Sherlock and I walked at a distance behind him.
I looked up and sighed “I don’t know everything about him most of my encounters with him were your standard bad guy trying to take what doesn’t belong to him by any means necessary it’s not like he’s your standard Disney villain that monologues about himself in the form of a cliché song or spectacle but pretending to know how a nutjob like him thinks is a fruitless task because just when you think you have solved all of his riddles he pulls five more out of his ass.”
I stared at the coldly passionate man before looking down and looking back up at him with determination in my eyes, “You are very much understood, Sherlock Holmes.”
Bill shrugged as he took another sip of his tea. “I like you, and you didn’t ask to be molested by Theo. Do you need any better reasons other than I didn’t want to watch my brother molest on the hood of a police car?”
A man came rushing down the stairs pulling on his coat. He was about my height with neat light brown blonde hair sporting an annoyed expression in the direction of Sherlock, who responded: “You were taking too long, and I was getting bored waiting for you.”
I looked confused when he said sealed which prompted him to explain “William hasn’t been dead these past seven years he has been floating in the void to kill a Geonyx demon you have to destroy their soul otherwise they just get thrown into the void like scattered particles and depending on their age it may take months to years for them to pull themselves pack together into a functioning form.”
Bill spoke again “I hope Shootingstar is alright it got kinda lonely without her here, and I’m worried sick about her she is still pretty new to London technically I have been here many times in many different time eras.”
I quietly got up from the bed and tiptoed down the hall hiding around the corner when I heard a rustle of papers, and a man’s voice says “Okay, let's go over these again. Hopefully, that older woman won’t interrupt me again. Though it was my fuck up for leaving the door ajar good job, Bill makes your break in look as obvious as an amateur.”
I didn’t know how much to tell them but started by saying, “Yeah, but as far as we are concerned, he’s dead, he would be dead for seven years as of this year. I mean, the way he died was something I don’t think he could have survived. But if he survived, I wouldn’t doubt he’d go after my family though it confuses me why he started with Mabel and not me or my Great uncle Ford since we were the biggest thorn in his side and caused him the most problems why not pick off your number one and number two problem instead of jumping to like problem number four.”
I laughed and said, “No, you guys have been getting my age wrong for the last couple of hours, and I haven’t found a reasonable opportunity to correct you.”
John gives a mock offended gasp. “Well, I for one loved Dr. Seuss I even had a Cat in the Hat jumper when I was a kid.”
Ms. Hudson smiled softly “Of course dear I will let you ride out the three month’s rent she put down before I start pestering you for money
Bill held onto me tighter and said, “I don’t know weird thing is when I tried to track her via her mental wavelength. I couldn’t find it like something was blocking me out kind of how I can’t track Ford because of his metal plate protecting his mind. However, one thing struck me as odd a couple of days before she disappeared a salesman came up to her door trying to sell her shit now this wouldn’t be as odd if it weren’t for the glaring no soliciting sign on the front door downstairs and the fact that this salesman was as flat as a ten-year-old girl because aren’t salesman supposed to be energetic a full piss and vinegar trying to shove there product down your throat?”
Bill was silent before saying “I know this sounds bad, but I’m not sure Dipper I woke up naked in a warehouse next to my statue and wandered London for a few days seeing if I could make sense of shit before a girl helped me out that turned out to be your sister. She had no idea who I was but brought me food every day, claiming she wasn’t afraid of my appearance due to having dealt with many supernatural creatures and let me stay here out of sight of the landlady to get me off the street and somewhere safe. I told her my name was William, which is my name, but I felt it would get me more sympathy then using the name Bill. I told her I was leaving for a couple of days and came back to find her missing, however, I had to hide for a while cause the landlady saw me one night. I sent you the postcard hoping you would show up and help me find her, but I chickened out when you showed up and hid within the apartment.”
John looked exhausted, trying to keep up and sat in a chair running his hand over his face as I asked: “So you have seen all these fantastical beast up close and personal?”
John sighed and picked the man up, putting him in a chair so he didn’t wake up on the floor when Sherlock spoke up, “I think we should head to the art museum anyway.”
Bill sighed, “I think it’s less changed and more so woke up. Imagine being asleep for centuries only to wake up and become conscious of yourself in an alien surrounding with all the memories of the past millennia hitting you like a freight train much of the memories being of shit you would never do even if someone paid you a vast sum of money. I have done some terrible shit so terrible I often question why I even woke up in the first place since I am pretty sure something as dangerous as me shouldn’t have the right to breathe.”
Sherlock looked like he was thinking then sighed “I don’t think this statue is going to give us any more answers we should focus on following you sisters activities leading up to her disappearance perhaps that will shed a little light on what our gold demon friend is up to if he is a factor in this equation.”
Sherlock made a weird noise between a grunt and a slight groan before saying, “Never liked Dr. Seuss even as a child, it was too colorful and dull wasn’t a fan of the tongue twisters as a child.”
Sherlock was barely listening as he walked around Bill statue with his eyes narrowed and said: “Dipper was there ever a big patch of gold on the back of his statue?”
John sighed, “Fine. We will both take your case if only to appease Sherlock’s fascination this Bill Cipher you so adamantly insist exists but one thing Sherlock this is a personal case I would rather not broadcast this in our blog.”
My heart was racing as I quickly and quietly moved back to my room and slipped under the bed, trying to still my racing heart as I could hear footsteps walking around the flat. My heart felt close to exploding when I listened to Bill’s footsteps walking up the hall the smell of cinnamon getting stronger and more suffocating when my door opened quietly, and from my place, under the bed, I saw a blue glow like he was using his magic to find me in the dark. All I could see of him were the black slacks he was wearing with the fancy biker boots that looked too chunky for how light his steps were.
My heart skipped a minor beat, but I tried to keep the shock off my face and said, “He does sound like an odd character, but honestly, I would assume with it being October it was probably some idiot dressed up in his Halloween costume trying not to get caught. If it’s okay with you I would have no problem paying rent here and keeping my sisters flat clean as well as keeping an eye on it in case that punk comes back.”
Sherlock let go of my hand and said, “I see. If you're looking for your sister’s flat, it is upstairs. I have no doubt the landlady will let you in if you tell her you’re a relative of the young lady living there.”
The way John’s eyes flicked over at me this was something of a personal matter the way he said “certain someone” so I took that as my cue to excuse myself and said, “Well I won’t keep you guys any longer I’m going to go talk to the landlady. I will get back to you on a later date since I might be your new neighbor if the landlady will let me live in Mabel’s flat, so have a nice day, and thank you for the help.”
I nervously adjusted my hat and held out a hand, “Dipper Pines um…nice to meet you, Officer Lestrade.”
Out of pure impulse, I asked Sherlock, “Not to be nosy or presumptuous, but you two seem awful close for just roommates…I uh…are you guys um…dating?”
Sherlock didn’t look up as he switched between typing and clicking but said: “One of the few tolerable children’s books I owned as a child.”
John looked up like he was casting his eyes in the direction of her flat before looking at me again. “Yeah, I haven’t seen her in a couple of days. I would assume college work made her a shut-in, but the university here in London held their grad ceremony almost a month ago. I would talk to the landlady Ms. Hudson and see what she may know if you have any more questions or if this gets any more out of hand perhaps Sherlock or I can help you locate her in our spare time London is a big place for one lone teen to go on a one-person search.”
My face heated up, and I said, “What? No. Jesus, do you always get defensive with mortals who know next to nothing about demons?”
His neutral expression never changed except for a slight possible imagined narrowing of his eyes, which for some reason (again could be my imagination) seemed to flick upstairs at the mention of the knitted blue scarf around his neck.
John nodded understanding and said to me, “If anything I say confuses you, please don’t hesitate to ask I have traveled to the States a couple of times while serving in the military so I can either adapt to your speech or explain mine. Whatever works for you.”
Sherlock developed a small smirk. “Police here are as harmless as they are useless. That’s why they employ me. I make up for what they lack. The only decent officer is a man name Lestrade but most of the time, asking him will get you directed to me. So either way, people come crawling to me for help.”
“Right so one more thing we encountered another demon who we think might have ties to Mabel’s kidnapping, but we can’t identify them besides the fact they turn your eyes sapphire blue when possessing you. They seemed pretty adamant about us not getting involved and even mentioned you by the name William. He wouldn’t happen to be family too would he Bill?”
Sherlock impressively stayed passive through the whole lecture when I felt like I was being watched closely and followed my paranoia to see Theodore looking at me from where he was leaning on a patrol car. I took a deep breath and walked over to him, calmly, keeping eye contact with him until I was within talking range.
He hissed under his breath what suspiciously sounded like “goddammit” and settled his chin on my shoulder saying, “Give me a break Dipper you try being deprived of emotions and sanity for almost a millennia and tell me the first thing you wouldn’t do is hug something warm and soft.
This guy was creepy with how he could dissect you down to the finest detail with no prior knowledge, but I swallowed my nerves and said calmly, holding out my hand “Yeah um my name is Dipper Pines nice to meet you Mr…”
Sherlock's face twitched ever so slightly at the name “Billy,” and his eyes held a smoldering anger making them appear a shade darker though he kept his composure and calmly said “People are useless until you at least make it to your second year in college I like my “friends” to serve me a purpose I can’t afford to have useless people in my life now can I brother?” He said this, looking pointedly at Mycroft.
I ran my fingertips over his gold fingernails and asked: “Why stay when you can just up and disappear into the multiverse somewhere and start over.”
Bill shook his head, “That’s not how my mother raised me Dipper. My mother would expect me to fix my mistakes instead of running. She said no matter how painful paying for a mistake is paying your debt is always a better answer than running, and to me, I hope if I make amends and face my problems, I will gain someone’s trust back.”
Ms. Hudson looked over at the window and said, “He kept repeating the words “shooting star” like a mantra.”
Suddenly there was a knock on the door before it opened and Mycroft and Theodore walked in Mycroft looking directly at me making Sherlock give a bored unfazed look even though his brother just walked in uninvited and asked: “Can we help you?”
John spastically nodded and said, “Anything to prevent that creature from getting in here while I am asleep. I am not dying at thirty-five.”
I nodded, trusting Sherlock’s opinion as to the only reasonable one I had to trust and followed him and John out of the museum to a taxi taking us back to Baker St. We settled in the Sherlock’s and John’s flat and I couldn’t help but notice John looking out of sorts.
Sherlock nodded as well as John who still looked unsure about this whole thing but going with it possibly out of concern for his partner, seeing as John seemed like the one with good reasoning skills out of the two of them as opposed to Sherlock’s reckless thirst for knowledge. We called a taxi and arrived at the museum Sherlock snapping at the receptionist that it was ridiculous she was asking us to pay to continue an investigation and seemed to belittle her though not openly until she let us through with clearance to look at Bill’s statue believing we were indeed a police investigation. We looked around until we found it in a modern art section, and I slowly approached the stone cast nightmare glaring at it knowing it didn’t deserve to be displayed with real art and felt the overwhelming urge to push it off its neat little pedestal and hopes it shattered. Suddenly a clammy hand grabbed mine and uncurled my finger from my palm reveal angry red nail marks in my hand, one of which was bleeding a little as I looked up and saw Sherlock staring at me.
Sherlock looked at John in silence before saying, “Love is a distraction. I don’t want someone as useful as John to lose that efficiency because of any romanticism between us.”
The demon vanished into thin air, leaving us all in silence when I spoke voicing the first thought that popped up “Is it me or did anyone feel a slight stir in their preferred underwear when that thing looked at you.”
The alabaster demon looked shocked and merely said, “I see…I shall leave for now you seem to have more important things to deal with than me I shall wipe Mycroft of this encounter and leave you to your investigation. Perhaps we will have use for one and another in the future, seeing as the plot seems to be thickening rather quickly. Much quicker than I would like to be fair.”
I bristled “That’s my sister Bill I would appreciate if you didn’t talk so flippantly about her breasts I still don’t entirely trust you I merely giving you the benefit of the doubt even though with all the fucking mental problems I have because of you I shouldn’t even be giving you that.”
Sherlock flagged down the shop keeper and whipped out the photo asking bluntly without introducing himself first. “We are looking for any leads you might have on these two individuals who appear to be exiting your shop a couple of hours ago via street surveillance we believe the girl in the photo is a kidnapping victim.”
I frowned hating this feeling of uncertainty myself for once not having a clear path of how to proceed, then again, magic wasn’t real until a few hours ago. It made me wonder just how many weird things I have overlooked in my life this though only making me feel more frustrated with myself.
Sherlock looked like he was trying not to break his flat expression when he struck the man, still wearing his calm, calculating look and watched unapologetically as the man went down in a heap thankfully no longer talking leaving John looking shaken.
I shook my head. “Bill is a monster that has no regard for anything or anyone and will say anything to get what he wants, forcing you to play a Russian roulette type game concerning whether or not your gonna get what he promised you.”
He started to the door, and I had seconds to process what he said and started after him sputtering as I shut the flat door behind me “What? Why? I just met you. No offense I’m not the kind of person to accept help that is just thrown at me by a stranger I mean how the hell do I know I can trust you for all I know and again no offense, but you and John could be dangerous or untrustworthy in the long run though I highly doubt it since my sister would actively talk to both of you, and she has an excellent judge of character that seems almost invasive on many levels but still where is my time to get comfortable with you?”
I wanted to laugh but kept impressively silent as Sherlock’s jab didn’t seem to faze Mycroft one bit as he said: “Well, at least some of us had friends Billy.”
I smiled and said, “Just turned twenty this August, so I am only eleven years younger than Sherlock.”
Bill sighed, “If I did Pinetree, she would be safe already whatever took her knows how to cover its tracks to almost an inhuman detail.”
Theo shrugged “All you have to do is ask what I am doing I’m not exactly doing anything I feel I should hide from you so if you must know I am currently running case I eavesdropped on over a Galactic Federation communication channel detailing an incident that led to a bunch of deaths that suspiciously sounded like someone of my species caused them, but after thoroughly listening to the report I ruled out William’s involvement. Last known energy signature I felt for the suspect led me to this human dimension and dropped me in London where I discovered my brother’s statue to be though it exuded no magic like it did when visited it in Gravity Falls seven years ago, so I assumed he was no longer sealed.”
I growled and tried to protest but was met with Bill softly running his nails up and down my spine spanning his fingers out hitting all the sensitive places on my back and shoulders before his other hand came up and pulled my head to rest on his shoulder my eyes feeling heavy my brain feeling foggy from the sensation of his nails slowly gliding over the bare skin of my back as Bill pet my hair singing before whispering “Sleep sweet Pinetree I shall leave you a clue to your mystery come morning light.”
The flight felt like it was going to drag on forever. I was unsure how long I could stay sitting fiddling with the sparkly postcard when we finally landed I had to control myself from launching myself out of my seat and off the plane the busy London streets calling out to me in a foreboding manner. I grabbed my bags, walking along the sidewalk of the airport, quickly texting Grunkle Ford that I had made it to London safely getting a relieved text back and a request to keep him updated on my sister's weird behavior. He hadn’t been able to come with me due to him and Grunkle Stan being in Australia when I got the strange postcard. I had received it two days ago telling me to hurry to London with no other explanation other than I needed to make it there quickly. Mabel had been studying abroad to see new places. After almost a year post graduating, she had found a college in London that she managed to get a rather prestigious scholarship that allowed her to attend without paying the ridiculous amount of money out of pocket. After completing her classes, she decided to stay an extra month before coming home, but a week before she arrived home, I received this postcard, which almost made it sound like she was in trouble. I caught a cab and had them take me to the address on the postcard.
Lestrade shook my hand. “Call me Greg or just Lestrade. It’s all Sherlock calls me pretty sure he doesn’t even know my first name, to be honest.”
Lestrade scratched the stubble on his cheek. “Yeah, that’s what got us stumped. Oh and speaking of security Sherlock next time you accuse an officer of being a phony you’re spending a month in a cell for false accusation that new guy Theodore he does have records they got lost among my paperwork and he about had an anxiety attack when he got questioned due to an anonymous email sent to the head of the Scotland Yard I wonder who that could have been? Also, I looked into his old file. It’s all there. He is legitimately from a police force in Ireland, so please do YOUR research before you put one of my men in a bad spot!”
I sighed, “I’m sure she will be fine Bill, she is pretty resourceful, but it would help if you could give me any clues as to why she might have gotten taken or who might have taken her.”
I had to repress a shiver at Sherlock’s choice in words and said: “Well I wanted to check an art museum where Bill’s statue would be on display that would be the first thing we would investigate in the event of him reappearing seeing as it’s his glorified dead body.”
I coughed, causing him to jump and scream the sound kind of comical as he looked over at me and narrowed his bulbous eye in annoyance “Jesus Pinetree, a little warning would be nice instead of creeping ominously in the corner.”
John gave Sherlock a scared look and said: “You heard what that monster said we should just stay away.”
He suddenly looked over in surprise and said, “I thought I heard Sherlock talking to someone. I thought it was odd since the only person he talks to here is Ms. Hudson and I. My name is John Watson, and you are?”
She started walking away and walked up to a door pulling out a key and opening the door to reveal a neat flat decorated in a very Mabel like way and I settled on her couch while Ms. Hudson sat across for me and said with reservations “You're probably going to find me as loony as the police did, but I know what I saw that night.”
I shivered at the thought of Bill trying to seduce me and asked: “Is there any way to avoid the latter option?”
Dipper nodded, “A lot of magical creatures exist within Gravity Falls where my Grunkle Ford lived. I’ve seen most of the creatures recorded in his research. I mean, my first introduction to the weirdness of Gravity Falls is a bunch of gnomes tried to kidnap my sister and make her their queen.”
Meeting him for the second time, I couldn’t help but notice how attractive he was. Without the trench coat, I could see he had a slim build like me with toned arms and rather nice legs. He was pale like he didn’t go out in the sunlight a lot and had messy curly black hair and intelligent-looking light blue eyes. He was wearing a dark purple button-up with the sleeves rolled up and black slacks with what looked like expensive black dress shoes. I mentally slapped myself for pulling a Mabel finding that ever since I had come out as gay at sixteen, I found myself analyzing every semi-attractive guy that graced my presence like I was still some thirsty sixteen-year-old high schooler.
I looked down at Bills crotch and asked: “So are you male, or is that what you just told Mabel to make it easier on her.”
John gave him a skeptical look and said: “Sherlock, there is no case so far the boy is mentally ill and is reiterating a lunatic’s story in hopes of coping with his sister’s disappearance.”
Suddenly everything around me slowed to a stop, and the environment took on a pale muted pink color when I found myself pinned to the patrol car by a full demon Theo who smiled devilishly “Now I am having second thoughts about letting William have you cause now you have presented yourself as my type…the mouthy twink.”
That did explain why Bill was back though I asked: “So from your perspective, is he a threat anymore?”
“Is there anything else you can tell us about Bill? I don’t care how wild or unbelievable it is because, after yesterday, I am willing to believe anything if we can see your sister home safely?” John said like a soldier on a mission.
Sherlock’s eyes lit up in excitement as his face stayed impressively passive as he said “Fair enough I’m positive Dipper and his uncle would rather not have this public, and if we do discover the unknown I would like to keep my discoveries to myself, so I’m not hounded by nonbeliever and idiots who want to call my character into question seeing as I have no obligation to disclose my finding to anyone especially ignorant people demanding I show proof that reality is nothing but an illusion.”
I already didn’t like this guy with the condescending way he talked to Sherlock but kept quiet as not to start an argument in public with a stranger who was already getting on my nerves.
I growled and slapped him making him whimper “Look let me be honest with you I think you know more about my sister disappearance, the salesman story while true is only half true and I think you’re either cause or a factor in why someone took her seeing as my family and you are connected, and it's awful fucking convenient your statue is in London at the same time as my sister, and you come back from the dead or void or whatever just in time to be taken in like an abandoned kitten then my sis up and vanishes causing you to send me a postcard cause you know I am the only one who will consider your story seeing as Grunkle Stan or Ford would kill you on sight.”
John chuckled lightly, “I can still recall first moving in with Sherlock Mycroft stalked me and offered me large sums of money for information on Sherlock as a test to see how loyal I was to him. He means well about twenty-five percent of the time I’m still not sure about the other seventy five percent.”
The bookstore owner chewed on his fingernail “I don’t know how much this helps, but he told the girl to follow him he needed to check something out at the London Art Museum though I am pretty sure by now you have probably missed them unless he’s going there leisurely though nothing about that guy or his presence screams fun and relaxing.”
John looked at both of us and asked: “Did anyone happen to hear Mycroft’s bodyguard’s last name by chance?”
Sherlock straightened up and sighed, “A girl’s life is at stake John besides there is no such thing a real or false monster. If you commit heinous acts, you are a monster regardless of your species. I know you have dealt with plenty of demons as a soldier. The only difference these demons are not of this world. I will have to say you utterly disappointing for a soldier if you walk away now out of something as trivial as fear.”
I looked over at Sherlock, who held a passive, bored expression, but in his sharp icy blue eyes was a dim gleam of curiosity that quickly extinguished itself when I looked at him, but there was no mistaking he was possibly slightly curious about this and was determined not to show it outwardly.
I considered telling them about last night, but a feeling inside me kept me from saying anything. If Bill had indeed sent the postcard, then he was only interested in me and getting Sherlock and John involved with this while I was still unsure of Bill’s new demeanor, or motives just seemed reckless.
I woke up in the guest bed and sat up, looking around, feeling groggy like I just had the most uncomfortable dream in the world. Not necessarily a nightmare, but I felt a shiver roll through me at recollecting last night and walked out to the living room, inhaling the air finding all I could smell was the flowers and feminine scent of my sister the flat devoid of the noxious cinnamon smell that permeated the apartment last night. I got dressed and had a cup of tea from the cupboard to at least get some caffeine since Mabel had zero coffee in her flat, not liking it, and looked at my cell I had set on the counter last night, finding three messages on it. One from Grunkle Ford who thanked me for the update, one from Pacifica who was having a panic attack that Mabel hadn’t called her back in a week and one from Sherlock who asked how soon I could be ready for breakfast. I responded to Pacifica telling her to calm down and spinning a little white lie that Mabel had broken her phone and was still over in England, and I was with her before responding to Sherlock telling him I would be out in ten only to get a prompt response telling me to meet him at the address in his text message. I finished the last dregs of my tea and got dressed grabbing my hat when I stopped getting weird feeling passing Mabel’s room stopping at the door looking at the doorknob as I slowly reached out for it before my hand stopped inches from the knob and I for some reason decided not to intrude on my sisters room and walked past the door the off feeling still there but I pushed it aside out of respect for my sisters privacy finding at the moment there was no reason to invade it. I made my way out of the complex and looked at my phone again putting the address in a mapping app on my phone finding it was a small diner not far from Baker Street and walked in the direction the app pointed until I made it to the front of the shop and walked in instantly picking out John and Sherlock sitting in a booth when John looked up and waved me over.
Sherlock gave a curt nod and turned to walk out of the building John sighing and following after him. I grabbed my suitcase and ascended the step in hopes this was all a big misunderstanding, and Mabel was perfectly fine, but several factors told me this was wishful thinking, and when mysterious shit happened around a Pines, you can bet things were anything but fine.
The next hour was the most uncomfortable hour of my life as I started from the beginning with Grunkle Ford encounter with Bill and came to the conclusion of the story with his defeat and my Grunkle Stan’s sacrifice as I reiterated he has been dead for seven years due how we defeated him and why it was crazy he would be back now.
I snorted, “Well, that explains a lot about his character. He works for the government. Therefore, he thinks he is better than everyone. Sounds like most people with government jobs in America in a nutshell.”
I thought for a second going over Theodore’s hints before facepalming and groaning, “Either I am stupid, or this was too ironic even to consider, but you’re his twin brother aren’t you?”
Sherlock turned the computer to show a database file showing the same man we saw with Mycroft today and said “It says his full name is Theodore Spherius Cipher and that he’s twenty-five and a police prodigy from Ireland who was transferred here on a request funny thing is I just messaged Lestrade who said he has never heard of this man and told me they hadn’t received a single new transfer to the Scotland Yard or as you know the police for about three years. I also hacked into the police database in the town in Ireland Theodore transferred from, and as I thought no record of a Theodore Spherius Cipher to be found leading me to believe our little friend is possibly Bill or another inhuman trickster like him.”
Sherlock mused at the picture “We found images of your sister and this man on several street cameras as well as several shop surveillance cameras, but he never seems to show up on any of our complexes cameras I asked Ms. Hudson if I could review them this morning and strangely the footage from the night of your sister apartment break-in never showed a disturbance either. What makes me curious is this man bears a striking resemblance to the intruder we believe to be Bill only problem is this man is one hundred percent human-looking and is wearing a blue, not yellow trench coat and a plain black top hat whereas our visitor had a yellow rose on his according to Ms. Hudson. Did your sister say anything about having a lover or a friend here or perhaps someone she had grown close to in college.”
Ms. Hudson quietly said, “He vanished before they got here, which is odd because I would have seen him go out the door, so I assume he escaped via the window. He must have realized he had been seen or had good timing. Though I did hear him speak a little, he kept repeating something over and over again.”
I smiled and replied, “Something that throws logic out the window John and I dare say challenge accepted.”
Sherlock seemed unfazed by John’s argument and merely said “A lunatic’s story told with that much discomfort, and visible pain must have some shred of truth, and it piqued my interest, so I am determined to find out if the boy’s mad or if logic and reality are not all there cracked up to be and if I’m disappointed oh well John I have been disappointed by many cases before. Besides there already is a shred of truth to his story look at his arms he said this Bill Cipher creature stole his body and abused him by puncturing his arms with forks well I see several scars that look suspiciously like fork tine holes and I don’t think with how well he functions now after a mere seven years after the incident that he was ever in state of mind so bad to stab himself several times in the arm with a fork. I have never believed in something as ludicrous as magic, but then again, I have never faced a situation where logic and the fabric of reality get called into question so boldly. Don’t you find it the least bit odd that his story comes up right after Ms. Hudson saw that suspicious man in Mabel Pines flat coupled with the boy saying demons do indeed exist and Ms. Hudson’s vivid description of this man? Aren’t you just the least bit curious to see if all these incidents have something in common? The past never truly dies John, and maybe Dipper’s past is coming back for an encore.”
I quickly explained, “It’s a nickname I’ve had since I was a kid. It just stuck throughout my life. My real name is Mason, but I prefer Dipper since the only time someone calls me Mason is when I’ve done something stupid.”
John gave me a frightened, slightly offended look and snapped “If anything stirred, it was probably me pissing myself due to everything that just happened now what the ever-loving fuck was that thing?”
He held out his hand, which I shook, finding his handshake gentler than Sherlock’s and said, “Dipper Pines, sir.”
Sherlock didn’t seem fazed by the man’s attitude with him like he could care less or was used to it and said: “I don’t understand your neurotic need to bathe when honestly John you didn’t smell offensive or appear soiled.”
Bill looked like he was trying to argue, and then went back to opening his chocolate “Okay, fair point….”
Sherlock developed a small smile from where I could see him behind the laptop and said, “Good answer. You have no idea how many lazy foreigners, in general, would have made John conform to their speech its kids like you that restore some of my faith in humanity and a little in your generation.”
Before I could answer, Sherlock cut in and said, “They are twins, John. He is here for his sister out of some nature of concern.”
Again this man was fucking creepy, but like always, he was correct, making me respond. “I figured someone had taken her, and I have a theory who did it but no certainties though I know where I think I should start looking.”
The man named John rolled his eyes at Sherlock and said: “Some of us pride ourselves in consistent hygiene.”
I must have looked confused why he knew I was foreign and he smiled and said “Dear boy if I am correct in assuming you are related to Dr. Stanford Filbrick Pines then it’s obvious you’re not from around here and judging by you expression at the mention of that name he is indeed family also one of my favorite physicists to read about and one of the most articulate and well-spoken men I have had the pleasure of researching…until he started his ridiculous theories that the supernatural was indeed real and all this nonsense about interdimensional travel like he had done it or found ways to go about it. Sad to see a bright man fall from glory. Oh well, I guess all I have to hold onto now is his real research.”
Lestrade looked at my birthmark close up, making me feel the old self-consciousness rising back up when he chuckled “That’s a nifty birthmark, not sure I would want it on my head, but I bet it would make a great conversation piece.”
John looked worried as the young man headed to the door and asked: “Is it a good idea you sleep in that flat alone? I mean, especially with everything that seems to be happening today?”
Bill said softly, “Yeah, well, this time is different Dipper, I aim to protect you, not harm you Shootingstar would be pissed if she took me in, and I let her brother get hurt having the means to protect him. I don’t care if you hate me or don’t want me watching out for you because I’m going to anyway I owe to you what I should have done for your sister so honestly Pinetree you can kiss my black ass if you think you’re getting rid of me that easily.”
I lifted an eyebrow, “Not that I recall I never really analyzed the statue nobody had the nerve to touch it after Weirdmageddon.”
I swallowed hard and pulled the postcard out of my jacket pocket and started explaining “My twin sister Mabel Pines was a college student here in London studying performing arts as well as a side study of fashion she would have graduated last month and then informed us she would be taking a small vacation here to see the sights now that school was no longer in the way, but a couple of days ago I received his postcard and had to make arrangements to come here. I was hoping it was all a misunderstanding, and she was fine with how vague the postcard was, but honestly, I should know better whenever a Pines gets wrapped up in a strange situation like this. It’s safe to assume things are anything but fine.”
He nodded and left coming back ten minutes later, his face cleaned up and bruised with a small suitcase and set to work. I watched him apply a ring of shiny thread around the flat as well as something that looked like a moonstone and taped odd symbol to the wall written on paper and drawn in his blood.
I couldn’t help but chuckle, knowing Mabel was pretty chill with eccentric people having grown up around Grunkle Ford’s odd hobbies and world views. Ms. Hudson walked out gently, closing the door behind her as I waved my smile in place until the door clicked, making it fall into a troubled frown as I got up and paced around the flat, shaking my head at one ridiculous idea after another but always coming back to the same theory. The description she gave me couldn’t be him, but at the same time, the aesthetics of the creature fit him. The yellow and black color scheme, the presence of gold in his appearance, and of course, no other being could be muttering the nickname Shootingstar while skulking around my sister's flat. But why he has been gone for seven years, not a single sign of him to was found outside the stone statue in the Gravity Falls forest. Then my eyes widened Soos had gotten Ford's permission to sell the stone horror to a British art collector in London who worked for a museum Mabel visited. She even sent me a Snapchat photo telling me no matter how much they spruce that nightmare rock up, she will never view it as anything close to art. My theory fell on maybe disturbing his statue caused him to come back, but why take such a human form was he up to something different this time? He had to be the reason Mabel disappeared. There was no other option, but to assume he did it and sent the postcard to capture me too. I was gazing out the window looking down at the street when a hand touched my shoulder, startling me, causing me to whip around and hit the person square in the nose, knocking them to the ground. When I managed to calm the start of an anxiety attack, I looked down to see Sherlock clutching his nose, which was pouring blood. His eyes narrowed no doubt in pain, so I ran into the kitchen and found a towel and hurried back out, handing him the cloth, which he put to his nose.
Sherlock gave me a small smirk and said, “I guess we can’t help you then. I like to know all the details before taking a case.”
I glared down at the image equal parts pissed and worried that this had only popped up a couple of hours ago, meaning it was looking more likely someone had kidnaped Mabel, and now we had a minor lead on the bastard. I sat there sipping my coffee as the two detectives looked at me John had a rather paternal look on his face while Sherlock’s emotion was as always limited to his eyes when John reached out a gently touched my shoulder just how Grunkle Ford would when he could see I was thinking too hard.
Sherlock looked up and said flatly as usual “Ah, you made it I ordered you some coffee since I doubt your sister had any in her flat with her apparent disdain for the drink since John had offered her some during one of her visits and she had rather…strong opinions on your caffeine intake.”
“Hey, Bill, do you have any relation to a Theodore Spherius Cipher by any chance,” I asked, hoping he could shed some light on the albino demon.
221 Baker Street loomed over me ominously even with how nice it looked I couldn’t help but think this place was the beginning of a complicated situation. However, I opened the door and walked in, looking around when I slammed right into a tall man in a black trench coat and fell to the ground grunting in pain. I looked up to find myself staring into a pair of some of the coldest looking blue eyes I had ever seen but was surprised when he held out his hand and helped me to my feet. We found ourselves caught in a mutual starting contest, the tall, pale man looking like he was trying to figure out what to make of me, inevitably causing my anxiety to start to act up. When he seemed satisfied with his analysis, he continued towards the door I had just come through.
Sherlock looked like he was thinking, “Perhaps he thinks he can pick off problem numbers one and two by utilizing problem number four. Perhaps he thinks by using your sister as bait you and your great uncle’s attention will get drawn to this oddity in his methods, and he can make you both walk into a trap together after your thrown off guard. Like they say two birds with one stone. My one question is why are you a problem to him if I’m correct in assuming your only what eighteen or nineteen years old you would have been barely a teen seven years ago I can see your great uncle being a problem as an adult but what serious problem would a child pose to someone twisted enough to kidnap a college girl.”
Theo just gave a small smile, “Noted. Also note this Bill will only “molest” someone if he thinks they want it. Don’t encourage him, and he remains docile. Happy now, I gave you an evasion tactic not that I expect it to work since most men rarely can resist the sultry, seductive nature of my brother.”
Theo grinned like the Cheshire cat showing pointy teeth and his eerie black and emerald eyes, “And what would be the fun it that my little fawn?”
He turned to keep walking so I followed him as we entered a cluttered flat where John was sitting typing on a laptop which Sherlock closed causing John to groan in annoyance as he directed me towards a chair between two armchairs making John lift an eyebrow and look at me with a questionable looking on his face before giving Sherlock the same if not slightly irritated questionable look.
Theodore nodded, and they proceeded to walk away, leaving me fuming when Sherlock said, “Ignore him I have read all of Stanford Pines’s research regardless of his topics the quality of it has never changed. Even his more fantastical studies are worthy of reading why do you think science fiction has survived this long Dipper? Because it is a promise of a great future and the ability to preserve our species even longer. So what if my brother thinks his research is nonsense to be quite honest every piece of science was nonsense at one point until someone became motivated enough to stop listening to others and press forward as a pioneer of things we take for granted today. I, for one, would be fascinated to see another world because this one is getting boring and predictable, and I am only in my thirties. Dr. Pines presents me with the hope of something more in the future, so let the old man research the nonsensical because one man’s nonsense is another man’s relief from the mind numbing boredom of everyday life.”
I looked at Sherlock as he looked ahead at the still studiously walking John his pale blue eye shining with a unusual emotion and said: “If you confess and he reciprocates nothing should change if all you two want is for the other to be happy whatever way that may be beside your relationship doesn’t have to make sense to anyone but you two so if yes you’re in a romantic relationship it doesn’t have to be one of those grossly affectionate ones, and neither of you has to be the doting chivalrous boyfriend you just have to help each other as you do now no more no less.”
A shiver rippled through Bill, and he said in a small voice, “Yeah, I know. I know that I am going to be paying you in blood, sweat, tears, and pieces of my soul until the end of days to make up for what I’ve done.”
Theodore laughed. “Oh child, you don’t want to challenge me to a sword fight, and I don’t want to have to kill you or anybody in this room.”
I figured I would bounce between names as the situation demanded it when Lestrade asked: “So were your parents like hippies or something?”
Sherlock chuckled prompting me to look at him as he said: “You’re the first person who has ever had the nerve to say how much of an unpleasant person my brother is most people won’t even call his character into question in private cause of their paranoia of my brother working for the British government or in some peoples opinion
Dipper surveyed his work and said casually, “Unicorn hair. We had to get more of it last summer, all my sister had to do was go threaten them, and they forked more over their kinda terrified of her ever since the summer of Weirdmageddon.”
“There is no sense in getting angry at something that already lost to you instead feel smug that a god-like creature lost to a twelve-year-old child.” He said in a soft, reassuring way.
He grabbed Mycroft and slung him over his shoulder with ease and tipped his hat, “I bid you gentlemen farewell.”
My jaw tightened at him shaming Grunkle Ford’s research he finally got the nerve to publish upon our insistence but again kept my mouth shut so I wouldn’t embarrass Sherlock by calling his older brother every unflattering intellectually demeaning name in the book as he turned and said: “Come along Theodore I have other stops to make before we head home.”
I looked back as Sherlock, who was still talking to Lestrade before asking Theo, “So what do I do about Bill? I mean, I know he’s in my sister's flat hiding somewhere, but I don’t think he wants to talk to me right now.”
“I’m sorry for attacking you with the sword the other day. However, just because I know you aren’t that gold lunatic doesn’t mean I trust you any more than I do him.” I said to the albino man who smiled his round face looking welcoming despite his true nature.
Theo raised an eyebrow. “Oh, my little tsundere, now I see why you’re going to fail at resisting him. You’re his favorite type. The virgin in denial.”
I lifted an eyebrow in  confused manner as he elaborated “You know your name “Dipper” only reason I can think they would name a kid that is having something to do with astrology we had an officer a couple of years back whose parents were major hippies and named him Orion cause it was “mystical” or some weird thing like that we just called him Ryan because he kept getting called “space cadet” to the point he about almost threw his resignation papers at me if I didn’t do anything.”
“You three are extremely annoying when it comes to listening to directions.” He hissed as the air in the flat seemed to get colder than it should be even for October.
Mycroft responded, “Oh, he is not my secretary. He is my bodyguard. Theodore, this is my baby brother Sherlock. Sherlock this is Theodore Cipher, a young cop who was stationed in Ireland for a while and got bored. He was being given pitiful unfulfilling tasks far below his pay grade. He is in the process of relocating to London as a change of scenery and job quality. By the way, I can’t help but notice the young man hovering behind you, I don’t recall seeing him before or ever heard of you taking clients on the case.”
Sherlock was quickly typing on the laptop and said, “And people wonder why I live in a two-bedroom flat and solve crimes for fun. In my opinion, slow and steady wins the race, and trust me life is the ultimate race.”
Sherlock waved his hand at me. “His name is Dipper Pines. He is a special case, and I require his assistance.”
Dipper stood back up and said, “I think I am gonna go unpack and make dinner I need some time to wind down and I am gonna call Grunkle Ford and give him a half-ass report letting him know I have police trusted help though I am gonna leave all the supernatural events out for now as not to worry him with no way of getting here.”
He grasped my hand firmly and said: “Call me Sherlock you have no idea how much I hate when people get formal with me and might I inquire about your unusual name I mean it’s obvious you’re American, but even Americans can’t be that cruel to their children to give them a name like yours.”
I glared him and said, “You’re not fucking going anywhere if that what you're planning. I still have questions that need answers.”
Ms. Hudson developed a worried look and said, “Now that you mention it, there were a couple of peculiarities that I happened to overlook and one incident that gave me a bit of a fright. The peculiar thing was your sister stopped joining me for breakfast almost a week ago and paid three months of rent in advance, which was odd with how she budgeted her money. But the frightening thing happened almost two nights ago…”
Dipper looked back with a smile that was equal parts confident and cocky, saying, “I got a couple tricks up my sleeve that should protect me. If you guys want, I can safeguard your flat too. I should have enough supplies, I mean, I never travel unprepared.”
I sipped the hot cup of coffee, finding it waking me up faster when Sherlock pulled out a file and the stack of papers in the manila folder saying, “We might have some clues that I discovered this morning while looking for any leads or proof of your sister's kidnapping.”
John and I exchanged concerned looks while Sherlock asked one more question, “Any idea where they were heading next?”
Suddenly a voice behind us said, “No, that attitude gets reserved for my health provider or the moron that said I needed psychiatric help concerning my recent stress levels.”
Sherlock snarked back, “Who’s your new secretary I don’t seem to recall you firing Lesley when I was forcefully drug in last?”
He turned to face me his mouth slightly turned downward making his once neutral expression take on a hint of suspicion “A young woman in the flat next to mine was handing out hand-knitted clothing I happen to refuse causing her to be stubborn and insist I accept a hand-knitted scarf when she made the observation mine was “falling apart at the seams” and it was hard to deny the quality of her knitting as well as get my flatmate to discontinue telling me how “rude” I was to the young lady, so I accepted it out of a gesture of politeness.”
The possessed man looked at me. “I am far worse than William, and unlike him, I won’t get outsmarted by a bunch of fleshworms I have part of what I need, I suggest you don’t interfere.”
Ms. Hudson developed and anxiety-filled expression and said hesitantly, “Well, here’s where the police thought I was crazy I described him as a nearly seven-foot man maybe a couple of inches shorter with wide shoulders and black as night skin and blue looking hair in a neatly messed fashion. He was wearing a dark yellow trench coat and a white dress shirt, black suit vest, black slacks, and chunky looking motorcycle boots. Resting on his head was a top hat with a yellow rose on it. However, he was far from a normal man. He had what looked like ram horns spiraling from his head, and his one eye seemed to give off a strange gold light while the other one was covered.”
I shrugged and finished my coffee. “Hey, gives me something to do today instead of sitting in my sister’s flat banging my head against the wall in worry.”
The knowledge that the supernatural was real and had been standing right in front of me was all so FASCINATING I just had to know more and went to ask more when John cut me off and said: “Sherlock let him leave you two can talk tomorrow I’m sure he wants to go rest after today.”
Bill seemed different a far cry from the boastful, proud, and obnoxious demon I had met in my youth, and I was hard-pressed to believe he was faking all this, especially if he had been living with Mabel for a while and never harmed her. It was also getting harder to believe he was responsible for Mabel’s disappearance, but if he wasn’t, who was?
Without missing a beat, Sherlock said: “It a nickname kinda like how dad always called you Scooter, but his nickname is less embarrassing and ridiculous-sounding.”
Theodore just gave me a small smirk. “You have seen William’s face and my real face, and you know we share a last name, meaning we are closely enough related to be doing so. Why don’t you guess, little Starlord.”
He started kissing and licking my neck his large thin hands gripping my hips firmly as he purred “I bet you would love nothing more than for me to kiss that pretty pale ass of yours I bet you would make lovely noises if I just bent you over this car hood and devoured that plush ass of yours this minute and beauty of it is no one would be any wiser it would be our secret.”
John looked curious and said, “The way you said that it makes it seem your family is common for finding itself at the center of dangerous situations. Does anyone in your family have ties to a person who would know of Mabel’s presence here and would be keen on harming her to harm another family member of yours?”
I looked at him like a confused fawn prompting him to continue, “You seem to have no problem prolonging long awkward silences, whereas your sister could not stand to keep conversation dormant for longer than a minute or so. One would assume she had confidence in herself and her social skills, where you have little to none. When we first met, you already seem to withdraw where your sister jumped right into a conversation with John and me asking us millions of questions like she’d taken a stimulant. I can only deduce you have anxiety on top of low self-esteem, making it that much harder to assert yourself in a social situation, especially with a stranger in a foreign country. Had I not approached you, one would assume it would be days before you worked up even a scrap of courage to talk to John or I while you floundered in your confusion of where to start looking for your missing sister who is not only missing but from my professional standpoint has indeed been kidnapped.”
I snarled at him and grabbed the front of his shirt and shook him a little “My sister is missing you gold prick I don’t have time for you to deal with your fucking existential crisis you’re having right now when your presence may have put my sister in danger find yourself later you need to help me fix this or I swear to a god I don’t believe in that what my grunkle’s did to you seven years ago will look merciful compared to what I will do to you in the next five seconds if you don’t start nodding and agreeing to fix the mess you’re probably responsible for.”
Bill curled his fingers around my hand and pulled it to his mouth, kissing it softly, making my face heat up. Why did the guy who fucked up my head (however unintentional) have to put my hormones through ringer now? Bill smiled at me, which to me looked more like a smirk and kissed my hand a couple more times, even kissing the palm when he ran the tip of his tongue over my fingers, making me jerk my hand away feeling slightly toasty all over as I nervously coughed.
Theo looked like he was thinking “To be honest I haven’t gotten close enough to him to feel him out totally, but from what I do know he is not the same as he was 40 years ago I sense less darkness and more internalized negativity somewhat similar to what you humans call depression.”
Sherlock looked passive like he was thinking, but John looked utterly weirded out, and his face held not an ounce of belief in my story as he asked, “How many drugs was your uncle taking? Dipper, this sound without a doubt like you were sick and hallucinating after being exposed to a man who was mental and dangerous. There are no such thing demons. The apocalypse is just theory if you can even call it that.”
Sherlock had pulled himself into a chair and managed to stop the bleeding as he said, “I see. I shall note that too to avoid getting hit again in the future.”
My blood flowed like ice through my veins. It couldn’t be. It just couldn’t. Was Bill seriously alive? I looked in the mirror facing the living room to see a shadowy man sitting in the armchair looking over a stack of files the only defining things about him was his glowing wheat gold eye narrowed in annoyance, the contrast of his pearly white sharp teeth against the shadows that seemed to make up his form, the glowing teacup he drank out of while reading and what I could only assume was a lit cigarette with a bright blue ember he would take a drag on before situating it in a floating ashtray.
I couldn’t help smiling to myself knowing exactly which “old guy” they talked money with since Ford wouldn’t be super picky on the price. Lestrade let us under the tape before finally noticing me following Sherlock.
I shrugged, “A lot of things. You both care about each other more than I would assume two heterosexual men to care and you both seemed to have dynamic where you tolerate each other flaws no matter what and in a way seem to make up for what the other lacks like John’s not genius but provides emotional support to make your investigating go more smoothly by relaxing someone into dropping their guard so you can get info. I also notice you two are rarely apart and John has that good-natured annoyed boyfriend attitude similar to the one I see my uncle's boyfriend take with him I mean it took Fidds and Grunkle Ford almost three years to stop beating around the bush and come to terms with their feelings for each other. Honestly, even though you’re not dating, there is a spark there as my sister would say it depends who tells who first or if you or John is even into men.”
I looked down at the unconscious man and said: “Don’t know but Bill caused your eyes to turn gold not sapphire, and Theo was sporting an emerald aesthetic, so I don’t think it was him since we know he is currently with Mycroft so as much as I don’t want to admit it we are dealing with completely new demon.”
I turned around to see a well-dressed man approaching us, followed by a tall albino guy in a bowler hat and dark green overcoat. Sherlock’s face twitched in annoyance as he stood in a rigid stance his hand clasped together in a tight grip.
Theodore held his finger to his lips frowning as if telling me to shut up and Mycroft’s face spasmed like it couldn’t decide whether to laugh or frown his eyes taking on a slight emerald green tint around the outside of the iris while said irises seemed to elongate slightly which Sherlock also noticed and spoke up “Brother that thing is manipulating you into doing it bidding due to your position. You need to break its control over you before it makes you do something irreversible and damaging.”
Bill gave an annoyed sigh as if remembering the day and said: “A bunch of shit none of it having any correlation to the previous product like first he tried to sell her this loose leaf tea, which she refused asking him politely to leave when he tried to hock her this pretty sapphire jewelry which she of course refuse and asked him more firmly to leave reminding him of the no soliciting sign so in a last-ditch effort to get her to buy something he stupidly hocked a pretty black violin only for Mabel to slam the door on his face and call the landlady telling her there was a salesman in the building harassing her, but when the landlady showed up, he appeared long gone.”
Bill chuckled. “Well, Dipper, I'm not the one questioning someone gender here. I mean, I know I’m pretty and queer, but even a blind man could see I am a dude.”
I frowned and leaned back in my chair, sighing, “I suppose. Meet me at the little coffee shop about a block from here for breakfast.”
He seated himself across from Sherlock and smiled, saying, “From the looks of it, you appear to have a case Sherlock deems worthy of solving.”
I crossed my arms and looked away “I have no interest in Bill I would rather peel my skin off with a disposable razor than let him touch me.”
He turned to leave when another voice was heard from the stairs yelling, “Sherlock, I told you to wait!”
Bill hissed back “Stop acting like your uncle Pinetree and thinking you’re entitled to answers if you really must know she had to force me to live with her I kept telling her I was okay and only gave up when she threatened to camp on the street with me until I stop “being so proud” as she put it and who knows plenty of people hate me that could have easily noticed I developed a friendship with Mabel who unless your saying is stupid I think she knew who I was but was willing to keep an eye on me with my change in demeanor. As for the salesman, I believe he was cursed or had magic on him making him hard to track or malleable to suggestions, but from what or who you got me there Dipper like I said I’m a fucking genius, not a seer I am not always all seeing only ever observant, and if you really must know about Theodore fine we are family, but that’s all I’m telling you plus he’s dangerous and can be morally gray sometimes so take everything he says and does with a grain of salt. I only owe you answers on our history and maybe on what started the ball rolling in the first place, but my own life story is none of your business if you only seek to use it against me and with your attitude right now you’ll use anything I tell you as ammo to blow holes in any progress I have made towards being better than I have for the last ten centuries. You have no idea why I was evil, and to be honest neither do I, but something is telling me I might find answers here in London I don’t know why, but it’s just a feeling, and usually my intuition gets me something even if it’s not reliable answers.”
Lestrade looked up, not in the least bit surprised to see Sherlock walking up to him and sighed “Some asshole got into the museum and smashed that creepy new exhibit the curator found the mess this morning and called us.”
Sherlock looked at me and asked, “I would like to hear more about this mysterious villain from your past and how he ties into the events of now.”
I watched him as he was about to toss the chocolate into the maw his eye turned into when he looked at me and sighed before changing into his human form and throwing it into his shark-like mouth rolling it around in his mouth instead of chewing it. He then poured himself a cup of tea and sipped on it, watching me over the rim of his cup. Looking at him, he appeared to have changed his clothes now wearing a mustard yellow turtleneck and black denim jeans with shiny wedge heel boots his shaggy blue hair held back in a fluffy ponytail. He looked young too, maybe around mid-twenties or his early thirties, then again, I wouldn’t doubt his youthful appearance was supposed to put me at ease. He still looked tired though the dark circles under his eyes, having a blue tint to them. He took another chocolate and unwrapped it curling his long silver tongue around it and pulled it in his mouth, sucking on it like the last one.
I looked down and said, “Well ya see I’m looking for her she’s my sister and was supposed to come home a day or two ago, but I got this weird postcard telling me to come to this exact address like she was in trouble and I was wondering if you knew anything about her whereabouts.”
John rolled his eyes “You two are literally from the same generation Sherlock he’s only about twelve to thirteen years younger than you stop trying to sound ancient at thirty-one years old.”
It was possible, and even John had no explanation for these glaring inconsistencies in Theodore’s character or Mycroft’s introduction of him, who had to know as a prominent government official that the man he hired to protect him was lying horribly to him.
He gave a soft chuckle, “You’re used to my Geo Form a form I take to amplify my magic. While coked out on the darkness, I had no say in showing my natural form, so all you saw was triangle me, but now I have my mind in working order again I can be in a comfortable form for once.”
Before Sherlock could get too far, the shop keeper grabbed his sleeve, and we all looked back to see his eyes were sapphire blue cats eyes, and he said in a flat voice “Don’t even bother detective we are long gone I would cease your search while you're still breathing.”
Sherlock spoke up and said, “John Americans call them “sweaters” and “jumpers” are often to them one-piece outfits kinda like their criminals would wear. I called his sister's knitted goods sweaters because of this very reason. I am familiar with enough Americanized English to understand any different terminology he uses, like how Americans refer to trousers as pants, and our primary and secondary school often gets called elementary and high school in their country. Americans have butchered the English language enough to manage to have put a slight speech barrier between them and us.”
I sighed in worry, “You think you could track the salesman maybe help me shake him down, see if he knows anything?
The shop keeper looked at the photo frowning before saying, “Thought there was something dodgy about him. Yeah, both of them came into the shop again about three hours ago. The man was looking for a specific book dated back to the witch trials said he was enthusiast when it came to books on magic rituals and the likes. I told him we usually give them books to museums, not that any of us believe they contain real magic. We don’t like selling them to random people with the number of gullible nutcases who believe in summoning demons and spooky voodoo. As you can imagine he wasn’t particularly pleased and attempted to press me for whatever I might have in my possession while holding out a stack of cash that had to be no less than at least 20,000 pounds and of course you can imagine how tempted I was to take that price like a fat kid offered a chocolate-filled scone, but something felt off especially concerning the girl he had with him, she looked…uncomfortable to put it lightly. She looked tired too and was just unnaturally quiet and detached from her surroundings wouldn’t surprise me if this bloke kidnapped her. I’m just glad I didn’t sell to him since I got two books in the back that fall pretty well into the category of his search.”
He was talking about Mabel; she was the only one I knew that would hand out hand-knitted items to strangers as a way of getting to know her surroundings.
Sherlock sidled up beside me and said: “Odd, the perpetrator was able to destroy the statue without setting off alarms or alerting security guards.”
I nodded. “Yeah, I’ll talk to the landlady about it, and if she doesn’t know much, I’ll check in with you guys since you’re my only option besides the police, and I’ve never been one for police in another country. A long story concerning a misunderstanding on me and my family’s vacation to Ireland. My Grunkle Stan forgot to mention the police don’t exactly appreciate the last name Pines in Dublin.”
Billed sighed in return “Honestly something was off about that salesman cause I have tried tracking him but when he was at the door his presence was so weak he mines well have not been standing there in the first place so I doubt with an energy signature that weak I would be able to find him.”
Bill visibly flinched and choked on his tea, slopping some on his turtleneck and looked away with a massive amount of guilt in his eye that just seemed so alien for him.
I looked at the demon before moving closer and placing my hand on his knee, making him look down at it as I said, “But you’re working to fix your mistakes that right there should be a simple enough reason why you're allowed to breathe. You could have just run, but you're risking yourself for people who would honestly see you killed again. Maybe you should be given the benefit of the doubt starting with Mabel and me.”
As much as I tried to fight the pull of darkness, it held fast and dragged me under consuming me rapidly in a matter of mere minutes.
I felt horrible for punching a stranger in the nose even though he seemed to understand why I did it. I figured next time I would lock the door or pay more attention to my surroundings on the off chance he did knock, and I didn’t hear him.
Theo responded with a high pitch giggle and said: “That’s the glory of my position among humanity. I have every right to be.”
I blinked in a confused manner, not understanding how I knew that either or why my sentence came out way different than how I had planned to reply. Something felt off standing on the stairs. My old paranoia of being watched crept in, but I snapped back to focus when Sherlock said: “I wouldn’t doubt with all I have said you have probably heard of me online with how much kids like you are on the internet these days.”
Sherlock leaned back in the chair, holding the towel in interlaced fingers and said: “You’re quite the opposite from your sister.”
Theodore looked noticeably surprised but had no time to respond, seeing as Dipper came at him, keeping excellent footwork even in my cluttered flat and swiped at Theodore, who quickly blocked with a walking stick he pulled out of nowhere. He fought Dipper off with the walking stick as John, and I stayed out of their way John looking more frightened then I had ever seen him no doubt this being well beyond the strange events we usually encounter only this time the unknown becomes supernatural. The creature seemed to realize Dipper wasn’t giving up any time soon and lunged at him, giving out a fierce growl its appearance shifting making Dipper step back in surprise. What was now standing before us, to say the least, was quite beautiful and to be honest, was hard discern if it was genuinely male or female though judging by the flat chest and noticeable bulge in his trousers he was most likely just an unnaturally attractive demon usually how most demons are in literature. He stood at 6’10 with smooth white skin and bubblegum pink hair neatly styled around emerald ram horns his bright green eyes sat in a black backdrop that looked slightly eerie with his complexion. His ears were somewhat tapered, and his teeth sharp and deadly and appeared almost shark-like. His face held a conflicted expression as his hesitation allowed Dipper to recover from his surprise and swipe at the demon who didn’t block in time and received a long slice across the face causing him to reel back.
I headed up the stairs when I bumped yet again into someone who turned out to be a grandmotherly looking older woman and asked politely, “Excuse me, ma’am, do you know where I can find the landlady, Ms. Hudson?”
To a point, I could understand his need for warmth and contact with a living creature, but at the same time, I couldn’t help but ask, “But why have you been this way for a millennia?”
Mycroft said, still looking at me, said: “Theodore believe this investigation might pose a security risk a case he is working on and your friend as well, so I’m asking you to cease this job and for Mr. Pines to come with me.”
kidnapping. While it’s looking very probable filling the boys head with what-ifs from his past is not going to get us the answers we are looking for.”
Bill snorted, “Honestly Dipper there has never been a creature recorded in the whole multiverse that just existed out of nowhere everything in this entire multiverse has a creator, parent, guardian or whatever they came from and I honestly should be no exception.”
“So you're going to use it?” At Sherlock’s raised eyebrow, he huffed out a sigh and asked, “Would you like another drink?”
He glanced at his watch: just after midnight. Sherlock would still be awake. John could do it now, could tell him now. Suddenly nothing seemed more important.
Sherlock was looking from Mycroft to John and back again, glee lighting up his eyes. “Perhaps I should call down to room service for some popcorn.”
Sherlock’s mouth began to stretch into a smile. “Could have done it faster if I didn't have to keep texting you with false questions from Mummy.”
Sherlock bent his head and their lips met in a kiss that felt more like a promise than any words they'd yet spoken. The warm water ran freely over them both as they embraced under the spray, their kiss becoming less gentle, more fevered. John rolled his hips and as his half-hard cock rubbed against Sherlock’s, they both moaned. Sherlock tore his mouth away from John’s to breathe and John took the opportunity to lick up the side of his neck, and then traced the same path with a graze of teeth.
By way of answer, Sherlock guided John’s hands back to his hair and leaned forward until his lips nearly touched John’s cock, and then he slowly dropped his mouth open again.
This fic has the most amazing readers in the world. I've only gotten halfway through the comments (and will get to them all) and wanted to take a minute to say thank you for your fantastic comments, support, angst, and love.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Do you have any idea how long I've waited to have you in my mouth? You must.”
Whatever the rest of his sentence was, it was lost when John leaned down and crushed their mouths together. He took Sherlock’s words and kissed them back into his mouth over, and over, and after minutes or hours or a century had passed, he tightened his arms around Sherlock’s back and whispered them into his neck and still more tears were shed.
John swiped at his own stomach quickly and patted himself down with a towel before wetting the flannel again for Sherlock. He had to stop in the doorway for a moment, though, and just breathe. Sherlock had turned over onto his back, eyes closed, one arm bent under his head and the other flung out to the side. The lamplight cast him in low shadow, and he was so beautiful that it made John’s chest ache. He moved back to the bed and cleaned Sherlock gently, then tossed both flannel and towel over his shoulder to the floor before hesitating.
As Mycroft crossed the room to go, Sherlock reached out and caught his wrist in both hands. The brothers looked at one another for a long moment, and then Sherlock released him. Mycroft was out the door and halfway down the stairs before he murmured, “You’re welcome, Sherlock.”
He leaned down over Sherlock and took his mouth in a long, wet kiss, and then, bracing himself on his forearms, pulled almost all the way out before thrusting in again. When he was fully seated for the second time, Sherlock reached up and wound his arms around his neck, bringing their mouths back together and tangling their tongues sloppily. When John thrust again, Sherlock stroked his tongue along John’s at the same speed, and John growled low in his throat.
John shook his head. “Please don’t. He doesn’t want--this. Me. He’s made his choice, and after all I’ve done, the very least I can do is respect it.”
Mike Stamford settled back into his desk chair. “‘Course, John; it sounded urgent on the phone. What do you need?”
Sherlock could hear a little fear in John’s voice, and a little anger, and more than a little exasperation. He could, however, also hear love, and a willingness to listen. “You were going to take a holiday, I believe. A month’s travel.”
Sherlock kept his eyes straight ahead. That was, he realized, exactly what he expected. “Love always comes with an expectation of improvement.”
Mrs. Hudson thought the whole thing was hilarious and wonderful and had cleared a shelf in 221A to keep all the things people kept thrusting into Sherlock’s hands - tiny knitted versions of him and John; letters filled with theories on recent crimes; and, her absolute favorite, hand drawn pictures of the detective and his blogger. Sherlock pretended to hate it but secretly loved it. John pretended to hate it and absolutely had not tucked a small set of felt Sherlock and John dolls away in his top drawer.
that had been part of his daily life for so long now that he could hardly imagine a way to make it better. “I don’t know what to say. I don’t know how to do this.”
“I know what G2 is, Sherlock, but the idea that Maeve and Bertie used to be a part of it is preposterous. What did he do, keep bees for them? And Maeve has many skills, but spying isn't one of them.”
Greg grabbed Sherlock’s wrist and turned the screen toward himself. “What the--are you letting a sodding Magic 8-Ball tell you whether or not to solve this crime?”
“Indeed. Surely you must agree that there can be no downside from having neighbors who are trained in advanced weaponry and have exceptional baking skills.”
John rested his head back against his pillow, tilting his face up and staring at the ceiling. “There are definitely...things to consider. This--today--has been amazing, but I am still a little worried. That you might still decide that you can't trust me. Or that you might decide over the next day or week that I am--that this is--not worth the trouble. That it would be easier, and better for you, to go home and truly move on.”
“Oh, but we do. Wait until we get home, and I’ll show you the erotic stories they’re writing about us.”
Sherlock’s eyes went a little unfocused at that, and then he shook his head sharply and jumped to his feet. “If I ignore the posted speed limits, we can be back at the hotel in just over two hours.”
John’s heart sank. “That's not the same thing.” He swung his legs out of bed and stood up, reaching for his jeans and beginning to pull them on.
It was true that John had been avoiding his best friend, and he couldn't even come up with a good reason why. He would never be angry or upset that Sherlock had killed Mary (beaten John to it, really); she’d been seconds away from shooting John when Sherlock had found them and taken her out immediately with a gun he'd had in a drawer since Serbia. Sherlock had looked him over with frantic intensity, not believing John wasn't hurt until he'd thoroughly checked himself. John had just been reaching to pull him into a hug when the Met burst in, and then it had been a maelstrom of police and government agents and statements, and they'd been separated at some point. By the time John was finished, Mycroft’s men had already taken Sherlock back to Baker Street.
“This is where it all went wrong, Sherlock,” John said, and his voice was both forceful and tight. “Me, below. You, above. And a phone call. This is where it all went wrong.”
John turned his head so Sherlock could read the intent on his face. “No, because I know you'll be kneeling for me later.”
Greg snorted before lowering a glare over the rim of his glass at John. They drank in silence for a minute, neither willing to be the first to go deeper. John tried to focus on the rugby playing on the screen over Greg's shoulder, but the resentment and curiosity and frustration rolling off the older man in waves was both distracting and guilt-inducing. Finally he met the glare head-on.
“Left without your luggage this morning, did you?” John asked, setting it down inside the door. Sherlock looked at it without much surprise.
When Greg slid into the booth across from him, John drained the last of his first pint and signaled the waitress for a round for both of them. One glance told him that the DI already knew. Or suspected.
Molly sighed. “Because he’s my friend, Sherlock, and we text and email. He doesn’t complain a lot, but it’s not hard to figure out.”
“Not publicly, no.” He ran a hand restlessly along the back of his neck, the crease between his eyebrows growing deeper. “Mycroft became aware that he was updating it privately, and I’ve been reading it. He’s not really writing entries,” he assured her as she opened her mouth to protest, “he’s writing letters. To me. In common discourse you might call them...love letters.” His eyes slid to hers, and then away again. “I--they--make me feel unsettled.” When his hand began to rub at his neck again, she reached up and took it in both of hers.
. He shoved his nerves down, hard, and picked up the condom packet, tearing it open and rolling the condom on. They'd get tested, he knew, and he was pretty certain they were both clean, but for now, he was glad he'd brought them from London. His hands shook a little as he poured lube on his fingers, and he dropped the bottle back on the table as he reached down between them and pressed against Sherlock’s entrance.
Sherlock’s eyes were closed and his hands were fisted in his own curls, and his breath was coming in heavy pants. There was a flush spreading over his chest and a light sheen of sweat rising on his skin, and John’s heart slammed against the walls of his chest.
The giddiness was completely gone, now. The only thing left in Sherlock was a slow-building anxiety.
Books were neatly arranged on shelves. The reams of loose papers that were usually piled everywhere were gone. The desk where John used to sit, his laptop shoved in among notebooks and files and on one memorable occasion, a stuffed and mounted skunk wearing its own bowler hat, was completely clear. Sherlock’s violin case rested alone on the sitting room table; a deep russet throw was folded neatly over the back of the couch. The mantle displayed nothing but the skull. The chairs where John and Sherlock used to sit were gone, and in their places stood two unmatched but complimentary armchairs in deep shades of green.
“I'm quite good at deductions now,” John grinned. He expected a derisive laugh or, at the very least, a scoff in response, but instead, Sherlock leaned down and took his mouth again.
When he knocked, Mrs. Hudson answered the door. She tilted her face up so he could awkwardly buss her cheek, and then waved him into the front hall. “He’s upstairs, Inspector; you should just go on up. I’m sure he’ll be glad to see you.”
"Yes, well, the message sank in, okay? You don't need to worry about that. I won't be a problem for him much longer."
At Greg’s abrupt outburst from behind him, John looked away from the body they were crouched beside and swiveled to look. He barely concealed his eye roll as he turned his attention back to the inspection he’d been performing. He could hear Greg’s voice raised in the background, saying things like “They realize this is an actual murder, right?” and “Donovan, so help me, if one of them puts a finger over the tape…” and “What a fucking nightmare.”
Greg climbed the stairs slowly, wishing he was anywhere but there. It wasn't his place to interfere. Sherlock was an adult who had clearly made a choice, and if he was settled with that choice, who was Greg to do anything about it? He'd just reached the top when he turned and made to go back downstairs.
Sherlock snorted, but it was halfhearted. He knew Mycroft would understand immediately why the flat was clean, and why he'd been pleasant to Lestrade.  He didn't need to answer.
Mycroft was seated at a desk in one of the parlors at his house, and Sherlock idly observed that he was wearing a collared shirt and jumper rather than a suit and waistcoat. Sherlock hadn't known Mycroft owned anything that wasn't a suit; he'd been fairly certain his brother even slept in one. “Little brother. Doctor Watson. A happy new year to you both. I trust the Emerald Isle is still in one piece?”
Sherlock nodded, and John stroked under the hem of his vest for a moment before letting go. “Let’s indulge my mundane habits, shall we?”
As he waited at the bar for the third scotch he'd decided he now needed and the brandy the 8-Ball had chosen for Sherlock, his phone buzzed in his pocket.
Sherlock had nipped the tip of his finger, and as John met his gaze again, he widened his eyes in impatience.
John heard Sherlock pick up the cup and put it back down abruptly, followed by the sound of the stove clicking on. He waited until he heard a chair slide out from the table before folding the paper back to the article he'd read earlier, picking up his mostly empty cup, and joining Sherlock in the kitchen. He dropped the paper face-up between them as he set his cup down and sat down on the other side of the table. “Seen the paper yet, love?”
Sherlock wakes him in the middle of the night and though he is clumsy with the fastenings of his clothes, he is fully awake by the time their feet hit the pavement. It's 3:30 am and the thief has finally made a reappearance, and they are meeting Lestrade and his team at the museum to make the catch.
“Wanted to help.” There is a warmth stirring in John’s chest, brought to life by this man who planned an entire crazy jam packed day so that John wouldn't be hurt. He takes the last step to close the distance and carefully slides his arms around Sherlock’s waist, leaning his forehead against the taller man’s shoulder. “You did, Sherlock. You do. You do.”
John grimaced. “Technically, she killed him first.” He held up a hand when Greg’s eyes lifted to the ceiling. “Yeah, okay, you’re right. I haven’t been trying very hard.” He scrubbed his hands over his face, guilt washing over him, along with the familiar wave of
. Surely it is considered impolite to succumb to depressive thoughts when you have been offered oral sex. Cease them immediately.”
The third time they ended up sleeping together, John started to suspect something deliberate was going on.
There was a soft sigh, and then a lamp snapped on. Sherlock’s face was blank, but there was something about his eyes that didn't sit right with John. “Has something happened? Why are you sitting here in the dark?”
The response to this story has been gratifying and overwhelming and lovely. I am afraid things are not going to get any easier for our John anytime soon, but I would point you toward the eventual rating switch and the pairing as hints to where we might end up.
“Mmm,” Sherlock agreed. “That was many countries, but not many places within each. And no sightseeing.”
John cut him off, his tone level, firm, and colder than Sherlock had heard in a very long time. “Get. Your. Fucking. Brother. On. The. Fucking. Phone.”
Sherlock swallowed, and then looked down at John’s chest. “Are you certain?” He asked, very quietly.
“Oh, you can’t deduce with the eyes in the back of your head, or the scent on the air?” John grinned as Sherlock wrinkled his nose.
Greg nodded, closing his mouth as he moved to sit at the table. Sherlock busied himself at the counter, filling another mug from the kettle and dropping a diffuser of loose tea into the water. He set it before Greg and then placed the sugar bowl on the table between them before sliding gracefully into the chair across from him. Greg cupped his hands around the mug, waiting for the tea to steep, and looked across the table at Sherlock.
An elbow struck him sharply in the side, cutting off his question. “It’ll be good for a laugh,” John murmured. “Also: don’t be a dick.”
Three days passed and Sherlock had embraced the Magic 8-Ball as the Decider of All Things. Sometimes this was terrific, and John kicked his feet up while Sherlock cooked dinner and hoovered the carpet. The 8-Ball had been responsible for a mind-blowing shower blow job for John and an afternoon where he let the 8-Ball decide when Sherlock could come--a long afternoon, as the 8-Ball kept turning up
He wakes in his room at Baker Street on this insignificant Tuesday and realizes gratefully that there had been no nightmares. He dresses for the guest lecturer position Mike had gotten him at Bart’s. When he finds the flat empty he eats his toast, drinks his tea, and goes to work in the morning mist. He lectures (enjoying it more than he'd ever imagined); he answers questions; he declines Molly’s lunch invitation and promises to catch up next week instead.
Mycroft clucked. “I arranged nothing, I'm afraid; the MacNamaras have owned that property for generations.”
They were in the last few days of their holiday, and there was no longer any question about what would happen next. Soon they'd go back to Castletownbere to retrieve Einstein and spend a last night with Maeve and Bertie before returning to London. Mycroft, being certain what his brother would do, had never actually gotten John an appointment with Doctors Without Borders, so there was nothing to fix there. They were free from any obligations but those to one another, and despite the fact that their holiday had been nothing less than idyllic, were looking forward to finally beginning their Baker Street life again.
Since Sherlock’s surprise appearance on Christmas Eve, John had gotten to spend ample time with every version of Sherlock he knew, and some that were new to him. For instance, he'd become newly acquainted with dog-loving Sherlock, who he'd only previously known from stories. Sherlock had been horrified at the idea that Einstein would be staying behind in Ireland, and it only took a five minute conversation with Maeve and Bertie and a few texts to Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson for Einstein to have the promise of a home at Baker Street when John and Sherlock returned to London in February. He'd also gotten to see bee-obsessed Sherlock in the flesh when Sherlock had eagerly volunteered to help Bertie with the winter work on the hives in the days just after Christmas.
Sherlock shook his head just once, his face still neutral. “There’s only one bedroom in this flat that’s open to you any longer, John, and it’s not the one upstairs. I--” His voice cracked, just a little, and he cleared his throat before going on. “I’ve been wrong about this before, but I don’t think I am now. I think you've decided that we don’t have to wait anymore.”
John pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s collarbone, and felt him shiver. He did it again, letting his tongue graze the skin; this time, a quiet moan rumbled in Sherlock’s throat..
Sherlock pulled off of John’s mouth, panting, and tilted his head to one side, nudging John with his chin. John took the hint and began to work his way down what seemed like acres of glorious neck, stopping below the ear to revisit the mark he'd left there the previous night, and to slowly, lingeringly, leave another just below it. Sherlock whined a little when he moved on, but the whine was quickly strangled by an open mouthed moan as John’s lips wrapped around a nipple instead. John chuckled, and gave Sherlock a push. He went over on his back easily, and John moved to straddle his thighs.
I missed Saturday by 20 minutes. I couldn't get the penetrative sex to fit in properly (hee). Hopefully you agree that the extra time I took was worth it. Epilogue tomorrow!
