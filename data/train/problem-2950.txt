“Dean,” Castiel kneels down, “Are you alright?” His eyes roam over Dean, looking for any sign of injury.
So Dean ends up with fifty cans and lids in the back of Baby and an awkward silence as he drives away from Rufus’s place. Well, Dean’s not about to talk about this. Best to leave it alone and never mention it again.
Butterflies flutter in Cas’s stomach, “Dean, please know I mean this in the best way but I think we’re both a couple of dumbasses.”
Cas gives Dean a reassuring smile, “Thank you for telling me. I’m honored that you’d feel comfortable telling me. With regards to your question. I have suspected since we first met, given your vested interest in my gender and sexuality.”
Dean’s face falls, “A little like hell. Bobby’s feeling like shit from the back surgery and that stubborn SOB insists can do everything himself. I wanted to strangle him half the damn time but then I felt like shit for thinking that. It doesn’t matter. I’m here now,” Dean stops, throwing his arms open. “Are you just gonna stand there? Where’s my welcome home hug?”
It was a little niche but Cas had grand plans to make it a series that included other supernatural beings.
When it’s time for dinner, both human and birdie, he puts them back in the birdroom and pours out their nightly pellet ration. He doesn’t need three flighted birds in the kitchen when he’s got a hot stove going.
Dean’s on kid duty for the rest of the day. Jack’s fever has faded but Dean takes the easy with him. Mostly coloring and playing elaborate games with Jack’s large collection of plastic dinosaurs between several long naps.
Dean desperately tries to calm his thoughts. Cas has never given him any reason to doubt their relationship. It’s mostly that Dean is brimming with his own insecurities  And yet again…
His destination is technically a few miles east, but Dean figures Las Vegas is an acceptable detour. The drive from Lawrence to Vegas is about 18 hours. Dean takes a lot longer. It’s different from a hunt. There’s no end goal. He can just do whatever he likes.
Dean gets up before everyone else most days to make breakfast. Well, Sam is up to go for a run but no one else in the bunker is a health food hippie. He doesn’t care how good a kale smoothie is for him, he’s not feeding it to his family.
Dean thinks. Castiel’s mess isn’t really his problem but he can’t leave the guy stranded on some mountain pass. He’s a lot of things but he is not that much of a dick. Besides, he came prepared.
“Don’t take this the wrong way. You’ve lived with the guy for over a year. You spend every day with him. You run a B&B together. I kinda just assumed something was up but you’re always so touchy about these things,” Sam says. Dean can almost hear the smirk.
Michael looks Dean over. “It would seem my brother intends to take you as his husband. I assume I cannot dissuade Castiel from this path," Michael says.
The place is busy. They sell typical gut grease to tourists. A little out-of-place but Dean’s not in the position to be picky. He orders some beers from the barkeep, a friendly woman. She’s armed to the teeth. All concealed but Dean knows a hunter when he sees one. The night wears on. He waits until the place is quiet. Just him and the drunks, passed out at their tables.
Dean scratches his shoulder. “Kinda have for a while. Cas, you don’t have to agree to anything at all. But I needed to say something because there’s really no other way to interpret my mark and I didn't want it to get awkward”
Cas looks up, “The legality of hustling is disputed in many places. For what it’s worth, billiards is a game of skill. I believe that young man learned that lesson tonight,” he says, seemingly serious.
“Kid is good with cars. Unlike some people,” Dean teases as he steps out of the Impala. He can feel his heart thump in his chest but his earlier anxiety melts away at the sight of his best friend. Dean looks exhausted but he gives Cas a gentle smile. Cas never tires of it.
first. Everything else looked terrible. Pokémon was a stupid kids movie but it was hardly the worst way to spend ninety minutes. It was better than getting beat up by vamps.
Cas goes to grab his blade, lodged firmly in the side of the cabin. “It would seem Heaven thought to finish me off before I truly fell. I suppose they took a calculated risk and hoped a mere footsoldier could kill me in my weakened state. They forget themselves. This will remind them.”
Dean can’t help the amused snort, “Hey, I took you up on your offer. Are you trying to nicely say I need to stop being a dumbass?”
Dean sighs, “I never actually thought I would get this far. I mean, I practiced but, you know. It’s not the same. With a dude. What I’m trying to say...”
Cas goes along with Dean’s packed schedule when they reach Tombstone. They have a few days at a themed ranch outside town. It’s a little much but the rooms are beautifully themed. Cas is visibly pleased with the rocking chairs out front. The evenings are spent relaxing in the warm summer air, drinking the expensive whisky Dean couldn’t resist buying and enjoying each other's company.
Dean is currently just in his swim trunks though. Last time he got the opportunity to sit on the beach and do nothing was Los Angeles and he didn’t stay long. He wants a tan. Unfortunately, Cas insists on applying sunscreen every two hours.
Dean turns his attention back to digging around until he finds a bag marked “Anna: Casual Shirts”. “I assume we’re having a Novak family board game night to celebrate your return?”
Granted, they’d spent most of their time inside, but every change of location meant another slog to or from the car. Maybe he wouldn’t be so annoyed if they’d actually found what they were looking for. But instead they’ve wasted a day, he and Cas, investigating zip and getting pissy at each other besides. Dean would kill to be home in own bed tonight, stretched out on a mattress that practically remembers his name, but it’s pouring and it’s late and, frankly, he doesn’t have it in him these days to be in the car for long stretches when he doesn’t have to. (And when in his life did four hours become a long stretch, exactly?)
Castiel's head snaps back, imagines that he’s pressing it into Dean's shoulder as Dean chuckles, spreading that warm honey sound all over Castiel's back. It makes Castiel’s fingers tighten, his wrist move faster, the feel of that sound in his skin.
Touching himself like this isn’t uncomfortable or disagreeable, Castiel thinks. He rubs his thumb across the head. It’s soft and warmer still, this part of his cock. Almost hot. In theory, he understands that with some manipulation, some application of hand to flesh, like this, he could eradicate this problem. The shaft bumps the inside of his wrist as he turns his thumb again, and oh, there’s a sudden rumble of pleasure between his hips, a low-grade fever of feeling that’s sweet, somehow. Rich and deep.
So Castiel complies, most days. The days when Dean is in residence rather than on the road. But when his showers are short, like this morning, he turns the heat up to stinging, as fevered as he can stand, to compensate for the time lost reveling in it—his own small form of rebellion.
Sam thinks this makes total sense—something about Cas experiencing heightened physical sensations and probably preferring t-shirts and jeans just like everybody else—but Sam’s missing the part where all that tugging and fussing reminds Dean that Cas doesn’t want to be in his clothes, and Cas-not-in-his-clothes is a thing Dean’s had to try very hard not to think about lately.
Cas drags him in by the cuff. Supernatural strength is an ability of angels apparently. The bastards.
“Look, I’m not great with feelings. Or talking. But I wanted to apologize. I was a real dick to you when we first met. You’ve only ever been good to me. I’m sorry.” Dean hopes Castiel understands he’s also sorry he didn’t say something sooner.
The photograph is still in Dean’s wallet. Its corners are frayed, there’s a crease across one edge but the inscription is as clear as ever.
Cas comes up beside Dean, staring angrily at the pamphlet on geology, “I don’t understand the name. This place is nothing like the moon. The moon certainly doesn’t have such a rich ecosystem.”
Dean had reviewed his options. They could get a mattress topper to put over the cushions. Except where are they going to store it during the day? Dean could ignore the problem, except he can clearly hear it all night. Dean could get an air mattress but he’s back at the space issue again.
A Benny did in fact go and build himself a community a few years back. The coven has been growing. He and the other members have even been taking classes at the Leahy Institute of Supernatural Learning. First it was every hunter, now supernatural beings are signing up. The classes Benny took aren’t even related to the supernatural. He took one of Sam's classes on conflict resolution.
“Jack’s mother was human. His father was an angel. He is a nephilim. They are incredibly powerful beings.” There’s an edge to Cas’s voice when he says the last part.
Castiel continues, “If you were to ask my brothers and sisters, they’d say I had a crack in my chassis. I was different from the start. I’ve spent many years on Earth. I like it down here. Eventually, I stayed for good.”
This was supposed to be a Hallmark moment. Sam’s acting like it’s no big deal. “I expected crying, Sam. You’re always trying to get me to talk about my feelings. Where is the emotion?”
Cas hasn’t talked a lot about how he makes a living. That suits Dean just fine. Dean’s not too eager to share either.
Dean glances back at Cas and Donna, now both admiring a photograph of Mount Shasta despite the fact the mountain is right outside.
A part of Dean, the hunter trained to fear the supernatural, wants to bulk. There’s more. There must be. All the same, he knows that fondness and devotion in Cas’s voice. It’s how he feels toward Sam.
The kid shallows hard. There’s something about Cas when he lets his powers bleed though that really radiates I’m a celestial being energy. Dean finds it kinda hot.
to distract Jack long enough so he can help Cas to bed. Cas insists he’s fine but Dean rubs his back until he’s out cold.
Dr. Mills waits patiently until Dean can finally collect himself. He awkwardly coughs, “So uh, what, uh, triggers it to fire back up?”
“Warm that up.” He instructs. Cas holds the lube between his hands and uses his very convenient angel powers to heat the bottle to a comfortable temperature. He throws it back to Dean so he can get to work preparing Cas.
"It can't be that bad," he says to Cas, to his conscience, to himself, as he gets to his feet and nudges open the door.
“Shhh,” Dean soothes—an impossible entreaty, surely, given the ways he’s turning his tongue over Castiel’s nipple, tugging it with the tips of his teeth the same way he’s tugging at Castiel’s cock, drawing desperation from Castiel’s body, drop by drop. He finds himself arching again, clawing at Dean’s neck and panting.
Cas moans and his knees buckle, and if Dean’s cock weren’t in a much-needed time out, that sound alone would have it perking up. “Dean,” Cas says again, breathy and beautiful. “Yes, Dean. I need—”
Cas moans, a little sound, low and deep. It sounds like praise for the water, for the heat, sweet relief. ”Thank you,” he chants, “thank you, thank you.”
“Dean—” he says again, low and unsteady, the word rolling around in his mouth as Dean’s tongue slides into the groove of his hip.
"Can you—” Cas says around that same little hitch. “Can you come here? It's very— Maybe you can fix it?"
Dean hums and lifts his head a little, just enough to shove a few words between them. “That good?” He works his hand through again and tangles it in the ends, in the longest strands at the top of Castiel’s head. “You like that, Cas?”
“I’ll fuck you good and deep, sweetheart. God, you know I will, don’t you? But when I do,” Dean leans closer, lips over Cas’s ear, “I wanna watch you touch yourself.” Cas tenses, his fingers clawing into Dean’s ribs, and it’s kind of the best thing Dean’s felt all day. Or, well, in the last two minutes. He drops a fat kiss on Cas’s neck. “Yeah,” he says, licking the words into Cas’s skin. “I wanna watch you stroke that gorgeous cock of yours while I fuck you, hmm? Get so deep up inside you and stay there, baby. Fuck you so full. Hold you down on my dick while you come and—”
"Okay, you sonofabitch," he says, wedging the handle in again and cranking it. The metal grinds and groans but there's a clunk of pipes and then a familiar whoosh.
—indulgence such as this: the smooth, hot press of Dean’s bare chest, Dean’s tongue on his neck, Dean’s twitching cock in his hand. He may be human now, but he knows this isn’t base need or greed. Dean’s skin may feel like sin, and the roll of his hips and shift his hands might seem unholy, but Castiel’s desire for him, for Dean, he's sure: it's pure and fierce and forever.
“Dean,” he says, dazed, an expression of gladness, of desire, and this time it’s Dean who pulls Castiel’s mouth to his.
“You like that, Cas?” Dean asks. He voice is wrecked and his mouth is red, deep, wet red that Castiel can’t stop touching. Dean nips at Castiel’s thumb as it skates over his lip. “You like watching me suck you?”
“Hey!” Dean says, his voice ringing off the tile. “Stop. I mean, uh, stay. Just stay there, in there, I mean, and move, uh, that way." He gestures at the far end of the tub, back behind the curtain.
They throw themselves into the rain and run, and oh shit, it’s gross, but the key turns on the first try, hallelujah, and they make it into the room only half drenched rather than totally soaked. There’s three or four seconds then where they just stand there staring at each other in the entryway, panting and dripping and, Jesus. This is exactly why this whole thing is not okay.
He stalks up on the tub like it’s gonna bite him, wary as hell, but he still jumps when Cas starts waving the handle around in the general direction of his face.
having this conversation,” he says, sliding out of his chair. He sweeps up his plate and tosses Castiel a little smirk as he beats a hasty retreat and that . . . was not a response Castiel had expected.
Dean’s wet, ruined clothes cling and stick while Castiel is naked before him, wrapped only in water and the clutch of Dean’s hands. And he should feel vulnerable, at the mercy of Dean’s mouth, Dean’s command, but it’s the opposite. Castiel feels invincible in this moment, chest expanding with every breath and beyond. Inside he’s expanding like the universe, blown wide and alive, aware of every movement and molecule.
” Castiel whines, working his hips against Dean’s, trapping his cock between their bodies and grinding until Dean’s lips stumble and he moans, this deep unbidden sound, right into Castiel’s mouth.
“You gotta tell me,” he pants. “If it doesn’t feel good, Cas, you gotta tell me, okay? You just say it and I’ll—”
in a way that’s kind of frightening. And Dean doesn’t want to make a mess, doesn’t want to break him. Again. Somehow.
“What? Whoa. Cas!” Dean protests, but then he’s there, they’re there, standing together in the spray and Dean’s eyes are bewildered and wanting. Castiel recognizes that want, and knows now how to meet it.
It's happening again, he thinks, frantic. He's practically hemorrhaging cool. Cas needs his help, for crying out loud, not a side dish of Dean Winchester’s Issues.
In the mirror, his hands are still moving, still working to get himself dry. He watches the towel pass over his groin, around one thigh, and—
After that night, there’s a whole new kind of pleasure associated with the wet heat of the shower for Castiel. One he’s developed a small habit of indulging in.
But occasionally the close quarters of this place exacerbate his sense of too loud, too many, too much. It’s not Dean’s fault, or Sam’s. For them, these everyday interactions—the clatter of Dean’s boots on the stairs, Sam’s calisthenics, the simple logistics of humanity—are utterly routine. But for Castiel, they are still blindingly new, and there are times, he finds, when he needs a place to hide.
Before he can think the better of it—or think at all—Dean rips off his socks and climbs into the tub. The showerhead sticks out far enough that if he manages to get it working the water should overshoot him. Probably.
He stretches his fingers over Dean’s lips, tracing the smooth seal of suction, and Dean moans, a tiny whimper of noise that he buries in Castiel’s cock right before he lifts his mouth away.
As Dean yanks his hands finally free, Cas darts out the door. “Where’re you going? Get your ass back here!” Dean shouts, yanking his wet pants to his ankles. The bathroom is a mess—water and wet clothes everywhere, and no more dry towels either, damn it—but Dean shoves past all of it, drops his pants in a heap and stumbles through the door.
In his mind, Dean kisses his throat, tight little blooms that have Castiel's body arching, asking for more.
“If you say so, Solo,” Dean says, and he maybe sounds amused. Perhaps. “Just, uh, make sure you clean up in there. When you’re done.”
“Right. Yeah. Right.” He jams the handle of the goddamn stupid (blessed, beautiful) shower and jumps out of the tub just as Cas flings open the bathroom door, letting in a whoosh of cold air. “Cas!” he complains, struggling to get finally get his damn shirt all the way off. Cas tosses his towel at Dean’s head and laughs, which is obviously nine kinds of unfair, seeing as he’s not the one fighting with fucking wet cuffs. Ugh.
“I hear you,” Dean calls out. “Don’t get your panties in a twist.” Colette’s not a familiar but he’s pretty sure he hears an offended chirp.
The tape hisses a bit, “Thank You” starts up. Cas laughs, “I look forward to spoiling the newest addition to the Leahy family.” He pauses, turning toward the window. “Dean, I wanted to tell you something.”
Cas gives his son a lopsided smile before letting go. He hugs Jack again. Dean doesn’t realize he’s just been watching these two when the oven beeps loudly, letting everyone know it’s preheated.
“Really?” Dean asks, as he tries to find his pants in the low light of their bedroom. “I mean, you’ve still got your wings attached. I assumed you’d transform or something.”
Cas must draw the line somewhere. Dean would rebuild the car practically overnight if Cas let him. “Let Benny inspect the damage and give me a quote. No use in repairing it if I’m going to purchase a new vehicle anyway.”
Dean knows where this is going and he doesn’t like it.  “I sure as hell wasn’t helpful. I moped around for months and then pissed off to Vegas.”
Sam was in pretty bad shape. Turned out his girlfriend had passed away. Car accident. Sam’s heart just wasn’t in it anymore. Dean figured Stanford wasn’t going anywhere. He told Sam to pack up, they were getting out of town. A road trip would at least get Sam out of the house.
Dean frowns, “It’s none of your damn business. Look, I was only scoping out some places that Cas might be interested in. He’s stuffed in that house with, like ten million other people. He and Jack deserve some space. The house doesn’t need to be too big. But he needs a nice yard. He’s got his gardens. Lord knows he’s going to need a canning shed soon. Jack needs a place to play. We need a place for the chicken run.”
They plan to spend one more day here before traveling on to the Sawtooth Range. It’s out of the way but Cas insisted they needed to actually camp. Spend some time in nature. Apparently they weren’t getting enough already.
That’s what the angel – seraph, tells him. Dean’s sitting in the office, the cup of tea Castiel made him left untouched.
Did Cas just accuse Dean of eye fucking him? He definitely was but there is a world of difference between longing stares and consummation. Who calls it that anyway?
“It’s barely worth scrapping. I honestly don’t know how your friend got that damn thing to run. Tell you what though, one of my boys is convinced he can get it working, The kid’s had a rough few years. I can take it off your hands if your friend wouldn’t mind giving the kid the car,” Bobby offers.
“Order two more of the Magnum P.I. shirts,” Dean instructs Charlie as she checks the order. “I need one for Cas and Anna. I’ll modify it for her.  That’s sure to cause a scandal among the Miltons.”
Sam moves to get out of the car. “It’s all over your face. You gotta stop freaking out every time shit happens.”
Dean nearly spits kale right into Sam’s face. “Christ, I need to get the degree first. It’s gonna take several years. I’ll probably not start school until next fall. Thank god for online classes.
Lissuin shimmers in the low light of the bedroom, “You are the most ridiculous man I have ever met.”
Cas shouldn’t feel this possessive, but he likes it very much. More than anything, it’s Dean. His Dean.
Cas would bring him breakfast and coffee. It gave them some quiet time to talk about whatever. Cas’s complicated garden plans, Jack’s newest interest. Dean being forced to witness Sam’s awkward romancing of the town librarian, Eileen Leahy, the terrible things people do to their cars on the coastal highway. It was twenty minutes, just for themselves.
Dean’s contemplating if murder is legal for jackasses who go fifty-five in the passing lane when Cas interrupts his thoughts.
Cas deflates, “Tiring. Tanya came down with the flu so Nora’s been out. I’ve been on the night shift three times this week. Gabriel and Michael are at each other’s throats. The furnace at home broke. Mrs. Quakers developed a case of bumblefoot. We’re out of nacho cheese for the hotdogs and pretzels until at least next week. I’ve had multiple customers regurgitate on freshly mopped floors. The slushy machine keeps breaking, despite my best efforts to fix it and the light bulbs keep exploding. And Jack is under the weather.”
“He did that picture thing didn’t he?” Jack asks. He looks a little embarrassed. It takes a great effort to suppress a smile at the memory.
Cas gazes upon the ominous thick smoke pouring out of Jubilee and wonders if this was fated to happen today.
Dean doesn’t respond though. He can't, words fail him at the moment. Yet, he doesn’t need them with Cas. He pulls the memory to the forefront of his mind.
Once Cas has some food in him, Dean flops over, resting his head in Cas’s lap, snuggling against his belly as he closes his eyes. Cas smells faintly of orange soda and industrial laundry soap.
“Cas. Pal. It’s alright,” Dean reassures him, he sounds like he’s trying to talk down a scared animal. “Where are you?”
Cas’s favorite burger toppings were PB & J. It’s been right there the whole time. Jesus fucking Christ.
One night, Dean discovered the angels were watching over him. They appear in his dreams. Thousands. Millions. A mass of wings, flames, and eyes.
A frog croaks out in the pond that sits in the center of the property. Jack loved to swim in it during the summers. “I mean, I can get that. It’s a big deal but I’m worried you’re stressing too much. Dude, you’ve worked your ass off for this. You gotta relax.”
Cas tugs at Dean’s chin, urging him to look up. “He understands.” Cas gently runs his hands through Dean’s hair.
Dean looks pissed. “Ignore my jerk of a brother. I’m thirty-three. I don’t get crushes. Look Cas, I know you’re here to work. I’m sorry I made you uncomfortable. It was just nerves, okay. Let’s just forget this ever happened.”
“Man, there are at least a dozen places we could look at. There’s a lot a few miles down the road from the Novak fortress. House is kinda run down. Nothing your angel mojo and some power tools won’t fix. I’ll build you a proper canning shed though. It would get too hot in the kitchen if I’m using the oven and you’re canning going during the summer. It would require some logistics but I think I can build Jack a playset. I saw some cool designs online.”
Cas deflates, glancing between the car and the distant mountains. “I’ll fly home I suppose. I live out in Washington. I had hoped to stay out here longer.”
Well, that must mean only one thing. Dean turns around to look at Cas. Guy looks adorable in his floral pajamas and bed-head.
“Was that clear enough?” Dean pants. Cas rolls his eyes but he’s smiling. He rests his head against Dean’s. “I love you.”
“But, it’s Tuesday. Shooting practice is always…” Jack says as Sam practically hauls him up and shoves him out the door. Now it’s just Dean and Cas.
Dean’s alarm goes off an hour later. He regrettably gets out of bed, stuffs another muffin in his mouth and gets out of the camper to resume his drive. Trench Coat is still there, staring at his pimpmobile, as if his gaze will miraculously cause it to start.
“I trust that you’ll understand when I say that Jack is not fully human,” Cas informs him, turning his gaze towards Dean. He nods, trying to keep his attention on driving.
Dean figured he must have really smacked his noggin’ against that slushy machine because he had no damn idea what was happening. How did this fucker know his name?
Cas shifts his eyes back and forth. “Nothing. We were exchanging stories. She’s a well traveled hunter.”
Dean buys a pickup truck. He was all set to buy a rust bucket before Sam intervened. Put on his best “I’m concerned about you” face and dragged Dean to an actual car dealership.
Hunting was a respectable profession for those who could put up with the long hours and constant travel. Claire loved it, even if she wasn’t constantly hunting demons as she once dreamed. Most cases were dealing with ghosts, the undead, anything shady involving the afterlife. Dean’s heard enough Ghostbusters jokes to last until the end of time, although it’s not that far off.
Dean needed a portal to Hell. Only a few ways to do that. The easiest one was to get an angel to do it. That’s why angels were on Earth at all. Open up Hell and throw the demons back in.
He rolls into the Gas-n-Sip parking lot at 6:01 am. Cas is standing patiently in the parking lot, hands folded together.
“Hey,” Dean calls out, mouth half-full of muffin, “you havin’ a little car trouble?” Dean can probably help Trench Coat out. Seems better than the guy’s plan of glaring at his car.
There is the small problem of the Continental. Dean’s pretty sure Cas would prefer to give it a viking funeral. Since the ocean is a few hundred miles away, Dean goes down to Singer’s Automotive  to see if he can sweet talk the owner into getting it towed to a junkyard. Cas offered to go with him but the guy was barely out of bed. Besides, Dean figures he might have better luck.
Dean makes out with him against the door of the Ford. For a man who has not had a reason to engage in this kind of stuff, Cas sure uses a lot of tongue.
Sam smirks, “You really are gone on him. I mean I knew that but I was not prepared for how bad you have it for Cas.”
Cas drags Dean to the Museum of Wildlife Art after that. Dean’s beginning to think the guy has a thing for nature.
Jack flaps off in the morning after Dean stuffs him with real food. Dean also decides that it’s time to have his heartfelt conversation with Sam. He tells his brother he wants to have lunch with him.
“Very well,” Cas says, reaching inside his sleeve and pulling out a blade. He must have summoned it. It’s an impressive knife but not the kind of weapon Dean was expecting.
He had some furniture delivered. He spends far too long putting it together. Gabriel comes over and tells him that he should have gotten a PhD in power tools instead of history.
. Dean didn’t really know. He bought children’s movies on VHS by the bucket load since they were so cheap these days. Also, no child of Dean’s was going to grow up without knowing how to use a VCR. It was an important life skill, no matter what Sam said.
That realization had freaked him out. He had a family. He always had Sam but he figured it was going to be the two of them until a monster took them out. Dean never expected the apple pie life.
“I suppose it’s time,” Cas says, regrettably getting off Dean’s lap. Cas grabs the extractor and puts the needle against his neck.
Once in undergrad, Cas overslept during finals week. He woke up ten minutes before the test started. He never felt such an acute mix of panic and adrenaline as he sprinted out of his dorm.
Cas doesn't say anything, only climbs on to Dean’s lap and kisses him. Eventually Cas pulls back, smiling wide, but wincing at the awkward position. Dude does have a bad case of humanity afterall.
Castiel is beside Dean in an instant. He seems taller than he usually is. His wings, all six, are flared in challenge.
That gets Dean’s attention, “I thought Michael usually did that?” The Miltons took their family reunions incredibly seriously and there was no way Michael had willingly relinquished his role as the planner.
Sam is Alakazam. A little generous in Dean’s opinion. Sam should be Abra since he’s a big baby but Dean doesn’t want to spoil Jack’s fun.
Cas was relaxed and acting like he was comfortable with Dean. Like undressing in front of him wasn’t a big deal. It was just something you did with your travel buddy.
Dean’s palms are clammy. It wasn’t just the hunting trip that rattled him. It was what had happened the night before. Well, nothing had happened. Cas had come over for dinner, as he did most nights. It gave him some reprieve from the chaos that was the Novak family. Sam was out on a date with Eileen which meant it was just Cas and Jack.
Castiel is finished falling on an early spring morning. It’s barely passed dawn. Cas and Dean always rise early to eat their own breakfast before attending to their guests. Castiel rolls over and tells Dean he’s finally done. He’s human. He’s got a certified soul.
Dean definitely notices the little shiver that runs through Cas. He puts the tupperware in his bag and hands it to Dean. It’s surprisingly heavy. “I brought you bananas for Sam. I saved the only good bunch for him. There are several cans of pie filling in there for you as well.”
He and Cas had breakfast together almost every morning. He hadn’t come over to have his coffee with Dean. Something was stressing Cas out and none of his texts indicated the cause.
Nougat is hanging around their neck, as usual, slowly scanning the room with his beady snake eyes looking for threats and possibly assessing if Dean is food. Dean’s thankful Jack chose a corn snake as a familiar rather than a reticulated python or green anaconda. Nougat isn’t capable of eating him in one go.
Vegas is Vegas. He gambles, meets a few lovely women, enjoys the Strip afterdark. Still, Vegas is full of traffic.
Well he would be if Cas wasn’t being a son of a bitch. House rules were that the driver picked the music. Cas had given him some dirty looks about it but never really complained. He’s been waiting. Planning. Dean knows it.
“Nora’s been a darling. There’s just a few billing issues that have been giving her trouble,” Meg tells Cas.
Jody’s story is based on an anecdote from Colin Dickey’s The Unidentified: Mythical Monsters, Alien Encounters, and Our Obsession with the Unexplained.
Castiel was right about one thing. His piece of shit car refuses to start. There’s at least a dozen things wrong with it.
Castiel lets out a sigh, “Most angels cannot comprehend me. My desire to remain on Earth. To fall. They wish to be rid of such deviations. Yet, they cannot stand to be around me. So they find others to do the work.”
“Hey!” Dean shouts through the door. “Cas! You grow gills in there or something? Your waffles are getting cold.”
He spreads a wet hand wide and rests his palm over it, against it, his cock—a gesture it appears to appreciate, for it curves greedily to meet his touch, mindless. A swirl of delight chases through his blood as his fingers trace over the head, under the lip of the crown, and—
The water rolls over his shoulders, down his spine, a quick infusion of heat. He bows his head and lets it course through his hair and over his cheeks, lets it drizzle from his bottom lip as he takes slow, humid breaths.
Cas’s mouth, his hands, everything hot and wet, their bodies pressing and pulling as it builds in Dean. Builds and builds until there’s no stopping, nothing left but to let it overrun him. His body goes taut a half-heartbeat before he comes. He breaks Cas’s kiss—can’t help it—and squeezes his eyes shut for the first second it surges through him, electric and stupid and oh God, so fucking good. “
Dean laughs, raises his head and nips at that broad, beautiful mouth until Cas opens for him, welcoming and wanting. “Yeah,” Dean murmurs. “You and me? I think we can do that.”
Castiel holds his breath and braces himself for Dean’s touch, for Dean to drop his hand between them and squeeze his cock. But Dean surprises him by kissing him instead, secret and slow. Different than before, but good, so good, Dean licking the tension from Castiel’s mouth until he relaxes, until he has to wrap his arms around Dean’s neck and hold on just to get his fill of Dean’s lips, his tongue.
He listens for Dean in the next room, for the heavy and slow breaths that signal deep sleep—it would be inconsiderate to wake him.
Castiel can feel his thighs tense, his toes tighten against the tile floor. He swallows hard and breathes deep, but his eyes never leave that reflection, the shade of Dean just behind.
There is so much about being human that Castiel finds confusing. Without the buffer of his grace, the world is too full of commotion: people breathing and people talking, the din of traffic and the stench of city sidewalks. All of it strains his newly minted senses in ways that he finds overwhelming. Even the thrum of his own heart, of his own thoughts, is sometimes too much to bear.
“What are you waiting for?” Cas asks, irritated. He’s shifting his shoulders in a way that Dean’s learned means the suit is bothering him. Which is funny, Dean thinks, given how many years Cas spent in a two-piece seemingly of his own accord. But now he tugs at the tie all the time, yanks at his cuffs like they’re cutting his wrists.
, uneasy and immediate, outside the shelter of his grace. Even when his hands, his legs and his elbows, even when they looked clean, he was certain the grime was still there, was sure he could feel it burrowing into his pores. He’d stayed in the steam a long time (much longer, he knows now, than was strictly necessary) but it soothed him, the kind of quiet he found there. And now, when his humanity is too much, too loud, the shower is his favorite space for respite.
The next night, as he readies for bed, it's still disrupting his concentration, this paradox. He’s too unsettled to sleep, and the book in his hands feels like a burden rather than a delight. Restlessness crawls beneath his skin, an unfamiliar itch he’s not sure how to quiet. The more he considers the problem, rolls it over and back in his mind, the greater his agitation becomes.
Dean complicates this second kiss by pushing his fingers through Castiel’s hair, a touch that’s hard and intimate and coaxing. It’s unexpected, the way Dean touches him—the dig of Dean’s nails at his neck, the small strokes of his thumb—each one sending a shiver down Castiel’s spine. Dean
He imagines Dean biting gently at the top of his spine, curling his mouth around Castiel's neck and sucking, steady and slow.
At first touch, his cock hangs small and soft against his body. In the mirror, he watches himself cup his fingers under it, forming that loose C shape, and squeezes gently, adding the barest tug. He’s gratified by the way his cock jumps, by the thrum and rush of his blood through his body. He pulls again, and again, and feels his cock firm as he watches his reflection, watches it grow in his hand, watches the fat head emerge from the cusp of his fingers.
Castiel catches his own eye in the mirror, and he can see it, the way his mind is turning, plotting conspiracy with himself. Surely another few minutes won’t matter. He bites his lip and glances over his shoulder towards the door.
“I’m gonna make you come,” Dean says, head turned so his lips ghost along Castiel’s length. “D’you want that? You want me to suck you off?” His tongue sneaks out, just the tip. “Make you come so hard?”
He looks up, searching Dean’s face—surely he understands what Castiel feels, even if Castiel can’t—and Lord, Castiel thinks, Dean Winchester is beautiful. There’s water falling over Dean’s face, spilling down his cheeks, as he tips in close, his mouth resting just out of reach. He's staring into Castiel’s eyes, the flash of his smile tinged with wonder, a slow easy thing in contrast to the hot, heavy jerk of his fist.
He eases down the hall, away from the light, from Sam, and towards the bathroom. He closes the door quickly but quietly behind him, and leans on it in the dark for moment, surprised by the heavy, fast thump of his heart. Behind his back, he gives the lock tab a twist. Just . . . because. It seems a wise precaution.
Castiel didn't know it would be like this. Warm and wet. And good. So good, to be surrounded by slick and heat. He closes his eyes and breathes deep. He's cradled here, caressed. Every human tension easing out of his muscles as the water sluices over his shoulders, down his back, wraps around his legs as it pours toward the drain.
"Here's how this is gonna go,” Dean says, stern, bundling his sleeves up to his elbows, “you're gonna stay right there and I'm gonna fix this. Got it?"
—but hasn’t spent much time studying it, not from this perspective, anyway, taking it in as someone else might see it. But he looks now, unabashed.
He turns his back to the taps and leans over, one hand on the tile as the water pounds into his back. It’s so hot and so hard that it draws sounds from him, soft little noises at the back of his throat. The water holds him steady, allows him to be still, and in a moment there’s nothing but pleasure rolling deep under his skin.
He bites the top of Castiel’s thigh and links his thumb and forefinger just below the crown of Castiel’s cock, forming a tight O that Castiel can feel in his teeth as Dean noses the scruff around his cock. And then Dean
He slaps a hand to the wall, his palm slipping over the tiles as he strokes his cock, watches the head fall in and out of his fist as Dean nips at his jaw.
Castiel startles, his feet tripping backward, heart thundering, suddenly aware of the mess he’s made, the smell of come, the over-hot clench of the air.
the way that Dean touches him. So good that his head swims, floats away on the sensation of Dean’s hand on his cock, of Dean’s mouth on the curve of his neck. He staggers a little, off balance, and Dean chuckles into his skin.
The flush of red on Dean’s neck shoots up so high it reaches his cheeks. “Right,” he says. “Yeah. You, you know,” he makes a horizontal motion with his hand cupped in loose C shape before self-consciously dropping it. “Just sort of touch— And, uh, think about—”
“Dean,” Cas’s voice is broken. His hips are shifting, working into Dean’s like he can’t help it, like he has to.
It’s new and awesome, unexpected, and Castiel is even more certain now: he never knew—there was no way he could have known, could even have imagined, what it’s like to have Dean coax pleasure from his body, to fuck and fill Dean’s mouth, to watch white come fall from his lips as he lifts his head and grins.
He pulls at Dean’s hair, harder than he should, perhaps, because Dean looks up, his lips still flush against Castiel’s flesh. His eyes are hazy bright and so full of want that Castiel cries out, lets his head fall back to the wall. And then Dean’s drifting again, dropping kisses deeper, below his tattoo and beyond, into the smooth strip of skin just above the dark scruff that frames Castiel’s cock.
“I nicked myself,” Cas answers quickly and, oh no, he’ll have to shave now, with a razor and everything, to cover the lie. He’s certainly cut himself enough times before, so Dean won’t question— “It hurt,” he says to the door. “And, uh, I’m bleeding. But I’m— I’m fine. It’s all fine here, now.”
The chamber of commerce of Bella Vista, Arkansas, should get some kind of award for creative advertising or chutzpah or maybe just straight-up magical thinking, because the place is a lot of things—after sixteen hours on his feet on its streets, Dean can testify to that—but a
Castiel’s hands shake where they hang awkwardly by his side. Self-stimulation will be the best course. He knows this. It's what Dean had suggested, after all.
Cas wraps a hand in Dean’s hair and tugs, giving up a coy little shrug. “Or, you know,” he says, words rolling like a low rumble of thunder. “We could just . . . do what feels good.”
But it was weird, wasn’t it? Maybe a little extra weird, talking about stuff like that? Dean's replayed their exchange in his head a hundred (thousand) times, kicking himself for losing his cool every time. He just keeps telling himself the subject was a shock. And it
Cas is clearing his duffle bag and spare socks and Dean doesn’t care what else from the bed when he springs, tackles Cas, presses him into the mattress, their bodies wet but hey, still warm.
He lifts his foot like he’s gonna climb out and, no. There’s no way in hell that wet naked Cas is getting any closer to Dean. No way.
Sam chooses Deoxys for himself. “It is highly intelligent and wields psychokinetic powers,” is far too generous a description for Sam but he does like the implication that Sam is some sort of weird mutated space virus.
Dean’s half-way through his beer and not feeling any better when Cas comes back. He takes one look at Dean and frowns. Is he really that obvious?
“God, I love you so much. I want you to fuck me. I’ve need you to fuck me. I will explode if you don’t. Just like Jubilee.”
Despite Dean’s repeated declarations that he was perfectly fine, Cas knows that’s not true. Their phone call yesterday had been the most Dean talked about Bobby since the accident. After listening to Dean vent, Cas reminded him he didn’t have to shoulder his burdens alone.
Dean downs another beer, jumps off the stool, and walks over to the pool table. He asks Cas if he wants to make the game interesting. One twerp takes the bait. Raises Dean’s friendly bet by a few hundred. Dean pretends to hesitate but matches the bet soon enough.
He started writing about it in the last few years. Meg forced him to publish some of his work and it had proved popular within the local supernatural parenting community. He was currently working on
Dean remembers very little of his mother. Softly spoken words here, a blurry memory of his fourth birthday party, going to get a Christmas tree, the year Sammy was born and watching in delight as Dad cut down a big Douglas Fir and hauled it to the car.
“This geyser is only well known due to its predictable timing. I wish to try and see if any black bears are out in Hayden Valley at sunset,” Cas huffs as they sit on the benches near Old Faithful.
Dean shoves his head through the opening of his shirt, before grabbing his favorite blue and pink flannel. He gazes upon Cas. His husband.
“Sorry about Sam. He’s had to listen to me talk about you for weeks. I think he couldn’t take it anymore,” Dean says, avoiding looking at Cas.
Dean shakes it off, he didn’t come here to complain about rude customers. He came to see Cas, except he can’t do that because a line of customers is starting to form behind him.
“I know. I know. Thanks again!” Jack says, reaching over and unceremoniously plucking Nougat off Dean’s lap and draping him around their neck.
“You are infuriating, you know that,” Castiel tells him, inches from his face. “I am an ancient cosmic being Dean, I have no use or care for money. I wouldn’t bother with it at all but living on Earth does require some compromises. I have plenty to share.”
Now Cas looks away, shifting on his feet. “You avoid me. I don’t like it Dean. I want to go back to the way things were. I know I make you uncomfortable but my feelings for you don’t change what we had. I miss being with you.”
The room Sam puts Dean and Cas in has a framed print out from the text message conversation where Dean admitted he was proud of Sam. The asshole. What’s worse is that Cas tells Dean that communication is healthy in any relationship. Dean tries to argue Cas wouldn’t understand since he doesn’t have human siblings but Cas reminds him he once had thousands of siblings. Dean can’t really fight back against that.
Cas leans in close, “I will remind you, I do know magic. Now, Balthazar isn’t bringing a significant other…”
As they wait for Benny, Cas and Jack attempt to justify the smart car. It’s economic, environmentally friendly, and very adorable. Dean is unmoved. It’s “too wimpy.” This man can be so absurd at times.
Jack’s going to be five soon. His boy is going to start kindergarten in the fall. Dean doesn’t get teary-eyed at the thought.
Cas turns, he’s smiling though. “Yes, Dean. Thank you for spending your time with us. I have treasured the last few weeks and I look forward to our future travels. Alone.” There is an emphasis on the last part.
Cas motions down to a suitcase that somehow appeared out of nowhere. “I was hoping you’d have some room in your luggage. I’m afraid between Anna and me, there isn’t any room left in my suitcase.”
Why was Dean asking about Late-Onset Herophilus Gland Manifestation? Dean didn’t have a soul mark...
Cas raises his eyebrows, “Demons exist. Do you truly believe angels cannot also be real? I assure you, I am very real.”
Cas’s eyebrows squish together. So even he doesn't know what Jack is talking about. Jack stuffs several mouthfuls of cereal into his face before continuing.
It’s winter again. Dean’s been meaning to buy Cas an actual record player. Good ones aren’t cheap so he hustles more than he should. He gets a black-eye for his trouble. It’s nothing bad but it does sting. Dean doesn't want to go into the house kitchen right now. A guest might be up and Dean’s not too eager to explain his shiner.
He opens his mouth to point out that he’s not even applied yet when he is interrupted by a whack to his head.
Are you available Dean? 👀 Dad’s working late tonight and my truck is out of commission at the moment. 😩 I’m supposed to meet with the robotics team in half an hour to test our latest build.
Cas wonders if Dean is going to try and talk him into saving Jubliee if only to avoid the smart car or lecture him about car maintenance. Dean all but hauls Cas out of the kitchen as soon as he finishes drying the last dish.
“I was talking to Sam again about changing the name to the Leahy and Winchester Institute of Supernatural Learning once I get my degree. The jerk refused since there’s two of them and one of me. Eileen said she’d consider it if the numbers were even.”
“Thanks, really needed to know about your sex life. When’s the big day? I’ll need to put in for time off at the firm.”
But Castiel is still puzzled by Sam’s swift exit. “I don’t,” he starts, “Why did—? My understanding is that it’s only a biological reaction. Not something considered shameful.”
Dean rumbles something against his shoulder and keeps moving, chasing the water down Castiel’s chest with his tongue and his teeth. Castiel lets go of his tie and instead slides his fingers through the wet mess of Dean’s hair. He bows his back, shoves himself at Dean’s mouth, even as Dean gets a hand on Castiel’s hip and holds him, steadies him.
Cas is out of the shower with two hands on a towel before Dean can process what he’s— Well, fuck. “Dammit, Cas, wait!” He whips around, looking for the broken shower handle to turn the blasted thing off.
“Slow down, sweetheart,” Dean whispers, his tongue curling in the hollow of Castiel's throat. "Slow it down for me, okay? Please. I wanna . . . "
Living with the Winchesters, therefore, in their Men of Letters lair, is both a respite and a trial. The bunker offers a reprieve from the noisy public sphere, and it’s far superior to the streets that Dean retrieved him from. And Castiel is grateful, he is, for Dean coming to his aid on the strength of nothing more than a phone call.
Castiel sighs, his eyes caught one last time on the mirror, at the mess that he’s made. From now on, he thinks, he’ll stick to indulging himself in the shower. It’s just so much cleaner.
Dimly, he can feel Dean’s hand weaving around his hip, can feel Dean’s palm slipping over his tattoo, down the heat of his belly, until his fingers are fluttering over the crown of Castiel’s cock. It’s just a shade of a touch, fingertips teasing over the slit, but the teasing makes Castiel ache.
He takes a deep breath, strokes himself once more, and in his mind Dean is nosing at the back of his neck, one arm curled around his chest as the other slips down his side, fingers tripping over his ribs and coming to rest just above Castiel's hip. Playing over his tattoo.
He must look like an idiot, standing here slack-jawed and soaked in his damn dress clothes. Fuck, he’s still wearing his tie, whereas Cas—
He touches it, the same way he’d done before, a press of his palm, a nudge of his fingers at the base. This time the heat of it surprises him. His cock is warmer than the water, and than the rest of his body too.
So he digs his fingers into Dean’s collar and yanks him forward. Dean plants a fast hand on the tile beside Castiel’s head, close enough for Castiel to sink his teeth into the soft lobe of Dean’s ear, for him to growl, “I won’t break. I won’t.”
that Castiel stops breathing. He can only nod in response, mesmerized by Dean’s mouth, distracted by the hot hand still pumping his cock. His hips buck, pressing his cock against Dean’s face.
Its pleasures are simple, straightforward. And yet, when he closes his eyes and tips his face up to the spray, wholly immersive. When he’s here, he hears nothing, sees nothing, feels nothing except the water beating into his body and the stress of this new existence falling inexorably away.
Yes, he thinks, frowning, trying to zip his jeans around the persistent swell, there’s no question. His cock poses a problem.
Dean looks around, the shingles are everywhere. There’s a sizable hole in the cabin wall. This is gonna be a bitch to clean up.
The Novak home was out in the woods. Housing got cheaper, the further you went from the ocean.  A lot cheaper if you lived up an old dirt road in a janky house with constant repair problems. The one benefit was that there were several abandoned logging roads on the way. Places that were perfect for pulling off and getting up to trouble.
Cas had been hauling around a half-formed soul for a while so humanity wasn’t a complete change. Not better or worse than being an angel, Cas had told him. Just different.
“What are you talking about? Don’t answer that. The point is this has the right energy. Cas is liable to jump your bones after seeing you in this,” Charlie says. “You both have terrible taste.”
Dad’s old friend Bobby Singer owned a place up in Oregon, in a tourist town on the coast. Dean figured they could head up that way. Bobby had been a father to him when he still lived in Kansas. It would be good to see him again.
“It’s 90% Anna,” Claire clarifies, “It’s like when we were kids and Dad would take a fuckton of supplies for any possibility.”
Sammy tried to pull this shit a few times. But even he couldn’t stand his own poison after a while. Dean could wait him out. He’s a little less certain about Cas.
“Professionally, I would tell you it doesn’t strictly need to be a romantic interest. Any strong bond can trigger LO-HGM. If we are using your scale though, we’re on the marriage material end of things.”
Cas stares at Dean for a split second before sitting down to chat with Jack. Sam eventually wanders in with Eileen. Dean plates their food, making sure to give Sam nothing but rabbit food.
Dean considers the prospect. “I would be damn happy for you. Finally found someone to put up with you.”
The hike is shorter and less steep than Dean thought. He read the guidebook but was prepared to ascend a mountain. It’s a brisk walk up a large hill with a lot of switchbacks, the worst invention known to mankind. They find a place to rest below the overlook.
The drive out to Craters of the Moon is miles and miles of open range. Dean has always loved these kinds of drives. Nothing around except the open road, Zepp blasting on the stereo. Besides not having to gank some horrifying monster, the only difference is Cas occasionally saying “Cow!” as they drive past another one grazing. Cas did try to change the spotify playlist. He wasn’t too pleased with Dean’s house rules.
He’s lived in the supernatural world for so long. It’s all he knows. That’s why he can’t get the idea out of his head. Has to be. Just, the more he thinks about it, the more it makes sense.
“You told him?” Cas asks. Gabriel didn’t need to bother Dean with the details of Cas’s life. It was very apparent Dean didn’t care much for Cas at all.
at him. It’s a small town. There is one grocery store. Dean is always there at the exact same time Cas is but everytime Cas gets close, Dean hightails it out of there. The one time Cas managed to sneak up on Dean and say hello, Dean leaped, squeaked out a “hey” and practically ran down an old woman trying to get away.
me— ” He spreads his legs wider and watches as Dean leans forward on his knees, a hungry hum at the back of his throat that Castiel can feel in his cock.
His cock is disappointed when he drops it. Still, his erection endures, sitting smugly between his legs as he rinses off, as he climbs out of the tub, as he winds his way into his clothes.
But Dean doesn’t answer, just pushes Castiel’s hips back with both hands and leans in, Castiel’s fingers still knotted in his hair. He sucks more hot kisses into Castiel’s ribs, a ladder of heat down Castiel’s abdomen, first one side and then the other. Castiel is past thinking, past reason. His mouth opens and closes of its own accord, finally finding a moan as Dean drags his bottom lip over his belly.
He thinks he hears Dean huff a laugh, but doesn’t move until he hears footsteps move away from the door.
And, oh, as his head clears, clouds lifting, Castiel realizes that Dean— Dean is— Dean’s touching himself, jerking his cock at Castiel’s feet.
Cas’s stance shifts. His shoulders sink back, his hips push forward, and his eyes drop, just for second, before he finds Dean’s face again, his own a swirl of sweetness and sin.
it’s so good. So good he cries out, one palm smacking the tile by Castiel’s head as the other flexes frantic at Castiel’s hip.
"Yeah," Dean grunts, wedging the handle against the stem, aiming to turn it on that way, since the damn thing's obviously not going to go back on easy. He doesn't have the angle to leverage it right. Not from out here, anyway.
“Tell me, Cas,” Dean says, smile and eyes bright. “Tell me what you want. Is it this?” He moves like a snake, sneakier than the water, just pushes up and swallows Castiel down.
“Oh, thank God,” Dean sighs, sagging in what looks like relief. He gets to his feet and claps Castiel on the shoulder as he passes. “You'll be fine. Just— don't over think it.”
Dean, he thinks again, deliberate, and the reaction is the same: a kick of pleasure in his mind that’s mirrored in his body, his cock, and he holds himself more firmly, rolls his hand from the head to his belly and back, faster now.
kind, if you know what I mean.” He looks up and the impish grin accompanying that last thought drops away. “Which, you don’t. So.” He raps the table with his knuckles. “Ask.”
Worse, he’s around all the time. There’s no goddamn escape. They’re together like it’s normal and, terribly, it sort of is, and Dean has no clue how to deal.
Dean curves his hand to the back of Castiel’s head and pulls and Castiel can’t help it, the way his mouth falls open this time. It makes their third kiss faster, wetter, deeper.
. “Dude, look, if fourteen-year-olds everywhere can figure it out, so can you. It’s not like anybody’s gonna be looking over your shoulder and judging your style. Whatever you do is probably gonna feel awesome. Just go for it. Okay?”
” Castiel says, words honey shards in his throat. He pitches forward and grabs the counter’s edge with his free hand, hips jerking into the other of their own accord. “I’m close,” he whispers to the mirror, to a Dean who isn’t there. “I’m so close, Dean. Yes— Please,
Castiel is spent, his body sings with exhaustion, but here, he realizes, is an opportunity. One he’s never had before. Another—a new—fantasy he can make come true. The thought sends a long lick of desire down his sated spine.
Cas shivers, this long lovely thing Dean can feel run through both their bodies, and Jesus fuck, Castiel really is gonna kill him.
He fastens his gaze back on the mirror and watches as his downward strokes turn into upward pulls as his cock rises, its hard length curving out away from his body. Steam is steadily reclaiming the mirror, fogging over Castiel’s face and neck, but he doesn’t care. He can’t. His attention is lower, zeroed in on his hand and his cock, and it’s easier this way, he thinks—as he studies the speed of his hand, the twist of his wrist—easier to imagine that perhaps it’s not his hand that he’s watching. To imagine instead that it’s Dean’s, that maybe this is what it would look like if Dean’s hand were working him, jerking him, that maybe this is how he would touch Castiel, what he might do to make Castiel feel good.
Dean chokes on a laugh. He knew it. He fucking knew Cas was jacking off during those forever-long showers. But he didn’t know (well, maybe didn’t know for sure) it was about
Castiel gets lost in kissing, in the sweet haze of Dean’s mouth and hands. It’s only when his cock brushes the rough, wet fabric at the front of Dean’s pants that he realizes that he’s hard.
Castiel’s knuckles go white around the counter edge. He bites his lip and squeezes his eyes shut as it twists and pours through him, out of him.
His skin still holds the pink flush of heat from the shower, and when he drops the towel, tosses it aside, he can see it, the way the flush hangs on him, colors him from his thighs to his throat. He reaches up to touch his clavicle, that horizon of bone beneath taut skin, a little brush of fingers on flesh. Such a small thing that it surprises him. He shivers.
The hesitation in his voice makes Dean chuckle. This is a dude who cracked open heaven, like, more than once, and now he’s embarrassed about fucking up some plumbing? That's adorable.
He spreads his fingers before closing them in an easy fist and the sound Castiel makes is not human. Or perhaps that’s exactly what it is, wholly and utterly, because for the first time since he fell, Castiel feels alive.
—another drifting back, cupping the soft skin of Castiel’s scrotum, teasing the inside of his thighs. Castiel had never thought to touch himself there, hadn’t known enough to imagine a touch such as that, a sweet cradling counterpoint to the hungry drag of Dean’s mouth.
It's like it's always been here, waiting, this thing between he and Cas. But now Dean knows what he has.
Dean turns away first, moving to his side of the room and chucking his keys and wallet onto the nightstand with, okay maybe unnecessary force.
He rolls his neck in a full circle, ending where he began, and blinks open his eyes. He is, he finds, staring down at his cock.
He usually knocks off the dirty talk by this point, sure, but knowing Cas is easy to key up and how much he can get away with—now that he knows Cas truly won’t crumble—hell, there’s no reason to hold back. “It’s because of you. This is how fucking much I want you.” He gives a little thrust up to make the point, but really his body feels slack all over, that liquid kind of post-come relaxed. It’s amazing and hot and damn if Cas isn’t still loosely nursing Dean’s cock, his light touches almost too much, but Dean’s not ready to let go of the moment yet, and his imagination won’t shut up now that it’s revved up. “Next time,” he says, “Next time I want to come in you. Gonna suck your dick so hard while I open you up. Nice and slow.”
Cas has one hand clenched around the shower curtain, white knuckles in cheap plastic, the other wrapped around something silver that looks suspiciously like the shower handle; which is good, because it gives Dean something to focus on, to stare at, rather than all that slick, beautiful skin.
—this, achingly slow pulls from base to tip. He might push his thumb over the head of Castiel’s cock, might smear precum all over the slit and around the crown.
But then the rolling crashes over something new. Unfamiliar. It’s a tug in his groin, a shot of heat in his hips, it’s—
" Cas purrs, slinking into the spray. His eyes are closed and the color’s coming back to his cheeks and—
Castiel whimpers because if Dean were here, he’d want Dean to tell him that, and if Dean were here, he would. He’d say it. He’d say,
Dean straightens up, eyes bright with mischief, and he grins. “Yeah,” he says, like they’ve sealed a deal. “Yeah, Cas, okay.” He kisses Castiel, a quick brush of lips, and sinks to his knees.
He can’t wait. He doesn’t know how. The Dean in his imagination only ever indulged him, drove him. Never, ever made him wait.
He jerks Castiel harder, harder than Cas has touched himself, and it’s good. Very, very good. It makes something boil in Castiel’s body, the pull and twist of Dean’s hand, makes the tendons in his thighs tremble, makes the pleasure wind in his gut as his cock stiffens. There’s awe in Dean’s steady gaze, and although Castiel wants that, wants to please Dean and for Dean to want him, there’s an uncertainty tangled in that awe, he thinks, as though Dean believes he must be careful, as if Castiel is delicate and might shatter at any moment. And it’s just not true. He may not be the warrior he was, but he’s alive now with a whole new kind of power.
in Dean’s presence and wants Dean to tell him how to make himself come and sneaks in hour-long showers to do just that with Dean’s name on his tongue—apparently, maybe—and
Cas naked and wet and panting, stroking one out against the shower wall? Cas naked and wet and biting off Dean’s name as he comes? Shit.
“Kiss me,” Cas whispers, and this time Dean does, turns his head and shoves their mouths together, lets Cas curl a hand around his neck and lick the hurt little sounds from his lips. There’s a claim laid in this kiss. Dean knows it, feels it absolutely, the same way he did the first time he walked into the bunker back in Lebanon. Like being found, like finding. And maybe, hopefully, never having to leave.
feeling is gone and Castiel wants to mourn it, he does, but he can’t. Not with Dean licking his neck, sucking a row of kisses behind his ear and down his throat, fierce little things that make Castiel shudder and tug at Dean’s tie.
"Yeah, s'fine,” Dean says and waves Cas on, because it’s either that or beckoning him to come hither. “S'all yours.”
He traces that touch down, through the shallow valley between his pectorals. In the mirror, his hand opens, palm to his chest, and his thumb drifts, rubs the nub of one nipple. His body answers with a buzz, a warm shot of bliss that he didn’t expect. He rolls his lips with a hum, taking note.
“Yes,” Castiel shouts, head hitting the wall. “Make me. Dean, make me.” It’s part order, part plea as the hot glide of Dean’s mouth draws nonsense from his own. “Make me come. Make me come for you. I want— God, Dean, fucking
he thinks, scrambling over to where he left his boxers and hopping into them, one leg at a time, praying that Dean doesn’t try the knob. But why would he? There’s no reason for him to—
“Right,” Castiel nods, with a confidence he doesn’t feel. Because how does one do that, exactly? But when he looks back to ask, Dean is already gone.
He’s so caught up in the staring that Cas catches him off guard, bumping into him, the soft press of his side brushing Dean’s arm before he backs up a bare inch.
“Dean,” Castiel says, the word falling out loud and ragged. “Don’t— I need you— Please, you have to—”
He kisses Dean, their tongues slick with water and come, and coaxes Dean to follow he leans back against the shower wall once more. Dean’s hands scrabble between them, undoing his tie and the buttons on his shirt, but Castiel isn’t interested in those. His hands roam lower, pushing the sagging front of Dean’s trousers out of the way and reaching down to run his fingers over Dean’s needy cock. Dean groans and, in one motion, finally pulls his wilted tie from his neck as he melts into Castiel, shoving their bodies together.
But as he’s brushing his teeth, watching the steam streak in smears down the mirror, it hits him: he may not know how to solve the mystery of stubborn arousal, but surely he knows someone who must.
It’s hot and it’s cramped and there’s water everywhere, beating into Dean’s back, catching Castiel in the face and stinging his eyes, but he doesn’t care. He watches the water slide—down his body, tumble over his hips and slip down Dean’s face, drip from his chin. So many showers, Castiel thinks, so many showers to get clean and this is filthy. It’s obscene—the seal of Dean’s lips, the twist of his tongue—and Castiel wants it, God help him, he wants it, all of it.
He turns, searching for those pretty blues, but Cas isn’t looking at him. Nope, his eyes are locked down—down at Dean’s cock as it throbs in his fist, come running over his knuckles before getting chased away by the shower spray.
He leans away to draw breath, to marvel at Dean, at the water caught along his eyelashes and the wet, pink slick of his mouth.
his tongue soft and broad at the base of Castiel's cock, tracing its way up until his lips fold over the top, meeting the O of his fingers.
about his extended showers, muttering about how he’s lucky they don’t pay water bills and threatening that the city will notice conspicuous water usage if he doesn’t knock it off.
“God,” Dean huffs, one hand falling to Castiel’s waist, clutching him, dragging Castiel closer, as if there’s any room left at all. “Cas,” he pants, “are you—? Oh, fuck.” His hips jerk and he makes a helpless little noise. “Jesus. Yeah, you are. You’re so hard for me, aren’t you? Can I— Shit, Cas, please let me touch you.”
From there, he can see, can feel, his chest slope toward his ribs and abdominal muscles, all faintly underscored with shadow by the light above the sink. He wraps his fingers briefly over his tattoo—the only claim he’s made on this body, the only part of it that’s authentically
“All the ways I want you, Cas,” Dean says, his mouth never leaving Castiel’s skin. “The things I could do, ways I could make you come—you don’t even know.”
Dean,” Cas insists, toweling off, and goddamn if he isn’t already sporting a hard on. Dean gets kinda mesmerized for a second, because Cas’s cock really is fucking pretty, but then Cas says, “It was your idea,” and okay, so he has a point.
Dean’s whole body jolts and this time when he opens his mouth, he takes Castiel deeper, drops his fist to the base and pulls Castiel over his tongue, presses the head to the soft sweep inside his cheek and sucks. He was holding back, Castiel thinks dimly, watching Dean’s head rock. Dean had been trying to go slow, trying to, trying, but with both Castiel’s hands back on his head, there’s no way that he can.
"It came out hot," Cas offers. "I tried to adjust it, but then it got too cold. I turned it off, but then when I tried to get it back on, it broke."
“I never thought I’d get to. I never— I never thought you’d want me.” Cas swirls a thumb around the head of Dean’s cock the way Dean had done to him, and the idea of Dean
” Castiel hisses, hands scrabbling as his hips try to thrust into the heat that Dean’s teasing him with, not quite letting him take. “Dean, you—”
At this point, he thinks, whether or not he reaches a conclusion about Dean’s cryptic advice is inconsequential. He just longs to feel . . . not like this, ill at ease and unsatisfied. No. He yearns to be tranquil, at peace. A shower might help, he thinks. The warmth and rhythm might soothe whatever this irritation might be.
