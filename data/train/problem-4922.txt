“You’re a menace, Bucky Barnes. Why do I keep ya?” Reaching over, the artist gave his hair a bit of a tug. “Can’t believe your ma lets you out of the house lookin’ like you do. Your hair is so long it’s just about a rat’s nest.” He laughed as Bucky tried to swat at his hands. “Maybe you should beg one of your dames to cut your hair for ya.”
Tony breathed unsteadily imagining how Steve would probably, when he was like he was on the mural,  would seat himself on him and wrap his arms around him. Steve would probably stroke at his hair just like he described a few times. Tony was bleary-eyed and still seated on the ground when Serena found him. “Can you keep something secret?”
Edward was clearly out to kill Steve. Along with the typical letter, there was also the most stunning drawing of a timepiece the blond had just about ever seen. Each line coursed with life and movement, which was so surprising of something inanimate. It was not typical of what most would consider art, sure, but Steve could see the talent and vision in it. And it just about made him want to melt clean off the bed just looking at it. Carefully, he grabbed a tack and pushed it through the paper and into the wall above his bed. Now, every morning and every evening he would be able to see a small reminder that Edward was real.
“Yeah. It’s a lot of complications I can’t really talk about. Distance, space, time. That I am in a near-constant state of paranoia and fear for my life. But I can’t bring him into this any further than he is,” Tony admitted as he watched Demi nod along. Tony paused the credits to watch at home later.
The other day, Franklin and I listened to the State of the Union when they replayed it on the radio. It made me want to cry. Here is a man claiming that everyone should have the freedom from fear, and yet how many people actually have that? Freedom from fear only exists if you are wealthy, white, Christian, able-bodied, and only seek relationships with the opposite sex. Anyone outside of that has good reason to be afraid, especially now. Do you think we will ever be free of it? These restraints we have put on ourselves - the threat of the Normal?
Tony wrote it out scrunching his face a little as he imitated comic sans again. But figured if it would make it easier for Grant it was worth it. Wasn’t like he’d finally gotten used to handwriting with the Conklin pen. Oh well.
Arnie then retreated behind his board as Michael settled in one of the kitchen chairs. The teacher hummed lightly even as he worked on a bit of whittling he had brought with him. As the warmth of the sunlight bled into Steve’s skin, he began to doze. By the time Arnie shook him awake, the sun had slipped far enough into the sky that the room had grown dim. Steve barely smothered a yawn before sitting up. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to fall asleep.”
I hate so much that people dismiss me immediately because I am small and frail. I hope you would not think poorly of me because of my body, but … I thought it best for you to know right away what I am like, just so you did not get the wrong idea of what I am like. My ma always said it was never wise to fall in love with a dream, because eventually you will wake up. If it helps in your imagining, I have blond hair and blue eyes. Franklin says I should describe myself with prettier words, but language has never been my gift. I would do better to send you a painting - that is the language I excel at.
Crouched in the corner, tucked behind a half dismantled bed frame, was an omega man with thick brown curls and keen, intelligent eyes. “
Grant, we should really talk about where we are. Because I want to do that. To kiss you,  share that intimacy. I want so many things. And I either have to slow down or we need a talk.
And there it was. It was on paper, and he’d said it out loud. Tony tucked the copies he made of photos Steve sent into the wallet and put that beside Ana’s stationery kit for the time being.
And thanks for passing on that kiss. That makes me feel some kind of tickled that by a wonderful proxy I kissed Gypsy Rose Lee. And I am glad the guys are going with you. Still, I am not the happiest to hear that George to some degree spoiled your enjoyment of the place even by a small measure. And I am so glad for Pendragon. Is Mark his muse? The one who helped him come up with the composition or at least inspired it? He does sound really good to know.
“Who are they?” Bucky eyed the building with suspicion, especially as he could hear music playing from where they stood on the street.
Rubbing at his eyes, Steve hiccuped back his tears. He hated when he got emotional like this; it was utterly irrational. And yet, he could not stop crying. So, blinking through the tears, he quickly signed off his letter and stuffed it in an envelope. He then gathered the comic pages together and shuffled back to bed, holding them tightly to his chest.
A small smile flickered across his lips. Edward had a way of talking - or writing, rather - that made the tension ease from Steve’s body. He would never admit it, but it was just as soothing as sitting beside Bucky while the brunet read a book out loud. It felt a little bit like home. And the comic! Sure, Edward was not a perfect artist - sometimes his proportions were off and his figures felt a bit stiff - but there was a charm to his style. Steve could easily imagine
And thank you. Honestly, it is not my usual style. George had a real specific vision for what he wanted, and I think I was able to translate it well. He said I should probably be able to do a couple more things for them, through the year. I am going to be attending a few get-togethers he is hosting, just so he can introduce me to more potential clients. Not sure if I really believe him, but he said I have the sort of talent money cannot buy. I think he is just trying to convince me to get to know him better if you know what I mean. He is too sharp for my taste, though. Now if Ben were single, that I would consider. I have always been a bit weak for a man who was musical. But he and Peter are so perfect together, I do not think I could ever get in the way of that.
Arnie took a little step back from Michael and cleared his throat. “If you could strip the bed down so it’s just the sheets, that would be good. Then I’ll need you naked and on the bed.”
"Ty, babe, they know me. And I thought I told you I was going to be a little late. Unless the schedule changed?" Tony asked, looking from the group and then back at Ty.
That family friend, I think without meaning to, left my grandfather lacking in being a good parent to my dad. I think he kept seeing the friend as some unattainable person to find. Some proof he did something good. Didn't leave much time for him to be a father. So my dad never learned.
, which he had chosen because Ella made her feature debut in the movie. He had been delighted to hear her sing again, even though it was nowhere near the same as experiencing the magic of her voice in person. While the movie was not particularly great, it was funny enough - something both men needed at that moment in their lives.
Settling back down against the wall, Steve then turned his attention to the letter. The first half of the letter made a soft smile curl the edges of the blond’s lips. He was not sure how he felt about being called a ‘little treat of a man,’ sure, but … maybe it was okay if Edward called him that. So long as the other man did not call him short. Nothing quite got Steve going quite like being called short.
“My family is in possession of letters exchanged between the artist of these and someone important in his life. I… needed to see them for myself,” Tony explained as he followed her quickly.
It was Tony’s turn to be a little gobsmacked. He chuckled a moment. “You think I’m pretty?” Tony grinned. “You’re like a Disney prince, and you think I’m pretty. Thanks. “
You will literally never believe who I met. Pendragon invited me to meet some of his new friends, and he gave me no warning at all. So, I walk into this place and someone takes my coat. I turn around, and it is W. H. Auden. The W. H. Auden. And I thought to myself, “Oh, wow, this could not get more surreal.” I was wrong. Peter Pears, Benjamin Britten, Carson McCullers, and George Oliver were all there too. Franklin nearly pissed himself when he saw Gypsy Lee Rose was there too. He swooned after her like a moonstruck calf.
And I am not trying to kill you. Just tease at you. You make it too easy to do, really. I bet you live in some fancy place with transoms and fans – the sorts of posh amenities that make it so you do not roast to death in your fancy suits. Me, I am lucky if we get so much as a breeze the entire summer in our building. Gets real miserable, whether you are inside or out. Being mostly undressed is a necessity more than anything.
While Steve would not be able to give his fella a leather jacket – the kind of quality Eddie deserved was far outside of the blond’s budget – the thought did spark another idea. While the jacket he was holding was not suitable to be worn, there was enough good leather it could always be made into something else. The idea of buying a fresh pair of pants completely slipped from Steve’s mind as he carried the jacket up to the counter, passing over his meagre collection of coins in return. He would have to ask George if he had any sinew thread he could spare, as that would work best for sewing the fabric. And he could ask Dinah or Winifred to help him with the actual design. Oh! And he could ask Penny to help him tool designs into the leather; she was an art school friend of his with a particular gift when it came to that sort of thing.
Bright laughter followed Bucky out the door as the blond made his promises to be on time and properly attired. Though he was not Jewish, Steve appreciated the devotion the Barnes family had for their faith. And he was always grateful that Mrs. Barnes considered him so much a part of the family that he was expected for their sabbath worship, even though he was Catholic to the core. It was not quite home, being with the Barneses, but it was something close.
After they had finished looking at the mural, including Tony taking quite a few photos of it, Serena tugged on the end of her scarf. “So, the second mural is actually over in Brooklyn. Do you want to just take a cab or…?” She raised an eyebrow at him, unsure of how the billionaire preferred to travel. If it were up to her, she would just take public transit, because grad school budgets were tight.
It’s going to be difficult for people under Hitler’s reign of terror. People will need to carefully band together to help those in danger hide. Or at least get out of danger. And Grant, don't give up on your guys, yourself, or me. You will be fine. I’m banking on it. I am too. They are great.
Your gallery wall is lovely. Makes me feel all fizzy looking at it. And the frame you picked for the painting looks great. I feel flattered that you would care enough about my art to hang it up like that.
The Barneses were kind enough to not comment on the obvious war of emotions on Steve’s face. Instead, George loudly carried on a conversation about what Hilter and his goons were doing, talking about the laws being passed to prevent the Jewish people of Germany from holding certain types of jobs. Which of course led to Bucky griping about the new immigration policies being enacted by the American government. In another life, Steve always supposed George Barnes would’ve gone into political science and Bucky would have gone to some fancy ivy league school. Both of them were whip smart and loved to share their opinions on anything. Seemed like the sort of things academics liked to do. And usually Steve would be right there with them, jabbing the table with his finger as he argued for social services and equal wealth distribution. But not on October 15th.
“Sure am,” the other man agreed. “The absolute worst.” He leaned over to steal a kiss from those pouting lips. “Makes me question your taste, what with you keepin’ me around.”
Tony adjusted his sleeves dully. He wondered if there’s any point to even going to his outing tonight. He was meeting Ty for dinner and inevitably another night of dancing. Half of it not even with him. Liquor and probably some kind of substance. And who knew if there was any way if he’ll be able to do much of anything.
“You are even more transparent than most of our managers. A few of us are so deep in the closet we want someone happy damn it. So with that. Go write your letter, and I’m catching my plane. See you,” Demi waved, and Tony watched the outrageously tall volleyball player go out the door.
Sitting down beside Steve, the sculptor wrapped an arm around his shoulders and drew him into a hug. “I know how much this fella means to you, so I wanted to do a good job.”
“So since you’re not going to be my employed trainer, are you going to ask Pepper out?” Tony grinned as he watched Maria scrunch her face.
Steve sank into the narrative as poor Bella, the wife of the newlywed couple, began to believe she was going mad. Items around the house would go missing or appear in the wrong locations, and her husband, Paul, would accuse her of having displaced them. Paul slowly began to push harder and harder on Bella, convincing her she was going mad. By the time Bella began to hear footsteps in the supposedly vacant rooms above hers, Bucky had all but vanished inside of his coat - hiding from the unsettling horror of watching the woman come utterly undone. Steve, on the other hand, wanted nothing more than to punch the husband right in the kisser. The way Paul would go from blindingly charming to absolutely cruel was the worst a person could be, especially as he weaponized it against the woman he was supposed to love.
Sunshine, I am going to try to snap a picture of Maria’s face when I tell her you’re using her gift to also teach Franklin’s sisters how to kick ass. And yes they would. They would definitely take over the world and we would be better for it. It would be a much more efficient world with them running it. Probably nicer too.
The second is a wallet. I know you probably have a bunch of them, knowing how big a chunk of change you probably carry on the daily. But, I thought maybe this was a way you could keep a piece of me and your bots next to your heart without making a fuss. Plus, the jacket I salvaged it from was no use to anybody as it was, so this gave it a new life.
Been real cold lately, seems like. Yesterday Franklin said it was the coldest weather on record for the day - a full fifteen degrees below what we usually see. My lungs have been letting me know in no uncertain terms how they feel about that kind of weather. I have a bit of a cough creeping in, and I can only hope it does not develop into something worse. If nothing else, being out of a job means that I can stay bundled up at home. Franklin’s ma made me a new blanket with random bits of yarn leftover from some of her other projects. It is not much to look at - kind of hideous, really - but it is as warm as anything. And I was able to patch that hole in the windowsill like you told me to. It worked a treat.
It has come to my attention that in the MCU the 1932 Ford Flathead Roadster we see a picture of Howard Stark and a Tiny Tony working on belonged to his father. As a reminder the one Tony is working on with Rhodey was Purchased in an auction. Howard had one but for his own reasons, Edward Stark sold it if he did. "Because it reminded him of people he could never live up to."
Dating just for dates and social interaction was interesting. Without substances or the push for sex, everyone did become that much more interesting.  As Tony worked through the calendar starting with May, it became clear this approach to dating led to far more interesting friendships. And requests for second dates. The most surprising was July: a statuesque six-foot three-inch blonde with long, long arms and legs that had tried modelling on a whim. Demi played volleyball, trying to go pro, and seemed like the type who should try acting.
Your skill as an artist is amazing and you’ve got me flustering a bit. I build and design a lot of things. Weapons primarily, but I am working on communication devices, some engines. I’ve had enough schooling and learn quickly enough that I can master a lot of things quickly. Maybe I should build you a suit of armor or give you a shield. Sounds like you have a lot of bruises a lot of the time there.
“Maybe.” He turned to head back towards the building. “It’s the smell, isn’t it? That bothers you. In there, I mean.” Steve gave an offhand gesture back toward the base they’ve travelled around.  The omega’s scent had been rank with anxiety since the moment he’d stepped into the room with the other prisoners.
Tony disappeared down to the workshop, where the letter draft was still waiting on the work table. He skimmed over it, making a few corrections, before grabbing the Conklin pen and the nice paper. The motion of rewriting the letter helped to soothe him further, helping his thoughts fall more orderly within the storminess of his brain. More than that, though, he smiled a moment at the thought of Grant, his little spitfire. Well, not his. The spitfire who, against all odds, would be reading Tony’s thoughts on a movie more than sixty years old. Shaking his head at the thought, he let the ink dry before sending the letter.
“Thanks,” Tony replied, watching how he moved. This still felt surreal. “It’s how I made myself feel better as a kid. Build something, take it apart. Fix it. Make it better. I’d steal things, educate myself on anything I could get my hands on.”
Tony nodded. “The war did that to them too. Just shows how careful we’ll have to be after that. Avoid the bottle,” Tony gave a little smile and looked out in the dark again. “You getting enough to eat?”
My ma sends her regards for the flowers. They were very pretty. Pretty, pretty, perttty. Got her bells of Ireland, because she and my dad they came from Ireland. Liek.. immmigrants. From Ireland. And peonies. Poenies? You know. Flowers. And hydrangea. That’s such a weird lookin word. Hy-dran-gea. You ever wonder about where people decide to name flowers? Because, like, do they just look at it and some fella is like “that looks like a hyydrangeon.” And everybody else is all “Yeah Jim that for sure is a hydrangeo.” So everybody just starts callin it that. Wht if someone else called it by a different name before that, but they weren’t as popular as Jim so nobody used that name? Do we just go with the popular name or the first name? Or is the first name not a real name because nobody used it?
Some said that the serum made Steve a superior alpha; Bucky was always quick to correct them. Even when he had been tiny, Steve had been the kind to command a room. “He had more fight in him than his body knew what to do with,” the beta liked to say. “So he had to get bigger to match that heart of his.”
I blame capitalism. Those punks are always makin it about who has the most money and knows the right people. THey don’t care about the little guy. They don’t care about women. All they care about is if they have money and if they can get their dicks wet. Screw them. Did yknow that my ma had to be burried - buried? in the poor part of the gaveyard? Just because we werent from one of the old families that had been donating to the diosees since the beginning of time. Absolutely gets my goat that these punks just talk out their asses about being like Christ and doing Christian goodness, but then they hide the poor as far out of sight as they possibly can. That ain’t right, Eddie. Ain’t Christlike. He would want them to treat everybody the same.
Utterly flummoxed, Steve could barely manage a nod. Why hadn’t Arnie warned him that W. H. Auden was going to be there? And then things truly became surreal. As they moved into the parlor, which was dominated by a large marble fireplace, Steve and Bucky came face to face with even more famous faces. Draped out on one sofa, a glass of sherry in hand, was a brunette bombshell with eyes that seemed to simultaneously know all of your secrets and find them laughable. Gypsy Lee Rose. Curled up beside Lee was a little wisp of a woman with a prominent nose and a long, round face.
Tony changed to a regular pen "Friday can you bring up I guess… comic font." Tony mimicked that for the rest of the letter.
Tony stared. And kept staring. “Holy shit,” he finally said after a moment. “The one that is across the whole damn bar with Louis Armstrong in another section. That was all you?” Tony asked, reeling. He wasn’t sure what his face was doing but this was news to him.
P.S. As promised, here is the photo back. It is beautiful. You can see in their eyes just how much they loved each other.
Grant, I think both of the restaurants are kosher. If not, they serve a lot of latke and matzo ball soup for not being Jewish. But I will happily have pizza with you.
Catching sight of the brunet, Ty clapped slowly.  “If it isn’t the genius, finally descending from his throne to be with us mere mortals.” Once Tony was close enough, the blond grabbed his wrist just a little too tightly and growled in his ear: “Tony, you’re late. Didn’t I tell you to be here an hour ago? You’ve embarrassed me in front of my friends.”
April in New York was still on the chilly side - at least for someone like Steve. But there was sun and the promise of summer warming things up enough that everyone seemed to be spilling outside. The streets were full of the sounds of laughing kids and women exchanging news in at least five different languages. It added a softness to the usual bustle of the city; a humanity the cars and other vehicles lacked. Steve thrived on it.
“Shame I probably can’t say, if I die and am not back in six months it is Obadiah’s fault,” Tony muttered. Tony smiled as he earned a snort from Jarvis.
Steve hesitated, knowing what Bucky meant. “I am sure he’ll do his best, Buck. Just like you do.” He combed his fingers lightly through the brunet’s thick hair. With his free hand, he folded open the letter and slowly began to read the words. “Eddie apologizes for how heavy the package was, by the way.”
In the first sketch, the viewer seemed to be walking in from the kitchen, coming through the double doors towards where Steve was sleeping. The angle not only showed off the fine lines of his figure, but also the comics on the wall and the view out the window. Second was a sketch that seemed to be looking down at Steve’s prone figure from the foot of the bed, allowing the eye to move from his toes all the way up to where his face was hidden behind his shoulder. Then was a sketch taken more from the level of sitting at the end of the mattress. It meant that the primary focus was on the way Steve’s ribcage joined his back and the curve of his arms. But, just over the shape of his bicep, one eyebrow and a gently closed eye could be made out underneath the mop of his hair. The final sketch must have involved Arnie standing on a chair, as it was looking down from above at Steve laying out on the bed. In that sketch his face was completely hidden by his hair and shoulder, but Arnie had taken pains to mark out some of the most prominent freckles running down Steve’s back.
Mary and all the saints, though, Edward certainly had an imagination! He was clearly a futurist with a wonderful ability to see a multitude of possibilities. A time-travelling stone helping the knight find what he had lost felt … uncanny, though Steve could not put a finger on why. And the Edward of the future, with his quiet advice, made the blond’s heart ache a little. Someone of his own. That felt impossible, if Steve were honest. But maybe, if he were very lucky, his own Lord Kitt would someday be ready for a joint adventure. It was a sweet fantasy if nothing else.
Wishing and hope are all the things we have sometimes, Grant. Don’t give up on that. And don’t give up on me. I think my friend group is way more flexible than you give them credit for. And for getting strange looks about being in my company, so what? I’d get strange looks anyway. You won’t always be starving. And with a bit of grease and less posturing I’d blend in so well anywhere that if you didn’t know my face, you wouldn’t see me.
As they came up to the florist, Steve slowed. He usually only managed to buy a single carnation, but the weight of Edward’s coins was heavy in his pocket. It was tempting to simply send the money back, tell the other man thanks but no thanks. But … sending the money was Eddie’s way of trying to be there for Steve during a difficult day. Would it have been so different if the engineer were standing beside him and offering to buy flowers for his fella’s mother?
After dropping off the letter, Steve settled down to start sketching different ideas for a possible mural. One of his favourites involved a diner scene, where Americans from all different backgrounds filled the space. And, of course, he was sure to draw a table with Maria and Rhodey sitting chatting over coffee. Edward was happily eating a piece of pie while seated on a stool. Arnie and Michael were picking a song from the jukebox. On a whim, Steve drew himself sitting next to Edward, leaning in to steal some pie.
Can I ask you something … a bit more intimate? You do not have to answer if you do not want to, but I am awful curious. What is it like making love to someone? I just … is it worth all the fuss?
Okay, Jarvis or Rhodey hit a gold mine, Tony covered his mouth to smother a laugh as he read. The guy was cute from the sounds of it. Maybe a touch shy? Tony chuckled to himself as he continued reading. The fact this letter was never opened until that moment made him feel a little sad for the guy. Tony figured the letter had been confiscated or maybe just never sent, meaning the little artist had never gotten his hoped-for reply.
“Perish,” the teacher drawled. “Wither clean away because the muses claimed your soul in exchange for disappointing them.”
“It sounds like you’ve got a lot of things you are fearing. That can’t be good for your heart old man.” Tony lounged against the couch “But... Yeah. Those. Who would do that?”
. The detective fiction story he was assigned was a bit gruesome, but some part of Steve relished the chance to draw something different. And the editors loved Steve’s stark use of colours so much that they invited him to do the cover for July as well. Arnie had to ultimately help the blond pick the right shade of red for his work, but it ended up turning out swell. Steve ended up sending Tony copies of both magazines when they were released. February also saw Steve choosing an Abbott and Costello film called
It took a small amount of digging, the movie Tony found that seemed to match the one Grant was watching was internationally called Gaslight. Tony sat in the garage watching it with a bowl of Popcorn as Jarvis left hearing what he was going to watch.
"Call help. No shame in it. Call help, give numbers of the combatants, anything they can use to help," Maria said softly. Both behind him and in the earpiece.
“Having a personal driver could seem like something I would have if I was drunk for extended amounts of time,” Tony muttered tapping at his chin while Maria raised an eyebrow.
. The zany antics of a sailor trying to win the heart of the cold “Countess” of the swing club in just four days was certainly entertaining fare. Steve’s cheeks hurt from laughing so much, and Tony couldn’t help feeling bad for the poor Countess when she found out her beloved had been bet to woo her. But, as things did at that time, everything worked out for the best. The sailor fell hard for his dame, and she ultimately forgave him. It was not lost on Tony the irony of his choice of film.
“So he’s definitely your artist now, huh?” Maria smirked leaning forward on her seat. Tony laughed as he leaned back against his own chair. Well, so much for that plan.
The younger man laughed. “I know. That’s why I want a picture. I’m trying to capture the spirit of Coney, and … I dunno. There’s something about you. So can I?”
Tony grinned as he sat on the stool nearest to the mailbox and dived into the letter. “Friday, mind letting me dictate a draft to you? Let's title it draft one with today's date. Starting in 5”
If I did everything I wanted I would be making a time machine work. For sooo many reasons. There’s just a factor I can’t figure out or use to get all the way there. I’d also want to take you back with me. We deserve some adventures when nobody would damn well care.
I might be wrong, but I see something in you in the police officer. It’s the “I can save you” attitude. How you run into those fights. By the way, how are the bruises doing today? I want you to be careful about the gut shots you take. I bet Franklin can back me up on this: there is something in you like that officer.
Sunshine, Grant, you can't control your nightmares but you have just made a decision for me. There is nothing wrong with your intelligence.  I don't think you are alone with that difficulty with letters and numbers. But there are ways to make that easier. Including yes, having people read things to you.
Your nightmares, though… Are you sure they are just dreams? That seems like the sort of thing a mind would not just invent. Either way, they seem real awful. And I am sorry you have trouble sleeping. If I could, I would pet your hair and sing you lullabies like my ma used to do for me when I was sick. That helped me get to sleep even when my lungs were trying to come out my throat. It has a way of making a body feel safe to have someone close, caring about you like that. I know we have not known each other long, but … it does not feel that way. It feels like I have known you for years; it is so easy to talk to you. And I would want to do that for you - help you feel safe.
“If it means you’re not drinking and at some point, I will meet your charming man from the forties. I don’t see any reason for you to stop. I’m certain you are looking into potential consequences already. So why should it bother me?” Jarvis raised his eyebrows waiting for some kind of answer as Tony relaxed.
He was almost mechanical in his responses when they got to the church. Every motion was an ingrained habit for Steve (Bucky not so much), and before he quite knew it, the service was over. Once the crowd had dissipated a bit, he lit a candle and offered a prayer for his mother. And, some traitorous part of his heart prayed for Edward too. That the other man would be happy and safe. If love was of God, Steve reasoned, then surely hoping for someone’s happiness was a good thing. He hoped.
As for myself, I’m of… mixed heritage. My mother is Italian, so I have her coloring. Warm skin, dark eyes, and hair that can’t decide if it wants to curl or go every which way. Otherwise I’ve been told I look like my father and grandfather. Which I guess is kind of a mixed bag since reportedly they weren’t always the nicest men.
So much time had passed. Their relationship had changed from a flighty, delicate thing into what Steve considered a true friendship. The love he felt was not based on idle dreams or reading between the lines of the letters. Instead, it was rooted in the very real person he felt he knew as well as he knew himself. But his fears that their ideas of a relationship were incompatible still loomed large in his mind. How could he test the waters and ascertain Eddie’s stance?
“Now Carson, play nice,” came a warm tenor voice from the other sofa. There, Steve discovered, sat Peter Pears and Benjamin Britten, the famous British duo. Peter was an extremely talented tenor, sometimes called the voice of the generation, while Benjamin was one of the great living composers. Even Bucky felt his knees go weak at the sight of them. “Don’t scare the kids away yet. They are quite easy on the eyes.” Peter laughed as Benjamin lightly pinched his side. “What! They are. Both of them.”
Do you have any ideas for things you’d want me to design? I’m down to design silly stuff because I can’t show the board everything since Obie is bound to use some of it somehow. And I’m starting to become a bit paranoid that stuff is missing. If I could lock everything and make sure Jarvis was safe, I would just take a vacation. So, I guess I just need a mental vacation - fun things to design. Do you have anything you are looking for?
When the next letter came, Steve was beyond thrilled. He had worried that Edward would get bored of him and stop writing; but, so far the consistent correspondence was nothing short of intoxicating. It helped the blond understand, at least a little, what it must be like for men like Arnie, who were able to go to the clubs and make close acquaintances with each other. It was a little bit like having his own fella.
So how has your practice been going? I just hope you and Franklin don’t hurt each other too much by mistake practicing from the book. I still need to restock the ice in my deep freeze since I landed badly after a throw and needed an ice bath. My back was trying to murder me after that.
What wasn’t helpful was his imagination pondering just how much Grant would bruise up from all the marks Tony wants to leave on his skin. Tony sent the note and drawing before he made his way straight to the bathroom for a shower. And if there were a few groans in there as he stood under the hot water…  Well. That was between him and his hands.
By the time they got home, Steve bid his best friend a wordless farewell before heading into his apartment. His body was buzzing with excitement, and the thought of going to sleep was miles away. So, he settled down at his desk and lit the lamp.
“Good,” Tony heaved a sigh. Aunt Peg might be able to help him. It was that dire of a situation he wasn’t even born yet.
Suddenly apprehensive, Steve picked up the envelope and weighed it in his hands. “Sure is some fancy paper,” he said slowly. “What they doin’ fixing a Joe like me up with someone who writes on stuff like this?”
“Sometimes it’s better to know for certain,” Arnie agreed. “And where is that Steve Rogers fight, huh? I never seen you run scared before. Why you starting now?”
I am grateful for Franklin’s pop, though. He is a real good guy, and he did his best to help raise me. Taught me and Franklin how to shave, though I almost never need it. He tries to help us find work, and he told us how to be safe when getting with dames. But it is different, you know? He will never quite be mine.
She shot him a confused look. “The hotel? No.” Her eyes narrowed. “Dr. Stark, if you are trying to get me to a hotel room, I feel it necessary to inform you that I think dicks are disgusting.”
As summer slowly bled into fall, Steve’s correspondence with the mysterious engineer continued. They talked about life, their opinions on art, and even more about their various preferences. The pair even developed a few inside jokes, which delighted the blond to no end. By the time September was drawing to a close, they were clearly friends… if not something a little bit more. Well, Steve hoped it was a bit more. He was utterly enchanted by Edward. The man was witty and sharp, but there was a brightness to him that made it feel like a perfect summer afternoon reading his words. And Steve would need every ounce of that warmth in the coming weeks.
Tony placed the final piece on his box pyramid as he heard the flag raise on the mailbox. The brunet cringed as Dum E barreled into the pyramid, taking part of it out in his rush for the mailbox. “Oh Dum-e,” he sighed, still casually dangling in the air. “Alright bring it to me.” He still had a notepad and pencil in his pocket at least. The sound of some distressed beeping as Dum-E wasn’t completing his command made Tony whirl around in the harness to give the bot an unimpressed look. “I did not install a telescopic arm on you for you to forget it’s there. You can definitely reach me,” Tony sighed as he used the projected keyboard to manually get Dum-E to pass him the letter. Tony read it as he carefully sat and swung, legs kicking comfortably. And, well, since he was there already, he remained in the harness and typed out the first draft of his reply one-handed as he read.
Later that evening, he traded the tube, which had the note inside it as well, with Bucky. In return, he got a rather thick package. Raising his eyebrows, Steve weighed it in his hands. “This must be the surprise I was promised.”
“He talks about another artist in his letters. I’m working on sorting through who that is but I would want to see if I could get his art into the public as well. He talks about how Bucky and this other friend would help him pick colours because he was colour blind.” Tony frowned a moment before the name of it occurred to him “Protanopia. He had trouble with reds and blue. I just need to look into it. I’m sorry I didn’t come in more prepared for this actually. “ Tony quickly snapped a couple of pictures of Serena’s backpack after he took one of them in front of the mural. He sent both to Demi who was getting ready for their dinner date. “That’s why this one is in Sepia tones”
Reaching into his pocket, Steve carefully counted out a full seventy-five cents for a bouquet. The florist was able to make a pretty arrangement with bells of Ireland, peonies, and hydrangea - all in the soft blues, pinks, and yellows Sarah had loved so much. Taking the wrapped package in hand, the blond cradled the flowers to his chest and started towards Holy Cross Cemetery. When Sarah had died, Stevie had worked himself nearly into his own grave to afford getting her buried in a Catholic cemetery, but it had been worth it. He knew how important it was to her to be buried on holy ground and have all of her rites done correctly. And, in a way, it was a small mercy that she was not buried closer to where Steve lived. If she had been, it would have been too tempting to spend hours sitting beside her grave, dreaming of a world that no longer existed.
I know the position we are in is real difficult. You cannot come here, and there is no way I can go to you. And there is also the worry about your safety. Me? I doubt Obie would even notice someone like me, let alone be able to do harm to me. But I can understand why you would be concerned for me. If Obie knew who I was, he might try to hurt me to get at you. Is that something he could honestly do, though? Find me, I mean. Hurt me.
And sure, I can draw that. Kitt being from around then would probably insist on getting him getting a haircut though, sweetheart. Or at least a really good wash. But can we compromise down to a submarine car and some really cool planes? No? Okay, I’ll try. It would be hell to try to organize traffic with flying cars. It’s hard enough with planes, Grant.
Tony sat a minute theorizing about the twenty-one-year-old: Brooklyn, artist, gay as hell. The guy would be fine. He would have made some friends with other artists on his own - maybe even in his art classes. Surely one of them would have snatched up the cute kid, making the letter hopefully obsolete. Tony finished reading it with a small smile; the kid had a way with words. More fight than one body could stand. His first thought was of either an angry kitten or a chihuahua. And if this Grant guy lived up to that, he’d probably punch Tony in the face for that thought.
“He had to have made a living as an artist somehow, and you don’t get that being a hermit. Why hadn’t more people been called forward? Because something was being protected,” Tony mused as he stretched out on the couch. He glanced at their tidily piled dishes and then the lamp.
“So this is Tony Stark in his natural habitat. With a boyfriend who is a technology disaster from the sounds of it. What the hell is your life? And is there a way for any of us to help you unfuck this up so you can talk properly to your guy?” Demi laughed and flashed a smile that would probably make Aphrodite jealous.
So, Steve dolled up as best he could. He carefully parted his hair and dressed in a thick sweater instead of his usual button-down shirt. Then came the brightly colored scarf, his thickest jacket, and the fine pair of mittens. By the time he stepped out onto the landing, Bucky was already waiting for him. “I hope this is better than the last time we went out with Arnie,” he drawled.
There are a couple of options for your bath. One is just something that heats the tub itself the other is a circulating system. For your situation, take a bath in a small room that will hold the heat more, bubble bath if you can get it to bubble up, it does insulate the surface of the water. And put something around your tub that will insulate it more. Now if you’re making a place you have a couple of options. One is a circulating system that uses heated tubing to keep the water the same temp you had when you were filling the tub. It uses suction to keep it circulating. The other is heated tubes that just heat the walls of the tub.
He had a thing that fucked with time in his own lab, surely he could figure out something that could bring him through time. But Tony didn’t have all the pieces for that puzzle - yet. He needed to focus on what he can do, which is to write Grant back another letter.
Getting out of the tub and onto his handily towel-covered couch was easier than getting into the tub at least. “Friday, remind me to thank Maria again,” he muttered as he dropped onto it.
And honestly, I am glad you had Jarvis. It sounds like he was a better father to you than your blood father. What is he like, your Jarvis? If I were to ever cross paths with him, I want to know what I am getting into with meeting someone so important to you.
“Yes, you said that out loud. Interesting gift?” Pepper mused; he could hear the little smile in her voice. Tony heard the faint sound of her working at her drink. “Especially from that date.”
Shrugging a slim shoulder, the blond smiled. “I dunno. Heard the play was real good from some of my friends in art school. When I heard it was gonna be a picture, I thought it would be good to see it.” A wicked smile danced across his lips. “Plus, if it’s as scary as they say, you can always bring one of your girlfriends to see it sometime.”
The alpha shot him a wry smile over his shoulder. “If you’re a spy, then we would want to keep your presence masked anyway.” Moving into the main room, Steve crossed over to where Bucky and Gabe were talking. “I found one more. But get this, he’s American.”
“If Steve Rogers was not at least 50% gay, I will eat a ghost pepper,” Serena said firmly. “I bet he was completely gay, but the whole Peggy situation makes things complicated. But still.”
He looked at Tony, his eyes all sparkly and bright. “That was me,” he agreed gently. And took a little step closer to the omega. “Arnie, Michael, and Buck were seated at the same table. You’ll have to look again when you go back.”
“Yeah. Guess you ain’t managed to scare him off just yet. Pretty thick little envelope, too.” Bucky slid his hands into his pockets and rocked on his heels. “Seems like a good sign to me. If he were sick of your mugging, he would’a just wrote you a quick note and been done with it all.”
Ty’s face pulled into a tight smile. “Why don’t you go get us drinks, sweetness? Make it up to us?” The blond dropped down onto his seat. “I’ll have a whiskey sour.” He turned to talk to one of the women at the table, Tony’s presence already dismissed.
Shrugging, the man curled in close to Steve’s lean body. “It’s fine, Stevie. They’ll come back around.” It went without saying that Bucky knew, sooner or later, he would land in the military. And then the women would be interested in him for all the wrong reasons. The men tried to not talk too often about the draft or the war, just because it made Bucky mercurial. “So what did your boy get ya, anyway?”
“Alright then,” Demi muttered standing to her full 6 ft 3 and shoving her feet into her sandals. “It’s hilarious you two have already discussed that. I’m glad you’re happy.”
I think you are worth reading, and writing to. It sounds like you’ve been kind of adopted by Franklin’s family. Speaking as someone who’s had two different families pseudo adopt him, do you find that it’s really hard to say no to their cooking? Because my friend’s mom, Rhonda, makes miracles happen. And also tells me you’re a good person. People want to care for you, which believe it or not is a good thing.
It took a little practice before Jarvis and Tony are able to work out something legible. The writing is not as practiced as the hand on the letter, but it is passable enough. When Tony brought the pen back to his lab, the flag was raised. Tony stared at it, knowing for a fact no one had come downstairs. Tony opened the box, finding a letter inside. He blinked. Turned away. Looked back in the box. Somehow, the letter was still there.
Tony leaned back in his seat realizing he’d been leaning forward for a fair while now. He blinked rapidly, taking stock of himself. A bit of water probably wouldn’t hurt. He should probably move, but his limbs weren’t cooperating yet. He glanced at the notepad he’d been scribbling on. There were at least seven variations on ‘I don’t normally hug people, but I need to hug this woman.’ A couple ‘let the dog stay’ comments. And himself agreeing with the “knock his block off” statement.
A thoughtful look graced Arnie’s features as he glanced up from preparing his drawing board. “Roll around on the sheets a bit. Muss up your hair and the bedding.”
So then tell me about what you like for food, where you would like to go. I am extremely spoiled for choice,  and sticking with Jarvis makes it hard to decide.  Ana's cookbooks and the ones he has are divine.  But really, for me, it's good food done right. I could happily eat some pastrami on rye as long as the rye is fresh and the mustard brown and the pastrami delicious.  Jarvis misses the Carnegie Deli every week we aren't in Manhattan.  He swears it gets better every time he goes - even though there's a place in California I am prepared to fight him tooth and nail that I think is better.
“Yeah,” Tony figured it was as good of an answer as any. Especially since ending up here his goal had been to trash it. “Was gonna make a hell of a lot of trouble, but it looks like you guys are beating me to it.” Tony finally stood and sighed heavily. He’d been looking at Steve Rogers for at least 40 seconds and he wasn’t vanishing. That really was Steve Rogers. He’d known that voice in his sleep. In all his twenty-two years of life, he spent far too many years listening to Steve Rogers.
Of my parents I missed my mom more; I'm sorry you lost yours young too. I would have appreciated that, just time with you shared in some way.  I think I try to get things for people; I don't mean it in an attempt to buy people’s affection, but I want to see people taken care of.
Reaching over, Bucky squeezed the nape of Steve’s neck. “You deserve good things, kid. I hope the dream lasts a long, long time.” It went unspoken between them that the letters with Edward were, for all intents and purposes, nothing more than a fleeting fancy. In the world they lived in, there were clear expectations of what was right and proper. Two men falling in love and sharing their lives together was so far outside of that limit it could be a death sentence for them both. But for now, in these golden moments, Steve let himself forget the real world. Instead, he imagined a place where one day, if he were lucky, maybe he could share his life with another man. They could build a home and family together, maybe have a house in the countryside where the air would be better for Steve’s lungs. When his dreams got particularly wild, the blond even imagined them raising a baby together, getting a dog, maybe even a cat too just because. His dreams were as big as the sky and just as impossible to hold on to.
Sitting in the living room, both men seemed to cling to their glasses as the subject, at last, turned to the subject of Edward and Maria’s deaths. “I had suspected as such. If you were along that night, you certainly would have died too. And the only person who would have benefitted would have been Stane,” Jarvis said, carefully swirling the bourbon in his glass. “If you think there were any bullet wounds or strangulation marks, then it confirms everything I’ve feared,” Jarvis said with a sigh, looking over at Tony.
So I am continuing to write now I am home finally. No bruises on Obie, though, as much as I wish there were. I am trying to keep from stupid shit. Basically trying not to poke the hibernating bear. Got anything you want me to design? Or should I just do some doodles of Lord Kitt and Sir Grant in different suits of armour?
I’ve been told I’m pretty insufferable too, so we’d probably drive everyone else crazy. Maybe you need a little more ego to keep up with me. And I call you that because you are stunning. You sound like you have this energy that draws people in. Add that to your big hands, strong nose, and stubborn as hell urge to protect people and fight. I don’t think having a little pride in your appearance would lead you to lose any of that sunshine.
I trust you to protect me. And I mean it when I say I am willing to wait for you. You may have gathered this by now, but I am real stubborn about the things I really care for. That includes you, honey.
Steve gave a little nod. The two beta’s relaxed at the gesture, and Bucky moved to signal one of the other men over. “We’ll see about getting you some food and cleaned up,” the brunet explained to the omega. “Make sure you’re not injured. Alright?”
His dick was expressing vehement opinions, and what was he going to do about that? Not that this was the first time, sure, but this response was a direct correlation to what Grant looked like. How was he supposed to keep things platonic when everything about those sketches screamed something more?
“No, I guess not,” Tony lied as he made his way to the shower to finally clean off the previous night. Did he have to go in today? He’d find out after a shower he figured.
“Wystan! So good to see you, handsome.” The pair exchanged a quick kiss on the cheek before Arnie gestured to his guests. “This is Steve Rogers, the artist I was telling you about. And this is his platonic soulmate, Bucky Barnes.”
When George went to show me to my room, he decided to try to put the moves on me. I told him I had a fella, and he did not much like that. I got him to leave me alone, but Lee leant me her slicker so I could go home. She said you sound like a charmer. Wants to meet you the next time you come into town. I told her I could not promise anything, though. But I do think you would get along. You kind of remind me of each other, in some ways. In good ways.
Hello reminder they are in the war how are you doing? Thanks for keeping up with this so far and we have lots of adventure coming up.
If turning twenty-one had been a disappointment to Tony Stark, then twenty-two was an absolute bore. He had everything a man his age was supposed to want: influence, power, money. At the snap of his fingers, a jet would be ready to fly him anywhere in the world, where he could party the days away in whatever fashion a young man could possibly imagine. And he was never short on company. Whether it was handsome models, beautiful actresses, ingenious scientists, or calculating CEOs, Tony always found someone (or several someones) to entertain him when he had a need for it.
And yes, my jaw is quite strong. Franklin tells me that you could crack rocks on my jawline, which I think is a bit of an exaggeration. You are not actually too far off, but I do like to give you a hard time. More fun that way.
With that done, he read Grant’s letter as a small reward. Reading about the exploits of Mark and Pendragon and their relationship brought a smile to his face. But oh, the blond was out to kill him. He couldn’t stop imagining Grant lounging around with his sketchbook in the garage with his thin legs dangling over the arm of the couch. Worse, imagining him asleep on the couch in a similar fashion to the drawings made the billionaire let out a small groan. Yep, Grant was definitely out to kill him.
“I was trying to get the lay of the land and wound up snooping where I shouldn’t have been,” which was true more or less. But really he had to give NYU this if somebody was working on a space-time travel theory there. They nailed it. And well ending up near a hydra installation was unfortunate, to say the least.
I'm very glad to make you happy there honey. You deserve some sweetness. I was too young to know how much everything cost for my parents, but the highway robbery doesn't surprise me. Everyone deserves a burial fitting their faith. But the church is not my favorite institution for exactly the reason you bring up Grant. Shoving the poor further under the rug.
I feel so called out. How did you know? Because yes, I do dance around the garage. One of the things my mother had insisted on were taking me to dance lessons. And those continued for a good while because Jarvis figured they helped me get excess energy out of my system. Which I guess they did, between that and all the building and tinkering. I would have driven people crazy.
As the lights dimmed, Steve gave a happy wiggle in his seat and nestled down into the cushion. The screen crackled to life as the opening cartoon started - the cheerful background music ringing brightly through the air. Bucky chuckled to himself while Steve laughed with his whole body, tossing his head back so far he nearly slammed it into the back of the seat. But then came the news reel. Images of the battle at Dunkirk flashed across the screen, stark in their violence. All of the laughter was sucked from the room as the realities of war - horrible and unrelenting - flashed before their eyes. And then came the film of Winston Churchill looking every ounce as fierce and stern as ever. Steve sat up straight at the sound of the man’s voice, nasal and slightly slurred:
This time of year… it does something to me. Like the shadows grow inside of me the more the days grow shorter. The light is so hard to find sometimes.
“Either a cute blond artist who breaks his phone so often this is just easier. Or his friend who gets his phone broken by his exes throwing them. They are great guys,” Tony grinned, figuring that would probably happen if Grant or Franklin were to have something like iPhones. “They refuse to let me give them phones. So letters it is.”
Oh, Grant, I could have warned you about that. The higher up some people are the more snake-like they get. I am glad you are safe and the next time you see Lee, kiss her cheek for me please or whatever you feel most comfortable doing.
This was a struggle and thank you for patience and love you so much for joining us this far. The next chapter might be a ways off because our struggle is not over yet. but we're trying. Make you have your tissues. Please send the positive vibes and well wishes our way because we will need them.
Sometimes … meeting famous people is not all it is cracked out to be. Yesterday I was over at February House listening to something Ben was working on. It got raining real bad, and everyone insisted I stay over so I did not catch my death. I have never stayed over before, but it seemed safe enough.
Tony doodled a fast bit of Grant shouting from the rooftops. And included his aircar traffic control designs and the different gauges on the cars and information you’d need to fly safely. He also doodled Grant getting a lift from Tony in a jetpack.
“You really haven’t been, I mean you had some weird shit happen in December that I definitely kicked your ass for. But do your thing I guess?” Maria shrugged.
Serena blinked when a literal goddess turned towards them. And then Tony had the audacity to introduce them to one another. Tightening her grip on the strap of her bag, the art historian did her best to keep the tone of her voice level. “Hi. Hello.” She nodded slightly. “Nice to meet you, Serena.” She winced. “Demi. Nice to meet you, Demi.”
"Appletini, Cosmo, whiskey sour," Tony listed off. This is one of the parts he didn't mind that much about Ty’s group: They didn't overemphasize that he was Tony Stark.  Mind you this wasn’t his scene; this was Ty’s reservation. No one knew he was here.
“We’ll figure that out when we get there. One of his friends already knows something is up, so hopefully, it’ll be okay.” Tony smiled trying not to imagine not being able to reach Steve for far too long. Not during the war. While Steve said he’d be a horrible prison wife, Tony is pretty sure he is not fucking made to be a war bride.
“You could just stay the night, you know,” Peter said. “We do have a guest room tucked away somewhere in this place. And it would be far better than you catching your death in that rain.”
Tony threw in a drawing of a tiger that managed to dig its claws into the ceiling of the enclosure. The tiger looked content chilling upside down. Pat had been sending him lots of tigers and big cat pictures, and it had all been great.
I would love to hear more about your friends and adopted families. And if Rhonda’s cooking is as amazing as you say it is, I would be very impressed. I am convinced, though, that some mothers just have magic in them that makes their cooking better. Whenever I make some of Ma’s recipes they never seem to turn out quite right, no matter how careful I am. Everything Franklin’s ma makes is kosher, them being Jewish; I love them to death, but I sure miss bacon some mornings.
“Some writers and performers. Artists. Fun people.” Arnie smiled. “I think you might even recognize some of them, Buck. Come on, it’ll be fun.”
"You're landing properly at least. :p Also keep in mind she is wicked fast. It'll take time Tones before you land anything properly.." Rhodes sent back "Glad she's a good fit"
Several tense moments passed as George assessed, Steve who stood his ground firmly. Then, slowly, his shoulders sank. “You should’ve mentioned you had a fella. Ain’t right to string someone along.”
“Punk.” Steve only winced a little when Bucky hit him in the shoulder. “I bet you want to see this just’a watch me jump.”
"If you are sure. Just means I am going to be harder on you later, Tony," Maria warned as she sat on a bar stool.
April rain ran thick down the windows one evening as Steve sat listening to Ben play the piano for their little group. Arnie and Buck had been unable to tag along, as both were working late, but Steve had assured them he would be fine. After all, he knew everyone in the house, and the walk was not actually that far. But that had been before the rain started to fall. Frowning, Steve peered through the curtains at the silvered streets. “Looks like it’s coming down cats and dogs,” Lee commented lightly. “Sure you wanna go outside in that, honey?”
Tony made a drawing of the knight with a long flop of hair as he adjusted the jawline to be a bit stronger. Made him eat an apple as he glared off into the distance, some light freckles on his cheeks since he had probably been out in the sun. A smudge of dirt on one cheek. There was something sharp about his expression that suggested Sir Van Gogh was possibly plotting some sort of revenge against….. Maybe Lord Stark. No, his grandpa did exist at that point in time. Lord… Kitt? He figured as he heard one of Eartha Kitt’s songs play over his speakers. Edward Kitt.
Tony was laying in a metal tub of ice in his garage (because the garage had a handy drain on the floor), and his back was screaming at him. Moving was definitely not an option, which meant it was time to test out a bit of code he added to Dum-E in the most recent update. “Alright kiddo, bring the letter my way, please. Because I sure as fuck am not leaving this tub,” Tony asked, watching Dum-E beep and process the command. Tony smiled and then winced as he moved wrong. “Yep, yep, not moving.”
Dangling from a wire rig connected to the ceiling, Tony couldn’t help but muse on the truthfulness of Grant’s words: him and boredom were not a good combination. After all, he had phone upgrades for days prepared on a phone he hadn’t even released yet. He had easier to clean and maintain ammo cartridges nearly ready to fabricate. He had new targeting systems developed. He made better shaped Bluetooth headpieces. Tony might have even built a tower out of screwdrivers. A lack of hangover meant a lack of impaired function.
A bright smile turned her lips. “That is adorable that he would include his friend in the mural. And I am sure you can find out more information about him. Information on Steve Rogers might be classified, but Becca Barnes Proctor will be at the Captain America event in Brooklyn in February. She would probably know who he is.” Serena hesitated. “Actually, you could probably just contact Mrs. Proctor directly for that kind of information. I bet she would talk to you.”
"I don't doubt that.  I just need a bit more time before I want the shit kicked out of me.  Why is she here so early?" Tony asked, throwing a couple slices of bread in the toaster.
Tony felt his heart try to swell in his chest. For all that he joked about Jarvis’s heart because it was so big and he was so good. He was a little worried about his own for a moment. Because there were Jarvis and Ana. Rhodey, Maria, and a cast that Tony knew a strong amount of the people in. “Up in the corner is Steven Grant Rogers trying to steal a man’s pie” Tony explains managing to rein in his voice. Him. It was him. Tony felt his heart try to break out of his ribcage.
Tony beamed and delighted in the shade of red he could see Steve turn in the faint lights around the base. There was seeing the man in black and white photos and full-colour paintings. And then there was seeing him moving and in real life colour that just lent to the charm even more. He was so fucked. “So you were just as handsome then as you are now?” Tony grinned a moment. He couldn’t keep that bit of flirtation back.
I would have way too much fun with a time machine, but I wouldn’t go alone. This is why I would drag you. Just pluck you up from Brooklyn and go roaming. I’d see Franklin and probably find you sooner or later then tell him I was borrowing you for an afternoon. I think Rome in the ’50s would be done with this conflict and make your fingers practically itch with the need to sketch everything.  Or maybe… Greece. I’m not sure exactly where else yet. But Japan would be amazing too not sure what time period would be best though. Even just Brooklyn of the future would be amazing to you. Bet you it’s gonna be the site of so much change Grant. I know it.
The pair blinked at Steve as though they had completely forgotten he was even in the room. Which, he couldn’t blame them for. Their relationship was still so new, and they rarely got the chance to show their feelings for one another. It made sense they would tend to get carried away in places where they felt safe. Steve imagined he would be the same way, if he could.
Steve looked over at him with wide blue eyes. “Um.” His brain seemed to stutter for several moments as the blush deepened even further. “I, uh, you’d have to ask Bucky?” he suggested weakly.
I thought I had your brows, but you’re telling me they are thicker? Do not make me bring out the Groucho Marx brows Grant. I will do it. You can’t stop me. But augh, people can shape them and they can change. You don’t have any neat eyebrow scars or anything…. Know what. Pausing the knight’s adventures. We are going to play with your eyebrows and not your hair this time.
together: “There are no safe paths in this part of the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go.” Something about it reminded him of his boyfriend, of his wild sense of adventure and fun. It was perhaps a too practical gift, but something about it felt right.
You got the murals! I am so damn happy for you. Once this mess blows over I am going to see every single one you do. I cannot wait to see what you’re sharing with the world. Even if it’s just what’s okayed by Public Works. Your art on the side of buildings. And I love that idea so much; you do such great portrait work. Make sure to be careful up there. It’s awful high up.
Though, nothing was stopping him from printing with it. Just more small movements. Tony got pulled from his programming and tinkering by both the familiar clanging and Dum-E going to get the letter. “Yeah, okay now would be good for a break,” he muttered to himself as he looked at the mess of torn paper and nuts and bolts and wiring from messing with the pressure sensors.
Tony watched Maria frown as she came back down into the garage - a bucket of ice in hand. “Alright, this should be enough ice to make this work. What’s Dum-E doing?”
Shivering, he crawled out of bed and stumbled into the kitchen. The letter seemed to stare at him from the tabletop. Turning to the stove, he began to heat up the water and a pan to make breakfast. He slumped over to the table with his plate of eggs and cup of tea. As he ate, he stared at the letter once more. And somehow, entirely against his will, a ghost of a smile touched his lips. Pausing in his eating, he grabbed a piece of paper and began to write, continuing to eat with his off hand.
That made Steve pause. Eddie was a very accomplished lover - he had a playboy reputation to go with it. So maybe he would be able to sort things out between them. But maybe he wouldn’t even want those things with Steve, because maybe he felt like intimacy and sex weren’t connected. Arnie had been like that, before Michael. He had joked that he would have sex with just about anyone willing, but that being vulnerable with someone was a no-go. And yes, Steve found that deeply ironic.
As for your question … I’m probably not reading that properly Grant. It could be my lack of sleep, but I’ve read it three times and it’s still asking what it’s like making love to someone. So I’ll answer it in the contexts I can think of.  If you’re meaning that kind of intimacy where you know, it’s shades being drawn and suggestive looking skis. I’ll write about it. But it varies depending on the person and relationship you want to have with them.
“... You never mentioned a boyfriend before.” There was an almost dangerous undertone to George’s words, prickling at the artist’s spine.
After reading the letter, Tony was finally left with one impression on the letter that he needed to fix right away as he wrote.
What are your resolutions? I’m voting to not die for myself. Trying to keep Obie from being suspicious but keep him away from my stuff has been proving hard so far. Also making sure things keep making money has also been trying.
George took a slow step towards Steve. “How could he leave a pretty thing like you behind? Sure he’s good enough for you, baby?”
“Well since I don’t know what happened to most of my things I’d like to borrow that, or share it in a careful manner.” Tony chuckled a little and relaxed. “How are you doing?”
And I like it more when things are mutual with partnerships, Sunshine. I’m yours too. In whatever shape or time you want that of me. Time is the biggest hurdle. Time and a responsibility I feel to try to bring Obie down. Is it bad I want it to be super publicly since I am that frustrated with him?
“You know,” Serena said slowly, “the guy next to him looks a lot like you. Any relation?” Never mind the fact they both had the same strange facial hair. She shot Demi a befuddled look.
Jarvis was curled up on the couch under his knit blanket when Tony emerged from the garage. Tony glanced to see Friday had paused while Jarvis was partway through an episode of Battlestar Galactica. Tony gently nudged Jarvis with a small smile. “Hey dad, you’re on the couch,” Tony said quietly.
Feeling oddly morose, Steve did not return to the Barneses’ apartment. He finished his tea and blew out his lamp. Then, feet dragging, he crawled into bed and hid under as many blankets as he could. And if his dreams were filled with warm brown eyes and soft laughter, he would never admit it.
“Yeah, yeah. Don’t get too fresh with me,” Bucky griped. “Else I will take that nice loaf of fresh bread and eat it myself.”
“You would not believe it Pepper. But yes. The artist is something else, you know,” Tony murmured with a small smile of his own.
Tony watched Demi light up and pump her fist, then start chuckling. “I’m so glad to hear that. And do it, make the forgery bot you want it to be. Use it to make whoever is causing you trouble to leave. Make him fire himself,” Demi rubbed her hands together before tapping her fingertips in near maniacal glee.
I’m sorry for your neighbor's loss. I’m not sure it’s going to get better for a while. If you or Franklin have family over there and they are saying horrible things are happening... Believe them.
“If you think you saw it, I believe you. Are you looking for something to do right now or do you need to be held longer?” Jarvis asked, keeping his hands gently on Tony’s shoulders.
The Andrew Sisters are a dream if you haven’t seen them. I could sit and listen to a lot of their music. But trying to look at who’s going where is a little hard to keep track of sometimes.
He would have to make it seem casual, nonchalant even. But it was worth an attempt. Setting aside the sketches, he grabbed a fresh sheet and carefully planned his response. And then, fighting to keep his hand from shaking, he began to write a letter that would change things, for better or for worse.
Besides that.  It's been tense. I still feel like Obie isn't as patient as he was. And I think it is safer for Maria to getaway now. There's tension everywhere Grant.
And then he saw something that made him nearly fall off the bench with laughter. A man sitting on the lip of the fountain was completely caught up in pontificating to his companion some nonsense about the economy and the uncouth younger generation. Had he been less caught up in himself, he might have noticed the large, finely feathered raven that had steadily been hopping closer and closer to him. And, while the man was insisting that “the youth of today” did not understand the value of hard work, the raven managed to get its beak around the chain attached to the very fine silver watch slipping out of the man’s pocket. With a few jerks of its head, the raven managed to snap the chain and danced a few steps away with its prize clanking along behind it. The bird was the picture of joy as its sparkling treasure swung down the side of the fountain, and Steve grinned as the raven spread its wings wide as though it was showing off its accomplishment to the world. Something in the impishness and cleverness of the bird reminded the blond of his boyfriend, which gave him a spark of an idea.
I was actually charmed by that little letter of yours, it’s just the fact I even got a letter was a surprise. The box was a gift from a friend who knows my taste. It was my birthday and a private evening compared to the… event my last party was. I thought the first letter was a prank, or a gift from a person dear to me. I am delighted by the sketch you have left for me and I could praise your line work for days.
Bucky ran a hand over his face, sighing a little. “Part of me hopes not,” he admitted. “If we do… a lot of men won’t come home.”
Tony blinked and thought about how he would be coming back alone. "Yeah. I will. You also need to fill me in on more art you did with your magic fingers. Make sure I could help spread your name around.”
Wine and a pile of blankets. You sure do want to spoil me, huh? Not that I would mind. I am bad at taking charity, because of how I was raised, but gifts to show how much you care… I think I can handle that. Especially if it means spending time with you. Nothing means so much to me as getting to just spend time with the people I love. I bet I could just sink into you for hours, barely noticing time slipping away.
The rehearsals and drills with Rhodey were repetitive and awful. But getting to see Rhodey and Maria duke it out was fabulous. Even if the two of them as a hand-to-hand duo fighting against him was awful. It was still a fun night.
Once the pair were gone, Steve crawled back into his shorts and undershirt. He then carefully rolled the four sketches up and slid them into a protective tube Arnie had left with him. After all, it would not do for the sketches to come to harm on their long journey. He then quickly wrote out a short note:
Which is probably why you are also getting some of the sketches I did of Ella. I cannot seem to decide what angle to paint her at for the mural. Like if she should be the center, staring straight out over the bar. Or if she should be off side, singing out towards the corners. What do you think?
“You are completely fine, Tony! I sprung the idea of the exhibit on you literally moments ago.” She turned to stare up at the painting once more, seeing it in a new light. “I think doing a joint exhibit featuring both of them would be amazing. It would be a way of recovering two artists lost to time.” Her lips twitched. “They would make an amazing dissertation subject.”
If I could pick any time and any place to go, there are definitely painters and thinkers I would want to meet, sure. The moon would be fun if we had a way to survive there. I imagine the view is awful pretty from up there. And I would like to meet Oscar Wilde. Just to thank him. For being visible in a way that gives folks like us someone to hold on to. Because I think it is important for heroes of all walks of life to be visible so that other people, ones who are like them, can gain strength from them. And it is easy to feel strong when everyone is like you. But if you are different? Not so much.
Letting out a breath between his teeth, Steve nodded. “Yeah. I think so. He seems like someone I’d get on with. And it wouldn’t hurt to write back? Worst he could do is throw it into the fire and ignore it. Right?”
A particularly vivid blush settled on Steve’s cheeks. “Um. For my date. I can’t seem to find where I’m supposed to meet them, though. The photo booth?”
"You were the handsome fella in the corner," Tony replied remembering how he had thought he'd seen Steve while bombed out of his gourd there. "The one that looked like he was over the moon listening to Ella.”
His jaw clenched. Tony could not afford to think like that. Just because his man had an expiry date, it didn’t mean Tony couldn’t take him from the ship. Maybe he could try to grab Steve from the bridge of the Valkyrie. Rig something to take the ship down and get them out before it crashed. All he had to do was crack the code for time travel sooner rather than later.
I never understood why people think angels have to be all demure and sweet. God always struck me as having a sense of humor. I mean, have you seen a platypus? I do not think someone without a sense of humor would make something like that. You would fit right in with a gaggle of pranksters who do good things. After all, you were the fella that sent me money so I could take my ma flowers after only a few months of knowing me. That was pretty angelic in my mind.
Tony paused as he looked at the letter and considered the unexplainable delivery. He bit his lip and looked over at Rhodey’s gift again. It was impossible, and yet… the sketch he was looking at was a view unlike one he’d seen before. It was old Brooklyn. But done in such care, with every little detail clear from the clothing hanging on lines to the way the buildings seemed to lean into one another. It was a view the guy probably saw a lot. Tony sat the letter on the worktop, letting the smell of the cologne linger. Drumming his fingers on the table, he read it again. “For science,” he mumbled, grabbing a stray notepad and a pen from nearby. The only way to get answers was to conduct an experiment, and so he began to work on the first draft of the letter he just wanted to try sending. He would rewrite it later, using Ana’s beautiful stationery, but in that moment he simply needed to get his thoughts out.
Steve sighed happily. “Yeah she does.” He snagged a relatively clean towel before shuffling into the kitchen. “... Thanks, Buck. For, y’know.”
P.S. A surprise sounds dangerous. But I am excited. We might have to count Pendragon’s sketch of me as your gift, depending on my work schedule. Thank you, though.
Yours. Mine. I want to yell it from the rooftops so all of Brooklyn knows I got a fella all my own. If I could, I would kiss you something fierce right now. It is what my boyfriend deserves. And I would make such love to you. Spend all night whispering in your ear all the sweet names I want to call you and listen to the sound of your heart. Kiss you until all your thoughts were of me and nothing else. Oh honey, just imagine how good it will be when we can finally have that.
I want you to be safe too, you deserve every chance to do well. I think you should get some sun every chance you get. It would be good for you I think.
Later, during the performances, Steve could not help looking around the club. He felt restless, as though he were standing on the edge of the scaffolding on a tall building with his toes hanging off the edge. As he scanned the crowd, his gaze caught on a couple that made his breath catch in his throat. A muscular brunet was seated in a chair, looking for all the world like a king, and in his lap was a smaller blond. The pair looked so comfortable with each other that it made a fierce ache burn in Steve’s chest. He could imagine being like that with Eddie - sharing those little intimacies. Especially as the brunet whispered something to the blond that made him throw his head back in laughter; nearly toppling off the other man’s lap except for the firm grip his partner had on his hips.
Franklin and I have been making good use of the book! When he has a day off or works a short shift, we’ll practice in his room. The other day I managed to throw him over my shoulder. Can you believe that! We really appreciate that you included the stretching exercises, too. I know they have helped make sure we do not get hurt too bad. Of course, Franklin did accidentally give me a black eye the other day… we were going through the motions, just to get the form right, and he swung a bit too fast. I have not stopped ribbing him about it.
Okay, but how is it my fault that the movie made you feel emotions? I just picked it because I will watch Cary Grant in anything. I had no idea it would be about all that. Honestly, though, as soon as it started with Julie saying she was divorcing Roger, I knew it was going to be a ride. And then all the drama around if they would have a baby. And the adoption! Heavens, I wanted to throttle Mrs. Oliver for being so hard on them. But then she got them their beautiful baby girl. My heart absolutely broke, though, when Trina passed away. Poor, sweet girl. No wonder Roger and Julie were on the brink of divorce. I cannot help wondering, though, if adopting another child would have solved all their issues. But, I guess sometimes you just need to tie things up quickly and get the movie over with. I will gladly let you pick the next movie, though. Let us see if you do any better, honey.
And when you send me pictures of Rhodey and Maria, I will have fun drawing them too. Your photos give me exciting new things to paint and sketch. Some of them have even been worked into pieces I am doing for the Public Works of Art Project around New York. One of the advisors says if I continue to do such fine art, I may even get a really big project. Here is hoping!
Carole and I run in similar circles. Private parties all that jazz. I’ve been meaning to meet Cary; just haven’t managed it yet. Do I sense a favourite Grant?
Ducking his head, Steve turned absolutely red. “Uh, you could say that. I was part of an experiment, and it made me… much bigger and much healthier than I was.”
“Hats for him and his friends. To go with the mitts and scarves I got them the last couple of Christmases. I have no idea what I am sending them next year since the thing is a bit small to send a coat through. And socks would be so shitty,” Tony answered as he watched Jarvis stretch out.
I can show you some exploded views I did a while back. They’re in the envelope. So sunshine, I hope this improves your day too.
Are you trying to kill me? Sounds to me like you’re a stunner. It also sounds like you needed that soup and bread. I know these are trying times, but are you getting everything you need? I hate seeing people go without. I am very happy to make you blush and fluster. Secret mission in life accomplished: fluster a little treat of a man. You are so honest it’s refreshing to me.
“Well is there any theory you’re trying to prove or do you just want to learn?” Tony asked, laying at the foot of the bed. He’d glanced to see her reading a book on his aunt and had snapped a pic of her during a pedicure they had done in the room. It was one of the best non-professional shots of her she’d ever seen.
And yes, I was warm enough. Summer in the tenement is always oppressively hot, and it seems like the season is getting started early this year. Honestly, if I am not working, I spend a lot of time lounging around painting in just my shorts and undershirt. Anything else I just sweat through.
Let me see. My hair is sort of a honey blond color, I guess you would say. Warm with some undertones of brown to it in the winter. But when I am feeling well and can go out in the summer, my hair bleaches out into pure sunshine. Rumor has it that it suits me, since I am as pale as anything thanks to my Irish heritage. I also have, according to my ma, eyes the piercing blue of the summer sea; but, I always thought she was exaggerating out of devotion to her child. They are just … blue. My nose is a bit crooked from having been broken. To Franklin’s everlasting frustration, I have a knack for getting into fights with guys twice my size. I hate bullies, and I am not afraid to stand up to them. Unfortunately, they are usually also not afraid to beat me senseless.
“Your email said you were looking for two very specific murals. I was sure to read up on them for you, though admittedly they are not particularly well-documented ones.” Stealing her hand back, she wrapped it around the strap of her bag. “The first one is actually just down the street.” She started down the street at a steady scurry, clearly having adapted to life in New York. “What led to your interest in these particular murals?”
That night, long after their fine meal and Steve’s consumption of far too much liquor, the blond was unable to sleep. Sitting at the kitchen table, he stared down the glass of water on the table; his thoughts a muddled swirl of alcohol and sorrow and self-loathing. And every once in a while, like a flash of lightning through the thunderclouds, thoughts of Edward would pierce the gloom. Which was what probably led to his somewhat unwise decision to snag a piece of paper and light the small lamp on the kitchen table. The page swam across his vision several times as he wrote, causing the letters themselves to be far less precise than they usually would.
I will say, your most recent drawing is the closest you have managed to do of me. Though I usually do not have my hair in quite that much of a mess; Pendragon had insisted I roll around on the sheets. I still am not sure why he wanted me to do that. It made Mark smile, though, so I have the distinct feeling it was probably something that would make me blush if I knew.
Reaching into her bag, she pulled out a packet of tissues and passed them to him. “If you need me to, I can.” Turning, she looked at the mural. “... It’s so sad to see it that way.”
Trying to shake off such morose thoughts, Steve crawled over to his desk and pulled out a sheet of paper. He carefully planned what he wanted to say before starting to write in his small, deliberate handwriting.
went wrong. By the time Steve got home - wet and miserable - he just wanted to curl up into a ball and cry. But, he knew his ma would not be impressed by that choice, if she were still around. So, he carefully changed into fresh, dry clothes and lit one of the burners on his stove to make a cup of tea.
I did not stop shaking for a long time after I got home. Sometimes, it is scary being as small as I am. Louts love to think that they have some right to me, just because I am not as big and muscled as they are. Sometimes I have nightmares about it – what if …
Curling up on his bed, Steve carefully opened the envelope. He peeled the thick paper back to reveal the treasures contained within. And
“I can tell, Stevie. It’s a good thing.” Bucky gave his knee a little squeeze. “Just makes sure he takes good care of you. Alright?”
For his own birthday, however, Tony wasn’t sure what to do still. He couldn’t get away with a low key event like his previous year. So, he paced his lab in thought as he waited for the sealer to dry. Tony walked the length of it and back five times before receiving a text.
What was supposed to be a nice relaxing evening of writing Grant turned into a rabbit hole of learning about the February House. Tony read about the absolutely stunning Gypsy Lee Rose and figured out with Friday where he would know the names. Tony had a moment while reading “Funeral Blues” where he choked back some emotions. He’d heard it before, but it was still a heavy thing. After he gathered himself back up, Tony leaned back against his seat in thought. He would wait. Find out if Grant got the job with
