So Castiel kisses him again, chapped lips on Dean’s as he runs his fingers down his side. He trails his lips down Dean’s jaw, reveling in the scratch of his stubble. Down his neck, across his chest, Castiel makes his way in slow, deliberate kisses down his body. Dean squirms, choked noises spilling in broken clips when he stops over one of his nipples. Castiel swipes his tongue over it again, grinning into Dean’s skin as his back arches up to meet him.
He doesn’t push a finger in until Dean begs again, a whimpering mess just trying to hold on as he works it inside him. Around him, Dean is soft and warm and tight, a better place to worship than he’s ever seen. He adds another digit soon after, fucking into the Righteous Man with hands that were discarded from Heaven.
Castiel took him in, his bare chest against his own was overwhelming. He brought a hand up and ran his fingers over Dean’s nipple, earning a small moan from his perfect lips. He studied his face when he pressed his groin against Dean’s, their erections bumping, causing Dean to roll his hips into Castiel’s with another groan. The friction there was too much and Castiel needed to feel him for real. He trained his eyes on his face as they moved, reveling in the sight of Dean’s freckles up so close. He had always thought Dean was made of stars and an inch away, Castiel was certain of it. Dean’s eyes opened and he caught Castiel staring. The evergreen captivated him just as much in this moment as it had years ago in Hell.
. He finally, mercifully, bottoms out and they both huff out restrained puffs of air. It can’t be seen now that they’re no longer out in the cold, but it was humid enough in the room that if you tried hard enough, you just might have seen it anyway.
Taking the bottling in his hand, he squirts out more, plastering it over his cock. He hadn’t been touched yet, but he didn’t care. Touching Dean was far more pleasurable than touching himself. The bottle was tossed away and Castiel gave himself a few strong pumps before lining himself up. He presses the tip against Dean’s ass and nearly laughs at the way he desperately pushes back on him. Castiel wants to hear him beg.
“Yeah, but,” Dean starts, rubbing at the back of his neck with the hand that had just been twisted in his shirt. Castiel wants his hands on him again; he wants to feel Dean, to touch his skin and press kisses into the stars on Dean’s cheeks. Then, “I did that. If there’s anything- I just want to help. I could clean them up? Is that a thing? Grooming? I could do that.” Dean brings his eyes back to Castiel’s and the last bit of strength he was holding onto crumbles.
“You’re so hot, Cas, fuck. Can I…?”
Castiel does exactly what he’s been longing to for years. He crosses the stained motel carpet in a few quick bounds, wraps his borrowed fingers into the collar of Dean’s jacket and yanks him back to his mouth. He kisses him, needy and fervent and hot, tasting him with every shred of desire he has bottled up in his chest. It’s heady, intoxicating; all too much and nowhere near enough.
Dean does end up ordering what he always does - a bacon cheeseburger and fries - and Castiel does end up ordering the same. Every once and a while it’s nice to eat, enjoyable almost, but he has learned to order what Dean does over the years. He is never able to finish it, but he enjoys being able to give Dean a little extra food later. It’s the smallest gift he can give and it’s one Dean never questions. It’s safe.
“Dean,” he says, “would you care to help?” He’s never seen Dean sit up so fast in his life. Eager fingers fumble over the buttons of his shirt and his mouth hangs open when his hands finally touch his ribs. He runs them over Castiel’s tattoo, lingering over the inked Enochian letters that peppered his flank. He lets Dean continue as he shucks the shirt from his shoulders. Dean looks up at him through his lashes and Castiel tilts his head down to gesture towards his pants. He watches Dean lick his lips as he unhooks the button and slides the zipper down. Slacks are dropped to the floor like everything else and he watches Dean’s wide eyes take in his almost naked form.
“Uh-huh.”
“What do you mean? With us? I mean, if you - if you changed your mind, that’s alright, just-”
“How can I help, Sam?” He asked, deciding to pull out the seat opposite him and sit down. He folded his hands in his lap and waited for Sam to lift his head out of the book.
“Dean - “
“Better?” he asks, attempting not to sound irritated and failing.
“Not entirely. I’d say we could be fairly confident you were right now.” Castiel says, picking up the menu that the waitress left at the table after directing them to their seats.
“Well, I certainly did not mean to.” He confessed, eyes stuck on the curve of Dean’s mouth. He wanted to taste it again. Castiel leaned down again and stole the smile from his lips, pressing fervent kisses onto his lips. They grew heavier, hotter. Dean pressed his tongue into Castiel’s mouth and he was just about gone. Pulling apart so suddenly it left Dean dazed, Castiel tore open the small square containing the condom and rolled it onto his dick. He had quite literally waited an eternity for this moment and he didn’t care to wait a moment longer. He quickly uncapped the lubcricant again and spurted a healthy amount over himself, giving his cock a few strokes before lining up.
“Please, what?” he asks, a sly smile on his lips as he removes his sticky fingers. Dean whines at the loss, already squirming on the bed below him. He doesn’t wait for an answer as he strokes himself a few times, tearing open the condom wrapper with his teeth. It rolls on easy and Dean’s mouth runs dry as Castiel adds more lube over himself.
“I… we don’t have a change of clothes.” Dean states.
“Fuck, Cas…” He says it out loud this time, needy words falling on Castiel’s ears. He wants to give Dean whatever he wants; he would destroy Heaven and Hell just to hear Dean say his name like that over and over again. He grinds down on him and feels Dean buck his hips up to meet his. Just then, Dean’s fingers find their way back into the down at his back and Castiel arches into the touch. A low groan rumbles from his chest and Dean’s eyes flutter shut at the sensation.
“What do you want, Dean?” Castiel asks, placing his hands on either side of Dean’s head. Dean’s eyes are wide, pupils blown. “I’ll give you anything you want.”
“Shut up and hold on.” Castiel directs. He doesn’t need to hear a deathbed confession; he doesn’t need to hear an apology or that he forgives him. What he needs is to get Dean in front of the fireplace again, to get him out of the cold.
Dean just gawks at her. “Then why does everyone still believe there’s something out there?” he asks.
, oh, may I?” Even as he asks, Dean’s soul grabs onto Castiel’s grace in hot desire. His fingers reach up and tangle in forgotten feathers and Castiel can see universes being born under his hands. Dean tugs at the down, pulling and stroking wherever he can reach as he tumbles closer and closer to the edge. He needs to be
“Anytime, dearie. I think you should go wash up. Sam and I can discuss payment.” She said with a grin turned towards Sam. Sam laughed nervously and rubbed at the back of his neck.
Before he has time to move, a woman brandishing a shovel connects it to the back of Dean’s skull and with a sickening
“Oh my God,” the air that comes from Dean’s words probably isn’t warm anymore, but there’s a smile on his freezing lips and the urge to taste that grin overwhelms him. Castiel pushes it down but doesn’t tear his eyes away. “Well, let’s go.” Dean continues, grabbing Castiel’s hand in his and pulling him towards the old wooden door. His heart beats wildly in his chest at the contact and his fingers naturally curl to intertwine with Dean’s. They’re cold and he doubts Dean can even feel how tightly he’s holding on, but there, as they step over the threshold into the old abandoned cabin, Castiel never wants to let go.
Dean must know; he
“So…” Dean says, voice trailing off before reaching his question.
“I saw… There was this- this bright blue light and I could feel it, I- it was warm, but it was freezing. I’m- I’m sorry I’m not really sure.”
Dean eyes him again, the heat of his gaze warming up Castiel’s face from the cold, but he settles back in again and rests his head against the pillow. His mouth hangs open for another moment, a silent hint that he isn’t letting this go just yet, but then he snaps it shut and closes his eyes again.
Dean is looking at him as he flicks his tongue over his cock, but the sight is too much and he tosses his head back into the mattress. “Jesus Christ, Cas, I’m not gonna last if you - ohh…”
“Dean, we’ll figure it out, okay? Wa- Dean! Wait!” Sam tried calling after his brother, but Dean had raced down the stairs the second they entered the bunker. “Dean!” He called again. Grumbling something under his breath, Sam followed down the stairs.
The waitress walks between their tables then and sets down their matching plates in front of them. The woman grabs her things and places some money on the table as she turns to leave. “The world is lucky to have people like you.” she adds softly, “Good luck with your next monster, boys, and enjoy your life together.” She pats Dean’s hand as she walks past them and they watch her go, hearing the chime of the bell above the door ring in the wake of her departure.
He removes the last bit of clothing and reaches into Dean’s bag, brushing his hand through the items until they land on a bottle, cold and heavy, and a small tin square. He doesn’t miss the way Dean smiles, shy as his ears turn pink.
Dean groaned, breathless. “Cum for me, Cas, fuck. Cum
When he’s done, he looks over at Dean; he’s still facing the fire, view turned away from him, and he’s still shivering. From another glance, Castiel can tell his lips are still blue. It’s not enough.
“You just going to stay silent until I fix this?” He asks, leaning back against the doorframe to the kitchen. Dean held his stare and furrowed his brows, opening his mouth slightly before snapping it back shut. Instead of answering him, he took a big swig of the beer in his hands.
“You asked me to fuck you, did you not? Do you still want me to fuck you, Dean?”
“Like how far should we go?” Dean hoped for clarity, leaning back as a blush tinged his cheeks. Beautiful.
After a moment, the bubbling died down and the light splashed on Dean’s features dissipated. He slowly removed his soaked hands from the bowl and Rowena met them with a towel. Dean looked up at her as she wiped away most of the concoction.
“Yes.”
Castiel stands then, pushing himself off of the curb and reaching a hand down in offering to Dean. To his surprise, Dean takes it, pulling himself up from the ground. He looked like he wanted to press him further about it, but he kept his thoughts to himself.
“I love you, too.” Cas says, as if it’s the easiest thing in the world. Dean just smiles, leaning down to catch Cas’s lips with his own.
The turn of the earth is marked by the colours of its seasons - the bright, brisk air in Spring is littered with poignant greens and the soft, decorating hues of flowers beginning to bloom. Summer is even more lively with its chlorophyll rich leaves that hold tightly onto the stiff bark of healthy trees. Fall marks a turn of the tides - things begin to wither, to die, to fall back to the earth that built them up. Bright greens fade to browns and yellows and reds, a natural confetti for the mark of another year passing. But then it grows colder, winds pick up and those fallen leaves decay into the earth; eaten up by the ground beneath the bark. Winter can be bleak; it can be the death of all things before new beginnings arise.
Unfortunately, even hours after Dean had wished him a good night, wished for him to have ‘sweet dreams’, still Castiel lay awake. The night outside the window is dark and fog gathers in the distance, but with one more look over at Dean, at his peaceful sleeping frame where bits of too-warm skin had slipped out from the covers, Castiel knew he had to step outside.
and find their way back to the spot for more. Cas is just pure putty in his hands when his fingers are caught up in his wings. It’s addicting having a piece of Heaven coming undone under his own damned hands. After another minute of extracting those lovely moans out of Cas, he pulls his hand back out of the mess of feathers and brings it down in between them.
Dean full on
“It doesn’t get, I don’t know, repetitive? Boring?” Dean shifts, just slightly, not any further away but not closer either.
“You. Everything, I- I don’t know, Cas,
” Castiel hummed past his teeth into Dean’s skin and felt Dean tighten around him as he spilled all over his stomach and Castiel’s hand. His voice was loud, almost a scream of his name as the orgasm washed over him. Hearing Dean was the last push Castiel needed. He leaned back up and pushed in harder, faster, letting his lips fall open as he approached the edge.
“Dean,” he started, wanting to say it back,
to be enough.
The hand fell from Dean’s lips again and his eyes lit up. When Castiel looked up, Dean was smiling, fingers tapping against the hard wood of the table as if he had to find some outlet for the pulsing energy in his brain. Castiel understood morse code, but after a few seconds of listening to Dean’s taps, he was sure Dean didn’t.
Castiel doesn’t wait a second longer. He slides down the bank towards the water and takes careful steps out onto the ice. It’s broken and unstable and there’s a chance he will fall in too, but he doesn’t care. He steps further out as Dean scrambles to get closer. He kneels on the ice and slides, fingertips outstretched as he gets within reach.
“Last saw him in the kitchen. He’s a little grumpy about all this though, so take it easy on the burning questions, Cas.” Sam smiled at him, a hint of mischief in his tone but hiding it successfully from his eyes.
It wasn’t long before Castiel opened the door to the bunker. Sam had informed him of the situation, or more accurately, what small fraction of the situation he had understood, and had asked him to come soon as he could. Castiel wasn’t sure how he could help in lifting a witch’s curse, but he was always happy to help the Winchesters. So, he had driven back to the bunker as fast as he could to be of assistance.
“Dean.” is all he says, choosing to raise his arm towards that opening. There’s no guarantee that what’s there will be useful, but moving is better than staying still.
“Dean, go!” Cas shouts as his hand pushes him back towards the entrance. Dean stumbles over his own feet in an attempt to regain his balance and within the time it takes to get upright, his eyes have adjusted to the sudden dark and he can see them piling on Cas like rats.
“Really?” Dean asks, voice small as he follows suit and stands from his chair. They’re close, breaths mingling between them. Still, neither closes the gap.
Castiel sits and watches out the windows as Dean sleeps that night, wondering when the snow will stop. He keeps the fire going through the night, but when morning comes and Dean wakes again, the clouds continue to torture them and the banks of snow continue to grow.
, it should hurt, but the pain crosses the border to pleasure simply because Cas is looming over him as if he was about to eat a three course meal.
Castiel didn’t want to be angry, not now, not after today, but it nestled next to the forever feeling in his chest and he couldn’t stop himself.
“Cas, hey,” comes Dean’s voice, only slightly tinny over the line, “you busy?”
In one swift motion, Castiel’s wings materialize, sprouting from his back into this plane of existence and folding out in front of him. As bullets fly, he blankets his wings over Dean. Pain hits him in waves; bullets tearing apart his now visible limbs as feathers fall to the dirt clumped in thick spots of blood. He was being torn apart above Dean, but under the soft canopy of shredding feathers, Dean was safe. Shots ring in that barn for what seemed like eons, but predictably enough, the once full clips soon run out. Castiel glances up, catching sight of his damaged wings, to see the people frantically attempting to flee.
He presses a small amount of grace through his fingers where they rested against Dean’s throat. Dean gasps against him, mouth falling open as shaky breaths tear from his lungs. For the first time in his very long existence, Castiel feels greed. As his grace explores Dean, welcomed and guided to Dean’s soul by it’s desperate cries for him, he leans just a little closer. He feels Dean get a careful grip on his grace and he stutters out a ragged breath, the heat of his mouth close enough to Dean’s that it would only take the slightest movement to connect them. He wants Dean in every way-he has for as long as he can remember- but it’s different now; there’s a heat and a pull, desire built upon years of tension, a decade of longing stares and lingering touches. He
need sleep, especially if they are to set out into the woods tomorrow. Now certainly isn’t the time to worry about the sleep schedule of an angel with a tarnished halo.
Dean is looking at him when he gains the nerve to turn away from the fireplace, green eyes searching Castiel’s the moment they can. There’s a sudden weight in his chest accompanying the tightness that never left him and he does his best not to lean into Dean’s touch. He feels like Salvation; even through layers and melting snow, Dean is the answer to prayers for revelation. Castiel wished for nothing more than to bask in this divinity.
“Nonsense!” Rowena says, “Gotta see the boy before I can get anything done.” She smiles as she approaches and Castiel moves swiftly to get out of her way. Her hands grace over Dean’s flushed cheeks, hover over his heaving chest, poke against his tense forehead. She feels for something in him, and after a moment, finds herself relatively satisfied.
Castiel holds him, kisses him until his Summer green eyes close and his breathing finds a steady rhythm.
“Very much so.” Castiel admitted, placing his hand on the back of his neck and pulling him back into a kiss. He didn’t wait to swipe his tongue along the seam of Dean’s mouth and was pleased when Dean let him in. He explored Dean’s mouth with zeal, loving the way his tongue felt against his own. Dean’s hands were in the waistband of his pants now and that was all the signal Castiel needed. He pushed Dean onto the bed, legs dangling over the edge as he sat. Castiel kneeled in between his legs and reached for the button on Dean’s jeans. He looked up at him through his eyelashes, asking for permission to continue. Still without words, Dean nodded quickly, leaning when he needed to to shrug off the pants. Just left in his briefs, it was still too much. Castiel tucked a finger into the waistband and again silently asked for permission.
When the door closes behind them, they both breathe out in relief. The walls seem sturdier from the inside and they do their best to shelter them from the wind and snow. It’s still cold inside as it’s clear whomever owns the place either no longer cares to keep it running, or no longer can. It doesn’t matter though; there’s a fireplace in the living room and stacks of old wood piled in the corner. There are threadbare blankets on the dusty couch and stiff candles left on shelves that line the walls.
sound that came from uncapping the lid. He leaned back, checking Dean’s eyes for any hint that would say he wanted Castiel to stop.
“Fuck me -
“Yes, Cas, fuck, come on.” He rushed, leaning around to get himself out of his boxers. “You too. Need to see you, Cas, please.” Castiel had never known Dean to beg, but it was just about the hottest thing he’d ever been witness to. With a curt nod, Castiel freed himself from the rest of his clothes and kneeled back down between Dean’s legs. Fully undressed, Dean was breathtaking.
“What did you see?” Castiel asks, hand still firmly pressed into the mark on Dean’s shoulder. Though Dean was safe, he didn’t want to let him go. Dean screws his eyes shut, mind grappling for a way to put it into words.
“Okay,” Dean says after a minute, “You’ve gotta get out of yours too, Cas, you’ll freeze.”
“What about it?”
“Pretty sure.” Dean grumbles, scrubbing hard between his fingers.
Dean stands up next to him and scrambles for his blade. The sleeping figures start to wake and Castiel feels the burning need to get them
Castiel grins and steals one more kiss before returning to his position near Dean’s hips. In one swift motion, he frees Dean from the covers. His previous suspicion is confirmed then. He’s bare, hard and wanting.
“Well, this is a pretty open-and-close case, don’t you think, Cas?” Dean says, already placing the sheets back over the bodies to slide them back into their cubbies.
“They are healing.” he says, omitting his other thoughts. He could feel Dean’s desire to touch them again and the last thing he wanted to do was tuck them away. Every second that passed, the bloodied divots smoothed over just a little more. They are only marginally better than when they left the barn, mending ever so slowly.
. The Angel of Thursday was always a silly title; Castiel was the Angel of Dean Winchester, once a vital instrument of Heaven defiled into the bed of a hunter. It was better to be Cas of Dean than to be Castiel of God; he didn’t need God anyway. Spread beneath him, putty in his palms, Dean was more than divinity; he was pure light.
“Well, we can talk to a few more locals, grab a bite to eat and some stuff for the hike maybe, get some shut eye and head out tomorrow. ‘Sound good?”
Castiel looked down at their feet.
“You sure you just want to barge right in? I can scope it out first, Dean.” Castiel shifts uncomfortably; something feels off. He can’t place it just yet, but there is definitely something not right here.
“Uh, well, I’m not really sure if there’s much we can do until Rowena gets here.” He said with a sigh, glancing down at the ever pinging phone on the table. “She’s trying to text me about it, but she says there’s no way she can be 100% sure what’s been put on him until she sees for herself. Right now she has me reading up on some of the more well known truth serums, but so far nothing has matched up completely.” He glanced up at Castiel with a tired smile.
“That’s great, Dean.”
“No, I’m not busy. What is it?” The cold outside his rolled-down window starts to make his nose ache, so ungloved fingers hold onto the ‘roll up’ button as he answers. If Dean can hear the loud electronic sound of the glass shifting, then he doesn’t comment on it. As usual, there is a reason for the call.
“I don’t think we’re gonna make it back, Cas.” says Dean, eyes closed as he huffs any warm air his lips can muster onto his fingers. Castiel looks around them, desperate for an idea. He knows there’s a small blanket in the pack, but it’s unlikely that it would fit them both. Castiel doesn’t necessarily
There’s more to be said, more that Castiel wants to confess to Dean, but he lets the quiet settle into the room. Again, he wants to tell him how much he means to him; he wants to get closer, to explore what’s burning in his chest. Since touching his soul in Hell, Castiel has been in love, he just didn’t know what to call it until he was human. Humanity didn’t come with a rulebook, but he hadn’t needed a guide to understand the hum in his heart when Dean was near. When his wings were returned to him, the feelings didn’t go back to that dull, misunderstood ache. He knew them far too well by then. He wonders if Dean knows what this feels like, wants to ask if he’s ever felt the same, but if he gets too close and goes too far he could lose him and that’s a far worse fate than bottling up the fireflies in his belly.
“What do you want out of tonight?” Castiel asked before Dean could finish his thought. He wanted to know what was out of bounds beforehand because his capacity for conversation was dwindling by the second as Dean’s hard cock stood too proudly near his lips.
“You know, I don’t think it was a curse.” Dean stated as Castiel continued pressing kisses into his lightly bruised shoulder. There were a few teeth marks there and Castiel pressed his lips gently over them.
“C-Cas,” he starts, shivering as his stiff fingers try in vain to grip onto Castiel’s coat.
and fucking
“I do.”
“Perhaps it was the hand holding.” Castiel smiles, lifting his own burger to his lips. He hadn’t wanted food over their stay in the cabin, but the burger smells good and it tastes even better.
In the blink of an eye, Castiel is next to the man, palm steady against his forehead. He feels his grace extend past his vessel and watches the light bleed through his eyes and out of his mouth. The boy falls to the ground unceremoniously and Castiel turns his attention to the rest of the crowd. He is surprised to see that not a single one of them had actually left the building, each of them now shaking as their eyes refuse to leave him. The man in charge had signed his own death warrant, but Castiel was already sick to his stomach over that kill and the worry for Dean was growing more and more imperative.
Castiel smiles down at him, at the man he pulled from the ashes, the man that taught him to love and placed humanity in his palms, and pushes in. Dean drops his head against the pillow and his mouth falls open, hanging there as if he wants to make sound but can’t. His broken noises held shaking in the back of his throat as Castiel starts to move.
Despite his apprehensions, Castiel walks in step with Dean towards the barn. They step carefully, eyeing the discarded cans and broken bottles that littered the ground. The closer they get to the entrance, the more Castiel can smell the pungent aroma of alcohol with the tangy scent of blood. Bottles towards the slightly open door are newer, left there rather recently in comparison the dented cans by the car. If he was uncertain before that this was the nest, the smell of blood would have confirmed it, but with the brash smell of alcohol present, he wonders if maybe it could be something else.
“No, but we know that whatever’s out there really hasn’t eaten in quite some time. There’s three men and two women missing now. It could possibly be satisfied with that and we’ll find nothing out there.” Castiel decides to eat, but he rests the menu back on the table; he is going to order whatever Dean does anyway.
There’s almost no time between the transfer and the hot pressure at his hole. Cas circles a finger around it, not daring to push yet but even just that is driving Dean mad. His legs are parted, he’s entirely open and waiting and wanting, so why isn’t Cas just
“Dean?” Cas reiterates, raising two fingers as if to heal him. Dean catches his wrist as the streetlamp regains its confidence and returns to life. Beams of light illuminate Cas’s face just right and any hopes of regular breathing flew out the metaphorical window. Cas was just as bloodied up as Dean was sure he himself looked. Red streaks dripped down his nose, from the corner of his eye, from the top of his hairline. There were tears in his clothes as well, crimson pools staining those rips. It
of feathers sounds overhead while Dean’s eyes are screwed shut. They snap open at the familiar sound and suddenly there’s no air in his lungs. Cas is there, entirely there. His wings tower overhead, blocking out the dingy light precariously attached to the ceiling. The room dims because of them. Large feathers coat the wings, black and oil-slicked like he had rolled in a puddle at a gas station. Light refracted off of them in such a way that Dean wasn’t entirely convinced they were real. So, even with Cas’s firm hand wrapped around Dean’s hard cock, pumping him dry and rough, Dean reaches up to touch them.
life here, at least human. The only clue is that fabric, but the longer he looks, the more it seems torn instead of slashed.
He is unconscious, but breathing. His breaths are shallow, desperate pulls of his lungs, and Castiel can almost feel how hard he’s trying to hold on. He falls to his knees, hands seeking him out to comfort him, to heal him. He pulls Dean into his lap and places his fingers tenderly on his forehead. Again he feels his grace flow from his hands, but this time it serves a different purpose. The angelic heat of the Heavenly host turns gentle to cradle the diminishing embers of the Righteous Man.
Dean’s brows furrow together, confused. “Almost?” Castiel notices him shiver, so he decides it is time to head back inside. Maybe someday he will be able to tell Dean that the burning ember colours of Autumn’s falling leaves comes second only to him.
A sudden fury fills his chest.
“You- your- you have
“So are yours.” Castiel grins. He can feel it, his Grace still buzzing within him, nestled safely against Dean’s soul. A hand on his mark, Castiel can see, can
“Do you have…?” Castiel trailed off.
“Yes, Dean?”
“Did you mean it?” Dean’s hands are doing their own ministrations over Castiel’s chest and Castiel places his hand over Dean’s to still the motions. Once he is calm, he moves his hand up to cup Dean’s chin and lifts his eyes to his own.
“I would rather be sure you’re safe.” Castiel admits. He blinks and turns quickly, casting his vision out the window beside him.
Castiel swallows. “I- Dean, I healed you. I’ve done it a hundred times before, I don’t know wha-”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, man. Sure seems like you saved us, to me.”
“Dean, you’ve seen my wings already, I-”
“Dean.” The words should sound guarded, like a warning not to tread too far, but instead they sound restrained and Dean Winchester sure does love a challenge.
Another wave of fury hits him and Castiel stands with poise. He shakes out his wings, trying not to cringe as a few more chunks of bloodied feathers float to the ground. The man who was previously so smug stands stalk still, eyes unmoving from Castiel’s body.
“Yeah, Cas, I do. But, you’re an Angel and you can’t-”
Castiel rakes in a deep breath, feeling the ice around him seep into his lungs. It’s good, grounding. Being so close to Dean again - sometimes it’s too much. Over the years, Castiel has realized what the churning in his stomach means. He knows why his heart beats faster, why he wants to be so close. But that also means he knows why he can’t let himself get closer.
to be. The room was empty, not a single cover disturbed on the long rested bodies inside. Dust slowly settles back onto the floor as Cas steps in, walking past where Dean had stopped in his haste.
~*~*~
Castiel keeps the water bottle filled, stepping outside to pack snow into it at different intervals throughout the day. Dean ends up testing his luck with some of the canned food left behind in the cupboards and is surprised when it doesn’t end up making him sick.
Dean smiles at him again, the warmth of a laugh behind his teeth. The bleeding of light from those lips reminds him of the brighter light of his soul and Castiel can’t help but to smile in return. Dean would always be that bright thing he pieced together a decade ago and Castiel was always in awe when he caught glimpses of that light again.
“What is it? Like what you see?” Dean asked, a heady slur to his words.
“Cas?”
Dean whimpers, nodding and pushing against Castiel’s hips in an attempt to get them closer to the bed. Dean wants it - needs it even - and Castiel lets himself be pushed. Dean’s hands move to take off Castiel’s tan coat, leaving it in a heap on the floor to be quickly followed by his own. Castiel lets him eagerly undress them until they’re both down to their boxers, before turning them at the last second so the back of Dean’s knees are the ones that hit the bed and he lands underneath him.
Castiel works him like that, until he’s begging and whining and crying for more, to
Dean decides it’s time to move, so they move. Castiel watches as Dean struggles to shift the metal door as silently as possible and he quickly slips inside after him. Machetes in hand, they walk towards the sleeping figures.
“Cas,” Dean starts again, his previous attempt at speech drowned out by the roaring of blood in his ears, “why don’t you want to be near me?”
“I see. Do you know where he is? I’d like to go check on him then.” Castiel spoke as he rose from the seat, ready to head off in whatever direction Sam sent him in.
There is no need to communicate out loud now; both of them have long since gotten accustomed to the silent words they were able to exchange in looks. At Dean’s instruction, given to him only by following the movement of his eyes, Castiel comes up to the small opening between the hanging metal door and the chipped wooden frame.
In a minute, they are off, carefully treading the almost-icy road towards a safe place to stow the car. It hadn’t snowed the night before, but it was beginning to look more and more like it was going to fix that today. The sky greyed out above them as they drove out of town, a menacing reminder for them to keep track of the time and themselves once they’re out there.
. The world stops spinning because time doesn’t need to move forward if they’re held here like this. There are hands on his face before Castiel can bring his to brush against Dean’s side. Dean’s mouth is still cold but it gets warmer by the second, plush lips moving against his own to blanket him in warmth. Kissing Dean is like tasting the stars; it’s drinking from the fountain in the Garden when God is no longer watching. Dean’s mouth is a better sanctuary than Heaven has ever been and he will never again seek revelation from above when it tastes so much sweeter on Dean’s lips.
“I love you.” Dean blurts. He wants to take it back; they had just had sex, that was all, maybe Cas didn’t feel the same way. Maybe-
“Of course we’re human, numb-nuts.” spits the man in front of Castiel. He isn’t sure when it got there, but there is a small gun twisted in his fingers.
heard them, had been watching that door for forever until he had noticed the change. He wasn’t insane; they were supposed to be here.
“Yeah, Cas, that was something else.” Dean admits with a short laugh. This time, when the rush of air leaving his lung hurt, there was far less pleasure involved and he grimaces in pain.
This time it was Cas’s hand that shot up over Dean’s mouth. The burning in his chest had sprinted to his fingers, forcing his hand to silence him. He couldn’t do this to him, not now, not like this. The brush of Dean’s lips against his hand though was torture and the heat under his fingertips could be seen on Dean’s cheeks. Dean’s hands came up around Castiel’s wrist and pulled him off, relinquishing their tight hold as soon as his mouth was free. Castiel struggled to swallow, it was all he could do to stay in his body.
“Are you sure? I know that I can’t lie but that doesn’t mean you can’t. Don’t ask me why you would lie, I don’t know, but I know there’s no way you’re telling the truth. There’s no way you-” This time, Castiel cuts him off with his lips instead of his hand. He presses himself against Dean, no longer able to hold himself back. He loves him, is mad with it like Dean said. Feels it with him always, especially now as they stumble back against the wall. Castiel’s hands are everywhere, carding through Dean’s hair, digging into his hips, grazing across his chest. Dean lets out a strangled moan and Castiel almost loses it. He pushes harder, knocking his body up against Dean’s with fervor. The sound bubbles from Dean’s throat again and Castiel is helpless to stop the groan that escapes him.
” He ground out.
The loud bang pulled Castiel from his spiraling and forced his attention back to Dean.
“You’re going to have to be specific, Dean. If you can’t ask for it, you can’t have it.” Dean shudders under the weight of those words as Castiel slots their erections together and grinds down.
They can hear each other, but they don’t make sound, rolling moans directed at each other’s essence as their bodies move together. When they come, that’s together too; white-hot and blinding. He thinks Dean is yelling, but he can’t tell if it’s out loud or in his mind and he doesn’t care.
“Will you stay, Cas? With me? Not just tonight, I mean. I-”
Out in the night, the air is crisp, sharp in the way it pokes Castiel’s features, threatening to turn them red. It’s nice though - the cold. In the distance, there’s a light, high above parked cars to guide newcomers to the lot. There are no newcomers, of course, but the light is there all the same.
“Dean, I am not sure if you heard me back there, but I love you. Leaving the cabin won’t make me stop just as going there didn’t make me start. I mean the case. What now?”
Castiel closes his eyes and attempts to sink into the mattress.
“Dean, I- I don’t know what to do. You’re blue, Dean, what do I do? Will you let me heal you?” he asks.
“I would love it if Cas was here.” Then, the dam broke again. “Every time we come home I hope he’s here waiting for us. I really wish he was here more often and not always off doing his angel crap. He should be home with us.” Dean was blushing now, desperate to shut himself up. He raised his hand to cover his mouth, but instead of force-stopping his brain, his words just came out muffled.
“Cas…” Dean looks up at him, flecks of ice on his eyelashes to match the slightly blue tint to his lips. Those blue lips quiver and it’s all Castiel can do not to press his own to them.
sounds coming from Cas.
, like
be able to feel what Castiel does through this bond because there is only a second, the smallest fraction of time in Castiel’s long life that somehow manages to feel longer than the time he’s spent on Earth, before Dean moves the rest of the way. Dean’s lips are soft, better than the first roses that sprouted in The Garden. Though Castiel has lived eternity in divinity, the warm press of Dean against his mouth is the purest taste of the divine he has ever felt. Dean is more than Heaven; he is rapture and sin, love and lust entwined. Dean moves against his lips with the same greed Castiel feels; his fingers burying deeper into the fragmented feathers and Castiel all but moans into Dean’s mouth.
Castiel tucks one arm under Dean’s shoulder blades and the other under his knees and lifts him up as he hauls himself to his feet. Dean tries to say something else but it gets lost in the chatter of his teeth. Castiel makes it back up the broken ground, Dean in his arms, and walks as quickly as he can back to the cabin. The footsteps are almost covered as snow continues to fall around them, but Castiel knows the way by now.
It takes a few minutes to figure out where the cabin is on the map, but once they mark it, the way back down is easy to find. They navigate more through the breaks in the trees than by any dirt path still covered in snow, but eventually they make it back down. The stark contrast of Baby’s black shine to the blanket of snow on the ground makes it easy to spot and Dean nearly hollers when he spots her.
. He pulled off with a wet
Of course, Dean didn’t understand any of this, there was no way his human mind could process most of what Castiel knows, most of what he really is. That is why, when Dean walks out of their shared motel room to meet him where he sits at the curb, he asks him why he is staring at the trees.
Castiel wants to touch, to taste him all over again in a million different ways, but Dean spreads his legs underneath him and
“Dean.” he says, voice hushed. Dean picks up on the shift between them and easily follows Castiel’s gaze across the dining room.
Then, the flood of ice, of a cool autumn river under soft rays of light. His eyes close to contain it, a feeble attempt to keep it bottled up inside for safe keeping. When it’s over, there’s no more pain, no spots of blood covering either of them as they lay on the untarnished, stark white sheets.
“Go back to sleep, Dean.” Castiel tries, hoping Dean isn’t too far out of sleep yet.
“Cas, please for the love of God, if you don’t fuck me right now, I’m-”
“Cas,
Once inside, they each take a bed. When Castiel has the all-too-familiar urge to ask to share, he quiets down the request in his mind and pulls back the covers on the bed stationed on his side of the room. Like with eating, Castiel doesn’t necessarily need sleep, but much the same, he does enjoy it from time to time if he can manage it. It would certainly be easier if he could sleep; he wouldn’t have to wait through the hours that Dean slept, longing to be closer but feeling the weight of guilt for having such selfish thoughts.
Cas’s brow creases in uncertainty, but he nods in agreement with Dean anyway. They can still see their breath floating away towards the streetlights and the moon as they start taking slow, calculated steps towards the mausoleum. Dead, frosted blades of grass crunch lightly under their boots with each unnerving step. The night is silent around them otherwise; the dead of winter  did nothing to help the usual quiet of the Illinois plains that surrounded the cemetery. Rural Illinois was just creepy to begin with, but there was something different about the nighttimes here. It was like everyone in the small towns that dotted between the bigger cities had a story, something they believed in. Most towns around here had some sort of story to it, a spiritual guardian or some curse or other. One they had passed through earlier even claimed they had a spirit that kept away tornados. Dean had laughed at the waitress in that diner then, but when he looked it up later out of sheer curiosity, there was a lot of evidence to support her claim. But, he wasn’t in the business of getting rid of entities keeping natural disasters at bay, he was in the hunting business.
A smile crept onto Castiel’s lips. “Please, what, Dean?” He pulled almost all the way out then pushed in far with his fingers, hitting the spot with a lovely pressure and reveling in the filthy sounds that flew from Dean’s lips.
“Cas,
But even with the space between them, they talk. Dean asks what Castiel has been up to while he’s away and Castiel offers up what he can. They talk about Dean’s recent cases and about how Sam is doing with Eileen. Dean brings up that Sam has been pushing for a dog and Dean admits that he’s close to agreeing while making Castiel promise not to tell Sam of any such thing. During all of their talks, Castiel keeps himself out of arm’s reach.
“Of course.”
” Dean begged, wiggling his hips with need and letting out a broken whimper as fingers grazed over that spot once more.
“Dean.” Castiel feels ragged; he has thoroughly expanded his grace today, the broken wings at his back proved that, and yet he wanted to give Dean more. Dean’s soul was practically begging to get a hold of him, but knowing Dean wouldn't understand what was happening, Castiel found the strength to pull away.
A sharp breath hisses from the back of his throat and as much as it all hurts, it all just feels so
Dean stops, breathes. There’s far too much between them, both history and space, and Castiel wants to close all those distances to reach Dean.
He wastes no more time on kisses, instead dragging his tongue from that spot to the head of Dean’s cock. He swipes his tongue over the slit and grins at the way Dean’s exhales are littered with whispered curses.
Despite Dean’s protests, Castiel gets up to grab a warm washcloth, favoring clean up the old fashioned way. Cleaned but not yet dressed, Castiel crawls back into the bed beside Dean and pulls the man close. Dean nuzzles into his chest and Castiel can feel the way his heart is still hammering away. While he was up, Castiel had tucked his wings back out of Dean’s view, sighing at the sudden relief of stronger healing. Back in bed, he feels the familiar sensation of them phasing through the mattress, but for once, he doesn’t care.
Sam huffed out a laugh. “Yeah, about that.” Castiel squinted, his head involuntarily tilting in confusion once again. “I was just kind of hoping you could keep Dean occupied, you know? He won’t talk to me anymore, but I’m worried he could worsen this somehow if he tries to keep it all in. Was hoping he’d talk more to you.”
“I love you too.”
uncomfortable than the itch of them sliding through the seats.
Sam laughs when he tells him that the people were fine, meaning them getting stuck in the woods for a few days is extra hilarious. He doesn’t know that the cabin gave him everything, gave him more than he could have hoped for, so he lets his brother laugh as he holds Castiel’s hand in the front seat.
At that, Dean opened his mouth again. He held the angry look on his face still, but the words that came from him didn’t match up with his appearance.
They eat until Dean’s plate is empty and half of Castiel’s burger and fries are put away in a to-go box for later. Dean calls Sam from in the impala when they get back to the motel and gives him a run down of the case, excluding, of course, what happened between them. He says he wants to tell his brother in person when they get back to the bunker and Castiel can’t blame him for that.
“You gonna try to get any sleep?” Dean asks, pulling the covers over his frame. Castiel can see him shiver underneath it.
“What?”
“It’s not that.”
to say it back, but it got caught in his throat. He knew he loved him, had known for a very long time, but he always knew that there was no way it was requited.
When he opens his eyes, he sees Dean exactly where he was before, except now he’s only covered by the small blanket that they brought with them. It’s tucked under him, wrapped around his middle and just long enough to reach over his shoulders. It doesn’t cover his chest and most of his legs are out, but they’re facing towards the fire.
Dean was watching him with hooded eyes and parted lips, breaths coming from his mouth in short pants. Dean raised his hand, palm open, inviting Castiel to hold it. He looked at it for a moment before taking Dean’s hand in his, intertwining their fingers, grounding Dean. Then, Castiel pushed in, seeing Dean’s eyes screw shut as he slowly got further and further inside. When he bottomed out, Dean released the breath he was holding tight in his chest and let his eyes open up to watch Castiel. Castiel lost any sense of composure he had left. Dean felt so tight and just
and swirled his tongue over the head, lapping up Dean’s precum as if it was a limited resource. Dean moaned at that, tangling his fingers into Castiel’s ever messy hair. Dean’s head dropped back as he pushed Castiel’s head down, forcing his lips over his dick. Castiel took him in fully, the head of his dick hitting the back of his throat. Dean groaned again.
Castiel pulls himself off of Dean, off of the bed, and walks to the bag left discarded on the floor. Dean groans at his departure, but after he grabs a cloth and wets it in the bathroom sink, Dean’s noises turn grateful. He cleans them up, clearing the bed of everything but the covers and crawls back in next to him.
“Yes.” he says to Dean’s soul, and Dean gives him a lopsided smile as he hears him in his head. It’s closer than Castiel could have ever imagined they could get and both him and Dean land on the next thought at the same time.
Busy is subjective. In his car, parked on the side of the road somewhere in Montana, theoretically, Castiel is busy. The seasons don’t observe themselves. He makes notes on the changes from previous years; marks somewhere in his memory how each one is different from the last to differentiate between all the Winters he has seen. And yet, no matter where he is parked and no matter the season he sees in the trees, when Dean asks, the answer will always be -
. He shakes himself off and pushes himself to his feet immediately, stepping outside and shutting the door behind him. There was no time to put out the fire and if the whole thing burns down while he’s gone searching for Dean then he’d taken too long and there’d be no reason to return anyway. He’s not going to let that happen.
Dean writhes beneath him, curses flying from his lips at almost every thrust. Castiel had imagined this, had pictured what it could be like to be with Dean this way, but nothing could ever compare to this. Dean was as bright as he was when Castiel found him in Hell. He was shivering and begging and crying for more; pleading in silent prayers for
Castiel understands; he feels it growing in his own gut as well and he needs it, needs to feel his soul in his hands when he comes. One hand comes up to wrap around Dean’s length, eliciting a lewd moan and another round of begging, and the other comes up to rest against the brand on Dean’s shoulder.
An idea pops in Dean’s head and he sends it to Cas without parting his lips. They both grin eagerly and at this point, Dean feels like nothing will get better than this. This soul-deep, inhuman connection they have runs through them like the flowing of a river carved out in the land. Its current is strong and unending, no true starting point or end to it. He could feel Cas in his mind as clearly as he could feel him in his hands, his essence was already a part of him, why not go all in?
Cas lets out this
“Do you?”
you are; and I assure you, God will not be as forgiving as me.” Castiel speaks the threat in a low grumble, pushing the words past his lips, seething. It hadn’t been exactly true; God couldn’t care less about the lives of these delinquents, but they couldn’t know that, and the threat landed heavily on their shoulders. The very moment he is finished, every one of them flees. As soon as they are out, Castiel lets his wings slump down, pain permeating through them, and he moves to Dean’s side.
An older woman seated at the table beside them laughs. “Oh, it’s not still out there, honey. Few of us took care of that beast right after it took some of our folks.”
The next day fairs better, the snow softening beneath their boots as they walk, but it could still be a dangerous trip. The sun holds out, promising warmth to help melt the snow, so they agree to let it and settle in for one more day.
Dean’s other hand pulled at the one covering his mouth and slammed it down onto the table with a hard
The next day is awkward and frustrating. Dean is bored and tired of feeling cooped up even after one night. He eats through the snacks he had and nearly empties the water bottle which Castiel later fills with snow and brings inside to let it melt. He grumbles and groans and Castiel sticks with his mission to not get too close. He gives Dean his space and doesn’t linger too long when they’re in each other’s vicinity and he keeps his hands to himself despite that always-there magnetic kind of pull to touch him.
He can’t look at Castiel; his head turns towards the window as he tries to hide the furious blush on his cheeks. “Are you really gonna make me say-”
He moves with the seasons now, watching the leaves, much as he always has, yet with a new appreciation for the feel of the air around him. Nothing feels better than beginning to feel. It’s when he’s lost in thought, eyes trained on the bare branches that remind him of what’s missing in himself, that his phone rings.
His fingers come out of his mouth with a lewd
“Thank you.” He responded. Before Sam decided to impart any more words of wisdom on him, Castiel fled the library and walked towards the kitchen. Just outside, he heard Dean grumbling to himself. It took a lot of restraint to refrain from eavesdropping and instead walk through the threshold.
“Okay…” he trails off like there’s more he wants to say, but he settles back under his covers, blankets hiding his chest from Castiel’s view again. Castiel breathes a sigh of relief. “Why were you outside?”
“No, Cas, this isn’t on you. I knew the second you walked in there that I wasn’t going to be able to keep that in.”
The cabin shakes - or, it seems to shake - in the wake of Dean’s departure. It’s like it knows, like the wooden beams that line the place are merely there to hold memories and judgements instead of the roof. It’s cold and one look out the window confirms that the snow hadn’t stopped in the last five minutes that it took Dean to storm outside. The sun is gone now too and there are no lights at the cabin to guide Dean back to him.
Sparing a quick glance at each other, they each raise their fists, blades aimed directly over the vampires’ necks. Practically in unison, they swing the blades down hard. Movement catches their eyes before blades connect to flesh and Castiel is knocked to the ground. When he hits, the machete falls from his grasp and he sees with abject horror that the same fate befalls Dean.
Castiel shakes his head, huffing out a small laugh as he lifts his gaze towards Dean. “I have seen every one. From the beginning of it all, Dean. It is never any less beautiful than the first.” He is unsure why, but a soft pink hue dusts over Dean’s cheeks at that.
“I’m sorry.” Dean stated. Castiel blinked in shock.
“Is there anything I can do to help?” Castiel felt repetitive, always asking instead of just finding something to do.
And that’s okay. Castiel is capable of loving and not being loved in return. It hurts and it aches and it makes his body itch to move closer, but he will bear the pain to bask in Dean’s light for as long as he’s able. Dean will never be his in the way he wants, but Dean is still his friend and Castiel will be here in whatever way he’ll have him. An angel off the line with a brand new salvation.
After a while, Dean pulls some food and the bottle of water from the pack and eats. Castiel declines the offer for food, and they talk until the fire begins to dwindle. They explore the rest of the cabin, finding that the other two rooms are a bedroom and bathroom. The plumbing obviously doesn’t work, so the bathroom is fairly useless, but the bedroom has a mattress that seems to be relatively intact with covers that house no bugs, upon inspection. The downside to the bedroom is the lack of a fireplace, so after little deliberation, they drag the bed into the living room and let it rest near the fire.
He doesn’t say anything else until the morning and Castiel never falls asleep.
Dean touches him again that night as the snow begins to melt around the windowsills. Castiel touches him too, soft hands no longer freezing as they trail over heated skin. They find each other in that cabin, their love laid out by the fireplace, and hold each other there. They sleep tangled up and when they wake, the sun streaming through the window, Castiel loses any doubts that this will change. Dean loves him; he tells him through touches, through prayers, and Castiel believes him.
Castiel softened his gaze and sat down across from Dean like he did moments ago with Sam. Sam, who had been right about Castiel having some burning questions. He felt his own face heat up, but tried to stay focused.
It hit him harder than he ever thought it could. The impact of those words landing harder than his fall years ago. Castiel had never thought anything could compare to that, but this was as close as you could get. His head felt like it was spinning, the hot fluttering in his chest was hotter, threatening to strangle him.
“You sure you want this?” Castiel asked, pouring the lubricant into his palm.
They lay there together, spent and warm and alive, until the sun comes up and the snow stops falling.
“Cas?” Dean’s voice is rough, bogged down by sleep.
He drags his lips down Dean’s stomach, pressing firmly just above his hip where the blanket is still draped. He grabs it, the fabric soft in his fingers, and looks up. Dean knows what he’s asking; nodding, he pulls his bottom lip between his teeth. Castiel wants to feel that too, so he leans back up and catches Dean’s mouth in his own, softly grazing his teeth over Dean’s bottom lip and pulling a moan from his throat. He could drown in that sound, if the universe allowed it.
“Now what?” Castiel asks, looking out the window as Dean starts the car. Hot air blasts through the vents when she rolls over and he closes his eyes to bask in it.
“No.” Castiel cut off his rambling again. “No, I do have to say it, Dean.” He paused again and rised to his feet. He didn’t want to be so far away when he said it, didn’t want Dean to have to guess if he meant it.
Castiel never thought he would get to see Dean this way. He had proved time and time again that he was something out of the reach of even Heaven’s most holy. But here he was, naked and wanting, silent pleas coming from the look in his eyes. He was beautiful. Dean Winchester was holy in ways God couldn’t compare. He was filthy and raw and battered, but he was stunning; freckled, sun-kissed skin that begged to be ravished.
Dean swallows. “Can we, uh, do this in the room?” Dean laughs then, weak and quiet, eyes dropping from Castiel’s as fingers depart from feathers. Castiel misses that touch instantly and as much as he wants to fly them back to the room that second, his wings were destroyed. Dean feels his concerns without them being voiced and he is the first to gain the strength to stand. Once on his feet, he offers his hand down to him, shy smile and all. A fluttering feeling enters Castiel’s chest again and he feels like he’s going to burst. He retracts any lingering grace as he pulls himself up by Dean’s hand and he tries not to note the flash of disappointment that crosses Dean’s features.
“I- fuck, I want you to fuck me.
“Look who’s here!” Sam bellows with a grin that falls from his face the second he’s done talking. Realization dawns on him and he fumbles to put a hand on a very curious Rowena’s shoulder, desperate to pull her away. “Ah, maybe we should go look at the books one more time; maybe we missed something.” He chuckles, flitting his eyes between the two of them.
If he hadn’t had Dean’s entire cock in his mouth, Castiel would have grinned at the sweet submissive way Dean asked, no, begged for Castiel to let him cum. As if Castiel told him no, he would force himself to stop it in time. Castiel had no intentions of robbing him though, so he hummed a soft ‘yes’ around Dean’s cock.
The seasons are not Dean. Dean is love; he’s beauty and hope and perseverance. He’s a sanctuary on his own, a church in which he worships and prays for the salvation that he delivers with his lips. Castiel is a fallen angel with newfound divinity and he will never return to Heaven when Heaven is in his arms.
“Oh, fuck, Cas,” Dean tightened his grip in Castiel’s hair and fucked into his mouth with shaky thrusts. “Cas!” He groaned deep in his throat and Castiel felt the hot spurts jolt down his throat. It was warm and he sounded so lovely as he swallowed him down so completely.
After coming to no real conclusion on the matter and the sun setting another time, Dean takes to the bed again as Castiel stokes the fire. The snow is somehow still coming down and Castiel is unsure if it will manage to end overnight. Once the fire is going again, strong and steady, Castiel returns to his perch by the glass.
Castiel doesn’t know exactly what he’s wanting to do, but he wants whatever it is. Dean takes him in his hand then, pumping his length in soft strokes. After a moment, he spits into his hand and starts again, The wet grip nearly has Castiel there right away, and after Dean begs to see it, asks again and again for him to give it to him, Castiel tips over that same cliff. He paints Dean’s chest in warm stripes, unable to stop the grin on his lips from forming as he watches Dean swipe a finger through the mess and bring it to his tongue.
This made Dean laugh. It wasn’t a cheerful laugh, not the lovely cadence of breaths he had grown so attached to hearing over the years. This laugh was irate, chock-full of flames and irritation, licked in fervent heat. It almost made Castiel jump.
Then, Cas is on him again, hands pressing harshly over fresh wounds and older bruises. Cas’s lips catch his again in a brazen kiss, fervent and needy in between sharp bites. It was Heaven and Hell, agony and rapture all in one. Castiel was divinity bottled, stardust and reverence beneath the taught lines of coarse skin. Dean’s brain stutters from the thrill and he nearly jumps out of his skin when he feels Cas’s rough fingers wrap around his cock.
“Did it work?” He asked, braving conversation only towards the safe routes.
“Fuck, Cas, I’m close, I-”
They stay like that, silent and panting, spent and totally fucked, for a minute before Cas pulls out and cleans him up. Dean doesn’t protest because he is entirely convinced that if he tried to speak, nothing would come out. When he’s done, Cas lays beside him on the bed and wraps his arms over Dean’s heaving chest.
“Oh… I should have tried harder to stop you. It was selfish of me to let you keep going.”
He wants - so much, he wants - to hold him, to take those darkened fingers into his own and bring him peace, safety. He wants to feel Dean come back to him in his hands, to wrap him up in his arms and be the fire that saves him. Instead of stepping closer, he walks towards the logs in the corner, ignoring the tight feeling in his chest. He carries them over into the empty fireplace and stacks them until there’s enough to get a decent fire going. There are dried out leaves near the logs so he tosses those in there too. Then, he takes the matches from the backpack and lights one up, watching as the flame spreads from the small chip of wood in his fingers to the brush and logs he’s gathered. It’s good, warm, and it’s better for Dean than his own hands would be.
“Fuck, you’ve been such a good boy, Dean. Come for me. Come for me, Dean.”
Castiel doesn’t respond, just moves himself into the open space behind him. The mattress creaks under his weight as he tries not to press up against him. If there was space, if they weren’t quite touching, he could stand it.
Castiel waits.
“I’m fine, Dean.” He isn't, really, but what else can he say?
Dean gasps, eyes flying wide. There’s a faint glow to them and Castiel’s jaw drops.
“Like this,” Dean says, out loud this time, a blinding smile so bright it matches the glow of their eyes, “fuck me like this.”
Briskly, he marched from the quiet kitchen into the bustling library. They were all moving about, gathering ingredients from drawers and shelves around the room and setting them beside the bowl Rowena had placed in the center of the table. It seemed they were finishing up that task when Castiel walked in, and Dean was the only one who didn’t turn towards him as he came near.
“Fuck, Cas, you’re so hot. Fuck it, all of it, everything, give me everything, Cas.”
“Then why have you been staying as far away as you can get? Even now, you don’t want to touch me.” There’s still hurt in his eyes; Castiel can’t stand it.
“Can I heal you now?” Cas’s hands are pressing lightly on his chest, waiting for permission to let his grace course through Dean’s veins.
“Dean Winchester, I learned to love
, he needs every inch of Dean, and when grace cinches down around wisps of golden light, Castiel is unmade.
“Dean, you’re -”
“It was you. Cas, I- Cas?” Dean’s voice shifts from awe to terror in a second and Castiel isn’t sure when he closed his own eyes, but suddenly they were springing open, frantically searching Dean’s face. That’s when he saw the quick way Dean’s eyes were bolting back and forth, flicking over and over from one shoulder to the other.
They discuss the case, both coming to an agreement that something is fishy about the campsite. If there had been a monster, there’d have been blood, right? If they had been taken, kicking and screaming, there would be a trail to follow. Hell, with all their wandering yesterday, they might have even come across a cave capable of being a hideout, but no such sanctuary had revealed itself to them. The tent was torn, but not shredded in the way that claws tear fabric and there were no other provisions left behind. They both doubt that a Wendigo would have made sure the campers had their backpacks first, so it leaves a big question mark on their clue cards.
“Oil. Wing oil. I-” Cas huffs, “My wings produce it to maintain themselves.”
It takes them close to two full hours to reach the campsites marked on Dean’s map. There are shreds of nylon and polyester dotting the ground but no telltale red flecks to follow further into the woods. Scratches mark the trees nearby, but again, there’s no blood decorating the scenery. Even the scraps of tent fabric on the ground seem out of place, off-putting.
The whole world falls away.
Dean swallows. He searches Castiel’s eyes until his gaze falls to his lips. “I want you to fuck me.” He finally manages, face redder than before. Castiel is about to agree when he continues, “Unfortunately, I didn’t exactly think to bring lube and condoms on a quick trip to check out a crime scene. There’s some in my bag back at the motel though.” He laughs, the corner of his mouth upturned in a smile.
“My chain? Dean, I do not have a chain of any sort and-”
“Would you come here?” Dean asks, finally. He shifts on the bed, closer to the fire and creating an open space behind him. Castiel can see that he’s still shivering, but at least the colour is starting to return to his lips. “I just… If you don’t want to be near me, that’s okay, but -”
“I - ahh, I - my bag.” he stutters out, hoping, praying that’s enough.
He brings Dean near the fireplace and sets him down on the floor. It’s better to soak the floorboards than the bed, so for now, this will have to do.
didn’t need to know about, he clued in.
them, to feel the feathers in his fingers. “For real this time, Cas. Show me.”
Cas is a little more careful removing Dean’s pants and boxers and then he’s there, naked and bleeding out on a rented bed underneath the steady and hungry gaze of the almighty divine. The wound on the back of his thigh wasn’t stopping up yet and it only took a few seconds before there was a growing pool of it underneath him. As he lays in his own blood, eyes trained on the disrobing seraph kneeling on the dirty motel bed, Dean sends a silent prayer to his angel.
“Because if I touch you, I’m afraid I won’t want to stop. I’m afraid of what will happen if I touch you and you ask me to go. You- Dean, you have no idea how intoxicating you are. Being close to you is like being next to the sun. You are the most amazing man that I have ever met and I-”
at that and something stirs low in Castiel’s gut.
“Cas!” Came Sam’s voice, turning his attention away from the kitchen and towards the library. When he walked up the short steps, he found Sam huddled over a few books, his phone beside it overflowing with text messages. He tilted his head in confusion.
Taking his threats into account, the leaves stay quiet under their boots and they make it around to the other side of the barn. There is another door, metal instead of wood this time, hanging precariously from the beams. It doesn’t look like it fits there; it’s wrong and off-putting, resembling the feel in the atmosphere around them. Castiel takes in a quiet but unneeded breath.
“Dean.” he says low, quietly as he can manage. Dean turns his head towards him inquisitively. He was probably trying to split his attention between Castiel and the barn entrance, so Castiel starts quickly.
Castiel can practically feel Dean’s soul buzzing through his skin, the bright heat of it seeping through his pores to land on his tongue. He tastes of peaches and honey and burns smooth like old whiskey. It’s overwhelming and nowhere near enough.
“Gorgeous.” He muttered, eyes roaming over everything kept hidden under layers of fabric every day. Dean blushed, his dick twitching in front of Castiel’s far too close face.
Normally, when a hunt goes sideways, it’s a physical problem: a broken limb, deep wounds, concussions. This time, it was a curse. A small one; no big deal, surely. Unfortunately, they didn’t have a way of finding out who placed it let alone make them lift it. Fortunately, the curse wasn’t a painful one from what he could tell, but it was pissing Dean off so much he was now at the point where he just refused to speak. Dean was doing pretty well at controlling his mouth by this point, but that was the extent of it. The whole ride home, which was an excruciating 8 hour drive, Dean had spoken every single thought that entered his mind. It was like a dam had broken in there, forcing him to spill truths from every corner of his brain. If he was being honest, it took Sam a few confessions to notice anything was up, but when Dean just didn’t stop, telling him about things he
“Looks like we got ya delivery today, Benz.” The first man speaks. The crowd steps back, not a single face without a smile. Castiel licks his lips in anticipation as he watches the man that fetched the vampire remove the ropes around his wrists.
“As you wish.” Castiel concedes with a grin, before pulling his fingers out for good and wiping them on a rag that had accompanied the other items in the bedside drawer.
Castiel kisses his neck again just to feel him move against him. Dean moves his hips up to buck into Castiel’s, letting loose another shameful groan at the contact.
want to give them a reason to go out there and find trouble again?” Dean doesn’t answer. “It’s safer this way.” She nods into her coffee.
“Yeah. Thanks, Cas.”
“Well, you could at least sit down. You’re making me nervous just standing over there.” Dean grumbles, turning over to face away from him. Something tugs at Castiel’s heart and he gives in with a sigh, crossing the room to plant himself on the old couch, Dean near his feet.
Just then, as if the bastard heard him-he probably did-Cas slides a single finger past his rim. A shaky gasp gets torn from his lungs and the pull of such a breath sends an agonizing wave of pain from his ribs. He cries out, the wail turning from torment to elation. What sweet agony to be torn to shreds under the healing hands of Heaven.
“Need you, Cas.”
“What do you want, Dean?” It comes out low and demanding. He wants to give Dean everything.
Castiel blinks, stunned. Dean shifts up, deciding that the covers feel more like a trap than a comfort. Castiel stares at him as he stands up from the bed.
Dean nods, unable to form words as he scrambles his way to one of the mattresses. As soon as his ass is on the bed, Castiel takes a single, deliberate step forward. Dean watches him closely, green eyes blown with interest. Castiel undoes his tie, a slow process he takes his time on. Dean is practically squirming on the bed; Castiel smirks, a single brow raised.
“Would you like to do the honours?” Dean says cheekily, a flush in his voice. Cas is finally able to regain his composure- and control- over the situation with Dean’s hands no longer running through roughed up wings. He removes his hand from Dean’s cock, much to Dean’s dismay, and instead swipes all the oil off of his fingers.
~*~*~
“Dean,” Cas says lowly, a whisper, “are you sure you don’t want to wait for Sam?”
There it is. Castiel pushes into him, slowly sliding in until he bottoms out. Dean is a mess beneath him. His voice broke off, shattered gasps wracking through his system as he grasps at the sheets. Castiel waits for only a moment, right until he thinks Dean is about to start begging again, and then he moves. He pounds into him, desperate and starving for it.
When the door closes behind them, the soft
Castiel pulls back and blinks. “What do you mean? The people? I had to kill one, but the rest I believe I scared straight and-”
“No.” Dean interjects, cutting Cas off from his obvious train of thought. He didn’t want to see them like they were in the barn, large shadows cast against the wall. He wanted to
the ice.
“Cas?” Dean starts again, voice slightly muffled, “Cas, what was that?”
“Thank you.” Castiel says under his breath. The cabin can’t reply, of course, and Dean gives him a strange look as they step off into the snow.
He can vaguely hear the shuffle of the other demons when he remembers the way they had been piled on Cas.
The drive is longer than Castiel remembers it to be, but maybe that was because of his current predicament. By the time they roll up to the mostly deserted parking lot, night has fallen and the concrete is lit only by the meager light of old streetlights, burned away from white light to orange. Castiel is thankful for the cover of darkness as they leave the vehicle and slip back into their shared room. Dean switches on the light as he walks in and Castiel closes the door firmly behind them. It latches with a quiet
“I love you.” Loving him is easy; falling is always easier than flying. But Dean catches him in a kiss, the smile still tight on his lips and Castiel feels like he’s soaring. “I love you.” He says again, breathless. “I love you.”
Eyes shining, they’re together. Dean burns bright against him, his honey whiskey soul pressing in close to Castiel’s Grace. It’s fire and ice, Summer and Winter; it’s Heaven dismantled to it’s finest pieces as they move together beyond their vision.
“What took you so long?” Dean asks, shifting back into the room to let Castiel follow in behind him. He takes a seat at the small worn table by the window, scattered papers decorating the wood.
“I can’t regret this because I can’t lie, Cas! It’s the truth and I can’t lie to myself any more than I can lie to you. So boo-fucking-hoo, this is how I’m doing this whether we like it or not.” Dean’s intensity could be felt in the air, a static charge hovering between them on the brink of starting a fire. The more he spoke, the more Castiel could feel that the anger was more than that; it was frustration. He was frustrated, whether with himself or Castiel he couldn’t be sure, but it wasn’t the white hot anger he thought it was.
Dean grunts, struggling to tilt his head to look at Cas. At his angel. His own little slice of the divine.
“You’re right; this does appear to be the work of vampires.” At his admission, Dean smiles.
“Your hands, darling.” She spoke to Dean, hands outstretched to him. He glanced over at Sam before offering them up to her. She took them in her own and brought them over to the bowl, once again chanting the odd sounding words to the now bubbling mixture. Without hesitation, she thrust Dean’s hands down into the bowl. A loud sizzling sound followed, accompanied by popping and snapping noises. It originated from the bowl, the thick substance spurting up over Dean’s palms, coating them in the syrupy liquid. It looked molten, the sounds indicating it was burning him. Castiel surged forwards, prepared to rip him from the mixture and heal him swiftly. Rowena held up her hand in front of him, telling him silently to simply wait a moment. And so he did. Dean wasn’t yelping; he wasn’t making any noise for that matter. When Castiel turned to try to see his face, it was softly illuminated by an un-seeable glow emanating from the bowl. He had a soft smile playing on his lips and any qualms Castiel had were squashed. He took a step back.
“The falling of the leaves. I prefer not to miss it.” He could feel the warmth that radiated from Dean, as it usually did. Without even having to look over, he knew there was a smile resting on Dean’s lips.
” Dean pants, sweat beading on his brow as his hands twitch above his stomach in a desperate attempt not to touch himself.
“Cas.” Dean says back, a smirk playing at his bright red lips. Something flares up in Cas’s eyes, likely understanding, possibly, hopefully, the same lust Dean was feeling. Cas could always read him like a book, so he didn’t even have to ask for it before he blinked and they found themselves back in the musty old motel room.
“I was in Montana. Unfortunately, there was an accident on the highway and I had to take a bit of a detour to get here. Apologies if I’ve made you wait.” Castiel replies, taking a seat opposite to Dean.
sense of the word, and as Castiel opens his mouth to reply, the waitress returns, saving him from possible embarrassment. If Dean doesn’t tip her well, Castiel is going to leave extra cash on the table when they leave.
“Cas…”
Dean just laughs and shuffles through the printed sheets. “Nah, man, it’s fine, I was just yanking your chain.” He seems to be searching for something in particular in the pile, but Castiel got stuck on his words.
It takes Castiel just over his predetermined 24 hours to reach the motel Dean has since said he would be staying in. Pulling up to the back of the lot, Castiel spots the sleek black impala stationed near a room and he parks his own car beside it. By the time Castiel reaches the door, Dean is pulling it open, a wide grin on his face.
“Good boy. Good boy, Dean. Come for me.” Words command the orgasm from his body and he shouts into the hot air of the room as he covers himself in his own mess. The sight of him must have done something for Cas because before Dean can even get close to coming down, he feels himself being filled up in the most
me?” The laugh was hearty and it made Castiel blush. Not long ago he wouldn’t have understood the reference, but with all his implanted knowledge, he placed the quote right away and couldn’t stop himself from laughing along with him.
“Yes.” responds Castiel, sliding into the front seat of the impala just as Dean finishes up the bag to join him. There is no need to take both cars and Castiel is more than happy to sit in  the passenger seat for a change.
That’s what led them here, now standing just beyond the threshold of the mausoleum, limbs almost stiff in the brisk air. There was shuffling to be heard from within, the occasional shift of feet on concrete. Dean turns to Cas, catching those deep blue eyes with his own to try to convey his thoughts without breathing a word. He was never quite sure how they did that, but it had never failed them. Cas seems to understand now as well and Dean takes a deep breath before shoving the hard slab of stone further into the room.
“Cas!” Dean breathes, reverent, pushing Castiel’s name from his lips in the same way he prays. It makes Castiel shutter.
me, I, uh, ‘ve gotta feel you.” Each word was strained, but Castiel obeyed.
“I don’t understand.” Castiel conceded. He wanted to reach out, put his hand on his shoulder again, tell Dean he could talk to him. Dean just dried his hands and walked out of the bathroom, brushing up against him, touch like a static shock jolting Castiel into movement. He followed Dean down the hall and stopped just in the doorway to Dean’s room. He wanted to follow further, but he wasn’t convinced he was welcome.
.” he begs. Castiel obliges. He takes Dean in his mouth, pushing his head to the back of his throat. “Fuck!” Dean fully seated in his mouth, his hands fly up to tangle in Castiel’s hair. It’s almost as good of a sensation as him being in his wings.
When Dean finished his platter, they left the bills on the table and returned to the car. Another short drive lands them at the front doors to the just opened morgue. It takes Dean only a minute to charm his way to the bodies stowed away in the back and Castiel follows close behind. Once left alone, they roll out the trays that rest behind closed cubby doors to display the array of victims. The first is a young woman, likely just out of her teens, with her throat torn. It had not been done delicately and Castiel almost winced thinking about the suffering she must have endured. The second body was a man’s, mid-forties and built. If it had been a regular attacker, he would have come out of the skirmish unscathed, but his neck bore the same rough tears the first woman’s did. The third and final body was another man, late twenties and scrawny. Again, his throat harboured punctures and tears.
“I guess not. We should head back.”
“Cas.” Dean’s voice croaks from his throat the second he pulls away to scrounge for air in his lungs. It would have startled him, but from the touch of Dean’s soul he had known Dean was going to move before it happened.
“Cas?”
Castiel stops talking as the first icy flecks begin to drop from the clouds. Already heavy and large, the snowflakes start to come down. The ground beneath their feet is firm and cold, far too ready for the snow for it to cause any to melt, and instead offering the perfect place for the fallen flakes to gather. They watch for a moment as a thin layer begins to form on the ground around them.
The recounted tale didn’t offer much new information to them, but it did solidify that after all these years, whatever is out there is still taking people. A Wendigo would make sense here and the fact that no one went out there for such a long time would imply that the creature had not scored a fresh meal in many years. It was likely desperate to get new additions to its supply, so when tourists started returning, foolishly ignoring the warnings of the locals, the creature was undoubtedly ready for the hunt.
Cas, may I, I, oh
Dean pulls out his map a little ways in, flipping and turning it until he’s sure that he’s holding it right. There are spots marked on the paper signifying where the tourists were supposed to have been and after a minute or two of debate, they choose a direction and keep walking.
Permission granted, Dean comes entirely undone. Enraptured, he screams, he yells Castiel’s name to the torn wallpapered walls and to the Heavens above. He spills over himself, leaving sticky white trails up his stomach. That is enough for Castiel and he follows Dean through ecstasy. His hips stutter as he comes and Dean continues to cry out, destroyed voice reduced to broken whimpers. It takes time to come down, to untangle himself from Dean.
It’s late afternoon now and the sun is already threatening to take away any bit of warmth it has offered thus far. He looks again, desperate to see anything that could help, when his sight catches on a break in the trees in the distance.
Dean makes a fair point. The police are generally useless in these situations, but even more so than usual in this case. So Castiel nods, affirming the lack of need to visit the local station as he finishes browsing the papers.
It doesn’t take long for Dean to pull them up to the edge of the forest once they are beyond the city. He finds a wooden awning extending over a few parking spaces near the entrance to a park and bets on that as the safest place for his baby in case the weather turns sour.
Castiel blinked; that was all? He was just here to check on Dean? Make sure he doesn’t somehow make it worse? He should be bothered, he really should, having to drive all the way out here in the middle of the night when he was in the middle of something, but he couldn’t find it in him. If he was being honest, he was thrilled that that was the only job asked of him. He was always happy to talk with Dean.
“Of course. I am a ways away, though. It may take me over a day to get there.” It’s just about a full 24 hour drive to get to Michigan from Montana, but he’s not so human as to require rest stops. That being said, no one likes sitting in the same seat for hours on end, so bathroom breaks or not, he can’t guarantee that he wouldn’t like to stretch his legs (and wings) every so often.
He kisses Dean’s inner thigh once. “Beautiful.” Twice. “Gorgeous.” Once more, on the other side, just barely higher up. “Good.” The next kiss is placed at the base of Dean’s cock and he smiles against it as Dean writhes beneath him. Castiel lays his hands on Dean’s hips and stills him.
Dean’s fingers are colder than he’s ever felt them when they come into his. It’s clear the cold has seeped into Dean’s bones and Castiel rushes to free him from the water. With some struggle, they get a good, strong hold on each other and Castiel pulls. In another moment, Dean is on top of the ice again, soaked and shivering, but
Dean takes in a sharp breath and Castiel can feel how tight he is with the pads of his fingers.
of a blade accompanies the sound of a sticky spot of blood falling from his cheek to the floor as he pushes himself back onto his feet. Dean squints his eyes at the large flash of light that comes from behind the demon fighting him. The light distracts the vermin in front of him long enough for Dean to take an uncertain step forward and plant his fist right under his borrowed chin. He’s sure his knuckles split at the impact, but it’s too dark to be sure.
lie to him, he was finding it hard to keep his own pressing questions from spilling from his mouth. He gave Dean a hard look back and let out a grumpy sigh.
It took Castiel a moment to process what he said. “I drive you crazy?” He furrowed his brows, unsure what he could have meant by that. Did Castiel really upset him that much? If he did, why would Sam want him here when he couldn’t do anything but tell the truth? Maybe this was some sort of cruel punishment they had cooked up; he couldn’t be sure.
They turn back towards the direction they came, noses already turning a bright shade of red, and start the trek back. The snow starts coming down even heavier though, if that is even possible, and soon the trees all start to look the same. Any markers they could have left to follow their previous path have been covered in snow, pressed into the dirt and weighed down by icy flurries. Branches get covered as well, layering up to hide any defining features that could tell them where they are. The longer they walk, the more the snow builds up around them, hiding their past footprints and getting them turned around. By the time they’re out there longer than their initial hike up, the snow is banked up to their shins.
“Goody.” Rowena uttered and walked out of the room, Sam and Dean in tow.
“Hm?”
“Dean? Are we sure that anything even happened here? I -”
“Truth be told? So am I.” Dean turned again, this time so he was facing Castiel in his bed. “I love you” He said it again. And again and again. Smiling more than Castiel has seen him do in years.
“Dean, come on, I’ll call Rowena; I’m sure she can lift this in no time.” Sam had caught up with Dean in the kitchen where he was angrily sliding a beer off of the refrigerator shelf. He twisted the lid of easily and sent a pointed glare in Sam’s direction.
