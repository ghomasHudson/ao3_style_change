Together, they all moved onward to the stuffing station. Peter was very thankful in that moment that the husbands were wildly attractive. The teen girl was more than distracted as she stuffed the pug, and gave Peter the small heart to slide in before sewing it shut. He was too old for stuffed animals, none of this was exciting. He could’ve acted bored out of his mind, but because of the way Tony and Steve were watching only him and ignoring the cute girls desperate attempts at grasping their attention, Peter couldn’t help but reward the two with giving the heart a small childish kiss before it was placed into his new toy. It hadn’t even occurred to him that he had done something to please them out of jealousy, until they were walking through the empty parking lot.
And after that, Peter was allowed to eat banana nut pancakes in the living room while Sophia the First played on repeat. Tony, shockingly, even let Peter dress himself. Well, sort of. He let Peter pick out his own shirt, which was a pretty big deal. They had grilled cheese for lunch, so that Peter could feed himself, and spent a good half hour outside swinging on the swing set when the sun came out and warmed the chilled air.
Halfway through the episode, Tony had eased into that lax contentedness somewhere between normal and subspace. Steve was a warm sturdy presence, his caresses firm and constant. Tony’s eyes slid shut and he let out a murmur of contentment.
Harris laughed loudly.  Tony raised an eyebrow and looked up at him consideringly.  (It wasn’t that funny was it?)
Tony had just fallen out of bed. He blinked owlishly at Steve for a moment, his eyes struggling to focus. Then his expression went sharp—he smirked.
Then again, there were things Steve was unsure about.  Maybe he wouldn’t know it was upsetting until they tried it.  Was that why Tony wanted him to pick a safeword now?  Was Tony planning to try some of the things Steve had marked unsure?  Tonight?  He thought Tony wouldn’t try any of that so soon.  Maybe there were things Tony really wanted that Steve had marked unsure?  Would Tony want to hurt him?  Steve’s heart be at a little faster at the thought.  It was appealing and unappealing at the same time.  Steve shivered.
Steve took a long and deliberate calming breath, then said in a measured voice: “Well. I don’t use most of those things anyway.”
Tony let out a little huff. “It was obviously a mistake--I got the story wrong. Civil Rights Lawyer Steve would obviously be anti-torture and you should be too.”
Tony stretched again and rolled towards her with a little purring sound, then burrowed into the pillows some more. He nodded and let his eyes slip shut again.
Earlier, Tony had eaten a heaping plate of pancakes, bacon, and eggs, which he’d praised to the sky making Steve want to preen and puff out his chest.  Steve had even kissed Tony in the kitchen—twice!  And, okay fine, nobody had actually been present to see it, but still.  Tony had seemed almost hesitant when he mentioned having some projects in his workshop, but Steve had shooed him down to work and play.  (See?  Not trying to change you!)  Then Steve had left for his run.
her would have been fine with Tony too.  But no—they just weren’t emotionally and orientationally compatible.  (And deep down, he knew it was relief he felt not disappointment—relief that they could never try, so he could never fuck it up.)
“And I’ll have the Californian.  And, hey, could you have them toss some arugula on those, just to annoy Steve?”
“I guess lots of people did, but I never expected that.” Steve looked sad. “I mean, I hoped for some of it but . . . I wasn’t exactly . . .” He shrugged and shook his head again, then fell silent, looking down at his hands folded on the table. There was something distant and melancholy in the gesture; Tony hated it.
JARVIS complied silently. Tony shook his head. His hands felt clammy. (Duh. He was covered in sweat from training with Clint.) He took a deep breath.
Tony knew a losing battle when he saw one, but that didn’t mean he had to cave gracefully. He glared back.
“Shit. I should call Katie Winters. I should have called her first. I’m an Avenger! What was I thinking? We work together!”
In the end, two servings of rich pasta and two glasses of wine were his undoing. Tony was sleeping, head on Steve’s shoulder, before the Mines of Moria.
“Huh,” Tony said with a wry smile. “When you put it like that, the hate-fuck against a wall almost sounds sweet.”
He had, through sheer genius, gotten the metal rim of the arc reactor down to one centimeter in width and redesigned it so the device stood only 0.5 cm out of his chest.
“Stark!” Fury growled.  “That's enough!”  He turned to Rogers.  “Stark is here as a consultant, not a full member of the initiative, but--”
*Jay Wiseman’s SM101 is a very good book and I’ve tried to use quotations from it with respect.  I in no way wish to imply that his book is to blame for the emotional panic Steve is going through at the end of this chapter, though I do think it’s probably an even better beginner’s book for aspiring Dom(me)s than it is for subs. Not everything in SM101 is in accord with my personal BDSM philosophy, but that’s totally fine and there are, as Tony told Steve, lots of different and valid ways to practice safe, sane, and consensual SM.  (To a certain extent, everyone has to figure out what works for them as they go along.)  I met Mr. Wiseman in the SF scene a few times; he was welcoming and kind to me when I was a novice and I’m very grateful to him.
2) self-defense training (“Better,” Nat said with a slight nod. “You’ve got enough practice escaping a Tucson Hold. Back to basics: incapacitating a much bigger opponent. Clint?”)
eyes.)  Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, pulling him close, then shuffling them backward towards the bed.
“Hardly,” Natasha said with an annoyed huff.  “Alexeyev was in Brooklyn.  Rogers was merely an entertaining side project while I was in the area; I could hardly avoid noticing him.”
“Thank you, Captain,” Dominick said, in a condescending tone.  “Your plans for training are admirable; however, we’ve identified a few areas where you would benefit from SHIELD support.”
“You feel so good,” Tony whispered softly.  He leaned down to kiss Steve’s neck and shoulders, and Steve stirred a little and turned his head for a kiss.  The angle was awkward, but Tony’s lips were warm and soft.
. . . you wanted me to read.”  (Ha!  I was right!)  “And I just wanted to say once more that, I really do want to learn.  Tony, I’ll read whatever you want to give me.  I mean, I’d like to.”  Steve smiled at him—the shy, head-tilted smile that Tony loved so much.
A quick shower and an hour looping around skyscrapers and coasting over the Hudson had done wonders for Tony’s mood.  He’d considered calling Pepper, but he knew what she’d say so instead he called Rhodey to vent.  It had gone straight to voicemail and Tony realized belatedly he didn’t even know which time zone Rhodey was in at the moment.  Still, the crisp sound of “You’ve reached Lt. Colonel Rhodes.  Leave a brief message.” made Tony feel a little better.  Tony headed home and walked down his frankly glorious landing pad, armor unfolding as he walked.
Steve was giving him deer-in-headlights look. (Okay, well, he’s startled. Fine. Give him a moment.) Steve seemed to be holding his breath, his eyes wide and his body frozen stiff. He made no move to take Tony’s hand.
Tony rambled on, bringing in a familiar rant: “And, seriously, you know SHIELD’s always cutting corners! They won’t pay for Stark tech, but expect the crap they buy to work just as well. So knowing them the guy was probably cut-rate!” Amusement flickered across Steve’s face for a moment.
Steve tried not to grimace. He resisted the urge to rub his cheek; it still sported the purple evidence of his last skirmish with some bullying beta.
him? Was Tony some sort of project?  Did Rogers think he could make Tony omelets, get his trust, get him under then pull the strings himself?  Put Tony in his place—lock him up, pin him down.  Fuck.  That was--
Tony rubbed his eyes.  It felt good to work on a project like this.  It was good to use brains and hands and just sink into it.  But, now it had been . . . how many hours since he got back from Bruce’s lab?  Nine?  Maybe ten?  Not sure.
When Tony woke up JARVIS was still reading Stark Industries’ Quarterly Report, though he must have been on the thirtieth repetition by then. Tony’d slept for eleven hours.
“Yeah,” Tony said.  His heart was pounding and he wanted to get out of there.  He stared at Rogers a moment, then shook himself a little.
Tony bristled and answered before Bruce could say anything: “I didn’t realize that was something you needed to know.”
Tony took a deep breath and tried to lose himself in the creativity of invention and the clarity of stats and specs.  Somehow it wasn’t quite working.
Steve leaned heavily against the kitchen counter, slouching on his bar stool and frowning at the twenty-two tabs he had open on his laptop.  Trying to find a good restaurant in New York shouldn’t be hard, but finding a restaurant for a date with Tony posed a bit of a challenge.  The restaurant needed to be good, obviously, but not so swanky that Steve would feel uncomfortable.  (Also, best if it’s not the sort of place the paparazzi hang around…) So, someplace quiet and homey where they wouldn’t attract too much attention.  Of course, there was the usual shawarma joint, Tony’s favorite Chinese restaurant, the sushi place Bruce loved, the fried chicken joint Thor dragged them to, Clint’s pizza place (not as good as Piaci), and Natasha’s
“Again,” Steve said to them all, “Nice work. And now, I’m gonna go hit the showers.” He waved. “See you later!”
Tom was neither surprised nor sorry to see Jerry roll on Agent Dominick like a snowball down a mountain. Tom had disliked Agent Dominick since the moment they met and he’d said, “Hey, kid, anybody ever tell you that you look
“Good morning, Mr. Stark,” Rogers said with a smile, looking up from his honest to god black-and-white newsprint newspaper. The kind that smelled and got ink on your fingers.
Mrs. Rhodes patted his hand reassuringly and shook her head, clearly amused. (Oh, right. She was teasing.) “Don’t be silly, dear. The oven you have is fine. Just want to be sure there isn’t an arc reactor in there to mess up the timing on my pies.”
There’s more world-building (particularly re: international kink / racism / cross-cultural practices) coming up, but it didn’t fit here thematically.  Sorry!
Tony’s eyes glittered. “I always knew exactly where you were. Why did you think you hadn’t seen me for so long? Everybody else did.”
“Bla bla the usual,” Tony said with a shrug. “Beautiful people, mean people, self-absorbed people, sprinkled with occasional idealists. You know I’m fond of Sam Deetz and Rebecca Martinez, right?”
And Pepper had wanted to leave it at that, but Tony badgered her.  Apparently, Lang donated heavily to the DOMSS (Defenders of Matrimonial Structural Stability), the OFTF (Organization for Traditional Families), and ORG (the Orientation Research Group—such an innocuous name for a dubiously legal organization dedicated to finding a chemical “cure” for male submission). Jacob Lang made Mark Huckabee look like a liberationist liberal. And Lang had always prided himself on running a “morality-based corporation,” so apparently Stark Industries had competition as a result. Hammer Corp also wanted to pounce on Lang’s crumbling empire and Pepper was struggling to snatch Lang Inc. first at the best price she could get.  Reminding Lang of the “Stark” in Stark Industries wouldn’t help them.
And this time there wasn’t much that could by called shy or uncertain in Steve’s manner.  The hand at the small of Tony’s back was firm. (Masterful.)  He didn’t hesitate at the doors or over paying for the taxi.  Tony had given him clear permission and he was happy to accept.  There was something decidedly sexy about Steve’s new confidence.
are apparently crazy enough you don’t want to hit it, doesn’t mean there aren’t a hundred million red-blooded American subs—single and hitched alike—who’d drop for him in a minute, myself included. And, you know Theressa’s a
has said that to me before,” Tony said, shaking his head with a chuckle. “You’re a strange guy, you know that?”
“I never wanted a wife and kids. Never expected I’d find a husband either, but—” He looked wistful, turning his gaze away, expression distant. “But when I hoped, I hoped for this special fella. Smart, strong, self-sufficient. Somebody who wouldn’t have wanted to stay home, even if I coulda supported him; somebody who
“Sorry. I just wanted to talk to you in private. To make sure we’re on the same page. See, this is the first time we’ve both gone to SHIELD—together—since we’ve started . . . since we’re, uh—”
“Now though,” Steve continued, “I seem to have more time than I need.  I mean, it was nice at first but I can’t quite shake the feeling I’m being a kind of . . . idle.”
Tony blinked, feeling a little silly.  Cap had been awake for months now, reading up on everything he'd missed.
The room was quiet for a moment before Steve said, “It looks like a very sound strategy to me. I’m only concerned about execution. And thank you both for the additional reading materials. I found them very helpful.”
Rogers was sitting at the kitchen table alone when Tony entered.  The Captain started to get up, then slammed his ass back down onto the seat; he dropped his eyes to the book open on the table.
“Better,” Tony said, caressing Steve’s cheek.  “It’s a hard skill.  You can’t learn it all at once. Try again.”
Anyway, hard at work on chapter 13!  It's been giving me trouble, but I hope to have it up soon... We'll back to present day Steve, Tony, and Rhodey.  Woo!  Thanks for reading!  Hope you liked this!  (And, yeah, poor Steve....)
“To be fair,” Tony said, “That tree is so big five little Avengers will hardly stand out. It’ll be like Where’s Waldo in there.”
, tell me,” he stepped closer, “was it SHIELD’s idea to send you under cover as a sub or was it your own inspiration?”
“There you are!” Tony exclaimed as Natasha and Clint stepped out of the elevator. “Let the record state I was here and ready before you were. Even before Steve.”
“Mmm.” Steve let out that rumbling little noise again and reached down to caress Tony’s neck. Tony pressed up closer against Steve’s leg, then couldn’t resist turning to look at him.
“Well whose fault was that?” Tony asked. “Glad to see this time you’ve arrived at a sensible hour, so I’m not about to dash out the door.”
“That’s a good question,” Tony said with a sharp smile.  He’d already chewed out all the minions in the spectrometer’s immediate vicinity, but—ah!  Mr. Star-Spangled Self-Righteous was standing a bit apart, his back to the carousel. (Locking onto new target now.)  Tony grinned, eager to vent his frustrations.  (Okay, Captain Golly Shucks, let’s see how your patriotic politeness holds up under pressure.)
“My favorite,” she said, looking up at him with a pleased smile.  Tony tossed one of the throw pillows on the floor and folded to his knees at her side.
“God, Tony? You want to drag God into your anus?” Jackie let out a startled laugh. “Oh wow, that went somewhere filthy fast.”
“Ms. James,” Steve said and she immediately slumped.  “Uh, Veronica. I don’t— I mean, I really can’t.  I have--”  (
They hopped off the bike-- Tony so gracefully.  Steve felt heavy and awkward in comparison, his body thrumming with anticipation.  Tony grasped Steve’s left wrist in one hand, holding it hard with a not-quite painful pressure, as he guided Steve to the elevator.
Steve looked intrigued, but not nervous as he followed Tony to his bedroom.  (And isn’t that a classic illustration of the difference between us?  If Steve ‘wanted to Talk’ I’d already be shitting my pants….)  Once Tony closed the door, Steve was right there, all strong muscles and hot skin pressed up against his back.
They were quiet a moment before Rhodey opened awkwardly, “So, uh, Pepper says you’re seeing someone new.”
Ave going on one of their hotdog runs. Steve was laughing with his head thrown back. Tony remembered—he’d been trashing the iPhone vehemently and hyperbolically (for Steve’s amusement) and he’d gestured extravagantly while holding his hotdog; the relish went flying off and scattered a little clutch of pigeons on landing. In the photo, Tony’s eyes were very bright, laugh lines squinting up at the corners.
Steve focused on his lesson with single-minded attention, pushing away his own arousal as much as he could.  Tony’s praise and filthy muttering grew more and more ragged the longer Steve worked and, although it wasn’t quite the triumph he was working towards, it was very gratifying to hear Tony’s voice go more and more desperate until eventually (how long had it been?) Tony pulled Steve off his cock.
Tony nodded and Steve entered, closing the workshop door behind him. They stood staring at each other in silence for long, painful moments.  Steve was still wearing his uniform, but must have left his snowy boots in the boot tray when he came in. He’d changed into his house slippers; they looked ridiculous with his combat uniform.  Any other time Tony might have teased him about it.
(Damn it!) Tony hadn’t really expected playing possum to work on a trained soldier, but failure was infuriating all the same. Tony’s chest heaved. (What? fighting
“I’m gonna tell the team there’s an emergency and head out in the suit,” Tony said. “I’ll be there in two hours. Tops!”
(Dork.) Tony felt a ridiculous surge of affection for the man. As he returned to their table, Tony ran his hand across Steve’s shoulders and, when Steve looked up with an inquiring smile, leaned down to kiss him chastely on the lips.
Steve looked at him carefully for a few moments, frowning, before his expression cleared. He nodded and said, “Okay. Uh, good.”
They were quiet a few moments. Tony cocked his head; Clint didn’t usually come down to the workshop.
Steve looked at the closed elevator doors for a few moments, then took a deep breath.  Well, that was . . . unsettling.
p.s. "Love means never having to say you're sorry" is an iconic line from the hit 1970 film "Love Story" about a cross-class love story, love, forgiveness, and mortality.  It's a memorable film, but this line always struck me as absolute bullshit.
“Yeah, that’s it, sweetheart,” Tony said, settling between Steve’s spread legs.  He held Steve’s hip down with one hand and stroked his inner thighs with the other.
Tony blinked.  His heart sped a little and his cheeks felt slightly warm, but it was just the exertion of flying the suit.  Contrary to popular opinion, it was quite physically demanding.
Tony could picture it somehow—Steve tiny and sick, Bucky this big strong kid, a dingy tenement walk-up. In his mind, they sit together in a window seat, looking down at the street, the bustling city little Steve is too sick to join. Tony’s throat felt tight.
. . . )  Above him Tony gave a warm little chuckle as he continued to knead Steve’s neck and shoulders, pressing down hard with his thumbs.  It felt amazing.  (No one has ever touched me like this . . . God, you’re amazing.)  While Tony massaged him, Steve started to roll his hips, unthinking, against the mattress, giving his aching dick some of the friction he’d been longing for.
He nearly whined in disappointment when Tony let go of his cock, but then he moved his hand lower to fondle Steve’s balls.  Steve’s breath caught.  He spread his legs, desperate and willing to beg, but not quite finding the words.  (
Thank you so much for sticking with me for so very long.  I hope you enjoy the new chapter.  It was quite a struggle!
“Birdbrain better love it—stupid macho Dom, trying to go bare armed.” Tony rolled his eyes. He tilted back a bit to bump into Pepper. “So, think we can come up with a market for any of this stuff?” Tony joked. “Think the board of directors might like this?”
Something caught his eye just before he closed it.  Seriously?  Rogers had been watching “Bratty Subs Brought in Line”?  Ew.  Just
“Yeah,” Tony said, still trying not to laugh. Then he asked with sudden inspiration, “and when you were standing up to a bully back then, how’d you feel if somebody stepped in for you?”
Tony took a hesitant forward and looked up at Steve hopefully, willing him to understand what Tony meant without hearing it put into words.
“Yeah,” he agreed faintly. (Shit.) He was pretty sure the whole team had seen him doing his best stripper dance, shaking his booty left and right on the table and maybe gyrating about the living room. Tony’s cheeks flushed with unwilling embarrassment. (Whatever. There was nothing to be embarrassed about, damn it. He hadn’t done anything wrong.) Tony curled up around Pepper again, trying to hide his blush.
It was the sort of thing Jackie usually said with mock offense and an air of playfulness. Today he said it with uncharacteristic earnestness.
Tony frowned. He was really curious what had led to Rogers’ revelation about sexual harassment, but it seemed like asking would be rubbing it in. And part of him sort of wanted to ask if Rogers had been serious about the dinner
Holy shit. Peter had won. He hadn’t been expecting things to go this well, but Tony had actually given in to Steve. Peter smirked to himself, but made sure to wipe all traces of smugness off his face as he uncurled himself from Steve’s arms. “May I please have a band-aid?” Peter asked, blinking his doe eyes innocently as Steve broke out into a grin. “Of course you can pumpkin, let’s get you all bandaged up.” And as Steve carried him up to his bathroom, Peter had come to the realization that he’d just learned of an efficient way to weasel out of punishments, should he need it in the future.
His attire had drastically changed as well. They still had him in a pull up, but Peter was wearing jean leggings, and an oversized black hoodie. As soon as he was allowed out of the vehicle, Steve had pulled Peter’s hood up and shielded his face as a precaution.
Peter couldn’t stop smiling as the dough was then rolled out with their hands, and placed on a greased cookie sheet. By the time they had went through the whole bowl, Peter’s fingers were an absolute mess. To his surprise, again, Tony let him lick them clean instead of using a wet rag. He still had to wash them afterwards, but at least he got to taste the dough!
“Sorry…” Peter finally spoke, sheepishly as he drew himself back into the moment. Tony stood next to him with a whisk in his hand, and an overflowing cup of sugar in the other. He shook his head with a chuckle, and sat the measuring cup down. “It’s okay pumpkin. Why don’t you let Daddy do the measuring, and then you can help me stir, okay?” Tony suggested, glancing at the recipe within the propped open cookbook.
“Alright sweetie, a puppy dog it is.” Tony chirped, leading them over to the much larger selection of different breeds and colors of dogs. Peter stood frozen, eyes staring at his options as his hands slid into the pocket of his hoodie. It really was weird wearing adult clothing again…
There was a husky, a poodle, a labrador… Peter’s eyes finally landed on the dog closest to the bottom, and he broke out into a soft laughter. It was a pug. “That one Daddy- please.” Peter spoke, speaking above a whisper. His eyes immediately widened, and a hand rose to cover his mouth. Tony nor Steve acted upon it, treating his words like they were normal as Steve reached down and plucked the pug skin off from it’s rack. Peter swallowed nervously as he turned to face the center of the store, thankful to find no staff lingering around.
Peter briefly smiled, before he pulled back to look up at the male with more confidence behind his eyes. “No,
Peter cracked a smile, humored by the idea of having flour up his nostrils. “Okay, Daddy.” He answered before carefully beginning to stirs it’s contents. Tony stepped back to watch his little boy aggressively move his arm, whisking together the hardening cookie dough. While Peter was concentrated, Tony slipped out his phone and snapped a picture, laughing at how even after warning Peter, his boy still managed to get flour all over his apron. His phone was slid back into his pocket when Peter made a distressed noise in the back of his throat, and threw a frustrated look in Tony’s direction.
Peter blushed, but nodded his head anyways. He’d been so excited to do something ‘adult’, that he dived right in, head first. Gradually, the once empty bowl in front of Peter was filled with a variety of ingredients. Flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, vanilla extract, butter, and eggs, which Tony allowed Peter to help crack. Once everything was poured in, Tony handed Peter the whisk with an encouraging smile. “Now, be gentle at first, if you stir too hard, you’ll have flour up your nose.” Tony warned, jokingly.
But this time, Peter knew exactly what to do to avoid a round of painful swats. One arm wrapped tightly around Steve’s toned torso, while his other one lifted to show off the now bleeding cut on the tip of his finger. Peter frowned deeply, looking up into Steve’s concerned face. “Papa, look, I hurt myself on the paper.” Peter whined, purposefully making his voice sound more childish than normal. He’d done this a few times before, once or twice without even knowing it. Steve immediately reached under Peter’s armpits to hoist him up onto his hip, using brute strength to keep the male up with one arm. “Oh no, what happened little one?” Steve asked, glancing between Peter and a suspicious Tony.
The sound of heavy rain splashing against the glass of his window filled the room, matching in beat to Peter’s frantically beating heart. “D-D-Da-” Another flash of light struck across the sky, followed by the boom of an angry thunder. Peter sucked in sharply, his hand immediately darting out to scoop up an armful of the stuffed animals on his bed. “Daddy! Papa!” Peter shouted, his voice tight within his closing throat. They hadn’t had a storm in quite some time, but it was April, and along with April came many, many showers.
He wasn’t ecstatic about being brought to build a bear, in fact, he was a little embarrassed to be seen in actual public with two other adult males, walking into a children’s toy shop. But it was a mall, with people. Normal people. How could he not be excited about that? There was a grin to his face the moment he stepped out of the car. Yes, stepped. Since they were no longer behind the safety of their community, Steve and Tony would have to resort to letting Peter walk by himself. The mall was practically empty at this hour, but it still would raise suspicion if a person the size of Peter was seen being carried around.
His face ducked downwards, burying itself within the plush toys in his shaking grasp. If he couldn’t see the lightening, it would be less scary. Mere seconds ticked by before another clash of thunder rung, this one loud enough to shake the walls of his bedroom. Peter let out a sob, squeezing his eyes shut as he tucked his legs inward, curling himself into a ball on the bed. “DADDY!” He wailed again. His toes interlocked with each other beneath the bedsheets, doing anything and everything to distract himself while the husbands rustled awake from their sleep.
so!!! Maybe Tony and Steve decide to take Peter to build a bear after seeing how much he likes his plushie??
He blinked, only turning towards the shell of animal ‘skins’ when Tony cleared his throat. “Would you like a dinosaur to go with your dragon?” Tony asked, reaching out to point at the small selection of dinosaurs. Peter wrinkled his nose. He truthfully didn’t care about which animal they chose, but he supposed it would be interesting to have an array of all different sorts of animals. “I don’t have a dog.” Peter responded after a silence. Both Tony and Steve smiled, and shared a look. They were getting somewhere.
There were many things in which Peter found to be overly frustrating, like how the reed of his sippy cup only allowed portioned swallows, or how Nebs would ask every day at daycare for half of his snack, but one thing that truly irked the male, as silly as it sounded, was being forced to cut with child-proof scissors. Not only were the holes for his fingers too small, but the blades were as dull as a blade of dead grass. Peter was meant to be cutting out the horribly drawn bugs so that he could hang them up in his room, but so far, none of them were turning out. A growl slipped past his gritted teeth, before Peter just decided to give up. “Ugh, fuck it!” He snapped harshly, tossing the scissors to the floor in his pent up rage. Peter snatched up the piece of paper, and angrily began to tear it to shreds.
Tony shook his head, and leaned down to press a soft kiss to the top of Peter’s head. “He’ll like them because you made them.”
Tony was holding him bridal style, standing them in the center of the room as his body swayed in a calming motion. There was a reassuring smile on his face, soft paternal eyes staring down into Peter’s wild fearful gaze. “We’ve got you little one, nothing can ever hurt you.” Tony spoke softly, leaning forward to press a gentle kiss to the center of Peter’s forehead. The words were comforting to him, settling the adrenaline into a dull roar. Peter relaxed, slumping inward against Tony’s sturdy chest. He nodded slowly, glancing over to Steve whom was focused on covering the window with the supplied curtain.
“Do you think Papa will like them?” Peter asked worriedly when everything had been placed in the sink, and the cookies were baking in the double oven. Tony frowned, lifting up Peter and setting him up onto the now cleaned counter. “Of course he’ll like them baby, why would you say that?” Tony asked, reaching out to tuck some of the soft brown hair behind Peter’s ear. Peter bit his lip, and shrugged as a heated warmth spread to the skin of his cheeks. “I don’t know.” Peter responded truthfully, flickering his embarrassed gaze upwards to meet with Tony’s concerned eyes.
“What can I help you with today?” Called one of the ladies, around Peter’s age as she approached them. Peter gave her a once over, and for a moment felt shock that he was looking at a person of his age, good-looking, that was
“Peter, sweetie, it’s okay!” Called out a worried Steve as he raced into the room. The light switch was hurriedly flipped on, filling his room with something other than the bolts of flashing light throughout the sky. There was a hand in his hair, brushing through the sweaty dampened strands. Another set of arms set to work wrapping around Peter’s frame, and pulling him upwards out of the sheets. “There, there, it’s just a silly storm baby. It’s alright. Daddy and Papa are right here.” Steve continued, coaxing Peter to look out from his pile of stuffed animals, in which he carried with him when moved.
Tony didn’t say anything, only held onto Peter tighter as he carried Peter out of his room and down the stairs. A stuffed animal was placed over Pete’s eyes as they made their way through the dimly lit house, so that the flashes of light wouldn’t startle him into another panic attack. Once inside the husbands room, Peter was gently placed on the bed, tucked in, and given more kisses.
The shy demeanor wouldn’t have the same reaction here, as it would back home. The teen only raised an eyebrow, as if expecting Peter to actually answer, normally. “We’re just looking.” Steve replied for them, giving her a polite smile. Her cheeks tinted a slight pink as she nodded, and told them to grab her if they had any questions or were ready for the stuffing progress. Peter was once again, shocked. He had completely forgotten that both Steve and Tony were very attractive men. Out in a normal public, it wasn’t a surprise that they would receive positive attention.
too much sugar!” Came Tony’s startled cry as he hurriedly reached forward, and took away the measuring cup from Peter’s hand. He paused, sending the man a pouted frown in response. When Tony had mentioned a fun day ahead, Peter had expected play dates and maybe a movie or two, not this. Not that Peter was complaining. So far, the day had consisted of just spending some one on one time with his Daddy. Steve was out for the day on work related business, leaving Tony in complete charge.
The day had already been declared good by Peter, but when Tony suggested they make some chocolate chip cookies for Papa’s return, Peter could hardly believe it. Pancakes AND cookies? In the same day? It was a rare moment of weakness from Tony, and Peter had grasped at it before the opportunity slipped away.
dressed in childish clothing. It almost felt odd, in a way. Unfamiliar? Peter couldn’t place it as he frowned to himself, and shied his eyes away. Tony’s hand placed itself low on his back, patting it comfortingly.
Steve sighed he was too tired to fight Stark “ I couldn’t sleep either so I also wanted to get hot chocolate, Peggy once said it helps with sleep apparently, I never manage to try it out as you know the war didn’t provide that luxury. So I thought I give it a try” he said with tiredness hinted in his voice.
There was a pause for a moment until Peggy some again “Why did you sleep with him Steve?” She ask. Steve thought for a moment and to be honest he didn’t really know himself, Yeah Steve thought once it was stress relief reasons, but was that the really reason he can’t honestly know.
As they both about to walk away, Steve just had to speak up again. “We’re not done here, who is he Stark? Your toy boy or something I know you like them young but god I never thought you be some sort of perv” he sneered. Then a few happens in that moment, firstly Clint snort which resulted him being smack by Natasha. Next Tobias was ready to snap back at Steve, and Tony was also ready to snap back. But surprisingly the final moment was another fist connected to Steve’s face which shock everyone again!
He wasn’t a team player. It was simple work together on the mission and listen to the leader, which was Steve. But does stark listen, no he does the exact opposite and goes rouge and puts everyone in danger.
Clint took the opening to pound Steve in the solar plexus, making him grunt and stagger; Natasha escaped his hold with ease.
As Clint and Natasha joked around and Bruce did his usual pre-socializing impersonation of Eeyore (spiced with Betty longing, but Tony’d learned not to poke that wasps’ nest), it became more and more obvious how silent and still Steve was.  If a person could sit at attention, he was doing it.
If it hadn’t been for the obvious dangers involved in power exchange, not to mention the fact that Steve had
Steve nodded and Tony pulled away, letting a little gust of cool air under the covers.  It was dark in Tony’s bedroom, but Steve could see Tony’s beautiful form backlit by the blue light of the arc reactor.  From the bathroom, Steve could hear the tap running and Tony speaking quietly to JARVIS; the lights came up a tiny amount.
“Why are you even here?” Tony asked, suddenly sounding more confused than belligerent. He squinted up at Steve, like it was hard to focus clearly.
Sorry for the delay!  Thanks to everyone who commented on the last chapter.  Your amazing outpouring of kindness helped me fight some prodigious writer's block and overcome Nervous Writer Syndrome.  Thank you!
“Ah!” Tony cried out again, twisting a little in the ropes.  Steve grasped his hip firmly in one hand to hold him still. He eased his mouth further down Tony’s cock with a soft, slick slide, then pulled back before easing down again.
Instead, Tony went limp, playing possum. Rogers stayed right where he was, panting slightly, eyes bright. Tony summoned his strength and made a final bid for freedom. Tony pressed his shoulders hard into the mat and struggled for leverage, but Rogers was prepared for the attack and too fucking massive for it to have mattered anyway.
And there had been a point not that long ago when Tony would have thought his whole “just a poor kid from Brooklyn” line was false modesty or a jab at Tony for his wealth and privilege. Now he knew Steve meant every word, neither proud nor ashamed, just stating a fact as he saw it.
Steve’s breathing started to shallow out again and his gaze got a little unfocused. He shook his head and turned to look down at Tony, his expression pinched as he said:
Steve just let out a long, deep moan and Tony added another finger.  It ached so perfectly, deep and hot and good.  Everything felt so wonderful.  There was only one thing that could be better, that could--
Steve deleted the note, then rewrote it as just “soon, please.”  Then he rewrote it again the same as before, but left out the closing.  Ten minutes later he added the closing again.  (Yeah, okay, this isn’t easy either. But at least Tony isn’t watching him be an indecisive idiot…)
.  Talking had never been one of Tony's strengths; he'd never been all that good with words and got frustrated and lost his temper too easily.
“So, I take it you’re involved with the restaurant?” Steve asked, scooping up another generous portion of
Steve thought about it--once, twice, several times. Maybe he could ask Stark—Tony?—if he wanted to get pizza? Just go down to the workshop and ask. Or just get a pizza first—(yes, much better)--and bring it down. "Thought maybe you'd forgotten to eat," he could say.
Pepper blinked and Tony worried that he saw some sort of emotion flash across her face—hurt, regret, jealousy, concern,
“It has been a real pleasure watching you work. I admit that I don’t really understand the spectrometer— or well, more accurately, I
Thanks always to thatwhichyields, my Super-Beta!  She makes Story happen. (Bird! Bird! BIRD!) All remaining mistakes are my own.
play nice with all the high rollers there who might donate large sums of money to charity.  Even if they were annoying. And visit the silent auction tables so people who want a picture or a word with an Avenger have to go over there where the silent auction attendants can work their magic.  The usual stuff.
“It’s a decision he would make in consultation with the rest of the team: Dr. Banner, Agent Romanov, and Agent Barton.”
(Well, it was still progress, right? No power on earth could have muzzled them five years ago. After all, his team wouldn’t have had a bargaining chip back then, would they?)
“Mmm-hmm,” Belford murmured. He ran his hand across Tony’s shoulder, then down is arm. “You’re the most interesting person here. And easily the most beautiful.” Tony let Belford pull him in a little closer. Tony gave a little shiver and his heart picked up its pace.
Tony gave her a sincere smile. “Me too.” And with that, he took the elevator down to the lobby where Happy was now waiting with the car.
How was Bruce cool with this?  Bruce was probably Tony’s closest friend on the team!  And Nat—she seemed fine with it too, judging by the menacing looks she’d been casting him since his less than enthusiastic response. Somebody had to do something or this would end in tragedy, and it looked like it fell to him.
Rebecca Martinez was an art historian, codicologist, and paleographer, so she and Steve had an animated conversation about art and curation (as Tony’d hoped).  Sam and Tony talked about the Foundation & Safe House. (Tony hoped to get him on the board of directors) And he and Pepper both enjoyed talking tech and business with the Macmillians, especially Sylvia, unexpected (submissive!) heir to Tyrone’s empire.  It was a good mix and everyone was very cordial. Tony was inclined to pat himself and Pepper on the back for such a well assembled table. (And Katie and Mikie had remembered to put red roses, yellow roses, and white lilies in their centerpiece as he’d requested.)
(No it isn’t.  You know perfectly well why.)  He’d overreacted.  (Not really.)  His stomach twisted and he felt bile in his throat.  (Oh, shit.
Steve leaned down to kiss Tony on the cheek again, faster, more chastely, half-furtive as if he just couldn’t resist.
Steve’s head dropped and he kissed Tony very softly on the lips, then asked in a whisper, “May—may I come in?”
As the evening wore on, their usual teasing banter gave way to a comfortable quiet, both of them nibbling the last of their pizza and savoring their drinks.  (Seriously, should order a case of that Malbec.  Terra Rosa?  Never heard of it, but damn it’s good.)  Little by little, Steve had scooted closer and closer, sitting caddy-corner again.  He kept giving Tony his intimate little smile.  He looked
It was sudden and almost violent, a hot, gasping collision.  Steve needed more contact, more skin, more Tony.  He pressed against him, eager and insistent as Tony pulled him closer.  Tony hit the wall and braced as they writhed against each other.
Some old business bore was droning on at Pepper, only occasionally sparing Tony his attention to say, heavy-handed with innuendo, ‘How very glad everyone was that Tony’d turned his life around . . . and so dramatically!’ Tony let his gaze wander around the great hall; Bruce was at the bar, deep in conversation with Harry Silverstein who nodding effusively at every word; Clint was over by the balcony laughing raucously with a stocky looking switch in a suit; Natasha was nowhere to be seen.
2) Re-upload JARVIS into the SHIELD mainframe.  Seriously—it was pathetic that it took them a full six months to notice and another six weeks to dislodge him…
From his seat, Tom couldn’t make out what he was saying in a low, vehement voice, but he saw Jerry go pale and start shaking his head and protesting loudly: “No! No, it wasn’t like that! Just some silliness!”
Thanks to thatwhichyields, the scope of this story keeps growing!  You are a joy and an inspiration, my dear. Who knows how long this thing will be now!
Tony tried to push aside the inevitable post-mortem of their scene, knew he’d dissect it minute by minute, move by move, he’d figure it out, but right now Steve needed him.  He kept his left arm firmly around Steve’s shoulders, a steady pressure he hoped would anchor him, and continued stroking Steve’s hair, his cheek, neck, shoulders, back—any bared bits of Steve easily in reach that he could run his fingers over in a caress he hoped was comforting.
“It’s fine! I mean, all of this has been pretty sudden. We can take it slow. It’s—“ Tony swallowed. “It’s fine.”
harassed.  Perhaps since, though Rogers was his Captain, Tony didn’t depend on him for income-- not by a long shot--and if Tony wanted out of the Avengers he’d go—and he could throw them all out of his Tower while he was at it!
“I’m already eager for tomorrow,” Steve said warmly. He looked shy as he added, “Thank you for asking me.”
“You’re amazing,” Tony murmured to him, pressing a kiss to his inner thigh.  “Here, let me take care of you.  Give me a second.”
Tony gave a hesitant little nod and swung his leg over the bike; he reached back for the rear brace before remembering (duh, stupid) this model didn’t have one.
"I've never seen anything like it," Phillips said, shaking his head.  "Attractive little omega like you hell bent on carrying a shield."  He squinted at Steve and his voice went a little soft.  "Is this about Barnes?  He fell defending the North Coast and you want revenge?"
Tony crashed to his knees, landing so hard on the concrete that he gasped as pain shot up his body.  He bowed his head and lifted his palms.  He heard Steve take a sharp breath.
“Next question,” Colbert says, “Mary in Rhode Island asks ‘When the Avengers play poker, does Tony Stark count the cards?’”
updated note (3/19/14): I'm going through a bit of madness at work and leaving on an unexpected trip-- this on top of finding the next chapter hard to write and being away from my lovely beta... so, please bear with the delay.  I'll be back, hopefully in early April.  Thank you for your patience!
Tony reached out to touch the dagger again. Some people would understand, wouldn’t listen to that garbage. He was fine.
“Hey, Bruce!” Tony called breezing into Bruce’s suite. His voice was loud over the burbling serenity fountains.
“At least,” Tony hurried on, “I think it will be good.  I mean, I think you’ll like it, but if you don’t we can go wherever you want!  I don’t—“
Steve shook his head. “No. You go down to the workshop. Fix War Machine. Help keep Rhodey safe. I’ll be waiting when you get done.”
Steve was fleeing the kitchen all over again and, clearly, he should just lock himself in his rooms and never—
about Tony-- wanted to hear stories about them at MIT, not the ones Tony always told with a wide grin, looking ahead to the punchline. He wanted to ask about Tony and Mrs. Rhodes, wanted to add one more to the list of people who knew the real Tony, at least a bit. He wanted to ask what Tony had told Rhodey about Howard when he was a teenager, so he could to map out more of that minefield.
“They’re safe,” Pepper said softly. (She knew him so well.) “Rhodey and your team. They all survived the attack.”
Pepper rolled her eyes.  “Honestly, Tony, you know you can’t distract me like that.  And you don’t even want to, so why do you bother trying?”
“Mmm,” Steve hummed in answer, giving a little suck, and Tony wanted so badly to touch him. To run his fingers through Steve’s hair while he sucked cock, to stroke his body everywhere he could reach, wanted to flip them so he could get Steve’s dick in his mouth, wanted to feel full and aching, to choke on it.
“Anyway,” Bruce continued, “self-destructive or not, it's never pleasant to be on the outside watching other people in their zone. People used to joke about all the sorrowing lab widows.”
It had been one of the first things Meredith ever told him back when he’d started dropping by St. Michael’s.  Steve had nearly panicked, thinking she could sense something about him, could tell he was queer, but then he realized that she told
Tony licked his lips and took a slow deep breath, trying to banish the nagging little voice--the one that sounded like a mix of Howard and Obie--that asked
This story is almost done! One more chapter. Maybe two. Done soon though! Yay! :-)  And man, I can't thank you guys enough for sticking with me. I hope you like this chapter! *looks nervous*
and the man he loved: the arc reactor, the strange goatee, the intelligence in his eyes, the scars from battles and the burn marks from his workshop and the look on his face, not smiling right now, no-- too intense, too focused for that, but full of awe and affection and concentration and . . .
“He means,” Tony cut in, still typing, “the readings have changed enough that if that thing starts spewing aliens, my device won’t be able to close the portal until I do
“Great! Good. Sure. I’ll get started,” Bruce said, pushing his glasses up his nose. “Thanks. Uh, right. See you soon. Thanks for brunch, Steve.”
.  Hm.  If Tony could get him out of those terrible clothes, he really was quite handsome.  A few years older than Tony, but in good shape with strong facial features and, seriously, with a mind like Banner's everything else was just extra.  Huh.
The creature now looked remarkably like a five year old’s drawing of Captain America: colors in sort of the wrong places, one leg too thick, one arm too long, no nose, no mouth, eyes too big, but still recognizably
Steve went quiet and turned at the sound of Tony’s footsteps. He smiled at Tony. (That smile. The special one.)
“Yeah,” Tony said. “I’ll see you later.” The doors started to close, but Tony reached out suddenly to stop them. “Oh! And there’s a present for you in your bedroom.” Tony gave Steve a little wink and let the doors shut on his smirk.
“You know, Sam usually can’t drag me to these stuffy parties,” Rebecca said, “but I’m very glad we made it out this time.  It’s been such a pleasure getting to know you, Steve.”
Belford laughed. “And here I thought you might be some other Tony Stark.” He smiled, then added teasingly, “To be honest, I’m even more excited to meet Iron Man. Perhaps you can introduce me?”
Tony spun in a slow circle, taking it all in. He wasn’t sure if he’d ever looked at the whole thing at once before.
Steve shook himself and focused on the present.  (There’s nothing wrong with me.  *Nothing* wrong with me.  Nothing wrong with *us.*)  He took a deep breath.  (These are my friends.)
Somewhere over Cincinnati, Tony remembered to send the team a message through JARVIS, to let them know he was on a quick trip to visit Pepper and the LA headquarters, and that he’d be back in time for the gala. He started sending a message to Pepper too, then aborted it—she was always so much fun to surprise.
“Yeah. He’s just overworked,” Tony answered quietly. “Worried we aren’t prepared for another attack. And he’s had trouble sleeping.”
“All right,” Pepper said, crossing something off on her tablet with her finger. “I talked to her earlier. She was thinking Versace.”
“We have a lot of flexibility, especially with this sort of lead time,” Katie said. “Assuming of course, we’re able to maintain the current time frame; you’re a tactical first response team—so an emergency could change the game in moments and we’d have to use one of the contingency plans and adapt on the go.”
The man smiled; a reserved kind of smile, but warm nevertheless. “You know, I believe you’re right. Thank you, Mr. Stark.”
different, but kneeling for most of the Doms he’d fucked had meant basically nothing, far less than the affection of kneeling with Pepper.  But Steve--
Rhodes was shaking his head and chuckling. He nodded over to Steve, then back at Tony and asked, “Seriously? Can you believe this guy?”
“Sometimes, I hate it here so much,” Rogers mumbled against his knees. He looked up at Tony and said, voice wrecked, “Everything is supposed to be
As Steve studied his face, Tony let his gaze drop. There was something almost too naked in Steve’s expression—awe, affection, tenderness—and Tony didn’t like to think what Steve might see in his own eyes. (At the very least, a mind addled with lust, that was for sure.) He closed his eyes and pressed his face into Steve’s hand, kissing his palm.
Tony disappeared into the bathroom, returning a moment later with a warm washcloth and a glass of water.  He wiped the last of Steve’s come from his belly and the lube from his ass, then tossed the towel aside and settled into bed next to him.  Tony pulled the covers up around them both and Steve let out a little sigh of contentment as he nestled close to Tony.
“Yeah? Well, you did," Tony grumbled. "And I lost my train of thought.” Tony turned back to the soft-glowing screens and added, not looking, “So, food, coffee, whatever, thanks, but just leave it on the table and let me work. I told you to stay out of the workshop, okay? I'm busy.”
“Yeah, cool,” Tony said with a nod, then added more feelingly, “I mean right. We’re definitely a team. And we should, uh, support each other, right?”
“It’s getting late and I found a nice little bistro not too far from base. I was going to ask if I could take you out to dinner, but I suppose—”
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A jolt of embarrassed pleasure coursed through Steve at Tony’s coarse words.  His lips parted eagerly as Tony guided his leaking cock into Steve’s mouth.  Steve caressed Tony’s dick with his tongue, hollowed his cheeks, and
My thanks to Rex Luscus for her hand-holding and all the help with formatting and for making the post-it note!
“What are you going to do with them, though? You already have the two penthouse suites and four floors of workshop space!”
Tony cleared his throat and walked back to the console, eager to put some distance between himself and Captain America.  He waved the box at Bruce, then turned his attention (mostly) back to the scans flashing across the screen.  “The good Captain delivered it personally.”
“Wait, you’re all up here?” Bruce said, frowning and pulling at his tux. “I thought we were meeting at the limo.”
Steve sat, tightly coiled, for a long tense moment then seemed to melt forward. He took Tony’s face in both his hands and tipped their foreheads together.
“There was this priest at St. Mary’s, Father Gabe, who would visit the parishioners too sick to come to Mass. He’d make the rounds and always come visit me for a bit. We all adored him. He had a limp ‘cause he’d been injured in the Great War, but he cut a pretty dashing figure—young for a priest. His sweetheart died of tuberculosis while he was in the trenches and he went into the clergy.”
—and Tony had teased Steve good-naturedly about his love for the crew of the Enterprise.  He’d even promised to take Steve to the Monterey Bay Aquarium sometime.  (They don’t actually have whales there, though.  That was pretty disappointing.)
“Ok, Tones,” Rhodey said, rubbing Tony’s shoulder blades. “Bed.” He paused for a moment, then added, “Missed you, buddy.”
“Maybe we should—” Cap began, but he didn’t get to finish. A thick web shot from the spider-alien’s spinneret to wrap around a nearby agent, pulling him towards it with shocking speed. Black Widow sprang into action, glittering knife unsheathed in a second, ready to cut the web.
“Oh, it’s nothing special,” Steve mumbled. Tony opened his mouth for a rejoinder, but Steve’s stomach rumbled, cutting him off.
Little by little the ropes were unwound.  Once Steve’s wrists were free Tony shifted back around and lifted them, right then left, to examine them.  Whatever he saw must have satisfied him, because he nodded to himself and then caressed them lightly with his fingers.
“All right. I want you to go in the bedroom and kneel on the floor.  I want you to wait for me there while I take care of a few things.  Okay?”
“They don't know you at all, do they?” Pepper murmured softly, tone soothing.  “People don't know how good you are,” she said.  “How sweet you can be.”
Steve held in a sigh.  He stopped and waited while a young woman walked quickly down the corridor to catch up with him.  She was very beautiful, like a film star, with perfect white teeth, glossy red hair, and a luminous complexion.  Actually, she looked a little like Ms Potts, though her figure was more of an hourglass.  She was built like a pinup girl from back in his day and just as pretty.  The thought made Steve uncomfortable.  He cleared his throat.
Next box:  “Begging.”  Steve turned it over in his mind.  (“Fuck me . . . I want you inside me.  I want you to come inside me.  Please, fuck me. . . . I want it. . .  Please . . .”)  Yes, he’d loved that.  Once he’d gotten started, the words just came pouring out so easily and though they hadn’t gotten Steve what he wanted (or, at least, not exactly what he’d had in mind), the look on Tony’s face--!  Steve closed his eyes, picturing Tony again.  Then made the imaginary Tony give him a different look, stern but with affection in his eyes.  And Steve imagined him growling, “Beg for it, Steve.  Tell me how bad you want me, baby.  And if your begging’s good enough, maybe I’ll let you have it . . .”
“I’m ready, I’m good,” Tony begged, “just . . . just fuck me, Steve, don’t—don’t make me wait. Please,
But, well, there was Carbonara and it would be hard to eat kneeling. (The team was there.) Tony settled next to Steve on the couch and resolved to indulge in a little footsie later.
Tony wanted to reach out and pat Steve’s knee, but he couldn’t with Steve all the way across the table.
“No!  Absolutely not, Steve.  Hulk would totally smash Superman—if Superman existed, which he doesn’t.”
Struck by sudden inspiration, Tony flailed awkwardly to get out from under the blankets, sloshing coffee onto the duvet as he went.
They must have made a funny sight, arms loaded with presents making repeat trips up the front steps of Magdalene house: Tony in his Burberry greatcoat and scarf; Steve in a sensible (not designer) navy pea coat, with the shield strapped to his back.
In his bedroom, Tony stripped out of his clothes and crawled into bed, naked and drained. He’d set the little dagger on his nightstand.
Pepper frowned at Steve as he came in, but Tony caught her eye and shook his head.  Her expression lightened.
“You’re lovely,” Steve mumbled, kissing Tony’s hair. Tony smiled and curled a little closer, muscles going lax as he took another deep breath of Steve’s now-familiar scent.
“Well,” Tony said, recovering quickly, “if the spec-o isn’t here yet, there’s nothing for me and Bruce to do except help guard Bob.  So, phasers on stun everybody.”
(“What were you thinking?  Can you imagine how Howard would feel?  Or your mother?  I’m just glad they didn’t live to see this.”)
“You still okay, babe?” Tony asked.  Steve just sucked Tony’s fingers some more and let out a muffled little, “Mmmm.”
But first, Tony reviewed the facts (yet again. . .): Steve had difficulty with public displays of affection; he had done little or no research on BDSM beyond what was necessary for the spreadsheet; he had not experienced PTSD or encountered any sort of trigger during their session; he’d definitely reached subspace, though he didn’t seem to know what that was; he found verbalizing difficult in scene and perhaps impossible while under; he had probably been overwhelmed by the number of new elements Tony had introduced; he had definitely been overwhelmed by the emotions the scene brought out.  (And he loves me…)
“Come on, your grandson would probably get a kick out of you having the same chauffeur as Captain America.”
Steve chuckled.  “I love you too.”  Steve rubbed his cheek against Tony’s chest and up to his neck, nuzzling him like a cat.  Tony stroked him, tension draining out of his body.
And Tony held his head in place with both hands as he flooded Steve’s mouth with cum—hot and bitter, salty and thick.  Steve swallowed around Tony’s cock, flushed with desire and success.  (I did that.  I made you come apart.)  It was a dizzying thought.
Also, if you would like to commission art from LP, there's still time!  Her commissions post is here: http://leperu.livejournal.com/3038.html and a glorious sample of her art, here: http://archiveofourown.org/works/711867.  :-)
“Hey, gorgeous,” Tony called in that quiet, intimate voice the rest of the team never heard.  (Mine!)  Steve was tempted to turn around, but last time he’d been instructed to stay still, so he didn’t move.  Tony dimmed the lights.  He set a bottle, plate, and a small glass on the bedside table, then tossed a black bag onto the bed.
“All right,” Steve said, “We may have a serious communication barrier, but I’m sure this . . . being . . . wants to go home. Iron Man, do you think you can safely touch it to fly it up there?”
before: given someone permission to observe these sorts of courting rituals, agreed to this type of power exchange. Tony Stark—who’d checked just about every box on a master contract at least once, who’d been whipped, and caned, and banged hundreds of times in dozens of countries, who’d been there done that—had found something he’d never done, never wanted to.
Then Tony laid next to Steve and propped up on one elbow to look down at him.  Tony turned from the firm massage to long, slow strokes down Steve’s back.  Tony drizzled oil down his spine, his hands sliding smooth across Steve’s skin.  Tony’s caresses moved lower, little by little, and heat pooled in Steve’s belly again.  With each stroke Tony’s hand moved lower and lower, and Steve’s arousal wound tighter and tighter.  Soon, Tony was stroking his palm across Steve’s ass.  Steve held his breath. He felt certain he was starting to blush.
Steve had had no idea that so many considerations—size of rope, arm position, type of knot—could go into just tying his hands behind his back.  There were pages devoted to it, and safety cautions throughout.  Even untying him required safety warnings:
As he walks deeper into the woods, this is when things start to change. Throughout his time of training Tony always ends up here. This place it’s cold, dark and evil, it’s like a inner part of his trauma morphed into this place. There’s a creature around these woods always ready to chase, always taunting him, the voice of this creatures was familiar, but Tony couldn’t pin point who it belongs too.
“Well Anthony, you may have master in seeing, but there was one little thing I forgot to mention to you. You see with your abilities you can enhance other areas of your body to help you, the gift my mother gave you was like an energy you could say, you could direct it to any area at will with the right training of course” Thor informed.
Fury sighed in frustration, “both of you leave now and maybe just think about what I said and if your any damn good spy maybe you’ll see what I mean. Captain stay I think we need to talk for bit” he said with a scarily calm tone in his voice.
Once time has passed the paramedics checked on both Clint and Natasha and also the other agents. Clint was fine just a few bruises and scraps l, where as Natasha needed to go to the hospital to fix her shoulder and the burns on her legs.
Steve selfishly wanted to know what is happing now but he didn’t want to scare Tony too much so he just simply said “Um Tony about earlier, I just wanted to say....” “Steve not now” Peggy interrupted him. He was surprise at how Peggy was protective over Tony, he always thought they aren’t that close due to the fact Tony doesn’t talk about her all that much, but maybe that was wrong. “But Peggy I need to...” He was going to say apologies but Peggy shut him down quickly “No you listen here Steven, you don’t give Tony a fake apology so you can make yourself feel better, there’s a difference in between saying all the right things to make someone fell better and being sincere about saying the right thing and right now your at the former so you best just shut up now you understand?” Peggy ranted and Steve could only nod in response.
So what do you think, what will Daniel be plotting and what will happen when Peggy and Davis come to the tower.
Thor gave him a serious look “don’t think that finding your soul is easy Anthony, it might weeks even years to find your soul. Not only that if you go too deep into your safe place then you might lose yourself and stay there forever, it is dangerous doing this, but your different and I believe that you can do this. So are you sure you still want to do this?” Thor ask
Back in Tony’s lab, “And done I even had 10 minutes to spares” he said smugly as he puts on the bracelet on his wrist it’s small and narrow like any other bracelet but this one has a very special surprise.
Tobias understood were his grandmother was coming from after she knows Steve better than him, but he can’t help feel slightly anger at the Captain. He sighs “But they shouldn’t be near each other, that’s just going to cause more trouble” he said, Peggy sighs as well “yes they can’t seem to get away from each other, but they are both grown men we can’t separate them as much as we like to. Though maybe there’s a reason why they are all of the sudden acting close” she admits. That confuses Tobias “what do you mean by that?” He asked. “It’s nothing dear just thinking out loud” she quickly said hoping Tobias wouldn’t pursue, it seem to work though Tobias was looking confused, “Right. So... ur... can I saw my project, I think you find very interesting” he spoke changing the subject from their pervious conversation. Peggy smiles at her grandson “certainly my dear, I would love to” she sweetly said, then Tobias was telling her about his thesis, but her thoughts kept going back to her son and her ex love and hoping they are not making a mistake by being too close.
Clint gave a dark chuckle, but he didn’t speak it was Natasha instead. “He means that we got a report from SHEILD that showed that Lieutenant Marks and his wife died in what seems like a car accident a couple of hours after you left the gala abruptly.
Tobias laugh as he walk down the hall “I love you 3000” he shouted then he disappeared into his room. Tony chuckled “wow 3000, did hear that JARVIS my boy loves me 3000”, “ I did sir should I say congratulations” he spoke with some sass in his voice and Tony laughs at his AI.
“Steve it’s not my tale to tell, but if Anthony allows it he might tell you himself, but as of right now you don’t deserve that right” she said with sadden emotion in her voice.
So after that commotion, things turned even more strange, SHEILD rebuild its self and Fury came back to life and decide to make the avengers a things and he (force) politely ask Tony to place the avengers at his tower and Tony reluctantly said yes as despite what people say he was a team player in a sense that it would make sense for everyone to be in the same place even if Tony didn’t like most of them.
He was narcissistic, he always talked about himself. Always brag about how great his life was, how he can get anything he ever wanted, god it aggravated her.
Steve was nervous, he never seen Fury so pissed off about one person especially Stark. He felt awkward and wanted to leave the room one Clint and Nat started to talk, but he had to stay he needed answers. After what happen with Thor he needed to know truth, the real truth.
“It’s been so long hasn’t it Anthony, you’ve gotten older and got some nice pretty scars on you too” he said as he reach his hand to touch Tony’s chest. Tony flinch when Daniel reach out, “Don’t touch me” He snarl, Daniel laughs at his fail attempt to move away from him. “Aren’t you just adorable Anthony, but I’m afraid that I can jut touch as much as I want from now on. You see I own you now my dear, I can do what the fuck I want with you” he said as he moved closer whilst his hand was caressing Tony’s chest.
“My comrades, Anthony’s AI explain there was an incident. Are you both alright?” He ask, both spies nodded “Yeah Thor we’re both okay, Tash just needs her shoulder and burns to look at but nothing serious. As to the incident one of our own was a double agent and an explosion” Clint informs.
Tony was lost for words this can’t be true, Daniel the man you was his best friend when they were just kids, the man who gave him his first kiss, the man he could of loved. But instead he became a monster and hurt like no one else has ever had.
Whilst Tony ponder he realise needed to protected his other family too. Pepper, Rhodey, Davis, and... ah shit his mom. He needs to get her at his tower no way in hell he’s going to leave her at that home god knows what Daniel would do if he knew his mom was there.
Then Rogers clears his throat, “um did you want a drink and we can talk some more out here?” He ask.
And also the home that Peggy is in, knows is funded by SHEILD and SI so only the most trusted people can take care of her.
He felt a hand on his shoulders he looks to see Peggy being much closer to him “ Don’t apologises for me darling, just be here for him now ok that’s all I ask for. I know he can be quite a handful, you just need a lot of patience and learn when he needs help” she said with comfort in her voice and Bruce smiles back at her.
“It’s almost time for me to go this was only a one time use so I’ll be quick” Howard vaguely. “Quick at what...urgh” Tony grunts in surprise as he felt warmth wrapped around him. Howard was hugging him and not only that he was glowing “ this is my last gift for you Anthony you finally got what you’re looking for, so I’ll give you a little idea I had for that blade of yours, and with it you can kick Daniel ass for me would you” he spoke with such emotion in his voice.
“But his attitude is poor and disrespectful, the things he calls me and the others is like bullying, he is a bully” he defended weakly.
“Ouch... what the fuck was that for?” He asked, Natasha gave him a dark look. “Listen you idiot what Steve said was too far and you shouldn’t have jump to conclusions” she growled.
So they talked and talked about everything, his dad told him though not in graphic detail, but still told him how his birth came to be. It was hard to listen and upsetting to, but after weeks went Tobias excepted what has happen in the past and tried to move on and be there for his dad.
But instead of giving tony an answer, Rogers lean down and kissed tony again, it wasn’t gentle by all means, it was rough and lustful. Then Rogers pulled back and smirk down at tony “I think that gives you an answer, but yet it might not. Anyways I better go thanks for the talk Stark I think we understand each other better now” then he walk out shutting the door behind him. Tony was stunned to say the least what did he mean but yet again he guess Rogers wants a second round, well fine by him if this keeps Rogers happy and not shout at him then so be it and hey at least it’s good sex so a win win situation.
Then he walk away, he walk fast trying to escape the crowd. He could hear Steve calling for him in anger, but he didn’t care not right now he needed to leave now. But before he could exit the gala, Pepper step in front of him. “Tony!, what are you doing people are staring at you. Have you lost your mind, these are very important people and if you stop being selfish for one...” “Pepper stop talking alright” he voiced in anger.
“Shut. Up. Now!” Rogers warned his face was so close to Tony’s, that tony can feel the heat of Rogers breath.
He shrugged at Thor “Probably not, but does that really matter now” he just said. Thor wanted to argue, but he knew that would be pointless, Tony is a stubborn man. “Very well” Thor simply said, “let’s begin shall we” he spoke again and motions to the both of them to move closer to him.
“There you are” a frustrated sounded Pepper walk up to them, well mainly to Tony. Now, don’t get Tony wrong he loves Pepper and he sure knows that feels the same about him. But recently him and pepper haven’t been speaking much, as CEO Pepper been travelling a lot to do international business meetings and deals and not to mention the boards meeting in the states which Tony knows is quite challenging, so she in a lot of stress and he understands that. But due Tony’s reckless behaviour with the Avengers during the missions and all Pepper had been getting more stress due and kept sending him angry voicemails and emails saying to cut it out or else kinda thing.
"Bruce I want your eyes in the city if it gets out of hand I will call good green.Spiderman web them up but keep your distance, Nat you are with me on the ground, Carol I want you to cover both ground and air. Ironman, Rhodey and Falcon you are in the air destroy them and call the numbers. We get in, save civilians, kill these things an get out. Ironman, Rhodey and Carol you guys have a head start Nat, Bruce, Falcon,Peter and I will see you there" They went inside the Quinjet and rest of them had already gone.
"Lets watch Shrek" Tony said and everyone nodded. Steve knew that movie as Tony had made him watch it. The movie ended and everyone was informed that the food had been delivered. They were settling down for dinner. Steve was about to sit on one of the empty sides with Tony and suddenly a orange bright circle opened and Strange walked out of it. Steve did not like this guy and here he was again. He knew he was Tony's friend but Steve knew the way he looked at Tony. It was the same way Steve looked at him. Steve could see the smile on Tony's lips and he sighed. He just wanted Tony happy and if this guy made Tony smile Steve just had to suck it up.
"It is a black leather book, a small size which fits right into his pocket. I have seen it a quite number of times, however, he never takes it out. Maybe it is just my guess but its worth a try" Nat replied. Everyone nodded.
Nat broke the silence "I know Tony but we are a family now, its been 2 years and we have had each others back through thick and thin. I mean I love them all and no one is killing anyone Denvers but you are my family now Tony and I have to take care of you like we all do.Peter is worried as well you know consider for him please. I cant see you hurt" or see you drowning in your sorrow. I cant find you again in your own blood or alcohol she thought. Tony had been so angry when steve sent him the letter that he had smashed everything around him and injured himself. Also, he started drinking again and when Carol showed up everything started to go back to normal.
"Sure kid he can stay here. Say hi to May as well. Where is Carol and Rhodey I swear these guys will make me late on purpose" Tony whispered the last part. They knew how Stephen was use to be on time and they wanted a banter show.
They were now laying down in each others arms. Tony had kept his head on Steve's chest and they just laid there quietly.
Everyone started to head off. Vision and Wanda went to pack.  Sam, bucky and Scott were going to watch movies in the cinema room and they asked Peter to join. They knew the kid had a good taste in movies. Peter wasnt sure at first but Tony nodded at him and give him a smile. He knew Tony wanted him to hang out with them and he wanted to give them the chance. He wasnt upset with them he was upset with Steve. Also, the spidey mama as Tony called Nat agreed to come to the movie as well. Peter knew she was being protective and smiled. Also, Bruce was in his lab so Nat thought it would be a good idea to spend some time with Peter. So he agreed and they went to watch Movie.
"Just hold me Steve just hold me" Tony replied and Steve had just held him while they fell asleep under the stars.
"Peter do you really think I would let something happen to Tony and would anyone in this room would be alive" Carol replied looking at Peter. Everyone got up on this sentence. The tension in the room was high.
"She is doing really well. Her abilities have improved and her control is getting better" Stephen replied.
"He had a breakdown after they brought you down. We had to put him down" Nat replied to Tony's question. Tony was shocked. Steve had a breakdown because of him. He never wanted to hurt Steve.
"Steve-Steve Boyfriend?" Tony could not stop laughing. Steve had lost hid mind what is this guy on about now Tony thought.
"I will be leaving the company for a few months and I-" Before Pepper could continue Tony interrupted her "Is it because I did not show up to the last meeting because I will start showing up and where will you go and why are you leaving mmfff-" A hand was placed on Tony's mouth and Steve nodded Pepper to continue. Tony just rolled his eyes.
"No Uncle Tony with play with me first, right uncle Tony?" Lila said looking at him with puppy eyes.
Tony sat in the car. He had cried on his way but as soon as he got in the car Carol and Peter hugged him and sat beside him.
"I am sorry about your shirt I did not mean to-" Steve felt bad looking at the wet spot on Tony's shirt.
"You can sit down cap" Tony had said and moved a bit in on his side. Steve took the hint and went where Tony was sitting. He sat opposite to Tony. If this was the last time Steve would see Tony he wanted to at least look at him and remember him.
"Yeah I know cap. The other guy is aware and he is not happy about this but he would never hurt Nat or any civilian" Bruce replied. Steve just nodded he turned around to look at Tony who was discussing something with Barnes. Scott had left with Hank a week ago and Steve was happy for the guy. Clint and Laura wanted to go back to there house but they knew but they werent allowed to leave. He saw Bucky coming towards him and Tony was speaking to Sam and Nat.
Strange was greeted by everyone and he saw Tony smiling at him. Beside Tony he could see Steve and his heart dropped but he knew he could never come in between them but it did not mean he could not annoy Steve and make him jealous. Strange went towards Tony and sat on the other side.
"Relax Nat I can be a friend. Soon we will be working in the field in a week or 2. I need to talk to him anyway"
"Tony-I-its like I am back and I am making everything worse for you. Your health and when he-when he threw you across. I thought I would lose you forever you know. I felt helpless that I couldnt get to you  and if something would have happened I would I cant forgive myself Tony" Tony had taken his functioning arm and pulled Steve close and Steve just hugged him and he could feel his shirt getting wet.
"What happened guys?" Rhodey asked. He went to stand with Tony. Steve wanted to move and comfort him but he knew how that would end up.
"I love when you start acting up all shy after doing dirty babe" Tony laughed and Steve just buried his face in Tony's neck. Tony could feel Steve's arousal clearly as sitting in his lap it was pressed against his ass and this was not helping Tony's situation at all. He pulled back and stood up and Steve just stared confused.
They arrived at the tower on time and saw Clint, Laura and the kids were missing. Steve wasnt there as well which was weird. Vision had flown himself in the morning hoping to convince Wanda about Stephen. Everyone gathered around and were waiting. Wanda was there but she was giving Carol the stink eye and carol did not back off and returned the hatred.
"You should be resting Tony, how about we go upstairs and I cook you something? everyone will be waking up soon and they will probably go crazy if they dont find you in the hospital" Steve said.
"Guys I will sit with Tony you guys can go and I will keep and eye out on Steve as well. Jim will stay with me" Carol announced.
"They must really hate us, right Stark?" Wanda said in her polite tone but clearly making the point. Before Carol could speak Tony held her hand indicating to leave it alone. But before Carol could argue another voice stopped her.
"Nat we have to let all this anger go and move on, I am not saying go be best friends with him. He needs a friend rn more than ever"
"I know I am just worried Tony. You are right I am sorry. Do you want me to help you to your floor" Steve said getting up.
"I wont Tony I promise you. I know you feel like my words are empty but I promise to show you if you would let me" Steve said taking Tony's face between his hands and kissing him softly. Tony sighed he was getting drunk with Steve's sweet kisses as much as he wanted to fuck Steve he knew they wanted to take things slow and this would only over complicate things.
"I am all packed up and Peter has taken my stuff downstairs he insisted. What happened here?" Tony asked looking at wanda who was now on the sofa thanks to Clint.
"Wanda is going to get better at Kamar Taj she will learn. You know his knuckles whatever you told him he did that to himself because he was upset at himself"
"Chop Chop lets go. Nat, Bruce, Carol and Rhodey in one car. Barnes, Sam and Cap you are with me" Tony said and started walking towards the lift.
The room was ready for Hulk to come out everyone was prepared inside room but they stood a bit far away. Nat kissed Bruce and stood near him giving him enough space.
"Look Cap I do not want your excuses you made yourself quite clear when you picked that lover boy over me. I am done with you and you should stop wasting your time and go look after your precious "Bucky". I do not need you or want you"
"What just happened?" Bruce said looking at Nat and Sam. Nat just smiled " Why are you smiling Nat that looked like they would murder each other are you smiling at the thought that they would murder each other?" Sam just asked confused. "You idiots this was the first time Steve didnt pity himself he stated that he did not care about anyones opinion other than Tony's". Realisation crossed Sam's and Bruce's face.
"I get nightmares too you know about that day" Tony whispered. He could hear Steve's breath and he gently took his hand away from his face and held his hand. Steve's eyes were red.
"Where is Strange?" Wanda asked. Everyone looked around but no one knew and Steve was about to ask Friday when a yellow circle appeared and he walked in with a scared Peter. Tony rushed towards Peter and Peter hugged him. The kid was almost in tears and he held tightly on Tony. Steve came forward and started rubbing circles on his back.  Tony looked at Stephen and Stephen replied "He wasnt answering his phone. His aunt was working the night shift when few people came in and tried to kidnap him, they injected him with something and he couldnt use his spider powers. It kind of paralysed him. Dont worry I gave him the antidote thats why it took so long. I have explained to her to come to the tower after her shift" Stephen explained.
"Cant,  Captain I have work to do right now" Tony replied he knew where this was going to go and Nat held his hand comforting him. If there was a fight he will go in full panic mode.
Everyone gathered in the common room. Tony stood behind the couch while Carol sat on the couch with Rhodey and Peter. Nat and Vision stood beside Tony. While Pepper was keeping all the accords on the table in front of them.
"Tony, of course, I trust you. It is not about jealousy. I just wanted to be the one to help you. Why didn't you ask Friday to call me, there is nothing more important than you. I am sorry for sounding like an asshole. I just I am frustrated Tony. I knew there was something wrong and I knew you did not feel about talking but it's like I have to try to open you up to talk to me and he gets it without even trying. I know you are his friend and that is good that you are speaking about it with someone. I just feel like I am not enough for you. How would you feel if I took my problems and started to share them with someone else instead of you? We are together in this and I want you to be able to tell me whatever it is that is bothering you. We don't have to share everything but at least somethings" Steve said softly.
They were sitting in the kitchen and Steve was cooking breakfast with the help of Rhodey and Sam. Bucky and Scott were arranging the table and Tony was being guarded by Peter and Carol so he wont sneak some coffee. Nat and Carol just sat beside Tony. Clint and his family decided to go out for breakfast. Tony was stuck in between them and no one was getting him coffee.
"Think about it kid, I am not saying go right now but just think" Cooper nodded and sat back with Peter. Peter looked up to him and smiled.
"Dont break his heart again Steve because I will kill you if that is the last thing I do" Carol said. Steve got up from his bed.
He remembered how Tony use to wrap himself around him. He use to call him his personal Teddy bear which use to make Tony roll his eyes and give Steve an annoyed face. Steve smiled. The thought of Tony made him happy. These last 2 years all he did was dream about Tony. The dream either use to be happy or turn into nightmares where Steve was hurting Tony. He could not even speak about this to anyone. Tony use to be his best friend after Bucky and he was glad that Bucky was back but he could not dump his stuff on Buck when he was healing. Sam was there but it wasnt the same. Barton and Wanda both had their personal problems and Scott was just Scott. He knew Tony, Nat and Bruce since the start. Nat and him were close but now everything was gone. She cared but he knew she would pick Tony again and he was glad that Tony had her.
"Sorry Mr Stark" Tony just rolled his eyes playfully. It was Bucky's turn to go. They had to stop on 7 word which was kind hearted. Bucky was getting restless in the chair and he told them to stop.
"Pete you ready to work in the lab" Tony said and Peter was smiling. They both went down talking about the nanotechnology and suits. A few minutes later Barnes went down and saw Tony and Peter busy.
"Well we can send you the video" Nat had argued back. Tony just stood leaning between Steve and Rhodey. Steve had tightened his grip around Tony but making sure it did not hurt him.
"I would like to sleep in your lounge if that is okay with you?" Steve said. Steve knew if someone came up through the stairs or lift the lounge will be the place they will have to pass.
"I dont know if you will agree or not but in worst case scenario I am willing to take the blame. It will keep the video away. I know Tony was stressed about the video and I will plead guilty if that means the video will never come out" Steve said.
"Wasting his time at Kamar Taj? Seriously you were the one wasting your time there instead of improving you made Wong's life hell"
Steve was lying in his bed after ages he felt happy. Tony had agreed to be his friend well that meant Tony will talk to him. He also said his name today. That was improvement and Steve was content at the moment. He did not like how Tony had told him about this guy. He sounded irritated but there was something in his eyes which made Steve scared. That was the look Tony gave him the first time they made at the helicarrier. Steve still remembered Tony looked annoyed ,however, his eyes had a bit of shinning or it was something he imagined. He still remember how after the nuke everything had changed. Steve did not think he could love anyone after Peggy but Tony made him fall for him without even knowing. Tony had opened his home to all the avengers and invited him to stay there after his trip and he did.
"Its... it's all my fault, isn't it?" Tony replied sitting next to Stephen. "About what Tony? what are you talking about?" Stephen asked. "Ross. I brought him in you don't understand this is all my fault. He wouldn't be doing this if it was not for the accords. I did this Stephen!" Tony shouted in the end. "Listen to me Tony and listen good. This is not your fault, this could have happened either way. The government would play the accords and you and I, we both know it would have been much worse. You just wanted to do better and you did. It is not your fault that Ross turned out to be this. You do not get to blame yourself for others, Tony. Never. Ross is doing all this and he would have done this if instead of you the government would have brought him in. He would have done the same thing. Tony Stark you are not the one to be blamed so stop it. You are the most genius person I have met excluding myself" Stephen replied.
"Hey Coop" and Cooper just hugged him and cried. Tony's voice came from the lounge take him to the car I will see you there.
Steve interrupted him "No! dont say that please I cant live in a world knowing you dont exist please dont"
"You know I have dreamt of this so many times just holding you and feeling you Tony. Are you really here Tony in my arms?" Steve asked kissing Tony's forehead. Tony just softly kissed him on the lips.
"I am scared as well Steve but we will be fine" Tony looked at him like promising him and Steve just held Tonys hand and nodded.
"Yeah and you still are. We did not know what Ross had planned and it is not like Tony had any idea that this would happen. We have been sitting for the past 6 hours in a meeting and trying to sort the mess" Nat replied.
"Yeah Cap I am fine. I had to speak to you about something" Tony said turning towards Steve and keeping his tablet on the table.
Steve made sure he kept his distance, he saw every time he tried to go near his Tony he would flinch and step back like he had thrown something at him. Steve always sucked at situation like these. It was hard for him to see what he had done wrong and he knew what had went wrong he was not sure if he understood that. He wanted Tony back that is the only thing that mattered to him. Bucky was safe and fine that is all he wanted and he wanted to explain himself as well.
"I am fine, just a night mare nothing new" Yeah nothing new he thought. It was hilarious how Steve use to keep the nightmares away, how he use to hold him after one and tell him how much he loved him till he fall asleep and now he is the reason of all his nightmares.
"Captain, Mr Stark wants to see you. He is currently in his bedroom and is waiting for you" Steve panicked what of something had happened to Tony. He ran towards the room to see Tony sitting on his bed with his tablet and jumped as soon as Steve ran in
"Well I can give him one of the Stark phones and Friday can help him learn, Sam you look like you will kill yourself soon" Tony smiled
"Yes Ms Romanoff" Vision did not understand emotions that well but he knew that his creator was hurting because someone he loved had betrayed him. He understood that well and he knew he wanted to be alone.
"I said I will go and that is final" Tony said and Carol understood. Tony would always protect her and Carol knew she could protect herself well but Tony was Tony. She did not want to take that away from him.
Soon Tony fell asleep and Steve just stared at him the whole time. It was 6 pm already and Steve knew it was time for Tony's medicine. Steve was about to wake Tony up but suddenly Tony sat up panting. Steve knew what this meant. He gave time to Tony to adjust to his surroundings. Tony looked around and saw Steve.
"Enough, we are here for different purpose. So stop" Steve sighed. This was not going to go anywhere Steve thought.
"Why is he doing this? I mean the council is already up to his ass he is in trouble, why add more trouble?" Clint asked.
"Sammy these are new wings I made they are made from vibranium so it will be easier for you to fly as its light and no one can really shoot it down"
"Get everyone together Tony and Nat are on there way. They have some news to tell us and it did not sound good" Rhodey said. Suddenly everyone was sitting in the common room waiting. Not knowing what had happened. It made Steve anxious. Was Tony okay? thats the only thing that was going through his mind.
"Leave it for now Pepper. I just want one day to go normal you know with no mention of Ross and whatever happened. Can we just enjoy the moment for now" Tony said looking at everyone and everyone just nodded.
"Welcome back guys" He said so they could stop a it further away and they did. Nat give him a look understanding what he was thinking.
"I dont know Laura. A part of me has forgiven him but I cant forget and I need to heal myself first. I am putting myself first. You have 3 beautiful kids and if you want to leave him I will support you but dont make decisions in a hurry like I do. You might regret it" Tony replied.
It was 3 am and Friday alerted him that it was Carol on the line and she couldn't access Mansion systems. Tony was wide awake he knew his friends wont call if it wasn't an emergency. Steve sat up as well.
"Never again. He is all I want and I will never give up on him ever but he needs his space right now and I am willing to wait" Steve said hoping Bucky was right.
laura looked at Tony helpless he knew what was going on and just sighed. He had to speak to Cooper alone and he knew the solution wasnt speaking him infront of everyone that will make him more rigid. He sighed and nodded. Clint didnt replied and looked at Tony and his son in Tony's arm.
"I am pregnant" Pepper finished and everyone just started shouting congratulations towards the couple. Tony jumped up and ran towards Pepper and Happy. "Move you guys I get to hug her first" and moved Carol who was hugging her. He hugged Pepper. He was so happy for her. He was going to be an uncle. He pushed himself back and looked at Pep. "I am going to be an uncle Pep" Tony whispered to her and she just nodded smiling. "You will be a great mother Pep look at all the practice you got and I turned out just fine" Tony smiled and moved towards Happy. "Congratulations Happy" Tony hugged him and thanked him for taking such good care of Pepper.
"Give this little mister to me" He took him from her hands. "You lil mister whenever I tell you to call me by name you never do and what you trying to do kid give me a heart attack" he said while holding him.
"Hey, how long was I out? Are you okay Tony? I didnt hurt you did I? I am sorry I did not m-" Steve started he saw quickly took his hand away from Tony. He missed the warmth but Tony's hand looked a bit weird maybe because he was holding on to it for the whole time he slept. He was interrupted by Tony.
"Yeah" Tony replied. They just stayed like that. Wishing they could remain in each others arms and not go back to reality. Tony stirred and Steve let him go. Tony just sat on the mattress and Steve did the same. They were both hesitant. Thats not how Steve wanted the date to end with Tony being uncomfortable.
"Why dont you guys sit down and we can talk" She stared at Steve and everyone sat except for Steve and Bucky.
"Shut it Barnes me and Pete can be here the whole day and still wont get tired. I swear the kid has more energy than anything. Come sit I will bring you arm and attach it" Tony pointed him at the chair and brought the arm out. They both worked silently and Bucky just sat there starring at Tony. He killed his parents even if he cannot remember it how can this guy be so nice. He is here fixing him a new arm and whatever happened in that bunker. Bucky knew Tony was a good guy and Steve had screwed it up like always. He told him so much about Tony while they were in Wakanda all that guy could say was Tony's name in almost everything.
"Tony dont talk just focus on breathing okay?" Nat had whispered. Tony started counting and was back but his voice was hoarse and he looked bruised up. Steve sat in front of Tony and examined his injuries.
Steve smiled and walked out of the lab. When he reached the common room everyone was gathered there. It felt like he never left and everything was the same. Pepper and Laura were bus talking. Nat, Carol and Bruce were helping Rhodey and Sam in the kitchen cooking. Peter and Cooper were setting the table with help of Lila. Barton and Happy were busy talking as well. Pepper looked at him and smiled. She was glowing Steve thought. "Is he coming up or should I go down and drag him out?" Pepper asked. Steve walked towards them and took a seat beside her "He is getting changed and will be up soon". Pepper just smiled and turned towards Laura continuing the conversation.
"Mr St- I mean Tony I wanted to know when can I see Cassie I mean Clint's family is here and I need to see mine"
"No sorry that was wrong. Look I came here to tell you that it was Clint's choice to go with you okay? you did not force him. It was there decision and not yours you asked and they agreed. So you need to stop blaming yourself and think of future we have a lot to think about. We soon need to start training okay? come inside" Tony said and started walking inside
"Wait-What? hospital? why do you have to go to the hospital? are you okay?" Tony asked panicked. Pepper just smiled.
"Friday bring up the prints for Mark LX, lets get this show on the road and play my playlist while you are at it"
First of all I am so sorry for taking such a long break. I just finished my long dissertation and now I am back. Thank you for being so patient.
"Steve you gave me these when you told me you loved me and I dont want them anymore because I just know this does not belong to me. I cant keep it and its best if this stays with you" Tony pushed the Tags towards him.
"Boss Colonel Rhodes and Carol pulled up they are on their way to the hospital floor" Friday informed them and all the remaining were moving towards the lift. "Friday inform everyone of our location" Steve replied. "Yes Captain" Friday replied and let them to the medical floor. Steve just took Tony's hand into his and just squeezed it. He could see how scared Tony looked, Tony looked at him and squeezed his hand back.
"No stay please. I am sorry I am just all over the place and everyone looks so peaceful inside and everywhere I go I create chaos and I thought it was better if I stay out" Steve said looking at the city
"Take acre of yourself Tony and call me if you need me" Stephen said while making his way back in the circle.
Bruce went in first with Nat and one female and one male officer. The Hulk behaved well and accordingly. The whole team stood on the other side of the door and saw the whole process. Bruce had passed the test and Ross did not look happy. Next it was Barnes turn. Tony moved to get his suit but was cut off by Ross as he informedTony that he was suppose to be a civilian and was not allowed the suit. Tony just nodded but he was panicking from inside he knew it could do very wrong but he felt like he owed this to Bucky as he nearly killed him. Carol was not happy and Rhodey had to calm her down. No one was happy with this decision but they knew the consequences.
"Nothing serious Brucie-Bear, its all sorted" Tony replied. They all had continued watching the movie and went to bed.
"Tony someone attacked us we are on our way to the tower" Carol explained in a hurry and he knew things were bad no matter what situation it was Carol was never nervous.
"Yeah baby its me you were having a nightmare calm down you need to take deep breaths okay. I am going to take your hand and keep it on my chest so you can follow my breathing pattern and count with me okay?" He gently reached for his hand and suddenly all he could remember was Steve slamming his shield into his arc reactor.
"I mean what are you doing here I thought you were busy. Are you leaving? I mean I know you have to go was there something you need to tell me about-" Steve was interrupted.
"You are lying Tony, I know you love me and if you dont look in my eyes and say it. I know when you are lying. Am I not worth a second chance. Please. All I want is you Tony only you" Steve was sobbing and he had gotten up and sat on the floor next to Tony. The thought of him killing Tony made him sick all he wanted to do was take Tony in his arms and feel his soft lips and just hold him fro the rest of their lives but he knew he couldnt.
"Nothing serious Tony I have been really stressed for the pass week and I just do not feel good" Pepper replied. Tony knew due to the Accords how it has been. They all stayed up late night to fix this mess.
Tony, Carol and Rhodey sat together like Old times. They spoke about MIT and all the stupid things they have done together. Carols accident and Rhodey losing his hsit after that.
"You did it" Tony smiled and was going towards bucky when the tape started playing on repeat. Everyone looked panicked. Bucky was not prepared for this.
"What is going on between you 2? You guys are making weird eye contact my kids are looking up to you. Why is she going to your floor Stark? Why is my kid in your arms. Have you brain washed her. My kids arent talking to me its your fault. What have you done" Clint shouted.
He was currently polishing the shield when he heard the door open and music stop. He rolled his eyes because there was only one person who would check up on him thrice a day if he did not come out of his lab. He turned around and smiled. "What can I do you for you babe?. Steve smiled and walked towards him. "Well I would really like if you would get your beautiful ass out of that chair, get fresh and have dinner with the team".
"Hey I-I will take the stairs yeah stairs. Good night" Steve said and was about to walk when Tony stopped him.
"So this is your room. Get comfortable or whatever you want and I will see you" Tony said and started walking towards the door.
"Yeah, is everything alright? Is Wanda awake now?" Steve was not sure how Wanda will react maybe he babied her a lot but Carol was someone who he knew meant every word she said and Wanda was wrong using her powers.
"I will take these to office Tony and meet you in the evening, Happy is waiting for me downstairs. Bye everyone" Pepper kissed his cheek and left with the Accords.
Natasha did not say anything else she knew he wont tell her what it was about but she had an idea what it could be related to. There were moments like these where she wanted to go and punch Steve but she knew it was something she cant do because Tony would never want Steve hurt no matter what.
"No Tony I wanted to be there because I did not want the soldier to hurt you" Steve replied. Tony just nodded. This changed everything Tony thought Steve did not trust him with Bucky that is why he was arguing but he wanted to protect him. The thought provided Tony with warmth.
The morning came and everyone was waiting for Bucky to arrive. Everyone said there goodbyes. Peter had told Bucky that he will miss him as no one will be asking questions about different things in movies. Sam had hugged Bucky as well. including everyone else. When it came to Tony, Bucky stood in front of him. Tony hugged him.
"Last time I let you in that did not end well for me did it?" Steve flinched and Tony felt bad that is why he did not want to speak to Steve.
"I just came to- I mean you were standing here and I am not leaving right now. I just want to know what were you looking at" Tony replied. Tony thought what the hell was he on about he could have just said 'hey just came to check on you' but no he was making a fool out of himself as if he has never spoken to this guy before.
"Tony I might have said a lot of things to you in anger but you have protected my family so well and Laura told me all about it. I was so wrong to say all those things I am really sorry and Thank you for everything. I am forever in your debt" Clint said.
"The override code declined" Carol sighed and went up. She just shook her head and sat back. Rhodey took her hand in his and offered her a sad smiled. They both knew this was going to happen. Stephen had gotten up and went in his room and entered Tony's Lab he did not need a door.
“Hey Bambi, I had a feeling you’ll be up, I was going to make your grandma’s famous English breakfast” Tony said to his son with a smile.
“Look Rogers I’m only going to say this once ok, you want to know the truth fine, Stark was brought to the team because he is different then most people a special kind like you or Banner, hell even Thor. But the reason was I owe him he’s been through a lot in his life and before you even open your god damn mouth to protest I’ll stop you right there” at which point steve shut his mouth. “Good, as I was saying I owe Stark and his family more than you know, but I also believe that stark can be of great us in this team for not only for this mind but his skills as well. I shouldn’t be the only one that see this you and the rest of the team need to see it as well and if you do you might actually see him in a different light” Fury finishes.
The Avengers arrived a little late due traffic but luckily it wasn’t too bad.Tony was nervous this is really the Avengers first time together at an event that Tony usually goes alone. The others were also nervous as this event is meant help with their reputation with being superheroes and all.
So that’s what Tony does, he’ll make sure he find his inner soul, make sure to be stronger. He needs to protect his family he has to, and this be the thing to do it.
Tony didn’t know what to do or what to say he turned to his son who looked guilty and mouthed sorry to him. Tony didn’t want to see his Bambi scared so he placed a comforting hand on his boys arms and gently squeezed as a sign of comfort.
The gala was meant to be a nice, peaceful gathering. But instead Tony got a surprise unwanted visitor.
You see today is the 29th May, his birthday. He doesn’t like his birthday anyway since he was 13, but today the team had a mission. Fury explained, that there were hydra agents in a ‘super secret base’ blah blah blah. And their mission was to rescue captured civilians that were apparently been experimented on.
“I believe sir, that there are some in the common room kitchen” his AI replied. Shit that’s where the others usually go to eat together, damn it now he has to go and get it hopefully he can swoop in and they won’t bother him especially Steve.
“Dad?” His son softly said “are you ok?” He asks. It brought Tony out of his thoughts and he turned to his son, “no Bambi I’m not, I am so sorry you had to witness that I didn’t want you to see me in that state” Tony looks down like he was ashamed of himself.
And then there was Steve, It was so strange to him that Tony had these abilities and not only that being worthy to Thor’s hammer, to Asgard and now they have to train to unlock even more power, how strong is Tony really Steve wonders.
But something was wrong, tony felt everyone auras and they were all distorted, manipulated into something dark and tony didn’t like it. But why did it only effect them and not him he wondered, then there was an explosion so he had to figure that out later.
Steve chokes on his own spit when Clint spoke. “W-What are you talking about Clint I’m not jealous, jealous of what?” He stuttered.
Steve didn’t how to feel about this, the one woman who he thought he would spend the rest of his life with 70 years ago, is the mother of the man he’s been sleeping with. God this is such a mess but you can’t deny that he does have a thing for small sassy brunettes.
“Are you ready Anthony?” Thor suddenly spoke, Tony and Steve turn towards Thor and Steve saw Tony’s face change into a more serious expression, he nodded and proceed to sit down in a meditation position.
Tony chuckled at the nickname that Thor recently gave him, and if he honest with himself he likes the nickname better than any other nickname that he was given in the past. But anyways, he better get ready.
But then he whined at the loss of the fingers, Rogers laugh “god your like a bitch in heat, the press were right you’re are a man whore,
“I have no excuse at my behaviour towards Tony, I know that now. When I woke up that day, everything changed I hated it at first, you have moved on and grown old without me, Thought Bucky died  but now he’s Hydras ex assassin who had been tortured for decades and I wasn’t there to protect him. The howling commandos are all gone. My whole past and future was taken away from me and I was angry, but then Fury gave me an opportunity to try and move on, I manage to, I made friends within and outside this team. But Tony he was different, at the time he had everything that I didn’t, you, Howard, a good start in life and the way he acted was nothing I thought I was hoping for when I first met him, I thought he would be like..” “Howard” Peggy finished his sentence with a gentle tone now.
The Avengers have made their plan of action, but Steve needs to figure out what he needs to do and there might be a little talk with a certain someone.
“Men un-cuff him” Daniel ordered, the henchmen rush to both sides of the bed and Daniel approach slowly towards Tony and this scared him a little bit. With a sickly smile Daniel spoke “it’s now time for to face centre stage my dear, I hope you’re ready” Daniel grins even wider and with that the henchmen grab Tony’s arms and drag out of the room with there boss being them. Tony didn’t want to go with to the unknown, he wanted to scream, to fight back but he couldn’t act recklessly now. He needed an opening and hope to god that the others will get here soon, they got closer to a door, Daniel opened it and turned to Tony “this is gonna be fun, we’ll for me anyways” he mocks with that smiles again at Tony, which made him shiver in disgust. He opens the and that’s when Tony notice that they are now in a lab, in the centre of the room there’s a chair, that could look like it can be move into a medical bed. There was equipment everywhere scaples, needles, saws everything that would see from a horror movie, it looked terrifying to Tony, he needed to get out of hear and fast.
After an hours drive Tony finally made it to the house, his looked old but homely in a way and it reminded Tony of his moms old house that he use to stay at and where his son was raised.
Fury took them in the debriefing room, silent filled the air and you can cut tension with a knife. Steve knew what he did was wrong and he went too far, but he also wants to argue that he wasn’t the only one to blame.
Steve was slightly panicking he didn’t know why he said that, but at the same time he just wanted to stay and protect Tony here. “I could but I think I should stay here who knows maybe Daniel will come here attack us” he said trying to find the reason in staying “but I also want to see” he said with a whisper knowing that Tony will know what he meant by seeing. Tony sigh, he knows that this  isn’t a good idea and should keep his distance from Steve for a while but something inside of him was screaming to let him come with him, god what is wrong with him he shouldn’t do this but “ok” he whispers “but you got to promise you’re not going to interrupt my training or being bossy too” he said, his mom is going to kill him.
“What are you talking about? You, my mom, your death, helping me what are you even saying?” Tony questions at his father. Howard gave him a small smile “I know that you were aware that Peggy was your mom, she told me when you were at MIT. You two had bonded, and even though I wasn’t thrilled because I was worried that you would push Maria away. But I’m glad you knew the truth in the end and I’m glad you now have someone to rely on” Howard’s stops for a moment, and Tony at that point was ready to scold him but Howard continues to talk “ I know that was a pathetic excuse, but I was afraid to tell you myself. I know I wasn’t a good father to you...” “Yeah, you got that right” Tony interrupted.
“When I wrote that report I thought he’ll be only a consultant at best, he is nothing like a team player and when we go one our mission he ignored our Captains orders. When we’re at the tower, he doesn’t interact with us he ignore us entirely  except for Thor and sometimes Bruce. He’s arrogant, rude, disrespectful and not to mention a pervert when he flirts with everyone. No disrespect Sir but I think you made a mistake with start and I recommend that’s he’s off the team immediately” she finish her long winded rant.
Nat relax and let go dropping the knife, “I thought your kind were dead” she said, which shouldn’t really surprise Tony that she knows about them. “I take it where you were trained they taught you about us?” He ask and Natasha nodded “you were the enemy to us apparently, they said your creed was dangerous but they also said you died out years ago and we didn’t have to worry about you” she said calmly. Took this information and said “well technically they are right, there isn’t many of us anymore and some people have lost their abilities along the way, do you think I’m your enemy?” He ask he knows that she doesn’t like him and she probably say yes to his question, so it won’t be a surprise when she says “No” wait? What did she just say “I said no Tony (whoops he spoke out loud again) I’m not them anymore so I won’t class as my enemy I believe I have may misunderstood you badly and for that I apologise and I do my best to make up for my mistakes” she said sincerely. Wow that took a different turn then Tony was excepting “um thanks” he said dumbly and Natasha just smiled and sat back down.
He look at her softly, “then why are you here Peggy?” He ask, Peggy smiled and said simply, “I thought you could use the break and I got some baby photos of Anthony you’ll like to see” she explain.
Now Thor was really piss, he pressed Steve hard against the wall, which felt pain all over his back. Is Steve really that stubborn that he can’t see through is anger to see that Anthony is worth of respect. “ are you serious captain, you want examples gladly. You call him disobedient, but do you know why he does that” Thor waited for Steve to answer, but Steve just shook his head. Thor scoff at that “ it’s because he found a better solution then what you came up with, I class you two as both leaders of this group. But yet we only follow what you said, however if you even bother to speak with Anthony then maybe we’ll form better as a team. Tell me captain if Anthony is disobedient, then how many casualties has he cause because of his actions?” Thor challenge. Steve tried to think and but he got nothing, Starks disobedience has never caused a casualty maybe Thor was right.
Fury sigh god he hopes others should be here soon so these idiots can get their heads out of there ass. Speaking of the others, Agent Barton and Doctor Banner have just arrived.
Tony has been staring at the ceiling for what seemed like hours, late night was good the combination of pain and pleasure was what tony needed then, but now all he could feel was pain from every part of his body.
Pps I also wish everyone good health it’s been a bad few months and I wish everyone well and hope you all are healthy and safe x
Tony looked at the others, “you ready my merry men and woman” he joke but the others except for Thor didn’t laugh, wow tough crowed.
Tony sighed happily as he strokes his sons hair and bend down to kiss him on the forehead. He then leaves his sons room quietly.
And what he was saying about stark was true he did all these things for the team, for everyone, Steve felt like his chest was tightening and stomach was twisting in all sorts of directions. Could this be guilt Steve wonders.
“What the hell were you thinking I gave you a direct order, and yet again you went rouge” Rogers accuse
“Ur thanks cap, you didn’t scare me I don’t get scared easily, but thanks for the concern and as you can see I am peachy” he spoke trying to sound confident but he wasn’t sure if he pulled it off.
Fury was relived he didn’t want anything to happen to Tony’s kid. “Good, I’ll make sure that your mom and Davis will be at the tower by morning you have my word, I see you soon ok and take care of yourself” then he hung up.
Pepper froze in shock from Tony’s outburst, Tony felt a little guilty to shout at Pepper like that so he quickly explain why he’s leaving “It’s Tobias, I need to go” he said with worry. Peppers eyes widen and nodded as knew that Tobias is the most important person in Tony’s life and he always comes first.
He later had surgery with a little of with extremis, to help to remove all the shrapnel in his chest. But he ask if they kept the reactor attach to his chest, despite what it was meant for it was apart of him and tony wanted to keep it like that. But with a few minor changes so the reactor did not effect any of Tony’s internal organs and it can be removable as it’s not attach internally.
Daniel click his tongue in annoyance, he knows the deal and he will not fail, he is determined to get what he wants, he will never fail not this time.
“The neckless you’re wearing a part of my conscious is in there, it’s a strange artifact that Peggy has her family for years I guess her kind use it to help guide others or something” this surprise Tony he never knew that his father knew about his moms abilities.
Tony looked away for a moment but then turned toward John, “Well it’s a long story” he simply said. But John just smiled “ I got time for you kid” Tony smiled and told him everything. Well not everything, he didn’t speak about Rogers about his ‘relationship’ with him, but he told him about New York battle, the mandarin, the team and how they treat him, Thor and his training. It felt like he was talking for hours and John just listen.
Then warm feeling disappeared and Tony was back in the work shop, Thor was looking at him with a kind smile on his face. “So I was right your worthy and the mjolnir recognise you as one of asgardian children” he spoke in a softy voice tony never heard him speak in that tone before.
He pick up the picture that was next to the plane, he has keep this photo for all these years, the picture of two little boys been happy in the moment. But that doesn’t last for ever does it. He puts the photo away and looked at the plan his desk, “soon Tony” he whispered “soon you will be mine again, and this time it will be forever”
Tony wanted to laugh, but right now he needed to do this, he looked at Davis and his boy “it’s the only way, but don’t worry I’m sure Fury will keep them inline” he tried to joke. Tobias and Davis seem to agree “ if you think thats best then I support you dad no matter what” his son spoke god he was so proud of his boy.
Tony pulls away from his son “right so I’ll be gone for half hour or so I’ll be back soon” he said to everyone and walks to his smaller lab. Before he disappears Steve stops him “wait what are you going to do?” He asks, Tony turns to him “just a little project that might be useful in this situation” he simply replies and walks off. Everyone just stands there not knowing what to do, until Peggy spoke “why don’t we speak to Fury and Davis they might know something by now” she said to everyone Steve’s agrees, “Jarvis put Fury on the line” He ask the AI.
A week went by after the birthday incident. Tony felt tension in every corner in the tower mainly by spangles, who even though fucked him into next week is still not happy with the stunt he pulled. So tony can’t even be bothered with him at this point. and the lovely spy twins are still being petty dicks, they make snide comments and what does steve do nothing so yeah Tony’s piss like they are pissed at him so the feeling is mutual.
Natasha heavily sighs “Clint that’s enough” she barks at him, but Clint didn’t seem to take the hint “No way Tash you got to admit this is crazy. Like who the fuck are you kid, is the Cap right that you’re some sort of toy boy for this Asshole? He insults and at that Tobias finally snaps.
Jarvis notice something was off in his system, ‘oh no’ he thought a virus how did it get into his system, he scans to try and destroy the virus but he can’t it keeps coming back so he did one last thing before it paralysis him.
This made some sense for Tony it explains why his mom was being paranoid and overprotective during that year especially with Stane. “Okay so why are you in that neckless?” Tony pointed to his chest.
It was Peggy, Davis, Tobias and Tony that was left in the room. The others had left with Fury god knows what he’s going to say to them after what has been revealed.
Tobias wanted to help people the best way he could and as long he can remember he wanted to be a lawyer.
They had hot chocolate and chatted for a bit about the projects that SI are planning, then a while after pepper had to go and gave tony a kiss on the cheek and she left, leaving tony to in his own thoughts which isn’t good by any means.
“Who did it Sir and why?” Natasha asked. Fury gave them a look and said “ that’s quite complicated, as I’m not sure now that I can trust you with this information” he said bluntly.
“I don’t know Clint, I watch Tony for months and not once I didn’t get the hint that he was in so much pain, we screwed up badly. But I swear to you that we will fix this, fix us, we will not make this mistake ag....” Natasha stop in mid sentence when she turned around towards the car and notice something odd.
Fury chuckle “of course you do” he said kindly and motion her to sit next to him, “let’s see these then” he said to her and Peggy chuckle and walk towards the empty chair.
“Did you find anything whilst we were gone?” Clint ask, but Thor shook his head “unfortunately not, everything was burned, though when Agent Hill and son of coul arrived they informed me that the agent only started 3 weeks ago and was recommended by a former agent” he informs them.
Steve looked at the others behind Tony, Peggy looked furious and to be honest she has a right to be after that whole display. The older man looked angry as well, Steve doesn’t know who he is but he is sure he’s going to find out soon. And lastly he looked at the kid, him as well looked angry but Steve could tell he was sad as well, he that be because he is sad for Tony, his dad?.
Thor then smirk, “ oh really, well then it will be easier for me to train you then” he said with glee.
Steve nodded and said “I’ll try sir, I didn’t realise you care for Stark this much thought you dislike the guy” he tried to tease. But Fury didn’t see the funny side of it, “listen Rogers, I might not show but I definitely care for him more than you know, and mark my words Captain if I find out that you force him in anyway I’ll make sure you go back into that block of ice and never resurfaced for another 70 fucking years you got that” he threatened.
“Clint” she rasp “what happened?” She questions. Clint took a big sigh “thank god your alive Nat I was worried there for a second. The ambulance is on its way, one of our agents was a double agent, Hydra” he confirmed.
Steve was getting suspicious with stark and Thor, for serval days now thor keeps going down to Starks lab and not coming back up for hours. It wasn’t him who notice it, Clint and Natasha have thought the same thing as well.
And at that point Steve didn’t really know he didn’t mean to blurt it out he was so frustrated with what’s been going on recently and he just wanted answers. Fury sighed at this mess in front of him, he hoped that Tony would have break down his walls and shown his true self, but he guess these three idiots didn’t give him a reason to do that, so he better go to plan B then.
“Tony” Steve said worryingly as he notice and plane heading at there direction how did they not notice that invisible shield maybe, Tony’s eyes widen as he notice something “GET DOWN” he shouts and a small missile hits the tower causing a small explosion.
There was a long pause for a moment until Howard spoke “Right I should really explain why I’m here shouldn’t I” Tony raised his eyebrow “that would be ideal” Howard chuckles at his son’s sass, yet another first he never really heard his father laugh which look genuine then the laughs he used at a gala or the press.
Tony stood there in shock on what his son just said, with hesitation he turned his head to face the others. He first looked at his mom and Davis they had the same facial expression as he did, then he looked at Fury who usually doesn’t give anything away but he can tell from his aura alone he was sad about the situation.
Not a moment later Tony and Steve come out of the elevator, Tobias notices something very different about his dad “Your auras different what happen?” He asks his dad. Tony smiles “well Bambi it worked” he simply said. Tobias smiles and Peggy moves towards her son “what happen?” She asks, and Tony just hugs her tightly “it’s a long story mom” he simply says to her.
“Oh for fuck sake, I knew I wasn’t prep enough. Don’t worry yourself J I’ll be fine just need to clean up that’s all” tony replies
Bruce in the end guides Steve to the conference room where the meeting was held. As Steve opens the door, he sees Fury standing by the screen projecting blue prints, whilst the other Avengers and including Peggy, Tobias and Davis sitting around the table.
However Thor on the other hand has been kind to tony, he always comes down to the work shop to ask if he is alright and starts bringing up tales about his home land which Tony finds fascinating. Tony’s likes to him his warrior bro, Thor’s seems to chuckle at that so he sticks with it, thor has been Tony’s only real friend within the avengers, sure Bruce will always be his science bro, but at times, Tony can sense how Bruce, on occasion gets annoyed or frustrated at him, so to prevent the big guy from coming out to play he doesn’t aggravate him like he would with the SHEILD trio.
Before tony could even finish his sentence Rogers grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and slammed him against the wall. Tony was shock at this he never suspected Rogers to do that maybe he we went too far mentioning his mom.
“Captain” Tobias addresses Steve, he turns to the young boy “I want you to know that I’m extremely pissed at what you said about my dad that was just cruel and uncalled for” he states and Steve wanted to speak about it but with the look on Tobias face it wasn’t the right time, so he just nodded. “When I get my dad back I want you to stay away from him for awhile. What you two have got going on is toxic and you both need to address your issues, then maybe just maybe you two could be friends at least” he spoke firmly.
Lily turned away for a moment as if she had been slapped across the face, “I was in prison for a while and it was hell but I got serval years ago and was force to live in an isolated area, but then my husband a army lieutenant had family were I loved and well the rest was history really” she simple answers.
Fury raised his eyebrow and to Steve he either looked pissed or amused or maybe both. “Really, and why should I tell you?” He countered.
Sure stark can be funny at times but Clint is sure that he just laughing at them and not laughing with them.
Tony close the fridge door, but kept his head down, he felt a little bit ashamed of himself. He knew that Tobias would ask that question but he just wanted things to feel a little bit normal for once. He sighed and look at his son, “Yeah ok Bambi, come take sit down” Tony said whilst he gestured towards the couch.
“Jesus fuck Stark, do you know what it is, I swear if this is another prank call I’ll will go to your tower and.....” “Nick please I need your help” Tony interrupted him with a plea.
So tell me Stark what was Mrs Marks and you arguing about and where did you go after gala?” she questions him.
Daniel let’s go and pats lightly on Tony’s cheek, “good boy now that is enough question I won’t answer the other it’s getting boring now so I’ll be leaving to prepare for you experiment. And don’t worry darling it won’t hurt much I promise I’ll come and collect you in an hour” he spoke softly so kiss Tony on the cheek. Then he gets up and leaves toward the door.
Thor just nodded and decided to join the other in conversation, whilst they were doing that Tony looked out the window and wondered what today’s event going to be like, he hope it goes well, it has to for his and there sake.
“That’s a good plan, JARVIS can you inform Bruce about this please” Steve agrees, “of course Captain”. Steve then helps Tony to his feet as Tony still felt weaken by he could feel his strength getting back to him. As they both reach the elevator and head up to the penthouse, Tony couldn’t shake the feeling that something wasn’t right about this but he can only hope that they can prevent anything bad form happening before it was too late.
Tony open the door and saw his beautiful mom on her bed reading one of her favourite books, “hi mom, surprise” he said gently.
What the fuck, do they think he killed them, they can’t think that right?. “You can’t honestly think I killed them, look I may be a lot of things, but a murderer isn’t one of them” He protest, this is getting bad quick and his son must be wondering where he is, god help him.
Tony didn’t know what to say to that, his soul, tranquility what was thor on about. But Tony’s wants to learn so he sat down on the grass floor as well.
Steve could only shake his head, “no it’s not about stark, Well it is but I was talking to thor and he has given him some new thoughts about stark” he explain vaguely. Both the spy twins were confused on what Steve was talking about.
“Don’t you DARE, how dare you all insulting my DAD like this. You all know nothing about him so how can you judge HIM!” he shouts not realising what he has revealed.
“I doubt he feels that way now after all I’ve done to him” Steve whispers not realising that spoke. Tobias gives him a weak smile “I wish he did, but my dad will still always love you it’s actually annoying sometimes” he simply said with a small smile across his face. Steve looks at him with surprise “But why would he!” He shouts “I’ve been nothing but a bully to him I’ve judge him so wrong I’ve used him all the wrong ways, how could he ever love me after I have done” Steve argues. Tobias looks at him with sadness “I honestly don’t know, you need to talk to him about it once we get him back home” he simply said, there was an awkward pause between the two of them for minute, Steve wanted to talk ask Tobias question about his life and Tony being a father he wanted to get to know them better and to clear the air there’s so much to say but as of right now their main priority is to find Tony.
Tony was surprise that she wanted to give him something he usually didn’t want his mom to that, “mom you don’t have get me a present” Tony replies back.
Once they were inside, it was busy you could say. Important people everywhere, military men and women from captain to major, there wives and husbands who are lawyers, judges or businessmen. And let’s not forget the singles who are most likely top businessmen and the press who manage to get an invite inside of the gala. Tony was prepare on how to mingle with these people, he just hope the others will be ok.
“That’s good J keep going at it the sooner the better” Tobias relaxes a little bit, finally some good news he thought to himself. Steve thought the same as well he has his chance to make up for his mistake he won’t let Tony down this time.
It was getting frustrating that no one wanted to tell him about it, he felt excluded and that no one cared what his thoughts were, so he started to act out. Like skipping school, giving attitude to teachers that didn’t deserve it and getting into fights with some bullies. It got to the point where he used a fighting technique that was forbidden to use in the public eye and he had almost seriously hurt an other student.
Both of them looked up at him, Clint was the one who spoke first, “Yeah we have, are you jealous that our spoiled resident genius decided to go for more muscles” he teased.
“Clint told me there has been a fight, Tony what did you do to cause this” he accuses, everyone looked at Clint with a glare. But he responds “hey look guys all I said is that there was a fight between Stark and Cap that’s all” he defends.
Tony gave her a sad look, he knows that everything doesn’t revolve around him, but today was just bad old past memories kept creeping up in his mind and he can’t focus like pepper wanted him to be. “ I’m sorry pepper I am trying to do better I swear it’s just the mission today was just hard” he spoke softly. Pepper was surprise and felt a bit guilty about what she said, “ oh tony look it’s ok it’s next time just think ok. We can rearrange dinner another time, and while I’m here I remind you that the charity gala is coming soon in a couple of weeks so be prepared for me please” pepper said.
Steve’s eyes widen, what? How? So many questions, he look at Peggy to look for answers. “Me and Howard had... a moment it wasn’t the best idea it almost cost him his marriage but in hindsight it gave me the best gift that I could ever asked for” she said with soft smile at her son and Tony sighed softly smiled back.
Tony quiet down his laughed, his son was safe but the danger is still out there, it’s been so long since he last saw that man and he hope he would have never seen him but he guess you can’t get everything that you wanted. He would make sure his son is safe and his mom too, he doesn’t care what the other avengers would think of him because right now his family is all that matters.
“You got some things to say about Stark, well what has he done now?” Fury asked trying to sound neutral to the trio.
Tony sighed god how did he even get into this mess, oh yeah he knows, he knows damn well how that happen. It all started about ago two months after that stupid battle in New Jersey of all places.
Tobias wanted to protest but he knew nothing will come of that, so sighed and nodded in agreement. “Ok dad, but please can you get the other avengers to help you I know you don’t get along with them but they could help you” his son pleas.
“To be honest I really don’t know” he simply said he can see Peggy was in thought for a moment then “you do realise that’s a stupid answer” she said bluntly. Steve gave a wet chuckle at that comment, he sighed and looked down to the floor “I am really sorry Peggy, I want to fix this but I don’t know how” he admits.
“Ok... so who’s the old guy and the kid?” Clint asked, right the part of his life god, he didn’t want to talk about this but he has to.
Tony had to defuse the situation before it could get heated, “relax point break, Cap here just wants to see the training” he said calmly. Thor gave him a confused look “Are you sure that is wise?” He asked dubiously whilst looking at Steve with a glare. Tony could see that Steve was nervous under Thors glare, he wants to laugh at how uncomfortable Steve looks it’s a nice surprise he’s not always the dominant one. But anyways, there would be time for laughs later, but now Tony needs to be prepared for.... him.
