“Odd guy,” said Bruce from behind Tony. “Shall we?”
“Well, it’s good to know we don’t look like the criminals we are.”
“It’s Cadet Rogers,” Steve corrected him, then moaned as Tony ground into him, nipping at his shoulder.
Mr. Coulson sighed. “Yeah, me too.” The late afternoon sunlight, filtered through pine trees, stretched across the classroom.
“Sounds nice,” Steve said, resuming a slow, soothing stroke pattern up Tony’s cock, leaning forward and pressing a open-mouthed kiss to the head before leaning back and pillowing his head on his fist, looking up at Tony.
drunk that he couldn’t hear a door opening. “Is that so,” he said, setting his drink down with a faint clink.
you?”
Sam shrugged. “Up until Rogers showed up, I was the fastest dude on Ultimate.”
don’t see the point!” said Scott. “Would someone please explain what the fuck just happened?”
“And now Thor’s dad,” Tony continued smoothly, ignoring Scott. “What the fuck, I thought comas were some once-in-ten-thousand shit.”
“Oh, come on, Sitwell, where’s your sense of adventure?” Tony said, grasping him by both shoulders as he slid down from the table, setting his weight experimentally on the angle Sitwell’d bandaged and braced for him. “Jail is terrific for good-looking guys like you. I’ll mail you some soap.”
That didn’t sound like any kind of culture shock that Steve had ever heard of, but he did know something about waking up not knowing where he was, so he kept his mouth shut.
“So you… jogged here?”
it, darting right into the center of the fight, deftly avoiding the boy’s wild swings as he prized the two combatants apart. Steve rose to intervene, but his teacher held up one hand—“Don’t! Stay back!”
on the abuse of police force, are we clear on that?”
“Da,” said Natasha, already stretching and wiggling her fingers in preparation. Thor knelt on the loading dock.
“I can jimmy whatever locks you need jimmied,” said Scott.
“I’d be at lunch,” said Clint. “I like lunch. You’re shit at cheering people up, you know that?”
“Just myself. Once,” said Steve. “It, uh, hurt.”
“Yep. It’s perfect. Meets twice a week, no uniforms, no helmets, you won’t even mess up your hair.” Steve clapped Tony on the shoulder. “Trust me, it’s fun.”
“I believe my father thought it beneath the dignity of the family,” said Thor. “Then, of course, he went into a coma.”
“What is that, a card reader?”
Tony crossed the floor in two swift steps and hit Barnes—hard—in the face, following him to the floor and snatching up a handful of shirt to yank him around for another hit.
a hard challenge,” said Scott. “My cousin CiCi, season 3? She said it was a relief to get sent home before she ever had to do it.”
Steve looked down at his pie, working to get his face under control. After a few minutes, Carol reached across the table and covered his hand with hers. He didn’t stop her.
“If we don’t get shot. Hey, has anyone thought about the logistics of breaking into what is essentially military property?”
“What with?” asked May.
Lang rolled his eyes and slid back under the van.
Steve caught the thing and flipped it over a couple of times. It looked like a steroidal D battery—one end sawn open and covered with a cap of tinfoil and laced copper wire. “It looks different than the one I saw the other day.”
"I noticed it, I wondered where that hair had gone, I love all my hair," Tony retorted, getting up and pouring himself a drink. "I'm having a drink. Want one?"
“Do you mean ‘Into the Wild’? Chris McCandless?” Bruce asked.
“Friend Tony has encountered a door,” said Thor.
, you have a smart mouth,” Tony informed her, before grabbing onto the rusty ladder and starting to climb to the roof, the rest of the crew following him like a chain of ants.
?” asked Bruce.
Clint reached across Natasha’s shoulder to poke, gently, at Steve’s skull, tilting his head over for inspection. Steve let it slide. He was getting used to Clint’s total lack of boundaries. Either that or it was like a Stockholm Syndrome thing.
“In Norway,” Thor said thoughtfully, “Many people change their nature at a point in life. My brother was briefly my sister once, and my father was very displeased.”
Yawns and general assent greeted the idea, and sleeping space was quickly ironed out and flashlights extinguished—which Tony was glad for, because everyone needed sleep. He wouldn’t, of course—he rarely did. He lay awake, listening to the thud of his heart in his own ears, until dawn.
“Culture shock,” said Clint. “Uh, the bad kind. The kind that wakes you up screaming and fighting and not knowing where you are.”
“No problem,” said the driver. “You sure you know where you are?”
“What if he hurts a kid really badly before then?”
Steve looked at the group, at the expressions of horror and worry and concern. Most of the group were subtly shifting so their backs were arrayed around Tony, a phalanx of protection; Thor’s expression was darkening rapidly; even Clint was crossing his arms at Steve. Natasha was unreadable as always; only Sam was looking at Steve with something approaching compassion. Steve made a flash decision, the kind he was starting to suspect would be his life’s specialty. “Can you stand?” he asked Buck, whose right eye was swelling shut.
“Walked right back out, too. Never got in trouble for it, either. I think everyone was just so shocked he’d done it that they kind of let him get away with it.”
Tony babbled out something, he wasn't even sure what, and fled.
She did not respond, but went instead to the stereo, where she snapped off the music.
“It won’t be open,” said Sam.
“’Sup, Rogers?”
“Yeah,” said Carol. “It does. Tell you what,” she said. “I’m not even going to ask if you’re on Facebook. Instead, you’re going to give me one address where I can send you a picture postcard. You still believe in the mail? Good old-fashioned US Postal Service?”
“Ant Man.”
Tony moved fast, undoing him, mouth moving a million miles a minute because of course it was. Steve didn’t hear a word of it. He yanked his wrists free of the ropes and he was gone.
“What’sa matter, trouble in paradise already?” Sitwell said from his crouch in front of Barton’s busted face.
“This is going to need a nurse to get all the glass out,” said the History teacher, and before Steve could open his mouth to volunteer, said, “Mr. Rogers. Do you think you could walk Mr. Banner here down to the infirmary?” The
A half-sheepish chorus of hellos greeted him from all, except from Tony, who stood motionless in the center of the group, the folded scratch-off ticket slipping out of his fingers and fluttering, unnoticed, to the floor.
“You have any idea how bad I wanted you, from the first minute you walked into the room?” Tony breathed into Steve’s mouth, then pulled away and yanked Steve’s t-shirt over his head.
Tony was the first to speak. “Sooo,
“Be that as it may, we’re leaving,” said Steve.
“Coward,” Tony muttered out the corner of his mustache at Scott, and then there were handshakes and kisses and introductions all round.
“Listen, I’m
“Three,” said Thor, who was indeed shivering pretty hard. “Did anyone bring some spare pants?”
Tony, hair standing up on one side, was stepping out of the van with a toohbrush sticking out of his mouth. “Has anyone seen my copy of—oh fuck.”
“Please fuck me.”
“Oh God,” muttered Bruce softly.
“Really,” Tony said. “We are going skinny dipping in the decorative entrance fountain.”
“Cassie’s mom has her this weekend,” Scott said. “Also, she’s nine.”
“Bucky as in, James Buchanan? You that Bucky Barnes?”
“Funny things are.”
“Well, we do have a van,” Tony said. “Could ram the gates.”
In the infirmary, Clint Barton sat on an exam table swinging his heels.
“I still, to this day, have no idea how he did it. I was just tending goal, minding my own, and up rushes this little pipsqueak, so short he ain’t even hit my collarbone, and just…. flat-out lays me out. You know what they start calling him after that?”
“Hello, Natasha, I’m Mr. Coulson, I’ll be your History teacher,” said Coulson, extending his hand, and Natasha shrunk away, looking to Barton for help.
“I was asking if you could contribute your vote to the current polls,” said Mr. Coulson, and Steve went to the blackboard to add a hashmark under “Development of the Printing Press” in the poll for the Best Of The Middle Ages, and one under “The Spanish Inquisition” for the Worst, where the bubonic plague was the clear leader. At the end of class,  Mr. Coulson held Steve back with a subtle glance and gesture—as the last of the students shuffled out, Mr. Coulson sat on the edge of his desk. “Cadet Rogers, I hope you won’t mind my observation that you seemed a million miles away today. Is everything all right?”
Steve swallowed a bite of his pie. “Not exactly.”
Clint sang aloud under his breath.
“Pfft. He’s a two-bit stooge. One of these days he’s gonna blow up at Fury and I’m gonna laugh my ass off.”
“I DON’T BELIEVE YOU!” The words hung in the air for a while; just long enough for the loyalty in the room to rearrange itself to a subtly different configuration.
“Sure, I guess. What do I do?”
The security guard, looming in the doorframe, hitched up his belt in a way he obviously thought looked threatening. “We have reason to believe that Mister Banner—”
Maria’s eyes flickered up and down him for a second—which, from Hill, felt like being run through a metal detector.  “Alright,” she said. “Check in at the infirmary, let them know I sent you. Get that injury iced and don’t let it happen again.”
talking about Clint Barton, right?”
“I really don’t get what the big deal i—”
“It bit me on my ankle,” said Peter. “Should it still be my left arm?”
Tony backed away, and Steve stood, hefting the taser with newfound respect. “So, teach me how to use one of these.”
“OH WERE WE,” said Clint. “I broke my
“How’d he look?” The question could’ve come off insensitive, but coming from Mr. Coulson is just sounded… nice. Curious, in a human kinda way.
“I saw,” said Tony. “What a shitshow, huh? I’m really sorry Happy made such a sloppy mess of himself, I know how you were hoping for something different.”
Mr. Coulson simply gazed at Steve.
“Yes,” said Steve, and then they were making out on Steve’s bunk, and it was
“We have a Norseman? A Norwegian? Whatever. A Thor, in my homeroom,” Tony said that evening over the guts of a disassembled iPhone he was trying to turn, somehow, into a projector. Steve just knew this was going to end in porn. “He’s gigantic. He’s like three of you mashed together, G.I. Joe.”
The security guard’s response was too low to decipher, but Steve caught the trashcan ricocheting across the hallway loud and clear.  The class sat riveted—through the door’s shattered half-window, Steve could see his teacher standing in the hallway, breathing deeply as he watched the security guard leave. Once the guard rounded the corner, he smoothed his tie and came back into the classroom, swiftly kneeling down by the black-haired boy, who was unsteadily trying and failing to sit up.
“Banner.”
“Why would you follow Miss Hill?” Peter Parker asked.
“Thanks. So, what’d you sign me up for?”
Stephen Strange, whose transformation into peaceful sorcerer from arrogant surgeon was still maybe only about 95% complete.
seen riding a horse shirtless on the beach,” Pepper said in a wounded tone as she came up behind Tony, tweaking him lightly on the earlobe before hugging Hope and Scott. “So glad you both could come. We
Thor puffed out his chest. “Of course.”
“Sir, this is Natasha Romanoff,” Barton said, something new and awed and tender in his voice, and Steve noticed Barton was standing a lot taller than he normally did.
“Yes it will!”
“Why??’
“What, he’s my protégée and he’s good to have in a scrap and if we don’t take him along on vacation with us, what kind of a message does that send? Happy, right up here’s fine.” Tony slid up on the seat, scooting towards the door of the ridiculously long party/prom limo he’d made Happy drive into Queens, and which he was now making Happy double-park on a fairly narrow street between two bodegas.
strange.
, Mister Ross, I will use one of Tony Stark’s many confiscated tasers on you until you are drooling onto the linoleum, and then I will teach a class
, Tony pulled back and said, “So not that I wouldn’t like to fuck you right here in this fountain, but there actually is quite a lot of algae.”
“How cold you do you have to get to go into hypothermia?” wondered Scott Lang aloud.
“What if he gets addicted or something?” Tony asked.
“You okay?” Steve asked.
Dean shrugged and remained silent.
Sam rolled over to face Dean and began, “You have a concussion and you had surgery yesterday. I stayed to make sure you didn’t die.” He said pointedly.
--------------------------
“I have found everything I can on a one Dean Winchester.” she began.
“Dean,” Steve said, keeping his calmness.
Dean quietly made his way to grab and apple for each him and Sam before motioning Sam to the front door. Sam stood without question and walked to the door, Dean following behind.
And with that Tony was off, and Bruce quickly followed after.
Dean nodded again, “Thank you,” he said genuinely.
Dean sighed and shook his head, “I don’t know,” he began, “I can’t really remember a time it wasn’t happening.”
He went to stand a few feet away from a thick tree and pulled out his gun from his waistband.
Bucky seemed to be forcing his anger into a slew of curses directed at John Winchester while Thor had the same sad look in his eyes as Bruce, as he quietly mumbled to himself.
Dean put his hands on Sam’s back and tightened his hold, “I know,” he responded.
crowd.
“Ok Dean,” the voice began, “There’s a bathroom at the end of this hallway and on the left. I’m FRIDAY by the way, Mr Stark’s AI.”
“Fine, now let’s go,” Tony said impatiently.
-------------------------------
“Stuff,” Dean said, sitting next to Sam on the couch.
John had returned home a few days later, drunk as usual.
The team continued to look at him but soon dropped it, seeing that it really had helped Dean.
“What?!” Sam practically yelled, surprised. “You have the avengers’ numbers?”
Tony looked down to Dean’s shirtless body and the many fierce red welts covering his back and arms.
--------------------------------------
“James, what are you doing up? You should be resting,” the doctor stated calmly.
Dean went straight for the signature line without reading the form, he had done this before. He started to write James, then turned to look at Sam.
It was the next day when Dean woke up properly and could move around, albeit slowly and in pain.
“Fuck,” Tony mumbled.
Then suddenly strong arms wrapped around him and he could hear a deep voice trying to speak to him, but it sounded slurred and far away from him.
“It was,” Clint started, “But he just looked so terrified, so I figured this could let us know he’s still safe while we think of a way to help.”
While Steve and Natasha headed straight for the older man, Tony and Bruce headed straight for the unconscious teen laying on the floor, a fair amount of blood pooling around him.
He began the surgery and the team stood to the side, still in shock over Dean’s abused body.
“You can go now,” Dean said, voice wavering slightly.
“Okay,” Steve stood, and he and Tony made their way to the door when they were stopped by an almost inaudible, “Thank you.”
Dean was sat on his bed trying to concentrate on his homework. He couldn’t get his mind to focus because he was trying hard not to think about his Dad coming home in five minutes. Dean tried not to be afraid of his father, but with the way John treats him, it’s hard not to be.
Dean turned and said, this time louder, “What the fuck!” In front of him was about twenty ugly blue things that he had never seen before and the avengers flying around and fighting about another ten just behind the ones stood before Dean.
“And?” Tony asked, “Did you find anything?”
“Okay,’ Steve began, “You can ask us for anything you need, from anyone, they’d all be happy to help with anything, so don’t be scared to ask.”
“Hey man,” Dean replied, “Gimme your phone I gotta add a few numbers to it.”
“On the corner of first and second,” Steve replied, while running over to the stumbling teenager.
“Good, thanks for letting us stay here,” Dean said, voice unwavering as always.
*You’re still going to help after Dean said no?* Sam texted in quick succession.
Instead of her stopping him to calm him down, like Steve thought, Nat swung over and over again at the semi-conscious man, pure rage fuelling every hit.
The team and Sam watched as Dean ran out the door.
“Is after breakfast ok?” Dean questioned.
“Very astute observation,” Dean responded, again lacking his usual self.
Dean nodded silently again.
With no words spoken between the two, Dean got up and headed back upstairs while his father slumped down onto the couch. When dean had reached his room, Sam was sat on his bed with the first aid box the same as he was every time Dad got rough.
It was 3am and Steve and Tony were awoken by FRIDAY’s voice.
“So,” Tony began.
“Is that all you want?” Tony asked.
-----------------------
“Tell us what happened.”
“What did you do with my father?” Sam asked, voice raw with emotion.
Dean remained silent.
“Oh?” Tony questioned.
Clint nodded, “A judging by the body paint, a girl.”
“What? No, he’s my brother!” Sam shouted angrily.
“I don’t need to tell you a damn thing,” Dean retorted, his angry glare once again appearing on his face.
----------------------------------
“Will he be ok?” Sam asked quietly.
“Okay Dean.”
Sam just looked at him solemnly and Dean approached the bed and sat down next to him. Sam immediately started to clean Deans wounds and made him take his shirt off. Dean thought that Sammy was too young to have deal with this kinda thing but was still glad to have him to help afterwards.
“Well then, I can leave,” Dean said stubbornly and made a move to leave when he realised, he was shirtless. His anger faded away and panic replaced it.
“Where’s my shirt?” Dean asked, a little gentler than before, but not showing any emotion.
“Are you sure we can just do that?” Bucky asked, “I thought the plan was get him and his brother out immediately?”
He downed them in quick secession. Then he orders a few more. And downed them.
The team shared a look, the brothers would’ve described it as excited, yet anxious.
Steve reached him and wrapped his arms around him when Dean looked like he was about to fall over.
Dean started waking up and the first thing he felt was a pounding in his head, the second thing he felt was a lurch in his stomach. With the lurch, he bolted upright, briefly noting an asleep Sam next to him, and then ran to the nearest bathroom. As soon as he found the room, the contents of his stomach come up and he threw up into the toilet.
Their eyes softened and they turned to look at him. “So you had a flashback?” Tony inquired. Dean shrugged and remained silent.
He exited onto the street outside and thanked all the God’s he knew that his Baby was parked just two blocks away. He raced to the impala and jumped into the driver’s seat, speeding off with the only thought in his head, ‘God, I hope Sammy’s ok.’
The team startled a bit from the silent teen’s sudden outburst, but quickly recovered.
“Why What?” Dean questioned.
They all looked up as he entered.
The team were silent for a moment, before the sound of FRIDAY’s voice filled the intense atmosphere.
“Sorry,” he apologised.
Natasha squirted some cream on her hand and gently rubbed it onto Dean’s back.
-------------------------
Bruce came back with the results, Dean had fallen asleep on the couch, sat up and Sam still hadn’t left his side.
Dean nodded, he didn’t want to admit it, but he felt relieved.
“Please continue FRIDAY,” Tony said.
He looked up and smiled again, “See, fine.”
Dean made his way other to his closet and again picked out a baggy t-shirt, but this time with dark blue jeans and a plain black baggy hoodie. He also picked out a pair of black converse.
--------------------------------
Dean sighed and swung his legs over the edge of the bed, the action made his back sting slightly.
“Sam, we’ll be there very soon ok?” Steve said, trying to hide the panic and anger in his voice, “You need to stay on the call.”
Dean was distracted when a sharp pain shot through his leg. John had stomped on it and it didn’t look great. There was a strange lump sticking out on his shin and he assumed it was his bone. The pain was tremendous, and Dean felt even more like he was going to pass out.
Dean ran out of the room while the team checked on Clint. ‘I didn’t mean to do that to him, it was just instinct,’ Dean thought to himself as he desperately tried to find a way out of the unfamiliar tower.
Sam came back outside with two doctors and they helped get Dean onto a stretcher and wheeled him inside.
Dean smiled slightly, ‘at least he can make jokes’ he thought to himself. “Honestly?” Clint nodded, “I don’t know,” Clint sighed.
He walked out of his room and spoke to FRIDAY.
“I’m leaving,” he started. The doctor looked as if he was about to interrupt when Dean spoke again, “I know the drill, just get me the form you need me to sign and I’m gone.”
There wasn’t much conversation and just as Steve was placing the last pancake onto a plate, Tony walked in, still in his pyjamas and looking like he wasn’t awake at all. He stumbled over to the coffee pot and poured a hefty amount off coffee into a particularly large mug. He gulped down a big mouthful and his eyes immediately lit up. “Oh, I really needed that, I wasn’t even convinced I was awake before,” stated Tony cheerily. Steve chuckled at his husband and proceeded to take the ginormous stack of pancakes and place it in the middle of the long dining table, where everyone was now sitting.
“I told you we know about New Jersey,” Natasha stepped forward, “Did that happen because of the social workers?”
Dean had decided to stay in his room, he was sat at the desk and had taken his hoodie off, as it had started to agitate his injuries.
The whole team broke into big grins.
Pain shot through his back at every step, but Dean hid it.
------------------------
“Hand it in to the nurse’s station when you’re done.” And with that the doctor had left once again.
Once he was dressed, Dean went to get Sammy out of bed, but to his surprise Sammy wasn’t in his room. He was downstairs and cooking breakfast, something that was normally Dean’s responsibility.
Everyone turned to the scientist expectantly.
Dean was walking through the woods and finally came to a relatively clear space.
Sam heard as Dean hit the ground, a sound he was all too familiar with.
“When do you need to go?” Steve asked.
As expected, a kick to the stomach soon followed.
Sam was deceptively strong for his slim stature, so he lifted Dean and put his arm over his shoulder. Sam dragged Dean to the car and lay him down in the backseat. He hopped in the driver’s seat and started the car, speeding out of the driveway and towards the hospital.
------------------------
Dean looked down and scratched the back of his neck, wincing when the pain started again, “Hey so, um, where’s uh, what’s happening to Dad?” He asked, almost as if he was ashamed.
The girl turned around, her head coming up to the top of Dean’s chest. She smiled at him and then pulled him closer and started dancing with him.
Dean was distracted when he nearly drove into the screaming lady that was running past his car. He slammed on the breaks and said, “What the Fuck!” The woman didn’t even seem fazed as she continued to run away from whatever had her so hyped up.
The AI quickly started again, “That’s all I could find on them until about 2 years ago. I found a CPS file with the names Sam and Dean Winchester. CPS were referred to the boys by a teacher who noticed continual bruising on Dean and reported it. In the file it said that CPS sent two social workers to the residence the boys were staying in, a motel. Once the social workers knocked on the door and Dean answered, they explained themselves and Dean immediately tried to get them to leave.” FRIDAY took a short break to let the information settle.
He then went to his closet and picked out some clothes to put on top of them to hide them, ‘It’s not like he actually needed the clothes with the whole fucking store Tony had stocked his closet with,’ Dean thought.
Steve woke up next to his husband, Tony, and smiled faintly. He will never get over waking up with him, he considered one of the best things to ever happen to him.
“Do you think he’s going to do anything stupid?” Natasha turned to Sam.
Dean threw his phone on the bed and sighed, waiting to hear a knock on the door.
Sam sat down at the table as Dean fixed the bacon. The couch was empty meaning that Dad was either up in his room or he left last night. Dean was praying that he left, or he would at least not wake up until the boys were out of the house. Dean was sporting a purple bruise on his left cheek, mirroring the slightly more healed yellow greenish one on the side if his chin, a small cut just above his right eyebrow and a busted right side of his lower lip. He didn’t particularly feel like reopening the cuts.
“Taken?” asked a bewildered Sam.
“No the burn scars aren’t twelve years old, and besides, a fire wouldn’t cause the other scars we saw,” Bruce replied calmly.
He pulled it out of his pocket and announced, “It’s Sam.”
“Alright you can wait here or go with Sam, but I’m gonna do my stuff alone,” Dean said as he walked up the stairs.
Dean instinctively reached for the gun he usually kept in his waistband, just to realise that he didn’t have it, and started to panic just a little. But then he remembered the voice from the elevator and relaxed slightly.
“We need to get him back to the tower now,” Bruce stated urgently.
“Well shit,” murmured Bucky.
Steve and Tony turned to Sam, “You want us to help you?” Tony asked.
----------------------------------
“Dean?” Sam questioned.
“I’m just sorry you had to go through so much,” she said as she finished rubbing the cream on Dean’s back.
--------------------------------
----------------------
Dean stayed silent but gave a small nod. ‘Why the hell am I even talking to them?’ Dean thought.
“Language,” Steve admonished.
Dean had gotten to his room and thrown himself on his bed.
“We can eat on the way.” Dean answered to Sam’s questioning look, “We’re gonna be late.” Sam didn’t respond but instead took the tissue with the bacon a headed to the door, scooping up his backpack.
Sam heard as his father called Dean downstairs.
Dean flinched slightly at the hand, which didn’t go unnoticed by the team, but handed his phone over anyway.
“Dean you were hurt, badly,” Tony began but was interrupted by Dean.
Steve nodded, “Okay, me and Tony will take you.”
Dean pulled up just outside the tower and walked in with Sammy.
Dean exited the circle of people and headed back to class.
Dean just stared straight ahead and swallowed.
Sam sped down the road with Dean motionless in the back.
Dean went over to the couch and sat a few seats away from Steve.
“It was so we could help you. We saw the scars Dean,” Steve added.
-----------------------------
He found a stairwell a just ran down as far as he could, exiting into lobby area and continuing to run out of the building, ignoring the odd looks he got from everyone and the flaring pain in his chest.
Captain America and Ironman looked at him weirdly for a moment as he still remained silent.
“Dean are you okay?” Steve asked as the he saw the rest of the team quickly coming closer.
“Ok so let’s all connect to the comms and split up to search,” Steve said.
“Yeah, Bruce can fix him up in no time,” Bucky said.
He stopped for a few seconds and took a deep breath before walking in.
“It was nothing, you can ask for help with anything.”
The table relaxed, but only slightly.
*Do you have any clothes around here* he texted Tony.
‘It’s good to see you Baby, it’s been too long,’ he thought.
The team and Sam were sat around the table eating when FRIDAY spoke up.
“No, he did not,” The AI spoke again.
John’s vision was swimming and when his eyes focused again, he was seeing Captain America standing over him, his shield held firmly.
Dean kissed her one last time and left for the door.
Steve was sat in the living room with the whole team when his phone rang.
Dean tensed up, standing still as a statue. The room went silent, all turning to look at Dean.
A reply came in almost immediately, *We stocked up the closet in your room* it read.
Dean looked down at Steve, “I’m so sorry,” he began quietly, “I didn’t mean to, I’m so sorry.”
“Look, its ok kid, we know your name because we checked your ID and you’re at Avengers Tower because you collapsed and needed surgery,” Tony calmly explained.
Dean nodded his thanks and locked the door as Clint left.
The whole team were rapt with attention, listening to every detail FRIDAY told them.
It was nearly time to take off the cast, but Dean didn’t want to go to the hospital, so he had texted the avengers for the first time, asking if he could get his cast of at the tower.
Sam was about to respond but he felt himself being led back to the tower by Thor’s strong grip, so he just let out a frustrated sigh.
The brothers exited the house and made their way to the impala in silence.
----------------------------------
“Did he say where he was going?” Steve asked, slightly panicked.
‘Damn it.’ He cursed himself again.
“Wait, you just had surgery, you shouldn’t be out of bed let alone moving around,” Steve said quickly.
“The boy is a great fighter,” Thor said in his usual happy tone, which felt out of place in the sombre atmosphere of the room.
Dean sighed, “I’ll be fine,” he said again.
Natasha stepped forward and whispered, “We know what your Dad does, and we know about New Jersey.”
------------------------------------------
Dean smiled as best he could and choked out, “Yep Sammy, nothing to worry about.”
Dean just took the bottle and nodded his thanks.
“The girl I was dancing with offered it and again I thought…” Steve raised his eyebrows, “Well, the same as before,” he finished. Tony’s small smile went unnoticed.
-------------------------------
Dean thought about why he freaked out and did what he did. He realised that he was angry. At his dad. At the world. At life. And he realised that going to shoot a gun wasn’t going to help in the long run.
“You really shouldn’t….” the doctor started again, but Dean interrupted.
They were all stood behind the school in somewhat of a circle.
Dean looked up at the man standing in front of him.
That’s how they found the four sat in a car together driving to the brothers’ old home.
“Sit,” Tony said firmly.
“Sure,” Steve answered, also with a kind smile.
Once Dean was finished, he dropped down onto the floor and leant against the cold, tiled wall, the coldness cooling his temperature.
“How do we help him?” Steve asked.
Another punch to the face and a kick to the stomach and Dean was gone. His vision started to fade, and he passed out.
“I’m fine. I don’t need help,” he said.
---------------------------
“Always do,” Sam replied solemnly.
Sam stood and followed, only to nearly bump into Dean when the older boy was stopped by one of the doctors that treated Dean earlier.
He ran straight to the stairs leading to the lobby of the tower, and outside, running for a few blocks before he slowed down to speed walk.
Clint just shrugged and went back to punching, while Natasha and Bucky went back to sparring.
“Dean has told me to let you know that he has gone out and will be back later,” FRIDAY spoke.
They all made their way out of the house and to their respective cars.
Dean walked into the living area of the tower and straight into the avengers and Sam sat watching TV.
“Ok, we should all split up and look, except Thor and Sam, Thor, Sam’s too young and someone needs to look after him,” Steve said, taking charge.
Sam had mathletes after school today, so Dean had a couple of hours after school to kill before he had to pick Sammy up. He was thinking he was just going to drive around for a bit and wait.
“Just promise you won't do it again?” Sam asked softly. Dean smiled slightly and looked Sam in the eyes, “Promise,” he answered. The two sat in silence on Sam’s bed.
“You alright Dean?” Sam asked concerned.
“I have found Dean Winchester,” the AI stated calmly.
“So,” Steve asked, “What do ya think?”
‘Great, I can smell the scotch from here,’ Dean thought to himself. Dean tried to make his way upstairs but was stopped by his father yelling, “Dean! Get in here now!” Dean took a deep breath and made his way to the living room.
Steve stood back up as Tony lifted the boy into his arms and flew away towards the tower. Steve looked up as his husband zipped through the sky with a limp body dangling in his arms.
He stepped out of his room and headed down a hallway towards the kitchen, which was one big room with the dining room and living room as well.
“I didn’t give them one, just make something up.” Sam stated without emotion. He hated seeing his brother hurt and seen the many times that Dean refused to get help.
He bumped into a girl dressed in a bikini top and short shorts, with glowing body paint all over her body.
Sam stood up and walked next to Dean, then turned to look at the avengers.
Dean gave an affirming nod but remained silent, his pain was starting to come back a little more and he didn’t trust himself to speak.
“Perhaps there’s more to the story,” Thor interjected. “Please FRIDAY, carry on.”
A light knock on his door startled him out of his thoughts.
He started to walk away, but before he could make it far, Steve was overtaking him and stopping in front him, halting his escape.
“Maybe you should stop for today,” Bucky suggested.
‘Fucking great,’ Dean thought to himself, ‘stupid fucking crutches.’
Dean pulled out his cheeky smile and replied, “Steve and Tony said it was okay as long as I don’t go to hard.”
---------------------------
“I picked him up on a parking lot camera at Lincoln High,” she said.
------------------------------
Dean didn’t really plan on using the numbers, but Sam did.
“I walked for ages, found a club and thought ‘fuck it’,” Dean answered.
“Breakfast is ready Dean, the team is in the kitchen with your brother,” The AI spoke.
The brothers waited for Tony and Steve to pull out of the driveway, so that they could reverse out to, and then followed them back to the tower.
Dean headed straight over to the punching bag next to Clint’s and went to start hitting it.
The rest of the team showed up after Bruce had finished and they were sat around Dean’s bed.
“Dean, we’ll drive you okay?” Steve phrased it as a question, but his tone said otherwise.
The bullets all landed in a tight circle, with barely a few millimetres between each one. Dean shot the gun until his clip was empty and lowered his arms.
Dean stopped punching at the sound of Sammy’s voice.
The other four who were left stood in the gym started to make their way to the kitchen in silence.
The door opened slowly, and Bruce, Tony and Steve entered the room.
The team seemed to relax as well.
He tried to turn quickly but struggled because of his broken leg.
Sam looked at his brother, as if saying ‘you don’t have to be suspicious of everything Dean’. Then turned back to the team and smiled even bigger than before and said, “We’d love to. Thank you so much!”
“No,” Natasha started, “That’ll probably just freak him out more.”
The husbands smiled back at Dean and he turned around to begin walking to the gym.
“What about my jacket? Where is it?” Dean asked, more and more panic seeping through his words no matter how hard he tried to keep it down.
“I think you already know what happened,” Dean answered dully. Tony sighed and closed his eyes. “Dean,” he said warningly. Dean still looked up at him, defiantly.
----------------------------------
When school finished, Dean was already at the impala when Sam walked over.
“Ok that’s actually kinda smart…” Bucky conceded.
“Good to see you awake,” Sam said. Dean just grunted as he made a move to get off the bed but stopped when a sharp pain shot through his left leg.
Steve looked up when he heard the ding of the elevator and relaxed his tense shoulders when he saw Dean walk into the room.
“Do you think he’ll come out for lunch?” Steve asked.
“A few hours ago?” Tony parroted. “We need to help that kid, shit seems real bad.”
Six Weeks Later:
Once they reached the room, Steve knocked but they received no answer. They knocked again, but again didn’t receive an answer.
Steve sighed but nodded slightly. He then led the high teenager to the couch and sat him down, eyes stinging from the smell of the tequila. He turned to Bruce, “You should run his blood, so we know what he’s taken.” Bruce nodded and went to retrieve the necessary equipment.
Dean made his way back to his room and took off his shirt, a small amount of blood had seeped through that as well. His back stung but he ignored it and just lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling.
“Good,” said Carol. “Now I’m gonna fall asleep on you. Wake me up when we get to Philly.”
“Well, it’s my second, so you’re one up on me,” said Steve. “I suppose they can’t get too mad at us for getting lost.”
They hit the door of Steve’s little room kissing and stripping, all elbows and knees as wet swim trunks and Iron Man-branded rash guards went flying. Steve’s mouth was wet, needy and harsh in a way Tony recognized—it mirrored a hunger in him, one he hadn’t felt for a long, long time. It had been a while since he’d wanted anyone the way he wanted—his mind still shied away from calling him “Steve”, he noticed, he was more comfortable calling him “Rogers”, or even “Cap”, and he made a mental note to ask Pepper what that was about. Probably a defense mechanism, if he had to take a guess.
“That’s high blood pressure,” Stephen Strange said. “Jealous?”
“He probably isn’t up there,” Sam Wilson pointed out.
,” Tony said. “They have gothy kids with emotional problems, and practicioners of the fine art of Wicca, and kids who have dedicated their lives to walking around in—what’s that really weird anime getup where they dress half like porno schoolgirls but there’s also gloves and really tall hats?”
“It is pretty scandalous,” Bruce said mildly.
“It’s the swipey kind,” Tony said as he felt very gently around the edges of the reader, looking for somewhere he could jam a metal shim, maybe get into the circuitry. He felt Scott’s breath puffing over his ear. Jesus, it was worse than eating bacon in front of a dog. “Lang, I swear to God, if I can’t get into this thing you will get first crack.”
“When we lost the Cold War,” replied Mr. Coulson, turning out the classroom lights behind them.
“I can move heavy obstacles, should we encounter any,” said Thor, doing some preliminary flexing.
“I’ve heard it mentioned,” said Sam. “Listen, my point is—”
“Sorry,” said Steve. “It helps if you’re not expecting it too much.”
“Am I a bad listener?” Steve asked, out loud, in art period. Bruce Banner looked up from his linoleum stamp project. looking first at Natasha (who was tuning everyone out), Thor (flirting with a tiny sophomore), and Clint (looking just as confused as Bruce).
“Not stealing, hot-wiring,” Tony said. “Ant Man, Phillips’ head or flathead?”
Everyone turned to crane.
“I’ve got it from here,” said Steve. As the truck pulled away, he looked around the town he’d last seen over a year ago, as he jogged through it in formation with a hundred other sweating, chanting recruits. And Bucky. It looked pretty much the same—public high school, Dairy Queen not yet open this early in the morning, credit union. The morning fog lay heavy over the town, clouding the hills and bluing the distance. Steve hoisted his pack on his shoulder and began the walk out of town towards the Academy.
for you, man.”
“We were going to break into your old school and find you,” said Scott Lang. “Because, uh, reasons,” he said, shrinking under Tony’s glare.
Siri’s voice made everyone jump. “Zemo, Delaware, is two hours away by fastest route.” Tony was holding his phone up in one hand, van keys in the other. “We ready to go?”
, Rogers, you about gave me a coronary.”
and—SHIT.”
“Don’t sass your team captain,” said Tony, but ceded space at the rim of the cavern.
“Close your mouth,” Tony hears Nat mutter very low under her breath to Clint, and he had to tamp down on his urge to do a little dance of celebration, because he
“Holy shniekes,” the nurse said, dropping the cotton balls and tape on the exam table and grabbing Bruce’s arm. “Barton, your nose is gonna have to wait while I do triage.”
, he left unsaid.
“Huh,” said Clint, staring at the ceiling. “They’ve got some water damage in here.”
“My cousin says he did once,” said Lang, “But he’s in jail right now, so I don’t know how good it works.”
“Is it armed?” said Bruce.
“But state parks always have really shitty security,” said Scott Lang.
“See if you can guess the password to get onto the student records system.”
“Someone hand me a screwdriver?”
“Only the ones which really piss me off,” Barton said cheerfully, and then Nurse Sitwell  came into the room, frowning at a chart. When he looked up, his face fell even further.
“You heard me, come with us. You’re Rogers’s friend. I mean, I’m his fuck but you’re his friend, he’ll listen to you, plus, seeing a friendly in the van might mean he won’t rabbit the second he sees us.”
“Ten bucks, that seems a little low,” said Tony, peeling off the bills.
“Is everything funny to you?”
“That’s what I’m saying,” said Clint. “How can I help you, my child?”
“Really shoulda had a name in mind before you started that sentence, genius,” Sitwell told him, handing him a wad of gauze. “Here. Bite down on this. It’ll stop your bleeding problem and your speaking problem.”
, we were almost kidnapped by hill people in Bucksnort, Peter got bitten by a radioactive poisonous shit-eating deathspider—”
“Uh, have you
“Oh, Tony,” Steve said. “Yes. Thank you. This is more than thoughtful.”
me, not really the outdoors type,” said Tony. “Plus I don’t go in for… uh. Calisthenics. Whatever—this is.” They’d come to the six-foot wall.
“Tony, Tony,” Steve holds his ass with one arm, uses the other to open the door, closing it with his hips, then dropping Tony to the bed. King-sized because Tony likes to stretch out. Steve has said,
Tony flinched. There was an image swimming in the edges of his memory. Steve standing over him. The shield hitting his faceplate again and again until it cracked open.
I’ve always thought it was difficult to be loved. You proved me wrong. I’ve never thought that it's a loveless world, Steve. There’s so much hope. Yearning. Isn’t that why we do what we do? Because we love? Believe me, I did it for that.
He flexes his hand against the counter top, keeping his eyes on Tony’s form. The desire to stand behind him, grip his shoulder, and apologize, say a million things, is strong. But it’s a behemoth task, and while Steve’s punched the Red Skull and piloted the Valkyrie, he remains there, unmoving, paralyzed by potential rejection.
Steve could do this. He could hash this out now, say a million practiced apologies, list out his faults and where he’s wrong and how he’ll get better and they’ll be fine goddamnit, but he settles for the digging in his feet and saying the truth: “It would mean a lot if you joined me.”
“New life.” The waitress returns to refill his mug. She nods towards the mother and child standing beside the pink balcony railings overlooking the sea. “You alright, sir?”
That’s all we are, Steve, a body containing memories that light up with emotions. Reactions to life, to actions, to events. We’re just bodies and chemical balances and imbalances that
“You noticed that?” Steve blushed, picking up their interlaced fingers and kissing it. “I thought I was being subtle.”
He tries to stay close to Tony, afraid to lose him as they pass through a throng of people. “Er, I saw you kiss someone at the party,” Steve says, yelling in case Tony doesn’t hear him.
“I always am,” Steve says, knowing he’s lying through his teeth.
You, that version of you, asked me about the Civil War. You said it must have been difficult to do what I think is right. It was difficult for you, too, I realize that now. But I wouldn’t change a damn thing. It had to be done.
“I’m really fine. This happens all the time,” Tony huffs. “That’s a little fucked, I guess.”
Psychologists and analysts in SHIELD watch security tapes and note that crossing arms over one’s body as a sign of defense. But Steve didn’t agree with that. He did the same everyday like clockwork. Instead, it felt like he was trying to hug himself, offer his body some sort of comfort, a testament to grounding oneself.
People are consumed by grief, they don’t know how to live without it. It’s a friend you welcome home, because otherwise, you’d be alone. Empty in a mausoleum full of faded photographs that retain no information. Grief lets you digest the despair of loss.
He didn’t touch the “house clothes” that Tony wore around the workshop. That was a mission for another day. For now, Steve grabbed the boxes filled with professional clothing and brought them to the attic. It took him three trips in total and he stacked them on top of each other.
Steve pushes Tony’s hair back, and he wonders if it’s better to be in the gallows with the rest of them.
“Look, I appreciate all of you checking on me and the kids. But it’s getting to the point we’re feeling smothered.”
The world feels endless on the open highway.
No, he doesn’t want to scare Tony away, it’s too soon for that.
Or, a shield to someone’s chest.
“Yeah, I know, we gotta trust them to do that work. And I do. But. Well.” Tony punches Steve’s arm and rolls his eyes. “Don’t think I haven’t seen you eyeing Sam’s shield.”
When Ty offered lines, Tony thought, fuck it, it's a regular Thursday night. He clears his throat. His mouth has the faint taste of bile and something bitter. He really should stop smoking and blow like he's chasing some lost love. Tony supposes that's the thing, isn't it? Running after the high so he can stop thinking so goddamn much. His brain is never quiet. He can have a conversation with three people and be doing equations and inventing something at the same time.
She squeezes his bicep and pushes him forward into the communal floor.
We worked things out in another universe. It’s too late for this one.
“That’s the plan, baby. Don’t act like you aren’t dying to paint the extra bedrooms. Hmm, blue’s a nice color. Like your eyes.”
For a moment, Tony thinks he’ll be allowed to lie there, that they’ll let him melt onto the floor until there’s nothing left. He hoped that the guards would shoot him down and put his photo on the wall. But Steve kneels down, waves the officers off, and they’re alone.
Only this time, Tony chokes on a sob when Steve ducks down and licks his lips. Tony surrenders. Steve coaxes his mouth open, and they’re wrapping around each other, kissing hard and fast, equal measures of longing and spit. Tony nibbles on Steve’s bottom lip, receiving a groan and squeeze on his ass.
“We can play it every night.”
Steve didn’t try to change the memories.
It’s always there. Always will be. Grief doesn’t end, Steve’s learned that by now, but he doesn’t want to spend his life grieving.
He stitches the cuts himself and takes a warm towel to my face. Then, he murmurs dark threats that masquerade as apologies. He calls me Tony when he says, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to. It’s just — you get — you’re not following orders. I told you what to do. Can’t you just do it? Tony, please. I’m asking here.”
He struggled to keep his breath even, sobs breaking free. His throat ached and itched.
Tony looks at him with something akin to concern. “You must be overwhelmed.”
“How dangerous. Hope: a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper. Francis Bacon said that. Pretty funny considering what he’s saying about breakfast.”
Tony was going to be sick. He was already sick. They all said that Steve came to Broxton, but he didn’t stay to see Tony awake.
Steve’s still learning parenting. His official claim to Morgan is by marriage, and sometimes he catches himself wondering if he’s overstepping by buying her everything she asks for and indulging every single one of her hobbies.
“It’s well cared for.” The man nods, solemn.
Once again, they’re worlds apart.
He grabs the knife from my remaining hand and I let it go. I stare at him in defiance, just the way Tony would have.
All Steve wanted to do was breakdown, climb into bed and never leave.
Tony’s eyes shut close, there’s a tiny whimsical frown on the curve of his lips. “Still broken,” he says, likely thinking of new fractions of villains and trouble makers popping up around the world.
But he lived.
I am at a loss for words. Steve feeds me poison with these lies. He doesn’t understand why we came here.
“Tony, Tony, Tony, fuck,” he repeats the name again and again, measuring it with each thrust, each roll of his hips. Then, his tears are falling, fat, ugly things. I kiss it away and pretending each peck is a punch on his face.
Tony splutters and begins questioning Johnny about Richard Reed’s new research project, which makes Peter sigh and grab Johnny by the waist to swing them both across the lake.
Steve watches his throat work, grateful that it’s dark and he has his legs bent so Tony can’t see his cock thicken. How he’s thought about this on dark, dreary nights in the desert. Tony Stark as his only salvation. Here he is, in the flesh, sitting beside Steve when he could be with anyone else. It’s a dream come true.
Just waiting.
He’s trying. Conversations don’t come easy for him these days.
Pinned to the bed like a bizarre version of Christ, he planned to stay and bleed on the bed sheets instead of opening the bottle.
Tony’s no longer eating Rumiko out, but she’s got her fingers on her clit and she’s pushing Tony back to Steve. Permission granted. It makes him feel sick that she’s letting this happen, and he’s a goddamn dog, taking the proffered scraps.
Maybe lies stop being lies when everyone believes it to be true.
Steve smiles, and there’s something too soft about it. Too public. They never do this. Ever. But Tony writes it off as fitting with the moment. “It’s me. Steve Rogers.”
He can’t see Steve anymore, but he feels his breath on his back. A finger outlines his vertebrae, and Tony counts each one. Twelve down the thoracic. Five down the lumbar, and then Steve's pawing at his sacrum, fingers fluttering until he reaches the center of Tony’s ass. "There you are," he says, spreading Tony's cheeks.
“It snows in New York and you did just fine there.” Steve smiles, leaning down to give Tony a peck on the lips.
There was a time when he thought Steve looked back at him and Tony saw interest and awe written all over his face.
the futurist and he’s not even here to see how the future unfolds for
He read up essays and books on cancer, survivorship, and he’s had endless meetings with Tony’s doctors. They all said Steve needed to be prepared. But what the fuck did that mean?
He stares at his reflection, tilting his head to see the flesh of throat.
Here I am, a broken, rotten thing. Steve Rogers is right about that.
Tony feels empty, and it’s short lived relief because Steve’s standing over him, pulling Tony to his chest and grabbing his cock.
When patience left him, he resorted to nailing his hand once again. This time he set the nails on his fingertips and in the between his knuckles.
“So that’s a yes, huh?”
He could haul his ass up and walk the seven steps to open the hotel mini-fridge. The selection was varied. From where he was currently sprawled on the bed, he could see the gleaming bottle of Knob Creek beside the Blue Label. He could do it. He could walk over. He was functional now. Brain and organs were intact with minimal damage.
Sometimes a common threat, an enemy, is all that held us together. We always make sense when we are fighting. Battle is the only time we might be honest, be truer versions of ourselves. I like to think that I know you, Steve. All that you are. All these atoms that make up your flesh. Fitting, isn’t it, a man in a machine — maybe that’s all that’s left of me, repulsor held, battle ready — admires the one made out of blood, flesh, bone. You’re more than that, and fuck you for it.
When Steve finished, he sat on the edge of the tub and watched Tony. He pushed Tony's hair back and Tony knew that Steve was always the braver one out of both of them, but he wondered where this impulse to touch came from.
Tony is stretched open and the pressure swallows him. Tears hit his lips. “No, I have to pee. The water. You. Pee. I.”
Tony melts the materials for the badge, crafts it, and has Carol Danvers approve the words Deputy Sheriff.
(Going back to find)
“Steve, remember what you told me?”
“Someone should look after him,” he replies, falling on parade rest. He wants to storm into the house and make sure Tony’s alright, cared for. “Not a cop. Ex-military.”
Even when Steve’s angry, he’s still the perfect man. Shaped and living ideals Tony could never measure up to. He's tried. He's trying.
“Get up!” Carol yelled, jumping forward to grip him by the shoulders.
“We’re gonna put a rose bush there.” Tony pointed at the empty lot. “An orchard. I want a greenhouse.” He made both of his gauntlet hands stretch wide, opened his faceplate and turned to Steve. “Can you imagine it, Cap?”
They intertwined their fingers and stood, bidding Steve a too-friendly goodbye.
“I’ll never figure you out, Tony Stark.” Steve grinned, bumping their shoulders again. It was friendly, no big deal. He was really happy that Tony’s his teammate, friend.
Every morning, when he woke up in bed alone. When he stepped into the shower, Tony’s hair products lined the walls and stared at him. He didn’t have the courage to throw them away. He couldn’t. Not yet, maybe not ever. Who cared if that was unhealthy? Tony used to scrub his hair with it every morning, sometimes with Steve lathering soap on his back. Then, he’d turn, soap suds on his eyebrows and kiss Steve until he was breathless.
He wished Tony could eat the entire box and enjoy it.
This was all because Steve loves him.
Steve swallowed, took the sponge and scrubbed his torso and the back of his legs. He recalled how Tony used to get on his knees and tell Steve to put his hands on the shower walls. He had complained about the shower tiles digging onto his knees and how he wasn’t as spry as Steve. Then, Tony had taken the shower sponge and scrubbed the back of his thighs, teasing Steve by caressing his ass, before dutifully soaping the rest of Steve’s body. After Steve was clean of soap, Tony kissed his shoulder then passed the sponge to Steve.
He raises the comforter, hugs Tony’s chest, and goes to sleep to the sound of the ocean rippling outside.
“Yes, sweetheart,” Steve replied.
Morgan is bouncing in place with a basket of petals. She’s in a peach dress and her hair is braided to the side. Her big ol’ eyes stare up at him. “Pops! Did we surprise you?”
He stared at Steve for a beat, unsure of what this was about. Tony wasn’t used to people being gentle or kind anymore. But here was Steve, proving him wrong again and again.
There’s Clint and his own family just on the other side. He nods at Steve, pleased, and he can’t help but wonder what Natasha would say if she was here, if she would stand beside him or prefer to sit beside Clint. He wonders what she would wear and if she would match with Morgan.
Steve doesn’t understand how. Tony is perfect by his standards.
“I came to tell you that I was wrong when I said that we can't help people who are determined to destroy themselves. I should have tried harder. I was fucking broken up, Tony. You weren’t on my side. I know this isn’t the first time we’ve fought, but this was the first time I thought I’d really lose you. That there’d be no coming back. I was scared. I was upset.” Steve turned, his eyes nearly black in the dark. There was nothing but the crack of the light to illuminate them. But it was obvious that Steve was warring between rage and something else, something bitter.
get to die
“Yeah?” Harley asked.
He chokes in his shock and glances away. He wants nothing more than to face Tony head on, but he can’t look into his eyes. Not yet.
The star doesn't bind him to the job. Steve's always been an honorable man. Tony almost hates him for it. But well, Tony's always had a strong reaction whenever it came to Steve.
Tony took all of this, catalogued it in his new brain. A new memory. There was nothing to override this time.
Steve nods, having nothing else to say.
Steve dropped the bottle to the caddy, staring at the rest of Tony’s shower products lining the walls. He decided that once he’s used up the cedar shampoo, the rest of the conditioner, and the shower gel, he’ll put them in the recycling bin.
“You want me to go with you?”
“There you are.”
These days, with gods, aliens, and a boatload of science experiments, Steve’s fate in the Lord has been shaken. He didn't know if he still believed in an all-knowing God, but he wondered about Tony's soul. He couldn't stand the thought of burying his body six feet below ground, to be eaten away, to decompose.
“Steve! You can’t bench me.” Tony threw a hand up, annoyed. “Stop being so controlling! You’re such a pain in the ass, I swear to fuck. I told you, I’m fine. I’ll be good in a couple of days.”
He wants to stand. He wants to stop lying, broken on the floor. He wants the smell of ammonia to stop filling his lungs with each inhale.
“Manual labor looks good on you,” Steve easily replies, then balks once his brain catches up because he didn’t mean to sound so honest.
“I just —“ He swallows and keeps still. Breathing exercises are important to quell the defense in his tongue. He doesn’t want to fight, he didn’t come here for that. “I wanted to say goodbye.”
“Nightcap, Cap?” She smiles at her own joke.
“I don’t know. I think we need to talk.”
In the middle of the bouquet was Tony's old reactor. He barked a laugh at their inside joke. Tony once told him that he might have pursued Pepper if the tide blew that way. But they weren’t the type of people to chase after each other, not like Steve and Tony.
Steve bites down his surprise. This is new. Between the two of them, any disagreement resulted in both Tony and Steve doubling down and barking at each other until one left the room.
Steve missed his presence this past week and a half. Tony’s absence made him realize that he scheduled so much of his time around Tony.
The husbands were on their feet and out of the room quickly, speeding down the halls to get to Dean’s room.
As much as Dean disliked his Dad, he did thank him for one thing, the 1967 Chevy Impala that Dad had given to Dean, even if it was just because his father couldn’t fix it so just decided to get a new truck. But with Dean being as well versed as he is in cars, he managed to get her working again, his Baby was his pride and joy.
“You go straight up to your room when we get inside,” Dean said seriously.
He placed the teen, stomach down on the hospital bed and waited only two minutes until Bruce showed up, shortly followed by Thor and Sam.
--------------------------
The elevator responded with a, “Sure thing Mr. Winchester.” Starling both Sam and Dean before it started to move upwards.
-----------------------
----------------------------
Clint smiled kindly, “It was nothing, no lasting damage.”
Dean just shrugged.
*No problem* Tony texted back not even a second later.
*Sure thing*
“He’s not only drunk. Look at his eyes, he’s high,” Tony said solemnly.
Sam called Bruce over and whispered something to him.
“Fuck,” Nat and Bucky spoke at the same time.
“He’s drunk,” Steve stated, as the team came within ear shot.
“I don’t know Dean, we don’t want you to get hurt,” Steve added sceptically.
He glanced at the tube of cream on his desk and picked it up.
“Drugs? I mean, drugs?” Tony asked incredulously.
“It’s a cream to put on you back, to help them heal,” he started, “You might need help to get some areas and you can ask anyone you want to.’’
“Woah, woah, calm down Dean, you’re alright,” Captain America said steadily.
“I’m fine, I’ve had worse,” Dean said without thinking and immediately hardened his face further.
Dean seemed to focus on his surroundings for the first time if his shout of “Sammy!” was anything to go by.
Dean rolled his eyes and went over to the tape.
--------------------------
“Let’s talk outside. I don’t want the other kids to see you,” Dean said through a shaky breath.
“No!” He shouted.
“Why?” Sam asked but still handed the phone over without hesitation.
Sam just nodded and took the apple from Dean, taking a big bite from it while Dean sped off in the direction of school.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay Dean, you’re okay now,” Steve soothed as he moved closer still.
“Dean, we ran your name when you left…” Tony began.
“Would you keep it down Sammy?” Dean whisper shouted.
He saw a black hoodie slung over the back of a chair and reached for it, ignoring the searing in his back as he stretched. He grabbed it off of the chair and towards him.
Before Dean knew it, he was drifting off to sleep once again.
When Dean walked into the living room, hair still wet, he saw Tony pacing in front of a calm looking Steve.
He was concerned, but didn’t go out right away, not until he stopped hearing the soft cries coming from downstairs.
“We have to stop him!” Tony responded.
Dean woke up the next day with a dull ache in his head and a slight throb in his leg. He also noticed Sammy was asleep next to him. Dean let out a small amused huff of laughter and poked Sammy in the shoulder.
“Just want to go home,” Dean replied, a slight edge of anger to his tone. Dean started to head towards the door.
Sam looked at his brother weirdly but stayed quiet and started munching on his bacon.
“I need to go with him,” Sam began,
Dean came out of the bathroom fully dressed and scowling.
“Ok,” Tony started, “Let’s go get him.”
-----------------------------------
He walled straight past the lobby receptionist and headed to the elevator. When he and Sam had entered the elevator, he didn’t know which floor to say, so he just gave his name.
He slowly got out of their bed and made his way to the kitchen. Every one of the avengers, and Bucky, lives in the tower with Tony and Steve as they thought it would just be easier should an emergency arise. Steve was always the one to cook, he would prepare breakfast for everyone while the whole team slowly funnelled into the kitchen. Usually Natasha would enter first and try to help with the cooking, but Steve banned her from helping after she nearly burnt the kitchen down. Then Bruce would enter and start brewing the coffee. Thor, Clint and Bucky would show up sometime after with Tony always being the last awake and in the kitchen. Today was no different.
His father didn’t bother to speak again before a fist collided with Dean’s right cheek. Dean stumbled but didn’t fall. This seemed to aggravate John because the next punch was harder. Dean fell to the floor, but on his way down, he hit his head on the wall and his vision started to blur. ‘Don’t pass out again,’ he thought to himself as he struggled to stay awake.
“Listen kid,” Tony also walked forward, “We could help you. Get you out.”
Dean smiled and put his arm around his little brother.
Slowly Dean stopped shaking and pulled away from Steve.
Dean stood up and exited the living room to go find Sam, leaving the husbands to talk.
--------------------------------
“Clearly,” Tony whispered to himself, but Dean heard and glared at him. Tony felt an embarrassed flush creep up his cheeks. Dean made a move to leave but Clint put his arm out in front of him, making Dean flinch back, causing Clint to recoil his arm quickly.
Dean just pulled out the apple and gave it to Sam.
“He’ll be charged quickly given that we all witnessed what happened and you can testify to the past years even if Dean doesn’t. Plus, people only need to look at his body before knowing what’s been happening. So, he’ll go away, we’ll make sure of it,” Natasha added., rage still bubbling slightly.
He grabbed he backpack and went to all the hiding places in his room, picking out his multiple guns, knives and other weapons, placing them carefully into his bag.
Steve overtook the boy and stood in front of him.
Dean walked to his closet and pulled out some black joggers, ‘easier to get over the cast’ he thought to himself. He also pulled out a plain black t-shirt and a white AC/DC jumper.
Dean was still punching when Sam slowly walked up to him.
Dean smiled and let out a huff of air, “Thank you, you have no idea how much I’ve needed this.”
“His body…” Natasha whispered, so quietly that the team almost didn’t hear her.
“Come in,” he called out.
“Take your shirt off and turn around.”

“We took him to the police station and explained what happened, they have him in a cell,” Steve explained.
“What?” Sam asked.
‘Where should I go today?’ Dean thought as he was getting into the front seat of the impala. ‘Maybe just drive around, get a burger or something.’ And with that Dean was off, speeding away out of the school parking lot.
“I thought you might like to talk to someone who isn’t technically your legal guardian or anything first,” Clint shrugged.
*Hi, my names Sam Winchester, my brother Dean gave me your numbers* He texted quickly.
Dean surged forward quickly and pushed Steve, Steve was shocked and didn’t have time to prepare himself, so ended up falling down. Dean jumped onto him and started punching and didn’t look like he was going to stop.
