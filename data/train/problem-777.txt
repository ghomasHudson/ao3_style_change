John smiled, "So you knew that about me beforehand?"
*AGAIN I ASK WHY SHOULD I RETURN AND HAVE YOU FOUND A WAY THAT EVEN MYCROFT HAVEN'T FOUND?*
Sherlock had risen and had gone to John and had kissed him, “I know, and I would gladly have given my life again....for you, so you could live after having been shot. Even if that pill from that cabbie wouldn't have killed me, I would have died so many other times, if you hadn't been there....”
(I have invented that the words about the Eastwind was originally said, not by ACD's Sherlock Holmes, but by a politician, Neville Chamberlain and predicting WW2)
Mycroft nodded, “Partly.....and from the moment I realised, that I still owed you. Sometimes I'm just as much an idiot as my brother....but please don't tell him.....regarding human behaviour. I can analyse it and use it, but not always understand it...not emotionally. That is why I sometimes find people's actions to be so...illogical and stupid. I think the scientists at Baskerville did forget something, when they fiddled with our genes.”
Sherlock wondered if Rosie would accept him, because after all they had not seen each other for a long time, not since Mary got shot and John had refused to see Sherlock for several months. Long enough for Rosie to have forgotten Sherlock. She had been happy enough to see him the day before though.
“A murderer...yes. As are you...and me. As are a lot of other persons. Including our sweet not-your-housekeeper-Mrs-Hudson. She once killed one of Frank's enemies, because he threatened to shoot both of them. She is rather fierce with a frying pan.”
Mycroft looked up at John again, “I'm not talking about the physical aspect. I manage in that area. I am a man and I have urges after all. But I can never allow myself to love that deeply again.”
John smirked.
Sherlock looked up with a frown: “Oh God... no!!! No....but I’m a masochist....I need the pain to soothe my mind sometimes. I need the submission to shut down my overworking brain, when it just goes on and on and on and I can’t stop deducing, noticing. I can’t even get a proper orgasm without some amount of pain...I’m a freak!”
Already after the third blow, Sherlock felt that his mind stilled a bit and narrowed down to 'hurt!'...'pain!' and the wild thoughts that he had fought so hard to control finally faded. But...only faded. They didn't disappear.
John started laughing, and Sherlock heard some footsteps together with the tap tap of an umbrella and then Mycroft’s voice: “Oh you pathetic little slut. Threatening with your big brother....like in a school-yard. Pathetic!! I too have had enough of you, Sherlock: all your peculiarities - your addictions - your bad modes. You have never grown up! Have always been a spoiled child....and a burden to us all. Just you continue, John. I’ll find a chair and enjoy the view....just like in Serbia!”
Sherlock smiled at his brother, “You did beat me there. I killed myself before I reached your age.”
It was chaotic for a while and then the African women showed their strength and their compassion. They could have continued to look at their differences. After all they were from different countries and spoke different languages, there were great differences in wealth and education, and some of them were even white, but they began working together together with the young survivors from those para-military groups and slowly, gradually an united African Union emerged from the ashes of the roaring fire, that the disease and the 'war' had been. And as a lot of people had said for a long time: Africa was a rich continent with wast resources and able to sustain its own population with ease, as long as international companies and corrupt leaders didn't suck every drop of life-blood out of it. But the rest of the world didn't know about the struggle and didn't care. They were buried too deeply in their own problems.
*I DO! DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT ON THE PHONE?*
Mycroft had explained that a lot of the leaders of the world would meet there and that it was staged by the UN.
Sussex, East Dean, April 5
Sherlock didn't know for sure, but he believed that John would still wake up early, even having lived with Mary and being out of the army for such a long time. John had still had that habit living with Sherlock so many years ago. But now they hadn't slept in the same room for years...except recently. And that had been so different, because of the emotional turmoil.
“You are aware of the risks, so I'm not going to talk about that. I've seen that you have chosen the jewellery carefully and everything is there in the packages to ensure utmost sterility. So...I have no doubt that you are sure about that. And by the way: I've 'ruined' 3 of your 'natural looking' dildos' in order to rehearse. The question is: why me? Why not call a professional piercer and pay him enough for privacy?”
And John giggled even more: “You said it yourself, Mycroft. “A firm grip around my balls” and now “my hands tied behind my back”......pain and bondage! I didn’t know that Anthea would do that kind of thing!!!”
He felt a strong hand gripping his shoulders.....Sherlock had moved with his usual swiftness and was kneeling behind John on his bed.....and with his strong hands on John’s upper arms: “Don’t you dare to run away...again...John Watson! You wanted to know......and I’m so tired of my and your refusal of “seeing the elephant in the room”. Now is just a good time as ever.....you said that you would listen.....and goddammit, John. You are going to listen now!”
“But I need Greg and John here in England.“, protested Mycroft.
Sherlock smiled, “Well there is only one way to find out, isn't there. A leap out into the unknown.”
John looked at Mycroft, “I'm sorry. Not my business. But I can understand your...meddling, your watching-Sherlock's-every-step, your concern. You were not allowed to be a child for long. I should have seen it for what it was...”
*OH...I SEE. IMPRESSING IF YOU CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT THAT MY BROTHER CAN’T. BUT I STILL CANT’ SEE ANY REASON TO RETURN!*
“John...for God's sake. I have lived on the streets, looking like I did, in my twenties. How did you think I managed to earn money for my drugs?”
John frowned and looked at Sherlock, “What opportunity?”
Sherlock didn’t even dare to breathe.
“A gut-feeling, then?” had Sherlock wanted to know.
John nodded, “Continue, please..”
“Would I do that, if it was pee? We have established that your late husband was an idiot, Elizabeth. An idiot who couldn't recognize female ejaculation.” and he bowed down and began to lick her again. Gently, because he knew she would be sensitive.
It had happened in the corridor leading up to one of the big assembly halls. A gas-attack and a lot of people screaming and Mycroft and Sherlock had, despite their combat-skills, been drugged by the gas as well and had lost consciousness. And when they awoke, they were cuffed with duct-tape and blindfolded and in a moving car and even Sherlock's amazing sense of direction didn't get a grasp on there whereabouts.
Hamish left school and began at University and Rosie left the school 2 years later to attend the same University. She was one of the youngest to attend ever. Only 16. Hamish wanted to study medicine and so did Rosie, but they studied two different areas. Hamish studied genetics, most of all how to cure defects in the genome and Rosie was more interested in fighting diseases directly with advanced medicine. And sometimes their areas would meet when investigations were made about how to strengthen the human immune system.
John had then kissed him and laughed too and they had almost “vanilla” sex afterwards. Slow and caring, and without restraints and nearly without pain for Sherlock. Sherlock still found it difficult to “tip over the edge” without a hint of pain though. But John teasing, licking and biting a bit too hard on his nipples would be enough to get him there.
______________________
John smiled again and said, “So are you now.” And he turned Sherlock around so he could see the old white-haired man sitting in the chair with a smile on his face, “You just leave your body behind and then you are not old anymore!”
John had shaken his head, “No...not 'nightmares'. I know how nightmares are. This was different and I don't know if my memories should have been deleted and they weren't deleted totally by mistake, but this is real memories, Sherlock, the real stuff. You were cold and stiff and dead.....and Mycroft's leg was......” John shuddered, “ Mycroft's leg did smell. So did the cellar-room. Of blood and.....”
And John didn't need more encouragement than that. Seeing Sherlock in all his glorious nakedness and spread out for him like that. It took all John's willpower not to come on the spot.
And right there John did the bravest thing he had ever done: he spoke the truth, “Because I love you. Have done that since we met. I chose Mary because I didn't dare to hope that I could have you. That you didn't feel that way. I've been so blind and I haven't seen your love. Can you forgive me?”
“That I'm a dangerous man?” answered John a bit worried and a bit confused.
“No she is perfectly fine. I think that Mycroft wanted just a small revenge for her remark: 'get our of my house, you reptile'. They have sorted their....disagreement...out by now. Especially because Mycroft is paying for everything made and mended here in Baker Street.”
___________________
Sherlock didn't want to bring forward the subject because he didn't want to scare John away. If he could have John as a friend again, he wouldn't, couldn't...ought not to ask for...and didn't deserve... more than that.
“Couldn’t be better” said John and kissed Sherlock’s back a place he could find, without scars or bandages.
“Dear Fraülein Heisst
“Oh dearest. No...gender is irrelevant. It only means something on your lower level. God doesn't have a specific gender, even if you prefer to use 'Him'. And I don't either.....”
John rubbed his neck and smiled, “Yeah...I suppose I did..” and rose.
“But it had a purpose. Just like our cruel prank. But that is Mycroft's story to tell. He knows it better than me. The 'why'.....”
John and Mycroft met one more time before the Royal Pardon was launched. This time Mycroft invited to dinner at his house. Andrea would be present too. John had laughed at bit as Mycroft had told that Andrea didn’t officially live there and had asked if there was secret passages between her official apartment in the other street close by and Mycroft’s bedroom and Mycroft had just smiled and said “something like that, yes”.
Sherlock smirked and looked up at John: “Of course!”
Sherlock rose, elegantly as ever. If he was in pain from the riding crop and his abused nipples, it didn’t show on his face or in his bearing. He turned his back to Mycroft, reached down and loosened his pyjama bottoms, letting them fall to the floor before he opened his dressing gown and letting it fall too.
But he told of course only about the un-classified ones and told a lot about John’s bravery.
Now with Beta and Britt-picker. Awesome "NumberThirteen" has offered to help. So now all the errors are no longer mine (*giggle*) ;-)
John entered the bedroom. He had only been lost in memories for a few seconds and then he stopped and looked at his incredible handsome husband, who obediently was kneeling on the mat beside their bed. Once again John had the thought that Sherlock never should be allowed to wear clothes. His body was a work of art. Long lithe and yet muscular legs, a muscular and lush arse, slim waist and broad shoulders. There was no question about Sherlock being a man one hundred percent, but it was a very....well it was as if the word 'handsome' wasn't good enough....so 'a very beautiful' body would be a more correct description. Like an elegant and strong horse: all elegant fluid movements and hidden strength. Sherlock was a Greek God in living flesh. Michelangelo's marble David made of flesh and blood and right now this incredible handsome husband of his was kneeling on the mat in front of the bed. On the bed was the remaining weighted leather-manacle. Sherlock had attached the two around his ankles and the one around the left wrist. It was the way they did it: John was supposed to put the last one on Sherlock. To show that he would take care of Sherlock and to make Sherlock enter the state of mind, he needed. And on the bed was both the cane and the riding crop.
John tried to smile to lighten the mood: “Who killed me this time?”
They looked at each other and then Sherlock closed his eyes, “I did remember enough to want revenge. But not until a few years after. I was 15 at that time. Mycroft was away and Sherrinford had been visiting and had been to town and was drunk, as he returned. It wasn't me who started the fire, but I didn't try to get back into the house to save Sherrinford, as I discovered the fire. I saved my violin and did hide in the garden-shed, where they found me. For a long time, they thought that I had started the fire and father and mummy refused to talk to me. I was 'high', when they found me. Not my doing, someone had drugged me. And I was sent to a rehabilitation-centre. I now know who put the house on fire and actually killed Sherrinford, but I can't prove it was Culverton. But Sherrinford had refused to follow their plans...I knew that much. I had heard him and Mycroft argue. Not that much of it made sense. But very little made sense in those days...so why not a strange argument between my brothers?”
John stopped at squinted at Mycroft before he said, “You and your blasted secret cameras!”
Sherlock tried to say something, but discovered that he couldn't. His mouth opened, but not a single sound came out. Why was his mouth so dry?
“It was.” Marianne said, “Thank god Molly has always been jealous of you, John, and you two have seldom interacted. Molly had come to close to 'Mary' and we didn't dare to let her in on the secret. The vitals and all the test-results were falsified by me. I've double-checked and triple-checked everything that went into Sherlock's veins. I've monitored his kidneys and liver to make sure that they were unharmed by the poison and the drugs and the real results kept getting better and better. You are not out of the danger-zone yet, Sherlock, but you will recover...”
Sherlock was against the armrest and John was lying between Sherlock’s legs resting against Sherlock’s body.
And at an agora....somehow looking like an old Roman place, with pillars of marble and tiles of marble too, some people were standing, looking towards John and Sherlock and they were greeted by them all: Greg, Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson. Sherlock's parents, Eurus and Lady Elizabeth amongst others.
*FORGIVEN. COME BACK TO LONDON, SHERLOCK, I MISS YOU!*
He felt something at his arse-hole and as he looked down, he noticed that Elizabeth was wearing long black rubber gloves, instead of the leather versions she had on before. He closed his eyes again and did let the sensation wash over him as she put one finger and then two fingers inside him. The stretch...the slight burn. It was heaven, because he knew she wouldn't hurt him. Not tear him.
John did put on the nitrile-gloves and covered Sherlock's very erect cock with the antiseptic gel and then he began to ease one of the sounds down Sherlock's urethra.
“But Eurus told us at Sherrinford...”
....and it was first as Mycroft said that, that Lady Smallwood discovered that her cheeks were wet.
And John smiled even more, “Dead..yes. But still present. I heard you. Come!”
But every time I tried to kill myself, or at least to numb myself with drugs, Mycroft got deeply worried, because that knowledge would die together with me. Sherrinford had raped my body...and Mycroft abused my mind!”
Now lady Smallwood laughed, “So that is the reason behind your eternal banter...I see. A disguise..”
http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9104/19779505.45/0_c33e9_90364c03_orig
Mycroft smiled back. “Exactly. Once a month maybe?”
He turned towards Mycroft, “And now we just need to figure out how much we can reveal, so they want to keep us alive and not killing us right away, because we were the wrong persons.”
As John descended the train in London, he spotted an ominous figure standing on the platform. Not that the person itself was scarring, but his presence was! That he had found out that John was on that train and which time he would arrive in London just showed how much power Mycroft had. But not enough power to safe Sherlock!
“To have to wait until the grown-up has decided that it is enough, is rather cruel.....even more cruel than a spanking. Because as soon as the punishment is delivered, you are forgiven. That is the point. Just like being a Catholic.”
“Wouldn't the fact that she is.....oh I hate that word....but that she is a 'mulatto'....had given that away?", wanted John to know.
“Everything I've seen and noticed, even subconsciously, is stored with my mnemonic technique, in my Mind-palace. And Mycroft was of course right when he said...on the plane....that I couldn't use my Mind-palace the way you thought I did, John. Because the next part, where I process everything that I've noticed and stored, is not 'being in my 'Mind-palace', but is being in a sort of trance. I can be in it for hours...yeah even days under extreme circumstances. I don't need food or water. My bodily processes are slowed down, but my brain is extremely active...”
“Just my words.”, said Sherlock.
John laughed, “No...I believe you. And thank you, Mycroft, for reminding me. I just tend to forget that Sherlock is fully capable of defending himself. Even against me. Maybe it is because I'm tired to...”
John looked at Mycroft, “Squires. I see. So why the bloody hell did Sherlock need a flatmate and I needed to get a job to earn money?”
Sherlock took a deep breath, “I was so scared that I would have been too slow and would have arrived to find your dead body...”
John just shook his head and covered his eyes with his hand and almost whispered, “Sherlock. You are such a wonderful person...how can I ever be worthy of your friendship? I.....such an old grumpy, dangerous, alcoholic and broken soldier?”
John remembered the things he'd told Mary back when he had just met her and they'd thought Sherlock was dead and John had told about Sherlock. It had been a long list of Sherlock's flaws and failures. Sherlock's inability to feel the pain of others, and his total disregard for John's feelings. Because seeing Sherlock like that had helped John coping. But none of it was true. John knew that now. Mary must have known that too.
The wedding was celebrated the next summer after John and Sherlock lived together in Baker Street again. Rosie, who now was a bit more than two and a half years old, was bridesmaid and Hamish was the 'ring-bearer'. Hamish was often at Baker Street, even if he regarded Mycroft a bit more as a father, than he did Sherlock. Mycroft had at that time adopted Hamish, so he was now legally Mycroft's heir. Hamish knew of course the Sherlock was his biological father.....and he had sometimes said, with a smirk that was so much Sherlock, that he would have trouble 'stepping out of the line' and do something foolish and 'teenage-like' when he got old enough, because he had too many intelligent parents.
And finally John carefully kissed the most prominent of the scars from Serbia....the one on Sherlock’s right shoulder.
John took off his shirt. It was too much in its way and he lifted his dog-tags over his head and gave them to Sherlock, “Hold on to them and imagine that you are tethered to the sofa. Don't move!”
Sherlock said a bit stuttering: “I....I....have always felt awkward....different.....and I can understand peoples motives and can read a lot about them in the way they dress, speak, act.....but I have never truly understood the
(to be continued)
Mycroft shook his head, “No....only a month.”
And then Sherlock reached his own journal in the bunch of papers and read snippets here and there:
“Because you were David, but a better version” Sherlock answered: “A bit older but just as good looking. Just a bit shorter and just a dangerous, but more caring and loving. The best of David with the best of John Watson added. She couldn’t have had a better father for her child.”
“Mycroft, this was intended as a gift for you in the morning. But I'll give it to you now. I know than when your need for submission is the most urgent, you have difficulties finding the words to ask for it. Now you don't have to ask. You just put this collar around your neck, and I'll know what you are asking for. Will you accept this, Love.... my beloved husband?”
And of course Sherlock had no pants on and John moaned even more as he saw that Sherlock was shaved, except from a little amount of well groomed hair above his cock. John first pinned Sherlock down, holding Sherlock's wrists together with one hand and caressing Sherlock's body with the other, mostly Sherlock's nipples in turn and then John did let his hand travel down Sherlock's flat stomach, towards Sherlock's cock. Sherlock was breathing heavily now and his eyes kept looking at John, who didn't let his eyes leave Sherlock's. Marvelling at how aroused Sherlock looked.
And as he came to his senses, Elisabeth told him that it had been a 'dry' orgasm. A prostate orgasm and she continued to milk him like that three times. It was like climbing a mountain, getting higher and higher up and.........and then she turned the butt-plug up on the highest setting and as Mycroft almost arched of the couch, she took a firm grip around the chain between the nipple-clamps and tore it of his nipples......and Mycroft came and came. The world turned white and he lost every track of time and existence.....
“That is it, Sherlock. Don't slip back under again, Love. Stay...for me? Please?”, said John.
Mycroft shook his head, “I..managed to live through my private version of a hellish nightmare by following those advises and I found it necessary to teach Sherlock this. So he would be able to control his feelings better. He was a very emotional child and......and I didn't want to loose him to 'the madness' too. He had to learn to control his feelings or he...he might end up as Eurus. It was even the professional advises we got from the doctors. So yes, as I had taught myself, I taught Sherlock to shield himself. To detach himself from his feelings. To appear cold and aloof....”
Greg smiled a genuine smiled, “What do you think of football?”
John gave him a fierce hug, “And then I was just such an arse, because I was drugged...and you were the most amazing and self-sacrificing friend that I....Oh God, Sherlock...we have been so close to loosing each other. And I still don't deserve that you forgave me like that. You are such an extraordinary human being, Sherlock. Oh God...I love you so much!”
“Oh..”, said Sherlock, “He invented the Zombies?!”
John did drink some more tea and then he looked at Mycroft and said, “You do not mind that I proposed and he said yes?”
Sherlock had opened the bedroom window, with the fly-veil secured in front of the window. Even if the bedroom faced north and was shadowed by big trees, it could get warm. He had washed John and given him his nicest suit on. Not with ease...he had to cut it with a pair of scissors a few places and didn't bother with clean underwear. it was clean enough as it was. He had placed John on his back, closed his eyes and had fetched some flowers in the garden and had placed them in John's hands....and had said, “You...John Hamish Watson-Holmes. You wait for me on the other side. I'll be there in a few hours. So wait for me.” Hoping that it was the truth...that there was an after-life. And that he wouldn't be punished for killing himself.
John kept his eyes closed and leaned his head back on the back-rest of the chair. How was he supposed to confess his bi-sexuality and his deep love for Sherlock now? Such a fine love......showed to the subject of that love through abuse and violence....
And now Sherlock looked at John and smirked, “It is what it is!”
Mycroft looked at John again: “I’ll not conceal this for you John, not this time. But people close to me are working against me. They have...if I may use one of your expressions...”a firm grip around my balls”. It is like a hostile take-over and I fear what they might do to Great Britain if they succeed. Sherlock unfortunately gave them ammunition against me as he shot Magnussen. I couldn’t do anything....or at least not much....to prevent him from either going to prison or sent in exile to investigate even more in this case. People wanted my brother either dead or away from England or made unable to work.....”
Finally Sherlock felt that he could open his eyes. His vision was blurred, but he could hear John's voice very clear now and see a dark figure against some light.
“And Sherrinford. If he was here in this moment?”, wanted John to know.
“Yeah...I know. He could almost pass for a human being now.”, smirked Sherlock.
It took him almost an hour and then he found Mycroft in his study.
Sherlock looked in horror at John as he continued, “Rosie got very ill. And I thought it was my fault and I came to your new house almost only in my dressing gown, because I wanted to save her.....”
John did lean back on his arms....not giving a damn if his shoulder would hurt later, slipping into his role again: “Well, private....as you see, your superior do have a problem. Take care of it in an orderly manner, private! If I’m satisfied you’ll get rewarded...if not, you’ll be punished!”
Sherlock was now sitting on the couch besides John with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. His hands ruffling through his hair....and he looked a moment bewildered at his left hand as he felt moisture on it and saw the blood. He had re-opened his wound on his head. When he saw that it wasn’t that much he just shrug his shoulders....and John decided not to interfere.....it was not the right moment. So he waited.
He turned towards the young doctor, “Pack your necessities and come with me...to Scotland. We have room for a lot of people. And we have jobs and houses. Not for the whole village, but most certainly for my father's closest friends.”
Then Sherlock ended the embrace and said with a smirk,” I’m afraid that the pasta is a bit on the too soft side now, John.”
And that small spark of improper humour considering the place and the circumstances actually helped John to cope.
Sherlock nodded, “Most of it..”
Mycroft admitted that it had taken him some time to figure out, that the way Sherlock had been treated, had been so morally wrong.
Mycroft swallowed and nodded and then he said, “I have...toys so you wouldn't need a cane. It is tissue-damage and....”
“Don't you want it to be over? Did you like what I did to you?”
And John cried a bit and kissed Sherlock, even if his lip had a split and he was a bit bruised and battered.
That year, year 2025, had started all right. And then in March, shortly after Rosie's 10
“You think it is going to be that bad?”
“What?!”
“Deduce...use a bit of your brain-activity to deduce about this room.”, said Mycroft, as he switched on the light.
After they both had orgasmed...almost simultaneously, they were lying on the couch under the blanket again. Mycroft on his back, because he was fine and the pain not that bad, and Elizabeth with her head on his shoulder.
Hamish was standing next to the doctor as the priest performed the rituals. And a lot of other people were there too. Surprisingly many. Hamish had feared that it would have been a lonely affair to say good-bye to his father and his husband. But of course those two old men had made a lot of friends. Especially the priest and the doctor....and the police-constable, who now was DI. The doctor and the priest were the grandsons of the old doctor and the old priest and had just sort of inherited the friendship that their grandfathers had made, as John and Sherlock moved to the village.
Mycroft paused and rose and fetched an envelope, but didn't give it to Greg yet, as he continued, “Sometimes....if the children are not that old, when they are found on the streets or brought to the foster-homes, they get adopted. Just the boys...very seldom the girls, because unfortunately the Indian culture favourites boys. And one thing more: they favourite fair skin. That makes it even less understandable why Eshan and Rohan never got adopted.”
“Oh God. Your wicked mouth!”, moaned John and he continued, breathless, “It should be labelled 'dangerous' and I...Oh God....thought that I......oh sweet Jesus....should be be the one that delivered!”
Mycroft had nodded, “I know. And he paid a terrible price for that...” And then he had continued, “But I need you there. To observe.....”
Turned to Sherlock, John asked “Love, show Mycroft your back. I think he was busy getting over here and didn’t watch what we were doing before.”
Elizabeth turned the butt-plug off, but did let it remain inside Mycroft and she pushed it a bit.
After they had eaten a light meal and Elizabeth made sure that Mycroft got a lot of protein, they slept on the couch. It was soft enough and big enough.
John and Sherlock were sitting in a room together with those 4 people and they told...in turn...what they used to do to Sherlock. How he would respond and what he liked the most. They had actually brought the spreadsheet with them and handed it to John. And he made small notes and asked questions as well.
Sherlock came out from the bedroom and stood leaned against the door-frame....looking like someone from a fashion-magazine: “Past tense....He
And John just remained in charge as he continued to suck and lick and tease Sherlock's cock whilst he was pinning Sherlock down with his strength, lying halfway over Sherlock's body.
Not that John forced real meals into Sherlock, but he gave him sweetened tea, nutrition drinks and always put some easily-eaten bits of food beside Sherlock, when he was working on the computer or reading a book or papers. It would be too much of a risk to put it beside Sherlock when he was working on his experiments!
He paused and studied her face, “You are interested in having sex with me. You do not only want my obedience and submission, You want
“But I’m not a woman...”said Sherlock.
Sherlock just looked at John....his eyes so sad and then he whispered: “Am I really that awful, John?”
Hamish was sitting, looking at the phone's empty and black screen as Rosie returned from her visit in the village. She just did cast one glance at him and just said, “Sherlock?”
“Exactly!”
Harry, now 2 years sober and in relationship with Clara again, delivered the 'Best man's speech'. Not as long as Sherlock's speech at Mary's and John's marriage and not preventing a murder whilst doing it. But beautiful made and spoken. And Sherlock's and Mycroft's father held another speech. Not long, but from the depth of his heart, expressing how proud he was of the fine husbands his sons had found to share their life with. Something that both he and his wife sort of had lost hope about ever happening.
John found it impossible to stay in his (and Mary’s) flat. He had gone there....been driven there in Mycroft’s car which had been waiting outside when John had fetched a few necessities late that night after he had been to the mortuary to say goodbye to Mina. John wouldn’t get his bag back before it had been cleared of contamination. He had just concentrated on his own things in the bedroom and the bathroom and somehow managed not to see Mina’s things. And he had found Mary’s proof of Magnussen’s price on Sherlock’s head..... printed out and on a USB-pen. Both items lying on the desk besides John’s laptop in the living-room. John gave up understanding how Mary on one hand would have revealed the proof that could help Sherlock and on the other hand had tried to kill Sherlock with that contaminated book.
Greg frowned, “But here...in England..away from their own culture and country and language?”
Sherlock smiled, “You didn't lie, when you said that you knew a bit. So...I would go to my bed-room, even if you were in the flat. As I did, when I had that frenzy, when you tried to make me stop smoking....”
“Do you have any proof that Magnussen hired you?!”
Currently, John was dearly needed at the clinic, since apparently every child in London - or at least in the clinic’s catchment area - had decided to get a nasty cough. And the adults had chosen to get the flu. Which is why John slowly walked up the seventeen steps to their flat one evening, two months into their new relationship, to find Sherlock in his chair, reading a newspaper, and John’s collar ready for him on the table.
“I did. I’ve done it for 8 years..... since we got married. But you are the first of all my guests that have noticed!”
Oh my. I had forgotten about this book. Or rather...I had thought it to be lost. I'll just write a brief update about what have happened the last nine years. If anyone is actually going to read these ramblings of mine.
“It’s OK. I would have said the same thing. Now....be a good girl and say to the doctors, who are waiting, that they can continue the operations. I would so much like to have you back in our apartment...or a new place.... as soon as possible..”
John shuddered: “Do not even mention it!!! And thank you Mycroft.....I thought that “sentiment” wasn’t your area....and yet you are here....comforting me....instead of ruling England!”
The next morning while they were eating breakfast, Sherlock pushed an envelope towards John.
But then he came back with a little frown: “I mean...if it is OK with you, John?”
And then the young man laughed, “....but I'll let you buy anything in this shop for free, if there isn't a very fit and strong body concealed under that exquisite 3-piece suit.”
Already the first day, as Sherlock woke up again, John had explained more about what had happened that evening the 10
_____________________
They hated when they had to be away from each other and neither of them slept well when the other person was not sleeping beside them. And during the sleep one part of their body would always touch the other person: a hand on the other one’s chest, curled around each other as the big spoon and small spoon or just the hands touching.
“Whom?”
USA had taken some time to recover from Trump, then recover from Pence and then recover from the next fatal president Hamilton, and then president Smith, so not until the year 2028 did USA find its feet again and did participate seriously in foreign politics. As it turned out it was a bit too late. Russia had 'suffered' under Putin's 'iron fist' and his successor Bylinkin's similar inability to accept public rights until 2025, and at that point other countries had tried to seize world-power in the absence of the two biggest actors on the world-stage. Germany and France had proven themselves surprisingly strong, together with the European Union, and together with Australia, India, Thailand and Japan they had become the new big voices in the world.
But John did read it for what it was: a move in a “game of chess”...or in a game of “who would acknowledge the elephant in the room first?”
John lifted his hand as Sherlock was gong to say something, “On the other hand, Sherlock. The dark side inside me is saying,
“Now you are trying to be an idiot on purpose, John. Because there is this darkness in Sherlock as well. You two do fit together. Both seeing the battlefield, where others see peaceful London. You have killed in cold blood. So have Sherlock, and I. And we have paid a price for it...and would do it again if it would be necessary.”
“How are you, Sherlock?”, asked Mary, sitting at a chair beside Sherlock's bed, actually holding his hand.
John glanced at a corner of the bathroom, wondering if Mycroft was watching the live feed. Both John and Sherlock knew where Mycroft’s cameras were and they were good sports, considerate of Mycroft, so they seldom blocked the cameras’ view. They knew when Mycroft had appreciated something he had seen, because a hamper of delicacies from Fortnum & Mason’s would be delivered to 221B Baker Street shortly after. John was a bit disturbed by the thought of Mycroft watching them, but he would push it away… Mycroft’s behaviour wasn’t really any more peculiar than some of Sherlock’s actions. Sometimes John wondered if the Holmes brothers were another species. Aliens maybe? Just like in the TV-show ‘Mr Bean’. Had they arrived like Mr. Bean, beamed down from a space-ship?
He was...if possible...even better than both his father and uncle to deduce and read people.
And life continued: Rosie attended the same school as Hamish when she was 9. She had impatiently awaited until she would be old enough. She had visited the school so often and it was so inspiring and giving and even if she would be one of the youngest, she would in no way be the less intelligent. She would finally be able to 'stretch her wings' and use her full potential, being at that school . And John and Sherlock could see how she enjoyed her stay and Hamish could report that Rosie had shown no signs of homesickness.
Mycroft nodded, “Well. Being in diplomacy does require acting skill-sets as well. As does being a detective. So...did that explain your question? And would you allow me to tell more about the reasons for the events on that fake island?”
“Shhhh” said John, caressing Sherlock’ hand: “You are safe....in London. I’m here....easy now!”
John was driven out of his thoughts as Sherlock...well...actually ordered: “The butt-plug, John!”
The appearance came closer and sat down on the floor beside John and the dead Sherlock, and said, “Do not exist', you say! I did last time, I looked in a mirror!”
“Because I love you too, you git!”
Sherlock looked at their intertwined hands......yes his hand was a young man’s hand too. Just like John’s. Sherlock’ brow furrowed in confusion when he looked at John again, “Weren’t you wearing fatigues and a T-shirt just a moment ago?” he asked.
John took Sherlock's hands and looked at him and said, “Do you know what 'rimming' means...and I am not talking about a way of conserving food.”
Sherlock's voice was barely more than a whisper, “I'm so cold, Myke....Will you tell Hamish and Rosie and …...John that I tried to...... come back to them? I love them so much......and I tried.....I love you too.....
________________________
John shook his head, “No...not that. After Irene drugged you. Remember I was the one who put you to bed. And then at the four occasions, where we had to share a bed, whilst we were on cases. Sherlock...I'm a doctor. I was a doctor in a war-zone, where soldiers sometimes were abducted and...raped...repeatedly. And some of your reactions reminds me of their reactions...”
Mycroft turned to explain: “Only “country squires”......and our Estate is now a hotel. Father has never lived there and we never use our title. Why should we? We only inherited the title and not a vast sum of money. Both father and mummy have earned their own money....if they hadn’t worked in a proper job, there wouldn’t have been any money left. We pay taxes as well. And the only reason why I am in the procession of a quite a nice sum of money, is because I have invested that small sum I inherited from Grandma wisely. I know we had the privilege of not starting totally at the bottom, and of proper education...even private teachers. But all of that was based on earnestly earned money from a job and not some inherited privilege.”
John blushed as he thought of Sherlock in only a sheet at Buckingham palace so many years ago: “Oh my God.....she knew?”
John only managed to stutter: “Trip....Scotland?!” and finally he found his voice: “No....I only thought that I would be going somewhere here in London?”
“Oh John...that was...that was intense. The most intense orgasm I've had for a long time!”, said Sherlock breathlessly.
“Oh God, no...Do you find my scar repulsive?”
“Mycroft! You didn’t....did you?!”
The End
John smiled again and said, “So are you now.” And he turned Sherlock around so he could see the old white-haired man lying in the bed next to a grey-haired John.
Sherlock looked a bit embarrassed, “Well, uhm, yes...I did, but I think that I've apologized a lot of times for that, haven't I?”
John could only shake his head. Sherlock was amazing, he truly was, “So that is why you can forgive Mycroft...and your parents...and me?”
Sherlock had just watched John and said, “Enough about me. I had promised you to listen. So that is what I do...listen. So go on..”
Sherlock took a sip, “I am 'coping-mechanism-ning' too. Better for my kidneys than drugs. I think my liver is a bit more resilient than the kidneys for now. And I've picked up meditation again....and exercising. I run every morning in Regent's....But this is not about me. You said that you had come to say 'I'm sorry' to me. There is no need for that. I can perfectly understand....”
(to be continued)
Mycroft took a deep breath, “Sherlock managed to stop the bomb about 20 seconds before it would have exploded. When Sherlock discovered the empty wagon, well, empty besides several hundreds of kilos of hidden explosives...and a bomb, there was not even time enough for him or John to escape. Sherlock later told me that he didn't even know if the bomb had been a booby-trap and if it would have exploded, as he tried to switch it off.”
Here is the story about that:
And then Sherlock told how he had climbed out of his bed, made that set-up with Leinster Garden and how he had made John and Mary talk. And how he had been in pain the whole time and had lost consciousness and how the paramedics had restarted his heart.
John closed his eyes and swallowed; “You accepted that I did beat you into a pulp...and abandoned you.“
John had listened astonished to Mycroft words and now he interrupted: “You...you are aristocracy?!”
____________________
And Sherlock turned his head back and looked at John and John kissed each of Sherlock's fingers.
“And as I said....”nothing compared to you”....you, Sherlock is all I want.....All I’ve ever wanted. I was just stupid enough not to know. Yes she is a woman...and quite good looking. But she isn’t half as good looking as you and she is not half as clever. I love all of you, Sherlock. You could even look a bit more like Mycroft...and I would still love you! I love your body....and your incredible mind....all of you!!! Your bravery...your big heart.....and your scars....because they show what an incredible man you are! I love you!!!” And John had kissed Sherlock more than 10 times on different parts of Sherlock’s face and neck as he spoke.
John shivered and hugged Sherlock even firmer, as he continued,  “She never would have understood....that even if I was so incredible angry with you. Even if she had drugged me into almost hating you.......I never really did. Not deep down. And if I had......
And right there Greg got a bit distracted, because having sex with Mycroft was exceptionally good and last night had been extraordinary and Greg felt the first tendril of arousal and looked at Mycroft who had just continued, “....And if you could get your brain back on track again and listen to me? Then the statistic would......Oh God why am I even saying this, because of course I'm not pregnant. Don't look at me like that, Greg. Or I might never get this said and I'm afraid that you are going to be mad at me...”
John rose, “You don't remember much, do you?”
“What the heck!?”, said John.
John had tears of laughter in his eyes now and could barely talk: “Oh God, Sherlock....I....I just imagined which word would make us both stop immediately.....and it is so inappropriate!”
And then Sherlock said something that even surprised himself: “You may ask now...and.....and I do not mind if you want to touch......”
___________________________
“What?”
Now Mycroft looked at John and said: “You don’t have to. Mary didn’t think of the consequences when she agreed on Mina being used as a donor...”.....his voice faded.....
But that implied that they had hurt, not only as fresh wounds, but as scars too. And John knew all to well how such scar tissue could be too sensitive to touch and be hurting even after they had healed, because of the nerve-damage.
Mycroft had put his paper down and had said, “This is close to unacceptable. Having so little time together...” and then he had paused and looked at Greg and asked, “What would you say to become a father?”
“I do...Remember that my cousins are 'The British Government' and even if it is difficult getting information through by now, it is beginning: in Asia, in Eastern Europe, in North America and South America. The 'encounters' are increasing to a level I would call 'war'.......and we just get the news about 10 percent of what is really happening out there.”
As he returned with the generously filled glass, he pointed at it and said, “Terrible coping-mechanism. But better than drugs...”
“Who would care?!!”, Sherlock almost shouted, being a bit surprised himself how violently he reacted.
Sherlock looked at John and said in a low voice: “To repeat your words: “nothing compared to you”...I too love all of you. Your mind too. Your mind that is my guardian light....You keep me right in a way those persons would never be able to. I love the dualism in you.....your kindness...and the danger in you too!”
Sherlock had continued: “I should never have returned......And I should never have tried to pick up my old life again. Not to realise that you had moved on and managed fine without me, was a big mistake. My apologies for ruining your dinner with Mary!”
“...is a garage with a lot of exiting chemicals......and now I just need a way to heat things.”
John had turned around to turn off the water and as he left the stall, he saw Sherlock kneeling on the bathroom floor on the mat and several towels...obedient and just waiting.....and oh God how it went into John’s cock immediately. What he wanted to do to Sherlock when he was positioned like that...and had healed! John wasn’t sure that he actually liked that side of himself....being sadistic and dominating....but frankly....he didn’t give a damn right now!!
John took a large mouthful and the tea was perfect. John smiled at Sherlock, who had returned to the kitchen, “Who are you, gorgeous...and what have you done to my flatmate?!”, John asked.
“Yes, John” whispered Sherlock.
John nodded, “An 'angel'...I see. But why the heck do you look like me?!”
___________________________
John shook his head, “No...not to eat. But please tell me more about Sherlock's role. Molly's as well and Eurus'.”
“Oh nonsense, John. You saved him back then, even if you had been drugged up to your eyeballs by the wife of yours in order to make you hate him. And you helped him today. I could hear that. But John, he needs you. Stay here and I'll fetch Rosie. I'll just take the car-seat in your car. She loves 'Nan's red car and I can keep her downstairs as long as needed if Sherlock and you would need.....”
John smiled back, “You do know, just as well as I do, that I've inherited all the money belonging to 'Mary Morstan'...or 'Mary Watson' or whatever her real name was. Only very few words out of that woman's mouth were the truth after all. All the nice money on the, oh so discrete, Swiss bank accounts. And don't tell me that you had nothing to do with that. It would otherwise have taken years to sort it out. And the mess with my army-pension. You mended that after Sherlock.....after Sherlock had to jump. So..Sherlock could be poor as a church mouse and I would still marry him..”
In the living room Sherlock was pacing the floor. Still dressed in his coat and tugging at his hair, muttering, “Stupid...stupid. Useless...you are so utterly useless, Sherlock. Too late. Always too late! You are such a useless stupid little boy!!”
Mycroft looked her into her eyes and licked the moisture of his fingers....slowly...
“And as I said, I'm just a squire and not a lord. I could not have given you that position in society, that later brought you to our 'secret cabinet'.”
As soon as she removed it...and Mycroft gave a hiss again as the sound did slide out of his urethra, his cock began to swell. And Lady Smallwood could see that not only was Mycroft a 'shower', that is a man whose cock is impressive even in flaccid condition, but he was a 'grower' as well. As soon as his erection had appeared, Lady Smallwood could see that Mycroft Holmes possessed a rather impressive male organ. Not in the league of a John Watson, but certainly above average. And with a very nice shape. A bit curved and with that slightly 'mushroom'-shaped head that could drive both men and woman wild as they were fucked.
“May I enter, John?” asked Sherlock carefully...slipping out of the role: “I would so much like to have a shower too!”
Sherlock smiled back, “You waited!”
John looked at Mycroft, when he said that. He hadn't imagined that it was Mycroft, who had taught Sherlock to play.
*HM....”3 CONTINENTS-WATSON” WASN’T REFERRING TO HOW MANY CONTINENTS YOU HAD LIVED ON!?*
John just looked a Mycroft and had to remind himself that it was the man who had agreed on being killed by Sherlock, as Eurus had asked Sherlock to chose between Mycroft and John.
*THE FIRST 4 WORDS IN YOUR MESSAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH, JOHN. I LOVE YOU, TOO! AND I’M COMING HOME. AS SOON AS I’M ALLOWED*
“I hadn't, John. I was given the drugs on the tarmac. I was not high when you and I spoke, not at all. But Mary provided me.....”
“Yours… If I didn’t do that your brain would eat itself. Not that it isn’t nice for me to enter dom-space like I sometimes do… But it is mostly about your needs.”
And began:”... 'Jim Moriarty' was a mirage, a ghost, an idea. It would have been so utterly stupid to stand forward and show himself like he did stealing the crown-jewels and being in court...and in the media. Such a person operates from the shadows in the side-wings. Such a leader never steps forward out into the harsh lights on the stage. Never. Just sits in the middle of a web like a big fat spider. So.....'Jim Moriarty' as a person was brilliantly, I'll admit that, played by the unemployed actor Richard Brook. Richard was able to apear totally insane on a very subtle way. He even took care that he altered between using his left hand and right hand to confuse everybody. And the look on his face of utterly surprise as he shot himself, must have been because he had expected a prop and not a real gun..”
______________________________
So...with those thoughts pushed aside, Mycroft was now sitting in his bed, looking at the things he had bought.
Mycroft again tried to avoid John’s eyes and looked down on his meticulously manicured nails and then he looked up: “I deeply apologize for my mistake of underestimating you, John. Yes you are right. Moriarty was my invention...and the invention of a very few selected others. I couldn’t openly show my support to Sherlock. I would have been accused of nepotism. I would have risked my position in the government. I had no choice.....even Sherlock would have to believe that he was sent away....despite his acting abilities. I have apologised so many times, but my hands were tied. But it is in the past now. All the “bad guys” have been removed and the British government should be functioning again...as well as it can be when real politicians have to deal with the “dinosaurs” in the House of Lords!”
Sherlock waved his hand and begun, “The book 'Ender's Game' could somehow be a description of us 'Holmes-children', couldn't it?“
Sherlock continued, “Sian had been told to shoot you at the appointment after ...well after the mortuary. Mary had expected you to do something violently...to me.....and knew you would at least visit the therapist one time after...whatever happened to me......”
*YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING NEW HAD TURNED UP. DIDN’T MYCROFT TELL YOU?*
“That didn't help, did it? You still can't figure out what my gender is, can you?”
Mycroft closed his eyes, “It is only something I… Indulge in… if I feel safe.”
John reached for Sherlock's hand and gave it a squeeze, “Thank God for old jackets....”
Not to be able to see Sherlock, but just to hear him and feel him, added another layer of pleasure to the blow-job and John felt, that he was close and as he didn't want it to be over so quickly, he padded the bump on his kilt, that would be Sherlock's head and warned, “Sherlock....I'm going to...”
Afterwards Mycroft undressed and now Sherlock was the big spoon and they enjoyed a moment of peace and bliss.
Sherlock looked at John, “The mad scientist, who had made that creature, was Sir Thomas Baskerville?!”
Mycroft continued, “I was the only one who could make you speak and Mummy and father took the decision that I could be home-tutored for at least a semester or two, until you were better. Maybe it wasn't the best of ideas to make an only 7 year older cousin look after a traumatized child. But you never appeared traumatized near me. I discovered that you could read...and that you had a hunger, almost matching mine, for knowledge. So my teachers did educate you as well, as you would be sitting nearby, seemingly buried in your pirate books, but never the less listening....”
As Sherlock had pointed out, “The eldest father in the world was after all 96!”. But their physical lovemaking did of course diminish with growing age and as John's heart eventually showed signs of the throughout sepsis, that had almost killed John after Afghanistan and he needed a pace-maker, their 'lovemaking' was often just cuddling and holding hands. The urge, that at sometimes had been a roaring fire, when they finally had admitted their love for each other, did lessen down to....glowing embers.
People grew older and the eldest turned more fragile. Lady Elisabeth was the first to die. Mycroft and Greg was at the hospital, when she got the message that the doctors couldn't do more for her and she was brought 'home' to the 'Oak-Tree-Mansion' in Scotland. She died in 2040 at the impressive age of 85 years.
Sherlock smiled, “No...in Brighton. In a very low-paid job with no promotion-possibilities. He is married to a very boring woman and have no children and too much debt. Much better than the bottom of Thames.”
________________________
Then Sherlock lifted his head and said, “This is completely and utterly impossible!”
“Well...your scars have a story to tell, too....And I’m sorry for being such an arsehole, Sherlock. But......I’m here to listen now......I have never asked what happened while you were....away. I......I......”
And then they had kissed some more and actually said goodbye without using that exact word. Then they had cuddled and had fallen asleep.
_________________________________
“I'm all ears, Sherlock.”
Mycroft fell down on his knees and hugged Sherlock, “I can't help you....I will not be able to control myself....”
And as John finally wrote an SMS to Sherlock's number on his new phone (the old one was lost at Musgrave...in the well) and he got an answer back that he was welcome, but that the flat still needed some repair, John felt both anxious and relieved.
“I’m most certainly not the one to say “no””, John replied, “But I’ll have to take an enema first… and preferably not a twenty minute one! Sorry about that again. But later. Right now, I’m starving.”
Sherlock closed his eyes, “I'm not dying right now. I'm just tired. Please...let me sleep. You can come back in both of you, as soon as John returns.”
“Hmm. You smell wonderfully...and so does the food. And yes...your brother had quite a lot to tell. And he has changed...a lot.”
“Exactly....very informal. Her security-service would throw a wobbly if they were going to find out that you.......an un-cleared person would be allowed so close to the Queen, but...”
John kissed him again and said: “Yes...of course. You are brilliant!”
John was sitting in the train from Berlin to London via Calais. He was tired. His visit to the hospital, where Sherlock had been hospitalized, had been all right at first and seeing that Sherlock’s wound in his left thigh wasn’t that bad but only a soft tissue wound and Sherlock would be able to walk and run again, had been a relief. But after the first “Thank God you are alive” his continued conversation with Sherlock had not been nice.
And Sherlock continued, “Because if it is still something like 'I'm not worthy' or anything similar to that, I'm sure that we did sort that out yesterday. And the butt-plug in my arse makes me a bit...No, not 'a bit'....but rather 'a lot' aroused, turned on and 'horny' and I had hoped that my state of not being decently dressed, almost dressed in a 'dishabillé' would have stirred just a minimum of interest?”
“I had been clean for two years and had just moved away from Montague Street. I didn't use again, trust me. Not even while I was 'away'. It was too dangerous and then I didn't use....not until....”
Hamish looked at her with a frown, “I didn't know John had called?”
And John didn't mind. He carefully coated his fingers with lube and pushed them inside Sherlock's waiting hole. First one finger, moving in and out. John looked at his finger disappearing into Sherlock's body and it aroused him, thinking about another part of his anatomy filling Sherlock's hole and moving in and out. That was the best part of fucking Sherlock....seeing how he took John's cock deep into his body.....and then John added two fingers, scissoring them a bit and Sherlock moaned. And then John bend his fingers ever so slightly until he found the point. And almost conversationally John told Sherlock about the devises that could be bought to achieve the same thing.
The angel shook his head, “Or a clear decision from his side.”
I was waiting for her in our living-room. Sitting in the armchair and I just told her that you had died, just to see her reaction. That was the time where she did reach for her own gun. And I shot her right between her eyes. And then Mycroft's men came and cleaned up the mess. And I haven't been in that flat since.”
Sherlock stopped and he had tears in his eyes.
In Russia Bernhard did rule...not so much worse than Stalin and Putin had done. The difference was that it was Augments, who now had all the privileges instead of the inner circle of the Communist Party.
And smiled at each other...and kissed.
But again John surprised Sherlock as he gently touched the different scars in turn and asked: "It happened just before you returned?"........“Cigarette burns?”....Knifes?”........”A whip?”......”A cane?”......”A bludgeon?”.....To the latter the answer from Sherlock was: ”No.....a water pipe, actually.”
John turned back again and looked out in the living room and took Sherlock’s bigger hands in his own sturdier ones, “You have asked me why I wanted to keep that job at the clinic, when it is obvious that it sometimes is too bloody much. But there is a good reason...and it has nothing to do with “getting away” from you...it’s just...”
And as Sherlock tried to say something John put his finger on Sherlock’s mouth: “Schh...you are! Your looks are striking....You must have noticed that both men and women look at you more than once....and that you, if you turn up charm, can make people do a lot for you. Remember Janine?”
And the only answer was, “Shut up and just watch!”
And Sherlock had looked at John with so much love showed on his face...and John just bend down and kissed Sherlock while they were holding hands. Just a very careful and almost chaste kiss.
Mary looked at him, “You might have to get used to that. He doesn't want to live like this, John. And I can't blame him!”
birthday, Harriet was 17 then, my father lost his job and began to drink together with the other unemployed men at the local pub. My mother managed to find a job, so we coped financially, but my father was a lazy sod and never lifted a finger in the house. So there she was, my mother, working on her job, and then having to do all the work in the house as well. We children tried to help. Well mostly me, as Harriet wasn't much at home and then father would come home...drunk...and everything my mother had done would be wrong and everything I had done would be wrong too. The food was wrong, the mending of the garden, our clothes...everything. He was just looking for an excuse to be violent. To 'let out some steam'...or should we use the right words: To beat up his wife and his son, because he was a cock, an arsehole and an abuser and the only one to blame for his miserable life was anyone but him in his own eyes!”
“On one condition, “ murmured Sherlock, already on the brink of sleep again, “...and that is that you are not sleeping in the room upstairs...”
“You are loosing your ability to deduce that? I've been here long enough to eat your sandwich and read all the reports,“ was Sherlock's answer.
As they had talked they had arrived at the inn and they sat down together with the priest and the DI.
“Thanks, and the same to you, Mycroft.....Hmm: 'peach' for modesty?”
Sherlock could see how deeply he had hurt John, because there was no anger in John, just hurt.
John frowned, “You angels...or God.....you don't disapprove of two men....”
“No..and it is nice not to worry about the money, like I used to do...Sometimes lying awake in the night”, said John a bit sourly.
And then John just stopped for a moment, in order not to come on the spot. And then Sherlock begged, “Continue, John. Hard. I need you. I need to be filled with your big fat gorgeous cock.”
John nodded, “But your back...”
When she came to her senses, she looked at Mycroft. He was shivering. Obediently holding his hands up above his head. He must be thankful for the cuffs as they helped him maintain the ordered position. But she had gone too far.....she had gone lost in her own pleasure. After all, this was a punishment and not about giving the sub his pleasure and allowing him to enter sub-space. But......Mycroft was bleeding. There were places where the cropping-lines had crossed, and blood was dripping down his body. She had betrayed his trust in her....
“And then I told Mycroft that I had to shoot him. Preferably without killing him and that Andrea should make sure that he was taken away and everybody should believe, that he was dead. It would require some acting skills on Mycroft's side, but I knew he could do it...and on Andrea's side too and she surpassed my expectations and was very convincing.....”
Mycroft's mouth was dry and he moved a bit and the chain shifted....and he moaned...
Sherlock thought for a moment and then he said, “No...everything is settled and accounted for. No unfinished businesses.”
. And just give me a few seconds. I’ve got something for you too!”
“Do you want me to...”
________________________
John interrupted, “Some fine 'staying alive'. It broke me, Mycroft. Even if I didn't want to acknowledge, why it broke me so much. Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson managed all right. But I went straight back into my depression. And refused vehemently, despite Ella's effort, to see why it broke me. Incredible that I could be so blind! And that I kept on denying my love for Sherlock....and then Mary came into the picture and everything got rather muddled.”
Finally Sherlock came to his senses, “Oh dear Lord. Of course I do...it is utterly brilliant and wonderful. John...you are a genius!” and he hugged John fiercely and kissed him.
He rose, and not touching Sherlock, he said, “But you have put your collar on and now you know that I’m the one who decides. That walk cooled me down. I’m not angry anymore. And as I’ve told you before, I shouldn’t be pissed off with you when we are in a scene after we’ve had a row.”
In the daylight, where such thoughts proved themselves as stupid as they were, Rosie showed no signs of psychopathy, only signs of her high intelligence. She could read and do math before she was 4 and her mental development was far ahead of her psychical abilities and looks, which caused a lot of frustration on her side. Sherlock had been in a similar situation as a child and Mycroft too, so they had solutions.......and when Hamish visited, mostly around the big holidays in summer and around Christmas, he and Rosie enjoyed each other's company and made elaborate plays with dolls, Lego and toys. Rosie was intelligent, very intelligent, but she was a sweet and caring little girl as well.
“Well..they sort of stuck out. Three highly recommended biographies from famous politicians amongst books in the fiction-genre or poetry. They were almost “screaming”!
They had decided that it would be Greg and John, who would be waiting at the altar, and Mycroft and Sherlock walking up to them. And seeing Sherlock's happy face had brought tears forward in John's eyes...and a sidewards glance at Greg had shown him in the similar state. Mycroft had lowered his shields and was showing the real Mycroft, not the 'Ice-man', and even John had to admit that Mycroft was almost as handsome as Sherlock, as the two brothers walked side by side with their father in between them, towards their coming husbands. And with their father in the middle, it was easier to see the similarities between the two brothers, even if Sherlock did take a bit more after his mother, than Mycroft did.
Seven days after John had visited Balmoral and had been able to tell Mycroft that a royal pardon was on its way, Mycroft turned up in Baker Street with two bottles of that ridiculously fine whisky that he previously had shared with John. John had said “good-bye and thank you for your hospitality” to Mycroft and Andrea only two days before. He had decided to move back into the flat in Baker Street and Sherlock had been delighted and had said so as they wrote together on the phones. It was still too much of a security risk just to phone.
And he smiled and reached out for John and they kissed despite John’s protest, “I’ve got morning breath!”
“Hold on a minute, sir. I’ll need a bit more information: when did you receive this card and from whom....and normally there would be more than a card...a coin...a medal. Didn’t you receive such a thing?”
Of course John felt sometimes that it was very difficult to keep his hands away from Sherlock’s delicious arse and body when they were on a crime-scene. And the wagers about the status of their relationship finally found their winners and losers at the Yard, making Donovan and Lestrade a bit richer and Anderson a lot poorer. And John had sometimes wondered if he should try to find some medication that could diminish his carnal urges for Sherlock; a lust that he felt to be rather inappropriate at crime-scenes. John respected that Sherlock had no wish of engaging in sex whilst working on a case. But it was rather difficult to be abstinent!
John and Sherlock stayed in that club 4 hours. They were showed the more public rooms....for now empty....and were invited to come and “perform a scene” if they ever would want to. John looked at Sherlock and Sherlock at John...well it wouldn’t be so much more different from having Mycroft and who know how many of his minions to watch their actions during a “scene”, would it?
Sherlock had been amused over John’s remark that their mutual attraction and ability to react upon it would falter over the years to come and Sherlock’s remark to that: “You mean...only once a day when we grow old?” and John’s reply: “Yeah...you git. Or closer to the English norm: once a week or even less.” Well it turned out to be true.
_____________________________
John looked at him and did not say anything for a few seconds: “Balmoral....as in the Queen’s summer residence?!”
Finally John was almost naked....freed of his socks, jeans, shirt and sweater...as he had managed to be fully dressed in the morning after he had hurried down the stairs because Sherlock was having a nightmare. Sherlock was only in his pyjama-bottoms, an old T-shirt and his beige morning gown and those garments were easy to remove. As was John’s pants.
Mycroft sighed and covered his eyes with his hands, as he continued, “And if I feel like that, being one of the most powerful men in the Western world, how do other people then feel? And maybe that is the biggest danger: the feeling of hopelessness. Because then the darks side will win, because no one on 'the side of the angels' would know what to do.”
And here Sherlock was interrupted by John, “You were there? In Pakistan? 5 years ago, under 'The Riots'?”
“I didn't know, John.”, said Mary, “And it was, oh it sounds so cheap....but it was a 'good-bye' shag. With David. I hadn't planned on getting pregnant. And I honestly loved
From the previous chapter:
“Oh yes. He was the one who paid the cabbie. The one who put so many people into Semtex-vests. Who killed the old blind lady as she was going to tell that the man, who spoke to her, had a foreign accent. The one who threatened you and me at the pool, who forced me to leave England, put you in a bonfire and who in the end sort of killed Mary, since he wouldn't get of her back......even if she had worked for him for a long time...”
“I'm sorry...so, so sorry, Sherlock. For putting you through hell like that.....For believing that insane psychopathic woman for just a fraction of a second. For.....out of desperate loneliness and denial and anger and hurt to choose her over you. For believing that I loved her....”, John mumbled into Sherlock's curls.
John hesitated for a few seconds. He wasn’t totally sure that he wanted to submit, but a certain part of his anatomy had decided that it would be very interesting indeed.
Not the first picture where Mycroft is carrying Sherlock as a little child, but the last picture:
“I know...”, said John and kissed Sherlock's hand again.
After John had stitched the wounds on Sherlock’s back he said: “I’ll have to look at your buttocks too.”
And John had to drink the rest of his cognac to calm down. No wonder Mycroft had always been so...peculiar. How could he have been normal, whatever that would be. How could he have been that with such a shitty childhood?
From previous chapter:
“Then we'll have to talk about that too.”
She sighed, “Well, you are really a switch. There is nothing submissive about you now!”
Sherlock’s surprise for John was of course a new piece of music, a waltz, composed and played by Sherlock, but the even bigger surprise was that André Rieu, the Dutch famous violin-player, came in through the door in the orangery, went up to Sherlock while Sherlock was playing the last part of the waltz and began to play together with Sherlock.... but only a few paces.
“Yeah...something like that.”
John nodded, “Yeah..I'm still curious. So what was in it for you?”
And then John suddenly realised how those words could hurt Sherlock, “Oh I’m sorry, Love. It came out the wrong way. What I mean is that is usually you who ask
“And if you don't stop talking, I might come already. Oh God....that sinful voice of yours!”, panted Mycroft. And he turned around, adjusted the 'tent' in his pyjama-trousers and obediently walked towards his bedroom to do as Sherlock had told him. And to find a riding crop in the wardrobe. Even if Sherlock had brought the cane, Mycroft would prefer to use the crop on Sherlock.
John closed his eyes for a moment, “Oh Sherlock. I love you so much.....so so much! And I came so close to loosing you!”
“What if I sometimes want whatever you want?”
“No your git...our reactions..”
And then she looked sternly at him, “You are not allowed to come, before I allow it. Is that understood?”
“I know.”
And Mycroft looked at his nipples. In each of them was a needle put right through, but the strange part was that they almost didn't hurt. Just a faint throbbing. And almost no blood.
And Sherlock now showed his mind-reading abilities again as he said, “Oh...don't worry, John. First and foremost: the holes were very tiny. Almost closed before I put the bars through...very carefully. And the clamps do 'bite' upside-down.....and the holes are from side to side. So no risk...so please.. Continue to take me apart...captain!”
And John had seen how Greg had pulled himself together, but he had suddenly looked much older than his age.
John showed Sherlock the ancient journals and papers and explained that they told the strangest story and John asked Sherlock just to look at the material, because he would understand later.
John smiled through tears, “And that would have been such a good idea.....And have kept me alive....about 5 minutes or until I could find a quiet place and stick that Sig into my mouth. Mary never understood my love for you. Hell....I didn't understand it myself, until it was almost to late!”
Mycroft smiled a genuine smile, but a worried smile non the less, “All of that, I suppose. How can you be such a good person, Sherlock? You are amazing....how can you forgive me for such a failure? All my failures?”
Mycroft laughed, “Oh yes...and especially men who claimed that women couldn't drive, were invited....and needed clean underwear afterwards. I was too young to ever have been invited. But Elizabeth, I'll promise to think about it, but only if John and Sherlock accept.”
“The two of the cars had been found again, but never ours. So I got the insurance money, but never bought a car. It had been Mary's car most of all before that. And after she had disappeared/died I didn't miss having one and was afraid too that I might drive whilst being not sober enough to do that...”, had John explained.
Sherlock walked into the garage and pointed with triumph at an old hotplate with a gluepot on, “A way of heating up things and.....”
Greg smiled again, “Don't worry. John warned us, after we had seen all the corpses and discovered that it wasn't gas.”
Sherlock smiled, “She was one of my best friends...and you know perfectly well where she is and how she is. Why on Earth should we have gotten Christmas cards from her almost every year otherwise?”
They had begun that conversation about 'not leaving eachother' many years ago. Actually as they moved to Sussex. It had been one of their first early summer mornings, where everything had been perfect: the sun relatively warm, the smell of flowers strong and the view over the garden and the fields flawless... and they had been sitting outside eating breakfast. John had sighed contently and had said, “This is Paradise.”
_________________
“All right. It goes like this: “
John did let Sherlock do that for a while and then he said in his Captain Watson voice: “Enough!” and Sherlock stopped and looked up at John through his eyelashes....and John’s cock found that very interesting and that half-erection that John had had all the time they had been sitting on that couch in close proximity...finally!....to Sherlock, well it was a full one now!
Well, this is not so much a diary, as I suppose you'll have to write it such a book regularly. But never mind. We have been busy up here. Hiding. John Ericson and his henchmen are now officially ruling Great Britain and Europe, as far as my knowledge goes. But he still needs food and allows people to stay on their farms and work in the factories. I suppose it is a bit like in 'ye good ol' times' where the aristocracy lived in luxury and the commoner had to pay tribute to the Lords and Ladies. The free people of Great Britain have once more become serfs and 'copyholders' (as in tenants of their own land)...almost slaves. But  John is not stupid and know that he would have to refrain from killing people, if he wants food for his own people as well. He might have been a bit surprised that Great Britain’s population weren't as big, as he had anticipated. After all, more than one million people managed to disappear up in the Highlands and out into the moors. And we'll manage and survive....for years if necessary.
John kissed him and said, “You are not getting any younger and this time you have pushed yourself far longer than I've ever seen before. Except from.....”
We are still on a visit back in time. To what happened right after the events on 'false-Sherrinford-island'. Sherlock and John were as far away from each other as possible without being directly enemies. Sherlock thought John to be just as angry at him as after Mary's death......and John was full of self-hatred and guilt. Sherlock had nowhere to live and both Sherlock and Mycroft were still affected by the drugs.....and that might have explained, why they acted as they did.
John nodded and swallowed, because the thought did arouse him, “But only if you are in the mood..”
“Truth be told, John...I didn't know if the off-switch was a booby trap. And that it wouldn't explode the moment I turned it off. And I still have a feeling that not everything was to be taken at face-value regarding all that explosive material and the plan of blowing the Parliament to the moon.”
John continued with his mouth down over Sherlock's stomach until he reached the waistband of the kilt. He used his hands to push the fabric aside and Sherlock's proud erection was now to be seen between the layers.
Sherlock had been absorbed by experiments for a while, but three weeks after their last rimming session, Sherlock was starting to feel tense and twitchy. One Sunday afternoon he’d been lying on the couch trying to read, when he suddenly got up, went into the bedroom and came out a few minutes later. His collar was in his left hand and his right hand was hidden behind his back.
from Brazil and
John remembered how he had yanked nipple-clamps from Sherlock's nipples. If on of the tiny 'claws' had been caught in the tissue! Oh God....he would have destroyed the tissue!
And that was how those 3 young people: Leuris, Rohan and Eshan became a part of the strange Holmes-Watson-Lestrade-Adler family. Not necessarily genetic connected, but connected by the care and the love they had for each other. Leuris became Lady Elisabeth's apprentice but felt more like a part of the Holmes-Lestrade family and usually joked with the fact that the younger members had formed 'The-one-legged-club-of-megalomaniac-Holmes-youngsters'.
And John looked in horror at Sherlock, “Are you telling me that she drugged me with something like that devilish gas from Baskerville?!”
“Sometimes I would just 'crash': sleep for hours and eat like a starving man. Which I actually would be. And then, it was it. I returned to the 'normal setting'...or at least normal for me. Just....the abbot had warned me. He had said, “
“So when Mycroft said that you are alarmed by sex, he was right?”, wanted Mary to know.
( 'The Riots' in Pakistan 6 years ago, in 2011, is an invention of mine. Invented to serve narrative purpose)
John just looked at it and said, “Red…. Sherlock... I’m knackered.”
Now Sherlock frowned. “What is 'Sherrinford' actually?”
Sherlock was ordered to stay still, his arse in the air and head down on this elbows as John put lubricant on one of the big nozzles. John whispered quietly to Sherlock just what he intended to do. Sherlock’s response was a throaty moan.
Sherlock had explained, “They will...over time....loose their strength....so we'll have to use more than one. It is painless and will just stop your heart.”
John released the breath he didn’t know he had been withholding: “Wow....she is something!”
“Oh I do....I’ve experienced one once!”
But he was naked with a vibrating prostate-massager up his arse and he was positioned on one of the couches in the 'play-room'. He was even restrained, so he couldn't move too much around and Sherlock had brought him to the brink of orgasm 3 times....and then stopped again. Mycroft was sweating and filled with tight coiled arousal. So much that he hadn't even noticed that Sherlock had cleaned his nipples and attached the two forceps.
“Those 3 persons were played by an actor. An actress. Just like 'Moriarty' was played by Richard Brook.”
_______________________
And suddenly John moved and hugged Sherlock firmly from behind... despite porridge and all.
John and Sherlock discovered two things about their gifts for each other: it was nice that those kilts could just be washed in a washing-machine and that it indeed was very handy that Sherlock hat bought 3 of those coated sheets. That eatable body-paint made quite a mess.
“Oh....do stop deducing, Mycroft. You are on the wrong track here......I’ve done it once.....with a girl......and it wasn’t unpleasant. But we had taken care that we were “very clean” as you put it. And that is all the information you’ll get about that!! Back to your promise: I have something else in my mind......what you should do to keep your promise..”
Hamish hugged her, “No...but he will be. In a very few hours...and we can't even go to the funeral....at least I don't think so.”
John and Sherlock were careful about which cases they would take in. And even if there were adrenaline-causing chases after dubious persons and encounters with dangerous criminals, it was almost nothing compared to what they had experienced previously, before Sherlock had to jump because of Moriarty...or rather because of Magnussen. It didn't mean though that Sherlock didn't have to use his amazing mind to its full capacity to solve cases. And that meant too, that Sherlock would push both mind and body a bit too far sometimes. And then he would find it difficult to return to normal again, just as he had told John, when he had confessed that he sometimes needed pain to 'get back into his body' and still his roaring mind.
And finally John understood, “Carl August Magnussen?”
“I’ll tell you about that later....Sherlock was trained intensively too and I do not know if you had found out before... when you were living together.....But Sherlock is a part time real agent. One of the best that M16 has and he is incredible strong and persevering. I read what his captures in Ukraine, in Russia and in Serbia wrote about him in their files.....and a lesser man would have died. Remember John....even weakened and sleep deprived he was after having used drugs after your marriage, he took me by surprise and pinned me against the wall and almost broke my arm......and even you with your combat training....I’m not sure that you could have done that to me!”
“No” said John.
John caught a glimpse of tears in Sherlock’s eyes.....and thought he understood. The only other time Sherlock had tears in his eyes recently was when he rather reluctantly had told John about other nightmares....where John had been killed....blown to pieces in that swimming pool so many years ago, being shot by snipers, being abducted and killed.....each time it had played out in nightmares for Sherlock.
And he continued, “So...what now?
“Not a pretty sight?! What the hell are you talking about?” said John, but he still did as Sherlock asked and crawled under the duvet where they were facing each other...but not yet touching.

John just smiled, “Well...the stench was real enough.....and that is not the point...”
Sherlock smirked and said, “I know. That’s why - if you were not too tired to be observant - you’d notice that it is
”I thought Mycroft and Irene were enemies?”
7th of July 1974- 18th of August 2070'
birthday, as she died quietly in her sleep, after she had come home from the hospital after she had fallen in her kitchen, because of the tumour in her hip. It wasn't cancer, but the operation did strain her old body.
And now for the last item. A prostate-massager looking like a tilted 'U'. One part eased up his anus and pressing at the side of his rectum-wall, where the prostate was located behind, and the other part affecting the prostate by pressing at the perineum, with a slightly ridged part. The last part would press gently against his balls. That was the reason for the carefully made measurements. Not all men had the same measurements between those three spots. Just to have it sitting there was very arousing and Mycroft could see and feel that the moisture from the prostate was oozing out through the hollow tube of the rubber-sound. A buzzing was building slowly in his body......and he was distant. Floating....his nipples did hurt a bit, but he couldn't care less.
Sherlock had kissed John’s forehead gently and had whispered, “You wait for me on the other side, do you hear me!”
It was dark outside. Well as dark as it could get in a big city and they decided to order take away… They dressed only in their dressing gowns and pyjama bottoms and sat down on the couch. They didn’t bother showering now as they knew their plans for later that evening, would mean they’d only need another shower anyway.
Then there was silence and the young man asked: “You were not an army doctor?!”
John frowned, “I think it was the case with the 'Burned Newspaper'. One of the cases we worked on...before....just before I married...”
Mycroft nodded, “I know...and I would prefer you doing it, John. That is if you'll accept to do it?”
Sherlock nodded and then a faint blush was to be seen on his cheeks as he said, “My bedroom...thoroughly?”
“Yes sir” said Sherlock and began to satisfy his “captains” needs.
John stopped here and looked at Mycroft.
Sherlock threw the newspaper aside and rose, coming over to where John was standing, “It is not about turns, but about needs. And not even mine right now. It is a challenge. I’ll submit to you so you can have that feeling of dominance, of being in control. Right now, all the paperwork at the clinic is killing you, and you feel trapped between your need to help all those ill people and your wish to be more at home with me… Even if I’m sometimes intolerable!”
She smiled at him, “And that makes me admire you even more, Mycroft. Your resilience.”
________________________________-
Mycroft didn't try to speak, because the sudden lump in his throat would make it difficult, so he just nodded and then, after a short pause, he said, “And you did offer yourself on purpose....to save me.” Mycroft closed his eyes and a tear ran down his cheek, “That was....worse than Serbia. I know you think that I am more important and that's why you sacrificed yourself, but....”
John nodded, “Oxytocin and endorphins, most certainly. But not so much prolactin . At least that is what studies say. It might be different from person to person..”
Mycroft sat up and looked at Sherlock and asked, “How come, I'm still alive then?”
Mycroft took a step closer to Sherlock and touched his face and kissed him gently, “They did....but now we are here. And alive...I love you so much.”
“This is normally the time where I would use restrains on my husband to keep him in place....but I'll avoid them with you. Just stay in place. Can I relay on your obedience, Mycroft?”
John had packed a few necessities and in the middle of the night he entered the train that in 10 hours would bring him to Berlin. He just wondered how Sherlock would react.
The therapist had smiled at that and had asked, “How can you throw possibilities away, before you even have investigated them? Sherlock might be hurt...even because of your behaviour and actions and your wife's actions and attempts to kill him... again. But how can you know that he won't forgive you and that you are not harming him more, by staying away...again. Keeping Rosie away from him?”
They finally said goodnight to each other and Sherlock headed for one of the guest rooms, carrying the bag that some of Mycroft's employees had brought from Baker Street, and Mycroft dressed in his pyjamas and went to bed. He was not able to sleep right away. But that was not something new, so he prepared for another sleepless night. Tonight was not a night where he could use his 'toys' to stop his mind from whirling...not tonight, and maybe it was a good idea to read the reports one time more in order to see if there were more to be done.....maybe even about John. Because that man wasn't in a good place either. Better keep an eye on him, because Sherlock would not forgive Mycroft for not keeping an eye on John, even if they had drifted apart.
In there John first yanked Sherlock's dressing gown of, pushed Sherlock down on the bed and ordered Sherlock to lie still, and yanked Sherlock's trousers off, whilst John managed to get rid of his own clothing almost at the same time.
Mycroft stopped talking and looked with an arched eyebrow at John...and John thought to himself, that Mycroft must really have rehearsed that movement in front of a mirror for a long time to make it that perfect.
“It is all right...”, whispered Sherlock hoarsely, “.....you couldn't possibly have known..”
Sherlock did slide under the duvet and found Mycroft's half erection with his mouth and said, before he did put his mouth around Mycroft's cock, “Bad pun....And now it is your turn to have your dream fulfilled, I believe!”
Mary paused and nodded, “I should have known, that you knew too. Yes....I'm going to take contact again. Even if it might come as a shock for her that her mother is white.”
Sherlock turned away, “Don't tease me, Mycroft..”
And Sherlock’s cock immediately found that version of John very interesting.....and Sherlock felt a shiver run through his body...Oh yes...this was going to be good! And he hurried to kneel in front of John who was sitting with his legs spread on the edge of the bed. Sherlock’s head was bowed...and he felt the anxiety he had felt about the scars and his body melt away....even the pain from the beating the night before disappeared. He was almost floating....and that just by being ordered around. He didn’t have to think...to deduce. All he had to do was to obey John.
Lady Smallwood and Mycroft still agreed that marrying each other would be an unwise decision. Just.....Lady Smallwood wasn't totally sure that it would be 'unwise' after all. She found that she fell more and more in love with the real man behind that bespoke 3-piece suit. But the age-gap of 16 years made her keep silent. And she sort of hoped that Greg, when he finally found out about Mycroft's feelings about him and would finally tell Mycroft that he felt the same way...well, she hoped that Greg could not fulfil all Mycroft's needs and that she would still be needed. And that Greg would be open-minded enough to understand.
Then Mycroft cleared his throat, “Do you want more knowledge than the contents in those reports?”
Mycroft sat in his car for a while. Thinking.. and then he tapped the window to the chauffeur and mentioned Lady Smallwood's address. Then he found her business card and his telephone and wrote a SMS and hit send. After a few seconds came the reply. Mycroft nodded and it could be seen in his set of his jaw, that he made a decision.
Sherlock came with a moan and a shudder and his orgasm just continued as John kept fucking his anus with his tongue, immensely enjoying how Sherlock convulsed around his tongue. It was on brink of being painful. And then Sherlock went limp. His body so blissed-out that he lost consciousness for a several seconds. It didn’t scare John like it had done the first time it had happened, and he knew that Sherlock would surface again and come back ‘on-line’ within a matter of minutes.
And Sherlock ducked under the kilt and moaned as he took John down in one swift gliding motion. An action that made John's knees buckle a bit.
Sherlock hurried to obey. The restraints were soft thick leather straps fastened to the headboard and Sherlock used them by winding the leather around his wrists. He was able to get out of them easily if he wanted to. He would just have to manoeuvre his wrists to get out. But somehow it worked. His brain seemed to forget that he was able to do that when he hit subspace.
He was so lost in his thoughts that he hadn’t noticed that they were at the club and only Sherlock’s tug at his sleeve made John aware of his surroundings again.
John shook his head, “I don't get it! Why did you have to interfere like that?”
Sherlock didn't say anything, just sighed and Mycroft could see even more tension leave Sherlock.
John just looked at Sherlock, but said nothing. Those bloody Holmes-brothers....sometimes much too clever for their own good!
_____________________
And Sherlock read, “
“Okay?”, Greg asked and what he really meant was 'are you still in need for submission or was what I gave you enough?'
_______________________________
And then John looked into Sherlock eyes, “You...you really didn't remember?”
The man behind him couldn’t help but admire Sherlock’s body. With his clothes on he seemed almost sinew, but without the disguise of his tailored suits his body-type was revealed - athletic - to some extend even very muscular. Not like a body-builder...more like a dancer or an acrobat. Pure strength.
John had remained still and had not moved much, “How does it feel, Sherlock?”
Mycroft turned and faced her, “No...maybe not. But Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade has been a married man for decades and has no interest whatsoever in me. As a brother to Sherlock and as an allied in keeping my brother safe, yes. But in no way as a partner. He isn't turned that way. And for the two remaining questions or advises: I'll give it a thought, but right now I'm busy. Sherlock is not in a good place, even if he is recovering and I have to find out, what is going on. And I have to make further plans regarding my sister. We will not see each other for a while, Elizabeth.”
“Well...let me put it this way.” said Mycroft: “They had no choice and they know that they owe me and England a lot...let’s say for the next 50 years. We didn’t hesitate to tell them about the planned assassination of the American president, but they’ve withheld information for years. That is history now. I would just so much have liked to know all this about Mary before you married her.....and those blasted Americans knew about her then. Not much...but enough to have prevented all this misery. They are not in doubt now...I can assure you both that very powerful persons are indeed very displeased about their silence. Some are going to lose their jobs!”
“No.....I was a GP before I entered the army. They do not need GP’s, but they needed a god soldier. I was first and foremost a captain and then mostly of all a “paramedic”. I wouldn’t have been allowed out in the battlefield had I been a real army doctor...they are much too valuable!”
And again the countries of Middle and Southern Africa were haunted by diseases. Ebola, SARS and AIDS did still take there toll and then another disease emerged, one that had, like those 'old' diseases, crossed the barriers between species,......and it was only a label from ancient times that would fit that new disease. The plague. Not the old one from the medieval age, but a new one. Contagious through touch. A virus. And the rest of the world did isolate the part of Africa south of Sahara totally. With the help of military means. At least they could agree on that and then that part of Africa was left to deal with its problems on its own. The rest of the world was too busy with their own problems to worry about the African continent.
John found himself in Mycroft’s house in a very comfortable guest-room half an hour later that night, now almost so late that it could have been called early, and surprisingly he slept rather well only disturbed by a single dream from Afghanistan....and that was not even one of the worst ones. And he stayed at Mycroft’s house nearly all the time the next month and a half except from a short trip to Scotland. Mycroft had offered John the possibility to go back and stay in Baker Street and John had lifted his eyebrow and asked why Sherlock had kept the flat if he never intended to return to London? Mycroft had just said that he would never have given up hope as long as Sherlock was still breathing and suddenly John understood: “That wound...that wasn’t an accident. Was it?”
Mycroft sat up on the couch and so did Lady Smallwood. He looked at her and said, “I did disappoint you before, didn't I?”
“What do you mean? I've seen your scars?”, said John and Mary nodded. She had seen them too.
But Mycroft had just looked at John and had said: “How do you even think that I found Sherlock in time in those dungeons in Serbia? I wouldn’t have been there in time to save him if he hadn’t been “tracked”. It could be seen that he wasn’t moving much and the pattern of his movement was suspicious......If we had not have such a tracker on him we wouldn’t have had time enough to prepare for his rescue...even if I did manage to learn Serbian in about 4 hours. Sherlock is one of my best agents......and he is a real agent, John....and all my agents are tracked!”
They got easily enough out of the duct-tape. It is after all just a question of technique. And with their hands freed and without blindfolds, they were sitting there on the floor on a filthy mattress and waiting for the drugs to wear off. Leaning up against each other and trying to figure out, why they had been abducted, when there were so many more important persons present in that hall and to that meeting.
And then Sherlock apparently changed subject as he asked John, “Do you know the book called 'Ender's Game'?”
“I sometimes submit and I enjoy pain. As a mean to still my mind. I am what you would call a switch. Both sadistic tendencies, because I like to dominate, but most certainly masochistic tendencies too.”
She turned around again and opened her black silk dressing gown and did let it fall on the floor. She wore some of her black leather outfit from before, but her groin was naked except from a line of black pearls that went from her leather corsage down between her legs and up between her buttocks.
“Rosie?!”, had John wanted to know.
….....
“Yeah...something like that.”
Sherlock smiled, “Yeah...at Baker Street. I had tried to make you and Mary talk...because she worked for Moriarty and...”
_______________
And Mycroft could feel the tension build and build.
Here Sherlock was interrupted by John, “Ashtanga.....I see. No wonder you can keep so fit. I've always wondered how you could do that, without exercising......and now I understand that you did exercise.”
John hurried upstairs to get dressed and as he came down, Mycroft and Sherlock was in the living room, Sherlock in his chair and Mycroft on the couch and both had a cup of tea in front of them...and a third ...in a mug....was waiting for John at his chair.
Sherlock frowned at him, “Hmm...you might have put your feet on the first metres on that path. But no...you are not 'alcoholic'. You use it as a bit unhealthy coping-mechanism, but you are not an alcoholic, even if your fear it...”
And finally John could tell what had happened that day in September 6 years ago. It turned out that the young man whose life he had saved had been Prince William! That the Royal family had been looking for John ever since...but major Armitage never got to tell enough about the doctor who had saved young William’s life and the phone call home to England from the helicopter that fell down only minutes after, had only revealed “army doctor”...”I gave him my card”....”saved Prince William life”.....”risking his own”....”didn’t even get his name”...And Prince William could only remember fragments and kept on talking about the “golden soldier-angel that had saved him”.
“Well you usually use the phrase: “Kiss my arse!”......and if you insist, which you are entitled to as I promised that you could ask me anything, I would prefer if you were very clean!”
“And the adults left it to a 13 year boy to figure out what should happen.....”
He knelt by John’s chair saying, “You mentioned that I should just ask… So… Please, I’m asking you John. Before it gets worse!”
She smiled at him: “”Ma’am” would do....I am speaking to the man who not only has saved my grandson but me too. And I found it appropriate to show you some respect by acknowledge your connection to Scotland, Dr. Watson....have a seat and a nice cup of tea!”
Mycroft went to the cupboard again and found the other thing he had noticed that Sherlock had liked: a set of nipple-clamps with a chain. One of Mycroft's favourites as well. Mycroft did reach under the cross and attached the clamps to Sherlock's nipples and let the heavy chain hang towards the floor. Sherlock hissed a bit, but didn't say anything and Mycroft could tell that Sherlock did sink deeper into sub-space.
John had been told to write down his wish on a sheet of paper.....a courier-car would fetch it within two hours and could it and he be ready then?
“How long do you need to pack a few necessities, sir?”
His nephew, Sherrinford Holmes, who only ‘occupied a minor position in the English government’ just like his father had done, was on the screen immediately.
': well there were often events at our school where parents and elder siblings were invited...”
“No...not shaved....wax!”, panted Sherlock and that made John stop for a few seconds and now he used his fingers to fondle Sherlock's balls, and caressed the area behind them, close to Sherlock's hole, but not touching yet. Doing the fondling with his fingers, so he had his mouth free to talking, “Are you saying that you go to a clinic and lie down there, arse in the air and let others see your private parts, when you get waxed?”
And the two men smiled at each other.
But it was not only Sherlock's gorgeous body, that could impress John. It was the incredible mind under those beautiful curls and behind those laser-sharp eyes, that was now focused on John, too. Sherlock gave a little gasp and opened his mouth a bit so his front teeth became visible.....and then John could see a faint pink hue on Sherlock's cheeks and how Sherlock's eyes suddenly became darker, as his pupils dilated.
Sherlock frowned, “But....but you must have had sex with Mary...and....”
John had swallowed and tried to say something through a lump in his throat, “If we are allowed to be old and our children will be grown-ups and not needing us any-more, I hope that we will not have to live long without each other. That we can find a way to...”
*A PARDON?*
“And you had something more? I think it is important to know that we are on the same page in the BDSM-book”, smirked Lady Smallwood.
Sherlock shook his head, “Even if I can understand your wish to be...omnipotent, sister, I can't understand how that could be possible. Unless of course you are a mutant like those in those films, John loves.....what are they called?”
John was the one to speak first “So...since the bedroom is out of the question, even if I would very much like to kiss you all over and......”
“No. But you know the system from the inside. Just listen. You'll notice, if something is amiss. And the same goes for you, Greg.”, had Mycroft continued, “You are not retired yet, but you have talked about it for at least a few months by now. I have arranged for you and some others close to retirement, to attend that meeting for retired police-officers as well.”
Sherlock was waiting a bit impatiently while John was finding the things, he would need and while John was putting on the 'things' Sherlock had asked him to wear. And Sherlock had smirked a bit as he gave John the bag and John had laughed, as he saw the contents.
_________________________________
And now Sherlock looked at him under hooded eyes, “Wouldn't it be a shame not to get to use that throughout hard work your tongue did on my arse?”
“Shhhh...it wasn’t your fault. Just a stupid accident. The wrong place at the wrong time. I was told that it was a young man in that van and he had a heart-attack and died. Just bad luck...”
John laughed, “I don’t care.....I could eat a boiled dishcloth by now. I’m starving!”
John loved making Sherlock fall apart. To control him so much that Sherlock would forget his own name and would only be able to utter simple words… And sometimes even not that.
Mary looked terrible. Her face was bruised and the rest of her head was bandaged and she was of course hooked up on several life supporting machineries, and as John looked in her journal he found that it was a miracle that she was still alive. She had been on the operation table two times already and was now waiting for the next operation. This one in her head...again.
Greg interrupted, “You did interfere there, didn't you? It went so very smoothly......and she didn't ask for more than her share. Actually a bit less.....”
And then John had realised what he just had said and before he could back-pedal, Sherlock had given him a fierce hug and said, “Yes...yes a thousand times. I accept!”
Coming back into the bathroom again John couldn’t wait any longer. He put some more lubricant on his cock. He could not remember being so turned on ever....not even as he had been at his most hormonal teenage-years.....and he pushed his cock into the welcoming warmth and tightness of the willing Sherlock......Oh God...it was so good...so fulfilling......finally to be there!
John pinched his nose between his eyebrows: “Mina wasn’t mine. I know. I got a suspicion when I saw her hair. Mary’s ex-friend David had red hair, I suppose. But I still loved Mina! It wasn’t her fault!”
“If you are going to say that you do not deserve this happiness, I'm fetching the riding-crop, that is in one of you bags...and I'll hit you with it! You and I deserve each other......through thick and thin and being both good and evil both of us. In short: we are humans, John. With flaws and failures and the only thing I can promise, as I did today, is to be there for you in the best possible way. But I can't promise, that I will never make you sad, that I'll never hurt you. But I can promise that I'll never do it on purpose. Never. I'll repeat my words: you make me a better man. You make me whole. Without you, I'm just a shell, a hollow shell. We fit together, you and I, like jig-saw pieces. My Yin to your Yang and the other way around. Black and white. Holmes and Watson....”
“No neurotically damages? “
(We’ll translate into English and continue:)
And that was were the papers in the first folder ended.
Sherlock just caressed John's head, “And so am I. For all the grief and sorrow I caused you by jumping in front of you. Making you believe that you had failed me.”
And the three young families did settle down in the village in Scotland. All of them welcomed. Doctors and nurses were always in demand and teachers as well. And the elderly priest did appreciate the younger priest too.
....no...”
His speech was filled with warmth and love for his brother and his brother-in-law as well. He had used his access to various sources regarding John to find some of the more secret actions John had been a part in in Afghanistan.
"Well, a
Sherlock rose, wincing a bit, and started looking around in the cellar room, “If they are coming here, in this house, we might work on a plan to eliminate them.”
“And took care that her husband was put to jail?”
“To the headmaster M. Schmidt
Yes....indeed “back in the right place” even if it had been a long and tedious journey to get there.
“Yeah....how did you know?”
John nodded, “Maybe you should begin with the events, that started with you and me meeting at Barts?”
Sherlock got out of bed. Did stand on his legs, a bit wobbly, because he was thin and had been in bed for a long time. And moved so he could stand close to John in front of him. Then Sherlock knelt on the floor and , reluctantly, took John's hands, as if he expected them to be fists at any moment.
“And thus preserve the DNA intact. I found evidence of experimentation on embryos. Animal embryos, while we were investigating the H.O.U.N.D incidents. But even if I knew about the glowing rabbit, I never thought that they could have been that advanced. Not back in the 1960ties..”, explained Sherlock.
“I’ll think about it....I’m not so much into pain, you know! Obedience would be OK though!”
And Sherlock could see John's growing erection and made a sound deep in his throat before he said, ”Oh. That..that sounds acceptable..”
And there Sherlock stopped. He had not intended to pile more guilt on John's shoulders. But John just nodded and continued Sherlock's sentence, ”....not until your arse of a former flatmate had beaten the shit our of you and told you to fuck off and stay away., as you finally miraculously returned from your exile. And later that same arse blamed you for not contacting him...me. And yet....you got me out of that bonfire. You jumped of that blasted roof, because you thought I was in danger. And the same pattern repeated itself after my wedding.....and after you shot Magnussen and after Mary died. Jesus, Sherlock, how can you keep on forgiving me like that? I have been such an arse towards you.....and it is my fault every time you have relapsed and....”
John stopped, unable to speak any-more, but Sherlock understood. And now it was his turn to give John a hug. They stood like that a few seconds, because that was all they had before Rosie protested and wanted their attention.
Mycroft looked at Greg with his eyebrow lifted and just a tiny smirk at the corner of his mouth and Greg thought that the scientists at Baskerville must have had 'Vulcan' genes to their disposal (Even if the Vulcans were just a fictional race) when they made those Holmes-brothers, because they could be just as difficult to read as that green Alien 'Spock' in Star Trek.
It had been Sherlock, who had answered, “Two undercover agents caught some information about a professor in Germany, who had invented new sorts of weapons and was wise enough to sell them to all the different countries. And then the professor had planned different acts of terror and murder to 'ignite the powder-keg' and start the Great War. But he was stopped and one of the agents died whilst killing the professor. It was something with a waterfall, as I recall. The factory, where the weapons were made, were blown to pieces and nothing was left....not even drawings or plans.....and the tension in the world did loosen up a bit...and the 'War to end all wars' didn't happen until 1914, as you all know..”
And one thing more: the disease was unfair. It did affect men more than woman and except from infants, it did hit harder on grown ups than on children and just like AIDS had done, it left villages and cities with grandmothers, a few mothers and children and not so many men.
“Yeah, I've read about that HMS Southshire. From the shipyard 'Tollerton'. A new experimental ship, but still with steam-engines, made for warfare in the Arctic Ocean. A totally stupid idea at that time. The steam-engines on board such a ship wouldn't be strong enough to force the ship through the ice..and they had furthermore failed to construct the ship in such a way that it could withstand the pressure from the ice. It was only a year after that, that a competitive company, The Braynard Yard, had succeeded in making a stronger ship, that could actually sail through the ice.” explained Sherlock.
John looked in shock at the angel. He had always believed that no matter how much he had damaged or hurt Sherlock, he knew that he had prevented Sherlock's death. Now he had learned that it had been in vain. And then, out of desperation, John got an idea.
“I know. Victor Trevor. You see, Sherlock. Mycroft and I...we had a lot of time to talk, here in this room, while you were unconscious. I read some of our old cases aloud too. A lot of books...and sometimes Mycroft, or Greg or Molly or Mrs. Hudson, we would just sit here talking, knowing that you might hear some of it. There was a lot of REM-phase brain-waves...it is just....as if you never could pass beyond that phase and wake up properly....And I love you too. Am in love with you. I just denied it, because that part of me had been beaten out of me.”
John nodded and pointed, “The nipple-clamps for the nipples, obviously. The chain is to weigh them down so they tug a bit at the nipples. The small floggers....for your backside? And the small leather straps? Maybe around your balls?”
John would never had thought that he would be on his hands and knees begging to have Sherlock's cock stuffed up his arse. He would have forsworn that he would have enjoyed having another man's fingers up his arse and be able to come just from that. On the other hand, Sherlock was so responsive, that he reacted positively to everything John did, and John did use his big knowledge of human anatomy and his big experience together with women to please Sherlock as well.
His T-shirt and pyjama-trousers was carefully removed...he had no pants on.....and John just turned his back to him and handed him his old blue silk gown with his head turned away.....and Sherlock thought: “Oh my...is my body that repulsive?”
Then John stopped for a few seconds and turned Sherlock around, by turning Sherlock's body and lifting his leg. John's cock was still deeply buried inside Sherlock and the extra sensation of John's cock turning inside Sherlock, made Sherlock moan again. Sherlock was all soft and pliant now and had his eyes closed. His untouched cock was almost purple and there was a steady dripping of pre-come oozing from the slit. And Sherlock had still his arms obediently lifted over his head and was holding on to the pillow.
John grappled Sherlock’s coat and turned Sherlock against him and kissed him firmly. And as he did let go of Sherlock’s coat he said: “I do not need roses....and the kneeling...well we can discuss that later....but yes, and yes and another yes. Of course....but I do not need rings to be sure about you. As I said....you’ll have to throw me out to get rid of me! But yes.....I would like to show everybody that we do belong together!”
And she took a drag of the cigarette and asked him, “Have you thought more about my advise?”
John was sitting with his mouth open, “That...that was brilliant. You made me shiver! You were that slimy officer through and through. Oh my. Maybe you should have chosen another career, both of you! Should have been actors. Oh my...”
And then John decided bravely to visit Sherlock. If Sherlock would accept to talk with him....
Here Mycroft was interrupted by Lady Smallwood, “How have you managed to avoid being mentioned in the files of those clubs? Not even you can avoid that?”
“And now you have learned that I'm just a human being as well and with a somewhat dubious moral.”, said Mycroft and continued, “...if you want to press charges against me or have someone to do that, I'll understand and...”
“I suppose there is nothing more to say right now, besides that I’m terribly sorry for your loss. You do give a call...before...”
“Anything for you. And you just have to ask and I'll do it again.”
Mycroft shook his head and said, “No...it was the last resort. And not a plan that I would have approved of. It was to risky. But Magnussen new about the first layer of our plans and had planned to gloat, as Sherlock would be so disappointed to find out that there were no vaults under Appledore. Sherlock had suspected the vaults to be either under Appledore, or under the office-building next to Magnussen's building in London City. He was supposed to send me a code, when he had confirmation of the vaults being under the office-building. As soon as he had sent the code, we did cut off the energy supply to the building, cut it off the internet-connections and 'jammed' the possibility of sending anything via blue-tooth. Actually...we jammed the whole centre of London...”
John couldn't help smiling as he saw how fast Sherlock had got rid of his coat and how Sherlock almost ran towards the bedroom.
But Mary had heard and understood, “Oh..Sherlock.”, she said.
John suddenly understood, “That was the reason for all the clutter at Baker Street! You moved it around in certain patterns....and if they didn't fit, you knew it was false...”
And the door swung open and revealed mixture between a garage and a carpenters workshop.
“You still don’t feel repulsed?!”
“Hmm.....I once got this card....from an officer. And he said that I could call this number any time, if I needed a favour.....” John’s voice faded.....maybe it was just one big mistake...
“Mostly to be blamed on me, I know, Sherlock. I was such an arse towards you. Didn't even bother to contact you, my best friend and the planner of the most magnificent wedding...”
Sherlock’s secrets had to do with the music. And Mycroft was involved in that. Mycroft had worried a bit that his secret help to John might stain his new-found better relationship to his brother, but Sherlock assured him that it was OK, but only if he helped Sherlock keep some secrets from John too. The last part said with a smirk....and of course Mycroft promised that.
John lost track of time as he got involved in his book, and hadn’t realised that the timer was actually broken. John didn’t look at the watch on his wrist until more than twenty minutes had passed.
“Yes..yes of course!”, said Sherlock.
Here John was interrupted by Sherlock, “As far as I know, you have never pressed that piston down or forced me to smoke, ingest or sniff any substances. It has been my own choice every time, John. I'm just to weak to cope without substances, when the world becomes too much.....”
Mycroft was breathing...in and out....to soothe the pain. It was not unbearable, but it was intense. Filled his mind with white noise. And then the pain faded a bit.
And Mrs. Hudson went to fetch Rosie and intended to keep her downstairs with the telly on, in case her fathers didn't need to sleep any more, but would like to participate in other activities....with each other.
“That is why I have kept that job. I know that the money on our mutual account is mine as well...and that you could transfer from your account if it should be necessary.”
Sherlock stood a while and thought about what John had said.
You have used reversed psychology wearing that ring openly. People would go: “...
year. And cerebral experiments shows that children very seldom can remember anything before the age of about 3...”
Mycroft just nodded and then he said: “I had stopped early regarding you a goldfish, John....”.and then he turned around and walked away towards his car.
Sherlock shook his head, “I'm not quite sure. But they like and admire each other. It was her who gave Mycroft his powerful position. She is older than him and had already a solid career, when he was still in his real 'minor position'. Somehow I think that they would have thought about getting married, if it wouldn't have meant that one of them should give up their position in the government. And they do not want to do that. Having sex together? They are almost on the same power-level, and even if Lady Elisabeth would admit that Mycroft's mistake was understandable, she would still ask him to 'pay' and they can't harm each other with their knowledge. They just have to be discrete. So...if Greg can't, there are both you and me and her to deliver the blows.”
“So what does your wife think about you coming here… With the obvious purpose of something sexual happening?” was John’s first question.
“That you could never remember Greg's name. What was that about?”
And with that remark the ice was broken and John didn’t feel like he was walking on broken glass any more.
Sherlock smiled and said, “No...not ruined. Just delayed a bit. Let us just talk for a few moments...and then figure out if we should sleep..or continue. I'll like to hear a bit more about those kinky Victorians.”
And standing in the kitchen was Sherlock, in his old blue silk dressing gown, with bare feet and only in his dress-trousers apparently. No shirt.
“Where is it?”
Beloved husband and the world’s only consulting detective
Sherlock smiled a bit at the last part and John continued, “Your chin is not rectangular....like....like one on an American cartoon hero. It is more refined....aristocratic. If you were an actor, you would play aristocratic roles. Never a peasant. There is something Hollywood-thirties-film-star-looks about you. Some time-less male beauty. Your mouth....well, before you had to jump and we lived together...and I have to admit even after that time. That mouth could give me a boner! Seeing you this morning with your lips around my cock....Oh God, Sherlock. It gives me a boner again. Feel!”
John looked around and saw the bar-trolley. He went over and looked at the selection of alcoholic beverages before he chose two glasses and poured some fine cognac into them and then he returned to his chair, offering Mycroft one glass.
John frowned and tried to understand, “But Sherlock, it doesn’t make any sense. If she still is so damaged, how could she pretend to be that woman on the bus, 'Faith' and the false therapist....and Eurus spoke at that island, even if it must have been a false island, a theatre-scenery. She talked to us. Taunted us.”
All three Holmes-relatives looked at each other and then Mycroft asked, “How...why do you think one of us did that?!”
“They were actually rather kinky back then. Maybe it was easier to ask their doctor.” said John and almost lost his breath as Sherlock undressed and laid back on the bed totally naked with his legs slightly bend and spread out.....so John had full access to his body and said with a smirk, “Well I'm asking my doctor now!”
He shook his head, “That she had worked for Moriarty, was something I told you...and you were in no condition to go to Baker Street. You couldn't even leave your bed..”
And time went by. Greg did retire the following year, in 2026 and Mycroft in 2031, as he turned 60. After that Mycroft did still work on his plan to secure knowledge. On secret hidden computers and sometimes on microfilm. He sometimes told Greg that he felt guilty, because he would use money that he had earned by investing in various projects and maybe he ought to use some of those money on helping other organisations instead?
So many more secrets are revealed and Mycroft keeps on talking. Mycroft shows a hidden talent as well. So this is a long chapter too.
“Wow...what a cold hearted and evil plan...”, was everything John could say.
Sherlock looked at John with big eyes and asked, “Would you please repeat, what you just said?”
*MARY WAS THE SUBSTITUTE!*
Sherlock had woken up that June-morning to find that John had passed away in his sleep. It wasn't totally unexpected, because John had been ill for a while, and the evening before, he had said to Sherlock that he felt 'something was not good and he didn't feel well'.
After the evening meal Prince William turned up and John gave him a small box he had fetched from his suitcase before he left Mycroft’s house.
*SAY WHAT?*
On the way he asked the chauffeur to stop at a florist and he went out to get a bouquet of roses. Not white, that would symbolise 'innocence'. Not red for 'passion and love'. But peach for 'modesty'.
It was John who started the conversation, “Mycroft… When Sherlock and I started this, we promised each other that we would talk openly about our desires and needs. No more “not acknowledging the elephant in the room”. And it should apply to you too, if you want to be a part of this, is that clear?”
Before he opened the door, he looked at Sherlock and explained, “This is the secret. The reason why I wanted to make so much extra money. The Orangery will go on Mycroft’s account. He said it was his small ‘thank you’ for....to use his words... ‘exquisite favours’.....but this is paid by me. You might find it ridiculous, but please Sherlock...humour me in this. Promise....please!”
Lady Smallwood frowned, “I didn't know..”
“It wasn't Moriarty?”
Sherlock looked around. It was the wet dream for everybody more into the advanced sex-life: bucks, two St. Andrea's crosses, couches, two huge beds and different frames and a hammock. And against the walls were cupboards filled with various items for sex: plugs, vibrators, floggers, canes....everything. All of 'the machinery' with covers of see-through plastic and covered with a thin layer of dust. Except for one cupboard.
John looked worried: “And by making your own blood sugar level into something like a roller-coaster, you are heading towards a diabetes. Haven’t your doctor told you so?”
John drank the last of his drink and began, “I'm not breaking down like the last time where you were the one comforting me, even if I most certainly didn't deserve to be comforted. That breakdown... I had that yesterday at my therapist's. But it was necessary...a part of seeing who I am. I'm turning into my father...No. I
John smiled, “I don't know or claim to understand how your mind works. But normal mnemonic-technique works by imagining a room or a house and then place the things you want to remember in the rooms in that house. I've used the same technique, when I studied for exams. Or you can use a film, that you know well, and put memories in the scenes. I suppose that is how they did it to you. Your brain just did put persons you knew and cared about into those film-scenes as well. The one you described about Mary in Morocco and me thrown in a well. That I could recognize from an ancient agent-film. And the house with the swimming-pool, that was from a TV-series......as was the burning boat. Just that it was in a harbour in Miami in the series.”
But then he looked down again: “That is not all....I....I’m not alone a masochist and submissive...sometimes I.....I...have sadistic tendencies too...and dominant behaviour!”
“You know why Sherlock had to jump of that roof?”
“Yes...yes of course. But I can't still get my head around it. How can you be so forgiving? ”
I'm not leaving Mycroft and Lady Smallwood, not yet. There are still a few things to be discussed. And the beginning of this chapter happens the day after Mycroft left her house.......and yes. They did meet a few times more. In her house and Mycroft was relieved from 'some tension'. But never as severe as the first time.
“Green, sir!”
“But I was never in a good position to invite them here. I had to...to leave, remember? And after that things got rather muddled...”
And finally he found what he was looking for. A visiting card: “Lord H.V. Armitage” it said and a phone number and then something scribbled with a pen...one word..... “platinum”. John had used it as a bookmark and had forgotten all about it......maybe it was because he had been shot only 4 hours after he had left that card in his book. The seriousness of the injury and the violent infection afterwards had somehow erased a lot of his memories of that day....except from the moments just before and after he had been shot. But now he remembered almost everything again:
“I once had a girl-friend, who would like to explore that a bit. But it was just the softest stuff,...and I couldn't make myself do it wholeheartedly. Mostly because she wasn't honest about it and then I know as much as any doctor should know. I've met some people in my practice, where I came close to putting my pen on the papers to report abuse. One of the wounded men stopped me and said, “
There on the bed were two perfect attires for Scottish gentlemen: two kilts. One in the Holmes tartan and one in the Watson tartan, cream coloured hoses, two prince Charlie jackets in very rich velvet in a dark blue, matching the colours of the kilts, matching vests, two matching sporrans, kilt-pins, flashes, wing-collar shirts and bowties...everything. Even 2 kilt-pins and 2 ‘sgian dubs’ and on the floor two pair of Chillie Brogue shoes.
“Easily! I love you too...so much”, said Sherlock and somehow they were now both standing holding on to each other, a bit like when John broke down and Sherlock had comforted him. But this time they kissed and kissed. More and more heated. Their hands roaming all over each others bodies.....until Sherlock stopped.
John hurried to the bedroom and fetched the buttplug....if he had only known that Sherlock used such an item!
Mycroft was shown into one of the sitting rooms after he had handed over the bouquet to the servant, who had opened the front door.
“Shit!” John shouted and ran to the bathroom. Sherlock could easily have safe-worded, but he had obediently stayed, arse up in the air and had just endured. John realised that it was rather painful for Sherlock by now. Not dangerous, there were no real dangers with a twenty minute retention, just extreme discomfort.
____________________
Sherlock looked at their intertwined hands......yes his hand was a young man’s hand too. Just like John’s. Sherlock’ brow furrowed in confusion when he looked at John again, “Weren’t you wearing fatigues and a T-shirt just a moment ago?” he asked.
Mycroft paused a few seconds before he continued, “You were brought to a hospital and given a throughout examination. Or as throughout as they could give you. You weren't very cooperative...and their excuse for their incompetent behaviour was that they never realized...before it was a bit too late, that you were deeply traumatized and must have seen the murder of your mother and the suicide of your father, not to mention that your father had tried to kill you. You were brought to an institution and stayed there until the beginning of February. When Mummy finally found out where you had been brought, the doctors had diagnosed you as 'autistic' because you refused to talk, would scream if they tried to get you out of your clothes or take your belongings away. Mummy got 'absolutely monstrous' and had yanked you out of the staff's hands and brought you home to our house immediately. She did let you see that your belongings were right next to you in a see-through plastic bag, so you could see them the whole time. And she had persuaded you to have a bath, have your hair washed and to have some clean clothes on. Then she had shown how she had put your pyjama and pants and sweater in the washing-machine and had let you sit and watch as they got clean and were hung out to dry. That night you fell asleep in a new, a little too big pyjama of mine, and in my junior-bed. And beside you in that big plastic bag were all your belongings except from the toy dog, that were firmly clutched in your hand as you finally fell asleep. To make a long story short: I got a new adopted baby-brother and.....”

And he had indeed been a “Lord Abington”. John had asked Sherlock how he had known and Sherlock had just looked at John and said: “Look at his bone-structure. It is similar to mine even if I’m not the higher aristocracy” (But in fact Sherlock had been aristocracy as Mycroft recently had admitted). “A bit odd features....It possesses some in-breed quality of sorts. Just as if his ancestors had close family re-unions amongst the young members that didn’t stop in time. At least they did know in the old times...even if they didn’t know about genes...that “some fresh blood” would be needed from time to time.....a maid or a stable-boy.....to avoid too many eccentric “uncle Archie”s or “aunt Maddie”s. But never the less....look at my appearance John. I’ll never pass for a peasant or a mine-worker. I’m too “delicate”....Descended from generations of individuals that didn’t have to worry about wherefrom they should get the next meal...and I do not mean it as a quality! It is a limitation to my ability to pass as another person.....and it is annoying!”
Sherlock looked at his phone for a long time before he typed the words. He wasn’t even sure that John would even answer after their last conversation more than a week ago. And therefore he hadn’t dared to contact John. Mycroft had said that Sherlock ought to.
Sherlock sighed and turned his head away: “Nothing...it was just a dream...a terrible nightmare!”
John tried to interrupt, but Sherlock hushed, “No...he is. At planning cunning intrigues. At fooling others, including me. At arranging and manipulating...and at not feeling so much. Maybe I should start there....”
They told a story about rumours about a strange man living on the moor. About a village where everybody had been contaminated and died, except from one man and then about the expedition to the North with participation of the 'recently widowed Lord Thomas Baskerville, who had lost his son in the same accident, where Sir Thomas'  wife had died'....
And finally Sherlock's words worked and John stopped shivering.
John remained inside Sherlock, because both men wanted to ride the after-chock still being closely connected and Sherlock had wrapped his long legs around John, reminding John of an octopus and John wondered for a few seconds about how many legs Sherlock actually had.
John had thought a bit more about Sherlock’s words and found it strange that Sherlock could not see how beautiful he was and John just wondered if Sherlock never noticed how people turned around to look at Sherlock when he passed by. Both men and women. And Sherlock called his own handsome features “some in-breed quality”...strange...
And Sherlock didn't mention what he had made besides breakfast. There was no reason to tell John yet. How thoroughly Sherlock had showered and cleaned himself with the enema, he had brought from Baker Street. Sometimes Sherlock's irregular eating-habits and his recent drug-use would disturb his digestion so much, that it could be necessary to use an enema. And now, with the plans Sherlock had for the next couple of hours, it could be very useful. After the bath and the cleaning, Sherlock had used another thing brought from Baker Street. A butt-plug. So he could be ready for John....and surprise him and seduce him at the same time. Because John had gone now several days without so much as a wank, so according to what Sherlock remembered about John when he lived in Baker Street 221B, John must soon be needing a sexual release. This morning John had not had time enough in the shower. Sherlock was sure about that. And John had not had time for himself, where he could have 'relieved himself'. Conclusion: John Watson had gone far too long without sex of any kind.
But John saw the hope in the eyes of the otherwise so closed Mycroft.
“He had told me to shower and take and enema. Of course I knew that the bet included a sexual favour, but the enema puzzled me a bit...and then he rimmed me. That is why I wanted to do it to you. It was...intense and overwhelming and I wanted you to have that experience as well.”
“Oh..... Believe me. I was cornered and had to find a way out. I could not kill Sherlock......you would never have forgiven me. But I had to make it look like I had tried to.....Oh John. I didn’t know I came so close to kill him. I avoided his heart, his lungs and his spleen and his intestines. Either that would have killed him instantly or later. Of course you know that if you shoot people in the area between and above the liver, you do not hit vital organs....you even avoid the kidney. But I must have ruptured the inferior vena cava....since Sherlock almost bled to death. I’m truly sorry John, but it was the only option I had.”
Sherlock smiled, “Yes...exactly! And even if we are geniuses, we do not posses such powers in the real world. Maybe this could have been done if you had been green or blue and had been an alien. But honestly Eurus....why? And one thing more: all those inconsistencies and improbabilities: why did you return to the prison? How did you transport me and John to Musgrave Mansion? How many men had you to build the false room around me and how did John get out of that well? For God's sake. You had just told that he was chained to the bottom? Why couldn't I distinguish between a dog and a boy? And honestly...if a boy had gone missing, wouldn't a lot of people have done quite an effort to find him? And I can assure you that Victor Trevor was very much alive, last time I spoke with him. No, Eurus.....as John said: sloppy writing...”
Ad then she put first one clamp on Mycroft's left nipple and then on his right. He closed his eyes and took some deep breaths...and whimpered a bit as she let the chain fall down on his stomach.

Mycroft laid down and looked up at the ceiling, taking care that only their hands did touch, “I'm such a pervert, Sherl. Wanting to fuck my own brother....as if it wasn't bad enough that we had to help each other the other way.”
Sherlock turned serious and nodded, “Why....why are you the way you are towards me? Do you hate me? Or love me? I'm just so confused.....and it might be the drugs, but I can't see how things are for real. Please...”

Hamish looked at the double grave and said, “It should be raining.”
And he rolled his shoulders, “....I'm not that hurt.... bodily. Are you serious? About my punishment? Because I think I got off the hook rather easily.”
And late at night John would be lying in his bed thinking everything all over again. A lot of almost sleepless nights. Thinking way back.....actually back to where he met Sherlock, and when Sherlock had to jump...and when John met Mary...or rather 'Rosemary', as it had turned out her name was. And John felt there...in the middle of the night, whilst Rosie was sound asleep in her bed, as if he was slowly waking up from a dream. A nightmare. And he didn't like that. Because what that 'waking-up' meant was that he could see himself from the outside point of view. How he had changed...from bad to worse. No wonder that Sherlock didn't want to see him any-more. John had brought Sherlock nothing but pain, suffering and loss. No...not the first month they had been together. Not then. John knew that he probably had saved Sherlock from taking that pill from that cabbie. But since?
John nodded. He could see the problem and the danger Sherlock had been in.
As John stopped, Sherlock pointed at John while he looked at Eurus, “And you made John into a bumbling side-kick of an incompetent soldier and doctor. Into a man who couldn't defend himself or others...or for that matter recognize dogs bones from the bones of a child! And I would never ignore a 'Vatican Cameos' from John. It has saved my life too many times.”
And that was the reason why both Sherlock and John had the best night of sleep for a long time, just being able to hear the other person's breath.....and in the morning John woke up to a Sherlock, who had done his best to imitate an octopus and John was sure that Sherlock had grown some extra limbs during the night.
And Rosie went over, removed the silent speaker from his hand and switched off the screen.
John thought for a moment and then said, “I think I would like you to begin with 'Mary'...”
And that was the time where Mary entered too and she was the one to answer, “That was unfortunately real enough. But you are not being accused of anything since you were drugged up to your eyeballs. It was in the IV. And you had mixed something together at Baker Street, because you had decided that you didn't want to live like that any more. Those chemicals were interfering with each other and you lost your grip on reality and you were dying. Still are. Your vitals are plain out crazy. We are trying to get them normal, but as soon as one is looking all right, the others go out of balance. And then we decided that you weren't safe there. Too many governmental agents snooping around. So Mrs. Hudson's niece's ex-husband had this flat, and here you are.”
John had kissed him and said, “Have I ever told you how happy I am that you are not a criminal?”
John looked at Mycroft: “I’m not going to faint or make a scene. But don’t you think we are in a bit of hurry?!”
“Colour?”, John barked.
John laughed a bit, “As your brother investigated further, he found out that I actually own a small piece of land at the back of beyond in Scotland. Nobody bothered to tell my father...and he would probably have sold it anyway to buy his booze.”
“Very well then. Undress and lie on the bed. But Sherlock... I’ve been thinking. Should we invite Mycroft?”
Mycroft began to giggle and said, “Oh God. That was intense. I'm almost tempted to ask you to take the needles out, let the wounds heal and have it done again.”
“But why Eastbourne?”
“Explain, please.”
Then Sherlock smirked and pointed at the picture of David’s head: “That is not how I look....my eyes are a lot smaller and my nose too.....” and then he pointed of the groin of the figure and said: “Well....and my penis is bigger!”
“The abbot in that monastery did teach me something very important: that the first victim, if you are hell-bent on revenge, would be your self...”
John shook his head, “No. That would be to have double standards wouldn't it? All the women I've been dating...and the men I have been in relation-ship with!”
___________________________
And then they tried to talk at the same time too, both stopped and John managed to say, “You first...” a fraction of a second before Sherlock said it.
“My memories of that summer are a bit muddled too, John. And remember....at that time I wasn't at home much as I was at boarding school. I have spoken with my parents lately and they confirm that yes, we did have a dog.”
And now John had the same feeling as he had had in the pool-room as he and Sherlock had been ignored by 'Moriarty'., or rather the actor playing that villain, who in reality had been Magnussen, because the attention of the angel was directed at his ...ear?! And the angel was talking to someone. And he lifted his hand and said, “Just a minute....”
“Why bring this up now, John? Did he tell you? You said that you had forgiven me?”
“She caned him?”
And then he suddenly had an expression of horror on his face, “Oh God. Mycroft is allowed to wear the tartan himself. Please tell me John, that he doesn’t plan on wearing a kilt as well....he hasn’t got the legs for it! It would bring the expression ‘thin hairy legs’ to new heights...or depths.”
Sherlock smiled back, “And here I was afraid that I might loose you as a friend after finally having you back again, if I confessed what I felt about you!”
She smiled and began to touch him, “I want you. This you. This strong and yet caring man. The real Mycroft. You are better at this 'hiding your real self' than your brother....and he is rather good at it too. To hide the real 'Sherlock' and 'Mycroft' behind your walls of defence. Him hiding behind his 'sociopath-mask' and you hiding behind your 'Ice-man' demeanour. You are such an amazing man, Mycroft Holmes, and I should have married you the first time I saw you...even if I would have been accused of 'robbing a cradle'. I am painfully aware that I'm 16 years older than you.....but I made the mistake of my life marrying that husband of mine.”
At that question John burst out laughing, “Oh my God. Sherlock...I always control myself around you. Not shouting at you....not yelling at you because of heads in the fridge...”
She smiled, “He really is. It has been a pleasure to finally meet you, John Watson, as a colleague.”
Sherlock nodded, “I agree. Tomorrow. After we have signed. That is, If you would still allow me?”
Finally later that evening, after yet another enema, and quite a lot of sex, including some more rimming, all three ended up in bed, cuddled under the duvet. Mycroft now with matching red stripes, courtesy of Sherlock’s skilful delivery of blows from a riding crop. It was Mycroft’s favourite implement next to the paddle. Mycroft had felt it was cathartic to allow Sherlock to get rid of his residual anger, and at the same time to take care of Mycroft’s needs. If John hadn’t called him earlier, Mycroft would have gone to one of his clubs.
The doctor looked at him and then he slowly said, “We once feared that we would make robots, that could take over the world. Defeat us humans...if they became too clever. Asimov's 4 robotic rules were build into robots for the same reason. ….....and I've read the 'Lancet' as well about 'development in enhancing the human body', until we suddenly couldn't read more about that. Did they continue that work? Without the government's knowledge? Building 'super-humans' instead of 'super-robots'?”
And John first looked at a picture attached to the front. It looked old and resembled Mycroft. Only that that man on the photo was absurdly obese. (imagine a picture of obese Mycroft from TAB)
During the very delicious dinner, and this time the whole dinner progressed according to the planned schedule, without a murder to be solved, Sherlock had leaned towards John and had whispered , with a mischievous glint in his eyes, “I know that it is not uncommon to 'go commando' under a kilt, but I'm not, though, even if my underwear could be called a bit inappropriate. I'm wearing a new set of those see-through dark blue lace pants, that you are so fond of. And I've borrowed a cock-ring in case my fine and antique sporran couldn’t keep everything in place......you know 'something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.”
When John finally let Sherlock’s face go, Sherlock looked up at John with almost the same expression he had had when John asked him to be his fist man.
“Where you returned and pretended that nothing had happened.” John shook his head and continued, “Why the fuck didn't you say anything? And your feet must have been killing you...and I, blind as always, didn't notice a damned thing!”
“Yes, Magnussen!”
Sherlock rose and went over to John with his usual feline grace and removed the cloth like a magician.
He turned his head again and looked at Mary, “You do know, that I was not even his real brother? I'm an experiment. A freak....a living human computer. My mother is not my mother, my father is not my father and my brothers were not my brothers. . I'm the first experimental child....born at Baskerville. Created in a laboratory. And things might have been a lot easier if they hadn't made me of a material that made me...handsome, fascinating and with the body of a Greek God. I do know how I look Mary. There are mirrors........and I looked like an angel, growing up. That is why......”
“While we were living together, you and I?”
“Well” said Sherlock and closed the folder: “It is in the past...there is no imminent treats against us for now. Mary is gone, killed by her own. She had killed her daughter.....and I’m sorry for the loss, John, because little baby Watson was an innocent victim of all this....and I wish we had known so timely that she could have been saved. The rest in this folder, both John and I know and you are here with me now, John, and I hope that I somehow can compensate for the time we have wasted being away from each other....and Mycroft, thank you for your visit, but John and I have some unfinished business to attend to. And will have to leave for the inner town in a short while.”
“Granted, you git...pathetic weak little slut, you are!” was the reply, but there was some machinery running and a clicking sound and Sherlock could feel the chain be slackened and he was now able to kneel with his arms bend at the elbows and resting against the wall. He could feel that blood was running down his back - and his buttocks and his thighs. He could easily imagine how his back looked like a bloody mess, but somehow he knew that it wasn’t over yet. He had had a glimpse of John’s list....and it was long!
Sherlock had first asked what John was doing in Berlin and why first now? And when John had said something about “making sure that his best friend was still alive and Mycroft had forbidden him to contact Sherlock and it had been Greg who had told about Sherlock’s injury”.... Sherlock had told him to leave and to stay away. That he couldn’t work if John kept on “popping in and out of his life”. Had told him “that he would have to live with and accept the choice he had made, just like Sherlock had “struggled to learn to live with it” and Sherlock had accused John of being extremely and maybe involuntarily cruel towards Sherlock. When John had objected to that and said that he had never intended to be that and that Sherlock on the other hand had been extremely cruel by making John see Sherlock jump back then.
And Sherlock was on his knees and hands again, presenting himself so shamelessly that John had to squeeze the base of his own cock to prevent himself from coming on the spot .
Mycroft looked directly at John, “I know that I've harmed him so much. But at least he is still alive and on the sane side of his mind. He has survived....even if 'barely' sometimes. So the outcome could have been so much worse. Not that that is an excuse on my side. Just a statement.”
And John obeyed and continued fondling with Sherlock's nipples as he mumbled something about 'topping from the bottom' and sucked and did bite a bit and used his mouth and tongue to drag in the small bars through Sherlock's nipples.....and Sherlock moaned and almost arched of the sofa. His nipples were always so sensitive.
And then I left. I didn't want him to be punished because of me.
As he rose to go upstairs to get dressed, he...a bit worried....asked Sherlock: “Does your brother know...about your absolutely “non-vanilla” taste in sex? You mentioned that he didn’t know about the clubs? I have most certainly no wish of being accused of being an abuser!”
Mycroft smiled back, “No wonder. It is a very nice arse.”
She smiled at him and said: “Damn....I owe Mycroft a box of that tea now. He said you would recognize it. I better give you one too....just to tease him!”
