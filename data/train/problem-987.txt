“I’d rather not,” he said, and Sherlock rolled his eyes and crossed his arms – like a child in the beginning stages of a tantrum.
“Thanks,” Harry whispered when they were out of Charles Augustus’ earshot but not quite yet into Archie’s.
want me to be his friend, whatever that entails, which inspired me to make it look like I was interested in his friendship so he’ll waste his question to me tomorrow.”
A hand grasped his shoulder, and John flinched, almost crying out, only to find that Mycroft was attached to the hand.
There was something that Sherlock didn’t like about him – something in the glint of his eyes beyond the ruthlessness necessary to survive the Games – but he couldn’t put his finger upon it before the attention shifted from him and back to President Snow.
Sherlock and Harry encounter a particularly disturbing sector of the Arena; Sherlock and Harry have a heart-to-heart, while John tries to have one with Mycroft.
But, of course, that did not happen. The entire house stood still, apart from the five people who had just entered through the front door, just as it had for the last three weeks. No sound could be heard – no movement from upstairs, no water running in the kitchen, nothing – other than the sounds of their own breathing. Wait, that wasn’t all – there was the quiet sound of sniffling – someone was crying –
“It’s about time you showed up – I thought the three of us were going to have to play a game of hide-and-go-seek...well, two and a half, really,” Magnussen said, glancing down at Harry.
Meanwhile, John only made it a few steps before realizing that Sherlock was no longer by his side, and he spun back around.
Mycroft went for the center door first. He glanced up at the digital message above the keypad: _ _ _ _ LOCKED, and then surveyed the keypad itself and noted which of the numbers were worn away by the repeated touch of people’s hands. After a moment, he cursed in frustration; the password had been changed a few times over the years.
The book was finally finished in March, just before John’s twentieth birthday, and, on the night of John’s birthday, after weeks of false starts and questions and troubleshooting, Sherlock and John were finally able to put the condoms and lubricant Mycroft had supplied them with nearly a year before to use, and, eight months, sixteen days, five hours, thirty-two minutes, and forty-nine seconds since Mycroft had passed, the two boys had sex for the very first time. It hurt a bit (well, a lot if Sherlock was completely honest with himself), just because both of them had difficulties calming down enough to relax, but once they did everything sort of fell into place, and it was good. It was right, for the first time in their lives.
“And it breaks my heart that one of them is gone. And...I know he’s gone, but I’m still waiting for it to all be a joke, and for him to walk through the doors at any moment – even though he’s literally right there – he’s right in front of me –” she sobbed, gesturing to the casket before her. But then, as she took a breath, as she calmed herself down enough to make it through the last part of her speech, she took a second to glance at the doors to the auditorium, as if to make her point. “And, in the back of my mind, I know it’s not going to happen. But I’ll probably be watching the doors for a long, long time. Just in case.”
“After I, you know, died in the Arena and came back, when I woke up in the maze there was an arrow sticking out of the hedges, and you said you had seen something while under the influence of the tracker jacker venom. Can I ask what you saw?”
Sherlock took off the glasses and looked again between them and Magnussen. “Right,” he mumbled. Of course they were. Of course, because –
He looked up at John, daring him to say that it was going to be alright or that he could do this. Because it wasn’t going to be alright and he
He could still hear the bitterness in Sherlock’s words, and he glanced at him, wondering if maybe he was also remembering that conversation. As if Sherlock could feel John’s eyes on him, he looked up and met his eyes, and John thought the words at him before he could look away.
It was during this party that Harry plucked up the courage to ask Louise Neal out on a date. By the end of the month, the two were officially girlfriends, and neither girl could be happier, and while Sherlock and John were happy for both of them, it didn’t stop them from giving Louise a speech similar to the one Mycroft had given to John when he and Sherlock became a couple. Once their relationship status became official, Louise started taking the train down to District 12 once a week to see Harry (seeing as Harry couldn’t leave 12 to go see Louise in District 9 due to school), staying in Harry’s room for a couple of nights before returning home until next time. Louise’s presence caused Harry’s grades in school to suffer a little, but that only caused them to go back to a little better than what they were before the Games, so John didn’t make a big deal out of it.
“Nice touch, saying that you were in love with him more than ever,” Mycroft murmured lowly in John’s ear once the press let them go to enjoy the after party.
go in for a hug at this point. Harry had oozed confidence as she asked her question to Hannibal, and she knew that he was watching her just as much as he was watching Sherlock – she wasn’t going to go crawling back to her brother and her brother’s boyfriend now and beg for them to hug her and hold all of her broken pieces of together – that would just prove to him that she was terrified of him.
“No – it’s not a step back,” Sherlock said, cutting him off. “We’re just standing still for a bit. It’s nothing we can’t get through.”
“Look, I know what you’re trying to do – I can see that you’re trying to help me and prevent a second attack, and I appreciate it. But the last thing I want is for one of your friends to – to... We’ve all won the Games – we’ve all killed people – What are they going to think when I’ve killed people too and now, suddenly, I can’t even go piss by myself? What are we going to say when they ask us why I can’t just go to the bathroom alone like a normal person?”
“I wish you could have, too. But then again, if our parents were still alive, Sherlock would not have needed a place to stay, and he would never have been in that bakery in hopes of getting free food which, from what I’ve been told, is where you plucked up the courage to reach out to him, am I correct?”
As soon as they were out of sight, vanishing in the crowd of Capitol citizens who had also decided to make an appearance at the park that day, Sherlock turned around, looking up at the statue of Mycroft Holmes.
“Just follow my lead. Don’t do anything unless I do, do you understand?” Mycroft asked quietly as they walked closer and closer to the gates to the mansion, manned by two Peacekeepers armed with large black guns.
In moments, Sherlock’s hands had found John and Mycroft’s, and Sherlock watched as John held onto Harry’s. As much as Sherlock wanted to scream, to yell at them to never call him William again and tell everyone their secrets, he kept his mouth shut – that was the safest thing to do.
Tears blurred what little he could see of John’s face, and he repeated the words over again, just like John had told him to.
“I have no idea,” Sherlock lied. He knew exactly what it was about – Hannibal just wanted to see Sherlock squirm with the knowledge that
“NO!” Sherlock shouted, finally finding his voice, and before he knew exactly what he was doing, he was on his feet and running down the aisle. “No – John stop –”
“We’ll be stopping any moment, boys – Oh!” Mrs. Hudson cried, covering her mouth with both of her hands. Sherlock and John jumped away from each other in the same moment, startled by the fact that she had caught them during the intimate moment. After a second, she lowered her hands, a grin replacing her surprised expression. “Sorry for interrupting, but there will be plenty of time for that later! John’s got a speech to make!”
“And you’ll find it?” John asked as Sherlock exited the bathroom and turned the bedroom’s light off as he passed the switch.
“Because we had to play the Game for too long,” John replied. “Everyone got tired and nobody wanted to play anymore.”
But Sherlock couldn’t sleep – not with knowing for a fact that John had never slept alone since the Games. They had tried to sleep by themselves once, when they realized the Victory Tour meant that they would be without each other for two weeks, and Sherlock stayed up, watching John’s bedroom window from his own, until John showed up at his front door at three in the morning. “I’ll probably be able to do it once I know I just can’t walk next door and find you,” John muttered once they got to Sherlock’s room, and promptly fell asleep. As soon as they knew that Sherlock would be going on the Tour with John, plans for John sleeping by himself were obliterated, until now.
– left Sherlock alone. He was still tired – tired for the first time in his life, probably – but he kept walking. Harry wasn’t a Holmes – she would have to sleep sometime – as long as she was in front of him, he’d catch up with her eventually, as long as he kept walking.
John Watson, victor of the 74th Hunger Games, prepares to go on the Victory Tour; Sherlock is invited to come along; John and Sherlock get a taste of what the Capitol thinks of Johnlock.
He could feel Harry shrug. “What are sisters for?” she replied, and Sherlock remembered what she had said to him, back in the Arena:
“Welcome, Harriet – and welcome back, John! How are you doing, since the last time we talked?” Caesar asked, and John dropped his bomb.
“I hope he drowns,” he muttered, the thought of Magnussen bringing back the memories John fought to keep away.
The two boys woke up to someone knocking on the bedroom door. Sherlock had the instinct to roll over, to throw his pillow at the door, and to tell Mycroft to fuck off, but the thought of the fact that it definitely wasn’t Mycroft at the door shot Sherlock out of bed completely.
“Your hands are sweating,” Hannibal noted. “My brother suffers from the same condition; the whole world is wet to his touch.”
“Where is he?” he nearly growled, and the two guards glanced at each other, both of them obviously hoping the other would know what exactly he meant. He then realized these two guards were not the same ones from that morning, and rephrased his question. “John Watson, victor of the Seventy-Fourth Hunger Games; I know you know who
Once Sherlock and John had started sleeping together in the same bed, Sherlock had mentioned at one point that John had a habit of angrily muttering to himself if he tossed and turned during a sleepless night.
“Because he wanted your reactions to everything to be authentic, so no one would have any idea that there was a rebellion, or that either of you were part of it,” Dean explained, and Harry nodded in understanding. “But during the final interview, Mycroft sent the parents of Athena McAllister to check in on your parents, just in case the consequences of the interview was enough to affect them. If you remember, Anthea was the other Tribute from District Twelve who entered the Arena opposite Mycroft –”
“Come in,” said a voice from within, almost Capitol-like in nature, and Sherlock opened the door without a single glance back at Dean.
“I can do that,” Sherlock replied, and he kissed him again. “I know that I can’t take it away or make it better but...I can try, right?”
And the boy who almost killed Mycroft, years and years ago, ready to try again to kill a Holmes boy.
“The answer is simple: not for power, and not to prove I could, but to protect her. If Mischa was reaped, she would have died in the Hunger Games and I would have nothing of her. Now I have her – all of her – here with me, at all times. Which, I believe, is a far better fate than burying her underground, never to know her again.”
“We didn’t know what you liked,” Alexander said him, popping off the top and revealing a dinner plate full of delicious-looking Capitol food. “It’s not like we could’ve asked Sherlock.”
Harry kissed his forehead, pushing his bloody, matted hair out of the way, sitting back up to find that his eyes were indeed beginning to open and look around as he gasped for air. “Oh my god you’re alive, you’re alive –”
Instead of responding, Hannibal took a few steps forward, just close enough to pick up Sherlock’s dog tags from the nightstand beside him (the Capitol’s doctors must have taken it off of him at some point before the surgery). Sherlock reached out to try to take the necklace back from Hannibal, but Hannibal raised his hand, studying the tags as they dangled right in front of his face.
John Watson and the man Sherlock recognized to be Alexander Waters shot at the Peacekeepers, and Harry Watson rushed to the sides of the two Holmes boys as Sherlock leaned back and pressed his hand to Mycroft’s wound.
“For your information, I’m normally given paperwork to fill out about my tributes that I complete on the train. I don’t
No one that currently stood in the Holmes’ house had ever witnessed a Quarter Quell (Mycroft was only a year old during the last Quarter Quell, and therefore it didn’t count), yet they all knew what the Quarter Quell was. When the Hunger Games were created, it was decided that every twenty-five years the milestone would be marked with a “Quarter Quell,” to refresh the memories of Panem of why the Hunger Games were made and of the people who were killed in the name of rebellion. Those years’ Games would have a mystery giant wrench thrown into the mix, chosen by the very first Gamemakers; something that changed everything and turned the Games on its head. Between the twenty-five year intervals, the Quarter Quell was rarely mentioned, unless the Capitol’s attention was upon a victor from one of the Quells. It wasn’t even mentioned in the Districts that didn’t hold one of the two victors. Other than that, Sherlock and John knew virtually nothing about it.
But he so wanted to hold their hands – to remind everyone of what the Games were doing to them – what the Capitol’s Games meant to them.
Alexander led the way, as he was probably the only one who knew where they were going, and Harry – red tea-length dress and matching pumps and all – ran directly behind him. John brought up the rear, ensuring that she didn’t fall too far behind.
“He’d also want you to forgive yourself,” Louise replied, and then, with a half-smile, she was gone, and they were all being whisked away to the dinner that John really did not want to attend.
He couldn’t lose himself, yet – the memorial service – Mycroft’s memorial service – was in just a few hours. Sherlock’s day had only just begun.
The next hour was one of the worst in Mycroft’s life. Everything in him was telling him to leave Sherlock and Harriet to deal with Mrs. Hudson, to find John and ensure he was safe. However, the only thing he could do was sit at the dining room table with Sherlock, Harry, Mrs. Hudson, their stylists, and their prep teams, half-listening to Mrs. Hudson’s complaints, and eat with the appetite that he had long lost. Once every few minutes, his eyes landed on his brother’s ice blue ones, and he attempted to smile at him like he used to when they were younger, as if they had a secret they were keeping from the rest of the world. This time, though, that wasn’t the case; this time, Mycroft was keeping a world of secrets from Sherlock, and from everyone else in that room.
But, Sherlock had always told John everything that kept him up at night before, and if he didn’t say it now, he would only find himself telling him at some other point in time.
By the time John reached the address of the Capitol man and banged on his door, his plan of being nice had been completely been dismantled, with no hope for a return.
John was awakened by a kiss on the cheek from a fully-clothed Sherlock, which he gladly accepted, but he was thankful that Sherlock had decided not to kiss him full on the mouth to wake him up.
Normally, especially now, knowing what he knew of Magnussen and what he did to John, Sherlock would’ve been more cautious, making sure John was okay with him kissing and touching him, letting John lead their actions and following them – but this time was different. They led each other, taking turns in showing each other what was okay and what wasn’t. There was no stopping and no hesitation, tonight, because they were alive, both of them were, and – within the four walls of that room, within the confines of that bed – nothing else mattered but that.
John’s ears burned with Snow’s words. He had gotten Snow’s hint, loud and clear: if he wasn’t going to choose, or if he chose Sherlock over his sister, Snow was going to have
“There were things that Mycroft needed help with – things that you couldn’t have possibly helped him with. Mentor things; I knew locations and the right people and the rules of the Games –”
“But would they have done the things they did if there were no Games to begin with?” Harry asked. “Snow wouldn’t have the Games to run and Moriarty wouldn’t have been inspired to put himself into the Arena and Magnussen...” Sherlock didn’t need to look at Harry to know what she was thinking of: if there were no Games, Hannibal Lecter Magnussen wouldn’t have won the second Quarter Quell, and then Charles Augustus Magnussen wouldn’t have felt like he had the authority to hurt people without consequence – and then he wouldn’t have been able to hurt John.
Sherlock's confidant, like he was Mycroft's - John and Harry are. It's clear that Dean does not know Sherlock, and definitely doesn't know Sherlock's limitations and boundaries.
Archie kept counting, quietly, as Sherlock kneeled down and Archie climbed off his back. Sherlock started getting antsy by the eighth cannon blast – how many people had died?
“He loves you so much, you know, John does,” she said quietly as she put the fluid in his system and removed the needle. “I can see it in his eyes. He’s never looked at anyone the way he looks at you.”
“Yes you are,” Hannibal agreed, and they shook hands once more, and parted ways, Mycroft pulling John along with him.
But he had – years and years ago – or months, at least – on the screen – in a Hunger Games from years ago –
John did not remember the journey from the City Circle to the sponsors’ office, but he imagined that Mycroft had led him there. Before he knew it, he was drinking a whiskey (provided by Mycroft), and watching Sherlock’s brother as he went through the options of what items to send Sherlock and Harry on a large touch screen attached to the wall.
Back to that time, to that bed – back before then, even. Back before Mycroft was shot. Back before Mycroft killed Snow. Back before Sherlock saved himself and Harry. Back before they were sent into the Games. Back before the first time Sherlock and John kissed. Back before Sherlock sent the iris to the Capitol. Back before the moment John was reaped. Back before Mycroft was reaped.
“Hello, John,” he said, his voice annoyingly calm, even though he looked a tad bit aggravated with the fact that Dean was now president of Panem. Harry stepped forward, trying to put herself between him and John, and his attention instantly flicked to her. “And you must be Harriet Watson, I don’t believe we’ve met –”
“How’s Caesar Flickerman doing, by the way?” Sherlock asked, after a moment. “Last I heard from President Bainbridge he was in good spirits.”
“Well, if memory serves me correctly, your brother, Cal, lost a game of chicken with Roger Stem; isn’t that true?” James glared at Magnussen, and Magnussen grinned. “I thought so.”
“It was obvious...from his cane – he needs it sometimes when he’s having a hard day, since his leg got...you know. And my brother...he kept looking at him weird, like he was trying to monitor him, trying to make sure he was alright – he’s given me the same look practically all my life; I know it well. That also tipped me off – told me that Mycroft knew something that I didn’t, something he was worried about. And John had lost his appetite, and he normally only does that when something’s wrong – or when he’s too far into his own head to do anything about it.”
“My parents would still be alive,” Harry mumbled, and through the dim light, Sherlock could see the tears rolling down her face.
It's also been a bit of a week - I got my first kiss? At twenty-five years of age? And second base happened? I'm very confused (and also very excited) for this turn of events. (If anyone's curious, I got scared and overwhelmed and cried - no one who knows me personally is surprised at all by that.) But anyways, chapter!
John watched as Sherlock swayed back and forth, switching the weight between his feet, staring straight ahead, almost looking as if he was dancing with nerves, just as he had done moments before the Victory Tour interview last winter. He also imagined Sherlock had done this moments before he joined the stage last year, before he saw John for the first time since he won the Games. It was a thing about Sherlock John loved – one of his favorite quirks about him – one that would never exist again after tomorrow. He desperately wanted to touch his hand – to give his boyfriend some sort of comfort – but there was no more comfort for John to give.
After about six hours, Sherlock could feel himself start to come down from the high, and briefly contemplated running back up to the penthouse to shoot up again under the guise of going to the bathroom, but then John Watson’s name was called, and Sherlock wished he had thought of running off to shoot up again earlier.
“Do you have a pen?” he asked, and the guard quickly provided him with one, leading Sherlock through the packet, telling him where to print his name and write his initials and where to, finally, sign Hannibal Lecter Magnussen’s life away.
“What?” he asked. “What are you talking about? ‘What was waiting for him at the Capitol’ – what does that mean?”
“No!” Sherlock protested from his place John’s bed, but John let him in despite that. “You’re on this ride all the time – why are
And so he went to the Seam, to the shack that still looked the same as when he left it, inside and out, and there, among the old beds and the curtains their mother had sewn to create “rooms” for her boys and the old wood stove that had been cold for years – Sherlock finally opened the letter and read the pages that Mycroft had written specifically for him:
“No, I mean – back then, when we were kids,” John went on. “I thought that once Mycroft’s Games were over, you’d go your way and I’d go mine. Even if he didn’t win, I figured you’d find a way to survive without us – or once you thought you were old enough to live on your own you’d just move out and never look our way again. I’d never thought we’d be close. I never thought I’d fall in love with you.”
John was still shaking from the shock of what had happened, but he pressed on down the hallway full of empty cells, seeing it for the first time, feeling sick to his stomach.
“What makes you think something happened?” he asked, and Sherlock could tell as soon as the words passed John’s lips he regretted saying them, but that didn’t stop Sherlock from voicing his deductions.
“Ah, yes. The merchant goes to District Four and is perfectly fine. Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason...”
The promises to keep would be the promises to John that he would save him and get him out of the Capitol safe and alive, and the miles to go would be everything Mycroft would have to go through to keep his promises until he's able to rest, but by the time the narrative reaches him he just has the poem to remind him of his plans failed, and that he cannot win, this time.
“Mycroft and I...we were...” he started, trying to figure out how to word it, and finally he sighed. “It’s complicated.”
Once Sherlock saw John waving at him, he walked over to them, saying hello to Louise (who must have arrived while he was gone), and sat next to John, and before either of them could speak, before John could ask him what Dean wanted or for Sherlock to ask what he had missed, Dean walked out from the backstage area onto the stage.
John hadn’t thought about that. Of course, he knew about the two details – the fact that he had gone into the stairwell to find Sherlock and that he was assaulted by Magnussen in said stairwell – but he never thought about the correlation between the two events.
“John –” Sherlock tried again, shaking his head, trying to tell John that it was no use – that he couldn’t be grounded – that this was too big – but John had given him the same arguments, and they both knew that he had been wrong.
Sherlock paced the lobby, as Louise stood, leaning up against the wall next to the entrance to the auditorium, her arms crossed.
Before the results, John gives the "they'd be just as in love with him as I am" speech that is given in The Article. He adds the quote that I just barely was able to fit into Constantly's new context: "If they lock you up they might as well take me too, because I'm gonna fucking lose it without you."
The moment Sherlock reached Archie’s platform, Archie pointed at his assigned weapon – an ax the size of the boy’s entire body.
And he was right – now that he had said it, Sherlock could tell he was struggling to make his words sound just as articulate as they used to be, but only someone who listened to Hannibal everyday – or Sherlock – could truly notice the difference on their own. Sherlock looked Hannibal up and down, and noticed he was also having difficulty standing on his own two feet, but, as evident by the empty chair in his cell, his pride wouldn’t let him speak to Sherlock while seated.
“And they’re not even done yet,” Louise added as Charles Augustus killed Abigail Reeves, who was dressed in silver, as if the Capitol was making sure everyone knew she was the oldest tribute in the Games.
“Not so fast,” Dean cut Sherlock off, placing his hand on the door to keep Sherlock from closing it. “He’s made some demands.”
“It’s understandable,” John said, crossing the room and sitting in front of Sherlock, kissing him gently on the lips. “Hey,” he murmured once they parted.
And then, at that moment, as if the Gamemakers were waiting for the group to realize where Steven and Julia were, Julia slapped her arm, wincing in pain.
His body decided that then would be the best time to puke, right on the floor beside him, trying to expel Magnussen’s spit from the inside of his mouth, but even the taste of stomach acid and that morning’s breakfast couldn’t mask the taste of Charles Augustus Magnussen.
He had been right, of course – the Quell should have been enough to create a rift between the mentors’ relationships – to create a rift in the rebellion itself – but it hadn’t. And, after all they had been through, even the people who weren’t there to listen to Mycroft’s words that day were understanding and forgiving. They all understood that everyone in the room had lost someone, whether it had been the night of the rebellion or during the Games, and they let them grieve in their own way, even if it took away focus from their own loss.
Harry was exceptionally talented in the obstacle course. As Archie climbed up and down the rope wall (the only thing he really enjoyed doing within the confines of the room), Sherlock kept an eye on Harry as she bounced from station to station, always finding her way back to the obstacle course. She continuously tore through it in the shortest amount of time, sometimes beating her score, sometimes not, but she was always above everyone else. The person in second place was Charles Augustus Magnussen, despite his old age, surprising even Sherlock. Sherlock would’ve been in third, or maybe even in second place, but he ran through it with Archie, which landed him in the five-minute area, as opposed to Harry’s under-a-minute.
He felt another sting, and began to wobble on his feet, but he swung again, wanting to aim for her face but he couldn’t find it – he cut her stomach open instead.
“It’s the memorial,” Sherlock replied before John could, and John eyed Sherlock wearily, as if he was asking him ‘are we actually going to have this conversation with him
The “Theme Song” Harry makes for Sherlock with the Jabberjays is literally like an acapella version of the BBC Sherlock Theme idk if that was obvious or not
and I just…I let it happen, because I wanted it more than I wanted to admit that something might’ve been seriously wrong,” John said, putting his head in his hands for a moment, and Sherlock could feel the anger dissipating from John, leaving only worry and disappointment – not disappointment in Sherlock, but in himself – behind. “How long, Sherlock?” he finally asked, looking up again.
And John was watching Sherlock as he flipped through John’s abandoned mentor manifesto, remembering the last time either of them had picked up the book – almost two weeks ago, they were in this very room, but their positions were reversed; Sherlock was standing in the doorway to the bathroom, and John was in bed with the manifesto.
“Just don’t...don’t treat me differently. Like I’m going to freak out or fall to pieces anytime you kiss me, okay?” John asked.
He was alive. He was supposed to die yesterday – but there he was. He was alive and well, back in the Capitol with Harry Watson by his side –
“How often does this happen?” he asked, gesturing to the screen. “How often does someone get raped in the Arena?”
And for just a second, Sherlock was glad he wasn’t going to ever have to face John again – he couldn’t, not with what he had just done.
Also, thank you so much for the comments on my previous chapters! I may not always answer but I do always read them, and I kind of live for them. So thank you. ^^
Even though Sherlock wanted nearly more than anything to go lock himself in his room and shoot up once the three returned to the penthouse, John had other plans.
Before placing Sherlock’s plate on the table, Hannibal laid a blank piece of paper before Sherlock, and placed a black pen on top of it.
“What, are you going to do what you did to that Holmes kid back at the Capitol? Spill our secrets?” she asked, scoffing. “Here’s a news flash: I don’t give a shit who knows what about me.”
So I wrote out Not Enough AU thinking that was the True and Only Sad AU for this story, but I've been considering other possibilities for Sad Endings (really they're all outcomes of changing the same four events) and I so cannot write them out I want to be ~done~ with this universe once I finish Advantage (Mycroft's story) so I thought I'd give you all a little look into what the other Sad AUs entail:
As he said these last words, he glanced up at Sherlock, and it took everything within him to hold his gaze. The look in his eyes wasn’t accidental –
If Sherlock’s love hadn’t saved him, would he still be in this room, just for the same reason as Alexander? John then felt an overwhelming appreciation for his boyfriend, who, when John revealed his residual limb to him for the first time, treated John the way he always had. He loved him no matter what he lost or where he was in his head. And he was so,
“Mycroft Holmes was a great man, but he was also a good man. He was always there for us whenever we needed him; got to know us and stayed with us when no one else did. He effectively saved thousands of lives and so many future generations from what we’ve had to go through. He was willing to make that sacrifice for us – he wanted to be the one to do the bulk of the work so the Peacekeepers would want his head, not ours. He always said that caring is not an advantage, but he never said that he didn’t care. He very rarely admitted it out loud, and he only did so to a few people, but he cared about all of us deeply and complexly. But, most of all, he cared about his younger brother, Sherlock Holmes, who I’ll give the stage to now, so he may say a few words and his final goodbyes to his brother.”
He was just a man, one that had probably never been truly seen in his life, one that had been taught to idolize people like him and Sherlock from birth, one that had been faced with doing what was right and doing what continued to get him attention from a celebrity. Of course he chose the latter.
“Go stand on the platform,” John ordered gently, pulling himself away from Sherlock, and Sherlock obliged.
“Yes; we’re doing things a little bit differently this year. This bag holds your survival supplies; food, water, a jacket, a small medical kit, etcetera. Your bag lacks weapons; those will only be provided once you’re in the Arena. That’s all I’m allowed to say,” he concluded, holding out the pack for Sherlock to take.
“Yeah, but let’s not make a big deal out of it – Magnussen’s a tribute; we were going to have to deal with him sooner or later. Let me worry about telling him, alright?”
“But no one knows about...” Mycroft dropped his voice, eyes darting around the room, as if everyone wasn’t staring at them already. “...
The traps became fewer and farther between by sundown, and by the time night fell completely, darkening the jungle, there were no traps at all. Sherlock was thankful, happy he wouldn’t have to wander around in the night trying to steer himself clear of the nets and pulleys and things that would yank him up into a tree with no hope for escape.
“I’m absolutely pissed,” John whispered to his sister, as they stood side by side and watched the tributes from District 11 – John and Elizabeth Smallwood, with their brother, Duncan – with Caesar on the backstage screen.
“You said something about a meeting, and considering that someone from District One was calling you, not just anyone but the brother of a girl who lived next door to the Magnussen brothers – which, geographically, made her an easy target – it wasn’t a very difficult leap to make,” Sherlock explained, shrugging, and for a moment he sounded like his usual self. He missed making deductions – he missed making those leaps.
“You okay, John?” Louise asked, signing her question for Clover so she could understand and be part of the conversation.
All of their blood on his hands, when none of them had to die. He would never be clean of it – he would never be free of it.
After another day of Hannibal lying to Will and Will acting for Hannibal, it came down to the final two. This was when Will let his layers fall away, and showed Hannibal who he really was – an intelligent thirteen-year-old with thoughts and words beyond his years which were spoken aloud in a voice that cracked at the thought of puberty. His eyes saw everything, but couldn’t look Hannibal in the face; his hands shook, yet he disguised it behind his flapping. John couldn’t help but find Will to be beautiful in his moment of greatness – his moment of outsmarting Hannibal Lecter Magnussen. Will had that same unorthodox beauty that Sherlock had; that beauty that was impossible to place; he was beautiful like how finding the irises was beautiful – beautiful like how the idea of freedom was beautiful.
I was going to write a scene where Lavinia reunites with her family, and she has a new little brother who’s like three and literally did not exist until
Finally, once they were all ready to go, Sherlock explained the situation as they boarded the elevator (not having enough time to take the stairs).
“Completely wiped out? So did we. Mycroft was the one who figured it out; the Capitol was showing the same roll of film whenever District Thirteen had to be mentioned, so he looked into it and apparently during the Dark Days the Capitol made the deal with Thirteen that if they stopped attacking them they could become entirely independent from Panem. This whole time they were living underground, and the Capitol destroyed what the District had been to scare all of us into submission.”
Sherlock also wanted to go home – John could tell by the way he wouldn’t stop fidgeting. While they were stood off-stage, hand in hand, waiting for Caesar Flickerman to call them forward, Sherlock swayed back and forth, switching the weight between his feet, staring straight ahead. It almost looked as if he was dancing with nerves. John squeezed Sherlock’s hand, and Sherlock snapped out of his trance, looking down at John.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Caesar Flickerman announced, his voice sounding empty and upset, like he never thought he’d announce it but there he was: “Sherlock Holmes is dead.”
Ten. Ten people had died during the Bloodbath. But the Bloodbath was over, now, and they had survived.
he had said, when asking Sherlock to bring it up to Mrs. Hudson), and Sherlock agreed. Mrs. Hudson didn’t give much of an argument once Sherlock assured her that she can put
The lobby looked similar to the way things were outside – injured Capitol citizens and rebels being treated by Avoxes. Stray shoes and headdresses and pieces of expensive outfits that had been lost in the shuffle and busted cameras littered the floor, and the five of them shuffled around them. As they passed, the injured and the Avoxes looked up, and some of the Capitol citizens who were close enough to their friends whispered to each other, but John ignored them.
And finally, near midnight (one day, three hours, fifty-one minutes, and fifty-eight seconds after his brother’s death), he was done.
“You’re thinner than when you left me, Will. I thought I asked you to eat while you were gone,” Hannibal said, looking Sherlock over before turning back to his work.
Harry looked back at John to exchange looks with him, but something over John’s shoulder caught her eye, instead. John turned his head to follow her gaze, and found three Peacekeepers – three real Peacekeepers – that had caught onto their trail, and were closing on them fast, uninhibited by heels and prosthetic legs.
“But Mycroft did make sure to give you a piece of cake,” Alexander went on, pointing at the piece of red velvet cake on his plate.
They started running, all holding hands – John in the front, and Sherlock taking up the rear – pushing and weaving their way through the crowd, trying to find Mycroft or Alexander or anyone who could help them –
“This is it?” John asked the woman, and she nodded. John looked at Sherlock. “There’s eleven floors for us to get through. Are you sure you want to do this?”
“What else?” Sherlock asked. “We’re going to kill each other. That’s what they want – we’re going to give it to them.”
“What are we doing?” John asked, once they were out of sight and the music was quieted by the distance between them and the stage and the building between them.
Hannibal smirked. “It already has. You’ve won the Hunger Games; do you honestly think someone who didn’t approve of murder could do such a thing?”
“I’m on my way to the hiding place – I have Fire and Heart with me – Mind is still somewhere in the audience, I repeat: I have Fire and Heart, Mind still needs to be found!”
“Sorry,” Mycroft said, and glanced at the group of six victors across the room, speaking to only each other and watching them. “It's a shame Mr. Waters couldn't make it; what was it he had, again?”
“If it’s important I need to know, Sherlock,” he said, and Sherlock looked back up at the new president of Panem.
But, because President Snow and the Gamemakers were a bunch of self-absorbed, inconsiderate bastards, John was here, watching this all happen, seven floors above them, with Louise Neal to hold his hand and Alexander Waters to put his hands on John’s shoulders in solidarity, because they knew – everyone knew – that John should’ve been there, too.
“So is yours,” Julia said, pointing at the lump that was forming on his neck – both of them already the size of their fists. “We need to get out of here –” she started, slapping another one off of her face and taking two steps in the direction they were going –
, but that’s beside the point. The point is that, going by that logic, you think you own John because you did something to him. But you didn’t sleep with him – he would’ve told me immediately as opposed to my brother exclusively, so it’s obviously sexual assault –” He suddenly froze, his next words halting in his throat.
“Fuckin’ Benjamin Coleman – but he was bigger and he was going to hurt us both for being gay – me especially, because I dated his sister. The whole time something in the back of my head told me that it wasn’t real – that he wasn’t put in the Arena, but it seemed so real I thought that if I didn’t do something he would hurt us. And I couldn’t actually get up so it was shoot him with an arrow or...find out if it was real or not the hard way. It was...rough.”
Sherlock opened his eyes, expecting for the story to be over, but John continued, slowly trying to calm himself down from within as he spoke:
“Thanks for not killing me to get me out of the Games,” Harry said, a sly smile on her face. “I mean, it would’ve been really counter-intuitive if you did. And with the fact that I won? Embarrassing. Absolutely insulting, actually.”
They sat in near-silence, after that, watching the people who had left the room for intermission return, once more, or not at all, if they felt as if they didn’t know Mycroft well enough to be there.
“CONGRATULATIONS!” Harry exclaimed, bouncing up and down, and John put his head in his hands, unable to stifle his amused smile.
“Oh my god –” John cut Mycroft off, completely in shock. The idea of Sherlock Holmes knowing that whatever they were planning on doing the night before required lube seemed unbelievable in itself, let alone the fact that he even knew what a condom
It didn’t matter that apparently the Districts “deserved” the Games for rebelling all those years ago. John thought back to his best friend’s Morphling addiction that he developed out of fear of being reaped, Harry that night with her bottle of whiskey, the terrors that haunted John’s dreams every night, and Mycroft’s face as he stood over the tribute he had killed in his Games and knew that no one could ever deserve a pain as deep as this.
When Sherlock returned from his judgment with the Gamemakers, John immediately dropped his gaze, hiding behind the mentor manifesto – a booklet that had quickly become his new best friend over the last twenty-four hours.
There was no answer, and so Sherlock knocked again. The door was unlocked, but he didn’t dare burst in.
“How kind of them,” John muttered, and then looked up at Mycroft. “…What about you?” he asked quietly, not really wanting to know the answer, but needing to know it all the same.
John and Mycroft react to Sherlock and Harry's win, but receive a troubling request from President Snow; Sherlock and Harry board the hovercraft and are returned to the Capitol; John takes a stand.
“You know how they want me to find a talent? So they can parade me around during events?” John asked.
Sherlock’s morphling addiction may have saved him in the Arena, but now his old habit was working against him.
He looked up, and saw three people approaching from the other end of the hallway – two men with guns, and a girl in a dress –
Somewhere, in the distance, he could hear gunshots, and he wasn’t sure if they were real or if they were just in his head.
It was then he closed the distance between them and wrapped his arms around her. She was surprised, at first, but then returned the hug.
Mycroft had asked, and John remembered being so caught off guard by Mycroft’s sudden authoritative tone – something that he had heard Mycroft use in the past but never directed at him, until now. And, for the first time ever, John realized that, since he was in a romantic relationship with Sherlock Holmes, while he wouldn’t have to deal with any overprotective fathers like he had in his previous relationships, he
For months after finding Sherlock’s morphling, John refused to let Sherlock do anything beyond kissing. At first, Sherlock thought it might’ve had something to do with John’s flashbacks to what Charles Augustus Magnussen had done to him, but he quickly learned that it had more to do with the fact that Sherlock had only done anything sexual with John while he was high. Fortunately, making the book together seemed to help them grow closer on that front, as well. John learned to trust Sherlock by himself again, and Sherlock learned to talk about his feelings with John, instead of bottling it up or trying to distract him with other things.
There was another rustle from behind him – another one after that, forty-five degrees from the last one, another shadow, then another rustle –
this is the same thing!” Sherlock shouted over the bird’s call that sounded so much like John that it made his heart ache – but he knew better. “As you pointed out earlier, the Capitol can make practically anything with their technology – the Capitol has so many sound clips of John that it’s not even funny at this point – he’s said our names – they can splice a few clips together to make him say anything else they need him to say – up the volume and the pitch and then you get –”
All the screens in Panem went dark after Dean’s announcement, and it remained that way. Sherlock had no idea the broadcasts carried so much noise. It was so quiet without the screens filling up the world with sound. There were no words that needed to be spoken between the four of them, not really – not any that could fix what had been done or change it in any way. It was quiet all throughout the Capitol – they could all stand on top of the roof and actually hear themselves think. There were no parties to be had – the Capitol was too much in shock to celebrate such freedom in such a way – the whole world was.
The four attend the reaping ceremony; Sherlock and Harry say goodbye to Mr. and Mrs. Watson; Harry gets an unexpected visitor; Mycroft is concerned about District 1’s male tribute.
But was that really such a terrible fate? He could almost see the headlines of the articles that would surely be written about him: Sherlock Holmes Dies Of Morphling Overdose Just Four Days After Brother’s Death.
“My father owned the cemetery. When he passed a few years ago, he passed it and all of its duties down to me and Daniel. Daniel, he actually – he was the one who carved Mycroft’s name into that stone… But anyway, you see things, as a caretaker. You see the way someone looks at the grave of a loved one for the first time – the way they can hardly look away from it, the way their body has no idea what to do – you know it well. You can see it from a mile away.”
–” she used her spoon to point to the hallway, back to their bedrooms, “– was the first time we’ve slept in a bed in a few days – the cots in the hospital wing don’t count because we were put out in order to sleep. But anyway, our bodies are probably pretty confused by all the adrenaline they were pumping through us in the Arena and are now realizing they don’t need it right now.”
And, for a moment, Sherlock Holmes watched as a fountain of blood and guts poured from her abdomen – far more blood and organs than there should’ve been held within the average person.
The water droplets from the shower held no temperature no matter where Sherlock put the dial – the only way he could really tell that the water was cold was by the fact that there was no steam in the room when he got out.
Two thousand, seven hundred, and sixty seven names in all. The font was small, but the good news was that it would never get smaller than this – there would never be any names other than these.
But their fire remained, and the synthetic fire helped John finally see that clearly. They were still Sherlock and Harry, and nothing the Capitol said or did could change that.
He took a shuddering breath, and grit his teeth together as tears began to fall down his face and blur the words and faces before him – leaving him with nothing but the thought of his brother, and what he wanted to say.
The Mayors of District 5 and 11 for Districts 5 and 11 because all of the mentors of Districts 5 and 11 were killed during the batttle for Panem (which is learned in Chapter 47 (Barriers) of Constantly).
As soon as John and Harry were out of sight, Sherlock let go of the man, allowing himself to fall between the rows of seats. His initial plan was to roll underneath the seats to escape him, but before he could, the man stood up and whipped around, grabbing Sherlock’s ankle.
“She’s not safe,” John whispered back. “She’s still got three more reapings to survive. We have to take her with us.”
Sherlock Holmes was absolutely livid – ready to kill whoever got in his way – ready to kill whoever did this to John.
Sherlock had cut him off that night, leaving himself with one very important question, forgotten and unanswered, until now.
I have no idea WHEN Sherlock would have told John about Harry becoming an alcoholic on his watch, but John DOES know and HAS NOT killed Sherlock for it.
, he tried to think, but in his head that just made him sound like a Career – heartless, as if no one in that Arena mattered.
Of course he believed this was true, but there was also a small part of him that remembered what happened the last time Sherlock vanished off the face of the earth and John was one of the people in charge of finding him; his partner in the operation was the one who found Sherlock, and all John found was a whole new traumatizing experience.
It's almost January, and I'm STILL not done with Constantly. And since we're so close to Sherlock Series Four (and friggin the guy who plays Claudius Templesmith is the new villain this time around (HOW DARE U BBC)) I'm just gonna like. Pause writing for a bit, see what he's about, and I'm gonna do what I can about putting him into the fic because THAT'S JUST WHO I AM
“Sherlock and Harry are just seven floors below me, alive, and I’m not allowed to see them because the Capitol wants an authentic Johnlock reunion – how do you think I’m doing?” John asked.
Harry and Sherlock heard the canon above them, and, as if they were almost used to the sound, carried on their conversation.
“He’s playing them,” Mycroft muttered to John. “They’re both from District Two; he knows that at least one of them won’t back down from a fight.”
“Indeed. He went into your room after we got back from the Victory Banquet and hasn’t emerged since. I did take the liberty to check on him before I left this morning, of course. He was in your pajamas, even.” There was a moment or so of silence between them before Mycroft spoke again, quietly, with a hint of sadness in his voice. “In truth, I never imagined that my brother would ever love anyone the way that he loves you. And honestly, out of all of the people in all of Panem, I’m glad he chose you to love.”
“A theme song – just what I’ve always wanted,” Sherlock chuckled, a small smile tugging at his lips – it was actually really nice. “I didn’t know you could sing,” he noted, a few moments after Harry’s song ended, when just a few of the mockingjays were echoing the notes through the trees.
He knew that the Arena was bound to get worse than this, but Sherlock didn’t mind staying optimistic for just a little while longer.
And Harry was beginning to figure it out – that he wasn’t the person she had always thought he was –
“Hi,” John said, stopping exactly six feet away from the place Sherlock stood – as if he was counting the inches. As if Sherlock had a disease that John was afraid of catching – and in a way, maybe that was true.
“Soldiers from District Thirteen caught up to him, though – he’s probably going to be imprisoned until Dean figures out where to go from there.”
“Hm, I guess I couldn’t stop you, seeing as you won’t care if I spill your secret or not...” Magnussen said with a shrug, but then he took a curved knife out of his pocket – the one that had been provided for him by the Capitol – the same one his brother had used to kill Will Graham twenty-five years ago. “Or, maybe I could stop you.”
“Don’t get discouraged, Mycroft – your brother is still in the Arena, and we all believe in him.” He looked over at John. “He’ll get your sister out; I’m sure of it.”
Sherlock and John also took advantage of every fuel stop the train made – getting off and exploring the area, until a peacekeeper yelled at them to come back. They basked in the feeling the new season gave them – everything renewed, like the world was shedding its skin. Mrs. Hudson nearly cried when she witnessed Sherlock presenting John with one of the newly-bloomed flowers. This embarrassed the hell out of both of them, but they quickly recovered, based on the kiss they shared immediately after.
“Here, they’ve been pissing these out,” Louise said, AND THE PEACEKEEPERS CAME, WHIPPED OUT THEIR DICKS, AND THEN FULL SHITS CAME OUT
“And there we have it! William-Sherlock Holmes, from District Twelve, who made it to the top of the betting charts with his training score of twelve, is the first tribute to figure out the pattern of this year’s Arena! But he seems to have gotten himself a little tied up in the process! Let’s see if he can himself get out of it!”
Sherlock. I don’t wanna get into specifics because we might just be the focus of the broadcast, right now, but John taught me that, when a person dies, if they’ve got anything, you know, inside of them, they’re going to release –”
It was gross – it was wet and slobbery and everything Sherlock’s kiss wasn’t – John tried to rip his face from Charles Augustus’ but he was cornered – all he did was lead their faces in a dance against the wall. He wanted to push Charles Augustus away, but he couldn’t find his arms. He knew they were there, he knew he could use them, but he couldn’t get his mind to send the message, to command his arms to move.
“Of course, Mr. Holmes,” the guard replied. “Although, he is not yet aware of Hannibal’s request for execution; we ourselves only found out this morning when he asked for the necessary papers…” he trailed off, he trailed off, flipping to said papers on his clipboard. “He’s already filled out his part of the forms, if you choose to fill out yours…”
“What is it, what’s wrong?” he asked, not asking the question he really wanted to ask, which was something along the lines of, “why can’t everyone just leave us the fuck alone?”
It was the way he said it – the gleam of his eyes, the way he wet his lips with his tongue after he mentioned his name – it was everything about him in that moment, that sent Sherlock’s brain spiraling. He searched his dismantling palace, running through halls and tearing down shelves, scattering files in his wake, trying to find something – anything – about the way he was saying his boyfriend’s name – what he could mean –
Harry would bring up the subject at random intervals over the next couple of weeks, but John ultimately ended the argument once and for all the day before school started, when he shouted that, if their parents were alive, they would’ve made her go back, too, rebellion or not.
Sherlock watched John closely as he went through his nightly routine, but even that was different: John closed the door to the bathroom when brushing his teeth and getting changed into his pajamas. They were together; they had been shirtless in front of each other before, and they were both fine with it – until now. Not only that, but as soon as Sherlock had taken off his shirt to get changed into pajamas, John was suddenly extremely interested in the mentor manifesto that, months before, he had told Sherlock could “fuck off” and let him know that his brother was being an “utter cock” for getting on John’s ass about it.
“They made it past the Beast,” Louise whispered, hugging John, but he was more focused on Mycroft, chatting it up with Dean Bainbridge. #JEALOUS AS SHIT
It took Sherlock a second, however, to realize that the man – Daniel Cairns – was holding an infant, wrapped up in a blanket to protect them from the cold. The baby was not even a year old, as far as Sherlock could tell.
“Shit – right,” Harry said, as if she was just remembering. “I always forget that – how she – why she –”
Sherlock beamed at John, grateful for the opportunity to tell everyone how wrong they were about them - something he had wanted to do since the Victory Tour six months ago.
“Yeah, well, I’m hitting the mark, so it's fine. I was just leaving, though. Here,” she said, holding out her bow.
“What can I say?” Mycroft said, brushing snow off of his jacket. “My brother brings out the best in me.”
“How’d they get that diagnosis?” John asked. He had heard the term before, but knew for a fact that no one in the Districts had any way to officially give that kind of verdict.
“When Mr. and Mrs. McAllister didn’t return, Mr. and Mrs. Morstan went to check in on the McAllister’s and your parents. Unfortunately, Snow had stationed Peacekeepers outside of your house, unbeknownst to anyone, and as soon as Snow was shot they…all four of them were shot by those Peacekeepers. I’m sorry, John, Harry…neither of your parents made it.”
It was only then Sherlock slowly stood up, and casually made his way up the hill. Seconds after Sherlock had joined John under the cover of the trees, the beam of light passed over the place he had previously occupied.
“…Yes, I think I did. Thank you. Now, if you could please drive me to the bookstore on Eighth Street…” he started, and glanced back at the prison, one last time, knowing exactly what was going on within the walls at that moment. “…I have a family to go see.”
Mycroft becomes President of Panem; he and John live together in the President's Mansion (Mycroft is happy to house John, if only to keep an eye on him), and John is appointed representative of District 12. Mycroft is already accused of nepotism in choosing most of his friends to be representatives, so John makes sure he does a good job keeping in touch with the Mayor of 12 even if he doesn't live there. Other than that, he is the shell of the man he used to be.
“It’s not my job to keep tabs on him,” Sherlock replied, though he’d be lying if he wasn’t a small bit worried about his brother, as well.
And so they both walked, leaving their footprints in the previously untouched snow. It wasn’t long before John was pointing out the red of cardinals in their reserved world covered in long shadows and snow. Sherlock generally hated small talk, but if it meant that John wasn’t shutting himself down, then he could make as much idle chit-chat as he wanted.
“Absolutely,” John replied slowly, and Hannibal straightened up to full height, looking down at John, trying to intimidate him.
He missed his friends, though. Sometimes, he missed them desperately, desperately enough to genuinely consider reaching out to them. There were times that Sherlock deeply considered jumping on the next train to District Nine, to throw himself at Harry Watson’s feet and begging her for forgiveness. Sometimes he even considered calling up someone that wasn’t too attached to his situation for help; Antonia Blake often came to mind when he thought of this, for some reason. There were even some nights that Sherlock would wake in a cold sweat, clamoring down the stairs and dialing Dean Bainbridge’s phone number, the confession of his sin already on his lips, punishment for his crime be damned. Whenever he did this, though, he would come to his senses before making the call itself. After the twelfth time of trying and failing to turn himself in, he disconnected his phone.
“I’m sorry I found out how I did,” Sherlock replied. “To be honest, I think I knew all along – or was at least close to figuring it out on my own before he made me figure it out. I wanted to turn it off – I did –”
John shivered as Magnussen pressed further into the most sensitive part of him, trying to ignore the smell and taste of smoke and the way Magnussen’s breath tickled his neck – it barely registered that he was talking about his sister – he just watched the number on the wall.
“You’ll be seeing their families tomorrow. Can you handle that?” he asked slowly, his words deliberate.
He sat like that for a long time – listening to his own breathing, the sounds of the world existing – the world continuing on despite the severe lack of his brother.
“I found three – it messed me up real bad but I couldn’t...you were dying and they were taking you away and I had to stop them and I couldn’t even...”
John had started writing about their experiences in the Arena years ago – how it felt, what it was like, and how they were living now that the Hunger Games were over. When John first mentioned the idea of publishing his writing, Sherlock was less-than enthusiastic.
There were nights that Harry woke up, screaming her brother’s name, just for John to rush into her room for her to start babbling about seeing Magnussen in the fog in her dreams. Once she realized who she was talking to, she would stop herself, because her brother’s nightmares contained almost the exact same thing, and start fumbling over apologies (“– fuck – I need to start calling Sherlock for this shit – I’m sorry – I keep forgetting –”). But, each time this happened, John would tuck her back into bed and stay with her until she was asleep again.
No, Magnussen knew that Sherlock and Harry would not be tempted by something as trivial as food – not when they were fairly well-fed at home.
Something inside him dropped to the floor. He needed to speak to Mycroft about...this. He, above anyone else, would know what to do about what had happened. Apparently he had spoken Mycroft’s name out loud, for Lavinia began to lead him into the hall – to Mycroft’s office.
In response, he wrapped his arms around her, and he could feel her finally relax, probably for the first time in days.
For one thing, John knew Sherlock and Harry better than anyone, and therefore always knew what they needed and who he needed to be for them at any given moment, but there was also the added bonus that being there for Sherlock and Harry never involved blood, which John still had a hard time handling the sight of, on his worst days. Unexpectedly, it also gave John some sense of power that he didn’t have when Sherlock and Harry were in the Arena. When they were in the Arena, John himself was practically useless, having to rely on others in order to help either of them. Now, finally, he could keep them safe and relatively happy directly, which was so much better.
“Hey,” she replied, and they sat down on the sofa together, in between Dean and River. “How are you doing?” she asked.
Despite the gaping hole in Sherlock’s heart and in Sherlock’s life that was once filled by Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock was learning a new sense of normalcy. He was finally,
just moments after asking for my friendship? Just moments after I gave him my final answer? Hannibal’s arrest was a promise, John. He
“He knew that his plan would run the risk of losing his life, but he was adamant that it would be worth it.”
“I didn’t think coming home would be so bittersweet,” Harry said quietly, suddenly appearing beside him, staring out the same window onto the same land Sherlock had been getting himself lost in. “I mean, it’s home – we’re going home and I thought we’d never get to be able to say those words again, but…” she trailed off as John joined her other side. “Everything’s changed.”
“Oh my god,” Sherlock gasped, nearly collapsing with relief as he pressed his palms against his eyes. “Oh, it’s just a Jabberjay.”
The scene they entered matched the one in the lobby – people were sitting in the audience chairs, talking and helping the injured sitting closest to them. Some people sat on the floor, and some sat on the stage itself.
Since John, Sherlock, and Harry had no idea who most of the surviving victors were, they had no idea how to even ask any of them a question, or what to even ask about. They had only seen the Games of the victors had siblings to put into the Quell’s reaping pool, and so they couldn’t possibly ask about the Games, and by the time it was their turn to ask a question all of the good, important questions had already been asked.
Honestly, Sherlock did not expect anything less from the Capitol. But now he tried not to dwell on the idea of all of these people vomiting in the bathrooms not twenty feet from him.
John raced down the stairs, weaving his way around the Avoxes already in the stairwell, desperately searching for Sherlock’s black training suit among the sea of white Avox uniforms. His plan was simple: run downstairs, meet up with his boyfriend, deliver him back to the training room, and then meet up with Mycroft – wherever he might be – to let him know that Sherlock was fine.
But, slowly, Sherlock got better. His hands slowly grew steadier, as opposed to being so shaky he could barely carry a glass of water across the room without spilling half of it or dropping the cup altogether. His vomiting became less frequent and he was slowly able to keep his meals down. His body slowly grew stronger with each passing day. He slowly began to open up during his support group meetings. His mind slowly grew faster – faster and easier to control. He didn’t have to distract himself from what happened that summer. He could deduce again – really deduce. He could focus on information instead of just spouting out deductions that made no sense to the given situation as he thought of them.
I was gonna post this last night but I had to be into work at 6:00 am the next morning and I had a panic attack to deal with so basically hello here's ur chapter now. XD
“I thought I heard your voice – it’s about time you arrived!” Mrs. Hudson said, her own voice shrill with anxiety and rage. “Do you have
But she kept walking, she kept carrying Sherlock, because he was her best friend, and she wasn’t going to let him die – not like this – not in the Hunger Games Arena, attacked by a swarm of tracker jackers.
“LET THEM!” Sherlock roared in a voice that John had never heard before – in a voice that genuinely scared him.
But this, John was realizing, was an entirely different playing field. After the Hunger Games, everything was.
It was then the door opened, and Sherlock mentally counted everyone in the room. Everyone who mattered to them was here – so who would be –
But they did, and Sherlock knew that, deep down. Because they were the Capitol, and that’s what the Capitol does – take and take and strip you down until there was absolutely nothing left.
Rosamund gains a best friend practically from birth, whose name is Emelia Ricoletti. Hamish befriends a girl who moved from District 10 to District 9 in fifth grade.
“Fifty?” Sherlock breathed, leaning in again, refusing to break eye contact, as if he was trying to get closer to Hannibal – block out all the other people in the room.
“I hope he drowns,” he muttered, the thought of Magnussen bringing back the memories John fought to keep away.
The mere act of stepping out of the elevator and into the penthouse sent two very different emotions coursing through Sherlock’s body. His limbs itched with the overwhelming urge to trash the place – to break everything that could be broken, to overturn the tables and chairs, to tear the wallpaper off the walls, leaving nothing but Mycroft’s office and bedroom untouched. The rest of him, on the other hand, felt the overwhelming desire to sleep.
“It’s alright if you don’t wish to tell me, but you have school in the morning. Would you please at least
The people in Mycroft’s graduating class, who spent six hours of just about every weekday in his presence for thirteen years; the same ones who bullied Sherlock for years, until Mycroft won the Games and told them to stop.
John looked at Dean, who was busy talking to Alexander, oblivious to the conversation between John and Mycroft.
“He wrote a will, leaving Panem and its future to me, trusting that I will make Panem a better place than when he left it, which I plan to do with my life. And he told me that, if he did lose his life in the battle, to tell you all this: Mycroft is greatly sorry for all of your losses, and he wished he could prevent every single one. He made everyone aware of what was at stake for being part of the rebellion. He gave everyone a choice as to whether or not they wanted to fight, knowing that they might lose their lives, and everyone agreed – everyone knew the potential cost. He never wanted anyone to die, and he’s sorry that people did. I know I am not a parent or a spouse or a child of any of the deceased, but some of my best friends were killed that night, and I personally find some peace in his words – that he never wanted for this to happen and he never saw any of those deaths as necessary. I hope that others will, too.
And since Hannibal Lecter Magnussen was there, watching Sherlock’s every move, and since Sherlock had come up with the fantastically dangerous idea to seem genuinely attracted to the idea of Hannibal’s friendship, Sherlock would have to look Harry Watson – his best friend, his sister, his partner and confidant – in the eye, and deny her of the one thing that had probably been keeping her sane since returning from the Arena: the support of one of the two people who knew exactly what she was going through.
he’d find out about Hamish. Hell, maybe he would’ve never known that Sherlock and John were fathers if Sherlock hadn’t gone in to see him –
“It’s payback, isn’t it,” Sherlock said, and at first the sound of his voice speaking above a whisper surprised John, but then he heard his voice – really heard his voice, finding that his tone was empty – completely hollowed by grief – and it broke John’s heart. “Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth? I couldn’t save all of your siblings, so Mycroft...”
“So, we can use this to our advantage,” Sherlock replied. “If we can keep our sectors divided, he might think we’re separated. If I go to the feast and find Magnussen right now, only our two sectors will combine. If I go into his sector, he might think I went in there unwittingly, and try to find me – Harry – I could end this –”
With a rush of defiance, Sherlock turned to Harry, only glancing at her for a moment before returning his eyes to Magnussen, making it clear that he was speaking directly to her while keeping an eye on Magnussen.
Dean’s eyes lingered on the scars for a moment, and Sherlock knew that Mycroft had never mentioned Sherlock’s addiction to him.
But then, when John and Mycroft were almost to the door of the training center, John heard his own voice coming over the speakers – as if he was on the screen – as if he was in the Arena, again.
And maybe that would’ve been fine – maybe it wouldn’t have bothered Sherlock at all – if Sherlock had even the slightest of chances with John Watson. But everyone knew John’s habit of crushing on nearly every girl in their class – Sherlock knew this most of all. There was no possible way that John Hamish Watson would ever,
Sherlock nearly jumped out of his skin and spun around, apple still in hand, but then he saw it was only Harry Watson peeking at him from over the back of the sofa, and he instantly relaxed.
All throughout the day, Sherlock couldn’t stop thinking about the training score he had earned. His twelve meant many things – it meant sponsors, it meant he was a huge target to everyone now, but it also meant something else: it meant he got the same score as Charles Augustus Magnussen.
“We have to ride this out, Sherlock. I know it’s hard but you’re strong, you can get through this –”
If Sherlock hadn’t realized exactly what Harry had done before this point, he definitely, fully realized it, now.
John was always shocked by Sherlock’s displays of affection, but this was certainly the sweetest display yet. A smile grew across John’s face.
And, for the first time since it was revealed that Sherlock and Harry were going to the Arena, he was sort of telling the truth.
“We now know you – you killed your sister, and now we know how. But why did you do it?” the next person asked, obviously still reeling from the last question.
“Yes, but that means we have a chance of finding him before he finds us. We need to stay hidden from plain sight.”
Magnussen smiled, and finally stopped flicking Harry’s face. He straightened up and looked at Sherlock, and Sherlock’s heart sank lower than it ever had before.
“Mycroft Holmes,” she said, looking up at him. “Would you mind dancing with me?” It struck John then how much Harry had grown. He remembered the last time she had done this: her face was almost as red as her hair, wringing her hands, and looking as if she was asking her toes to dance instead of Sherlock’s older brother.
He barely registered the papers in his hands dropping to the ground. Just when he realized this, before he could do anything else, the words were spilling out of his mouth. He could not stop them; they all jumbled together, like they were being pushed out of him:
“Right,” John muttered, and left the man alone in his house, vaguely wondering what would inspire a man from the Capitol to move up to a District like 12, but mostly, John was just exhausted from the kick of adrenaline, and was ready to go home.
“Maybe. Probably.” Sherlock whispered back, mulling the idea over in his head: his addiction had saved him. It sounded preposterous – dangerous as hell – but it was the only thing that made sense, no matter how improbable it seemed.
Welcome To The Masquerade by Thousand Foot Krutch (for Mycroft in the Capitol after Sherlock's 12th birthday)
But there was one thought that kept cutting through, and that was what John thought about as he walked onto the stage:
Most of the time, Sherlock tried to bring John back – telling him to ground himself; making sure John knew where he really was. But then there were times – times like these, where Sherlock let John go on his journey, remembering whatever he had remembered. Because remembering made it real, made John sure that it had absolutely happened, and Sherlock knew that. And maybe someday, John would find that he didn’t need to remember, and maybe that day would happen before his memories threatened to devour him completely. Sherlock would stay with him though, no matter what. No matter how lost John got, Sherlock would be right at his side.
It was a beautiful creature – a creature that seemed like an old friend to Sherlock – but why? He had seen one before, he knew he had – but where? Maybe beyond the fence with John? No, that wasn’t right – they had seen stags before, but nothing like this one, surely...
“How does it feel to be the youngest tribute in Hunger Games history?” he had asked Archie, but Louise had answered for him.
– everyone will read it – everyone will have the thought in their head – the thought that Sherlock is –” he cut himself off, trying to remind himself that Sherlock was in the room, and he turned to Dean and Alexander again. “They’re not right – they’re
“For two children – well, a child and a teenager – who had lost both of their parents before the youngest one reached the age of ten, Mycroft and I didn’t believe in a life after death. It might’ve been easier on us to believe that they were in a place just above us, looking down on us and watching out for us, but, if you know the Holmes family, you know that we were always people of science and reasoning. So, due to the lack of physical evidence and scientific explanation, we never believed that there was an afterlife for them, or that there would be for us, and that made it easy on us, too, somehow.” Sherlock had more to say on the subject, but when he glanced up and noticed a few people shifting uncomfortably in their seats, he skipped down and got to the point. “But, if there
That was stupid – that was so stupid – putting their sibling’s lives and chance of survival in their hands without them even knowing it – years in advance –
“Sorry – sorry –” Sherlock mumbled, and, out of lack of knowing where else to put his hands, they found their way to the sides of his temple, the heels of his hands pressing against his head, as if trying to crush the contents between them, squeezing his eyes tightly shut.
Then he had turned and Janine was already rushing to attack him – to kill him – but Sherlock was quick to defend himself – and attack her. She was able to block his blows a few times, but not enough – and soon Janine Hawkins – Amanda’s sister – soon she was bleeding on the ground, her stomach and intestines oozing out of her body –
“No; he’ll start that tomorrow, when he finds Hannibal killing and eating tributes. Of course, the encephalitis and the autism did not go away; he still hallucinated and lost bits of time and got overwhelmed, but this time he knew who he was, so he was able to act for Hannibal, as opposed to believing the lies he was feeding him.”
Caesar looked between the three of them, sadness and sympathy now plaguing his features, and it was then for the first time that Sherlock noticed the laughter lines that were etched into his skin. As soon as he wasn’t smiling, it was plain to see the years and years of hosting this damned show – these damned Games – taking its toll. With just a simple change of expression, he could see the years of plastered smiles for rolling cameras that had marked his face as its own.
The chance for Sherlock to apologize, even if the one person who needed to hear it wasn’t around to do so anymore.
“I did not. Seneca only gives us the bare minimum. I had no idea about the gas until they filled the Arena with it.” The elevator doors opened, and John bit his tongue to keep from replying as the other mentors filed out. He was about to follow them, but then Mycroft touched his shoulder. “I’m sorry, John. If I could have, I would have tried to stop them from using it.”
Sherlock grit his teeth together at the sound of the name, just as John had that day in the stairwell, like John did just now, watching the three of them on the screen.
But, in that moment, Sherlock was able to strike the match in his hand, and carry the thought to his mouth.
“In order to understand how I did it, you must know this: Mischa always loved plants; she dreamt of being an apothecary when she was older; she was fascinated with plants of all kinds and aspired to use said plants to help people. So, with that said, on the night before her twelfth birthday, I bought her a simple sycamore tree sapling – it was so young she had no idea it was nothing more than that – and I told her that it was a very rare tree that grew best when planted at night. That was all it took to lure her out of the District. We went beyond District One’s wall, walked for about two miles more, and then I decided we were far enough away, I let her go on ahead, put down the tree and the shovel, went up behind her, and I strangled her. I quickly removed the meat from her bones, buried her bones under the sycamore sapling, and left. My family assumed she ran away, and nobody asked how we suddenly had all the meat we had. Was that answer satisfactory?”
Hannibal’s face was as solemn as a face could possibly be, which was probably why the look of interest in his eyes stood out to Sherlock so much. Hannibal was acting like he cared, but really Sherlock was just his new experiment, just like Will Graham had been to him all those years ago, in their Arena.
"This my comment, [...] because you have not posted Constantly in January as [you] said [you] would, [...] a "is everything okay with you?". Sherlock's S4 and the positioning of its creators made us very ill, but I hope that was not enough for you to give up. [...] Please, Sara, do not give up on the show and do not deprive us of your talent. After the way Sherlock is done, the work of the fans is the only thing left for me!!!"
“Come in,” John’s voice said from within, and Sherlock slowly opened the door. John was curled up in bed, facing away from him.
and if he could just continue kissing him he would be able to go through with it – but John spoke first. “Do you want to go up on the roof?”
that night, and that is ugly and terrible and so heartbreaking and so much more that I honestly don’t think a word even
“Hello, again, everyone, and thank you for your patience while we dealt with some technical difficulties. And thank you for being here to remember the life of Mycroft Holmes, and to mourn his tragic and untimely loss,” Dean started, as professionally as he could despite the circumstances. “For those of you watching from District Twelve: you might be a bit confused as to why you’re watching this part of the service, but I can assure you it is not a mistake; at the request of Mycroft’s surviving family, you are all welcome to view the memorial service of Mycroft Holmes.”
Sarah, being the person who was chased, entered the sector first, and just when Aurora crossed the barrier into the sector, the ground erupted from underneath Sarah, and the sound of the explosion and the canon marking Sarah’s death merged into one.
And, in truth, he was, for the most part. Yes, he wasn’t allowed to see Sherlock and Harry, but he had to admit he wasn’t having a completely terrible time living with eight past victors from District 4. They understood what John was going through and didn’t ask him any invasive questions about his assault or Sherlock or anything he wouldn’t want to talk about. They treated him like he was human, which was much more than the Capitol was ever able to do. Even though they were born in completely different parts of Panem and into societies that viewed the Hunger Games as two totally different things, by the time Louise and Clover left and the Hunger Games recap rolled around, John was sort of hoping that at least one of them would stay behind and watch it with him.
The house, just like nearly everything else in 12, was the same – it looked the same, smelled the same,
John thought about Sherlock and Harry – they’d both definitely try and do exactly that if they had known that John was in trouble. In fact, Sherlock and Harry would probably have killed the Peacekeeper who had taken John’s leg to keep him from escaping...
And, for a moment, Sherlock was caught off guard by Dean’s question. Sherlock had always seen himself as the polar opposite of his brother; risk-taking when Mycroft would have hesitated, mouthy when Mycroft would’ve stayed quiet, rule-breaking where Mycroft would’ve kept his toes in line – the wild child to combat Mycroft’s parental nature.
The moment Sherlock and Harry returned from their training (Harry walking with Sherlock up the staircase), Harry gathered John and they both went into Mycroft’s office, where he was working. Harry was the one who knocked, and though they were allowed to enter the room, they opened the door to discover that Mycroft had not looked up from his work.
Mycroft squinted at John, his features suddenly stormy as a hurricane, and John then understood what Sherlock meant by crowning Mycroft Holmes as being worse than the East Wind. He looked positively terrifying.
“Nothing, just a mosquito,” she replied. “I read about the jungle once in school – mosquitoes are popular in this environment so I’m not surprised that they’re – oh my god, Steven.”
“‘As decreed by President Coriolanus Snow, the one, true victor of the Seventy-Fifth Annual Hunger Games will be chosen by’…” he took a deep breath, glancing up and around the room, his eyes alight with the excitement of holding the room’s attention. Once he deemed his dramatic pause long enough, he spoke again, reading the rest of the sentence: “‘John Hamish Watson.’”
With all the stops the train had to make, the trip from the Capitol to District 12 that would’ve normally easily taken about twenty hours’ time took almost a whole day to complete. But John didn’t mind it, really – in fact, as they got closer to the District, John found himself growing more and more nervous. It wasn’t like he hadn’t made this trip before – he had made it this time last year, and over the winter six months ago – no, it wasn’t the trip itself that scared him.
I really like this especially because you get to see a little bit of NON-HUNGER-GAMES-RELATED BANTER, ACTUAL, LEGITIMATE BANTER BETWEEN SHERLOCK AND JOHN. And really you don't get to see that throughout ANY OF THESE FICS.
The night – the seconds leading up to the cease of his brother’s heartbeat – ran through his head. He could feel his brother’s arms around him, he could see the look in his brother’s eyes, he could hear –
“You have two children, don’t you?” [Hannibal] asked, and Sherlock set his jaw and tightened his fists, but his heart raced with fear. “A little boy...and someone new...” he breathed in one more time, and a smile spread across his face. Sherlock’s stomach dropped.
Mycroft met them at the penthouse, the doors to the elevator opening to reveal his lethal stare, before anyone could escape into their rooms.
“Where’s Cinna and Connie?” John asked Venia as the team began to disrobe him for prepping. “I haven’t seen them all morning.”
As soon as he was out in the foyer, doors closed behind him, unable to hear the words that people were saying about his brother’s death, Sherlock could finally breathe. He leaned against the wall and pressed the heels of his hands up against his eyes, trying to keep the tears from pouring out.
Everyone’s loss was immediately felt, even more so once Dean said their names aloud. John didn’t know a lot of these names, but, just by glancing around at the other mentors and past victors John knew that they knew exactly who each of them were. When he thought about it, Mycroft probably did too. In fact, there probably wasn’t a single person in that room who hadn’t lost someone important to them that night.
“Not a chance,” Sherlock replied with a smirk that quickly faded. “Let him know, would you? When I’m gone, tell him that I wanted to, you know...”
“I’m going to be late,” he muttered, looking back at John, and he could see the anxiousness in his husband’s eyes. “I won’t take long, I promise.”
Snow grinned, this time with his entire face. But there was a glint of something in his eyes – something John couldn’t put his finger on.
“Then let me be an idiot, would you?” Sherlock asked, wearily. He closed his eyes for his make-up artist. “Let me be an idiot and let me refuse this,” he begged quietly.
They did not have sex. There were moments during the night where Sherlock thought that perhaps that’s where they were going to go, and for the first time ever he felt properly prepared to go there, but they never did. They just pulled each other as close as possible and kissed, and laughed, and touched, and cried, together.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “There’s no point –” he started to say, but the no-nonsense look upon Mycroft’s face stopped him. “Fine.”
she decided, smirking a little bit. “I don’t care what anyone at the Capitol has to say; that bastard
John had whispered, unable to tear his eyes away from Sherlock’s as he slipped Sherlock’s wedding ring onto his finger.
“Yes,” John replied without a second thought, and Sherlock went over to the group, out of earshot to talk to them. An Avox boy, about the same age as himself, stepped forward and nodded when Sherlock asked him a question, and nodded again as Sherlock asked another, and then he was back, interlacing his fingers into John’s hand as soon as he touched him.
about Charles Augustus Magnussen that wasn’t right, but even Sherlock truly didn’t know his own motives – but for some reason, just before the interviews, he broke away from the safety of John, Mycroft, and Harry, and strode up to the Magnussen brothers.
food; you won’t get anything like this for another six months. Mycroft knows – he’s got two whole cakes in his room – RIGHT, MYCROFT?!” he called down the hall, and John jumped at the sudden volume.
“Okay,” Harry said with a shrug, and Sherlock looked at her, and was surprised to find that all the questions she had in her eyes just moments ago had vanished. She looked at him as if his feeble attempts at an explanation were actually successful ones, and that she actually understood, even though there was no way for her to have any real idea what Sherlock was trying to say.
find them, or even one of them, he’d be so self-confident, so self-congratulatory, that he’d slip up, make a slight mistake, keep his back turned for just a moment too long...
At one point, Dean found his way up to the row that they were occupying and reached across John to put his hand on Sherlock’s wrist. Sherlock jumped at the touch, as if snapping himself out of a trance, and looked over at Dean, his eyes red from crying, just like everyone else’s in the room.
A sequence that I was thinking of writing was a conversation between Mycroft and John, hours after a Representative Meeting. Mycroft quietly deduces that one of the other Representatives (a girl) has an attraction to John ("She likes you, you know."), and he offers to put the two together on any projects so that they would get a chance to talk. When John starts to object, Mycroft informs him that he wouldn't be angry with John if he were to start dating again - that he didn't expect John to stay celibate for Sherlock's memory forever -
“For one, the cane is back,” Sherlock began. “Second off, Mycroft’s been watching you like a hawk ever since Harry and I got back. Thirdly, you barely ate anything during dinner, and that normally means –”
At that moment, Sherlock’s paranoia hit him like a bullet through his chest – Lindsay Cairns, this woman – this
Sherlock gripped onto John’s hand, and beside Sherlock, Harry held onto his other hand – both of which were trembling in their grasps, his knuckles white with how tightly he was holding on. They all knew what the final name would be, and they desperately tried to mentally prepare themselves for it.
“I’m pretty sure I was his first and last girlfriend, period,” Lindsay said. “Meeting you and your mom was the beginning of the end for us, anyway; I realized that I’d rather us be friends around the same time he realized that, in most cases, dating extended beyond just holding hands. So, it worked out. We stayed friends, and that worked better for us – there were times where I think we both had completely forgotten that we had dated. In fact, Mycroft was the whole reason why my husband and I started talking.”
And, for a second, John found himself looking out through the crowd, trying to find the two people he wanted to see the most – the two people he would never be able to see again – his parents.
As Hannibal Magnussen’s voting ballot was passed around the audience, Sherlock stared at the man himself, watching him get shot up with the needle that contained the truth serum. He was given a chair to sit in, as everyone else had before him, but he chose to stand, which seemed to be a choice that had been made to show his mental strength and stamina than one that showed it was more convenient.
for any of us – and he ended up doing just that, which would almost be fitting if it wasn’t so terrible, and it truly hurts that he’s gone.
“I’m glad you found me,” she said, instantly throwing her arms around Sherlock once he was close enough, and he returned the gesture. “I’ve been asking for you but no one’s been telling me anything,” she went on once they parted.
I feel like a major theme in Constantly is Sherlock’s ability to Be Sherlock, and whether or not that’s a good thing.
“Just stand here and pout,” Sherlock replied. “If you can cry on demand, now would be a good time to do so.”
When comparing the two groups of Careers from this year and last year it wasn’t nearly as evenly-matched – the group from last year was far more skilled, in terms of the scores they received. They were amazed when Helen Hewlett, from District 1, was scored a seven for her efforts, and when William Wiggins, from District 7, received a ten.
“Well, sadly...” Caesar started, and John knew exactly what was coming – and even though he was able to give Sherlock and Harry the slightest of hints that something was happening, neither of them were anywhere close to fully prepared for what was going to happen. Hell,
“Go!” Harry shouted, and Clara Coleman took a few steps back, wide-eyed and hurt, and then raced out the door.
He would never see the world outside the Arena ever again. He would never see District 12 or Mr. and Mrs. Watson or John or Mycroft –
And for a second, Sherlock could taste the metallic tang of Charles Augustus’ blood on his tongue, again.
What would’ve happened if you overdosed again? Especially if you were out at night like you’ve been?” she asked, and Sherlock realized that he had never even considered that. “You would’ve died, cold and alone, and we never would’ve known where to even
Harry had been rendered completely dumbfounded upon laying eyes on Louise Neal after the recap. She had seemed deeply touched by Louise’s compliment of her hair. They had stayed by each other’s side during the Victory Banquet. They had always made a point to greet each other specifically. As soon as she had seen her after the rebellion, Harry had called out Louise’s name and they had hugged each other as if they were holding on for dear life – the same way that Sherlock and John hugged after each of their Games.
“And we won the fight – we didn’t have to play the Game anymore – but some people lost. Their names are there,” Sherlock said, pointing at the middle.
“I can get us out,” Sherlock said as she pulled him up. “I’m Sherlock Holmes, after all,” he said, smiling a bit, trying to lighten the mood despite wobbling a bit on his feet as he stood up.
“I know you’re not the biggest fan of children but…I think you’d like them,” Sherlock said quietly, feeling silly for speaking out loud to the statue, but not necessarily minding – this was the closest he could ever get to speaking with his brother, again. “I miss you,” he added, even quieter.
He tried to move on from that night, tried to act like a normal human being (or like his normal self, at the very least), but most of the time he had no idea how – he had no idea what to do without Mycroft. Not to mention the fact that even simple things like getting out of bed or eating or merely existing all exhausted him, most days. He watched as John and Harry were able to do these things so easily, envious. They had lost their whole lives, too – how were they moving on, when he missed his brother so much sometimes he could barely stand it – could barely breathe?
Sherlock and Harry ran through the maze, Sherlock stumbling every few steps as he directed them, hearing John Watson shouting their names – calling for help – as they went.
Happened – what had happened? There was – there was touching involved – touching John didn’t like – and Charles Augustus Magnussen –
He leaned over and picked up his discarded purple tie from the floor and tied it around his arm as a tourniquet, and the feeling of the tightness around his arm brought him back to the Games, just for a second.
“And now, may I present to you, our two victors of the Seventy-Fifth Hunger Games: Sherlock Holmes and Harry Watson from District Twelve, and their mentor, Mycroft Holmes!”
“I...I choose...” he looked from Sherlock to Harry. Sometime after the announcement, Sherlock had begun to hug her, and he was still holding onto her – and she to him, as she sobbed into his chest, using him for support. It was then he saw the tears running down Sherlock’s face, too. “I...I’m sorry...” John went on, his mind unable to come up with anything better – anything more elaborate to say to stall – any better way to apologize for what he had to do –
He wandered from the bathroom to his closet, and searched for anything that wasn’t a three-piece suit that he could wear. Something low-maintenance – something that didn’t scream “presentable” – something that he didn’t have to button up – something that didn’t look like something his brother would wear. After searching through blazers and button-ups of various colors and styles and finding nothing, Sherlock went to his dresser to see what he could find.
“I saw Hannibal at lunch,” John would announce. “I swear, he had nothing but meat – red meat, no fish or chicken. And he looked
Last year, he had been so prepared to go into the Arena as long as he kept John safe and alive. He was confident he would win – he always thought he would win any Hunger Games, and even now, he knew it was possible.
Harry, affected by tracker jacker venom, pulls Sherlock out of the jungle and to the beach of the Arena; Sherlock suffers from vivid hallucinations, memories, and meets someone he thought he'd never meet; John and Mycroft struggle for sponsors; the unthinkable occurs.
“‘John Watson must make his decision while on Caesar Flickerman’s stage, within the next two minutes,’” Caesar read on. “‘The tribute that is chosen to die will immediately be taken into Peacekeeper custody, and their execution will be televised. If John Watson refuses to make a decision or is unable to make a decision in the time allotted, both William Holmes and Harriet Watson must die.’”
Sherlock gave the man a thin-lipped smile. Of course the people who worked here were fans of John’s work.
His eyes then landed on the Magnussen brothers on the backstage screen. He grit his teeth as Hannibal Magnussen opened his stupid cannibal mouth –
“What does this have to do with Mycroft?” Sherlock asked, still confused – or, at the very least, not wanting his brain to catch up, just yet –
In reply, he kissed John deeply, wordlessly promising him that he’d be would indeed return. When they parted, they met each other’s eyes, and the feeling of pride swelled in Sherlock’s chest when he saw that his kiss did the same thing to John as it did when they were younger: take his burdened brain, rushing with thoughts of which Sherlock couldn’t possibly imagine, and pause it with a sense of calm he couldn’t muster up himself – temporarily immobilizing him with love.
“Go! Go to the shore! I’ll catch up!” Sherlock called to her, and Harry only gave him a nod in reply before she jumped back into the water and started to swim away from the commotion.
The scene lit up at once with cameras flashing, trying to get the first moment of John and Mycroft’s entrance before anyone else took it from them or, god forbid, time moved forward, and the moment was gone.
“And I don’t need to worry, do I?” John asked, but Sherlock could tell that his boyfriend was already worried.
And then he left the room, and the Peacekeeper closed the door behind them, leaving John alone with President Snow.
Now that Mycroft had broken the barrier between them and the subject, Sherlock wanted to ask – wanted to know – why hadn’t they had sex, yet? That’s What People Did, and they were people.
“We’ll talk about this later,” John said, his voice harsh, reciting what they had decided their code would be – reciting what they agreed would be John’s way of asking how his acting was.
Before he could make an accurate deduction, however, Harry spoke again, completely oblivious to Sherlock’s revelation.
John froze, a chill running up his spine, as the truth sent a bullet into his heart and tore his stomach open and apart: John was going to be his new favorite.
Sherlock lifted his head and laid it upon John’s back, and listened to his heart beating, his lungs expanding, his stomach gurgling, and all of his other organs as he slept. He was thankful that John’s body was working – thankful that he was alive.
“Okay – you know how we said the Arena was split up?” he asked. “One section for each of the tributes’ siblings’?”
“Was he giving you trouble?” Dean asked, once John and Harry were close enough and Hannibal was far enough away for him to ask without the possibility of Hannibal listening in.
John saw the look on Sherlock’s face when he asked that question, and the emotion in Sherlock’s features gave his thoughts away completely: Sherlock wanted to go home, back to District 12 – he was desperate for it. He was desperate for things to return to normal.
“You’re kind of a buy-one-get-one deal,” Harry informed him. “You know – ask for one, and get the other without asking.” Mrs. Watson shot her daughter a look. “What? It’s true.”
“The great Sherlock Holmes,” Dean said, shaking Sherlock’s free hand. “It’s about time you introduced me to the family; you met Steven years ago,” he joked.
“Yes,” Sherlock replied immediately. “It’ll help, talking with people who have been through the same thing you have. I think it’ll help in ways that I can’t.”
Yep, I went to the hospital back on August 30th - that was the first time I went to the hospital as a patient, so everything was new and different and scary anyway, and then I had to be ambulance'd away to UMass Hospital, which made it even more new and different and scary. The cause? Migraines. Basically I had been vomiting a lot and no one knew why (and it would've been like "whatever" if it wasn't for the fact that I hadn't vomited since I was EIGHT YEARS OLD), and then one night I came home from therapy (around like 5 o'clock at night?) and I felt numb like my limbs had all fallen asleep even though I wasn't sitting on them to cut off the blood flow and suddenly I couldn't type right no matter how focused I was (and it suddenly took like EVERYTHING IN ME to focus) and
“It’s you,” Sherlock whispered, as the woman stopped next to Sherlock, as Sherlock continued to stare at her, open mouthed. “You – you were Mycroft’s girlfriend – I – I insulted you –”
She had seen this before – a few times, during a couple Games – when a tribute refused to leave the body of a fallen tribute. The Peacekeepers in the hovercraft would knock them out, just long enough for them to collect the body – this is what they were doing to her – because she refused to leave Sherlock behind.
Sherlock led John into the alley between two buildings, where no one would see them, and where no one would look for them. If it weren’t for the music or their nice clothes or the weird feeling in John’s stomach and all the other things that had changed between then and now, he might’ve drawn similarities between now and their first meeting.
“It’s alright – it’s alright –” Sherlock said, still unsure of whom he was talking to – himself or his brother – his dying brother –
“Are you sure you don’t want to talk about it?” Mycroft tried once more, very quietly, and Sherlock quickly shook his head.
Slowly, very slowly, Sherlock stopped actively counting the seconds since Mycroft’s murder. Of course, Sherlock still knew how long it had been, down to the second, at every given moment, but it got to a point where he stopped consciously counting it – where he stopped thinking of it with every breath he took.
“Mycroft was so mad,” she chuckled again, glancing down at his headstone before looking back up at Sherlock. “My name’s Lindsay Cairns, in case you deleted that bit of information – I know you and Mycroft have a knack for doing that –”
“F-fantastic,” John lied, giving the best grin he could as he held on to Sherlock and Harry’s hands.
