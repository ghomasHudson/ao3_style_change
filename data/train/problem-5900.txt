Steve looked at the sender’s address and wasted no time before tearing into the envelope. He swallowed thickly when he pulled out the first piece of cardstock. It was nice, delicate, trimmed in Tiffany blue.
And wasn't that the problem? Steve was stuck at an uncomfortable point in life because Bucky was everywhere. He was in the army, he was in Brooklyn, he was in the fucking diner, in Steve's closet, on Facebook ... But how much was Steve meant to let go? What was the difference between moving on and forgetting?
part, of course. It’s more about everything leading up to it. He touches me and it’s different. It’s like eating fries for the first time; so good that you start wondering how you could ever eat anything else. But I don’t know if it is because he is a man, or if it is because he’s Tony.”
“You didn’t give me time to say anything. I asked you how I was meant to feel. I felt a lot of things, but I was scared. I was scared I could lose you, scared
“Because Peggy’s fucking great, and Sousa’s fucking great. If he was average or if he didn’t look at Peggy the way I used to look at her, then I could at least look at their relationship and say it was different. But it’s not!” Steve sat up and admitted, “I see
"And fifty different people will have photos of us holding hands on Instagram before we even make it to the tower. Smart." But Tony kept glancing down at their hands like he was analyzing Steve's grip as the photographers and their questions followed them down the street. Steve asked,
"I'm sure he has an oven," Steve quipped as he lifted his fingers from the handle. "You seem to know Tony well."
I thought it was bullshit, but I found it at the drugstore across from one of the magazines with our faces on the cover. If chapter seven is to be believed, romance is best judged not by the sun sign, but by the moon sign. As a Libra (me) – Aquarius (you) moon pair we share ideas about fairness and respect for individuals’ differences. We advocate for open communication.”
"You get used to it after awhile. Hell, I am forty years into it, but a year from now I don't want you to be."
“As safe as I can get, anyhow. I like the routine. My neighbor upstairs leaves at three every morning, the deli expects me every day at 12:30, and mail comes at 3:30.”
"I am not permitted to reveal the contents of the Steve Rogers files to anyone except Mr. Stark and Miss Potts. However, yesterday the folder was renamed 'Captain Biceps.'"
Steve carefully considered his answer. The date had only lasted an hour, plus the five minutes it took to walk back to Stark Tower. Tony had made sickeningly cute puppy dog eyes, begging him to come upstairs to the penthouse. That was what truly rubbed Steve the wrong way; Tony looked at him as a plaything. A yearlong, monogamous plaything or a security guard to fuck. Steve needed to make Tony understand there were boundaries. Steve was not a prostitute, not a fucktoy. Outside the doors of Stark Tower and in front of more than a few cameras, he bent to kiss Tony on the cheek before saying good-bye.
“That article was a bunch of softball questions. I have a feeling they won’t be so nice to me once I am no longer, what is it they said? The shiny new toy?”
Everyone’s heads swiveled at once, to land on Tony, then their eyes began to pinball between him and Steve. Tony flashed a peace sign then said,
Steve couldn’t hide his curiosity when Tony jumped onto the stage and grabbed the microphone. Everyone seemed to lean forward the slightest bit, like Tony was magnetic.
Steve stopped doing a lot of things, and hadn’t found a reason to start again. Not until Tony, anyway. Steve kept reminding himself,
Steve arrived at his apartment around ten o’clock that evening. He spent the first few minutes back in his apartment, simply taking it all in.
“I can’t stay at my apartment. There were paparazzi outside and I don’t want to make life harder for everyone else in the building.”
," he gestured to the space between them, "after I beg those assholes to keep the company with my name on it."
Steve smiled for the cameras and wrapped his arm around Tony's waist. His worry wasn't truly about the press. He spent his first nine years in the army convinced the sky would come crashing down if he so much as looked at Bucky the wrong way. The subsequent three years were spent hiding his grief, the anger at himself for losing what might have been. Steve spent his entire life hiding the fact that he liked men, and there he was showing it to the world.
"I think she knew I had history at that place. It's sort of terrifying how manipulative they can be, but I was happy to be there. It was nice to walk into a place where I have memories and make some new ones. But in the process I told him about Bucky."
"Yeah, she gave me her business card and said come meet her at the office. Tony was there when I arrived and it, um, it coulda gone better."
Steve offered Tony his sandwich and he didn’t even pause his work, just sat it on the small countertop next to the toaster. He paused to take the occasional bite, and Steve sat there watching. The playlist restarted. Steve took a picture of Tony working under the sink. His face was obscured by a pipe, but his legs were spread wide on Steve’s kitchen tile and it was another one of those moments when Tony seemed to forget about being
"Good to know." He held the two glasses in one hand and the box of pizza in the other. Steve made his way around the bar before realizing he had no idea where to go. "Jarvis?"
Tony lunged forward, but Steve held him back with one arm until he calmed down. Tony refused to turn his back to Dr. Gilbert for fear he'd soon find a knife in it. Why the hell was that name so familiar?
There was no joke about pipes or dope. Or dope in pipes. Tony was focused on not mentioning anything about their relationship. Ten days earlier, Steve saw Tony as a man with no insecurities. Every day, he uncovered one more and Steve wondered whether he was reciprocating. Tony hadn’t meant to reveal as much as he had, and Steve worked out all sorts of things from the bits of information he received from Miss Potts, Mr. Hogan, and Colonel Rhodes. There wasn’t anyone in Steve’s life for Tony to turn to. No one for him to meet or to know. Sam wasn’t due back for months and Nat was God only knew where.
“I’m going to guess how that happened, but you don’t have to confirm it for me. She cornered you somewhere, offered you a bunch of money, and begged you to keep Tony out of trouble?”
“Black tie. Daniel’s excited to have an excuse to get dressed up. He wants to post photos on social media to make his American friends jealous. I must admit, I rather like that idea.”
If the street outside was busy, the Stark Tower lobby was pure chaos. Steve walked in and guessed the ratio of briefcases to people was a solid 2:1. There were more security cameras than windows and four people manned the reception desk. Steve shuffled his way through without much hassle and stepped into the shortest line at the desk. Once he reached the receptionist he said,
"Sam doesn't always have access to a phone with signal, but they have computers at Bagram. The other friend you found, Nat, she uses too many burner phones for me to keep track. If she's in town she will message me there. That's why I have a Facebook; not because I want one, but because my friends need a way to contact me."
"I have lost people I care about. If you are going to stay with me, if you are going to help me, then I have to make this worth it. Five days in, and I'm already failing miserably."
Then he turned left and caught sight of Tony at the end of the hall. Steve paused for a moment to look at President and CEO Tony Stark. The man at the head of the table was different from first date!Tony and asshole!Tony, who looked prepared to murder the man giving the presentation. The pencil in Tony's hand had snapped, but his fingers were still clamped around the nub as his thumb dug into the broken wood on top.
From his vantage point, the only thing visible was the top of One Vanderbilt with the sky a sunset orange behind it. Steve frowned, out of place at the literal height of luxury. He tossed his duffel onto one of the chairs and moved toward the bar.
"This first one is a contract for your services, specifying the $50,000 monthly allowance, so I will need to rewrite and print a new one. This second one, which I need you to sign now, is a non-disclosure agreement."
Steve clenched his jaw and laced his fingers together under the table. He said nothing and Tony continued to speak.
“I didn’t tell you because my life never matters to anyone. My mind does; my life doesn’t. It took me awhile to understand you are different, and that’s why I am telling you. I wanted your opinion because I want you to be with me, whatever choice I make.”
Steve's phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and saw it was a text from the number saved under Pepper Potts.
"They will believe I am different." Steve took Tony's hand in his own and began walking down the street. "It's only a couple blocks away."
Steve found him in there surrounded by six people. There was so much stuff spread out on the bed, and even a makeshift makeup counter was set up off to one side.
CW: Previous Life-Threatening Medical Issue (Dunno if that will trip anyone up, but figure I might as well give you a heads-up.)
“Can see Tony Stark is a fine-looking man. Knowing you, you’re trying to be the perfect gentleman. I wouldn’t have believed you’d so much as kissed him if there weren’t photographs plastered across the internet.”
“I take your silence to mean that right now you are on your bed staring at the ceiling. That’s my point, Steve. I love you, you’re my best friend, you’re the kinda guy I always hope to be. People look up to you, even now. I feel like you don’t know that.”
Steve made his way to the couch and plopped down heavily. He stared at the coffee table and numbed his thoughts until the elevator dinged open a half hour later. Tony walked through the doors with a massive smile on his face and jumped down all three steps to get to the couch. He sat next to Steve and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek.
Thirty minutes and a lot of self-reflecting later, Happy arrived. Steve opened the door with the duffel bag hanging off his shoulder and suitcase rolling along behind him. The photographers hadn’t moved, lenses still pointed in Steve’s direction. He shuffled through them, might have “accidentally” rolled over someone’s toes with his suitcase, and Happy met him at the limousine door.
Steve found Tony in the kitchen, huddled over the stove with a recipe projected from a StarkPad. Steve smiled and said,
“Sounds like him. I was a bit jealous, though. He ate that whole pan of lasagna on the way back to the tower. No leftovers for me.”
"But he ..." Steve trailed off, lost in the memory of Tony's workshop. Lost in heavy metal music and almond-shaped eyes that tempted him into opening up his deepest wound. "I think I liked him."
Tony had to walk away. He paced for a moment and pinched the bridge of his nose before coming to rest once again in front of Steve.
But as it turns out, Tony’s gut or instinct or whatever you want to call it had indeed picked up on some off vibes of sorts, because ten minutes later, when the guy from the morning reaches the counter, he speaks so loudly that Tony himself can hear his words without a problem – something that wouldn’t normally occur, especially with this many people inside.
need to hear his voice, seeing he can’t have the comfort of his arms around his body. And still, he knows the day would be useless was he to not do it. In his chest, his heart is still palpitating so fast that he can feel it in the depth of his throat. His head contains only one name. Tony sighs, moving his thumb to press the green icon, but exactly as he’s about to, the phone starts vibrating in his hand, and on the display, under his incredulous eyes, appears five precious letters.
He lifts up a hand as goodbye and stays there, watching Steve getting onboard and then the helicopter as it lifts off, raising a grey cloud of dust that goes straight into his lungs. He doesn’t move until it’s completely out of sight, not even a small dot in the sky; then he takes a deep breath as he gets walking, wanting so desperately to focus on Steve, and the personal stuff they talked about, and their kisses –
to atone for? Once Pepper asked him if he was ever gonna stop punishing himself. He didn’t know the answer then, and although he doesn’t believe he has it now either, he also feels he’s never going to. Because how can you even consider quitting when you know you can
. He simply can’t believe it. In the span of just ten days, he’s gone from being an ex soldier struggling to find a purpose again in a world that seems to be growing pettier and more violent each day, to not only having a full conversation with the man whom he respect more than anyone else in this world, but to actually
that he has no intention of following his lead – but can’t keep himself from tapping his foot along. When Tony notices it, he bends over and catches his hands, trying to pull him up, a task he eventually succeeds into when Steve decides to actually collaborate.
cheerful, but he doesn’t want them to realize just how much of an old man he’s actually become since they last saw one another. They finally drive to Sam’s apartment after that, much to his relief, as he was starting to fear just exactly what next stop would be. Unfortunately, it doesn’t last very long. Time to put down his bag with the new clothes, that his two friends march into the guest room and demand he gets dressed to the nines because “we’re going out!”. Of course, he moans and groans and protests that really, he’s not in the mood and he’d much rather stay in, but they’re unmovable from their intent and after a tiring ten minutes of back and forth he resigns to the idea and puts his new clothes on. He doesn’t ask where they’re going – it wouldn’t change a thing in the great scheme of things, or that’s what he thinks in that moment. Had he known what the
“We don’t have a choice,” Fury interrupts them now, the tone of one whose patience is running out, “He was the only other person who knew about this safe – he mentioned something about a pact they made before the war became global – and he showed me a letter from Howard Stark in which the powers of these rings are explained. See, the problem is, Stark only had nine of them. One was missing. Still is. And without it, they can’t be used. Now, we believe the robber doesn’t know this
Steve nods and then proceeds to try, failing each of the first ten times. The eleventh is the charm though, and he smiles victoriously as he succeeds: “What now?”
But that never happens, because when Tony gets to work, he is informed that he’s been assigned to a top secret project, one that involves his immediate relocation to an undisclosed town all the way in New Mexico, and before he can protest or object, he finds himself being boarded onto a Greyhound bus without even having the chance to stop by his room, the words ‘duty’ and ‘country’ repeated over and over into his ears. Of course, once he arrives at the new site he tries more than once to call the number Steve gave him, but the line incessantly gives out a flat tune, convincing Tony that maybe the other gave him the wrong digits
Just a couple of seconds later, four people enter the room – two guys and a woman – and even though Steve doesn’t exactly know what he was expecting – possibly other soldiers like him? – the group is definitely
“Point taken…” he surrenders, smirking and staring down at his glass, moving it slowly around just as if it was whiskey and not iced tea, keeping silent for almost a minute before working up the courage to ask, quite abruptly to be honest, the very question he knows deep down to be the very reason of his visit, why this has been his first stop: “So, uh… Do you wanna… go on a date maybe?”
Steve’s voice is distant in his ears, even though he’s just a few inches away. He nods silently, not really wanting to open his mouth for fear muffled sounds might come out of it, and after a couple of seconds he pushes the chair back and stands up, making his way to the window that gives to the external staircase. He looks up at the evening sky and hopes they all got to live full, amazing lives with plenty of happy moments to counterbalance the sad ones. That’s all anyone can hope for in the end, isn’t it?
Hank’s voice sounds distant and remote in his ear, to the point that he needs a few moments to realize he spoke
He’s quick to blink away his puzzlement, but nevertheless has to take a long sip of water in order to conjure up a proper reply.
“Ants? Oh no, are you s—“ he panics for a moment, looking around to spot the insects, only realizing a fraction of a second too late that it had been a sarcastic line. “Ah-ha. Very funny…” he shakes his head, putting down the pot on the table. “Well, I didn’t think you’d be interested. Plus, to be fair, I haven’t seen you around in the last month or so. Thought you  had decided to take a holiday or something…”
, Tony thinks, barely holding a smirk from appearing on his face as, without further ado, he leans one hand on Steve’s back to let him step inside first, following him immediately after and asking the approaching waiter to show them the Danvers table.
instead of just watching hopelessly as cancer took her away, day in and day out. And so, on his sixteenth birthday, Steve had taken the subway to the Army Academy and had handed in his application, the work of almost eighteen months. A couple of months later, he aced his physicals and received a formal offer – by now his body was in full spring mode, growing at an exponential rate which a more scrupulous eye would have undoubtedly noticed. But as it stood, the Army was all to happy to enlist Steve within his ranks, and the doctor gave his approval without further ado. When 9/11 happened, Steve knew instinctively he had made the right decision, and started to grow restless to head to the battlefield overseas. But when he did, a couple of years later, excitement quickly gave way to disbelief, and then frustration (not much dissimilarly as what his own father had experienced, more than a decade earlier, although Steve couldn’t know this).  He tried to justify the wrongs he saw getting committed day in and day out, and then tried to get them to stop, still somehow believing that his fellow soldiers simply didn’t know any
“Fantastic, me neither! And I could use some fresh air, so you’re on. I’ll see you down the lobby in an hour.” Steve has the expression of someone who has just been picked up by a twister and deposited in Oz land; he opens his mouth, trying to find something to object with, but before he can come up with anything Tony talks again: “On second thoughts, come to my room, let’s see what you’ve got. Don’t worry about flowers for now.”
“Right...” the other replies, taking a sip of his wine, hence restoring the natural balance of the universe.
, that Tony is always left wondering about his thoughts, his emotions, sometimes – when he’s feeling particularly low – even his love for him. Tony has accepted and gone along with it for as long as he can remember, thinking that because he wasn’t aware about other people knowing the truth it would be better to make it
“Yes, don’t worry…” the other nods, although his voice sounds a bit rough. “Your shield absorbed most of the blast anyway. What kind of material did you say…?”
In other words, Tony is about to have a proper meltdown, and the worst part is, even if he knows it, he’s at total loss regarding what to do to avoid it, because it’s not quite the continuous lying or the fact that Fury has turned him into a proper Cold War style spy – a role he’s never wanted and that actually despises with every fiber of his being – it’s the almost complete isolation from the life as he knew it before this started. He’s alone, living a double life in a city that resembles New York maybe on Christmas Day (to be generous), the only people he comes in regular contact with are strangers at best and enemies at worst, he’s constantly working and/or worrying about being made and the only company he has once he gets back to the flat is Jocasta, the robot he had initially designed for Steve but that he has now equipped with her own A.I. so that they can play chess together or he can bounce ideas off her. Although he doesn’t want to sound dramatic or over the top (something that he has often been accused of), he simply has no idea how much longer he can keep going like this.
They’re still kissing when a long blip echoes in the room, and there’s no need for Steve to explain what that is because Tony knows already: time to go. They each take a step back and smile almost shyly at each other, then, before any of them can say anything, Steve starts towards the balcony and he follows, running his fingers through his hair whilst thinking of something to say, because he knows he
. A year is a hell of a long time to be gone. People have probably thought him dead. Suddenly, he starts thinking about Steve, and Pepper, and Peter, and Bruce, and the kids Fury told him about before he left. A growing sense of uneasiness mixed with guilt is easily finding its way into his heart.
“… And we both made a promise to each other. But here you go, not showering for days to end, getting into bar fights with drunkards, spending most of the time alone or in the gym. You need—“Don’t say it.”
in the air, along with seemingly everything else as darkness engulfs them both and all their surroundings.
“… the Stone cannot be used.” Tony sighs, passing a hand over his face in despair. This is much worse than what he had been expecting.
Like with most of the decision in his life, Tony hasn’t planned for this one to happen, it sort of just did; could be Saturday evening’s blues, could be the summer ending, could be dozens of other things but the truth simply is that he was missing him. Being an Avenger is not easy, but if you count in owning one of the biggest companies in the whole world on the verge of launching yet another ground-breaking product, then you realize how your life really gets spent either fighting off supervillains or in boring – yet necessary – meetings. And then, if the person you happen to be in love with is
“I can’t let you do that, it’s a suicide mission. God… There must be another plan we can put together, right? Let’s get the Avengers here, brainstorm ideas, something better is
. Surely it’s not the first time he’s shown up at a meeting in a less-than-ideal physical form, right?
“F-Fine, I’m… fine…” the other yells back, not exactly sure how loud his voice is, nor if he actually
Tony nods, and lifts himself on his elbows so that Steve can slip his tags over his head; when they fall on his reactor, he takes them into his hand and reads the writing: “Winghead. Est. May 04
“Only a few moments, the first time did it. You know that I can’t resist you when you kiss me like that…”
, and, as he takes his leave, he can’t stop himself from thinking about all the times when Steve and he would lead the team into a fight with no fear in their heart, not just because what counted was to get the job done, but especially because they knew everyone had they backs, they worked so well together that they were like a perfect mechanism moving all at once. God, how he misses being part of
“Hello there. I have notified the doctor you’re awake. They won’t be long. In the meantime, just relax.”
“Correction,” he interrupts, shaking his head and focusing his eyes elsewhere, because seeing the blue ones in front of him is getting harder and harder with each passing second, “I
that makes sense,” Tony reiterates, and now he drags his chair backwards to stand up. He’s had enough. This is just a waste of time. He should have just done what he thought best, which was going it alone. No strings attached, no fuss. Damn Steve for talking him into involving the others. Damn Steve for doing what he did yesterday.
Tony blinks, trying to restore his attention on what is actually happening and not on the absence in the room, and after a couple of seconds of disorientation he shakes his hand.
Only this time, something is different. He can feel Steve smile first, and then fight against a giggle that nevertheless ends up escaping his lips. Tony frowns, confused, but after just a couple of seconds realizes what’s going on.
“Thank you…” he replies, a bit confused to be honest; Tony wasn’t expecting such a joyous reaction, it sounds weird and out of place, especially considering that, well, they won’t be
– or he would be in an even bigger mess right now. Because of course, there’s brotherly love and everything, but that’s
“Yeah, well, how else am I supposed to get your attention, Tony? I can’t even remember when was the last time I’ve seen you outside an Avengers mission,” he hits back, deciding to enjoy this all too familiar teasing before they inevitably have to face the seriousness of the situation. “Hell, these days you see
“I swear to god, Nick, if you say ‘Congratulations’ I’m gonna punch you in the face.” he sighs, rubbing his eyes to try and get rid of some of the exhaustion he’s feeling, and not just because it’s the dead of the night.
. Even when they fight, they always have each other’s back, no matter what. They always go back to one another.
“Welcome to the club…” he agrees, and then stands up, because this is dragging over for too long and he’s quite sure he’s going to be able to hear his own heart start to give way if he doesn’t get out of this house in the next couple of minutes. “I gotta go now or I’ll never be able to.”
But before another silent question can take form into his brain, a shiver runs down his whole body as his belt first and his zip then get undone, exposing his nakedness.
– a world map comes up and coordinates begin to run quickly all across it, as the calibration starts working. Tony breathes out a long sigh of relief and finally lets himself go against the back of the chair, much to his knotted tummy’s approval.
to connect with new people, no matter their age or background. Also, someone who doesn’t care about consequences, if his impressions are right. For all he knew, Fury could have knocked him out or detained him or
restored the natural order of things. Surely nobody is gonna be suicidal enough to invade us, I’d say for a couple of years at least. You know, the human race almost ranks as the stupidest among all the others, and the ones below us are in no position whatsoever to even have an army to defend themselves, let alone to go toe-to-toe with
Steve and he officially started dating, a detail made clear by their overprotective, vigilant and possessive stances, always alert, afraid that a sudden, out-of-nowhere danger might pop up at any given second to rob them from this unexpected – albeit much wished for – happiness that is nothing more than everyone else’s normality. As if following their own thought, his eyes end up stopping on a particular picture, the same one Tony was so hard trying to ignore: their wedding day, a few years back. In it, they’re standing in front of the officiant and facing each other, hopelessly stargazing into their respective eyes, hands together as hearing the words bound to change their lives forever. Steve is dressed up in blue and Tony in red, and although you could never tell by the picture, Steve hadn’t liked this idea at all for the longest time, but if you were to ask him right in that moment, he would have said that Tony looked
, he tries to reassure himself, but the only effect that has is to make him feel guilty, because it’s not just his life on the line, it’s other people’s too, and he’s never been comfortable with that. He had said yes to his father in 1942 because the old man had told him he would have asked someone
“Fuck this shit, I don’t need to be protected, I need to know what the fuck is going on! I risk my life every fucking day to get this information out and then I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do with it because guess what?, I can’t give it to anyone, because there is nobody I can safely get in touch with! How is this a good plan, Nick?”
But Tony shakes his hand, depositing his credit card on the small metal plate on top of the paper: “This is not a real date though, so
Steve stands up now and puts his hands on top of Tony’s shoulders, looking into his eyes and whispering gently: “All I want… is you. The rest I can do without. Besides, we agreed we’ll do this
“When did you wake up?” Tony asks eventually, just to make conversation, just to fill that total lack of sound that is now weighing on their heads.
“You feel alright?” he asks, and again the question feels stupid and out of place in this situation. His throat yells silently in pain.
They should hug, but they don’t. He’s scared of what his mind could conjure up in those few seconds. Unwanted memories. Painful feelings. He gives her the faintest of smiles and then he’s on his way.
and appealing, so to speak (apparently style is really important nowadays, compared to his time). He’s given up the total gold for a few touches of red. And everything is less
“And I talk way too much, that’s why we work so well together” he interrupts him, mostly because he wants to understand what the hell is happening. “Just spit it out, Rogers, c’mon.”
“Yeah, it’s credible enough. My only concern is Ross, to be honest. He knows Steve is my soft spot, he might not totally buy my cover, especially if it puts me against him. After the Sokovia Accords and Siberia, he
“Uh, I guess I was in a fight…” he replies before too long, waving a dismissive hand in the air and letting himself slouch on the nearest free chair. He throws a quick look around the table to see who else is in the room and is more than surprised to see Jen Walters in there, but even more so when his eyes land on Thor. “Woah, dude, what happened to your
and figures he might want to help anyone who could convince him that he’s in danger. Sometimes it’s hard to be able to see the bigger picture, especially when you’re only eighteen. Tony learned this on his own skin the hardest way.
But before he can finish his sentence, Tony does the only thing that could get Steve to come around, or at least so he hopes, because he
, but the truth is, the lack of improvement is in itself a very bad sign. Wallowing in his misery is not his style, and yet here he is, going through day after day with no thoughts about the future, taking unjustified risks in the heat of a fight, spending every spare moment of his free time in the gym, training for something that has already happened without him being able to do anything to stop it. He’s the one Avenger who spends every single night in the Tower – the rest come and go during down times – mostly by himself except for when Sam drops by to check on him, or Peter knocks on his window to chat about baseball (something that Steve has no doubt Tony asked the kid to do – when exactly, he has no idea). They both stopped by today to invite him to spend the holiday week with them, only a couple of hours away from each other in fact, and since he was expecting this to happen, Steve had managed to come up with a lie constructed well enough to hold, leaving them both convinced he had already accepted an invitation from the other. With that out of the way, he had spent the rest of the day in the gym, punching bags and running on the treadmill, whilst FRIDAY kept screening films about the Second World War on the big TV following his request. After the briefest of Christmas Eve dinners and interrupting a couple of bank robberies on his own – these days he would listen to police frequencies as a person would listen to a podcast – he had come back to his room in the Tower and let himself on his bed with his dirty clothes still on, twisting and turning until sleep eventually caught up with him.
. Because although it terrifies him, he has realized he’s tired of lying to himself. Yes, Steve is a man, and no, he has never thought about men in such a context in his life before, but so what? Life is full of surprises – you can tap out in the Forties and wake up in a new millennium, so really, this is
to one another. Which is why my location was discovered by them baddies. Now, Steve here has told me my father’s chest with the nine rings got stolen, and that’s how you’ve come to know about them, right? Well, then you understand how
Steve can’t help the thought that surfaces inside his head, although he doesn’t speak that out loud.
It’s not much to go on, but Steve does find the thought comforting somehow. He nods: “Keep me posted, please.”
The blonde slightly narrows his eyes at him, as to detect whether he’s pulling his leg (he’s not). Then:
“Why you keep calling it ‘Giant’, by the way?” Steve asks out of nowhere when the movie credits start rolling on screen. The question catches Tony off guard, and he takes a few seconds to realize what it refers to.
Tony is on his feet now, walking towards the window, his eyes observing the darkness of the night outside. The room is dimly lit, still, Steve is sure he can read concern hanging in the air. A weird sensation that unsettles him, and a persistent silence that he needs to break.
“I’d knock, but there’s no way of doing that, so… Mind if I come in?” he asks from the outside, secretly hoping for a positive answer. It comes, amidst the intonation of a smile. And although he’s not someone who gets easily embarrassed, for some reason he feels his face burning up as he makes his way inside. “Sorry to bother you…” he then adds, but Steve is already propping himself up on his elbows, shaking his head vigorously.
“Likewise,” he says, leaning against the wall next to him as the band starts playing the mellow notes of Moon River, one of the most played songs on the radio in the last few weeks, so much so that Tony’s mind has effortlessly memorized its words, and now he hums them along softly, more to himself than to anyone else’s benefit.
need is what is driving him, so he lets the pager on the passenger’s seat and picks up the phone instead, unlocking it with his retina and pressing the right bottom corner to make the call.
“What? Why would you even think of that…” the other sighs, letting Tony’s hands go and sitting next to him with his legs crossed between continuing: “It’s not a condom. It’s… Well, I should really say something first, okay?”
“I tried to tell him that too…” he sighs, but Steve is not really paying attention now, he’s mostly ranting to himself.
about Steve. “Anyway, this is Captain Steve Rogers, everyone. Captain, these here are Bruce, Janet and Hank. They’re gonna be your teammates, if you agree to come on board.”
” he pauses, hit by a sudden idea, looking up as he resumes talking: “Wait, do you think it’s actually this… alien who’s pulling the strings, and not Fury? Should we be…
“I know you’ve been laying low but it’s not gonna be long until people start to realize you’re back. When that happens, I need you to come out and say publicly you support him.”
– not Steve, not the Hulk – can take it away from him. Tony has been prepping himself up to this for years now. He’s not scared of dying, he doesn’t
Tony sighs deeply, passing a hand over his face to take a moment; he doesn’t want Steve in his room, he doesn’t want to hear the sound of his voice, or having the smell of his aftershave on his clothes; it’s all too much right now, and he can’t deal with this on top of everything else.
“See? This is why I hate goodbyes…” he murmurs eventually, unaware of how much has passed since the last time he spoke: maybe minutes, maybe an hour, time is so relative when you lose yourself in the moment, isn’t it?
life, albeit without him in it – now he doesn’t know what to do with himself. The team is… well, over, of this he’s sure of. The Avengers always felt like his and Tony’s, and now that he’s gone – now that
But the rest of his words get swallowed up by the sirens of the police cars arriving outside and, only a bunch of seconds later, an authoritative voice speaks through a megaphone: “Attention, please. This is the SCPD. You are surrounded. The door is now unlocked, so come out with your hands in the air and nobody will get hurt.”
to the functioning not only of his suit, but of the whole base too. And it’s only now that he’s mentioned it to himself that Tony realizes something
had one, Fury cornered him in such a way that would have been impossible to say no; foremost, he knew all too well that even if he had declined, Steve would have 100% stayed behind, and at that point what good would his refusal have done? He was better than that.
Does Steve believe him? If he had any money, he would bet he doesn’t. He’s far too smart to fall for Tony’s poor performance.
“… Good to go where, exactly?” Tony asks, one of his brows arched in a way that makes him look like a professor faced with an incredibly stupid question.
, he can’t help but thinking as he takes a few steps towards the front door, almost falling over because, to put it gently, his body needs to get used to gravity all over again, something that he had completely pushed aside in his brain. It happens when you’ve been gone for a year.
– is about to come out of it, and he doesn’t like it one bit. His body automatically moves to protect the other whilst the private reaches out for her gun, reading his movement right. The second after, Loki makes his entrance, nonchalantly, although he stops almost immediately when he realizes he’s not alone as he expected to be.
“Tony...” it’s almost a plea, his name pronounced as if it was self explanatory on its own, and maybe it is.
, and the late nights when they’d go back to the Avengers Tower after a mission and they’d collapse next to each other on the sofa or in one of their beds; he’s missed waking up in the morning and seeing him still fast asleep, and rolling over to him and breathing quietly against the back of his neck, not a single thought in his head, only that vague sense of peace and easiness that only came when he slept next to him. He’s missed being the last ones out of the QuinJet so they could kiss each other good luck before going into battle, and the look that everybody gave them whenever they argued over stupid little things in the kitchen, or during game evenings; he’s missed smiling and laughing at jokes that wouldn’t normally entertain him one bit, but when was Steve telling them it was like everything was

it a second time is just too much to handle, especially when you’ve been deprived of the one person who always seemed to have an answer for anything, and even if he didn’t, he wouldn’t rest until he found one. But now Tony was gone, and he was alone again trying to make sense of everything, without any idea or hope of actually being able to.
“I bet. The doc was surprised to hear you were already awake. Though by the time we got back you were out again, so I’m not sure whether that actually counts…”
“Malta? What happened in Malta?” Steve frowns, genuinely confused now, and Tony knows at once the reason why the name doesn’t ring any bell to the other man.
Steve gives him a look that is half confused half surprised before pulling his phone out of his pocket, quickly typing in something and showing it to him: “I don’t know then. Maybe they changed it because it sounded better?”
Of course he does. Only, he doesn’t have a rational explanation for what prompted it, and that’s scares him more than anything else. Can he postpone this moment to later? He definitely
, plus to finance a couple of superhero teams who have the very annoying tendency of breaking things, so I need to make ends meet.”
, and I used to go along with it because what’s the harm in it, right?” he shrugs, looking at the empty glass in front of him and wishing they had already ordered wine. He checks if the maître is around but can’t spot it:
“Jarvis? Activate the medical bay, pronto. And call in Dr. Brent, there’s been some sort of emergency and I’m not taking risks,” he commands his A.I., and has been walking so fast that by the time his last word leaves his mouth he’s already on his way to the rooftop. Five minutes later, the jet lands tentatively on the tarmac, and it just takes Tony the briefest of glances to detect that whatever or whoever hit it did a significant damage to the vehicle. But he couldn’t care less about that right now, not when he doesn’t have a status on his teammates, so he runs towards the plane, not even waiting for it to come to a full stop, and starts shouting at it, as if his voice could be heard from within the vehicle. Just a few seconds later, the door opens and he sprints inside, but before he can climb more than a couple of steps Nat rushes out to stop him, placing a firm hand over his chest and searching for his eyes.
“So how was space?” asks Steve after a while, munching along. Tony should be surprised that he knows, but it doesn’t take much to figure out who the leak was.
to say it, no matter how many times he tries to put some coherent thought together in his mind. Once they’re in New York again, Pepper and he spend a couple of weeks away from everyone and every possible piece of technology ever invented, alone on a forgotten island in the middle of the Pacific which doesn’t even appear on ordinary maps and very few people even know about. He figures he owns her this much, to say the
He shrugs the hand off – something he wouldn’t have actually managed to do if the security guard hadn’t loosened his grip himself – and smiles to Pepper, following her back into her office as she nods at him to. Much to his surprise, it’s still full of boxes and the furniture is randomly pushed one against the other in a corner of the room, all except the big glass desk that stands boldly right in the middle, a laptop opened on its surface, and two chairs in front of it.
“Captain Rogers, Director Fury. Our guest just woke up a few minutes ago. Doctor Hang asked me to come fetch you both immediately.”
It takes a while, but eventually his brain starts gearing up again whilst a helicopter is flying him to the hospital. With the sniper still at large, possibly ready to strike again, he decides the only smart thing to do is to let the world believe the person who did it… succeeded. He can’t bring himself to say the exact words out loud, even if he really should. Because doing it would mean entertaining, even just as a mere possibility, that idea, and sorry, he’s not doing it, not now, not ever. Steve is Steve, right? He’s America’s one and only super soldier. He’s been around for nearly a century. A stupid and insignificant human mercenary is not going to do much damage now, is it? What a nonsense.
Steve and Tony take their respective seats next to one another; the rest of the team doesn’t tease them about it like they used to, nor they greet them in any way rather than a general nod. There’s only silence in the aircraft, and pretty soon that gets covered by a whizzing noise as the engine is turned on and the jet lifts up in the air. The plan is simple enough: go for the head. There are no specifics, no strategy, no alternatives: they don’t have that sort of luxury anymore.
Which means the police is going to do it. The realization hits Mr. Field quicker than Tony would have liked: although his sight is blurry now, he can read it in the way the older guy’s body freezes for just a second.
He definitely hadn’t even considered this opportunity, although it makes perfect sense. Was he expecting the whole world to just stop rotating merely because he had decided to take time off? Of course he had, but that’s beyond the point. He doesn’t exactly know how to feel about this, and the confusion must be showing on his face because Pepper gives out a chuckle after the silence goes on a bit too long.
He sighs deeply, taking his face into his hands for a short while before looking up at Fury again: “How do we do this?”
He keeps his eyes on her, looking away whenever Mr. Field turns to him to avoid raising suspicions, whilst praying to whatever god there is up there – if there is, indeed, one – that nobody will get hurt as a result of his attempt.
the ‘Giant’ part of the name, and made sure to get rid of it when they decided the world needed to know at least part of the truth.
anyway, even though god knows it could happen without warning…” he sighs, remembering for a moment what a giant mess their country is right now and that he is indeed one of the few people that could stand in the way of the president was he to lose his patience with one of their sworn enemies. “It’s just that… I kinda lost it a bit, after Malta. I couldn’t get out of my mind the thought of you getting hurt, and not being able to help you, or even just…
, they’re all good and fine nowadays, which is great, of course, but in my days… well, you know. You just caught me off guard, that’s all.”
it would be brought up sooner or later the moment the other mentioned having his file; what hits him is that suddenly his own recollection of what happened on that day is brought up to question.
Janet’s voice breaks the spell they both seemed to have fallen under, forcing them to focus on the mission again.
he reflects, and somehow he finds this description to be fitting enough. He tries to access his memories, to find any trace that could help him decipher this mystery, but it’s no use. His mind feels blank as a USB stick after being restored. And before he knows it, he’s out once again.
idea of basics – which means mostly liquids (especially iced coffee) and only occasionally food (cheeseburgers always delivered straight to his door). He sleeps rarely and badly, twisting and turning into his bed in the early hours of the new day before he realizes just how much of a lost cause this is and gets up, thinking that the sooner he finishes, the sooner Steve is safer, the sooner the plan can advance, the sooner this nightmare of reality will be over. After two days, he has perfected what will be their main way of communication, an improved, twenty-first century version of an old school pager, capable of sending slightly longer messages and almost 100% secure (he gets it down to 99.7%). He’s so excited about it that immediately sends it over to Steve’s mailbox and, as soon as he receives the signal back, he frantically presses three numbers: 823. He doesn’t
Fury shakes his head now, filling in the sentence hanging in the air: “You’re not naïve enough to believe this bullshit. That explosion in Afghanistan? How do you think you survived?”
“When you got hurt… it was like something flipped inside of me, and I couldn’t figure out why. When I think back to it now, well, it’s kinda obvious, but if you had told me two months ago…” he chuckles lightly, shaking his head to himself.
for the longest time, the thought never even entering his brain. How could it? It was enough to lose Tony for all of seven years – time he so wishes he could reclaim back, only it doesn’t work that way, does it? – but now that it’s
“That goes for you too, pal. Next time you try something, you’ll get the other end of the gun, understood?”
you because, y’know, stupid laws and stuff. Like if that happened when you were in Europe or something, it would be… soul destroying not only to know you’re suffering, but being kept from you. Eventually I figured we could do something small here, more for precaution than anything else, really, and I’d understand if you were not up for it, I just… I just wanted to put this out there and get your thoughts on it.”
For a long while neither of them speak, and as the silence goes on Tony grows more and more uncomfortable. Then, just as he was about to cave in and agree to his proposal, Fury talks again: “Alright Stark. I wish you good luck. Do get in touch when you get back, don’t let me have to come to you,
They smile at each other, and for a moment it’s like nothing has happened between them and they’re not in a stinky and cold hospital room where one of their lives is hanging by a thread. For a moment they are back at the mansion, sitting next to each other on the sofa in front of the TV, waiting for everyone else to go to sleep so they can cuddle and kiss and make love to forget about fighting criminals and evil masterminds and feel wholesome again. Then Steve starts coughing, his heart rate slightly increases and so does the blip on the monitor, and the moment passes but Tony doesn’t want to let it go, because the reality they live in now sucks and it could even get worse just with a snap of fingers.
“You’ve become such a wimp, Stark, get a grip of yourself! You’re acting like you’re the only one doing any work!”
But then Mark says a line that hits him in the guts, and he finds himself standing up to follow him to the dance floor: “Come
Tony sighs deeply, rubbing his forehead and staying silent because he wouldn’t know what to say, not yet; a vague idea has started forming in his brain as hearing Steve talking, but he’s not very fond of it and doesn’t want it to share until he has more data. That is, if it’s still possible to speak in such terms now.
Steve looks at him slightly confused, although his smile is more revealing than anything he could ever say right now. He nods, taking it into his hands, weighing it and – Tony can easily guess – marveling at how
Of course he does. And of course these words make all the sense in the world. Tony slowly nods and gives him half a smirk: “Alright, hot shot, we get it, you’re very…
“This song was in the top ten when I came out of the ice, just how old your playlist is?” asks Steve, frowning even though it’s clear that he approves of the choice.
“… What?” the other man blinks and comes to a halt, as if those four words had literally paralyzed him. And maybe they have.
“I’m actually not sure, I… kind of lost track of time, I was reading up on this… Final Host, but it doesn’t make much sense to me, seems like I’m missing something…”
“I don’t know what you remember, but those missiles that thing was shooting at us, well, one exploded right between your feet, sent you flying quite a few feet away. I only caught a shadow of something being thrown off, thought it was a bin or a table, not…” he pauses, shaking his head, and sighs softly before continuing: “Anyway, then I heard Janet yelling your name, saw it was you…”
– to say now, and this time nothing or nobody will stop him from doing it. He’s wasted too much time
They wouldn’t, matter of fact, but Steve does, eyes wide open with shock and surprise as witnessing just how
he gets there, when everyone will start wondering where he had been before then. It’s always like this with corporate events, everybody is bored out of their minds until they’re
“Bruce mentioned… he has a place. Offered to put Bucky, Sam and I up until we figure something out. With… you know, whatever happens now. Like do we pretend five years didn’t go by? What about money? And properties? And…” he stops before his words become an overflowing torrent. He shakes his head and tries to give Pepper a smile, which doesn’t quite appear. “Sorry. I’ll be okay.”
Fueled by the knowledge that things seem to finally be picking up, Tony spends the following two weeks busying himself with copying as many files and memos that happen to be in open violation of domestic and international laws as he sets his eyes on; still not having been able to figure out a way to smuggle his glasses in, he ends up doing it all manually, a task that often requires hours to end, and that makes him fall asleep on his desk before he has the chance to leave the office or to even get some food down his throat. The only time he actually manages to go home is the evening before his flight, and he forces himself to do it just to give FRIDAY a chance to digitalize every single paper so he doesn’t have to carry around a very suspicious (and very heavy) pile of papers along. Once on the private jet, his plan involves going over the actual subject of the NATO meeting, something that he has not had the chance to even glance at since it was deposited on his desk. He opens the folder and starts reading, but before he gets to the bottom of the very first page, his eyes fall shut and sleep finally catches up to him.
And that’s exactly what he does, each and every time. He gets on stage wearing an old Iron Man gauntlet, someone from the crowd punctually throws something in the air which he blows off – this was an explicit request from the President, and he was not wrong because people absolutely go
After what happens – after the funeral, when everybody goes back to whatever life can be lead now, pretending the last five years never happened, because for half of the global population they actually
“Let’s go.” Tony replies in more or less the same tone, stepping outside his room and following the other man outside, where the Quinjet is waiting for them.
. He nods to signal that he understands, staying there in silence, because he could talk and talk for all the few minutes they have left, but what would be the point anyway? He can say what he wants to say with his eyes, and that’s exactly what he does now, taking one of Steve’s hands and leaning it on his cheek, locking his glance with his and smiling softly, feeling his heartbeat slow down and his chest relax. Steve nods, rubbing his thumb on Tony’s cheek before leaning in for another kiss, this one lasts longer and is more intimate, as if they both want to store the memory of it deep down in their brains, so they could revisit it in the days to come.
,” his eyes finally managing to leave the laptop to find the others’ just as a big grin emerges on his lips.
“Hard to pass on someone when he calls you by your name even though you’ve never met him,” he replies, and although sarcasm is not a weapon he often uses, this time it seems like a reasonable choice..
, but Cap? Although he would never admit it out loud, Cap holds a special place in his heart, always has. Don’t they say you should never meet your heroes? Yeah, Tony guesses that’s part of the reason why. You inevitably get attached beyond your wildest expectations, and especially in this line of work, that comes with a very dangerous price.
“Sheer luck,” he answers, trying to ignore how stupid and weak his explanation now sounds. Thing is, the episode – the proverbial last straw, which led to him abandoning his childhood dream – still haunts his sleep. When the convoy found itself under enemy fire, nobody in his platoon survived except for him. Somehow, in the explosion that followed the bullet rain, his body didn’t report any injuries despite being thrown a few feet away with such strength that the other soldiers were killed instantly on impact. Not him. He simply… bounced back up.
Steve giggles softly, nodding and taking a step back now, as if he had just got back to reality; he looks at Tony, struggling to find something to say, knowing that he
Okay, so, the good news is that this is, indeed, an Avengers gig, which honestly, is already making him feel much better, despite the slight oddness due to the fact that it appears T’Challa is the one
“And you don’t even live with him, go figure...” Steve replies in an attempt to lighten up the mood, moving towards him. “Lean back, come on…”
Steve wants to shout something now, maybe to shake the other out of the trance he seems to have fallen into.
, not answering. But it’s all for nothing, because Fury lets himself in anyway and goes straight to sit on his bed.
– the one from the Forties if you can believe it – an awkward smile on his face and a hand raised as to say hello. “What are you wearing?” Tony sighs, only now realizing just how
he considers in his own mind, definitely not a fan as he witnesses this happening. Steve himself seems a bit taken aback from this question, as if he wasn’t expecting it.
Steve nods – mostly as a vote of self-confidence, hoping for the best – and takes a slow sip from his beer to take some time, thinking, before eventually shaking his head in defeat.
Steve looks at him, staying silent and leaning his hand upon his, rubbing his thumb against it for a while before replying: “You know, I think about the same thing pretty much every day. Not the… wedding part, but you getting hurt. I’m scared someone is going to figure out the mole is you and act upon it, like I don’t know, sending you off to a CIA base or something, I’ve heard all kinds of horror stories recently and I just…” he shakes his head to himself, taking a deep sigh before continuing. “I hate this situation and what’s worse is that we have no idea how long this is gonna go on for, the leaks are
“Either this neighborhood has just gotten ten times more dangerous, or it did, Steve. The ring is gone.” Tony replies, biting his lip as the reality hits him. He hopes he hasn’t been too arrogant, thinking he had mastered modern tracking devices and such. Only one way to know for sure. He stands up again, ignoring the light dizziness that hits him as he does, and in a few quick steps he reaches the table in the kitchenette, powering up the laptop lying on it before letting himself go on one of the chairs.
And it’s not because he doesn’t know what he would like to say, on the contrary. There are so many damn things he only wishes he could express out loud, but they all seem…
“The robot I sent over to your farm to install the security system…” he replies, holding in a chuckle because, even if his eyes are still closed, he can well picture the other’s puzzled expression.
, if you’ll pass my Latin. I keep a low profile, stay out of the limelight. For the time being it’ll have to do.”
way. He tries and move his body, but no response arises. So he tries to speak, but no word comes out of his mouth.
“Cheers to that…” echoes Carol, nodding, and Steve is glad he isn’t taking a sip of any sort of liquid right now because he’s quite sure he would have ended up spilling it out of his mouth and all over the table.
He shakes his head, takes a breath, trying to focus his attention on something else, namely his hair; he could go to the restroom, but doesn’t want to risk Steve arriving and not finding him there, so he grabs the phone out of his pocket and, just as if he was a teenager, he opens the camera, flips it to portrait mode and looks at his face. It seems that even his hair, usually always in place, always perfectly smoothed, has decided to go against him today, because the more he looks at it, the more it looks messy and greasy even if it’s neither. He’s just started fiddling with it when the noise of rotor blades becomes the only thing he can hear; he lifts up his head just in time to see a helicopter (his own) slowly descending on to the roof. He tries to swallow some tension down but his throat is dry and doesn’t want to collaborate, so he smooths inexistent creases on his shirt with his hands as taking the few steps that separate him from the chopper. A few moments after, he sees Steve’s head peek out, looking around for him before stepping down, his expression between someone who is ready to kill him and – maybe – secret enjoyment – Tony can’t quite decipher it, not right now anyway.
Tony thinks, but then a voice inside of him makes him notice how he can’t be sure it’s only been a day and not… what? A week? A month? A
Tony, who has been staring at the weapon since it made his appearance, needs a couple of seconds to remember his training and put it into action, so to speak. He shoots what he hopes to be a reassuring glance over at Miss Goodwin, who is trembling like a leaf by now, and then tries to get closer to Mr. Field, but before he can even complete a single step, there’s a deafening noise in the air and this time Tony knows at once that the situation has just taken a turn for the worst, because there is clearly a
The first venture out in the world takes place about a week later, after they’ve practiced enough to at least
Tony is about to reply, but all of a sudden his brain seems to be aligning itself and he understands at once what was bothering him. He shoots an angry look at Nick, and when he talks he can barely contain his feelings: “You
Tony swallows, throwing his head back to let Steve kissing him again as he starts walking out of the living room, carrying him in his arms, knowing that he meant every word.
, so he resumes walking, turning around Steve, who stays there, still looking ahead of himself, at the space that Tony has now left empty.
“Bite me…” he replies on the defensive, stretching towards the can to take another sip, but before he can reach it Steve proves to have taken his words
So he stays silent, and just lightly brushes his pinky finger against the other’s hand, his glance fixed on the swaying couples on the floor, a tight knot in his throat because he can’t believe what he has just done. But before he can get overcome by second thoughts, the gesture is returned, his heartbeat picks up pace, and a joyful smile quickly occupies the width of his face.
is your country, no matter how badly it treats you. So I knew that, if it ever was gonna come down to choose between doing what you think is right and me, well… I wouldn’t stand a chance, would I? When it started to become clear that was the path we were going towards, I let you go.” he pauses, smiling a little and lowering his eyes. “I did it so that when enough time had passed, we could still have a chance.”
“Coffee, uh?” Steve repeats, his mind already going to a specific place in Brooklyn which he thinks the other would like – which is a bit weird, considering he has no idea about the guy’s actual likes.
.” Tony replies, trying to keep a straight face, but he can’t deny that he’s enjoying this, especially because the other is complaining, and he
about him – and in the end he loosens up the tie, undoes a couple of buttons and shows Rhodey the tag, smiling awkwardly.
“This… This is beautiful,” he eventually manages, lifting his glance from the sketch to meet those azure eyes that have been impressed in his memory ever since he first saw them.
Still, as he makes his way out of the car and into the bank, Tony can’t help but wishing he hadn’t behaved like he did, because after his outburst Jarvis had not come anywhere near him until he left, not even whilst he was having breakfast (usually he’d get distracted for a reason or another only to find the kitten either licking butter off his toast or with his tiny paw inside his coffee). He had tried calling him with a soft voice and even a few treats just before opening the front door, but Jarvis hadn’t come anyway, and when five minutes has gone by Tony had had to give up to not be late for work. Still,  his mind has kept going back to the kitten throughout the whole ride, and even now his thoughts are all for Jarvis, home alone for the next twelve hours.
, something always lingering in the air – you could tell it’s there but still can’t exactly point down what it is, or how to
Maybe it’s the seriousness in his voice, maybe because he’s just used the nickname nobody else knows about except for them two, but Steve understands at once what he needs to do.
“That is… absolutely disgusting…” he mutters, their lips still locked together, and his remark sends Steve out in a frantic laughter that finally interrupts their kiss. He looks down at his hand, shaking it rapidly as he tries to resist the urge to clean it off against his shirt, because
Then he would probably beg him for forgiveness, which is not the same as apologizing, because while the latter would be professional, the former is…
As to follow a secret code, Tony stands up, announcing that he needs a toilet break, and heads towards the restroom, but it’s not long until a sniff of familiar perfume gets to his nostrils, giving him a heads-up before Carol materializes by his side.
“Anyway, then I saw you on TV, at the Inauguration, and I don’t know, something kind of clicked in my brain, because all of a sudden I got this idea stuck into my mind, and I just couldn’t get it out of there, until eventually… well, I figured, in our line of work, you never know what’s gonna happen tomorrow, right?”
, he then realizes, and it’s the first thought that actually makes sense, although he really wishes it wouldn’t, because if it turns out to indeed be true… well, then things are bound to be complicated as hell. He shakes his head to himself, takes a deep breath and makes his entrance in the meeting room.
, under the incredulous eyes of the cops of the district, and he doesn’t expect to be held here for long – the time that word of his decision reaches Washington and the FBI will show up in the blink of an eye, ready to take him under their custody, which means jail of the highest security, isolated cells, no chance of having external contact whatsoever.
he thinks – when he reaches the spot the light reflected upon, he notices an opening, big enough for him to fit through.
With the AP finally out of the way and a couple of weeks free from international commitments, Tony can finally divert all of his attention to figure out a way to sneak his glasses inside his office, as no matter what Nick claims, he’s fully aware that no journalist or audience would ever take seriously handwritten copies of whatever deal, no matter how dangerous or criminal that might be. The breakthrough arrives on a Friday night/Saturday morning in early May, when he manages to come up with an algorithm which should obliterate the metal detector’s signal for just a couple of seconds in a way that – he hopes – would be impossible for the human eye to register. He tests it against every security loophole that he can think of, and when it passes them all, he feels confident enough to try it on the big stage – and which better day than on a Saturday, when the office is less busy than usual? With that thought in mind, he finally collapses on his bed, telling FRIDAY to wake him up at 9 so he can go in.
make me happy, Tony, even when I can’t stand the sight of you. Even then, I’m glad you’re in my life because you’ve become a guiding sign for me, believe it or not. And I know this is nothing new to you, I know
He sighs deeply and throws a quick glance to his companion, trying to guess whether he’s having similar thoughts or not. Surely enough, words quickly come out of his mouth: “You alright, Steve?”
What is going on? Something involving getting medical assistance for sure, and well, the fragmented message is indication enough that the jet has been hit by more than just mere lightning. Or at least that’s what his brain is telling him.
“I did, but I decided to draw a line when it became a matter of diverting funds and resources to pursue fugitives across the globe. Yes, they went against the law, but they weren’t Avengers anymore at that point, they were basically living like hobos, so I thought we could use that money to do something more… practical, like training new recruits to have people ready in case of an emergency. Which, by the way, it
“I’d say a solid 2.5, maybe even 3. Definitely can improve on it, but the sentiment was good. You should try and work more... details into it. Like, no classified information or anything of that sort, but the personal kind. Bucky or your mum, for example.” he hurries to add, as he could already read in the other’s glance some alarm bell (“
about what that means, I’m gonna start freaking out.” Steve blinks as hearing himself, and by his reaction Tony is able to elaborate a new theory:
silence, Tony can’t help but worrying about Steve being apparently submerged in it. He’s only been here for five minutes, and already wants to blast something out of the sound system, just to make everything feel
“Just one moment…” Steve replies from inside, opening up a few seconds later, with wet, messy hair and a bathrobe on. He frowns and sighs deeply as seeing Tony, who in returns blinks, puzzled – albeit relieved – to see the other not bearing anything more than a few, almost unnoticeable, scratches on his face.
, he thinks to himself, standing up and taking the flowers from the other’s hands, sniffing them and closing his eyes to avoid a slight fluster from conquering his cheeks.
Loki is fuming as he bounces back up, surprising both Steve and Tony, but instead of attacking again, he swiftly opens up the portal and disappears into it, the same way he had appeared only a few minutes earlier. Tony can’t believe their luck. Another trick would have been the end of them all. As to give confirmation of his supposition, the suit gives a faint sigh of exhaustion and shuts down, giving Tony just enough time to get out of it. With Loki gone, the force that was holding the locker in place against Steve ends, and he pushes it aside effortlessly, although the gesture is missed by Tony, on his knees and out of breath.
But he can’t finish his thought because the door opens and, sure enough, Steve’s face peeks out, his eyes doubling in size as they land on Tony, and he can see Steve fighting against a smile that wants to spread on his lips. For a couple of seconds neither of them is able to speak a word or even just make a move, and the whole scene looks surreal, as if they were kids rehearsing their school play for the very first time. Steve hasn’t changed – not surprisingly, although it still amazes him every time – and Tony can’t help but wondering if his own face has, on the other had. He was so busy making recordings and writing down his thoughts that he completely forgot about basic things like checking his appearance (or his body) to see if his special adventure had left any noticeable mark on him.
forgot anything in the whole time he’s known him). He picks up his phone, starts rummaging through the apps until he finds the prototype of one he’s been working on, some sort of tracking signal for the active members of the team, remembering how the other had volunteered to try it out. But just as he’s launching it, a voice prompts him to lift up his glance from the phone.
“Son of a bitch…” is the private’s comment, but all Tony cares about is the taller shadow pre-announcing Steve’s body getting closer again.
it, but all that Steve does is hunching his shoulders before replying, clearly wanting an answer sooner rather than later so he can move on and deal with the embarrassment that he’s now feeling.
, he thinks as Steve stands up and begins pacing up and down the living room, spitting out so many words in one go that Tony can’t recall another time when he got so long-winded.
Unexpectedly, it’s the whirring of the rotor blades that catches his attention before he has the chance to spot the vehicle, which comes into sight only a few seconds later; Tony takes a deep breath, feeling the sun burning against his skin, hot as hell, and takes a step back as the helicopter begins its descent, whirling sand around in every direction, and some of it even manages to end up in his eyes, supposedly shielded behind his sunglasses. He takes them off to rub it away, then puts a smile on his face as spotting Steve climbing off the vehicle and looking around for him, his heart beating so fast in his chest that he fears it might break it; he lifts up a hand, giving him a shout too for good measure, and before he knows it two strong arms are embracing his whole body, pulling him into a grip so tight that he feels like grasping for breath after a second or two.
“You’re just… out of practice, that’s all,” Tony offers supportively, before coming up with a prompt he hopes will do the trick: “Okay, why don’t you tell me why is so important to you to be a superhero. You can do that, right?”
“Forever is such a… human concept. You need to stop thinking in those terms. They are useless here.”
“… And here I was, thinking you had turned into a farmer.” Tony forces himself to smile after a couple of seconds, because that’s all that he can offer for the time being.
“So, how can I help you?” Grey asks him, and although he resents this man on a deep level, he can’t but be relieved that he’s going straight to the point, saving precious time to both of them.
“Yeah, sure, why not?” Tony hears himself replying instead, because let’s be honest, despite having a QI of 250, when it comes down to take smart, real life decisions… that’s definitely
“Yeah, Sancus said the same thing.” he heard Steve distinctively smiling as pronouncing that weird name, and that brought a smile on his own lips. “Take care, Shellhead.”
“My creations sometimes outsmart me, I figure…” he stops abruptly, realizing that they actually have no time for their usual banters, because although he’s quite confident in his abilities, he doesn’t want to tempt the odds more than absolutely necessary. “I feel… disgusted with myself, St—
It’s now Tony’s turn to not know what to say, stunned by these words, because as a kid Captain America was the role model that had always been presented to him like the only valid one by his father, and, although that comparison mostly turned out to be oppressive and unfair in its own way, he was never able to forget that the few times the both of them had managed to connect, it had been because of the Star-Spangled Super Soldier. So for Steve to actually say that
He shakes his head as to keep these ideas out of his mind but it’s impossible, because he’s given this much more thought than he’d like to admit.
would be to go so openly against a ruling from the Supreme Court, no matter what the circumstances. There’s a tiresome back and forth for a while in which he takes no part whatsoever, believing that his best strategy is to actually give off the idea he couldn’t care less about the whole issue, before the man in charge eventually has enough with being so defiantly challenged and claims that it’s going to get done, no matter what.
“Hey, you still interested in dating?” he asks, and the sudden question catches Steve so unprepared that he gets stuck midair in a jump, ending up stumbling on the floor, and Tony chuckles as lending him a helping hand.
The replies shocks him even more, because he had started to think it might have been a recorded message of sorts. Apparently not.
again.” Tony stops to catch some breath, the words sinking in him just as in Pepper, because this is the very first time he’s admitting it to himself too. Hearing it makes it more real, somehow. “Do you… see what I mean?”
The unexpected lifeboat comes to him thanks to, ironically enough, his job; on a Monday morning in early March he finds a folder waiting for him on his desk containing a detailed itinerary of a short trip to Brussels, Belgium, in two weeks’ time.
“Because it can happen if what you’re saying resonates with the person in front of you or it’s fascinating...” he replies, feeling like he’s actually having a chat with a ten-year old kid instead. Which is probably what Steve is, coming to think about it, when you consider the time during which he was a teenager and how the Second World War practically took away that from him and many others of his generation. In comparison, his despised years at boarding school look like a walk in the park
. It wouldn’t be Iron Man or the Director of SHIELD going back on his steps; it would be Tony Stark asking Steve Rogers for a second chance, a do-over, a chance of redemption for all the mistakes he’s made regarding
one – or even just to change it up a little, but he had always refused, albeit he knew for a fact that wasn’t such a wise decision. But when a room is all you have left to try and fill the ever-growing void inside of you, how can you just give it up, listen to your brain talking and not your heart? Twelve months later, and he still doesn’t have an answer to this question, nor does he think he ever will. So not only he’s stayed in the same room, he hasn’t even touched anything
. This can’t be, can it? Since Steve has accepted to get back on the team, Tony and he have talked, sure, kissed, even had sex, but it has never felt like
Much to his own surprise, his first thought the morning after is about the trees. How are they? Did he do a good enough job? Jarvis mentioned something about a fertilizer or a similar growth help, which he would like to get. He researches local gardening centres whilst having breakfast, but there is one just across the river in New Jersey that has decidedly better reviews, so he decides it’s worth a visit, especially since he doesn’t really have anything else on his plate. Without realising it, he ends up spending the biggest part of the day there, looking at plants and trees, chatting with fellow gardening aficionados and asking all sorts of questions to the experts.
Waiting for the others to arrive, he begins surveying the scene, looking for any clues about the location of this ‘ring’ they’re after (maybe unsurprisingly, Fury didn’t provide them with any visual reference of what the object might look like). However, the cave looks barren, and once again Steve wonders about the Namor guy who tipped them off (he doesn’t know him, of course, but the rest of the group isn’t particularly fond of him, which is reason enough for Steve to be skeptical).
, he’d remark later to himself. “I’ll leave them here, remind me to get them when we’re back, okay?” he then says, going around the front desk and placing them on the counter, putting in a note in the A.I. system as a second memo. The evening has just begun and he’s already feeling all of his good purposes fading away.
The next couple of weeks see a nice, slow pace quietly setting down, and maybe for the first time in his whole life Tony experiences something resembling
He hasn’t pronounced these words out loud, but Steve twitches involuntarily in his sleep as if he has just heard them all the same, and Tony gets so freaked out that he jumps on his feet, his eyes wide with stupor and uneasiness. The team always used to tease them, saying that they were so in love they could communicate with just a glance, and maybe that was somewhat correct at one point but this? This is another set of cards entirely, because Steve is asleep, has no way of knowing Tony is there, except… except maybe he does, on some mysterious, unconscious level that he doesn’t quite understand. He should go, and yet all he does is getting closer once more, this time actually lying next to him, not daring an actual touch – he’s sure that would wake him up – but breathing in his essence, salty and a bit sour with a hint of blood, which causes a single tear to escape his control, too late to stop it as it lands on the mattress, an imperceptible sign of his brief presence in the room.
“Why are you so edgy?” Tony chuckles, patting his cheek as an encouraging gesture, or at least that’s what he tells himself, because he has no idea what just prompted him to do that. It doesn’t make any
Tony sighs again, although this time refrains from voicing his frustration out loud: “As in, on a scale from ten to zero. You see, before a first date, you start at the lowest grade, and by the end of it, your aim is to get as closer to ten as you can. I normally score... 9 on average.” He can’t help himself from sharing, he doesn’t even know why, exactly. It’s not like they’re having a competition - hell, the way things are they wouldn’t even be in the same
Ten minutes – and another till – later, Mr. Field collects the bag for the last time and swiftly passes it over his arms to wear it as if it was a weird rucksack before turning to face his accomplish – and the door. Feeling it’s safe for him to do so, Tony follows his movements, and surely enough he finally gets a visual on the man he
into it, he can feel his fascination growing more and more each time that he closes his eyes to rest. In the period that follows he visits so many planets, some really similar to Earth, others that only have in common with it the fact of being populated; as it turns out, the ‘right’ way of looking at the universe – or at our galaxy, to say the least – isn’t by picturing it as an enormous version of our own planet, but rather as the biggest theme park you’ll ever visit – matter of fact, a couple of them seem to
“Cut it out, Rogers, you’re killing me,” he protests, but it’s a farce because he’s actually very much relishing this, and has to remind himself that this is
“I can, and I’m doing it. If you don’t like it, you can take it up to my superior. He’s the President of the United States.” he replies tersely, and ignoring the expression of disbelief on the other man’s face, he opens the door and gets inside the room, closing the door behind himself and locking it.
, not for now at least, and that makes him realize for the first time just how much he misses the old days and the old team, people he considered close friends and sometimes even family, even before Steve and he started to hook up. Will they ever be like that again? Tony doesn’t know, although he surely
Eyes fixed on the time projection on the ceiling, he’s been watching minutes slowly going from 00 to 59, only to start back again, for the last five hours that he’s spent in bed, trying to get some sleep – although after the first sixty minutes went by, he knew that it was never going to arrive, not tonight anyway. He had briefly toyed with the idea of hitting the gym around 3am, just to do something and maybe get rid of the restlessness that has been crippling him all day, but eventually decided against it, because didn’t want to risk anyone spotting him in there, awake, punching bags, imagining they were
“I can relate to that…” Tony nods, finishing his shawarma and throwing the paper into the bin a couple of feet away, scoring a basket. “Listen, uh… I don’t really know how to start this topic, so I’m just gonna come out and say it, okay? When I was… up there, I realized I
Steve blinks, forcing himself to focus back on his present situation. Group? He assumed it was a one-to-one thing (like a job interview), but apparently not. Apparently this – whatever it actually is – belongs to a bigger scenario. He doesn’t know whether he finds the new development comforting or not.
be. He could probably put it off for a couple of days if he wanted to – he’s positive she would understand – and if he still was the same man who took off a year ago he probably would, but the truth is, he’s not; space has changed him, he likes to think for the better. This time he doesn’t need to ask FRIDAY for a location, as Pepper has been keeping sending him regular emails providing updates on the Stark Industries: new projects, their stock market value, what the Roxxon has been up to and so on. In one of her last emails she even asked his opinion about moving the headquarters to New York: she didn’t quite go into details about the reasoning behind the move, and Tony didn’t ask, because to be perfectly blunt, he just didn’t care; after all, in case of emergency, he could get anywhere in just a couple of hours thanks to his suits.
, although that’s just a lie because you’re not a god, you’re not even a doctor, you can’t stop death when it’s already in front of you. And at that point, what happens?
for a myriad of reasons – there’s bound to be cameras pointed at the cell, not to mention guards and other potential eyewitnesses – he finds himself slipping a hand across the bars to grab the hem of Tony’s shirt, using it to pull him even closer, pressing his lips against the other’s for just a fraction of a second before letting them go. But it’s enough for Tony’s breath to reach his nostrils, the mix of pine and eucalyptus – his signature perfume in wintertime – sending a pleasant shiver down his spine.
Tony nods and after throwing a quick glance to Steve just to check if he’s actually breathing he approaches Stephen, who has now conjured up some papers from god knows where. Magic is not Tony’s forte.
Before Thanos’ acolytes reached New York, he had often envisioned this infamous conversation in his mind, but for the most part it had always been a shouting match between the two of them until one – usually himself – would push the other against the wall and that’d be the end of that talk. With everything that had taken place in those two years – last but not least Steve admitting that he
, and whether the damage inflicted can indeed be restored; on the (few) positive days, he thinks so, but more often than not, he has to admit that maybe this is just a necessary step in the humanity’s quest for redemption. On a particularly grim day, after having sat in a meeting where the ‘containment areas’ were eventually funded, feeling so worthless and defied, he leaves a new message on the web: “Gonna be in Malta for NATO meeting next week. Be there.”
Tony was not expecting such a fierce defense from someone who’s basically a total stranger. He blinks away his surprise, and gives the other a small smile that Steve intercepts. Meanwhile, the private has opened yet another door, to reveal yet another room, although calling it a giant locker would be more appropriate. In there, in all its splendor, is his suit, hung up on metal hooks. His heart takes a dip as finally recognizing something
“It’s fine, really, don’t…” he blandly protests, but before he can finish his sentence Steve’s coat is already around his shoulders, and he’s offering Tony his bent arm.
“Yeah, as if I needed a—“ he starts, reaching for the bed, but he stops halfway when he’s hit by a sudden thought: “… oh.
“What do you know?” asks Fury, sitting behind the desk in what he assumes is his house but can’t say for certain, as pretty much
“Here you are…” it groans, its voice hollow and squawky, definitely not human. They immediately stand next each other, getting into their default attack position from whenever they’re in the battlefield, but before anything else can happen the being claps its… – hands? Claws? They can’t make it out exactly – and the moment after they find themselves transported in a completely different surrounding.
. They had made love that night – it’d been slow and silent and sweet, one’s eyes fixed in the other’s at every second, impossible to look away, and for some reason it had felt like the first, except their real first had been all the opposite, rough and hungry because it had come after months of mutual pining, the two idiots they were refusing to believe what everyone else had already picked up on. In the aftermath of their love he had taken Tony into his arms, held him tight against his body sticky with sweat and the other’s sperm, kissed him softly, for a long time, and Tony instantly knew what that meant but didn’t have the guts to say it out loud, so just snuggled against him and closed his eyes, feeling calm and scared all at once. “I love you,” he had whispered at one point, just when he was about to fall asleep, and, although he’d thought he was already out, Tony had said it back without letting a second go by, those three simple words making his heart skipping a few beats not because it was the first time or unusual, but because they felt eternal right in that moment.
“I thought you had done your research, Stark. Our new ‘president’ did. He doesn’t like folks like me in a position of power, whatever that might be. So before he could sack me, I resigned. That way, I got to maintain my dignity.”
For some reason he doesn’t quite understand, it’s weird hearing his name being called out like this, in the open, as if it was a profanity, something that shouldn’t be said so
What happens next is so convulsed that Tony completely forgets to breathe, acting all on instinct whilst hoping for the best. Taking advantage of the moment of uncertainty, he launches himself towards Mr. Field in order to secure his gun, figuring neutralizing half of the duo is without a doubt a good start. Unfortunately for him, Tom catches his movement right as he does it, and without thinking about it twice he takes aim and shoots his own gun. In the cacophony of screams and panic that follows, Tony feels a sudden heat followed by a burning sensation coming straight from his right hip, so piercing in fact that for a good two seconds he believes he’s been set on fire somehow. But before he can even lower his eyes to spot what’s actually happened, his legs give way and he finds himself falling very ungraciously on the floor, hitting the white surface so hard that he yells out in double pain. As everything starts spinning around him, he hears that voice – Steve’s – calling his name again, but before he can get his sight to focus on him, more screams quickly follow, because this time Steve doesn’t hold back. Tony sees him charging against Tom, and something about the way he does it is mildly terrifying, because it looks like he has no real control over his body.
“—dream,” Tony concludes in his place, slowly coming to a sitting position, hugging his knees to his chest and blinking in disbelief. “Me too. Did yours involve the mind gem?”
Steve smiles again, and this time he doesn’t bother hiding it, because the other deserves to see it, deserves to know how much he means to him, no matter what the two of them have gone through – that’s just something that comes with the job. “Thank you,” he nods, meeting his glance, and although he really
a proper date, and to follow his usual plan, but before he can make his first move, his rational side takes over, shortcutting his brain and making him go on talking instead: “I would consider this a successful date, Steve, yes,” he hears himself replying, and god, how much he hates the sound of his own voice right now.
because he knows that’s what Steve needs right now. But he can’t, no matter how much his brain is screaming at him, it’s his heart the one in control at the moment. All he manages is sobbing out loud, turning away as hearing his own grotesque wails, muttering a “For fuck’s sake” under his breath, embarrassed and guilty and ashamed. He stands up and rubs his eyes, swallowing hard, trying to stop. He hates himself.
Now what’s left to establish is the great mystery that is Tony. Sure, being out for four days explains his worry, and maybe he’s also feeling guilty for not having realised straightaway that Steve had been hit - although, really, he shouldn’t - but that doesn’t quite cut it. He feels the answer is right there, yet for some reason, he just can’t pin it down.
There’s a soft general chuckle in the office between the other employees, and Miss Goodwin winks at him as if they were sharing a secret – Tony is totally sure that she’s had a crush on him since he first walked in for his interview, fourteen months ago – but other than that, nobody tells him off or seems to take notice of his one-minute delay or the fact that he’s clearly been sprinting all the way down here. That’s one of the reasons why he likes working here, despite the inherent element of danger that a job like this carries along: he gets to be around nice people, have a stable schedule which allows him to work on his side project as well, and the pay is good. Of course, this is not what he wants to do with his life, but hey, when you’re 29 in this century you can’t afford to be just a dreamer, you need cash too in order to survive.
things are around here,” the latest addition explains in an accent Steve as never heard before as he closes the door – this time painfully slowly – before letting himself on the only remaining free chair. He has long, Goldilocks hair that makes him look like a god from Ancient Greece. “Miss Janet, Hank, Bruce, Nick. It’s good to see you all again, my friends. Blonde stranger whose name I do not know, I am Thor Odinson, pleased to make your acquaintance.”
Tony nods, looking at Steve for just a couple of seconds before folding his glasses and slipping them back into the pocket of his jacket. He then fishes his phone out, checks the time, sends a few messages, all actions he doesn’t
“You… You told him?” Steve mumbles, still trying to process this new piece of information that has just been added to the pile.
Standing near the landing pad, his arms crossed over his chest and his eyes scanning the clear sky above for the awaited helicopter, Tony can’t help but having flashbacks of the last time he was in this same position, almost a year ago, although everything else couldn’t be more different now. He’s nervous of course, his fingers relentlessly tapping against his skin, but it’s because he still has the very annoying thought at the back of his mind that Steve got hurt during that ‘secret’ mission of his, and no matter how hard he’s tried to get rid of it, to tell himself that there’s no need to worry for nothing, it’s been keeping emerging almost every night for the past six weeks as soon as he closes his eyes. T’Challa had called a while back after having delivered his message to Steve, and had done his best to reassure him that the other man was indeed as healthy as ever, but for some reason he just couldn’t bring himself to
He dragged a blanket behind him as he entered. Tony jumped onto the bed and began to fluff the pillows. He didn't say anything more. Steve watched as Tony huddled beneath a blanket and sank back into the pillows that Steve couldn't stand. The silence between them was long and awkward.
They stepped out of the cab in front of a small movie theatre. Steve followed Tony through the front doors, past the box office, and through a second door with a sign that read, “Enter At Own Risk.” Steve frowned.
Steve rolled his eyes. The number of people with his phone number had doubled over the previous 36 hours. Once he opened the front door, though, he could tell that the supposed “perks” of dating Tony Stark weren’t so much perks as “ridiculous opulence.”
“He’s …” Sam tilted his head. “Hot, in a broken, Midwestern, loner in high school who joined the military and saw too much shit kind of way.”
"You were presented with an opportunity to make your first true connection to someone outside of the military. Not only that, but this connection was guaranteed to last a full year, and perhaps even beyond. Is it really a surprise you jumped at the chance?"
Steve groaned when his phone rang at 3:15. His fingers grasped for it, and he dropped the phone on the floor in the process of disconnecting it. He muttered a string of expletives into the pillow before tossing his legs over the side of the bed. He picked the cell phone off the floor and didn't bother looking at the name on the screen.
His phone buzzed with an alarm labeled, "GET ASS MOVING." Steve grabbed his wallet then burst out his door and down the stairs before he could give this shitshow any more thought. He walked to the Nostrand station and caught the A train down to Fulton where he transferred before popping out fifteen minutes later at Grand Central.
He couldn’t help how his heart melted the moment he heard her voice. She looked amazing, with her hair pulled back in a ponytail and the collar of her turtleneck pulled up to her chin. She looked
Pepper Potts smiled and said, "Just a feeling." She directed him to Tony's bedroom, "Front of the hall on the left."
Steve should not have been surprised to see photographers when the limo pulled to a stop outside Stark Tower. He let his shoulders slump for a moment as he realized he had a full year of this to look forward to. Steve quickly shook it off and asked Happy,
"My superiors claimed I was a suicide risk. That was the official assessment in November of last year, and they all knew it was bullshit. I wasn't suicidal, I was reckless.
, that could never be answered. Steve would rather have answers than questions. Tony could touch Steve the way he wanted to be touched. The truth was that Steve had found a worthwhile fight and a great partner.
He laughed, realizing he left his burger and fries untouched at the diner. Tony Stark was a walking distraction. A much welcome distraction. Steve grabbed a yogurt shake-type thing from the fridge and downed it without thought. After wiping the remnants from the corner of his mouth, he shrugged off his jacket and hung it in the closet. He glimpsed the edge of a grey denim sleeve but ignored the temptation to pull it out.
Steve jumped a bit as the robotic English voice sounded throughout the room. He doubted he would get used to that.
"She knows." Steve took a deep breath and figured Tony might as well know now instead of finding out later. "Last week when she invited me into the office, Miss Potts didn't say it, but she had the look people get when they know."
“How are things with Steve?! They ask. How long will your relationship last?! Like I know. I’m an inventor not a fucking psychic! If I was psychic I wouldn’t have been captured by terrorists and have a giant magnet keeping shrapnel out of my heart. They kept asking me all these questions until I figured it out. They think you’re too good for me. And you
They went downstairs and entered a dimly-lit room with the limited light trained on a small stage toward the front. There must have been a few dozen people crowded together in cushioned chairs, milling about or watching to see who would take the stage next. For what? Steve wasn’t sure. Sensing his confusion, Tony explained,
The voice came out of nowhere. Steve jumped the slightest bit before they both looked over at the bar to see a beautiful woman pouring herself a glass. Tony raised his eyebrows and offered,
Steve took them out to a restaurant Happy recommended. He said it was one of Tony’s favorites because they always sat him at a table near the back where no one noticed. They did the same for Steve without being asked. The moment he sat down, it was as if his problems evaporated. Sam was there. Nat was there. With the two of them, everything seemed solvable. They hadn’t been together as a group in over a year. Steve grabbed the business card from the table and crumpled it up into a tiny clump.
“My preferred schedule would mean I don’t move from this couch. Unfortunately, I have a thing this morning. A meeting thing that I cannot sleep through, but I’m exhausted.”
“Tape measure, obviously. Duct tape because sometimes the easiest solution is the simplest. Flashlight.” Tony clicked it on once, then clicked it off. “It’s more difficult to fix things if you can’t see them. Tiny pliers. Small pliers. Medium pliers. Large pliers.”
Dr. Madani smiled softly then asked each of them to establish a goal for the week. Some were smaller goals. Commander Hill wanted to take her son out to a restaurant and not be suspicious of everyone within thirty feet of their table. Ross was finally ready to get back on a plane. Not fly one, he insisted, but to sit on a commercial flight.
“Of course I like him! What’s not to like? He’s smart, he can keep up with Peggy in a way most people can’t, and he lost his leg to an IED in Afghanistan. Sousa is the sort of man you want your best friend to end up with. Honest, trustworthy, looks at Peggy like she hung the stars in the night sky. He is great for her.”
Their waitress dropped off the rootbeer, but neither Steve nor Tony bothered to break the silence. Instead, Tony stood up and walked around the table to sit next to Steve. Their arms touched and it brought Steve out of whatever dark place he'd been heading to. He kept his spine rigid and shoulders tense as he spoke.
Tony rolled his eyes and insisted, “He would’ve loved you, too. And hated me for corrupting you. When I brought my first boyfriend home, my dad threatened to have an ‘EXIT ONLY’ sign tattooed on my lower back.”
No groaning pipes. No crushing ice cubes or doors opening down the hall at three. He'd slept in for the first time in God only knew how long. Steve pushed the covers down with his feet, groaning as he pulled himself into a sitting position. He began his morning stretch routine: head tilt right, head tilt left, try not to wince at the neck pop. Shoulders back, spine cracks—
"Roger Stephens," Tony said as he picked apart some crust, "clever. You only have three friends, though. No status updates, no one posting to your wall, and no photos."
"Nothing much. Ten Rings held you captive somewhere in the Hindu Kush. You were there about three months and made a weapon to escape. Anything else you want me to know?"
"I would like that," Steve admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. "But you have to give me time. I can't throw myself into something like this. I am terrified of loving someone again. Losing Bucky cost me so much, I don't know if I have it in me to give you what's left."
Tony asked, "How would you want me to do it? Hot air balloon ride, or fly you to Paris and drop to a knee in front of the Eiffel Tower?"
"Who is this Rhodey person I keep hearing about? I've met Miss Potts and Mr. Hogan, but not Rhodey."
Steve tossed his legs over the side of the bed and felt more alive than he had the day before. His morning routine was the same, but it felt different. Instead of going through the motions, Steve was
“My advice, which you didn’t ask for, is to prepare for him to scare you.” Pepper shook her head and tossed the StarkPad haphazardly onto the desk. “Physically, emotionally, mentally … One day, you will be with him and he could just drop unconscious. You think to yourself, is he dead? Did he go too long in the workshop without sleeping? Am I on a very elaborate version of Punk’d? Is it somehow all three of those things at once?”
