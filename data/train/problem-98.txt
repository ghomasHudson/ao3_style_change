“Thank you,” John muttered. It felt like the wind had been knocked out of him, all of a sudden.
“Hm? Oh, it was great,” John replied. “Really great. How’ve you been?”
John stepped back, and the speakers began blaring.
“I know.” Sherlock said, and his brow smoothed out a little. He brought one of John’s hands up to his lips, kissed the back of it gently.
There was no room for negotiation in Mycroft’s voice.
“Uh, yeah, well,” he stammered. “That – that
wasn’t about to relax. He needed something to do, something to keep him occupied while he was stuck here being useless. “Coffee!” he almost shouted. “Does anyone else need coffee?”
“Certainly. In fact,” Sherlock checked his watch. 11:30 pm. Still 7:30 in Britain, although, there would be
He angled his face to pull him in even deeper, and the kiss was almost overwhelming in its intensity but John didn’t care, because he could feel Sherlock’s heartbeat across his own skin and breathe every breath from his lungs, because he could feel the depths of love and devotion and vulnerability in every press of his lips, because Sherlock was holding him and protecting him and
man, who wanted him so much that it may as well have been written on his face – and then he glanced around one last time, just to be safe, before covertly reaching forward and squeezing John’s fingers between his own.
He couldn’t stand hearing about how valiantly he was serving his country, when he couldn’t even stop what had gone on in his own home, right under his nose. How could he make it better, even with what he’d said at the press conference, when there was no way to undo what Magnussen had done?
“Make sure you –”
“You know, Sherlock…” Dad was speaking slowly, stretching his legs out lengthwise on the sofa. “I’m sure he’s unique and extraordinary…”
He stared down at the miles of parked cars and streetlamps. Every house looked identical.
“Pathetic,” he murmured.
But then, he
“I love you,” Sherlock murmured back. “You’re alright now, John. I’m here.”
“Do you love him?”
“They say he’s an English duke!”
John blinked lazily, moving back into his touch. "Wouldn't say no to a cuppa."
“Yeah, thanks, love.” John did manage a small smile this time as he pushed it towards Sherlock. Sherlock got up, leaned forward to kiss the crown of John’s head, then grabbed both their empty mugs and swept from the office.
“Yes, come on, quick as you like.” He stooped to pick up his book again, and used it to give John a playful swat on the arse.
It was just a for moment, though, before Sherlock sighed, and stood up.
” Sherlock’s reply was cut off by John nipping at the hinge of his jaw, sweet pain fuelling his desire and making him grip John even tighter.
“What?” she demanded.
, and he still craved more, still wanted more of that touch that was taking him apart so completely.
And he was. Sherlock really was.
Sherlock sighed softly; his hand came forward to cup John’s jaw, his thumb stroking tenderly over his cheek.
They held each other that way, Sherlock wasn’t sure how long, sealing that promise with a hard, desperate kiss. John’s hands smoothed up and down Sherlock’s back, his eyelashes fluttering against Sherlock’s face, his lips nipping sweetly at Sherlock’s mouth, and his adoration was so powerful that Sherlock thought his heart might crack under the weight of it.
“Have you been reading anything?” John asked her, tentatively.
He’d really thought, for one amazing, wild moment, that John was singing to him – that somehow, against all the odds, John had secretly been carrying a torch for him too, and he was going to use this song as his chance to finally tell him –
The man looked between them suspiciously, but eventually retreated back to the hallway doors, though John noticed he kept a sharper focus in Harry’s direction now.
“Excellent,” Sherlock said, too quietly. He cleared his throat. “Thank you.”
“And the alarms?”
Sherlock pulled off the motorway and into the town, following the signs that indicated the way to the guesthouse. There was almost no activity on the street, and all the businesses seemed to be closed already.
Everything about this case was grating on his nerves as it was, even without Mycroft breathing down his neck about every little thing. Sherlock knew his brother was just as unhappy as he was that he’d needed to call him in for such a dangerous and inconvenient situation, but even that wasn’t enough to alleviate his frustration. Mycroft’s irritation only amplified Sherlock’s, and gave him a rather unreceptive target to lash out at. Sherlock would not soon forgive his brother for dragging him into such a mess, and in
He wasn’t laughing it off, like Sherlock had expected. “For what?”
John let out a quiet exhale of laughter; Sherlock felt his smile against his hair.
“Aren’t…” she seemed to be screwing up her eyes to try to see him better. “Aren’t you the Prime Minister?”
Sherlock sighed, uncrossing his arms from his chest.
Sherlock gave a soft groan. “Really?” His arm automatically slid around John’s waist. “Twin bed?” He asked the woman.
John mulled this over the next day, as he tapped slowly at his typewriter. Surely, if he went and found a book in town, he could try to learn some Portuguese? At least passable enough to communicate vaguely, for the time he had left there? But then, some nagging doubt at the back of his mind told him that that was exactly what Sherlock didn’t want. That the only reason he spoke to John at all was because it was nice to have someone listen without understanding. That Sherlock didn’t want John to know anything about him, and didn’t care to know anything about John, either. And that would make sense, too, wouldn’t it? After all, John was just the man he was cleaning up after. Why should Sherlock feel anything for him, one way or another?
“You have,” John whispered, desperately. “You do. Oh Sherlock, you always do.” John tugged lightly at the base of Sherlock’s skull, and Sherlock obediently came back up to capture his lips again, kissing him with a hard desperation that held all of his built up doubts, all his fears that he’d been carrying alone; John took them all, drew them out, and they shouldered the weight together so that Sherlock could let them go.
He didn’t have anything to change into, so John crawled under the sheets in just his pants and shuffled up as close to the wall as he could. There wasn’t much space left, but it would have to do. The two of them were used to sleeping cuddled close together, in any case.
“Come on, they’re expecting us at seven,” John said – his tone was trying to be urgent, but his face gave away how dreadfully unexcited he was.
He fumbled a bit with the champagne glass he was still clutching at awkwardly, but in a second Sarah’s husband had snatched it away and was indicating that he should go
The only sound was the faint
A soft, deliberate footstep sounded on the other side of the door. Sherlock cocked his gun and raised it higher, and John spun away from the window and did the same.
“You’re Sam’s dad, aren’t you?” the man asked.
“Um.” Sherlock began, then stopped. He looked at John, then cast his eyes downward and bent down awkwardly to set the champagne on the coffee table. “It was…about Christmas.”
“Boa noite,” he said, trying to keep his voice from shaking. “Senhor Holmes?”
“No,” John breathed, shaking his head. Sherlock could feel it across his skin, through his entire body.
John gaped, his breath coming shallow as his fear ebbed away and left a blank expanse of despair in its wake.
To his own surprise, Sherlock found himself huffing out a laugh, though there was hardly more than a breath behind it.
He took her by the arm and walked with her towards the dance floor. Molly looked absolutely delighted, and John scowled after her. He did notice, though, that Sherlock kept a respectful distance between them even as she tried to edge closer and closer, and it lifted his spirits somewhat.
He didn’t look angry or upset, but there was something knowing in his expression all the same. John’s stomach flipped at the sight of it. Sam had always been perceptive, understanding the things John didn’t say as much as the things he did.
to break the quiet, but how could he, when he didn’t know a word Sherlock could understand?
John shook his head. “No, it’s fine. It’s fine. Well, I mean, it’s not really
And now shame was coursing through Sherlock where the guilt had just seconds ago washed away, remembering how he
“That’s his name?”
“Couple more,” said Harry’s voice behind him. She stepped into the kitchen and laid a stack of dirty plates next to the sink. “Listen, Sherlock, you really don’t have to, I can –”
have an awful feeling I was going to fuck up on the first day.”
John waited. He knew Sherlock had heard him, but whether he had anything to say himself was another matter. Maybe John would have to wait until later.
understand. Obviously.
Dad’s eyes widened in surprise. Clearly this had been the last thing he’d expected to hear.
from stress, remember?”
“But, general wisdom is that, in the end, there’s not just one person for each of us, son.”
“How do you feel?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock’s arms were shaking lightly from holding himself up, his breath coming in quicker with every kiss, and John could feel the mounting tension in his body as powerfully as he could feel it in his own. He felt himself rocking back into Sherlock’s movements with more force now, pulling lower and deeper moans out of Sherlock’s throat. They were close, John could feel it, and his desire to stay in this perfect space forever was quickly shattered by another hot spike of pleasure as Sherlock began to thrust deeper, deeper, and John gasped softly as he made to reach for his cock lying trapped between them and felt Sherlock’s hand covering his, stopping him.
“Sherlock…
“Sixteen days.” Sherlock’s hands roamed sweetly up John’s back, one settling in the space between his shoulder blades, the other wrapping around his torso and clutching his side.
John gave a contented sigh – he couldn’t move much, but it felt nice. Sherlock’s length slid slowly up and down, then faster, as his hips started to piston forward more erratically and he lost himself to the feeling.
“Better?” John asked. Sherlock could hear the sleep creeping back into his voice. The soothing patterns against Sherlock’s back didn’t stop, though.
John spun around, and found himself face-to-face with Sherlock. His stomach gave a powerful lurch, and all the blood seemed to drain out of him.
They’d hit him over the head, one of his men, the burly one, and Sherlock only just had time to see him fall before he was wrenched back to Moriarty, hadn’t seen what they’d done with him –
Sherlock gave another shallow little nod. Then, hesitantly, he leaned in and kissed John on the cheek.
John let it flow into him, let it envelop him, pushing away all of his pain and leaving warmth in its wake. When he broke it off, it was only to push himself back into Sherlock’s embrace, and he settled his head on his shoulder and let his arm tighten around him, strong and steadfast, comforting.
“These have just come through from the treasury,” John said, placing a bulging file on the corner of his desk. “And
For this story, I give you (finally) the plot from the film featuring Jamie (Colin Firth) and Aurelia (Lucia Moniz).
“Did you finish those projects you were talking about?” John asked, maybe a bit too jerkily.
He heard Sherlock’s quiet laughter again –
across the strings, leading them in as the drums and bass struck up their galloping tempo.
He opened his eyes, saw a blinding light shining in his face. He broke off from John reluctantly, and stared outward – at the entire auditorium, staring back at him.
She stepped past him, back towards the door, and John knew that the conversation was over.
“Alright,” she said, finally.
The woman shook her head. “No.”
John felt a regretful twinge in his chest. He wished he could laugh along with him.
“I’ve bought a ticket to the States!” It practically exploded out of him, lighting up his face with enthusiasm. “I’m off in three weeks.”
“Let’s go!” Dad said, getting back to his feet.
Sherlock caught his breath, still giggling. Dad reached out for the remote and paused the film.
“No,” he said, finally, his tone incredibly weak. “Send for George, then.”
“I don’t care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree. I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know…”
Sherlock stood, face reigned into a cool, polite smile. Only a small crease between his brows betrayed any hint of emotion.
“Thank you.”
“Sherlock?” he said.
Sherlock scrambled in awkwardly, dropping the towel and trying to pull the sheets over himself without stealing them all from John. John rolled on his side so Sherlock could slot into him, and wrapped his arms around him to pull him closer.
Sherlock waited, John guessed to see whether he would say something else stupid, then turned back to face the front again.
“You’re cute when you’re sucking my cock,” he snickered.
It was warm outside, for Christmas Eve, and the light snow that had begun to fall before the show had mellowed into a mist. Beads of it flecked onto the widows, fogged up with the heat of the school building and muting all the bodies going past outside.
There were a few people in the lounge tonight – families in groups of armchairs, benches, exchanging gifts and tentative laughter. The space had been strung up with lights, and it looked at little less lifeless than it had done the last time.
There was a childlike brilliance in his expression, and it tugged at Sherlock’s chest. It always did.
Sherlock picked up his pace a little, frotting harder against him and sending jolts of pleasure all the way up John’s body. John felt heat building under his skin, waves of heat licking up his torso, down his legs, up his arms to the tips of his fingers.
“The essay,” John said, but he was starting to feel a chuckle bubbling up in his own throat too. “It was about his ‘Christmas wish’ or whatever. And I had to tell this mother, with a straight face, how concerned I was that her son had written about how his Christmas wish was to be able to see people’s farts.”
“No, really, it’s fine,” she said, giving him a tight-lipped smile. “I’m just feeling so rotten.”
He wanted to look at him. He so badly wanted to look at him. But he knew it would only make everything worse.
trembling. His whole body was trembling, actually. He wasn’t wearing a coat.
Sherlock, not
John grinned, his heart singing in his chest, and they fell back into the kiss. John let his hands trail down Sherlock’s back, and shifted his hips so that their cocks would rub up against each other. He groaned, a low sound from deep in his chest – he could feel Sherlock getting hard against him, and it was stoking the quickly-growing fire in his belly.
“Oof – yeah, I’m fine.” He was still trying to pull Sherlock closer with his free arm.
Sherlock paused, swallowing hard, then exhaled heavily, trying to expel out his anxieties as best he could.
“Has he noticed you yet?” Dad asked, a knowing glint in his eye.
The clock neared on five, and people left the office with well-wishes toward each other. John didn’t know why he stayed, even as the space became emptier and emptier. Lately he’d been leaving as soon as he could but…well. He supposed his dread of Christmas Eve with Harry was enough to keep him here. Even as the door slammed shut behind the final merry workers, and John was left alone, with the lone figure in the far office remaining behind.
Anger flared briefly up behind Sherlock’s eyes, but he quelled it and pushed it aside, clambering swiftly out of the cab. Aware suddenly of where they were – and of how many people were still milling about in the lobby despite the late hour – he took a few deep, steadying breaths as he watched the cab pull away. The case may be finished, but they still had to be careful.
“We’ll still do all the things we always do,” John went on, sort of breathless now, and speaking quickly. “It’s just…Mary will be there, sometimes.”
Sherlock gave a little nod, then turned and headed for the door. As soon as it closed behind him, John gave a great exhale and clenched his hand into a fist on top of his desk.
like it.
He could feel his face flush hot as the words left his mouth. He’d wanted to say them for a week, but they sounded so
John pulled him even closer, brushed his lips against the side of his neck.
John sighed, tapped out a few, slow words, then stopped. His eyes followed Sherlock as he moved to the next tree, his eyes blue today and shining with the cobalt sky.
“John, oh God,
They stayed there for a moment, enfolded in each other, savoring the feeling of their bodies so in tune with each other. John’s weight was heavy against Sherlock’s legs, his chest warm where it pressed up against Sherlock’s, his arms finding the optimal resting place to hold him as close as possible, and Sherlock marvelled at how seamlessly they could come back together, how perfectly they fit, how clearly they were always meant to be there.
The room exploded with cheers. Applause rang out, champagne glasses were raised and swiftly guzzled, everyone alight and punching the air. Sherlock joined them, raised both his fists, and stepped onto a nearby table to look over them all as the roadies howled and chanted.
“Hmm,” Sherlock said, as if he were really thinking on it. “How
He sat behind his desk, signing through a stack of something – he was barely seeing whatever it was, his mind still on the gentle softness of John’s smile, the way the little lines deepened around his cerulean eyes.
.” John dropped his hand and looked imploringly back up at Sherlock. “Sherlock, that necklace wasn’t for Mia.”
This really,
But John smiled, a bit sadly now, and huffed out another humorless laugh.
John stilled his movements, his eyes screwed shut. Above him, Sherlock’s lips slowed and pulled back, barely an inch. His breath was coming in full-body drags that pressed his chest into John’s.
He was trying to sound excited, but Sherlock didn’t buy it for a second. Both of them knew exactly why they were doing this, and Sherlock hated the way it heaped itself on John’s shoulders, almost physically weighing him down.
“You okay?”
Sherlock looked back down at him, humming in agreement.
no, I insist,” he barked out.
Sherlock leaned towards the camera, just a little. “Become a pop star, and they give you them for
“Hello, sorry to disturb, does John live here?”
“No, no, really, it wasn’t.” The man shook his head, those gorgeous lips quirking up a bit with a smile.
The track began to play.
He heard her sigh loudly on the other end, but after a few more reassurances, got her to admit defeat.
From where he was standing, wiping down the glass paneling in the French doors, Sherlock was bathed in golden sunlight, and he looked like an angel.
Harry sagged backwards again. “Don’t touch me, I’m
“Oh –
with himself not to lose it in front of his brother, but it was then that Mycroft did something that very nearly stunned Sherlock into composure; he reached out and laid a hand on his wrist.
“You are…” Sherlock’s words stuck in his back of his throat. He swallowed, started again. “You are
“Oh no,” Sherlock breathed out. No, no, this couldn’t be happening. After everything tonight, just after he’d finally decided, and now he’d just missed him and John was slipping away –
But then his mouth contorted somewhat, and he did speak, but it was so quiet that John couldn’t hear him at all.
“What?” Sherlock whispered.
“No, I put them off until tomorrow,” Sherlock reassured him. He stepped forward and cupped John’s jaw with a steady hand. “You need to rest now, I think.”
Sherlock burrowed as tightly as he could into John’s side and listened to his heart thumping against his ear – it soothed him a bit, but not as much as it usually did. Try though he might to relax, there was still that sensation from earlier holding him alert; that feeling that, when he fell asleep, he would be forced awake far too early.
There was an amused crease to his brow, but his eyes were deep with emotion. Not sadness, exactly, but – understanding. Patience.
Sherlock stared at him for a second, before a wave of comprehension washed over him.
He hit stop on the CD player. Perlman vanished.
He’d had this saved as a contingency, in case things didn’t go well. It was some fluff proposal for student grants funded by both governments, something they could easily find common ground on, and at the same time make for some decent PR.
Christmas was approaching fast, and the shoot would wrap soon, and John had made up his mind that he would have to ask Sherlock out before it did. He didn’t know if he’d say yes – Sherlock
His words were almost a plea, whispered roughly into Sherlock’s lips. It wasn’t just because of the wound that he needed it slow. He wanted to
John hummed in agreement, brushing away a crumb from the corner of his mouth. “Probably just codeine now. It won’t make me sick, and I don’t think I’ll need anything stronger anymore.”
“No, no clue.” John muttered back. “But, just go with it, do you reckon?”
26. “Thank you.”
“Oh, yeah, of course.” John looked from her to Sherlock. “Con – con grande pl-pleasura…”
“Vou sentir saudades,” he murmured.
“We’ll be back to serial killers by the time the week is out, at this rate,” John quipped.
Sherlock felt instantly worse. No, Dad
Even if he
He abandoned the couple at the table and moved toward the railing, looking down at the crowd on the first floor.
He pushed open the door to the flat, but was again greeted with empty space. No, no, this was all wrong. They were supposed to
. And Sherlock knew that, John knew he did. It was why he’d thrown himself into his caretaker role so faithfully – it was the natural thing to do, because he was always there for John, no matter how difficult things got, no matter how dire circumstances looked. Sherlock would always be there to help him, to support him through anything, as much because Sherlock needed it as John did. Because Sherlock needed him.
Sherlock repeated to himself, yet again.
They sat together a while longer. Janine said nothing as Sherlock started his recording again, didn’t even give the impression that she noticed. Relieved, he gave some subdued laughs to her further abuses of the DJ and various wedding guests, then, when he could tell she was getting bored, pointed her in the direction of a young man who’d be keen to dance with her.
“Shh, breathe, John.” Sherlock blinked warmly, his eyes full of tender concern.
“Hey, hey, I know.” John held Sherlock’s gaze, something other than pain now worrying his brow. He laced his fingers between Sherlock’s and held on tight. “It’s alright, love.”
. There must have been a full six inches of snow piled on top of it.
“No, not that.” John’s lips settled in a pained half-smile; his fingers did their best to squeeze Sherlock’s comfortingly. “But…just in case.”
“Because, I thought it would be something worse.” Dad said, with a subdued exuberant quality in his voice.
Sherlock leaned his elbows on the desk and pressed his forehead into his hands.
“What?” he asked.
He danced down the stairs, his hips gyrating ludicrously as he went. He didn’t care.
Sherlock looked out toward the water for a moment, made up his mind, then looked back.
A few quiet bites later, and John finally put down his fork with something that sounded like a sigh.
“Thank God,” he rasped out. He raised his shaking hand to wipe at his eyes. “Oh, thank God.”
Sherlock blinked two, three times, a crinkle of confusion appearing at the bridge of his nose. “Yes, I know.” His eyes bored deeply into John’s “Are you alright? Did something–?”
“Um,” John stammered, drawing back. She looked a bit startled, but her eyes were quick to narrow again, seductively.
He gave a half-hearted little laugh, and, to his immense relief, Sherlock’s face relaxed into the smallest of smiles. He looked weary beyond belief, and it send a sharp spike through John’s chest, but it was still a smile. Still Sherlock.
Sherlock swallowed. A hot flush of shame was flooding up into his face, probably colouring his cheeks.
Sherlock was smiling tenderly back at him, and John’s heart leapt back to life. His skin was itching with need again, desperate for contact – but it was different this time. More profound. More absolute.
Sherlock gave John’s hand a gentle squeeze, and they walked in together.
* * *
“Here we are, Harris Street,” he said, jovially. “What number, sir?”
“Of course you can,” Sherlock whispered back, gently.
he was behaving like a besotted schoolboy but he just couldn’t help it. He’d done it! He was going to go out with Sherlock Holmes!
He turned back out to where Dad was looking, at a little sailboat flitting between the barges and ferries.
“No, I mean –” Sherlock blinked heavily, trying to clear his head; nothing about this was making sense. “What are you doing here? There’s nothing you can do – you didn’t have to come.”
,” Sherlock mumbled. He was settling in properly now, his mind looping towards jokes in his weariness. “We can always rough it out here in the wilderness.”
But now, now his head spun and his vision contracted – all he could manage were the barest snippets, flickering like an old newsreel onto his unfocused eyes. John sitting in his chair, paper spread before him and hair damp from the shower. John at the sitting room table wearing that striped jumper, folding his hands and asking about their latest case. John draped over him on the sofa, warm and solid and trading jabs with Sherlock while some late night talk show played on the telly. John pressing a kiss to the top of Sherlock’s head as he sat at his microscope and whispering softly in his ear not to stay up too long. John pressed against his chest, arms around Sherlock’s back as they swayed together and hummed tunelessly to the crackling radio. John in Sherlock’s dressing gown. John hunched over the stove making dinner. John smiling up at Sherlock as he played the violin. John, John, John.
didn’t intend for it to happen like this. All the times he’d imagined it, it was always slow, deliberate. He’d thought they would take their time. He’d thought he’d be able to explore, to savour it. He’d never once thought it would be a frantic, desperate affair on the tail end of their strangest case yet, hundreds of miles from home.
“Sarah and I had a lot of time to prepare for this moment,” John said.
Sherlock dipped his head for another deep kiss that made John’s head feel light on the pillow – his fingers were rubbing a soothing pattern along John’s shoulder blades, his arms held taut as he carefully settled himself down onto John’s chest, then with one slow, unbroken movement, he delicately canted his hips forward.
Sherlock’s vision went white at the edges, the fury threatening to overtake him.
Lestrade’s efforts were hardly better than Molly’s. Sherlock breathed deeply, trying to relax his tensed muscles.
The driver stared for a second longer, then gave up and turned back around, starting the car again.
Come follow me on
When he realized what she had asked, he started so violently that he nearly dropped the camera.
He was wearing a black button-down, and had a white apron tied around his waist. His curls were tumbling errantly over his brow as he served the diners their meals.
“Mmm. Maybe.” Sherlock smiled and leaned into the kiss, lips opening warmly over John’s and pulling him firmly against himself. Sherlock’s tongue slipped tentatively past John’s lips, and they stood there for some time just exploring each other’s mouths, enjoying this small moment of peaceful solitude before they had to go out and face the world together.
Sherlock nodded; his other hand was cradling the back of John’s neck, brushing through the coarse fringe there, the touch as slow and as tender as the way his finger massaged lightly within John, coaxing him into soft little whimpers of pleasure.
“There, your turn,” he said.
John hummed appreciatively and sank into him; he closed his eyes for a moment and rested his head in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. He was so solid, yet so soft, surrounding him at all angles, and it was impossible for John to feel anything but perfectly whole when he was in this space.
“You weren’t awful,” Sherlock said weakly.
“…I’m off, actually.”
“So you’re actually going ahead with this genuinely stupid plan?”
In spite of himself, Sherlock’s eyebrows shot up in disbelief. John sighed.
John’s eyes clouded with confusion for a second, before he realized who Sherlock was talking about.
“You did it!” and the voice was unmistakeably John’s, and Sherlock found him again looking absolutely
She was silent on the other end, only the faint sound of her breathing coming through. John braced himself for the explosion.
“Sorry, just, you’ve been standing there for a while. Coffee’s probably getting cold.” The boy nodded towards the cups, apprehension clearly winning over the concern in his face.
Sherlock turned, and headed towards the kitchen. John stood still a moment, staring at the wall, then turned around for a final glance, but he was already out of sight.
Sherlock closed the door behind them and pulled off his coat. John looked around the room; it was fairly spacious, but mostly empty. The small bed was shoved up against the wall, and there was a mirror and a chest of drawers on the other side. The walls were stone – it was an old building – and they curved inward into two arched windows looking into a small, walled-off garden. Next to the bed, another wooden door led into a tiny bathroom.
If Mycroft saw Sherlock’s bewilderment, he didn’t acknowledge it, just quirked his lips up in the subtlest of smiles.
A shorter one this time, based on the character of Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his meeting with Carol (Claudia Schiffer).
Maybe Sam was still waiting by the theatre. John began to pick his way forward through clusters of parents gleefully meeting their children, shouting bright congratulations across the corridor. John politely excused himself past a pair of parents picking up their two laughing sons, and turned the corner to where the auditorium entrance was.
He heard Dad pull back, and groan again as he read the message scrawled on the sign tacked to the wood –
“Let me make myself perfectly clear,” Mycroft interrupted. “If the two of you are not in my office within twenty minutes, I will personally see to it that information is discovered on your background checks for Scotland Yard that will ensure neither of you will ever consult for them again. Is that understood?”
John’s painted-on charming smile faltered a little, and he wandered off. The place was packed – one of the largest weddings he’d ever done. This couple must be rich beyond belief. Either that or they’d skimped to hell on the food, which, looking down at the moldering piles of pâté on the tray he was carrying, didn’t seem all that unlikely.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped to the bag lying on the sofa, mouth open as if it had personally offended him.
“Well, here it is one more time,” said Mike, now fiddling with the dials on his setup. “The dark horse for this year’s Christmas number one,
feel good, though, as Sherlock wiped gently at his back, at the cleft of his arse, at the sticky sheets beneath his soft cock. Sherlock tossed the pillow away and climbed back into bed, and John managed to roll over onto his side and reach out for him.
Sherlock blinked. This, he
Sherlock nodded and stood up to move toward the door. There was some kind of tingling energy racing across the skin above his wrist.
“Right.” Sherlock shook his head, his cheeks flaming.
As it clicked shut, John clenched his teeth and screwed up his face.
“Come on, love, I’m going mental here.” John’s voice was hoarse with frustration. His hand clenched involuntarily at his side, and he prayed that Sherlock couldn’t see it. “It’s been weeks – I know you understand. It doesn’t even have to be a real case, just.” John sighed deeply, searching Sherlock’s unsure face. “Something to get us out of the flat?”
John shook his head, seeing his giggles reflected back on Sherlock’s joyous face. He couldn’t even feel the cold anymore.
He’d surged forward, hoping to edge John away from the shelf, but froze when he saw what John had in his hand as he straightened up.
They kissed deeply for a few moments more, desperately but unhurriedly. Savoring the feeling of the other so close, so warm and pliant in each other’s arms. Savoring the tightness of their throats and the fullness of their hearts, the feeling of coming back to the place where they were always meant to be, as easily and naturally as breathing. Of loving each other so completely that they simply didn’t know how else to be.
“I would never.”
“Years ago, I’d have said this was a terrible mistake.” The gap between them closed, Sherlock stopping less than a foot away from him. “But…”
John pulled back and looked up into Sherlock’s eyes, looking for that hesitation there too, crinkling his forehead a bit when he found none.
have a really bizarre meeting with a parent about her kid’s essay.”
John’s eyes scanned the card. Sherlock pulled away the next one.
John sighed again as he pulled him in deeper, deeper still. His fingers dipped under the collar of Sherlock’s shirt, dragged across pale, smooth skin, traced the sharp lines of his collarbones. They trailed down the fabric and began undoing the buttons, and Sherlock’s fingers quickly joined them to help. He made quick work of it, tossing the shirt to the side, then moved on to his trousers, pulling at the zip and efficiently shucking them off and throwing them in the same direction.
,” she said, playfully pushing him away. “Now go, or you will actually miss it!”
“Oh, God – say yes, Sherlock!” Mrs. Holmes’ voice piped up.
Sherlock smirked. “Really?”
Mycroft finished his examination of the splinter and flicked it off his finger, sighing deeply.
“Oh God, sorry!” he said in a rush.
A wry smile crept up onto John’s face. “MI6 probably isn’t too pleased with me.”
Sherlock appeared behind him, meeting his eyes in their reflection in the mirror. He was wearing one of his nicest suits, and had actually put on a tie for the occasion, and looked even more dashing than his usual near-impeccable figure. His reflection exchanged a smile with John’s and came up behind him, wrapping an arm around his middle and pulling him close, bending his head to plant a kiss on John’s neck.
I do.”
“Ambulance.” Sherlock struggled to keep himself from shouting as he pressed the scarf into John’s side. “My husband, he’s been stabbed – we’re in the alley behind 403 Presbury Street.”
They burst through the doors at international departures, Dad leading the way as they hurried through the crowd. Sherlock ran along behind him, craning his neck to try to catch any glimpse, even an inkling of where John might have gone.
“It’s
Sherlock looked back down at him; John’s eyes were dark, his lips parted slightly, and there was a pure visceral want in his expression that made Sherlock’s knees go weak.
It was both more profound and more unreal than John could have ever imagined. The feeling of Sherlock’s body on his was still everywhere – on his lips, his cheeks, his hands, against his chest, but it was tingling like a phantom sort of energy that was too warm and perfect to be believed. He needed more.
Mycroft’s effort to sound certain felt so inappropriate that this time Sherlock
“Oh my
“I’ve probably recorded over it,” he almost shouted. He went to seize the DVD, the player,
Sherlock pulled him back in, desperation returning to their kisses, hands tightly gripping whatever they could reach. Without breaking their contact Sherlock began to walk backward, leading John towards the bed with his entire body.
“It’s alright. It’s all taken care of.” Sherlock gave John’s hand a gentle squeeze, trying to stop this train of thought.
That fact – that simple, undeniable, tangible
“No,” he muttered, and he seemed to deflate a little as he said it.
He rolled his eyes. He’d never once said that in all his life in English. But he’d just said it in Portuguese, and just like the example voice, too, so he supposed that was a victory.
But John didn’t seem to be able to, either. He just looked at him for a few more moments, then, very quickly, reached down to squeeze Sherlock’s hand, then spun around, still beaming, and disappeared through the door again.
“Oh, no,” Dad muttered, setting off again, this time towards the entrance to security
And then they were kissing, fully and properly. John’s tongue pushed greedily past Sherlock’s lips as Sherlock’s hands bracketed John’s face, exhaling a long low sigh as he opened his mouth to invite John in. John’s hands had come up to seize Sherlock by the shoulders, pushing himself into his embrace, and all at once the world seemed to slip out from under him because this was unlike anything he’d ever felt, Sherlock’s hands, his lips, his
Sherlock stood, rooted to the spot, the words barely making sense in his whirling mind. No, he couldn’t have – not
“You said, the day after we met, that you were married to your work.”
laugh, breathless and rasping. “Please, don’t patronize me. You’ve got a pack of high-tar cigarettes in your pocket. You’re prepared for the worst.”
John nodded knowingly, and Sherlock relaxed a bit more.
John looked sideways at him, eyes wide. “Sherlock, don’t listen –”
“I know.” John shifted infinitesimally closer to Sherlock, exhaled deeply. “I know.”
And with another messy kiss John reached in between their bodies and took Sherlock in hand, stroking long and luxuriously over his aching cock, giving him just enough sweet pressure in combination with each hard, perfect thrust and that was it, that was it. Sherlock’s back arched off the mattress into John’s chest, John’s name bursting from his lungs as he crashed over the edge; flames, white and searing, coursed through his extremities and he was coming, hard and fast over John’s hand, his hips still pushing back to meet John’s thrusts as he rode out his sweet pleasure.
Mrs. Holmes’ voice suddenly barked out in Portuguese: “What did you say?”
“I’m Sherlock.” The man reached back and shook John’s hand once. A jolt of electricity raced up from John’s fingers all the way up his arm at the contact. “Sherlock Holmes – I’m Sam’s music teacher.”
“Sherlock,” John repeated, shaking it. “Good to meet you. That’s a nice name.”
He couldn’t do anything but pull him down by the nape for another bone-deep kiss, licking into his mouth with a slow, desperate urgency, and he knew Sherlock could feel the tangle of emotions coming through in each of his movements – gratitude, wonder, longing,
He should have left after his speech. He wished he had done. But Mary’s patronizing words from weeks ago were still ringing in his ears, making sure he knew that his Best Man duties extended to “taking care” of the guests during the reception – whatever that was supposed to mean. Sherlock supposed it included monitoring everyone’s alcohol intake and having the same “Isn’t-it-just-wonderful-don’t-they-look-lovely-together” conversation with anyone who happened to come near him. And, well, if that’s what John wanted him to do, he’d stay until the last guest had stumbled off, and John and Mary had disappeared to –
Sherlock held up his index finger. “He’s the
” Sherlock said. His breath was close to John’s ear – he’d tucked his face into John’s hair.
John kissed him deeper, pulled him in tighter. He was about to give himself over entirely, and he’d never been more ready.
John hummed, contentedly. He let Sherlock’s legs slot between his, and he could feel him all along his body, now. Sherlock, not breaking the kiss, shifted his hips a little to pull him closer still, and John felt his cock, half-hard, press up against his.
“Um…” John was stammering now, too. “This is – my sister, Harry,” he indicated one of the women at the back, “and – Clara, and my cousins, Tony and Julie…”
,” Sherlock said, quickly. “But the truth is, I’m in love. I was before she died, and there’s nothing I can do about it.”
He made himself turn away from them all so he wouldn’t look for John, and listened; time slipped by quickly, as if someone had pressed fast-forward on the telly, and before Sherlock could even get his bearings the theatre had become silent, and there was a teacher on stage announcing the first performance.
Mrs. Hudson moved toward them and Sherlock stepped into her hug without thinking. He let his head fall onto her shoulder with relief as she clasped her hands around his back.
Reluctantly, he untangled himself from Sherlock’s warm embrace, and squeezed his hand before heading off to the shower. Sherlock passed him on his way to the bedroom, flashing him a knowing smile. John felt a twinge of something in his belly, and hurried up.
The still air in the room settled over them again; the howling wind echoed outside against the window, but couldn’t needle its way in. Beneath the sheets, their warm bodies, their tangle of limbs, was their own private haven. John could feel Sherlock’s heart beating against his chest, and there was nothing but pure, elated happiness in his own.
Sherlock had protested vehemently from the start, his adamant refusal leading to a one of the biggest rows 221B had ever seen. But Mycroft persisted, and eventually overruled him by citing the many favours he’d done for Sherlock over the years and claiming it was high time Sherlock did one for him. To his credit, he’d softened the blow with a promise that it would only take a couple days at most, as well as a substantial monetary compensation that even Sherlock couldn’t dismiss But the row had recommenced with even more fervour, and took even longer to resolve, when Mycroft had insisted that John stay behind.
“Yeah.” Sherlock dipped in for one last kiss. “Go on. And meet me in the bedroom.”
It was another one of his whims, and he decided to just go along with it. Anyway, he’d barely seen Sherlock at all in the last couple weeks, and it only seemed right that he should before he set off. He spent the tube journey twisting his hands impatiently – he couldn’t wait to see the look on his face.
John jumped backwards at the sound, his face snapping toward Sherlock. He pulled his hand away, from where Magnussen had been holding him by the wrist.
She didn’t. Her eyes flashed at him, bright with malice. “They did.”
“My domestic god,” Sherlock added, fondly, as John yelped and shook with suppressed giggles.
If Sam was right, and there really was one perfect person for everyone, clearly the boy had found his. She’d been his entire focus since his mother died, his source of joy and of pain, and the thing that made him trust John more than he ever had before.
“Do you want the last one?” he asked, offering it.
Sherlock exhaled quietly, the ghost of a smile pulling at his downturned lips. “Alright.”
He gestured toward the desk, where John’s typewriter lay next to the rest of the manuscript.
have gone insane if I’d stayed any longer.”
And before he could even register the manic blaze in the suspect’s eyes – a soft
“So if you really love Christmas –”
There were a few whispers, and an awed hush descended on the room as Sherlock listened.
An invisible fist squeezed around John’s throat.
He walked Sherlock home afterwards, trying his best to be a proper gentleman but finding it harder and harder to resist taking hold of Sherlock’s hand when they brushed against each other as they walked. Finally, they arrived at his flat, and Sherlock paused at the door.
“Okay.” Relief siphoned away some of the dread bottled in his chest, but it still loomed darkly over him. “I’ll talk to you later. Bye.”
“Wow.” The look on John’s face was mildly impressed. “That was good of them.”
He sighed, heavily.
Sherlock’s eyes were glistening like starlight. Lips wobbling.
She hesitated for a moment, then chuckled briefly. “Well, you’d know better than I would, wouldn’t you? He hardly lets you out of his sight!”
“Sherlock!”
quite have liked to join him, but he didn’t really feel like navigating so many doors and obstacles in such a small space. He just wanted to lie down.
His Dad looked concerned, his lined forehead creasing. “Maybe school?” he asked. “Are you being bullied?”
Sherlock drew another shaking breath; he didn’t let himself finish that thought. Instead he clutched John’s hand tighter, moved his fingers over ghostly pale skin – too cold, too cold. He watched his face intently, waiting for any change, any indication of consciousness, any signal that John could hear his incessant, broken pleas,
John exhaled contentedly, basking in how relaxed he suddenly felt. “Oh, I could do this all day.”
John took her hand and shook it, smiling, but his mind was racing with surprise and confusion.
Normally, he’d have just walked in. He had a key. He stayed there often enough, when his own luxurious flat got too big and too empty for him. But not this time. It wouldn’t have been right. He owed John that much – it was Christmas, after all.
“And what was that?” Mrs. Hudson chuckled again. “Turkish?”
“Você já pensou em uma carreira de cantor?” he said, with a charming smirk.
“No, sir.” The first boy shook his head rapidly.
“I mean it, John.” Sherlock’s voice was quiet, but an undercurrent of tender urgency sprang up in his words as he kissed at John’s lower jaw. “You were stabbed and left bleeding out in a shoddy alleyway, and you still won.” His thumb smoothed gently over John’s cheek, and he moved to plant a kiss there in its wake. “He nearly killed you, and you still fought your way back.”
Before John even knew what he was doing he had pushed Sherlock up against the wall and was kissing him,
by him, too. For the records, you know.”
going to have a shot at being with anyone ever again? He didn’t know what the future held, or what he wanted out of his life, but the more he thought about it the more the prospect of a completely carefree, no-strings-attached excursion halfway around the world for someone,
Another second, and then understanding clicked into place in him with a jolt.
“There’s quite a lot to work with, this time of year,” Sherlock went on. “It inspires.”
. Blood, so much blood, seeping through John’s shirt, staining his jacket, running down toward his palms…
John nodded, feeling dazed. “Yeah,” he said faintly. “I’m sure they’ll be great.”
Sherlock sighed and pushed a hand back through his curls, trying to steady himself.
“Do you think I should?”
“You are the most thoughtful man in the world,” he whispered to him.
“Like what?”
“Yeah, thanks, love,” John said with relief, sinking a bit more heavily into the cushions.
“N-no, it’s nothing really,” John piped up, shaking his head.
She was hurrying toward him, more quickly than he’d ever seen her move. Lestrade was right behind her.
“I just wanted to tell you that, um…”
This story is based on the one in the film featuring Jack (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page), two body doubles for sex scenes in a film.
This chapter is based on the story originally featuring Sarah (Laura Linney) and Karl (Rodrigo Santoro). Again, with some important changes made to the ending :).
looking towards John, who had a hand covering his face, though Sherlock though he saw him trying to stifle a grin.
Sherlock held his gaze, and it felt solid and sure, a calming counterpoint to the rush of sensation that overtook him as Sherlock’s finger pushed inside; slowly, oh so slowly, working his way up to the first knuckle, then the second, the gentle pressure warming John’s very core. He let out a slow exhale, luxuriating in the feeling.
“Well, tell you what,” he went on. “We need Robin, and we need Cary. And we need them
just around the corner.”
Portuguese translations:
He felt John gasp a bit, and they were swaying slightly together, moving into each other without quite knowing how, but feeling their way forward with unpracticed lips and long-untouched hands, closer and closer towards something unfamiliar, but instinctive, and bone-deep comforting in how
They passed by the jumpers and started to pick their way through the maze-like jewellery section. It was less crowded here, but all the salespeople were looking expectant, and Sherlock wasn’t keen for their advances just now. All the same, he paused for a second in front of the Cartier counter to look down at the pocket watches in the display. He never could resist a glance at them, especially the one with that silver webbing design along the casing – clearly Victorian-inspired, a style he’d always had a fondness for.
“Itzhak Perlman…” John repeated, slowly. “Isn’t that the one you had a poster of in your room when you were fourteen?”
Sherlock lingered there for a few more seconds, then returned. John pulled him back into bed. In his darkness-disoriented hurry, though, he forgot how close he was to the wall – he scooted back a bit too far, and smacked his head against it.
Mr. Holmes stepped back to let him enter first. John squared himself in the doorway, took in one last, steadying breath, and stepped inside.
The worst times where when they passed each other, in the lift, or the copy room, or even just crossing the office. Every time, there would be nothing but a stiff nod, and silence. No eye contact. John couldn’t have stood it.
A distant part of his mind gratefully registered the sirens coming up the street behind him. He let out a final gasp, whispering constantly as he smoothed the lines of John’s brow.
John raised his hand to Sherlock’s face. He slid his thumb along that gorgeous cheekbone, the way he’d wanted to for so long.
Sherlock was mouthing the words as he reached outward and pointed his finger straight ahead, his other hand on his hip and rotating slowly, like a perfect disco legend.
But Sherlock was unbuttoning his shirt, and sliding it off his shoulders.
Sherlock started. “Tell him what?”
“Which one?” John’s voice was barely detectable, just the smallest whisper of breath against Sherlock’s neck. Still, Sherlock felt the sensation in his entire body, firing through his neurons like electricity. He suppressed a shiver, and tried
Then a loud buzzing sound erupted from the direction from the nightstand.
Even in profile, Sherlock could see the cool smile settling on her rouged lips, and it made that chilly darkness swell up in his chest again.
“John,” he whispered. He
They let the last of the giggles escape them, then John sighed with a bright smile and stooped to pick up his bag. “I’d better go unpack,” he said, a bit shyly, a bit endearingly.
“So am I,” Sherlock said. His voice was barely a sound.
He slept most of the way there, wanting to be alert for when he arrived wherever he was going. It all seemed a bit unreal, still. He could hardly imagine what he’d find when he arrived. Could he really be right? Would he really find someone in America as amazing as the concept he’d built up inside his mind?
John’s brow crinkled – another pang shot through Sherlock’s chest – but he opened his mouth hesitantly and yelled back: “It’s carol singers!”
crack this! Remember, I was a kid once, too!”
record I’ve heard this century!... oh, and coincidentally, I believe Sherlock will be a guest on Mike’s show in a few minute’s time.”
John kept his eyes on the road, but he thought he could see Sherlock looking at him again, out of the corner of his eye. Well, he might as well hear it, hadn’t he? It wasn’t as if he knew what John was talking about.
Doctor Watson,” he murmured against him.
“Told you,” John grinned back, trying not to be too wary of the hope rising in his heart. “I don’t think I’ll need the bandage anymore.”
good.” John said hurriedly, needing to assuage the uncertainty looking back at him. He needed Sherlock to know how much John wanted this. Needed him to stay.
He felt tears stinging his eyes, and didn’t bother to wipe them away. What did it matter? John couldn’t see. Wouldn’t have
The room was dark and they fumbled for a while with clothing, too frantic to stop and work their way through it. The tiny twin bed made movements awkward (John thought about complaining to the innkeeper after all), but they weren’t exactly in a position to grumble about it, and they groped and rutted against each other and came apart with deep moans and shaking gasps, and John was asleep with Sherlock’s liquor-soured breath against his neck before his brain even had a chance to get a handle on what they had just done.
“So if you really love me.” Sherlock tried to keep his own smile from being audible in the song. “Come on and let it show.”
“Yeah,” he said, shaking his head the tiniest bit to clear it. “Stepdad, actually.”
“Please?”
“Of course,” John said, turning away from Mia at last and making his way towards Sherlock. “And all the paperwork that’ll come with it.”
That awful look on John’s face.
He bent forward and dropped a gentle kiss to Sherlock’s cheek. Sherlock closed his eyes and leaned into it, humming.
Molly blinked a few times, something dangerously close to pity in her eyes. Lestrade was the first to recover.
Sarah raised an eyebrow. “Invite him out for a drink, then, after about twenty minutes, casually drop into the conversation the fact that you’d like to marry him and have lots and lots of sex?”
Sherlock knew his dad wanted to talk. He was doing that thing where he kept clearing his throat for too long, and a lot louder than he normally did. Dad didn’t know he did this, because Sherlock hadn’t told him. Like Mycroft had said, people were very strange about the things they didn’t want to know about themselves.
Neither of them moved. They stared at each other, their breath billowing in front of them.
Sherlock kept his eyes closed. If there was one thing he knew he couldn’t do, it was watch John walk away again. Not now.
wet heat of his mouth made Sherlock throw his head back and let out a sharp bitten-off cry.
“– it doesn’t have to be like this, John, you –”
He’d found John’s face way at the back of the crowd. His blue eyes were wide with an emotion Sherlock couldn’t read. There was too much in the way.
It’s all he can hear, whispered back to him against his trembling lips, a chorus of
Four and a half hours later and Sherlock was up to his knees in police reports and murder files, papers flying haphazardly around the table as he worked through Sokolov’s most likely method of attack, when he was granted a blessed reprieve at the sound of the lift doors sliding open.
“Well, this must be a very exciting moment for you, fighting for the Christmas number one!” said Jonathan Ross, a week later. “How’s it looking so far?”
“And this is John,” he said.  “He’s new, like you.”
relationship.”
,” John let out, indignantly, but it only made Sherlock burst out into giggles. “Just a stern talking-to about her kid. That wasn’t the odd part.”
“He’s doing his best, you know,” she said, and John opened his mouth to say the he
“Too true,” came Sarah’s voice from beside him.
“I feel it in my fingers.” The words were starting to make him feel ill. “I feel it in my toes.”
All your comments are very much appreciated :)
He shouted, inwardly.
There. That would do. Now he wouldn’t have to remember it. Lestrade gave him a little nod, and Sherlock moved on.
Sherlock grinned, and gave a little wave of his hand. “A tiny, insignificant detail.”
He can hear him though.
He was relieved that Sherlock’s eyes didn’t falter as he appraised the wound, satisfied. “Quite right,” Sherlock said quietly, and there was a matching confidence in his expression as he cleaned around the stitches, still so gentle, so careful.
Sherlock was about to open his mouth to
?” he asked, bewildered.
Mycroft gave him a hard stare, but didn’t say anything else as he walked out of it.
Everything in John seemed to come alive at once, beaming out of him in a watery smile that contorted his face with emotion.
“Please!” The boy beside her added his imploring voice.
Well. He supposed that was it, then.
“I mean, if you wouldn’t rather –”
Sherlock closed his eyes and leaned into John’s palm, savoring every touch, so tender it
“This is Greg Lestrade, he’s in charge.” Mycroft said, indicating the first man in the line. This one was middle-aged with slightly greying hair, and an easy expression on his face.
With a final glint of joy, Sherlock pushed the door open and stepped through it, flashing a final shy look at John as it closed behind him.
“Yeah…” he said, so softly it was a moment before Sherlock realized he had spoken.
It was a perfect afternoon, really. John felt so utterly satisfied, his body heavy with the kind of tiredness that only comes with pure contentment.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered against the wound. “More than anything. I love you. Please…” His voice was shaking heavily, like a sob. “Please know that.”
“I’m afraid you did it again, Sherlock,” he said.
John paused a moment before tearing his gaze away, and stepped tantalizingly close as he strode past Sherlock and into the conference room. Sherlock took a moment before following him, sipping at his coffee and suppressing a sudden unexpected tide of affection at the taste. Black, two sugars. Obviously. John always got it right.
Sherlock turned back to John, whose head snapped up to meet his gaze. His hands were clenching in his lap.
A shot ricocheted off the alley wall, and John pulled Sherlock back around the corner.
“It’s not gonna be exactly fun, though. Being up there alone.” He sighed again. “Never really been good at that.”
She titled her chin up with authority as she looked back at him, but after a few seconds turned away without another word.
He reached for the phone, letting his forehead fall into his other hand as he answered. “Hey,” he said, quietly, then paused to listen. “Mhm, absolutely. Free as a bird, fire away.”
“Almost certainly.” Sherlock passed him a file, open to a black-and-white headshot of gaunt, grey-haired man. “Dmitri Orlova, sixty-two. Andrei Orlova was his son.”
He cups John’s face in his hand. Skin too cold.
“Keith will be
They sat themselves in the chairs facing the desk, holding hands across the gap. John’s eyes were closed. He had to hold back, hold back,
“Oh?” Sherlock’s eyebrows raised, and he looked both interested and amused. “What did you say to the poor woman?”
“You want to marry my son?” he asked.
The door clicked shut, and John let his shoulders sag, the perfectly tailored scowl dropping off his face.
“Knocks off the king when there are no pawns left to defend him, yes.” Sherlock’s mind was rapidly speeding up, the spacecraft on the launch pad, firing on all cylinders.
“Yeah.” John nodded. “Of course.”
He barely heard himself, he was too lost in it. Sherlock smoothed his hand up and down John’s side a little, and sped up his strokes within him. John cried out, the pressure in his abdomen mounting. It was
“Alright?”
Sherlock turned around to see John again, with an intense, desperate sort of vulnerability worrying the creases of his brow.
“Yes, in a sense.” Sherlock looked at him sideways, still grinning. “And you could follow Sirius the whole journey and never lose your way.”
John sighed gratefully, smiling against his lips. He leaned forward so that they were chest to chest, and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s torso almost protectively. He nipped at Sherlock’s bottom lip, playfully, then grinned for a moment, pulled the lip between his teeth, and sucked.
Sherlock’s mind was spinning. He held the phone away from his mouth for a moment, casting his gaze out the window, as if the right thing to say was written in a shop display somewhere.
“Okay, yeah, that didn’t actually seem to bother her at first.” John grimaced slightly at the memory. “But I kept telling her that nothing was gonna happen, and if she kept trying to
John and Sherlock smiled at each other once more, then Sherlock turned back to face the pillar.
“Hey, watch it.” John turned his head, seeking Sherlock’s lips with a mock-indignant expression. “You’re just trying to get me into a suit whenever you can.”
, it wasn’t supposed to be like this, it was supposed when they were safe, when they were finally home, when they were warm and together and John had had a chance to say it back…
The door swung open, and John stood there, framed in the entranceway.
Sherlock chuckled at that, low in his chest, but there was something a bit off about it that John’s pain-addled brain couldn’t quite recognize. He looked up at Sherlock’s face, and found that the laughter didn’t quite reach his eyes.
He let the kiss go on for many long, perfect moments, before John broke it with a quiet sigh, struggling yet again to hold his eyes open.
A second that seemed to stretch on for an hour or more, and then John looked up at him.
“H-hi,” Sherlock said, as he passed. It came out as stammering, strangled sound.
Sherlock’s hands tugged gently at John’s shirt, untucking it and undoing the buttons, and there was no more hesitation lurking underneath his fingertips. There was no more wariness in his movements, just a raw intensity of devotion, and John felt it in the way he slowly pushed his shirt off his shoulders with careful movements, the way he held John gently by the waist with one hand as he undid his belt with the other. That same reassurance that had always been there, just now with more heartfelt earnestness than ever, and John poured even more quiet passion into their kisses, his eyes prickling with the realization that even now, even here, Sherlock was going to take care of him.
do. The rest was impossible, like he’d always known it was, but this…this could be his, still.
Below it, Perlman’s face peered out at him overtop of his violin.
“So we, um.” His left hand clenched at his side underneath the table. “We probably shouldn’t bring this back to London, then.”
“That’s my address in New York,” John said in a breathy rush. His eyes were staring into Sherlock’s eagerly now. “Write to me?”
The screen cut to a later shot, of John outside the church. He was laughing, the corners of his eyes crinkling, as he watched the confetti come down upon them.
John hitched a leg higher and rocked with him, feeling pressure build up second by lingering second, and it was pure, slowly-mounting bliss. John’s mind had emptied itself of everything but Sherlock, his kiss-swollen lips and soothing hands and the perfect, luxurious roll of his hips that sent white-hot sparks tingling up to John’s scalp. It was everything John needed, slow and intimate and profound, and the minutes seemed to stretch out into hours, John’s head whirling with ecstasy, as Sherlock moved within him and took him apart piece by enraptured piece.
John turned on his side and slid his arm around Sherlock’s chest, holding him close as he shuddered. He squeezed him as tightly as he dared, pressing his entire body into his back through every available point of contact, and tucked his own bleak face into the crook of Sherlock’s neck.
“No, don’t apologize,” John whispered. His eyes might have been shining now, too. “Don’t ever apologize for loving me.”
“Hurry up, big boy!” came Mary’s voice from inside the bedroom. “I’m naked and I want you at least twice before John gets home!”
Sherlock's voice was clear and firm. He reached up, and took John’s face in his hands.
“She was armed with a Makarov 71, and was taking aim at Orlova’s head when I took the shot.”
” he screamed.
“Thanks, love.” John’s heart swelled a bit, though he knew he wouldn’t be touching them. He pushed himself fully upright and cradled the tea in front of his face, pulling the warm fragrance in through his nose to chase away the remaining tension in his muscles.
“There we go,” he murmured. Low and sweet – a hint of a smile against Sherlock’s temple.
the chaos seemed to be so endless.
“Well, I just thought,” she said, looking quite serious. “That maybe the time had come to do something about it?”
“Now here’s one for the lovers,” he crooned into it. His voice was breathy, and very much failing at smooth and sexy quality he was clearly aiming for. “There’s quite a few of you out there tonight, I shouldn’t be surprised.”
Sherlock looked up, following where his father was looking. On the screen high above them under the words
“You could have had the sofa, you know,” Sherlock said, with a smile in his voice.
“Or would you cut and run?”
He made a vague gesture toward the screen, then dropped his hand.
He could feel everything. Sherlock’s hand in his hair, stroking gently. His other hand holding John’s, steady and sure. The smell of him at the crook of his neck where John was resting – a hint of lavender, maybe, or vanilla. His porcelain skin, warmer than John’s by far.
The shot dragged on, and on; it was the longest one Sherlock had gotten. The John on screen rotated slowly, the camera catching every inch of him it could. Everything Sherlock couldn’t bear to lose.
“I – I have to say, Sherlock,” John stammered, as Sherlock’s eyes seemed to pierce him. “This is a real pleasure. It’s – I mean, it’s really nice to find someone I can actually chat to.”
“Well.” Sherlock’s voice was light when he spoke, though the note of hesitation was barely concealed. “I suppose I could respond to Mycroft’s badgering about finishing up the case file for his investigation…”
John reached tentatively forward and clasped Sherlock’s hand, still holding John’s keys.
“And…” Sherlock began, his eyes searching John’s, desperate and hopeful.
John sat himself in the low leather armchair, facing away from them.
He handed Sherlock’s jacket back to him, and stepped out the door with a nod, leaving Sherlock blank, baffled, and with a strange sort of tugging sensation in his chest.
“I love you, too.” Sherlock gently took the mug out of John’s faltering fingers and laid it on the table.
“Right, of course not,” Sherlock smirked back. He came back into the sitting room, extended his hand to John. “Come on, old man, you’re knackered.”
There was no room in his voice for argument, but Sherlock actually didn’t feel much like arguing anyway. He was still riding the wave of the past hour.
It was a bizarre way to put it, and John was clearly left even more befuddled, his searching eyes darting from Sherlock’s face to the bottle of champagne clutched in his hand, which Sherlock had snagged from Elton’s bar on his way out.
Sherlock gasped aloud, the sound muffled by his hand, and the ringing in his ears subsided just enough to allow him back to earth.
“We’ll see,” John said, as he pulled down two mugs and set them on the counter.
“She’s incredibly lucky, to have someone like you,” Sherlock murmured.
“Oh,” said Ugly Jumper, clearly let down. “That’s great.”
Without words, John indicated that Sherlock should cover Orlova. Sherlock nodded, edging as close as he could to him without being detected.
“Go.” John made an almost frantic grab for his seatbelt as Sherlock started the car.
He’d been hoping, maybe, to keep Sherlock in bed on one of these mornings, one where his wound was quiet enough and everything else took a break for an hour or so. He loved Sherlock in the mornings, so soft and pliant, all warm skin and private smiles, and he’d missed that easy intimacy in the resolute way Sherlock had taken up his duties since John had been home. He’d tried, too – their last couple good-morning kisses, John had pulled Sherlock close to deepen them, pushing his tongue gently into Sherlock’s mouth and feeling his body relax under his hands – before Sherlock’s back would stiffen and he’d break away gently, pulling John up out of bed and into the bathroom before John could formulate a reason for them to stay.
“Just give me one second,” he said. “Okay?”
John pursed his lips, feeling tears well up in his eyes, emotion rising up to create a dangerous blockage in his throat.
“I love you,” he whispered, and his voice was too heavy, almost broken, but a reply was already far beyond John’s reach, and he’d slipped into sleep before the weight of it could settle on him.
“Come on!” he called back to Sherlock.
John burst into a low chuckle. “Shut up and come here.”
,” John laughed, then fought to suppress a groan as the movement expanded his chest at the wound. “Just,” he gritted his teeth slightly, tried to reign in the pain. “I guess I didn’t expect you to be so good at it.” He shook his head a bit. “Silly of me.”
“E depois, você vai me levar para casa?”
Sherlock had turned to look at him, his bewilderment obvious.
“I mean – nothing
“You feel amazing,” Sherlock murmured.
Sherlock stepped down onto the lower floor, and John stepped forward. They were inches from each other, alight and beaming, the rest of the world forgotten.
“Oh, God,” Sherlock said, breathlessly, shaking his head. “Brilliant. That’s
He mimed wiping tears away from his eyes. “Ou…” He let out a few bursts of fake laughter.
“John.”
John’s smirk burst open into laughter – the sound sweeter than a symphony to Sherlock’s ears – and he straightened up, bottle of lube in hand. His eyes twinkled with warmth and affection, and they swept the length of Sherlock’s naked body, taking in everything with a joyous fondness in his expression that made a pink flush creep into Sherlock’s cheeks.
John had to swallow his heart back down from his throat to stop himself from weeping.
He groaned low in his sandpaper-rough throat as he stretched out his leaden limbs. He rolled over onto his back and opened his eyes, squinting against the tempered late-afternoon light.
Sherlock cocked his head the tiniest bit. He couldn’t believe
He heard Sherlock moan above him, dimly, and his free hand held John steady by the hips.
“John, hello,” he said, maybe a bit too excitedly.
“Thank you.”
Sherlock could feel little vibrations of motion carrying across the space between them – a shake of the head, maybe, or – a trembling of the lips?
John couldn’t look away. The sight of him, wearing John’s jumper and cheeks still tinged pink from the cold, was overwhelming every other thought in his head.
Sherlock shifted up to John’s lips again. “I love you.”
He cast around desperately for something to say that would be enough, that would encompass all his gratitude and his awe and his adoration in a few feeble words, but Sherlock saved him the trouble by pushing his sketchpad over to him.
Sherlock took a few deep breaths. He could do this. This was what he’d been practicing for. A few girls around them were muttering to each other about stage fright as they started to take their places behind the curtain, but Sherlock tuned them out. His nerves weren’t about performing. He’d played in front of people lots of times before. No, this was when everything was either going to slot into place, or it wasn’t. It was his last chance. He had to make it count.
But when he finally looked back up at John, he was smiling again, and his eyes were sparkling with mischief.
But Sherlock had already disconnected. It wasn’t time for explanations, yet.
Sherlock sat at the edge of his seat the whole way, his heart whirring as fast as the car, that final, high note of that song echoing over and over in his ears.
“I feel it in my toes.”
Oh God, John could
“Well,” he said, gesturing for John to sit down. “Where do you live, for instance?”
“This could backfire on you really badly, you know that,” he’d said as they’d sat in the dark in John’s Baker Street flat, watching Sherlock’s Graham Norton spot.
John turned his head to stare at the phone, which was inching forward on the table with every vibration.
“I fear,” Sherlock said, the words coming to his mind milliseconds before he heard himself say them. “That this has become a
,” was all he could gasp out, and Sherlock’s soft smile almost made him crumble.
“I love him,” he said simply. “And true love lasts a lifetime.”
The painting stared back, and Sherlock’s mouth twisted into an amused sneer at the idea of what she would say if she could see him now.
“Mmm. Charming. And he’s our happy victim tonight?”
“You’re beautiful, John,” he whispered into the crook of his neck. His chest pressed up warm against his back – at some point, he’d rid himself of his shirt – and John could feel his heartbeat against his skin. His own pulse was pounding harder, more insistent every second.
Sherlock’s eyes were swimming with as many emotions as were clouding through John’s head. John saw everything inside him reflected back in those gorgeous pools of blue, more brilliant and enchanting than he’d ever seen them.
Sherlock’s lips quirked upward. “I think so too.” And he leaned in for another kiss.
“We can try.” Slowly, Sherlock hazarded another glance around the corner, but their suspect – one of Mycroft’s underlings who’d been selling state secrets on the side – had vanished down a narrow side street.
“Sorry,” the man echoed, and he stepped back too, looking up at John.
, John,” Sherlock returned, but he was laughing through his mock-sternness, and John’s heart grew lighter. “You’re still far from fully recovered. You could still hurt yourself if you’re not careful.”
“Yes I did.” Sherlock’s eyes shone brightly with love and happiness and a tenderness so profound it shot right through John’s heart.
As the haze of his arousal ebbed away, and Sherlock’s mouth came to kiss tenderly at the nape of his neck, John started to feel the remaining tension in Sherlock’s hands, in his torso pressed up against his back. John sighed, contentedly, tried to push back against him, but only managed to twitch his hips the slightest bit.
John, however, was already scrambling to his feet.
It might have been the wrong time, but John chuckled anyway, as Sherlock had hoped.
John tore his eyes away again, fixing them back on the screen in front of him. It was getting harder, every time, to stop himself from staring too long.
He fidgeted with his hands a little, clenched in his lap. They were still itching, burning with lost feeling.
“Listen, um,” John went on. “While we’re on that subject…”
“Oh, Jesus, not that crap again!” Sherlock yelled into the receiver. More laughter and cheers greeted this, but Sherlock hung up the phone before he could hear more than the opening notes of that wretched song.
Sherlock’s voice was laden with irony, and John felt hot indignation flush his face crimson.
further of the man who’d already given him everything John could conceivably need, everything Sherlock seemed capable of giving, felt akin to churlishness – like he’d be spitting on everything Sherlock had done for him all this time, degrading it into nothing.
“Wow,” he said, less brightly. “Thanks for that, Sherlock.”
Just as one of them was preparing an oxygen mask, John reached out clumsily for Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock held on tight; John’s eyes were suddenly focused.
Sherlock lowered his hand slowly, realization sinking into him inch by inch.
John quieted suddenly. His eyes blinked open and he fought to even out his breath, as Sherlock’s words whirled around his desire-clouded mind before coming to a halt. The words that weren’t just a refusal, but a vow and a reassurance and a declaration all wrapped up into one, and John felt his breath hitch again, not with arousal this time, as he held the steadfast gaze of the man who loved him.
“Who is it?” John called out, tossing Sherlock’s trousers at him.
Sherlock’s hand threaded through the hair at the nape of his neck – and the touch was so tender that John knew he did.
They were uncharacteristically quiet the rest of the scene. John was afraid his feelings would burst out of him if he tried to chat, and ruin everything before it had even begun. He kept catching Sherlock’s eye and then looking away nervously, and he
“Hi, Sherlock,” said the same host’s voice, now coming from the receiver.
But the thought was swiftly silenced as John moved against him with a little gasp, and Sherlock let the sensations wash over him. Maybe this would kill him, but he’d let it. He’d have died over and over again, for this one perfect kiss.
It was very late by the time he was able to drag himself up to his bedroom. He toed off his shoes and tugged off his tie and jacket, feeling weary down to his bones.
* * *
But the second he lifted it, the sheets of paper it had been resting on flew out from underneath it.
, but how was that possible, when Sherlock had never left his side? When Sherlock had been more caring, more affectionate, more tender with him than John could have ever felt he deserved? How could he ever make Sherlock feel like what he’d done wasn’t enough – like
“I see.”
Sherlock raised a hand to rub at his temple. “Got him then, did you?”
Mycroft raised an inquisitive brow. “He requested a transfer. I think he’s at Carlton Gardens now.”
“I don’t want to.”
“Fool!” John launched forward and dug his fingers into Sam’s sides.
,” he hissed; the pain had spiked up and radiated down to his shoulder. He reached his hand up, trying to knead it into submission.
“Yes!”
“No, you’ll be quicker,” John said a bit reluctantly; tempting as it was to ask him to stay, the ache was growing harder to ignore. He leaned forward where he sat, meeting Sherlock halfway for a brief kiss. “Go.”
John raised a hand and pressed his lips to it, then pressed it to his heart.
John’s smile dropped. Suddenly the flat seemed unnaturally silent.
“Well, call me an old man who can’t break habits.” John sent back, as he scrubbed down the kitchen counter.
Sherlock let himself out of the car and strode off towards the house with a brass number
The tap ran briefly and John returned in a moment, as promised, with a washed face and a hand towel, with which he gently wiped down Sherlock’s thighs and stomach, sweeping the damp fabric lightly across his sensitive skin, being especially careful around the base of his soft cock. He tossed the towel in the direction of the bathroom and crawled back into the bed, gathering a grateful Sherlock into his arms and pulling him to rest against his chest, their legs tangling together and John’s lips brushing sweetly against Sherlock’s brow.
Sherlock fell on his knees next to John, who was shaking and gasping and clutching at his side.
“Ah, right, yes.” Sherlock sighed. He’d been putting off discussing this, but there was no getting around it forever. “I feel this is going to be a difficult one to play.”
They wept. They trembled. They held each other, grasping at the shining new beacon of hope presented to them and holding tight with shaking, reverent hands. They breathed together, in and out, deep and strong until the masses dwindled from their throats, until their heartbeats beat out a steady tempo together, tapping out the rhythm of their second chance.
but it didn’t make his other feelings go away. And he liked to think that if she were here, she’d have been happy about it…
“Yeah,” John replied breathlessly. Sherlock’s breath was hot and wet against his lips. Slowly, John managed to blink his eyes open and find Sherlock’s, aglow in the darkness.
“No,” he said. “I’ve done fuck-all.”
Sherlock stood and hugged Mrs. Hudson one last time. Molly and Lestrade had gone home to the children soon after they’d gotten the news, promising to be back as soon as they could the next morning, and Mycroft had taken his leave soon after to return to the investigation (quietly passing the receptionist on his way out to make sure everything was in order). Mrs. Hudson, though, had insisted on staying with Sherlock until they let him in to see John, and had chatted cheerfully the whole time while the driver Mycroft had sent for her waited out in the car park.
8. “No!”
John let out a rough sound of his own, but his mouth turned up at the corners into something beautiful and genuine, and he kissed Sherlock once more underneath the blurry Christmas Eve sky.
Sherlock nodded again, his mouth twitching up at the corners.
Sherlock…” John’s voice came in a harsh whisper, his mind already reeling to keep up.
But he was barely listening – he was watching Sherlock as he left the room, and his hands were still burning – just the gentlest brush of contact, and it had set all his nerve endings alight.
coming up rather quickly, after all.
“Harry will be delighted.”
Sherlock just stared at him, silently, with a strange expression on his face. Then, after a second, he threw back his head with a rumbling, full-bellied laugh.
Harry blinked at him a few times, then sank back into the sofa cushions. Her head swivelled around, eying the woman behind the desk, the man keeping watch at the entrance.
“Mummy hated you saying that word,” he said, petulantly. He didn’t feel like laughing at all.
“What do you mean?”
“The cook. She just shot me down,” John replied, bitterly.
Sherlock’s heart soared at the familiarity of this. The two of them, at the height of a dangerous case, and laughing at something so mundane. It was like coming home.
“I played in her direction.” Sam said, dismissively. “That counts.”
But John didn’t look upset at all; in fact, his brows knitted together with what looked like sympathy. For
” she said, sounding instantly calm and annoyed as she pushed his hand away.
Sherlock straightened up again. John was looking at him with bewildered confusion, and something else. Sherlock recognized it – it was that look he got when he knew Sherlock was about to say something brilliant, but wasn’t sure what yet.
“We need a warrant to search Curtis’s flat.” John said firmly.
love…”
Sherlock couldn’t contain himself anymore. He let out a snigger, turning his face away.
The operator began to patch them through with her standard reassurances, but Sherlock had already dropped the phone.
He’d tried to say it with a modicum of a smile in his voice, a little self-deprecating humour, but Mike was looking shocked.
“Yeah,” she said, after a moment. “They don’t like me watching telly, so I’ve started going through Harry Potter again.”
“But Mum –!” The boy started to protest, but snapped is mouth shut at the dangerous look in his mother’s face.
he’d forgotten it was her class’ music period, and she’d have gone to fetch them from it. No matter. She’d be back in a couple minutes.
“No one’s trying to kill you, Harry,” he said.
“Yeah,” John said. He wasn’t looking at Sherlock. “I’m tired, you know? Been a busy month.”
They hoisted it onto their shoulders, him and the five other pallbearers, and moved off down the aisle. John was in the front, and set his jaw firm, marching onward, steady and straight-backed. The last thing he could try to do properly for her. This was one he couldn’t fail.
“Yeah, I could eat,” John replied, realizing with relief that his stomach wasn’t in knots this morning. He took Sherlock’s hand as he pulled back and made to gather him up out of bed. “Did you get coffee?”
to go…”
Sherlock sucked in a wheezing breath, then sighed it out, expelling his laughter. “Then what was it?”
Steadily, fighting against a piercing ringing sound in his ears, Sherlock pulled enough air into his lungs to get his brain back under his control. He gulped in a few more stuttering breaths before it levelled out, and he was able to unclench his jaw and open his eyes.
John let out a laugh that was more like a gasp, and brought his hand up to Sherlock’s face, swept a thumb along his cheek.
Sherlock tried to watch – the kids weren’t bad, after all – but quickly found himself distracted by how close he was to John. He’d let go of his hand, but he couldn’t have been more than a few inches from him, and he could feel the warmth radiating from his body. His golden hair was close enough to his face for him to smell his shampoo – some sort of spice and pine.
“Yeah, great. Oh.” John suddenly seemed to remember the coffees he was carrying and held out one of the cups to Sherlock. “Here.”
“This isn’t how I imagined you playing nurse.” John’s voice was a bit too rough to achieve the lightheartedness he was going for.
“Oh, for God’s sake!” Mycroft stepped forward too and grabbed his own coat. “Mummy, come on!”
John pursed his lips; despite himself, he had the sudden urge to giggle along with him.
He turned in John’s arms to look at him, hands snaking around his torso and splaying protectively across his back. His eyes were dry, but they shone with something fierce and pained as they searched John’s, brow creased and jaw set, as if seeking evidence to back up John’s reassurances.
“What were you doing up there?” he asked. They hardly used the upstairs bedroom anymore, only ever dusting it out when Sherlock’s parents came to stay, or Harry needed a place to crash after another domestic.
“Hello, Mrs. Hudson,” he said, shaking her hand. This one, he thought,
“There was for Kate and Leo,” he said, with conviction. “And there is for me.”
“Alright, then,” the woman said, looking a bit relieved. She quickly took their names, then grabbed a key off the wall behind her. “Do you have any bags?”
“Terrific.” Sherlock nodded. “Thanks so much.”
. He’d never been this comfortable with anyone he’d ever worked with. They talked about anything and everything, down to the most mundane things that no one else would have ever wanted to listen to. But Sherlock seemed to hang off John’s every word, like he was enjoying himself just as much. And Sherlock himself was
“Mycroft got you here too, then?” Mrs. Hudson lowered herself into a chair and folded her hands tightly in her lap. “Thank goodness. Always good in a crisis, that one. I was so flustered I wouldn’t have known
Sherlock finally looked at John straight on. His arms were crossed over his chest, but his lips were pursed in an unsure…almost nervous way.
Sherlock gave a stiff nod against the pillow. “Mhm.”
“Stressful time of year?” she asked.
“Okay…” Sherlock said. “Well, the truth is, actually…I’m in love.”
Then he shifted his angle, just a fraction, and stars exploded behind John’s eyes.
“Alright?” he murmured.
“We have intelligence on six known safe houses, four of which are within ten city blocks of where the victims were found. It’s nearly impossible to track her MO, but their placement can’t be a coincidence, so she almost certainly visits one of the locations around the time of her killings. Andrei Orlova was killed two nights ago, and all the victims before him have been killed with decreasing increments of time between them. So whoever Sokolov is threatening, she’s getting close.”
John felt himself tense up again. “They’re not–?”
“More, Sherlock, please, I need-” His voice caught as Sherlock’s second finger slid all the way in, and he began lightly pumping them in and out, stroking at John’s very center.
This was it. It wasn’t over yet. This was
But he stared into his father’s earnest face, and knew he was right.
with the need to reach out to him, to wrap his arms around his shoulders, to press his lips to his temple and whisper that everything was alright, they were safe, no one had seen them – even as he was mentally kicking himself for such a miniscule gesture that had nonetheless been so reckless.
John gave him a small, sad smile.
“Come on,” he murmured.
Still, the entire ride was an exercise in restraint. John spent most of the time staring out the window, but would occasionally turn and catch Sherlock’s eye, lingering for a dangerously long moment before shifting his gaze away again.
John’s hand fumbled in his jacket pocket, and he extracted his phone. He fumbled at the screen with shaking fingers for a few seconds, then thrust it into Sherlock’s hand.
John visibly relaxed, and he smiled again – that soft, private smile that he saved for Sherlock alone – and Sherlock thrilled so much at the sight that he couldn’t help but return it.
“We all will.”
” against his mouth with a voice so dripping with longing it was scarcely recognizable as his own.
Sherlock’s eyes fell closed, and John could see everything he’d been holding back written in the lines of his face. His heart constricted in his chest, and he pushed a hand up to thread through the curls at the nape of his neck, needing Sherlock to feel him, needing him to
Sherlock started.
to be alone with him…
John inched his hand closer in the space between them, but didn’t touch; morning would come soon, and John couldn’t rob him of the only peace he’d seen on him in far too long. His fingers itched, his entire body resisting that instinctive tug toward Sherlock’s warmth, but John kept himself still. Kept himself at the same arm’s length Sherlock had been keeping him emotionally, and wondered if Sherlock felt that same emptiness in his own heart, that agony of being so close but still unable, still unwilling to make that final reach.
He hadn’t meant to say it, and Mike’s eyes widened again with uncontained shock, but Sherlock truly couldn’t see any other way around this that wouldn’t sound horribly forced and ridiculous. There was no way he could go on pushing this song seriously, no matter what John thought, but they were in it now and if he had to put his own neck on the block, that’s just what he would do.
“I know. Oh God, I know.” John’s voice was becoming equally as strained. He brushed a curl away from Sherlock’s temple. “I love you too.”
John didn’t sound frustrated, or upset, but there was a sort of tired quality about his understanding smile. His blue eyes weren’t sparkling like they normally were. Not that Sherlock could blame him.
“You’re mad,” he said, finally.
He pulled it out of his pocket. It was John. His heart kicked up, and he couldn’t tell whether it was from excitement or fear.
John gave a soft little groan. “Nah, I’m good actually.”
The first one was a generic Christmas tree cover. On the inside, below the pre-printed text, was written “Have another prosperous year, Prime Minister!”.
Sherlock stood staring into the glaring lights and monitors, with his back to a large, excited crowd.
“And how about you?” John asked. “Are you doing alright? With – everything?”
“Hello,” Sherlock said, without preamble. “Does John live here?”
Sherlock sat stock-still, unable even to respond to Molly’s embrace. “What are you doing here?”
Trembling, John’s hands slid to the front of Sherlock’s jacket and pushed it off his shoulders. Sherlock shrugged himself out of it, then joined John’s hands working the buttons of his shirt. That tumbled to the floor too, and then Sherlock was bare-chested before him and John’s hands were roving over him like a man trying to find his way in the dark – they travelled over every ripple of muscle, every smooth expanse, tingling with electricity at the feeling. It was too much and not enough, all at once.
Sherlock’s smile dropped off his face, replaced by a heavy, unpleasant rush of guilt that swept over him. In the background he heard the song playing out of Mike’s headphones. It made his stomach churn even more.
“It’s best if you can inject it
Neither of them spoke the entire way there. Sherlock wove in and out of traffic with ease, his eyes focused straight ahead. John only dared glance at him out of the corner of his eye once or twice, thinking this might all dissolve around him if he contemplated it too long.
The music was gliding over them, soft and familiar, and it made the room feel warmer, the fire brighter, John’s lips sweeter. Or, maybe that was just John. Probably it was. All their years married, and Sherlock had yet to find a single beautiful thing that John couldn’t make better by being there to share it with him.
“Shhh, it’s alright. We’re alright. ” John pushed a gentle hand back through Sherlock’s hair. “You won’t have to find out.”
lecture him about “going too far” after the show, but then again, it had been
Sherlock laughed, a pathetic little guffaw, really, more than anything. But there was just something so
For some reason, John had the distinct impression that he was teasing him. He could feel his cheeks burning hot.
Sherlock’s eyes fell closed, and he dropped his face into his hand.
But John’s eyes were still on him, softer now. Looking curious. And maybe, if Sherlock wasn’t imagining it, hopeful?
John let himself watch for a bit. Sherlock was absorbed, after all, and there was no one around to bother with him looking – especially if they all knew anyway, according to Sarah. He grimaced a bit at the thought, but kept his eyes fixed on him, entranced by the way his lips pursed in irritation then relaxed with a sigh, speaking with continuous words John couldn’t hear.
of the bottle cap opening, and then Sherlock’s hands were on him again, slicked with warm oil, rubbing at the tightness in his back.
John entire body was shuddering, bucking into Sherlock’s hand and pushing back onto his cock, and his head was spinning with endorphins, he couldn’t speak, couldn’t think, could only feel, feel the flame inside him blazing up into an inferno as Sherlock rocked into that perfect spot within him, those gorgeous fingers dragging gloriously over him, pulling him to the brink…
It didn’t take long for that to wear off. The pain didn’t recede as it normally did that evening, and John’s stomach twisted around itself as the drugs struggled and failed to fight it. He had to shrug away Sherlock’s attempts to get him to eat, and fell into a fitful sleep when he went to bed early, feeling more frustrated than ever that even such little activity could worsen his condition so much.
“Yeah,” John said, a breathless humour in his voice. “She tried to come onto me while we were dancing – you remember – and I told her she was wasting her time, and that I was married.”
“I am…sorry for my harshness over the phone earlier.” He’d lowered his eyes into his lap. “I didn’t yet know what had happened.”
“Please,” Sherlock gasped out raggedly. He swiped a thumb over John’s beautiful jaw, wiping away a spot of saliva from his activities. “Please, John, I need you, I need you so badly, please…”
“Last night meant a lot to me, too,” he carried on, his voice quiet. “And it wasn’t just because of everything I was feeling – about the hound…”
“Ow!” A dull throb spread out from the back of his head, and he grabbed at it with his hand.
When they ran out of stories, Sherlock began to pace.
“…it’s Sherlock Holmes!”
Which Sherlock was sure she wouldn’t. Why would she? Unless Sherlock had made a mistake and miscalculated something –
“Please, sir, please!” The other little girl cried out.
“It’s true!” John said, more strongly. He didn’t know why he was suddenly so eager to prove this. “I’d get a girlfriend instantly in America.”
“Almost everything is just old digitized case files, now –”
“Sorry, sorry.” Sherlock was saying above him.
He awoke with a start in the darkness when bile began to rise up in his throat, and threw himself out of bed groaning, his body straining at the wound. He just barely made it to the toilet before he began to heave, his insides screaming in pain as his stomach emptied itself of its meager, watery contents.
Mike turned away from his own microphone to muffle a chortle.
,” John breathed back. “
“Yeah, help yourself.”
“Do you trust me?” John asked. He was standing behind Sam, who was perched on the coffee table, arms stretched out in imitation of the couple on the screen.
Sherlock pushed John up against the door – slamming it with a loud bang – and finally,
He rubbed a hand against his throbbing forehead. It wasn’t going to help.
His hand shakes on the rock.
“As if you’re not,” Sherlock grinned against John’s collarbone.
“Alright, alright,” Lestrade groaned, hunching his shoulders and pressing his hands hard into his face. “If I get you the warrant, will you spare me the explanation?”
And John kissed him, long and lingering, letting Sherlock hold him tight, letting him heal.
Sherlock waited until his footsteps had receded before opening his eyes. His own gulping breaths were all he could hear, drowning out all the chaos and bustle of the A&E.
He pictured John down at the bar, swirling the liquid in his glass and checking his watch every few minutes, trying for the life of him not to look as conspicuous as he felt. Waiting, just as Sherlock was waiting, for the perfect moment to slip away.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock jumped down to the landing.
An uncomfortable silence hung in the air for a few moments, then Lestrade reached across the circle to hand Sherlock back his phone. “No answer from Harry,” he said evenly. “I tried her three times, but it’s after midnight, she’s probably asleep.”
“Oh, not bad,” Sherlock smiled back, tilting his head up to receive John’s affectionate kiss. “It comes in waves.”
Sherlock looked horribly stricken, but he managed to squeeze his hand weakly.
John let out a small gasp – he hadn’t even realized that tension had been pooling in between his legs. But his cock was slowly stiffening, pressing up against the heat of Sherlock’s, nothing but John’s pants between them.
Sherlock was silent for a while, smiling as he observed the people milling around with mild interest. The way the cool light in the ballroom shone down at him made his pale skin look almost ethereal.
“Sherlock, time for dinner!” Dad yelled through the door to his bedroom one night when he was on one of his practicing sprees.
“John, I have to tell you something –”
John was silent for a moment behind him – then, just as Sherlock’s heart was about to beat soundly through his ribs, he gave a small chuckle.
Fumbling a bit, Sherlock pulled the little video camera out from the inside pocket of his jacket. It had been a last-minute inspiration: Mary had been against it, saying it would look stupid for him to be standing up there filming, but Sherlock had overruled her with some reassurances about multiple angles for the wedding tape, and it had shut her up. She didn’t have to know that Sherlock’s footage would never go near the wedding tape being filmed by the professional videographer down in the aisle. She would never see Sherlock’s shots, nor did she need to know why he was so desperate to get them.
“No,” Sherlock shrugged, without any pang in his chest as he said it. “But that’s the thing about romances – people only get together at the very end.”
Sherlock grabbed his shoulders to steady him.
“Why?” Mycroft asked. His voice betrayed just the barest amount of suspicion. “Did you want him, specifically?”
“Marry me, Sherlock. Let’s do it.” John could feel his eyes softening, even as his face lit up brighter than before. He cradled Sherlock’s nape in one hand, threading those beloved curls through his fingers. “I think it’s time, don’t you?”
job to dance with everyone, isn’t it?”
“Ah, sorry,” John said, pulling back his shoulder that the man had run into.
There was none; Sherlock’s eyes were deep and genuine, and he was looking down at John like he was really seeing him, and understanding everything there was to understand.
“…finally caught him going over Southwark bridge.” Lestrade finished his story with just a hint of pride in his voice. “He was easy enough to find – you wouldn’t have liked it, Sherlock – but he gave us a hell of a chase.”
“Don’t do that,” he nearly whispered. “Please.”
He swallowed, with great difficulty, then walked up to the door and rang the bell.
“I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door.”
John flashed a final grinning look over his shoulder as he closed the door behind him.
He went on, and Dad listened, smiling faintly all the time.
to see. Sherlock found himself looking all around their room, and his eyes were landing on the pictures scattered about. Their wedding photo, mounted on the wall beside the wardrobe. The looked so happy there, both ignoring the cameraman completely, so they could gaze at each other. On the dresser beside the CD player, a photo of them from last summer, on a beach in the south of France. On John’s bedside table, a more recent photo, of Sherlock beaming while John planted a kiss on his temple. That one had just been spontaneous, while they were sitting together on a park bench when out for a walk one day, but John had liked it so much he’d printed it off and framed it.
this job while he was trying to wrestle his way through Uni was bad enough, but what was even the point if he couldn’t at least use the chance to meet girls?
“Yeah.” John quirked his eyebrow up, almost imploringly. “Just an easy one, something without running?”
“Y-yeah.”
John was frantically pulling drawers open, searching – nothing seemed to be where he’d left it last night, his gloves, his keys, his wallet…
Sherlock gave her an indulgent smirk. “Yes.”
“You turned out to be the fucking love of my life,” Sherlock finished, softly.
John's smile stretched wider; he tried his best not to twist it into a grimace. "I've been better." The pain in his side was now radiating up through his chest.
John gave a little contented sigh and adjusted his grip on the book so he could bring one hand down to press against Sherlock’s back. Sherlock knew that soon he would start drawing little patterns there, on his bare skin – little spontaneous designs or words that came to him as he got lost in his book. And that when he fell asleep, that hand would circle down to rest on his hips, to draw Sherlock closer, even during unconsciousness.
For once, Sherlock didn’t have it in him to be annoyed.
“Sherlock.” The assistant director was making his way over to them. “Could you take your shirt off this time? Lighting and camera need to know when we’re going to see the nipples, and when we’re not.”
9. “I’m so sorry!”
“Well, we hope so,” was his answer.
“I should have told her every day,” Dad muttered. “Because she was
John’s tone told Sherlock everything he needed to know.
He pushes himself off the ground, arms flailing for air.
His eyes flickered back up to Sherlock, his gaze carrying no small amount of heat behind his reserved expression. Sherlock swallowed, knowing full well that John was having just as much difficulty holding back as he was. He tried once more to look apologetic – God knows this isn’t how he had pictured their reunion – but John gave him a soft smile, to show he understood.
“You don’t have to do this alone, Sherlock.” John laced his fingers with Sherlock’s, breathing him in deeply. “I’m here. I’m still here. I’m here, love, I’m not going anywhere, don’t you see? I’m here, right here, and I still need you, Sherlock, please…”
Sherlock leaned over and switched off the radio, then collapsed lengthwise onto the bed.
The sun streaming in through the windows switches off.
Sherlock gasped out something between bewilderment and hope, and the corners of his mouth twitched, not yet daring. “Do you mean it?"
“Just go – and
But then, just as suddenly, John let go of the note and spun to the side to point at the drummer.
“Well,
“Um –” Sherlock said, and froze. He was acutely aware of all of them looking at him.
They kissed, hard with want, but slow, and tender. John splayed a hand across Sherlock’s back, holding on tight, as tight as he could.
“There was for you,” Sherlock went on. He knew
“You’ll do fine,” Sherlock beamed back at him. “It’s all bollocks, really.”
“Hey, gorgeous,” Carol-Anne said, quiet and low.
She gave a little nod, but her face didn’t change.
A dreadful weight settled in Sherlock’s stomach as he looked desperately at the men and women around him. At least ten of them in the immediate vicinity, all of them armed, and all bound by law to put a stop to any homosexual activity they witnessed. They’d been gracious (or perhaps simply put off) enough thus far to leave Sherlock in relative peace while he worked, but there was no doubt in Sherlock’s mind that nothing could make them turn on him more quickly than to see him embrace another man in the middle of their station.
“And I – just sort of panicked, I guess,” John said with a little shrug. His gaze still hadn’t left Sherlock’s, less desperate now, and more – hopeful?
“I guess I will,” she said, looping it around him, and John burst out into laughter that seemed to stretch his face out wide. He must not have done that in a while.
“Is it just Mum, or…is it something else?”
John looked at up him.
Sherlock gave a humorless smile, and nodded. “A few years ago.” He paused, his mouth wavering a bit before he said, “Not for drinking.”
“I need to go back to the airport,” he said in a rush.
“I know just what you mean,” Molly chimed in. She sipped at her coffee and grimaced at the lukewarm temperature, but didn’t complain. “You should have seen Charlie when Emma had the flu last year. Absolutely inconsolable.”
“And, uh…”
“Thanks.” Sam turned back to John. “Let’s go.”
And there’s a joy in his half-drowned face that makes Sherlock stop shivering as a half-laugh, half-sob bursts from his throat.
The four of them cried out as one with relief.
“I’ll be right back,” he heard Sherlock whisper sweetly against his skin, leaving a soft kiss in it’s wake, and for a moment it occurred to John not to let him go, to cling onto him till morning and damn the mess, but he dismissed the thought at the feeling of Sherlock’s gentle smile against his cheek – Sherlock knew best when it came to what John needed right now, after all. He trailed a hand down Sherlock’s arm as he gathered himself up and out of the bed, and closed his eyes, letting the sounds of him hunting for a flannel and running it under the tap trickle into his ears like a warm, babbling stream.
He slid open the door, hurried forward, and vaulted over the railing beside the desk.
Sherlock gave a weak smile. “Goodnight.”
powerful.
“You were brilliant back there,” John said softly, his eyes sparkling with unrestrained fondness. He looked prouder of him than Sherlock could have thought possible, and he accordingly felt heat rise in his cheeks.
Dazed, Sherlock made his way around his desk and lowered himself into his chair. Slowly, in his fog-filled mind, things were starting to take shape.
They kept talking, of course – they had taken up their task infallibly, for which Sherlock was grateful. The conversation rolled around to work, Lestrade trying to entice Sherlock’s interest by bringing up some cold cases he’d been looking at, but Sherlock found he could pay less and less attention the longer they went on. Sitting still had become impossible, so he’d leapt up to stride up and down the small line of chairs while alternating running his agitated hands through his hair and folding them in front of his face as he tried, and all but failed, to think.
Sherlock let out a ragged gasp, and opened his eyes to look up at John.
John closed his eyes in frustration, and Sherlock sighed irritably.
he shouted, punching the air.
Sherlock was kneeling in front of him, grinning as he began to gently peel away the bandage. “I think what you were imagining would be ill-advised given your current health.”
Magnussen sat down, and poured himself a glass of the amber liquid.
“Yeah, well.” Sherlock looked back down at his knees, his back hunched. “She’d have liked John, though. It’s not his fault.”
“Hey, Sam,” Sherlock smiled down at him. “You played really well tonight.”
“Any chance you’d like to explain to me why your suspect was just picked up by police on the Strand, bleeding from a gunshot wound to the side?” The terse, sarcastic smile was evident in his brother’s voice even through the phone.
The curtain had opened, and they were in the centre of the stage.
A low sigh escaped Sherlock’s lips as he leaned in to kiss John again. Desperate, tender and slow, he pressed in with the softest of movements, angling his face gently as John invited him in. Quiet breaths mingled with the smooth glide of his lips, his lashes brushing along John’s cheek, his tongue warm and wet as it explored, feeling him, tasting him.
missing the point. What if something happens to you here and you can’t get to the doctor in time?”
“By the way, I feel bad,” came Sam’s voice again. It was a bit louder now, and more focused. “I never ask you how
Sherlock nodded once, quickly, and kissed him deeply once more, his thumb brushing one more time down his cheek as his other hand gave his cock one last deliberate stroke. John relaxed his grip on Sherlock’s back reluctantly to let him reach for the bedside drawer and fumble for the bottle of lube, his neck and chest flushed a sinful shade of pink and his plump lips fallen open, breathing evenly, heavily.
The phone buzzed again, screaming out and shattering the quiet.
“Eu peco imenso desculpo!” Sherlock shouted.
Sherlock gave a breathless chuckle, and a little shrug of one shoulder.
He raised a timid hand to silence Sherlock, who bit back what he’d been about to say with a sigh.
He tossed that one aside. The next one was one of those Victorian scenes of a snow-covered street and an old post office, or something. The sender hadn’t written anything inside but a signature.
“Greg, sir.”
“Well, that was…an interesting day,” Sherlock said, once the two of them had retired to the sitting room just down the hall from his office.
of how incredibly much Sherlock loved him, and in how completely and unequivocally John returned that favour.
didn’t want to make Sherlock deal with her; they got on well enough, but Harry’s often manic intensity made Sherlock anxious even at the best of times.
There was an impish grin on his face; clearly he was bursting to tell him what had just happened with Joanna.
“Is it thrilling, going after criminals like that?” She asked, her eyes brightening. “I bet it’s wonderful.” John just shrugged at this, so she pressed on. “Chases along the river, hunting people down in places full of…dark corners. For doing…dark deeds…”
“You’ll come back a broken man,” he said from the sitting room table, barely glancing up from his newspaper.
John smiled quietly back at him. He twisted a loose curl around his forefinger. “I’m just glad we’ve been lucky so far.” He huffed out a small laugh, imagining. “That it’s been healing alright, and it hasn’t gotten infected or anything. God knows you didn’t sign up to clean pus out of me every morning.”
John trailed off, his breath coming in shallow gasps, and it was all
“What’s wrong with
“Unfortunately,” she said, stepping to his side. “He doesn’t speak French. Just like you.”
Sherlock gave a little chuckle, as he balanced a third mug on top of two others.
A sudden creaking noise on his left made him start, and he snapped out of his reverie. It was Sarah; she had perched herself on the edge of his desk, and had her arms folded across her chest.
He flew down the stairs and out onto the street, his coat billowing out behind him.
,” John said again, and now he was stepping forward quickly to close the gap between them.
The smiling blue eyes vanish into the darkness.
“Ten seconds,” John repeated, and he gave Sherlock’s hand a little squeeze for good measure.
She turned on her heel and walked away without another word.
All your comments are very much appreciated :)
Sherlock stood up, and the audience roared louder than ever before. He stepped in front of Jonathan’s desk, obscuring the camera’s view, and mimed unbuckling his trousers.
Sherlock cocked his head. “That they probably don’t have a violin part in the band?”
“John, please, stay awake.” His skin was cold. “Just a few minutes more – they’re coming, please…”
“How are the children?” he asked, dimly.
John didn’t understand a word, but he recognized its tone as a lighthearted jab. He smirked back, shaking his head slowly as he hurried along through the traffic.
The door of number fifty-six swung open to reveal, seemingly, no one, until Sherlock looked down and saw three young children, probably no older than eight.
“Alright,” John said after a moment, clearly at just as much of a loss. “Come in, then.”
“Yeah? Not counting on her and Di to be exciting hosts?”
She gave him a little smile in return, and laid a brief hand on his shoulder as she passed. It was a gesture he wouldn’t have allowed from anyone else, but Mrs. Hudson just seemed to have the intuition for things like that. It was nice, sort of.
“Não vá comendo tudo você mesmo, você está ficando cada vez maior a cada dia,” he said.
He shoved the thought away before it had a chance to form and adjusted the camera again.
But then, even so, even in this total isolation…it was better than having Mary here with him.
“Lift up for me, sweetheart,” he murmured against his skin, and Sherlock obeyed, reaching down to help John with his belt and pull it free. John kissed at his navel once more, then in one fluid motion shucked down Sherlock’s trousers and tossed them aside.
Sherlock stared after him. He wondered for a moment if it had really happened, but the slip of paper was solid in his hands, and his cheek was still burning where John had kissed him.
“Your hands are magic,” John murmured, fondly.
don’t give him any ideas.”
“Yeah.” John nodded. He felt the grounds of this argument settle a bit more solidly under his feet. “I probably need to go for girls who are cooler, you know.” He straightened up defiantly, looking Sherlock up and down. “Game for a laugh. Like American girls!”
It disarmed John slightly, left him reeling for words.
“Right, good. Good,” said Dad. “And, what does…” he hesitated a moment, “…she…?”
“No star can do that.” John’s eyes followed where Sherlock was pointing, upwards and vaguely to the right.
Piercing blue, and fixed on him. Indecipherable.
“No, I’m wise,” John grinned. He leaned back against the seat, his arms behind his head. “Stateside, I’m Prince Harry – without the weird family.”
All throughout this whole mess, Sherlock had been amazing. He’d been looking after John as if it were second nature – making he sure he took his meds, checking his stitches every morning, making teas and dinners and ensuring he kept his strength up. Most of the time John never even had to ask for what he needed, because Sherlock had already worked it out and taken care of it before John was even aware of what it was. He hadn’t let John worry about anything, sorting out everything for him back at the hospital, and John had been able to relax into his recovery more effectively than he’d ever done before, letting Sherlock’s gentle hands and loving concern wash over him, heal him. Letting Sherlock be, as he always was, John’s beacon of light, guiding him to safety. Guiding him home.
“You’ve seen the films, kiddo,” he said, something low and fierce in his words now. “It ain’t over till it’s over!”
