“A sometimes fatal oversight,” he continued.  “The information is useful in forensics as well.  It can provide a valuable clue to identity.”
Heat streamed out of me and cold streamed into me.  Melted snow trickled down my chest.
My eyes darted from side to side beneath my lids.
That one would leave a very distinctive imprint.
“Oh, they all know who you are, John.  That’s why they’d like to know your names.”
Delighting when she wakes.”
“They've got a clutch, across the canal,” Sherlock said.  “He’s been brooding.”  He picked up a dish from the workbench and held it out to the dragon.
“I thought I heard you talking in here,” Mrs Hudson said, setting down a tea tray on the desk.
Was he humouring me or had he offhandedly acknowledged the impossible?
I glanced at the sofa and drew in a quick breath.  Since I had last cast my eye that way, Sherlock had freed his right arm from his robe and rolled the sleeve of his vest up to his shoulder.  I hadn’t noticed him move and my peripheral vision is very good, but, as I have remarked before, he is stealthy and proud of it.  He appeared to still be reading from the medical journal.
Sherlock spoke, his voice deeper than his usual conversational tone.  His Latin was too fast for me, but I caught the words for cart, fish, feast and fort.
Half-way up the stairs, John heard a violin, plaintive and seemingly far away.  His feet slowed; he rose on tip-toe, hesitated outside the door.  It was ajar.
Within his embrace, I turned towards him.  “The night seemed very long without you,” I whispered.  “You didn’t even leave the lab door ajar.”
“Thousands of ordinary insects, yes.”  His fingers trailed down my sides, around to my spine.  “But they’re larger and stronger than most of the dragonflies you’ve seen…I imagine.”  He leaned away to look at my eyes.  “Never totally sure what you see, John Watson.”
I glanced at my thumb.  The cut was already gone.  “Ta,” I said and wiggled it at him.
“No honour among the malevolent, John.”
“I can come back in the morning,” I called.
“A walk on the roof for some fresh air?” Sherlock asked.
The insect’s wings faded to a translucent film.  It dipped its head once more.
I pressed my lips together and turned towards the hearth.  I was moving further and further from recommended approaches to job interviews.  The log I had added to the fire cracked, flames shooting up between the halves.  It seemed fitting.
Mrs Hudson shook her head.  “No, this room likes you.  Has from the start.  You should do your brewing here.”
“Thank you, Mike,” John said as he thumped up the stairs, “and your cherubic bedside manner.”  John doubted there were many doctors who had patients dropping off fairy cakes months after their last appointment.
“Ones that have been tested,” he answered, nodding.  “Judging by the different degrees of fading, tested repeatedly over decades, although not recently."
When I caught up with him, he was rapping on a low door.  A faint orange glow showed at the edges of a small, oilskin-covered window next to it.
A glint of white streaked across the sky, a fleck of fallen moonbeam.
“It may be a stretch for my French.” I smiled.  I did enjoy when Holmes held forth on any of the widely-ranging areas of his expertise, and I enjoyed listening to his French, which he appeared to speak without any trace of an English accent, in marked contrast to my own utterances.
I glanced at the others.  Wiggins was snapping twigs off a long branch.  Charlie and Archie were having a quiet conversation.  Bert was nearing the fire, Kit in tow with an armful of dead underbrush, Midnight trotting ahead of them both.
How vividly I remembered the disorienting feel of it!
I opened my eyes, tilted my head up.
“It is,” I agreed and mixed the last of the peas with the final bit of potato on my fork.
He was intent.
I added milk to my tea.  “Sherlock claims neighbours are better sources of information than security cameras.  They’re probably better than the internet as well.”
“Good morning, dears,” Mrs Hudson said, as she strolled into the sitting room.  “You got a parcel this morning.”  She set the package on the desk next to my laptop, then collected the plate that had held the lemon and poppy seed cake.  “I see this was satisfactory.”
“Maybe I shouldn’t have watched it,” John whispered.  He licked his thumb and forefinger and extinguished the flame.
“Shall I ring for more roast or would you prefer to breakfast?” Holmes asked.
She laughed at that.  “It would.  Have you ever had a liqueur called Singeverga?”
I unstrung the bow, balanced it across a stool, collected the harp and followed.
“Why?”
He let out a long, slow breath, clasped me about the waist and slid down the wall with me.
Corvus looked up, shoulders hunched, lips pressed tightly together.
Holmes studied the signatures at the end of the document and passed the papers to me.
"Row," Sherlock said.
He nodded again.  “And one down in Kew.”
I took aim.  Perhaps I could wound her.
“Sit,” he said.  “There are a number of these.”
There was a click, the slightest creak of a hinge, and faint light filled a doorway ahead of me.  The gloom about me lessened.  My eyes darted in all directions, hungry for the information they had been denied.
I squinted at the fire.
“The mention of medical symptoms has engaged you,” Holmes commented when I paused.
“Stating the obvious again, Mycroft?  Tsk, tsk,” Sherlock taunted from the nest of embroidered cushions on the divan upon which he reclined.  The blue silk of his sleeve slipped down his arm while he continued to wave as though conducting music only he could hear.  “Knowledge always trumps death.  He’s mine.”
“You really think I could?”
“With somewhat different words, yes.”
“Sensible fellow,” John added.
“We have many secrets here,” he said.  “That can be one more.  I’ll order ammunition for a SIG-Sauer P226R.”
John darted after him.  “Similar to when she was at Baker Street.  I heard papers rustling and things being moved about.  Sounded like she was tidying up.”
“I’ll get a table from the sitting room,” I said.  He had already moved the chair from next the wardrobe to the foot of the bed.  I wasn’t sure that was the perspective I wanted to start with.  “Need anything?”
“Here we are,” Mrs Hudson sang out from the ginger-scented cloud surrounding her.  She set the plate in the middle of the table, maybe a little nearer Sherlock than me, and resumed her seat.  “I didn’t tell you her cousin’s theory.”  She turned to Sherlock.  “Eat a biscuit, dear.  You’ll need strength for this one.”
“There may be some locations you would like to share with me in the vicinity,” Holmes added.
It is a lovely foot, though often cold.
I took another breath and blew it out softly.
“Choose another.”
The hint of a smile flickered across his lips.  “It’s close to moonrise."
“Lie down in lavender, John.”
He had been sad when his parents flew away, but excited about being found by a mate.  He had patrolled his territory assiduously, eaten plentifully, preened carefully and kept a hopeful eye on the sky.
His fingers tangled in my hair, across my brow, above my ears.  “There,” he murmured and dropped his hands to my shoulders.
I switched off the bedside lamp as Sherlock opened the door.  Inky darkness greeted us.  Sherlock strode into it.
John figured Sherlock was counting the red blood cells in her bone marrow by that point.
“Where are you?” John shouted at the mound of ashes.
“I thought you liked being warm,” he whispered above my flushed skin.  His lips glided, cool and smooth, to my throat.
A couple napkins floated off the buffet table, swirling in the confluence of Spring and Summer breezes in the middle of the room.
Behind the flap in the cover, there was a packet with one reed left in it and a soiled flannel.  John went to get a glass of water for the reed and an old vest to polish the wood.  He dropped the green flannel in the bin.
The chamber was rectangular, with the table ledge running along most of the wall opposite, matched by the lower ledge on which I sat, which was cut in half by the door to the hall.  Both the table and the benches ended short of the large fireplaces that filled the narrow walls.
The dances became more complex, our feet tracing patterns within patterns.  I began to see them on the floor, like the trails of snails across a garden path glimmering in the candlelight.  Dance followed dance and our traces grew more distinct, tinted with colours that blended where our footsteps crossed; bisecting the pale trails of others like so much paint on a tarmac.
“Gabriel’s doing the front doors for some restaurant in Manhattan, I think he said it was.  I don’t have the details for Anji’s, except that it’s in Italy.  Anyway, Gabriel’s looking forward to meeting you tomorrow.  You can join us for lunch, I hope?” Mrs Hudson finished.
I looked at Mrs Hudson, who was still wearing simply her dress and a cardigan.  “Aren’t you coming?”
“Yes, if you’re making more,” I replied, bringing my mug into the kitchen.
“I would dance with no other.”
“I don’t imagine you’ll mind being shut in until I return with the others for the service?”
"Well found, John," Sherlock said and nodded.
“My goodness, you’re not allergic to it, are you?” she asked.
I didn’t cry before, but, you know, it would be all right if I did.
“It’s as simple as that?”
“Then you could not have known that the interrogator’s wife was shagging the coffin-maker at the very time you were telling your interrogator about it,” John concluded.
He hooked a finger in the collar of my vest.
I stared into the trees for a sign of rambling roses, but it was too dark to see beyond the torchlight.
There she lay, in silver and black pieces, clasped by the black velvet.  He traced the threadbare edges of the indentations where the white backing was showing through the nap, eased the bell out of its niche.
Holmes relieved him of the hat and set it on the side table by his own chair.  “Tea, then,” Holmes said, “as your correspondence suggests that what you have to add to the written portion of your tale may take a while to relate.”
I moved to the door and pulled the bell.  Mrs Hudson, from long practice, would understand from it what we required.  I lingered there, regarding Corvus as he looked up at Holmes as a man overboard might gaze upon a face peering down at him from the safety of the deck with a coil of rope in his hand.
All I saw was him.
Enough for a start, I suppose.
“You were fascinated with the stories of the Manor.”
“Right, okay,” he replied and pressed his lips into a thin, closed line.
"Oh," I said and with a grin went to see into how many parts they had divided the creature and to make sure that none of them were still moving.
“You have strong blood," he mused.
Water poured onto our fire.  It seethed and smoked until handfuls of dirt quieted it.
“…as good an archer as you.”
Excerpt: Sherlock stood in shirtsleeves before the grand piano in the corner, swaying as he played his violin, his back to me. Sunlight slanted through the southern windows, throwing blues and violets over him, greens and golds at his feet.
Possibly not.
Once caffeinated and dressed, I took my harp with me to the library.  Midway down the stairs, the lights winked out.  I did not grab the bannister; I checked the skylight.  The luminous grey of a London night shone through it.
“We shouldn’t be so close,” he said as he stood and stepped back, his face still hidden by his hood.  “You’re warming it again.”
Don’t rule them out.
“You were up on the roof?” I asked, kneeling next to him.
He looked back, taking in the faint smile on the lips, the small creases between the eyebrows.
I thought to encourage him to continue by doing the same.  My stratagem worked.
He looked at me, scowling for a moment then nodded.  "We'll go with your instinct on that, then."
“It’s a warning,” Sherlock explained.  “To scare off interlopers in their territory.”
John dragged his fingertips over Sherlock’s hips, pausing to stroke the tops of Sherlock’s thighs and edge his thumbs into the crease of his groin.
The bookcase unlocked.  My harp, in its case, was slung behind me.  I slipped into the darkness, left shoulder to the wall as had become my habit, my right hand on the hilt of the dagger Sherlock had given me after our first fencing lesson.
"There was a conservation seminar a month ago.  Swann made one of the presentations.  It's likely he stole someone's ID card, someone about to go on holiday, I would imagine, but really, I have to leave something for the Met to do."
"What river creatures have teeth like that?" Sherlock asked, gesturing towards the leg.
His eyes flicked down to where our hands were clasped, then he turned towards the woods and pulled me along, through the grass and flowers, and on under the trees.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh?”
Ms Swann tilts her head.  “It doesn’t feel like her though, and there are no others on stage, no guests at the ball, no Rothbart, no scenery either, only fog coming from all sides.”  She laughed a little.  “That would make it hard for an audience to see…and, it is silent.”
The appetites they feed; but she makes hungry
I gripped the armrests.  Possibly, I didn’t breathe until he plucked the last note.
“Therefore, with the counsel of Crown Prince Mycroft, we have created a title for you that no one has ever had before and instead of your carrying a sword and maintaining a staid appearance at court, it requires that you wear this as a mark of your station,” Oberon explained and held out his hand to Mycroft.
Mrs Hudson set it by and picked up the last pot.  It was made of clay.
“What makes you say that?” I asked.
“Oh, John, I’m glad you’re home,” Mrs Hudson said, coming out her door, a wave of ginger and cinnamon following her.  “Have you told many people that you’ve moved back?”
“Thank you,” Sherlock said.
I suppose.  I never had to go hunting; they always seemed to come to me.
I inhaled slowly.
“You remember Isa Whitney, from the opium den?” I ventured and drew in a breath.
I turned my head.  “What about the willow?”
“I prefer to be sure,” Mycroft replied.
The leaves about my head rustled.
Calendars have become less relevant to me than they were in the past.  I have undertaken journeys with destinations that have been when as much as where.  I have seen a hydra with my own eyes and helped to slay it so that neither of us lost any flesh to the beast.  I do not think the date upon which we slew it mattered, but there might be a significance to the time of death I did not yet understand.
“Oh, I knew you would, too,” Molly said.
His nails skimmed along my hips.
Even in my distracted state, I had snatched my medical kit from the floor and once upon the bed with him had raised each leg in turn and dabbed an antiseptic of Holmes’ own concoction on every scratch.  Oh, how close some had come to dealing him a truly uncomfortable injury.  I had bent down and pressed my lips to those, the tincture tingling on my lips, and by the time I had finished, my respiration had been too rapid to be described as sighing.  Holmes had smiled as I capped the disinfectant and set it aside, his fingers uncurling on the sun-warmed covers like blossoms.  I had kissed the juncture of each finger and when his legs had eased further apart, I had kissed there, too, the sun hot upon my back.
I took a deep breath.
Couldn’t he have joined the Fucker at the bottom of the river?  Maybe snake boy, too?
“The lecture went well I see,” he said.  “A couple fans of your blog in the class, too.”
I turned my gaze in the direction of his voice, not even attempting to disguise my curiosity.
I squeezed Sherlock’s hand.
Sherlock straightened up and turned around.
“How the creatures of the earth do love one another,” he murmured and drew his hand back, “but the fire loves them, too.”
“And the interrogator wore a wedding ring?” John continued.
He went in.
“What…” I almost doubted my ears.  “What shall I play?” I asked, deciding I had heard aright.
“So do you think it’ll work out?” he asked.
“No! No.  She’s new at the surgery.  The night I came by here, she’d stopped by my flat.  Got one of my neighbours to let her into the building and tried inviting herself in for a drink.  I took her out for one instead,” John explained.  “I’d been watching the video Greg left.  It was still on the screen.”
“Yeah.”
of the same name.  (The screen looks blank at the beginning of the video, but that's how it's supposed to be for several seconds.)
“Oh, yes,” I said.  Melancholic music might not be my preference, but listening to Holmes play any piece was something I considered a privilege.  “Long trek down to London to bury their dead.”
A nutritional review seemed in order then, probably with Mrs Hudson.  I took the envelope and sat at the table.  “Thank you for the tea this morning.  That was a lovely surprise,” I said as she uncovered dishes.
I scowled as I walked to the wardrobe and pulled out a jacket with a fleece collar.
I thought it was mistletoe, but it was completely the wrong season for them.
I sniffed.  I could smell the resin.  I touched the tip of the branch.  It was wound about with course cloth.  I took my hand away and hummed.
“What’s your guess for the lead article in this one?” he asked from over my head.
“Tell Sherlock John’s up,” Mrs Hudson said to the bird as she returned to the desk.  She held out a tiny bowl.
I leaned towards it.
“Nice place,” John said as they slipped onto the cushioned bench.
I sat on the sofa. “You made it already!”
The hearth was cold.  Scattered over the pyramid of logs were the charred remnants of matches that had blown out, twists of paper that had turned to ash without producing a flame.
Sherlock hummed as he trailed long, cool fingers across my chest and tucked them under my back on the far side of me.
“Right,” I said.
Sherlock shook his head.
“Well, Prince has wings.”
And the other one.
“Odile,” Sherlock suggested.
A few flowers were opening here and there among the leaves near where we were standing.
“I see.”  John shook his head over Sherlock’s back, drops of water spangled the smooth expanse.  He rubbed the towel through them and down between Sherlock’s legs.
Bunches of dried leaves and flowers dangled from the dark timbers that criss-crossed it high above my head.  Whatever was between the beams was lighter than the walls and shards of something that reflected the light were embedded in it, too.  I hoped none of it would be raining down on us.
"Sherlock said one of his clients had asked him to handle their possible donation of the artifact to the museum as long as their condition of strict anonymity could be respected," she explained.
“He has such a beautiful voice,” Molly said.  “Mrs Hudson is teaching him well.”
I could feel the cold radiating off him.  “Frostbite?” I asked, feeling the tip of his nose and then his fingers.  “Tingling?”
I looked back over my shoulder.
When he turned round again, Mary was holding out the platter.  “I baked these this morning,” she said.  “Try one.”
“No, dear.  None of us would want that.”
I offered my right hand and an open cuff scored with the outlines of intricate knots slipped over my wrist.  Its pattern was the same as the designs on my harp.
“Sometimes an extra pair of eyes does the trick, you know.”
My throat constricted.  “But you stopped him in time,” I managed to whisper and didn’t dare make it a question.
Chewing appreciatively, I turned to examine the wall which formed the back of the bench on which I sat.  Here and there, the light from the candle flames reflected off something in it.  I ran my hand over the dark surface.  It was rough and dry.  I dusted off my hand and lifted the candle from the small table holding my dinner.  Not far from me, a rounded protuberance gleamed.  Holding the candle closer, I felt about the nodule.  It came away in my hand.
"I'm not, I'm holding onto whatever we harpooned out in the river," Sherlock said.
“And now do you wish to leave?” he asked.  “You will have fine tales to dine out on.”
“The stitchers’ buzzing hurts my ears it is so high-pitched,” Wiggins complained, touching one ear.  “What hides behind and peeks through is done.  Now they are finishing the vines that conceal.”
Mycroft stood before the closing panel to the passageway, sleek in black.  He wore a suit, but the coat was long and the snowy collar high.
Many’s the night I’ve slept across Sherlock to chase the chill out of him.
The carthorse pawed at the earth; the harness jingled.  Sherlock made a soft, hushing sound to the animal and it quieted.
I gazed around us.  All across the clearing, fires were being extinguished, blankets folded, belongings stowed.
Sherlock turned and I turned with him as the windows were being opened by liveried servants I could not identify from where I stood.  I knew who was directing them, however.  Gesturing as though he were conducting an orchestra, Wiggins stood underneath the gallery sending subordinates here and there with silent signals.  Glass doors were secured against the embrasures.  Small wooden steps were drawn up to the window seats, the cushions rolled up and carried away.  When the to-ing and fro-ing subsided, a view was revealed that fit nothing I had seen from pavement or roof or on any foray in the Manor’s grounds.
“The child in his mother’s lap,” I replied.  “He isn’t dressed warmly enough for being outside.”
I left the bath with an expectation of tea and I was not disappointed.  Accompanying it were several pieces of lemon shortbread and a dish of peeled blood orange sections.  My appetite reared its head at the first whiff of them and there was nothing but rosy juice left on the plate by the time I poured myself a second cup of tea.
“Fairy flowers,” she said, “but you don’t have any among the ingredients for this.”
“My song?”
I wondered when the contents of the carton had become a case.
Maybe it was his affirmation of danger, or the adrenalin it summoned, but I stopped thinking of my feet as separate things, of myself as a separate being.  It was the two of us against everyone else.  I pictured the pattern of the dance steps as a sigil glowing on the floor.  As Sherlock glided along its knotted contours, I breathed in his fragrance and followed.
“Unaided, no,” Sherlock answered.  “Want to change your mind?”
The last reverberations of the strings faded to silence.  The splatter of rain against the windows panes took their place.  A streak of white flashed between the incompletely closed curtains.  Thunder followed close behind.
“Best not to commit crimes with family heirlooms,” he had observed.
Sherlock pivoted from the window, bow suspended above the strings of his violin, when John announced their visitor.
A horn cried for it.
I gazed at the wood.  It was a very big branch, but I shook my head.  “No, I think I should do, but thank you for offering.”
“The building over the tube station,” Sherlock replied, spooning sugar into his cup.
I craned my neck to see the writing above her name.  “Her mother only died a year ago.  Seventy-three.”  I stood and dusted off one knee.  “She wasn’t young when they were born.”
“This will be sunnier, for the most part.  There will be fresh air and exercise.  You like those things.”
Oberon waited to raise the lid of the box until she was near.  He and Mycroft stood as she approached.  Oberon kissed her hand and Mycroft her cheek.  Puck turned a backward somersault and handed her a clover he had plucked from the grass.  He returned his chin to the table.  Titania passed the clover to her lady-in-waiting and waved her attendants away.
I turned aside for modesty’s sake and found the next window nearly as unsettling.  Its nude played pipes in a glade, his furry legs and hooves tucked against the fallen tree trunk upon which he sat.  Above and behind him brilliant flowers and fruit teemed amidst shadowy foliage, while the piper was awash in sunshine, his tawny hair and fur glittering with streaks of golden and silvery glass.  The set of his shoulders, the tilt of his head were images I have often seen in my mirror.
John felt the sting.  It brought no urge to brush the moth away.  He watched as the creature flushed, saw the veins in its wings begin to fill with red.  It withdrew its stinger and flew to the ceiling.
A high, plucked note sounded on a violin, followed by another and another.
“Two hours.  The moon’s risen,” he said.  “Drink and you can sleep for a few more, if you like.”
“I thought they’d been wiped out.”
“The more delicate specimens are in the conservatories and some of the frost-hardy ones that need more sun are up in the roof gardens,” he added.
“Mostly.  Now and then there’d be a song I really liked and I’d play it over and over, faster, slower, with a little improvisation, until Harry would threaten to kill me.”
“Please,” Holmes said, with an open gesture of his hand towards the refreshments at Mr Corvus’ side.
Mine were in their pouch, banging gently against my chest as we walked.
I put the papers down in my lap and scowled.  “Could a storm do that to a stone building?” I asked, “even one in disrepair?”  I patted the papers on my knee.  “Do you think someone helped things along with a well-placed explosive?”
“There’s no way the man approached the balcony from the west somehow and we missed that?”  John clicked back and forth between the several images from the middle of the sequence.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Possibly even to an exemplary standard,” he added.
I grabbed the shoes and bag and followed.
Well I might laugh at myself.  His absence was an opportunity.  It just did not feel like one.
I could hear the excitement in his voice.
In front of the door to the firing range, I stopped and listened.  I heard a faint thud and then another, but no report.  I considered knocking, but the echo it would set up in the tunnels deterred me.  The light flickered.  I glanced at the sconce by the door and saw that it held a thick candle, whose flame was moving with the current of air. The lamps in this section had been electric the last time I’d been down, like the ones Kit had been decorating.  I looked closer at the garland of ivy below the black iron and realised that it was growing down the wall.  I gave the vine a gentle tug and felt how firmly its vine was clinging to the brick.
Inside the lobby of the Globe, lights had come on and a guard was approaching the glass doors with a phone to his ear and a key in his hand.
I’m early, remember?
Definitely.
“Well, that doesn’t illuminate much.  He’d still have had to bring the carton and its old newspapers from somewhere else,” Sherlock said.
He laughed around my cock and my temperature took a turn in the wrong direction.
They were long, nearly featherless and sturdy like an ostrich’s legs, but the talons that were scraping against the stone were at the tips of wide, webbed feet.
Sherlock stopped his spinning, looked intently at the opalescent rocks on my palm and then at my face.
Corvus stood as well.  “I am staying at their house in London, Lower Bramerley Manor.  Roderick mentioned annual sojourns in the City when we were at school.  More recently, I understand only Madeline came, although it has been nearly a year since her last visit.  Whatever might be of use to you there is at your disposal.”  He paused.  “I am told there are also a number of buildings left on the Usher estate, a dower house, stables, cottages and lodges for certain staff and the farmhouses of various tenants.  I did not see them when I was there.  Roderick and I did not go out.  I am informed that the dower house is comfortable, if you think a visit to Usher would assist your enquiries.”
Sherlock slouched down further, closer, closer to me.
I watched his pale fingers disappear into long, black fur as he scratched behind the beast’s ears.  Now that it was at rest, I could see that it was a huge dog, possibly a mastiff, but with a mane of thick hair and unsettling red eyes.
With a few syllables, he undid the elixir’s work.
“You’re better at it now,” Sherlock said.
The door buzzed.
That would be one way to describe them.
“Christmas morning and what?”
Instead, I saw it.  I stopped and turned, my eyes growing wide, wondering how I could have missed it earlier.  My arm slipped from Sherlock’s and I lunged back, swivelling around people as I went.
She looked that way, too.  “You think?”
I couldn’t help laughing.  “Fine, sign me up for that one, too, but I can’t guarantee we won’t be off on a case.”
The notes went higher.
Near the top of the stairs, in languages I didn’t know, Sherlock’s parents were bidding their guests a cordial good-night. Mycroft stood to one side, leaning against the balustrade, nodding at times in silent accord and gazing out over the crowd at others.  No one intruded on his apparent distraction by addressing him.  If he acknowledged them, they nodded to him in return; if he didn’t, they nodded to themselves and passed on.  I wondered for whom he was searching; who it was they all seemed to know needed to be found.
I opened a drawer and fished about for my fingerless gloves.
I gasped.
He had completely transformed.  His limbs stretched over John; wings with a greater span than a swan’s and feathers jewelled like a peacock’s tail curved around him.  Sherlock lifted his head.
John nodded and began on his peas.
“Well, the blisters are all gone and I don’t know what you’re making, so I can’t tell anyone.”
It turned in the lock.
“Fast results or you don’t play?” Sherlock asked.
“Which one?” I asked, looking down at the gold and hoping I wouldn’t pick the wrong one.
She tapped her forefinger against her lips.  “Who are you planning to poison, John?” she whispered.
Wet warmth trickled down my thighs.  He dragged his cock back and up between my buttocks, pressed it against the tender spot and spent his last against me there.
“I’ve had…you’ve been here for more than a year now.”
“So, what I suggest is that you get the fire going, move the coffee table over near it and assemble your ingredients and your instructions on it, and sit on the footstool to play your harp while your potion simmers.”
Baskerville rarely made the climb all the way to the bedrooms to find someone to take him for a walk.  “Ah, Mrs Hudson is off visiting with her neice today, isn’t she?”  I patted him on the head then threw the covers back.  “Have you been out there a while, boy?”
“Since I was a child,” I replied.
He hummed softly, his breath cool.
“Well, I was raving, wasn’t I?  About my dog being my best friend and ascribing all sorts of human traits to him as though I really believed he was a boy.  Oh, there was a psychologist, and then a psychiatrist, but by the time I saw him I realised I had to play their game and admit that I didn’t
Colour splashed across his skin, bright and uneven.  That was lovely, I thought as I drew my hand slowly away.  “That’s perfect,” I said, “stay like that for a while.”
“When we were older, our pirate games included going out in the rowboat to the small island in the river.  He wasn’t much for rowing, left that to me.”
I lay my head on his back, eyes closed, arms wrapped around his chest.  Every nerve in my body was clamouring for release and I willed them all to wait, to stay balanced on the sharp edge, thrumming with a pleasure that was almost pain.  I inhaled carefully.  Any movement and it was going to be the end and I didn’t want it to end.
The arm disappeared, then reappeared.  The swan rose up again, neck stretched to its fullest extent.
My eyebrows shot up, but I brought them down fast.  “Oh,” I said as neutrally as possible.
The lift came to a halt.
Not easy at all.
My eyes grew round.
“It sounds like a sword cutting through the air.”  Her left hand sliced through the air.  “That’s thought to be why mute swans don’t call to one another as they fly as other swans do, because they can hear the sound of each other’s wings.”
A long leg stretched towards my seat.  When the ankle was hooked over the far side, he pushed the rest of his lower body after it.
Jim’s blood reached the boundary Sherlock had made.  There, it bubbled and hissed, but went no further.
She cleared her throat.  “One of the geese gave me a good nip on the leg and I turned to chide him.  When I looked back the cool shadow was gone.”
I scowled and looked back at Sherlock.
Sleep slid away. I reached out towards the other, often empty, side of the bed.  My fingers found the cool curves of my bedfellow and I smiled.  My hand explored, gliding upwards.  I pressed my palm against the chill plane of his back.  Relief seeped up my arm.  I edged closer, the remnants of dreams still clinging to me.  I had been in the desert, searching for shade from the mid-day sun.  I lay my cheek against the snowy mound of Sherlock’s shoulder and sighed.
Under my chin, I felt the flick of a tongue, heard a hiss.  My torc uncoiled and skittered down my arm inside my sleeve.  It wriggled out at my cuff; stretched and sniffed and nipped at the limp dragon around Sherlock’s neck.  Then it reared back and bit my wrist.
High above us, a bird circled.
Baskerville lowered his head and prowled to the left.
“Right, yes.  Of course,” I replied and returned to the sofa.
“’But Beauty’s self he is, when all his clothes are gone,’” I recited.
A plate of Mrs Hudson’s ginger biscuits had materialised on the table.  I took one as I passed.  Sugar would help.
“I thought you rarely attended these things.”
“No,” Sherlock replied.  He leaned closer.  “Shall I give you a lock of my hair to keep, John?”
Sherlock glanced at John and got up, dusting off the knees of his trousers.  “Well, if that swan’s taken up residence at the Pond, it might be best to give it a wide berth.”
I leaned forward, squinting against the sparkle of the chandeliers.
Kit smiled at that and held his plate higher.  “Would you like some, sir?”
I smiled.  My hand dropped to my side.
John inhaled sharply.
The moon cast my shadow over Sherlock.  His silhouette seemed somewhat lower than mine.  The boat rocked.  I grabbed the gunwales and barely managed to keep my seat.  Around us, the water opened up, a vast reach of silver and black.  The oars splashed as we turned once more, moving fast.  The tide was coming in and I no longer faced the direction in which we were going.
John nodded, glasses still before his eyes.  “I await your rational explanation, Mr Holmes.”
aside and took up
Greg flashed his warrant card and motioned his search team forward.  “Start at the east end and keep me informed,” he said and followed Sherlock through the lobby and up the stairs.  The guard was jogging ahead to open the inner doors before Sherlock reached them.
A moment later, Sherlock emerged onto the gallery and silently glided behind Mrs Hudson.
There were bits of thread and wisps of cotton wool all over the desk when I finished with them, but in my palm lay a small brass key.
I nodded at that.
“John,” he said before pivoting on the balustrade and striding away along it to the side of the house.
“Clear as a bell,” I agreed.
“Sometimes that’s the right thing to do, sometimes it’s not.  Offer still stands,” Mrs Hudson said and smiled at him.
I covered his hand with mine, pressed it hard against my heart.
I held the willow close against my chest.  Made myself as streamlined as I could.
“Yes.”
It was such an incredible feeling and I already felt marvellous.  I closed my eyes to savour it until he took his mouth away.  He kissed the base of my thumb.
Sherlock continued staring.  “For a man of science, you have a very whimsical side.”
Sherlock had already resumed his seat upon the tree stump and was considering the substantial piece of raw meat on the skewer in his hand.  He took a bite and his teeth gleamed in the firelight.
Sherlock’s face was above me, the rest of him stretched out at my side.
I shook my head and wished I had not forgotten my mobile.
He stopped only a step away at a point equidistant between Sherlock and me, regarded me for several seconds, then focussed on Sherlock.  They stood, eyes locked on one another for half a minute or more and judging from the slight movements of their eyebrows, gave the impression that they were having a conversation without uttering a word.
“Don’t dress!”
“Blood on the harpoon and a few brittle hairs on my coat,” he said, “I put them in the freezer and I disinfected that,” he said, brushing his fingertips across my hand, which was still at his cheek.  He tugged at the covers and slipped his legs underneath them.
“It’s too late to go through all the details of your position tonight; we can do that tomorrow.  However, you should know that there is one crucial prerequisite to a successful completion of the probationary period…” he said and paused.
“Do you play?” Mr Holmes asked.
Chapter 9 prompts:  #5, #18 and #20 (Sweets, Shepherd and Gifts)
The music had stopped.  Ms Swann appeared on her balcony, several items in her arms.
He wasn’t haring off as he so often does, but ambling along the bank.  He’d set his cap upon his head.  Its wings half unfolded, then settled tight against his curls.
An arm waved him away and returned to its caressing.
Sherlock panted down at me, the flowery scent wafting off of him.
I might have been assenting to a dash behind enemy lines or a charge up a bramble-filled hill in the altogether.
Sherlock shook his head slowly.  “Nothing else,” he replied.
His fingers pushed beneath my collar, rubbing and squeezing the muscles at the top of my shoulders.  He was using both hands now.
I shivered.  “You did not compose that on a violin.”
“From beyond the veil?” Sherlock enquired.
Sherlock opened his eyes and peered at John.  “What gave you that idea?”
Culvert sputtered.  “No, no, no!  How can you be standing?”  He grimaced, then giggled.  “A Herculean effort, but surely you are about to keel over.  You must feel the weakness in your limbs.”  He leered at us.  “You feel it, don’t you?  Creeping up on you, drear and inescapable?  All your failures, your incompetence, every time you disappointed someone?”
I nodded to the boatman.
Rugby is played in firm contact with the ground.
The next hit broke the board in two.  It fell away and I saw there was another plank behind it.  He took up a black knife and held it in his palm as though checking its weight.
“I haven’t made an offer.”
I brushed against guests.  They moved back.
My stomach grumbled again.
All three of us turned towards her voice.
“Jean-Pierre thinks the syndicate might be involved in the maritime sphere as well,” Sherlock supplied.
I raised both my hands.  “What could I make of it?  The Morrows were thoroughly convinced they had their son’s body back and I couldn’t see how anyone could refute their conclusion.  And why would anyone want to?  It gave them some peace of mind to have the mortal remains of their child tucked into the parish graveyard along with his forebears.”
“Hurry, John.  I want to get there before the dawn.”
“I want to see,” Sherlock said, rolling off John’s shoulder and tucking his chin to stare into the darkness between them.
The ‘little’ might have rankled if he hadn’t been so much of a size with me, but the way he stroked down Sherlock’s sleeve as he finished his little speech, made me want to break his little be-ringed fingers – one by one.
And I felt his breath by my ear.
I crouched in front of him and looked up into his face.  His muscle tone was slack, his eyes barely open, his breathing shallow.  Shaded by his curls, I couldn’t judge his colour.  I seized him below his shoulders and brought him to a more upright position.  His skin looked grey.  Where my grip had tugged open the collar of his shirt, I saw his torc hanging down either side of his neck, its silver scales tarnished, its jewelled eyes closed.  A band of fear constricted around my heart.
We all heard the steady tap against the wooden floorboards.
Baskerville rubbed his head against the underside of her jaw and dropped his stick.
“Sherlock,” I said, choking.  I couldn’t find his pulse.  I tried to catch my breath.  I glared around the room.
“But surely he could have confided such a secret in you, his oldest friend,” I interjected.  From the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a hint of a smile on Holmes’ face.
She shook her head.  “I can’t believe I haven’t introduced you yet.  He runs Speedy’s.  He’s our tenant, you know.”
I stood over the box, one hand grasping the lid, whilst I caught my breath from taking the stairs two at a time.
John shook his head and held on more firmly.  “I accept your terms,” John said and the weight that lifted off him with that utterance made him wonder if he, too, might fly.  "I accept, Sherlock."  It felt better to repeat it.  "I accept."
I paused in my turning, thought I saw the place, but not what one must touch to open it, some shadow no doubt obscuring it.  There were wooden columns carved into the semblance of various young trees framing each panel of the wall.  Some braced cushioned benches between them.  Perhaps the door’s lever was hidden beneath a cushion or in the grain of a tree trunk.
His shoulders relaxed.
The vaulted ceilings felt as though they were pressing down upon me, although they were well above my head even where they joined the columns bristling with spears and pikes that supported them.  I was not sure I could see the far wall, but along the nearer sections of the side walls I saw all manner of armaments suspended from metal brackets embedded in the stone.  The dimensions of the room reminded me of where we fenced, although it would be a much more complicated matter to duel about so many pillars.  “Are we beneath the ballroom?” I asked, following as Sherlock moved further into the room.
Good point.
Mycroft headed for the minstrel gallery.
“Well, you carted it all the way home, we may as well look through it,” I murmured, my thumb stroking back and forth along the smooth skin at the top of his thigh.  His grey vest was the only thing he had on.  I rubbed the backs of my fingers along the curve of his stomach, up beneath the warm, worn cotton.
“Not sure anyone is…yet.” John gestured towards the stairs again.
Kit was one of the few Irregulars who liked to talk over a meal in the kitchen.  He always had a tale of some injured bird or stray cat he had rescued.  The Manor had no rats as far as I could tell and that may well have been Kit’s doing.  One of the bigger boys was his older brother, but I’d never made so bold as to ask him which one.
Sherlock took it back.
Sherlock thrust the torch at me and turned away, his cloak flaring about him.
I was surrounded by the scent of lavender.
I joined him quickly and stepped over the fiery border and under his arm.  It felt warmer outside the circle and Culvert’s stench was dissipating.
“You didn’t know that then,” he said.
"You missed the best part, John," Sherlock said.
My back stiffened.
“You look like that when you’ve been rummaging in your mind attic,” I said.
More often of late, his music heralds the day - a melodious crowing from the cock of our sitting room.  I chase it down to breakfast, running ahead of the dread that music and musician will disappear before I reach them, melting away, as phantasms do, in the light of day.
“At the séance,” Holmes supplied.
A bell tolled.  The sound rolled across the grass to the trees and echoed back.
He shifted closer and handed me a third.
“Mrs Hudson has left us a cold supper,” he said, motioning towards the doorway.  He looked me up and down and took the carrier bag.  “One more flight up.”
“You must be famished,” she declared, turning back to me.  She brought a plate of fruit and another of biscuits from the tray.  “This should tide you over until you’re ready to come down to the study.  You can have a proper breakfast there, unless you’d prefer luncheon.”
“Yes, yes, of course,” Mr Braithewaite said, not appearing the least offended.  He turned to Corvus.  “Shall I proceed?”
She shook her head.
You are not helping.
“There you are,” I crowed, gathering the box up.  I held it close to my chest as I hurried inside.  Gently, I set it on the desk and my hand found the scissors.
Over the top of the tree trunk, Sherlock vaulted, his torch flame a streak of light behind him.
“He reminded me of our dog - when we were young,” Sherlock said, "plus I recognised him from the video and concluded that the swan we observed had already arrived at the Pond.”
I stared steadily back.  The moon blade grew icy against my chest.  I forbore to touch it. His eyes were too quick.
On the terrace, petals scattered over stone and the last of the clouds scudded away.  Moonlight flooded the room.
I chuckled at the vertical bit.  It jostled Sherlock and he snuffled.  I rubbed my fingertips against his scalp and his breathing settled.
The grey light dimmed further.  I looked up.  Dark clouds were gathering above us, the moon nearly hidden now, like the sun.
Obviously, Sherlock did.
"Do you know how the creature was bringing bodies here...to now?" I asked, sitting on a stool and slipping the socks on.  I tried not to think about what might be dried into them and concentrated on how warm they were.
“Dinner?” Sherlock asked.
He flipped the knife and held out the hilt.  I stepped close enough to take it.  It was unusually heavy.
Lestrade walked over to the limbs and winced at the exposed shoulder joint.  "All eight of them, then?"
“Play it through again,” Sherlock said, “a little faster this time.”
I heard the bag land on the grass.  “Do you want to move somewhere more comfortable?” he asked.
“Yes, I’ve been told,” Sherlock replied.
The sun was not far above the horizon when we reached the low wall that marked the northern boundary of the cemetery.
My hands found each other of their own accord.
With hardly a pause, Sherlock plucked another knife from a box on the wooden counter.  He didn’t pause to aim.  The dagger sliced through the air and joined its brethren deep in the grain of the wood.  He grabbed another, a longer one this time, and drew his arm far back, almost as though he threw a javelin.  I heard the wood crack when it hit home.  He took up yet another.
“Clearly, your other senses are sharpening as well,” he said and daintily wiped his lips with his fingertips.
“Would you like some help?”
“Might have been hard to get away with the body,” I remarked.  “Lots of red tape in the military.”
I pushed the door closed with my foot.
“Take it slowly.  You lost a lot of blood.”
“Ah,” was all I could think to say.  It would give meal times an extra dimension.
“A little internet research about Ms Swann’s company and their newly released game - a synopsis, a few reviews, a trailer,” Sherlock said.
At that, Holmes did look up, our eyes meeting over the edge of the newspaper.  He held my gaze for a moment then turned the paper around.  His eyes ran over the headlines from top to bottom and returned to the middle of the page.
My hands flew up.  The pencil arced backwards.  It may have made it to the skull.  “Christ Jesus, you are a stealthy bastard!” I said, twisting round to find Sherlock stood behind my chair, spectral in his sheet-wrapped pallor.
“I am sure you would be able to deal with it,” Sherlock said.  “You will be pleased to know that your medical kit is in the bottom of the satchel, complete with a new bottle of sal volatile.”  And with that, he was gone.
The swan swam into view.
He pressed his lips together and swallowed.
Corvus looked up at Holmes.
“This morning,” she said.  “I didn’t want to serve anything else with the golden apples.”
Greg grimaced.  “Right.  I’ll start at the top gallery, then.”  He pointed at me.  “You look after him, yeah.”
Wiggins tugged the bow of the second shoe tight and scuttled aside.
“Neither of them may be there,” Ms Swann cautioned.
Sherlock’s eyes grew darker.  “You have to do me, too.”
His lips are like the roses fair,
“Come,” Sherlock said, without turning.
“Still, isn’t being here a risk?”
His eye opened, a dreamy look in it.
It called forth memories.  They came in swarms.
“For you,” he said, crouching before me and holding out his hands.
John went to sit on the sofa.  He put his feet up on the coffee table and took another sip of tea.  “I’m rather disappointed.”  He rested the cup on the arm of the sofa.  “Drink while the tea’s still hot.”
I turned and paused, cocking my head towards the hallway.  A scrabbling sound on the stairs was growing rapidly louder.  I strode towards the door just as an enormous animal bounded into the room.  I barred the beast’s way, legs apart and arms raised in front of my chest.  I could not say what the creature was, but it was a mammal and I knew where to strike it a blow that would stun it.  The brute snarled, deep and long, showing me fine fangs and shifted right in an attempt to circumvent me.  I shifted with him.
Mrs Hudson shook her head.  “He rarely says, but have a look at your letter, he may have told you.”  She picked up an empty mug from a side table on her way to the door.  “I’ve got something in the oven,” she said, “I’ll be back in a half hour or so.  Bon appétit, John.”
He leaned down, rested his hand on my shoulder.  “And made it back to tell the tale.”  He patted my shoulder and straightened up.  “I knew you would.”
I must have dozed.  Sherlock, too, heavy against my back.
I thought to wipe them away, but did not move.
I turned my attention to pouring a cup of tea, but I think I was flushing.  They certainly didn’t chafe.  It was a bit more like they caressed.
“John, what took you so long?” Sherlock called, striding across the firelit grass.  “Grab a torch.”
I thought of how pale our first lines had been on the floor.
“I never doubted your discretion.  You have been recommended to me in the highest terms,” he said.
“We’re betrothed now?”
John made an odd noise.
He huffed in a pretense of exasperation, but I could feel his muscles relaxing and he pulled his legs up onto the bench.  “Just for a minute.”
John took his mask out of his pocket and put it on.  “Fair enough.”
Mycroft waited for the bargaining.  When none came he raised his eyebrows, bid Sherlock good-day and spread his wings.  The wind wafted him away.
“Generous servings!” she exclaimed with a smile, setting the dish next to her on the cushion.
I complied.  Over my head and along my arms fell a cloud of cloth.  It was as soft as the drawers, but bleached to a whiteness.
“Well-dressed, piercing eyes?” Mike asked.
Gifts.
The music stopped.
John set down his tea, picked up the disc and held it out.  “Do you want to watch it?”
“John.”
I shivered.
Near the top of the stairs, in languages I didn’t know, Sherlock’s parents were bidding their guests a cordial good-night. Mycroft stood to one side, leaning against the balustrade, nodding at times in silent accord and gazing out over the crowd at others.  No one intruded on his apparent distraction by addressing him.  If he acknowledged them, they nodded to him in return; if he didn’t, they nodded to themselves and passed on.  I wondered for whom he was searching; who it was they all seemed to know needed to be found.
I obeyed.
“We take him after dark,” Mr Holmes replied and wiped away a crumb that had lingered at the corner of his lips.
He stepped out from behind his workbench, naked beside his fire, skin gleaming in the light, silver dragon twining about his neck.
“Oh, that reminds me, Archie already got his cuttings for rooting.  They’ll look beautiful out by the steps,” she said, tucking the silver pot away.
Didn’t understand much of anything that wasn't in a medical textbook.
I moistened my lips with the tip of my tongue.  “Vertigo does not usually afflict me,” I said.
“John and I did a couple years ago.”
“It’ll come back,” John said, “eventually.  Meanwhile, thank heavens for video and streaming.”
Sherlock took a step towards me, another, a step back.
The willow grew warm against my shoulder.
“New to me,” Sherlock said, “but not to John.”
She smiled when she took them.
John drank the rest and put the mug in the basin.  “They do have a Greco-Roman vibe to them,” he said, without meeting her eye.
I saw nothing but the shadows of the branches, heard naught but the murmur of the stream.  I slumped against a tree, rubbed my forehead against the rough bark.
Behind Sherlock a light went on.
“Also, there is this.”  Sherlock held up another paper.  “Not conclusive proof, but a letter from Roderick to Madeline dated within a month of the marriage saying ‘Of course, I will keep your confidence, but I fear for what may lie ahead for you both if mother finds out.’”
The fragrance followed.
“I think…it might be the celebration,” he said.  “It’s a ball for the vernal equinox.  The house is full of more activity than you have ever experienced here and it’s all revolving around vines and flowers and…”  He dropped the shirt and smoothed his hand along the inside of my thigh.
“I’m in pieces,” Sherlock said as I walked in the door.  “Mainly extremities.”  He was seated at the desk, leafing through my art folder.  It had been upstairs, propped against my wardrobe.
Sherlock nodded.  “But, we know there are people who do.”  He reached for the last piece of toast, held it over his mug.  “I’ve never found anyone who wrote about this though and I’ve looked.  Ms Swann walking through our front door was quite the surprise.”
All playfulness vanished from his expression.
He was offering himself to me.  I think that was pretty damned clear.  And yet...
I smiled at her turn of phrase for an instant.
I watched Mato carefully detaching the animal's harness from the cart.
In the gallery, an oboe sounded; strings vibrated.
“I scanned up and down the road in case he’d somehow sprinted off, but the number of pedestrians would have made that difficult.  There were more folks about than we’ve been seeing lately and no one was shoving people out of the way or weaving around them.  I crossed the road the second I could, which was fairly fast, and looked over the side because that was the only explanation that would seem to account for his sudden absence.”  John pursed his lips and sighed.  “Then I noticed the stairway down to the towpath.”
When we had reached the centre of the floor and Sherlock had indicated my place, the late arrival separated from the other guests and greeted Sherlock.  He was a trim, fair-haired man with a pointed beard and spectacles that seemed to gleam with their own light.  He was not ill-favoured, but there was something sharp and cold in his face that made me check the set of the knives in my sleeves.  He spoke of his pleasure at meeting Sherlock after so very long and his voice had an oiliness that I could almost feel on my skin.
I reached out and squeezed his shoulder.  “Yes,” I breathed.  “I wanted you so.”
Sherlock turned his wings blue, trimmed them with black, scalloped borders and a series of increasingly large, white spots.  He angled his wings so that his colours shimmered.
“John?”
“How can…” I started.  “…AB-positive?”
“And I hadn’t you to curb any indulgent flights of fancy that might seize me from time to time,” I added.
I snapped my mouth closed.
"Is there a road?" Lestrade enquired.
“Put them on and mind you keep track of them when you take them off by the fire,” she added.
“Truer words you have never spoken,” said the king.
No…I don’t think so.
I looked up from my task
“Not some ancient brew?”  I took a bigger sip.  Parts of my mouth tingled that I didn’t think I had ever felt before.
She rolled over, branch clamped in her jaws, limbs clamped around Baskerville.
Dr Moynihan had been in the morgue with Sherlock when I had returned and Molly had simply smiled and pointed towards the open doorway off the main morgue from which I could hear Sherlock exclaiming something about Christmas.
I was slightly mollified; I had wondered at the satchel’s weight.  Even so, the next quarter hour was an anxious one spent listening for a thump upon the floor signalling Corvus’ collapse.  Fortunately my kit was not called into service, for when Dr Braithewaite next opened the door, Sherlock had resumed his seat by my side and Dr Adamantine was able to glower at both of us as he departed.
Cock had been pushed towards the back of the crowd as it shifted with us.  He raised his hands over his head to clap.
“The lightning was rather invigorating.”
“It’s the one thing he knows Puck covets,” Mycroft said.
“She prefers to hunt then,” he said, sliding the ornate brass gate aside.  “Bigger game, fewer humans in the way.”
“And the lighting is this room?” Holmes asked.
Sherlock dropped his phone as he reached for it.  I stepped closer, holding the light steady for him.
He raised a hand, possibly in acknowledgement, before he disappeared into the crowd.
Sherlock’s hand moved to the back of my neck and on into my hair.
The air grew icy.  I held Sherlock more tightly.  Why don’t I know what to do?  Sherlock’s often hurt, I always knew what to do.  I was his doctor.  I
As I said, I used to gamble.  I’ve given it up, but I don’t think I shall ever give up cards.
“John!”
“That was the first time you observed the man?” Sherlock said.
He continued his airy handclasp for a minute more before withdrawing his hands.  “You don’t seem very afraid,” he remarked.
It was the first time I had had a chance to show him how good I was with a knife.
Yes, well.
A fierce roar issued from the library.
I moved a couple sticky notes to free the edge.
“Come, John,” Sherlock called.
Holmes’ gaze swept over me when I reached the pavement.
Not fucker though; he came down the stairs after Sherlock.
I moved over to centre myself in front of the target and he stepped aside.  I shifted the knife from one hand to the other, unsure which I would use.  When it comes to throwing things, I’ve always been ambidextrous.  I chose the left and threw.  The blade struck within the outline, a little to one side, where the left eye would have been.  I glanced at him.  I thought he might smile; it had been a very good first throw.  Instead, he scowled.
He glanced towards the gallery.
Hours seemed to have passed.  The twisted roots of the wood gave way to grass.  He hastened towards the music, stepped on a nettle and cried out.
I circled the desk and drew the other curtains together, marched to the door, locked it and slid the doors to the kitchen shut.  I turned back to him.
He was near where I would be strongest.  Well, a couple steps to the right would have been in the middle of the quarter and that would have been even worse for him.
I felt a draft, fumbled for the covers to pull them up.  They would not move.  One-eyed, I looked over my shoulder.  The darkness curling over the foot of the bed was denser than the shadows in the rest of the room.  The blankets pulled taut on either side of my legs.  The hand on my shoulder was icy.
I took my flask out and drank.  It was far sweeter.  I licked my lips.  I should have recognised the taste.  My blood warmed.  I pursed my lips.  He does have a sweet tooth.
I raised an eyebrow.
He slid down beside me.
"You know what damage the wildlife inflicts," Lestrade said.
I set the glass of water down.  “I’m so sorry I alarmed you,” I said.  “A dream from last night came back to me.  Vividly.  The flavour, I think, brought it to mind.”
“I’ve been re-reading my notes on our old cases,” John replied.
Cock One assured Sherlock he would become accustomed to his caresses in time.
I might.  Such as what on earth the costume is supposed to be.  It’s too grand for Robin Hood, although the archery connection would have been pleasing, and I’m too long in the tooth to be Puck or Peter Pan, although my mirror reflected surprisingly flattering images when I gave it a good hard look.  Still, boyhood was too far behind me and besides, I didn’t feel lost anymore.
“All of them.”
It was a box of pins that Sherlock held out to me.  He had put two between his lips and was pinning a very neat corner of black cloth around the edge of one of the plain stone sepulchres that rose from the floor.  He used the two he had and stretched out his hand for another.
Baskerville bounded out of the shadows at the far side of the library when we entered.
"And the connection to the matter at hand?”
I wrested my gaze from his chest, followed the line of his hip down those long, long legs.  He had arranged himself coyly, genitals hidden by the shadow of a muscular thigh.  I had considered how he might be shaped.  Unlike the rest of him, I had never caught a glimpse to guide my speculations.  Is what is hidden always the most alluring?  My eyes travelled back to his face.
“Not if the newspaper was new when it was used,” he said, holding up the pages that still retained the shape of the box they’d been folded around.
We stood watching as horse and cart trundled across the clearing, skirting those milling about the oak tree and halting where the hill fell away to the south.
I retraced my steps to his other side and undid that cuff.  The skin I could see was likewise unmarred.
He leaned back.
Sherlock shook his head.  “For good?  No.”  His eyes flicked to John.  “We agreed to look after a few things while she’s away, but the timeframe is quite open-ended.”  He gestured with the stack of letters he was holding.  “There’s not much to do though.”
Sherlock laughed this time.  “A classical conditioned response,” he said.
So, I returned to my seat amongst the tree stump’s roots, between Sherlock’s long legs, and ate my fill of roasted meat.  And, from time to time, Sherlock would slip a finger between my shirt collar and my throat, and stroke my pulse point.
“I was catching my breath, my shirt-tails covering my satiated cock...which was a good thing because I was too tired to tuck myself away.   My eyes were half-closed…”  All around me the night had been moving.  In the middle of the clearing, there had been a dancer.  Pale, pale, like the moon overhead.  With the sway and twirl of the dance, garments had fallen away.  The beautiful dancer was a he.  “...and I saw a moonbeam dance.”  I lifted my free arm, stretched out my fingers.  “I wanted to go to him, but I couldn’t get up.  I had no strength for it and then someone warm and fragrant settled on my lap and one part of me seemed to have the strength the rest of me lacked.”  My arm fell back onto the root.
I felt the heat of his shower-warmed skin at my back.
I studied this lank-haired apparition whose pale lips twitched restlessly beneath a sparse moustache and above an even sparser goatee.  Through the mask’s eyes, I glimpsed his, gleaming and dark, wild and cold.
I turned my wrist with the dagger in my hand.  “An excellent quality in a weapon,” I observed, “which means I wanted to cut myself just now.”
She pulled a cushion from her canvas bag and sat herself down near the tree.  “This is a good patch.  I think we’ll get all you need and some for me as well right here.”  She drew two cloth sacks out of her bag and handed me one.  “Sherlock loves candied violets.”
I sighed and leaned back, the crown of my head against Sherlock’s belly and followed the Lights’ dance.  “I should have realised.  I’ve always wanted to see these.”
“When did you do that?” I asked, reassured at the thoroughness of his measures.
“Have you ever heard them hiss, John?”
“No, but I probably will,” he replied.  “You put the box out in the hall…”
“You knew when you first looked at her.  You were interested and decided to take her case, even if you didn’t tell her right away,” John said, eyes fixed on Sherlock's.
The lights were bright, the centrifuge whirred on its own.  The desk chairs were gone, the lab table had been tidied.  I shoved up my sleeves.  The tiny scab at my cubital fossa was reassuring.  The centrifuge clicked off, its hum ticking to a stop.  I inhaled, checked the supply cupboard.  My view of the shelves of shining glass was unobstructed.  I blew out the breath I had been holding and returned to the library at a more moderate pace.
“You’re getting as bad as Sherlock, John.”
I snorted and filed that away.  “But it accepted another nasty one anyway.”
I felt his tongue first and then his lips.
I snatched my hand away, bit my lip.  The skin at the base of my thumb blistered as I watched.  I pressed it to my mouth, ran my tongue over it.
My breathing quickened.
Sherlock tapped my shoulder again.  “Look east, John.”  His hand appeared by my cheek pointing across the clearing and there it was, a pearly glow suffusing the trees in the east, outlining their branches and casting long shadows on the low clouds of smoke.
Between the night and morrow,
I eased a slender dagger past the cuff of my sleeve.  It would serve.
I saw it then, tucked back on a high wooden cross beam.  It glistened.
Chapter 11 prompt:  #19 (Faith)
I have no idea.
Falconry’s a lot easier to cope with than what else I saw or thought I saw.
Mycroft’s glance moved from Greg’s fingers to his eyes.  “I thought you would like it.  I ordered a dressing gown for you in it.”
“But the park’s locked at night,” I thought out loud.
The folds of the draping didn’t make my interest nearly as clear as a pair of trousers would have done.  “That’s convenient,” I remarked.
He had been right.  It was enjoyable sitting in the fresh air watching the parade of leave-takers with the sound of Sherlock’s voice in my ear offering his biographies of those I had only glimpsed during the evening.  I felt myself relaxing and the temptation to sleep reasserted itself.
"Surely, you would weary of me," John said and wished it was not such a reasonable assessment of such a future.
“Never?” Sherlock probed.
Greg raised his eyebrows.
I glanced up at the gallery and caught Mrs Hudson watching us.  She looked very cross.  I held out one hand and gestured as though I was moving a bow across my arm.  She nodded and turned away.  The tuning of instruments got much louder.  There had to be at least a dozen of them.  I wasn’t sure how they were all fitting up there.
“You are most welcome Chief Detective Inspector Lestrade,” Mycroft replied.  His glance lingered on Greg’s face, then swept to Molly.  “And a peignoir for you, my dear, something elegant for the boudoir.”
True.  I thought he was down in the kitchen so much because he’s a growing lad.
The silhouette of a figure wielding a long oar glided into view, halting when he was perfectly framed in the opening in the balustrade.  Another figure rose up from what must have been a barge, but was invisible from our vantage.  He mounted the stairs, bare-headed, his garments a fall of pewter about his form.  With measured steps, he crossed the terrace.
Another clarinet joined in.
A murmur rose from the guests, more like the wind than the voices of people and then, even that, died away.
The remnants of a hearty dinner covered much of the table and I was glad to see it.  Holmes had been thin and drawn when he came back.  The ensuing weeks had lessened the pallor of his cheeks and a bit of flesh had softened the grave lines of his face, but his eyes were not bright.
He played a scale twice then let his fingers wander.  He did not recall a single song, but his fingers liked the feel of the keys beneath their tips and fragments of melody came back to him.  He pulled a pillow behind his back and leaned against the wall, the branches only a little way above his head.  He could not see the moth, but he felt the brush of its wings as it moved down his body, stinging.
We strolled to our places on the dance floor.
I hoisted the basket up onto the coffee table and sat myself in front of it.
I put my hand over his and blew out a long, long, breath.  “I cannot see myself, much less observe,” I said.
“I’ve got murals on my ceiling, stained glass and mosiacs in my bathroom,” John said and held up a finger.  “Mind, I have to sit on the toilet to shower because it’s a WC that was turned into a wet room in lieu of a couple months' rent one summer and the ‘kitchen’ is a corner sideboard with a kettle, a microwave, a two-burner hob and a mini-fridge underneath.”
So, I did.
His friends waved back and whistled.
His fingers pressed further beneath the denim, chill and insistent.  I lifted my hips and he grasped my buttocks firmly, pushing me deeper into this mouth.
“Shall we start calling you Salome, Sherlock?” he said, his hungry eyes sweeping over Sherlock’s chest and shoulders and opening wider as he stared at Sherlock’s face.  “Just the head not enough for you?”
I looked up at him.  I had never thought to use the open spell on clothing.
“A recipe?” I mumbled with my mouth full of rice.
The dam had given way.
“Twice again,” Sherlock said, “without pausing.”
“Something different tonight, then,” he whispered, arm curving behind my neck, muscles taut as he rolled me onto my back once more.
His hand stroked my hair.  “Not a thing.”
So you keep insisting.
…in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks. Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting. A letter, however, had lately reached me in a distant part of the country—a letter from him—which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a personal reply. The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation. The writer spoke of acute bodily illness—of a mental disorder which oppressed him—and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady. It was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said—it was the apparent heart that went with his request—which allowed me no room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons.
The form glided further into the moonlight.
The phone pinged.
Sherlock’s hand tightened at my hip.
Sherlock sat down and brought all the cards towards him.  “I know what Frank Hudson looked like when he died, and as a younger man.  I studied his police record carefully enough and it was a long one, even though they could never hold on to him.”  Rapidly, Sherlock checked the cards that were face up and turned over the ones that weren’t.  He sat up straight in the chair and turned to me.  “There aren't any of Frank; they’re all of you, John.”
The grape was such a deep purple as to be nearly black and had a sheen upon it like frost.  I did not recall seeing any like it before, but Holmes has access to gardens and greenhouses that few others do.  He held it closer to me and I took it from him.  It was like a dark jewel that I could eat.
“Wasn’t mother going to wonder who the interloper in the family crypt was a few years later?” I asked.  “Do we have his death certificate, by any chance?”
“I’m not going to suddenly turn into a dog, am I?”
“Jean-Pierre thinks he’s located the headquarters of a ring of arsonists he’s been tracking for months,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock stiffened behind me, his arm drawing away. He stood.
We rounded the children’s pond and sped over the Hanover Bridges, my breath coming more noisily with each stride, the lead slipping across my sweaty palm.  I was thinking I should not have bothered with my jacket when Baskerville slowed to a trot and then a walk.  We were in the open fields near the Hub and far from the gates, which I thought just as well.  Finally, Baskerville stopped and sat and I caught up to him.
A pair of lovers tumbled from the shadows, their arms entwined, their cocks full against their stomachs.  They stumbled towards the tree and leaned upon it heavily, facing one another, kissing and stroking, each lifting one leg to caress the other, as though two hands were inadequate to the task.
John tensed as the swan glided by, grateful that they had thought to put three layers of masking tape over the filming light on the camera.
“Everything in your room arranged to your satisfaction?” he asked.
I drank more tea.
John stroked faster.  “One of us did,” he said, the fingers of his other hand digging into the side of Sherlock’s thigh.
I did what he directed, saw him crouch and hook the spear on something above our heads in an arch wrought of bricks.  We slipped under and emerged on the other side into the night air.
Mike chuckled.  “I used to hear how good you were with anatomy.”
“Drink,” Sherlock said, flask out and being tipped over my cup and then his own.
Eventually, his ministrations ended.
The water had reached Fucker’s neck now and still he walked along the river bottom towards us, hands above his head now, clapping.
The man touched his cap and drove on.
“I believe you have your answer,” I said, “but unless you have a secret twin you haven’t told me about, that will remain a hypothetical question.”
She swatted my arm.  “It’ll be nice to have a bit of spring sunshine in the midst of this.”
She flipped the card.
“Oh!”
Two thick tentacles sprang from the water.  One coiled about his spear, the thicker about his waist.  I swung forward.  The amputation was swift.  The severed end hung limply from Sherlock's hips, the other end persisted in clinging to him while the whole tentacle continued to wrestle for the spear.  I slashed at it, but only succeeded in knocking the spear from Sherlock's hand.  The tentacle brandished the captured weapon in the air before aiming it downwards.
I paused, cup in mid-air.
Not so sure about that.
There was a grumbling from within.
I turned back to the garden.  Mrs Hudson had been right about the lighting being pretty.  Tiny gleams of blue and white and gold twinkled from underneath the foliage and about the fountain, which seemed larger from my new vantage.  I leaned further over the edge and squinted.  I did not recall the statues surrounding it, pairs of them it seemed, clinging to the central column which looked more like a tree to me now with the water gushing from somewhere amidst its branches and dripping down the backs of the statues.
I don’t know, but it does.
In the still liquid, shapes shimmered.  A cloaked skeleton rode a pale horse at the head of a winding file of armoured soldiers.  Pennants drooping, mounted and foot followed him through a rock-strewn landscape.
He was up on the knoll, running around the restaurant’s patio and leaping periodically into the air.  If he was chasing something, it was too small for me to see, but my gesticulating caught his eye and he came barrelling down the hill towards me.  I was feeling pleased with myself for being able to afford the animal this simple pleasure when a shadow detached itself from a distant group of trees and loped across the ground on an intercept course with Baskerville.
Mrs Hudson tutted and went down the stairs.
I nodded.
“As a practitioner of the art yourself, surely you appreciate the pitfalls of relying on that,” he admonished with the hint of a smile.
I don’t know.
“What is that?” I asked, coming closer.
“Yes.”
“I do not withdraw, Sherlock,” I said.
Sherlock dipped his forefinger in the water and the words became audible.
His eyes darted towards the kitchen and then across the table.
“He explained that several bodies had been found among the jagged rocks of the coast, but none of them had been Arthur’s.  Two crew members had made it to shore alive – the cook and the ship’s boy.  They were both from The Lizard and Mr Morrow thought that might have helped them save themselves.  Neither of them knew anything of Arthur Morrow’s fate, however.  Three witnesses from the lighthouse said they had seen the ship’s main mast break off before the smaller sails caught the westward wind.  The ship had last been seen as darkness fell, bucking and spinning towards the horizon.  The shipowner had no success finding any trace of his vessel, the rest of its crew or its cargo and Lloyd’s had paid on the insurance.”
“Almost everyone has someone without our…abilities, who is important to them.  He made it his business to find out who cared for whom and used threats against the more vulnerable individual to control the stronger one.  He’s been doing it for quite a while, although I hadn’t become aware until last year when one of the guests here came to ask for my help on behalf of her husband.  Unfortunately, I had to quell that disturbance in the Artic and wasn’t able to solve his problem before he affected his own solution, removing the burden from his wife’s life by killing himself.”
My eyes were adjusting to the gloom.  I strained forward, squinting.  Behind me, I heard rustling as others did the same.
Her arm darted out from beneath his wing and grabbed something small near her nest.  She must have strangled it, because it made no further sounds.  She was an able defender; he had thought she was asleep.  He rubbed the underside of his beak through her feathers in appreciation.
“They kept a house in London, have had a crypt in London since before Westminster Abbey was built, of course, they would use a London paper,” he said.
Melting was perhaps what I would do, rather than go up in flames.
Baskerville looked in the same direction and ran ahead and round the clump of trees a couple times before I reached it.  Searching in the shade beneath the branches was a slow process and Baskerville had galloped off again before I found what I wanted.  I turned, waving the stick above my head for Baskerville to see.
Sherlock had been so quiet for so long, I had wondered whether he had fainted.  Several times I had looked over my shoulder to check that he was indeed still there, despite the stoutness of the mooring rope and my faith in my skill at tying knots.  Little but his hands around the harpoon had shown at first in the moonlight, but the third time I checked, he had turned his face towards me and opened his eyes as I looked.  I had nodded at him and applied myself to the interminable rowing with renewed vigour.
“Bit chilly,” he said.  “Why don’t you close that.”
Puck watched eagerly.
“I’ll make you cold,” he said, rolling off.
“There are spirits in there as well as wine and fruit,” she said.
“I looked at the faces of varying ages and sex gathered around that table and saw the frightening gleam of hope on each one.  My temper flared.  It was vile to exploit that vulnerability.  Without even attempting to school my expression, I turned to this Madame Willow but drew back at what I saw.”
John glanced up again.  The circle at the top of the stairs was bright.  “What’s there?” John asked.
Puck’s hand shook as he accepted the vial that was, in every detail, a duplicate of the one that Titania had carried away.  “Thank you,” he said, glancing up and back down again quickly.
Holmes glanced from the newsprint to me and back.  “You consulted a spiritualist,” he stated matter-of-factly.
I twisted about as Siròc landed on Sherlock’s shoulder and chirped by his ear.
The idea coursed through me like a current.
Puck turned back and the king crooked a finger.  Puck cart-wheeled closer.
“The German roach is capable of flying,” I said, “even if they rarely do it.  If you had the capacity, in an emergency, wouldn’t you use it?”
Corvus pressed his lips together before he spoke.  “What if it wasn’t Roderick or his father who would have been implicated in such a disclosure?”
“He looked a bit peaky when I saw him last night,” I commented.  “Aren’t you going to join me?”
“I didn’t give enough time to training him when he was younger,” she said, “and now he’s set in his ways.  He’s such a sweet dog though, so friendly.”
Sherlock watched from atop the bust.  He liked John’s form, liked seeing the muscles move beneath the smooth skin.  Unfortunately, it would taste like soap now.
“When I was watching that through the viewfinder, I was telling myself the camera was malfunctioning,” John said.
think that Redbeard was a boy, it was just that he had been my companion since I was a baby and he was even more of a brother to me than Mycroft, but, of course, he was just an animal…”  Sherlock spit the word out with derision and started pulling the napkin to bits.
I took the cup he offered me and sipped.  The flavour was smoky, not what I remember as Mrs Hudson’s usual fare.  It was hot and sweetened just to my taste.  I closed my eyes to savour it. An image I have sometimes seen in my dreams waited for me.
Hmph.
“Stronger,” he said.
Against me, Sherlock began to tremble.  I unhooked my cloak, wrapped it around him and held him to me.
“John!  Doctor Watson!”
“Coffee?” Greg asked.
“You might have been.  Time’s often different up in the study,” Mrs Hudson stated.
I was sorry to have missed the first part of what he'd had to say about the silver-haired woman stepping into the boat.
She picked up a pot of glass held in a metal framework with a wooden handle.  “Now with this one you have to be very careful with the heat, but it’s good for delicate concoctions, perfumes or flavourings, or very subtle magic, or when the colour of the mixture is important.”
It’s unnerving when he does that - holds me in his sphinx-like gaze.  It’s easy to get lost in it.  I had to concentrate to keep my focus.  “Come up with a rational explanation yet?”
I clutched at the branches, shifted my weight onto the foot already wedged in the pile.  How fast could I scale it?
“Probably not, everyone’s usually too busy copulating or resting up from it, to pose much of a threat, even if they were so inclined, but the blade is the best way to cut the fern you wish to gather.  Their stalks are very tough.  More than the slippery moss, that’s probably why you fell in the river when you tried to pull some of it up.”
“You and Mycroft had a dog, an Irish Setter?” John asked, intrigued that Sherlock voluntarily paired himself with Mycroft in using the possessive pronoun.
Sherlock turned his camera where John directed, adjusted the telescopic lens.
“They did put it to the test, though.”
“Never had to play such a long game as I did with you though,” John added.
A loud guffaw drew my gaze to a short fellow, holding forth at the centre of an attentive circle of listeners, with a multi-coloured hat that jingled as he moved his head.
Sherlock stooped to retrieve the knife.  He rotated it between his fingers.  The silver was very bright; it flashed as it turned.
“Fine for courting though.”  Sherlock clicked the shutter on his camera.
We emerged near the corner where the carrier pigeons roosted.  I’d come out that way with Mrs Hudson in my early days, but we’d begun our climb in the kitchens.  The sound of fluttering wings accompanied our passage now.  There was a door to one side of the dovecote, under the platform at the level of the top of the wall from which the birds took flight.
“I may as well finish now,” I said.
“The moon rose over the mountain, silvering the rocks.  Your hands gleamed as you played.”
I raised my eyebrows at this and started to stretch, but didn’t get beyond a slight rolling of my shoulders.  My hands were clasped around Sherlock’s hips.  I unlaced my fingers and wiggled them.  They were stiff.  “I slept like that?”
He smoothed his hand over my buttocks.  “You’ve been here, with me, for more than a year now.”
Thus, we ambled.  I pulled the collar of my coat up, stuffed my free hand deep in my pocket and kept throwing the ball.  I assumed Baskerville would get tired or hungry at some point, probably the latter.
“That’s a mug,” John observed.
The hands of the clock on the gallery rail turned with us, forwards and back.
“You can feel that your first wish has been granted. But be warned, sweet John, if you open your eyes and look upon me, your second wish will be realised in a manner that may not please you, because
Alan’s eyes widened.  “And you’re Sherlock Holmes!”  He turned back to John.  “And you must be Dr Watson.  It’s a pleasure,” he said, extending his arm a little before drawing it back.  “Sorry.”
Then, Sherlock was up on the window seat, one leg over the sill.  “Come,” he said and was gone.
I gazed north again.  The air was violet, the stars white sparks burning through it.  The rosy glow had blossomed.  I twisted to face it fully.  Wisps of green smoke curled above the trees.
“’I asked Agnes to bring Isa to me so I could communicate with him directly,’ she said. ‘This is not easy for me and I cannot do it often.’
The hand was offered to the dog.  The nails of its hind legs clicked against the floorboards as it snuffled loudly against the palm.
“The tartness isn’t just the rose hips?”
Lestrade looked up and nodded.  "Not murders, but executions?"
“I wouldn’t know where to begin.”
He’d ask, if he needed it fresh.
Greg tapped at his screen, read for a moment.  “Not according to our preliminary inspection.”
There was an irritating buzzing somewhere below us.  It was too far away to hit and I refused to open my eyes to find the source and silence it.
“You would not grow impatient, if I took so long to choose?” John asked.  It seemed an enormous request.
The fire hissed.
I peered.
“Fine, while you were off in your mind palace thinking…” John began.  “What’s that lot up to?”
“Clover?”
The prelude commenced as the curtain rose on the lavish sets for which Irving’s Lyceum was renowned.  I had only had a moment to appreciate them when I heard the first familiar flurry of notes.  Eyes widening, I leaned forward, elbows upon the padded edge of our box, but the melody merged into a welter of other sounds and I slumped back in my chair.  I managed not to grumble aloud and, although my posture was less eager, my ears remained pricked, and as the second act unfolded, a familiar phrase riveted me.  It was not, however, a musical one.  Upon the stage, a Roman officer described Cleopatra to his comrade:
My serpent slipped the rest of the way out of my sleeve and onto its comrade, holding it down with red claws and biting along its spine, lower and lower, biting and licking, its wings half opening, then closing.
The breeze tickled and I giggled.  It felt so much like a mischievous tongue.
He ate the apple and dropped a seed on the tray.
“That’ll do,” I said, stepping briskly to the window and pulling the curtains closed.  “Don’t move.”
My hand found its way back to his knee.  The tingling wasn’t as strong as before and I stroked the skin, feeling an odd regret as the sensation ebbed away.  In his hand, the last gold band remained, still unoffered, the chains affixed to it chiming faintly as he flipped it around his fingers.
“So sweet,” Sherlock said.
It startled me.  Even now, we don’t use our forenames in the sitting room very often.  Its use then didn’t lessen the increasing warmth of the room nor the thumping of my heart, but it guaranteed that I would reveal all he wanted to know, impending ridicule or no.
I had copied a concise version of my notes into Sherlock's lab book and typed the rough text, complete with the many questions my observations had raised, into a document on my laptop.  A number of books and journals surrounded my seat at the same table where I had had lunch.  I had found most of the reference works I had needed in the library, books and journals on zoology and haematology and infectious diseases, and additional sources in the online databases whose passwords had been added to the lab book along with the directions.  Both had clearly been written in haste.  Despite the records of past results and the directions for the procedures to follow in his absence, there had been no explanation of the objectives of the research.  Their absence intrigued me.  It suggested that he had not expected to need to explain his purpose to anyone at this stage.  I began to entertain the flattering notion that the role of research assistant had been added to the job description during our interview.  I worked all the more assiduously because of it.
John entered the house.
“Well, I…”
True to my word, a few minutes later I was dressed, and Baskerville and I were strolling out the front door carefully obscured from curious eyes.  I’d left the lead back on the bed.  It was more a way for him to communicate that he wanted to go out than an actual form of restraint.  At least now, I knew how to obscure him when he ran ahead as effectively as when he trotted by my side.  This was just as well for the other park goers.
It had been snowing properly by the time we’d sought rest.  The air in the courtyard had been thick with snowflakes like feathers, the sky white, the light diffuse.
That faint fragrance was wafting off him again.  I took a deep breath of it and sighted along the arrow.  I had taken the measure of the bow and the hall.  It was too soon to make other judgements.  I released the string.
I put my hand over my mouth.
The lamplight gleamed in the raindrops caught in his curls.
“You’ve been away from London for so long, I’m amazed an engagement necessitating travel would interest you,” I remarked, my eyes still on the scenery.
I smelt the tea before I heard the soft thump of it being set down beside me.  I looked up.
“Whatever you wish,” Sherlock replied.  He’d lowered his arm, but hadn’t changed the direction of his gaze.
I inhaled sharply.  Assumptions!  Against my cheek, I felt Sherlock’s smile.
Sherlock held his flask out again.
The music ceased.
Sherlock smoothed over the scratches.  “Stitchers look like dragonflies - devil’s darning needles, some call them, but they don’t darn; they stitch.  And when their work needs cleansing, they fly out with it into the rain, the stormier the better.”
“Do they still do that there?” I asked.
“Right,” I rasped, noting the bottle of water on his nightstand.  I needed one of those.
“The nights ebb and flow,” he said.  “Not easy to quantify them.”
“Walking?”
“The funeral service at five of the clock,” Sherlock replied.
Sherlock finished tightening his scarf over his mouth and nose.
“Do you use the berries?” I asked, stroking along one branch with my forefinger.  My palm tingled where the scratches had been.
Sherlock ground his forehead against John’s shoulder.  “I had promised myself I would come back to you and we...”  He sighed.  “Seems I brought you to me.”
"Tower's not there right now," Lestrade replied, pulling the boat closer by the line.  "How's your Latin?"
Greg glanced at me.  "Still new to it, eh?"
He raised a finger.  “More accurately, you’re not what you think you are.”
Beyond our circle of sparks, the room was dark.  Inside, my part of our design glowed weakly.  Sherlock’s part was barely there.
“Much as I hate to tell you you’re right, Mycroft, you are,” Sherlock replied.
“Is it?” I asked around a mouthful of stew.  I swallowed and took a drink of the mulled cider.  “It seems like I’ve been reading much longer than that.”
“Can you pull back a little, John,” Sherlock asked.
He heard me and held up the box from his lap.
Behind us, the lamps went out.
A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master.
Sherlock was behind me in an instant.
I saw the files under his arm.  “All done?” I asked.
I came abreast of Sherlock.
“You didn’t go to a school?” John asked.
I grinned in the dark at the sound of his voice and headed towards it.
He smiled then.  “Yes?”
I had barely stopped to look at him when he lay down on the bed.  My garments were, no doubt, strewn about the room.  It had been less love-making and more devouring.
An oboe caressed the air.
We took another step.
I stared.
“Thank you for telling Sherlock where I was last night, Siròc,” I said, feeling only mildly ridiculous.
“I know it’s fine,” Sherlock said, one fingertip tracing around the back of my ear.  “It only works if it’s fine.”
I smoothed my hand across his chest.  “You look beautiful in half-light.”
Inside, the bell sounded again.
“Yet another prime minister?” I asked and scooped up more cotton wool for my cleaning.
“You still look peaky, dear.  Stepping through will do that when you’re not used to it,” she concluded and exited briskly.
“We’ll see you later, then,” Greg said, nodding.
Haven’t had a chance to look yet.
“You’ve been experimenting on me!” I exclaimed.  “The different fragrances, the food.  Mrs Hudson’s in on it!”
John drew his face back from the eyepieces and stared at Sherlock.  “Since when are you patient?”
The sky was white with lightening.  The wind howled.  Branches thrashed.  Small trees fell, limbs entangled, bark ripping as they scraped past.  The ground shook when they landed.
Sherlock dropped something into a sack; from the looks of it, another item that had been appropriated to our purpose. He was crouched in the bottom of the skiff, leaning over the rowing bench.  He hunched lower, gripping the edge of the bench with the hand holding the sack and peering intently into the shadows.
“I’m afraid it won’t be so quiet with that lot swimming,” Madeleine said.
My hand came away sooty. I sniffed at the smudge before wiping it off on the grass.  Sherlock would have been able to identify it as willow I supposed, knowing ash as he does.  To me it just smelt like a wood fire.
I took it and kissed it.
“The ointment did this?”
“I’m sure you do,” I said.  “Carry on, Corporal.”  I called him that sometimes.
The harp sounded anew.
I stared at this man I had known for an hour.  He had not said I was uninjured; he’d said the injury was not physical.  That is pretty much the definition of a psychosomatic condition, which is what my therapist had been telling me for weeks and it had not made a bit of difference.  She did not see me.  He did.
There was firelight in his eyes when I looked.
“The child is with the housekeeper’s daughter, who is her nurse.   All three of them went to Usher a couple days ago.  The housekeeper is only just back,” he said.  “And I have Barrows tracking Adamantine.  I want to know what else he does.  Barrows will send us telegrams, as necessary, and watch out for the child once he reaches Usher.”
I sighed out the words, “Down in the woods.”  He had been under those trees needing a good sword hand while I was puzzling out what I was seeing.
“I got that he was barking,” I said.
I looked towards the moon, snowy above the fire.  A breeze gusted through the clearing.  The flames leapt higher.
It was not until we had made a turn that took us from the road Corvus’ carriage was following that Holmes uttered a syllable.  “John,” he said, his eyes shifting from the view out the cab window to my face.
John kept stroking, feather light.  “Did you notice the candle on the dresser?” he asked.
I wish I could turn you off.
“Best to be prepared, dear.”
I went back into the room.  By the light from the water closet, I saw my slippers by the bed.  I sat down, pushed off my shoes and slid my feet into the slippers.  Assuredly, they were mine.
This was as it should be.  I tried to smile at him.  “Drink,” I murmured.
“Speedy’s does a nice lunch,” she said.  “Nothing fancy, but nice.  You could probably reserve one of the outside tables if you asked Mr Chatterjee now.”
Shut up.
“Whosoever,” Mycroft reiterated.
He hummed and it tickled my throat.
I should have.  The number of steps I had taken were far more than had been necessary on my previous journeys.
The path took a sharp turn upwards, the roots crossing the trail serving more as steps than impediments.  I felt that in my thighs.
My eyebrows went up and my gun went down.  I called urgently to Baskerville with an orderly retreat from this inexplicable scene in mind.
I took another sip.  “It’s so good it should be illegal.”
The shadow creature was too big to be any sort of dog or even wolf.  It drew closer, running so fast its feet barely touched the ground.
“Will you stay if I do?”
“He was never there when the man was,” she whispered.
Had he concluded I had been hallucinating and wanted to see how wildly?  I sighed.  If I had been hallucinating, he should know.  It’s not good to have a doctor who sees things that are not there.  “A winter forest marching towards the horizon,” I said.
The plants started to twine about my wrists and I drew in a breath.
Sherlock dropped to the sill.
The bird sang back.
I continued to stroke his hair.  “I don’t only love you for your successes, you know.”
Something dark poked through the remaining wrappings.  I rubbed my finger over it.  It was wood.  I smiled.  “I don’t know,” I said absentmindedly.  “Something about Gladstone.”
“So soon after the uproar in the theatre?” Mycroft asked.  He sucked the rose flesh off the tip of the thorn. “You might try to be a little more discreet.”
“Go on, then,” she urged with a shooing motion.
He nudged me under the spray, returned his hands to my scalp, chased all the lather and all the tension away.
At the top there was a ring of windows, but no Sherlock.  I turned almost full circle.  A shadow passed outside one of the windows.  I paused an instant, then finished my turn. Open door to the right of the one I had entered. Fine.  Out I went onto the balcony that circled the top of the turret.
“I’ve heard them played, but I’ve never seen one up close.”
“Oh, John, there you are,” Mrs Hudson said.  She came and stood next to me, leaning up against the door.  “Lovely day for an outing.”
He had slipped his hands into the sleeves of his garment and completely disappeared.
Sherlock was stood on the coffee table, deducing at breakneck speed, hands waving, dressing gown swirling, all the light in the room converging on him in a tall, bright column.
“Not easy to sneak off and pretend you’re dead with this crowd then?”
I knew he was scanning the article entitled, “Noted Spiritualist Revealed To Be a Fraud”.
It would be a short-lived mystery in any event.
“Shift focus to the left,” Sherlock whispered.
Molly smiled thinly.  “There was something else from the bloodwork.”
I had to close my eyes at the taste.  It was everywhere in my mouth.  Summer itself.  I swallowed.  Felt another berry tapping against my lips and opened my mouth like a small bird for it and Sherlock dropped the berry in.  There was a third and a fourth and a fifth, then they stopped.
“Yes,” he said, “and you know I think better when you are nearby.”
I shook my head, pulling my dressing gown closer about me and heading for the teapot sitting upon the table.  I had not stopped to dress, such had been my haste.
There’s nothing like having a lover awake in one’s arms wanting more to bring the blood to all the right places.  I dropped the phone and reached for him.
“Ah, you spotted Palug, her older son.  Not easy to do,” Sherlock said.  “This area is his remit.  Chapalu will have gone back to guard the grounds of the Manor house by now.”
John edged closer.  “Yes.”
Come home.  Lestrade’s waiting for us.  There’s been another one.  Near the Tower this time.  SH
Mycroft closed the lid, inserted the tool into the keyhole and leaned over the box.  “Locked,” he said after the first click.  “There,” he said after the ninth.  “It will open with my substitute key now.”  Mycroft withdrew the device and held the box out to Sherlock.
“What do you make of the lab results?”
…I saw the mighty walls rushing asunder—there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters—and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the “House of Usher.”
“Firearms do not work all the time,” he said as the panel swung open.  “More than six hundred years back and it has to be a bow or a pike or a blade.”  After a few steps, he stopped.  There was a sharp click and the wall gave way to a view of the library.  It felt like returning home.
“The harp he loved ne’er spoke again, for he tore its chords asunder.
“I wonder if they’ve exchanged
Even so, I thought I should offer to help her and leaned forward.  I clapped my hand over my mouth and groaned.
My eyes wandered back to the hearth.
“He gave up blood; too easy to obtain these days he says.”  Sherlock turned us around.    “Dread and panic are his sustenance now.  He inhales despair; claims it is the headiest perfume.  He’s cultivated an addiction to it, craves stronger and stronger doses.  Brought to despair, he thinks I would be particularly intoxicating.”
“Yoohoo.”
I went to my room for a jacket and came back to the library.  I considered going down to the kitchen and up the way I had most recently used, but I was not sure the various inner doors I would need to pass through would be unlocked at this time of night and thought I could remember the route we had taken from the ballroom equally well.  It took me three tries to find the correct volume to pull down to open the bookcase and reach the music room, but after that delay, my progress was smooth.  I did have to stand on a stool to open the panel between the minstrel galleries though.
“I couldn’t breathe when I woke up.  It was too dark in here.  I wanted light.”  John paused.  “In the sitting room the fire had gone out.”
“Good-night, Corporal,” I said.
“Later,” I answered with a grin.  “You bought milk.”
He began gathering the garments.  He had left me with the drawers though.  He looked at them now and I pulled my dressing gown closed.  “I’ll bring more of those since you like them so well,” he said with a smirk.  “They don’t chafe, do they?”
“You asked for fire,” John said.
I had succeeded in eliciting a few, but solemn and intent had more often been Sherlock’s expression and I had applied myself all the harder because of it.  The diagrams of the dances where burnt into my brain; the music he played for me, memorised; the feel of the movements he’d taught me becoming second nature to my muscles.  I had slept, but it hadn’t been much and I had danced in my dreams, with him mostly, but sometimes alone around two swords as in the dance he had shown me just before dinner.
Sherlock smiled.  “Very.”
“My husband, Frank,” she replied, her eyes fixed on the card, which she’d stopped waving about and had cupped in the palm of her hand.  “He was so beautiful on the outside.”  With her forefinger she stroked the image on the card.  “It took me far too many years to realise he wasn’t nearly so beautiful on the inside.”
Sherlock snatched the violin away.
I twisted around.  Barely visible next to the door, was a bracket, and in its metal basket…something.  I reached up, grasped the something…a wooden something, and pulled it out.
I don't know.   He doesn’t seem to be.
He lifted his hand, taking mine with it, his fingers slipping down to my wrist.  He pressed his lips to my knuckles.  “You speak more clearly with these sometimes…or with your gun.”
Sherlock appeared from the bushes, leaves in hair and cap in hand.  He held it out to me.  It was brimming with berries, red and purple and black.
Sherlock drew the cap away, took a raspberry from the top and offered it to me.
I shook my head.
He selected a currant next and fed it to me, then a blueberry, a blackberry, another raspberry, a gooseberry.  Their tastes flashed across my tongue.
Was I going to play?
I started up, blinking.  “Sherlock,” I gasped.
“You have questions,” he said and raised his bow.  His tone was cool; he did not turn around.
My legs aren’t sore enough for that and my feet don’t hurt at all.
“One would have hoped the director of the museum might have,” Sherlock replied, “even if he is relatively new.”  He held up one hand, fingers splayed.  “The nearly life-size silver swan centrepiece…”  His forefinger went down.  “The Renaissance pendant in the shape of a swan…”  His thumb bent over it.  “The Swan Tiara…”  Middle finger down.  “The costume Anna Pavlova wore for the premiere of
Sherlock walked to the edge of the windowsill then flew past John, black wings blending into the shadows.  Sherlock alit on one of the branches plastered into the wall above the bed, a trail of chemicals swirling behind him.
“Oh!”
,  “owl’s”,
A mug landed with a thump on the night table, a plate landed more gently next to it.
“Not exactly.  She offered to put her address in my phone, but I emailed it to my work address and said I’d get her a copy on the Monday,” John said.  “I’ve become rather picky about who touches my phone.”
“We have plenty of time,” I said, because I felt it then, that we did, and the words I spoke had the lilt of the song I had been humming.
I did as he suggested, wiggling forwards so my shoulders and arms hung over the gentle slope of the bank.
“Good.”  My hand slid to the back of his neck and I rose on my toes once more.  He didn’t move away this time and I suckled and nipped at those soft, fine lips until he clutched me so tightly, I didn’t need my feet for support at all.
“Arms down,” he said and I admired the snowfall that drifted from my shoulders when my head emerged.
“Damn right,” I said.  “I’m his doctor, his friend, his doctor...Sherlock.”  I was holding his wrist too tightly to take his pulse.  I forced myself to loosen my fingers.  Closed my eyes to feel, to shut out all the blood except what was inside.  What was inside was what mattered.
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock said, holding the thorn up for me to inspect.  It was dry and brown, an inch long, thick at the base and needle thin at the end.  It looked as though it had come out whole.
The faint sound of laughter came across the water.
I would know.
The wound closed.  He set my arm back on my thigh.
I saw the dark marks on his cheek then.  I reached up without asking leave and felt the blood half-dried along the scratches.  The tips of my fingers were smeared with it when I pulled them away.
The cloth began to smoulder.
"Take this," Lestrade said, holding the lantern out to me.
“Did you?”  Sherlock regarded me.  “It took me quite some time.”
“Woof.”
I pushed backwards into the crowd and they gave way.
“How long have those branches been plastered into the walls?” John asked.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock thought.  “Your jumpers are safe.”
I stared at the wall.  I could not perceive any change and did not feel like getting up to check.
“I looked for you on other nights.”
Sherlock tilted his head down as he listened, brows furrowed, then he nodded, and Siròc took flight.
“If you would raise your arms,” said the voice of Wiggins, who had apparently retreated to the bed and returned behind me while I was lost in contemplation of my new undergarment.
I took a step back from the heat.  “But how did you know I was dying?”
Willpower and the exiting throng prevailed.  They bore me past the corner and over the road, leaving me washed up against the damp walls of Lloyd’s when they split three ways and thinned out.  I lingered there, back pressed against the cold stone, out of the bustle of the footpath, and watched the lights at the intersection cycle from green to amber to red and back.  The vehicles crept forwards or halted according to their signals while the pedestrians streamed off the pavement, flooding between the cars, ignoring the danger, the traffic lights and me.
“I had no idea,” I said.
,  “feather,”
Puck flopped onto the grass.
“Your part is simple, crucial, but simple.  At first you kneel on one knee, a couple metres from me, clapping in time with the beat of the music.  You watch me, keep your eyes on me.  Can you do that, for me?”
I looked skyward.  At the top of the towering oak, Siròc was still perched.
“No, no I won’t,” John said.  “Thanks for coming up.”
John sat up enough to crack his cookie open over the table.  “How do they get the bespoke fortunes in?”
“We can give you a bit of a push up,” Greg called.
“You did not.” The shadow drew closer.  The sides of its garment parted as it  walked, a pale leg gleaming for a moment before disappearing into the dark folds once more.
"Pleased to meet you," I said and snapped my mouth shut.  Speaking and looking up had been a bit too much.
“So how?”
“Right. Yes.”  I hurried after him, trying to place the era from the armaments.
Hey, blood loss.
The night had turned darker.  Clouds blanketed the stars; the moon was but a faint smudge low in the sky. I thought my partial drying out might soon be undone.  I caught up with the cart as it turned onto the pier.
“The Manor’s been altered a lot over the years, John,” Mrs Hudson said.
The light in the hall came on.
I glared at him instead and he laughed.
“Eat.”
The boatman headed out to the middle of the river.
She shook her head.  “Once he had been there just before I noticed the man, but the loaf of bread I’d been sharing out was finished and I was fussing in my bag to open a packet of bird seed and answering some questions a woman taking photos of the birds had asked me and he swam away.  I looked up and he was all the way to the other side of the pond and then I lost sight of him amidst another group of birds.  I’d hoped he would come back when he saw I was still handing out food, but he didn’t.”
Sherlock stopped speaking and turned, his face aglow.  “I’m going to be with you again, very soon.”
Sherlock’s arm slipped through mine.  We resumed our descent.
I suppose it is.
I eased myself inside.  “When it has to be.”
John tilted his head.  “I can hear his wings.”
In the refrigerator, I needed to nudge aside a fresh pint of milk to fit in the half gallon jug I had bought. Seeing it was stranger than seeing body parts in there.  I finished stowing the groceries, grabbed a yellow apple and sauntered into the sitting room, rubbing it against my shirt as I went.
“It’s been centuries,” Sherlock said.  “Three eggs, a larger than usual clutch.  They’re going to be busy for a while.”  He set the bowl on the bench.
She turned her head and considered me afresh.
Sherlock stood, spear poised over the side that had been obviously the south bank when last I could see the land.
Sherlock no longer swooped or flapped his wings.  He glided slowly downwards.  “There is something else you need to know first,” he said.
Sherlock fluttered to the coffee table when he heard the water pelting the walls, unbuttoned his coat as he regarded the items there.  “Such modest wishes, John,” he said.  It had been satisfying granting them unasked, not even formulated, simply plucked from John’s dreams.  Sherlock glanced at the bathroom door.  “What made you give up on wishes, John?”
“…the swans,” Ms Swann finished.  “Although they stay at a distance when a lot of people are swimming.  I used to think they were judging our style.”
“I don’t know,” Ms Swann replied.  “I haven’t seen him since.”
I nodded at Kit and he moved towards them.  I followed behind in the torch’s light.  After us, Bert and Wiggins fell in.
“Rest assured, Mr Corvus, that if it is legally possible to do so, we will protect the lady’s honour and yours as well,” Holmes said.
“She was tired,” I said.
He left me to it and I hummed at the place where the bolt had pierced the oak.  The wood parted.  When I stood, sliding the bolt into the quiver, he dropped a cloak over my shoulders.  “Since it’s cold on the river,” he said, pivoting towards the column with the torch.  He reclaimed it with one hand and grabbed a hooked spear from the assortment near it with the other.
I set my bowl aside, grabbed a handful of his curls and guided his head down to my lap.
John laughed a bitter laugh.  “Easy as that, is it?”
John put an asterisk by his earlier note.
“Would you like that, John?”  The hand that wasn’t gripping mine appeared on my thigh.
I studied him over the china.  Although the hollows of his cheeks were not nearly so pronounced, the shadows about his eyes remained.  He was not sleeping well; a fact to which the music I heard at all hours attested.  He paced as he played.  The music waxed and waned as he circled the room.  I heard it, that was, when I did not sleep through it, assuming, of course, that he played whether I was awake to hear it or not.  I frowned.  I was theorising without data on that.
Sherlock sniffed, paused, sniffed again.  “Sulphur,” he said, “probably from pyrite.  You called it up from the clay in a precise formation and set it in motion.  I am impressed.”
“If that’s what I’ve been smelling, I’d say it works.”  I pressed my mouth to his skin.
“Not that I could see, but there was a swan in the water, swimming west.”
If I wrote the instant I awoke, I sometimes caught a glimpse of where I'd been in my dreams.  For so long, they had eluded me entirely.
“Is that right?” I asked.
“Oh…” I said, still searching my memory.
I turned at the strain in his voice to find his shoulders hanging further over the gunwale.
“I didn’t.  I…guessed.”
“Oh, it’s a private vineyard.  Vernet was Sherlock’s grandmother’s maiden name,” Mrs Hudson said.
handsome.”  She winked at John.
He was seated, flipping through more of the papers I had brought home when I returned to the kitchen.  My drawing was on the table.
The flame flickered in its little glass pot.
Once arrived, Mr Braithewaite had settled Sherlock and I in his waiting room and with apologies to us, had taken only Adamantine and Corvus into his office.  Our client had grown even paler than he had been at being separated from us and Sherlock had had to assure him we would be waiting when he was finished.  As soon as the office door shut, Sherlock said he would go downstairs for a word with the hansom driver and I said I hoped Corvus would not call for him until he had returned.
“For me?”
Another woman ran from the woods, her hair already loose, her cloak streaming behind her.  She caught the first lady by the waist and spun her round, then pressed her against the oak tree with a passionate kiss.  Her cape fell.  The moonlight shone on the swell of her arse.
John giggled as Sherlock’s nose tickled beneath his arm.  “Ah, I don’t think the deodorant is meant to be ingested.”
The music resumed.  The sound of the grand harp, with the barest accompaniment from a flute, rained down on the room and I hoped it was Mrs Hudson playing and that somehow she was watching out for us, even if she had been sort of experimenting on me.
“Let’s not leave it for so long next time,” Greg replied.
“My apologies.  Dean Bradley, allow me to introduce my dear friend and colleague, John Watson,” Sherlock said.  “Doctor Watson, George Bradley, Dean of Westminster.”
My hand drifted to my chest.  I pressed against the wool, felt the outline of the silver case that held several photographs instead of cigarettes.  At one time or another, they had graced the inner pocket of every coat I owned, even my smoking jacket.  They had been as a talisman to me.
He’s never asked me to take his.
“We’re having a joint hallucination?” I asked.
Silently, the door swung open.
It struck me, for a moment, with something akin to snow blindness.  Anyone would agree that Sherlock is pale, but the skin below those tantalising glimpses of his throat he provides, is so fair it is bright.  I rubbed my thumb along the top of the pad I was holding.  I wanted to test that that snowy skin was warm.  It looked cool, like marble.
The hand vanished.
“So you started work here and then moved to the States?” I asked.
Until I’d been shot, my private life had always been rather active, though in the spring a young man’s fancy and all that.  “Well, yeah, but not like this.”
The sky was growing pale in the east when we returned to Baker Street.
Mycroft stroked one of his long antennae with his free hand.  “All their secrets floating through the air for anyone to hear,” he mused,  his antennae waving gently above his head.  “It is sometimes useful to know them.”
“It’s not one of my stronger skills.”
She nodded and started up.
I clenched my fingers around his.
My life would quickly fade away.”
"Yes," I said and went to him.
Above the inky water, the day dawned, grey and still.  Fog wreathed the river’s banks and shrouded the shores of its island.  Clouds obscured the setting of the moon and the rising of the sun.  Out of the mist, a swan as dark as the water glided into the open.  He dipped his head, then stretched it skyward, black eyes scanning the clouds.  He snorted, spread his raven-dark wings and beat them against the twilit air.  They lifted him until he stood upon the water’s surface and their sound echoed across the river.  With each wingbeat, he declared the watery domain to be his and invited a mate to come and rule it with him.  His wingbeats slowed; he sank back into the water.  With wings still half-raised, he listened for an answer.
“Excellent.  This could be an eight, or even better.  John, you’ll be an artist travelling with his model.  You accept commissions for nude portraits upon application from very exclusive clients only.  Anyone who has not heard of you is clearly not in the know,” he said, warming to the idea.  “That should attract the interest of the same people who attract other sorts of attention and the nudity could explain why no one will have seen your portraits displayed in board rooms or drawing rooms.”
She put the bit of paper near my plate and poured some milk in her cup.  “Chalfont Court wasn't built until 1913.”
“It hasn’t been easy being inconspicuous on this street for nearly half an hour.”
I inhaled lazily when he lifted his lips from mine, as though breathing were optional.
“Best not to get ahead of the data,” Holmes cautioned.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed.  “Since university.”
“It’s healed,” he said.
“No wings for me, then.”
“I only know where the test samples are,” I said.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes, indeed.
Somewhere in his mind, the words had registered.  He felt himself changing.  Only his parents and Mycroft had ever been able to make him do that and they had lost the power when he was fully fledged.  Alarm flowed hot upon the thought and his wings fluttered, but he was pressed to John's side, his tongue deep in John’s mouth and it was difficult to focus on anything else.
Its door was shut.  The hall quiet.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow.
I set off after her.
His eyes dropped to my mouth.
“WC,” he said and stood before me again.
One of Sherlock’s hands clasped John’s arm, the other reached back and gripped John’s hip.
I hummed the opening tune.  The bedroom door opened.
I couldn’t argue.  I often wound myself around him, like a vine climbing up a tree, so long and lovely.
“A lot of research on shape-shifters?” John asked. “Scientific literature?”
“These are delicate situations, assuredly,” I said, “but they happen.  People have pasts.  If there was a responsibility he wished you to discharge in his stead, he needed to let you know how to go about it.”
Wind rattled the sitting room windows in their frames.  I opened one eye and squinted at them.  It was unreasonable to be so irked by the weather, an overcast day in London at any season was no rare thing, but Holmes was not the only resident of 221B Baker Street to have moods.  I took a deep breath and set my book on the side table.  I surveyed the landscape of our sitting room, leeched of colour in the watery light.  Several new items that Holmes had brought back from our sunlit adventure were strewn about, a couple still boxed.  He was ensconced at his chemistry table, examining the contents of the smallest parcel, apparently suffering none of the usual symptoms of ennui that so often dogged the heels of a recently completed case.  Beyond him, raindrops trickled down the windowpanes.
I pulled my gun from my waistband.  The animal leapt into the air as I was sighting, landed on Baskerville and the two rolled across the grass, a mass of indistinguishable black fur.
A mighty paw came down on his back.
“Well, I can’t sing as skilfully as Sherlock,” Greg said.
"Roasted boar," I replied promptly, surprised at the vivid image of the huge animal on a spit in a huger fireplace that had risen before my mind's eye.
“The invites and all the instructions.  You should have seen the uproar as they were reading them.”
Shut the bloody fuck up.  You are not helping here.
Mr Holmes crossed the floor, lifted a cushion on a bench near where we had entered the room.
Sherlock held the map by its top corners and eased it away from the wall.  “Mike must have been pleased that his gamble paid off.”
He lingered by John’s bed.  “You led me to the right spot, like a beacon.”  He pulled the duvet over John’s shoulder, drew on his gloves and turned away.
“I’ll ask her about that.  I had a song for learning the names of all the bones,” I said.
The spinning slowed.
The skewered leech released Sherlock’s flesh and raised its empty maws.  Smoke curled up from them and I thought I heard bells jangling.  When the smoke wafted past me, I gagged.
The flame grew.
“You have a specific half smile for when people admire your literary efforts,” he replied.  “Mind the push pins when you sit.”
Well, I would have thought someone over there would have needed my services by now and I would have discovered their existence that way.
He must have done something to turn down the volume for me then, because my head no longer rang with the noise.
“I didn’t think anybody would actually read my blog,” John said, looking away.
“Imbecility and impossibility, a great combination.”
Walking was a winding affair.  The periphery of the woods was lit by a ring of campfires, the strip of flattened grasses between them and the trees filled with stacks of kindling, and heaps of sacks and satchels from which people were withdrawing food to be cooked or blankets and shawls for chilled backs.  Children toddled or ran depending on their ages, while adults kept them from tumbling into the fires.  Conversations rose like smoke punctuated by flashes of song.  It was a convivial space, but not conducive to rapid movement.
Sherlock’s eyes slid towards John.
John turned to find…Mary…thank God for name tags…holding out his mug to him.
“That’s true,” I agreed, studying him in turn.  He was a noble study, with his long legs crossed, one hand on the dog’s enormous head, the other resting on the arm of his chair - a commander at his ease.
“Anything else?  A photo of her in a wallet that you glimpsed?”
He stumbled.
Greg looked at Sherlock.
His eyelids lowered at that and the corner of his lips curled up.
“You lost sight of him on the bridge,” Sherlock amended.
My hands reached out for it without a thought.  They itched to mould themselves around its tiller, feel its weight-in-hand.  I hefted it.  It was for me.  I sighted along the bolt channel.  I had seen modern cross-bows used, but never shot one myself, and yet my hands knew this elegant ancestor of theirs.
I turned my attention from the raucous cock reluctantly.  Small or not, it seemed better to keep him in view.
“Is Chapalu going with them?”
“Since you can hear them, we’ll have to go this year.”
I glanced down.  One of the rings had a pale, round stone set between pairs of heart-shaped leaves.  Morning glories have leaves like that.  I flushed.  The stone had surely come from the clay.  I took it up first.
I finished the toast and raised the cover from a steaming plate of scrambled eggs, rashers and sausage and fried tomato and mushrooms.
“I am glad, dear,” Mrs Hudson said, watching me keenly.
The logs only smoked.
There was no hint of humour in his words.  He looked pensive.
"Something very old and very recently dead.  Brilliant.  See you soon."  Sherlock snapped his mobile shut and looked around.
This time he chuckled and pushed my garment higher onto my back.
“The farewells, John.  We must be present for them.  They’re not interminable, but they do often feel that way.”
“Let’s see what’s waiting on the other side first.  It’s a very good barrier,” Sherlock said.
The falcon plucked the strip of meat from the dish and flew to the end of the curtain rail above the balcony doors to eat it.  Snack consumed, she darted out the tilted pane of stained glass over the doors.
I noticed the small, brass key that Sherlock tucked into his pocket.
I smoothed a hand over his hip and between his legs.  At the small of his back, I nuzzled and kissed; reached around to stroke, fingertips feathering from root to tip of his cock.
I opened my eyes. He was putting his violin away.
“Don’t, then,” John said, reaching out with his thumb to grasp his cock as well.  They slipped against one another in his oily grip.
Despite a good view of how far it was to the ground, I scrambled about and settled against him, temple brushing against his cheek.  He was already commenting about the guests departing from the portion of the landing visible from our perch.
The music grew gentle, the drumbeat muffled, steady.
His expression was blank for a moment, then one corner of his mouth turned up.  “Find any instructions?”
I heard the hiss of water boiling, saw Sherlock walking back.
A drop of rain hit my face then another.  I checked the sky; could not see a thing.  Even Sherlock, half a metre away from me was hidden by the darkness.  The rain began to patter on the wood of the boat.  There was a faint ripple as Sherlock dipped the oars.  Ahead of us, an orange light hung in the dark.
He took my hand in both of his.  “First Fire.  Well done.  I’m sorry I couldn’t have joined you and Sherlock for it.”
“He might make it back in time.  The moon won’t be visible over the housetops for a while yet,” Mrs Hudson said, bustling past me to open the second door and ushering me deeper inside.
“You’re in your own realm now, John,” he said and pressed home in one long slide.
Holmes stretched out his hand.  “The other papers you have for us,” he said.
Sherlock is still asleep.
Sherlock smiled, put down his hammer and picked up a pair of tongs.  “No one to tell,” he said.
The stone felt somewhat unsteady beneath my feet and I wanted to protest the use of my full name.  I have never cared for it.  Instead, I heard myself saying, “For how long?”
Mrs Hudson smoothed down his hair.  “I’ll go get those ginger biscuits, shall I?”
“…someone finally put a stake through his heart,” I supplied.
My brows drew together.
I considered the career I had had.  The thousands of lives that had been placed in my hands.  Would having only a few to care for be enough for me?
“No,” John agreed.
“He was,” I replied.  “He asked me to thank you for timing it so well.”
Perched upon the top rail of the footboard of my bed was the peregrine.  She turned her head and studied me.
“What about the Tube?” I asked.
Sherlock shut the door of the wet room behind us.  "Does she ever come hunting with me, you mean?" he said, turning on the water.
“What will the artist draw?” Sherlock prompted.
“Of course, with me.”
“So, I had asked the question about which I tried not to think when I wrote up the story of your death or read through my old notebooks to check a fact or…well…I sat there, at that table, and waited to hear what this clever lady would come up with to say to that.  I steeled myself for it because whatever it was, it was going to hurt to hear your name in her mouth, in that room of the bereaved and the abandoned seeking to converse with the dead.
Clearly, I could.
For two days straight, we danced.  That’s how it seemed anyway.  There were naps and meals in there somewhere.  Every few hours, irresistible food would arrive.  Clearly, I was holding my own as some inexplicable priority in the frenzied kitchen.  We would sit on a couple of the stools along the wall at the firing range and eat off the trays brought to us.  Well, I would eat, and Sherlock would nibble and talk about what constituted a well-executed dance of whatever type we had just been practising.
I sputtered.  "Well, that would also cure whatever ailed you."
“I didn’t re..alise,” she said.
His reflection grew.  It loomed over me.
Sherlock was stood by his chair, taking his jacket off, revealing the purple shirt underneath.  He draped his jacket over a desk chair and took a step closer to me.
John glanced between them, saw the narrow focus of Sherlock’s gaze.  Sometimes John wondered whether Sherlock saw the shift in chemicals in people’s bloodstreams when he stared at them like that.
“I doubt she’s realised how much you can read into the most ordinary things,” John said, following, albeit a bit less nimbly.  “After she rang off, I went back to the bridge, to check on Suspect No. 2.”
“And you?” I asked, my hands taking an exploratory survey of his torso and arms.  I didn’t feel any injuries there, got up on my knees and explored lower.
~~~~~~oo0oo~~~~~~
It was not very decorous, and I could have used the caffeine, but it was just as well.
I cleared my throat.
I wondered if Mike knew Dr Hooper, the younger.  “Does her mother live here?” I asked.  The list of residents I had not yet met was growing.
“As we approached them, the door was opened and a white-haired servant bowed us into a tastefully-appointed foyer where two ladies of middle years were already waiting.  We apparently completed the party, for we were all led through a curtained archway, down a gas-lit hallway to a high-ceilinged parlour of otherwise moderate dimensions.  Beyond its bay windows a small garden could be vaguely discerned in the deepening twilight.”
Sherlock’s hand was on my shoulder.  “What did you see?” he asked.
“Well, you wouldn’t,” he said from the landing.
“How have I not seen this?”
“Where the hell did you come from?” he shouted.  He banged the drawer and the wardrobe door shut.  “No dining on my jumpers, you!” he said, snapping the towel at the ceiling.
I drew one arm out from behind him and half sat up.  “All that cold fresh air must have done it,” I murmured then remembered breakfast.  “And all the food.”
His arm rested upon my shoulders.  He drew it away and seemed momentarily unsteady.
It is not a cheery song and yet the words had appealed to me the first time I heard them sung as a boy.   I had found the poem in the library and committed it to heart.  I think I amended my plan to be a doctor to being an army doctor then.  I had healed my comrades instead of singing to them, except when I was very drunk or sometimes in the shower, until the army had sent me away, my chords torn asunder.
“If I’m not too long, we can go over some of them later this evening, if I am, we can begin at breakfast tomorrow.  You must be here.”
My eyes opened wide.
I nodded.  Mrs Hudson took it as a confirmation of the breakfast menu.
“I have some scones you can take with you.  I’ll leave them on the mantel,” Mrs Hudson said.  “Don’t fall back to sleep.”
I thought about that a minute.  “All right, but I’ll come cut it and carry the basket down for you.”
“I had wondered, too, whether you’d want to stay in the grove,” he said quietly.  “Whether you’d say yes if I asked you to return with me.”
“Deigning to aid Mycroft has its perks,” Sherlock replied.
“There,” he said, handing my mobile back.  “I have your number and you have mine.  I prefer to text and do so at all hours.  Sometimes I don’t speak a word for days.  Four weeks's advance wages have been transferred to your current account.  Further transfers will be made fortnightly.  If, at any time during the coming month, you decide you do not wish to live here as our resident physician and my personal assistant, an amount equal to a month’s salary will be wired to your account as severance pay and we will part ways.”
There’s plenty in the fridge in the lab.
I trod on his toes again.  A huff of breath escaped him.  I felt it on my forehead.
“Right,” John said.  “I’ve got used to them, though I did warn Mike the first time he visited.”
I wished it still bled.  I wished.  I bit his lip – hard.
John had been absent when Sherlock first arrived.  He had made a cursory inspection, took note of the dwindling rose light emanating from the flue, sampled the blooming flowers on the boughs above John’s bed with satisfaction and decamped to the rooftop over the road.  John’s nest without John in it was unsettling.
John glanced down at the sound.  “Right.  OK, what did you do to distract him from his prey?”
John reached over Sherlock’s shoulder and clicked back through the images and then forwards again.
Lestrade's gaze shifted to Sherlock.  "Some ocean fish trying the hunting upstream?  A shark, maybe?" Lestrade asked.
The mist shrouding the far bank was lifting as dawn approached, revealing the animals and carriages waiting under the trees by the road there.  Wisps of fog broke away and swirled over the water, hiding the ferryman’s boat for a few moments as it crossed, leaving the disembodied voices of the passengers to mark their progress to those waiting on the steps or about the terrace for their turns.
Ms Swann’s eyes brightened.
John nodded again, the motion slower than before.  “Would you tell me your true name?” he whispered, sleep dragging at his words.
On a bed of fig-leaves,
He squeezed into the space between her and the arm of the sofa.  “She gave it to you in exchange for an introduction to John.”
The envelope was thick.  When I picked it up from the floor, even with my less specialised knowledge, I could tell the stationery was fine, more cloth than paper.  The flap was sealed with black wax, imprinted with a bird.  Upon turning it over, I saw that it was addressed to both Holmes and me.
“You can see or you can feel it?” he asked.
“Sleep was never your thing, then,” I remarked, glancing out the window and picturing him in the shadow of one of the tall urns bursting with forsythia and hyacinths and overflowing with ivy.  Unbidden, I imagined a wild-eyed boy crouched next to him.  I shook my head to chase the vision away and wondered if I’d been bold enough to knock on the door as a lad and stay put when I heard the latch being undone, if I could have met Sherlock then; if I could have been the one with whom he made his youthful discoveries.
“No worries, dear.”
His methods might be familiar to me, but I have not perfected their use.
I moved to assist, the feature of interest obvious once we had the body on its side.
John placed a fingertip by Sherlock’s head.  Sherlock rested his front legs on it and stung shallowly.  John lifted his finger, Sherlock clung to it.
The restaurant’s a modern building.
In the dark behind his closed lids, John followed the progress of the small stings.  He thought they had a colour that spread out around the point of penetration like the radiance of a light.  And he tasted them, too, especially on his lips and his tongue, like a spice, only not one he knew.  He thought he might be able to taste them with his fingertips as well, but he dare not move his hand for fear of breaking a leg or crushing a wing.  He wanted to trace the line of bites around his nipples, follow the path being taken to his cock.  Cautiously, he shifted his legs farther apart.
Ms Swann nodded and looked at John.  “But they are the Australian variety.”  She patted the bridge of her nose.  “With the red beaks.”
My heart thudded, my respiration came fast.  I knew this feeling and thought I would never know it again.  “Does one get a second chance?” I whispered beside a bookcase that was out of alignment by a centimetre or so.  “Drop your clues, play your game as long as you’re inviting me to play, too.”  I insinuated my fingers into the crack and widened it.  Through the gap, a melody half strange and half familiar issued, trembling along a violin’s highest notes.  I eased the bookcase open wider.  Blackness greeted me.
I rubbed my hand over my jaw.  “You sure about that?”
“Puck remains dazzled by the glamour of the court.  It’s why I didn’t keep him on for the final stage of his apprenticeship,” Mycroft said.  “I wouldn’t have tutored him in the first place if Father had not insisted.  Wrong temperment.  Eventually, Father saw the error of his decision.”
I rested the clay pot on my knees, hands still clasped around it.  “I suppose I should have come down to the kitchen and done this there.”
To those patient souls who may read this, I apologise.  It's been more than a year since the last chapter and that, although not a record for me, is far from what I intended when I set out to write a four-chapter second series in the span of a month.  (Please take safety measures to not fall from your seat laughing.)  Now, at least, I can tell you that the ball comes to an end!
The body's remaining hand was clutched tight and I thought there was something clasped in it.
My arm tightened across his lower back and pressed him closer.
Wiggins reached out for Sherlock’s torch, then stood to his side holding it.
Final blessings intoned, the service concluded.  Sherlock went to Corvus and took his arm.  He sagged against Sherlock and I managed to see the spirit in need rather than the beautiful man.  “Please bring a sprig of lilac,” he said as the other people filed out the door.  “Roderick had a large bouquet of them in his rooms.  I don’t know where they grew even when it wasn't winter.  I never saw a garden that was more than statuary, yew and ivy from the windows nor any hint of a conservatory."  Corvus smiled.  "He said the lilac’s fragrance transported him to fairer realms.”
“As a child, he would run along here,” Mycroft said.  “It’s how he first fle…”  He interrupted himself.  “Shall we?” Mycroft gestured towards the crowd.
“But this one was too intense to suppress?” Sherlock asked, raising an eyebrow.
When voices began to be heard from within the towers by the gate, Sherlock joined us to say that Mato refused to take us outside the city walls through the cemetery beyond, however, he had been amenable to exchanging the cart and the net for the rest of the pennies and our cloaks, which had been serving to cover the creature.
Puck’s hand flew to his ear.  He pinched his lobe.  “I do, sire, but I forgot today.”
“Messages?” Back to the one word questions.
There was a thunk.  Inside the box, something slid into a place where it had not been in a very long time and when I tried it, the lid yielded to my hand.
The bathroom door closed behind us.
She patted his shoulder.  “There just might be a few left in the kitchen.  You come down later and we’ll see what we can find.”
And then he was gone.
I may have dozed, surfeited with wine and meat.  I awoke, head against Sherlock’s thigh, to the sound of his voice calling my name.
“So you’ve told me since I was in my cradle, but you chose politics as your arena this time round,” Sherlock retorted with a laugh.  “I think that says enough, but in case your powers have waned even further since you made that decision, please recall, I have been immune to you since I was born and will continue to be.  You hold no sway over knowledge, much as you try.  Even you, cannot kill an idea."  Sherlock's gaze flashed over his brother.  "He is mine.”
“When you’re ready, spread your wings and busk as loud as you can. Then, I will.”  He swam off a short way to allow room.
“I wanted to bellow, Holmes.  What a shipload of poppycock.  You’ve accused me of romanticising what you do, but I could never come close to that level of tinfoil-gilt, fairy-tale nonsense.”
“Plenty of deer and the wolves that hunt them,” she said.
It was the last thought I recalled having.
I went to the kitchen to make another cup of tea, listened for signs of returning life.  Heard none, clicked on the kettle.
“And what did you learn?” Holmes prompted.
The theatre was awash in electric light.  I was not sure I preferred it to gaslight or the even kinder glow of candlelight, but it was probably safer.
I stayed up late in the library, loathe to abandon my work until the words started to run together on my laptop screen and my weary eyes sought relief in the gentle shift of the shadows along the walls and in the far corners of the room.
Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I really knew little of my friend. His reserve had been always excessive and habitual. I was aware, however, that his very ancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognizable beauties, of musical science.
An odd mixture of relief and trepidation overtook me.  “A family trait,” I whispered back and climbed the last few steps to ease open the narrow door at the top.  When we slid aside the middle panel that connected the music room and ballroom galleries, a murmur ran through the crowd below us.  We walked rapidly along the ballroom gallery and disappeared into the door on the other side that led down to the ballroom.  “Was I imagining that?” I asked as we descended.
I thought that a good sign.
He gaped.  "You are becoming a good assistant," he said to me.  "You might have told me you were already in the area," he said to Sherlock.
“Never,” Ms Swann confirmed.
“Did you get milk?”
With that, he pulled away, his fingertips gliding across my chest and down my arm, and then he was gone.
I wrenched my gaze away from the star-scattered heavens and scanned the wide meadow in which we stood.  It was ringed with trees in all directions, but the way we had come.  I turned around.  Here the trees stopped well below the hilltop, leaving the view open to the south.  I saw only the crowns of trees and a vast field of stars.  One streaked across the sky.
“Death to gate crashers?”
“Good,” she said and put the swan pot to one side and picked up another shiny one.  “Bronze, this one.  Very old.  Served us well.  Particularly good for battle injuries.”
I closed the lid and turned the box towards her.  The metal strip atop the lid was still pushed aside.
“Are you a pathologist?” I asked.  All those years of multitasking under stressful conditions were paying off.
I didn’t look down.  “You know you do overdo sometimes,” I said.
“Chapalu’s been busy,” Greg replied before swooping down and capturing the tart.  “Every year, I forget how good these are, especially with this.”  He took a long drink of wine and looked over at me.  “Pity you and Sherlock missed it last year.”
I watched them talk.
Madame Willow asked them to tell her more of their son.
Holmes rustled his newspaper.  “But you haven’t been away.”
As they watched, the swan opened his wings, rising out of the water far enough that his feet slapped at its surface as he ran forward and then took to the air.  Once aloft, he circled back over the bridge and flew west.
Sherlock’s hands dropped to his lap, his gaze dropping with them.  “I’ve been working on the rings for a few months.  You were going to need them at some point.”  He picked up an odd-sized band from the cushion, began rolling it between his fingers.  “I started on the others as soon as the plan for this ball was visited on us.  You’ll…”
Holmes smiled.  “Carry on,” he said as he took the heated beaker off the flame with a pair of long, metal tongs.
“Who would have made that connection other than you?” I asked.
I stepped back.  My heel hit the cushions and I sat.  “All right,” I breathed, still watching.
“Are some places here
He drew in a sharp breath.  “A contaminated one will do.  Any one.  Quickly.  Please.”
My face grew hot.  “Yes, yes.  Sorry, Mrs Hudson.”  I kicked a wad of crumpled paper across the landing.  “I just can’t find something.”
“The wood was here.  I keep strong pieces until I know what to use them for.”
I drew in a breath and loaded a bolt by their light.
I glanced at his feet.  He wasn’t standing on the floor.
John finished his pint and grinned.  “Another round?”
~~~~~~o0o~~~~~~
“Yes,” he said, “yes, it can.  Tuck yourself back in.”
Sherlock turned to me.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock squeezed the berry and licked the juice off his fingers.  “You know I delete as much about court as possible.”  He dropped the pulp of the berry.  “Still bored.”
I peered around the trunk of my shielding tree.
Task completed, only a thin slice of blue-tinged light from the slightly open laboratory door held off the dark.
He had noticed the little pot the day the old bookseller disappeared in my study and I had fainted.  I am not embarrassed at my response.  I would not have been ashamed of an even more intense reaction, but I had witnessed things that had helped prepare me, although I had not credited them at first.  Fortunately, not long after that improbable afternoon, I had the opportunity to establish myself once again at Baker Street and the glue pot had come back with me.
“Yes,” they said in unison.
“It doesn’t have much of a drawstring,” Sherlock replied.
Sherlock leaned back as he began a wilder version of the bridge between verses.  High and higher the notes flew and further back he bent, my supple love.
Holmes glanced towards me.
“Well,” she replied, “while we’re getting to know what agrees with you, I thought it might be best to sit with you.  “That dressing has wine from the Vernet chateau in France.”
“How do you know they aren’t chemicals?” my brain asked.
Judging by the expression on his face, Kit was having similar thoughts as he stood to one side of her, closer to the balustrade.
“Do you think there might be more of the other books in there?” I asked.  His hand returned.
Greg collected more implements, setting them on the tray very quietly.
Apparently, yes.
“Yes,” I whispered.
“How could you change it?”
He turned another page, and another.  There was the butterfly he had caught, his handwriting beneath it.  He had not dared look that far at the shop, had determined he would buy the album after lifting the cover.  John sat.
Who knows?  No, Sherlock knows and I feel it.
Not that I’ve seen.
I rubbed my hand over my face.  “They thought I was going to die,” I said.  “The fever was extremely high.  When I was better, I managed to get a look at my medical records.  Everything they were giving me, to bring the fever down, seemed to be doing the opposite.  Palliative care was prescribed.  And then, the fever broke and I regained consciousness.”  I took a deep breath and let it out slowly.  “What was left of me anyway.”
I smiled.
He flipped it over, watched the sunlight bounce off the silver surface.  Like a mirror.
Mug in hand, I stared down at the last two pages of the article.  The procedure it described had merit; the accompanying photographs irritated me.  What the authors needed were diagrams, clearly drawn, well-labelled.  Too many people think a photograph will always be best, but there are times when the abstraction of art is what is needed to make a concept clear.  Once understood, it can be applied to the real world, which in this case was the heart.
“Time not to be rushed?” I asked, stretching up onto my toes, kissing beneath his ear and his jaw, my breath becoming shorter with each caress.  “I do so hate to rush.” I leaned against him, chest to chest, pressing him into the angle of the walls.
John took a deep breath.  “I would like Sherlock’s favourites,” he said and closed the menu.  “I think you know what they are better than I do.”
I twisted around to look at Sherlock.  “What’s happening?” I whispered.
From the glade, the jingling rose to a crescendo and ceased.
I was making a guess, no a deduction, about that stag being Duneyrr, and a moment later my deduction was confirmed.
“Spell?” I repeated, rather stupidly.  It was a lot to take in.
I put the blueberry in my mouth and cupped my hands to receive them all: translucent and opaque, round or aggregate, red and black, yellow and white.
The pigeons flew away.  The geese fell silent.  The swans settled back into the water.  The man stooped to pick up the loaf of bread, handed it to Ms Swann and appeared to be introducing himself.
Sherlock's sword swung upwards, slicing the limb from the body of whatever creature wielded it.  With a thud, the limb and the spear dropped into the boat.
“From what?”
“But I think these are the real ones.”  He bit into a little berry tart, thought better of it, and shoved the whole of it in his mouth.
Sherlock tilted his head in acknowledgement, without speaking.
Each morning and evening, he had done the same.  The days had rolled by.  The seasons had taken their turns, and yet no whirring flight broke the silence.  No graceful silhouette emerged from the clouds.
“He didn’t tell Father what was in the box,” Sherlock deduced, flitting from the trunk to the low branches that swept to the ground behind Mycroft then back again.  He gazed at his brother.  “Puck didn’t tell you directly.  He wouldn’t be that brazen,” Sherlock buzzed through another circuit, his wings those of a bumblebee.  “So how have you learned of the box’s alleged contents.”  He hovered in front of Mycroft on the wings of a hummingbird hawk-moth.  “Ah.  Mummy.  Puck told his Queen and you ‘overheard’.”
I ran my hand along the top of the case.  “How did you know I’ve always wanted these?” I asked, tilting my head well back to look up at him.  Why I still asked such questions is beyond me.  I know his methods.
I scooped up the pile of clothes at my feet, brought them to him and dumped them in.  "I liked that jacket," I said as Sherlock secured the hatch after them and began the incineration cycle.
“They had wasted no time and set out for Hugh Town within days of our gathering, their son’s letters safely tucked into Mr Morrow’s coat pocket for substantiation of who they were.  Ten days later, they had returned with their son’s remains in a new burial gown and a fine oak coffin they had had made in the town.  Shortly thereafter, they had arranged a service for all their friends and relations to attend and interred their dear boy under the family monument in the parish churchyard.”
“Right.” I breathed out, an expanded map of my surroundings forming in my brain.  “Lead onwards.”
I was slumped in the corner of a cab, my eyes closed, my limbs incredibly glad to be at rest and the muscles of my face stretched into a grin that did not feel as though it would abate any time soon.
“You hadn’t noticed?” she asked.
Madeleine let go of his hand, slipped her arm through his and pulled him closer.
The three men had arrived at the edge of the open space, their faces as brightly lit by the flames as by the sun at midday.  The man in the middle unwound his arms from his companions’ shoulders and turned to face them.  He embraced one of the men, drew back and held his face in both his hands before kissing him thoroughly, then did the same to the other man.  With that, he took his leave, pivoting in place then striding to the pyre.  He scaled it slowly, appearing to think about each handhold before climbing higher.  Around him the burning wood crackled.
Sherlock huffed.  The map was still attached at the bottom corner.
Sherlock was standing in the middle of the kitchen when I got home.  He looked me up and down.  “Forensics wasn’t very informative.”
Their touches echoed on my skin.  They fired my blood and enhanced my disappointment.
He blinked slowly.
Greg snapped his mobile closed.  “Snipers are in position; the subject is covered.  Nothing has been found in her flat nor on the river banks so far.”
Why don’t they help us?
“I knew you’d figure that out.”  John shoved his hands into his pockets.
I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that the stem of the Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.
John’s chest heaved.
His eyes skated over the photographs in the open journal then lingered on the bottom corner of the picture.  “Experimental procedure?” he asked.
My eyes were fixed on him, my fingers finding their own way amid the harp’s strings.
I glanced back at Mycroft.  An eyebrow went up slightly.
I was about to turn my attention back to Mrs Hudson and Kit, when Wiggins folded the cushion back, stepped onto the seat and through the window.  His arm reappeared, goblet in hand.  Bert took it, set both cups aside and followed Wiggins into Summer.
“When I got to the window across the road, you were swallowing the pill.”  John’s voice caught.  “You swallowed the damn pill.”  John thumped the bed, fists clenched.
I love the ground whereon he stands.”
"Hold the torch flat out to the side and duck down," he interrupted, "low arch ahead."
“You play...”  His eyes flickered over John, lingered on his hands, lingered longer on his mouth.  "Woodwind or brass...woodwind, I think.  Less ostentatious.
I did not think the one I sought would be part of this parade.
I moved a quarter circle from where I had started retracing, heel at right angle to toes, jagged steps for a jagged edge, then stepped carefully between our designs in another line towards the centre, where Sherlock knelt.  Precision under pressure.  It was something I knew how to do, although I usually performed with my hands.  When I reached him, I had created two lines, straight as arrows, or the spokes of a wheel, pulsing green with the light of a glow-worm, a very long one.
