There was a whirlwind of work at the garage as people flooded in for holiday oil changes and tune-up sales. Sam called near the end of the week to declare that he had finished his finals. Dean was about halfway through congratulating him when Sam promptly fell asleep on the phone. Dean hung up with a proud smile on his face, but it twisted with guilt as he got ready to go visit Cas.
“No. He left of his own volition a short while ago. Why? Are you looking to capture another alpha with your handsome wiles?” She smiled sharply, her eyes burning like golden flames.
“I'm going to do this, alright?” Dean snapped a little harshly before dragging an apologetic smile on. “So, stop trying to talk me out of it.” he laughed, but they both could hear the anxious undertones. Charlie was one of Dean's oldest friends. She was the one who recommended working at the party when Dean had cracked and told her that he was struggling to get by while trying to support Sammy in college. Charlie sighed but stood up as well, snatching an apple from the snack table beside the door and leading the way into the decorative hall towards the main room. They stopped in front of the large, gilded double doors and Charlie turned to him with determination.
"I'm not experimenting... Dean." Castiel made a frustrated sound before continuing. "You've been wondering how I keep so well fed." It wasn't a question, but Dean slowly nodded. "I haven't been feeding on humans directly. I get shipments of blood bags and supplements delivered regularly." Dean's eyes widened. Blood bags were commonplace for middle and lower class vampires, but it was scandalous for a higher class vampire to be caught with one for any reason. It was absolutely unheard of for an alpha. Old blood just didn't have the same nutrients as fresh blood. Castiel must have had to drink incredibly large quantities just to keep himself from starving. "When I first saw you, I was drawn to you immediately. I felt something building in me, cresting like a wave that would drown me if I didn't get closer to you. I was worried that my venom might hurt you, so I held as much of it back as I could with a quick bite, but it seemed like you were barely affected. Even now, you're nearly immune. It's just... refreshing." Castiel's expression was weighted down with exhaustion. "Please, I'll give you anything, just... don't disappear again." Dean thought back to the months since the last party. Had Castiel not fed on any humans since then? How long had he gone without before trying again with Dean that night? Dean felt his thoughts spiraling, so he focused on his breathing, his jaw clenching and unclenching intermittently. He could feel Castiel's eyes on him, waiting patiently for Dean's verdict. The bite had hurt. Dean could feel the phantom pain of it now, just thinking about it, but... it was also exquisite. The rush of endorphins that flooded his brain along with the heat of the alpha caging Dean in, safe and secure, was... not bad. Dean couldn't help but admit, at least to himself, that it felt pretty good. Dean looked up to meet Castiel's defeated gaze. He expected Dean to refuse him.
Now that Sam and Cas are sitting across from one another at the dining room table, Dean feels a little regret over having agreed to let them meet so quickly. Dean cleared his throat.
“Loki Estate Service. Yes, we were informed that you’d be visiting today.” She looked highly amused as she punched in a code on the keypad a few feet away from the gate. The gate doors swung open and she made a grand sweeping gesture towards the gorgeous, but surprisingly modest townhouse. They started their trek up the rosebush lined path and Dean felt his palms start to sweat more with each step. He subtly wiped them on his jeans, but caught sight of a smirk growing on the woman’s face, her knowing eyes a bright almost gold color. “Is this your first time meeting Mr. Novak?”
“What the fuck is this, Dean?!” Dean snatched the phone away from his aching ear and Cas winced in sympathy.
“Um, evening, sir.” Dean scrambled to reply, hoping he hadn't already pissed off the highest grade client in the room. Castiel smiled, a small tilt of his lips that Dean might have missed if he hadn't been paying such close attention. And by the way that his smile tilted up just a fraction on one side into a smirk, the man was very aware of said attention. Dean looked down at his shoes before strong, calloused fingers gently took him by the chin and tiled his head back up again. Castiel waited for eye contact once more before speaking.
True to his word, not long after Castiel left, a small group of attendants came to Dean’s room to deliver several steaming platters directly from the kitchen. Dean chuckled to himself at Castiel’s overindulgence, but he immediately found himself thankful for the excess. As soon as the scent of freshly cooked steak and potatoes hit his nose, Dean was ravenous. He dug into the dish as soon as the attendants set it down, throwing a wayward apology and thanks in their direction before they disappeared from his senses.
"Have you not received any of the calls and emails from the party's organizers? They've been going nuts trying to reach you this past week."
,” Sam snatched a handful of checks off the table and threw them at him “is looking out for anyone? I never asked you to do this. Mom and dad never asked you to give up your life like this!”
3.) I don’t have a lot of friends in the fandoms that I write for or the new ones that I like. If you want to chat with me about fandoms for a while just leave a comment. I’d be delighted with the company ^^
It felt like he hadn’t eaten all day, all week, maybe even longer than that. And while he knew the ritzy mansion had an excellent cooking staff, the food tasted way better than it had any right to. His mouth watered, spices coming alive on his tongue with every savory bite. There were several helpings of steamed vegetables and sliced fruits along with a small collection of colorful desserts. Dean was absolutely delighted to find a small apple pie, the flakey crust a gorgeous shade of golden brown with sweet crisp apples just below the surface. If there was a priest in house, Dean was pretty sure he’d get married to the pie tonight.
“Hey! I’m still here! Save it for when I am as far away as possible!” Sam gagged, his hands shielding the sight before him. Dean felt his cheeks heat up as he reluctantly pulled away, but his smile stayed firmly in place. Cas on the other hand looked like he did not even notice Sam in the room anymore, and even if he did, Dean doubted the alpha would care. A strangled noise left his throat as Cas’ hand rested firmly on his thigh.
“Why do you switch places every week?” At Castiel’s questioning sound, Dean continued. “The-the bite. You switch around a lot.” In the beginning of this arrangement, Dean had been worried that the alpha might leave a necklace of bites, especially with how he had previously only been feeding off of old blood. Despite the malnutrition, Castiel had only ever shown him remarkable restraint and respect for his comfort even though Dean was, for lack of better wording, the alpha’s dinner.
“When I get my hands on him, I’m going to shove him in a box, chain it shut, and bury him so far in the earth it’ll be hundreds of years before anyone finds the body.”
"My bite is a powerful thing. It can have an affect on humans for days afterwards, but it seems like you're not harmed by my venom in the slightest, even with a direct dose."
“God, what the fuck am I doing!?” he hissed violently as he started up his baby and peeled out of the back parking lot. He needed to get some distance between himself and those blue eyes before he agreed to something he couldn't even begin to understand. He was going to go home, have a beer(s) and be fucking normal for the rest of the night.
“I’m not a kid anymore, Dean.” Sam’s face went through a series of complex emotions, before settling on hurt. “Why didn’t you talk to me? Mom and dad didn’t love
"Hey, Dean. Sorry this party was a bust. Sometimes it's just hard to find clientele as a newbie. I'm sure they'll come around-" A smile broke out across her freckled face as she glanced at something over his shoulder. "Or, maybe a dedicated client of yours was running a little late." She grabbed a big cupcake, piled with sugary red frosting (all the food seemed to have a blood red theme, since one organizer was a jokester) and fled from the room with a little thumbs up and wink goodbye. Dean watched her go as she passed by a new figure that apparently teleported into the room since Dean couldn't fucking hear him move.
“Alright, knock it off, Sam.” Dean guided his brother reluctantly towards the house. “Let’s take this weird party inside, shall we?”
“Geez! Okay, Winchester. I don't ever want to hear you say the p-word ever again alright? It sounds like a curse coming from you.” Dean laughed and he could hear the small smile in Charlie's voice as she continued. “The next party is in two days, same place, same time. Just come in the back door, I'll make sure the bosses know you're going to work again.”
me. My future wasn’t the only thing on their minds. They loved you just as much and they would be heartbroken watching you give up everything just to prioritize my needs. You deserve to have a life too, Dean.”
“He did what?” Cas’ eyes were full of storm clouds. “When I get my hands on him, I’m going to shove him in a box, chain it shut and bury him so far in the earth it’ll be hundreds of years before anyone finds the body.” Dean barked out a laugh that was only slightly hysterical after watching a person literally shape-shift in front of him moments ago.
As Dean slid on his fresh wrist bands, he found himself stroking at the unmarred skin of his inner wrist... where Castiel had bitten him. The bite had healed soon after the alpha was done and now there wasn't even a scar. It didn't matter. It had been months and the alpha had probably moved on by now.
“Jeez, you're tense.” Charlie squeezed his shoulder before sitting on the bench next to him in the middle of the locker room which was cold like a damn meat freezer- “Dean, you know you don't have to do this, right?” He clenched his jaw slightly and tried to smile to reassure her, but he couldn't stop the way his fingers fiddled with the soft bands on his wrists nonstop. Charlie leaned forward and grabbed his hands. “You don't have to do this.” She repeated as her red hair, pulled up in a ponytail for work, slid behind her shoulder. The thick piece of gauze taped to her neck was lightly spotted with red. Dean couldn't stop staring.
"He didn't 'have his wicked way' with me, alright? I'm a damn professional. He took a sip and that was it. Nothing crazy happened."
“Mr. Winchester?” Dean nearly jumped as a young, brunette woman called to him from the other side of the gate.
(2019 update) Hey y'all this was my least fav chapter and prompted me to turn this dang writing car around. Like I said last chap, a lotta re-writing is happenin'. This chapter was almost completely re-written too. Plot direction has changed entirely. It must be done v.v
Dean was startled out of his spiraling thoughts when Castiel took a seat and cleared his throat pointedly.
“That sounds like it has some conditions, Cas.” Dean tried his best not to fidget as Castiel's eyes leisurely roamed over his arms, shoulders and neck.
“What did you do?” Dean growled, hackles rising back up as Castiel tilted his head like he didn't understand. The stupid smile hinted on his lips was proof he knew exactly what Dean was talking about. “I came here to work, not play. You can't lay a claim over me for the hell of it just because you're an alpha." Dean wasn't sure exactly of all the little intricacies of vampire culture and he hadn't heard Castiel officially declare it, but a claim was one of the few things that would drive every vampire as far away from him as possible.
For all that Dean knew that things didn’t always go according to plan, he didn’t think that his life would end up this far off track. He never expected to get accepted into an elite party (though he’s sure Charlie’s recommendation is the only reason he was). He definitely didn’t expect to become the center of attention as an alpha chose him for his first drink service. And then he got to know the alpha as Castiel... Cas.
"Well if that's true, then why don't you have a drink, alpha?" Dean smirked as he saw just a flash of the red tint cross over the brilliant blue of Castiel's eyes.
“Sam,” Dean sighed, feeling whatever energy he had left promptly leave his body. “It’s a lot more complicated than it looks.”
After about four months, Dean found himself staring at his bills again wondering what he was going to do. Sam was so busy that he couldn't work at his part-time job anymore. Dean's landlord was getting more impatient with him everyday. The money from the party hadn't even put a substantial dent in his credit card bills and his credit was too low to get another loan...
“Oh really? Because I heard from a couple of little birdies that an alpha strolled up to you, a complete newbie, and took you to the back to have his wicked way with you." Charlie squealed and laughed as Dean threw a small wrench at her and missed by a few inches.
Two days really wasn't enough time for the mental preparation Dean was trying to do, but he was at the mansion, on time, as promised. He went into the locker room and felt dread creeping up on him again as he changed into his uniform, his gold arm band still as visible as it was last time, but offering little comfort. Charlie had called him before he arrived, said she was probably going to be busy when he got there, but that she would find him later in the night.
"No, I don't, but entering into unknown territory can make anyone nervous... or excited." Dean felt his temperature rise as Castiel continued caressing a long prominent vein near the surface of his skin. "I can feel both emotions in you. Your blood is rushing so quickly that I can feel it your fingertips... calling to me.” Castiel laid a gentle kiss on the sensitive skin of his inner wrist and Dean suppressed a shiver. Workers weren't really supposed to be doing anything too handsy with any vampires who weren't private clients, but Castiel was kind of making him forget about that. It wasn't as if the guy had done anything really untoward, but something about Castiel made the most simple acts seem salaciously debauched. Dean felt an almost hazy buzz settle in the back of his mind with the alpha's hands on his skin, and Castiel was just playing with him. Two could play at this game.
"Dean! You've got to be kidding me. You didn't want to follow through with any of this?" Charlie rubbed delicately at her temple with two fingers as she reined in her frustration.
“Okay, Sammy. I won’t go there anymore.” A flash of blue eyes crossed through his mind. “But, uh, there’s one more thing you need to know about.”
“You’ve got nothing to thank me for.” Dean couldn’t look directly at Cas when he was smiling so brightly, like Dean was worth so much more than his blood.
Dean knew that sometimes life just didn’t go according to plan. Years ago, Dean had dreamed of a future where he would go to college and get a degree in automotive technology. Then he might’ve had the chance to design his own cars from the ground up. That dream quickly fell through when John and Mary Winchester died in a freak car accident just after Dean graduated highschool. After all the clawing grief had settled into a deep resounding ache, Dean was guiltily grateful that he was at least old enough to keep himself and Sam out of the foster care system. His brother was all he had left and he swore on their parents’ graves that he was going to take care of their little Sammy.
“Dean.” Cas spoke his name reverently, like it was the only word he knew, the only word he wanted to know. Cas reached for him and Dean took a seat on his lap, pushing the alpha down and covering him, stealing the air from his lungs with another desperate kiss. Cas’ hands deftly unbuttoned his shirt and dragged the offending garment off of him. The air felt cold on his skin, but Cas’ mouth burned a trail along his jaw and down his throat to close over the bite, kissing next to the healing skin apologetically. Dean drew him back up, unable to resist kissing Cas breathless all over again. It felt like hours passed in the blink of an eye. The room was dark, lit only by sparse moonlight, but neither of them could be bothered to part long enough to remedy that.
“Please, call me Castiel.” the alpha pulled Dean forward so he could guide him with a hand at the base of his spine. Dean allowed it, the warm contact keeping him slightly grounded as he was led to a little alcove where they would have at least a little privacy. Inside the alcove was a small seating area with plush red love seats overlooking some kind of garden, but Dean was too busy trying not to get cold feet to really analyze the scenery.
“No, I’m perfectly fine, Dean.” His voice sounded deeper, gruff and a little strained. He shrugged on his coat and moved towards the door. “I will have to miss our next appointment. A few foreign powers are travelling to make negotiations. Due to the number of alphas and elites, I’ve been called in to keep everything civil.” The way the last word was almost growled, it sounded like Cas had a stressful week ahead of him.
1.) Hi, I’m sorry I’ve been gone so long, but I came back to this story and really didn’t like the direction it was heading in so I re-wrote almost everything and changed the plot completely. Please go back (if you started reading this before December 2019) to read the past chapters so this one doesn’t throw you way off course because THINGS HAVE BEEN CHANGED. I’m sorry if any of you really liked the previous direction. I just don’t believe I wrote it well and I wanted to change it, hopefully for the better.
“Don't. Just... tell me when the next party is.” Dean could practically see the conflicted expression on her face as she pursed her lips, hesitant. “Please. Charlie I-”
Cas levels him with a weighty glare. Damn. It has the opposite effect than Cas most likely intends. It sends a shiver through Dean’s body, and has his cock plumping under the towel. He loves that domineering look on Cas’s face.
Without warning, Cas’s hand comes down on his chest. He braces himself for the pain, but it doesn’t come. Instead, his hand glows blue and the throbbing pain of his ripped skin ceases.
Cas jumps at the rage his human releases in and outside of his body. When it ends, he slumps where he stands.
“Hey.” Dean calls to get his attention. “Sex is meant to be shared. I don’t mind you watching or knowing my thoughts because they’re all about you. I’m feeling this way because of what you do to me, Cas.”
Having an angel in his bed is fascinating. He is experiencing as much joy from watching Cas react to the new feelings as he is by his own hand. His left hand drifts down over his balls, rolling them before reaching further to rub over that sweet spot just below them. Cas practically chokes on his tongue and moans.
As the late afternoon light filters through the cypress leaves, he can see the dappled light gracing the reason for his sabbatical to the bayou. A giant statue of an angel sits almost waist deep in the brackish water. It’s obviously been there for ages, as the bayou has been trying to reclaim it. The statue is covered in air plants and lichens, while Spanish moss drapes from its outstretched arm and wings. The entire surface is weathered by the humid environment and its inhabitants. Dean is fairly certain that under the water, the statue is in very poor repair. This morning, he noticed a crawfish scuttling into its burrow in the base.
“Cas,” Dean leans forward and reaches for him. The perfect image ripples like it’s made of water. He pulls his hand back and laces it with the other behind his head.
Another spine-melting screech sounds above and much too close to Dean. The waving rhythm of the forest picks up its pace suddenly, which hasn’t happened since he arrived. The only thing that makes sense to him is that something large is moving through this atmosphere, enough to create a wake.
Dusk is approaching, so he needs to get there soon. He can’t set the generator up in the dark, and he doesn’t think it would be smart to try to navigate the three mile trek back through the swamp at night. He might have a lantern, but night time is for the predators, and out here he is prey.
For now, he has some food packed in the refrigerator, a stove that works, marginally, and a bed to lay on. The former inhabitants also left a chair. After a simple meal of canned ravioli and canned vegetables, Dean takes the chair outside on the porch.
When Benny had brought him out here to see the statue from his childhood ghost stories, he’d promised Dean that the gators wouldn’t bother him if he left them alone. While Dean was busy hyperventilating when the first one they got close to hissed at them, Benny just scoffed and told it to shut the hell up. He’s not so sure that these Louisiana boys aren’t as crazy as they are big.
“And you’re a head in the clouds dreamer, Dean. This isn’t a theoretical field, son. We work in mathematical possibilities.”
“That is a passionate kiss. They can consume you and usually lead to more explicit sex.” Cas nods along dumbly, trying to pull his fried brain cells back into functional order.
It strikes him that Dean is still unfulfilled, but he isn’t acting like he is wanting to pursue more. Cas felt how desperate he was just moments ago. What changed?
Immediately, he chastises himself. He has no business at all finding joy in the company of an angel. He’s a powerful celestial being, a completely different species that belongs in heaven. There couldn’t be two creatures any less likely to be in a relationship. Damn. Him and his impossible crushes.
Checking in with Cas has him gasping in return. Debauchery has never looked so good. His hair is completely disheveled, his cheeks flushed, his eyes glassy, his lips parted as he pants.
He runs his fingers through Cas’s hair next and his angel practically melts. “Just wait until I shampoo your hair. It’s heavenly.”
Gentle honesty is in his answer. “It would have been something good that I could do for you. There aren’t a lot of things that I can give you or do for you from here.”
“It is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, Dean. Far superior to even the birth of a new star.”
“That’s right. You should have believed me, you fucker.” Dean chastises his brother and then commands the room. “Sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I needed to shake things up. Now that I have your attention, I think we have some things to talk about.”
Cas’s uncut cock is bobbing just an inch or so from his face, and it’s making his mouth water. When Cas looks down, Dean sticks out his tongue, laying it flat beneath him. Cas hisses in an agonized breath. “Yes, that would feel so perfect.”
He welcomes Dean’s soul into him, awestruck by the sensations as his grace touches it for the first time. Dean tenses up, his back bowing at the same moment. His mouth drops open and broken sounds drift from his mouth.  Cas peeks behind the curtain of Dean’s mind to make sure that the foreign feelings aren’t too much for him. He only feels love and joy echoing back from him.
It turns out to be a bad one. Well, it’s a brilliant idea, but the execution is not exactly flawless.
Castiel watches the rest of the apparent argument, which ends when his human makes a gesture at the vision and then slams the thin box closed. His hands prop his head up, and he sighs.
“I know. It sounds fantastic, doesn’t it? But that isn’t today. You need to ease you into these experiences.”
Castiel is alone again, which shouldn’t bother him nearly as much as it does. Most of his existence has been solitary. But having the warmth of Dean’s soul focused on him was overwhelmingly good, and its sudden absence is too stark in the dark night.
Castiel doesn’t like the feelings rolling off of his human. There is sadness, loneliness, and dismay.
Then, he feels the man reach out into the surrounding area. He is straining against the block in his brain that keeps humans using only their five senses. It’s what keeps them terrestrially bound. Castiel has never thought to give a human access to their full potential before, but if he could just touch this man, he would give him that and more.
“Toward what end?” Dean clenches his hands off screen, knowing that he can’t reveal any more to his brother without exposing everything about Cas. He looks away, anger painting his skin a regretful red.
Dean slowly makes sense of what Cas is telling him. Portal travel is not only possible. He’s about to have the secret of how to use it without ending up 30 million light years away. His mind hits overdrive. He sees himself becoming an overnight sensation that will make Elon Musk look like a one hit wonder. He sees his father coming to him with his hat in his hand. He sees homes on every continent, perhaps even on other planets.
Cas touches Dean’s head again, and in a few moments, he’s shared scientific principles and laws that it will take humanity another 300 years to figure out on their own. Comprehension dawns on Dean’s face as he processes the enormous download of information.
Dean’s latest project is collecting samples of the water, moss, and even the silt around the statue. He’s hoping that they will show differences from the samples collected in other parts of the swamp, and that there might be a biological path that he can follow.
“Yes.” Dean keeps humor out of his voice because he senses that it is partially what set Cas off earlier.
“Him?” John asks with a raised brow. “Are you really so lonely that you have a hard-on for a hunk of rock?”
Cas meets his eyes and finally blinks. “This is overwhelming, Dean. There’s so much to pay attention to.”
Panic sets in as he looks around him. He sits down on the ground, pulls his knees up, and makes himself small.
“That’s exactly why humans are so devoted to sex, Cas. They want this feeling as much as they can get it.”
The sounds of the bayou are symphonic. He’s surprised at the layers and complexity of the music. A constant high trill of crickets unceasingly works its magic. In the middle tones, various booming croaks and softer squeaks of frogs take turns in the spotlight. Something works on the low notes, a bizarre sound reminiscent of tumbling dice. Occasionally, an owl will croon softly.
Dean has lived in Lawrence, Kansas his whole life. He went to KU on a full scholarship for aerospace engineering and then joined the faculty as soon as he finished his Ph.D. Once he had some decent projects under his belt, he joined his family company, Winchester Aerospace. His grandfather and father have been running the company since the late ‘60’s, and now he and his little brother, Sam, have joined the ranks. Although, after their latest disagreement which led to the impromptu vacation to visit Benny, his college roommate, he isn’t sure that he wants to continue working there.
Dean scowls and snatches the paper back. “Well, yeah. Why would I buy that fishing shack if I wasn’t going through with it?”
It will be worth it to Castiel. He has the choice of being locked in this prison for all eternity, or giving Dean the knowledge he seeks and die for his one and only love. There’s no question what he will choose. He calls to Dean. “If it will make you happy, I will tell you what you need to know to use the portal.”
Cas sits on the bed next to him and takes the hand closest to him. “Dean, I love you and I plan to be part of your life. I don’t want to take you away from your friends and family. I know how much they mean to you. Well, except your father. I might smite him on sight. We should probably keep him at a distance for now.”
When the door opens and the human appears, Castiel is struck dumb by his beauty. He is practically naked, which seems quite a step away from the protective clothing they wore the last time he’d been in their presence. This human’s features are both masculine and pretty, particularly in his mouth and eyes. He is very tall for his kind, and more beautiful than even his heavenly family.
Dean distractedly moans when he takes a bite from one of the beef ribs, but answers as soon as he swallows. “I want to patent it so that no one can try to steal it and use it for their own profit. Then, I want to make it available to all countries equally. They will have to come through me for the knowledge, but I don’t want there to be any excessive profit from it.
“No, no, no. Don’t go getting any crazy ideas, Cas. I didn’t say I was done. I said that for the moment, I’m feeling happy that I helped you to feel this good, and I want to enjoy it.” He pauses to kiss the tip of Cas’s nose before teasing, “I’m a patient man, but it turns out that you are a very impatient angel.”
The quiet question has all the more impact for it being asked in an unimposing way. Sam is wiser than his years, and he always has been. The air is punched from his lungs, and his head is reeling with the realization that Sam is right. Suddenly lost, he looks to his brother. He doubts that Sam believes he is talking about an actual angel, that he believes they are discussing a man. All the same, he is more concerned with Dean’s part in this scheme and the deleterious effects it will have on him.
Cas has witnessed the birth of galaxies, watched the evolution of every species on earth, and can fly faster than the speed of light. This feeling, though, is beyond compare. His entire body, which both feels like his own and in some ways still feels foreign, is numb and delightfully prickly. His nerves are firing at an amazing rate, and he can feel hormones cascading into his bloodstream. With all of the action going on inside him, he feels remarkably at peace.
“Um, we’re on an unnamed planet in what humans are referring to as the whirlpool galaxy.” Cas doesn’t look at him, just continues to scan the horizon.
Dean is feeling the same way; he’s certain of it. There is reverence in his angel’s voice, and something significant is wrapping him up in its hold. He cradles Cas’s head to him, fingers ruffling through his hair.
Of course, that’s the first thing that Benny notices. He picks up Dean’s arm and rotates it back and forth while giving a low whistle. “Looks like you found the wrong kind of swamp angel, brother.”
“Like that kiss?” Cas licks his lips and stares at Dean’s again. He tugs on Dean’s shirt hem, trying to lift it up, but Dean pulls his hands away.
Dean has always been a dreamer, especially when it comes to engines. He started taking them apart and rebuilding them before he could grow facial hair. While all of his colleagues are trying to make the same old gas engines more robust and energy efficient, Dean is looking for the next technology. He’s researched and worked on teams building pure hydrogen systems as well as a number of bizarre options. In fact, he ran his last pickup truck on used oil from fast food restaurants. It worked, but driving around campus reeking of French fries did not really do anything good for his reputation.
Cas aches to tell him everything, to give him the keys to the proverbial kingdom. He just can’t. Not when he still has doubts about how Dean will use the information. It kills him to deny his golden light anything.
Late in the afternoon, when Dean is sitting on the porch again taking down notes, his laptop makes that alarming sound, which Dean had told him was Skype.
“Don’t go anywhere!” he manages in between bouts of laughter. Dean’s face is going to have whiplash from draining and filling with blood so fast. Dean grins through his embarrassment. It’s amazing to see his angel so happy, even if it is at his expense.
His breathy admission makes Dean’s heart beat at a quick clip, practically slamming into his ribcage.
Later in the day, an unnatural sound erupts from the box, but the human doesn’t seem alarmed. Instead, he smiles before he moves the little stone-sized black device. Another human appears on the open part of the box, but he is flattened into two dimensions.
“Honestly, I think your daddy still hopes that you’ll find a nice girl and settle down. I think he hoped that Devin was a phase.”
Dean laughs and pulls Cas in for a kiss. “Don’t combine my two favorite things, sweetheart. My brain might melt.”
“Cas,” he reaches out with all of his senses, needing to verify that he is alright. The only response is a higher pitched sound of agony that shatters his laptop screen and a few windows. Just when the sound reaches a frequency that Dean can feel causing hemorrhages in his head, it stops.
“I’ll give it to you. Whatever you want.” His pledge is true, despite coming in the midst of sex. Whatever Castiel asks, he will deliver.
Without hesitation, Cas opens his legs wide. When there is room enough, Dean inches forward. He puts his hands on the arms of the chair to keep them out of Cas’s way. Leaning up toward Cas’s face, he asks quietly, “Do you remember how it felt when I was stroking my cock for you?”
Cas reaches out and his arm goes through Dean like smoke. “I want to, Dean, but I don’t have a body here.”
“I love you, Cas,” Dean murmurs as they caress each other, hands and mouths joining in with worshipful purpose.
“I don’t. I just know my limitations. I can’t fight what I can’t see.” Dean enters his house again, and closes the door. Castiel still wants to know if Dean is hurt. He wants to keep talking to him, but he knows his limits too. He’s pushed the human enough for one day.
Cas tilts his head again. Dean waves him off and instead asks, “Can you take those clothes off in this form?”
Dean looks up to the side and leans his head on one hand. “You’re awfully insightful for someone who’s been checked out for most of human existence.”
Dean thinks of how to explain, but the voice cuts him off. “Oh, the muscle at the end of your digestive tract.”
Whatever the group is called, they can communicate between themselves without sound, and the battle cry has been sounded. In seconds, they are mobbing him, descending on him and creating a soft-looking, but viciously sharp coat. Flailing around to dislodge them is catching someone else’s attention.
“Pull on my hair again just like you did.” Cas complies and Dean projects his feelings. “Some people like a little pain during sex.”
Dean laughs, even though he’s fairly certain that Cas is serious. Cas squeezes his hand. “I was hoping that you would want me to fit in with them, to make a life with you.”
“How long should it take to come?” Cas has thrown his head back, giving Dean unfettered access to the long column of his throat. Dean keeps kissing whatever skin he can reach, but murmurs, “There’s no determined time. It just happens when all the good feelings are triggered.”
“I was using the pictures you pulled from my mind to get aroused. That’s why they were there. I was thinking of everything I find attractive in a person, and I pulled together all of my favorites.”
Dean’s body seizes up with the shock, the surprise pushing him over the edge into orgasm. His brain is screaming to respond to Cas, but all he can do is moan through the initial spurts of come.
Still, though, he doesn’t speak, so Castiel is forced to invade further. When he is able to communicate with him, he will offer his apologies for the intrusions.
There isn’t an answer for several minutes, so Dean strips out of his disgusting clothes and leaves them on the porch. He is halfway through his shower when Cas finally responds, startling Dean into almost slipping and falling.
Dark hair, the darker the better, completely chaotic from his fingers. Blue eyes are a must, they’ve always captured Dean’s interest. Sharp jaw, broad shoulders, firm chest and stomach, fat, uncut cock, and thick thighs. He’s close to Dean’s height, but his presence is bigger than he is.
“Oh, hey. Will you come here for a minute?” Cas turns to look back at him. He isn’t sure how he trudges in a spirit form, but he manages it.
Dean sighs and is about to remind Cas that he can literally read his mind when Cas gasps and yells for him. Dean turns, but by the time he sees Clyde’s snout go underneath his boat, it’s too late to do anything. The alligator lifts his head just enough to tip the boat forward, which sends Dean careening over the edge. His choices are to risk landing on the alligator or bracing himself.
With all earnestness, Dean pleads, “I can’t believe that you’d rather think me crazy than take a chance that I might be onto something. We grew up together, Sam. You know me. Why can’t you just try to believe me?”
Pushing himself beyond the limits of his body is the only way to survive. He can’t let himself be taken. ‘Think, Dean. Use that big brain,’ he encourages himself. This thing can’t be smarter than him. He doesn’t have to win the fight, just outsmart his opponent.
“Don’t be dismissive, my light. I have an entire list of examples of you doing careless things. You’re brilliant, but you lack sense sometimes.”
Dean needs to get closer. He wants to touch Cas with an urgency he can’t quite believe. As he crawls over next to his angel, Cas’s eyes go wide. Dean hopes that his approach isn’t unwanted. Reaching out to cup his face, Dean feels a pang of disbelief when Cas shakes his head.
Dean recognizes the look of concern on Benny’s face all too well. During college, every time that Dean had gone ‘off script’ and followed his instincts, his friend’s wary gaze was his horizon line, keeping him upright. He’d always been the standard by which Dean judged the outrageousness of his behavior.
That is, if they could even find it. Benny wouldn’t tell them where he was holed up, so they were more than welcome to canvas the hundreds of thousands of acres of swamp.
Less than ten minutes go by before the mosquitoes find him. When they do, it’s like they sounded an alarm. Dozens of them swarm him and manage to bite even while he’s swinging his arms like a windmill. “Son of a bitch!” he yells and retreats inside. Realizing that he’ll have to go back outside to retrieve the chair if he wants to use it, he decides he’d rather let the mosquitoes have it.
In his arms, he can feel Dean trembling. The last of his grace returns, and he draws away to see tears rolling down Dean’s cheeks. Shock widens his eyes, but before he can ask what is wrong, Dean is sobbing. The sounds are gut-wrenching to him.
"Okay." Castiel's eyes widened, hope awakening in his features. "You can be my regular client, but no more secrets. If you think something might happen, then tell me. I don't like being kept out of the loop, Cas."
(2019 edit) So I lied in my last edit from chapter one that I made like ten minutes ago. I had to re-write a chunk in this chapter and I'm sure the next will be the same. It's strange to learn so much about people everyday when you thought you kind of knew how people acted???  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (a.k.a. Younger me made Dean kinda trashy and Castiel kinda creepy and I wanted to make them better b/c I love him and they deserve more?????? Sorry if y'all liked the old version????)
2.) It’s been difficult for the past couple years to find time to write fics because I’m a full time student and writing doesn’t make any money, so this once fun pastime started to make me feel like I was wasting valuable time that could have been used to be productive elsewhere. (No I can’t do commissions, I almost got booted off the site for trying *I didn’t understand at the time that the rules against it were very severe and I got reported* and long requests don’t bring me inspiration, they just make me tired.)
Castiel watched Dean run from him and had to tamp down the immediate desire to chase him down and convince him to stay. The urge was so strong that Castiel was taken aback long enough for a few of his younger underlings to step forward in pursuit of his prey. A deep and vicious growl rumbled out of his throat before he could stop it and the fledglings stopped in their tracks, turning on a dime towards their superior with quick apologies and lowered gazes of deference. Appeased for the moment, Castiel sat back, crossing one leg over the other and stretching an arm over the back of the love-seat. When he had been invited to this particular party, he had almost decided not to attend considering his taste in blood was rather particular. His elder brother had the nerve to call him a picky eater. Dean's flavor though held an intensity that Castiel hadn't felt in hundreds of years. There was an overwhelming spicy hot flare that reminded him of ignited gunpowder and a tang of salt with a sweet and savory aftertaste, like salted caramel. It left a wanting ache in the alpha's veins, freshly fused with Dean's blood.
“Cas.” Dean gathered the alpha’s face in his hands and drew him away from the bite. Cas let him, a hopelessly lost look in his eyes as he scanned over Dean’s face. Dean lifted his chin and kissed him. He could taste his own blood of the alpha’s lips and seeked it out, stealing it back. He walked Cas backwards until he dropped onto the edge of the bed.
“You don’t have to do anything big. I’m just happy to see you and relax for a couple days. It’s been way too long.” Dean had been worried when Sam went off to college out of state. Sometimes, even now, the distance hit really hard, especially when they both got too busy to talk much. They always found time to catch up eventually though. There was always time for family.
The sweet smell of ozone poured into his lungs and it became impossible to control his breathing. His heart beat double-time and it tried to break out of his damn chest to fall into Cas’ hands. He clutched at Cas’ wrinkled shirt and drew the alpha closer until they were flush together, his legs parted around Cas’ thigh. He heard Cas groan into his skin before his fangs sliced into him with deadly precision. The lightning building in his veins finally exploded. Devastating strikes raced along his muscles and bones, leaving no place unscorched. The storm raged in his blood, desperate to give the alpha everything he needed and more.
“I’m not sure this evening would be the best time for that. Mr. Novak seems to be in quite a mood. He tried to kick out his own brother just this afternoon. Poor soul.”
“No, Charlie. Shit, that hurt.” Dean gently rubbed the back of his head as he glared at the red-head before returning to his work and grumbling. “I don't know what you're talking about.”
"N-nothing crazy happened? Dean! That was Castiel Novak, one of the few alphas left wandering around the United States. They've got more wealth and power built up over their years than you or I can imagine. Then, out of all the workers at the party, he picked you specifically and requested you again at your earliest convenience! That's not crazy to you?!" Charlie was exasperated now, flailing her arms every which way, thankfully still being very mindful of her half finished shake.
Just as Dean’s knees started to feel weak, Cas stopped pulling his blood, but he seemed incapable of parting from the wound. Cas licked up stray droplets like a man possessed, reluctant to close over his bite.
Dean was a bundle of tightly strung nerves. He had re-buttoned his simple uniform shirt twice because he kept skipping a button and had almost put his personal items in the wrong locker despite the golden name-plates on the front of each door. He nearly jumped right out of his skin when a delicate hand landed on his shoulder.
I hope y’all enjoy the new chapter and thanks so much to everyone who reads and sends kudos, or comments. I appreciate you so much! Happy New Year!
“Damn it, Sam.” Dean rubbed a hand over his face and examined the chipping paint of the wall beside him as he tried to find his words. Unfortunately, the movement left part of the slightly raw and red area of his healing neck on display.
“Evening, handsome. Mind if I have a drink?” She fluttered her long dark eyelashes at him, her smoky eye-shadow making the hungry tint of red in her eyes pop. Dean didn't really trust his voice by this point, so he slid off his right wrist-band, baring the sensitive skin there and offering it to her with a mostly automatic wink. She took his hand in her own small, beautifully manicured ones and brought his wrist forward to her mouth. Dean squeezed his eyes shut and waited, but nothing came. No pricking pain or burning racing up his veins as the woman drank. His eyes flashed open to see the woman wasn't even looking at him, her face turned to the crowd before she nodded curtly to someone and dropped Dean's hand and walked away. Dean blinked for a couple of moments staring after the retreating figure, dumbfounded.
“Merrily? Who- oh, oh.” Then he seemed to remember she was also there, and ran over to cut her down. He worked the slime off of her so she could move and speak.
“Mhm, don’t forget to punch a cop.” The man laughed loudly at that and ruffled the girl's hair, and she kicked him again. Jay just looked at them with a dumb-founded, goofy smile. Who the fuck were these people?
“Mommy! Please. Please wake up, don’t- don’t leave me. Please. Please. I love you, Mama, please, please wake up.” He kept rocking her, holding tighter and tighter. His words broke apart, stopped carrying meaning. They morphed into a long, broken string of shaped sobs as he kept shaking her. Pleading with her to come back. Come back to him.
“Heya, kid. How’d you like to make some cash?” Jay looked at him, and his confusion must have been clear, cause the man winced before starting again, “I mean, we need help moving some boxes, cause our family can’t make it out in this,” he pointed to the window behind him, “and you’re, like, the only person Cl- we’ve really met yet. And you’re, what, seventeen? Teenagers always need money, so.”
“What?” He looked sheepish, then, and stood up straight, dropping Jay out of his trance as he looked away, like he was embarrassed.
“What do you suggest?” She stared for a minute, and then looked down at her pen and pile of card paper. She picked up each and handed them over.
Shrugging off his coat and boots, he quietly slipped towards the living room. Why he was quiet, he didn’t know, but it felt… necessary. There was a wrongness seeping its way into his bones, filling his veins, flowing through his lungs. Wrong, wrong, wrong. His skin crawled with it.
“Jay! Look at me. Only look at me. That thing?” he pointed behind, “that is not your mom. We’re going to take it out of her, and we’re going to do everything we can to keep her alive. Okay?” Jay shook his head. Kept shaking it, even when Dean stood both of them up and started pulling him into the house, kept shaking it as he was crushed in the man’s arms. Dean was shaking, now, too. Grip tight.
“Hey, Jayden, how was school?” His Mom asked, standing in the doorway against a dark, snowy winter sky. The warm light of the house made her smile glow as she kicked her feet on the mat and looked at him with sparkling eyes.
“Your- the. Nevermind. Just. Don’t… say anything. Pick out a flower.” The detective replied before making his way back over to her. The creepy man rolled his eyes and followed.
It was all too much. He shoved the man away. Then shoved him again. Then screamed. He screamed out into the air until his throat was raw, screamed so hard the pain in his throat hid the feeling of tears cascading down his face. When he stopped screaming, he turned back towards Dean, and charged.
“Yeah, just me and her, Cas’s busy doing… shit out of town, so. But, kid, you should know, she has a girlfriend.”
“Are you trans?” He coughed, choked on his own spit, and then coughed some more. He’d gone on blockers when he was 12, started T at 16. There’s no way she should know. “Sorry, it’s not, like, obvious, I just have a… good sense of these things. I’m trans too, by the way.” He stuttered, felt the blush on his cheeks, before nodding and holding out his hand, and she took it, shaking it firmly.
“Relax, kid. I’ve stolen worse than that. And you are very clearly not the type.” He nodded down at Jay’s star wars tee with another wink, from both of them this time, accompanied by a snicker from the girl.
“Hey, you stupid bitch! Is that the best you can do, throw some guy down the stairs and cut up a little girl? Torturing in hell for thousands of years and that’s the best you’ve got?”
“is whether you saw any animals on the scene. Something like this, that’s usually what we look at first.”
“Here, just… write from the heart.” He tilted his head at her. “Something like, ‘I treasure you too much to let this come between us, my love. Sincerely,‘ and then, uh, just put your name. You can take those with you, bye now!” He looked down at the pen and paper, scribbled out exactly what she had told him to, adding “Castiel” for the name, and tucked it into the roses just as a loud crash sounded from the back room.
“Who says I’m not the type?” And yeah, he had to snort with them after he said it, because it's something he’d expect Mya to say.
Jay lingered in the front for a bit, watching birds jump from tree to tree in the drowning light of the sun. His heart burned, his stomach bled, but for the first time in weeks he felt like he had a tomorrow.
“Fine. Fine, fine, fine.” She walked over and ruffled his hair, picked some lint off his shirt, “Well, aren’t you gonna ask me about work?”
(On reflection, Merrily James recognized this new, beautiful Monday as the start of the troubles that led her to the predicament this story began with. See, the unpleasantness of the last week had taken the form of an unfortunate, unexpected, and altogether unusual passing of a man in her shop. She had spoken to the police, who seemed themselves baffled, and after that had put the whole thing behind her. Or so she assumed.)
“What kinds of food do adult humans enjoy eating?” He said it almost to himself, still looking around the store, distracted.
“Why not.” He said to the empty room. It seemed normal enough, until he noticed a slight shimmer in the walls. He moved closer, dropping his bag on the floor and leaning forward. It was… clear paint. Not everywhere, though, in strange shapes all over the wall. He tried tracing one, and as he did he felt his hairs stand on end. Something passed through him. It was completely meaningless to him, but there was just something about it that seemed to… look at him. The sound of the door banging open and shut shook his attention with a jump.
“Oh my god, I could rip his heart out, he’s harmless.” The man pulled a face and pulled out his wallet. Jay didn’t realize he had stopped breathing until he caught the girls eyes again, when his body tried to stop breathing again.
“I’m sure you could steal a whole yacht if you put your mind to it. Reach for your dreams, and all that. Stay in school. Steal.”
He stood there silent as he heard the screams grow louder, more painful- more pained. He stood there when it all stopped.
“How will I know? The difference, I mean.” Castiel was looking at the detective very closely, eyes unreadable. His skin was almost glowing.
The thing is, Jay didn’t have very many friends. Being trans and black and jewish and a huge fucking nerd in the middle of a buttfuck nowhere will do that to a guy. And this… this seemed almost too good to be true. It was the best time he’d had without his family in years. So sure: dog hair without a dog, giant teeth, horrifying boxes, weird invisible symbols, water in your face… it was all weird, but he could ignore it.
“Mom, please.” Behind him, he heard someone walk over and lean down next to him, felt their hand land on his shoulder. He flinched away and buried his head in her hair.
“I looked into what you said, didn’t see any signs of demonic activity nearby. Unless you count the blizzard, but that’s par for the course around here. You sure it was sulfur? ‘Cause…” Her words faltered as they locked eyes. Her eyes still seemed to glow, even in this light. And demonic activity? “Jay!”
“...One moment.” She rushed to the back room, towards the phone, hoping to call the police. The line, though, was dead. And the backdoor was nailed shut years ago. She looked around and quickly put together a bouquet of red roses, white lilies, and pink orchids. When she came back out, the odd man was standing exactly as he had been when she left. With shaking hands, she passed the flowers over.
Pristine, orderly, and colorful. She patted the desk fondly, a small smile pushing her glasses slightly further down her nose. She righted them with a carefully manicured hand before standing.
Dean looked at him sadly, almost resigned, but still with a soft grin on his face. He clapped his shoulder before stepping out of the car.
“Uh, I think so. We ordered a lot for winter, there should be some left. Let me just… check…” Something about the pair was off, they left him feeling unnerved. The girls eye’s were a deep golden-speckled blue, and they almost… glowed. The man just nodded.
“Uhm… have a nice day.” And then he walked straight back out. One of the vases on the shelf near the door shattered as he stepped out.
“Nothin’. See ya, kid.” And with that he sauntered right back out of the store, leaving a very confused Jay behind him.
“Awesome,” she made a small noise of disapproval at the informality, and the man wiped the artificial smile clean off his face, “uh… right, I’m Detective Poe, I’m with the FBI, I’m here to ask you a few questions, if you don’t mind?”
The sound stopped, silence deafening as the figure slowly grew taller and taller, rising in the void of black. It just stood there, for a long time, staring back at Jay as he, whole body shaking, skin crawling, stared back at it. There was a name for the feeling that thing gave him, somewhere deep in the back of his mind. He couldn’t reach it through the cloud of fear as it just… stood. Just stood. All at once, it was rushing forwards. He didn’t have to scream before it grabbed him and all at once the darkness lifted.
He never saw Dean, though. Sure, a glimpse here and there in the hallway, but nothing more than a nod. Jay was pretty sure he cooked all the food. Somehow, whenever he mentioned to Claire something he liked, it showed up outside his door in Cas’ arms the next day. And he was pretty sure the HRT supplies he found sitting on his bed were from Dean, too. If he were being honest with himself, he was glad for the space. A part of him blamed Dean for his mother’s death. The last of his family. Gone.
He’s grabbing his bag from the back of the car when he hears a loud British voice. ‘Who’s looking for a scoop?’
Ben is stood behind him with a similar smile. Dean swaggers past with more fish and into the kitchen, ‘What did I tell you Jack, you’re with an expert! Cas, where do you keep the pans?’ he calls over his shoulder, already unloading things from the fridge.
When the hug frenzy dies down, Dean finds Jack’s eyes and mouths ‘Thank you.’ Jack’s eyes glint as he gives a small smile and nod.
‘Dean, your appointment next week for your cast removal. It’s on Tuesday. Would you be able to see if you can change it?’
He plonks down at the table next to Cas, careful not to look at him. He nudges his knee under the table and receives a similar pressure in return. Good.
For Cas, it’s fascinating for him to see the private side Dean. His public persona is an extension of his true personality in a way. It’s refreshing to see that he is as genuine off screen as he appears on screen. But there’s a lot more that Cas sees that he is unexpected. His generosity and keenness to look after his family is impressive.
Cas didn’t answer. He just stared at Dean. ‘Uh, I mean, only if you want it to.’ He fidgeted with the collar on his jacket.
The other man smooths his clothes, ‘It would appear so. It’s nice to finally meet you.’ He holds out his hand.
‘So what did you get up to over spring break then Claire?’ She was catching up with her study group after returning to Stanford last week from her break.
Dean spotted Cas in the doorway, observing Benny. He seemed satisfied as he came to introduce himself.
A thought occurred to him. ‘Sammy, your Dean, is he..?’ God he was so insensitive. He shouldn’t ask!
Cas doesn’t respond, just gets in. Dean pulls out a tape from the glove compartment. Led Zepplin starts blasting as he pulls out of the drive.
He sees a warm smile touch her lips, a hand on his arm, ‘You don’t think you deserve to be loved.’ A statement not a question. A long stare.
Sam and Eileen left with John and Mary, to go and stay with them so they could get to know their daughter in law. Dean stayed behind sitting at the bar with Bobby, filling him in on everything he had missed.
They have dinner with Sam and Eileen. Sam basically said the same as Cas. Dean looks relieved. Cas watches as the weight rolls off his shoulders. Why would he doubt their support?
‘Second cupboard from the oven.’ Cas responds distractedly, Jack still nattering in his ear about the fishing trip. He hears bashing and crashing in the kitchen, the sound of chopping. He makes to go towards the kitchen, Sam stops him, ‘Don’t, he’s in his element.’ Cas is still unsure, hovering by the door, watching Dean command his stove with skill.
Sam has gone to the office to organise some protection for Cas. He’s taking him off the case. His work know Cas was in hospital. Sam has sent them an email telling them he needs to recuperate for a long time and won’t be back. Two birds one stone, hopefully Luke gets the message too.
‘Okay then, I’m off to shower, and shave,’ he looks pointedly at Sam, ‘and bed.’ Hefts his bag on his back and takes the stairs two at a time.
By the time the evening drew to a close, Dean felt like he had a new friend. He hugged Sam goodbye, whispering ‘thank you’ in his ear. He gave Eileen a kiss on the cheek, tried signing ‘goodbye’, which made Eileen beam and turned to Castiel. The other man held his hand out.
They finally got through the gate and Dean pulled up at the space closest to the school. Claire flung herself out of the car as fast as she could and made to run off.
‘Yeah, course. It’s still a bit weird sometimes though. I know it’s not for you because you stayed friends.’ Dean gripped the handle of the car door. Through gritted teeth, ‘It’s strained and awkward,’ Sam let out a guffaw, ‘It is Cas, Dean!?!’
‘How about a modified version of the trap we set for Raphael? We’ve got an all powerful witch here. Put some extra kick in it.’
A new song is playing onscreen, a fast rock song, with a heavy beat and strong guitar. Dean’s voice is low and scratchy. ‘Did you guys break up?’
Dean thought about that. Raises his hand with the glass and pointed at Cas. ‘Yeah, you know what, I do, because then I would be justified in doing this.’
‘With the yeti look it was pretty easy. You were stood looking right at me in front of you and on the screen and even you didn’t notice it was me. Like I said, if people aren’t expecting to see me it helps.’
‘Cas, Claire doesn’t need anyone to be her mother. She’s got all she could ever want in both parents in you. It’s only because Amara wanted to try to get to know her.’
He enjoys coffee. She’s somewhat intense. She works in publishing as well. Some kind of management role, she complains about being locked away from the real action of meeting authors regularly. Her eyes seem to draw him in. He’s transfixed.
He sees her pushing her way through the crowd by the bar. She’s obviously got her sights on new prey already. The look on her face says it all.
When Sam visits Lisa announces she has to head to a convention out of town. It starts on the Monday but she wants to head up on Saturday to have a few days of pre meetings with key contacts. That suits Dean fine, he wasn’t sure how well Sam and Lisa would get in anyway. Ben isn’t bothered to see his mother go away. He’s spending more time with his friends as he grows older, finds family time a bore.
‘Sure, man. Uh, I’ve got some meetings with some execs, bunch of marketing stuff for a film I made last year. Meetings about a possible new series they want me to be involved in. Some about a guest role. Boring stuff.’
Claire found them like that the following morning. Cas was upright, head leant backwards, soft snores coming out of his mouth. Dean still sprawled along the sofa, head on Cas’ lap.
‘Dean, I would like to introduce my son Jack.’ The kid holds his hand up, the same awkward hello emerges. Dean stifles a laugh. ‘Hey Jack.’
The following Tuesday Dean wakes up feeling invigorated. Things are looking up. He’s got a coffee date with Amara today, he’s moving on.
John doesn’t take his eyes off, Jack who is smiling cautiously as he heads over. ‘He’s a nephilim. Half angel. He’s our kid. I’ll explain later.’
A genuine smile showed through, finally. ‘Yes, she’s, well not quite grown up, in high school now. It’s amazing to watch her grow into this incredibly headstrong young woman. I can see so much of myself in her, but it’s also tampered by the much more calming influence of, uh, the person she lives with.’
There are points when he has to take a break, worried about what he sees and how things are going to turn out, frustrated at not being involved. He tries to stop himself critiquing Cas by prayer, he knows Cas can hear him by the roll of his eye. It descends into general heckling after a while. It’s almost like they’re together.
Dean laughs. ‘I can’t say the same for me, but it’s nice to be drunk in company rather than on my own with a bottle of whiskey.’ He quickly shuts up as Cas eyes him seriously.
He ended up sitting in the middle of a meadow, surrounded by wildflowers. He could hear bees buzzing around him. He knew Cas would like that. Probably had a hand in making it. He looked round, realised it was just like the field where he had scattered Cas’ ashes ...
She seems to know what’s going on and gives him some words of encouragement. She promises work closely with him and help. He knows she’s trying to be nice, but he barely pays her any mind.
Dean drops the other Dean’s hands allowing him to rise. He steps back as the other man turns around.
Sam and Eileen settled into a semblance of a normal life. She carried on with the odd hunt until she got pregnant. Sam and Dean seemed to have suddenly received a big pay out from a previously unheard of Winchester family trust, apparently lawyers had been trying to track them for years and had finally succeeded (not interfering, Jack, really?). They didn’t have to worry about money, legitimately, for the first time in their lives.
‘Wow.’ Ben breathes, next to her. ‘I came for Jack, and don’t get me wrong he was great, but those guys are the real deal.’
Amara has been telling him more about her new business venture. She’s setting up an agency to represent authors when their books are sold to tv or film studios. To act as a go between, ensuring the author’s vision is protected.
Dean managed to tear Ben away from the Xbox about 9pm. Rehearsals were due to start the next day, he wanted to make sure Ben was as rested as possible.
Dean beams, pleased at the change of course the conversation has taken. ‘Yep. We’re talking editing and publishing schedules.’
Cas can’t help himself, he inhales the smell. It is just like he thought, but somehow better. Spicy, masculine, with underlying notes of sweetness.
Once breakfast is over, Donna heads off, making Cas promise she’ll get to see him again before they leave town.
Cas looks up from wringing his hands, ‘I don’t care about my career Dean. I’m concerned about you. I don’t want this to cause problems for our friendship or for your future relationships.’
Sam corners Dean in the kitchen as he’s clearing up. ‘You good? I heard you were pretty stressed out last night.’
The wipers were swishing before his eyes in a monotonous whine. He had turned off the radio, fed up with listening to music and chatter he didn’t enjoy, annoyed at himself for forgetting to bring his adapter to plug in his phone. He enjoyed audio books on long drives.
‘It’s only coz I’m around. He towers over most others.’ Dean stands next to Cas a hand on his shoulder causally. He sees Charlie spot it. She doesn’t say anything. Cas doesn’t make a move to get away from him. They stay like that chatting for a few moments.
Charlie smiles brightly. ‘Oh she has. Her name is Stevie. She’s gorgeous and amazing and wonderful,’ Charlie is gushing.
He could hear them whispering above his head. ‘Hey, I can hear you damnit.’ He tried to stand fully and walk forwards. That was a mistake.
Cas pondered a moment. ‘A yeti.’ With beautiful green eyes. He ponders them once more. They’re familiar somehow. But he’s sure he’s never met the beast-man before.
He doesn’t want to seem too clingy so decides not to start conversations for a little while. Make sure Dean doesn’t feel smothered.
Dean clears his throat. ‘Well, she works away a lot so we only usually see her at weekends. She’s going to come out for a week every now and then to see Ben.’
‘So what, you were going to turn this into some sort of kinky dream? Just great!’ Dean throws his hands up. ‘That’s hardly what I need right now. What are you here for? Why haven’t you come back?’
As much as he wanted their friendship back, Cas couldn’t really ask for what they had before. The years of distance had ruined that forever, he knew that. It had troubled him more than he wanted to admit to himself, not wishing to regret his decision to leave, still convinced it was the right move. But, he felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders now. He was worried that all he had done was pass his burden. He sighed.
He let out a slow breath and turned around to look out the window. ‘You know I was speaking to Lisa this week. I thought that I could go to the mountains, buy her place. Hide out for a little while.’
They pay up, Dean treats, insisting that they are using Cas’ car it’s only fair, ‘But we’re sharing the cost of fuel, Dean. And make their way back to restart their trip.
‘He is a normal dad! He’s annoying and embarrassing and all the stuff your dad is too! The rest of it is just his job.’
They order food and some champagne (why not?!) and start going through the pictures of the dresses that Eileen has already picked out as being the style she likes. Suddenly, Cas stops.
‘He’s fine Dean. Don’t worry about him. He’s just dealing with the aftershock of an article about him. And coming back into all this after time away, it’s a lot to handle.’
‘Cas, dear, we need to chat a little once we’re back home again. But we’ll leave you alone for tonight.’ Cas nodded. He waved briefly once they were out of the car and drove off.
‘What? No. I asked Sam to invite you.’ Dean’s stance softens, he takes a few steps toward Cas and places his hand on his shoulder, his head bent towards Cas. You’re family too. And not just because of Eileen.’ Dean is earnest. The truth of the words clear in his eyes.
‘I want him to do it. He might have a career here, I don’t want to stop him doing something he wants. But I’m concerned about sacrificing his family life.’
‘And how did that go Cas? You were dead, you didn’t exactly see. Every time you were gone, it wrecked me. It’s like I lost my guiding light, my reason for being. Why do you think I was so happy every time you came back? I can’t live without you Cas!’
‘Yeah of course he does, his mom does too. I’m sure they’ll be by in the next few days to say hello.’
Dean told Cas he was his best friend all the time. But he hadn’t ever explained what that meant to Dean. That he didn’t want Cas to go. That he needed him in his life, always.
‘Jack, please can you help Cas. I don’t know what happened but I need to know he’s ok, I can’t lose him again.’
Dean carried Cas’ coffee over to the sofa. ‘You look tired buddy. Early bedtime for you.’ Cas just took a sip of his coffee and nodded.
‘The mysterious Jimmy Angelo, what a pleasure.’ Benny made a small bow before taking Cas’ hand, the look of confusion on Cas face pulling at the edges of Dean’s mouth as he tried to keep a straight face.
Eileen is watching the spectacle with relaxed amusement. Castiel leaned over to kiss her cheek, ‘You look happy Eileen.’ She let out a giggle, ‘Thank you Castiel.’ There was a twinkle in both their eyes.
The trouble was, Cas wasn’t doing anything that would warrant criticism. Dean couldn’t pull him up on his behaviour as it was perfectly civil and courteous. He was speaking to Dean, not ignoring him. He was just ... off. When Dean would enter a room, Cas would find excuses to leave. By the day after Christmas even Claire noticed.
‘Goodnight Claire,’ a smile forms on his lips as she leans in to give him a goodnight kiss on his forehead. Just like he used to give her when she was a little girl.
‘I’ll leave you in Castiel’s capable hands.’ She gets up and heads to the door. She smiles at Cas as she passes him but his eyes are not focussed on her. She looks behind her and sees Dean equally focussed on Cas, blushing and flustered. By the time she reaches the door Cas is knelt at his feet slowly sliding the other shoe on his swollen foot, as Dean winces and holds the arms of the chair. ‘Caaaas!’ He whines, ‘Be careful!’.
‘Oh no, I’m not mixing business and pleasure, it’s my son’s set, can you imagine how awkward it would be?’
‘Come on, you know you love the Dead Men Walking songs as well, if you wanted to stay for the main act, I’ve heard you sing along to them all the time. You know all the words!’
By the time the weekend ends, Castiel can see Dean has relaxed, shed his care and concern. He sees him walk about town with ease. The locals know him, barely spare him a second glance other than to ask about his family or vaguely refer to his career. They don’t seem to care much.
‘This is horror film territory buddy. I’m very grateful for the offer, but I’m a strange guy on the side of the road in a snow storm and almost dark. Are you sure?’
They stroll outside, heading to their respective cars. As Dean and Cas reach the door they spot fireworks in the distance. The group stand and watch for a moment.
‘You still stopped the world being destroyed, Dean.’ Cas’ hand was reassuring on his shoulder. Dean glanced back with a small smile.
‘Can I have a chicken club sandwich please. And he’ll have..’ Cas looks over questioningly at Dean, who winks back, ‘a burger. With everything.’ Dean smiles under his cap.
Dean liked Lisa a lot, he wanted to move in with her. But he was afraid. He wasn’t sure what Cas would do without him. He was worried about the impact on Claire. He asked Cas about her living with him part of the week. Of course Cas said yes. Long before the adoption, Cas loved Claire as his own child. So what that he’d have his hands full with an 8 year old and a teenager. Dean, Lisa and Ben could come for dinner one of the nights she was with them, so they could all spend some time with Jack too. They could make the schedule work. Cas bent over backwards.
‘Also, it’s getting confusing. I used to call him Daddy and you Dad when we lived together, but now I just call you both Dad! One of you needs a new name!’
‘Dad, you know you’re supposed to be a rock star right? This doesn’t look very rock and roll to me.’
Dean had walked off to shower, but decided he needed another coffee to take with him. He has approached the kitchen where Cas and Claire still stood. He could hear their conversation. Something made him stop and listen rather than join them.
It was lunchtime and she was sat on the grass with her friends. They had all finished eating and were lounging about, soaking up some sun before their next class started.
Dean is preoccupied. He is trying to get into the inner circle of the production team for the new show he’s on. He’s been buddying up with Michael. He hates it. It does seem to be working, but he’s really having to a schmooze, get involved in the industry. Go to all the parties, be seen by all the right people as he’s working the machine.
Even his boss, Chuck, can’t dampen his spirits. ‘What’s with you Novak? Not seen you smile this often since, well, ever?’
On the day itself he’s almost as excited as they are for her first prom, dashing around preparing drinks and snacks for everyone.
‘Cas.’ It’s almost a breath, barely even a word. Dean starts towards Cas. ‘Hello Dean.’ Cas turns to him, getting the words out, so casually, like they just saw one another, as Dean starts to speak over him.
Ben laughs, ‘You mean a new one every night is not the best way to do things?’ Dean shakes his head solemnly, ‘But don’t copy my example either!’ The jovial mood is ruined.
‘I know. But now I’m older I really see what she’s done to you. And I feel bad. But she’s still my Mum, you know.’
‘Cool? Go travelling. Be good to get away. Have your own space for a bit.’ God what was he even saying.
Cas put his hand on Dean’s shoulder. ‘It’s not like I was blameless. I should have asked you, but I ran off because I was afraid of the answer. I thought you were trying to replace me, that you didn’t want me around Claire anymore. After Lisa, then Amara. Surely you can see?’
‘Who are you and why are you pretending to be me?’ His deep voice is a growl in the other man’s ear.
‘So, let’s talk logistics. Filming starts in the new year in Canada. We’ll sort out schooling and accommodation in the meantime…’
They bumble around crashing into furniture and each other, counting the beer bottles and adding that to the wine tally from earlier. ‘Dean, I think I’m drunk. That hasn’t happened in a while.’
Dean is sick of it. He was doing it to get more influence over the show, try to improve things he could see that weren’t quite right. Maybe get a director gig out of it. It’s become too much. He’s sick of everything. He wants out of the film business. He’s thinking of retiring. He’s nearing 40, that’s a reasonable age, right? Give up the gig. He can’t deal with all of this anymore. He’s exhausted.
Cas hasn’t really gone into detail about their family and why they haven’t spoken for so long. But from the few snippets of information Dean has gathered, it seems that Amara wanted to take in Jack when he was orphaned and things got a bit ugly. Cas has said he realises now that it wasn’t her fault but the way his father painted it, but they have never healed their relationship.
‘Alright enough with the fantasy, help me out you two, what about that guy there?’ Jody eyes up a man at the bar.
Dean let out a chuckle. Gabriel wasn’t laughing. In fact his expression was like steel. Dean blinked, his face falling. He wasn’t sure what the issue was.
‘Always Dean. As I’ve said before, we have a profound bond. I remade your soul with my grace. It will be within you forever.’ Cas stops, then more quietly, ‘I will be with you forever. You are not a blip to me.’
“Alright. That’s my queue to leave for the store.” She snorted, ruffling his hair again before kissing his head.
“You own the flower shop.” Another light was flickering. They needed to fix the lights in this town.
“Hey, kid, do you guys have any… um… industrial salt?” The girl snorted and rolled her eyes, whispering
“Kid, you have every right to blame me. Hell, I blame myself.” He sighed again, shaking his near-empty cup, “I don’t need you to forgive me. But I do need you to listen to me: don’t let yourself be ruined by this. I already made that mistake; Sam, Claire, Cas, every damn hunter you’ll ever meet made that mistake. I can keep you safe from monsters, but I can’t keep you safe from yourself. Unless you let me. Or someone. Anyone.” He paused, letting Jay absorb his words, and finished off his burger with a lick of his fingers and a last, loud sip of pop.
It hadn’t started coming down yet when the man from before, Dean, sauntered into the store and straight up to the counter.
“Uh, guys?” The tallest one stumbled, bringing up a hand clutching his stomach, now covered in blood.
“What?” At that he turned his attention back to her, and she instantly regretted it. He looked at her so intensely, it was as though the air around her was thrumming.
“Husband. Yes.” Jay nodded and leaned back, shaking. There were still occasional bangs, thumps coming from downstairs. When an inhuman, blood curdling scream rolled through the air, he jumped up. Cas put a hand on a shoulder, next to him in a blink.
“Dean! There they are!” The tall man, the one who bought that flower, shouted at the front of the cave. Then the detective came running up next to him
He heard his Mom call, “Are you having fun without me?” and ignored it, heart thundering harder the longer the man stayed silent.
The darkness coated everything when he stepped into the living room. Unnaturally dark, even without the lights. There was this… sound. Like wet squeezing, with the occasional crack or pop. Holding his breath, he waited for his eyes to adjust. As they did, he could make out what looked like two forms merged into one. Someone laying on the floor beneath someone crouching down, bobbing up and down.
“Cas… Cas, like, Dean’s wife, Cas?” The awkward twitch and pull of the other man’s mouth on anyone else would be a bad sign, but Jay was pretty sure that was him laughing.
So, when Dean asked him if he wanted to learn how to drive his car, Jay was shocked enough that he just nodded yes without thinking. That’s how he found himself sitting behind the wheel, on the side of a road, in the middle of nowhere, with a very confused man next to him.
“Did you see any bizarre creatures on the premises?” The odd man, again. She spoke at the same as the detective:
“Cas!” Castiel still hung motionless next to her. She would shout I’m here too, if it weren’t for the goo over her mouth.
“I was a little brat. Dean and- and Cas, they found me one day and I just… couldn’t. I hated them for killing my dad,” he looked up at that, catching her eyes. She nodded, a sad look on her face, “yeah, uh. They were there for me, too. Only they weren’t. Anyway, um, I went to stay with Jody and my Alex,” she started smiling, looking dreamily down into her cup, “they showed me family again. And Dean, Cas, even Sam… they’re family too. That’s why I’m here, we want to help people. Help kids. I mean, fuck, if it weren’t for Jody…” She sighed again.
“Uh. Sorry. Thought you were someone else, come on in.” He stood there, glancing between Dean’s face and the house behind him, before he sighed, thought fuck it, and stepped in. “Claire’s out on an errand, should be back any minute. Make yerself at home. Uh, can I get you a beer or- no, not that, how about some coke?” He left the room without waiting for a reply.
When he woke up the next morning, caught in a fog of unreality, he found himself in bed one minute, standing in the backyard the next. Staring at that spot. It was early, earlier than the sun. The snow stung his feet.
The monsters were grotesque. They looked like a mix between wolf, fly, and wasp. They oozed at every joint, beady eyes reflecting the world so you could never tell where they were focusing. If they were intelligent, they didn’t show it. They just kept pouring in.
“Castiel,” He breathed in, then, and turned back towards Jay, face softer (thought not soft), “but you can call me Cas.”
A spurt of green-blood-slime flicked across her face as the beast’s head was cut off with a machete, and she muffle-screamed her joy at their victory. One of the men shot her a goofy grin and a thumbs up.
‘I am sorry Dean. I didn’t realise.’ Castiel looked embarrassed at his faux pas, but there was sincerity in his eyes. He turns fully to face Dean, the expression on his face is sympathy, rather than pity.
‘Yeah, Dean and Amara wrote it together. Decided to try it out tonight. Might put it in the new album, break up your monopoly.’ She laughed. Cas tried to smile back. His heart was pounding. He didn’t stay to the end of the set, pleading a headache. Charlie looked at him suspiciously.
She eyed the bike. It was cool. But still. ‘How am I going to get home on this dad? Where am I going to put all my stuff? Do you even have a second helmet?’
It reminded him, he wanted to get Cas to listen and give his opinion so they could make some tweaks before releasing the extended album later that year.
‘Come on,’ shouts Beth, already pulling at her arm. ‘I want to see Jack. Do you think we’ll get close enough to talk to him?’
Dean stays with Cas a couple of days, just long enough to make sure he’s better and ensure he’s not going to do something mad like go back to work. He helps him look for a new job. And they start looking for a new apartment for Cas, just to be on the safe side too.
Thinking back to Dean’s antics this morning she grimaced, hoping no one she paid attention. She missed him so much and the chance to spend any time with him, even if he was being an idiot, was worth it.
Dean looks down. He can see the scenes have been shifted so that all Cas and Ben’s scenes are now squashed into the next two days. The remainder are all Ben alone or with other cast members.
‘I don’t know exactly, but something happened. There was a big disturbance. Rowena came to see me. We tried to work it out. We couldn’t find anything. She thinks it may be something in the past. She thinks someone is trying to change things.’
Dean ducked back into the oven. He has enjoyed spending the last few days together, but he hasn’t missed it. Felt like he and Cas had formed a mini, albeit temporary he knew that, family unit. He couldn’t let Lisa know that.
Dean heads back to LA but they agree to meet up next month and go for that trip they talked about. The agree on the Grand Canyon. ‘It’s classic Cas, how have you not been?’
They unloaded their bags and made their way up the steps, which had been gritted against the heavy snowfall forecast. Upon opening the front door a heavenly smell met them.
They loaded the car and drove off. Claire and Jack both fell asleep in the car after an hour or so leaving Cas with his thoughts.
‘First star to the left and keep on to morning? Just follow your nose Dean. It’s where you’re meant to be.’
Cas screwed his eyes up. ‘Balthasar, I love Dean because he is my friend, because of who he is inside, because he is Claire’s father and not because of how he looks, what he does for a living or how much is in his bank account.’
‘Sorry, Claire, I’ve got to take off a bit earlier than planned. Come give your Dad a hug.’ She got up, looking dubiously at him.
‘Jack? He doesn’t want to interfere. Or whatever happened to get him out. I dunno man. Maybe he doesn’t want to get near us again, doesn’t want to risk it.’
The house isn’t large, but it is welcoming and cosy. His sister introduces him to Bobby and Ellen and Jo, Ellen’s daughter, before him showing up to his room.
Behind the bar Dean lets out a snort. ‘Ha, that’s a joke. Unless he’s doing it by accident in some misguided attempt to act honourably or for the greater good.’
‘Oh yeah’ starts Bobby, ‘I knew I was forgetting something.’ With a smirk he gets up and leaves the bar.
Cas looks down at his coffee. ‘I think he tried to last night. I wasn’t paying attention.’ Dean smirks, he knows why Cas hadn’t been paying attention to Sam.
The tense feeling in Dean’s chest exploded. He stood up and stomped around, then turned and threw his beer bottle as far as he could, hoping it would make the feeling go away.
Jimmy came over and held out his hand. ‘Thank you Dean.’ He didn’t know how to answer. ‘For everything you did to try and save the world, I saw much of it. For everything you did for Claire. It means the world to me.’ He let go of Dean’s hand and held his arms as though to pull him into an embrace, gripped his shoulder. The wrong shoulder.
They all discussed the various ice cream options for a little while. Eventually, Balthasar stood up. ‘Nice to see you both, we had better go off to our table and make a decision on our ice cream. It was nice to meet you Sam. I hope I get to meet Dean soon too.’ He looked at Cas for a moment before picking Anna up and heading for a free booth at the other end of the parlour.
Cas sat quietly in the corner most of the time, surveying his family and mentally expressing his gratitude.
She was in the bathroom when she heard the notes of a different kind of music. Of an electric guitar. She couldn’t recall having seen one in their setup. She listened more closely as she left the bathroom. It was a Bon Jovi cover, much more her style of music. She picked up the pace to get back to the dance floor, but stopped in shock as she got back to the hall to see the dance floor filled with people squashed to the front of the room.
Dean demolishes his half and then starts encroaching on Cas’. Cas slaps his hand away the first few times, but soon gives up.
Dean comes barrelling back into the room just as the breakfast arrives. He is breathtaking covered in sweat with a towel round his neck, muscles gleaming in the sun from the floor to ceiling windows.
‘Sure thing Dean, didn’t know you liked to watch.’ Gabriel spoke around the girl sucking on his earlobe.
The event is not quite as spectacular as the industry parties Dean has seen with Ben. But it’s still pretty awesome.
‘Brilliant. Wonderful. It’s a party.’  Sam looked at him confused again. ‘Gotta go, love you and leave you Sam. Let me know about dinner.’
‘I will not defend my choice. It is a good combination of action and romance. The acting is good. And it’s fun. Don’t mock me.’
‘Uh, Cas is telling him off for the stunt last night. Sorry about that by the way, I thought you knew!’
‘You know, Lisa always told me I should come up here, unwind. I’m kicking myself got not taking her advice sooner.’
‘It’s good Cas. I’m pleased for you. She’s not what I expected. But Balthasar seems keen on her and I hear he’s an old friend. Must know you best. Much better than me anyway.’
He knew that Dean would find someone eventually. Things would no doubt change when first Jack and eventually Claire grew up and left home. He wouldn’t want to stop Dean from finding a partner. But he didn’t want that person that Dean ended up with to drive a wedge into his family, like Lisa had done.
Claire sits and watches her friends chatting away with the various crew and band members who join them for a late dinner. She finds it hilarious watching Beth and Ben compete for Jack’s affection. Alex is locked in an in-depth philosophical discussion with Sam. Freddie has gone off to try out guitars with someone. Kaia is chatting to Charlie, the tour PR manager. She feels a presence next to her as Dean sits down to ask a question.
He’s still unsure that he’s making the right decision, despite what Cas says, he’s not sure what he’s done to deserve happiness. He feels selfish. It’s alien to him, everything he goes is for others. His own thoughts and feelings are usually so far at the bottom of the pile that he can’t even see them. He stops, pondering why his feelings have suddenly made their way to the surface after so many years of repression, of ignoring what he actually wants in favour of what he thinks he should do, what he shouldn’t do to avoid judgment.
Cas awakens with a startle. He glances at the clock, realises he must have nodded off about 2 hours ago. They aren’t far from the city now. The car has stopped.
Realisation slowly dawned on Cas’ face, the single had just come out. It was playing everywhere. It looked like Claire had given Balthasar one of his first drafts. He mentally braced himself.
‘Could you?’ He paused, unsure how to ask, ‘Do you think Ben would be ok here for a couple of days.’
‘You can watch if you like? I’m not sure it won’t make you worry more, but if it’s not knowing what’s going on that is causing you distress, then I hope that will help.’
He rubbed the back of his neck, trying to put his feelings into words, ‘I didn’t understand what your problem was. You just left!’
Cas was behaving oddly too. She suggested inviting his date on a second date, Cas declined. He did however invite him over when Rowena was coming for dinner the following weekend.
He pulls into a glen in the forest. The light is dappled over a small, quaint cabin. There is a garden in more son with what looks like a veg patch. He could give gardening a go he supposes. He’s good with his hands. What else is he supposed to do.
‘Whatever gets me drunk quickest?’ Gabriel arched his eyebrows at the reply. Dean sat down at the bar and downed the drink, motioning for a second immediately.
‘Ha. You’ll see. She’s nice to your face. But I’ll be she has an angle. Maybe she’s after Cas.’ Charlie muses.
They tuck into their pizza. Cas feels like all he’s done all day is eat, but somehow he’s still hungry.
Jack, with Chuck and Amara’s joint power, managed to force the entity to confront them. It looked like Meg again. It kept its strangle hold on Cas.
The rotor blades start and Dean baulks. Cas grabs his hand out of instinct, expecting Dean to pull away. He doesn’t, just looks down at their hands, then back at Cas with a small smile. He does relax slightly after that (with the occasional grimace whenever the helicopter lurches unexpectedly).
He’s going to miss Sam as much as Cas. Sam has become like a brother to Dean. He’s planning a visit next month already.
Dean considers this. He doesn’t know if it’s worse or better. But the thought of Cas going off on his own is almost unbearable.
‘First world problems, Claire.’ He retorted. She opened her mouth, couldn’t think of a quick enough reply, closed it again and went back to her homework.
Dean grabbed Cas by his shoulder, ‘You are so much more than a soldier, you always were. I couldn’t do any of this without you, man.’
He turns when Cas calls his name, downs the rest of his drink and walks slowly towards the house. As he comes into the light, Cas can see he’s wearing a tux, bow tie undone and dangling around his neck.
‘I’m Lisa.’ Another hand is extended towards Cas once he’s finished shaking Ben’s. He takes it and gives Lisa a warm smile.
Cas comes over and places a hand on Sam’s arm. ‘He’ll be back. I will make sure he is ok.’ Sam nods, smiles at Cas. There is trust in his eyes.
She started to falter, to flicker, everything turned hazy. Cas started to shout his name over and over again. Then everything went black.
‘Uh, Cas is telling him off for the stunt last night. Sorry about that by the way, I thought you knew!’
‘No worries,’ he learnt casually against the island. ‘Just having a snooze outside. Making the most of my holiday.’
Dean turned and headed back into the lounge, ‘Come in here and we’ll do introductions properly, Eileen.’
Becky was chattering away to him while he stood and absorbed what he had heard. Something about there being an iron clad pre nup which stopped Alastair leaving Becky without nasty consequences.
‘Sure. I’ll drive you Lisa.’ She beams at him. He avoids her the rest of the evening, busting himself with household tasks.
Cas waits for him to look up. Dean feels overwhelmed by the beauty in the blue eyes that seem to peer into his soul.
Dean pours Claire her own glass of whisky. Upon placing it in front of her he earns a stern reprimand from Cas.
‘Must get your beauty sleep Ben, and I need to hit the hay before the jet lag takes me. See you in the morning.’ Dean leaves his son finishing his drink looking pensive.
Cas looks at Ben seriously. ‘I would love to take you guys. But we’re off to film in the rainforest in Honduras. It’s not very safe. I think you’d better stay home with your dad.’
‘Well I suppose you could see it that way, she is getting divorced from Chuck now, so it makes things much less awkward. Not sure how to introduce her to Claire.’
This time is different. Dean is reserved. Preoccupied. He hasn’t complained about the lack of music in the car, Cas’ driving, city traffic, his flight. Nothing. It’s not like Dean. He enjoys bitching about little things. He enjoys making fun of Cas and his total lack of awareness of any of Dean’s cultural references, his driving like an old lady, his choice of car, route they’ve taken. Cas is disconcerted.
‘I have a friend, Meg, we spend a lot of time together. She’s my oldest friend. She’s fairly honest which I value. Also Gabriel, he’s my cousin. He’s... unusual. But I don’t do much of interest outside of work I’m afraid. I enjoy reading. I would like to have a garden eventually, have a bee hive if possible.’
‘Oh, let me give you the tour!’ Dean wiped his hands on his apron which was covered in flour, before excitedly pointing out the features of the beautiful kitchen. There were windows all along one side overlooking the trees that came right up to the side of the house. There was an impression almost of being in a tree house.
‘If Dean doesn’t mind then yes of course Jack.’ Jack’s smile is a mile wide when he leaves in Dean’s car with Ben, the two boys on the back seat.
It was another glittering champagne reception. The man at the door took their names. Dean felt the disdain when the man, Zachariah, whispered Cas in his ear gave him a once over and clearly found him lacking.
Sam, ever the astute observer, saw the agony in Cas’ face. Came to talk to him, tried to find out what was going on. Cas refused to say. He didn’t want to cause issues between Dean and Lisa.
‘She’s on this job with me. She thinks if I leave it will shut down. She wants this job. Has asked me to stay another season.’
‘No Cas, it’s too dangerous. It’s not the focus of the investigation. What you’re doing is just what I need.’
‘My love, to be saved, everything. I told you before and I meant it. You think you’ve done terrible things. But it was always for love. You deserve the world. And I’ve tried to make it here for you.’
Balthasar looks, if possible, even more sceptical than before. He throws his hands up in dispose and slumps onto the sofa.
Dean spit his drink out slightly, choking on his beer. ‘She’s engaged to my brother. It’s how Cas and I met.’
It’s become Cas’ habit to say goodnight to Dean every night. He doesn’t understand how Dean has become such a fixture in his life so quickly. He’s planning a trip across the country to visit a friend he’s known for only a few weeks and somehow misses after 2 days without him.
They found a local diner serving traditional Eggnog (and a non alcoholic version for Claire) and settled in for a couple of hours.
‘My dating history has been, patchy. I’ve been so focussed on work for so long, I don’t remember the last time I had a relationship. My attempt at dating has been, frankly, terrible.’
She grabs Beth’s hand, ‘Come on then.’ She marches over to Jack. The others are frozen in place, watching.
Cas grimaces, ‘Don’t be. Not for me. My brother and I didn’t get on. His mother was a wonderful woman. She soon saw the real man my brother was. She tried to leave, it was a freak accident. She was running away, he was chasing her, they both got hit by a truck. It was pure chance Jack was in the pram on the side of the road, not in Kelly’s arms.’ He sighed, ‘She would have loved the young man he’s grown into so much.’
He had to admit, her voice was beautiful. He made a note to suggest to Dean to include her on the new album, she would be a real benefit.
Cas watched them all around him, relishing the opportunity. He couldn’t remember the last time this had happened. He had missed it so much.
‘Pleased to meet you.’ Castiel is staring at Dean intently and doesn’t reply immediately. Dean falters at his lack of reaction, pulling back his hand nervously. It somehow spurs him into action. Castiel holds his hand out back.
‘Uh, Cas, I’ve been meaning to speak to you. I’ve had a chat with Sam. He’s ok with you moving back in next week. So would you mind?’ It all came out jumbled. Cas’ face was white with shock. He looked at Dean without speaking.
‘Nonsense Dean. I’ve been waiting for this.’ Dean nods sadly and they go in and drop their bags. Eileen waves from the kitchen where she’s loading the coffee machine.
Claire stood staring after him. ‘What the hell was that?’ Sam didn’t meet her eye. ‘Nothing to worry about Claire.’
She bright them both strong black coffee with plenty of sugar. Neither had managed to move. ‘I thought you were making me pancakes this morning, Dad?’ Dean just growled at her. ‘Fine, fine, I can do my own toast.’
‘I’m sorry Dean. Work has been so demanding lately.’ He launches into an explanation of his trials and tribulations with the diabolical mastermind that is Crowley. Dean seems to follow along and laughs at Cas’ attempts at copying Crowley’s accept, shocked at the depths the man will stoop to.
Cas last day of filming came around quickly. Gabriel suggested going out for dinner to celebrate. The group was fairly small, Dean thought it was likely to just be cast and crew but somehow he got an invite as well.
By Thanksgiving things seemed to back to some kind of normal with Cas and Dean. To use a phrase Cas hates, a new normal, anyway.
As he drew closer he saw a man with his head in the engine, a gouge in the side of the car. He pulled in behind.
After Jack decided to go and rebuild Heaven, and actually stopped for some suggestions before heading off, Sam, Dean and Cas swept the country for monsters for a while. Demons didn’t give them hassle any longer. They were ageing, it was time to retire.
When Dean came home, he tried to broach the subject. Told him how impressed he was with Amara, her voice, the duet.
‘They like to make it seem that way, sells papers, but I’ve been seeing her for a little while. Hopefully see her next weekend. Weekdays are harder. She’s got a kid. I’ve tried to keep it private for his sake.’
Dean went to the kitchen, he had intended to grab another beer but decided something stronger was in order. He came back with two glasses of scotch, put one in front of Cas.
What’s wrong with him? She seemed nice, she was easy on the eye. Like she said, he deserved it. He sat thinking about her touch on his arm. It lingered. It felt comforting, familiar.
A small, somewhat bashful, smile crossed Dean’s lips. ‘I know.’ Cas gets the reference and laughs. Dean drops his hands to his knees, looks at them and seems to make a decision. Looks back up. Green meeting blue. ‘I love you too Cas.’
‘Some people, special people, can perceive my true form, my true voice. It seems that you are now one of those people.’ Cas smiled at Dean. ‘But you’ve always been special to me.’
‘Yes, well I’m sure you’ve got someone else who can take her place and perhaps be the mother Claire never had.’
Sam listened to Dean’s interrogation of Claire for a moment, before getting up to pour them both a glass of scotch.
Claire came home to a very quiet house that evening. She thought they had gone out, but found them both outside sitting silently side by side staring at the night sky.
He looks back at Cas who is now staring at him. ‘Yes, I agree, a duet would be good. Sam’s voice would suit this well.’
‘Yeah, well he’s the one who left. What was I supposed to do? He’s my best friend, even after everything I can’t change that.’
Behind him, another figure strolls over, more leisurely, treading cautiously, eyeing the people surrounding Claire. They have given up staring and are now outright gawping at the spectacle taking place in front of them.
Sam tries to grill Dean during the journey, question why he gave up, because even Dean can’t deny that’s what happened. But he doesn’t know how to explain it to Sam. How does he put into words the fact that from the very first day he met him, Cas put Dean and his welfare before his own, eventually before the rest of the world, that he died for him, that he never thought he would find someone to love him like that, that he didn’t, still doesn’t, see himself as worthy of such love. That he didn’t know how to go on without that constant that he had grown to rely on, to help guide him through his life, to help him be a better man. How could he explain that he loved an angel. A wavelength of celestial intent. An angelic being who had witnessed the dawn of time and all of human history. An angel who had chosen to love such an insignificant and lowly man such as him. And he hadn’t recognised it in time, hadn’t thought an angel possible of such feelings. Hadn’t been able to say ‘I love you too’. And had regretted to more than any of the poor decisions he had made in his life up to that point all put together.
‘I’ve never been to a diner before!’ The little girl piped up. ‘We don’t have them at home. I’m from England.’
He gets the Impala from where he parked her, what seems like lifetimes ago. He turns the key in the engine, listening to the satisfying purr. He pulls out onto the road, following his nose as Ellen put it.
‘Why not Dean? You tell me I am your family. Family love one another. I am merely confirming that fact to you.’
‘Yes but Dean, what if they cast Bradley Cooper?’ Jody had her serious face on. Bradley Cooper was her top Hollywood crush. She’s made Dean promise to take her as his date to the premier of the film in hopes she might meet him.
There was a car he didn’t recognise on the drive, his own in the garage. He walked past it and looked in the back window as it wound down.
Dean whips round. ‘Oh nothing. Just telling Claire about our plans for tomorrow. Benny.’ He gives Sam the eye.
It turns out his instinct was right. Charlie was exactly the right person to help Dean with his book. They hit it off immediately.
‘I don’t think so, I’m sure I would remember such a beautiful woman.’ Cas rolled his eyes behind her back as he smiled his patented Dean Winchester TM smile at her.
‘You did. But we were coming from the wrong direction, and didn’t think she was suspicious. It was easier to track from Chuck’s side, find the changed birth certificates. She has no idea, didn’t even know she was adopted.’
Dean gave a satisfied smile. ‘Someone I know. Thought it was time to come and have a look at the place, she’s always raving about it.’
Cas recoils, words snatched from his mouth. Tears prick at his eyes. He doesn’t know how to respond, so he just sits there. Dean came all the way here from his party to tell him this? He doesn’t understand.
They clung to one another, crying for what had been, for the twenty years of shared memories, before deciding on a trial separation.
Dean walks round the bar. He’s ready for her to do her worst. Her head snaps towards him, eyes blazing. She strides over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him clear off the floor.
He wants to be a proper friend to Cas. Be there when he needs him, not just on the end of the phone. He wants to spend more time just chilling with him, like when he was visiting for a few weeks. Hell if he moved back, maybe they could even be roommates. That idea sparks something in Dean’s mind. He spends the rest of the evening thinking about if he and Cas shared a place, how nice it would be.
Cas had, somehow, forgotten Claire was there. ‘Well I missed you too. I’m glad you’re home.’ He gathered her close in a hug.
‘Surprise me.’ Dean inhales the dark liquid put in front of him, no ice, ahh that’s more like it. He’s curbed his drinking quite a lot since Cas moved in. Doesn’t feel like he needs it as much as before. Plus, he’s getting old. Can’t bounce back as well. The hangovers are a killer now. But he does still like to indulge every once in a while. Particularly in moments of stress.
Sam decided to stumble into the kitchen at that moment. John stood up and went to get another cup of coffee from Sam. Dean continued to stare into his coffee, looking out the corner of his eye at Cas.
When they drop by Sam’s house on the way for Cas to change, Jack has just arrived back early from his trip. There’s an awkward exchange with a short man Dean assumes is Cas’ dad before he leaves.
As he was running late he didn’t have time to stop at Dean’s to drop his things. It didn’t make much difference, Dean wasn’t there all day anyway.
‘Well Cassie, I’ll have to love you and leave you. Dean it was a real pleasure.’ Dean gives a charming smile and a wave.
‘It just clicked. All three of us. Jody decided to adopt us. We were, maybe 8 or 9, so pretty old by then. She looked after us, made us feel loved. For me it was the first time I ever felt safe, secure.’
‘I’ve doomed you Cas. I’m so sorry. That was so selfish of me. You could have had peace, and now you’re stuck here, mortal.’
‘I hear what you’re saying Sam. But I didn’t even know they existed before today. I don’t know if I can trust him.’
After being stuffed full (there were several portions left in the fridge, Cas isn’t sure what army Ellen was preparing to feed) he follows the sound of arguing to the front room.
As Ben and Jack race of, Sam and Dean chuckle and head outside. Dean grabs some beers from the cooler he keeps out there and they slump into chairs. The house backs onto a river and they watch the boats lazily trundling up and down.
Dean wasn’t sure how it happened but in the short time he knew Cas he had somehow made a best friend. They made it through several months of filming and had formed an easy routine. Dean hasn’t felt this relaxed in years.
‘She realised that the role of mother was not one she was likely to excel at. She watched you and knew she could never live up to that.’ Cas smiled at Dean’s clumsy attempt at a complement.
Nothing happens. Jack doesn’t appear, neither does Cas. Dean tries again. Praying to the one person who always answers. The one person, sorry Sam, that he can always count on.
Dean is pouring his heart out, wringing his hands. He wants to punch something, wants to scream until his throat is raw.
The group crowded together in the queue to get in. Posters were flashing up on the big screens above the doors. Cheers went up as the doors opened.
‘The same as 34. I’m not sure why anyone asks that on a birthday.’ He stops, realising his comment was a little rude. ‘I just mean that you don’t notice the passing of the years at the time. It’s only when you look back at what used to be that you really notice the change.’
Dinner is a casual affair, each of them discussing their respective careers and wider interests, as Dean expected Charlie and Dean have a lot in common. They seem to hit it off well, thought he thinks Cas is holding back. That’s only fair really.
‘I’ve been told I’m not that good at relaxing. I’m trying to start. I’ve been told this whiskey will help.
‘Oh, right. I didn’t ever think she was your kind of thing.’ Dean swallowed, steeling himself, ‘But, if you weren’t really with her, your article?’ He blushed, not wanting to admit he had read it.
The next few weeks of rehearsals and costume checks and meetings about who knew what went by in a blur. Dean was starting to understand the process, Cas and Sam were coaching him. The three of them were inseparable.
‘Oh no, I’ve just realised what I’ve signed up for. Dean Winchester taking me to school in a classic, black muscle car that you can hear a mile down the road’.
Cas tries his best, he really does. He wants to cooperate, to make the best of the bad situation he’s ended up in.
Dean notices Castiel seems to let the conversation wash around him. He’s shaken out of his reverie by a touch to his arm, ‘Cas? You ok man?’
He turns to look at Jack, snoring softly. It reminds him of them both so many years ago when they first moved into Dean’s, their house. He misses them all so much.
Sam cleared his throat and looked awkward. Dean stomped off round the side of the house. Cas stared after him. ‘No one Claire. We’re all just a bit tired.’
Sam is holding his breath, has his hand on Dean’s arm gripping tight as things come to a head on earth.
‘Shall we grab some waters before the next act...’ it was too late. They spun back round to the sound of the guitar riff. A lone figure was silhouetted on steps at the back of the stage, holding a guitar. He launches into a guitar solo.
Cas is usually the master strategist. He enjoys plotting his moves and trying to worm out the tactics of the other players.
‘Alright, I’ll be on my guard.’ Turning to the bar, ‘Hey buddy, anything stronger than the fizz on tonight?’
It was nearly an hour later by the time he had quietened. They had sat on the sofa. Dean had fallen asleep in Cas’ lap. Cas stroked his fingers slowly through his hair, marvelling at how odd life was. That after all this time here he was back here again.
Sam raised his eyebrows. ‘No really, he’s nice. But it’s not like that. I just haven’t told him about you guys.’ A blush rose up Cas’ neck.
Soon Ben is setting off around the world to shoot films in exotic locations. He doesn’t need his dad to come with him anymore, but Dean visits sometimes.
The next morning, the warm glow is replaced by a slight headache and queasiness. Dean is chipper as ever, clearly has a higher tolerance for drinking than Cas.
“What? Why do you ask that?” He looked pointedly at the floor, chair, bed… all covered in hair with a distinctly dog-like smell.
“Mom. Wake up,” he started to shake her, “Mama. Mom! Wake up!” He started to pull her into his arms, straightening her clothes (she hated wrinkles), pushing hair out of her eyes (it was always falling in her face), and pulled her into his arms. Rocking back and forth.
As soon as he walked through the door, he knew something was wrong. The smell of iron and old eggs filled the air, silence heavy. He flicked on the hall light, but it just buzzed and flickered a few times before going dark.
A new, beautiful Monday to wash away the unpleasantness of the previous week. The air was thick with the scent of the hundreds of flowers filling the shop, morphing as she walked through the store, occasionally righting an off-kilter pot. A new, beautiful Monday soon to be ruined by the arrival of customers.
“Uhh…” Jay blinked a few times, trying to clear his mind, “will Claire be there?” Dean laughed as soon as he said it.
Ringing them up, he found he couldn’t stop watching the girl. Something about her made his hair stand on-end, his heart pound. It wasn’t just that she was hot, cause she was, and so was the guy, and that wasn’t helping, but there was something more. Something…
“It was boring.” The other, more rumpled man replied shortly and loudly. His hair was just as messy as his clothing. He was staring intensely at the detective. In fact, everything about him seemed... intense. As though he were thrumming with energy. The longer she looked at him, the more unnerved she became.
“Hey, Dad, how was work today?” He shouted down the hall, shooting his mom a mischievous glance. They both laughed at the crash, SHIT!, and I’m- it was okay!, that echoed back to them.
“Young man! What a terrible thing to do, that flower does not belong to you.” The child’s face fell and he dropped the flower on the ground before awkwardly running away. “Get back here!” She sighed angrily as he disappeared around a corner. “Wicked little beast.”
He stood there as Claire came over, silent as she pulled him away from his mom, past his dad, past his sister, and back up to his room.
“I do. You ask people about piles of skin.” He ignored the comment, looking around the store with a look of utter, helpless confusion. She tried not to look at him, he was still as unnerving as before. She pulled her cardigan closer around herself, and was shocked by static on the fabric.
He found himself speechless, staring up at the blue eyes and glowing skin and breathing in the electric air in quick, panicked breaths. Distantly, he heard the sound of footsteps and thumps pounding up the stairs, mashing with the sound of his father crying.
under her breath. The man huffed, “whatever, Jacob” earning a kick in the leg. It didn’t look very hard, but he shouted as he bent over, “Watch it! Jesus.” Jay left them to check the stock room for... industrial salt.
Hanging upside down covered in poo-smelling goo, one has to ask oneself, what led me to this point? That was a question Merrily James was asking herself this very moment.
“Claire enjoys your presence.” He had no idea what the hell was going on. His heart was hammering, he could hear it in his ears, his palms sweating, mouth dry. “You bring her joy and friendship at a time she very much needs it. Thank you.”
Looking into the void-black eyes of his mother, he felt that feeling in waves. Evil. That’s what it was called. He saw the blood dripping from her cheeks twisted into a wicked grin, flesh cracking like it was glass. He saw the flesh stuck between her teeth. Behind her, he saw the torn-apart body of his sister. Laying still in a sea of red.
The man walked back over, two full-sized pies in hand, and a couple bottles of coke. He set them down and handed them over, along with a wad of cash.
“Where is the captain crunched?” His voice was still rough and deep, like the sound before thunder. She blinked, and slowly pointed in the direction of the cereal aisle. He nodded once. “Thank you.”
He sat at the dining room table as his sweaty, dirty hand was squeezed over Thursday night’s dinner. He watched the person he called his mother as she sat laughing over the mutilated body of his little sister. He watched his father sob across from him. He prayed for help, tears stinging the wounds on his face. He prayed for help, and he prayed for his family.
The man finally managed to make his way over and cut down the odd man swinging next to her. She, very loudly, let him know she was still there, but he just grimaced at her sympathetically before turning back to the fight, carrying the other with him.
“Who- what’s your name.” Jay looked at the back of the other man, standing in front of the door. He was rigid, terrifying in an unexplainable way. Like a soldier. He didn’t turn when he answered.
“Though, my feelings for you are vastly more complex than they are for the rest of humanity, or angels, for that matter.”
The quiet of Dean’s mind is telling. Usually there are dozens of thoughts vying for his attention, but now the only thought is him. It fills him with pride to see how devoted Dean is to him already. This relationship with him is impossible, but he’s going to do whatever it takes to have as much with Dean as he possibly can.
Dean stands some time later and opens the complicated metal door. Before he enters, he says quietly, “Good night, Angel.”
Once the meeting is well under way, Dean interrupts. “Excuse me. I’m sorry. I think it might be better if I attend in person.”
Dean moves ever so slowly. His long lashes drift shut as he enters Dean’s space. His full lips barely graze Cas’s before nudging them up just a bit. Then, they lean in for the softest, tenderest kiss. When he breaks it, Cas sighs.
“Just do it. If the thing that is chasing you is what I think it is, you’re better off dealing with the Azevet.”
It doesn’t mean that Dean is taking any chances. He documents all of his progress, including every thought he has on this project. He’s also been looking up signs of early onset dementia, as well as mental illnesses like schizophrenia. He isn’t exhibiting any other symptoms other than the near constant auditory hallucinations, but, hello! That’s a pretty fucking huge symptom.
“It was a lot to process,” Dean defends grumpily as Cas laughs. The sound is so perfect that it makes Dean tear up with joy. He swallows around the lump of emotion.
“The little mosquito-delicate dancing hum in the air, the electrical murmur of a hidden wasp snug in its special pink warm nest. The music was almost loud enough so he could follow the tune. He felt his smile slide away, melt, fold over, and down on itself like a tallow skin, like the stuff of a fantastic candle burning too long and now collapsing and now blown out. Darkness. He was not happy. He was not happy. He said the words to himself. He recognized this as the true state of affairs. He wore his happiness like a mask and the girl had run off across the lawn with the mask and there was no way of going to knock on her door and ask for it back.”
Dean groans at the thought. He wants nothing more than to put his hands all over his angel. Hearing that Cas wants that too is making him yearn. “Is that why you asked about sex, Cas?”
Cas hasn’t moved his hands from where Dean put them, so he guides them to roam over his skin. Finally, Cas takes the hint.
They ultimately decide to start a new lab, rather than deal with intellectual property issues at either  Kansas University or at Dean’s family’s company.
“My what?” comes the gasping response. Dean looks up at him while he moves his hand into his shorts to pull his straining cock out.
Cas looks down and away, sensing that Dean needs to release more ire. His sadness isn’t important right now. He knew that Dean would need to let go of his hope someday; he wanted him to. He just didn’t expect it to hurt so much. While Dean still believed, so did Cas in a small way. Hearing Dean confirm his hopeless state makes it a thousand times more real.
He holds out a placating hand. “I’m not going to be reckless, sweetheart. I don’t want to finally get you free only to die in an electrical accident.”
A quaking starts in the vicinity of the statue that is rocking the cabin, but Dean isn’t going to open his eyes yet. Then, the sound starts. It’s a blood-rending scream that makes him cover his ears.
Cas sniffs and considers him for another moment. “The fact that you question whether or not my gift is a reasonable one is the reason that I trust you to know when humanity is ready for this knowledge, Dean. You are a righteous, honorable man in a world of greed and deception. I believe that you will do what is right for everyone.”
Cas focuses on Dean, which is harder than he would have thought possible. His eyes are as relaxed as the rest of him, unfocused and hazy in afterglow.
Sitting down with the delicious stew and a cold beer, he clicks on the lantern and digs in. With the first taste, he moans in delight and chuckles. “I could have made a damn good husband. That fucker doesn’t know how badly he screwed up.”
There is no response, no sound at all except the distorted squawk of something very large in the distance.
He knows he’s close because he has his very own alligator escort for the final 200 meters. This same gator has followed him for each and every trip, and Dean isn’t sure if he’s curious, or he’s decided that he’s found an easy meal. Any way you slice it, the huge reptile unnerves him. He’s sure that they can sense fear, though, so he tries to ignore the bulging eyes that trail behind him.
Dean waits until Cas is gone before he powers up the array of defibrillators encircling the statue in very close proximity. They are as close as they can be without touching it and getting sent who knows where. He doesn’t let himself hope that this will work. It’s just another experiment in a long line of them.
Propping his guitar up against the cabin wall, he swings his legs out to hang over the side of the porch. “Cas, I hate to disagree with you when you’re saying such sweet things about me, but I’m afraid that your compass is a bit screwy. I’m the only human that you know. Compared to the cave men you knew, I’m sure I seem light years ahead.”
Patiently, he waits for the human to appear. He wonders how they must have changed in all the intervening years. What adaptations might they have made in roughly 300 generations? The sun rises and he senses the human wake. He smiles to himself. This is his first audience with a sentient being in lifetimes.
Dean stretches and takes in a deep breath. He has long since gone without sleeping in anything but boxers out here. Even with his climate controlled sanctuary, he has to come outside to appreciate the view, and it’s just easier to be appropriately dressed for the elements.
There is tentative pride in Dean’s eyes that grows when Cas praises him. “That’s marvelous. Wow. That was much faster than I anticipated.”
Every time they orgasm, their bodies recharge in an instant and they continue their explorations. Over the course of several hours, they have had each other in almost every conceivable way. Whenever Dean tires, Cas’s grace rejuvenates him. Whenever they sweat, it is cleaned away. They don’t even feel sore, despite the friction and rough handling that they’ve both dished out and received.
Dean barely registers that his mouth is filling; his senses are so full of Castiel, his angel. He swallows and suckles, taking care not to spill. Long after Cas has dropped back down to the mattress, replete and sated, Dean nuzzles and places gentle kisses to his sex.
“Now, picture adding this feeling to it,” Dean commands and then he sucks two of his fingers deep into his mouth. Cas is in his head without realizing that he’s made the decision. The wet warmth is enough to pull a sound of desire from him. Then, Dean adds the stroking of his tongue and sweet suction. Cas’s eyes cross with the pleasure of it.
His heart swells with joy as he knocks the dust off of this forgotten skill. Expressing himself through music is something he has denied himself for almost a decade, always too busy working towards his goals to mess around with hobbies.
Cas is proud of Dean. He isn’t a violent being by nature, but there are times when it is appropriate, and considering the vitriol that he’s heard John Winchester spew at his son, he’s fairly certain that this was one of those times. He’s just sorry that he didn’t see it for himself.
Behind him, he hears a flap of enormous wings as a gust of wind whooshes by him. He turns to see Cas, alive and buzzing with an energy Dean can feel from a distance. He stands  but refuses to take his eyes from the angel.
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean hisses as he pictures this stunning creature feeling what he’s feeling. He is vulnerable here, on his knees with his mind wide open to the angel. He can’t help but feel what he feels, regardless of how ridiculous it might be.
Silence except for the frogs and bugs. “I apologize, Dean. I did not mean to cause any harm. I only needed to learn about humans and your language. You are the only human out here.”
“Yet, you brought him here as a sacrificial lamb to get the validation and acclaim that you seek. How far were you willing to go to get it, Dean?”
“You.” The word isn’t accusatory, just a simple fact. “You are the portal, not the statue. It’s never been about the statue.”
