"He said he had a tire for me. Unless, that was a euphemism." Deadpool paused, explaining to himself, "It means a sex joke that sounds like something normal."
In the blink of an eye, Clint’s feet were all Spidey could see as he tumbled over an abrupt drop off ahead in the tunnel.
"Bruce....had it," Tony said, realization dawning as he saw the Hulk. "Oh, man. T-tell me....he sat it somewhere...before Hulking out?"
“Ah, of course.” The muscular blond slung an arm around Tony's waist, half dragging him to the door.
"Has Banner—" Hawkeye sputtered. "No, Bruce's fine. Uh." He glanced over at the blood-covered gauze on his double and ran a hand through his hair nervously. "We sort of got into a...uhhh. You know, what's important is that he's calm now." He nodded. "Yep."
Jeez, the situation was a headache. Peter truly had no idea what he was doing, but he owed it to these two to at least try.
The whisper was so gentle that Peter wondered if he dreamed it. Matt’s voice was always nice to listen to. It probably came from talking a lot in court. He had to be good at speaking for that, right?
Slipping as he landed on the wet sand, Clint steadied himself and looked around. The shore was being struck by wave after wave, washing away the remains of Cap’s sandcastle.
"Well, it's pretty unusual," he agreed, getting to his feet again. "I just don't want to have to think much...and anybody sitting in the rain for hours just for a sandwich sure isn't thinking."
Peter silently apologized to Wolverine for getting his name mixed up in all this. Jeez, it was a good thing none of Spider-Man's loony villains thought to gas him with onion fumes, or he'd be a goner!
“I’m not gonna sit around and watching everybody swim!” Clint scoffed, sitting his coffee cup down hard enough on the fire ring that it sloshed and made the fire sizzle.
"...Spider-Man's psychotic partner, Deadpool." Peter Parker only caught those last few words as he swung past the massive screen in front of the Daily Bugle.
If Peter had come here straight from the bed, then whatever clumsy person had ran away from the kitchen earlier was somebody else. Hawkeye was a likely candidate.
"Probably serrated. I was in a hurry, so I didn't look at the tip much." He leaned down and looked at the arrow in Loki's side. "Hm. Looks painful."
The Jotun sat shell shocked for a second, face turning red. As soon as his senses returned, he struggled in an attempt to escape his rescuer's large arms, unable to speak yet.
Bruce didn't move from his slumped position at the table, listening to Thor’s cheerful booming voice from nearby.
Without comment, the magic infused man casually tossed the arrowhead at them. As it flew, it made a soft hiss, releasing a glowing green gas. It pulsed and Bruce’s head started pounding. It felt like someone had grabbed him by the ears and shaken him.
“Nay, the sky unleashed the perfect weather for our plan without any need of my help,” Thor told Peter cheerfully. A huge roll of thunder sounded overhead, shaking the cabin’s walls, and the Asgardian glanced up at the ceiling worriedly. “…Perhaps a bit too much of the perfect weather?”
“Stay your hand, Hulk—and you, Hawkeye. Have we not had a tiring enough day without decimating our camp with petty fighting?” Getting scolded about wanting to jump into a brawl was rich coming from Thor of all people… Turning to Loki, the big blond added, “Your mortal friends must wonder where you’ve gone. Take your book and return to your camp, brother.”
“Nothing,” Matt told him, smile fading a bit. “Look, my ‘intentions’ with Peter are the same as always—I want to make sure that he’s not caught up in some mess that Deadpool made.”
"The primary mainframe is unresponsive, sir," Jarvis informed him. "I am unable to analyze why, but the backup systems will not activate automatically."
"It must be nice being able to just go do that without worrying about your pulse," he muttered, turning and taking the sunscreen bottle from Clint. "I can't play frisbee, but if you want to play, I'll come over and cheer you on. Sunscreen first, though."
It was nice to be able to talk to Tony again, even if it was temporary. Cap was certain that once they were satisfied Peter was dating someone decent, he and Tony would be right back to distancing themselves.
"Hey. There you go," Hawkeye said as he gave Bruce a nervous smile. "Look at me, the Hulk whisperer."
Peter blinked and glanced quickly from him back to Lola. She wasn’t human? But not an Asgardian, either…
Dr. Banner trudged past them with a beach towel rolled under one arm then, still fully dressed. Peter exchanged a glance with him and got the impression that he had somehow heard every word Peter was trying to say quietly. And he didn't look surprised. Oh, oh no. What if everybody already knew but Peter?
"You know, it might be the rain." Ms. Marvel shielded her eyes, looking back in the direction of the mansion. "Look, the shield only has so much reserve power left. When will the mansion's backup systems turn on?"
The pain surprised the Jotun enough that he gasped. The arrow had actually broken skin. Stepping back, he gawked at his hand as it came away from his ribs coated in blood. When was the last time that had happened?
“You’re right, Peter. This is pretty amazing.” The red headed man sighed and ‘glanced’ at Cap. Then he smiled again, only this time it felt sincere. “I guess it can wait a day or two. I imagine you guys didn’t all come charging out here without making sure that the city was taken care of.”
Bruce sighed, snatching up the medical bag and starting after them. He was sick of this room, too, but he was also sick of Clint tearing up his stitch work.
Carol smiled and didn't say anything. Tony would be Tony and she didn't want to waste time talking about his giant ego when they could be rescuing their teammates from Doom. Who knew what he was doing to them—that guy was weird.
It had been like this for the entire three hours. Peter was starting to get a headache. He was also getting hungry, especially since Wade kept talking about tacos, but eating trail mix by hand seemed unwise when every inch of the cave and of them was soaking wet.
What if this kindly blind man was a super villain in disguise? What an awful trick, pretending to be blind!
Bruce looked at him—kind of. More stared through him. He was probably in a mental struggle with the Hulk at that very moment. Hawkeye grabbing onto him seemed to snap him out of it slightly, though, and he sucked in a breath. It wasn't as deep as it could've been, but it was an effort.
"That's why I'm here to keep an eye on you." He patted Bruce's shoulder reassuringly. It was then that Bruce noticed that Clint had slowly gotten closer over their conversation. He now sat right in front of the scientist, having scooted the donuts aside when he sat up. With another pat on his shoulder, Clint flashed him a grin. "Don't worry about it. I'll keep you out of trouble."
"I think the ice helped it meld to my skin," Clint joked, before calling to Thor, "Got him! Let's get off of this mountain!"
Shaking off his bemusement that Cap and Tony had apparently encountered the shark he’d just made up, Peter shot Matt a little smile in greeting. If there was a real shark, at least nothing too terrible had come of it—and they’d agreed to cancel the race! Somebody would get the flags they’d put out on the sandbar someday.
Loki let out a long sigh, smiling up at Bruce. The brown haired man was sort of handsome, in a scuffy kind of way.
There was a total lack of reply from the room he'd just exited. Before he could decide whether to teleport or not, though, a pair of enormous green hands stuck through the hole in the door, grabbed the sides, and wrenched it off of its hinges.
“Sure,” he said quietly, and scooted back over to where he’d been sitting before, hugging his knees up close to his chest again. “…Did you two really come out here without even a sleeping bag and choose to sleep on a rock?”
"That's great, Doom did it, right?" Tony's face appeared on the card and his voice came from it. He looked a bit tired, Peter thought.
"Do you think Spidey still likes hotdogs? Last time we got them together, he didn't even eat it. He just scraped it off and gnawed on it for bit. Hey...do you think he sometimes eats flies? He leaned in to stare at her with a large white eye on his mask, whispering loudly. "You know, like on instinct."
Tony gave a sigh of exasperation and started to paddle over there. So much for a quiet camping trip with the team…
Clint quietly ate his ice cream, watching the ocean down the stairs as it swirled. The sky was a very vibrant blue with distant clouds surrounding it like a picture frame.
“I know you think I’m old fashioned and behind the times, and you’re right. I was so slow to catch on to how you felt, you beat me to it.”
"I'm going to dress this wound and give you painkillers," he told Loki. "After that you can do what you want."
“If there really was an issue, you’d think Hawkeye would have been hurt by now. I think we should just leave them alone. It’s none of our business.”
“Maybe the Hulk-sized footprints all over Peter’s demolished campsite,” Tony shot back, but with a lot less steam now. He looked uncertainly at Steve.
He started walking again, but glanced over his shoulder. Bad idea--set a sway into motion he had to take a couple steps to counter-balance. "What's so bad about Peter actually being serious, anyway? What, he has to be a moody brat about relationships just because he's in high school, is that it?" The gay part was actually more bemusing, because Tony was dead positive the kid was bisexual. He'd had a girlfriend before, right?
Dropping the marshmallow he had been holding, Cap ignored it and grabbed another, stabbing it on the stick with a frown.
Perhaps Loki had found the Hulk switch. He felt like throwing his head back and laughing, but that would give him away. Just a bit. "And," Loki held up his hand. "before you freak out, I wasn't going to 'try anything.'"
"Uh. Yeah, she seems like it?" He offered uncertainly. "I'm sorry, I'm still back at the part where you both just told somebody you're my DADS. That's..." He shook his head, cursing his suddenly-misty eyes.
The lights of Latveria's tiny capitol—and Doom's castle—glowed ahead of them in the twilight. Directly attacking a place loaded with murder robots wasn't a bright idea; hopefully they would be more subtle than that.
Cringing, from both pain and the fact that he had failed to sneak past, Loki turned back to look at him.
"Alas, there are not enough beds for all, but I will gladly give you mine." Thor's voice sounded over the storm, directed at his female friend no doubt, and as soon as Tony realized everybody could hear him he clammed up and fell silent.
“Hey, hey,” Clint said tiredly, struggling to muster the energy to give a shit. “Who’s Peter talking to?”
"I'll be back before you know it," he promised, smiling and stepping down the beach toward the mysterious woman. "I should get off the phone--Tony wanted this to be a no-tech vacation so we'd actually hang out with each other. I took the call because it was you, but I think he and Cap need some cheering up. Maybe I'll go pretend to need advice so I can feel them out and figure out what's the matter already." He paused, realizing he was thinking all of that aloud. "Uh, anyway I gotta go. I'll talk to you again soon, okay?"
Steve quirked an eyebrow, giving Tony a look. Sometimes, the God of Mischief sure reminded him of the billionaire.
“I don’t care if Daredevil hears us,” Steve sighed. “If he wants to stick his nose in our business, I can’t hold that against him. We’re doing the exact same thing.” Lifting the paddle from the water, Steve shifted in his seat to look back at Tony, blue eyes challenging. “If you have something to say, go ahead and say it.”
Hawkeye was still staring at his double, this time frowning. He circled out away from the door, looking Clint up and down. The other blond just raised an eyebrow at him, a hand pressed to his bandaged side.
“There you are,” Steve said, giving him a smile as he stepped off of the last step. “Listen, there are only eight beds between both cabins, so I want you to share a room with Tony. Is that alright?”
"I wouldn't, if Tony didn't make jokes about military food," Pepper sighed. "It looked like he unlocked my shackles with some kind of magic. Green light. Do you think he locks the cells the same way?"
“Wade’s been obsessed with Peter since they met and Peter tolerates way more of Deadpool’s nonsense than I ever could.” The redhead frowned off to the side. “If I was Peter, I’d keep dating Wade a secret too. Especially with parental figures like YOU two around.”
"I'll use my card," Peter said quickly, grateful for the change in subject. Great, Johnny had gone from thinking Deadpool was his partner to worse!
He wasn’t willing to add to Tony and Cap’s argument by asking what the Hulk WAS doing. Bruce had said something about running into a bear.
Meanwhile, Tony noted, Thor was looking like he wanted to get Loki a blanket or something. However, he seemed like he didn't want to let go of his brother's hand to go and get one. Loki seemed unusually calm and quiet. Probably from all of the blood loss.
“Well, Fury had arranged for everyone to take over our patrol areas, so technically we could take a few more days off back home. I think people nowadays call it a ‘staycation?’” Cap ventured, looking to Tony for confirmation.
"Yeah, I'm fine," Peter assured him. "I mean, besides you and Tony looking like you're ready to make somebody into a body and bury it on the beach! I know Wade puts his foot in his mouth sometimes, but wow."
"That old guy needs to come with me so I can impress Spidey's dad. Then me and him can become friends—play baseball together, golf and then Spidey and me'll get hitched, buy a house, and have two and a half kids—and half a dog." Deadpool paused in his long winded explanation. "I think that's how it goes..."
Peter caught his shoulder and the red-clad hero turned with an impatient huff, crossing his arms. "Why right now?" Peter asked sadly. "I'm not excusing what Wade did, a-and okay, if you think he needs to be back there to sort it out then I believe you, but can't you hold off a few days? Even a day, just one more day before you take him away?"
“You sure we’re talking about the same Peter, here? I’m Tony, by the way,” he said suddenly, smiling. “And this’s Steve.” He did not hold out his hand, probably because the man wouldn’t have been able to see it anyway.
That left Ant-Man and the Wasp—already seeing one another, so perhaps a tasty scandalous choice—Captain America, Black Panther, and Iron Man.
"It's not his fault, Cap," he said sadly. "It's me, I'm the one who doesn't want to go public. I guess...that's pretty horrible, huh? Especially if you think so." He sighed and sat the rest of the s'more down on a nearby candy bar wrapper, poking at it.
A little splashing sound caught Steve’s attention. When he glanced at the source, he saw a small smooth rock skipping far out across the lake surface. A familiar hearty laugh came from down the lake shore a ways. Thor and Bruce were standing there, the scientist holding up the next stone.
“Oh, the jerky had protein in it, we’re good!” Peter smiled and grabbed one of Wade’s arms, tugging on it. He looked comically slight and small-statured beside Wade, who in the daylight looked far more muscular than Tony remembered. He was no Steve or Thor, but still.
"The edges of the wound seem weaker, but I still had to use the titanium needles Tony made for Captain America last time I did the stitches," Bruce said evenly. He placed a hand on Loki's side near the wound and then dabbed some of the alcohol around the edges as gently as he could. "This will sting—I'm sorry."
“Very well, perhaps a documentary is on somewhere,” Jarvis mused. The TV screen flickered through various channels a few seconds at a time.
Bruce easily fell into step beside him, keeping hold of one of Clint’s hands. He was still smiling, shaking his head.
“I’ve got a first aid kit, I’ll redo the stitches if I need to,” he told Cap. “Again.” He glanced at Clint and started down the trail without any further comment.
"Hey, where are we going?" Peter asked curiously, reminding Cap he was still leading the kid along by the arm. "If you don't need me, maybe I better help Hawkeye make breakfast. Looks like he's about to throw the whole pack of bacon in that pan at once!"
“Whoa—Cap, what’re you doing!” Tony’s hands were on his shoulders, pulling him backward. “Jesus, it’s just a meatball recipe, it’s not worth it!”
Oh, great. It was Aunt May, and she sounded worried for him. Pete sat up just as he heard a voice over the crowd.
“Hey, calm down buddy—I'm just going to get rid of the fake mes.” The glowing Hawkeye pulled another arrow from his quiver, aiming at the injured—and strangely unaffected—Clint.
“This is like a monsoon,” Bruce said loudly from just behind him. In the thunder and driving rain, he still had to practically shout to be heard. “Come on, let’s get inside!” The scientist stepped past Clint and tugged on his hand, heading for the door to their cabin.
“Jeez, Bruce camps all the time. He knows how to avoid being mauled by a bear, Cap,” Clint groaned, rolling his eyes. “Right, buddy?”
Meanwhile, Peter was looking at Lola’s golden fingernails and long black hair and green eyes and feeling the weirdest sense of deja vu. He was dead positive he’d never met the woman before, so why?
Loki went to him immediately, pressing a kiss to his cheek and hugging herself against his chest happily. She smiled back Peter’s way.
Focus and find Wade, he reminded himself, looking at the sea of faces. How many people was Loki camping with? It looked like a couple bus loads full.
“Talking to him,” the scientist replied, running a hand through his hair. Still looked messy afterward. A little messier, even. “I think this morning was the first one-on-one conversation we’ve ever had.”
"So, nothing? I mean, other than fishing?" Clint gave him a quirked eyebrow as he leaned on the wall next to Bruce, intelligent blue eyes scanning his face. "You know, I don't know that much about you. I know you study gamma radiation, sleep on your face at your desk and like fishing—but do you actually do ANYTHING else?"
Steve listened for any sounds of where they might be. Rain? No. Traffic? None. They were probably underground somewhere.
Clint was lounging on one end of the couch, his hood down, arms crossed over his chest…and a sandwich hanging out of his mouth. Stopping at the other end, Bruce blinked.
Ducking across the kitchen, Cap grabbed frozen patties from the freezer and an armload of condiments from the actual fridge before he shut the door.
"I guess it's not like I could tell anyway." Clint tugged at his sopping shirt. "Man, we probably should have just stayed in the boring lab." After a moment of thought, he cringed. "I hope no one comes looking for us at the lab. They might freak out if we—well, you—weren't there."
The waffle iron had turned off when it went through its cook time. There wasn't any burnt smell, so maybe...
…Which kinda sucked when Clint wanted to help him put on sunscreen. Shaking his head to dismiss the idea, Clint shut and zipped his suitcase shut, just to have something to do that WASN’T staring at Bruce’s back.
"Mm? Yeah, but I gave her surgery." He did a fist pump in the air. "Now baby got back!" Hopping lightly off the roof and rolling to his feet, the mercenary slapped a hand on Wolverine's shoulder. "Thanks for the loan, man!"
“Jeez, I’m standing right here,” he sighed. His image wasn’t THAT bad… Okay, maybe in Manhattan, but people in Queens knew what was up. At least, he was pretty sure they did.
“Tony, if we were together, things would be different,” Cap began, but he shook his head. “Never mind. What did you want to tell me?”
"You guys don't know him," Peter said, looking after the other two like he wanted to follow them. Turning sad brown eyes on both Steve and Tony, he added seriously, "I know you've probably heard all sorts of awful things, but if you trust me at all, you'll believe me when I say Wade's NOT a bad guy. You really think I would trust a bad guy with my real name and risk my aunt and my friends?"
“Oh yeah. Great!” Clint unceremoniously yanked the hook out and threw it into the waves. It was the damn tackle box! It was haunting him now! Mocking him! Shoving his profusely bleeding finger into his mouth, he scowled and kept waving the metal detector.
“Nay, my friend, Tony Stark is in excellent health. Pardon, I must return to my duties!” Placing his helmet back on his head, Thor spun Mjolnir and flew off, circling to land on the roof of the mansion.
Wishing he could double check that story with Peter, Steve was relieved to see the campsite come into view around the trees.
Bruce finally noticed the tracking bracelet on the archer's wrist. He looked Clint over in a very neutral way (or maybe just exhausted?) before replying, "I could sit on the floor if you'd rather."
“What Tony does is his business. As long as he does what he needs to do to keep the Avengers together, I keep my nose out of his private life. I’m done arguing with him about it,” Cap told him quietly, taking a long sip from his root beer like it might have been an ACTUAL beer.
Looking at the half-sunken kayak Cap still held onto, the brunette said hastily, “I-I saw a shark! Yep, shark, at least a six footer. We probably shouldn’t be out there in kayaks with him around, just to be safe.”
Stepping in after him was…Steve. The blond man carefully turned and shut the door behind him, casting a glance in Tony’s direction. As he noticed that Tony was awake, he gave a small nod in Daredevil’s direction.
"I'm alright, Thor," Steve said, patting the massive man's chest. "Bruce, is Tony still in the basement?"
Plunking down in the chair next to Tony’s, Steve shook his head. Aside from missing his glasses and cane, Matt seemed to be in a very bad mood. Hopefully he didn’t blame the Hulk’s rampage on poor Peter.
Unsurprisingly, both women looked at him in alarm. The taller one pointed down the beach with a hand.
"Uh, that's Red Skull," Tony corrected, snickering a bit. "Yeah, if they managed to catch Cap we need to haul Bruce into the mix, and that means we're not going anywhere." He waved an arm for emphasis. Popping up the face of his mask, Stark added, "Although the Hulk might be overkill."
"They say he's still out there somewhere, getting his skin stolen and growing it back again, over and over. Him and the madman in their own dimension, just them and a big gross pile of skin..."
"Jeez, Jameson, half an hour ago you were calling Cap and all masked superheroes vigilantes," Peter Parker muttered to himself, glancing up at the TV. "You could at least keep your OPINIONS straight, even if you lie on TV all the time!"
"We went to get sandwiches," Clint said honestly. He would just leave out the part about kissing Bruce while he was naked. "I think the lightning spooked him."
"Do you know if any of the Avengers are interested in each other besides Hank and Janet?" Bruce asked, fidgeting. It sounded like what he really wanted to ask was if any of the Avengers were queer, but most of them were male, so without Jan that was practically asking the same thing.
Bruce definitely kept glancing around at the people as they walked, sticking close to Clint's side. He had a carefully neutral look on his face, and seemed to regret leaving his hoodie behind in the cabin. When they reached the water, he practically charged into the waves like he was escaping dry land.
"Hey Jarvis, tell Bruce he can work on that cure now," Tony told the computer a little too brightly. He shot Cap a thumbs up.
If Bruce got hold of it, the freckled scientist was going to spend all week sitting by the water and ignoring Clint.
"I never left, you know." The tired comment managed to make Pepper jump slightly. Glancing quickly, she realized that Dr. Banner was in the far corner of the room, some vials of glowy liquid in his hands and a greenish glint in his eyes.
The beach was much quieter off to this side, the distant laughing and bonfire crackling drowned out by the soft shushing waves rolling over the shore. The water here was deep enough to swim in right near the shore, with a few rocks out there. Looked like a prime mermaid sighting spot, if mermaids were even a thing. Tony made a mental note to bother Thor about that later, sighing and stooping to pick up a seashell. Throwing something as far as he could out to sea sounded nice right now.
Waking up enough to adjust his makeshift pillow, which was the first aid kit, Clint rolled over and sighed. The Hulk was usually a lot more comfortable to sleep on.
"My allies are not cruel like those you are often in league with," Thor said, rather gently. "And if they were, I would not allow any harm to befall you. You know that my word is good."
Bruce shivered a little, wondering what he was about to say. Oh, he didn't want to deal with that right now...especially since he wasn't sure which Clint was the real one. He knew which one he WANTED to be the real one...
Slowing down to make sure Matt safely followed the curve of the trail, Steve frowned and looked at the blind man.
The Hulk roared and leapt out the window after the blonde woman, swinging his arm to snatch her out of the air.
Matt and Wade not getting along was really bothering him, and he’d laid awake a long time last night thinking about it. It was pretty optimistic to think a guy like him could manage to maintain even one relationship, never mind two. Two that couldn’t cross paths without bitterness and Peter feeling guilty any time he paid attention to one over the other REALLY sounded tough. He really cared for both of these guys, though—what was he supposed to do?
"Clint, wait..." He wondered why this bothered him so much. Maybe because the other Clint had been the one who kissed him, so...if he was fake, so was anybody caring that much about Bruce. Or something selfish like that.
“Hey, quiet, I think I hear something!” He waved a hand vaguely over his shoulder, not really paying attention to the others. No, his attention was focused ahead. There was a low ‘shhhh’ sound that hadn’t been there before. “I hear moving water over that way!” He took off in the direction of the water without waiting for Clint and Wade. They’d follow—no amount of bickering had made them lose track of his bright Spidey belt light yet.
Bruce took the vial and carefully poured it into the glass he'd handed Cap before, which was empty at this point.
"T'Challa hasn't been paying attention to Cap and Tony," Peter whispered, looking saddened. "Unlike YOU, who went and gave Tony a bunch of tequila last night. What was that about?"
"How about this, Cap?" Peter held up the twig with the little seaweed flag he'd just stuck it through, waving it. Tony gave a thumbs up from his seat.
He knelt in front of Tony, placing a hand on his knee. "I'm rich, I have lots of guns and I'm unemployed at the moment—so I'll be able to take care of him, protect him, and give him all the love he needs." The entire speech was accompanied with sweeping arm gestures and loving tones. "Oh, and I'll have him back here before midnight. M’kay?"
The archer stood quietly staring at the ground, red faced. Rubbing his neck, he cleared his throat to speak.
"How about lightning?" Clint suggested, making a little wave over his head, like Thor did with his hammer.
"We're almost home," he added, looking down at the lights of the city. The Avengers mansion wasn't hard to spot.
Unsticking his hand, Peter sighed and took a step back from the blond, pushing on his chest to put some space between them.
“Really? Oh no, they think you’re a regular blind guy out here with Loki and lake monsters on the loose?” He smiled despite himself, leaning to hug Matt with one arm. “Now I get what Tony meant about it being lucky, you running into them instead of Loki. Did they even know you know me, or did they just take you back to camp for your own safety?” That did sound like something Cap would do…
THe Hulk stepped behind the couch and proceeded to shrink back down to Bruce—who promptly fell over on his stomach on the floor.
After a wide display of emotions paraded across his face, Tony patted the hand of the blond's that rested on his shoulder.
“Baby, let’s tie him to a tree with a note and go! We’re never gonna find the treasure at this rate!”
Distant blue eyes glanced up at him from where Steve was seated in the sand and the blond man shook his head, taking the root beer bottle.
Grabbing his hands, the brunette stood up and stepped right up next to him, glancing around them again. Now that they were standing, several beachgoers had noticed them and were whispering as they passed by.
"It will not stop bleeding!" The slim demigod growled, sitting up and glaring down at his side. Now that he wasn't sporting his Clint disguise, he looked crazy pale. As he lay back down, he held a hand out to Thor. It was an odd move for Loki.
"Playing questions and answers isn't how we're going to sort this out," Bruce said carefully. "Scientific evidence is. Besides, how do I know you're not making it up?"
Loki scoffed, sinking down in his chair a bit more. Despite that, he looked bothered as he stared down at the burned out campfire.
The shivering blond man looked disappointed at this, turning his attention back to the TV. A blood spattered baby sat back in its crib, sucking on the thumb of the burglar's arm.
"Not so fast." Cap nodded to the door. "I want to speak with you alone." If he played along well enough, perhaps he could buy some time for the other Avengers to notice their disappearance.
“Bruce, why don’t you stay in the room with Clint? Hulk likes him. I think,” Steve told them with a frown. “The brochure said the beds were hammocks, so at least there’s not much to smash.”
"No, it—" Clint groaned, blushing and rubbing the back of his neck. "It kinda had nothing to do with him." He dared a glance up at Bruce. "Just you."
"Y-you make my heart pound," Bruce said a bit awkwardly, looking down. The ground was muddy and the Hulk's footprints were still there, filling up with rainwater. "But you wouldn't have if I didn't ask you to let me try...right? I thought I could stay calm, and I was wrong. It's on me."
“I’m not into blonds, either,” he clarified. “I like brown—brown eyes, brown hair. Sorry buddy,” he added, patting Bruce’s back in an attempt to reach the Hulk.
"Couch? No no, he's going right to the medical room," Tony insisted, hurrying after the two. He stuck close to Steve and kind of hovered an arm near his back in case the blond started to tip over, popping up the face of his suit and leaning to get a better look at Steve.
Bruce stepped past him, feeling strangely ashamed of himself. Clearly he'd missed some signal, there. He paused in the middle of crossing through the gate and turned to face Clint, looking at him glumly.
The Hulk growled something under his breath and gave the shield one last glare before heading for the door.
“I figured if I stayed around, the two of you would find a way to ambush me.” Daredevil ducked back down to the luggage and dug for what Tony assumed was a pair of pants. “What do you want to know?”
“Oh? Aye, of course…” Taking his hand, Thor shook it heartily, smiling. “I am glad to meet you, Matt.” Growing solemn, he added worriedly to both Matt and the others, “I have had little luck in locating Peter. I flew over the mountaintop twice and the only clue I could find was…well…” Releasing Matt’s hand, he turned and picked something up from the table beside the campfire.
Knowing anything about Daredevil told Clint that the redhead was probably listening in on all the conversations around the campsite, Tony included.
It took an embarrassingly long time for Peter to realize that the cabin’s power wasn’t out at all—the lights were just off because nobody had been in there before they showed up. By chance, he’d instinctively tried to flip the light switch in the bathroom and startled himself with the sudden bright light. Returning to the kitchen where Matt and Wade were still eating the sandwiches they’d just made, he flipped the switch to that room as well.
There was most definitely a look exchanged between the two of them, Tony shaking his head the tiniest bit. Probably didn’t want to cause a scene in front of “civilian” Matt, Clint was guessing. Hilarious.
“No, no. Tony and I aren’t homo… Aren’t together,” he corrected himself, shaking his head slowly. “That article was also faked. Someone is very talented at manipulating photographs.”
Peter stared, too, the Spider Sense blaring tingly alarm now like somebody had poured water on his head. It was a good thing Wade had a healing factor, but that still had to seriously hurt!
"You're supposed to be unconscious by now," the driver grumbled back at them. Not panicked, just irritated, like he was complaining about the bad weather or something. He jerked his arm away, tearing his shirt sleeve in the process, and took the wheel again with a snicker. "Forget it—we're almost there."
"Your lies are pathetic." Leaning to look Tony in the face, Loki frowned. "Aww, must you die now? It seemed we had a bet going."
Peter still felt guilty for walking off on Cap earlier, but his mind was unchanged--those two had something more going on between them. Maybe if he and Wade hurried up with the meatballs, they could leave and let Steve and Tony talk. He picked up the pace on the meatball shaping, hoping Wade would catch on and follow suit.
"Oh, it is, and the power's out over half of downtown, too," Tony called after them. "Have fun!" There was the sound of his armor's boosters firing behind them as they headed outside.
"Puppy eyes. Right," Peter said, standing up. He glanced at Matt. "I'll give them the kayak idea and a reason why it's so important. If you don't mind being the bad guy a bit, Matt, I've got an idea for that part..."
Off in the shadows behind where Clint was sitting, Tony noticed T’Challa heading off into the night, a big handmade fishing spear in his hand. The King had apparently gotten so bored he’d made himself a weapon. Hopefully Clint didn’t see and get any ideas about bushcrafting a bow and arrows.
"T-thank you, Bruce," Captain America said sincerely. He sat down beside Loki, coughing into the crook of his elbow. "When...did you s-say Tony was coming b-back? He s-shouldn't—" he doubled over, rasping. After finally gasping, he began again, speaking quickly. "S-shouldn't be out alone w-when Doom is k-kidnapping people."
The guy was really tall, Pepper thought as she was led along. Well, any friend of Spider-Man's was a friend of hers, but he sure had some odd ideas about Tony and Steve...
“Why would Matt lie to me about that part?” Tony sounded almost hopeful he had been lying, though. Wade just seemed like a real oddball during their campout, but the name Deadpool held all sorts of other darker connections. “I asked him directly, Cap. He confirmed Peter’s with Wade, and he used the word ‘dating’ about him and Peter, too. I’m not sure about Matt and Wade being with each other, but Peter seems to be their common ground.”
“Why do you still have your mask on?” Johnny asked, looking up at Peter curiously. Spider-Man shrugged his shoulders.
“Hey, I’m not Wolverine!” The merc argued. Grabbing Peter, he hauled him a few steps away to whisper to him. Loudly. “What the hell is this guy’s problem!”
The blond scientist didn't seem hurt, but mention of the frisbee game made him fidget uncomfortably.
"He's a good kid," Tony said, "But he's also a very SMART one. Doesn't it seem kind of weird that he's all excited to spend time with both Wade and Matt, but the teams are two people so he can't do the kayak race with both?" He stopped short, a very strange idea occurring to him. "Oh... Oh, no."
Finally, he said, “Hulk doesn’t spend much time with Spider-Man, so no. Steve and Tony, though, are not fooling anybody. Thor, either.” He frowned, threading a needle with some medical-grade thread. “That’s about half of the team, isn’t it? Unless you’re straight, I guess.”
Clint froze on his way to his dresser, suddenly noticing the startled look on Bruce's face. "Easy, buddy," Clint whispered. Holding out a hand toward him, the blond gave him a nod as well. "Deep breath."
"Well, listen, he's safe while he's with us on vacation. We just talk to him this week, get a better idea of what we're dealing with, and go from there," he said. "Or YOU talk to him, because he talked to you so he knows you already know. Pretty sure this is a 'swings both ways' situation--takes one to know one--but if he said gay then gay it is." He groaned. "Swings both...that's the kind of joke he'd make about himself, isn't it?"
“Hey, this isn’t a YOU problem,” Clint told Bruce, tossing a hand at him. Internally, he was screaming at himself.
“I’m sorry, Clint,” Cap told Hawkeye, stepping up to the table side. “He’s barely slept in the last three days.”
"You were making my heart pound," Bruce said evenly, taking the pants from him and focusing on them. He just held them for the moment, looking at them sadly. "I-I would've liked to..."
Rather than inform Clint that he was boring like usual, this time Bruce was compelled to heavy, awkward silence. He was second-guessing everything Clint said now, and trying very hard not to think about the fact that every inch of his room in the mansion had cameras in it.
He sighed heavily. “I still don’t get it. He’s way too smart for this. Since Deadpool knows he’s Peter Parker, all it would take was for that guy to blab to some super villain and Peter’s family and friends would be targets, Matt included.”
Normally there wasn't any resistance involved with a needle THAT sharp, Clint thought, squinting at his duplicate’s arm.
It was Hawkeye, complete with his mask and bow strapped to his back. His clothes were dirty and he was soaking wet.
Stunned, Cap caught him and hugged him in return, unsure what to do. Gingerly, he patted Wade’s back.
There was a loud gasp of pure shock from the floor behind them and the injured Clint stood back up, shoving past them both.
"I-I don't think that's a good idea." He wondered if Clint was chilled, and wanted him there for warmth. Great, now he felt bad for assuming otherwise.
"I'm not so sure that's a good idea," Peter said, frowning after the two as they walked off. He turned to Cap, looking at him sadly. "I'm sorry I told you I had a boyfriend when I don't yet. It's one reason I never really mentioned liking guys; I know it should still be valid to say I swing both ways even if I've only dated girls, but I feel like an impostor." He sighed, glancing the way Wade and Tony had gone. No screams or laser beams coming from over there yet.
“Yeah, YOU! You know this was my weekend with Spidey and you show up, actin’ all cute with his dads! What the hell, man! I’m trying to make a good impression here!”
As if on cue, soft footsteps sounded on the steps behind him. Bruce paused beside him on the same step, a rolled up beach towel under one arm and a weary expression on his face. He followed Clint's gaze out toward the beach.
"Sorry." The blond frowned guiltily. He reached up and patted Bruce's shoulder. "Man, kind of glad I did though." Hawkeye smirked. He moved his hand to the brunette's neck, running a thumb along his chin. "It's nice to actually see you."
There was also something in there about being a socially awkward scientist who wasn't sure he was okay with pursuing another man...but the rest was enough for now, really.
"Okay, okay." The Jotun got up and came over to Bruce. Scruffy, smart and powerful. Not all that bad for a mortal. There was of course the question of whether or not Bruce was technically even mortal anymore. Whatever the case may be, soon they would be alone and Loki could play with his new toy.
“Um, okay,” he managed, slinging his tank top over his shoulder. “I’m just going to be--” Clint cut himself off abruptly, spotting a young couple of women down the beach. They were holding a metal detector.
"Then let me go, Bruce." The blond sat up as much as he could, closing the distance between them. He tilted his head up at the brunette, eyes tired but still sharp. "You know I'm me. Please."
The scent of tequila caught Cap’s attention and he glanced across the campfire to see Clint holding a bottle and chatting with Tony.
“You know how I said before that I’m not with MJ anymore, right? Well, I came out to Cap the other night, too. I-I thought bi was the right label, but now I’m not so sure it is.” God, he was babbling! He needed to shorten this up, but he was really nervous to get to the actual point, because the point was the part that involved Matt. “I think, maybe… Um. D-do you think Wade likes me?”
Snagging his arm, Steve pulled him gently back over, whispering, “Speaking of Peter, did you hear what he and Wade were saying?” The big blond sighed and shook his head. “I’m not sure that Wade likes Peter the way that Peter likes him.”
“I know,” Thor replied, cutting off Tony, who had been about to reply with something. Now he just frowned out at the blond demigod instead. “I suspect neither is Banner, or there would be more fallen trees and destruction. It is YOU I came here to see, brother.”
After the encounter with Loki, Steve, Tony and Thor had gone back to the tents. The Asgardian had volunteered to go back down and check the woods near the lake in case he could locate Bruce, so it was just Steve and Tony in the camp at the moment. Rain thumped loudly down onto the tents, but since they’d already been wet from the lake swim, nobody had bothered to take cover yet.
Was he? Wade seemed kind of harmless while on vacation, but Cap hadn't heard great things about Deadpool. He trusted Peter's word, though, that the blond wasn't a bad guy. Prone to mistakes, maybe...
Captain America shook his head 'no,' climbing gingerly to his feet. He leaned on a nearby medical table for support.
"Cupid's not coming outside with me," the Hulk said firmly. He looked around the kitchen, seemed annoyed that whatever he was looking for was not there, and headed for the living room.
Bruce popped up beside him, shaggy brown hair hanging in his eyes and his white T-shirt practically transparent plastered to his chest.
"Hah," Tony muttered, swigging his root beer. "So you admit you've been avoiding me. Great, that makes me feel better."
“Staycation is exactly right,” Tony said, flashing him a smile. Wow, they agreed—they were agreeing with each other! A little sandbar time really had done them a world of good. “We’ll see how long that lasts with us at the mansion in the same town where trouble usually starts. I’m all vacationed out, though. Hammocks sound great until you sleep in one for a few days.”
Before he forgot that he was holding it, Bruce carefully tucked the capped syringe with Steve's cure in it into his pocket.
"Cap," Tony said grimly, grabbing the front of Steve's shirt. "I figured it out. Some SHIELD agent must be dating Spider-Man to get close enough to figure out his real identity!"
"Then you had better start to cooperate," Doom said, hovering his metal fingers (gloves? It was kind of confusing, he never took them off...) over Clint's midsection far too close for comfort. "Tell me everything you know about the Asgardian—the so-called 'god', Thor—or you shall be submitted to the touch of DOOM!"
“Bisexual,” Bruce muttered after a minute, tiredly. “If you want to know about Hulk you’ll have to ask him yourself.”
Salsa, Clint thought hungrily, getting to his feet. It took a lot of effort and he was distracted by the idea of food. Why had he skipped breakfast?
"We're friends too, right?" Clint tried, holding out his arms wide. "Let's go smash stuff in the training room. Work out some of that rage."
If Wade really was up there with the tent, God help him, because the second Matt wasn’t in sight of any Avengers he’d have full use of his fists and acrobatic skills.
"Easy!" Tony patted his back. Popping the face mask on his armor open at last, he looked at the blonde with obvious worry. "It's my house, I can figure out why the backups aren't working and get 'em doing their jobs in no time. Okay? 'Til then, you can't push it too hard."
“Huh, never thought of that,” Clint told him, grateful that at least a little light made it through the trees.
"Woah!" Wade snickered as they whizzed past the building. "Take it slow, baby—we don't want to end up bug splats. The window cleaners have enough work to do," the cheeky merc said sweetly in his ear.
Pepper stepped out of the cell like getting close to Doom was dangerous; Tony put an arm around her and an arm around Clint—which probably felt pretty cold to the shirtless archer at the moment.
Tony and Bruce were already in a hushed discussion about the readouts on the computer screens, Tony pointing and explaining something. Bruce looked at the readouts worriedly and began to type. What they said may as well have been Greek to Steve—he didn't understand a word of it.
A castle. His own castle. Loki wondered vaguely how Midgard would take it if he moved in and built his own small nation, before he realized that he had been staring up at the demigod the whole time.
He got a little salute from Peter, who zipped off into the nearest cabin. He zipped back out again, glancing back over his shoulder a few times, and then ran into the cabin Tony had the key to instead.
“Does Matt know about Peter’s other life?” He asked, trying to recall if the redhead had said anything about it.
Tilting as he stepped, Wade brushed past Peter and swooped back around the bonfire, stopping by Cap’s side.
Hawkeye had shot one of his light arrows into the roof, giving the whole room a dim eerie light. Steve seemed to be dozing on the other side of the cough, eyes closed. Loki thought he looked so peaceful—until the Hulk's footsteps came closer. The fake archer looked at them, frowning unhappily. He knew he looked tired and pale.
"If Peter's able to trust us, that says a lot to him, I guess," Tony replied softly back. There was no hope of hiding the conversation from Matt, but Peter and Wade probably wouldn't hear.
“Is everything alright up here?” Steve asked, taking his time to come over to where they were standing.
"Deadpool already follows me around everywhere—are people gonna start blaming me for everything he does, too?"
Pushing off of the wall near the cart, the demi-god crossed the street. As soon as they went inside, he’d have an illusion of one of the Avengers come out and give him a kiss in the yard. The most difficult part of the plan was deciding which Avenger would earn him the most attention.
Glancing off at the lake, Loki sighed and propped his chin on his hand, absently tapping his fingers on his chair arm.
"How should you know? You're not even out of your teens," he told his big green alter ego under his breath.
Then it was quiet again. A gentle breeze rustled through the trees, which were beginning to cast long shadows across the camp as it got closer to evening.
How long had the coffee been perking? He hadn’t bothered to time it, but it felt like a long time, so Tony took the pot off of the fire. Smelled like coffee. Success.
"I have a feeling only Doctor Doom can get rid of this. Maybe Tony could..." Steve shook his head, wheezing. "I think it's actually getting worse."
"I'm fine," he mumbled in a Hawkeye-ish way, propping himself up against the couch arm. Moving made him woozy. Keeping this magic up was becoming more irritating by the minute.
Thor skipped another rock absently, sending it even further than the first. Steve was pretty sure he saw the demigod’s shoulders slump with a sigh.
"It's not for dating advice," Bruce said, glancing at him. He frowned and looked back ahead of them again. "At least, I don't think so. That's what I'm trying to figure out. I'm not present as me very often, and you know this team probably the best of anybody, Cap."
“WOW,” Clint managed, baffled both that he had been found out and that Cap managed to use a term like ‘G-rated.’
“Who the hell are you? That magic's familiar, have we kicked your ass before?” The Hawkeye next to Bruce managed hazily, dropping the injured him behind them.
"The Four!" Thor's attention was captured. "Storm was here last night with us. Perhaps that is why he was not taken?"
“…We don’t?” Steve asked, slowly heading his way. He stopped, though, giving Tony space. “We need to work this out. We can’t keep the team together if we’re fighting all the time. I need us to be on the same page and I feel like I’ve dropped the entire book.”
“Good morning. You’re up early. It’s not even eight.” Cap told him brightly, pouring more batter into the iron before he went to get a cup of coffee for his friend and handed it to him.
Tony sighed and started after him. It had been a long drive here, and sitting down would be nice sometime soon. He had a little more energy in him, though. Had to see this through--he'd voted to let Peter stay, so now they had to make sure he had somewhere to actually, well, stay.
"Him and half the team," Tony grumbled, paddling his way to the beach and not so gracefully clambering ashore. He paused to wipe wet hair out of his face, noting the Arc reactor glowing bright and blue right through the chest of his wet shirt. "By the way, Clint says he's dating Bruce now. He actually asked me to tell you, so there you go."
Tony's topaz eyes widened at the look Cap was giving him, and he arched an eyebrow almost indignantly.
"Shouldn't be out there alone since Doom's in a kidnapping mood," Hawkeye cut in quickly, clapping a hand on Steve’s back.
"Steve?" Tony sounded sort of surprised to be hearing him. "Hey, you don't sound so good. Don't worry, I'm on my way back after this last scan."
“I agree, but I never checked on Thor. He took two watches last night. I need to make sure he’s alright first.”
“Oh, that’s alright! We had a nice, long walk.” Jan beamed, leaning up on her tippy toes to kiss Hank’s cheek. The guy blushed a little despite himself.
"I...uh. M-my experience in PR says, the public will probably be surprised somebody from the '40s would DO that," she admitted. "They're gonna talk no matter WHAT Tony does."
"Well, he won't listen to me anymore," Pepper sighed. "He takes you more seriously—I-I'm just the assistant."
“Steve is fine,” Cap told him, handing him a big wrapped blob of ground meat. “You and Peter make meat balls. Clint—” The captain barely snagged the back of Hawkeye’s shirt as he had started to retreat out of the room. “Clint, I need to talk to you.”
"Which brings me back to TV. Pretty mindless stuff." The blond sighed, sending a waft of hot air across Bruce's neck. "Fishing is just...too mindless. If that's a thing."
The tall blond man slid off, standing shakily on his feet. He leaned an arm on Iron Man's shoulder to stay up straight.
"Who am I supposed to go to for help? I doubt we want to bring the Hulk over here." She sighed and shook her head, her hair drifting in the wind around her.
"He-ey, gorgeous! What's a carrot top babe like you doing in a storm like this?" The man said enthusiastically.
He…hadn’t been paying attention to THAT. Did any of the Avengers like each other? He thought, baffled.
There was a kind of mechanical buzzing from the hallway, too. Glancing at the door to the hallway, Hawkeye looked at Bruce and smiled. The day couldn’t get any more weird so he opted to ignore it.
“Wait, wait,” he whispered, trying to make his mouth catch up with his brain. He felt awake, but not well-rested, that was for sure.
"Huh..." Peter tilted his head thoughtfully. The door opened before he could reply, though. Amazingly, it was not some random servant, but Thor himself. The blond man was even more enormous and god-like up close, and towered over both of them.
"They sure pushed us offshore fast," he commented in a carefully casual tone. "Think Peter's sneaky enough to get rid of us so he has time with the other corners of his love triangle?" The kid had been so cheerful and so VERY well-prepared. Tony felt a little bad for being so cynical and suspicious, but he just had a feeling about all of this. Cap had to notice something too, right?
“I don’t care what the newspapers say about us,” Cap said dismissively, half tossing a meat patty onto one of the lined up buns. “They obviously don’t know what they’re talking about, with how they report on Spider-Man as an example.”
“If you had any idea who that was you wouldn’t think so,” Tony called back, nonplussed. Thor seemed troubled, though, either by her comment or just because Loki was around. Probably the latter. “C’mon, let’s go back to our side of the lake, guys.”
"He's the fake!" PJ Clint pointed accusingly, spotting the now bent needle as Tony lifted it up to examine it.
Bruce mumbled something and stuck his hands in his pockets, turning abruptly to walk around behind the bench. Really, he just needed something to do—standing there felt very uncomfortable with Clint's sharp eyes watching him. He circled around the bench before stopping and checking his watch.
He looked around. The room was still pretty dim, so the brightest thing there was the blue glowing reactor in Tony’s chest. It was pretty amazing technology. Steve couldn't help but wonder what the 1940s could have been like with unlimited power. Probably even more explosive.
Glancing back at the kids, Peter opened his mouth to just agree distractedly, but then the words sank in. Eight beds, and how many Avengers? Thor, Jan, Hank, T'challa, Clint, Dr. Banner, Tony, Steve...
"Hm? Yeah, that was the plan." The other man looked at him, running a hand through his hair. "Unless you have something else in mind?"
"Hey, somebody...f-fetch my spare Arc reactor from my room," Tony said, only half-kidding. The current one was just about fried.
Imagining the massive green monster nearby made Loki's stomach flop. It was time to leave this plan to the wolves. He had been injured, kept under close watch, and Doom had clearly changed some part of the plan. Thankfully, now he had the chance to slip away into the darkness while Bruce was distracted.
Half buried in luggage, Steve started back to the cabin, adding to Tony, “Shouldn’t we send him home? I feel like there’s going to be a lot of alcohol this weekend.”
"I don't think that's a good idea," Bruce said cautiously. "If the other guy showed up, he would be more trouble than any trouble we ran into."
"Do you even want me along, or is this just all about the other guy?" He asked flatly, sticking his hands in his pants pockets.
Sandwiches? That was the big draw to sneaking out of the mansion...? Bruce glanced around at the dimly-lit garden and stepped lightly through it like he was trespassing on somebody else's property. The lights of the city glowed in the buildings overhead, and somewhere in the distance, the constant hum of the traffic was almost relaxing.
"What? Not the little flag game, Cap," Tony said in exasperation. "I'm saying maybe Peter's matchmaking Matt and Wade and he's gonna make them team up, leaving himself out. That sounds like something he'd do."
“I’ll bet the bear thing was worse than he admitted to,” he mused aloud. “Maybe he didn’t want you to know or you’d make him camp closer to us. I can kind of see why he’d want to avoid hanging out in camp now.” If Bruce had actually been mauled by a bear, then there was a radioactive gamma energy biohazard patch of forest somewhere up the hill…
“Tony,” Cap sighed, still keeping his voice quiet. “I want to apologize for earlier. I didn’t mean to…hurt your feelings.” Cap added the last very carefully, seemingly unsure of the wording. “You caught me off guard. Arguments and all, we—”
"Very seriously," Thor said grimly, crossing his arms again and nodding. “Both the Captain and Hawkeye had been sighted climbing into a taxi and they have not been since.”
Tony had been determined to just look at the frisbee game and fume in silence, but he couldn't help a sidelong glance at Cap when he heard that. He'd seen many, many documentaries, history books and other articles about Steve's story, and had seen a photo or two of him from before the whole super soldier program.
"Oh no no no." Almost leaping from the couch, his double was at his side in seconds. "You know, I'll call Thor. He can tuck you in."
He wasn't even sure the two of them had ever become a couple, but they were acting a whole lot like one that was on the outs right now. Okay, less dramatic about it than the couples in his high school, but essentially the same 'put on a happy face in public to save your reputation' routine as that.
Cap eyed the window, but remembered that Doom's castle sat on top of a cliff. Jumping out would probably be a really bad idea. He looked back to the door. What was taking Tony so long?
Where would Clint bury the box? Leaning to look over a rock near the beach, Hawkeye frowned. Tequila was never a good idea when you had something to hide.
"Bruce?" He shouted, wiping the rain out of his eyes. The rain was icy and was biting at his skin more now that he was in the shade of the trees.
Tony was sitting there on the floor, leaning back against the wall. His Iron Man armor was in shiny red pieces disassembled all over the floor, and he was wearing just the black suit he normally wore underneath it. More worrisome at the moment was the mess of cords coming out of the wall and going into the Arc reactor on his chest.
“A little time alone sounds fantastic,” he murmured, leaning in to reply to Steve just because it was a nice excuse to get that close to him. They’d had to act strictly professional around the other members of the team for weeks. It was driving him crazy.
“I’m a futurist, but I never wanted to think about my own. Never saw anything good that way—figured I’d better do the good I could right now, before it all went downhill someday. God that sounds depressing!” He laughed sardonically, running a hand through his soaked hair. Was it just him, or was the storm a little quieter now? He was glad Steve could hear what he was saying without having to shout, but maybe it was all in his head. One of those ‘time went slow-mo’ moments like they had in the movies.
Clasping the handle of his bow on his back, Hawkeye carefully considered whether shooting Deadpool would be worth it. It wasn’t like the moron could die from it…
"What, it's some kind of secret now? Man..." Spider-Man groaned, tilting his head to one side to peer up at Deadpool. "Just tell me it's not some creepy blind date situation."
Tony lingered over on the shore, Steve noted, talking with Thor. The Asgardian looked very different in earth clothing, so hopefully nobody at the fancy camp recognized him from the news or something.
Why did Steve get the feeling Doom didn't expect Tony to be able to come up with an Arc reactor very fast?
"If you want to stay, we will," Clint said with renewed determination. There was a sigh in the dark. "Hang in there, buddy." There was a long pause before a loud rumble sounded above them. As the lightning flashed, Bruce could see that Clint was glancing in his direction.
“Cap and Tony were gonna go swimming!” He realized aloud, aghast. Steve could probably punch a monster away from him, but what if it ate Tony? They had to get back and warn the others! Thank god Wade knew a shortcut.
Giving Loki a nervous smile and a little wave, Peter muttered out of the corner of his mouth, “I know that’s Loki!” Clearing his throat loudly, he added to the Jotun, “Good morning! Wow, that smells like some great espresso!”
Bruce glanced up and down the street, very calmly. Lucky for them, the sun was starting to peek over the horizon, keeping the block from being plunged into the dark.
“Do you see my glasses?” He whispered as Cap’s voice drifted over from the Avenger’s campsite. Peter, Wade and Matt had camped out under a giant tree, but it was still in sight of the campfire and tents.
"Thor has demonstrated many times that he will come to aid his friends. This takes Avengers out of the equation as I capture them one by one, weakening them as a whole and giving the advantage to Doom." He paused, staring at Loki intently. "If YOU are here, then where is the true Hawkeye?"
“Like pea soup,” Wade commented from beside him, also shielding his eyes to look out to sea. After a moment, he nodding emphatically. “I can’t see anything.”
So this wasn’t just weird for Clint, then. It was true that these days the Hulk pretty much stayed the Hulk, even when he slept. It made Clint wonder if Bruce could take over while the big green guy was sleeping if he wanted to. Was that how that worked?
"Okay!" Hawkeye suddenly came over and moved Bruce aside, half dragging Loki off the couch. "I'll take you to your room."
"N-no thank you," Cap wheezed, leaning back against the wall. If Doom really wanted to do the awful things that he did to Clint, he'd have to do them on the cold dungeon floor. Who knew? Maybe that was his thing, Steve thought with a cringe.
“Wow, you’re…muddy,” Tony said, looking at him with a frown. “And bleeding. Peter!” The moment he sighted Steve and Peter walking up the hill from the lake, he seemed to completely forget about Clint, hopping up to hurry over to their sides. “You guys are coming from the lake! Tell me you didn’t find out Loki’s here the hard way.”
What if Clint threw the tackle box into the ocean last night? It was solid metal, so it would have sunk like a stone. The blond shaded his eyes and squinted down the beach. The alcove was down that way. If he and Hulk had been over there, maybe the box was just off the shore?
Bruce looked up at him, but said nothing. Whether he believed the excuse or not, Clint seemed to understand that he was trying to put some space between them. What was frustrating was that now Bruce almost wished the blond would come sit beside him again. Or that he'd stayed asleep when he'd dozed off before.
"Yeah...uh, I know it looks bad, but he's just had a lot of people treat him bad because he's...kind of weird...so he's clingy because I'm nice to him." He sighed. Okay, so Wade was also pretty insecure that Peter was going to go find somebody else he liked to spend time with better and dump the blond like a hot potato, but that right there sounded like an abusive relationship, so he wasn't going to bring it up. It wasn't some creepy possessive thing anyway.
...Or maybe that wasn't the cure. The Avenger lay back into the chair. There was no way Doom would risk him escaping. It had to be a trap. He looked around the room again. There wasn't anything he could use to fight with and he sure as heck wasn't up to jumping off a cliff in his current state—another sixty plus years in a block of ice wasn’t appealing.
"More like I take care of him, when I see him," she sighed, catching on. The distress signal device was in her pocket.
“It’s Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers,” Matt added, sounding worried. Abruptly, he rolled away from Peter’s side.
“Good morning!” Thor’s voice echoed across the lake. A glance told Tony that Thor was nearly to the far shore—and making a line straight for the rich campers. He had bigger things to worry about right now.
"No, I just almost fell down a staircase, that's all. Tony..." She turned to him unhappily. "Realistically, how long 'til this arrangement fails and hurts you?"
“Sorry,” Matt said sincerely. “I met Peter at work. I was researching a court case and he helped me find some old newspapers. We got coffee and things went from there.”
There was a heavy 'thunk' down the beach, and then a burst of feminine giggling. Turning back, Peter saw Thor and Jan both helping Hank off of his face on the ground. There was a neon green frisbee clutched in his hand stubbornly, even as he spat out sand.
"I'm fine, I'm good," Tony told the redhead, looking down at the mess of wires he'd hooked up to the power source in his chest. "...Now which one was it again..."
"I-I look...tormented to you? Really?" He was in a pretty serious amount of pain, actually. Still smirking, though.
Cap sighed, slowing his pace to walk beside Tony instead. Lowering his voice, he leaned to whisper down to the billionaire.
