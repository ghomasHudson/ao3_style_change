“I’m sorry,” Cas says.
“Thanks,” Dean says dryly. “Really fills me with confidence.”
Dean opens his mouth to deny it. Closes it again, because he really can’t. “I was in shock. I wanted to.”
“Unless I misinterpreted something?” Castiel looked wary. “In which case, please don’t hit me.”
"That you don't want to date me," Jimmy says. He smiles and Dean would almost buy that it's genuine, but he knows him too well. "I understand."
Then he was pulling away. “Bedroom?”
Dean crosses his arms. He’s not gonna lie, Charlie’s idea isn’t half-bad. If he’s already there, dropping by Cas’ office wouldn’t be
Dean swallowed. “You do?”
Cas has turned bright red. Dean would feel bad about teasing him, if it wasn’t so much fun.
Dean could only nod, watching stupefied as Cas walked away, lips still tingling and mind still spinning.
“We’ve been here thirty-two days,” Cas says, as if that makes any kind of sense. Dean wracks his brain but nope, all he can remember is arriving in town late last night and heading straight for the motel.
“It’s cool,” Dean said, eager to move past that. Even though they’d never been all that attracted to each other, rejection still stung. “I’m, uh, here about Cas. I figured you probably deserved to hear this from me before you heard it somewhere else.”
is unusually busy – there’s two people sitting by the windows, chatting over their coffee, and for once there’s a line, albeit consisting of just one person. Dean waits, nodding at Cas when he waves at him from behind the counter. Steve is working tonight as well and he’s the one to take Dean’s order while Cas makes the coffees.
Dean smirked. He could feel Cas pressing between his ass cheeks and he couldn’t resist grinding down a little, feeling the head of Cas’ cock catching on his rim. “Get the condom on, cowboy.”
“Maybe you could show it to me sometime?” he asks before he can stop himself. At Cas’ obvious reluctance, he adds, “I’ll show you mine if you show me yours?”
“You’re losing me here,” he admits.
Dean pays for his coffee then goes to wait by the counter to pick up his order. He’s currently the only customer, not surprising considering it’s five AM. For once, Dean’s fucked up sleeping schedule is working in his favor.
“Relax,” Cas muttered, leaning down to kiss Dean again.
Finding Castiel proved to be easy. Aside from Dean being connected to him on Facebook through Daphne, it wasn’t exactly the most common name. No one had apparently taught Castiel about online safety, because his page was set to public (
And his twenty-one year old dick, front and center.
The second day, Cas spends out back tending to his garden while Dean almost dials Sam’s number repeatedly before hanging up, torn between wanting to let his brother know that he’s getting married and not wanting to jinx it.
Cas smiles but doesn’t respond. “What do you write?”
“Oh!” Okay, Jamie had definitely not known Dean well enough to be so surprised by that. Or had his aura of perpetual bachelorhood been that visible? “Well, if you’re ever single and passing through Canonsburg again, look me up.”
“Was that all you told him?” At Dean’s incredulous look, Cas gives him a patient smile. “I’ve found that humans sometimes need these kinds of things spelled out for them. They tend to assume the worst, otherwise.”
. Cas could laugh at him and call him ridiculous all he liked, Dean was too overwhelmed with relief to care. He’d kept this huge, ridiculous, utterly stupid secret for their entire relationship and it getting out hadn’t broken them.
Novak takes the master suite and Dean moves into the guestroom. Even that is fancier than anything Dean is used to and not for the first time, he wonders why the Novak clan agreed to this deal.
fucked things up yet.
Dean moaned around Cas’ fingers and Cas finally pulled them free. He reached between their legs, hand brushing against Dean’s still working over his cock, and pressed one wet fingertip against Dean’s hole.
“That’s great!” As expected, she didn’t sound surprised. “What’s her name?”
“I was just asking a question,” Cas says, annoyed. “There’s no need to bite my head off.”
“She said your name, yeah.” Dean ducked his head. His cheeks were already warm with embarrassment over what he was about to say. “So my ego was kind of bruised and for some reason I decided the best thing to do was to look you up and… I don’t know, prove to myself somehow that you weren’t better than me.”
“Not your fault.”
He’s in his kitchen, putting away all the dirty dishes from Emma’s party. The birthday girl herself is taking a nap and although most of the guests have gone home, a few still linger in the living room, talking quietly among themselves.
Cas smiled at him. It was soft, almost tender, and something inside Dean’s chest clenched. “Do you want to stay the night?”
Dean frowned, but before he could answer Cas cleared his throat from the kitchen doorway. “Hello. Sam and Eileen, isn’t it?”
"We burned its bones," Dean informs Jimmy, since it doesn't look like Cas is gonna get around to it. "It's gone to... wherever evil spirits go."
Dean doesn’t move. After a couple of beats, Jack sighs.
It works, a little. Cas’ posture loosens and he glances at Dean, smiling half-heartedly. “I suppose not. What about you?”
They part and Castiel is staring at him with something like wonder in his eyes. Dean feels filthy under that look. Castiel’s been waiting for his soulmate for god knows how long, saving himself for them, and then the poor bastard gets stuck with
Awareness hits like a ton of bricks, Dean’s body landing hard against cold concrete and a warm weight on top of him, pinning him down. He moans in pain, blindly reaching until he gets his hands under him, and can raise his upper body from the ground. He blinks his eyes open, unable at first to take in his surroundings.
Dean would have confronted him by now, if he weren’t such a coward.
Okay, so Dean probably should have cancelled this date. He’d planned on it, and on avoiding Cas until he got his head on straight (so to speak). But even thinking about it had made his stupid heart ache and he hadn’t found it in him to pick up the phone and call Cas before he came over.
Castiel regards him coolly.
Dean peers at him. “Huh?”
Huge thanks as always to avyssoseleison!
Castiel just looks at him. There’s a look in his eyes that might be relief. Dean ignores it and goes back to shoving forkfuls of bacon into his mouth.
“Not officially,” Crowley says. “But it was Adler, obviously. The bloody bastard even bragged about it to my face, though he knew better than to say anything outright incriminating.”
. It’s far later in the morning than he’s usually there and there are a couple of customers inside, the very beginnings of the morning rush, but Cas is still behind the counter, along with another android, probably just about to finish up his shift.
“Too kinky, Cas.”
“I just get what it’s like now,” he finishes. His voice has gone hoarse. He doesn’t want to be here anymore but he doesn’t know how to leave without making Cas feel even worse about the whole shitty situation.
"In case the ghost shows up," he explains as he hands the crowbar to Dean. "We need to be able to protect ourselves."
Falling in love again had not been part of his plan, least of all with a man. So Dean did what he’d always done. He compartmentalized. He put it in a box labeled ‘Do not open, under any circumstance, unless you wanna royally fuck everything up again’ and shoved it way into the back of his mind.
“You told him, huh?” Balthazar tilts his head, picking up one of the photos and it’s only then that Castiel realizes they are back on his desk. “And he just… left them with you?”
But Cas doesn’t hand him the book. He turns to face Dean, holding it in both hands, thumb running nervously against its spine.
“Agents Singer and Kripke, mind if we take a look?”
After an hour, he gives up and goes to the kitchen to prepare something that Castiel can scarf down in between self-abuse sessions. He grabs a couple of water bottles as well and waits until he hears the noises in Castiel’s bedroom die down to knock.
He goes to lower his hand. Dean’s heart jumps and before he can make a decision about it, he’s grabbing Cas’ hand in his, holding it in place.
Dazed, he climbed off Cas’ lap. Cas didn’t seem to notice his shock, busy getting off the condom. He tied it up and threw it on the floor, kissing Dean’s slack lips before getting up. Dean wordlessly watched him leave, still trying to understand just what the hell had happened when Cas returned with a damp towelette and wiped them both clean.
Reaching into his pocket, Dean pulled out a quarter. He turned it over between his fingers, then tossed it decisively, catching it in his closed palm. Heads he’d go, tails he wouldn’t.
Cas doesn’t respond, shucking the apron off and leaving it in a heap on the counter. Dean watches, heart hammering in his chest, as Cas opens the gate between them and steps through. It’s strange, having his view of Cas be completely unobstructed.
He brushed his hair and washed his face quickly, inspecting his neck for any hickeys (none, of course, because he wasn’t the kind of idiot who would let his boyfriend do that right before a big family dinner).
Except he kind of was. What else would you call someone who cyber-stalked their ex's ex just to seduce them and prove they're better than them?
Finally, Dean found what he was looking for, and he pulled his hand back, thrusting the lube and condoms at Cas’ chest. Cas accepted them, with the unfortunate side-effect that his hands were nowhere near Dean’s junk anymore. But that also meant that Dean’s head cleared, and he realized that he needed to step up his game.
But then, he knows Cas isn’t gonna judge him. It makes it a little easier. “Dad didn’t want him to go. They got into a huge fight and when it got down to it, I basically had to pick a side. I guess I picked wrong.”
So it's been..... a while. And this fic isn't done with this chapter, surprise! 😅 But it's getting there finally and the next chapter, which I am working on, will actually be the last.
Jimmy nods thoughtfully. "It tried to leave here. I felt it was about to leave and I," he pauses, looking confused, "I don't know what I did, but I didn't want it to hurt anyone else."
“Hey, what’s better than a memorial where you can memorialize to the guy in person?” Dean quips.
Dean swallowed, feeling a little stupid for how much it affected him when he said, “What if he breaks up with me?”
Then he’s gripping Castiel’s shirt and pulling him inside, shoving the door shut behind him.
About three weeks later, Dean finally manages to corner Cas in the library late one night.
Without breaking eye-contact with Dean, Cas reaches behind him and loosens his apron strings. “I quit.”
They skip the honeymoon, moving into a penthouse apartment in Chicago the next morning, courtesy of the Novak clan. It’s sparsely decorated but there’s a giant television in the living room and the view is spectacular.
Meanwhile, Cas reached between his legs with his free hand, teasing his perineurium, one dry fingertip rubbing over Dean’s hole.  This wasn’t unfamiliar territory to Dean, who’d had some adventurous girlfriends in the past, but the thought of what was coming next made it feel completely new. He couldn’t help grinding down into the sensation, and he couldn’t even feel ashamed about it when it made Cas grin against his neck.
Great, now Dean was the one who was blushing.
“Please, ah-” Dean swallowed, hardly believing what he was about to say, feeling both humiliated by it and turned on beyond belief. “
It wasn't locked but it was still occupied; when Dean wrenched the door open he was greeted by the sight of Charlie, sitting on the counter by the sink and making out with a very enthusiastic Meg. They broke apart when he burst in, Charlie's eyes widening in realization as she saw him.
“That’s the thing,” Daphne sighed. “It’s not even working as a rebound. I can’t stop thinking about Castiel.”
Dean rolled his eyes, stepping aside and letting them in. “Hardy-freaking-har.”
“That happened, huh?”
“He is,” Castiel agrees. “But that does sound like him. I’m sure he’s an equally awful customer.”
Next to him, Cas started to stir. He let out a long huff, then pulled himself closer to Dean, burying his nose in the crook of his neck. Weirdly enough, Dean didn’t feel the impulse to push him away. This whole morning felt strange, almost unreal. Dean was half-expecting to actually wake up any second.
“Yes,” Cas says, looking at him for the first time since he entered. “You did. Multiple times.”
“Then I realized how ridiculous you were.”
“Crowley?” Dean repeats incredulously. “
Dean glances at Cas. He's poking disinterestedly at his food, but he raises his head in a slight nod to acknowledge Meg. He looks calm, put-together, but underneath the table his hand is clinging to Dean's like a lifeline. Occasionally, his tongue darts out of his mouth to worry at the scab still present on his lower lip.
Cas shook his head. “Thank you, but I only live a couple of blocks away. Besides, I could use the exercise.”
He tries to sit up further and Cas takes the hint to help him but between the efforts of two drunk, uncoordinated people, Dean somehow finds himself slipping off the couch, landing halfway on top of Cas and halfway on the floor.
Dean looks up. Cas is watching him anxiously, clutching one hand in the other and clearly preparing himself for the worst.
"Not that I'm not happy to see you," Cas says, "but what are you doing here?"
But to be sure he could pull it off, he’d need an accomplice.
with him now?”
“Very funny,” Dean says dryly. He rubs his eyes, already feeling dread pooling in his gut. This shouldn’t be this hard. “I, uh. I think I need some help.”
But when they part and Dean pulls himself out of Castiel’s embrace, Castiel lets him. Dean wants to apologize, either for the kiss or for turning Castiel away, but he can’t decide which so he doesn’t.
The alarms ring louder. Dean is not leaving the safety of this bar with this creep following him. “I can take care of myself.”
Then it dwindles and reality hits Dean like a blast of cold water.
They watched the two women leave, Lily pulling the door open for Daphne and guiding her out with a hand on the small of her back while Daphne smiled at her like she was the only person in the room.
Cas frowned thoughtfully but Dean didn’t feel like waiting for him to come up with a complicated and nuanced point system. He hooked his lower leg over Cas’, using the leverage to roll them around, remembering a moment too late that they were lying on a narrow couch.
“I’m sorry.” To her credit, Charlie looked it. “I’m just not sure what you expect me to say. You’re the only person I know who could fall ass backwards into a loving relationship with the man of your dreams.”
like you,” he hastily added. “And I wanna keep seeing you. I’m just not sure-”
"Yeah."
He heads to the garage instead. It’s stupid, with how much he missed his home and his room and his memory foam mattress, but right now Dean’s craving the comfort of Baby’s back seat.
No alarms start ringing when he jimmies open the lock on the backdoor, and they sneak inside. The dark hallway stretches out in front of them, their footsteps echoing eerily as they walk down it. The cafeteria is at the opposite end of the school but as they pass the library, Dean catches something moving through the window on the door.
The words tumble out faster than Dean can stop them. His mouth goes dry when Cas turns to look at him, eyes wide with shock, but there’s a reckless pounding in his heart that makes him push past the doubt.
And Dean wanted to argue. He had about fifty reasons why Charlie was wrong, but as soon as he tried to voice one it seemed weak or non-existent and died on his tongue
Del Martin-”
and Cas can obviously spot it from a mile away. He doesn’t say anything, though, and Dean manages not to be a rude piece of shit this time as he orders his coffee.
(See the end of the chapter for
Jack turns to him. Smiles apologetically. “I think you know.”
Dean picked up the phone on Thursday afternoon, punching in Mom’s number and making the call before he could second-guess himself. Introducing Cas to his family was just the next logical step, and it had to happen sooner or later.
It was rare for Dean to go out without Cas these days but sometimes a guy just needed a solitary drink and burger at the Roadhouse.
"Dean?"
“He doesn’t like to admit when you’ve surprised him,” Cas agrees.
And Dean had his pride, but at this moment he couldn’t scrape it together if he tried. “Please, Cas-
At least Cas had come faster this time around. Did that mean Dean had accomplished his goal? What even
“I suppose I am,” Cas agrees.
Dean was still pondering this when Cas leaned in and kissed him on the lips, oddly sweet considering what they‘d just been up to.
Dean took a deep swig of his third beer, glancing around the Roadhouse once more. When he’d come here an hour ago, Castiel had already been sitting in a corner booth opposite two women, one of which had to be Meg. Dean had taken a seat at the bar where he could see them, then proceeded to spend the next hour watching them as sneakily as he could.
“I don’t mean to sound too forward,” he started, and
It might be Dean’s imagination but Cas sounds pleased at that.
Dean swallowed his bite, looking up. It took him a second to place the pretty blonde in front of him. “Jamie?”
“I think we’ve been found,” he says.
Cas glances at the girl, who nods once and retreats into the backroom.
Despite himself, Dean snorts. “If you wanna be blunt about it, then yeah, that is one of the bigger issues.”
And that was going to go inside him.
Dean isn’t sure what to make of it, but it’s something.
Still, Sam knows better than to get attached. It's only a matter of time before they're on the road again.
Right.
Castiel doesn’t answer.
“You saved me,” Cas breathes.
He’s not being loud but the words echo around the shop anyway, causing everyone to fall silent. Dean is all too aware that the other customers are now looking at him and even Steve has stopped to stare but he doesn’t care about any of them. Doesn’t care about anything but Cas and the visible hurt he’s radiating.
Well, at least it’s someone Castiel already knows hates him. “Is there anything we need to do now?”
They finish their beers, moving onto their second bottles and inconsequential small talk before someone finally works up the nerve to mention the elephant in the room.
“How do you want me?” Dean asked as they finally parted for air, not even realizing the way it sounded until he’d said it.
“You didn’t do anything wrong,” Cas tells him. “I was the one - I violated you. I knew you wouldn’t have done that in your right mind but I let you anyway because I wanted to believe-” He cuts himself off, looking angry. “There’s no excuse.”
Castiel stops short, vivid images popping into his mind without permission. He forcibly banishes them. “
"He's not meant to be here. It's hurting him. If you loved him, you'd understand that."
“Yeah.” Dean shifts on his feet. This feels like a bad idea but it’s too late to turn back now. “I’m going to California. To see Sam.”
“You remembered,” Jamie said with a smile. “It’s been a while.”
Slowly, Cas started pressing inside. It was somehow just as overwhelming as the first time, his dick feeling huge and unyielding compared to his fingers. He didn’t go all the way inside yet, pumping with small movements, pushing his dick only half-way inside before pulling it back out again almost completely, head popping past Dean's rim and inside him again. It was an unbearable tease. Dean tried to push back, get him deeper, but Cas kept a vice grip on his hips, keeping him right where he wanted him.
"No," he says. "Go ahead."
Their actual start to the day is around ten AM, when Cas finally gets up for his jog and Dean gets up for his cereal and a scroll through the morning news. He’s on the look for hunts, mostly out of habit since there’s been very little monster activity since Chuck went and fucked off for good. He doesn’t find anything this morning but that’s hardly a surprise. It’s been a couple of weeks since they’ve been out on a hunt and that inactivity, weirdly enough, is starting to bother him less and less.
“Castiel Milton,” Cas clarified.
There’s no answer. Then the doors are being yanked open and Dean stumbles inside, right into Castiel’s arms. He flails but Castiel catches him with ease, pulling him back up by his shoulders and tugging him in for a searing kiss.
“Would it be really insensitive of me to say ‘duh’?”
Straight to the point. Dean admired that about her. Under other circumstances, he might have taken her up on her offer. “I’m kinda seeing somebody.”
Dean had to take it back. He couldn’t disappoint Cas like that just to cover his own ass. He couldn't be that selfish.
“Didn’t mean to drag you into it.”
Dean’s fingers tighten their hold on the card. He should just rip it into pieces, be done with this mess once and for all. Castiel will be hurt but he’ll move on. It will be better for both of them in the long run.
"I thought my peers were the ones who were supposed to do the pressuring."
Charlie rolls her eyes. “Yes, imagine that. Healthy communication instead of bottling up my feelings until I explode!”
“You saved me,” Cas repeats. He raises his hand, balance fumbling a little as he does so - they’re both like newborn deer,
"I've been looking for ways to help him," Cas says.
Jimmy clearly doesn't buy it, but he drops the topic. They spend the rest of lunch break in awkward silence.
Dean didn't have the patience for this. "
Dean snorts. “Fair enough.” He brightens. “But hey, since you’re here, we’ll be having a Halloween party this Saturday at Rocky’s. We’re not going all out or anything but there’ll be a DJ, a couple of drag queens putting on a show - Charlie hired them, she says they’re good but that’s more her thing than mine - and beer’s half off. Oh, and there’s a prize for the best costume.”
Dean’s stomach dropped.
Even so, there are kids out there in danger and time is running out on getting them out unscathed.
“I do,” he admits. “I enjoy it very much. I’ve even tried to write some myself.”
As he approached her, Mom indicated for him to sit down next to her. Once he did, she reached out and took both of his hands in hers. His heart tightened, hands limp in her tight, slightly damp grasp. Looked like he wasn’t the only one nervous.
Dean winces. Okay, so he deserves the cold shoulder but it still doesn’t feel good.
“I love you,” he finally manages, voice hoarse. “I do, Cas, fuck, you have to know I-”
“Okay, no need to rub it in.”
“Hey, Cas.”
And it’s coming
“Sometimes, then. It depends on the customer.”
Dean raises an eyebrow. “No?”
Dean swallowed. He could tell from her voice that she thought she had it figured out. And she almost did. “Kinda. I, uh, met someone.”
“Yeah, that was a full-on fanboy crush,” Sam agreed with a snicker.
“Could I,” Cas turned even redder, “Could I fuck you?”
of him. Before he can spend too long chastising himself, Cas lays a hand over his on the table.
doing here?"
Things with Cas were simple. And then, suddenly, they weren’t.
Cas’ answer is quick and the fervor of it catches Dean off guard. He’s looking at Dean now, holding his gaze despite the redness still staining his cheeks, and Dean finds his heart beating faster at the intensity of it.
He tilts his head, eyes resting on the post-coital photo. “You know, I looked pretty good.”
Those words stung. Dean reached out instinctively for Cas’ hand, stopping himself half-way. He was about to draw his hand back when Cas grabbed it, squeezing it firmly.
“Sorry.” Daphne rubbed her temple. “This is a lot to take in.” She dropped her hand, narrowing her eyes at Dean. “Does Castiel know about this?”
Cas smiled, expression unbearably soft, leaning his butt against the table and wrapping both hands around Dean’s lower back. “I liked them.”
, Cas thinking this was a date was a
It’s fine at first. Dean finds a bar not too far away from the apartment that’s tidy and tastefully decorated. He buys himself a beer and sits at a table in the corner. He’s only been there for ten minutes when a man approaches him; tall, handsome, and obviously alpha judging by the faint whiff Dean catches from him.
“Fuck off,” Dean says but he’s laughing, giddy and for no real reason. He’s drunk and there’s some girl on the radio singing about being in love and Cas is right here, human but alive, smiling at the sound of Dean’s laughter and leaning in and, oh -
, “but I noticed you looking our way.”
“The douchey one?” Meg’s eyebrows rise and she glances back. “Huh. You never told me he was hot. You ever think of just banging it out with him?”
The moment she brings up Sam, he slams the door in her face.
Dean stares at the table. If he could, he’s sure he would’ve burnt a hole into it by now. Nothing Sam is saying is surprising, exactly, but it still hurts to hear. It’s something that’s been stirring in Dean’s head, a thought he hasn’t allowed himself to think.
“Well, tough titties,” Dean mutters, looking around. With no way of knowing where Cas might be, he picks a direction at random.
Why the hell the word ‘husband’ sounded so good when applied to Cas.
“No!” Dean blurted, before he could think twice. Both Cas and the waitress looked at him, eyebrows raised, and he could feel himself blushing under their attention. “I mean, it’s okay. I like cake, too.”
The omelet is burnt. Dean eats it anyway, and by the time he's finished he still doesn’t know how he should be feeling. He’ll need to talk to Cas about it.
Cas’ expression dims. He’s still smiling but it’s sad now, resigned. “Yes, I know.”
“Fuck the Redskins,” Mom agreed solemnly.
“Loser is whoever comes first,” he suggested.
Charlie waves her hand. “Nah, I don’t think so. Maybe just a touch stalker-ish.”
“Fuck,” Dean breathed.
“If it were up to her, we’d never leave. We can’t give in every time she starts crying, she’ll stop as soon as she sees something else she likes.”
“Dean-”
“Yeah,” Sam said, hesitantly grabbing Cas’ hand. “And you’re Cas.”
“Right.” Daphne raised one hand in an awkward little wave. “It was nice seeing you.”
Whatever. Cas is nice, is the point. Not for the first time, Sam is kind of dreading having to leave Milliken.
Which might be why he’s currently letting Cas paint his toenails, with some polish Charlie left behind after her last visit.
Sam looks up from his book to glare at his brother, but surprisingly enough, it's Cas who speaks up.
“It’s not that easy,” Dean says defensively. “He seems interested sometimes but then as soon as I get closer, he shuts down. I haven’t gotten signals that mixed since Heather Scott in middle school.”
Cas doesn't even know he's coming. Dean somehow got it in his head that showing up unannounced would be a nice surprise, but during these last twenty miles he's been growing increasingly doubtful. What if Cas doesn't want to see him?
He knocked.
Cas turns away, blushing. “Possibly. It’s not as if I’ve had much practice.”
know?" he asks. "Is Jimmy even aware that he's..."
“A mix of both?” Dean joked.
If Sam has an answer, it’s lost in his sobs. Dean closes his eyes, leans into it as Sam pulls him into his arms. If this is how he’s gonna go, at least - at least he wasn’t alone.
“Unpleasant?” Dean repeats. He gets up on his elbows, sparing a glance at his toes - a whole mess of blue, Picasso would be so proud - before looking back at Cas. “Dude. You sure you weren’t just bad at it?”
Cas smirks at him. "Not just a pretty face, are you?"
“Cas did,” Dean says, slinging an arm around his husband’s -
He’s never been so helpless before. The Mark was in the ballpark but even that is nothing compared to giving his body entirely over to someone else. The closest Dean’s ever felt to this complete loss of control was in hell, when Alastair’s hand guided his knife. But that’s mostly because it made it easier, pretending that it wasn’t really him doing it.
“I won’t be working,” Dean adds. “I mean, I’ll probably get behind the bar a couple of times because I can’t help myself but it’ll technically be my night off. Pam and Charlie insisted.”
ten inch pole?”
Dean nodded, a little dazed. “Yeah.” He licked his lips, chasing the lingering taste of Cas’ chapstick. “Let’s just focus on dinner.”
“Gotcha.”
Sam’s hands are slipping away and Dean lets out a pained, “
“Wait.” Dean crosses his arms. There’s something tickling at him, some realization just out of reach. “You said- why would Cain’s stuff even be relevant to you?”
“Hah,” Dean huffed, resting his head against the floor. “I told ya.”
“But it used to be.”
Dean swallowed. His own dick throbbed, nowhere near satisfied yet.
touching him. Not that Dean really minds the attention, especially not when Cas’ rut hormones kick off his own heat a week later and they spend another three amazing days in bed.
, crouched down beside him and face inches away.
Dean blinks. He looks over at Sam, who seems as surprised as he feels. “Wait, what? You found a case here? We’ve been in town for like ten hours!”
Dean was about to protest, but then Cas was pulling down his underwear, leaving him completely exposed. His mouth went dry when Cas took off his own underwear, revealing an impressive erection. His dick was easily as big as Dean’s, curved but thick and leaking already.
“He knows I do. I called him after Dad died, told him he should come down for the funeral.”
"...Stanford," Dean admits.
Dean got up on his elbows, struck with the terrible possibility that Cas had changed his mind and that his whole plan was about to go out the window. “Just ask.”
) than Cas puts his hand on the back of Dean's neck and pulls him in. At first Sam is sure they're gonna kiss, but no, there's smoke passing from Cas' mouth and into Dean's. They're shotgunning.
Dean shrugs. "Just passing through, thought I'd drop by."
"It's not a spot anyone wants," Jimmy reminds him.
her?”
“Then he’s clearly not the man you thought he was.”
“We’ll find something tomorrow,” Sam says, and it’s less convincing than it was the day before, than the day before, than the day before.
,” Cas gasped, and then he was coming too, cock twitching inside Dean.
Dean gets his coffee to go and ignores the pang of disappointment.
He watches as Cas lets him do it all, even knowing that he’s under a spell. He stops after one kiss this time, knocking Dean out with a finger to his forehead and placing him gently down on the bed.
By the tone of Sam’s voice, Dean can already tell it has nothing to do with Cas or the Empty. He doesn’t sound nearly excited enough.
To Cas’ credit, he managed to keep a straight expression. “Oh. I see.”
“Yeah, so you wouldn’t think I was a complete moron!”
"Okay," Dean says. "Thanks. Can I go now?"
She's playing with her hair again. It looks really soft. "So, my parents are out of town this weekend. I'm inviting a few people over Friday night and I was wondering if you wanted to come?"
Sam didn’t answer. A long moment passed, and Dean braced himself, knowing what came next. Then, “Is this about Lisa?”
Fortunately, he wakes up just a few minutes later. He’s lying in the wet grass outside the mausoleum, a pillar of smoke rising from its doors, and Cas has him propped up in his lap, hands gently cradling his face.
Had his whole life up until this point been a lie?
Dean stays at the library after school, mostly out of a lingering sense of guilt. He tries to work on his essay, but it becomes apparent after a while that he's not going to get any work done. There's something about this place that makes him unable to focus. He keeps seeing movement in the corner of his eye, but when he looks there's nothing there.
“Just-” his voice cracks. He clears his throat, tries again. “Gimme one week before we talk about this. Just one more week.”
So he says nothing, and things stay the same.
He ignores the flutter of hope in his chest. That way only lies danger.
Dean for his part was trying to catch his breath, hardly believing what had just happened. He’d come first. Cas had
They parted, both pretending not to see as the other wiped their eyes.
It’s probably an android thing. Then again, Dean could be getting just that predictable.
That’s over a decade. Castiel can’t imagine the pain of losing someone after such a long relationship but he’s certain it takes more than a handful of months to recover from.
“Well, I wouldn’t have been able to do it without a willing human soul. And you are the only human willing to enter the Empty, knowing the dangers.”
"Me too," Dean mumbles. "About you, I mean."
“And you couldn’t have sent me a message then?”
It's been a week since Jimmy... left. Cas began to join Dean in the cafeteria during lunch two days ago, though always sitting next to him rather than opposite him. Meg, however, has no qualms about being in Jimmy’s old spot.
In the end, such drastic measures don’t prove necessary. Castiel spends five long hours with Crowley and by the end of it, he’s not quite back on track but he’s getting there.
"I wasn't gonna say anything."
They dig in together, discuss their plans for the day, which inevitably involve a few hours in the Men of Letters' library. Sometimes, they’ll hit the road for a hunt or to follow up on a clue, but most of their time and energy goes towards research. Three weeks in, Dean can tell that Sam and Eileen are getting tired of it, but neither one of them complains and he doesn’t bring it up. Quitting now is not an option.
Jimmy smiles.
“Good thing you’re not a barbarian then.” Dean smirks. “Except in bed, maybe.”
“You did good, kid,” Dean mutters. “Better than any of us could’ve hoped for.”
Dean glares at Cas, who’s in the seat next to him. He’s been taking the bus with them ever since Dean brought Emma home, and although Dean is grateful for the company that doesn’t mean he’s gonna put up with unsolicited criticisms.
It’s probably not a good idea but Dean is so sick of being alone.
Cas clears his throat. "I should probably not be hearing this."
“Goodbye, Cas.”
Warmth rises to Dean’s cheeks. He can guess the subject of Cas’ poem easily enough – just how many green-eyed customers is he likely to have developed a personal relationship with? – but he can’t work out what it means. Is Cas aware of the fact that humans consider poetry to be romantic? Did he mean it to come off that way?
Closing his eyes, Dean grinned to himself as Cas gathered him in his arms. Come morning, this sucker wouldn’t know what hit him.
Dean scoffs. “C’mon, even you can’t be that much of a robot. You realize I’m alone here, right? Everyone I know lives in another city and I haven’t had the chance to go out and meet new people yet. You won’t even touch me, much less talk to me.”
There wasn’t much talking after that. Cas made quick work of fingering him this time around, like he couldn’t wait to get his dick inside Dean, and as much as Dean liked to take his time with foreplay there was also something extremely hot about Cas being so eager to fuck him he couldn't be bothered with more than the most rudimentary preparation.
Dean’s sure he’s regretting it right now but Sam made his bed, he can lie in it.
The omega’s scent has grown stronger, permeating Castiel’s apartment, and the frustration has grown into terrible distress. Castiel is out of bed before he realizes he’s moving, walking through his apartment in quick strides. Being unable to properly satisfy an omega is one thing but allowing them to go unfulfilled to the point of pain is dangerous. Even with the low, low expectations Castiel has for Dean this is beyond the pale.
Dean turns to the teacher, attention caught by that word. “What?”
His legs bumped against the mattress and then he was going down, Cas on top of him, straddling him in one smooth movement.
Miss Milton makes him stay after class. "I'm worried about you, Dean."
“We are,” Cas said. “Afraid you’ll lose?”
“I just…” Charlie sighs, bending down and beginning to pick up the bottles two by two. “You were right, okay? I always end up pining after her when she leaves and then when she comes back, I convince myself that it wasn’t so bad or that it’ll be different this time and it never is. So I told Dorothy all of that-”
“Lily,” the other woman introduced herself, holding her hand out to Cas and Dean in turn. “I’m Daphne’s girlfriend.”
It being early morning – still night, really – means that Dean is once again the only customer in the shop. There’s also just one android behind the counter this time and unfortunately, it’s just the one Dean didn’t want to see.
His head swims as he straightens but Cas’ hand is at his back, keeping him steady. Sitting up has the unfortunate side-effect of bringing them even closer, making it difficult for Dean to think clearly. He could practically count Cas’ eyelashes from this distance.
“Dean, what is it? You asked me to meet you here, but-”
Charlie snuck a sip of his beer, giving an apologetic shrug. “I’m sorry, Dean, but it kinda looks like you are.”
“I…” Cas pulled away, cheeks flushing, suddenly looking almost coy. “I’m not sure how to ask…”
Dean looks away, fighting the urge to squirm. Great, so that’s two people in this room who have seen him naked.
Dean shook his head. “He’d have every right. And I can’t lose him. Not like that.”
He walked into the room, holding his hand out for the two of them to shake. Sam and Eileen both looked a little perplexed by his stiff mannerisms, and Dean could hardly keep the fond smile off his lips. God, his boyfriend was such a dork.
someone in the comments asked me to write a sequel and good news! i already wrote two sequel drabbles years ago. i hunted them down in my documents and it turns out, i wrote them in 2014 which means this fic is way older than i thought lmao
“We’re friends?”
“Alright.” Cas’ voice was coarse, heated, and it sent an unexpected bolt of lust down to Dean’s gut. “Okay. Good.”
“I think I’d be angrier with you if you hadn’t been lying to him about something so ridiculous,” she finally said. “But you did still lie to him. Castiel deserves better.”
“Still, would be nice to actually sit down and eat.”
Cas is still staring wordlessly at him. The urge to look away or to turn tail and flee is strong but Dean resists it. He got to say his piece, now it’s Cas’ turn.
“You know him?”
Dean’s first thought was that there was no way of confusing Cas with a woman. The second was that it didn’t really matter, because Cas was a
They worked in relative silence, the only sounds the quiet tones of golden oldies from the radio, the chopping of Cas’ knife and the sizzling of the beef cubes on the pan. Dean grabbed himself a bottle of beer, hoping to calm his nerves some.
“You want an omelet?” Dean asks. “I was making this one for myself, but I’ve still got all the ingredients out so I don’t mind...”
“Come
“I won’t,” Cas said with a soft smile, “but you can’t deny that’s what it is.”
“Definitely didn’t see that coming,” he said with a slight laugh, and Dean felt the knots in his stomach ease at the relaxed tone in his voice. Not that he’d really expected Sam to take it badly.
“Wait, is that why Daphne hated me?”
Whatever had knocked loose in Dean’s chest went even crazier at the sound of that. Which,
The bookstore Dean works at is tiny and cramped and filled with books. Not in the usual bookstore way; every shelf is crammed full and there are stacks of books just sitting on the floor, some of them reaching all the way to the ceiling. It's dark, too, since the big front window is nearly entirely eclipsed by books, and there's a heavy, pungent smell in the air. Sam doesn't know how Dean can stand to work in a place like this.
“But they are.”
He climbs into the backseat and Cas wordlessly scoots over to accommodate him. For once, he’s not looking at Dean, instead staring straight ahead, shoulders ramrod straight.
Ever since Dean came out to Sam as bisexual in his late twenties, extremely drunk and on accident, his brother’s been pushing him to share more about that part of his life. Dean’s been kind of reluctant to, feeling weird talking to Sam about something he hid from him so long, but the less he’s said, the more insistent Sam has been that he can be himself around him and that he’s not gonna judge.
feeling a twinge of lust at it, my
They go through their morning routine and both are up and dressed by the time Cas shows up, looking a little grumpy but otherwise fine.
Yeah, it's been a good night, even if it did get cut pretty short. Sam hasn't had more than one beer and half a cup of punch, but he feels light-headed and giddy as he walks home.
Jimmy is already in the cafeteria by the time Dean gets there, as usual. He's offered many times to wait by his classroom until Dean gets there so they can walk together, but Dean's always turned him down on the grounds that somebody needs to save their spot.
Castiel watches with a frown as the door closes behind Dean. While he is undeniably disappointed to see him leave so soon, there’s a part of him that is relieved as well. Their discussion today has revealed some new pieces to slot into his image of Dean and the picture they’re forming is unexpected.
Okay. Dean had to stop stalling. He stared down at Cas’ dick, now fully hard and leaking, and felt a twitch in his own that was surely just coincidental. He glanced up, but Cas wasn’t looking his way, head thrown back on his pillow.
He positions himself, grasping his dick and guiding it into Dean’s hole. It seems to suck him inside, wet and warm and yet impossibly tight. Castiel can’t help himself, he slams his cock the rest of the way inside and relishes the deep, guttural moan Dean releases.
“It went on for a while before I figured out what had happened,” he explains.
. Dean brings him food several times and Castiel looks more haggard each time, the bags underneath his eyes growing and his skin turning paler.
Suddenly, another Dean enters as well. The other Cas turns to him.
“Is there any reason-” Dean wheezes. “What the fuck, Cas? Is this your idea of a proposal?”
It’s been two weeks since Dean last visited
“You sure they didn’t program you to be a bartender?”
Castiel covers his nose and forces himself to keep going, to leave that delicious scent behind. It’s not until he’s reached the safety of the elevator that he realizes the undertones of frustration lining the omega’s scent.
“I don’t know.” Dean averts his gaze, looking suddenly unsure of himself. “Wasn’t it? You don’t even like me.”
“I don’t.”
“His name is Castiel.”
“Will you marry me?”
Cas’ pupils dilated, eyes dropping down to Dean’s lips. “Later,” he promised, kissing Dean once, open-mouthed and filthy. “I don’t want to come too soon.”
Next to him, Cas laid down and stretched out. “That was enjoyable.”
“Fuck you,” Dean spits. Castiel ducks back down, licking over Dean’s hole and grasping his cock with his free hand at the same time, giving it a few strokes. “Ugh, just fuck me already.”
Dean swallowed. “I- I do want to.”
Once they’re behind closed doors, Castiel still doesn’t make a move to touch him. He sits down on the bed, looking at Dean with about as much enthusiasm as a kid at the dentist.
But being a vessel was different. Riding shotgun in his own head, feeling his limbs move without permission. Seeing his body being used to hurt people. To kill them. And that was only when Michael allowed him close enough to the surface to see.
“And boss them around,” Dean added, thinking back to the night before, and
“…I guess so.”
“Because you were in love with her, Dean!”
They part, and something occurs to Dean.
For all that Charlie had insisted Dean’s plan was stupid, she sure seemed excited to play along. But this was basically LARPing, plus the added bonus of lying to her friend and Dean’s significant other.
Sam and Eileen arrive half an hour after Dean and Cas, Jack in tow. This is the real test; Sam and Dean may not spend as much time together in the past few months as they did in the years before but he’s still the person who knows Dean best and would be the most likely to notice a difference.
"Positive," Cas replies grimly.
That just left Dean, stewing in his shame, feeling like the absolute biggest asshole in the world. He just stood there, rooted to the spot for a couple of moments, stomach churning and nausea rising in his throat. Finally, he couldn't take it anymore, and bolted for the bathroom.
Which reminds Dean, he needs to pick out a book to write his English essay about.
He was babbling. Why was he babbling?
Cas didn’t call him out on the half-assed excuse. He got up, rubbing his hip, giving Dean an uncertain smile. “Do you not do this often?”
"I like bees," Cas adds, clearly picking up on Dean's sarcasm. "They're beautiful."
guys until we…”
is about) is said to be haunted not only by Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote but also by a ghost called Mr. Bubbly who is known for pinching people’s butts.
Cas stills. When he talks, it’s clear he’s picking his words carefully. “I didn’t know you had a brother.”
“I do like having you to myself,” Cas said, trailing between Dean’s cheeks with two lubed fingers. “Spread.”
“I was on my way out,” Jamie said, “But I’ll be in town for a couple of days, if you want to hang out."
For a long minute, neither one of them spoke. They drew their hands back, wiping their hands on each other’s skin – they were both filthy anyway, and Dean would definitely also have to wash this carpet – and just breathed.
“No,” he says. “But I… I came across some of his photos at a local antique store last week.”
She turned to leave, and Dean
Dean is just about to turn in for the night when he gets a call on his work cell. It’s an unfamiliar voice but he says one of Dean’s regulars recommended him. He sets up a meeting at the motel Dean frequents, eager for his services as soon as possible. Dean tells him he’ll be there in ten.
"Yeah?"
“He was the first man I, uh,” he shrugs “y’know. We hadn’t even known each other a month when he took these but…”
"I do worry about you, Dean," Jimmy says.
His name is Castiel. He’s not bad looking, or as old as Dean had feared, but he’s still an alpha that Dean is being given to without his consent or input. He also looks at Dean with a faint look of disdain, like Dean is something he dragged into the house on his shoe.
At the mention of their last meeting, Cas stiffens. He doesn’t say anything and Dean’s not sure if that’s a good sign. It at least means that he can keep making an idiot of himself until Cas sees it fit to stop him.
"I've found their name," Cas says. "The other spirit. I figured if they're gotten rid of, then maybe Jimmy will want to-"
Cas ate him out with incredible ferocity, tongue moving over and inside Dean’s hole, the sound echoing around the room along with the almost continuous moans and whimpers coming from Dean’s mouth that he just couldn’t keep in. It was so strange, unlike anything he’d felt before. His dick was rock hard and
He looks down at the card in his hands. It’s printed in pristine white, elegant gold letters spelling Castiel’s name, title, and contact information. If Dean tosses it out, Castiel won’t bother him again. Not that Dean has anything to go on but his word, but for some reason that’s enough. He feels like he could tell if Castiel was lying to him.
“Somewhere with grass?” Dean suggests. “The park? The beach? I don’t know, fucking Las Vegas?”
Most of the rest of the texts are from Benny but there’s also a couple from Bobby and two from Tessa, Dean’s editor. He hasn’t opened those because he has nothing new to show her, so why bother?
“Then get inside me,” Dean groaned.
“I’ll be thorough,” Cas promised, now tugging at the buttons and zipper on Dean’s jeans.
The sun has just begun to rise when Dean parks outside of
“I’ll have a Jack and Coke,” Meg orders, oblivious to Castiel’s shock or perhaps just ignoring it. She hasn’t had the misfortune of meeting Dean yet.
“Shit, you okay man?” Dean asked.
it hits.
He sits down on the floor next to Cas. He hears Cas huff and feels a little guilty, winding the poor guy up like that and then stopping as soon as things were getting good.
“Sure, that’s what it looked like.”
Dean has a better idea.
Sam leans against the steering wheel. He must be there a while because suddenly Eileen is there and it’s dark outside. She says something to him he can’t understand, then she’s pulling him out of his seat. He goes, stumbling against her.
“Fuck,” Dean breathes, breaking away just for a moment. His eyes are dark with desire, flush high on his cheeks. He’s never looked this good. “Didn’t know you had it in you.”
“You kissed me,” Dean repeats.
Miss Milton sighs. "Sure. Just remember, I'm always here if you need to talk."
“How could I?”
Sam rolls his eyes. “Very funny, Dean. I’ve seen what you’re doing now, it’s not gonna work anymore.”
Dean clears his throat. “No, he did. I just – I’m not expecting you to forgive me or feel sorry for me or whatever, just because my dad died. I just needed you to know that what I said the other day had nothing to do with you.”
Dean doesn’t wanna call him out on it. He feels sick thinking about all the things he could have done that he doesn’t remember, everything he might have said to Cas.
“Yeah,” Dean said hoarsely.
Dean takes a sip. The coffee is a little too hot still and it tastes as mediocre as it always does. It wouldn’t surprise him if every cup Cas makes was identical to the last. “That wasn’t an answer.”
Technically, he wasn’t wallowing anymore. He was doing something about his problems. Technically, it wasn’t even unhealthy behavior, because it wasn’t Daphne he was about to stalk. And really, could it even be called stalking?
“Even more reason to make sure you get home okay, then.”
He’s used to wielding his body like a tool. To hunt. To save people. To make money in whatever way an unskilled seventeen year old with no parental supervision could.
“Dean,” he breathes in relief as Dean blinks his eyes open.
“Can’t, they got lost in the move.” Dean shoots him a winning smile. “Surely you can put up with some Zeppelin for a few minutes?”
"Dean-"
It was nearing midnight now and most of the guests were trickling out. Cas was out in the garden, keeping Balthazar company as he smoked, and Dean hadn’t gotten a text from Charlie in twenty minutes which probably meant Daphne had already left without their notice.
“Yeah, but…” Dean licks his lips. “Why don’t you wanna touch me, then?”
Cas suggests they use the interim time to pick up wedding rings. They wind up spending the next day driving to Topeka, where they find a couple of silver rings in a pawn shop. They’re tarnished but otherwise in good condition and once they get home, Dean spends the rest of the evening cleaning them while trying very hard not to think about just what they’re for.
He was and yet, hearing Cas say it made something hot and angry spark in Dean’s gut. “Oh, fuck you. How would you feel if I invited one of my exes over?”
Cas laughed. Then he reached for Dean, cupping his cheek and pulling him in for a dizzying kiss. Dean crowded closer to him, needing to anchor himself with the feel of skin on skin, feeling like he would float away if he didn’t.
, of course. A rare commodity. A precious thing to have and to show off, to add to the family prestige.
He wasn’t drunk enough for that, though.
“Yeah, she’s a champ,” Dean says, chest swelling with pride. He can still see Emma from here, toddling her way up the short steps to the slide.
“You’re so warm,” Cas panted into his ear, as if he were affected as deeply as Dean. “So
“Maybe,” Dean says doubtfully.
There's genuine concern in his voice that throws Dean off kilter.
“What-” Dean licks his lips, chasing the taste of beer off his lips. “What...”
Huge thanks as always to avyssoseleison for her read-throughs and reassurances!
“I don’t wanna talk about it,” Dean mutters.
A day and a half later and Castiel’s rut has crossed from sounding painful to sounding
They walk on, to the older part of the cemetery, and it's not until they reach what Cas assures him is the right grave that Dean realizes he's got no idea what they're here to do.
“You’re loud,” Cas says.
Castiel flushes. “I’m not sure that’s a good idea.”
It was good. Fun. Cas sure as hell was a better rebound than Daphne had ever been. Dean went days without thinking about Lisa, which was a first since she’d dumped him.
“Well, he should know,” he settles on, just to be petulant.
“Will you or your partner be picking her up? Or both of you?”
at him. Finally, a slow smile spread on his lips. It was warm and joyful and so damn beautiful, Dean felt honest-to-god butterflies in his stomach at the sight of it. “You love me?”
“You want me to crash your date?” Charlie purses her lips and Dean rolls his eyes. “Not-date, friend date, whatever.”
Cas goes willingly, drawing in a shuddered gasp as their lips meet. Dean doesn’t have the energy to do much more than softly press his lips against Cas’, and even though the kiss is short his lungs still burn when they part.
He doesn’t need to check to know that there are no messages from Sam.
Dean looks over at Cas, who is staring at their doubles with a pained kind of longing in his expression.
“You don’t think it’d be creepy?”
, he just needs to word them right so they come out casual and not calculated.
In response, Cas spun them around again, putting himself back on top. “I accept your terms.”
“It’s not. At least, not in a professional sense.”
Cas’ eyes widen. “Yes, but he’s the only other one!”
"What do you want?"
“I’m not sure,” Castiel admits. Then, feeling unexpectedly bold, he adds, “But I do want to kiss you again.”
That doesn’t explain the kiss in the kitchen but Dean is sure he could find an explanation for that one if he tried. Maybe Cas was sleepwalking or something. Dean doesn’t wanna think too much about it because thinking about the kisses means thinking about Cas pretending they never happened.
“I told him last night.”
“Even geniuses have their off days, huh?”
Dean shakes his foot loose from Cas’ to kick his little brother underneath the table. Sam shoots him a glare, kicking back.
“It’s fine,” Cas said, waving down the bartender. He ordered them a couple of beers as they waited, sliding one over Dean who gratefully accepted. “I seem to recall that we met
"Because I'm with you in those classes, dickhead, and I'm not completely blind."
He was right about one thing: the relationship between Dean and Cain wasn’t just one of photographer and model. Judging by the fact that Dean inherited at least a large sum of Cain’s estate, if not all of it, they were still together upon his death.
Meg feigned gagging.
His last thought before he blacks out is that this is a really embarrassing way to go.
The barn looks empty at first glance but Dean can already tell it’s not. It’s not even hearing or seeing, it’s the feeling in the air - there’s something lurking in the shadows, just waiting to get the drop on them.
“That’s not true,” he says weakly. “You know it’s not true.”
“Cas,” Dean protests weakly, but it’s drowned in the noise.
That last detail caught his attention, and Dean’s eyes snapped open as memories started flooding in. Stalking Daphne’s ex on Facebook and then in real life. Going home from the bar with him.
“Admit it,” he muttered in Dean’s ear.
“Right. Uh, it obviously wasn’t working out and I was expecting her to dump me any day. Then I overheard her talking on the phone with some friend about how I wasn’t even as good in bed as her ex.”
“Don’t mention it,” Sam said, voice softer. “See you Saturday?”
“Dude, no. You don’t gotta be sorry about leaving when someone makes you uncomfortable.”
Dean closes the fridge and walks over to hug her. She’s smiling at him when they part, eyes shining. “What’s wrong?”
They finished the episode together, then Sam left with yet another reminder for Dean to get over himself and rejoin decent society. As Dean looked around the apartment, he couldn’t ignore the nagging feeling that Sam had a point. The curtains were drawn and the kitchen counter was littered with empty take-out boxes and bottles of beer. Dean let out a sigh, allowing himself one more moment of indulgent self-pity, then got to work.
The disapproving frown wasn’t a much better reaction, though.
It was over entirely too soon, Cas pulling away with a soft smile.
to deserve being under such close watch.
“It hasn’t benefited me so far.” Castiel doesn’t sound bitter, so much as resigned. “My cousin has suggested this to me before but it’s not until recently that I’ve given it much thought. Maybe he’s right, maybe I need to get this over with.”
Dean takes it, hesitating as the guilt squirms in his gut. He’s come to the uncomfortable realization that if Castiel were human, he wouldn’t have hesitated to apologize for his rudeness. It doesn’t seem right not to, just because of that.
“Sure.”
It's obvious as soon as he enters the street that Maggie's definition of 'a few' is pretty loose. There are already enough people there so that the party has spilled into the front yard. And they're loud, too. Sam wouldn't be surprised if someone has already called the police to complain about the noise.
“You’re terrible at this,” Dean sulked. “I shoulda called Sam.”
“I’ll be quick. Where is it?”
It’s another three days before Dean finds himself back at
“Benny asked you out first,” Sam points out. “So did Aaron, right?”
Dean would feel bad about that once he stopped being terrified of Cas finding out and dumping his ass like he probably deserved.
Well, shit.
“To drink?”
“Oh,” he breathes, looking down at Dean who turned around at some point during the night and is now resting his head against Castiel’s chest. He’s also awake, although barely, peering at Castiel from underneath heavy eyelids.
Cas nods decisively. “Alright then. Now?”
Besides. “I did promise you a blowjob, didn’t I?”
“Cas, what the fuck are you doing?” Dean shouts but it’s too late.
He’s been to see his therapist four times in that period, at first escorted by Charlie and then managing the last visit by himself. He’s been out to meet up with friends, all of them politely ignoring the weeks of radio silence and picking up where they left off. Even Bobby’s been by, mostly to bitch at Dean for never calling and to complain that the elevator in his apartment building smells like weed.
“I really should be going home,” he tells him.
Isn’t in the backseat. It’s just a body. His brother’s gone.
Just to spite him, Castiel answers: “I will have the Lemon Basil Margarita.”
Dean snorts. “Meaning someone got an ass full of arrows?”
Something caught in Dean’s throat. He squeezed the hand still holding his. “You’re doing great, Mom.”
“Fine,” Dean says. “But for the record, I can still kick your ass, omega or not. So don’t get any funny ideas.”
“I’m just- nevermind,” Dean says. “Do you enjoy what you do?”
Charlie would love him, Dean thinks, but he hesitates at the thought of actually introducing them. He kind of likes having Cas to himself.
“Dean? Dean Winchester?”
“I’ll call you soon,” he promised.
Dean decides then and there that he hates him.
Dean smiles sadly. “I know you’re serious about this. And I’m sorry you got stuck with… it would be better for you just to forget me.”
“But my sister and I do still talk,” he added. “And I’m sure she’d love to meet you.”
"Don't be such a wuss, dude."
After they’ve sat in silence for a couple of minutes, Dean puts them both out of their misery.
“She’s your ex-girlfriend, too," Cas said wryly.
"Dean, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to-"
His stomach was already twisting itself in knots; he’d thought he was ready to talk to Cas but now he just wanted to put off the inevitable anger and break-up for as long as possible.
She stands and Sam grabs her hand as she goes, pressing a kiss against it. Dean looks away, but he knows Sam is signing something to her.
“That’s what it was.” Castiel hesitates, then admits with some trepidation, “I would have liked it to be more but… Dean and Cain were together. I’m not going to make advances on someone who is still grieving the loss of their partner.”
Cas nods, a hint of shyness in the way he holds out his touchpad to Dean. “It’s not very good but-”
A few months ago, that kind of subterfuge would have pissed him off. Now, he sees it for what it is: they’re worried about him.
It must be an hour later that Eileen comes to get him, judging by the dried tear tracks on his face. She pulls Sam to his feet, tugs him down for a lingering kiss.
“I couldn't have done it without you. Not any of it. Not if you hadn’t come, not if you hadn’t refused to leave without me at the cost of your own life.”
“Please what?”
Darkness.
Dean’s brain short circuits. When it comes back online, Cas is pulling away, still that same soft, inscrutable smile on his face.
“Well,” he said, leaning against her side. “This is me.”
“On two walks daily,” Eileen finishes patiently. “I know, Dean. He’ll be fine until you get back.”
It’s good.
"Of course," Cas repeats, a little softer.
Dean’s breath catches in his throat. It’s ridiculous; he has sex for a living but just having Castiel in his personal space, not even touching him yet, has him dizzy with want.
And if Castiel flashes back to those images she planted later that night, once he’s alone in bed, then no one else needs to know.
i swear this fic has an ending, i just keep getting distracted on my way there.
They go through dinner without anyone mentioning it. Dean makes a point of reaching across the table as many times as he can, showing off the ring glinting on his finger. Cas must notice him doing it, judging by the fond exasperation on his face, but he’s the only one.
Sam is pretty sure that Maggie Barton in homeroom likes him. He's caught her looking at him a few times and she's always playing with her hair and touching him on the arm or shoulder when she talks to him, which Sam is pretty sure means she's flirting. But he doesn't want to get his hopes up. Maggie Barton is like ten kinds of hot and way out of his league. Maybe she's just being friendly.
Dean shakes his head.
“That was nice,” Cas said when they broke apart.
“And did you? Believe her?”
Cas ain’t gonna rescue himself from the Empty.
Dean grins, leans in, and just like that they’re done talking. That’s fine, Castiel thinks as he bites down on Dean’s bottom lip, eliciting a soft moan.
They’ve each got a beer in hand, courtesy of Dean’s last trip to the grocery store before he bit the big one for the second-to-last time.
That last part was said with a pointed look at Dean, who had, in fact, not told them anything about Cas other than his gender.
Jimmy smiles bitterly. "I think you mean the
Right. This was happening.
Rewind.
Carefully, Dean sucked on the head, grasping the rest of Cas’ dick with one hand and pumping it slightly. He tongued at the slit, remembering what he himself liked, and was rewarded with a guttural groan. Sucking dick honestly wasn’t as strange as Dean had expected; it really was just one step away from a handjob, which was just one step away from masturbation. Totally not gay.
“He doesn’t belong to you, asshole,” Dean shouts back but it’s less intimidating than he’d like, since he’s still got his hands covering his ears and is unable to stand quite straight even with Cas’ help. “Just let him go and go back to sleep like a nice little eldritch abomination!”
Dean doesn’t give him the satisfaction of a stare down, clambering off his lap and out of his embrace. “Yep.”
“Should I be worried?”
Cas shoots him an amused look. “Is this because Sam claimed he always knew we’d get together when we first told him we were involved?”
"Do you remember when we talked about the drive-in-theater?" Jimmy asks. "You said they weren't your thing."
crowded. It looks like everyone in their year and the adjacent ones got invited; Sam didn't even know there
“I- I’m not… that is, I never-” Why was this so hard? Dean wasn't even at the part where he needed to come up with excuses yet, this was just the truth, plain and simple. “I don’t really date guys. Or sleep with them. I’ve always been into women. It’s just...”
“Oh.” Dean shifts, warmth rising to his cheeks. “Um, yeah, large black coffee to go?”
(btw if you have a chance to see it, check out the movie Tom of Finland (2017). It's amazing.)
.” Castiel’s voice is rough and commanding and to his annoyance, Dean finds himself snapping his mouth shut on instinct. “Leave it and go,
The fucker sounded so amused, too. For how fast he’d gotten the prep over with, he didn’t seem to be in a hurry now that he had his dick inside Dean.
He pauses. This hasn’t worked so far, but what the hell.
Fuck that. He’s not gonna give Castiel the satisfaction of wanting him. Especially not when Castiel so obviously doesn’t want him back.
“Hang on, Dean,” Cas commands.
“Hey, I’m right here.” Sam’s peering up at him - must be crouching, the tall bastard - hands still cupping Dean’s face. “I’m not going anywhere, I’m not-”
For some reason, Dean finds himself back in the library after school. He didn't even mean to go there, but it's where his feet took him. He's as drawn to this place as he is repelled by it.
“Let’s not tell anyone,” he says. “At least, not before dessert. Let’s see if they notice first.”
He trails off. The word's clearly too much for him, and Dean can't blame him. "I don't think so. You haven't talked to him?"
“Of course.” Cas’ brow furrowed. “Wait, have you been-”
He collapsed against the mattress, with just enough presence of mind to avoid the wet spot, gasping as if he’d just finished running a marathon.  “
“I knew what I was doing,” he tells Dean. “The Empty never would have let me go while I still had it. It couldn’t be helped.”
His upper hand lasted for about ten seconds. Then Cas’ fingers returned between his legs, slick with lube, and he was pressing one finger inside Dean. It stung and felt really fucking strange but something about it also went straight to Dean’s cock. Cas seemed to know exactly what he was doing because it wasn’t long before Dean started to loosen and he was adding another finger, twisting them expertly.
Dean went willingly, lying down next to Cas, gasping in surprise when Cas grabbed his dick. He started jerking, hard and fast, the friction burning a little from the lack of lube but feeling so,
Dean has never felt less happy to see her.
Dean spares one glance at Castiel before turning his attention to Meg with a charming smile. “You’ve got it. And for your boyfriend?”
“Hey,” Dean said, giving her a smile he hoped didn’t look too pained.
“And you’re sure he’s not ready to move on? Because he doesn’t seem
Her visit is short because Dean’s apartment is a mess and he’s not gonna let her in but she still manages to pester him on a long list of topics from the doorway: to call Bobby (
It didn’t even feel like a lie.
He told her everything, in probably more detail than he needed to or that Daphne wanted to hear, but once he got started he couldn’t seem to stop. It took only about five minutes total but it felt like half an eternity before he finally finished talking.
“Nothing,” he mutters, shrugging off his jacket. “You should see the other guy.”
“But you don’t need to.” Keith steps closer to him, crowding against Dean. He puts his hand on Dean’s waist.
“Dean?” There was no way of telling Cas’ tone of voice through the door but Dean couldn’t imagine he would be anything other than angry. Maybe hurt. Betrayed. “Come out, please. We need to talk.”
He took Cas’ fingers in deep, mirroring the action with his hand on Cas’ cock and feeling it twitch in his grip.
“You’re sure?” Cas asked, uncharacteristically bashful.
“Maybe you’re holding her wrong.”
“Why didn’t you ever hook up with her?” The question tastes bitter on Dean’s tongue and he’s not sure why. “Can’t tell me it’d be a sin, it’s not fornication if you’re married.”
Cas finally looks away. His expression is impossible to read.
“Cas?” Dean grabs his shoulder. “You okay?”
“I wouldn’t go that far.”
Dean makes a face. “I guess so. He’s technically a regular at Rocky’s but I don’t know why. He’s got nothing but complaints about the beer, the music, the, ugh, decor. And when he’s not complaining, he’s hitting on me.”
It’s a little past midnight, so not the hour he usually visits, but Dean needs to go outside and feel like something resembling human for at least a few minutes.
Charlie had texted.
The police show up not half an hour later to break up the party. Sam can't find it in him to care, though. Tonight, he got to hug Maggie Barton. He got to drink punch that tasted mostly like cheap vodka with Maggie Barton, got to look at her smile shyly at him over the rim of her cup.
Dean blushes. “Sorry. I just hate it when people talk about family not being real, just because you’re not related by blood.”
Great, now Dean’s made Cas feel like
“What a sweet girl you two have,” coos a woman sitting across the aisle from them.
The next day, Dean got home from work and Mom was sitting on the couch, waiting for him. He hadn’t been expecting to face her until tomorrow, so the sight of her filled him with unexpected dread. Why the hell would she be here now?
Cas comes back from his jog about an hour before noon and with the mildest of prodding convinces Dean to join him in the shower. Afterwards, they throw together a lunch made from yesterday’s leftovers, taking their time eating and playing footsie under the table, because that’s apparently the kind of couple they are.
“Please,” Cas instructs.
“Yeah?”
“I’m going to bend you over this table, and finger and spank you until you’re begging for release. Then I’m going to fuck you.”
He’s been in contact with Tessa, getting an extension on the deadline for the first draft of his novel and a gentle kick in the pants to just finish polishing his short story collection so it can be sent to print. His sleeping schedule is finally approaching something regular again, though it’s still not exactly normal.
Dean for his part was doing a very good impression of a goldfish. “Uhhh.”
“Debauched,” was Cas’ not-at-all comforting answer.
And that was their first conversation in almost two years.
“I don’t like talking about it.” Dean leans on his elbow. If he’s being mopey, he’s got reason to be. “I haven’t seen Sam since he went off to college.”
Dean nods. His cheeks have gone pink, Castiel notices. “Right! You, uh, you run?”
"Oh, shit," she whispered.
He brings the wet paintbrush to the canvas, when a sudden blast of electric guitar startles him. Castiel’s hand twitches at the shock, leaving a bright red streak covering what constitutes at least an hour’s work.
“Yeah,” Dean admitted. “Not… not Lisa-serious, yet. But it’s getting there.”
He’s just finished that thought when Cas palms his cheek and pulls him in for a sloppy kiss. It’s nothing like when he kissed Dean in their kitchen, short and sweet. Cas’ tongue is licking the seam of Dean’s mouth and Dean is pretty sure that’s a
Keith shrugs. “I get you. Do you mind if I sit here, anyway?”
Cas laughed wryly. “God, no. Not that they would come even if I asked them. But I did… I was going to ask one of my exes. Daphne.”
“We should still go,” Sam agrees. “Just maybe explain the whole thing to her before she sees you up and about again.
“Is this because you’re a prostitute?”
,” Cas whined.
“I don’t see you coming up with a better one.”
gone out for breakfast and he’s worrying over nothing. Still, to be sure, he decides to call.
He’s cut off by warm lips on his. He freezes at first then melts into, melts into Cas and his kiss, such a long time coming and yet not a moment too soon.
Castiel growls again, carrying Dean towards the couch and dropping him unceremoniously. If Dean is still coherent enough to sass him, he’s not doing his job.
As if Dean hadn’t been telling himself that for the entire duration of their relationship. “I know.”
“Yes,” Castiel agrees. He swallows, mouth suddenly and inexplicably dry. “I didn’t know you were an omega.”
“She’s lucky to have you,” Mom continues. “And you’re both lucky to have Castiel. I’m glad you’ve all found each other.”
Dean hums. Cas isn’t paying attention to the conversation, too busy reading the plaque in front of the cage.
Dean winces. A heat is extremely unpleasant to go through alone – he should know, he’s gone through them all by himself under the wakeful eyes of his family to make sure he remained chaste – and he can’t imagine a rut being any easier.
your thing?"
“I am approaching my rut.”
And yet, nothing.
the one who doesn't love him."
“Was?” Dean repeated.
Dean leans against the doorframe and grins at him, as if he doesn’t know exactly why Castiel is there.
Well. Looks like Dean isn’t the
He hangs up before Dean can get a word in. He looks at his phone, annoyed and a little offended.
While Cas was busy with the bottle of lube, Dean reached down and with only slight hesitation, grabbed Cas’ dick. Cas faltered, groaning when Dean tightened his grip, running his thumb over the head of Cas’ dick.
Sam raises his bottle, smiling. “To family?”
And seriously, how many women did this supposedly gay guy have chasing after him?
"Anyone sitting here?"
Cas doesn't elaborate further, and he doesn't need to.
“I’m sorry,” she’s saying, lips right against his ears, and she’s hugging him. When did she start hugging him? “I’m so, so sorry.”
“He didn’t even give me time to pick out flowers,” Dean informs Sam gravely.
They turned around, facing Daphne and a curly-haired woman Dean hadn’t seen before. It had been a couple of months since they’d last run into Daphne but they were all on good terms by now, and she looked happy enough to see them.
Cas raises his head peering up at him. “We - we made it?”
For now, he’d just enjoy the ride.
“Don’t die more than you already have,” Jack offers.
“You cheated,” Cas answers without hesitating. “Hussy.”
He gets up, pulls Dean into a crushing hug. Dean hugs him back, tight, then pats his back. “C’mon, you big girl, don’t keep your girlfriend waiting.”
But it's Cas who speaks first. “You’ve been avoiding me.”
“…Girlfriend, huh?” Dean said after a short silence.
Finally, with a pointed elbow from Kaia and a hangdog expression from Cas, Claire mumbles that she’s happy for them. While Dean doesn’t doubt that’s true he also knows that this is more complicated for her than the rest of them, and for the first time he kind of feels guilty about springing this news on everyone.
Dean swallows, warmth crawling into his cheeks. “Do you… need help with that?”
The ride into town is quiet. Cas plays his mixtape - the damn thing should be worn out by now and Dean should long since be sick of it but for reasons too sappy to mention he isn’t - and they sit and listen in comfortable silence. It’s not until they pass the town hall on their way to the supermarket that Cas gets a contemplative look on his face.
Sam and Eileen exchange looks.
Maybe he's going crazy. Wouldn't that be something.
Dean slams the book shut. Anger flares up in his chest, hot and demanding, then dies down just as quick. It’s hard for him to hold onto any emotion these days. “What are you saying, Sam? That we should give up?”
Dean’s mind raced, trying to think of something to say that wouldn’t either completely screw him over or make him look like a total asshole.
“Why?”
“I’m not anymore!” Dean exploded. “I’m not in love with anyone but your stupid ass!”
Because Dean is a
"You fought it."
“Sorry?” Dean scratches the back of his neck. “I dunno what to tell you, we’re just friends.”
, leans in and kisses him.
That’s odd. But Castiel can’t be sure Dean meant to leave them - it’s just as likely that he forgot them. Even if it was on purpose, there are dozens of innocent explanations. It’s possible he felt keeping them would be too painful a reminder of what he’s recently lost.
He sleeps through the night and he doesn’t dream.
kisser. He was enthusiastic, pressing into Dean and coaxing his lips apart with his tongue, crowding him against the door so that their bodies pressed together.
Wait, shit. Does this mean Cas jerked off to Dean’s pictures?
“Buddy, it’s a buck fifty a cup. I think I can handle it.”
“I suppose,” Cas says.
"You don't care about me," Dean points out.
And it was a pretty good ride. Over the next month, most of Dean’s free time seemed to be spent with Cas. They went to pubs, and cafés, and gallery shows. They stayed in, taking turns picking out movies to watch and shows to binge. More often than not, they ended up in bed (and, one very memorable time, the Impala’s back seat).
Understanding dawned. Dean pinched his lips together, holding back his laughter. “You memorized that speech, didn’t you?”
so i'm kind of terrible and i did not mean to leave this on a year-long hiatus. but the actual last chapter *is* mostly complete (there's only one scene left to write), it was just getting too long and i needed to cut it in two so it could have space to breathe. it'll probably be up tomorrow. possibly even tonight, if i can manage, but definitely no later than tomorrow.
… Not a mental image Dean needs right now, standing in the man’s office. But maybe one that can be tucked away for later.
“Thanks,” Dean mumbles, holding out his hand.
"I miss you," he finally says.
He got a swift response.
He trailed off, the meaning of Cas’ request hitting him like a train. His mouth dropped open, head spinning with a sudden barrage of images. Shockingly, it didn’t make his dick flag. If anything, it had the opposite effect.
Dean hands him the pad. “I like it.”
Dean’s heart jumps. “Then what are you waiting for?”
Cas reaches his hand out and it’s all Dean can do not to flinch when he cups Dean’s cheek, gently turning his head to face him. He keeps his eyes downcast, closing them when Cas leans in and kisses him.
Dean opens his mouth. Closes it again. He doesn’t have an argument here.
Dean knows he’s fucked up. He’s let this escalate too far, let himself sink too low, and now he’s hurting not just himself but the people around him.
“I- did I do something wrong?”
They turn around, since there’s no point in going in without (forged) birth certificates. Once they get to the town hall, shortly before closing, they find out that it’s a three-day mandatory waiting period between applying for a marriage license and them actually being allowed to get married.
"You should."
Cas’ cock twitched against his hand, reminding Dean of his mission, and he resumed, closing his fingers over just the head and rubbing his thumb over the slit. Cas keened against  Dean’s skin, hips twitching into Dean’s hand.
“We’re both her real dads?” Cas asks.
No sooner has the realization hit (
"I've been avoiding him," Cas admits quietly. "That's why I'm always here. He won't come here. He's afraid of the other spirit."
Whatever. Like Sam needs to be told to figure out that Cas' number is on that piece of paper. "Are you gonna call him?"
“Yeah, I guess.”
"We're gonna be here a bit longer," Dean says instead. "Dad's finished the hunt but he picked another one near Denver. Says it'll be a couple of weeks, at least."
That’s definitely not a good idea.
Dean frowned in confusion. “I thought that’s what we were…”
“Yes.” Castiel glances down at himself. Did Dean notice the pit stains on his t-shirt? How red his skin has turned with the combination of the chill and physical exertion? “I - I was. Running, that is.” He wasn’t this bad the last time he spoke to Dean, was he? This is why he needs time to mentally prepare. “I was passing by and I saw your car outside…”
“Fine,” Dean says. Then adds, “You’re sleeping on the floor.”
"Not an ounce more," Dean promises.
Cas huffed out a fond laughter and leaned against Dean’s side, warm and solid against him. Dean couldn’t resist snaking an arm around his waist, bringing them flush together. They fit perfectly like this, hip to hip, Cas' chin resting against Dean's shoulder. Dean still couldn't believe how ridiculously lucky he'd gotten.
Dean reaches out for him but it's too late. He's gone, and with his disappearance, every light bulb in the cafeteria explodes. People start shrieking, running for the doors, but Dean can't move even as glass starts raining over him.
“Anything else?”
Cas hummed, absentmindedly letting his hands wander, playing with the hem of Dean’s shirt, cupping his ass.
Dean’s the one to deepen the kiss, licking the seams of Cas’ lips until they part on a sigh. He tastes sweet and sour like those stupid margaritas, and Dean thinks he might be intoxicating like them too, because he’s sure as hell feeling more buzzed by the second.
Mom snorts, swatting him. “I mean it, kid. I was so worried about you when you got the call about Emma but you’ve handled the situation better than I could have hoped for.”
Thomas Waugh, who wrote The Fruit Machine (the book this fic was inspired by) also published the book
Dean laughed weakly. “You didn’t. Cas is a guy, and he’s my boyfriend. I guess.”
“I’m Keith,” the alpha introduces himself, holding a hand out to Dean.
Just as Dean was about to grasp it, Cas bent down and bit down on his nipple. Dean’s mouth fell open in a silent gasp, pangs of pain and pleasure running down his body. Cas flattened his tongue, laving it over the spot he’d just bit, before closing his lips over Dean’s nipple and sucking.
“Family of four in Canton, Ohio. Parents were murdered, Dad’s blood drained and Mom’s tongue cut out. The kids...”
“We need to discuss the possibility that there- that there isn’t a way to get him back.”
Sam turns over in the bed and grunts in acknowledgment.
“I don’t want to go without you,” Dean counters. Whatever Cas is feeling, this much he knows. He’s never been so sure of anything. “Come with me to California, Cas.”
He hung up without waiting for a response. That was two down, the entire rest of his friends and family to go.
Lily’s eyes widened. “Long story?” she guessed.
attention.
“Will you still be over on Saturday?”
“What the-” Dean jumps to his feet. The chair rocks at the movement, the fishing pool falling down with a thud. “Where the hell am I?”
It takes Dean a moment but he responds, kissing back enthusiastically as Castiel starts tearing his clothes off. The air in the room is stale and stinks of sex, and the sheets are filthy as Castiel pushes Dean onto them. It’s far from ideal but Dean still moans like a champ when Castiel grabs his thighs and pushes into him in one, smooth thrust.
Cas didn’t seem to mind, hooking his foot over Dean’s leg and pulling himself on top of Dean, all without breaking their kiss. When they finally did break apart, they were both breathless and grinning like maniacs.
Dean looks down at the burning bones, thinks how this is Jimmy’s killer. He feels a sense of hollow satisfaction but it soon fades, leaving him with nothing but grief.
They’re married.
“My phone number,” he explained. “I like you and I’d like to spend more time with you.”
Dean.
“Drop it,” Castiel says. “Please. I don’t want to cause him any undue stress or discomfort. Telling him about those pictures was bad enough.”
Castiel’s eyes are huge and sad, and impossibly blue. Dean already loves them, knows he’ll be seeing that shade of blue wherever he goes now. Unable to resist, he grabs Castiel’s arm and pulls him close.
Cas takes a deep breath, visibly steeling himself, and nods.
“In a way, it’s flattering,” Cas mused. “You didn’t even know you liked men but you still wanted to sleep with me.”
. I can’t wait to be inside you.”
,” Dean groaned. “Fuck me already, Cas.”
Dean would know if they did, because he’s only been fantasizing about it for the better part of a decade.
Okay. He hadn’t been expecting that. Neither had Cas, judging by his stricken expression.
Eileen shook Cas’ hand too, waiting until he had dropped it to introduce herself by both signing and saying, “I’m Eileen, Sam’s girlfriend. Obviously.”
“Are you sure?”
Neither one of them has noticed Sam. They can't seem to take their eyes off each other, and Sam wonders if it's just the weed or if this is something that's been around for longer.
Cas’ lips twitched. It was a tiny movement but it was there. “She wasn’t upset?”
Dean clears his throat. "I, uh, I need to go. Get dinner ready for Sammy."
“I would be a hypocrite if it did.”
Today, both of them are seemingly feeling kind of lazy and so hardly any work gets done. It’s not until late in the afternoon that Dean feels the urge to do something productive and suggests they go out for groceries, which Cas readily agrees to.
“Dean?”
Once Castiel’s rut hits, he locks himself in his bedroom. Dean goes into the living room with his laptop to work but it soon becomes impossible to focus.
“He could crush a man’s skull, really. Getting between those thighs could be
“I’ll be the judge of that,” Dean teases, grabbing the pad.
to help me?”
"You mean, like for a date?" Dean asks. Jimmy nods, still looking down, cheeks turning pink, and realization hits Dean so hard his head almost spins. "With you?"
Dean cracks open an eye. Nothing. But then, he wasn’t really expecting it. He releases his hands, leans back in his chair. His gums are tingling and he has a sudden, overwhelming desire to grab the nearest bottle of whiskey and drink until he can’t see straight.
what he expected Cas’ takeaway to be.
“So, Cas,” Sam says. “Are you human now for good?”
There’s just one thing he needs to do first.
Dean is midway through making what he’s sure will be a kick-ass omelet when Cas walks into the kitchen. Dean can recognize him without turning around by the slow, lumbering steps; Cas has not been a morning person since he became human.
“Well, those are your options,” Dean says angrily, choking back the humiliation. “Either risk your reputation or fuck an omega who disgusts you. I’m not letting you send yourself to the hospital just because you’re being a stubborn asshole.”
Dean bristles. “The only - Jack, I’m
“I-” Castiel says. He snaps his mouth shut, unable to process this. How is this possible? Dean is an
"It's all right."
“I didn’t want you to hate me,” Cas finally says, voice small.
“Dean, I need more than that.”
. He tries running but that just makes him dizzy, makes the tension coil inside his stomach and scream at him,
“Not professionally relevant, huh?” Dean says, Cas’ words coming back to him now that the embarrassment is fading. “So you bought these for, uh, recreational use?”
Emma starts wailing again as they walk away but like Dean predicted, she stops as soon as she spots something else to occupy her interest - in this case, a big rock.
“Y-yeah.” Dean shifted in his seat, leg once more brushing against Cas’ as he did so. “I totally get you. Mind over matter. Que sera, sera. Carpe diem and all.”
Dean turns them over and yep, that’s his twenty-one year old self staring right back at him.
," Dean breathes. "All this time, you knew."
It takes Dean a moment to realize she’s misinterpreted the situation. He wonders if he should correct her but before he can, Cas answers, “Thank you.”
There was a long silence on the other end. Dean’s stomach sank, and he was one moment from breaking and saying he’d been kidding, when Mom spoke.
“No,” Cas interrupts. He gives Dean a patient smile. “No, you couldn’t have. There was no other way. It doesn’t matter, when it comes to heaven and humanity I made my choice a long time ago. There is no place I would rather be than right here.”
"Dean Winchester."
, it’s only been ten minutes since they met, and Dean feels his absence like a hole in his heart. Is this what having a soulmate is? Because it
She's waiting there now, and the way she looks at Sam almost has him tripping over his own feet. He manages to right himself at the last moment and he can feel himself blushing. Why can't he be more like Dean when it comes to girls?
They settle down in the war room once it’s all over. Once Dean and Cas have been put through the tests, once all the hugs and explanations have been exchanged, once Miracle has gotten the chance to give Dean his own slobbery welcome and Cas a wary hello.
God, how pathetic could you get?
He opened his hand. Tails.
The University is bigger than Dean remembered. After he leaves Charlie at the entrance, it takes him ten minutes just to find the right department. His casual drop-in is starting to feel like anything but when he finally spots Cas’ name on one of the office doors.
“It doesn’t count if it comes from a box, babe.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean told her.
“I don’t know about it.”
Dean closed his eyes. His stomach had dropped to the ground at the sound of Cas’ voice but there was no escaping now. Cas had seen him, had seen them both, standing next to each other in the hall. And he was coming over.
“Dean,” Dean replies, taking it. Keith holds on just a little too long, so once he lets go Dean holds his hand up to show him his wedding ring. “And just to get it right out of the way, I’m married.”
The doors opened with a soft click and then they were tumbling across the doorway, still connected at the lips. Dean just barely remembered to grab his keys from the keyhole before they were inside and the door was slamming behind them.
he could give Cas the friend speech.
“It never hurts to be prepared,” Cas responded, sinking the tip of his finger into Dean’s hole and twisting it.
“You didn’t bring a gift, Romeo?” Meg drawled.
He pulls away and it’s not until he sees Cas’ face that his brain finally catches up with him.
"Do you wanna grab a bite?"
"Have you finished the first draft yet?"
Another social faux-pas, although Castiel should really not be surprised at this point. He doesn’t generally mind when Meg is treated as the boss in the relationship – she is, really – but he knows Dean is one of those alphas who would consider it a grave insult.
After that, they fell quiet. Dean couldn’t look Cas in the face so he kept his eyes cast downward, staring at his hand on his thigh, wishing he could reach out and take it, but knowing being touched by him was probably the last thing Cas wanted right now.
It’s still not an ideal situation but they’re making the most of it. If Dean had to get married to any strange alpha, he’s glad it was Cas.
“Mornin’,” Dean says, getting a grunt in response.
“So, you could leave?” When Cas just looks increasingly uncomfortable, Dean sighs. “Do you not want to leave? Is that it?”
“I don’t wanna get back together,” Daphne blurted.
doesn’t go for the rest of our lives. I didn’t even know you then.”
“Hey,” Dean said hoarsely.
him preening.
Other Cas is staring at him like he’s never seen anything so wonderful. “
Castiel didn’t mean to but he stopped short. Dean was wearing jeans and a dark t-shirt, the bare skin on his arms glistening from the physical effort of moving. He looked like the perfect alpha specimen, an Adonis come to life. Castiel had the desperate urge to reach for his pencil and sketchbook.
"Passing through? Where are you headed?"
“But she dated you longer," Dean pointed out.
Dean hadn’t really shown he was better at sex than Cas, yet, had he? Which meant he hadn’t done what he’d set out to do, which
The waitress sighed, looking profoundly bored with the entire exchange. “We’re out of pie.”
“I think you’re making it angrier,” Cas says dryly. “Hang on.”
He licked his lips, filled with indecision. Looking someone up online was one thing, but going somewhere you knew they’d be in real life? That felt like crossing a line Dean wasn’t sure he was comfortable with crossing.
“Of course. It’s not too long ago I was in your shoes.”
Not a lot of direct references (or any) to queer culture this chapter but a couple of relevant links:
Yeah, that would go great. ‘Because I used to date Daphne and the only reason you and I even met is because she said you fucked her better’. Dean would get dumped so fast, it would make his head spin.
He doesn't say any of these things. Instead, he says, "I gotta go."
Not yet.
His voice goes quieter as he says that last part, embarrassed almost, and Dean feels a sudden swell of affection that catches him off guard.
He can’t see Cas’ face but he can practically
She looked surprised to see him. Dean could only imagine what his own face looked like; he could only hope it didn’t reflect the pure terror that had just overtaken him.
Dean blinks. His mind is still fighting to catch up with everything that happened in the last few minutes, and all he can think to do is ask again, "How long?"
“No,” Jack says glumly. “Before I knew it, I had barred myself from ever visiting Earth, or the Empty. I couldn’t rescue Castiel, couldn’t help you guys at all. All I could do was move one piece of iron in one particular direction.”
“Damn straight,” Dean muttered, bending down to kiss Cas, raising his hips to allow him room to maneuver.
“I’m glad.” Cas was smiling again, looking relieved. “I was worried I had overstepped my boundaries. I suppose this is technically only our first date.”
“Oh,” he says. “When – uh, when’s it happening?”
Sam’s not sure how he gets back to the bunker. He must have driven himself because as he comes to, he’s parked in the driveway, in the driver’s seat of the Impala, but he can’t remember how he got there.
Dean blinked. That was not what he’d been expecting.
“I’m sorry, I think I misheard.”
“Yes?” Cas says. Then he’s looking up, eyes going wide. “Oh.”
Huge thanks once again to avyssoseleison for all her read-throughs, advice, and for being a constant pain in my ass about writing more.
Cas nodded. “Good night, Dean.”
Dean swallows past the sudden bitter taste in his mouth. He looks over at Cas, who’s staring at the ceiling.
“I’ve got a lot of issues,” hah, understatement, “that I haven’t really been dealing with. And I just… I get angry sometimes, ‘cause it’s easier. But I’m starting to work through it now and I hope you do forgive me ‘cause I want us to stay friends.”
Dean glared at him, pushing him away to go and answer the door. He patted his hair down one more time before grasping the doorknob and swinging the door open. Judging by the twin smirks that appeared on Sam and Eileen’s faces once they saw him, it didn’t do much good.
Bisexual?
“And that took us thirty-two days to figure out?” Dean can’t help asking.
He keeps expecting it to happen again. For Michael to somehow take charge, despite everything, and ride his body off to kill more people for a flimsy excuse of a cause. And he keeps remembering over and over how he forced Gadreel into Sam and then the feeling of helplessness is replaced by a wave of self loathing.
"You're talking about the ghost?" Dean asks.
Castiel announces it casually over breakfast. So casual that Dean misses the content of his words at first. Once they hit him, he drops his fork.
Cas always joins them, even though he must have better things to do. Dean expected his social life to suffer since becoming a single parent, and it has, but he’s seen more of Cas in the past few months than in the last three years combined.
Dean blinks.
Oh. They’re at the bunker. In the dungeon, more specifically, the exact same place Cas was last snatched from him. Dean inhales, looks down and - sure enough, there’s Cas, sprawled across him and groaning as he slowly comes to.
Cas flushed, looking pleased at the attention. Dean was kind of new to the PDA thing, at least with men, but if it made Cas look like that every time then he could live with it.
“Well, what is it then?”
“Except Dr. Sexy.”
“Cas-” he flushed, hardly believing what he was about to suggest, “I wanna blow you.”
that was never a part of it. The second and maybe third time we slept together, yeah, I was still thinking of it in term of some stupid competition that only existed in my head but everything – the dates, all the stuff that came after, that was just us. I do love you. Even if I have a fucked up way of showing it sometimes.”
Not that Dean seems altogether… uninterested. But Castiel knows better than to take his flirtations seriously. Or to dwell on the exact tilt of his smile when Castiel says something he finds amusing, or the way his eyelashes fan across his cheeks whenever he glances down. Cheeks which are dusted with freckles and turn delightfully pink at the slightest provocation and… maybe Castiel is dwelling.
Then Cas is pulling away. Dean opens his eyes again, immediately caught by that familiar blue, and just like that the doubt is creeping back in.
A sudden chill runs down Dean's spine. "Oh?"
It’s still setting in. Cas kissed him. He kissed Cas. They have now kissed. Dean no longer needs to wonder what Cas’ lips will feel like against his. No longer needs to wonder if he’ll ever work up the courage to make the first step or if Cas will do it for him.
Eventually, Dean decides they need to check out the rest of the zoo. He begins to walk away from the cage but Emma starts immediately wailing, reaching both hands out to the monkeys.
It didn’t take much to understand what was on his mind, even for a clueless idiot like Dean. Now was the time to make an excuse and bolt. Except…
They’ve been drinking - him and Cas, that is. Sam is nowhere near the bunker right now and honestly, thank God for that too, because all they’ve had tonight is pitcher after pitcher of margaritas.
“Are you saying no?” Cas asks, mildly curious, as if they’re talking about the fucking weather and not getting married. “Because we don’t have to.”
Dean stares, feeling like he’s just stumbled into a lecture. It’s interesting stuff but not really what he came here for.
?” he asked, incredulous but mostly amused.
Dean had been in love exactly once before.
"None of your business, squirt," Dean replies, which is just really unfair. Sam's almost as tall as Dean is now.
Cas grimaces. “The cherub was under the witch’s protection, I couldn’t sense him. And once we were on his trail he… distracted us quite successfully.”
“Sorry, husband.”
The girl's eyes widen in recognition. "Oh!" She looks over her shoulder, then back to Dean. "Castiel is doing inventory. I'll go get him."
Somehow, they managed to get themselves naked while hardly separating for air. Dean was pretty sure Cas had torn some buttons off his shirt and there was a good chance he’d wrecked the zipper on Cas’ pants with how hard he’d yanked it, but it was hard to care with miles of glorious skin pressing warm against his own and Cas’ cock leaking against his thigh.
Castiel still doesn’t touch him, though. They still sleep in separate rooms. They’re getting closer but they’re more like casual acquaintances than an actual married couple.
a dork. “It’s nice to finally meet you.”
Given that he’s ignoring every other person in his life, it’s strange how quickly it’s become routine to go down to
me, c'mon."
“You’d still be alive,” Jack admits. “But,” he adds quickly, “I can put you back. Just as soon as you’ve gotten Cas from the Empty.”
Dean doesn’t say what he’s thinking, which is that he’s closing in on six months himself and you don’t see him bitching about it. In between taking care of Cain and opening Rocky’s, he hasn’t had much time for a personal life, never mind trolling for hook-ups.
He goes up to Castiel’s door and knocks.
“That you called me a pussy for watching like three weeks ago.”
Dean growled in frustration. “You know what I mean.”
ghost in the school?"
But, no. Cas needs him on his A-game.
“Yes,” Cas says, matter-of-factly. Then, “I’m going to kiss you again, if you don’t mind.”
“You have to admit that I’m better at sex than you.”
Married or not, they’ve already promised themselves to each other for the rest of their lives. Til death do them part doesn’t even begin to describe it, and in sickness and in health is almost laughable at this point.
making Vietnamese beef stew,” Dean said, leading Cas into the kitchen. “You can’t cook worth a damn, so you’re on chopping board duty.”
Instead, he would have to avoid Daphne for the duration of the party. Keep an eye out for her, make sure they weren’t ever in the same room, stay in the bathroom for half the night if he needed to. Shouldn’t be too hard, right?
“Dean...”
“He is, isn’t he?” Sam asks, smirking. “Your… what did Charlie call him, your hot professor?”
Cas’ mouth actually snapped shut at that. He looked annoyed at himself in the next moment and it took some restraint for Dean not to laugh. Probably not the best thing to do right now.
Whatever it was, it’s clearly not happening again.
The world goes black.
There were still no new messages on his phone but when Dean got back home, Cas was sitting on his couch.
“Love is the best aphrodisiac,” Cas said, somehow managing to keep a straight expression on his face as he said it. “And I would like to make love to you now, Dean.”
that night, his mood too foul and his energy sapped.  He sleeps through the night and most of the day, finding himself wide-awake the following evening as his sleeping schedule has been thrown for yet another curve.
Dean smiles. It hurts but it’s okay, because Sam smiles back, just for a second, and it’s enough. It has to be enough, because time’s running out.
“I will, I promise.”
From where he was sitting, there was nothing remarkable about this Castiel guy at all. Granted, he was more handsome in person than in his pictures, but he looked so stiff and serious. At least, until one of the women he was with said something that made him laugh. Then Dean could almost see whatever charm had drawn Daphne to him in the first place.
, he’d only tasted because he was curious.
Dean held up his hands. “Whoa, first off I’m bi, not gay, and you did not
The woman cranes her neck, peering curiously around Dean at Cas. "Which one of you is her real dad?”
Cas smiles at him, so bright and easy that it makes Dean’s heart stutter. He takes Dean’s hand, rubbing his thumb over the cool silver of Dean’s ring.
"Dean."
He’s in a lousy mood by the time he heads down to
Cas’ jaw clenched. “That’s different.”
), to take a shower (
The few seconds it took him to put on the condom felt endless, but then Cas was grabbing Dean’s hip with one hand and using the other to guide himself inside him. He went torturously slow, pushing at first just the head of his dick inside Dean, then pulling it back out, making Dean’s rim tug at his cock.
Dean blinks up at Castiel, the furrow between his brows deepening. “What the hell did you think I was?”
“Maybe he went out for breakfast?”
), to go outside (
There is also the longing to barge into Dean’s apartment and show the omega just how much better he could take care of them. But Castiel is a civilized alpha, unlike some. In any case, he’s sure the omega’s heat will have passed soon enough.
Dean blinks. This is not how it’s supposed to go – the androids follow a very set script and they don’t deviate from it, ever.
Emma slides down, stumbling as she lands but managing to stay on her feet. She shrieks in delight, running back around to the steps to go again.
He knows he’s being a dick but he can’t help it. He feels tired and frustrated with himself and with Charlie, and allowing it to transform into anger is all too easy.
ofc i had to include dean thirsting over cas' thighs. and ofc i also had to include hints of drowley. yes, crowley is negging dean. it's not working out for him.
Sam must not be entirely lucid yet because next he knows, he’s standing in the doorway of Dean’s bedroom by himself. It looks just like Dean left it. The bed is not quite made, the closet door cracked open. Dean’s guns hang on the wall, his books lining the shelves.
“Mom,” Dean says, putting his hand over hers. “Have you been drinking?”
the one in the wrong by cornering him like this in his office. It would’ve been better if Cas just thought he was being creepy.
“Sure.”
“Hm?”
Sam clears his throat. “Dean. I, uh, I think we need to talk about this.”
“Do you remember when we talked about poetry?”
“Am I interrupting something?”
“Don’t listen to him, Em,” Dean tells his daughter, taking her unoccupied hand and kissing it. “You’re the cutest little girl in the world.”
“That-” Dean choked on his words as Cas grabbed him between the legs, squeezing almost painfully tight before letting go. “That might take more than one session.”
“As you wish, sir,” Castiel says instead, finally handing over the coffee.
He still hasn’t contacted Sam but, y’know, baby steps.
"What do you want from me, Dean?" Cas asks. "Do you want me to feel guilty about taking a vessel? Because I already do."
“What’s-” his mouth was dry as a desert, so he wetted his lips, stomach flipping again when Cas’ eyes dropped to follow the movement of his tongue, “What’s with the name, anyway?”
Cas raises his hand. He's holding a book entitled
"Is that for a class?" Dean asks.
"I'm fine," Dean cuts her off angrily.
“But your father is dead,” Cas says, as if Dean needs the reminder. “Surely that must change things.”
Cas seemed to catch himself. “I believe you are the cowboy in this scenario.”
Castiel doesn’t move from his prone position in the bed but he groans. “Just leave it on the floor.”
Cas doesn’t bring it up. Once he’s done showering he comes back to the kitchen but all he does is ask Dean how many eggs there are left. Dean isn’t sure what that means so he answers like nothing happened.
“I understand that inviting exes to these kind of functions can be a social faux pas, especially given that our relationship is still relatively new,” Cas continued, completely oblivious to Dean having a minor meltdown not two feet from him. “But Daphne is someone important to me and it’s not as if there’s any danger of us getting back together.”
“Besides whoever sold them to you, you mean?”
Dean presses a kiss against Cas’ chest. “I know you’re not. If you were, you would have said yes as soon as I offered to help you with your rut. Hell, you wouldn’t have even waited for me to offer.”
How anticlimactic.
Then.
The little hypocrite is fine with the bus, so Dean resigns himself to public transport for the next while. Dealing with dirty looks from his fellow passengers as Emma cries her head off is easier than the alternative. At least it’s regular crying, not those demonic shrieks she makes in the car.
“Okay,” Dean says, knowing full well he’s not gonna be able to.
“Fuck,” Dean breathed. “We’re really doing this?”
An hour later, the apartment looked passably tidy and Dean himself was clean as a whistle. Feeling fired up by his small bout of productivity, Dean booted up the computer and logged onto Facebook.
The vamp charges him again but it’s head is lopped off before it reaches him. It’s just Sam and Dean standing now, and Dean is only on his feet by the grace of whatever pierced through him. It’s keeping him pinned, keeping him upright and in devastating pain, and oh.
Dean stares at her blankly for a moment. “Me,” he finally answers. “My - uh, my husband is working late.”
The one other thing hanging over Dean’s head is his last conversation with Cas. He’s not sure their friendship can be salvaged but he at least owes Cas an apology and an explanation. Android or no, it’s obvious that Dean hurt his feelings.
“You okay?” Dean can’t help asking. “You sure you don’t need-”
“Dean?” Cas’ hand was gone now. “Is it okay?”
“I’ll be there,” Castiel says, not even stopping to consider. He regrets it in the next moment, realizing how eager his quick response might come off, but Dean’s smiling at him and that takes away some of the worry. “The costumes aren’t mandatory, are they?”
Which, y’know, is at least a change of pace.
“Sure thing,” Dean drawls. “So, you like fruity drinks? Shocker.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says, and
“Turn the music down,” Castiel says, his tone as polite as he can manage under the circumstances.
but they smooth over soon enough. Cas is easy to talk to and being around him makes Dean feel comfortable in a way he can’t quite define.
Mom reached around his shoulders, pulling him into a hug. Dean hugged her back, relaxing into her arms and feeling for a moment like that twelve-year-old kid who’d come home after school to find out Dad had bailed on them. Mom had hugged him like that, then, and Dean had known instantly that he’d never have to worry about her leaving.
Then he realized that he’d been caught staring and he turned his head away, cheeks flushing in embarrassment. He took another sip of his beer, more for something to do than because he actually wanted to. He surely couldn’t keep up his surveillance now, they’d be watching to see if he looked their way again.
Dean pulls over. It’s far too sudden, probably leaving tire tracks in the concrete, and the driver behind them honks his horn loudly as he passes. Dean ignores him, taking a deep breath as he finally turns to face Cas.
say that again!”
The word feels awkward coming out of his mouth. No matter how many times he says it, it always feels like a pose.
Dean’s jaw goes slack. “Wh- ten
ok i lied this fic will be four parts not three
“About last time,” Dean elaborates. “That was… I’m not usually rude to service workers.”
Sam lets out a weak laugh, recognizing his own words used against him. She has no way of knowing, of course, but doesn’t that mean something? That what he was asking of Dean, is now being asked of himself.
“And to the Winchesters,” Eileen adds, clinking her bottle against Cas’ as he nods in agreement.
“You too, man,” Sam said.
“That’s not necessary,” he says. “I’ve got everything I want right here.”
“Have you told him that you want to make up?”
Castiel glanced back at his door, as if he needed to make sure. “Oh. Yes, yes I am.”
Cas was silent for a scarily long time. Dean finally risked a glance up, but it did him no good. Cas’ eyebrows were knitted together, his lips turned down in a slight, thoughtful frown, and Dean had no idea what that expression even meant.
He spears his tongue, penetrating Dean with it. Dean’s fingers tighten against his scalp, tugging, impatient and breathy noises falling from his lips. Castiel keeps fucking Dean with his tongue, traces his hand against Dean’s side, reaching a nipple and pinching it in warning. If Dean wants something, he needs to ask and not push.
Dean glances into the living room, where Sam's sitting on the couch doing his homework, then moves into the bathroom, shutting the door firmly and locking it. "Hello to you to, asshole."
Cas went, stumbling a little as the effort of fucking Dean so hard had apparently turned his legs to jell-o (
“No!” Dean cut in, grabbing the front of Cas’ shirt as he made to pull away. “No, I haven’t. We just… never made it official,” he finished lamely. So not only was he a girl, but a teenage girl as well. Great.
Dean has always felt bad for the hookers who bond with their johns. He’s seen it happen a few times and it usually ends messy. The kind of people who pay for sex aren’t generally the ones you want as soulmates. As fond as Dean is of some of his clients, he wouldn’t wanna get stuck with any of them.
Neither one of them says anything, but by the time they’re done with the chores and collapse on the couch in front of the TV it’s clear that he’s not going home to sleep. It’s not the first time he’s staying the night, or even the fiftieth - it’s become something of a habit since Dean got Emma. The guest room is basically Cas’ room by now.
If Dean were talking this way about a woman, he knows Sam would’ve shut him down by now. Hell, he probably would’ve stopped him ten minutes ago, when he was still rhapsodizing about Cas’ arms. Poor kid’s just too worried about being insensitive.
He walks off and Dean feels a little bad for teasing but not enough to actually go and apologize.
It’s good and Dean is so fucking relieved he wants to cry. The chaos in his head clears, the mess of Michael and Jimmy Novak and a body that’s still his but
The sudden change in topics has Dean reeling.
Perhaps he’d gone a step too far with the implied threat but Castiel couldn’t bring himself to regret it when Dean’s smug smirk dropped.
“Sometimes,” Dean says. “Why?”
Dean’s jaw snapped close with an audible click. “Ticklish,” he managed.
It took a moment for Cas’ words to register.
“If you want, you can practice on me.”
As the sting faded and Dean got used to the stretch, he started moving faster, soon enough bouncing in Cas’ lap. Cas was meeting him thrust for thrust, grabbing Dean’s hips tightly and grinding his cock up inside Dean. Dean couldn’t hold back the breathy, punched-out gasps tumbling past his lips, couldn’t even find it in himself to
She left with a small wave, which Dean absentmindedly responded to. He went back to eating his burger, and it took him a full minute to process what had just happened.
“I’m serious, man, you should’ve seen him. He could crush a watermelon between those thighs.”
“I’m sorry,” he says. “I shouldn’t have left the way I did on Friday, that was exceedingly rude of me.”
Dean nods. Then he turns towards the portal. Even just the feeling it emanates is repulsive and Dean has to fight every instinct to walk towards it.
“Are you alright?”
Castiel gives Dean an unimpressed look as he approaches, clearly remembering him as well. “How may I help you?”
. What the hell do you know? You're the one who's been avoiding him.
- shoulders. “And it was the least romantic proposal of all time, you should’ve heard him.”
But now he was on the border of freaking out.
“It would... just be for practice?” Cas asks.
Dean gets inside, walking past the line by the counter and getting some angry grumbles from the lady up front.
"You mind grabbing some dinner while we close?" Dean asks Sam. "There's a pizza place on the corner."
“Not by a long shot,” Dean agrees.
“I’m not done.”
“I’d love to,” Mom cut him off. “Any special occasion?”
“You should call your brother,” Cas says.
“That’s an apt description as well.”
"Hey," Sam says, voice miraculously even.
“I took the morning off,” Castiel says. “I may have overworked myself slightly last night. I’ve had some difficulties writing lately and I was working through them with my advisor.”
Dean raises his machete, glances behind him to make sure the kids get out, and then the vamps are on them before they can blink. It’s a quick fight, brutal, and Dean knows just two years ago he would’ve loved this. The exhilaration of it, the purity of life-and-death, kill-or-be-killed. Some part of him still sings at it, his blood rushing past his ears, but the bigger part of him is focused on the kids, did they get out,
No messages from Cas. There were a couple of Charlie, apologizing for abandoning her post the night before, and Dean quickly fired off a ‘
"None of your business," Dean says defensively. "What are
“I would be fine with it, because I trust you!”
“…No,” Cas lies, unconvincingly.
This time, Cas was looking at him, a lazy smile playing on his lips. “I enjoyed that very much.”
“It’s unlocked,” comes Castiel’s voice from inside. He sounds
Right. They’re doing this.
“Happy birthday, babe,” Dean muttered, kissing his cheek, like he hadn’t already wished Cas a happy birthday this morning when he woke him up with a blowjob.
(She’d been interested, for the record, but deeply insecure about her braces. God, Dean misses it when the biggest obstacle in his love life was a piece of dental hardware.)
No, Lisa had a kid. She’d been very upfront about it right from the start that being with her also meant being there for Ben. And Dean had been crazy about her, and about Ben, so he hadn’t thought twice at first.
Dean squirmed in his seat, feeling warmth rising to his face. “I mean… I might not be. Entirely straight.”
“Book?” he says instead.
“Did you know Cain?”
“Like the one Gabriel trapped you in, yes,” Cas says, with the weary air of someone repeating themselves for the fiftieth time. Or thirty-second, as the case may be. “It wasn’t targeted at us. A witch cast a powerful spell in order to prevent her soulmate from dying, with the assistance of the cherub who brought them together.”
"How is your English essay coming along?" Jimmy asks.
Jack nods. “Like Castiel. I didn’t think-” he breaks off, and his demeanor shifts. Suddenly, he’s not this zen dude anymore. He looks frustrated, almost childlike, and Dean is abruptly reminded of his actual age. “I was eager to put things into their rightful place. I just wanted to allow the universe to move on unfettered, wanted to make sure that I didn’t steer things one way or another. Free will is important, you taught me that.”
Cas leaned against the doorframe as Dean shrugged on his jacket, smiling contently. As Dean got ready to leave, he slipped a piece of paper into Dean’s pocket.
Even though he’s sitting down, Castiel can’t help but feel wary as he enters the office and approaches Crowley, like a prey animal circling a predator.
"Dig up the bones, salt them, and light them on fire."
Dean sighs. Cas probably
looking at them.”
Dean blinked. “Um. Wow. Not what I’m here for, but… good to know?”
“Two,” Dean says, because it’s very important to him that Cas remember that. Once is an accident. Twice is a pattern. “You had two moments. You kissed me twice.”
“I asked if you’re alright,” Castiel repeats. Those android-blue eyes are wide and sympathetic.
fuck me, alpha. I need your cock, need you to fill me up good and-”
Shockingly enough, Dean keeps his word and only buys Sam two bottles of some local brew. By the time Sam heads off to Maggie Barton's house, he's wishing Dean had ignored him. His stomach is twisting itself into knots at the thought of Maggie Barton and her soft-looking hair and her coconut smell. He could use something to calm his nerves.
Cas shifted on top of him, his half-hard cock poking at Dean’s hip.
Novak seems to realize that this line of questioning won’t get him anywhere. “Why were you out?”
Dean feels like he’s in free fall, head swimming at the hot twist of Cas’ tongue, stomach swooping when Cas pulls away to take a shuddering breath and then trails his lips down Dean’s neck, licking, biting.
“Waiting for your soulmate?” Dean guesses. Castiel nods curtly, still not looking his way. “That’s… sweet?”
“Do we know who filed the complaint?”
Dean shakes his head. “It wasn’t anything personal. I was just having a really bad day. You didn’t deserve to have your head bitten off for asking a question.”
Jack grimaces apologetically. Then he’s waving his hand, and with a motion a hole opens mid-air, dark and slimy-looking.
That’s a possibility but Dean still doesn’t like that he left without letting them know. Cas has been better lately about checking in and not leaving without so much as saying goodbye. He’d been planning on going back to the bunker with them. Dean was gonna take him out to play pool and he’d been excited about it.
Dean scoffs, unamused.
Dean frowns at his lunch, not quite feeling up to looking Jimmy in the eye while he lies. "Fine."
Cas grabs his arm, steadying them both. "Where's the fire?"
It’s nearing midnight when Dean decides to call it quits and gets up. Keith moves to follow, and alarm bells go off in Dean’s head.
“You’ve got it.”
They’re getting to their feet just as the doors bust open, as Sam enters with his shotgun raised, Eileen just behind with her glock. They pause at the doorway, expressions stunned, and Dean finds himself grinning.
“I can’t go myself,” Jack explains. “But I can place someone else there. And the Empty won’t hold any control over a human soul. It will want to expel you on instinct. You should be able to fight against it long enough to get to Cas.”
Dean thought he was giving off some pretty clear ‘leave-me-alone’ vibes, sitting kind of hunched over his plate in a corner booth, but half-way through his meal someone walked up to him.
it in some miraculous way. Dean bit down on his lips as he came without even a hand on his dick, pleasure washing through his body in waves.
Dean is relieved to fall back into the same routine with Cas. Things are a little awkward his first couple of visits to
Their sweep of the crime-scene is quick. The case is almost too easily solved. They’ve got all the pieces laid out for them already, from the murder method to the sketches of the monsters left on the scene to the notes in Dad’s journal about a similar case in the 80s. Maybe they’ve just been tangling with God-level threats for too long but Dean almost feels cheated.
He kept jerking the part of Cas’ dick he couldn’t quite wrap his lips around, the other hand reaching between Cas’ legs to play with his balls. Dean felt them twitch in his grip, heard Cas gasp breathlessly, and that was all the warning before Cas was coming, seed spurting from his dick and into Dean’s mouth. Dean swallowed on instinct, the bitter taste overwhelming his taste buds.
Somehow, it feels like Cas heard it anyway.
He steeled himself.

“Mhm,” Emma hums without looking up from the coloring book.
He goes back to his apartment and begins to do what he can to salvage his painting.
He dreams of dark library corridors that grow longer with every step he takes. Something reaches from out of the darkness and swallows him up, and he wakes up sweating.
“Why not?”
Once more unto the breach, indeed.
, he sounds wrecked. “
Of course, just as soon as Dean had that thought, he stepped into the hall and nearly rammed into her.
Dean clears his throat. “Couldn’t sleep?”
Dean’s stomach flipped (the stupid thing had been doing that all night. Had he had anything weird to eat?), as he desperately wracked his brain for something to say.
Dean swallows. “Well. We’d rather have you here than anywhere else.”
“That was a one time thing,” Dean mutters.
Cas hummed, clearly pleased. He kept pumping his fingers inside Dean, occasionally brushing past that spot inside him that made his nerves sing. Dean lost himself so completely in the sensation he didn’t even notice Cas had added another finger until there were four inside him, stretching him wide.
"You know I only worry because I care about you."
“I guess I’ll… see you tomorrow?” Dean said.
He opens his mouth, panics as he realizes he has no idea what to start with, and ends up blurting out, “My dad died.”
“O-oh.”
Dean’s jaw snapped shut. This wasn’t going the way he’d wanted. He wasn’t sure what he’d expected from Charlie, but some part of him had been hoping she’d have a totally innocent explanation for why he’d turned down Jamie that he just hadn’t thought of himself.
“I suppose I am the exception,” Castiel says dryly.
Since the wedding and the move, Dean hasn’t left the apartment much. His friends and family are all a hundred miles away, he works from home, and Novak has his maid take care of the grocery shopping and other errands. Novak is always gone in the morning when Dean wakes up and he’s usually not back until shortly before they go to bed in their separate rooms.
"Dead?" Jimmy repeats incredulously. "What are you talking about, Dean?"
Dean is in the backseat.
Dean hangs up and turns to Sam, who braces himself for the orders to pack his bags.
Screw butterflies, Dean’s stomach was filled with a whole damn zoo. He couldn’t even remember why he’d wanted to keep this a secret in the first place, other than his constant need to self-sabotage.
being filled and fucked the way he wanted, the near painful slam of Cas’ hips against his echoing his earlier spanking.
Way too soon, they were down to their underwear. Dean’s head was swimming and he felt disoriented, almost lost. Cas had somehow taken complete control of the proceedings and if Dean hadn’t been trying to prove something, he wasn’t even sure he would have minded. Especially not when Cas’ lips started kissing a trail down the column of Dean’s neck, down to his chest, until his mouth latched onto a nipple.
Happy holidays! I'm not 100% pleased with how some sections of this chapter turned out but I've edited and rewritten them to death and I wanted to get this out on time. Hopefully it's still a decent read.
Dean nods absentmindedly. Then he pauses as he realizes the full meaning of Cas’ words. “Wait, so have you never really seen grass?”
He reaches into his pocket, pulling out his wallet and plucking out a business card, which he hands to Dean. It reads, ‘Castiel Novak, development director’. Where, it doesn’t say, but it confirms what Dean already knew. Castiel is way too good for him.
Dean has prevented a fair few apocalypses in his day. A simple salt and burn should be a cakewalk for him but maybe it’s that overconfidence that got him where he is now, pinned by the throat against the wall of a mausoleum, slowly losing consciousness.
Cas gave him another quick slap on the ass, and then he was gone. Dean stayed bent over the table, feeling a little ridiculous being in the position by himself. He glanced backwards, making sure the blinds were pulled shut and that he wasn’t inadvertently giving the neighbors a show.
He gets up at eight. The first thing he did, the first day they were back in the bunker after everything went down, was set his alarm clock. Dean needs this bit of structure, needs something that will get him out of bed feeling semi-normal every morning. Miracle helps, rushing in every morning at the sound of the alarm, and yeah, Dean had been as surprised as anyone to find himself attached to a dog, but it can’t be helped. The mutt is just too lovable.
Cas shoots him a glare. “I’m going to wait in the car.”
Some animal sound escaped Dean’s lips, heat running through him like lightning and pooling low in his gut. Cas’ tongue felt so
Luckily, Charlie was both free and close by so fifteen minutes later she was sitting down in Dean’s booth. She wasn’t the best at keeping secrets, so Dean had planned on just telling her the necessary details, but somewhere in the process the whole story spilled out of him like so much word vomit.
Castiel averts his eyes, embarrassment settling in now that he’s not directly in front of Dean’s infuriating face. He knows better than this, or he did before he met Dean. “That was my neighbor.”
Drawing a deep breath, Dean leaned forward and took the head of Cas’ dick in his mouth. It was warm and weirdly spongy, and the taste of precum was bitter on Dean’s tongue. It didn’t taste that different from Dean’s own come, which
It’s not a first kiss. It isn’t tentative, or curious, or impatient and passionate. It’s a routine kiss, the kind you give a partner you’ve been with for a while, brief but assured and loving.
"Believe it or not, I'm capable of human emotions," Meg says. "I can get worried too, okay?"
Then he’s kissing Dean again, and the conversation is officially over.
it's done!!!!
When Jody invites them to dinner about a week later, they still haven’t told anyone. Sam and Eileen will be there as well as Jack and the girls - it’s a regular family reunion and the perfect chance to announce the big news to everyone.
. You're dead but you're still here, and it's
It’s maybe not the smartest thing he’s ever done, going alone to a strange bar in a neighborhood he doesn’t yet know,  but it’s either that or ask Novak for help. And like
, voice even deeper and rougher than normal, and Dean feels himself growing slick.
“That’s it, sweetheart,” Dean encouraged, slowly jacking his hand down Cas’ cock, keeping his grip just loose enough to be teasing. “Get me wet, so eager for it-”
Dean hasn’t slept through the night since Michael left. He keeps waking up in cold sweat, his muscles twitching with the memory of actions Dean had no control over.
“Well, I’m sure you’re itching to get out of here,” he says, shooting Cas a half-hearted smile that he doesn’t see because he’s once again looking anywhere but at Dean. “Let’s hit the road.”
“Well, they work very well. You’ve always smelled like an alpha to me.”
this many teenagers in Milliken.
Dean bit his lip, inching closer to the half-open door. He wasn’t usually the kind of guy who spied on his girlfriends, but Daphne had been acting distant all evening. It had been more than ten minutes since she’d left for the bathroom, dinner untouched on her plate. So sue him, he was worried.
It’s early Saturday afternoon but the slight drizzle keeps most people away. Dean has Emma strapped to his chest, shielding her from the rain with an umbrella, but he gets the feeling she wouldn’t notice it anyway. Their first stop is one of the monkey cages and Emma is captivated, shrieking with laughter and babbling cheerful nonsense at the unimpressed looking monkeys.
“You wanna keep seeing me exclusively?” he repeated, feeling like a massive girl. But fuck it, if being a massive girl would keep him from stewing in uncertainties and doubt, then slap a bow on him and call him Deanna.
Dean swallows. “It was just a kiss,” he says weakly.
Dean nods. “Yeah.” He raises his hand, trying as surreptitiously as he can to wipe his eyes. Damn dusty office. “Rocky’s wouldn’t exist without him, y’know? I built it with the money he left me. Wish he’d been alive to see it.”
He dives down, shoving Dean’s robes aside. He’s naked underneath, miles of pale skin slick with sweat and flushed a pretty pink. His cock is hard, straining against his stomach, and underneath…
He loses himself in the rhythm of the run for a while and the gorgeous scenery around him. He rarely goes on these longer runs outside of summer vacation and it’s a luxury just to be able to take his time and think of nothing but putting one foot in front of the next.
"You're not even twenty-one yet," Sam reminds him.
It takes Dean a moment to understand what Castiel said. “I don’t?”
Cas pulls his hand back from his chest and something follows, something blindingly bright. Dean has to look away but he can’t escape because then it starts
“Whatever you say, Cassie.”
They get to the other side unscathed and there the kids are, locked up like a couple of animals in a kennel. Dean feels a rush of fury at seeing them like this but quickly smothers it for the sake of looking reassuring. They grab the kids, tell them to follow closely.
ghost."
Dean straightened, putting his beer back down on the counter with a hard thud. “What now?”
Two of Cas’ fingers pressed against his lips, shutting him up. Cas raised his head, giving Dean a challenging look, and Dean returned it as he wrapped his lips around the fingers. It kept him from talking and he was pretty sure what Cas wanted those fingers wet for, but he could also use them to put on a show. Dean ran his tongue over the pads of Cas’ fingers, peering at Cas from below his eyelashes as he sucked, pleased when he saw Cas’ eyes fixed on his lips.
“Well, I am only six months old.”
Dean swallows back the ‘what if I can’t’. That’s not an option now, not with his goal so close within reach. Just one more thing left.
“Nah,” Mom said. “Well, kickboxing class, but I’m fine with taking a break.”
“Then let me help.”
"Don't be like that, baby." Cas' voice sounds tinny through the phone, uncomfortably distant, but Dean can still picture him with perfect clarity: leaning on his elbows against the counter in his bookstore, joint hanging out of the corner of his mouth, hair probably a mess. He's also
“We could have flowers, if you want,” he mutters.
But they were just practicing, Dean reminds himself. If they’d gone any further, it wouldn’t have been practice anymore. At least not anything Cas could put to practical use the next time he hooks up with a chick.
They went sprawling to the floor, landing on the carpet with a soft thud.
“Just leave,” he repeats.
“Bullshit,” Dean blurted. “You were
“Oh, it’s Cas now, is it?”
Jack pulls back and his eyes are shining. “Take good care of each other until you get back here, will you? And say hello to Cas and Sam for me.”
And two, he wasn’t straight.
“Hey,” Dean clears his throat, “uh, hey man. Funny running into you here.”
“I had gathered as much.” Cas crossed his arms. He looked more uncomfortable than anything and Dean wasn’t sure if he should take that as a positive sign or not. “It is a remarkable coincidence that we should happen to date the same woman.”
Castiel let out a pained noise. “Please don’t.”
so good, so eager for it,
"A ghost - what are you -" Jimmy’s voice is like static and then he's flickering like a flame about to go out. "Dean-"
He’d had sex with another guy, let him fuck him up the ass. And he’d
Dean drew in a deep breath. “We used to date.”
“Answer,” he told Sam. “I gotta hit the head.”
Sam is quicker on the uptake. “We were stuck in a time loop? Like-”
Dean groaned. “I’m gonna kill my mother.”
“Good.” Cas drew a deep breath. His eyes were fixed on Dean’s, wide and serious. “And Dean?”
Dean should discourage him - like this whole thing isn’t middle school enough, now Cas is gonna give him a goddamn hickey - but he just tilts his head back, gives Cas more room to work. Cas presses a kiss against his Adam’s apple and then licks the dip of his clavicle, slow and hot like he’s savoring the taste of Dean’s skin.
“And you’re still together?”
At first, he was sure that it wouldn’t be enough, that Cas would make him say it again, and part of him even hoped he would. But Cas took mercy on him, twisting his fingers inside Dean one more time to make sure he was loose enough, before pulling out.
“Look, man,” Dean says, “I’m not an expert on this stuff but you might be thinking too hard about it. Just… ignore whatever you cousin said or that voice inside your head that says you should have a soulmate by now. Try to focus on what you want.”
Dean couldn’t help himself; he started moving his own hips against the mattress, seeking friction, and began sucking in earnest, tongue moving around the head of Cas’ cock and down the shaft, moaning encouragingly. Cas’ hand shot down, fingers tangling in Dean’s hair but not pushing, just letting them rest there, digging into Dean’s scalp whenever he ran his tongue over the slit of Cas’ dick.
It’s cracked open and Dean can see Cas inside, sitting at his desk, head bent over a stack of papers that he’s attacking with a red pen. Dean stops in the doorway, softly rapping his knuckles on the door.
Cas sat back down on the bed next to him, a little too close for comfort. “Me neither,” he told Dean. “As a matter of fact, you’re the first person I’ve slept with since I broke it off with my fiancée.”
Meg just laughs again at Castiel’s withering glare, but she drops the subject after that and they move onto more pleasant topics.
Novak’s friends – Castiel’s friends, Dean might as well start using his first name now that they’re hanging out –
After a brief pause, Jimmy nods again.
“Not a problem,” he replies with a breathy laugh. “Seriously, anytime. I didn’t know it could be this… intense.”
), and they’re all identical to Castiel but none of them are him. They don’t ask uncomfortably personal questions or give any indication that Dean is different from any other customer.
Cas’ hands loosened their grip on Dean’s shoulder and hips and then he was straightening and pulling out of him, dick already softening. Dean didn’t have much time to get disappointed, however, because then Cas was grabbing his cheeks, spreading them and licking over Dean’s hole.
“Bobby and I are about to head home,” she tells him. “Just wanted to say goodbye.”
“Dean,” Cas greets him warmly, cup of coffee already ready on the counter. “I have something to show you.”
“It isn’t that I don’t want to see other places,” Cas says. “But I’ve never stepped a foot outside this building. I wouldn’t know how to do it.”
Dean crosses his arms, leaning back in his chair. “How is that any of your business?”
. It was such a juvenile term but Dean felt like a giddy teenager right now, anyway. “Oh, I’m full."
“You don’t have to worry about that,” Novak tells him curtly. “I have no desire to touch you, much less lay with you.”
“I don’t blame her.” Cas shifted, his expression turning solemn, eyes cast down. “I won’t lie Dean, I was upset.”
He flips through them, one by one, face growing warmer as he takes each photograph in. They’re so much filthier than Dean remembered. His young self looks so shameless, basking in the attention of the camera,
Dean puts down the crate of beer bottles he’s been hauling from the back. “Can you put those away in the fridge? And what do you mean, ‘couldn’t go through with it’?”
Cas looked back up at him. He was smiling, and Dean somehow felt both insulted and incredibly relieved. “Do you have a better word for it?”
It's no less violent than the previous blow, no less painful, and Dean answers it with all the fervor and anger he can muster, biting furiously at Cas's lips hard enough to draw blood.
“Your father didn’t die?”
They didn’t reserve a table because, duh, this was the Roadhouse. It was never full.
They keep talking as if it didn’t happen. For
“Yeah, in a couple of minutes. Just gonna finish this page first.”
Meg looked like she wanted to protest, but Charlie paled and grabbed her hand, dragging her out into the hallway. Once they were past the threshold, she turned to Dean.
The bar tonight is one they haven’t been to in a few months. It’s not too far away from Castiel’s apartment, small and sparsely decorated, but the atmosphere is cozy and the drinks are cheap.
There was another scary pause. Then, “Of course, sweetie.”
It's starting to snow.
Things change again after that. Now it’s like Cas can’t
looked in those shorts, lemme tell you-”
Emma’s new teacher walks up to him. “This is nothing unusual,” she says, gesturing at Cas’ retreating back. “But Emma is adjusting remarkably well.”
Dean’s lips twitched. Only his dork of a boyfriend could fuck someone over the table after a family dinner and call it ‘nice’. No wonder he loved him.
Cas stares off to the side for a while. Dean watches him silently, waiting for the answer. He’s not gonna let Cas get away with not talking here; he can do this all night if he needs to.
Seems he was the one misunderstanding things all along.
“Cool.” Dean nodded to himself. “Okay, see you then.”
Cas lowers his hand again. His hooded eyes trace Dean's facial features, sending another burst of chills through Dean. He can't explain what it is, but there's something almost eerie about the way Cas is looking at him. Maybe it's his eyes. They look empty.
Cas was easy to talk to. It’s clear from their one conversation that he has a tendency to rant but everything he had to say was interesting. And it wasn’t one-sided; when Dean spoke, he listened. He heard Dean’s explanation of why his biggest dream had always been to open a gay bar, and he
Dean snorted. “It’s one bottle.”
The voice is right next to Dean’s ear and he flinches back, turning around to find the barista standing not two feet away, holding Dean’s coffee. He’s identical to Steve but according to the name tag, this one is called ‘Castiel’.
Castiel straightens, jaw clenching when he realizes that the music is coming from the apartment next to his. He throws the paintbrush on the palette, storming out of his apartment and across the hall. He rings the bell a few times, knocking for good measure.
“You like that?” Dean murmured into Cas’ ear, pumping his hand and twisting it at the top in a way he knew felt amazing. “Let me hear, baby.”
“Here,” Sam said, dropping a bottle of wine in Dean’s hand. “Now, where are you hiding him?”
The bell chimes as he exits, much too loud in the otherwise quiet space.
It’s May 3.
Dean snorted. If only it were that simple. “Why would I be?”
“Yes, I’m-” Cas clears his throat and Dean pretends not to notice when he wipes away a tear. “I’m fine.”
That much, Dean couldn’t protest. “Hell, yeah! You’re the hottest piece of ass I’ve ever landed.”
“Dean,” another bartender, a blonde Castiel is just now noticing, hisses. “Play nice with the customers, remember? You know Adler’s looking for reasons to fire you.”
“Yes, you did.”
Dean’s brain grinds to a halt. “What?”
Sam nods, feeling a little unsettled by the whole situation. He can't even put his finger on why. Maybe it's just Dean losing track of time like that, at a bookstore of all places. Whatever it is, Sam can't shake the feeling that he was interrupting something, and he's grateful Dean asked him to leave.
“As soon as- put me-” Dean holds up his hand. “Hang on one fucking second. I can go into the Empty?”
The Roadhouse wasn’t exactly a romantic spot but it was the place where they’d first met through some ill-advised stalking, nosy friends and a lot of liquid courage. Besides, it was their first anniversary, and Dean wanted something special, not some generically romantic restaurant.
“We weren’t a great match but that was okay, we were both on the rebound and just needed some company. Daphne was still totally hung up on you. Not that I can blame her,” Dean added, giving Cas a faint smile. Cas just gave him an unamused look in return.
“Wow,” he mutters.
“Where were you?” Cas asked, showing nothing but mild curiosity.
“How do I look?” he asked Cas, nervously running his fingers through his hair, which had to be a mess by now.
“Yeah?” Dean couldn’t hold back his smile if he tried. “They liked you, too.”
The hands stay. “Dean, you need help. You’re bleeding.”
“Sure,” Dean said, taking a bite of his slice. “Why?”
“And bring back Cas.”
Dean threw his head back on the pillow with a groan. “You can fuck me, but only if you promise never to call it that again.”
What. The.
“I don’t mind waiting.” Cas took a sip of his beer, shooting Dean a warm smile. “I’m in good company.”
“Except Dr. Sexy,” Dean allowed, because he was way past the point of denying that one. “Anyway, this thing with Cas is just… temporary insanity or something.”
“Well, maybe I was wrong.”
“Just not used waking up in beds that aren’t mine,” Dean lied, and pretty shamelessly. Before Lisa, his whole sex life had revolved around one-night stands.
“That’s it.”
They talk for a long while about nothing much. Dean gets himself another beer, then Keith offers to buy another round, smiling and waving it off when Dean reminds him that he’s married. It’s nice, just talking to another person, even if Keith is giving off slight douchebag vibes and isn’t otherwise all that interesting.
Sam opens one eye. “No. He’s gone?”
“I’m going out with some friends on Friday night. You’re welcome to join us if you’d like.”
“I was taking care of something,” Cas answers without looking at him.
Castiel brightened. Then he was smiling again, no uncertainty or hesitation in his expression, and for a moment Dean forgot to breathe. “What would you like?”
“Are you saying I’m not strong?”
They’re winning, have beheaded most of the vamps, when one of them tackles Dean against a wooden beam. Something stings sharply and at first Dean thinks the breath has just been knocked out of him but then
The guy who meets him in the lobby is handsome. Enough so that Dean wonders just what he needs a hooker for; he’s got a potent combination of pretty blue eyes, artfully mussed hair, full lips and a strong jawline.
“Do you want to?” he asks Cas.
Dean looks up, amused when he catches Cas’ deer-in-the-headlights look.
Despite his protests, Dean couldn’t stop smiling. Cas had forgiven him.
“Well.” Dean ducks his head, suddenly feeling coy. “I jump-started it. Or I guess, Jack did, technically. I just… woke you up.”
“That doesn’t mean I am the same as a six-month-old human,” Cas says, as if he can tell what Dean is thinking. “My programming holds extensive knowledge on a number of topics, including human behavior. I probably know more about it than you do.”
, how may I help you?”
