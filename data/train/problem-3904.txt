“He.  Was.  Drugged,” Dean said simply, and stalked off to his room.
this hotel room?”  Then he had grinned and added, “And you never know, it may be our last night on Earth… we
But he was so much more than that.
“Hey-o!” Dean said as Mandy walked away.
A few minutes into the movie, Dean stretched his arm across the back of Castiel’s neck, and Castiel relaxed into him.  Castiel noticed two other couples in the movie theatre doing the same thing, and realized that Dean was making an effort to show him public affection.  It made him smile.
said Castiel.
Even when Castiel went MIA when he was possessed by Lucifer, it had been less than a month before Dean had found out what had really happened.
Castiel sighed again.  “Dean, when I raised you from Hell, and we formed our bond… it was unsafe for anyone to know about it,
Dean put his hand on Castiel’s, steadying him.  “We’ll find him, Cas.  This time we’ll finish him, for good.”
“I was angry with you, but… I got past it,” Dean said.  “I know you did what you thought you had to.”
Sam nodded, still not meeting Castiel’s eyes.
The angel sat up to look at him with shock, followed immediately by steely determination.  “Dean, it would take a lot more than Lucifer to get between
“I suppose so,” Castiel agreed.  “The urges… surprised me at first, but now I’m used to it.  It’s a constant annoyance, isn’t it?”
“But when the Empty allowed me leave, I would never have been able to find my way back here if it weren’t for our bond.”
Castiel appreciated the sentiment, but it didn’t make him feel better.  They had worked so hard to trap Lucifer, and yet now it was for nothing thanks to him.  And besides…
Obviously, that hadn’t worked.  Now, Crowley was desperate to do whatever was necessary to get rid of Lucifer.  He also knew the spell to close the rift in space and time.  It was one of the few memorable times where his and Dean’s interests were aligned.
In the end, it was Crowley that saved Sam.  Dean had made a deal with the King of Hell; his freedom for his help.  Castiel watched, in Sam’s head, as Crowley convinced Sam that he was being possessed and together they fought to expel the angel, whose name was actually Gadreel.  For all that Gadreel had done, he
let Dagon take her.
“Something on your mind?” Dean asked.  It would’ve been laughable if he wasn’t so suspicious.
Then Lucifer disappeared.  Dean’s door still did not reappear.
The next morning, Sam and Dean were researching the British Men of Letters when Castiel walked into the kitchen.
“About you two.  And Purgatory, and all.”
Apparently, this wasn’t quite like on TV.  Castiel was glad to keep the tape, though.  It meant more to him than Dean knew.
“Kinda, yeah.  Only, Heaven wasn’t ready for Charlie, and Ash of course.  Cas worked together with them to make it so we can video-chat anybody else up here, any time we want.”
Castiel hadn’t intended on this escalating to sexual intercourse, but he also wasn’t complaining.  His vessel was already hard, and felt neglected.  Castiel dove for the lube in the bedside table.
“Cas, I don't like how the whole Billie thing went down.  Okay?” said Dean.  “I know you think you were doing the right thing.  And I'm not mad.  I'm worried.  Because things like ‘cosmic consequences’ have a habit of biting us in the ass.”
Suddenly Dean had a horrible thought.  “If the ultrasound was wrong, you’re not gonna call the baby ‘Deanna’ are you?”
“Wait, Cas, Cas!” Dean shouted.  “If you want to play cowboys and bloodsuckers, that's fine. But you're gonna stick with us, okay?  None of this zapping around crap.  Capiche?”
“I’m listening,” said Castiel stoically.
,” Dean insisted.  “You can’t say that to me.  Not now.  We’ll find Rowena, Cas, and make her undo this spell.”  He tried to move closer, but Castiel shook his head.
“Irritable much, Cas?” Dean snapped when Castiel picked up the phone later.  “You and Little Nicky didn’t even stay in town long enough for a complementary blow job.”
situation, right?” asked Sam.  “You left that night because angels were on your ass.”
“No!” Dean said, leaping backwards.  Castiel frowned at him, moving toward him again to seek what he so desperately needed.
In mid-August, Sam left to chase a lead on Dean, leaving Castiel in charge.  And so, when the spell to get rid of the Mark was finally decoded, Castiel used Crowley to gather the ingredients, and then allowed Rowena to perform the spell.
“You can stay with me tonight, if you like,” Dean said, stopping just past the threshold.  Castiel could tell that he was trying to make it seem as if he didn’t care about the answer, but his eyes belied his nervousness.  “Or I can stay here.”
, the best he could.  He and Cas didn’t talk about the grimness of their futures, and for that he was grateful.
“Well, the big question is, where the hell is she?” said Dean, groaning as he repositioned due to his injuries.
“You don't wanna know,” Castiel said.
Dean changed the subject.  “So what are you gonna do if you find Kelly and, uh, Lucifer Junior?  It is a Nephilim, right?”
“Scared?” Lucifer taunted.
“Fair point,” Dean said, nipping at Castiel’s neck and thrusting against him.  He grabbed Castiel’s hand and pulled, nearly catching the angel off-balance in the process.
Castiel looked at his friend in confusion, and was immediately caught up in his green eyes.  There was a bead of sweat going down his friend’s neck, and Castiel longed to follow it…
Castiel and the angel Benjamin worked together for three solid weeks in search of Cain, and Castiel was incredibly thankful for his assistance.  Just as he remembered, Benjamin was efficient, detail-oriented, patient, and kind when working with others, though he typically preferred to work alone.
But Castiel didn’t catch up.  He didn’t call, either, or text, nor did he return Dean’s calls or texts.  Dean even went so far as to pray to the angel, but to no avail.
was almost a relief, after Amara.
“Great,” said Sam.  “Meet me tomorrow afternoon.”  Sam gave the address, and then hung up the phone.
“I tried to kill her,” he protested.
That was what he had told Kelvin.  Then Dean’s face entered his mind.  “
Josiah was dead – he
Dean had already assumed that much.  “Okay.  That's great, but we've got ourselves a problem.”
Dean’s hand had stopped moving in his bliss, but it was still wrapped tightly around Castiel’s cock, and he thrusted into it.  Dean spasmed within him, phantom thrusts nailing his prostate teasingly, and Castiel felt his own pleasure coiling as well.
Dean’s face relaxed slowly, and the mask slipped from his features into a sad but resigned smile.  “I know, Cas,” he said.
“Very much so.”
“We go on drives all the time, Dean,” Castiel said, confused.  He sat down on the bed, watching Dean’s movements.
.  So that Castiel could leave again.
“But we're heading somewhere,” Sam said tiredly.  “The end.”
“Castiel, my primary role is as a guardian.  I guard the gardens of Heaven.  If I die, the power of Heaven will significantly diminish.  So, I must never become overly involved in the conflicts of Earth.”
“Because I
Dean was still slightly out of breath.  He wasn’t really listening to the auction anymore, but he tuned in every so often.  “The next item is Gungnir, said to be Odin’s staff from long ago.  It matches…”
“You can’t actually mean that,” said Sam.
“Cas,” Dean croaked out, and his voice sounded throaty, unused.  “Cas, I can’t-…” he started.
That evening, with Little Cas out of the house and an entire bottle of whiskey, Dean cried.
“During sex, have you ever thought about switching roles?”
Dean smiled.  “Well,
“I’ll look into the lore,” said Sam, leaving the room.
Castiel ended up in Crowley’s throne room at the entrance to Hell.  He wasn’t sure if it was because the message Amara had written on his stomach was meant for Crowley, or because Amara knew of his friendship with Dean and had sent him to Dean’s side.  Either way, he ended up in a room with Crowley, Dean, and Rowena.
“You should go,” said Sam, walking up behind them.  “Seriously.”
Season 10, Part 1
Calls went to voicemail.
Castiel looked first at Dean’s glass, which was once again almost gone, and then at Dean’s face.  He looked horrified.  Dean suddenly felt indignant.  What the hell was wrong with Castiel?  So what if he had drank an aphrodisiac?  Was the thought of being touched by Dean so horrifying?  It wasn’t as though Dean was going to lose control.  Did Castiel think that low of him?
“Going on dates – that's something humans do, right?” Castiel continued.

The shoot-out ended with Ketch and Mary locking them into the bunker with another Men of Letters employee, Lady Toni Bevell.  She was the woman who had kidnapped and tortured Sam a year ago, and also the woman who had been responsible for pioneering and administering the brainwashing techniques used on Mary.
“Really?” Sam asked.  “You don't . . . Ever want something more?  Not even with Cas?”
When he regained control of himself once again, he was kneeling, covered in blood, and all of the loan sharks were dead.
Season 10, Part 3
Castiel pulled him close again, wrapping his arms around him.  “I love you, Dean,” Castiel whispered.

“Well, yeah, a bit,” said Bobby.  “The way Cas explained it-…”
“Cas!  Man, focus!  Damn, this Angel Amore stuff really did get to you.”
to have a good time, so, yeah, I could try it.”
“Come again?”
There was something in Dean’s eyes, Castiel realized.  A sort of vulnerability.
“Oh, so what?” Dean snapped, his voice low and dangerous.  “So you
“You don't get to make demands, Metatron,” said Castiel.  “You're not in charge here.”
“And if you’re referring to sexual intercourse, of
“Dean,” Metatron greeted.  “Always with the B-grade, 80’s-action-movie wit.”
But Castiel’s actions in the past, as long as Dean had known him, didn’t match up with his recent actions.
“Cas, wait!” protested Dean.
Sam was dying.  He was currently in a coma, but according to the local hospital’s neurologist and grief counselor, the outcome wasn’t looking good.  Dean prayed to Castiel, but his old friend was silent.
At that moment there was the loud screeching of a microphone, and the crowd’s attention was drawn to the front of the room.  A very tall, thin man was attempting to make a microphone reach his height.  He finally gave up and simply leaned over into it.  “Hello all, and welcome to my Mythos Supper and Auction Party!  I’m Timothy Laurent, though most of you know me as ‘Tim’ or even ‘T.L.’  I’d like to thank the British, American, and Spanish Antiquities Associations, as well as a great number of independent donors – you know who you are – for donating to this auction.  Remember, though the auction is being held at my home, please don’t be surprised if I outbid you.  It is with the utmost respect.”
Sam fixed Dean with a stare.  “
Dean thought about it.  “Actually… yeah,” he said.  He waited on the feeling of regret to hit, but, oddly, he just felt
was wrong.
“The angels that I served with are being killed,” Castiel said, looking tired.  “So I will put up with Ishim, I will put up with everything else, and so will you.  I have to go.”
Castiel continued to “need a bit of improvement” on his hunting skills.  (That was the phrase Dean used when he was being nice.)  First, Castiel accidentally got the Winchesters kicked out of the nursing home.  In an attempt to correct his mistake, and on the instructions of the Winchesters, Castiel remained at the nursing home, invisible, to watch over Fred.  It wasn’t long before Fred accidentally caused a birthday cake to explode all over the other residents.  In the confusion afterward, Castiel somehow managed to lose track of Fred himself.
Castiel looked away and growled, a low, primal growl that made the hair on the back of Den’s neck stand up.  Finally, he said hesitantly, “I think only the caster can reverse it or cure it.  If I were human, I’d be dead by now.”
“Oh,” said Castiel, and he relaxed and put away his weapon.
“No, you’re not,” Dean said.  He was happy Castiel was willing to speak to him at all, even if it was about this horrible news.  “How long have you got?”
Cas nodded once and turned away, but Dean caught his fond smile as he put on h
“Bitch,” Dean said, relaxing backward into the seat.
“No!” exclaimed Dean.  “There has to be another way!”  He stood up and grabbed the whiskey, intending to escape to his room where he could think, alone.
Castiel’s face turned shocked, then amazed, then finally a wide grin split his face.  “I love you too, Dean,” he said, pulling Dean close to him.
It went on like that, for months.  Dean and Benny fought whatever monster came across their path, sometimes followed by a quick, manly hug.  Occasionally, they would come across a monster (usually a vampire or a werewolf) that didn’t seem interested in fighting.  Sometimes the other monsters they came across were wounded or clearly outmatched, but other times they simply looked at Dean and Benny and then abruptly ran away.  “You’ve got yourself a reputation,” said Benny.  “Most of us want to eat you for breakfast, but a few of us are smart enough to know that’s gonna get us killed.”
“Why would we follow you?” Hannah asked.
“That's not gonna happen,” said Dean.
“Seriously, did you - Did he just say that?” Dean asked Sam.
There was also the matter of Jack, Lucifer’s son.  He had been born a teenager.  Sam said it was because Kelly had told him, in the womb, that the world was a dangerous place and he had to grow up fast.
Surely that wasn’t why everyone was gathered here, at the entrance to Hell…
“No,” said Castiel, scrolling on the internet.  “Thank you.”
“-… A year or so ago, for some reason, Heaven started trying to revert to the way it was before, when everybody had their own separate quarters.”
“Great,” Dean said, brushing past him, “And I’d like a beer.”
the demon…
If he was being honest with himself, Castiel had felt something when he had felt the baby kick, as well.  Something had tried to connect with him, something not altogether
Dean laughed derisively.  “He’d probably be too busy with the whole Kelly thing to come let us out of the bunker anyway.”
“Yeah, but that ship sailed a long time ago,” Dean protested.
Dean smiled, understanding the gesture.  “Why did you remove it?” he asked cautiously, moving onto his side to face Castiel.
“I can’t find Cas,” Sam said.  “Do you think he blew town?”
“What's our plan here, fellas?” Dean asked.
Dean whirled around just as Castiel’s blade sliced cleanly through the leviathan’s head.
July turned into August.  Castiel was sicker than ever.  He felt like when he was under the influence of Pestilence.  His vessel was revolting against the grace, against his essence.  He was sleeping again…
Calming and speed were both things that Dean needed at the moment.  He took a slow drink, just as Justin turned back to expound to Castiel about the things that had been rumored to be at the auction.
The question once again caught Castiel off guard.  “No,” he said honestly.
Dean could feel his face reddening.  In the next second, Crowley was gone.
“Yes.  Dumbass,” said Dean.  “
Dean looked surprised, as though this statement had pulled him out of a deep train of thought.  “You’ll find her,” he said, recovering.  “You can sense, her, right?  It’s only a matter of time.”
Castiel inserted a finger, and Dean felt he might come just from that – why had he even bothered sleeping with anyone else, as though they could
have to stop him,” corrected Castiel, looking away.
Castiel laid a hand on him, steadying him.  He could feel a small tendril of Castiel’s grace wind its way through him, a healing, calming touch.  They stared at each other in silence for a second, and Castiel squeezed Dean’s arm, smiling comfortingly.
, Cas!”
“Cas, is that really you?” he asked carefully, still wary.
“How are you doing?” asked Sam.  “I’m-…”
“’You gonna be here when we’re done?” Benny asked Dean, cocking his head.
parents, not just memories.  And Cas… Cas was here somewhere.  Something opened in his heart, a tornado of churning in a place that had been long silent.
“I only brought Sam and Dean,” Castiel said.
Dean smiled and then kissed down Castiel’s neck toward his groin.  He was determined to make this good.  This was the loss of virginity that Castiel
Castiel scooted over just slightly to make room for both Winchesters.  “I said to come alone,” said a male angel disdainfully, pouring sugar into his coffee.  Dean assumed that this was Ishim.  He was proud but quiet, the kind of quiet that comes from someone secretly waiting to stab you.  He reminded Dean of a snake.
Finally Dean bottomed out, filling Castiel to the hilt.  Both of them groaned, and Dean gave Castiel time to adjust.  Dean then began a slow thrust, the fingers of his hand tightening over Castiel’s.  It was…
Dean seemed to be struggling to make thoughts and words flow together.  “And that – that was it?”
He thought for a second of Castiel, who was the same.  Duty before happiness, always.  Despite his feelings for Dean, Castiel had felt the need to stay in Purgatory, to run away and keep the tablet safe, and now to complete the angel trials and save Heaven.  And despite his… yes, fine, his
“Sam --…” Dean protested.
disappeared like
Over the following week, Castiel moved back into the bunker.  Between this and the fact that it was Valentine’s Day, Sam decided to leave for a week to manage case in Montana.  Castiel celebrated Valentine’s Day by fucking Dean over the banister next to the chess board.  Dean couldn’t remember ever being happier – Lucifer was back in Hell, Sam was (relatively) safe and happy doing “Sam things”, and he and Castiel were screwing each other on every available surface.  Dean even found the time to cook (he could tell that Cas was thoroughly unimpressed, though he put on a good show of acting like he loved it).
Castiel’s head was screaming in pain.  “What have you done to me?” he screamed at Naomi.  The reality of his vessel, advancing on Dean, and the part of his brain still in Naomi’s office being controlled by her collided with brute force.
In the old days, Castiel would’ve simply sensed Dean’s presence in the world and flown to his side.  Though he could sense through their bond whether or not Dean was year, he hadn’t been able to properly sense Dean’s exact location for years due to the Enochian warding carved into Dean’s ribs.  Therefore, the bunker seemed the most logical place to start.
Dean had saved him, this time.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a voice from the front of the room.  It was TL. Laurant.  “I hope you have had a wonderful evening full of dancing and romancing.  Now, however, it is time for the auction!”
“We need somebody to get close to her, someone with a … personal connection,” he said.
of the bond… it
“Sam, if it’s gonna be with anyone, it’s gonna be with Cas,” Dean said confidently.  He honestly hadn’t really thought of settling down… mostly because he tried
Finally, Benny stopped, still clutching his arm, which was in tatters.  More of the arm had been severed than was still attached.   It was the worst injury any of them had had in Purgatory, and all of them knew it.  “Knew you’d be the death of me, angel,” said Benny, panting.
Dean leaned to kiss him, and it was just the faintest brush of lips, as though Dean refused to allow himself to get too tangled up.  “I’m sorry I couldn’t be more for you,” Dean said.
The next day, Dean and Cas scoured Hastings, Nebraska for any sign of demonic or angelic activity, but found nothing.  By twilight, Dean’s patience was starting to wear thin.  “Wow, will you look at that,” he commented to Cas as they drove by yet another dilapidated building.  “Our ninth abandoned factory.  Ain't that America?  Hey, what do you say, if this doesn't pan out, we head back to that beer-and-bacon happy hour about a mile back, huh?”
As was usual for the Winchesters, the plan had almost immediately gone awry.  Castiel was kicked off the submarine by angel warding.  The Germans had attacked, but Dean and a Woman of Letters named Delphine managed to erase the angel warding in time for Castiel to retrieve Dean, and the Hand of God, at the last possible moment.
” sounded too “high school girl.”
“You ever miss it?” Kelvin asked.  “Upstairs?  I mean, don't get me wrong.  I love Earth.  It's quirky.  It smells like hay.  But it's not home, is it?”
Dean went after Doctor Mahoney, who was busy robbing a bank, while Sam and Castiel addressed Fred, held captive in a van outside the bank.  It was lucky, for once, that Castiel was present.  He was able to insert himself and Sam into Fred’s mind, a haze of cartoons.
They were looking at each other, and Dean felt lost in Castiel’s eyes, so much more expressive now that he was human.
“Eager, aren’t we,” said Dean, but he followed Castiel’s lead, still looking skeptical.
Castiel didn’t move to attack.  “How can I convince you?” he asked seriously.
But Billie was suddenly not so merciful.  “Since I got this…new job, I stand witness to a much larger picture,” she told him.  “Do you know what I see?  You.  And your brother.  You’re important.”
“Metatron and I were working to shut the gates of Heaven, with the angels inside, when he was taken by Naomi,” Castiel answered.  “He remembered the trials from his time with God writing the tablets.  But now that he’s been taken, I’m not sure what the third trial was.”  He looked imploringly at Dean.  “Dean, I have to make this right.  I caused the problems, and I need to fix them.  And
In addition to their usual research on ways to capture or kill Lucifer, Castiel and the Winchesters spent the night after Crowley’s visit discussing ways to get past the President’s security.  Some of their most plausible ideas depended on Crowley, which was never a good thing.  Defeated, Sam went to bed, and Dean and Castiel spent time getting reacquainted with each other’s bodies.
A minute later, T.L. Laurant rose again to the podium.  “I see the aphrodesiac has had an effect on some of you,” he said, laughing.  “It should be in effect by now, and should last for six hours, or so I’m told.”
“You stabbed one of our friends,” Dean said, determinedly not looking at Castiel, because he couldn’t, he didn’t want to see.
Castiel and Dean both stopped taking off their jackets to look where Crowley was pointing.  Dean followed Crowley’s finger to the front door.  There was a metal detector, which already made Dean wary because it meant he couldn’t bring any of his weapons.  Additionally, Dean realized that there were at least two machines run by the men in uniform that looked unfamiliar, despite the fact that Dean knew his way around most normal security.
Now it seemed he had lost that connection forever.
“Are you serious?” Sam groaned.  “Dean, it's late.  I'm exhausted and starving.  And this place . . . I mean, even Swayze wouldn't come to this roadhouse.”
He tried not to show it.  “You had sex with April?” he said, trying (and failing) not to sound angry.
It wasn’t anything Dean could define exactly.  Castiel didn’t spend as much time at the bunker – not a big deal, Dean rationalized.  Since Castiel had officially moved into the bunker in December, they’d both gone for hunts off and on by themselves.  Castiel especially never stayed long, as though he didn’t want to overwhelm Dean with his presence – but it had always been like that.
“Oh, Lucifer,” she said, entering slowly through the hole she had made.  She looked just like he remembered her:  powerful, and seductive, and terrifying in her flowing black dress that looked somehow like robes.  “Dear nephew, my, how you've changed.  I was tracking her when she left my side.”  Amara pointed to Rowena.
“No, you two go on ahead.  I’ll catch up,” said Castiel.
Honestly, the hunting had been so sparse that Dean had been forced to get a part-time job as a mechanic just to keep things interesting.  In all honesty, it was… not as bad as he had anticipated.
Dean sighed.  A cold shower was probably in order.
“What?” Castiel said, surprised.  He couldn’t believe his good fortune.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel hadn’t made it out of Purgatory, which left a large, gaping hole inside of Dean.
As Rowena added Dean’s hair to the bowl with the other ingredients, a bluish smoke began to rise and a bright light illuminated Rowena’s face.  Suddenly, a blast wave erupted from the bowl, knocking over everyone in the room – Rowena, Crowley, and Castiel himself.  A bolt of red lightning blasted from the bowl, causing a hole in the roof.
Eventually, with the help of a new prophet, a professor named Donatello, Dean was able to distract Amara long enough for Sam, Donatello, and Metatron to rescue Castiel from Amara.  It was a close shave, and Metatron even sacrificed himself to the effort, but God came through in the end.
Castiel’s hands dug into his hips, and his eyes bored into Dean’s.
He flinched.
After what seemed like months, they finally found Castiel.  Benny and the angel fought constantly, about everything, but both were immensely protective of Dean.  After a few battles against leviathan, however, Castiel and Benny seemed to grow on each other.  (Or, at least, they began to accept that they were stuck with each other.)  Though they still fought constantly, after a month or so Benny added Castiel to his post-battle hug ritual.  The first time it happened, Castiel looked at Dean in question, and Dean simply shrugged.
Dean and Sam immediately began redoing the angel wards on the bunker, which they had been admittedly lazy about because of Cas’ presence there.
“Not just yet,” Castiel reminded him.  “I have to clean the bathroom.”
“Okay, yes,” Metatron said, rolling his eyes.  “Maybe I got a little carried away at first, but those days are over.  A near-death experience makes you re-evaluate.  So, one time only, I'm offering amnesty.  Every angel, no matter what their sin, may join me and return to Heaven.  I will be their God, and they can be my heavenly host.”
“Don’t,” said Dean.
“We know who you are,” said a female angel with narrowed eyes.
Sam and Cas began a good-natured conversation about the Trans.  Dean ignored both of them, turned on the television, and flipped to his favorite soap opera.
A few days later, Castiel discovered video chat.  He had finally agreed to be a leader in the fight to take back Heaven from Metatron.  He and his angel followers had taken over Bartholomew’s old Headquarters, which came complete with quite a bit of technology.
Kevin’s Heaven was peaceful, and he expressed his thanks to Dean for all of the times the brothers had helped him.  He said that his mother was grateful as well, and they were in constant contact.
Castiel head-butted Ishim, but Ishim retaliated with a swift punch to the face.  “But now look at you.  You're just sad and pathetically weak.”
“I wouldn't be much use.  I don't have my powers,” Castiel protested.
“Oh, that’s what you meant,” commented Castiel.  He seemed far more interested in Dean’s cock than the condom, and Dean was finding it increasingly hard to concentrate.  He rolled the condom onto himself before he lost full control of the situation.
Lucifer missed this entirely, his eyes focused on Castiel’s angel blade and the determination on their faces.  “Ah, ah, ah,” said Lucifer.  “At moments like this, it’s all about ambiance.”  Lucifer snapped his fingers and music started playing - Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel.  He started to dance, mocking them.
Castiel abandoned this plan altogether and pulled him forward by the lapels.  Dean ended up sitting on Castiel’s lap, the angel’s chair creaking under the weight.  Castiel mouthed up his neck, and Dean threw his head back, allowing himself tiny thrusts helplessly against Castiel’s stomach.  It had been
Dean had the annoying urge to reach out to the angel like he would’ve done in Purgatory, but he resolutely held his arm still.
“Really?” Sam asked skeptically.
“Cas,” Dean said, standing with a yawn, “Should I make you a bed down here?  “Even if we have to keep you chained up, we can at least keep you comfortable.”
“What happened to you?” asked Dean.
“We’re just us, Dean and Cas.”
“You can turn it off and on at will?” Dean asked, his eyes widening.
The thirst of the Mark filled his blood once more, and the blood rushed in his ears.
Dean knew he didn’t have long before the Mark won him over.  He wasn’t okay with it, not by a long shot… he just didn’t know what to do about it.  The best thing to do, he rationalized, would be to minimize the damage, to stay far away from Sam and Cas when the Mark finally took control.  If they didn’t manage to kill him first, which he truly hoped they would.
Castiel looked as though he meant to protest, but Dean finished with Castiel’s boxer-briefs and took him in hand instead.  He was large and hard and perfect.  Castiel gave an involuntary thrust into Dean’s fist.
Four days after Dean met the other vampire, they came across two female monsters of some sort.  Dean was exhausted at the time, as he and Benny had encountered two leviathan not an hour before.  They had spent 45 minutes running as far as their legs would take them after beheading the fowl things.  Still, Dean readied his (at that time still make-shift) weapon, his legs protesting remaining in his continued upright position.
“Huh,” Dean said, because, honestly, what was a person supposed to say to that?
“If it is him, I will call you,” Castiel answered.  “In the meantime, I think you're needed here.”
Time passed, and suddenly he was back on Earth again.  Castiel was doing Heaven’s bidding this time, he was sure of it.  He was a righteous angel again.  He was no longer a Fallen.
Castiel once again moved backward from him and looked thoughtful.  “Dean, I’m telling you this now because I want there to be no more secrets.  I understand, now, how important that is to you, that your mind be your own.  I’ve wanted to tell you all of this for a long time.  I-…”
,” Dean insisted.  “
“That won’t be easy,” said Castiel.
“Oh, yes!” Castiel answered, honestly and enthusiastically, reaching out to throw an arm around Dean.
Dean didn’t know what Ramiel was talking about.  None of them had stolen from him.
“You said the angel, Ezekiel, helped heal him,” Castiel protested.
Dean’s eyes were blown wide as they stared into Castiel’s, his hands beginning to slacken on Castiel’s cock as he gave in to his own pleasure.  “Cas, I-…”
Sam seemed to consider this, then finally added, “So much for that plan, then.”
an angel.”
Dean shuddered.  “Don’t ruin the best night I’ve had in months,” he said.  He located the button that he was fairly certain controlled the jets, then jerked quickly as he realized that one of the jets was way too close to his groin.
Why had he been so stupid?  When he saw Castiel again, he would tell him he loved him.  He would bottom.  He loved him so much…

A wide grin spread across Crowley’s face.  “I heard rumors there might be something of that sort at the party, but I never could’ve dared
“You want it?” Dean taunted him.  “Take it!  But you're gonna have to kill me first.  Come on, you coward.  Do it.  Do it!”
Dean was gob-smacked.  Never, in his entire life, had he been able to have that kind of faith in
Castiel didn’t really comprehend, but what Dean said sounded good, so he nodded.  Surely there would be kissing again at some point, more touching.  Why were they sitting so far apart?  He moved closer to Dean once more, leaning into him and kissing his neck.
“Oh, thanks,” said Gail as Dwight lifted one of her cases of beer.  “You're a real gentleman.”
Dean groaned at the contact, bracing his knees around Castiel’s middle.  He grabbed both of their erections and tugged, letting out another groan of satisfaction.
“Look… I didn’t
He had a dream once that he was surrounded by the bodies of a thousand Dean Winchesters, all dead at his hand.  Naomi was there, too, saying, “Finally, you’re ready.”  And he felt nothing, but of course it was all a dream.  He could never kill his bondmate.  And yet angels did not dream…
“So what’s going on with you, Cas?” Dean asked finally.  They weren’t touching, more existing comfortably side by side.  Dean sipped his beer nonchalantly.
Castiel felt the energy coming up his arm, and suddenly, he

that he hadn’t expected
“Well, we didn’t catch Lucifer, but we did save the crowd, so I’m gonna call that a win,” said Dean.
“Then get outta here,” Dean said.  “This is no life for a kid.”
“Cas,” he said.  “I’m sorry.”
Castiel remembered what it was like during the time he was human.  He had constantly desired some sort of contact, either sexually or physically.  Although he adored these things with Dean (and the thought of them with any other human or angel was repulsive), Castiel didn’t constantly require them as Dean did.
Sam nodded, and they didn’t talk for a few moments.  Then Sam said, as though he’d been working up to it, “Cas, all those other angels look at you like… like they worship you.  Like they’re in
One by one they left him there, alone with his thoughts and his grief.
“Dean, it's fine,” said Castiel.
In all of the times Dean had imagined being with Castiel in this way, he had never imagined it like this – under a table, as quick as possible, during a black-tie event.  Still, he smiled at the unfocused, glassy-eyed look on his friend’s face, the slight sweat beading on his brow, his hard breathing...
shot through him, along with the electricity of attraction.  “Dean, I don’t blame you for the waitress,” he said.
“"We got tonight.  Who needs tomorrow"?” Dean guessed.
“Oh – oh, he had the Angel blade,” Dean repeated.  It was a struggle to hold back his annoyance, and the butterflies in his stomach that he didn’t recognize.  He should be happy for Castiel… it should be funny.
,” Dean said with a small smile.  “That was the look I’ve been waiting for.  I keep telling ya’, if this doesn’t work, you’re gonna have to kill me.”
“Come for me, Dean,” Castiel commanded, and Dean shattered, moaning Castiel’s name through his pleasure.
Sam laughed.  “Cas, nothing we do is normal,” he said.  “I’m just saying your fight was more about the Mark than about Dean’s feelings for you, or… whatever.”  He looked away uncomfortably.
“C’mon, Sammy!” Dean said, appealing to his brother.
“Dean,” Castiel moaned again, and now Dean could feel Castiel’s own erection against his, and the chair they were sitting on gave an almighty creak as the angel resituated and thrusted upward.
him?  He hadn’t been this touchy-feely with anyone in years – not since Purgatory, where the monsters and the lack of human interaction made it necessary.  Granted, it didn’t help that due to their close proximity it was almost harder
“No. I can't, because I'm your friend.”  They had never claimed to be any more than that, though everyone knew they were.
“Oh,” Dean said again.  He hadn’t realized.
“Good,” said Castiel eagerly.  “Hand it to me, and I'll take it to Heaven.”
, or if it was really because he was angry about Amara.
“No,” Castiel said miserably.  “I
Castiel was still suspiciously absent from Dean’s life, but Dean did finally get to meet the hated angel Naomi.  She even helped him with the second trial.  “See,” she told the brothers before flying away.  “I told you you could trust me.”
Crowley, taking note of this, said, “I’ll drop back in in two minutes.  That’ll give you time to decide.”  And he disappeared.
“Piper?” Dean said jovially.  “That's awesome.  One-night wonders, man.  Shoot, we're lucky we still get that at all.”
Dean removed his hand, and Castiel sent him a desperate look.  “I’m out of options here.  We can’t be kicked out before we get the staff and the rod.  You gotta -…”
“Don’t!” Castiel snarled, and he thrashed in his chains.  He rolled toward them, away from Dean, so that he could lie on his other side and face the other man, which pulled him off of the mattress.  Dean moved away from him and sat up fully.  He could see the red coloring his friends’ eyes, even in the dimly lit dungeon.
Or, at least, Dean
“Wow,” said Dean.  He should’ve ignored Castiel’s protests and visited him earlier.  He hadn’t realized things had gotten this bad.  “So you went from fighting heavenly battles to nuking taquitos?”
“Better?” Castiel asked, watching for Dean’s reaction.
for you.  I love you, even when you don’t love yourself.  Nothing my brother does can ever cause the end of
“Why?” Dean asked.  On the one hand, he was relieved.  But on the other hand… there was only more pain, more sadness.
Dean stumbled out of the car disbelievingly.
“What do you mean?” Castiel asked.
Dean squinted to see farther into the distance.  The uniformed men were using some sort of scanner on two women entering the building hand in hand.  One of the women was rather stocky and wearing a long, blue evening dress.  The other was almost too thin and wearing a tux.  Another couple, a man and a woman this time, got out of another limousine beyond Dean and headed to the large door of the building.
There was silence for a second.  “Look, man.  Getting Lucifer back into the box is gonna take all three of us, maybe even all
“We, ah, worked together,” said Dean.
But that had just been Dean reacting to the Angel Amore, surely.  The bond that had been created when Castiel had pulled Dean out of hell might have exacerbated the effects both for him and for Dean (though he had obviously been the most effected).  After all, Dean had only ever claimed to like women.  And even if Dean would have been interested in a relationship before Castiel had made a scene in front of Sam and Crowley, he surely wouldn’t now.
“I mean… don’t you like it like it is?” Dean said, now obviously fully awake.  He unconsciously moved toward Castiel.
Dean felt the icy cold hand of fear, but held it back.  Ramiel was still coming for them.  Castiel wouldn’t – Ramiel would have a cure, surely, and they had Mandy to look forward to-…
“Good, good,” Dean said, trying to think of anything but his brother’s screams.  He was glad Castiel was an angel again.  It made him feel as though a small piece of the world was put back to rights, somehow.  “That’s uh… So what, you just change the batteries out, power back up, it’s that easy?”
But Castiel had taken Dean’s hand again and placed it on himself, thrusting up into it quietly.  His jaw was set and his blue eyes were determined, and Dean could tell that he understood.
Damn his brother for being so intuitive.
“Whatever,” said Dean.  “We have more important issues.  Now that you're back, let's go, Team Free Will.  Let's get it done.  We’ll figure us out later.”
There were leviathan – five of them.  They hadn’t stayed in one place for too long, but they were surrounded.  “God dammit, angel!” Benny swore, and they began the fight.  Two rushed Dean, and he dodged one and cut the head off of the other cleanly with his sword.  Castiel cut the head off of the third leviathan, and Dean watched, unable to help, as the mouth of a fourth leviathan began to close just over Castiel’s head.
“Angels?”
He supposed he
“But you never prayed
… here.
“I know, man,” Dean said again, putting a hand on his friends’ shoulder.  Castiel looked at his hand in mild surprise.  It was the kind of gesture common in Purgatory, but never done in front of Sam.  It had been ages now since Dean had shown him any sort of affection.
His excuse to leave the suffocating bunker arose the following day, when he heard an old angel friend cry for help.  Benjamin, a member of his old garrison, uttered a series of cries for help before he suddenly, alarmingly, stopped.
“Is your Heaven to your liking?” Castiel asked.
“No, it's exactly what you meant,” Sam retorted.  “You want to know what I confessed in there?  What my greatest sin was?  It was how many times I let you down.  I can't do that again!”
Dean had some time to think as he trudged through a now-abandoned park in an effort to hitch a ride back to Kansas, or at least find someone who would let him borrow a phone.  He had no idea where Chuck had transported him to to confront Amara, but he felt as though he’d already walked a mile.  His phone was apparently worthless, which he attributed to interference from the thousands of souls he had been carrying inside him until Chuck had diffused him.  Or, perhaps the diffusing itself had short-circuited his phone.  Godly power tended to do that.
.  It was a strange life he led in which putting Lucifer back in the cage –
Dean responded by shoving two now-lubricated fingers into Castiel, nailing his prostate on one try.
“Cas-…” Dean began in frustration, but the angel continued.  “And, I wanted to give you and Sam some privacy with your mother.”
“Are there any more burritos?” Castiel asked, completely clueless.
, now that there was time.  And then Castiel’s mouth was around him, and he forgot to think.  It was like coming home, as though a hole that had been missing inside him had finally repaired itself.
for you!  He rebelled for you,
It was only a lifetime’s worth of hunter reflexes that stopped Dean from dropping his coffee cup on the floor.
“Cas,” Dean said, and it was both a plea and a warning.  Dean moved his neck out of Castiel’s reach, though he didn’t move away.  “We’re in public.”  His voice was husky, and shot straight to Castiel’s groin.
Castiel thought, testing the words carefully in his mind.
Somehow that stung more than it should have, though Castiel didn’t let on.  But, obviously, Castiel rationalized.  Of course Sam, and saving the world, came first.  “Well, you do live exciting lives,” Castiel said.
“Cas,” Dean said, moving closer to the television as though he could reach through it.  “What did you want that you couldn’t have?”
“How do you know?”
No less than eight hands went up, including Dean’s, and Castiel’s.
“Doesn’t matter,” said Castiel adjusting himself yet again.  He was relieved that his vessel happened to be wearing underwear that at the very least seemed to allow for some ability to hide his body’s reaction to Dean’s nearness.  He knew this wasn’t something either of them wanted to deal with tonight, especially Dean.  If Dean
“Oh?” said the large African man, whose name (they had learned) was Imamu Jahar.  “What business?”
But, more importantly, Castiel had no memory of getting out of Purgatory, which was alarming at best.  How could he trust that?  Castiel had said he didn’t know how Sam got out of Hell, either, until he was caught in a lie.
“I feel better, yeah, um, just having a direction to move in,” said Sam.  Dark circles hung from his eyes these days, and he always seemed seconds from sleep, though it never seemed to come.
Castiel healed his friend, horrified at his handywork as he realized just how close he had been to killing his friend.
Most prominently among them was the obvious effects of the Angel Amore, which Castiel had only made worse.  There was a large part of him that couldn’t wait for this entire mission to be over so that he could see if Castiel was as good as his word.  If the angel
“I don’t see how that would be helpful,” Castiel mused, his hands skittering down Dean’s sides.
Half an hour later, Benny returned, zipping his fly.  The girls were nowhere in sight.
It never failed to surprise Dean that, as an angel, Castiel appeared able to prep himself at a moment’s notice for this type of sex.  They had never required more than a minimal amount of lube, as Castiel could adjust his… vessel?... as needed.  And still, Dean checked each time as though somehow it would be different.
Purgatory was simple like that.
Even after Sam went to sleep that night, Dean stayed up feeling restless.  He remembered, with an odd squirming in his chest, the time they had spent together in Purgatory.  He remembered the feeling of Castiel’s hand in his as his friend grabbed him to run from leviathan.  He remembered the feeling of Castiel’s beard on his face during one of their few monster-free moments.
“And I’ll look you up next time I come through,” he added.
“I’m going to get something out of the car,” Ezekiel said pissily, rising suddenly from his seat and marching away.
Cas nodded, looking sad, and disappeared into the crowd.
Dean could frankly care less, except that Jack being in his late teens made him marginally easier to kill than a newborn baby.  Sam wouldn’t have it, however.  He felt that Jack had good in him, that his powers could be controlled, and that he could be saved.
, he was sure.  But the thoughts would leave as quickly as they came.
turn-on, even here, away from the monsters.  Castiel divested Dean of his pants, quickly and efficiently, without giving Dean time to think about whether or not it was a good idea.
“How do we cure the Angel Amore?” Dean asked, his voice still lower than usual.
Despite Dean’s claim that he was going to “sleep for four days,” Dean was far from asleep when Castiel checked on him in his bedroom that night.  The door was left open a crack, which Castiel understood by now was a cue that Dean was okay with being disturbed.  He lay on his back on his bed, eyes closed tight, feet crossed, 80’s music blaring loudly from his headphones.
And here they were, facing danger side by side, like normal.  It was as he had said earlier – they would “work through their crap” later.
With time, he admitted that Jack was different than Lucifer, and stopped watching his back constantly in the boy’s presence.  He stopped thinking of Jack as a time bomb and began thinking of him as a sort of odd nephew that had come to stay in his house.  He made peace with the fact that Jack was, in a sense, the only thing Castiel had left behind.
The absences and lack of communication was one thing, Dean reasoned, but combined with Castiel’s odd behavior the last time they had seen each other…
“It is,” said Castiel, looking reluctant.  Finally, he added, “There may be another way.”
“Make it up!” snapped Crowley.  “You’re good at that.  Tell them you’re a new band, the Losechesters, and you’re
“Cas, what’ve you done?” exclaimed Dean.
Castiel had been quiet during the auction and not so much as looked at Dean.  Dean could feel several eyes on him, however – at least three of the losers of the staff and rod were glaring daggers at him.
returned.
Dean grinned.  “You’d damn well better.”
Dean nodded.
“’Wanted this for a really long time,” said Dean.  “I’m so sorry, Cas.”
“Deal,” said Castiel.
Dean raised his hand, and he held back a moan from his throat as Castiel’s hand fastened around his erection.  His grasp was firm yet gentle, and Dean forced himself to stay alert.
“I’m sorry, Dean, but I needed the empty bottle,” Castiel explained.  “I want to give you something.”
of them had been missing
Dean had even gone to the playground that used to be the entrance to Heaven, but there had been no answer.  He had screamed for hours, jumped up and down in the sandbox, and, in a final fit of desperation, pissed in it.  And still, there was nothing.  (Plus, now he felt guilty for pissing in a child’s sandbox.)
He sighed.  “Cas, is it always going to be like this?”
“Ok,” Dean said.  “I’ll see you when you get back.  A few days, right?”
“Check outside to see if there are others,” Ishim ordered her.
“I… I don’t understand,” he said.  “You said in the car-…”
But he was gone.
“You left,” Castiel said simply.  He eyed the condom suspiciously.  “What’s that?”
He didn’t like the idea that his relationship with Castiel was so public.  Sam finding out had been bad enough, but the thought of the rest of the world knowing honestly terrified him to the core.  Even worse, there was something horribly bittersweet about the girl that played Dean and the girl that played Castiel kissing.  Dean wished he hadn’t pushed away the real Castiel.
Suddenly, there was an explosion, and a gaping hole appeared in the church.  Dean was able to breathe again suddenly.  When he had collected himself, he looked, terrified, to realize that someone had blown a hole in the wall.
“That’s… great?” Dean said.  He had been lost twenty minutes ago.
“No,” he said, his face burning as his thoughts cleared for a second.  “Um, the opposite.”  Was that what Dean thought?  He
“Man, I needed that,” admitted Sam the next evening.  Dean had spent the day kidding him about his “night moves”.
The next time Dean spoke with Castiel was a full week and a half later.  Dean and Sam were on a case involving a banshee at a nursing home only 15 minutes away from the bunker, and Dean had nipped back home just long enough to gather some supplies.
“Dean,” Sam said, warningly, but Dean could feel himself spiraling out of control.  It was a feeling he associated with the Mark of Cain, if admittedly on a lesser scale.  Everything he’d been shoving down for more than two months – Lucifer, the imprisonment and isolation, and most of all,
Dagon asked, “How –?”
“And to think, I did you a favor,” said Crowley, but he disappeared.
“They functioned like medics,” Castiel said.  “They tended to the wounded.  They healed those who could be healed, but for the mortally wounded, those who were past saving, the rit zien's job was to put them down.”
Sam and Dean simply stared at him.  “You’re hurt,” he said, looking at Dean.  He held out his hand, healing Dean’s arm.
“Never mind,” Castiel said, moving just slightly backward.  “Forget I said anything.”
“You?” Sam asked looking backward at Castiel, but the angel only grunted.
Dean looked irritated, but plowed on.  “Because there have been enough secrets!  And I wanted you to know that I’m sorry!  And I wouldn’t have done it under… normal circumstances.”
“No,” said Dean stubbornly.
Castiel removed his fingers from Dean’s forehead.  “See, it wasn't that I was weak,” he told Dean.  “I was stronger than you.  I pulled away.  Nothing you could have done would have saved me, because I didn't want to be saved.”
“I’m – fuck you,” said Dean.  He had a sudden vision in his head of himself and Castiel holding hands and having drinks with the hunters they had met today, with Castiel explaining, “Dean is bisexual, and I’m an angel and have no technical gender beyond that of my vessel.”  This daydream made him less uncomfortable than he would’ve thought.
Dean burst out laughing, and Castiel smiled sheepishly.  “God, fantasies… I dunno, Cas, can’t you just, like, pull them out of my head?”
Sam had no response for a second.  Suddenly he seemed to sag, and he reminded Dean of the four-year-old that had beat up a bully on the schoolyard and was certain he’d be in trouble for it.  “It’s Eileen,” he said softly, defensively.  “We’re never exactly gonna have a… conventional life.”
Castiel smiled sheepishly.  “I, um... I came as soon as you called.  I wa –…”  His eyes lit on the mess on the floor.  The floor was covered in debris from a broken lamp, along with strewn papers and books.  “Dean, what’s happened?” he asked.  “What’s wrong?”
“You wanna join in, Hot Wings?” asked Benny, who no longer bothered to ask Dean.
The magic had cracked her chains, Castiel realized too late.
Castiel looked murderous for a second but then, once again, he deflated.  “Dean, I can’t fail again!  First the leviathans, and then Naomi… I
“Look, the auction room is open!” someone said nearby.
But the green eyes were still fixed on him.  They were almost…
… Dean felt panic rise up as his life in Purgatory with Castiel once again collided with his life as a hunter, as Sam’s older brother.
“I don't know,” he admitted, and at that moment, he didn’t really care, either.  He knew it would be his responsibility to round Lucifer up in the end, but after months riding shotgun he allowed himself this short respite.  Amara was more important, anyway.  He allowed Dean to help him up.  He relished Dean’s touch.  Even though he knew the battle was far from over, for a moment, he allowed himself to feel pleasure.
been a mole, as Castiel had earlier suspected, and Metatron did not like loose ends.
?” Dean said incredulously.
.  “You’re our family too, Cas,” he said, and Castiel gave one of his rare smiles.  It was a soppy smile, as though the sun shone out of Dean’s ass, and Dean felt both uncomfortable and warmed by it.
“Well, it seems that some of my choices may need to be questioned,” Castiel said, advancing on Ishim.  Dean could tell that Castiel was starting to get angry.  “Now tell me.  The girl – was she human?”
be ‘just sex?’”
“Yeah, and you were living the life, you know?” Dean deflected.  “Early retirement, working your way up the Gas N’ Sip ladder?”
This made Dean look furious.  “Dammit, Cas!  I prefer
At 2:37 in the morning, Dean pulled into the alley Castiel had indicated.  His heart leapt – the angel was there, his trench coat as pristine as the day they had met.
this time… well, he was
“If he stays, I am afraid I will have no choice but to leave,” Ezekiel said.
Castiel pulled out Dean’s cock a second later, clumsy and unsure.  Dean grabbed the two of them together, leaning farther into Castiel to increase the friction.  “Dean!” Castiel choked in surprise, and the angel’s hands faltered, eventually landing somewhere around Dean’s ass, pulling him closer still.
He dropped like a puppet with cut strings.
Castiel felt briefly as though a knife had sliced into his stomach, but cast the feeling aside.  He recognized it as the emotion of jealousy.  He reflected that if this was what it felt like for an angel, he never wanted to be human again.
Dean knew how Castiel thought, or, at least, he knew better than he used to.  He knew his time with Castiel was limited now that the demons and angels seemed to know about Kelly Kline.
as ‘Agent Timberlake.’”
Pain...
“Cool,” said Dean.  “Awesome.  What about… how’s Hannah?”
“So what, you think he's lying?” Sam asked.
Castiel had hoped that the Winchesters would come up with some way to trap Metatron during the prisoner exchange, but this, too, didn’t go as planned.  The prisoner exchange was successful, though, in that Castiel was reunited with the brothers, though Metatron and Gadreel escaped.
Sam nodded in agreement, looking unsteadily at Dean.  Dean approached with reservation, and Castiel understood that the two of them were about to argue, here on the side of the road in the rain.  He supposed Sam had that right.
“It was, um, it was me,” said Castiel, still in disbelief.  “But it was also…” he looked at Kelly, his eyes traveling down to her stomach.
Dean’s face gave a surprised pout, and he began, “Well that’s -…”
Amara turned toward him.  Then, in a ball of white light, they were gone.
Dean felt himself coming too quickly, and reached around to grab Castiel.  Once, twice, and the angle was awkward, but then Castiel seized up and groaned, “Dean!”  Dean was coming too, the pleasure spiraling and then releasing in an electric haze.
have new information, but… I’ve got news as well.”
Bobby opened a cooler between their chairs and took out two beers, handing one to Dean.
Water trailed off of Little Cas’ trench coat and puddled on the floor.  “Damn it, Cas!” Dean exclaimed.  “Wipe it up!”
“Well, then burn it off!” Dean snapped.  “Cut it off.”
“Cas,” Dean replied, voice low.  His breath mingled with Castiel’s, and they moved together in the space of Dean’s hand.  “We should’ve done this ages ago…”
Cas.  “Cas, how did-…”
From the original timeline I had planned for this story before I wrote it, this was when I had planned that Dean and Cas would get together for the first time.  All of the friends with benefits stuff before this sort of wrote itself.  Either way, I feel like this was the most logical time frame, mostly because there wasn’t really much of an opportunity before this, excluding Purgatory of course.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said, still trying to find his dignity.
at 8:37 PM
“Uh, yes,” Dean said, pointing toward the kitchen.  Castiel went to fetch burritos.
“God dammit Cas,” he grumbled, and Castiel looked up from his neck long enough to give him a giant grin, combined with a thrust that had Dean seeing stars.
Dean eased in slowly.  It was a tight fit – perhaps lube would be helpful after all in the future, Castiel realized.  Dean seemed to have the same thought.  He pulled almost all the way out and grabbed the abandoned lube.  When his cock went back inside, it felt less dry.
It was over more quickly than Castiel had expected, and Castiel felt the tightening in his balls and then the overwhelming pleasure as he shot down Dean’s throat.  At some point he sagged, temporarily boneless, onto the bed behind him.
said that Castiel
Prayers were unanswered.
“Yes,” said Castiel.
“Not even a little,” answered Dean.  He grabbed Castiel’s left hand just briefly with his right – not enough for Lucifer to see, but enough to greet and reassure his friend.
“Whenever I can,” she said, smiling at Castiel.
Dean moved around, lifting up before slamming down, until he found the spot that made him see fireworks behind his eyes.  It was sweaty, and messy, and
“I mean, obviously, you've changed, but it's all been for the better, man,” added Sam.
“I won’t look at any porn,” Castiel agreed.  “I don’t want to get a virus.”  He spotted John’s journal on the table.  “Can I look through that?”
Dean wasn’t a fan of chick flick moments, but an “I’m
“The kid angel?  Yeah.  Why?”
Dean’s hand slipped on the phone.  “Just, between that and that ugly coat he bought last month-…” Garth continued.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said, and Dean could tell he was telling the truth.  “My contact is an angel named Benjamin, in Maine.  He has information which he has agreed to give me.  But…”
Castiel sighed, looking at Dean.  “I thought I was saving Heaven.  I got played, too.”
“Who are you calling?” Sam asked, coming into the library where Dean was hunched over the table.
Sam was there, holding a gun to Rowena’s head, screaming.

Regarding the Basano vase auction:  the legend is real.  BUT, I’m from America and know literally nothing about euros and lira.  The vase in question sold for 4 million lira in 1988, so hopefully the conversions are right and Crowley was paying more than peanuts for it.  If it’s wrong, blame the internet.
Sam met Castiel’s eyes for only a second, then shrugged uncomfortably.  “I’m not
“I… well if angels can see it anyway, I might as well be able to see it too,” Dean said, sounding bitter.
Dean looked questioningly at him, full of accusations.
The next day at the round table, Castiel spoke up for the first time in over a week.
Castiel rolled his eyes, but raised his hand and caused the small amount of water already collected in the bottom of the jacuzzi to more than triple.
been nice.
“She returned to Heaven,” Castiel said.  “She felt guilty for continuing to remain in her vessel.  The vessel, Caroline, had a life of her own, and Hannah allowed her to return to that life.”
“No, dude,” Dean said to Castiel, and he felt a slight spike of annoyance that he didn’t understand.
Castiel remembered how much he had desired intercourse when he had been human.  It had led him to sleep with April, even though he really only wanted Dean.  Humans were strong, but they were weak, too.  “A month,” Castiel said.  “Only because I wouldn’t want you to stake your happiness on me if I’m unable to return.
The angels around him began to murmer, and Castiel guiltily looked at the floor.  He couldn’t look at Dean, who knew, now, that he was dying.
Castiel wasn’t sure how long it had been since he’d been on Earth, but he knew it had been too long.  He heard Dean’s prayers.
“Besides, I’ve been in the bunker for long enough,” Castiel finished.  “I can’t stick around to -…”
They stood, just inside the house, waiting.
“Yeah,” Dean said, still feeling whiplash.  “No problem, man.”
There was a long list of survivors of various monsters that asked to speak with Dean to give him their thanks and praise for the rest of their lives, however long that had been.
He didn’t think, but simply swallowed Castiel in his mouth, from tip to base.
Lucifer had taken possession of Castiel in the cage.
Dean grabbed a small amount of lube for good measure, coating himself.  He pushed all the way in slowly, then gave Castiel time to adjust before thrusting in earnest.  Castiel made a minor adjustment so that Dean was hitting the right spot, and let out a loud groan.
“Don’t drive to the Hollywood sign,” Dean interjected.
“Dean!” Castiel moaned, and he began to move, one hand on the side of the jacuzzi for extra leverage.
She looked toward the ever-present patron currently sitting at the bar and smiled.  “Hey.”
“I’m the one who will have to watch you murder the world,” said Castiel fiercely.  “So if there’s even a small chance we can save you, I won’t let you walk out of this room.”
The phrases were thrown around sometimes at gatherings or late at night when they had been drinking.
Castiel called later that day and visited three days after that, though he only stayed for one night.  The odd phone call was never discussed, and Dean grew even more suspicious.
“Crowley, you’ve got two seconds to tell me what this is about before I put even more holes in your meat suit,” he said gruffly.
Dean didn’t hear from Castiel again for nearly a month.  Castiel had no phone of his own, so Dean had to hope that he could make it to the bunker.  Dean reasoned that despite the fact that Castiel would be dealing with human things for the first time, he was still a good fighter – a warrior, even.  Castiel had also been living on Earth for a decent amount of time, another advantage he would have over his angry angelic brothers and sisters.  He would know to get an Enochian tattoo, and if things got bad enough on the “dealing with humanity” front, he knew Dean’s number.
“Perhaps we should add some conditions to our commitment,” added Castiel, wanting to clarify this conversation which was obviously so important to Dean.
“Yes,” Sam said, his eyes lighting up in his overly tall frame.
Trigger warning for brief mentions of rape.  This won’t be mentioned for the rest of the fic, don’t worry.  Please don't be angry with me.
Castiel was still smiling.
” was okay.  Maybe even “
“Have you done this before?” asked Castiel in his rough voice, blue eyes looking concerned.
Justin nodded.  “Interesting,” he said, but he wrinkled his nose.
Castiel magicked his clothes away, then used a small amount of lube as well as his grace to prep himself perfunctorily.  Dean followed his actions with his eyes fluttering open and closed, until Castiel’ finally pulled his mouth off of Dean’s cock with a loud
“I know,” said Dean miserably.  “I know.  Okay?  Whatever it is, a... attraction, connection... I got to tell you, man, it scares me.   I don't know that I can stop it.  I don't know that I can resist it.”
Green eyes met blue, then, and Dean looked for something that Castiel couldn’t identify.  Finally, he nodded and walked over to the angel, once again looking away.
to go with Castiel.  But it would mean that, yet again, he and Castiel would be separated.  Yet again, duty before happiness.
As Castiel and Justin continued to talk, Dean eyed the drink that was on the table in front of him.  Perhaps it was time for some liquid courage.  He didn’t recognize it – it looked like champagne, but with a silver tinge.
Dean held onto either side of Castiel, though he wasn’t sure whether or not his intention was to keep Castiel from thrusting into his mouth or to make him do so.  In the end, Castiel squirmed and gave tiny thrusts into Dean’s mouth in his own odd compromise.  It wasn’t exactly a pleasant sensation, and certainly not one Dean was used to.  And yet, it quenched some abandoned thirst inside of him to take and be taken.  It didn’t take long, and Dean felt the telltale signs of Castiel’s release.  Dean sucked harder, and took what the angel gave him (which would’ve surprised him, if he’d given it absolutely any thought).
Castiel?
Once they arrived, T.L. headed to a different corner of the room, but Castiel could still feel the man’s eyes on him.
He missed Castiel almost as much as he missed Sam.  He had had two months, now, to remember every touch, every drawn-out look between the two of them…
“And maybe that's the problem,” said Sam.  “I mean, people have been doing messed up crap in the name of faith -- in the name of God -- since forever.”
Dean appeared to think about this for a second, then asked, “What are you saying?”
“They’re real,” breathed Castiel a few seconds later.  He recognized the hint of magic coming from the staff and the rod.  More importantly, he recognized them from Heaven.  He wondered how they had wound up here, of all places.
“That’s wonderful!” said Justin and Tyler at once, and they both resumed discussion about the items that might be for sale at the auction.  Dean relaxed into silent indignation at Castiel’s attitude.
“Castiel!” Dean heard Sam exclaim.  “You’re alive!”
He wondered sometimes, though, if what they had was something different from friendship, or possibly much more.  Castiel had pulled him out of Hell.  He had rebelled for him, and died for him,
“Both,” he answered.
spent a lot of time referring to angels as “dicks with wings.”  He still did, sometimes.
“They’re having sex, Cas,” Dean said, exasperated.  As usual, his own anatomy had decided to respond.  He was turned on, and confused, and annoyed.
Dean looked at his watch.  If Crowley had been right about the Angel Amore wearing off after six hours, he had perhaps thirty minutes left.  Perhaps a shower was in order.
“So?  I've never had powers,” Dean argued.  He hadn’t seen Castiel in weeks, after all – weeks which he had spent reminding himself that non-platonic intentions aside, Castiel was still his best friend.  Additionally, Castiel was helpful on a hunt even without his powers.  Finally, Dean was morbidly curious about how Castiel’s date was going to go.  Perhaps it would be terrible.  (Dean hoped so.)
Dean was distracted by the feeling of his own boxers being removed.  The friction as they caught on his cock on the way down was heavenly, and he gave a half-hearted groan.  Cas’ mouth was on him the next second, and Dean gave an aborted thrust in surprise.  “Cas, I thought…” he began, but Castiel smiled, his mouth still full, and gave a low hum of contentment.
“What’s he done now?” asked Dean.  Little Cas had been doing very well lately.  He’d been back at Garth’s for the weekend, and, Dean knew, should be arriving at the bunker any minute.
Disbelief changed to incredulity, and Dean slid home, causing both of them to groan with the spike in pleasure.
“I don't even know where to start,” he said.
“I'm on it,” Castiel said with a smile.
at 10:04 PM
“And the last time you had this kind of juice, you did kill humans and angels, and you did nothing but lie to me and Sam about it the whole damn time!”  Dean knew he was making a scene, but he couldn’t help it.  He should’ve come earlier, whether Castiel liked it or not.  He was long past controlling his anger – actually, he was pretty sure that ability had died with Abaddon.  It had taken a lot of power to kill her.  If Dean was being honest with himself, he was sure her demise had unlocked something inside of him, something to do with the Mark.
There was silence for a few seconds, and then Dean added, “When
“Yeah, well, Purgatory will do that to you,” said Dean, attempting nonchalance.
When he righted himself somewhat, Castiel was still spasming around him with little aftershocks.  He thrusted once into the hot heat, and then his own orgasm hit him with full force. He came,
(See the end of the chapter for
“All right, you know what, Zeke?”  Dean snapped.  “Level with me.  What is it that you're so afraid of?”
control the Mark, you must see that.”
Dean slammed back to Earth.  It wasn’t over.  Still confused, he was the last one to reach his friend’s side.  Somehow he was surprised to see black goo flowing from Castiel’s mouth.
Dean headed to the passenger side of Castiel’s truck, and the angel slid in beside him.  “If you’re wanting to ‘explore the sights,’ there’s a bar two blocks over that I think-…”
(See the end of the chapter for
Except now they held hands.
“Oh,” Castiel said.  He did a quick sweep of Dean’s room with his senses and located the Colt under his pillow.  He wouldn’t be able to take it now… he would have to come back later.  Dejected, he turned to go.
Dean looked at his friend.  His eyes were wide and jet-black, and he could see the pain on his friends’ face.
The blind shock and panic filling Dean allowed a few relevant thoughts to flow to the surface in his head.  He took out his gun, but didn’t raise it.  “Salt… silver,” said Dean absently, and Castiel nodded, leaving the bathroom to get the required items.
“I missed you too,” Castiel said, his breath quickening as he thrust toward Dean in spite of himself.  He knew this was Dean’s way of saying “I love you,” and for now, it was enough.
There were women, as well, after Purgatory.  None of them were quite Castiel, but it didn’t really matter, because Castiel was gone anyway.
But, it was all for naught.  Dagon recaptured Kelly, and Eileen accidentally shot and killed Renny in the ensuing chaos.  Afterward, Eileen decided to go under the radar and return to Ireland to escape from the British Men of Letters, who were sure to be after her for killing one of their own.
Still, the two had no choice but to follow T.L. back to the ballroom.
Still, eventually, the pool of monsters had dwindled.  There would always be random vampires, werewolves, and djinn, of course.  But they no longer seemed to have any inclination to mobilize, or create diabolical plans to end the world.  To put it plainly, as he had pointed out to Sam a year ago, the monsters had become lazy.
They had a bit more time than usual, Dean knew.  Everything had been drawn to the location of their fight with the leviathans, and they had run fast enough and far enough to get ahead of anything chasing them.  “Gonna try something,” Dean said, yanking down Castiel’s pants just far enough to be safe.
Dean looked anywhere but at Castiel.  He said quietly, “Yeah, man, I get it.  You’re right.  I mean, we’ve both got other priorities that come first even though we-… care for each other.”
“He was warded when April found him, and she killed him,” Ezekiel replied.
And yet.
Sometimes Benny would put his arm around Dean in a friendly way.  (“I’ve been here before, and you’re in for a treat, Brother,” he said, guiding Dean over to a clump of bushes with leaves that he promised were not only edible, but quite tasty.)
“Good,” Dean said, rolling away from Castiel to go to sleep.  He added, “Thanks, Cas.”
, you will be free to return to Heaven whenever you like.”
of trailing Lucifer with Crowley and now they were back to square one.
But this was real, no longer a dream.  He didn’t want to kill Dean.  Naomi was screaming in his head.  And Castiel was advancing on Dean.  He no longer had control of his vessel…
was better.  Castiel moved one hand between them to grab Dean’s neglected cock, and Dean could feel himself spiraling out of control.  His orgasm hit him forcefully and he felt himself clench around Castiel’s cock as he came all over both of their stomachs.  Castiel wasn’t far behind, and Dean could feel the angel spasm.  His eyes caught Dean’s as he groaned out his climax.
He sighed.  “Cas, I’m not mad.  I mean, I’m irritated, but… I understand why you hid it.”
“I have to go,” Castiel said.  “Samandriel's remains belong in Heaven.”  He crouched down by Samandriel’s body and put his arm around his shoulders.
“If we do this… you’re sure we don’t need…” Dean began.
, there was that threesome with the double-mint twins-…
The following pause was way too long for Dean’s taste.  Finally, Castiel said, “Sometimes, I still don’t.”
“Hey, Cas, wait a second,” said Sam.  “Wait, hold on, just-…”
going to sleep with her, are you?” Sam asked him from across the restaurant table as he and the waitress continued to smile and wave at each other.
much.  Besides, he’d see Castiel again – he always did.
, Sam had enrolled in school again.  He had finished his Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice, passed the bar exam, and was now attending law school through the University of Kansas.  Most of his credits were online rather than in person, but Dean often wondered if that decision had been at least partially because Sam didn’t want to “abandon” him.
Dean blanched at the mention of his mistakes.  “What about-?”
Castiel knew that Dean was referring to having beat him up while Dean had been under the influence of the Mark.  He supposed that, in some way, refusing to let Castiel try to heal his injuries allowed Dean to forgive himself for his own transgressions.  For that reason, Castiel allowed it.

Dean was instantly more sober than he’d been in months (probably something to do with the lightning).  With his sobriety was the realization that Sam and Castiel had done something truly
“Our bond is stronger, more meaningful,” Castiel said, looking proud now.  “And not as easily broken.”
“Or,” Dean added, clearly hit with another idea.  “Like, for you, if you had a Naomi situation, where you were being mind-controlled by other angels.”
“Dean, I want-…” Castiel breathed, and Dean fully agreed.
“Okay,” Castiel said, sighing.
Both men had lapsed into a brief silence, watching a man shooting arrows on the screen.  Then at the same time, they said, “Damn, that’s sweet!”
“Speaking of which,” Dean interrupted, trying to seem smooth.  He wasn’t hoping for anything, but he was morbidly curious.  “I see that you’re… into chicks now.”
Perhaps it wouldn’t be that bad, being bonded to an angel.  The bond didn’t seem to have to affected him negatively.
He was certain that they had connected with each other in Purgatory, and that something had been brewing between them for quite a long time… so why did Castiel seem so disgusted?
He’d like to say that he was drunk when he used Death’s own scythe to kill him, but honestly that decision was because he had spent so long defending his brother that he literally couldn’t do anything else, even to save the world.
missed call, at 8:36 PM
Castiel was not on the list.
Finally, Sam called Castiel in mid-August with news about Dean.  “Cas...  Dean’s a demon.”

“You’re not
Happily, to a man.  Which Dean might’ve had, if he hadn’t been such a-
Nope.
Again, Dean’s heart soared.
Then the noises started – the usual long groans and panting.
Castiel gave Dean a slightly shocked look, but even the angel recognized the urgency in this.  It was not only Dean, after all, who had been in Purgatory for months on end.  Castiel, too, had fallen victim to base instincts he hadn’t even known he had, down here cut off from Heaven in the land of the monsters.
Season 12, Part 3
Castiel obediently parked the Impala under a row of trees, but shot a sidelong look at Dean.  “Why---ggggaah!”  Dean had grabbed his slightly-flagging erection, causing the angel to start and bump his head against the back of the seat.  Dean massaged Castiel’s groin, kneading slowly, and Castiel continued to let out little groans as his gaze turned fully toward Dean.
said his brother Kyniel, who had been one of Metatron’s right hands.  “
Dean had wrapped his legs around Castiel while they were making out, but the angel gently urged his legs up higher.  He lightly brushed his palms across Dean’s ass, resituating him, and Dean felt the familiar tingling of grace – an angelic sort of prep.  He felt minutely less nervous.
Dean could feel the anger begin to leak out of him.
For one second, Castiel saw Dean hesitate.  For one short second, Castiel saw love in Dean’s eyes, nights spent in each other’s arms…
Castiel looked up and smiled, gesturing at him to sit down.
So that was his play.  Castiel had thought as much.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” Cas said huskily, but he thrusted upward with a low groan.  Castiel gently placed a hand on Dean’s face, and Dean leaned into Castiel’s palm, the bruise on his cheek faded enough now not to hurt.
“Wait, you’re – you’re back?” Dean asked.  “You got your mojo?”
“Lovely!” said T.L. Laurant.  “I’d hate for you to miss out on the dancing.  I know you said when we emailed how much you
bond?”  He felt panicked, as though everything he had ever known was being ripped away from him.  He should’ve known this thing with Castiel wasn’t
Also, Dean had to pee.  Moreover, he realized that he simply missed Castiel.  That was probably due to the aphrodisiac.
“You have to choose, Castiel -- us or them,” Naomi said fiercely.
It was well into April, nearly two months, before Dean saw Lucifer or Castiel again.
Dean spent some time taking a drive in the impala.  He was excited to find out that there was a sort of “viewing station” on a bridge nearby where he could look in on how Sam was doing amongst the still living.
“Well, you, me, and a demon knife ain't gonna cut it,” commented Dean.
At that point Dean couldn’t
“Cas, I…” Dean started, and Castiel exploded, his vision whiting out at the edges and his spine snapping to attention.
,” he said.  “What’s that like?”
“What?” said Dean in surprise.
“Don't say that, man,” said Sam.
“Right,” Claire snapped, but she was genuine when she added softly, “Thanks, Castiel.”  Then she shut the door in his face.
Castiel’s eyes darkened.  “You’re sure you’re up for that?” he asked carefully.
But then, there was Dean.  There were his green eyes, and the feel of him on top of and inside Castiel, and the nights spent in Purgatory talking.  He had rebuilt Dean’s body, rescued his soul, and they were bonded in ways that Castiel knew Dean didn’t even understand.
“What?” asked Sam, looking at Dean’s face.
Dean’s hand hit something warm, and then Castiel scrambled backward, wearing his usual “dressed-down” gear that involved pants, socks, and a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up.
“Stop saying you don't know!” said Dean irritably.  His mood had been getting worse every day since he’d taken on the Mark of Cain, and sometimes he felt like he was on a roller coaster that he couldn’t get off of.  If he was honest, he had hoped that Castiel might have answers or offer help, but it seemed he was too busy with his Metatron “organization.”
“Oh, and tonight – 7:00 at my place work for you?”
Castiel didn’t have a ride to his date, so Dean drove him.  He even gave Castiel dating advice.  It went against every bone in his body, but he wanted his friend to be happy, after all.
Dean found Castiel working at a Gas N’ Sip.  “I'll have some beef jerky and a pack of menthols,” Dean said, walking up to the Gas N’ Sip counter.
He would never understand cosmic deities.
“I’ve been working with him on the angel trials,” Castiel answered.
“If Crowley's got that many hell monkeys outside, he's got to have at least double inside,” Dean commented, his heart sinking.  So much for getting some alone time with Cas.
“But thinking of sex with someone else where both of us partake – perhaps both of us worship your body – seems to be somewhat arousing.”
Talking right now went against everything in Dean’s nature, but he had a bad feeling that he wasn’t going to get another chance.  Still, time stretched on and Dean said nothing.
It was another good reason that Benny and Sam had to stay away from each other – Benny simply knew too much.
As it turned out, however, Dean saw Castiel the next day.  He had made it back to the bunker after (according to Castiel) being tortured by a group of angels for answers about the Darkness.  He looked even worse than Dean felt, which was saying something.  His eyes were bloodshot and red, and he cautioned the brothers that he was still suffering from the effects of Rowena’s beast spell.
He had hoped that when he became this weak he could tear out his grace and become human, but he learned to his dismay that this was not an option.  According to one of the large books at the bunker, his grace would have needed to be his own, and whole, for the procedure.  He had had a chance when Metatron removed his grace, but now that he had tainted himself with the grace of another, he was doomed to die an angel.
Castiel began to say, “Me too,” but it was cut off with a growl because Dean had just thrusted into him, sending electricity once again up his spine.  “Dean!” he exclaimed.
“Is anyone?  Ever?” Dean retorted.
“Uh… yeah, why?” Dean asked.
“I’ll know it,” said Castiel.
“Shut up jerk,” said Sam, grinning as he tucked the phone back into his jacket.  “And yes.  Sorry about that.”
The hunting hadn’t changed immediately afterward.  If anything, there had been
When their lips met, it felt like coming home.  Dean’s lips were chapped but soft, and Castiel melted into them.  He had wanted this, of course, but never believed that it would’ve been possible without the Angel Amore.
Castiel looked so much like a kicked puppy that Dean relented, at least slightly.  “I know, man.  You’re sure you’re free of her?”
When they had caught up with Castiel outside the warehouse, however, he was cradling Samandriel’s dead body.  “Cas!” Sam exclaimed.  “What the hell happened?”
Castiel could barely hear anything over the thrumming of his veins.
Quickly, Dean collected himself and turned back to Castiel.  After all, he had no claim on the angel – he himself had made sure of that.  “That's what this is about!” he accused Castiel.
“You don’t have to do this,” said Castiel.
“It depends on what type of ‘thing’ you’re asking about,” replied Castiel after a pause.  He knew Dean didn’t want Sam to know that the two of them had had sex, but he also didn’t want to lie outright.
Finally, Dean tried a new tactic.  Castiel felt Dean’s hands leave his hips and knew what Dean had planned a split second before pleasure shot up his spine.  Dean grabbed Castiel’s thick cock, wrapping his fingers around the base and pumping, double the pace that Castiel had kept.
and more…
“This is it?” Kelly asked as they approached the sandbox.
She moved closer to him.  “You

And now Castiel had risked
did bad things when he left home.
I?  Put that limey on the line!”
Dean resituated slightly, making sure the table cloth hung down over his now prominent erection and Castiel’s hand. Their backs were to the wall, so the likelihood of them being seen was very little.  As the price for the demon knife went up, Castiel continued his ministrations.  He faced straight front and didn’t look at Dean, but his small concentrated smile let Dean know that the angel was still mostly focused on him.  Dean sank down farther in his seat to give Castiel more room, and, with a careful look around him, closed his eyes briefly, allowing the pleasure to wash over him fully.
“Well, now, don’t get smart with me, boy-…”
“Yes, and you brought him back, and I thank you for that, but this is Cas, okay, who vouched for you when I didn't know you from Jack.  The bunker is safe,” Dean insisted.
Now he was tied up and caught in a Devil’s Trap in the bunker’s dungeon, and Sam was performing the healing ritual.
Castiel ended the call abruptly with, “Goodbye.  It may be some time before we see one another again.”
It wouldn’t honestly be so bad if Castiel hadn’t been in love with his charge for as long as he could remember.
Dean pushed Castiel backward into the bed and straddled him, pausing to pull off his jacket and then his shirt.  Castiel did the same to Dean, and kissed up Dean’s neck, tugging on the bottom of his ear with his teeth.  Dean reveled in the feel of Castiel, hard and solid and
“Okay,” Dean relented, taking the tablet from his bag.  “In that case, if you’re really going to close Heaven, you’ll need access to the angel tablet and the prophet.  He’s at the bunker now.”
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed,” said Sam, smiling, “but Dean doesn’t show emotions like a normal person.  Whenever he feels a negative emotion, he just gets angry.  And the Mark isn’t helping.”
Dean felt as though his stomach had dropped through the floor.  “Look, Cas,” Dean said, standing up finally and facing the angel.  “I know how I feel.  That’s not it.  I don’t…”
Dean cast around for something they hadn’t already tried.  He’d had Castiel in every position, on every surface in the bunker with the exception of Sam’s bed.  This included the table in the situation room, and a blow job in the dungeon.  It was
Sam knew better than to protest.
“I missed you, Dean,” Castiel whispered into the darkness.
Castiel said “Just because-…”
Sighing, Dean looked around.  There were quite a few couples crowding the dance floor.  Three couples stood in front of the door to the auction items, where they were being held back by uniformed men.  One couple was attempting to sneak upstairs.
again.
“Of course, Dean,” Castiel said, reaching his hand out to put it on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean slept with a few women but still couldn’t shake the thought of Castiel’s eyes.  This managed to both piss him off and make him feel slightly guilty, which he ignored.
much better.
“Dean?” Sam’s voice reached him as though through a haze.
Castiel had known he was strong, but the strength of Cain surprised even him.  It had progressed too far… Dean was gone now, leaving only the crazed look of a murderer and the Mark shining on his arm.
