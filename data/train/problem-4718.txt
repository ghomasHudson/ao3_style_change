“No, you need Iron Man and you need money.” Stark holds out his arms to expose his disheveled clothing. “This is the cost. You knew it going in. Even wrote a report on it.”
Her posture subtly changes, it’s her training taking over but her voice betrays her. It’s low and scratchy, angry. “I can have you grounded whenever I want Stark, you’ve given me enough reasons, but you are not leaving me to do this alone. If you aren’t going to show up to fix this mess then why should I? You’re not the only one with better offers.”
Tony’s eyes swing from Steve to Rhodes. “I know Platypus, I hate them too. Mostly on your behalf and only a bit because I have to constantly hear how much you hate them.”
Banner paused as if considering it, then shook his head. “I’m sorry for bailing but I won’t risk it.”
Steve's eyes were feverish in their intensity. “You don’t deserve Hell either, Tony. You’re a better man than you used to be.”
Steve keeps talking. “I found out about Kovalchyk by accident. I thought I owed you.” He places a glass of Francesca’s homemade lemonade on the edge of the table as a peace offering.
Have a chapter where Steve and Tony behave super similarly and neither recognizes it. This is the most violent this fic gets, it's all up/downhill from here. I like to think Steve is
With one more nod, Sam took to the air and flew beyond the dark horizon. Steve and Tony stood in quiet for what had to be much too long when Tony found the words he was looking for.
Sam was quiet still following her through the food line. Natasha was waiting to pay before she bit the hook.
“I am uncomfortable with how much authority he has over you, but it is not something that hinders my infatuation.”
Bucky pushes himself off the pillar to come and lean against Steve his head resting on the mans shoulder. Steve breathed him in and something minuscule took root and calmed.
Dummy bumped against his leg nearly knocking him down. Steve gently touched a hand to his little claw that opened and closed around his pointer finger.
“Yeah, alright.” Bruce said on a deep yawn stretching and revealing he'd been wearing nothing but his cloak. His rather pudgy middle was beginning to round out Tony noticed pulling him up.
“My apologies, Lord Stark.” Sam said. “He was three towns off when he met a man by the name of Wrotty. I have a feeling it was the name you gave him that triggered Mr. Stane, sir.”
“Fight’s over.” She said her voice low but projected over the crowd. There were screams of anguish as some rich boys realized they just lost their entire allowance because a six foot six behemoth couldn’t take out five foot five and a hundred pounds soaking wet Bruce Banner. Natasha pulled Bruce gently and firmly away from the sophomore. She raised his hand. Bruce wiped his nose which was bleeding a little. He hunched in on himself again and just like that was the biology geek that Tony befriended in the eighth grade. Tony smiled. The boys who won came to collect their bounty knowing that the house always takes ten percent.
"If you'll excuse me I have to take a leak before I ruin these pants." Clint said taking off in the opposite direction. He heard Bucky follow him and just undid his pants his back towards the tavern and sweet release opposite.
“I did see the other guy. He’s currently in the infirmary.” Bucky said his lips brushing against Clint’s ear so he could feel every word.
“It’s a quick read.” Natasha agreed walking back to the dorms. Sam kept pace with her. She was surprised by his patience. She wasn’t as reticent over text.
Bruce opened and closed his mouth. “I can not bear children this will not be a fruitful relationship, Lord Thor. It would be best if you walked right out that door and never looked back.”
Tony found the body covered in blood and his heart nearly stopped. It was a rush when the part of his brain that remembered seeing people torn apart could associate that blood with this. He shook the body only to be shocked. He dropped his hand. Thor. This was Thor. The man sat up. He wiped blood from his face, eyes sparked with excitement. Or insanity. Tony couldn’t tell.
“Steve,” Tony tried again. The other alphas backed off because Tony had waved them off. He recognized some of them and knew who they were worried about.
They weren’t here. Once his hand was covered in blood proper in etched their figures on the closest object. The rough tree bark cut into his fingers.
Bruce grit his teeth. He looked at the water rushing past, pulling at his legs and knees wanting to drag him down the river. He could let go. Children don’t need murderers.
“Or take down the hypermasculine system that was promised to us by murdering capitalism.” Tony said with a shrug.
Tony jeered the crowd and raised the numbers Clint left with five hundred. Bruce left with a grand and Natasha was sold once for six hundred and then for the second while Tony roused the crowd shouting and talking a bang cut off all noise.
Tony wrinkled his nose and looked over Tommy’s shoulder to see if he could see any of his cohorts. Tommy’s hand snaked surprisingly around his throat and forced him to make eye contact.
Clint pushed a hand through his hair. “What could it possibly look like Bucky? We've been sleeping together for months and Ive never once asked you about this shit. I ask once and suddenly our entire relationship is a lie?”
Steve walked back into the dining room only to find Tony gone and Clint and Bucky staring into pure oblivion. The fresh mating bite clearly visible above Clint's tunic warmed Steve. Bucky had been talking of nothing but since they met back up all those months ago.
The wolf growled but sat. The second largest of the bunch shifted and Tony refused to step back as an angel approached him. May the Father have mercy. Shifters have died to reach that level of perfection.
Steve’s anger crumbles to pity. “Bucky’s moving out, he told me this morning. You can’t stop him.” Tony winces. “He’s leaving, I’m not.”
The last whole blossom Tony coughs up is in November after weeks of only stray petals. It’s a tiny, white poppy, malnourished and wilting. The stubby roots trail behind having found no purchase in the flesh below. It is the last, lonely, pitiful flower on the vine; a late bloomer. It is still beautiful though, and it would have made for the most beautiful, senseless death.
FRIDAY only lets him out once the Belgians have come through. Special forces hit the HYDRA contingent on a rural highway 48 hours after leaving Antwerp. No casualties. It takes them a week to comb through the acquired intel and hand copies over to the Avengers but it happens. A perfect, politically-correct, hands-off success. They won’t always be so lucky.
” Tony’s head lolled towards him. “The difference between you and me, is we both already knew I was capable of terrible things. You didn’t know you had it in you,” his gaze fluttered to Steve, “and now you do.”
“His other half was adamant on killing the bad man.” Tony conceded. “The beast is all basic instincts. Protect, Pack, and Eat. Nice fellow actually.”
Bruce smiled and switched over to Tonys bench so that they could lean against each other. “At least we are wretch's together.”
Clint relaxed into him shifting his legs so not all his weight sat on them and letting Bucky take his bulk.
Steve shrugged. Fair enough. Beta’s could be packless and non-feral they also tended to hold most neutral based jobs with in any form of government. They rarely made a pack as filled with alpha’s as this one bat an eyelash.
That was obvious. Natasha tilted her head in acknowledgement. She wasn’t in the mood to talk to someone who might be planning to hurt them.
His dorm room door banged open. Tony looked over his shoulder and nodded at Natasha before returning to his show. Natasha slammed his laptop closed. Tony followed her arm up to her eyes. He sat up.
A familiar set of red riding shoes walked between Dummy’s sock and his rock. “That may have been the ugliest I’ve ever seen you get, Clint.” Natasha said her voice droll.
He looked up from his paper airplane and met everyone’s eyes. “What? I’m foreign, people think I do not know what’s happening.”
Bruce blushed and seemed to leave the conversation all together to hide his face. Bucky inched behind him to stand next to Clint.
Bucky paused with him. "I'll help you so we can finish in half the time and spend more time on the range.
Bucky nodded taking the few steps to the counter and placing his own elbow on it. He mirrored Clint, making the man smile.
That night Steve called the entire pack in for a meeting. Clint and Bucky had a baby each, Tony sat tinkering with a clock, Thor was leaning over his chair so that he could touch Bruce who was looking mildly ill, Sam and Natasha were staring at Bruce waiting for him to say something, what? Steve didn't know.
“So, we’ve heard,” Steven said. “Do you know anyone in the school who might want to permanently harm Stark?”
Bucky looked away from Clint, his shoulders shaking and a smile sneaking across his face. Clint flicked him and swallowed dramatically.
“Very well.” Tony said his words muffled by the other man’s lips. Steve grinned down into the next press of lips.
Bruce hummed and the two fell silent. The tinkling of the water over stones and the hush of the steamer being filled.
Clint stood his stance wide and face bare. "I heard somethings that you would not have because my presence was not considered a threat. The Hammer and Stane pack had such low views of what an omega is that it would take a miracle for that man to have so many alphas in his pack that from what I suspect was blessed by the gods."
“Tony.” Natasha said slumping down on the bed next to him. “If I’m correct this is about three million dollars stolen from our peers and teachers.”
Clint panted and felt Bucky finally release him. He licked around Clint's open wound and that just won't do. Clint grabbed his face with both hands and dragged him in for a rough and bloody kiss.
Clint was sweaty naked and very pleased with himself. The grassy knoll was soft Bucky had his one arm covered over his eyes like he'd just seen the Father himself. Clint would have to worry about their clothes and the come covering his body at a later time. At the moment he was content laying in the grass staring at Bucky and trying to quiet the children in his belly.
Clint and Bucky were standing in the middle of the woods arguing when they saw the group leave the school.
"I've bedded plenty of people before, during, and after being mated. That's not much of a challenge then, is it, wishful angel?"
Clint clenched his fists. "You've found me. You know where to find me. Shouldn't you leave for whatever has need of a militia pack?"
"Mr. Barton," Tony barked. "While I am sympathetic to your motivations my, my, automatons are gone, and it would be best for you to leave so I can handle one problem at a time."
“Don't pester them, Nat, Bruce isn't pregnant and Tony doesn't want kids.” He said just as one of his began screaming.
Tony crawled under one of the tables and picked up a box marked junk then delicately pulled out a small automaton in pieces and placed on the table. Steve felt the blood drain from his face.
Bruce was sleeping cheek cupped in his hand a very red very new mating mark showing through the lazily thrown on cloak he wore. Clint was quiet holding both of the pups to him as close as possible and bouncing his knee nervously. Natasha and Same were next to him arms across his back as a safety net.
“If I had a taste, I fear I may go mad if I never had a sip again. But, perhaps, you are projecting your own needs upon me.”
Clint waved away whatever he was going to say. “Whatever. Things have been unusually aggressive and that’s saying something considering this is a fighting ring of four people who the school want to kick their asses.”
Bruce’s arm stopped. He got it. Was he the one screaming? Bruce let go of Blonsky’s hair. He spat on the floor next to the other boy. Blonsky was still screaming information. Bruce couldn’t really hear him. He checked his surroundings. There were a lot of scared kids. Fisk was holding a bleeding arm to his chest. Bruce spat again. He couldn’t see through one eye. He touched his forehead and felt the viscousness of blood.
Clint's hand drifted down the metal key clacking with the wood he sanded himself while Bruce wasn't looking. One of the kids that had been rough while he chatted with Natasha kicked again and he rubbed the area. They had set up a chair so he wouldn't have to stand while at the desk, but it still felt like his feet were about to implode. With that in mind, was he well?
"Ah." It was common practice that all high-ranking military officers sit with each other rather than with their units unless shifted and in combat. "I can do that easily."
Steve licked his lips thinking. “Yeah, I’ll help just give me as much information on your regulars as possible.”
There it was that sinking hopeless feeling. Tony opened his desk and reached for his whiskey. He poured himself a glass and was surprised by how little there was. Had he really drank that much last night?
The sun drifted through the windows and the shadows grew longer across the floor. Steve brought him food while he tinkered and they sat companionably, Steve switching between reading and drawing whenever he saw fit. Tony left a few times to grab other clocks and watches and then Jarvis at one point just to check his joints. Once it was time to light candles Steve got tense. It was a trickling emotion slowly crossing over onto Bucky being the second alpha and then onto Thor all of them twitching and their wolves on the edge of their skin.
Tony shook his muzzle and then nipped Clint's thigh before getting down to shift back. Clint yelled jerking his legs up to his chest.
Fo once he did not try to take over the conversation instead letting them flow around him while he fiddled with the clock he’d had earlier when Captain Rodgers had been in his office. It was a warm edge but there was something missing. Then Bruce walked in Thor behind with a huge bowl of stew and then the bonds between them tightened.
"He won't even notice you," Bruce said turning back to the stove and settling the flame. "Take him his meal. Make sure he tries to eat. And come back with whatever is left of lunch."
Tony couldn’t look at him and the air caught in his lungs. The Lady’s voice ringing in his head. Did he trust this man? He heard Steve walk closer and crouch down in front of him. Warm hands on his legs finally gave him the ability to look at the other man. He smiled wanly.
Steve stretched out his joints. He hadn't shifted in nearly a week and he needed to warm into the change.
They exchanged looks and the taller of the two answered. “You wouldn’t happen to know about the Stane and Hammer pack massacre that happened oh about three days ride from here.”
“We’ll do a pencil test to see if you can maintain human grip pressures,” Tony said handing him a pencil. Bucky took it and he could almost but not quite feel the charcoal and wood beneath the metal.
"Tree branch," Tony answered flapping his hand and dismissing Steve once again. He turned to Thor and placed a hand on his chest tender. "Do you feel something?"
Natasha typed her number quickly in. “Now leave me alone.” She said her voice like the snap of a tree branch.
Tony laughed. “I was in the hospital and my parents didn’t even come to visit. They can not possibly think that will work.”
Tony stared at the omega on the other side of the boarding house. He'd been staring at Jarvis when he thought Tony wasn't looking. Large brown eyes partially concealed with salt and pepper black hair. Tony was charmed. Jarvis clanked his legs against the other side of the table appearing not to notice his admirer.
Tony set out two rooms for the others while he spent an entire week getting the metal and mapping out the layout of the bathrooms. The next week was spent building the pipe work from the well to the house and when he got the sink in the kitchen to work he was able to transfer that to the rest of the building. The third week was installing the runes to heat the water and to cool it. The fourth week midway through helping Tony set the walls over the pipes in the second floor Clint vomited on Tony's shoes.
“Bruce,” he hissed. No response. Tony checked his eyes and found them dilated. Shit. Tony raised his hand and slapped him.
Bucky clapped him on the shoulder. "Don't speak like that. You're our fearless leader. What would we do without you?"
“You are both a brilliant scientist and a hellish warrior, that’s a win from where I’m from. We’ll raise ferocious children.”
Clint gently patted Bucky's cheek. “You aren't you're making sure you get to stay here and see what Thing one and Thing two end up looking like when their thirty.”
"And so? I was in a militia. Do you not think-?" Clint's clenched his fists and walked out of the room roughly pulling off his clothes. "It's because I didn't need a pack. Because I'm an omega or whatever thoughts plagued you about what war would do to me." He sat down heavily ripping off his shoes. "It's the heats and the lack of control. No. I know why. I do. It's not the Captain. Never him." He threw a shoe at Bucky's head in the archway. "It comes back to you and the Wilsons leaving me. Note or no." Clint shifted and kicked off his pants. He hissed at nothing his claws digging into the wood flooring. Then he was off and into the woods. Bucky wound up his fist and punched a wall. He threw off his clothes, his skin rippling into fur and began the hunt.
The omegas outburst brought Steve's eyes to him and the world stopped. He was hunched over a pile of brittle metal meticulously chipping away at the inside, smudges of charcoal and ash over his face and small burns littering arms. His hair was plastered to his face in sweat and he'd taken off his shirt in favor of just a pair of low hanging trousers.
The taverns common area was crowded, noisy, and restless. It took near a century to wave down a bar maiden and get his orders to the kitchen. It was in the millennium of waiting for his food to get to the table that he felt a hand slide up his thigh. Tony saw red and flicked his wristlet unbuckling it so it could transform into a gun. He pointed it at the other man’s crotch. "I would advise you to remove your hand, sir." Tony said pressing the barrel into the man’s groin. The man moved his hand quickly but did not get up. Tony eyed him then jerked back in surprise.
Tony nodded taking a step back and fixing his suit. “Then do not shame me for my unwillingness and instead accept the olive branch I attempt to give.”
“I considered just taking Natasha and Sam but the court will want the mate of the omega left in the burning house and as much political overhaul we can use.”
“Is it? You walked in here with the goal of combining our packs, but did you ever once consider that you may have to relinquish your status?” The captain didn’t answer just glowered. “No? It would be I who would submit under the mighty alpha? No compromise?” Captain Rodgers’ eyes shifted over and Tony knew the wall would burn the same color as his cheeks did if it could. Tony shifted forward until his forearms were on the desk his hands clasped together. He was going in for the final blow just like when he would sell guns. “My guess is that compromise would mean giving me a meager amount of power over your ‘unit’ and that would in turn destroy something inside of you.” Tony looked down at his hands and the scars weaved over them from metal and fire. “With that in mind, I think it will be best to hold off on this discussion until you’ve reworked the angle you want to come from.”
Thor guided the monster onto a seat by the fireplace that was little more than a pile of left over pillows.
Bucky laughed and pulled out a pair of pants starting the arduous process of putting them on one handed. "Think of it logically, Steven. This place is large enough to house both our pack and Starks pack plus some. I'm not planning on leaving without Clint and neither is Nat. Sam’s not leaving without her. Clint's not leaving. You'd be wandering with just Thor and he'd leave you for a pretty flower."
Clint slapped him outside the head. "Yes, it is," he said struggling to crawl to the item. Bucky was quicker pulling himself up by his abs and leaning over to snatch it in three swift movements.
Thor learned to cook with Bruce their body’s shifting closer and finding a rhythm in their movement. The house smelled of berries that Bruce had found either that day or the day before, because when asked, most frequently by Clint, he would make a pie of their choosing with out a second thought. Thor got used to Bruce’s smile, the crinkles in his eyes, the trembling in his hands when talking of his past and the sad smile that he held whenever he thought Thor wasn’t looking. Bruce found himself absolutely intrigued by Asgardian science as it related to that of people. They used runes in food for better health, runes on clothes for wounds, runes in wounds. He was intrigued. He had no magic at all in his pinky finger, but he pondered the possibilities of using Tony’s gifts to create such medical marvels. He knew Thor’s intent though and he could not help himself from circling ever closer to it.
Stane’s expression didn’t change facsimile smirk crinkling his eyes. “I guess your right. I should leave you one more night to say goodbye to your friends.”
“Don’t worry we’re out of the house.” Stane answered. Tony struggled looking around wildly. Where were they? He nearly sighed in relief when he recognized the large stretch of land before the road reached the forest that surrounded the inn.
The lights went out and there was a thud as something heavy hit the mats. Someone pulled out their phone and lit up the objects face.
“It seems I have an angel looking down upon my shame.” Tony said his words hollow and barely reaching Steve’s ears. Steve stepped forward intending to climb down into the trench only to step on a loose foot hold and tumbled down.
"I believe," Mr. Stark said patting Steve's chest. "That would be you sleeping in. Not much I could trick you into to doing."
The pack slowly gathered in the wreckage of the living room. Clint and Bucky were first, Bucky unable to stop Clint as he ran down the stairs shifted then curled into a small ball on the couch whimpering. Waiting. Bucky sat next to him clothed and shaken. Natasha and Sam came next. Sam holding Natasha who's face was hard as granite and held her chin pensively. Thor and the monster were last. Thor was wearing clothes and gingerly holding the monsters hand while it stomped down stairs.
Steve’s hands roamed up to his face forcing Tony to look at him. “No. Not yet. They’re bargaining devices, Tony.”
Bruce and Clint mirrored her sentiments. Tony pushed his hands through his hair. “My fear is, that who ever is doing this isn’t trying to shut us down but instead trying to ignite violence against us. Shutting down might not stop them.”
“The pipes still run as you made them,” Clint said pulling away. “Most of the damage is just superficial.”
Tony woke up to the feeling of weightlessness. He leaned his head into the body carrying him and was surprised he felt stiff fabric instead of the worn cotton of their shirts.
“Oh no you don’t.” Bucky grunted pulling Clint up so they were facing each other. “You quick motherfucker. I let you get a thirty second head start and two hours later I finally find you. Gods. You’re supposed to be pregnant who said you could still have speed.”
"Well," Tony said handing the water jug to Jarvis. The metal man took it and ticked and tocked his was back around the cart. "We hardly know each other. It's been less than 24 hours. Let's not rush into hasty conclusions alright?"
Tony collapsed asleep shortly after he tested all he could think of on Thor's hammer. Steve threw a blanket over him and cursed the darkness sending him inside. He wanted to draw every eyelash against his cheek every brush of stubble and most importantly the calm placid expression gracing Tony's face.
Bucky wrapped his arm around Clint's waist touching as much as his belly as he could and kissed his neck. "I do not worry about such things. They are them and we are we. We are staying here. I am staying here. I follow your words no others."
Tony tapped his fingers against the table. "This alpha wouldn't happen to be the same alpha that Miss Romanov was involved with would it?"
“I," Bucky said one finger coming up to poke the very air around it, "have been used. Now I have a week to woo a hissing fox."
"I miss my friend," Bruce said then walked across the field to the barn. It opened with a creak though he did not touch it and he walked into the darkness.
"Absolutely charming. This must have been why we keep you." Tony said stepping back. He was sure Clint aimed for him the third time.
"Lord Stark, mustn't know I am unwell, or it will break his heart and he's already lost two before, I fear what another shall do." Jarvis said.
Tony shook off his fur and flicked his wristlet creating the gun. "Who," his voice was still touched by the change and ground like gravel.
Then he sat down in a corner and drew. The urn, the anvil, Jarvis, Dummy, the peaches, the hammers, the chisels and Tony, Tony, Tony... he drew until he could not see his hands.
Tony’s fingers blackened with the soot. “Clint and Bucky will have to sort through the house and see what’s usable.”
: All of them. Past and/or graphic depictions of: rape, abuse, torture, executions, character death, religious themes/appropriation, PTSD symptoms, and abortion.
“Of course he would. In a heartbeat,” Tony says, eyes wide and incredulous, like he’s pointing out the obvious. “The moment I got in his way he’d knock me down and climb right over me, or strand me in space, or leave me in - ”
The bands around his lungs contract, waiting, but Bucky just gives him a fragile smile and bumps Steve’s shoulder with his. “You’re just upset I won. You’re getting rusty, punk.”
Every time Steve spares a thought for Tony in Bucky’s presence he feels like a traitor. Like Tony’s hands have left imprints on his skin and if Bucky looks too closely he’ll see them. He’ll know what Steve’s done and how much he’s enjoyed it and Steve would lose him all over again. Regardless of Stark’s current agenda, Iron Man tried to kill his best friend. That should be enough. What does it say about him that it’s not?
Luke clearly didn’t believe him. Steve and Tony had spent too long in the Ether. They had grown accustomed to seeing each other beaten and bruised, so the red marks streaking Tony’s torso were of no particular note to Steve. Neither was the blood leaking through his own shirt where his self-inflicted wound had been torn open. He would concede that to anyone else it looked damning.
“I’m really not.” The holes in Tony’s abdomen only stung when he remembered they were there. “How can I help?”
Steve’s manners force him to collect the doctor's cane and overcoat from the kitchen. Kovalchyk picks up his sketchbook and looks at Steve over the rim of his spectacles. It reminds Steve of schoolmasters of years past.
The Soldier takes advantage of Steve’s wandering mind to hook his ankle and send him sprawling. From the ground Steve can see the Soldier advancing on Tony with intent and manages to reach out and drag him down.
He set a pace close to what he remembered Tony preferring. Not quite rough but close enough to the edge to feel dangerous. Tony didn’t give any direction otherwise. He didn’t touch himself either, body and pleasure entirely at Steve’s mercy.
“What we’re looking for is down there,” Tony whispered. He knew it on an instinctual level, just like he knew he had to save Steve.
Tony arrives at the cemetery to find his fugitive ex-husband has already dusted the snow off the gravestones. He waits for the sight of Steve Rogers to take his breath away but there is nothing but an ache behind his eyes; suppressed tears or a budding migraine or the pain of staring into the sun.
Tony doesn’t move at all, gaze sharp and assessing, like he doesn’t quite believe Steve capable of retreat. He doesn’t move away from the edge but he doesn’t move toward it either.
“He was gone for five months and you forgot everything you ever knew about him," Bucky accused. "Being bonded for him is different than for us. Bonds are unbalanced and not in his favour. Stark didn’t build an empire by being a sucker, he doesn’t take raw deals.”
“He’s trying to quit.” Sam peers over the door and Steve feels oddly put on the spot. He gestures toward the bare shelves behind the bar as evidence.
“Not having one.” Bucky studies his only extant hand. “I haven’t had a right arm since 1944. The arm they gave me - the new one too - they just hid that. I lost it. It’s gone.”
Trousers and underwear are next and Steve is momentarily transfixed by the taper of calf from knee to ankle. He steps back to frame Tony in his entirety, naked from head to foot. Tony twitches under his gaze and Steve doesn’t know if it’s anticipation or anxiety until Tony grins, takes himself in hand and strokes -
Steve has lost whatever plot thread Tony's babbling about but it doesn't matter. He stands abruptly, forcing Tony to scramble back. With one hand he throws the covers open and in a single movement he picks Tony up at the waist and drops him onto the mattress.
“Yeah,” Tony sounds vaguely disgusted, with himself or the Accords it’s impossible to tell, “unfortunately for them I like my liquor and Rio sucked. AIM even offered me a job and before you yell, I’m pretty sure blowing their bunker to kingdom come counts as me turning them down.”
Bucky runs a frustrated hand across the joint of his prosthetic. “Yeah.” He lets out a little frustrated huff. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.”
Iron Man’s behaviour in the field became erratic; flip-flopping between perfect obedience and willful defiance. Sometimes he followed Steve’s instructions to the letter, so silent over coms that Steve checked in periodically to make sure he was still there. Other times he was so needlessly headstrong that he contradicted every order.
The haughty dismissal was the last straw. Steve bared his teeth and ripped the newspaper out of Strange’s hands and a moment later he was thrown across the room by an invisible force.
. His muscles go lax and compliant, and he lets Steve take over. Watching Stark’s surrender is heady, as temporary as it may be. It feels addictive and illicit. It feels like Steve
Steve got angry. It was easy. It was always easy with Tony. They’d been here before; defiance and confrontation and sublimated lust.
Still, Steve breathes easier Friday mornings knowing that Rhodes was here the night before. He’s pretty sure it’s the only thing holding Stark together so Steve always errs on the side of good manners and gives them space.
The most unbearable part turns out not to be the restless nights or the coughing fits. It’s the smell.
“Hey,” Tony whispered, his hands cupping Steve’s face, eyes searching his. “I love you. I’m not leaving you.”
and if that was the case there was nothing to tell.” He shuffles the papers around to give his hands something to do. “It wasn’t fine. Tony found out everything at once. His parents, the Winter Soldier,
He didn’t but was Tony’s fault they were here and he had to get them out soon given the state of Steve’s injury and mind. Every hour in this flat, dead land seemed to wear exponentially more on Steve than Tony.
Tony snorted. “Dreadfully medieval, the Dark Ages give me hives. They didn’t have enough tech to do anything and when have I ever let that stop me but… ” he shook his head self-deprecatingly. “I thought I could handle it, you know? All those unenlightened people with their ideas of how the world worked… ”
Tony’s eyes flash dangerously. “I may not be the poster child for responsibility but I’m not going to drunkenly stumble off the edge of a building. It’d only prove you right. Stop holding onto me like I’m a fucking toddler.”
“Late-acting suppressants,” Reed explained with far more confidence than Steve thought the idea merited.
Tony knew he should have called for Steve. He had promised not to leave him behind but that vow fell by the wayside like it had so many times before. He struck out alone across the glowing ice, the sheets releasing great cracks at intervals underneath his feet. There were shadows moving under the translucent ice but the thickness obscured any details. Tony staggered towards the lake’s center on numb feet. He didn’t know what he’d find but if this was a Hell then it had been designed for Tony. If it was meant to punish him then so be it but he’d find a way to make whoever -
Steve can finally see him in full. Tony’s hair is dark brown, not the near black of the bunker. It’s longer now too, curling at the tips. There’s no purpling bruise under his right eye and the BARF frames draw attention to brown irises distinct from black pupils. His expression is weary and frustrated but there’s no anger, no betrayal.
Steve lets the disappointment wash over him and retreat again. It doesn’t stick to his ribs like it used to. “Alright.”
He feels his face flush because realistically how long did they think they were going to get away with it? Sneaking around like teenagers and not like two grown men in a building packed with spies.
The stranger checks his old clunky watch and winces. “I don’t. My flight departs in two hours but I can realistically only stay for one. Traffic and security and that whole rigamarole.”
“No.” Bucky’s voice is loud and almost vicious. Steve startles and the holograms freeze. “That never happened. The butcher shop was closed, she couldn’t afford anything anyway. She came home with… with…” Bucky looks at Steve a little desperately, like he’s questioning his own memories again.
Her green eyes are lit by a spark. “Do you think you can do better?” The last time Natasha should have fought him, she let him walk away instead.
“I have no idea.” Tony couldn’t recall any of that. Everything that came before was foggy, sparsely punctuated by feelings of dread.
Steve says none of this. He bundles all his regrets tight and stores them somewhere the world can’t see them. “Okay.”
Today though, Avenger’s Compound is a madhouse: agents and officers running around in full flight. There’s a Category 5+ typhoon heading straight for Maldecia and the Avengers are all dressed up and going nowhere. The Maldecian government won’t let them in and under the Accords there’s no exception clause for natural disasters. It’s not a terrorist group or an alien invasion, goes the logic. Hurricanes are neither world-ending nor contagious except people are going to die just the same and this time the Avengers are going to let them.
There was a sharp intake of breath but Steve barrelled on. “Their Steve wasn’t dead. If I was dead over there I would have been able to cross the veil.” Bucky didn’t correct him no matter how much Steve willed it. “That’s why you hit me. It was me, in the other world. I hurt Tony.”
“You’re right.” Tony’s voice was serious as the grave. “I’m bleeding and I killed an innocent creature and it’s not fun. You saved me. You saved Time Square. And now we’re going home.” He edged closer. “You’re scaring me, Steve.”
“I know Cap, but he can get confused sometimes when I’m not…” Bruce sighed. “Innocent and guilty aren’t always easy to tell apart. The Other Guy might have trouble telling the difference.”
“Best guess? In no particular order: France, Washington, Romania, Berlin, Siberia, your planned one-man invasion of Belgium… You turned yourself in to join him and you’ve spent the entire time you’ve been here inserting yourself into his rehabilitation any way you can. You’re not subtle when you care.”
Steve should have remembered the double-edged nature of all things Stark. BARF is both a therapeutic tool and a torture device. Who doesn’t crave emotional catharsis? That’s the temptation but beyond it Steve can see the bottomless pit of self-recrimination waiting. It’s a Faustian bargain; knowledge for your soul. A
“And you’re okay with that? The man you’ve been in love with since the 40s swanning around with a woman called the Black Widow?”
Tony catches Steve’s wrist and despite the disparity in strength Steve lets him. Tony slowly readjusts them, lets Steve press into his hip again, then spits into his hand and coats Steve’s erection as best he can. Then Steve gets with the program. He rubs himself off on Tony at a punishing pace as Tony pours encouragement into his ears. His voice is the last thing Steve wants to hear. He closes his eyes and tries to pretend that it’s anyone else’s skin. He knows this will ruin them, he knows he started it. Part of him wants to tell Tony to shut up but years of associating sex with silence has him biting his tongue.
Outside the North Wing the Compound is bustling with people. Natasha’s on floor duty, Vision’s out of the country. Rhodes has joined Tony wherever he is and Bucky has his whole production of world class doctors who can help him better than Steve can.
(It shouldn’t be Stark. It should have been someone else a long time ago even if all they got were dark alleyways and stolen moments. It’s one of the things Steve never wants to confess - even to himself,
“You’re back,” Tony says quietly, trying not to wake her. He looks tired and lighter and like maybe he thinks it’s a minor miracle every time Steve returns.
It was the accumulation of little things. Tiny missteps that on their own meant nothing. There was the gala where the uppity senator’s aide had run his hand possessively across Tony’s back and Tony hadn’t even broken conversation. He just stood there allowing the touch and Steve nearly ripped the other alpha’s arm off, heart pounding with the effort it took to restrain himself from knocking the man out.
“I didn’t tell him.” The confession bubbles out of Steve. “After SHIELD fell and I found Bucky, I thought everything was going to be okay. Then I realized what had probably happened to the Starks and I just… ignored it. I bet on everything being
There’s nothing Steve can bring himself to say. It reminds him of that moment in Siberia when he didn’t answer and Tony knew anyway. Already Tony’s shaking his head like he’s just waiting to hear it confirmed that nothing he does is enough to warrant Steve staying. They’ve spent a year discovering new ways to hurt each other before falling back into the same old ones. Steve has spent the last twelve months wasting away at the Compound and he can’t bring himself to volunteer to return to it. He can’t wait around endless days for a calamity dreadful enough they call him back into service. It will turn him in something else long before then: a hollowed-out tin soldier with no inner life of his own.
Steve just glares. He knows better than to expect it’ll work on Tony but short of ripping the glass from his hand and carrying him down to Medical it’s all Steve has. Confined to an arena barring physical action the fight advantage lies with Stark.
There’s a pause and Steve hopes. As much as he wants Bucky to be cured, there are days he’d settle for Bucky telling him it’s horrible, that nothing works and it’s all a trick - because then the waiting would stop and Steve would be useful again.
If Barnes has stopped getting better then maybe there’s nothing more to fix. Maybe this is just who he is now and there's nothing you or I or HYDRA can do about it.”
“Call me Francesca. Since I’m no longer practicing and Georgie’s stolen your shoe, Dr. Blancard may be bit formal.”
Tony smelled sour, sick, like old sweat. The clean smell of the ocean replaced with the hollow scent of loss and rot. Underneath it though was finally something Steve recognized. “You smell like you again.”
“You can’t do this,” Steve said because he had to. Avengers didn’t avenge, not in the way that sent assassins after peasants.
She releases the file. “Tony also told me you’ve taken to sleeping on the couch at night like a guard dog. You have a bed Steve, you could use it every once in a while.”
The music’s too loud to get a word in edgewise so Steve contents himself with watching Tony work, marveling at the meticulousness and precision that seems so absent in the rest of Stark's life. The fourth time Tony adjusts his position Steve reaches out and carefully runs a hand down his bent back, letting warmth seep into aching muscles. Tony shivers and his head falls forward, exposing the knotted bumps of his spine. Steve takes it as an invitation, his hand stroking soothingly with steady pressure. Stark’s warm, alive, under Steve’s palm and the aftertaste of the dream fades. They stay like that for longer than either of them would be prepared to admit, with no one else awake the moment seems to exist out of time.
Natasha’s lips twitch, betraying the beginnings of a smile. She steps onto the mats, discards her sweater, and starts warming up her arms. She raises an eyebrow at Steve in invitation. The last time Steve laid hands on someone in violence he took Tony to the ground. The time before that he lost to Bucky on those exact mats. He has to rewind a long time before it’s a villain on the other side and not a teammate, or a police officer, or a friend.
Steve wakes up in his own room. The shield waiting for him: dumped on top of his bedspread in its burlap sack, haunting him like an old ghost. In the centre of his own chest is a fading red circular imprint from a repulsor.
Tony’s grin falls off his face and his expression shuts down. Steve doesn’t know where the conversation’s gone wrong but it certainly has.
Steve’s hands trembled. “There’s something wrong with Tony, I know it. He’s hurt. We need to help him. I need to - ”
Steve wants to trust Tony but the niggling doubts in his brain won’t leave him alone. Even if he grants Stark the purest of intentions he can’t help but analyze all the ways in which the execution is lacking. Tony isn’t infallible; he can be tricked, lied to, used. (Steve knows this; has seen it, has done it.)
Tony removed a rock and studied it. “Corbicite. Raw vibranium ore. But unless T’Challa really let this place go I’m betting we’re not in Wakanda.”
He motions toward the pit. “Crew will be in at first light to fix it. I’ll get Vision to put in a temporary seal when he wakes up. Or gets up I suppose since he doesn’t need to sleep but insists on trying anyway.”
Tony wondered how many of those funerary cairns Steve had assembled himself; if each of them was a death Tony couldn’t remember. If each of those devoured, hollow knights in the forest marked a suicide.
Stark sinks to his knees with intent and all the air in Steve’s lungs rushes out. He can’t seem to get them to inflate again. He stays cornered against the desk, his escape forgotten in concession to more dire emergencies. Below, Stark’s clever fingers undo the button and zipper before him and Steve’s fists grip wood like a lifeline as he fights for control of his choppy, uneven breathing. The buzzing feeling rising in his stomach is mostly lust and only slightly apprehension because if Steve does this - if he lets this happen - then he can’t pretend what happened before was a one-off mistake.
Steve feels a spike of arousal so intense he’s ashamed. It’s forgotten a moment later when Tony finds what he’s looking for and his fist loosely encloses Steve’s erection to stroke as he tongues at the join between thigh and hip. The warm, wet sensation jostles the last of the fight loose in Steve. He breathes through the mounting anticipation as Tony gradually moves closer and closer...
Steve wasn’t going to be fooled again. (Like he hadn't said that every time he fell for Tony’s mask. Over and over and over again.)
Tony coughs up flowers and counts down blooms and wonders abstractly what happens when the last petal falls. When his lung capacity diminishes bit by bit until he suffocates under the weight of the bouquet in his chest. When beauty finally wins over the beast and the autopsy splits open his ribcage to reveal Eden.
Rhodes just looks out over the railing. “Yes and no. You featured but I don’t think you cracked the top five topics. If I thought you were the main problem I’d tell you.”
He was rewarded with a smile. One of Tony’s real ones, soft and slow. That, at least, hadn’t changed. Not like the swearing, not like the bite.
“Coat and cane stay on the floor.” Steve’s voice sounds strange to his own ears. He can’t remember when he last spoke to a human being.
Steve never learned what happened with the two of them. He never asked and Stark’s not going to tell.
And Tony wouldn’t take them, hasn’t taken them any of the times he’s visited because Bucky is right; he is not forgiven.
Tony nearly stumbled as the force it hit him. He remembered fighting the Celestials. He remembered the Cursed Blade being driven into Steve’s chest and then a reckless plan and an even more reckless promise.
His collection of perfect specimens increases as the sickness within him grows. By the time his birthday rolls around his daily haul produces enough intact blossoms to make his own bouquet. He arranges them in a round, glass vase; a carpet of flowers floating on water. His death jar: a record of love unrequited.
“I’m not, some of these slabs look like they were struck by lightning, dumped into a burning bush and then smashed by Noah on the way down the mountain.” He turned to where Steve kept himself an arms length away in case God decided to smite Tony where he stood. “Alright, let’s get a look at that cut, Cap.”
It doesn’t help that they both know that Steve’s always the one who instigates. He reaches out and escalates the verbal to physical. It's a weakness he can't stop indulging. He wonders if Stark does it on purpose: dangling himself and his accomplishments in front of Steve like a matador.
The entire house took less than a month for the holes to be fixed and the water to run properly. It still smelled of ash and their furniture was gone, so was most of the paint colors. It was much easier than when they first moved in because Tony had seven people to direct during repairs. The night the hole in the kitchen was closed and the stairs safe to go up and down, the pack sat down for a feast. Clint had caught two turkeys, Natasha and Sam went into town to grab some late season fruit and sell Tony’s clocks. They all sat around the table the couples paired off. Tony sat next to Steve and realized that this was the first time they had been so close in weeks. He took advantage leaning against him heavily.
There was a sharp crack as glass shattered behind them and Tony whirled around to catch Stane’s pack throw booze and lit matches into his house. Tony ran to the door only to be tackled by Stane face shoved in dirt eyes unable to leave the flames as they grew higher and higher. Stane sat on his back and pinned his struggling body.
Steve pursed his lips and pretended that didn't sound ominous. "Why hide? It's the pack that gave you Jarvis and Dummy." He tried. If he showed anger Tony would stoke it to his advantage that was abundantly clear in their last two conversations.
A figure stood over him blocking out the gray sky and covering him in shade and warmth. A fat droplet fell from a strand of hair that had fallen out of his bun. Bruce smiled at him.
“What the fuck do you mean?” Bucky said snapping at him. “He murdered someone because they broke his toys.”
The auction was set up relatively easily and people wandered in late. Which was the usual. Tony and the others sat on their stage which was just a lot of mats stacked up on top of each other stolen from the sports storage room. Clint was lazily doing flips. Bruce was reading Hawkins. Natasha was tossing a ball up and down in the air and Tony was rolling his ankle for the first time in a week.
Stane rolled his neck and shoulders. “Tony, Tony, Tony, you should know better than to think I’d let you leave without what’s mine.”
Tony lifted his head enough to spit on him. Stane jostled him and Tony let out a cry of pain before laughing again. Hammer was making such a funny expression.
“I heard Hammer talking with Stane about how unmanageable Blonsky was in the hallway this morning.” Thor continued unaware of all the eyes on him folding a paper airplane. “Cross told me that he was about to go on an adventure.”
Tony rounded the desk and pulled Bruce into his side leading him to the door. "If an alpha rejects you for that reason alone may the Father strike him with lightning. But otherwise I'd say that your decision is made. Go. Look after your pies and do bring me a slice."
Clint smacked him outside the head. “He just lost a child, could you shut the fuck up and let a man grieve.”
“Nothing at all.” Bruce said closing the cloak. He rushed inside with no preamble and began to clank around the kitchen.
"Where'd those come from?" Steve asked worried. Thor had never gotten injured in battle and Steve had seen him get hit nearly point blank with a rifle.
Tony would have done anything he’d asked in that moment. He reached out a hand touching Steve’s cheek. A star. Tony leaned in close and kissed him.
"The Hammer is his," was all Tony said disappearing around the corner. It felt like a near eternity before Tony came back with Thor. He had long scratches down his back.
"Good news Mr. Banner, my friend, you're now part of my pack. You may call yourself a Stark if you so please."
The room sat heavy around them and Tony picked up the head once more this time gently cupping it in his hands. He smiled.
They nodded and the conversation started once he left the room. Tony headed to the workshop. He had plans.
"If you could, do a small investigation in the nearest town and possibly the one after that." Tony said. "You already have a lifelong guarantee to my abilities, I'll compensate you whatever you want otherwise."
Natasha was also at the front of the line. She rarely fell down mental rabbit holes that badly. Must be the stress. She sighed and swiped her food card twice and continued out with her trays.
Two days before the auction had all of them sitting in Tony’s room. Steve was flipping through pages of notes and Tony was playing Among Us on his phone. He had decided that there was no way to get through this without punching something.
Bucky leaned in dropping to his elbow and licked a stripe along Clint's neck. "I want to. Do you want to?"
“I ask you one question about a school appointed position that you don't get paid for and I expect to be lied to and instead get called stupid.” Clint snapped pulling his arm away.
Bruce was next his back hitting the wall and slowly falling down. Clint ran from the room and quickly emptied the contents of his stomach into the water basin. Tony’s breathing became too rapid. He couldn’t breath. There was a silent whisper that sounded almost vicious, They Know.  Tony fled his home his clothes slipping off him as he shifted. He felt his thoughts circling and he need to out run them before they encompassed his whole being. They know, they know, they know,
Clint could feel Bucky smile against his shoulder. Clint placed Bucky’s hand over his belly where he knew the alpha wanted it and left his palm there. He closed his eyes the hurt still knifing through him just the barest hints of alleviated. Bucky’s head nuzzled deeper his hair falling over Clint’s shoulder tickling him.
“Tony,” Stane replied taking Tony’s hand. It was cold and Tony suddenly remembered being in his father’s office just after the funeral. Cold hands possessively on his neck telling him that they had it all under control. He didn’t have to worry about a thing. The hand tightened in his and he was pulled forward. Tony was forced to meet his eyes. They glowed with the change. No. Tony felt bile rise in his throat. No. Stane let his cane fall to the ground. Tony weakly tried to pull his hand out of the other man’s grip. Stane gripped his hair and tilted his head baring his head. No. Tony felt Stane’s nose against his pulse.
Clint stared up at the sky seeing god as was his usual post Bucky related orgasm daze. They had ended up in the large wooded area behind the schools soccer field. About a mile away was the edge of the campus and the start of the small college town sandwiched between the private school and a private college. For all the rich kids. Clint lived there in one of the the shitty over priced apartments with his alcoholic father and doormat stoner of a brother. At least at Pearsons School for Superior Boys he chose when and where he'd get the shit beat out of him. Here he had Natasha, Tony, and Bruce. He had also kind of had Thor and…Bucky nuzzled in. Clint smiled and curled into him.
“He’d have to graduate, and quit fight club, I guess.” Steve said on a snore. He fell asleep. Ready to wake up later and visit his boyfriend in the ICU he guessed.
The pack looked at him. He felt the heavy weight of expectation crescendo in their gazes. He had never been on this end of it. Tony was. He stood behind and let him speak for the two of them. He swallowed missing that barrier and wishing Tony could be there as a support beam.
The edge to the sarcastic comment clipped through. Tony flinched and had a small pang of pain hit his head. He stood up.
Tony let himself be pulled up into Steve’s arms. Tony looked up at him his eyes hooded. Steve leaned in and waited for Tony to fall into the kiss. It was sweet and demanding and Steve sighed when Tony pulled away. Time to go.
“What’s Ms. Romanov’s name?” Tony asked. He’d never felt the need to confront Steve on this before. He was relatively a neutral playing field despite his need to ruin everything Tony is actively trying to do.
Steve nodded and laid his head once again upon his knees. It was odd to be able to do so. He'd been a wolf for so long by necessity that he probably didn't remember what his body looked like. He woke up this morning and auto-shifted when he saw a head in his mirror, not recognizing his own face. He did spend time getting reacquainted with it afterwards but even then he looked...older. More tired. He had a layer of beard he hadn't had in a long time. His hair was longer than he remembered. Even now enjoying the humanity in this contact with Bucky he wished for the sweet relief of fur and dirt and unit.
“Asgard is,” Thor said, “as close to Valhalla as the earth may ever come.” Bruce listened absent mindedly and continued peeling apples for the pie Clint asked him to make. The man would occasionally ask a question that would get Bruce going for a good minute, but most often he would take to describing his homeland and the strangeness that laid there. Bruce would believe it all fantasy except for it paired well with his own unique problem. Bruce liked his presence despite his loud voice and boisterous manners, it probably helped that he looked like the Lady had spent her time with him and then let her children bless him. The gray blue eyes, hair long enough to fall over his wide shoulders and the brown scruff that adorned his square jaw were a testament to such a thought.
"Did you get it all out or do I need to invest in another pair of shoes?" Tony asked face twisted in disgust.
Bucky put his hands on Clint’s knees. “They know about the fights because we’ve been getting anonymous spam texts at various times in the night.”
Bruce and Tony exchanged a look over his head. "Let's take a break regardless." Tony said. "Please, let me examine you for my own conscious, if that's alright." Bruce said.
Clint smiled like the cat that got the mouse his blue eyes crinkling in a way they had not when they last met. "Lord Stark! I thought I recognized that ass."
“Any of those sound like potential kidnappers?” Clint asked having finishing his one tale of a soccer player stealing his aids and then being beaten to a pulp in the ring.
“I rejected Lord Thor.” Bruce said. “Because the last time I had an alpha I killed my entire pack including…” he didn’t finish. Tony whimpered. “I was cursed because I tried to create the perfect soldier and succeeded. The Father came down and slaughtered my work then turned to me and said That anger you hold is not where it should be. Do not tread where you are not wanted, little omega. The pack leader came in and beat me until I saw red. Then I saw only blood and heard her screams then nothing else.”
"Father's balls no. Apparently sex isn't part of the wooing process according to Mister Rodgers." Tony said taking the opening to pretend he meant something else. He leaned over the counter to look Clint in the eye. "We had some negotiations and as per my request you’re still welcome, Clint. I'll ask Bruce to bake a cake if all the sex he's been having hasn't destroyed his skills with the oven." Clint hugged him awkwardly finally relaxing. Tony hugged back. "You're always welcome here little omega." He whispered. Clint clung to him a little harder after that. He felt a ball of emotion possibly relief choke up his throat. Tony patted his back and pulled away.
Clint hid low in the brush. Shadows covered the forest floor but not quite covering his prey. Clint’s muscles bunched. Bucky loved rabbit. Clint sat abruptly his rump hitting the grass loud enough to startle the rabbit away. Clint barked at it the best he could even when it was long gone. Fuck. Clint rubbed his nose with a paw. Tree branches cracking, and grass rustling. Clint’s ears perked and tracked the noise. His head turned northwards, and he caught sight of bright white fur stumbling through the forest. Clint scooted back quickly and watched Bucky clumsily shift back to two legs and roll through the spot he just was and into a tree. He let out a string filth that was so impressive Clint would be charmed if he wasn’t so mad.
Clint didn't hear if he said anything else jogging up to the building and touching the bright red paint. His hand came dry and he smiled. Finally. It felt like days that it had been wet. He opened the white lined swinging doors and allowed the traveling pack in.
Bruce waited on the porch for his pack. Tony and Steve were chatting by the barn while Jarvis sat head against the wood and Dummy rested his claw in his lap. Clint was out in the woods probably hunting with Bucky despite their little row that morning. He was left in the house. He cleaned. He had bread in the oven and a stew ready, he even baked cheese and lettuce. The afternoon sun beat down on him and he was…bored. He closed his eyes and set his head on his knees wondering if he could get a book from Tony to read. The man seemed to have one somewhere despite leaving most of his things behind.
Thor took his hand and allowed Bruce to help him up though given how Bruce wasn’t given a chance to pull it was more for show than anything else.
“He’s at war and I thought I’d buy a home to furnish before our pups come.” Tony lied placing a hand over his belly making sure to pooch it out.
“This is the first and last time,” Bruce muttered but let Thor take in the joy and relaxed for the first time since his mate left. He had missed the over enthusiastic puppy in his kitchen and stepping on his toes. The monster had been grumpy and thus made him grumpy and he was certain that he might have been unbearable to be around. None of that mattered now that his mate was home. He closed his eyes and breathed in the smell of rain and lightning.
Tony snickered. “Ah, yes the Wilsons will be our strong alphas in these trying times. Who's going to fuck who first?”
“Bruce, my darling,” he greeted kicking down the door. Bruce startled and sat up bleary eyed and glasses crooked.
Tony twisted in anger and his beauty became monstrous. “No. I’m not helping you commit suicide, Steve.
“Trust me,” Tony pleaded. He even smiled. “I promised you I had a plan and even if I don’t remember the details, I know whatever we’re looking for is in that direction.” It was a lie but one designed to keep hope alive until he could find an actual solution. “C’mon, Cap. You followed me this far.”
She wakes on a Wednesday and Steve’s the only one around to greet her. Eventually Rhodes stops by, leaning heavily on his braces and reiterating the importance of physical therapy. He steps up as interim Team Leader but he still leaves for his flat in the city afterwards. Vision doesn’t quite know what to do. He stands in the corner of the hospital room; aware that proximity brings comfort but unsure as to the exact mechanism.
“Tony’s fine, Steve.” Bruce’s voice was calm where he appeared in the hallway. “He’s just taking a nap.”
Under his hands Tony is shaking with a mixture of pain and adrenaline and Steve pretends he doesn’t notice. Stark’s shirt is ripped up the side seam and hiked up to his armpits and Steve can see what he was trying to hide. There’s a swath of red-black bruise blooming across his left ribcage. It’s been hastily bandaged with medical tape, sloppily so, and Steve would bet his life that’s because Tony did it one-handed. Bruised ribs most likely. Hopefully nothing fractured or Tony truly is an idiot.
It’s a romantic’s disease. The old stories say that the infected die of broken hearts, that the sickness in their lungs feeds on the unrequited love of the host. The supposed cure is as simple: to have that love returned. Many a Gothic heroine has hidden her affliction until her beloved confesses his love as she lays dying on her death bed.
signed them.” Steve's finger hovers accusingly above Tony’s chest. They tore themselves apart over those papers and now Stark’s treating them as an a la carte menu. “You fought for this. You wanted to choose which bits to follow you picked the wrong side.”
The bright lemon yellow of a Lamborghini rounds the bend, lithe body racing too close to the ground as it pulls into the diner parking lot. Steve just stares into his coffee and waits for the future to catch up to him.
But it is beautiful too and Tony cradles it close, like an exhausted mother with a stillborn child. It is small comfort: a poor substitute for his husband’s warmth but it is here and Steve is not.
“Well who could say no to you?” Tony smiles but there’s nothing funny to be found. “Keep my nose clean and no drinking. Done. Anything else you need from me,
He dumped the box of donuts into Tony’s lap the next morning before sliding into the driver’s seat. Tony handed him a large coffee. Neither of them apologized.
In his peripheral vision Steve can see the bright lights of the repulsors aimed at him. Tony’s asking for trust and Steve can’t afford to make the same mistakes twice. That can’t be who he is, or at least it isn’t who he wants to be but he’s not known for his ability to change. It's why Erskine chose him. It's why he's losing Tony.
Bucky leaned against a tree and stuffed his thumb in his pants. “You can barely walk. The babes might want out too early and what would happen then?”
Bucky fell on the bed next to Thor. “Why did we decide to involve ourselves in this? I mean, I’m mostly waiting for my acceptance letter from Berkley and trying to make sure I don’t fail McCargo’s shitty final exam.”
"I do not know how far." Clint stood. "They smell of enemy and we smell of safety. I think that will take more than a courtship competition to break."
He blinked away the tears and stood straighter running a hand over the seam of his vest. None of that. He's part of a militia and wants partial ownership over Tony's pack so that Lt. Barnes and Clint can be together. That was their own ordeal. His was the silly little promise a foolish angel made when they had learned they'd lost.
“You murdered the alpha on your marriage certificate and the one who’s teeth are permanently in your neck is coming to claim something we can’t fight because he has legal rights.” Bucky answered. “I understand perfectly.”
Bruce couldn’t look at them and felt an embarrassing shake in his chin. There was too much happening to many lights and he wanted pain and a scream was building in his throat. Some how through all that he was able to speak.
Tony ruffled his hair shoving his head down. “Nonsense. It’s no one’s fault but the arsonist. See you soon my friend.”
A large snout met him on the other side of the carriage. Tony slowly looked up it until he met large angry green eyes. Tony waited. The snout opened, and Tony wondered with all the sins he had behind him if it was a cosmic joke that he'd be eaten by his first friend in eight years. A tongue rolled out and licked him nose to tail. Pack. The gesture said. Tony could feel the saliva and blood matting his fur and making it stand to attention like all his muscles. He blinked and shook himself letting out a tiny lick for the other wolfs (if you could call it that) nose. Pack. He responded. The wolf nodded and sat it bared it’s neck submitting. Then slowly the earth shimmered and shook then collapsed and there was Bruce once again. Covered in blood and viscera but unharmed all the same.
“It seems that it is time to leave my mark and, with any luck, keep you here,” Steve said. “While you are not my property, I would hope that you would at least fight to stay here. Let me fight to keep you here, with…our pack.”
Clint patted his back before his eye caught something and he waddled off. The two pups sat heavily on his frame but failed to impede his restless nature as Bruce often found him coming home with a buck around his shoulders or a pile of fish that reached near sky high. Tony would find him plastering wall while Jarvis failed to stop him or teaching Dummy how to clean struggling to even bend down. Bruce clutched his head not finding the energy to stop him from wandering off.
Stane wiped his mouth and Tony supposed he was going to say something important, but it never made past his lips. Steve had him pinned to the ground between one second and the next. Stane laughed.
Steve didn't know what to say. The riddle felt ominous and heavy. "I," he started, "I can do that for you."
Steve sighed. He could not tell if he was being mocked and his instinct was to say yes and throw a punch. That was not how you woo a man. Though he was not sure he wanted to woo the man as he was vividly reminded of their first meeting.
Rogers and Thor exchanged a look. “How about I stay with you, my friend,” Thor said amicably, “And we wait for the other prefects to call and tell us they found him.”
Thor tossed the paper airplane to T’Challa. “People also think I am too stupid to pick up on nuance.”
“I too would like to hear the more pleasant stories, if you’d please?” Bruce asked looking up at Thor with eyes so wide and adorable that Tony found himself impressed.
“Banner.” He said his thick Russian accent. Bruce was beyond introductions. He said something. Maybe. Bruce ran at his abdomen aiming his head at Blonsky’s diaphragm. Blonsky’s breath rushed out but he caught Bruce’s sides. Bruce rammed a knee up and under aiming for his balls. He hit something because Bronsky’s grip loosened and Bruce was able to kick a knee out from him knocking him on his ass. He was finally with in Bruce’s reach. Bruce gripped his hair and began punching and punching. Someone hit him with a pipe from behind. Bruce saw that their arm was close to his face and bit into him. He dragged the arm back so he could continue to punch Blonsky. Blonsky punched him in his diaphram and Bruce released the arm. Blonsky hit him again and Bruce bit his cheek. Blonsky went to hit him one more time but Bruce spat blood in his face and his hands went up to wipe. Bruce began punching again.
Bruce was groping his belly and pressed an ear to it. “The fetuses sound healthy and though his lungs sound weak they’re getting stronger. Just keep him out here.”
Natasha had to shake all three of them awake once the school meeting was over. They were having a break day so that the school staff could have the same meeting of being yelled at and shamed. The seven of them walked out to edge of the forest and sat against one of the large redwoods.
Tony eyed him. The man had his gaze fixed on his hands, shoulders pulled in. He was scared. For whom, Tony couldn't say. What he could say on the other hand… "Travel companion then?" It was less solid than pack but... Jarvis' head creaked up at him perceptive as always.
Tony swallowed flinching at the bruising pain. He distantly wonders whether Clint felt this when he got bitten. He nodded and stumbled back towards the house. Steve tried to help him, but he jerked out of his grip. Steve got that pinched look in his brow. Tony just continued walking. Clean wound. Leave the automatons, go with Stane. Suffer through the heat.
