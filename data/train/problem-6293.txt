“Do you mind it we don’t? At least not right now?” Tony amends. “We can just…” He trails off and gestures at the pictures; he can start by sharing this much with Steve, at least. Talking can come later.
Steve laughs wetly, and it sounds hollow in the quiet. He can’t bring himself to speak just yet, doesn’t trust himself not to cry in front of Tony, with his soothing voice and attempts to make him laugh. It’s all so stupid and yet—
Tony could ask why he hasn’t mentioned his sleepless nights, why he hadn’t confided in anyone on the team, or asked for help, but he doesn’t, and for that, Steve’s grateful. He doesn’t have the energy to go into it right now, but more than that, he has a feeling Tony knows exactly why.
“That sounds reasonable,” Steve says easily. “No plans.” Steve smiles, lifting a hand up and stroking it through Tony’s hair. He’d missed this while he was gone, the ability to just reach out and touch Tony whenever he wanted. He wants to breathe him in, make up for lost time.
Steve laughs, so relieved to be home he feels it down deep, a sharp sense a relief that seems to go all the way down to his bones. “I missed you, too,” Steve says into Tony’s hair.
He turns off the stove and slides down to the floor. The mess would have to be dealt with, of course, but more than that, Steve feels like he can’t stand upright for another moment.
Steve doesn’t say anything else, just slides onto the bed beside Tony, rolling over towards him and scooping him up, his hands huge and soft against Tony’s back. Tony feels himself let out a long-held breath as he settles in against Steve, warm and comforting and familiar beside him.
“Fair enough,” Steve agrees, pulling away and peering over Tony’s shoulder again. “Hey, does that have to simmer for a while?”
“Good,” Tony says. He looks at the mess around them again. “Let’s leave this for the morning, okay? We can watch a movie or something, if you still don’t want to sleep?” It’s an offer, a lifeline, and for once, Steve decides to take it.
“Hey, J, where’s Steve right now?” He asks despite himself. His words come out almost slurred, his tongue feeling almost too big for his mouth.
“Well, yeah, but I kinda have to be here. Name’s on the building and all,” Tony gestures in the direction of the floor to ceiling windows, the Stark logo reflecting brightly against the rain-spattered windows. Tony puts his hands over Steve’s, stilling his nervous fidgeting with his own.
There’s a creak, and the gently snick of a door closing, and when Tony looks up again, Steve’s there, looking down at Tony and his mess of photographs and keepsakes with the world’s most tender look on his face.
“It’s supposed to be a surprise, darling,” Tony tells him, smiling when he feels Steve’s arms wrap around him from behind, warm around his waist as Steve buries his face in the crook of his neck, breath tickling the fine hairs along Tony’s nape.
“Is that you?” Steve grins, looking down at the photo still in Tony’s hands. “You started the whole genius thing pretty early, huh?”
“Koala,” Tony reminds him. “Now I’m all sweaty,” he points out, though he’s not at all put off by Steve’s hugs, even if he is sweaty from his run.
“Sure didn’t,” Tony nods. “But you’ve been all over the place this week. And if this fall is anything like last year, you’ll be down for the count with a cold in a matter of days.”
“Hmm, can’t have that,” Steve agrees, a wrinkle appearing between his eyebrows. “You’re Tony Stark. Appearances myst be kept up.”
+1 “You give the best hugs in the world, you know that? You should have an award or something. I’m going to create one. Gold star hugs,” Tony murmurs, wrapping his arms around Steve.
Everyone knows Tony keeps weird hours. Fewer people know that Steve does, too. He was careful to keep it that way, moving silently through the Tower without waking anyone up.
Steve’s eyes narrow a fraction. “How could you possibly remember that? You know you can’t prevent a cold with soup, though, right? And plus, by that logic I shouldn’t be doing this,” Steve gestures between them, bodies still entwined. “Since according to you I’m all germs.”
1. “Steve? What are you doing here, you hate these things,” Tony asks, eyes wide and soft in surprise at the sight of him standing in front of him.
That’s when Tony thinks he might just lose it and cry. Just for the fact of Steve Rogers, here in this dark, lonely room with him on the darkest of days.
Tony nods. “’S’always okay if it’s you,” he hears himself say. He’d never imagined this, that he’d be able to let someone in like this, really, all the the way in, the way he has with Steve. But it’s nice, and he realizes a little more every day just how much he was missing all those years he spent pushing people away.
He’s pictured the moment enough times. Steve would go down to the lab and ask what Tony was working on. Tony would come into the kitchen for a cup of coffee, and instead find Steve and his cold cup of tea, reading a book in the dim overhead lighting. Maybe they’d both end up in the common room at the same time, hoping to drown out the noise in their heads and hearts with a movie they’ve seen too many times to count.
“Right,” Steve says, nodding and taking a deep breath. He loosens his shoulders and tries to relax his jaw. When had he gotten so tense? “That would be… that would be really nice,” he says honestly.
“You can always come find me, if you want company. Or let JARVIS know where you are and I can come up. If you want, I mean.” Tony says quickly, like he doesn’t want to presume too much, as if Steve hadn’t been wanting exactly this for as long as he can remember.
5. Tony’s brushing his teeth, idly wondering when Steve would be back from his run, when he looks up and sees him striding through their room and coming up behind him for a hug.
He images the soft, slow dip of the mattress as Steve joins him, filling the other half of the bed. He can almost feel the soft tug of Steve’s fingers through his hair, gentle and soothing as they lay there. He’s done this before, of course, tried to convince himself that Steve really was there, rather than seven floors away. Stupid, really, when Tony could have the real thing. Steve would never begrudge him that, he knows, but…
3. “What are you making?” Steve asks when he finds Tony in the kitchen. They’d had conflicting schedules for the better part of a week now, and Tony would be lying if he said the sound of Steve’s voice didn’t send a bright spark of joy right through him.
Steve presses balled fists to his eyes, drags in a ragged breath, and wishes, for the millionth time, that he could have just stayed asleep.
“Well, I don’t usually spill things,” Steve says shakily. “‘But I’m up… most nights,” he confides. It’s a start, just a few words, but he feels lighter for saying them.
“Well, I could be wrong,” Tony hedges, not wanting to pull away from the embrace just yet. “Plus, I’ve barely seen you this week, it’d be cruel to leave me here all alone.” He pulls his face into an exaggerated pout.
“Hi,” Tony says. He looks down at Steve, taking in the tea leaves, the abandoned kettle and mug, and even in the dark, Steve can see something click into place in his eyes. “You okay?”
The team nodded and began to make their move towards the exit of the servant quarters. Steve kept his eyes forward charging down the halls but made sure to be aware of all his teammates' locations. Most guards they faced went down easy but some took a few hard hits before they went down. The Avengers climbed their way to the throne room with efficient and fast movements and fights. They all coordinated who attacked, who defended and who would stand watch. It was their forte to just silently communicate and understand one another without uttering a single word. Pepper meshed in pretty quick and learned fast all the signs that Steve and others were using or try to anticipate their next moves.
“Where is Pepper? Where is my wife?” Tony demanded looking wildly around until he came fact to face with himself. Or more like his body. It was in a metal container with a small window looking like he was peacefully asleep. He took a step towards himself, “Mr. Stark please-” and suddenly his body was engulfed in flames making Tony shout out in horrified surprise expecting to feel the searing pain of fire on his skin but nothing came.
This was fun. Being with Tony. Steve found that they just worked. A lot of times Steve could tell Tony did not see eye to eye about how to get certain things done nor did they always share the same opinions but Steve strongly believed that Tony and he shared the same core values. Tony still seemed scared to really challenge Steve as if somehow Steve will change his mind and enslave Tony. Though, Steve could always see the fire in those eyes challenging him. He wanted Tony to fight with him, to challenge him, to feel comfortable and safe enough to take Steve on. Slowly Steve will free Tony from those fears. It was important to him even if he has to buttheads with the harpy. Tony should feel as free as he is.
It took ten minutes to get to the center from where he was and seeing it so close made his heart begin to race. He hasn't been this excited in a while, he could feel the smile forming on his face.
The room looked lived in like it was not just a place to come crash but a place he and Steve spent time in together. It was the little things he noticed though. Like the toys stuffed in the corner of the room, the socks that seemed a little too small for either Steve or Tony to wear, and the windowsill covered in sketches some in pencil and others in crayon. But the most damning piece of evidence that seemed to seal that conclusion was a photo sitting on his nightstand. A picture of him and Steve holding up a kid who was grinning ear to ear.
“Sshh,” Bucky hummed at him pressing Steve close to his chest. Suddenly Steve let it all go and just cried into Bucky’s shoulder. Buck just held him whispering sweet nothings trying to calm Steve down. But Steve did not stop. He just kept crying.
“So basically most of this month’s money. You know, Clint was looking forward to those new arrowheads,” Bucky said before moving to help Steve with the new supplies. He gave him a small smile of appreciation letting his best friend take stuff from his hands.
Tony blanched, mentally panicking at hearing the date. He was in the future. Or a future. Someone’s future. Maybe not even his own. Someone who got Steve to put a ring on their finger. This was definitely someone’s sick joke to mess with Tony’s head. Maybe he wasn’t even in the future.
“It angers me that Loki has done such a heinous act against a person I consider my shield-brother,” Thor spoke with a deep sadness in his tone, “I expected more of my brother and I wish things could have been different. He would have been a good addition to our team and Barton would not be suffering such effects still.”
It has been long since he has been there. He didn’t always feel like it was home and a part of him missed it but he loved the nomadic life he had so the ache was not too bad.
“Go on big boy,” Bucky pushed him forward towards the moving entity he does not want to meet. She was not
Rhodey looked like he was contemplating Steve’s words for a moment before nodding with a pleased smile on his face. Suddenly the tension that seemed to sit in the air dissipated between the two groups. The two groups merged into one as they decided to head back to the Avengers’ camp. It was interesting and fun to watch his teammates talking to their newest companions.
“We tried everything but Tony was adamant about staying in the tent. He refused to eat until I threatened to tell you that and how upset you would be if he didn't eat,” Bucky answered crossing his arms over his chest as he too looked at Steve's tent.
That was the easy part. This was going to be extra difficult than their norm and it required all their techniques, skills and battle plans to get this done correctly and smoothly.
“I couldn’t take it Buck,” Steve whispered letting it all finally rush over him, “I can’t take this aching loneliness that refuses to go away.”
Look what I found! I kind of really did not like any of the chapters I was writing for this story so I took a step back from it and now I got inspiration to write it again.
“Do it when you get back to your computer and stop thinking about it so we can actually enjoy our meal. I don’t need you fainting on me again,” Bucky smiled mischievously earning him a hard punch from Steve.
“Look, I am sorry. I wouldn’t have shown up if they told me it was you okay? I know when I am not really wanted,” Tony growled wincing a bit while taking a few steps back. Steve felt a flash of anger run through him hearing Tony say those words. Steve had never
“I should probably go on a run, now that I’m actually awake,” Steve smiled back and gave Tony a quick kiss to his forehead disappearing into the bathroom.
If you are interested in winning this chance please follow the link below with all employee details. You should receive an email by the end of this week if you won!
After seeing Papa Rhodes, Tony was more sure than ever. He was going to make this work. He had to. Seeing the man in rags and torn shoes broke his heart in a million pieces. He deserves so much more than this. No one deserves this. Tony wished he could save them all but he knew it was not in his power.
Tony glared at him for a long moment but mutely nodded at Steve before turning around and adamantly not giving Steve any face. Tony had never really gotten over Siberia even if he tried his best to be civil with Steve for as long as he had lived back...back then. Now one of the last people he wanted to see was there to greet him.
“Sorry to cut your training session, early boss,” Happy spoke up getting up from his spot once he sees Rhodey, Tony and Steve enter the camp, “we got important information to discuss.”
Tony sighed and began to rub his hands together. It was a nervous tick Tony had even since they were together. This was something that worried Tony immensely. “The Erskine trials,” ice cold water ran through Steve’s veins at hearing those words, “turns out my dad knew you had applied and was blocking your application to get selected and gave me the choice, I stay with you and force you to never get the once in a lifetime opportunity for a better life or let you go and have you get the one thing you really needed. I couldn’t do that to you and I didn’t tell you because I knew, I know, you would have argued to change my mind.”
Tony looked at Steve with his large scared and worried eyes. Steve just gave Tony a reassuring smile before turning to figure out the best way to get Happy out of this mess without hurting him more. Steve asked Tony to help him get the larger pieces of debris off the fallen harpy so he could pick him up more easily. Tony rushed to get it done as Steve carefully moved Happy’s torso and get a good grip on it as he waited for Tony to finish. Steve locked his arm under Happy’s broken wings and waited until the exact moment Tony moved the last piece of debris to push his arm under Happy’s knees and pull him off the ground.
The rest of the ride to the camp was silent and he looked out to see the landscape and wonder what it will be like to be a real soldier. Steve did not believe that he got his chance and he thank the heavens that Dr. Erskine had decided to believe in him. He felt like he was heading towards his destiny. That he was meant for this. He did not know why but he knew that he was going to go to war and fight. Bucky did not believe him neither did his other friends that always laughed at him for his enthusiasm to be a soldier.
“I wish you had told me,” Steve leaned back lowering his shoulders in defeat. It hurt but at least now he knew that he was right. Tony hadn’t left him because he didn’t love him anymore. So glad he persisted to hold onto that hope that the other man cared about him as much as he did even when Tony had told him that he didn’t love him anymore.
Tony looked down at the man suddenly feeling the loss of his parents all over again, “th-he-no he isn’t.”
Steve smiled to himself and went to fetch the item Tony requested from the blacksmiths in town. Harperia was a city of fliers so it was often hard to navigate for those without wings but luckily for all the Avengers, they were great climbers. So it might have taken Steve a little longer to get to the blacksmith market than it would have taken Tony but he got the job done efficiently as he could.
“Just...I need you guys to just not,” Steve sighed before continuing, “Tony is going to misunderstand and he is already beginning to trust us so can you lot stray away from the teasing. I like Tony, yes, but you have to lay off.”
“It wasn’t going to last Steve. Plus I was given an ultimatum of you or my inheritance and I’m a selfish guy,” Tony answered shrugging off his answer. Anger flashed in Steve’s chest quick and hot. It took all he could to keep it in forcing himself to close his eyes and recenter himself.
Steve was finally on his way to get Tony the medicinal ingredients he needed to save his wings. He hoped he could make it in time.
“Next time? Are you saying there will be a next time? Being ambushed, sold and treated worse than a human slave is a one time deal Rhodey,” Tony huffed trying to downplay the situation but Steve could see the pang of regret, guilt and anger cross Rhodey’s face before it dissipates. It must have been so hard for Rhodey to
Steve began to move but was stopped by a familiar voice saying, “I wouldn’t do that if I were you man. Tony has been having a hard time sleeping as it is with you being out of commision for three days.”
“Diane,” she supplied getting a little closer to him. He replied with his name trying to sound a little disinterested. She kept probing him with questions and he gave the shortest answers he could. The more he pulled away the more she demanded. It seemed like the shy guy act was not working. It was starting to get frustrating and a little annoying.
“Liberty?” The stable boy called noticing the door open. Steve climbed onto the horse and urged it to move hoping he doesn’t harm the stable boy on his way out. The horse, Liberty, moved forward out of the stall and Steve was on his way throwing back a quick apology to the surprised and dazed stable boy he left behind.
Tony looked at him with worried eyes before pointing to his legs. Ah, people would know he was a harpy and often times harpies are treated worse than pets in human establishments. This sucked and it really should not be the case. People need to learn to treat other creatures with respect that they deserve. Humans are ugly creatures.
"They sound a little familiar," Steve teased earning a small poke on the right side of his chest. But it seemed to have worked a bit. Tony didn't look so sad or devastated that his family was leaving him.
“All the time Buck,” Steve suddenly felt like crying. Bucky wrapped his arms around his friend and decided to take him back home instead of back to the bar. He waved off the two girls who waited for them to come back. Sometimes Bucky can be quite the cold person.
They stood in front of one another awkwardly, or at least it was for him, as they both said nothing. Tony seemed to have finished putting away the items and stood as still as he could looking to the ground not really knowing what to do with himself. Steve hated this silence and distance. He was a very physical guy who loved showing affection and kinship through caring touches but it seemed that every time Steve even got within a foot of Tony’s space Tony would freeze up and close off more than before. Steve really did not know what to do but for now he will give the harpy his space for as long as he needs it.
Each image seemed to be more damning than the next. The first image was a simple one. Them at the park sitting on a bench sharing an ice cream. Steve was watching Tony take a large bite moments away from laughing. The second was of them sitting across from each other angrily looking ready to be anywhere but there but too stubborn to leave. But even under all that anger, Tony knew that he held no animosity towards Steve even in that picture when it looked like he did.
“Go talk to him. Nothing good is going to come out of this if you don’t talk. He’s in your tent by the way,” Bucky said pointing towards Steve’s tent without looking away from the current knot he was making. Steve thanked him and began to make his way to his tent.
At that moment they both prayed to the gods, the prince for the first time, and asked them of one simple favor. That they would find themselves again. That they would be together forever. Some say that at that moment a light shined off in the distance answering their prayers.
“I need to talk to you,” Bruce replied and Steve sighed trying to evade the conversation again except Bruce cut him off before he could start by saying, “it’s about Tony.”
It was not until Rhodey came to them that they had come to realize how much time had passed. Steve was really enjoying himself and seeing Tony have a little fun was a great time passer. The other harpy though looked like he was ready to get down to business and thus their training session was cut short as they followed Rhodey back to camp.
Bucky soon came up and began to tease him a bit until Steve turned to look at him. The joke died on Bucky’s lips when he saw Steve’s expression and asked him what was wrong. Steve almost couldn't say it. If he didn’t then maybe Tony was fine and that this was all some big dream but it wasn’t.
Steve looked back up to Tony’s eyes to find the harpy already staring at him as he finished the final wrap of the medicine. Steve smiled at Tony feeling his cheeks heat up at being caught staring. Tony was beautiful and sometimes he could not help but stare even if he knows he should not. “Sorry,” Steve apologized as he came to sit next to the harpy. Tony just tapped his shoulder a few times in response. Steve learned to read Tony’s touches and body language. This was meant to be a reassuring tap.
Steve pulled out his money pouch and pulled out twenty-three coins and dropped them into the man’s hand not really liking the enjoyment the man is experiencing. Still, he got to free the harpy and that was all he cared about. The man handed Steve the keys to the harpy’s cage and to his cuffs telling him that the harpy was his problem now. Steve did not care to answer.
Tony didn’t care that this was just a dream or some sick tactic to get him to spill his guts, this was his fantasy and he would get the most out of it. Plus, as he was pretty sure this wasn’t real, there was no harm in indulging...right?
Now that Steve had gotten Tony out of the cage, Steve took off his long cloak he was wearing and draped it over Tony’s body. The cloak was too big for Tony so Tony shifted around until the cloak wrapped around him comfortably enough for him to move around in. Steve thought Tony looked kind of cute with his cloak on but of course he kept that piece of information to himself.
“Are you shocked that I am a boy or that you have been asleep long enough for Howard to have a twenty-one-year-old son?” Tony snipped a bit turning his face away until he was forced to look back at the blond under him.
The truck hit a hard bump and heard a delayed warning from the driver after they had passed it followed by laughter. Steve glared at the back of the truck before answering, “Hey! Can you not drive like a moron? I could have gotten seriously hurt.”
A part of Steve wanted to fight. It was one of the few times where he felt relief. He felt happy. It helped him momentarily forget his irrational feelings. This guy had offered the release Steve needed but now cannot get.
As if taking pity on him, Sam nudged his shoulder and asked him questions about his week long quest for ingredients to see if he had any fun tales to tell. The Avengers often switched stories when they went on solo missions so that they were all in the loop with everyone’s actions and experience no matter how small. Steve was glad for the slight distraction as he began to tell them how he stole the horse and fought off a few bandits who tried to rob him without knowing who he was.
Steve wanted to tell Tony that him wanting to do better and right for his people makes him a great person. He wanted to tell Tony a lot of things at that moment but it was not his place to do so.
Leaving the mirror in one piece, Steve grabbed a newly cleaned shirt and pants. The ache began to seep back into his body. The heat returned in full blaze. But Steve ignored it.
“Who are you?” Tony asked. He froze at the sound of his voice. It sounded like him but at the same time sounded quite
“Hey Bruce,” Steve decided to greet giving him a worried and nervous smile, “can this wait for a bit?”
“Sorry about this,” Steve started wrapping his arms around Tony carefully so he can push them both into sitting position, “I tried leaving but you latched on and I know how hard it is for you to sleep so I didn't want to risk it.”
“You can let go of me now,” Tony said as Steve looked at him with a growing blush on his face. He seems to be doing that a lot lately, blushing. It was odd for him since Steve was not easily embarrassed since joining the Avengers and meeting Clint for more than a few days.
Steve spotted Bucky in the corner binding the extra cut wood together for later use. His friend looked up at Steve as he approached him. Bucky looked ready to ask a million questions but let Steve do the talking. Steve groaned and slumped down next to Bucky who rolled his eyes at him. Bucky knew he must have messed something up if Steve came to him like this.
Tony found Pepper the next day in the market. He smiled deviously at her with a somewhat giddy and worried Rhodey standing behind him. She glared at them but there was no heat in that glare just exasperation. Pepper turned to away from them trying to get back to her work of picking the fresh fruit for her mistress. She was good at ignoring them when she was actually listening. A long time ago, Tony remembered, she used to serve the Starks but she was given away to another soon after Tony's father had passed. Tony often missed her but she was happy where she was and that was all he could ask.
. He thought Steve wanted to have sex with him. All this time Tony has been treating him like his master. No wonder Tony had been distant with him but why did he treat his teammates like his equ-
“I…I don't deserve such...I am not a good person Pep,” Tony says looking at his hands, “The decisions I made or the lack of them killed many people and I will always have to work to atone for that for the rest of my life. I don't know if I can go back Pep. I don't deserve it.”
“Good morning boss,” Tony heard FRIDAY’s familiar voice, “it’s 6:28 am and your vitals are steady despite the short spike. The date is June 23rd, 2024 and you are in Independence, Oregon in your farmhouse.”
” Bucky defended putting his hands up as Steve took a swift step forward, “he would not touch a crumb until I said it would make you unhappy. I tried to even get him to leave the tent and join our group hangouts but still he did not budge. I'm sorry Stevie but Tony gave me no other option.”
“Dad!” Rhodey called smiling widely as Tony and papa Rhodes turned the corner out of the alleyway they snuck out from. Tony smiled watching Rhodey and papa Rhodes embrace and reassure each other that the other was okay. This was a joyous moment watching the father and son duo reunite. It made Tony smile alongside them. But they needed to get moving. Get back before his stepmother noticed their disappearance.
“Fighting in a battle,” Steve answered honestly but he did not elaborate further not wanting to look silly in front of her.
Steve had gotten up with the sun like he always did. He groaned a bit as the sunlight shone into the room forgetting to shut his sun-blocking curtains the night before. Though he did not mind all that much really since it gave him the time to get up to go on his daily run and head to the market to look for the perfect tools for Tony to use on the go.
“You know if you are here to beat me up do not expect to me to just lay down and take it,” Steve growled shoving his hands in his pocket to make him look unimpressed. The man was tall and wore a long trench coat with a fedora. He was totally unrecognizable in this get up and lighting. Steve hated fighting opponents that refused to show him their face. The man stepped forward as if to engage only to back up at hearing a shout from the direction of the bar. Steve knew it was Bucky. The distraction of his friend turning the corner was all the stranger needed to disappear from Steve’s presence. Annoyed, Steve just punched the brick wall instead.
Jarvis had tried on multiple occasions to report Howard’s abuse of his only son but every time was refuted. It seemed like either no one was willing to believe that the great Howard Stark would hit his child or they were paid real good to look the other way. The butler always suspected it was the latter. He tried on multiple occasions to convince the young Stark to allow him to take him away but the kid had refused to leave his mother behind. Maria Stark was quite oblivious to the situation and neither of the participating parties was willing to inform her of these events. Watching this small child suffer at the hands of his own father crushed him.
The night was getting colder and nothing on this slab of concrete seemed to work so he just lay there, letting the cold in, wondering if fate had finally decided to catch up with him. He was lucky to have escaped it the first time.
“You don’t get to speak,” Howard growled grabbing a bottle of scotch and taking a large swing from it directly from the bottle, “I have had enough of you today. Not only did you deliberately try to embarrass me, oh no, you had to make yourself seem smarter than I am. Guess what! You are not! You are just a dumb stupid little boy. You will amount to nothing. Why can’t you be more like Steve Rogers? Now he was the perfect man! Why did the world grace me with such a useless brat!”
Tony spoke his name and Steve was ready to burst. He wanted to hold Tony in his arms, kiss him silly and tell him how much he missed him, how much he fought to keep the memory of him alive.
It has been a week. That was how long it took Steve to get all the ingredients and return the horse to the stables. He made sure that the stable boy spotted Liberty trotting up to the open doors of the stable before leaving. He owed it to the horse and the boy to make sure she came back in one piece.
Finally after an hour of walking Tony, Rhodey and papa Rhodes made it back to the manor. They decided to sneak in from the forest in the back of the manor where the farm lay mostly empty and dead. Tony remembered when the ground was full of plants and harvest but that was a long time ago.
The forest was dark and unwelcoming. Steve could feel eyes on him as he took his first step into the forest. He knew they were bound for a fight so he took out his shield and waved at Bucky and Thor to take out their weapons. Thor carried around a hammer that let out strong electrical charges through magic ruins getting activated when it gathers enough energy from being thrown around, while Bucky depended on a crossbow that was self-loading. The crossbow was an old design by Dum Dum but Steve was sure Tony would have some form of improvements to the crossbow to make it more efficient once he got his hands on it of course.
Tony listened as Steve talked not uttering a word or looked away from Steve throughout his whole speech. The harpy followed where he pointed and took whatever Steve handed him. Tony did it all without complaint. Even as he did all this Steve could still see the burning fires in those eyes patiently waiting for the right time to pounce. Steve would really hate being on the other side of those claws and nails but he hoped to turn Tony around by then.
“Listen,” Pepper stepped close to him and wrapped her arms tightly around Tony's shoulders, “Rhodey and I won't be far off. If you think the situation is going sour you get the hell out of there.”
Tony met up with papa Rhodes at the back gate where all the servants and delivery boys rushed too and from trying to get their work done and their orders finished. Tony realized that he probably should shed the fancy gown to continue to go unnoticed in this part of the castle. Tony really did not want people talking about some high standing omega slumming it with the servant people. It might get back to the prince and that could lead down to him connecting unwanted dots.
Crawling under one of the said tables, Hammer pulled something out of his pocket. Tony looked at it intrigued and began to reach for it when a large farting sound erupted from the device. With a gleeful smile Hammer threw the concoction at Tony and waited. Tony just instinctively caught it. The table flap opened, a pool of light shone threw and Howard Stark’s angry face met them. He looked between Tony, the object and Hammer and decided at that moment that it was all Tony’s fault. Tony could see it in his eyes. It was also a look that said he would not change his mind either. Great, punishment later tonight was a definite thing.
Later as he sat down on his desk and checked his email for any further project updates or requests, Steve checks to make sure no one is looking before hitting the registration link. Darcy a few cubicles down is a big gossip and he really didn’t want the whole floor to know he was signing up to be matched by their company. Though he finished filling out the form pretty quickly Steve struggled to press send. He wasn’t one to hesitate but he still couldn't decide if he really wanted to do this.
It has been three weeks since Tony joined the Avengers and Steve has yet to crack the code to get Tony to talk to him. Tony seemed to get more comfortable with his team but seemed to take it upon himself to do every chore, every task, every order that Steve gave without complaint. It bugged Steve that Tony was acting less like a free person but as a caged and collared service animal. Still, Steve thought it was probably Tony trying to repay Steve for saving him though Steve could openly say he hated it. Hated how cold Tony was, how distant. No matter how hard Steve tried nothing seemed to crack Tony’s walls.
Tony tilted his head as Steve slipped the bag off his shoulder and handed it to Tony. They stood there for a bit with Tony staring at the bag before looking quickly at Steve. “It's uh, a mechanic travel bag with a travel kit inside and starter material for you to use.”
“I assure you sire we have not met,” Tony huffed as his hands wandered to play with the cloth of his omega wrobes.
“He's not property at all you ill-mannered tub of guts. Do you honestly think it's right to chain people like chattel? I demand you release him at once,” Tony pushed getting in the man’s face.
Let me know your thoughts in the comments and hopefully, the next chapter won't take two years to write
He focused his attention on Steve’s face who looked both shocked and amused at Tony’s comeback. Tony stood tall challenging the alpha prince who studied Tony’s face for a moment longer before looking at the slave driver and ordering him to release Papa Rhodes. A shock passed through Tony but rushed to the cage desperate to get to Papa Rhodes out before the prince changed his mind.
After that Steve spent a few minutes catching up with Dum Dum before leaving with a promise of returning in eight hours. Now Steve was alone and had time to find his favorite tavern to order some grub. He missed eating food he did not have to catch or preserved. Steve was going to ask Tony to come along since to get to the tavern from the market he had to pass his apartment complex.
Steve left the hot cocoa on the nightstand and hopped into the shower. He washed and dried quickly, and ran a hand through his hair to push it into place; it still felt strangely short under his fingertips.
After a torturously long moment spent with Tony teetering on the verge of orgasm, Steve tilted the angle of his head and swallowed Tony down all the way, until the head of Tony's cock bumped the back of Steve's throat. It was all so well-executed that Tony didn't even have the energy left to feel chagrined that the move drove him right over the edge.
me. Saved me from myself, whoever I thought I was there. Actually, I’m not sure that’s much different than reality.”
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said, having learned a long time ago it was a bad idea to sneak up on or otherwise startle most of his teammates.
“I’ve had my suspicions,” Steve said. “In my gut, I feel forced to be something I’m not. That’s why I went off the grid — didn’t know who to trust.”
shield, the vibranium sang in his hands and, to some extent, nearly seemed to do the work for him as he swung out and connected with sphere after sphere in the training simulation. Tony’s reflexes were still finely tuned after years of being Iron Man, and having Captain America on the sidelines of the training room cheering him on certainly didn’t hurt matters. Steve not only had encouragement down pat, but Tony was equally motivated by the desire to not make a fool of himself in front of Cap, even after all this time.
Clint plunked a mug of coffee down in front of Steve, and leaned against the counter to nurse one of his own. "Find out anything new?"
"Well, Steve," Tony said. "I've gotta be heading off before these cupcakes get frozen, but - say, the Science Club is having their annual Christmas party tomorrow at my place. Why don't you stop by? It'd be a good way to meet some of the students and the other teachers before you get to work."
"I think I can find a way to keep my mouth better occupied," Tony agrees. He pushes Steve down to sit on the bed, and goes to his knees in front of him.
Tony had certainly set out to make Steve feel welcome in the twenty-first century, and had always hoped, somewhere deep down, that their little band of superheroic misfits would stick this time. Sure, Black Widow might come and go as she pleased, Thor might sometimes get called to Asgard, and the Hulk might have an entire life on the side that none of them knew about until today, but the important thing was that they all managed to be a unit when it counted. It was not just their edge over the Cabal, but, Tony suspected, good for all of them. Himself included. So maybe his motivations weren’t entirely philanthropic, not when he had so much to gain, but it was hard to argue when Steve was looking at him with so much pride shining in his eyes.
Tony squirmed, a low whine in the back of his throat, and Steve leaned down to silence him with a kiss. Tony wasn’t, strictly speaking, one for restraints, but he loved occasionally getting manhandled a little by Steve, and a day like today – a day where they got a good workout but the threats they faced were neither world- nor life-ending ones – when they were feeling playful with each other, was the best time for it. He always felt secure, pinned by Steve this way, and Steve knew it; Steve always seemed to know what Tony needed, when he needed it.
Tony was silent for a moment; he looked like he was contemplating the deep meaning of life. "Well. Listen, Steve - I'm gonna get back to mingling, but I hope you enjoy yourself. Make sure you grab one of those cupcakes before you leave - I think the kids left a few."
“The House of Wittelsbach are no friends of Hitler,” Natasha said. “They fled to Hungary some years ago, and, if all this is true, were forced to leave behind the obligation they inherited from Ludwig. My sources suggest this music box holds the key.”
"I can't do that, can I?" Tony wondered. He couldn't imagine Howard would approve. But, a little voice in his head reminded him, Howard wasn't going to be around to approve or disapprove of any of his decisions, anymore.
The man sways, and Steve reaches out to steady him when he realizes the back of the man's shirt is wet.
Steve took it all like a champ, swallowing and licking and sucking Tony clean. When he was done, he pulled off Tony's cock, helped Tony neatly back into his trousers, and got to his feet to right his own clothes.
Tony didn't question it, when Steve got out his cell phone and started firing off a text message to Natasha, but he wasn't telling her about his plans, which she already knew of; he was alerting her to the presence of the mysterious sedan. She texted back almost immediately that she would look into it, and after that, he put his phone away, not wanting to be rude.
Tony closed his eyes, unable to bring himself to look at Jarvis any longer. "I don't want it," he said, the words very difficult to push past the lump in his throat. "I want to ... to build things, to help people, and there's no way anyone's going to accept that. I know better than to think I get to be the head of the company in anything more than name."
By the time Tony’s hand came down to wrap around Steve’s cock - Steve determinedly, stubbornly, leaving things very literally in his lover’s capable hands - Steve felt like the slightest stimulation would send him right over the edge, he was so wound up from their languorous pace. Tony stroked him once, twice, then Steve was spilling into Tony’s hand.
"Frank Finlay is long dead," Pepper says. "But my newspaper career is off to the right start. If only my grandmother could see me now - she was a suffragette, you know? I'm the first generation of Potts women born with the right to vote."
Whatever this was, it probably needed further analysis. But there was plenty of time for that later; letting this be their little secret for now, well, that wouldn't be so bad.
Zola's train will be passing by Steve's location right about now; if both their missions are successful, then they will have taken two of Hydra's remaining major players off the board, leaving only the Red Skull. And once Johann Schmidt is taken care of, the rest of Hydra should crumble, leaderless and directionless, and no longer a threat to the Allied cause. The idea of this damned war ending is almost too good to be true, even though victory is so close that most days, Tony can almost taste it.
Agent Coulson went on to give Steve and Natasha the details of their available cover; the job openings were for a guidance counselor and a librarian. Natasha quickly claimed guidance counselor, which Steve was secretly relieved over, given he didn't consider himself a very good choice for giving advice to young people.
"Thanks." Tony padded into the kitchen, found a mug in the cabinet over the coffee maker, and poured himself a cup. He skipped the cream and sugar, but helped himself to a glazed donut from the box on his way back into the living room.
Steve shakily has a seat on the couch and draws the vial from his pocket. He turns it over in his fingers again, but can't fathom what it is, or what it's for. Sternberg had said that Tony would know.
"Is he, is Tony, alright?" Steve asks, refusing to let Namor get the better of him just now. Steve needs the man's help, and even more now, he needs information.
Steve pulled away from their frantic kissing long enough to pull the shield from his back, though it did not go far from reach, propped against the edge of the coffee table. He groaned when Tony’s hand found the bulge in his pants and palmed his cock.
He glanced around, shrugged to himself, and sat down on the couch to play another few levels of Tiny Robots.
doing, yet, except for calling attention away from the undercover operative, and trying to locate the missing scientists.
"No." Steve doesn't even bother sitting down, he just walks to Tony and gently pries the glass from his hand.
“Except we were them, and they were us,” Steve pointed out. “Even if we were bad at the villainy part of things.”
The drive into the city from the port takes a while, and after Steve exhausts small talk with the driver - subtly picking the man for information - he lapses into brooding silence.
“I handed leadership over to you,” Tony said. “I said I would back your play, then I kept ignoring everything you asked me to do.”
Tony's eyes widen for a moment before he hastily swipes a hand under his nose. "Oh," he says. "It's nothing."
"Whatever your reasons were for leaving, Tony," Steve says, opening his eyes again. "I'm sure they were valid ones. Look, I ... shouldn't have said some of the things I did about your leaving. I was just hurt that you didn't say goodbye to me, but I know it's not about me."
Tony is too absorbed in his intense concentration on the moment to add much to their conversation. When Anthony begins to squirm with impatience, though, Tony finally pulls back to prep himself, rolling on a condom and adding what is probably an obscene amount of lube, but he wants to make sure everything goes smoothly - literally and figuratively.
Facing the rest of the day is a bit more of a challenge, but the whole machine goes better when lubricated with a bit of alcohol; it's gin, today, a few martinis, devolving into gin and tonics when he no longer feels coherent enough to put on a show of mixing a proper cocktail.
Steve completely misses - or willfully ignores - the sarcasm, because he answers, “That might not be a bad idea.”
Steve glances down at himself and flushes, remembering that he's naked. He reaches for Tony's robe, discarded across the bed, and angrily shrugs into it. It's a bit snug on Steve in the shoulders, but it's a far sight better than being naked in front of a fellow agent.
“None for me, thanks, JARVIS,” Tony said. He lifted a gauntleted hand in a weak wave. “I just want to sleep this off. The post-power cosmic feeling is like about the worst hangover ever.”
“You wanna do some trust exercises?” Tony asked, a wry smile in his tone of voice. “Fall backwards. I’ll catch you.”
Steve's shoulder catches her right in the stomach, and she goes down hard with the force of his momentum, gasping for breath as the air is knocked from her lungs.
Steve stopped, abruptly, his hand on the small of Tony's back. "Hang on," he said between kisses. "Wait --"
"This is Obadiah Stane," said Fury. "He took over as CEO of Stark Industries when Howard Stark died. We have reason to believe he is aware of Tony's whereabouts and possibly even complicit in convincing him to stay away."
Steve turns to the rest of the room and does a quick but thorough sweep through, flipping through books and magazines, shaking newspapers. He's surprised, and could groan at the obviousness of it, when he finds an address jotted on a note pad beside the telephone. The handwriting is clearly Tony's, a local address with '10 a.m.' and the date of the day before, jotted next to it. The knowledge of an appointment takes some of the sting out of Tony having left Steve in bed the morning before, at least.
Tony was distracted, distracted by getting his hand around Steve’s cock, distracted by the way Steve’s big, strong hand was jerking him in return, so he gave a confused and undignified flail when the room started to turn on end, until he realized Steve was shifting them around, and Tony ended up planted on his back against the couch cushions.
Steve looked up, a sheepish smile spreading across his face, and he lowered the phone, holding it behind his back as if they hadn't already seen what he was doing. "Sorry, what was that?"
"Nonsense." Tony drapes Steve's suit jacket over his desk chair, careful not to wrinkle it since Steve will need to wear it on his way out tomorrow. "These uniforms
Tony smiles at that, and allows himself to relax a little while he and Steve finish their meal. They're down to the last breadstick by the time the monitoring equipment begins to beep and, a few yards away, Tony's alternate groans.
Steve kisses further down the side of Tony's neck, and pauses with his chin resting on Tony's shoulder. "Why not?" he wonders.
"Hail Hydra," a very familiar voice says from behind her, and Steve tries not to start in surprise as a hooded figure steps out of the crowd.
Unfortunately, Tony’s attempts at social avoidance with his new neighbors are thwarted by the determined curiosity of Captain America; the fact that Steve Rogers, the young soldier behind the cowl, is big and blond and very good looking certainly doesn’t hurt.
"With pleasure," Zemo answers. The repulsor charges up with a whine, and he spins to turn it on Madame Hydra.
"Shit," Steve mutters under his breath. He backs away from the door and retrieves his handgun from its holster, and waits beside the doorjamb.
When they arrived at the penthouse, Clint and Natasha headed off to take Crossbones and Grim Reaper into SHIELD custody, while Thor and the Hulk took on dinner duties, which just meant they were going to go squabble for fifteen or twenty minutes on the merits of curry versus greasy diner food, before finally letting JARVIS take it upon himself to order the team a few dozen pizzas.
Steve rolled his eyes behind the faceplate - not that Tony could see him do it - and fumbled at the helmet while Tony walked through the armor disassembly.
“That morning, right after you moved in,” Tony said. “Here, in the kitchen ... that was kind of big for us.”
Steve shifted to one side without thinking, and grunted as the bullet made impact with his torso. He could tell from the expression on Tony's face that Tony didn't register what had just happened, at least until the spread of blood began to seep through Steve's sweater, warm under Tony's palm.
While Tony couldn’t make much out of the Captain’s face where he was backlit in the hall, there was something in the deep, rich tone of the man’s voice that was soothing to Tony. That called on Tony to
"Me, too," Steve admits with a little smile. He doesn't tell her that he's hardly stopped thinking of Tony since the day he met the man.
The people who had been standing outside - along with a few who were previously indoors - were scattering everywhere in a panic, screaming or shouting questions or yelling for an ambulance. The fireworks still going off in the sky above only added to the chaos.
As Tony Carbonell got his first job, apartment, and began to make friends, it became easier and easier not to look back, until Tony Stark had begun to be a distant memory even to the man himself.
"I can't say too much about it," Steve says regretfully. The assignment is a covert one, investigating Hydra activity in Madripoor. Director Fury wants Steve there in a more obvious fashion than most SHIELD agents would employ, to throw Hydra off the scent of an actual undercover operative who has infiltrated their ranks. "I'll probably miss a couple of our lunches, but I'll keep in touch."
Steve begins to answer, but Tony leans in before Steve can speak, and presses their lips together. It's weak of him, but Steve gives in, tightening his arms around Tony's waist and slowly returning the kiss.
Gradually, reality had to come crashing back in, and the longer they lay there, the more conscious Steve became of the sheen of perspiration drying on his skin, the way it made their bodies stick together where they touched. He was lying on a wet patch on the sheets, and Tony was growing restless, too, finally giving in to the inexorable demands of biology when he had to raise up and pull out.
Tony’s jaw dropped, and he knew he looked ridiculous with his mouth hanging open, as he searched for words. “I ... what?”
“Just doing a little light reading.” Steve nodded to the StarkPad in indication. “I wouldn’t mind some company, though.”
“No,” Steve said. He lifted his arm so that Tony could settle in at his side, and brought it back down around Tony’s shoulders. “I mean, I
The plan was good, and it came together with the kind of ease that had all the members of the team sliding right into place like they had been working together for years — which, if their suspicions were true, they
"I'm not saying you should have sex with him," she went on. "Just that if he flirts, you should be prepared to flirt back. Coulson probably knew that Stark has a type, and - well, you're it. Probably we're both it."
"You can watch," Steve said, with a distinctly mischievous note in his voice as he reached down to touch himself.
"Do you see?" Zemo adds. "Together, we have accomplished what my predecessor, what Baron von Strucker, what the Red Skull himself never could!"
The Iron Man was still, only the occasional noisy whirring of the servo motors as its occupant fidgeted or stirred giving away that it was not entirely empty. The metal was worked to a high polish today - Mr. Jarvis must have been busy at work for the last week hammering out all the bullet dents - and was much sharper in person than Steve had ever pictured in the past, based on the painted illustrations inside the pages of
Steve smiled, leaning in to kiss Tony on the cheek. “If all your working sessions were like this, I’d get really jealous.”
"Well," Tony said, hefting his nameplate into his hands. "Mr. Carbonell had a good run while he lasted."
"Please," Tony says. "I might have left the States, but I've still got eyes and ears there, Captain. Or should I say 'Commander,' now? Tell me,
They settled down at the kitchen table, finding a place for their dishes among the scattering of arrows and computer parts and pizza boxes piled on its surface, and ate in companionable silence for a long few minutes before Tony spoke again.
He gets up and tugs on his trousers, and double checks the apartment to make sure all signs of Tony's presence are gone. In the light of early morning, the place looks even shabbier than it had the night before. The living space is divided up into a sitting area, which half runs into the space where the bed and a rickety dresser comprise a bedroom of sorts. Under the window is a tiny table with two chairs; the surface of the table is covered in precariously stacked papers.
The water is warm, and finally soothes some of the aches and pains of travel from Steve's tired limbs. He sighs softly and tilts his head against the lip of the tub, content with Tony's head on his shoulder.
Tony laughs softly. "The fact that your mind didn't automatically go somewhere dirty with that shows you are a far better man than me, Steve."
“I missed you, too,” Steve said, and he followed the words with a kiss that had a little something bittersweet to it, or maybe he was just imagining that part of things, tired and addled as he was.
The car lasted as far as a late winter storm in Cedar Falls, Iowa, where it determinedly refused to start back up after getting coated in a layer of ice. Tony was running low on money at that point, and beginning to fear that if he called Obadiah for help, that might lead Obie to request he return to New York, especially since the media was
Fury gazed at Steve for a long moment, his single eye serious, searching. He keyed up another photo in the slideshow, this an older man, bald and bearded.
"I hate castles," Tony still complains, maneuvering his armor with loud clanking sounds across the rickety bridge. "My last time in one wasn't exactly a party."
There are footsteps on the staircase now, shortly followed by someone throwing their weight against the door. The door itself is already shaking on its hinges, and isn't likely to hold much longer.
Lowtown is already alive with activity by the time Steve emerges onto the street level. He stops in for lunch at the restaurant on the bottom floor of the building, and peruses the day's newspaper that was left on the counter by some patron before him.
Steve sneaked a glance across the jet at Tony, but Tony looked as casual as he ever did in the armor as he leaned over the co-pilot's seat to chat with Natasha.
Steve worries about the defensibility of their position, but decides he will have to make it work. He draws his own pistol from his shoulder holster once he has a moment, and backs down the stairs after Sternberg. Steve can hear the intruders moving around in other parts of the house, gradually growing closer.
Steve glanced up with a mischievous look on his face, but he was merciful and chose not to tickle Tony, likely aware that it would hardly be pleasant under the circumstances. Instead, Steve shifted his way further down Tony's body, until he was situated between Tony's legs, hands framing Tony's hips and breath warm where his mouth hovered tantalizingly close over Tony's straining erection.
With that they parted ways and Tony was just one step closer to getting Papa Rhodes back. A small bit of anxiety seeped into his bones. The only formal training Tony had as a proper was through what little his father taught him. He hoped that it was enough. Or this was not going to work.
Steve nodded raising his hand to signal the rest of the team to come out. And slowly the team came into view nervously still holding their weapons tightly in their grasp. Steve told them to put away their weapons that the harpies were not of any danger...yet.
Steve was lost in thought as they approached the camp. Tony had wrapped his arm around Steve’s pulling him along beside him as if knowing Steve was not paying attention to where he was going. The harpy seemed adamant to stick close to Steve’s side letting his growing wings brush up against Steve’s back. It was a nice sensation Steve noted in the back of his mind as he paid attention to his surroundings once again.
“Come I will show you our makeshift home,” Steve urged Tony forward with a wave of his hand. Tony waited until there was a bit of distance between them before moving behind him. Steve internally sighed but pushed on not letting himself get bothered by Tony’s actions. He just wanted to, as Bucky would call it, mother hen Tony into a nice warm blanket and some healing patches that Bruce carried around with him.
“It’s okay big guy,” Tony smiled at Thor who turned his confusion to Tony instead, “he is talking about…he is talking about…”
The path back to the base camp was hard since they needed not to be spotted but to take as many main routes as possible to get to their final destination. Still, they managed to avert any curious bystanders and warriors. If Steve were another man he would have never been able to move Happy as fast as he did during that time and it probably would have cost the harpy his life.
Assistant Principal Philip Coulson seemed to share exactly two things in common with Tony Carbonell: a love of doughnuts, and a particular interest in Captain America. It was therefore unsurprising when Tony appeared at first sight of the box Phil brought into the teachers lounge, with a Captain America coffee mug clutched in one hand.
Tony headed down I-95 from there, managing to take Rhodey with him all the way to Florida. After a youth spent vacationing in all sorts of exotic locations with his wealthy parents, Tony had seen precious little of America, and he'd turn off the highway on a whim to see the birthplace of a Founding Father or something as random as a national park. They spent two days touring the different branches of the Smithsonian (where Rhodey made fun of Tony for getting Polaroids of himself at all angles with the exhibit on Captain America), sampled North Carolina barbecue, stopped for a ghost walk in South Carolina, and finally found themselves at Disney World, where Tony had actually never been. Tony collected a wealth of pictures riding the teacups and posing with Mickey Mouse, and if the guy inside the costume recognized him, well, it wasn't like he was allowed to break character and call him out on it.
Now that Tony had a moment to get a good look at her, she appeared younger than he'd initially guessed, though that might have been the dressed down quality of the yoga pants and sweatshirt she was wearing, combined with her lack of makeup, and her hair up in a ponytail. Still, she gave off a certain air of
"It wasn't designed for war," Tony admits, stepping up to regard the armor alongside Steve. "Any more than I was. And when this whole damn mess is over, I hope I can go back to what I was meant to do."
Steve reached up and grabbed a handful of tissues from a box on the end table to clean them both off, righting their clothes before he settled down again. Steve nudged Tony around until they lay with Tony on his back, Steve on his side next to Tony, half-draped over him.
is familiar, the desperate slow slide, too much and not enough all at once. Tony is sloppier than Steve remembers, probably uncoordinated with drunkenness; Steve isn't sure this would be happening at all without liberal application of bourbon, but he doesn't have the heart to stop it.
He was careful in trudging his way back to the house, through the snow blanketing the ground that had hardened and become icy since the sun went down. Steve got back inside and found many of the kids - and their parents - were packing up to leave. By the time they had all filed out, the remaining party was adults, and someone cheerfully declared the beginning of "after hours!" before the music cranked up.
“I … you know, I don’t know, either.” Steve paused. “Maybe because you get into an office and your brain won’t shut off, and you come up with young superhero scholarship funds.”
Choosing to set that thought aside in favor of action, Steve ran toward the cockpit and launched himself into one of the seats, as Black Widow joined him in the other pilot’s seat and took the controls with the kind of confidence that further cemented Steve’s theory.
Back at the mansion, after they were showered and changed and adequately fussed over by Jarvis, Tony was installed on the couch in front of the fireplace with a huge mug of hot cocoa (bobbing with marshmallows) and a warm blanket. As it turned out, he had probably sprained something -- Tony's vote was: his entire body -- in the altercation with the Krampus, and had been ordered to rest and relaxation by Jarvis.
Tony’s door was first, and it was open, so he steered them inside, only to cringe when he found the mess lurking behind from earlier. “I guess I should clean this up.”
"She's coming back with me from New York, you know," Steve answers. "She wants to visit. Jarvis is coming in the dirigible to pick me up."
At midnight, they decided to go ahead and exchange gifts, and Steve didn't argue, given he couldn't imagine either Clint or Natasha feeling up to it the next morning. He was touched by the gift of a novel and a new notebook from Natasha, and laughed good naturedly at the American flag boxers from Clint.
By the time Steve was finished, Tony felt a weird combination of aroused and boneless, melted into the mattress and far too comfortable to move. He turned his head on the pillow in his best half-hearted attempt to look at Steve.
"Mmhm," Anthony answers. He stills his hips and pitches forward, leaning onto Steve's chest in a deliberate pose that would be almost casual, if not for the circumstances. "That alright with you?"
"Are you sure we can't come up with some non-bruise-aggravating way to have sex?" Tony asked, a little plaintively, as he looked up at Steve.
For all the fact that Stark probably also shares the similarity of being a genius with Tony, he seems to need a moment to digest all their sudden hospitality. "Yes," he says at last, using Steve's assistance in swinging his legs off the table. "A shower sounds fabulous, I'm sticky in places ... well."
They sat at the table by the window and ate in companionable silence for a while, until Tony's knowing stare became a bit too intense for Steve to endure.
To Tony's surprise, Fury consents to Cap's inclusion in the magazine. Pepper is delighted to have a means of breathing new life into her tales - adventure stories not being quite so easy when no real adventures are being had - and, as a fan, Steve is thrilled to get to be a part.
"The legacy of Zemo must live on," von Strucker says. "Never could a successor be decided on ... I don't know how I couldn't see it. What is more fitting than for the Stark men to carry on the line?"
Natasha's snort cut off Tony's statement, not that he even knew where he was going with it, exactly.
"I understand," Anthony says. He glances around the lab, before offering Tony a small smile. "It's weird, how many things are the same, how many are similar but slightly off. I'm sure some are just entirely different."
"So," Tony says, around a bite of wonderfully cheesy pasta. "Are you allowed to tell me how the rest of your mission went?"
"Commander," he says gravely, reaching up to press a vial into Steve's grasp. "Do not allow this to fall into their hands."
Tony wore. He tugged them down until he could get a hand around Tony’s cock; Tony groaned and pushed into the strong grip of Steve’s fingers, his own hands fumbling at Steve’s pants, softly cursing between kisses that Steve had chosen to wear more difficult clothes.
Tony takes them back to the building that houses his makeshift workshop, which has a modest set of living quarters attached. He's grateful for Jim's foresight in arranging for this place, though Tony is sure Jim didn't intend it
Thor flew from the craft and Hulk dropped out to plummet to the ground beneath. Steve was in limbo as he watched, torn between being awed by the powers of the Asgardian in person, as Thor summoned a wind tunnel around them, and feeling that the entire thing was ... desperately familiar. Like Tony said: an itch that Steve just couldn’t scratch.
Obadiah was another matter entirely. Tony felt worse than he would have imagined possible over that betrayal. Obadiah had always been so encouraging and supportive of Tony's wishes and his happiness; having Obadiah and Jarvis in his life had often provided Tony with a place to turn when friction with his father became too much. Twenty-five years was a long time, though, and surely it didn't take too much of Tony's absence for Obadiah's attitude to sour. Obadiah probably thought he was owed the company after a quarter century of caring for it in Tony's absence; it was the sort of thing that, actually, Tony could have felt - and once did feel - grateful for, if only Obadiah hadn't crossed a line.
"No." Steve shakes his head, giving Stark's shoulder a comforting squeeze before Steve takes his hands back to himself.
Steve takes a deep breath, fighting with his own gut instinct between trusting her and doubting everything she has to say. But it seems an awfully elaborate ruse, and every second he teeters on the decision is another second Tony has to spend in the hands of the enemy.
Once Tony was finished, he ran a hand through his helmet-flattened hair, and glanced down at himself, pulling a face. "Grim Reaper's got really bad taste, and blue is
Steve, lost somewhere in that ramble between 'pitchfork' and 'whatever,' placed his hands on Tony's waist to steady him, and leaned in for a more enthusiastic kiss than earlier. It was true, he really
Steve brushed his fingertips around the metal lip of the casing, then smoothed them across the surface, huffing a little laugh of surprise. “It’s warm.”
"Oh, so now you're just leaving?" Tony groused. He loved it, though; Captain America, stopping by for lunch and a quickie.
Steve flushed slightly, and looked away. "Not exactly. I know you can take care of yourself, and that Director Fury will make sure you have plenty of people there to watch your back."
Sternberg immediately crosses to the counter and begins gathering up bottles and vials. He uncaps them hastily, and pours their contents down the drain of the nearby handwashing sink.
Steve stands slowly, and to his surprise finds that the woman - the same one Steve swept from her feet - is indeed standing there with her hands raised in the air in a gesture of defeat. She quirks an eyebrow and gives him a once-over, unabashed about it.
The thought was enough to jar Tony back to reality for a moment - to wonder what the hell he was doing - but then Steve kissed him again, soft and sweet, and he batted Tony’s hand away to stroke Tony off himself, his large hand engulfing Tony’s cock in warmth and the kind of friction that sent a shiver down his spine.
The strangest thing in Steve's life was quickly becoming the fact that he enjoyed spending time with Tony. Moreover, it was exactly what he'd
"Hmm." Steve leaned down and kissed him; Tony could still taste himself on Steve's tongue. "I'll see you later."
Steve has assigned Anthony to one of those very rooms, the one least often used, and closest to Tony's bedroom. It makes sense, in case Anthony needs anything ... or tries to go snooping around.
"Steve Rogers," Steve answers, getting up to shake the doctor's hand. "Are you the same Dr. Banner who worked on the -"
Steve walked over to the side of the bed, and set down a glass of water and a pair of pills on the nightstand. He must have recently showered, too, judging from the loose pajama pants Tony could see from the knee down where Steve stood. He was barefoot, too, which was sort of cute.
"Truth serum," Tony lies. "He was trying to get information from me. I suppose I had a bad reaction."
Tony pushes open the workshop doors and strides inside. The room, a temporary setup, is not quite the sophisticated Stark Labs facility that Steve was expecting, but all his potential for disappointment vanishes when he lays eyes on the armor.
Which was why he found himself standing on a rooftop at four in the morning, muttering to himself about what a stupid idea this was, about how Steve wasn’t even going to show, when there came the sound of boots softly thudding onto the roof behind him.
“Huh.” Tony stared at the screen for a long moment. “Let’s keep tabs on our mystery man, see what comes out of it. We might have an ally on our hands.”
Steve paused, a line of consternation drawn between his eyebrows, but that hint of concern was gone almost as quickly as it had appeared, and he offered an easy smile. “Okay.”
, and he neatly filed away that information - along with the mention of Tony's friend 'Rhodey' - for later investigation. It was clear by now, though, that Tony knew who he was ... and simply chose to live life as Tony Carbonell, rather than Tony Stark.
, anyway, since Tony found time for company other than his own hand? It was risky to date, given his secrets -- and yet here he was about to screw a guy who ran around in a mask, saving old ladies from muggers, or something.
"That it is." Pepper gives him an arch look. "You know, a lot of men and women alike would hate to think that they didn't get credit for their many accomplishments."
Steve feels himself flush, and he turns his hot face against his arm, but he doesn't try to deny the words. "Tony, please."
Tony made a surprised sound when Steve spun him around and bent him right across his desk. Steve swept an arm out, pushing things aside (but considerately, not
Steve was on edge for the rest of the drive to the party, periodically glancing at the wing mirror to see if any headlights seemed to be following them.
Agent Barton had an expression on his face like he'd just sucked on a lemon. Steve figured it was because he hadn't been pinpointed for inclusion in any part of the mission, yet.
"A damn shame. You mean you never tried it, either?" Tony wonders, as he steers them down a long corridor toward his workshop.
“Meet the MacGuffin Ray,” Tony said, bringing up three-dimensional holographic schematics of what looked, actually, like a very impressive rifle.
Steve nodded carefully and looked around their makeshift campsite again. His own parachute had been his makeshift pillow, and Iron Man offered over a canteen still heavy with water. Steve took it and drank gratefully; the water was ice cold from exposure to the elements.
They descended into silence again, but this time it was more companionable than awkward. As it turned out, the music montage was the conclusion of the documentary segment, and Natasha stopped the program once the credits were rolling, taking them back to the main menu of the streaming video service.
. The sad photo was still inside, of young Tony with a robot looking on as he blew out the candles on his cake.
"That was the hottest thing I've ever only peripherally been a part of," Tony said, when it felt right to break the silence again.
Steve sent back a response of "Merry Christmas!" anyway, and was surprised when his phone pinged again a moment later.
Tony was the one to walk them back toward his desk, keeping Steve bent over uncomfortably for the sake of continuing to kiss. Steve didn't mind, too busy getting his hand down Tony's pants, stroking him the rest of the way to hardness - though, if Tony was being honest with himself, he'd have to admit the excitement started in around the time Steve stepped into his office earlier.
Steve hovered over him, a warm and heavy weight, strong enough to hold himself effortlessly on one arm, though, of
Tony had no idea what he was doing with Steve, but given his long history of stability in the life of Tony Carbonell, Tony supposed he was due a few rash decisions at this point in time. Steve was handsome, nice, funny, and who could say no to Captain America, really? Of course, thinking about Steve being Captain America was a whole other can of worms to open. Tony knew, in all fairness, they both had their issues. It was probably nothing to think too hard about, until he had gotten back and taken care of business with Obadiah.
"That gauntlet you had fit like a glove," Steve says. He winds his arms around Tony and pitches his voice low. "I'm sure you can make armor that's like a second skin."
When Tony came, it was like it surprised him; he spilled hard and messily between them, the shout that escaped his throat unlikely to
Steve had been to exactly three parties since waking up in the twenty-first century, including this one; the first was a SHIELD sanctioned office birthday party for one of the administrative assistants in the New York office, which had included a large sheet cake but no more alcohol than could be fervently - but quietly - passed around in a couple of flasks, and the second probably didn't even count as a party by most people's standards, as it was merely Thanksgiving dinner spent watching Clint and Natasha try to drink each other under the table.
Tony allowed Steve to steer him to the table, and into a chair. Steve pressed a kiss to Tony's temple, then turned to the refrigerator.
Sternberg slams the door shut once they're inside, and Steve blinks as his eyes adjust to the well-lit space. The laboratory looks very sophisticated, much more than Steve would have expected out of the basement of a house. It seems to have Tony Stark's fingerprints all over it.
“You okay?” Steve asked and Tony looked at him with a  small smile on his face, “I got you something, or well, some things.”
“I will be back in three days time,” Steve told Bucky as he clipped the shield on his back, “take care of him for me Buck.”
“Firebird you have grown on all of us and it may have taken us a little longer to see underneath the surface but you are a good as any of us, you are one of us. All of us has red in our ledger that we would like to wipe out but doesn't mean we are not good people. A good person is not someone who doesn't make mistakes but instead tries to rectify them the best they can,” Nat followed with her own words of support.
“Looks like someone is awake,” Rhodey spoke up pulling Tony’s focus from his thoughts. Tony smiled softly at his friend as he got up from his spot and began to unhook himself from the machines. Rhodey shook his head amused knowing full well that there wasn’t any way to keep Tony in bed let alone the medbay for longer than Tony deemed necessary.
It wasn't until Steve took down his last foe when he noticed that there was no one else to fight. Stane was stuck to the stage being held down at arrow point by Clint and Bucky while Tony stood center stage with Pepper and Rhodey, who joined a bit after the fight had begun, looking towards the confused bystanders. Steve saw Nat, Sam Bruce, and Thor move out of sight to let Tony be center stage.
Papa Rhodes was standing nervously to the side of the gate looking around for Tony to show up. He really did not want to jinx his luck so Tony rushed forward through the crowd and met with papa Rhodes as swiftly as he could. The moment Tony was within arm’s reach papa Rhodes pulled the omega in for a big hug. It was safe. Tony felt safe in those arms. This man was like a father to him and to know he was going to be okay made him happier than anything else could.
Steve dropped his hands from Tony's shoulders; he could feel his own face fall, but he tried to fight it. "Is that what you want?" he asked.
It was still relatively early evening, but Steve was uncharacteristically exhausted. He made it no further than removing the top layer of his armor shirt and his boots before sinking down to the edge of his bed to stare out the window at the view of the city beyond.
And yet, after several years of working together, Steve would count Iron Man among his closest friends. He was just as comfortable sitting in the belly of the dirigible, waiting to deploy, across from this stony-faced armor, as he would have been with Bucky or any of the other Invaders.
"The more he does know," said Coulson, "the more he'll give himself away. I believe the key is forcing Stark to a point where the evidence is irrefutable."
Tony presses the handkerchief into Steve's hand, and realizes Steve is still wearing his gloves ... along with all the rest of his uniform.
Tony startled awake and spent a moment blinking in sleepy confusion before accepting Clint’s hand up. “I see the answer to ‘are we there yet’ is ‘yes.’”
Steve can't decide whether he wants to punch him or kiss him. "No, Tony. I'm not here to arrest you."
"This will likely be the last time we see each other, Mr. Stark," von Strucker says. "I'd like you to be comfortable."
Tony sighs. "Right, sorry." He gestures to the bundle of clothes sitting on the end of the lab table. "Steve brought you some clothes. There's a shower, if you want to clean up a little. Are you hungry?"
"I did." Peggy looks sorry, but Steve doubts the sincerity of it. He doubts a great many things right about now.
Steve had his back to the door and Tony was feeling daring - it was three in the morning after all, who was actually going to catch them? - so he freed Steve’s cock from his pants (delighting in the fact Steve was going commando; God bless laundry day) and gave him a healthy stroke, from base to tip.
Steve tucks the vial inside his coat pocket, and glances around the lab again to assess his options. If he stays, it's just himself and a handgun against however many men are on the other side of that door. Even if Steve is a very lucky shot and has enough ammunition for them all, the lab provides minimal chances of cover should he be rushed.
"I still say you could come with me," Steve says. "But since I know you won't ... well, I think Madripoor is the perfect place for me. I can operate out of the Stinger base."
"It might have something to do with the present I planned to have you unwrap on Christmas morning," Steve mumbled.
They abandon their bath after, drying off with fluffy towels and dropping back into bed so that Tony can bring Steve off with his mouth, slick fingers sliding into Steve's ass.
Tony wakes the next morning with pleasantly sore muscles and the distinct memory of the night before right at the forefront of his mind. He raises his head to find himself weighed down by Steve's arm draped over his waist, and Anthony spooned up against Steve's back. For once, Steve doesn't wake as soon as Tony shows signs of it, but Anthony is awake already. Tony risks waking Steve in order to lean across the space for a kiss.
"I don't know what I think," Steve says. He's being honest. "Tony went through a lot, during the war. We all did, but you know how hard the armor was on his heart. Maybe ... maybe he just retired."
Tony’s stubborn expression softened. “Steve,” he said quietly. “All I want is to look outside and see this city is still standing, and
"About today," Steve finally blurts. He shifts his weight from one foot to the other, a self-conscious gesture that does not seem to belong to such a powerful man. "On the deck."
“About two and a half kilometers from the castle ruins,” she said. “I dug you out and we got this far before the armor started to power down. We’re northeast of our extraction point, but I radioed Jarvis that our plans have changed. He should be here soon.”
The Captain raised a hand and pushed back the dark cowl that obscured his features. In the dim light of the penthouse foyer, his face solidified into a full picture, high cheekbones and a straight nose joining the strong jaw and terribly blue eyes. His hair was blond, suiting his fair skin well. “You can call me Steve.”
"Hmm." Tony walked over to stand beside him, trying to project understanding and not judgment before he admitted, "Okay. I’m not going to pretend I understand."
Tony peered at Steve for a moment. "He's spoken pretty highly of you to the other members of the faculty," he said. "I get it, though. Don't wanna talk about your new boss the first day of the job."
In retrospect, after a few hours' sleep and thinking with a clearer head, Steve has to admit that coming here and immediately falling into bed with Tony probably hadn't been his best idea. It's too late now, though, and Steve refuses to feel guilty about it. After two years of separation, they needed the connection, and Tony always had used sex as a coping mechanism, when the booze failed him.
Suddenly though he was not in the camp anymore. The yellow field and armor personnel disappeared and instead found himself in a place from a dream…
They all took the liberty of  introducing themselves to Tony and Steve introduced Tony in turn. It seemed to tick Nat off at the fact that Tony refused to talk but she will get over it pretty quick. She is not the type to hold onto feelings and first impressions. She too was a silent type herself so she probably get along great with Tony soon enough. Tony probably would join the silent meditation sessions that Nat and Bruce sometimes have.
Tony had not been in Steve’s tent since they had bought him his own tent a few days ago. It was set up across the camp from his so he knew Tony would not mistake Steve’s for his own. Maybe Tony wanted to finally talk with him and they could actually become friends! It was unclear to Steve until now why he was so adamant about becoming Tony’s friend but Steve was stubborn and once he made a choice he often did not back down from it.
And that was Tony's family. Right here are the people who he considers as good as blood. Steve wished he was on that very short list but a part of him wanted something different, something more. He ignored those feelings.
“They are having quite the pissing contest,” Clint shouted from a few trees away which made the group laugh.
“What was that back at the bar, punk?” Buck started as he stepped closer to him. His friend took his bleeding hand into his and led him back to the street. Steve waited for the oncoming lecture that Bucky
The Colonel gave him a questioning look and even more so when Steve asked for one name. When the older man confirmed Steve’s concerns he instantly began to wonder how they were going to save him and the rest of the men but from the looks the Colonel was giving him he knew that was not going to happen.
“Steve,” Tony said his name with such softness that he almost missed it. He had not realized how tense he has gotten while his thoughts ran wild through his mind. Instead, he shook his head letting the emotions wash through him. If it were up to him he would have gone toe to toe with the villager no matter how much of a scene it would create but the man had already run and Tony seemed like he really did not want that.
“Hey Ma,” Steve grumbled at her tiredly smiling. She smiled back letting her fingers weave through his hair. Steve loved it when Bucky or his mother did that. It soothed him. Reminded Steve of
In hindsight, this was probably a pretty bad idea but Tony was already here and he never did anything halfway. So here he sat on the windowsill of the third-floor window of a secret government building that was on a map he found in his fa-How-fuck
A chuckle escaped Steve’s lips as he pulled Tony fully against himself, forcing Tony to feel the hard muscles of his chest and his morning wood pressing against Tony’s ass. Then in sudden and quick movements, Steve began to manhandle Tony until he was gently resting against the large pillows and headboard, facing Steve fully. Tony spread his legs out a bit as if inviting the other man to take what he wanted, feeling nervous and excited at where this was going.
