The Demon dropped him, but didn’t seem angry—instead he laughed, throwing his arms wide, revealing the arsenal of spells hidden beneath his cloak. “I like you,” he said, when he recovered. He didn’t seem to care, or even notice that their parents were running toward them yelling, swords aimed at his back. Dean tried to get to Sam, but with supernatural speed the Demon crouched and pulled the kid toward him by his shirt, bringing them nose to nose. “You’ve got
It just made Bobby more determined. “No one’s going to take her away from you. And you’ll stay because I say so. Listen to me, Dean,” he said, and waited until the boy met his gaze. “I didn’t say it’s all going to be sunshine. It’s going to be hard work, dawn to dusk. But there will be three squares a day, and a roof over your head every night. For you. For your brother.”
“Oh Baby, I missed you,” he mumbled, heedless of his tears wetting her coat. “I missed you so much. Did they hurt you?” He let her go so he could get a good look at her. The way she hopped and danced around him in her joy, giddy as a filly, was answer enough. She was healthy and gorgeous as always; in fact it looked like she’d recently been groomed.
But as the autumn progressed, and Dean’s thirty day deadline dwindled into a couple weeks, the infamous patience of Gadreel was finally out-stubborned by the black stallion.
The next day Gadreel ordered that the grooms and hands round up the head horses of all the little bands that had formed among the royal stock, to see what affect their alpha natures would have on Angel, if any. One by one they were led into the paddock, but not only did these horses not challenge Angel, they had no interest in him either. Mare and stallion alike would just mind their own business on the opposite side of the paddock, bored in the packed dirt without grass to graze on, and all the humans and horses on the other side of the fence. Angel himself was perfectly content being ignored and ignoring in turn. For the first time he let some exhaustion show; he was still alert, always tracking Gadreel who for the moment was on the outside of the paddock, but he didn’t move much elsewise. It made Dean worried for him. Horses needed to eat pretty much constantly, and spending all day in the paddock without food and little water was wearing him down. At night, when Angel stood in his stall under the thrall of the spell, Sam and Dean would groom him and fill his trough with sweet hay and hearty oats, and place a couple buckets of cool water. When they woke in the morning it would be all gone, but it was simply not enough for the stallion to stay healthy.
—The kingdom of Loki-Gabriel. The topography of this country suits his needs, as the Lokibergen cut off easy passage to the south and east and the ocean cuts off the north and west, not to mention the difficult to navigate fjords and harsh arctic tundra in the kingdom’s upper reaches.
In Bobby’s words Dean heard the echo of his mother’s voice, and he was surprised to find he had enough heart left for more of it to break. But just like twelve years ago, he didn’t let it slow him down. He saw the large black bulk of Angel over Bobby’s shoulder, ears and eyes twitching to take in the storm of people and horses all around. It was a miracle he hadn’t bolted, but Dean didn’t have time to wonder at it. He pushed past Bobby and tried to calm himself, for Angel’s sake. “Sorry, buddy, but you gotta let me,” he said, and jumped onto his back.
“Whatever,” she said. Jo turned and without a backward glance, ran under Impala’s belly without even having to duck her head. The darkness swallowed her up, and soon it was just her lantern bobbing away into the distance.
“You know I advertised the event with Commander here—Did this stall used to belong to another horse? We need to get a nameplate to cover up these scratches—as a chance to bond with a Great Horse. That’s what I told Gadreel, too. But the truth is,” he sighed, his face drooping into disappointment, “that Gadreel hasn’t been doing his job very well. Can you imagine? My own Royal Horsemaster, unable to break a horse?” He shook his head.
With space to work with, the brothers drew up on either side of the stallion, flanking him as they walked toward the hedge and its twisted little gate. With clear caution the horse lowered his head to sniff at the gate. No sooner had his sensitive nose lightly brushed it, than its thorny branches writhed into life. Even a horse’s swift instincts were no match for the preternatural speed of the plants, which shot out and wrapped around Angel’s neck. With startled cries Sam and Dean immediately went about hacking them with their knives, but as soon as they attacked, roots ripped through the soil at their feet and started winding up their legs. “Dean!” Sam shouted: his knife was making no headway. Dean reached for his sword, but a branch reached out from the hedge to snap around his wrists. Angel whinnied and pulled with all his strength, but in less than a minute they were all wrapped in plants, stiff and immobile from neck to foot. “S-Sam,” Dean tried. The word was practically squeezed out of him as the plants tightened more.
“Horse meat used to be a staple of the ancient Michaeretzer diet,” said Sam, having recovered from his laughter.
“I know, I know. But if you leave with me now, they aren’t going to touch you anymore today. You can go back to your stall, have a nice rest. I can get you water, some food. I’ll even find an apple for you, how does that sound?”
Still, Dean didn’t go to sleep that night. As soon as everyone else was stirring and getting ready for their day, he hopped out of the loft, checked on Angel, and did no chores. Instead he marched out of Horsetown, up the northern road, navigating Mt. Heaven and climbed through the city all the way to the castle.
The stallion huffed a breath, warm air against his palm, and then moved his nose to Dean’s right hand.
“Anyway, centuries passed. It wasn’t until the Border War that Lucifer must have felt powerful enough to attack Michaeretz in the open. He started in Winchester.”
Sam nodded. He tried to swallow around the lump in his throat. For years they’d played off Sam’s nightmares as a result of the war, just another boy wounded in the mind but what he’d experienced. They’d hid their worries, Dean because he was afraid they’d take Sam away, and Sam, Sam because he wasn’t sure he wanted to know.  He’d never told Dean all of it, either. Because he tried to protect his brother, too.
Pam swept it up and dragged her thumb across it, easily discerning its worth. “A little too much for a couple of beers, Dean,” she said.
Crowley sighed and picked up his tea, but didn’t drink. He tapped his finger on its golden edge, looking still at Angel, but also far away. “To the rest of the kingdom, I was Castiel’s tutor for the mundane sciences. But to those in the king’s circle, it was known that I also taught him the arcane sciences. The royals don’t like people to know that commoners are not only born with magic, but can become just as proficient as they in the craft.”
Dean runs his hand along her side and hums as he makes short work of her saddle. If he hadn’t been wearing half his armor that day, she would not have had to wear all the tack that normal men require when riding, but she understands. Her Dean wishes to be prepared, and so does she. And he always takes good care of her after. Castiel anticipated the thorough grooming  and has a tub full of water ready. She nickers softly in thanks as they each take up a cloth to wipe her down. Even more than the feeling of sweat and grime being lifted away she enjoys the kindness she feels in Castiel’s hands, and the ever-present tenderness in her Dean’s.
The irony of it all was that these stories are what saved Sam and Dean’s life in the two years they wandered the prairie. While they never resorted to killing or eating horses—Dean would die first—their mother’s tales of living off the land, even in the harsh of winter, were exactly the tools they’d needed to survive. Any time he’d been at a loss, Dean would remember something that Mary had said about her father, or one of her cousins, and he would do what he had to. It seemed, though, that Sam had forgotten the origin of that knowledge.
As her Dean now finishes with her tail, Castiel carefully combs through her forelock. Then, making sure Dean does not notice, he takes a kerchief from his pocket and gives her horn a quick polish. His magic has grown of late, and he has just recently begun to see it, in the dusk or dawn, out of the corner of his eye. He has not, however, rediscovered the horse that still lives inside of his soul and gone running with her across the plains. But soon, she is certain of it. She appreciates, too, that he mentions nothing to her Dean, and respects her secrets. Dean must come to understand the bond they share in his own time.
“But then,” he said, feinting a step closer. Cas backed him off by lowering his head and threatening to lunge. “But then when I told you of this plan you would not serve. You would not repent! I gave you every chance to make up for your wrongs but you remained prideful. It was clear that if you had the chance, you would again betray us all.”
Angel stuck his large head and neck through the window, his nose only about a foot away from Dean's shoulder. Rowena placed a rickety stool in front of the stallion and then - propping up the handle with a single finger - she lifted a bucket of water and set it on the seat. The horse gave the water a big sniff, eyeing the Witch all the while, before plunging his nose in and drinking his fill. Dean looked down at his own tea cup. The white on the inside of the porcelain made it easy to see the murkiness of the tea, the little bits of leaf and herb and who knew what else. It smelled...like tea. He drank water, or beer. Lady Tasha sometimes made tea, but usually for the knights. He supposed it didn't smell too dissimilar from that. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Sam take a sip, think a little, then sip some more. When he didn't immediately keel over, Dean took a sip as well. It was...weird flavored water. It was hot, at least, and a bone-deep chill that had lived with him the past few days, the night and the dew and the forest shadow, melted away.
Dean nodded, his throat too dry to speak properly. He slipped it into his pocket, slung his pack over his shoulder, and gave Sam a hug. “Be safe,” he said lowly, just for his ears.
“Have I been nattering on to myself? Haven’t you been listening?” Crowley snapped. “Because of her love for
“You’ve gotta eat something,” said Dean. “You need the energy. How else are you going to keep fighting these bastards, huh? You wanna let them win?”
He cried out, but no dragon with all the fire in the world could express such heartache. Castiel flapped his wings, writhing, and then his body began to shrink. His silver and black scales tinkled together as they squeezed in on him, and he diminished.
“And I always felt so unclean. But it’s okay. I just need to learn to control it.” He huffed a laugh. “Who knew it could be so simple?”
“Oh, right,” he said, yawning. “Semantics is the study of words and their meanings. She was saying that practically, a mage or whoever could eventually become powerful enough to seem godlike whether they were divine or not. I think she meant Chuck and Amara.”
“I, uh…” Dean rubbed the back of his neck and looked away awkwardly. “People like privacy when they sleep, and I know you haven’t had a lot of that as a horse, and I’m sorry Sammy and took a nap on you yesterday, and I hope it’s okay if I sleep outside too, but if it bothers you…” He glanced back up to gauge the prince’s reaction.
After about a minute Dean heard Sam's footsteps in the grass, catching up to Impala. "No one's home," he said. "Must have made a castle run." Every now and then Lady Tasha would make a trip up to the top of Mt. Heaven to meet with King Metatron and gather spells.
She turned a dazzling smile back on Sam but Dean interrupted before she could speak. “Bigger problems, Sam!”
Whether the horse understood the question or not, he stepped up to Sam and delicately caught his sleeve in his teeth, tugging him forward a bit.
Dean sighed and resigned himself to the reality of the situation, slinging an arm over the horse’s shoulders. His cheeks burned with embarrassment; he was flapping around like an
The older men shared a look, though Dean couldn’t guess the meaning. Metatron had been king of Michaeretz for half of his life, now, and for most of Sam’s. Neither of them had ever truly interacted with him, but they were grateful for the peace he’d brokered with Luciterra, ending the Border War, and they had also heard tell of his coming to the people and performing magery to heal citizens of Mt. Heaven during times of widespread illness. Many of the higher-ranking people in Horsetown, however, were longer-lived, having spent so much time around Reaper magic—they’d never be truly young and immortal, like a powerful mage could be—but Rufus and Bobby were about 80, though they looked middle-aged, and Benny, who was surrounded by the spells regularly put into a Reaper’s weapons and armor, was well over 100 years old though he didn’t look a day over 40.  Most of them were short of praise when it came to Metatron, though they never badmouthed him directly.
The floor, too, was stone, less like true masonry and more like a series of irregular rocks made smooth by a powerful river like the Voda, or perhaps the constant passage of feet. The walls were sod, and roots webbed across them, thin as veins and thick as branches. Shelves of various heights and widths were lined up all around the circular cellar with jars of ingredients, yes, but also books: more books than they’d ever seen in once place.
Cas snapped awake in an instant. He laughed and pulled Dean down on top of him, and they kissed, and kissed.
The word spread quickly around Horsetown that a black horse was on its way, so that despite the coming party’s pace people were pouring into the courtyard before their hooves were even heard. Sam appeared at Impala’s side and rested a hand on her neck. She spared a moment to give him a greeting nicker and a gentle nudge back with her nose, but then she was back to business.
After another minute of listening to the witches sniping at each other and muttering about spells and ingredients, Sam nudged him. “So, uh, get this,” he said.
Having found a moment, Sam and Dean were leaning against the fence watching Angel and Stella, an appaloosa mare. In her boredom she was systematically making her way around the fence, nosing for treats from the watchers—though carefully staying, Dean noticed, on her side of the paddock. The trainers pushed her away. Dean felt bad for her, and Sam did too, so they both greeted her and stroked her nose, and scratched behind her jawbone. She nickered happily.
“Stablemaster, if you would be so good as to have your best people groom this horse, quickly as they can,” said Gadreel, striding back to his own horse.
A loud crack erupted outside, causing the earth to rumble. They all looked to the other side of the hamlet in the small valley between the hills, and a great plume of flame blossomed to the sky, like a flower unfurling at high speed.
But the story of Castiel having turned into a dragon had spread widely, and with enough witnesses to back it up—and Cas’s penchant for growing wings to fly to different parts of the region—many people had also concluded that that was enough evidence for kinghood in and of itself.
He must have appeared right behind Impala, his arm still outstretched as if to grab her tail. Mom and Dad were both wrapped around him, trying to bring him down; Mom had lost her sword and was attempting a headlock; Dad was digging a knife between the ribs Impala had crushed. Even as Dean watched, the Demon flickered out with his parents and flashed closer again, just out of reach, and too close to the hamlet’s Hellfire: a single spark jumped and landed on Mom, whose clothing immediately went up in flame. She screamed but didn’t let go.
“Get the hell out of here!” he shouted. He was onto those drunkards like a charging bull, dragging away the one who’d almost nailed the little boy with his fist, and acquainted him with his own knuckles. The man went down like a sack of potatoes. At the same time the horse landed a kick on the one trying to mount it, and he screamed in agony. But the other three had ganged up on the older boy who, though he was scrapping like a viper, was losing and taking hard hits. One of the drunks just about had a handle on the sword and was trying to pull it from its sheath. Bobby went for him first, wrapping an arm around his neck and slamming his other hand down on his wrist, twisting it away from the weapon. Another man yelled in pain—Bobby saw a shape flit in his periphery, and figured little Sammy had gotten a stab in—but then the tavern door was bursting open again.
. “I got it from the ancient texts, the few that survive from before the Final War,” he said. “Rowena helped me translate them.”
“Your Majesty, it is you who I have wronged more than any other. I will accept whatever punishment you deem fit, even if it is to take my life.”
The steps into the cellar were steep, but made surprisingly of stone. The room was big enough to be underneath the entire garden, not just the cottage itself. It was lit by a series of lanterns glowing with a steady purple light, both hanging from the ceiling amidst drying herbs and in sconces on the walls. When he looked at one close up, he saw they were filled with luminescent flower blossoms.
In a sense, what their parents had done was one of the greatest deeds, sung or unsung, in all of Michaeretz. On the battlefield, so the reports came, it took entire companies of soldiers or at least three strong Reapers to take out a Berserker Demon. This one had been brought down by two commoners and a couple of well-placed hooves. But there had been nothing heroic about it. Dean had seen it. It had been as dirty, as ignoble a death as he could imagine. And what was their reward? An unmarked pile of dirt in an area people avoided out of a wish to forget.
A cup clattered back into its saucer, startling Dean into looking at Rowena. “You were there!” she said. “You told me you were framed after the fact but you were
In the blink of an eye the figure was standing in front of Sam. Its dark cloak whirled in an unnatural breeze before settling, bringing with it a wave of foul, fetid air that reeked of sulfur. Up close Dean could see, just barely in the moonlight, runes that were woven into the cloth, black on black. “What have we here?” it asked. Large hands reached out and grasped Sam around his chest, and lifted the boy high as if he weighed nothing. The figure’s hood fell back to reveal a man, short-haired and pale-skinned, a grin stretching his mouth wide. His eyes were bright yellow.
Dean, barely noticing that Angel had stopped too, stumbled to the ground and raced to them, his family, uncaring of the magic which touched him not, and the Reaper he still couldn’t see. Sam was already standing back up so Dean wasted no time in drawing his sword and bringing it down on the nearest tendril. It parted the smoky substance, which instantly reformed and tried again for Impala, his mare, his beloved Baby. Sam tried too, and Angel seemed to be stamping on them—why hadn’t the stallion spooked and run?—but there was no use. The tendrils snapped around Impala’s legs, one by one, and Impala stopped trying to get away. Her whole body heaved with quick breaths, and sweat foamed across her coat, but she nuzzled Sam. Nuzzled Dean, who placed a hand on either side of her massive head.
Crowley grunted and turned on his heel, heading back up the winding path into the cottage. Rowena stepped back and made a sweeping gesture, which caused the hedge gate to swing open. “In that case, won’t you come inside and have a cup of tea?”
. "Stories must be told well, to be worth the telling."  There was a large open oven in which a fire crackled merrily beneath a cast iron pan with small breads. She poked one with her finger. "The three of you had good timing. A minute later and the scones would have been burned. A wee bit earlier and I wouldn't have them in the oven at all. Some would say," she continued, plucking the
The breeze was gentle, rolling in across the prairie, grass stalks bending to its caress. It wicked the sweat off Dean's brow in no time as he rode out on Impala's back toward the eastern road. Sam loped along next to her, at 20 years old actually surpassing Impala at the withers by a few inches (and sadly, therefore, taller than Dean by a few inches as well). The square meals Bobby had promised and the many years of daily labor had given them both broad shoulders and muscles enough to get the job done, though all that horse grooming didn't leave much time for personal grooming, Dean lamented, eyeing Sam's long hair, which was pulled back by a leather cord.
“Who? Never mind.” Bobby shook his head. “I thought I told you boys to leave and not look back. Then Impala’s causing a ruckus and you’re here hollering to wake the dead when half this place thinks you’re a traitor.”
Impala got farther away this time, village left in her dust, but again the knot the three fighters were tangled in disappeared and jumped closer. Still too short. But now Dad had caught fire too, though the Demon did not. Yet they stabbed him, and kicked him, and once more disappeared.
The king chuckled. “Of course, I should have expected your sense of fairness, another fine quality, to make you hesitate. Very well. Who among you knights would sponsor Dean Winchester?”
“We’re getting there,” Dean would say, or “I think he’s really coming around,” or “There’s two feet of snow out there, what do you want me to do about it?”
Delicately—Impala was a strong girl, but he was hardly going to drop down on her like a sack of potatoes—Dean lowered himself back into a sitting position, with legs folded and facing where Sam lay off to the side. At this point, twelve years down the line, they didn’t often discuss the dreams that had lingered with Sam ever since their parents’ deaths. It was a worry now so old they bore the burden with a practical resignation. Dean braced himself. “The Yellow-Eyed Demon, again?”
Bobby raised his eyebrows in mild surprise. It had been so long since King Metatron had put out the call for black stallions that very few people bothered to call for it anymore. But as it had never been officially rescinded, those 10,000 crowns were still up for grabs. Bobby sighed and shook his head. “One of you send for Horsemaster Gadreel!” he hollered in the general direction of the kids. Half of them jumped into action, racing each other to the pigeon coops were they could send a quick summons to the royal stables on the butte. The Royal Horsemaster was the only one, besides the king of course, who could make a decision on the bounty. Not that the king had ever bothered showing up before.
“Sorry, sorry,” he said, scrabbling against him to steady himself, only to grab back on when the cottage lurched the other direction.
His eyelids fluttered. The ceiling his eyes were met with was white, with soft gold curls in abstract patterns. He lowered his eyes, blinked to adjust them, to see what was touching him.
“What if they take her away from me? Or they say they’ll let us stay, but then they won’t?” Bobby could see the longing in Dean’s eyes, like he wanted to believe it was that easy, but just couldn’t.
“Well Chuck’s offspring were the best of them. The Archangels, they were called. They’re old enough to make me look like a spring chicken even now, and they have the centuries of studying magic to match. Michael, Lucifer, Raphael, Gabriel. The greatest warriors of the land: fierce, absolute. The smart Witches hid. The foolish ones perished.” She looked away, clearly counting herself among the latter group, despite her survival. “But when it was finished, Chuck couldn’t bear to strip his sons and daughter of their power, too. Bloody hypocrite.”
Dean’s stomach growled so loud they all heard it. He ducked his head, a blush flushing his freckled cheeks, but Ellen just smiled. “Pull up a barrel, Bobby, and help me hand out the dishes.” Sure enough, the rest of her basket was filled with bowls, spoons, cups, and a single stoppered jug. She filled the bowls with the stew one at a time, which Bobby handed to the kids each in their turn. Sam and Jo were tiny enough to share a barrel, elbowing each other as they wolfed down their dinner. For the first few bites Dean seemed to be trying to control himself, but eventually gave in, stuffing his mouth with hunks of bread between spoonfuls. Ellen and Bobby ate with more manners, but neither of them were dainty so they weren’t setting much of an example, anyway. Ellen didn’t admonish Jo, even when she laughed so hard she spilled some stew on her dress.
“Hi, Angel,” he said. “Hey, buddy.” He scooted closer, but Angel surged half onto his feet, muscles trembling, before collapsing back into the straw, just to snap at him again. “Okay, okay.” He sat back on his haunches. Sam’s footsteps were rapidly approaching again. “When’s the last time you ate? You must be hungry.” The straw behind him crunched. “Easy, Sammy,” he murmured. Because he was the best brother in the world, he set down and entire bag of apples next to him, and then slowly back away and settled into the opposite corner from where Angel was sitting, unfolding clean linen bandages.
“Stop!” Sam hissed, making chase, but Dean wasn’t going to let anyone stop him this time. They were going to take his Baby, they were going to do to her what they did to Angel, but Dean wouldn’t let them. He wouldn’t let them!
When he could walk and stand again without much pain, they led him out into the cool autumn air, and put him in a pasture with other horses. Some of them were old and in retirement; others were mothers with their foals, who gamboled about and ran between the other horses’ legs. All of them ignored Castiel, even as he was put there day after day. So he respected them, and ignored them in turn.
That was the last thing he wanted to do, but until he got a signal from the others, Dean had no choice but to play along. He dismounted, and holding the reins in his hand, he led Castiel closer to the dais. Metatron smirked and descended the small set of stairs. “Bring the stool, Gadreel.”
to 10,000 pounds, at the discretion of the royal house,” responded Gadreel. “And I assure you that no one has yet received the full amount.”
“I was already your tutor at the time,” Crowley said. “I was there when she commissioned the portraits. As for that coin,” he added, nodding at it, “Michael commissioned those, but mostly, I think because it’s such a great display of power. But maybe not.” He shrugged. “Whatever the reason, though it wasn’t as flashy, Hannah was the more powerful mage, in the end. Michael may have commanded the storms, but Hannah served the people and was a true queen.”
Those who had witnessed the arrival of the stallion earlier that day looked at each other uneasily, then looked to Gadreel. He was standing stiffly as ever, face harder than stone, giving no indication of his thoughts.
All traces of glee dropped from Metatron’s face. “And to whom,” he asked with forced steadiness, “have you been talking?”
Dean rolled his eyes and used the jam first, since that was the knife he was holding. “What’s the difference between ‘abnormally’ lucky, and fate?” After slapping a healthy dollop on, he switched knives with Sam, and dug into the clotted cream.
—The continent on this world that was under the rule of either The Great Sorcerer Charles (Chuck) or his sister The Great Sorceress Amara at various times throughout history. For millennia the land belonged in whole or in part to both or either of them. Eventually the Final War between them decimated the land and peoples so completely that a new beginning was inevitable. The continent was split into four kingdoms to give to Chuck’s direct descendants, as Amara had none. In honor of the greatest sorcerers the world has ever known, the kings and queen jointly dubbed their continent Chamara.
“He picked me up, and I kicked him. But he just laughed and then he got out this powder, a yellow powder, and blew it in my face. It reeked of rotten eggs. And then I couldn’t move.” He looked at Rowena, eyes watering, begging her to understand. “He started choking Dean and I would do anything for my brother,
“You damn idjit,” Bobby said, putting a hand on the side of Dean’s face, searching it. Then his own face crumpled, and he pulled Dean into a hug. “You’re okay.”
The brothers relaxed and let themselves be entertained, watching in amusement as Castiel patiently nudged the witches apart when their disagreements got heated. A bee buzzed around overhead before tucking itself into a nearby flower.
That couldn’t be right. The tree was dripping with white flowers and their perfume filled the air. No way could there be fruit. But sure enough, when he bothered to look up, ripe red apples dotted the boughs. Crowley sauntered over and plucked one from its stem, ruby in color and entirely unblemished. He held it out to Castiel. “To make up for the tea,” he said.
Rowena sniffed disdainfully at his scone, but deigned to answer. “Fate implies that everything that will be is written as permanently as everything that has been. This negates free will. Are you believers in fate?” she asked, taking another bite.
“What did I lie about, Your Highness?” He was one of the few people who called him by that title these days, and it made those broad shoulders twitch. But Crowley figured the boy needed to get used to honorifics again. “You’ll have to narrow it down.”
They passed from there to the hallway, the timbre of Castiel’s hoofbeats changing as he stepped onto the elegant runner. This time Dean ignored the spindly-legged tables with their large vases, the mirrors in their ornate frames, the paintings of people long dead. All but one: when they finally reached the antechamber for the throne room, and the attendant held up her hand to bid them wait, both he and Castiel looked at the painting of Michael in battle. Castiel stamped, the only sign of nervousness he’d shown thus far. Dean leaned over to whisper in his ear, “I have faith in you.”
He knelt there a few moments longer, trying to keep himself from flying apart with all that had happened during the night. They weren’t out of the woods yet. After their years of wandering Impala surely knew the country’s terrain better than Sam and Dean did, and had, by memory or instinct, avoided any town or village on the journey. But before much longer they would need water, lots of water for both man and horse, and food if they were able to find it. As if she shared his thought, Impala nudged his back with her muzzle. Dean took one last deep breath and stood to face, allowing himself to nuzzle her soft, sensitive nose like he had as a boy. “Whaddaya say, Baby, can you carry both of us, like you used to?”
“How am I supposed to do it?” Castiel asked at length. “How am I supposed to live up to her legacy?”
People were no better. Most tried to catch him—some tried harder than others—but by the skin of his teeth he escaped their lassos, both the ropes and the magic variety, long blue white tendrils: a Reaper spell.
They could hear Sam and Jo making their way back, the latter chattering on to her new friend about the garden. Dean stepped back and wiped his face with his sleeve again, smearing everything around a little more.
His throat stuck, Dean slid ungracefully from Impala’s back, almost kicking Sam in the process. He stumbled to the edge and knelt, hands landing right in the dirt. It felt like normal dirt, but how could that be?
The Greenwood Forest had come by its name honestly. Now that the sun was high over head, beams of light came cascading down through the branches, dappling all beneath the canopy. This far south, spring was in full swing, and the leaves were thick and green as emeralds. Moss crawled up trunks, bushes and flowers scattered around the grand columns. Birds called to each other and pecked for food, knocking hard against wood. Rodents hopped across their path and skittered up and down trees; a large spider slid down on its silk over their heads. Dean smacked it away.
. “You’ll forgive me if I don’t bow, Your Highness,” she continued, presumably to the horse. “I may not be as old as your father was, but I was certainly around long before this continent was split into kingdoms, when the Coilluaine was more than this pitiful strip of land and the forest stretched halfway across the prairie.” She heaved a dramatic sigh.
Bobby had downed the whiskey left in his glass. “And what about the other stolen kids?” he’d mumbled.
They tried it again with a large draft horse, a paint with large feathers that cascaded almost the entire length of his legs, but Angel showed a surprising amount of strength against him, and eventually the draft gave up and would not move forward either.
When she was certain they weren’t going to have another go, she turned the full of her attention on the strange boys. The younger one was clutching the other boy’s hand again, whose nose and mouth were both dripping blood. “Don’t you boys know it’s asking for trouble leaving a black horse out in the open like this?”
“No.” Rowena squeezed his arm. “No. There is nothing of his tainted magic in your aura. You’re projecting your awareness, nothing more. With the proper training you’ll be able to control it, and all that excess energy won’t take over your dreams.”
The pain of it, the energy the magic had ripped from his body was finally too much. Castiel collapsed onto Dean, weeping. The tears soaked into his shirt and mixed with the blood. He wept and wept, and so did not notice that before he finally fell into blissful unconsciousness, a breath stuttered in the chest beneath him.
Impala rejoices in the happiness of Castiel and her Dean, but it truly has been a long day and now that she is just outside the warmth of the stables and its abundance of food, she doesn’t have the patience for the way they sometimes stare. She nudges Dean’s shoulder.
“That should do it,” said Rowena. She juggled several glass jars in her arms, and had a few cinched bags dangling from her elbows. “If you strapping young lads could get the books?”
The result of it was that bumbling idjits up and down the land were stalking bands of mustangs without knowing a damn thing about horses, and getting injured, even killed for their troubles. The crueler - and ever so slightly smarter - of them were wandering the towns and hamlets like marauders looking to steal horses from those unable to defend themselves. It was an unnecessary new scourge to burden the country, which only recently felt settled again after the war. Bobby could grudgingly admit he was grateful that Metatron had been able to negotiate an armistice after King Michael’s death, and Lucifer’s grievous injury. But if Bobby knew about all the crime being committed within their own borders in the current king’s name, then there was no way Metatron didn’t. So why did he let it continue? The king did act
He’d never seen a room so big that had no particular function—unless this room’s function was to intimidate, in which case it succeeded. The floor was marble in various shades of white, pink, and green, inlaid with intricate geometrical designs. The walls were draped with tapestries bigger than half the training paddocks in Horsetown, depicting battles of gods and man, Angels and monsters. The entire ceiling was painted in frescoes, the gods wheeling in the heavens with the stars in both human and animal form. He wondered how they even managed to get all the way
Dean looked back and forth between Crowley and Angel. “What, you can understand him?” He crammed the second half of his scone into his mouth all at once.
Each morning began before dawn, every one a little cooler than the day before, until the sun rose and hard work warmed them up. Between feeding and mucking and grooming, Sam and Dean ran around and performed the odd jobs they were getting roped into left and right and, when they had time and Impala was willing, practiced their trick riding in anticipation of extra coin. Most everyone was in a good mood, the excitement of the upcoming festival infectious.
as long as he got what he wanted in the end. Well, Dean had never stood for that, and he never would. Even if it killed him.
, as if he were a great warrior instead of a scared horse. But still, he could not trust them. They did not stop the abuse, and they worked for Gadreel, after all.
“That’s wonderful news,” Cas smiled. “Maybe you could come with me on my next trip. I mean, if you would like.”
Powerful wings cut through the air, and Castiel had barely landed on two feet before he was stumbling onto his knees, reaching for his friend. His shirt was completely soaked in blood, his hands were covered in it, and his chest was unmoving. His lips were a bluish purple, his eyes half-hooded and glassy. No more smiles, no more jokes. No more doting on Impala or looking out for Sam. No more strong hands with sure, gentle touches. No one to respond if someone were to call for him.
To his horror Sam felt himself blushing again, but he tried to ignore it. Teasing aside, her offer seemed genuine enough, so he followed her to the back door. To his surprise, however, it didn’t lead out the other side of the cottage at all, but into another room. Two of the walls were mostly windows, the stained glass in intricate vine patterns amid a clear background, speckling the floor and furniture with green. The solid wall near what Sam assumed was the real back door was covered in mundane gardening tools, and some not so mundane. In the corner a steep wooden staircase led to an unexpected second floor. The cottage was clearly much bigger than it had looked on the outside, though still much smaller than, say, the Roadhouse Tavern. Nevertheless Sam was beginning to see how little he truly understood of the world.
“Oh Dean, I can’t. It was a gift.” Dean could see how it killed Cas to say it. Even now he was tracing his thumb over the double profile, back and forth.
Bobby lifted his cap, ran a hand through his hair, and plopped it back on. “Shit. I’ll go find him.”
When he reached with his sword again, it was no feint. But Castiel anticipated him, ramming forward head down. Dean’s heart caught in his throat, but the sword glanced of the chest plate with a resounding clang, and Gadreel was tossed to the side. He rolled with it and stood back up, advancing again. “And you did. You duped this innocent man into trusting you, and you led him straight to Crowley so he could poison him as well.” He raised his sword for another attack.
. My parents told Dean to leave with me and they stayed behind to give us a chance. I couldn’t turn my head, I didn’t see them die like Dean did, but I could see the people burning in the village. And I could hear Dean crying.” He dropped his head into his hands. He would never forget the sound of Dean’s anguish, as long as he lived.
When he was satisfied, the thoughts came pouring back in. Orphaned. Alone. No allies back home, he couldn’t count on it. What if Lucifer had succeeded and taken over Mt. Heaven? No, his whole country was barred to him, and the south far too dangerous. He wouldn’t get far if he went west; even if he could make his way through the high peaks of the Micharim, Lokiland was closed to outsiders. The only option was east. His aunt, the Queen Raphael, would harbor him.
Dean gave him a jovial fake smile, which Crowley returned with a cool upturning of the lips. "Dean. A pleasure. Now your accents tell me you're not too far from home, but you've got a bit of Mt. Heaven in your vowels. So what were a couple of bumpkins like you doing in the cultural capital of Chamara long enough to acquire a bit of class?"
The clearing was surprisingly large for such dense forest, though the canopy high above still curled inward, further enclosing the space. Maybe it was from being so long in the dark, but the sunlight that shone in it looked golden to Dean, honeyed, embracing the little cottage in the middle with warmth. Its thatched roof and stone walls were overrun with vines, thick as branches, but for all that it was inhabited: smoke puffed up from the single chimney, and the myriad and varied plants and flowers carpeting the open land was in an order of sorts. The garden was surrounded by a natural fence of gnarled hedges and, in case their thorns weren’t enough, a sign with a terse
Castiel’s smile widened, then he ducked his head. Dean noticed for the first time that there was a large window in the side of the room with the panes thrown wide open. Sunlight streamed in, catching the silver circlet in Cas’s dark hair, and pulling a streak of rainbow from the perfectly round diamond in its middle and spilling it onto the white bedsheets. The jewel sat on the prince’s forehead exactly where his star had been as a horse. It was one thing to understand in the abstract, but this was Angel. And he was royalty.
Could it be true? Could he be a warrior killed in the Border War, and returned to a new life in reward? Was Angel a Great Horse?
Then again, he was a king. He’s probably entitled. Not like Michael never expected the same from his people, may the gods rest his soul.
Crowley recognized the double crown. “When you get to be my age,” he told the prince, “you will find yourself in constant battle against people with short memories.”
“Long ago,” he continued without sparing Bobby another glance, “even before the rise in power of Charles and Amara, the greatest mages the world has ever known (and my close kin), humans and horses lived in harmony. Horses saw that man was good, and agreed to serve him. Great deeds were performed on horseback, great feats of agriculture and architecture, of speed and distance. But no bond was greater than that between a warrior and his trusty steed.” There the king paused, looking down with a soft smile, as if overcome by the very thought. “We humans are given but one life on this earth, and though some live longer than others” - he let out a small, self-deprecating laugh, eliciting another round of good-natured giggles from the crowd - “some warriors felt that their service, that their sacrifice was not enough. So great was the valor of these ancient warriors that the gods looked down in awe, and decided to grant us a gift.”
It looked the same, and yet different from when he’d been there last fall. It was still just as grand with its high vaulted ceilings and colorful frescoes, its expensive marble floor, but now that Dean knew Metatron for what he really was, and what wielding the power of a king really meant, it had lost its intimidating veneer.
The man made a big show of ignoring Dean and turning to Angel. “Got some friends, did you, princeling? I understand you were desperate but they’re not very bright. It’s a good thing they’re pretty.”
The window of Bobby’s little room on top of the tavern looked to the north. He opened it to breathe in some fresh air, and felt the cool bite of early autumn. The sun hadn’t quite hit the horizon yet, but the sky was brightening into a lighter blue. The barn was just starting to cast a shadow, a little ways away, and the cocks were crowing from the coop. The Reka River, not far beyond the garden, could just be heard over the early morning birdsong. Bobby only let himself enjoy it for a minute longer, though. He hurried through his morning ablutions, got dressed, and hustled down the stairs. Usually he wasn’t opposed to having a bit of breakfast before going out to see to the horses, but today he was eager to go out to the barn.
The small figure clad in her black Reaper’s cloak, however, did not rush to aid the king. “Once and for all, Your Majesty, I’d like to hear the real story.”
. Impala had always been patient with them, and even now it didn’t disturb her grazing one bit to have Dean flip from his hands onto his feet, pirouetting on one set of toes and then arching backward back onto his hands. During festivals, when Michaeretzers far and wide descended upon Horsetown, the Winchesters and a few other denizens of the stables would take over a paddock of their own, and do trick riding for extra coin. The fact that Impala was so big and intimidating made people that much more impressed by what Sam and Dean could do, though they both knew it was just as much up to the mare, and she hadn’t once dropped them yet.
“Don’t push it away. You’ll need his love to see you through, and the love of your friends. Using those wings isn’t enough to see you through it, little bird. You will have your own reckoning as a child of two worlds. And so will Dean.”
Lady Tessa smiled, and it was full of the promise of comfort and safety, as it so often was. The brothers relaxed at the sight of it. “No, we will observe only. We come at the summons of the king. He convinced us that this would be a festival to remember.”
“I’m not asking you to sell her, boy,” said Bobby, exasperated. “ I can see you love her, plain as day. I’m asking you to come with her.”
His stupid little brother walked right past Angel and stood a hair’s breadth away from the dangerous gate. “My name’s Sam.”
Footmen leapt from the backs of the carriages and opened the doors, handing down nobles in silks and velvets, all the bright and expensive dyes no one in Horsetown could afford. Dean couldn’t help but stare at the necklaces glimmering on their chests, the elaborate hairstyles, and the colorful paint the lords and ladies wore on lips and eyes. He was even stuck with a bit of longing, thinking of all the balls and fetes held in the royal castle and in the grand homes of various estates, and now understood why the poets would sing about it with such lovely, flowery words. It was no wonder, if every surface was as gilded as their carriages and every turn of a dance had rainbows flashing across the room.
Warily he followed the carpet to the throne. Once he entered the room properly he saw great marble columns lining either side, between which there stood more statues, but these much, much bigger than life. As he drew closer to the throne he realized there was something behind it; what he thought was plain drapery was actually a white sheet covering half an enormous statue of a winged Michael. Scaffolding was built around the other half. When he reached the dais, he was still looking up.
“You know,” Rowena said, “it’s very likely that one or both of them had inherent magic, given your own sensitivity. It would have helped them last a little longer against magical attack.”
Only when they were completely at the mercy of the magic hedge did the cottage door slam open. A woman in a form-fitting green dress and fiery hair marched down the overgrown stone path. As she got closer it was obvious her clothes were of fine quality, and she even had her face painted like a noble. When she halted, separated from them only by the morass of thorns and roots, she smiled at them with blood red lips. It was not kind. “Now then,” she said, “who in the
A few more stunners got close, but no horse could match Impala for speed, not even her children. Angel must have been made of similar stuff, because every time she put on an extra burst of speed the stallion matched it. Coupled with their black coats, dark against the velvet of night, their pursuers were soon left behind.
His brother laid down, using his small pack for a pillow. Dean sat a little ways up one of the hills, low enough that he still had some cover, though high enough he had some line of sight. Impala and Angel were both grazing not too far off, refueling after a grueling night and day’s trek. The last of the light faded to the west, even as he watched; there was naught but the moon and stars to shine a meager light upon the landscape. Even then, some clouds rolled in, casting extra shadows upon the grass, the horses, Sam’s face. Dean watched them pass in and out, listened to the horses tearing and grinding down the grass, the insects buzzing and snapping. The breeze was gentle but it grew steadily colder, the last vestiges of winter chill making themselves known while the sun slept.
The most experienced squires and grooms were trying to help calm all the horses down, but for the stallion it was easier said than done. The desperation with which he tried to break free, the terror in the rolling whites of his eyes, made Dean’s heart ache. His squeals and whinnies were so loud they hurt the ears, and horses currently in their stalls were starting to answer. If they didn’t contain this now, every horse within a mile was going to spook.
know. We know that whether or not Metatron is a good king, he’s a bad person. He abused animals and he tried to kill us when we’ve done nothing wrong. And who was the only witness to the prince’s supposed kidnapping?”
Bobby and Tasha said nothing until the horsemaster’s footsteps faded away. “What kind of long-term effects we talkin’?” Bobby asked.
For more than a decade, he’d been longing to hear those words. When it felt like there’d been no end to his grief, the loss of his parents a constant pain at the core of him, all he’d wanted was for someone to say that it was over. When he was stumbling across the country, scared and alone, his own body taken from him, he’d wanted it to be over. When he’d been caught and locked in a stall, when people tried to ride him hours without end, when Gadreel whipped him and whipped him, he’d just wanted it all to be over. Over used to mean that it would turn out to have been a bad dream, and he’d wake up to his mother’s embrace. It used to mean that he’d know his own body again, that he could live an honest life among other people. More recently, over used to mean that when Dean spoke to him, he could speak back. That he could hold him in his arms and at least say his name. Castiel had imagined it so many times, how Dean would smile to hear it, and know him, recognize him as his friend. And now that it was all he wanted, he couldn’t have it. Castiel’s dragon body was so large it took up half the chamber, and still it could not contain his agony. What torment it was to have lost the only man he ever loved, and for that man to never know how truly cherished he was!
Like lightning Cas lowered his head, snapping his sharp teeth mere feet away from Metatron. Smoke curled from his nostrils.
“But you served me, Dean. When I was thirsty, you gave me water. When I was hungry, you fed me. When I was hurt, you tended my wounds.” He turned the smile onto his hands, open and empty in his lap. “I would do all that you have done for me and more.”
The king’s head turned. Dean gritted his teeth, clutching his hand to his chest, but Metatron just rubbed his jaw and worked his mouth a little. Then he gave him a false hangdog look. “Is that all you’ve got?”
Dean elbowed Sam again, and this time he let go. So Dean started running again; the other horses had a left a trail that anyone could follow, that Dean could follow even with the spots blinking in his eyes, aftershocks of magic light.
“Show off,” she muttered, but when Dean winked she snorted and smiled back. “Sit your ass down and tell me all the news.”
Somewhat dumbfounded, Bobby let the other animals out to pasture himself, opening their stall doors and letting them wander out of the barn and beyond the open fence. He ambled after them, going around the outside of the barn to the back gate. There he finally found Dean and Impala, standing close to the bank of the Reka. The early sunlight caused her newly washed coat to shine, making her look more magnificent than she had last night. Dean, barely as tall as one of her legs, was keeping up a steady stream of chatter as he brushed her shoulder. “Gonna get you looking pretty again, Baby,” he thought he heard. As soon as Bobby started walking closer, Impala swung her head to look at him, and gave a little blow of her lips.
Metatron completed his circuit and again stood next to Gadreel, still gazing at the horse. “You were right, Gadreel.”
Again, he ambushed Dean outside of Castiel’s stall, when he was alone without even Impala to defend him.
That same code, so concerned with appearance as well as strength, also prevented the best riders from learning the tricks Sam and Dean had picked up, even from
Dean couldn’t hold back his incredulous laughter at that. Mustangs were strong and hardy, but were definitely a lot smaller than this stallion. Sam braced his shoulders and crossed his arms; many others weren’t being too subtle about what they thought of this, either, the word ‘liar’ prevalent in the muttering, and Rufus’s not so quiet, “Boy, you must think we’re some kind of stupid.”
The stallion stilled, and they all waited for her answer. “Unlikely,” Rowena answered. Sam, Dean, and Cas let out a collective breath. “He’s not really a horse, remember. Nature always finds a way to restore balance, no matter how impossible it seems.”
“I know, it’s just…You already had to let me ride you and that must have been bad enough. But having to wear a saddle and all the gear and having people see you that way…It’s one thing for a horse, but for a prince?”
“’Kay,” he answered, and refocused on Rowena. He pointed something out in the book. “What language is that word?”
The Reaper turned her gaze on him, entirely without fear. “Don’t you think that’s a fair trade? His life for the truth?”
Even though that’s exactly the eventuality everyone had been preparing for, the piazza burst into an even bigger flurry of movement. Squires and pages made their loose lines tight and even, dirty stable kids scattered, and everyone else was running to and fro putting in that one last touch. Sam and Dean stood in the center of it all, the still horse the eye of a frantic storm.
Apart from the chimney smoke and the dust motes that drifted lazily about, the whole image was so strange and still in its little honeyed bubble of light that it reminded Dean of the rare snow globes that were imported from Lokiland at a dear price. Eternal and untouchable.
They gave him incredulous looks, but sent a runner to verify. After almost twenty minutes of fidgeting under their watchful eye, the gate was opened to him. An attendant in white and yellow livery beckoned him forward. “Follow me.”
Cautiously he touched his heels to Impala’s flanks to see if she’d be willing to get closer. To his surprise, she immediately responded, walking past those tugging on the ropes and arched her neck to her full height, in a clear challenge to the stallion. His response was almost comical; when he arched his neck in response and half rose off his forelegs in his own challenge, he seemed to come to himself and drop back down, stymied by the unmoving, solid wall of Impala. This close and still the black stallions eyes proved to be a bright blue. That was also highly unusual; black horses almost always had dark eyes, and even lighter horses usually had a pale blue, nothing so rich. Dean wondered if Salinger and his cronies might get their crowns after all.
“Reminds me of someone,” said Bobby. Sam and Dean whipped around to see the Royal Stablemaster in his official yellow and white tunic, hat gone and hair slicked back. Rufus came up behind him in similar attire, tugging uncomfortably at his color. Bobby threw a thumb over his shoulder. “Smartass siblings wreaking havoc and planning trouble?”
He turned, finally. “About what happened when Metatron attacked us in your study. You implied to your mother and the Winchesters that the only reason I wasn’t killed by the onslaught of magery and witchcraft was because of my shields. You didn’t tell them that it was because you took the worst of the spells onto yourself, the ones for pain and torment.”
Signs of human life should have been a welcoming sight, despite the sign’s warning, but the longer they looked, the stranger it seemed. There were recognizable herbs and flowers aplenty in the garden, but others defied all expectation in color, size, and form, while pumpkins and squashes were growing out of season and toadstools, bright red and poisonous, were allowed to flourish. The cottage’s windows had real panes of glass despite sitting so far away from civilization, some of them multicolored as only the nobles and temples of Mt. Heaven could afford, and arcane magical symbols were carved into wood and stone. And upon closer inspection the thorny, skeletal bushes that protected the property were dotted with the actual skeletons of small birds and rodents.
The kid mistook his amusement and blushed, looking away. “It’s been a while,” he muttered, wrapping an arm around one of Impala’s forelegs.
There was a man standing in the cottage doorway dressed, if not quite nobly, then as well as the upper merchant class in dark, expensive cloth. He had short brown hair and beard, and with hands deep in his pockets, he sauntered down the path to join them. “And very much alive,” he added. “Hello, Castiel.”
When he was not dismissed, Crowley entered the room and joined Castiel at a respectful distance. They looked together at the portraits.
After the requisite fluttering of hands and patting down to make sure he was in one piece, and fluffing up and stacking pillows so that Dean could sit up a little, Impala stepped forward and nosed him gently. “Hey, Baby.”
“Sounds like Azazel,” she said. “He often targeted children. It may please you to know that he died in battle, early on in the war.”
“Dean!” Sam gasped, and Dean knew he was locked in his own struggle. He saw the movement only in his periphery, heard the thumps as they tussled with their attackers, straw kicked out of the way straight to the wood.
Angel stumbled away from the bank, found a likely spot between two trees, and groaned as he laid down. Sam half-crawled toward him, and then curled himself between the horse’s legs, resting his head on the stallion’s belly. It was a stupid, stupid thing to do around any horse, but as children wandering the prairie on cold nights, Sam and Dean had tucked themselves against Impala, who had tolerated them. Why Sam would think to risk it on a horse as unpredictable as Angel, Dean didn’t know; whether his little brother wasn’t thinking straight from fatigue, or was going crazy, or was only thinking of the horse they’d just lost. Whatever the reason, Dean didn’t stop him, and neither did Angel. He merely looked down at Sam with tired eyes, and then lowered his own head to the ground in turn.
His eyes widened in shock and his mouth twisted in horror. “What have I done?” he pleaded. “The last thing I would ever wish you is harm. Tell me what I have done so that I may fix it.”
“Thank you for entrusting me with our country,” he began. More applause. “I know that my father’s rule was built on lies, and a lack of concern for the everyday lives of our people. Today I wish to take this sign of faith you have given me, and demonstrate how I intend to wield this great burden.
Dean pulls him in by the shoulders and rests their foreheads together. “That’s a hell of a gamble, Cas.”
Then there was no thought at all. He took his rage and his pain and poured it into his limbs, lashing out at the assassin with all his strength and speed. She was agile and very quick, darting in and out of his space to land her blows, but he had become a force of nature, and more, those late nights and early mornings of training gave him an endurance not needed for slashing sleeping throats; the dark-clad woman began to show weakness and could not block all his attacks. She grew nervous, no longer carrying herself with surety; she was no longer on the job. She was fighting for her life.
The day when Gadreel used the whip, he had said such strange things, about how Castiel needed to repent, and purge the poison from his veins. The last thought he had before the pain was too great was that Gadreel knew who he was. Metatron must have told him, which meant he would never stop, and Castiel would never, ever be allowed to escape.
Metatron preceded them into the castle, purple cloak swishing as he climbed the steps. They had barely followed him inside into the Great Hall when he split off to the side toward a small door hidden behind a column. “Somebody bring me Gadreel,” he commanded before disappearing.
“Why don’t you run along back to your mom and tell her the boys are staying here,” said Bobby. “I’ll help them with the feed.”
“You couldn’t move, because of the Demon’s spell,” Dean began. Sam had never been able to remember anything after seeing the Demon’s face, looking into his yellow eyes, and inhaling the magic powder. One of the few things Dean ever thanked the gods for. “But some of you must have still been in there, because damned if you’d let go of Mom’s bow. I got you onto Impala but she didn’t go far, and…” He took a moment for a few shaky breaths. It felt so much more real, more visceral today than it had in a long time. “And they told me to go.” His voice broke, but he didn’t allow more than a couple tears to fall. Angel came up around the other side of the patch, and eyed them in concern. Horses never did like when humans got upset. “Impala galloped like the wind, but the Demon still chased after us, using magic to get closer. Mom and Dad hung on, fighting him. And they got him, Sammy. For us.” That they died in the endeavor never needed to be spoken.
them, had used the power she wielded for the benefit of all her subjects. They whispered prayers in her honor and those who were able, followed.
But even Dean, in his quiet corner of the castle, could tell that it was likely Castiel would become king regardless. He was more, now, than just the beloved young prince which Mt. Heaven doted on. He was more, too, than the increasingly ludicrous stories that had sprung up about his powers and his shapeshifting ability (though his most truly impressive feat, bringing Dean back to life, had thankfully not spread beyond their small circle). Castiel was now also his mother’s son, going wherever he felt he was needed most. This was throughout the capital, yes, but also to the towns and villages across the country where Metatron had admitted to sending storms or sickness.
“Regardless” - the crowd startled - “I have taken this as a sign. Whether this fine animal is a Great Horse or not, I trust in the expertise of my Royal Horsemaster. If he feels that this horse is meant for me, and that I am meant to ride this horse, who am I to argue? I accept this generous gift, Gadreel,” the king said graciously. “Of both your faith in my leadership, and of this beautiful creature.”
A prince for a horse and a mage for a little brother. Why not? “Nah,” he sighed. “Just no killing rabbits for parts, okay Sammy?”
Bobby’s deep bellow reached them even in the loft, above the cacophony of horses, and Dean saw the whites of the assassin’s eyes within her mask. Her professional instinct was to disappear at the threat of discovery, but she couldn’t disengage from such a frantic fight. Dean’s fist was moving toward her temple as if drawn there, taking advantage of that single moment of distraction: it connected. The blow stunned her for just long enough for him to punch her again, and again.
“Dean Winchester,” Metatron said with false warmth, loud enough for all the spectators to hear. “Welcome!”
Castiel affects an innocent look. “Who, me? I’m just the new hire.” Both Impala and Dean snort. Castiel’s expression melts into fondness. “I sent Claire and all the hands to get their dinner.
On the eastern edge of the little village that had grown up around the stables sat Bane Cottage; whether the name came from the family that lived there or the family had taken on its name was now unclear. Lady Tasha lived there, Chief Assistant to the Royal Mages, and her twin children Max and Alicia (their father had been among the casualties of the Border War). Though not a Reaper herself, Lady Tasha acted as the liaison between the Reapers and the King, now one of the only mages left in the court, and by far the most powerful. She would take the spells given to her by the king, and prepare them for the Reapers to use, powders and potions and pouches: a bane to all the enemies of the kingdom. The cottage itself was slightly warped, one of the few left in the area made with sod as well as wood and stone, and a roof humbly thatched. Arcane magical symbols adorned the doors, and on the inside dried herbs hung among the empty vials of the trade. Often while working in the pastures one could see a pinkish-purple smoke puffing from the little chimney, but this morning not even a wisp curled skyward.
—The fabled, possibly mythical capital of Lokiland. The truth of it has passed out of Michaeretz’s memory. The name owes itself to the Germanic word/root for city or town. Therefore, Loki’s City.
Not taking her eyes off Angel, she gave a small wave of her hand, and the hedges drew away. Sam and Dean took deep breaths, shaking out their limbs and brushing at the thin pricks of blood the thorns left behind. But Angel didn’t react. The stallion looked so sad and sorry, so different from his usual pride and strength, that Dean felt himself puff up with anger. But the woman had very clearly just done magic, which made her a Reaper, or more likely, a Demon. He had never heard of a royal family member handing out spells to anyone else. How in the world were they going to protect themselves? He picked his knife up off the ground, and didn’t sheathe it. Sam and Dean eyed each other over Angel’s back. How were they going to play this?
“Sure did,” agreed Rufus, carefully arranging the halter and matching lead in his hands. “As long as Lucifer is still alive the war will happen again. He didn’t get what he wanted last time. These mages like him and Metatron, they think in the long term. The very long term. If I’m lucky, I’ll be dead and buried by the time war starts up again.” He laughed, setting the small silver horseshoe earring he wore dancing. None of the present men were fooled; Rufus, too, had lost his family in the Border War. “Now if any of you need me, think twice. I’ve got a date with a bottle that has my name on it.” With that he wandered off down the aisle toward the tack room.
