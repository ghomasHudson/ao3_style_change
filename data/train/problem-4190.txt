“I did. I wouldn’t know who to invite.” He said grabbing a gallon of milk. “You of course, and your family, Missouri.”
“Cas you’re an amazing kisser trust me, but you’re the first person I’ve actually dated in a while and I don’t wanna mess this up by moving too fast. I wanna do this right.”
“Hey Dad.” Dean swallowed and let out a soft exhale. He slid his shaking hands in his pockets. He could not and would not show weakness. Not when weakness was what John Winchester hated the most.
“Since you’re my boyfriend you get to know you’re grade early. I still sent you the email though so you should check it out.”
He turned his phone to show Dean and it was an image of an angel crying. The text under it said ‘your son is crying’.
Castiel moaned for so many reasons that time. For the endearing nickname he grew to adore, for the deepened tone of Dean’s lustful voice. The words themselves held so much. ‘What ever you want’ meant whatever Castiel was comfortable with is what Dean would do. Whatever he was willing to offer Dean would accept. In this moment and out of all of their moments thus far this by far was the most meaningful.
He kept his movements sharp, and fast hoping not to create too much noise. But this caused the build up with him to grow fast. He bent over Castiel’s torso as best as he could, holding his shoulders and using them to pull him backwards to meet his thrusts. Castiel was losing his mind now, he tried to stay as quiet as he could. Where screams would fly freely he had to reduce them to little whimpers instead. Dean was moving at a relentless pace, far different from how he’d been a few nights prior, but he loved it just the same.
He bends forward and puts his mouth to the head and sucks slowly. Castiel’s body betrays him once again and he lets out a moan.
With their 3 guests settled on the couch talking comfortably with Bobby and Ellen, Sam went to comfort his brother where he sat. He pulled out a chair and sat next to the man after getting his own beer. While he was glad that his brother had opted for just that and nothing harder he still didn’t like seeing him use alcohol as a coping mechanism. He wanted to say something, anything in hopes that it would give his brother some peace of mind. In the back of his mind he knew that any words would only be blown off or serve as wood to the fire he knew that burned within Dean, so he sat in silence. Hoping that his company would be enough in the moment they sat and sipped lightly on their drinks.
“Yeah pretty much. Why? Do you have a preference?” his hands returned to Castiel’s back and he was drawing patterns again.
Dean kept going until he felt the tell tale heat in his groin. His rhythm was stuttering but still at the same speed he kept up all this time. Castiel wasn’t the only one lost in the sensations that tied them together.
“I know. I pestered him about it until he told me the truth. I knew it hadn’t made sense for you to leave like that without a reason. You must know that I am truly sorry for that.”
Castiel walked up behind him and slowly wound his arms around the other man’s middle earning a little yelp of surprise. He’d never mention it though because Dean Winchester doesn’t yelp.
Castiel pried his eyes open at the last second. Another three strokes and he was done, strong pulses pushed through the water in the tub. Dean followed right behind him, everything tensing up as he let go along with him. Heavy breaths and foreheads together they came down slowly. When he got some of his bearings straight he pulled Dean into his lap, kissing him sweetly on his lips.
With a nod he went to the counter and order Dean’s beverage. His chest puffed up with pride at making a good decision on the pie. He tried his hardest not to laser focus on what Dean had said in response to his little ramble session. Now was not the time for that. He grabbed his order and returned to the table to find the man had finished his pie and looked quite proud about it.
“Well now that we’ve cleared the air,” he bent forward and kissed Castiel sweetly, “How about we eat some lunch and then I finish you off nice and slow?”
Holy mother of all! He’d fallen asleep and forgot to set his alarm. Rushing out of bed to look for his clothes he realized he hadn’t set any out for their date tonight!
It was the fact that he didn’t know what they were that made him want to stow his crap and just do the shoot. He’d done a few things for the magazine earlier in the week, but he didn’t have a big project coming up for another month. He wasn’t strapped for cash in any sense, he did have his eye on some new equipment that he couldn’t just splurge on when a big payday was so far away. Rent still needed to be paid and he had to eat. With the funds from Gabriel he could easy do all three.
He’d even been spending a lot of time with Sam as well. The young man was witty and had a banter similar to Dean’s in its quickness, but not in its vulgarity. He enjoyed research and learning about the world around him, knowing a lot about ancient times, and mythical beings. Castiel enjoyed their conversations when they met up at the library or when they decided to take a trip to Moondoor.
The sight before him was more debauched than he could ever imagine. Dean’s backside was on full display, his hole entirely exposed. It was reddened and spit slick from all of Castiel’s previous work. Dean was shaking as he stroked himself, thrusting into the circle he’d made with his hands. He was beautiful, and their moans rang through the air.
She left the car on and ran inside the small coffee shop to grab their drinks. No one was in the parking lot so he pulled his supplies from his backpack and rolled a blunt with quick movements and precision. He only started smoking a year ago when he met Charlie. She’s the one who convinced him to do it. Now it was a regular thing for him and he got almost too good at rolling. His turned out better than Charlie’s had, now she always makes him roll.
They got in the car and Dean started it turning on the heat an waited for it to get warm. The usual silence between them hung in the air. Only this time it wasn’t uncomfortable and awkward. It was just what it was.
“Don’t good—Dean why haven’t you called me all this time? At least shoot me a text to let me know you got home fine.”
Dean smiled at the sight in front of him. Cas was dressed in a black and yellow striped shirt with some black skinny jeans. They weren’t tight enough to be repulsive but they fit snug enough in all the right places. He had a set of translucent wings strapped to his back and a small set of antlers on his head. Dean’s stomach turned as he took in the sight of his boyfriend. ‘dammit he’s freaking adorable and hot at the same time.’ He cursed to himself. Dean approached the shorter man and placed a hand on his hip while leaning towards his ear.
“Sam.” He said shaking his brother’s shoulder. When he didn’t stir Dean shook him a little harder. “Sam!”
When they finished eating he offered to wash the dishes, brushing off Dean’s attempt at a protest. Castiel just needed something to do with his hands, somewhere else for his mind to go before he pounced on Dean. All the things he found on that laptop a few days prior just made things worse. Cas masturbated more than he ever had because he just couldn’t get enough. That of course made things much worse since his hand wasn’t Dean’s body and that’s what he really craved. He kicked Dean out of the kitchen, shoving a beer in his hand and urging him to go watch tv. He needed to be alone right now before his mind was truly lost. He got about half way through the dishes, trying to get his thoughts in order and remain a sane individual, but that didn’t go far at all.
“You’re absolutely incorrect about that. But I am happy that you’re staying. What will you do for work?”
“Are you kidding me? This is hot as hell.” He removed a hand from Cas’ hip and placed it on the back of his neck pulling Cas’ lips to crash against his.
“Alright. Well let me get going. I’ve got an appointment to make.” He bounced over to the doorway, “Heh. Look at me having appointments.”
Charlie was studying computer science. Castiel completely disagreed with her choice and thought she should switch to politics instead. The way that woman smoothly convinced him to attend the ridiculous party without breaking a sweat was a work of wonders. Against his better judgement he found himself agreeing. She had some good points and agreed to stay with him the entire time. She’d even installed some fancy GPS system on his phone so that even if they were separated by the wild, flailing bodies of drunken college students, they’d be able to find each other easily. It put a part of his frantic mind at ease, but he was still very wary about going. She also brought up the point that the possibility of Dick being there shouldn’t stop him from having fun. Balthazar even agreed to being his body guard. That must’ve been quite a feat convincing him to do that. He was the king of partying if there ever was one. But with all of this he actually really wanted Dean to be there. Thank goodness the theme of the party was a masquerade, whatever attire you wanted, but you had to wear a mask or you wouldn’t be admitted. All Castiel had to do was muster up his own political argument to convince Dean to go. That would be the biggest feat of them all.
“How about this,” he turned in the man’s arms and put his arms around his neck, “We go home right now, go to sleep and in the morning I’ll let you watch me open myself up and you can pound me into the mattress.”
Now he found himself walking up the side walk to the front door of his actual home. He still felt eyes on him, but refused to turn around and give whoever it was the satisfaction of being noticed. Walking through the door he heard some bustle in the kitchen and went to go investigate.
When he was finished and breathing through the lingering aftershocks, he ripped the headphones off of his head and laid back on the pillows behind him. That was the hardest he’d come in quite a while and once his head was screwed on correctly, he’d texted Dean back letting him know.
“Everyday that I was in rehab. They have a um vet program that I’ve been going to. It’s free and it’s been helping the cravings. I ain’t been clean that long but like I said I’m trying.”
“Alright, alright we’re done with that.” he hit Sam upside the head. “We’re gonna head out before you ruin my friendship.”
The man suddenly offered Dean one of them, made of a dark reddish wood. It was covered in ornate designs, looked to be hand carved. It was beautiful, with the shiny gold strings that offered a nice contrast. Dean held it for a moment, a soft and thoughtful smile on his lips. A smile that held stories of a past that Castiel knew nothing about. He wanted nothing more in that moment to hear every story Dean could offer involving the instrument. All he really knew of Dean’s past were the dark times his father offered. He wanted to know the light hearted ones, the happy moments in the man’s life, when all the sunshine was on him. Dean strummed one time on it before he began playing a tune that Castiel didn’t recognize. It was a dark sounding song, but it was striking nonetheless. Dean still smiled while he played, only the look in his eyes held a bit of sadness, like this song brought him memories of a time long forgotten. He played for a while, until a small crowd began to form a circle around the two of them. He didn’t look up not once, even though a series of eyes were trained on him. No one said a word, no one sang along, they just focused all their attention on the man with the guitar.
The man sat on the bed, an array of toys around him. Castiel had no idea when those got there, but he was thrilled to see each and every one used. Dean was propped up on way too many pillows for a normal person’s bed, but the bleached white of them made his skin glow all the more. He looked right at the camera licking his lips. Castiel found himself licking his own as well.
Dick hadn’t returned until the end of the class day the following afternoon. Castiel did his best to ignore him. He really tried to be angry with him and he was, but that only lasted a couple of days with Dick doing his hardest to butter him up. The following weekend he found himself at another party. Dick had promised to just stick to a light amount of booze and to leave the hard drugs alone. But of course that was a lie.
Its funny how once a plan is agreed upon ten million things get in the way. Dean had made them a lovely lunch of deli sandwiches and fruit bowls. They talked about Castiel’s upcoming trip to the coast of Madagascar. Dean was more concerned about how he’d be gone for a week, which was quite sweet. He’d told the man how a week was much shorter then his regular long-term jobs and Dean grumbled away about Castiel abandoning him.
“Sorry about all this Cas.” He said as he popped the top on the Tupperware of his homemade chocolate strawberries. “I promise you it wasn’t supposed to rain.”
Cas turned his head and Dean followed to find Charlie on the other side of Sam laughing about something he had said. She waved and turned her attention back to Sam.
He reached inside and saw a black guitar case. He pulled it out gingerly, wanting to not drop it. He draped the case across his lap and flicked the locks open and lifted the lid. Inside was the same guitar he had played at that festival they attended by accident. Where he played a song for a small crowd of people. He could feel tears welling in his eyes at the sight of it. This was a gorgeous instrument and Castiel took the time and money to buy it for him. He pulled it from the case and pushed the shell on the ground in front of him, the guitar taking it’s place.
He felt a leg run in between his own. Rubbing his calves, on the inside of his thigh. It didn’t even occur to him how close their legs were under the table. Since they were about the same height and the booth was rather small, with a small scoot forward the other man was able to get his knee right up against Castiel's crotch.
, he chanted over and over in his head like a prayer. Hell he hoped someone was listening and was willing to grant his prayer.  They pulled into one of the back lots, the same one he’d smoked with Charlie and Cas all those months ago. Simpler times brought him happy memories.
“It’s alright Cas. I’m not as fragile as I use to be. I’m just not up for going into detail right now.” he took a long pause looking at Castiel.
Hey no hey now! There is some sexual content in this chapter.........yup. I'm happy you guys are enjoying the story so far. Shout out to elfe for letting me know the fic was shown as completed. This is far from complete *nervous laughter*. This is my favorite chapter I've written so far and I'd love to hear your thoughts on it (be gentle please ;(   ).
This whole scene was painfully cliché, but that was actually funny. Maybe this was why his brother was so popular in this industry. You wouldn’t expect to be laughing at porn. In response Dean just took the hand of the other and trailed it down his slightly damp shirt until he reached the front of his pants.
“That hurt, but I guess I deserve it.” He said rubbing the assaulted part of his head. “How you doing Ellen?”
“I tried to feed him. I’m not a heartless monster Kevin, but anything I’ve tried to give him outside of water he’s spit out and refused to swallow. He’s a difficult little thing.” He patted Castiel’s head roughly. “Aren’t you angel?”
Dean smirked at this grateful for the darkness of the room so Cas wouldn’t flash him his normal squinty frown he only used when Dean acted cockier than usual.
“Coming right up.” The blonde, now he knew was named Jo smiled at the man before walking off to fill his order.
“Well we wanna meet this young man. If your Dad has to be kicked out then so be it. You can’t be afraid to bring him around your family.”
Dean had told them they were going to a bar, but this place felt much more high class then that. They’d agreed that the man would pick him up, and with the way his leather jacket fell over his shoulders and his burgundy dress shirt pulled over his firm chest, they almost didn’t make it to the car. The man had even worn a tie! He’d gotten dressed up too after a lot of heckling from dear Gabriel. He’d thought his suit fit him just fine but he couldn’t seen to win. Now he was wearing way too much money right now and he didn’t even pay for it.
“Hell, you might as well be the way Cassie goes on about you. Heard about the family dinner. Real cute seeing him so excited about it.”
Dean got out of the car with all the swag of a man who owns the world. He came to Castiel’s side with a cold look on his face he’d never seen before. It gave him chills even though it wasn’t for him. Dean looked angry, and dangerous.
“Maybe you need another one of those.” He motioned his head towards the empty coffee cup sitting on Castiel’s desk.
His eyes darted across all the masked faces within view, hoping that none of them would walk over to his little protective group. Things were going too well for it to crash and burn so suddenly. He felt sick to his stomach and the sudden need to get some air overwhelmed him.
Now he was utterly confused, but he didn’t have enough time to get upset because Dean walked into the room with that blinding smile of his.
“I’m sorry I must admit that I’m a little nervous. I don’t want you to leave. It’s why I asked in the first place.” He turned down the covers and began getting into the bed.
“That’s all he said really. Besides that I should come over and talk to you because you probably wouldn’t want to see him.”
He heard a laugh that formed into a cough at the end of the table, clearly coming from John. Castiel had to reel in some self-control not to glare at the man, he felt Dean’s grip on his knee tighten and sat a hand of his own on top. It seemed no matter what he would say, no matter how basic and platonic the words were that they wouldn’t be accepted by John. He could’ve said he was thankful that it didn’t rain today and it still wouldn’t be received well. And that was no fault of his or Dean’s.
When Dean lifted his head to respond there was a rim of vanilla ice cream all over his mouth. Heaven help him this man would be his demise.
“You have nothing to worry about with Sam. He might seem like a giant scary…giant, but he’s really just a ball of play dough.”
In the car Dean offered him once last glance before starting the car and turning on his music, then pulling onto the road.
Castiel had to fight back a moan at that. He swallowed it down and letting nothing but a soft sigh leave his lips.
The party was in full swing by the time they arrived. Music booming from all speakers that surrounded the main dance floor, bodies swaying and bouncing to the beat. It was pleasant chaos. Charlie had her arm wrapped in Castiel’s as Dean escorted the two of them towards the bar. His movements were stiffened, like his arms were too heavy all of a sudden. If it were any quieter in the venue he was sure he’d be able to hear each thud of the boots on his feet. Dean was more stalking than simply walking, a predator ready to tear apart anything in his path. Castiel was no weakling that needed security detail, if it was only another person or two that he was up against. A group of them was another story, and Dick never made public appearances without an entourage to help puff up his narcissistic feathers. A group attacking required a group fighting, and he had his own entourage willing to battle alongside him. It was a comforting feeling, a safe bubble wrapped around him. He knew he could actually enjoy himself tonight because of this, and that was his full intention.
“If you can imagine it your dear old Dad is actually a college graduate. Went to business school with that fucker.”
And just like that they were children again and not full grown men, they began swatting and poking at each other until the was a knock on the door. They sprang apart as if preparing for a scolding from mother instead of the real reason they were there. Gabriel with a smirk and a saucy wink went to get the door while Castiel busied himself with his camera.
Castiel was high. Almost too high. He lazily dragged his phone up to his face and squinted at the notification. He had two emails. One a group email from Dean to his class and another one from him just addressed to Castiel.
To spare Dean further embarrassment about his helpless ‘mother henning’ he simply smiled and did what was asked of him.
“Whatever you choose is fine.” A small smile tugged at the corners of his mouth and light crinkles formed around his eyes. He looked sweet and youthful like this. Something in Dean rose to the surface and he wanted Cas to look like that at all times.
There was so much to do and so little daylight to do it with. He wanted to be inside the safety of his room before the sun went down. He didn’t know this town at all, but he’d learned from experience that with the cover of night there was often danger. Ready to go he walked to a small market that was a 5 minutes from the Inn. As he passed the front desk he noticed the woman that checked him in wasn’t there, replaced by a dark haired woman that looked closer to his age. She didn’t look up, clicking away on her desk, looking as bored as ever.
Dean was startled awake by his blaring phone, it’s alarm ringing right next to his head. The little bundle next to him snored softly and moved in his sleep. He found smile at the little guy surrounded in pillows. He didn’t have a crib at his place. He never thought to buy one so whenever Mark came over he just barricaded him in pillows. Dean was never a heavy sleeper so any sudden moves or any cried that the baby had made he was awake in a flash ready to take whatever action was needed.
While this tactic seemed to work on Dean if his dopey smile and low-lidded eyes was anything to go by, it served to make his own arousal worse. He’d have to make sure the man was tucked in and asleep before he could go to take care of himself.
He felt no different than John, using liquor to escape the dull, strumming pain in his heart. A toxic temporary fix to a very real issue, his favorite pass time. But unlike his father, Dean had very real responsibilities that he had to worry about. At this point in time he was lying on his couch cradling a half full bottle of Jack. Classes were starting tomorrow and it was high time to sober up. Whatever was playing on the Tv was lost on him, he had no attention towards anything but the sloshing in his head and how loose his body felt. Dragging himself off of the couch seemed to be a feat of its own, actually putting his alcohol away was yet another feat.
“So what’s this all about?” she asked with a hint of her suspicion in her tone. Sam was right when he told Dean that his silence often spoke for him.
“I’ve got a lot to lose on this one lil bro. If I fuck this up I’m basically destroying my career and tainting others.”
Clicking on the second video it started with two attractive looking guys playing chess. How could this move to porn? He clicked the time stamp forward and found that they were playing for the removal of clothes. He clicked further even more and the blonde man ended up naked first. It was decided that he would be the bottom. Moving ahead further still the brunette man that had won the game tied the blonde’s hands to the head board and began opening him up with his tongue and fingers. He seemed to be enjoying it. Castiel was quite aware that these people were still actors and they get paid to look like they enjoy what’s being done to them, but nonetheless he appeared to genuinely enjoy what was happening. Without the use of his hands he was at the total mercy of the other guy. A certain amount of trust would be required to do something like this with a partner. Totally against his decision his mind flashed back to how he was held down during the incident with Dick and his friends. A nasty shiver ran through his body and a pit grew in his stomach. He didn’t want anything like that ever again. He wondered if Dean would want something like this. He wasn’t even sure if he could trust Dean to do this to him, or anyone for that matter.
“Thank you. You look beyond attractive today.” His eyes trailed down Dean’s body, noticing he was wearing the coat he’d given him the night before. “It should be illegal for how good that coat looks on you.”
The man below him was beside himself with pleasure, moaning Castiel’s name several times before his body went tense and falling to the mattress in a puddle of sated pleasure. He wished he could’ve seen the man’s face as he succumbed to carnal call of his body, but again there was always next time. He laid next to the man who was face planted into his pillow for several minutes before he was gathered into the man’s arms.
“Your secret is safe with me hon. So when are you guys going on your first date? Maybe discuss this stuff then.”
Though he was angry, he couldn’t help but agree with them on that. He did think any shade of red looked amazing on Dean, though Dean could wear a clown suit and still look gorgeous somehow.
Next, they went to a second hand shop that was quite far away for his dresser. They could have gotten it from the same place they got the mattress, but Dean had assured him that the place across town had much better stuff. The store itself was obviously family run, none of the bright and overfriendly branding that you would find in a chain store. This place belonged to someone, loved by someone. He found that Dean was right, this place was much better. He’d found much more than he came in there for including his kitchen set, and some décor for the living room. All that was left to get was the bookcase, which he didn’t find one that he liked. They’d spent so much time at the second hand shop that the sun was setting. Since Castiel was now the permanent resident of the apartment now, he had the keys so he could start moving when he wanted to. Dean helped him get the furniture in, that was a feat all in itself. Hard to move things upstairs that were just a hair too narrow. He also helped him setup all the stuff they got for the kitchen all put away. He took the reins on this one and Dean just did as he asked.
“Plus you gotta know by now that you’re special to me. I mean we’ve been on a date Cas. I don’t date.” Dean’s hands were caressing his chest now.
Dean moved boldly now, until they were touching shoulder to knee. He jostled the laptop a bit, moving it on top of his painful erection. He had no choice but to let out the moan he’d been keeping inside for the last 10 minutes.
“I’m gonna swat you with this spoon if you come back in here again!” she wiggled the wooden spoon she held.
Well that explained the red gunk. Castiel grabbed the only semi-clean hand towel and swiped some flour from above his Father’s eye and smiled down at him.
Castiel finally turned away so he could finish his rapidly melting delight and not get distracted by Dean. Once they were done discarding their trash they began their walk back towards the Inn. The other man had left his car at Missouri’s store, but he wanted to make sure Castiel got in alright first. It warmed him to hear that Dean was concerned for his wellbeing in his own way.
“Charlie can we not do this right now?” He rubbed at his forehead stopping a good 3 feet in front of her.
He rolled Dean on his back and spread his legs as he licked a stripe up his dick, fondling his balls until he brought a finger down to tease his perineum. Dean bucked his hips and Cas placed a firm hand on his abdomen to hold him down. He sucked relentlessly at his erection until Dean screamed out filling Cas’ mouth with warm, sweet release. He stayed on him until he was sure he finished and came off slowly. He laid next to the panting man loving the way his chest rose and fell rapidly, until he got the oxygen he needed and returned to a normal breathing pace.
Castiel hadn’t been able to spend much time with Dean for the last week and a half. A couple breakfast and lunch dates here and there, but 30 minutes was only 30 minutes. Dean had been busy between work and family things to take care of and Castiel was more than ready to settle down for the night wrapped in his man’s arms. Finally, their schedules aligned, he just had to get through the rest of the work day.
Kevin was a simple man. He liked to study and hang out with friends….when he had time for such things. He wasn’t a big party person, but he got along with everyone he’d met. He thought himself to be a likable person. His mother was the only person he slightly butted heads with. She had it in her head that Kevin needed to be the best at everything he set out to do. She had this big plan for him and his life. She wanted him to be a neurosurgeon and head of the field at that. Sure he wanted to be in the medical field, but he didn’t want to do all of that. He wanted to be a simple nurse, preferably in the pediatric. He liked children and children liked him. He could relate to them and their wild minds, full of curiosity and wonder. They had their whole lives ahead of them, so much to look forward to, and if his work could make that journey better, or easier then that’s what he wanted to do. He hadn’t shared his dreams and desires with her of course, she’d know in time.
“Funny how you’ve been watching me all night.” He stepped closer once again. “In time you’ll change your mind about me Castiel.”
Should he just show up at this address? Clearly it was to Dean’s home, looking out up on gps it was a house pictured there.
Of course Sam had called Cas. He was surprised that Sam hadn’t come with him. He expected a full therapy session paired with a raging intervention.
“I’m touching myself too angel. Thinking about those pretty lips of yours kissing all over me. Those long legs tangled up with mine as I’m stroking you.”
Didn’t take Dean long to turn his finished basement into a studio. Maybe he’d gotten a little too excited about the new endeavor he was going on with his boyfriend. He’d brought a whole new bed and sheets and blankets to go with it, he’d gotten a chaise too because imagining himself spread on that, with Cas so close to him, filming, had him hard as nails in seconds flat. He’d even got a bunch of new toys that he totally didn’t need but wanted anyway. Could probably even use a few on Cas.
Finally gathering his thoughts he crawled out of bed ready to start his day. He texted Cas letting him know he was up and that he would come get him once the pies were in the oven since they did those last. Thinking about the enormous gift he got his boyfriend, with Chuck’s help, he was now made of excitement. He just hoped Cas would be as delighted as he was.
As they sat facing each other, a cup in hand and their legs tangled around each other Castiel felt like….like he was washed ashore and Dean was the only one who was able to save him. In normal instances he’d panic and run for the hills screaming, but somehow, maybe it was just because it was Dean, he didn’t want to run. He wanted to stay and fight for it all. After that terrible night with Dick it took him a year before he could even go on a date. And whenever it came time to be intimate he shied away and ran. A couple of times he quite literally fled the scene and never saw that individual again. Now that he was finally comfortable with some intimacy he wanted to set up some boundaries that he really didn’t want to cross.
“Well dinner should be about done. How bout we resume all this over dinner?” Ellen spoke up as she walked towards the kitchen.
“Alright well I know we’ve got….about 20 minutes left of class, but I want to get out of here just as much as you guys,” Dean’s joke earned him some scattered giggles, “So go on and get out of here. Enjoy your break.”
He was greeted by the rest of the Winchester clan and Missouri. The men gave him friendly handshakes and pats on the back and the women embraced him lovingly. Everyone had a dish in their hands, this was turning out to be quite a feast and they’d only gotten started.
“Cassie hasn’t had the best luck with guys if you can imagine the impossible. So what I need you to do is be easy on him. Clearly he’s smitten with you and from what I’ve heard from him you’re a decent dude. So just treat him well and we’re all good.”
“I’m just tired Charlie. I don’t even want to think about getting back into the dating pool. It’s messy and tragic.”
As a child and throughout most of his adult life he thought it was somehow his fault, he had a habit of internalizing everything that happened around him whether it had anything to do with him or not. Self-blaming was in his nature, ingrained into the fibers of his being. He’d gotten better as he got older, but not by much. Now he was pacing in front of the back porch, where Sam sat on the steps with his hands folded in his lap and his lip between his teeth. He knew Dean was about to explode, hell Dean knew he was going to explode, but he found it within himself not to. Sam was only trying to help, and he knew that, but it didn’t make Dean any less angry. Sam always did have the greatest intentions laced in the stupid things he did. This was bad, but maybe it wasn’t all bad. Dean took his father’s confession to seeking actual help with a grain of salt amidst a field of doubt, but the hope was there nonetheless. Love did that to people, even one very angry and anxious Dean Winchester.
Dean thought about that for a minute. Of course he wanted him to come over. He wanted to hold him and lay on his chest under his sheets, listening to his heart beat until he fell asleep. But Dean couldn’t possibly say that. He’d feel like he was being desperate, and desperate wasn’t him. On the other hand he truly didn’t want Cas to see him broken like this. Broken didn’t look good on him and he felt it was too early to show it. Hell he’d been with Lisa for a year before she’d seen him cry.
The scene that laid out before him was not one that he expected. Castiel stood over Dick squirming on the ground with a look on his face that could smite an army of men. His lip was cut but other than that he looked relatively fine. Balthazar was crouched on the floor with a hand over his left eye and breathing heavily, the two other guys that no doubt belonged to Dick’s crew were knocked out cold on the floor. It was 3 against two and pretty obvious they had won. Dean stepped over Dick’s trembling body to embrace his fuming boyfriend.
“Better now than later. What if he wants something casual? I don’t want you to get your hopes all up and then it crashes and burns.”
This earned him a giggle and a head roll as Castiel spun in his arms. He had a dopey grin and his eyes were quite dilated. Nope. Dean stopped himself right there.
“You can get all your cuddles and soft kisses when we get back.” Cas rolled his eyes and removed himself from Dean’s embrace.
Dean really wanted to hear the man’s answer to his proposition. He didn’t want to push him, so he’d kept his thoughts to himself. His manager was anxious to know what was up too. The studio would provide all the equipment at the drop of a hat for something like this.
“Yes, it’ll be 3 months on Friday.” He nodded sipping what Dean would call his ‘liquid sugar’ coffee. “He wants to go out to dinner after my shift.”
At least he was able to bring his brother on these hunts. Sam had been the only one to defend his point, and really see the situation from his side. That’s probably why he got stuck with him. They both knew Sam was here to keep Dean from flying off the rails, keep him grounded.
“Nope,” Dean said pushing his head away, “That’s cheating. Only your hands on and in my ass are allowed in this game.”
“Yes! You can change the words however you like, but that should be the general message.” He rolled his eyes. “I know that’s not an easy thing to admit for you, but the least you can do is try. Because right now I’m the only one who’s trying.”
Dean and Sam took off without another word. The building looked freshly abandoned, the vegetation hadn’t quite taken over the sides of the building. The grass around it came only shin high so it’d maybe been a few months since it’s been left alone. That means the locks wouldn’t be worn down enough to simply bust open. They’d have to pick them.  A couple windows were broken in, probably from some people needing someplace to squat for a while, Dean certainly remembers those days. Most likely more than his brother would. He listened to the noise around them and hearing not much else but the general noise of being outside and their own footsteps. He couldn’t hear anything from the building itself, which could mean two things: Cas and his kidnappers weren’t in there anymore, or they were just in an inner part of the building and whatever noise that was being made the sound hadn’t reached to the outskirts.
“There’s no rush Dean.” His sultry, gravel filled voice erupted into the car. Cas obviously wasn’t as nervous as Dean was, but he was still anxious none the less. He really wasn’t in a rush to get inside. He wanted to have all his thoughts in order so he wouldn’t mess this up.
“That little faggot boy of yours called the cops on me.” he continued. “I know you’re at your Uncle Bobby’s so hear me and hear me good. That gay shit stops now, or that won’t be the last beating you’ll receive from me.”
Castiel could hear the back handed insult in that and he cringed. He could practically hear Dean getting angry next to him, but he simply just kept a light caress on his hand letting him know silently that he was here for him. The man could’ve said worse, and by the hate he spat his words at Dean with the other day he knew this. If this was him behaving himself, and this is as cordial, then he would take it over anything else. He could tell, taking a short side glance at Dean, that the words stung him deep within himself. Everyone’s eyes were either glaring at John or looking at Dean softly, everyone else knew there was sarcasm and disapproval hidden within those words.
As an hour passed he finally decided to take an actual break, his brain was tired. He pushed back from his desk and descended the stairs in search of a snack. He was surprised to see his Father sitting in front of the tv. Definitely a rare sight to see the man so relaxed and actually home for once.
Dean came back to the present. He was utterly exhausted sharing that tale. Castiel hadn’t said a word throughout, and until his eyes focused on the man he had forgotten he was even there. Dean always thought that sharing that story would magically lift the weight of it off his shoulder, but it honestly just made him tired. Castiel sensed as much and without a word he stood, helped Dean off the couch where they say and led him to his bedroom. Quietly shutting the door behind him he began to undress, raising a brow to tell Dean to do the same. Once they wore nothing but their boxers they both crawled into bed. Dean immediately snuggled up to Castiel, lying his head on his chest and draped an arm around his waist. He was glad for the lack of questions, and just for the silent comfort the man offered. A loving heart thumped consistently in his ear. The sound of it alone lulled Dean to a deep sleep.
Though Dick obviously though he was the king of evil villains, he wasn’t as smart as he thought he was. His master plan had more than a couple holes in it, and Kevin knew it was only a small matter of time before the damn burst and everything unraveled in his lap. For one when they came back they hadn’t locked the door to Kevin’s room, they also took his phone but not his laptop, and it would’ve made more sense to have Castiel patched up and taken away immediately, not leaving him on campus to be found. Kevin never saw it necessary to be delighted in another person’s ignorance, but he was more than happy about it now.
“I know I don’t have to I just want to. Let me be nice.” Dean reached out a hand and Castiel took it without another thought.
Dean knew deep down that his efforts were in vain. Once his brother got going he wouldn’t stop until he was satisfied that he had done what he thought was right. They got in the car once Dean was finished dressing. He tuned out Sam’s radio and looked out the window at the dark landscape. He didn’t like Sam’s car or his driving. He’d rather be driving his baby, but he was grateful that he’d be able to safely drink.
Dean went straight for Dick, not even bothering to look at anyone else. Dick tried to go for his gun, but he was much too slow and Dean was clearly quicker. He grabbed him by the collar of his jacket and slammed him against the wall opposite the bed. His fist connected with Dick’s jaw before he got right up in his face.
When he sat down to watch a docuseries that Sam recommended him, he couldn’t stop thinking about the images he’d saw. As if they were permanently etched in his thoughts. Castiel may have been a virgin but he wasn’t clueless, he’d seen mild forms of porn before. Clicking on a movie he didn’t mean to while channel surfing in the various hotels he’d stayed in. Pausing the tv, he went back to his room to retrieve his phone. He searched the word again and decided to watch a video instead of pictures. Sure Dean had said to eat him as an insult, that much he gathered from his tone, but he wondered if the man secretly wanted this to be done to him. There were so many videos to choose from, it was a little overwhelming so he just picked the first one.
“Please talk to me. I can’t say sorry more than I have already. I didn’t mean for that to happen. Just hear me out.” He heard his feet shuffling behind him as he stormed off.
“So I haven’t seen you in forever. Would you like to explain that?” Charlie took a sip of her coffee while scowling at Castiel.
“I won’t let anything bad happen to you. This is me we’re talking about. Just take a couple sips. If you don’t like it I’ll drink it.”
Thinking back to the video for reference, he remembered how the not Dean’s bottom looked. While it was nice, real Dean’s was much meatier, sitting up proud even though he was laid flat. He grabbed the eucalyptus massage oil, moving to sit atop Dean’s calves. He watched the muscles in his back ripple and tense in anticipation for what was to happen next. He started at the top of his back, using a small amount of oil as Meg has said a little went a long way.
“Castiel wow you’re back from the dead?” Charlie shouted as she entered his house. She embraced her friend and hugged him tight to her own lithe frame. “I’ve missed you.”
“No Dean. You said it was up to me if we went, and I said yes. Now I don’t know what your Dad did to you, but I know he did something. Judging off what he did earlier this week I can tell he is not a good Father. Your family clearly wants you there and I will stand by you through this whole ordeal. Whether it’s perfect or not.”
Oh my. This was the problem with talking on the phone. Dean expected an answer immediately. Before he could think any further about it, he’d agreed to it. This seemed to be happening a lot lately.
Cas convinced himself that he would initiate their first time over the weekend and unfortunately the weekend came all too soon. Friday evening after his last class Dean texted him asking if he’d come over for dinner. Castiel couldn’t say no to the man, especially with his intended plans for the night. He now found himself in his room trying to find the perfect underwear to wear for the night. He knew Dean wouldn’t care one bit what underwear he should wear, but he was nervous, and to his nervous brain this was something worth thinking about.
So Dean now knew he was into dudes. He was into any gender really. It wasn’t an important factor when picking a partner. He was more drawn to personality than anything else.
Dean wrapped Castiel up like he was ready to protect him from the whole world. He put all his strength into that hug. Castiel could hardly move. His arms were pinned up at his side. The mug threatening to fall from his hand. To be honest he didn’t really want to move. This was the complete opposite of the reaction he was sure to get.
“You didn’t raise me at all!” he continued laughing. “Bobby and Ellen were more of a parent to me than you could ever be!”
“I’m good… let’s go Cas.” Dean half smiled and gave him a peck on the cheek before getting out of the car.
“Why didn’t you tell me I was filming Dean Winchester?!” he snapped in the most aggressive whisper he could muster.
He launched forward and kissed Dean, judging by the man’s clear surprise that probably wasn’t part of the script, but they couldn’t stop now. Dean quickly took the control of the kiss, as he always did with Castiel. Arousal was stirring inside of the jealousy he began to feel the moment their lips touched. He wanted to be that young man, all up in Dean’s space, breathing him in.
He nodded in response then spun in the stool, slightly pushing Dean back so that he could wrap his waist in between his thighs. Leaning forward to place a chaste kiss on the other man’s lips, as that was the only thing their masks would allow them to do. He didn’t much understand the purpose of the plastic face coverings. Charlie said it was to add the thrill of anonymity, and cut down on rumors, as well as freeing inhibitions. He saw it as more of a danger personally due to the fact that he couldn’t tell who was who. It was frightening, looking out to the crowd to only see pieces of unknown faces. Dean must’ve been able to sense his discomfort and tugged him forward by his legs, wrapping him in a tight embrace and burying his face on the side of his neck. His lips reached up and teeth caught his earlobe as he sucked the skin into his mouth.
They’d finished eating so Castiel cleared the dishes away. Dean, of course, wanted to help where he could so he dried while he washed. More idle conversation was passed, and Castiel could barely keep up because his mind was in shambles about what was coming next. It was time to just get it over with so he grabbed the bag off of his bookshelf and shoved it at Dean’s face.
“Yeah I am. Um you don’t have to dress up or anything. It’s a pretty normal spot we’re going to. If that’s ok.”
He walked with his purchases bagged up back to his car. He’d parked on the side of the building since there were no available spots open right in front. Once he made it to the driver side he grabbed his keys out of his pocket. Suddenly half his face was covered with a white cloth and a strong arm wrapped around his neck. Flailing and scratching at the arm currently assaulting he inhaled a sweet scent. His arms had lost all their strength until he could barely struggle.
“Alright everyone you know the deal. Let’s go around the table and say something we’re thankful for. And keep it clean and happy folks.” She shot John a glare that would turn a lesser man into a crying mess. “I’ll start with I’m thankful for all the ones gathered here today. You’re my family, even the new additions,” she smiled at Castiel, “And I’m glad you could all make it here in one piece.”
“Listen,” he sighed obviously trying to reign in his anger, “I’m not gonna tell you what to do. You’re a grown ass man and can make your own decisions. You are also someone who deserves respect, and if you aren’t getting that from Balthazar then maybe this friendship ain’t the best for you.”
Spotting movement he raised his gun, but on a second glance it was only Gabe walking around with his shoulders slumped.
“It was at first, but now I’m actually glad it happened. My mom is a wonderful person and incredibly strong.”
“I’m gonna go to the restroom.” He yelled in his friend’s ear so that he’d actually be able to hear him.
“Don’t take me to a 5 star restaurant on someone else’s dime and expect me to order light. All of the food was incredible.”
It didn’t take long, not with the way Dean was swallowing around him at every other bob of his head. Not with the way he let out random sounds showing his enjoyment. And not with the way his hands were fondling his balls like he was a master juggler. Castiel didn’t fall, more like he was thrown off the edge, orgasm ripped right out of his core. Dean had just taken his release, and cleaned him up afterwards with little kitten licks as if he was savoring a home cooked meal. It was obscene and messy and if he could come again he would’ve just from the look on the man’s face when he finished.
He turned on the tv and watched whatever show was on. Though his eyes were on it he didn’t pay it any attention. He didn’t pay anything attention at this point. He felt numb physically and mentally. That’s what he wanted all along. His phone continued to ring and he paid that no attention either. He was so lost in the void of himself that he almost didn’t hear the banging at his door.
Castiel had left the part out about him being his professor. He honestly didn’t know how his father would take that and he’d rather have the semester be over and not be in Dean’s class when his father found out what his boyfriend did for a living. The doorbell rang over the house cutting the tense silence. His Father rose from his place on the couch and got the food from the delivery man.
“Hell yeah Sammy. They did something to that pepperoni. It was better than I’ve ever had on a pizza.”
“Do I need to remind you that the only reason why you met Dean in the first place was due to me breaking into your spank bank?” Gabriel laughed.
“Fuck yes you would. Look so pretty with your eyes closed, head thrown back and body shivering. Are you close Dean.”
“He’d always say he liked my eyes every time I saw him.” he began. “My parents were pretty open with their affections with each other while I was growing up. They taught us that you showed the care you had for others in words as well as actions. One day as we were playing in the fields I took him behind a tree and kissed him. Neither of us knew what we were doing of course, but as we separated he told me I had the most magical lips in the world. Being that I was a child I had no idea what that meant since I never did magic with my lips.” He chuckled.
He kept a watchful eye on the clock while taking notes. Glancing around the room most of the students were either on their phones are obviously only paying half attention.
“Wow Cassie’s got himself a boyfriend.” Castiel whipped around to see Dick leaning on the side of the restaurant with a tall dark haired man leaning up against him.
“Listen Cas…I don’t” He sighed, “I don’t normally do this, but I need to know what’s happening here.” He scratched at the back of his head trying to grow some extra nerves to have a conversation that he was sure would go wrong.
For the next week Balthazar kept calling, Castiel ignored each one. The calls were so frequent that the number was entering the 3 digit range. He’d had Dean show him how to silence a contact in his phone, it was getting that bad. On one hand it was fairly annoying, but on the other it gave him a weird sense of satisfaction. He wanted Balthazar to feel bad about the situation he’d put him in. It wasn’t fair that he couldn’t see it, so on that 7
He was going to need a hell of a lot of it to deal with this night. Sam and him waded their way to the bar and plopped down on the only empty stools they could find. A very handsome bartender made his way towards them and took their orders. His eyes lingered on Dean more than Sam.
“Ugh you’re leaving me hanging. Suspense isn’t good for my weak heart. Well anyway I must take my leave. Milady is awaiting my arrival.” He could hear her smile through the phone.
Castiel couldn’t figure out what on earth his brother could be doing that so much noise was around him. Gabriel was the epitome of a free spirit, always doing something wild, dangerous, and probably illegal. Castiel glanced at his father who had his eyebrows raised and a slight smile on his face at the mention of his other son’s name.
Dean laughed as the memory of his Dad making the zombie apocalypse contraption. It was one of those rare times when his father was drunk off his ass but still pleasant, in the only way an ex-marine with alcoholism and being a single father can be pleasant.
“That’s awesome Cas. It smells real good in here.” He picked up his duffle. “I’m just gonna change first.”
He watched as Dean practically ripped the fabric off of him like it was on fire. He smiled down at where Castiel was now laying on his lap. Dean was truly beautiful looming over him like that. With his tanned skin and freckles everywhere, the black ink on his tight chest standing out against everything. His hand reached out on his own and sat on top of his peck where the tattoo was, dragging his hand down the flat planes of Dean’s front as he looked into lustful green eyes.
Castiel shot him a glare as well for egging this on. Though he and Dean agreed not to make their relationship public at school until the semester was over he still couldn’t take people talking about him lightly.
Castiel left the classroom with an award winning smile on his face. He was happy for the first time in awhile. He had a potential boyfriend and a great best friend. He’d gone dancing and had the time of his life. Things were finally looking up for him. He stepped out the building where the majority of his classes were to meet at Charlie’s car.
They hung out at the park for a few more hours until Castiel was visibly shivering. They were in the middle of October. The leaves turning colors heavily contrasting the grass that remained green, the whole scenery reminded him of Dean’s eyes. They walked back to his house in search of warmth. Once inside he went to the kitchen and put the kettle on to boil so he could make some tea. Dean stripped out of his coat and boots and sat patiently in the living room for Cas to return. In that time Cas found a perfect opportunity to really get a look at Dean. The plentiful freckles that sprinkled across his face, those soft lips that were always slightly parted when he was deep in thought, his strong and lean neck that went on for miles. No matter what position he was in his t-shirt showed off his beautiful, fit frame. His long legs that were strong and slightly bowed, Dean was simply a pleasure to look at. Cas thought he had struck some serious gold with this guy, thinking Dean was way out of his league.
“It’s friggin hilarious is what it is.” He wiped at his eyes, which were tearing up with all his laughter.
“I have eyes Castiel. You need not worry, he’s all yours. Just buy these please! I’m doing you a favor.”
The next time he comes to one of the guys he recognizes as holding his legs is rocking into him. His dick is inside of him and he’s pounding into him without a care in the world. Castiel feels exhausted. Like he ran a marathon through hell. His body has failed him at this point. He’s moaning and writhing despite him wanting to fade away and disappear.
In one swift movement he turned around and backed into Dean’s arms. His back against his chest, his ass grinding against him. So much for not getting hard. Dean thought. He moved with the irresistible creature in front of him, his arms snaked around him holding him even closer. He was lost in their movement. The music didn’t even matter anymore, the people around him seemed to disappear and he put his full attention on Cas. He was truly basking in the moment.
Clearly, he’d sped here frantically, trying to get to Castiel as quick as possible. On the way back, though, he took his time. He knew Dean would ask this, but he honestly didn’t want to talk about it anymore. just wanting the night to be over, but he wanted to be truthful with the man. He relayed what happened, how uncomfortable he’d been through the whole night, and ended with the near assault that transpired in the bathroom.
“None of that. Just tell me where to go and we’re good.” The look on his face, like this was the first time someone was kind to him struck a chord in Dean. Johnathan didn’t seem like a bad guy, so he couldn’t understand why people would treat him like he was the town leper.
“I see no issue with our date as it is Dean. I’m having a lovely time.” He smiled, pushing a pillow out of the way to sit at Dean’s side.
Once he was alone, he made a point to order additional minutes on the phone, and wouldn’t even admit to himself he’d done it all for Dean.
“I’ve heard of the character, but have never seen the movie. Is that a bad thing?” Cas smiled innocently knowing Dean was definitely going to complain about Cas’ lack of film knowledge. It wasn’t entirely his fault. His parents never really exposed him to things like this. He rarely went to the theater as a kid, and forget about going with friends. Studies always came first, especially when his mother was still alive. She was a rough woman and claimed all that she did she did out of love. She’d roll in her grave to find out her youngest son was gay. His father had always been more lenient and accepting of his children, more hands on and overall more loving. It was so engrained in him that even with the freedom he has now he doesn’t spend much time cultivating his small list of hobbies.
“Trust? You gave me a 5 minute threatening lecture on how to drive said car. Then you tried to blow while still threatening to “gank” me if I scratched her.” He used actual air quotes purposefully because he knew Dean hated them.
“Dean, what is this place you’ve brought me too?” he got out the car in a rush walking towards the double doors ahead of him.
He dug through the mud that was his memories and images were brought to his mind as be began to speak.
At the end of the day Dean was in his office as promised and he drove Castiel home. The ride was filled with a dense silence, unlike all the other times he found himself in the classic car. Despite himself he tried to keep his distance, tried not to pry. It was making him uncomfortable, he felt like he was shoved on the outside and only left to look at Dean through a set of bars that he put up. He didn’t like how that feeling sat within him, taking root in his heart. He was sure that it wasn’t supposed to be like this.
The silence Dean emitted for the rest of the morning hit Castiel’s soul. They ate breakfast that Dean cooked, the only sounds being the cutlery clattering against the white porcelain plates. They washed the dishes in that same threatening silence and Castiel felt his resolve crumble to pieces.
Castiel knew what he wanted, he wasn’t a naïve child. He was merely scared for what this could mean for his future. What he would be risking by actually staying here. Should have known when he set his eyes on the gorgeous man in the bar those several weeks ago, he was a goner since then. He’s risking a lot to be here, regardless of what that spirit told him. The more he gets to know Dean, and the wonderful people that surround him—they give his decision so much weight. Maybe this will all be worth it.
“Yeah well money talks louder than morals sunshine. From what I hear he’s been on his best behavior, but he hits me and my manager up constantly about getting a chance to film with me.”
“Hell yeah we could’ve tag teamed his ass. Me and Castiel have been eating our hearts out. He’s asleep now.”
Dean did exactly what he said he was going to do. Gabe was there within a half hour and Charlie was on her way to his apartment. He hadn’t told her what the real deal was, just that he needed her computer skills for something for Cas. He didn’t want her driving all emotional, and telling someone their best friend was kidnapped by their ex and being beaten, was something you did in person. God knows what else Castiel was enduring in the room with that psychopath, but Dean didn’t want to think about that. He had to keep his head on straight.
“While immediate relief would’ve been nice I wasn’t about to take advantage of you. I do have morals Dean.”
Suddenly he felt a pair of arms sneak around his waist and hug him from behind. These arms didn’t feel like Cas’ and Dean spun around quickly to find a stranger with a smirk on his face. Smug bastard looked way too satisfied for Dean’s taste. It didn’t help that the guy was wearing the deepest v-neck shirt that he’d ever seen. Smug guy looked him up and down like Dean was a damn buffet and he didn’t like it one bit. He swiped the guys hands off of his hips and took a step back, bumping into the bar and really didn’t have anywhere to go.
When all was said and done, everyone helped clean up and went on their merry way. He’d gotten pats on the back, hugs, and handshakes from everyone before Dean and he parted ways in the Impala. When they pulled up to his building Dean had stopped him with a hand on his forearm before he could get out the car.
“As you wish then.” Dean turned them around and began undoing Castiel’s pants. Once he got the belt undone he made slow work of the button and zipper enjoying watching Cas get impatient. Once he had them open he tugged them down to his ankles.
“They’re going.” Castiel chuckled nervously. “It’s not a problem. I’m comprehending the material it’s just a lot of work piled on a lot of work.”
He pumped it slow and steady, hips moving in perfect sync. Head thrown back, no doubt that eyes were closed. By the sweat sheen he could see from his spot, it was apparent Dean had been at this for a while. Was this on purpose? For Castiel’s viewing pleasure, to not be seen or heard and just to watch. If it was then he was enjoying it greatly, could feel his own arousal as he squirmed silently. It was getting difficult to not touch himself, so he pressed his full hand to the front of his pants as Dean’s hips and hand began to speed up.
John slowly approached Dean and gave him a one armed hug. Dean half-heartedly returned the gesture and made sure to pull back as soon as he made contact. John’s face slumped a bit at the lack of emotion Dean was showing.
“Dad it’s time to cut the shit.” Dean growled. “So fucking what I like men. You don’t like it then o damn well. It is what it is and it ain’t gonna change. You can either get over it and be the father you never been a day in your life, or leave me the hell alone.”
“Holy shit really?!” Dean was very surprised indeed. Bobby was a rough man, but he was a slow burn. He broke up way more fights than he got into. For him to punch Dad he must’ve had an extremely good reason to.
Dean had to be the single most romantic being on the planet. His originally plans had been to have a picnic under the stars with wine and a blanket to shield them from the subtle cold of a summer night. He’d made different finger foods for them to feed each other. It would’ve been a lovely evening, but when he’d come to Castiel’s door to pick him up and whisk him away it suddenly began to downpour. It gave Dean a lot of frustration since he’d checked the weather app on his phone all day long and it didn’t say anything about the sudden storm that was brewing outside. Castiel was trying to be optimistic and sent the man to get his goodies for the evening so they could do the same inside. They pushed the couch and coffee table aside, Castiel striding into the room with blankets and pillows to set up a nest of sorts so they could still have their picnic.
Dean rose from his chair and approached Castiel. He bent to and placed a kiss on his forehead, pullng his head back by his chin to place a kiss on his lips. He loved the hopeful look in his eyes. To say that his eyes were just blue was like saying that grass was just green. There was so much more to dwell on and take in. His eyes contained all of Dean’s hopes in dreams. Those eyes made Dean want to be a better and stronger man that he already was. The expression on Cas’ face alone filled Dean with such warmth he didn’t even need to touch him to feel the passion that Cas was giving off.
He unwrapped his arm from Cas and pulled him up to look him in the eye. The red ring was starting to fade, his eyes were going back to their distracting appearance and a slight smile was on his face.
Next on his list was to get very familiar with any public transport that was available. Every line, every form, he made a point to know. Escape was always the goal in mind. When he needed to go, there wasn’t time to wait 30 minutes for the next bus.
Back in the fire, Dean was getting into it now, his hips doing little circles as he turned up with vibration. Castiel zoomed in a bit to get a closer shot. He was hard as steel now and there was no getting away from that. Dean suddenly threw the little toy across the room in frustration before grabbing a bright blue dildo. He needed his other hand to apply a generous amount of lube on the toy. At this point Castiel had to try with every ounce of his being not to moan as he watched the man slowly insert the toy inside of him. He’d give up his life savings to be that neon colored piece of silicone.
He made his way to his bathroom and melted into the tub as the warm water hit his back from where he was now seated. He buried his head in his knees as his thoughts began to drift to his ex.
Dean took a quick glance where Mark sat in his high chair in between Sam and his father. He was looking at the two men with interest, as if he knew what they were talking about. Tapping his plastic baby spoon on the tray, Dean knew it was only a matter of time before he would throw a fit at not receiving any food. As if Ellen telepathically knew this she set a matching bowl of the mashed up version of their breakfast on his tray and he dove in immediately. Doing his best to scoop what he could on his spoon, more food ended up on the tray and back in the bowl than what made it into his mouth. Cute, Dean thought.
The tone of Dean’s voice alone rendered Castiel speechless, so instead of an answer he just moved. T-shirt off and the sweatpants quickly followed, Dean removed his own garments. Stunned, he took in the fact that Castiel wasn’t wearing any underwear.
Someone should have told him that his charge was so damned attractive. That was important information that seemed to be left out of his briefing. His family knew about his bisexuality, would’ve been nice to know that the man was at least a little bit attractive. He rolled his eyes at his own musings. Who was he kidding? Besides Charlie he was surrounded by a bunch of straight people who were accepting but also blind.
He kept repeating to himself. He felt his head start to swirl with pleasure as Dean took time taking all of him in his mouth. He pushed toxic thoughts aside and fell into the moment. He bucked up into Dean’s mouth and he had let him. He looked down at the hazy green eyes staring back at him and Dammit that was the hottest thing Castiel had ever seen. He felt his threatening orgasm descend upon him.
“Where’s my gift from you angel?” he asked placing a kiss on Cas’ cheek as he gawked at the iPad Ellen had gotten him.
Cas sit up like Dean and mimicked his previous motions, but unlike Cas, Dean dove straight in after the shirt was tossed away. Instead of his lips he went for his neck with the intention of leaving a few dark marks. Cas groaned and squirmed, holding Dean’s shoulders tightly.
They talked like that throughout their date. They ordered the same dish, Castiel couldn’t really decide on what he wanted. The conversation flowed easily between them, only taking breaks to take a bite of their food or a sip of their beers. Cas felt at such ease with Dean. Not that he didn’t feel comfortable with anyone else, but with Dean he didn’t need to be careful with his words. The man enjoyed his dry sarcasm and sassy remarks, and he loved Dean’s helpless flirting and plethora of innuendoes. It was simple and by the time dessert came Cas found himself overwhelmed by the sheer affection he had developed for the other man. Dean had been right. He never forced Cas into anything he wanted to do. If they glossed over a topic Cas wasn’t comfortable with Dean instantly picked up on it and swayed the conversation to a different direction all together. Things between them were wonderful and plain, and that’s exactly what Castiel had wanted.
Dean was spiraling, dangerously, and Sam knew that. They hadn’t found Cas in that warehouse. It hurt him to see his brother crumbling so slowly. After Dean had pocketed Cas’ phone he kicked over the table and hollered painfully loud. He started lashing out, picking up forgotten items on the factory and throwing them at the walls. He knew his brother was on a violent path and it was a dark road he never wanted to see Dean travel ever again. And if he did travel it he wouldn’t be doing it alone.
Castiel awoke the next morning bright and early. He stretched his arms out before opening his eyes expecting to be still wrapped in Dean’s embrace. What he found was he was perfectly tucked in the bed alone. He sat up wincing at the sunlight that washed through the curtains and crawled lazily out of bed. Opening the door to Dean’s bedroom smells of coffee and breakfast flooded his nose. He smiled softly to himself and walked slowly and silently into the kitchen. Dean had his back toward him humming a tune to himself and swaying his hips.
Dean was sending out all the signals that he needed to be alone right now. He shied away from all his tender touches and even Sam’s supportive hand on shoulder seemed to be too much for him right now. His coldness was very much understood after what just transpired, but it hurt nonetheless. He watched as Dean and his defeated shoulders and dead eyes walked away from them both.
He couldn’t resist asking about the computer since his run in with Gabriel. He didn’t mean to embarrass his poor boyfriend but he just had to know.
Not long after he was on the precipice of orgasm, Dean suddenly stopped. Pleads were on the tip of his tongue before he was instructed not to come until he said so. Sanity seemed so far away and he was beyond words at this point. Every nerve ending in his body screaming at him to disobey the order that was given so aggressively. He was pulled back hard until his face planted right into the inviting softness of a pillow that he didn’t know was there.
Dean laughed menacingly. This was getting ugly and Castiel felt utterly useless in way of stopping it. “Hate to disappoint, but you address him then you address me. He don’t wanna talk to you and that’s that.”
He was set on doing what he normally did every morning when he left the Inn, greet Mary and take her coffee order to get from the diner around the corner and bring it back to her before starting his day. She was a genuinely nice woman and he loved their small conversations, always light and bright that left him feeling better than he did when he woke up. What he didn’t anticipate was seeing Dean standing at the desk, leaning over it with a million-watt smile on his face talking to Mary.
His panic jump started Dean’s own inner storm. If Cas hadn’t shown up and now his father was calling around looking for him then maybe he wasn’t stood up after all. Get your thoughts right Winchester, Cas could be in trouble, he chastised himself.
Castiel found himself on a lone chair in the corner of the living room. Dick was nowhere to be found within the throng of high, and grinding bodies. He nursed his lone cup until he finally finished it. He debated for a while before going to get another one. When he went into the kitchen he found Dick in a huddle with his friends. He was quite high. One look at Castiel and he had him pinned against the counter sloppily kissing on his neck. Castiel pushed him off to look into his dilated eyes. He wanted to be disappointed, but he couldn’t deny that he expected this.
“I know I don’t deserve another chance, hell I’m not even asking for one. I’m just telling you that I’m trying. No promises, no lies.”
Dean awoke to the sleepy cat his boyfriend was. His arms and legs were wrapped tightly around his body like he was afraid Dean would disappear in the middle of the night. His morning wood was pressed tightly against his hip. His own was trapped under Cas’ strong runner’s thigh. As he tried to move out of the embrace said leg send a pang of arousal through him due to the friction. Any movement he made only made Cas hold him tighter and wasn’t helping his boner go down any time soon. He was rendered helpless. And honestly there wasn’t any other place on the planet he’d rather be. He laughed to himself at how sappy he’d become.
Well now Castiel knew that his brother was telling the truth. He, of course, wouldn’t share that information with his brother. The teasing that would happen afterwards was something he’d rather avoid.  Normally he'd feel awkward about that but there wasn't enough room in his brain for that. His focus was entirely on Dean and the possibilities of what this proposition could bring. He could really have fun with this.
“I don’t understand why you’re proud of me.” Cas had just finished rolling his blunt. He looked to Dean for permission and he answered by opening the window in the kitchen and motioning for him to do it in there.
They both crawled into bed and Cas snuggled up to Dean’s side with a hand on his bare chest. Dean silently thanked whatever strings were pulled to get him to the spot he was in now. He kissed the top of Cas’ head and snaked a hand around his back tracing little circles into the soft skin. They laid like that for a while before finally dozing off thanks to the silence between them.
Dean put the baby down to sleep, while he and Sam cracked open some beers and talked well into the night. Dean mostly grumbling about Cas and Sam trying to soothe his worry. Dean now had too many drinks to drive and stayed in Sam’s guest bedroom.
He wasn’t mad at Bobby for taking the man in. He was his brother after all. Dean would do the same and plenty more for Sammy, but he really wasn’t interested in seeing his dad when his mental health had finally been under control. It was far from perfect but it was manageable.
“Well this was more fun than a man with a 1 year old probably deserves. We should probably head out before Ellen tries to keep my kid hostage.” Sam got up and motioned for Dean to do the same.
*                             *                             *                                             *                             *
“Cas,” he sighed, “It will always be uncomfortable, but I think it’ll be better to have in out there. You put yourself out there for me some time ago so it’s only right that I do so.”
“I’d love to put on a show for you one day. Recreate this scene in your bedroom. You sitting at the edge just watching me go to town on myself.”
“You could’ve gotten me a pair of socks and they’d be the most beloved socks I own.” He chuckled, trying to lighten the heavy mood this was forming.
What he didn’t expect, however, was Dick Roman to have broken into his dorm room and having two other people standing at his side and a guy on his knees with a bag on his head in the middle of his room.
“Already to curl into me for the night?” Dean chuckled as his fingers scratched at the hair on the back of his head.
This dinner went much better than the last had. No more awkward questions, The Winchesters did their best to include him in all the conversation. Mary was correct, he did like the stir fry. It a mixture of vegetables and clumps of meat, it was well seasoned with a subtle spice in it. She even gave him some to take home. He decided that he liked Dean’s family, they were kind people, even John who was a little rough around the edges.
He hoped Dean wasn’t a club type of person, that would ruin all of this. He wanted both of their heads to be clear for whatever festivities took place after they left. Castiel had a tendency to make grave decisions when heavily intoxicated, and where Dean was concerned, he didn’t want to do that. The man was someone he had his sights on, having regrets would soil whatever they were right now.
He texted Dean throughout the days they couldn’t see each other and he found himself truly missing the other man. Now he was huddled over several open books and papers neatly organized for each subject and his phone in his hand. His neck was stiff from sitting in the same position for far too long, but he just continually tapped away on the screen and sipped from his coffee he actually took a break to make.
Castiel was either dead or trapped in some kind of nightmare. He opened his eyes to see a dirty concrete wall in front of him. He moved his legs to find they were tied to the chair he sat on. His arms were tied tightly to the back of it as well. His head was spinning with dizziness and his stomach felt empty. His mouth was dry and he couldn’t lick his dry lips due to the cloth tied around his head.
He scissored his fingers before leaning forward to push them even deeper inside the other man. His breathing got heavier and he began to rock back subtly on his digits.
Managing to get away from a woman telling him about how her and her husband met only for the relationship to fall apart because she’d fell in love with his sister. The divorce wasn’t going well and their family was falling apart. She was glad they hadn’t had kids yet, wouldn’t want to put kids through the nasty mess that was her life.
Awesome. A word that Dean only used for things he thoroughly enjoyed. He said Castiel had looked awesome. To anyone else it would just be a simple compliment but to him it was the compliment of a lifetime. No one’s ever told him he looked awesome before, and certainly not someone as attractive as Dean Winchester. He blushed at the statement and followed the man out to his shiny, freshly washed car. Dean rush to Castiel’s side and opened the door for him jutting a arm out signaling him to get in. it was a sweet gesture despite how unnecessary it was. Castiel slid in the seat as Dean got behind the wheel. He smiled at Castiel and placed a chaste kiss on his cheek. This caused him to blush deeper and try to hide it by gazing out of the window. They drove to the sounds of classic rock and no words between them. It was comforting not to be required to talk. He was sure they’d have more than enough of that at dinner. He enjoyed these moments with Dean just sitting and not speaking, nothing but the sounds of the car or music in the background. He loved just being with the man. Just being allowed to exist in his space. Of course he was far too introverted to share these thoughts with Dean. He’d rather show them through actions like gently sitting his hand on Dean’s thigh as he was doing now. Just a silent conveying of his emotions. Somehow Dean could always tell what Castiel wanted to say in these serene moments. Once they stopped at a red light he shot him one of his award winning grins. Dean had such a lovely smile, one that could crumble great empires, he loathed the times when that smile was missing.
They stared and shared air for awhile. Neither of them motioning towards the kiss that was bound to happen any second now.
“It’s about time someone’s kicked his ass for the stuff he does. I’m glad it was you. Him and his father need to know this family is not to be messed with. That reminds me, he tried to threaten me into taking that pharma deal.”
“Not yet baby. Don’t cum till I say so.” He stated firmly. “Love how only I get to see you like that. Being torn apart with pleasure.” Dean was just letting everything out at this point. He didn’t even notice he uttered the forbidden L word.  “Love how you’re so passionate with everything you do. Love how you just lose yourself in the stuff you enjoy.”
“Oh um alright. Well I’m glad you stopped by.” Dean wipes his hands on his jeans and walks with Castiel to the door.
“Don’t you start that shit with me John! I’ve always supported you! Even with the bad decisions you’ve made through life I still stood by you!” Bobby’s skin was turning read from the exertion of yelling. “But there’s always a time when shit goes too damn far. I wouldn’t stand behind and watch you ruin your sons!”
“Thanks so much.” He said side-eyeing the sandwich on a plate. “I’d hardly realized what time it was.”
Surprised. That’s the only way that he could describe how he was feeling right now. Not only did Lawrence have a nice, little Inn to stay in, he was lucky enough to find one that had a decent rate for extended stay. Everything he would need was in decent walking distance of the place he chose to stay. Hometown Inn. There was a little grocery store around the corner that had a pharmacy, a park a few blocks over, and the town’s library was a mile jog away. The weather was nice enough, winter had just broken here and spring was clawing its way in. This place was all too perfect, he’d hate to have to leave here.
“I really don’t wanna talk about it Cas.” He got from his desk and once again shoved his things in it getting ready to leave.
Castiel doesn’t want this. He’d rather be anywhere but where he is right now. A frigid mountain side filming goats, a depth of the ocean where he’d at risk for getting eaten by a shark, or getting stung by a jelly fish on the coast of Australia. Anything seemed like a better job than this one. As per usual he can’t find it in himself to say no to his brother. That’s how he found himself in some really expensive, rented out Villa…….
This chapter is hellaaaa late! My apologies. Work and life got in the way (aka me complaining about being a bridesmaid). But don't fret this is last weeks chapter and the chapter for this week will be up tomorrow then we'll be back to our regularly scheduled program. I'm also working on something epic for you guys! Of course it's another fic which should be up within the next month or so. Any way enough blabbing, there are no warnings for this chapter, just fluff. Hope you all enjoy and have a great week! xoxo (follow me on tumblr- fanofthephire)
Castiel spent the night with Dean, which then turned to the weekend with Dean. It was lovely and something that they both needed. It was Sunday night now and Castiel wanted to get some clothes and books that he would need for the following week. He’d text his father to let him know that he’d be coming home should he be there. Finals were rolling in soon and much or the last of the semester escaped him as he was so wrapped up in Dean. Of course he kept up with his work, but he still felt a little out of practice on some things, and would not tolerate it affecting his GPA. Dean drove him to the house and opted for staying outside since Castiel promised he would only be a few minutes. He noticed his father’s car outside along with one parked behind it that he didn’t quite recognize. Assuming it was one of his brother’s he didn’t think anything of it. That was until he walked into the living room to see Mr. Roman seated on his couch having a heated discussion with his father.
Like he wanted and half expected Cas got up and followed him. He opened the door to the house and almost stepped out until he felt a soft tug on the hem of his worn leather jacket. He turned to see a worried look on Cas’ face. He looked like he would never see Dean again. His frown was too evident and Dean leaned forward to kiss away.
On the counter was a tiny little gong, obviously in the place of a bell to get some service, he used the small stick to ring it. The thing was surprisingly loud for its size, the door that was the reading room opened revealing a short dark skinned woman with curly dark hair. A toothy white, welcoming smile was on her face as she walked towards the counter.
At Dean’s words his body locked up, erupting over the fingers gripping him tight. He looked down to see the mess he made, Dean letting out one final moan before he added to it. It was erotic, sensational, and everything in between. They slowly came down, trading soft kisses and equally soft touches. He broke away from Dean for a minute to grab him a tissue.
“I’m sorry I overstepped.” His gaze fell on where their hands were joined together between their chests.
Good Lord why does he have to be this adorable when he’s drunk. Dean slid out of the booth mourning the loss of the warm hand on his leg.
That stung Cas, Dean knew it. It only showed on his face for a moment but Dean instantly felt guilt because of it. Cas wasn’t the cause for any of this and he clearly was only trying to help. But Dean knew he couldn’t be helped. Not right now anyways.
“Please what?” Dean teased his vow low and volume and tone. “Gotta tell me what to do Cas. Doesn’t that get you going?”
“It was no problem at all. Come by and see me whenever.” He waved as Castiel shut the car door and retreated to his door.
“Alright guys what is all of this about?” he sighed. “Cause if Dad is joining us then I’m not coming.”
“That’s not how this works Dean. We’re family, which means no one gets to just get over things by themselves.”
Sam could hear the argument coming from the kitchen. He’d just gotten Dean calm enough to be able to join everyone else in the living room and almost like his normal self again considering the situation. The absolute last thing any of them needed right now was their father making his rounds and causing more trouble.
He slid down the bed some to be more on his back and Castiel had no choice but to get closer. Dean’s other hand flung out in search of the first toy. A little black bullet vibrator. With practiced precision he flicked it on and began rubbing it against his entrance all without looking away from the camera. Aside from the buzz of the device Dean’s heavy breathing was the only noise to be heard in the room. Castiel chanced a glance at his brother to see if he required some direction and the fucker was on his phone texting who knows who. Useless.
Dean shot him a thank you text, but was slightly confused about the part about Sam. He went to the bathroom and began his morning routine, a shower, teeth brushing, and deciding to skip the shave today. He left his bedroom to find his brother and nephew bundled up on his pull out couch. The scene was quite adorable as Sam had a protective arm thrown around the child, keeping him bundled up on top of his chest. Dean smiled softly, sheer affection pulling at the corners of his lips as he walked into the kitchen to reheat the food.
See the few places he’d stayed outside of shady motels were sublets, a month or two here and there, where an actual tenant was away. These places already had all of the things one would require for daily living. He’s never brought furniture or picked out dishes. These were typical adult things that he’d never needed to do. The desire was always there, to stay in one place to call home, but the means weren’t. in a town such as this, that had people like Dean, he could very well call this home.
He couldn’t accept that. It didn’t feel right to base the one relationship he actually wanted to go far, on a bunch of really big lies. It hurt, really did, that his own flesh and blood would just shoot him down like that without even hearing his side. Drinking the rest of his glass all in one go, Dean then pushed back from the table and walked out of the backdoor. He needed air and he got it for the remainder of the meeting.
Once Sam arrived he immediately pulled Dean into a tight embrace. Dean let himself be held if only to feel the comfort of another for a few seconds. He wouldn’t let himself fall apart like he needed to, but he would allow a glimmer of hope amidst his cloudy mind. They got ready and headed out to the Impala. Charlie in the back seat and Sam in shotgun right where he needed him.
“Cas,” he slid forward so their groins lined up perfectly, “You know it’s just a scene right? No reason to be jealous.”
“Well from what people say about you I just assumed you were like every other guy at school. As soon as they hear I’m gay they either beat me up or avoid me like the plague.”
“Violence won’t undo what he did to me.” he took a breathe to get his thoughts in order. “Do you think I should tell Dean?”
He turned to go and tossed Castiel a smile and a wave then left the class without a word. Dean rose from his desk and closed and locked the door. He returned with a serious frown on his face. Maybe this wouldn’t turn out how Castiel wanted it to.
Dean swiped some of the stray hairs away from Cas’ sweaty forehead and tucked him under the covers. He hated to see Cas in pain like this but he had to admit he did like the idea of taking care of him. Cas pushed himself up in a sitting position as Dean shoved the glass of water and aspirin into his hands. He smiled watching Cas drink the water like he hadn’t had the substance in 20 years.
Cas went on retelling Dean about what happened. Dean being the gentleman that he was waited until the end of the story to let loose his cackling. He laughed loud and outright until Cas began to squint and pout, which in turn, made him laugh even harder. When Cas reached out and gave him a swift punch to the shoulder, then, and only then did he stop laughing. He tried to hit back, but Cas was a little faster and dodged the playful hand swiping at him. This of course let to Dean tackling him to the bed and tickling him until he was begging him to stop.
He nodded, biting his bottom lip and not meeting Castiel’s eyes. The man was nervous and by all accounts he couldn’t blame him for it.
Kevin was not happy to have all these people in his room. Especially since 3 of them had loaded pistols and probably knew what to do with them. His room wasn’t big enough for all these bodies and all this tension. Cas was re-gagged and his hands remained tied around his back. He looked much more uncomfortable than Kevin felt, but he was a close second. Dick was pacing back and forth, as if there was enough room for such actions, on the phone with God knows who, trying to make arrangements for something. Kevin silently wished Dean would just bust through the door already.
“No one really did. Charlie knows, oh and Balthazar. Other than that no one from school knows. I’d appreciate it if, once this is all over, that you refrain from spreading this around. I wouldn’t want Dean to get in trouble for dating a student.”
Cas couldn’t help but let out a moan at this, which encouraged Dean to do more. He slicked up his fingers and slowly pressed one into the tight muscle while continuing to lick around it. He looked up at Cas’ face to make sure everything was still ok and found him red down to his chest and his lips hung open. He went back to tonguing at his entrance, finally moving the finger that was inside him. Once it felt loose enough and Cas began to move his hips searching for more Dean added a second and third finger to the mix. Cas was writhing at this point. All kinds of noises flying out of his mouth like a song written only for Dean.
Dean wanted to hit something. Destroy anything in his path, but the only thing in front of him and within reach was his brother. Sam was right about one thing, he was a far better man than his father. Perfect, of course not, but he would never be low enough to hitting his brother for his own personal release. It wasn’t right when John did it and it would be even worse for him to emulate that behavior. He opted for walking past Sam in search of another friendly bottle that he could pop open and redrown himself. Shoving through the cabinets above the stove, there were none. Searching through the fridge, he also drew back empty handed. He was almost sure he had at least one bottle left. He spun around racking his brain for where he could’ve possibly hit a bottle.
“After all that you had for dinner your starving?” he threw over his shoulder as he searched the refrigerator for food to cook.
“Then do us a favor and explain last night. Cause this ain’t gonna work if you’re keeping things in.”
He went on to getting two t-shirts he deemed acceptable and they went to another store where he found a green, blue, and black flannel that he knew the man would appreciate. Hopefully, these would overshadow the terrible piece of fabric. They went to a whole other store to get a gift bag and tissue paper. He didn’t understand the need for the paper, though Balthazar tried to explain it. Either way he now had a gift for Dean.
John pushed past Bobby and came walking into the living room only to met by several pairs of wondering eyes. He looked….better than he had the last time he’d seen him. His hair was groomed and his clothes were clean, they couldn’t smell a distillery with every move he made. His skin even looked better, full of that tan color that he use to have. He’d been supposedly in rehab since thanksgiving and that would be the longest time he’s ever stayed. But 3 months aint enough time for someone to turn around such a life as the one John Winchester led.
From then on Johnathan and Dean were pretty much inseparable. Dean took him home every day from school to avoid him getting bullied on the bus, they hung out on weekends, even Sam built a friendship with him. Most of the bullying stopped as word spread that he was taken under Dean’s wing. No one wanted to mess with someone who was close to Dean.
He woke up in an amazing mood the next morning. The light and airy feeling in his head from last night followed him into today. Getting out of bed, showered and dressed was a breeze, even the temperamental coffee machine was in a good mood. Mary declined his offer for coffee since Dean had dropped her off some
He opened his eyes. Not even remembering when he closed them and fell asleep, he looked up at Dean standing in front of him with a plate of steaming food. Never had a breakfast entrée of cheesy grits, eggs, and bacon looked so good. It smelled delectable and he gave his thanks before digging in. Dean sat next to him as they ate in silence. Some show he’d never seen before played in the background, but he paid it no mind, too busy thinking about what he needed to do before the day was over.
And with that he got into the passenger side and shut the door. Sagging into the comfortable, warm leather of the classic car was the most secure he’d felt all day. As Dean put the car in gear and drove off, Castiel watched Balthazar’s frozen form get smaller and darker in the rearview mirror until he was swallowed by the dark of night.
With that Castiel said his goodbyes and walked into his house, carrying out the rest of his plans for the day.
They remained on that dusty floor for who knows how long until he felt Dean’s shaking stop. He felt Dean’s arms snake around him and give a final squeeze before he pulled out of the embrace. His expression was one he hadn’t seen on his brother in a long time. A stone cold face of someone who’s given up. That was how Dean’s face had looked before that terrible night when he locked himself inside that bathroom and tried to take his own life. He wouldn’t let that happen again. He was better prepared for that now.
He turned, fumbling with the journal in one hand and his other purchases under his arm. Speed walking over to the register he dumped everything on the counter and was met with a smiling face from the dark brown-skinned girl behind the counter. She quirked an eyebrow at him and silently began to ring him up. When she was finished he paid quickly and left just the same to spare himself further embarrassment.
That giggle told Dean everything he needed to know. Was he turned on by Cas’ affection? Hell yeah, but he wasn’t gonna take advantage of a drunk person. Whether they were together or not. He helped Cas out of his pants and coaxed him into the bed then went to the kitchen. He filled up a glass of water from the tap and paused to calm down his aroused state of mind before returning to the room. When he opened the door he found Cas sprawled out on his bed knocked out. He sat the glass of water on the night stand on Cas’ side of the bed and found a packet of aspirin to place next to the glass should Cas wake up before him. He smiled at the trail of drool that was falling out of Cas’ mouth and making its way towards his pillow. Despite drool being disgusting somehow because it was Cas it was adorable.
Time slipped away from Dean as his recovery was slow and painful. He did everything the doctors had instructed, from taking medicine, to going to therapy, to physical therapy. He was on a cocktail of anti-depressants that made his head swim. Exhaustion wracked his body most days, and motivation to do anything besides eat and sleep was out the window.
Dean refused to meet his eyes. He knew he was being stubborn, and by the bitch face Sammy was throwing him it only confirmed as much. Everyone he cared about, including Cas’ people were all crowded into Bobby’s living room. Hopeful looks on all their faces. The person his Dad had spoken too was a Jody Mills, sheriff of a town not too far from them. She owed him a favor for who knows what and from what he told them she was more than willing to them get Cas back. Very few of them knew to what extent this situation was insanely dangerous. Dick was a ruthless psychopath and it boiled Dean’s blood when he let his mind wonder what Cas could be enduring right now.
“Because we’re at school. The classroom is one thing, but this is your office. Who knows who’ll be able to hear us.” He pushed back from Dean, but was still locked in his arms.
He approached the slightly ajar door and tapped it with a light knock so he didn’t startle the man who was staring intently at the papers scattered on his desk. He looked up and smiled slightly as Castiel made his way into the room.
He waited in the lobby for Dean and talked to Mary about his plans. Every one he talked to about this apartment was ecstatic about it. It was surprising that so many people (to him 3 was a lot of people) wanted him to have a solid place to stay.
It was small and cozy just as Mary described it. The living room had eggshell white walls and dark wooden floors throughout the apartment. The kitchen was on the smaller side but he was happy with it. A little island and the countertops were the same color as the walls, and the cabinets were in a slighter lighter wood than the floors. It already had the standard appliances which was incredibly nice. Whoever Missouri got to clean the place was a hygienic genius. The air was light and clean smelling, not a speck of dust to be found anywhere. The bathroom was probably his favorite room there. The clawfoot tub was on the larger side, an adjustable and detachable shower head, and there was ample amount of storage space. Overall, he was very happy about the apartment and couldn’t wait to move in.  He had decided what he wanted Dean and his next date to be. He wanted to invite the man over and cook dinner for him.
He’d just gotten back from France, proclaiming that he’d missed his friend dearly and that they needed to do something fun. Castiel had a totally different scene in his head at the word ‘fun’. It had been the first time Balthazar had been in his apartment and the first time someone outside of the Winchester clan had been there. Nervous and excited to share his space with his friend, he was happy at how pleased Balthazar seemed with the space.
Mark laughed along with his father as if he actually knew what was going on, and Dean had a heavy blush on his face. He was clearly embarrassed and this whole thing was spiraling way out of his comfort zone at this point. Dean sat Mark down on the floor and shot a disapproving look at his brother. Mark thought it would be a good idea to walk over to Castiel and hold his arms in the air, once again asking to be picked up. He hesitated for only a moment before he thought it was silly not to. It wasn’t his fault that things got awkward.
“I don’t like seeing people get hurt. Why were they beating on you?” Dean walked ahead a little fully intending on escorting the boy to the nurse’s office.
“So more patrons will be staying here.” He surmised. “I could see how that would be a lot for the staff.”
“Damn Cas you’re so good at that.” Dean rolled to his side and wrapped an arm around Cas’ back pulling him towards him. They laid there flush against each other staring in each other’s eyes, soft smiles on their red swollen lips. No words were needed and both men just enjoyed each other’s presence until sleep had chased them down.
See this was the dark side of his ability, strangers unloading on him the second their eyes met. His mother had warned him about this, just after his powers manifested. People would try to use him for evil, and this was why he was on the run. His mind wondered to those times as he was combing the coffee supplies the local grocery store had to offer. Even after all of these years there was still a rough-edged void within him from the loss of his family.
Dean wanted to hangout with Cas again. He really did but he had no idea how to go about it without letting his lewd side get the best of him. He and Cas had just began to form a friendship and he didn’t want to taint that it by thinking with the wrong head. He only sees the guy twice a week but they text constantly. Monday and Wednesday have become his favorite days of the week. Each of those mornings at 10 am he gets to see him for the hour and a half that the class is in session. Castiel sits front row center every time, his eyes following every one of Dean’s movements. It’s distracting but he also finds himself loving the staring. He even made a habit of licking his lips more often so he could enjoy the way Cas’ eyes got wider every time he did it.
Castiel read it at least 8 million times before it registered. Winky face? Had Dean really put a winky face? What the hell does that even mean? Castiel’s drain flashed to when they left his office and Dean had winked at him about the exam answers. His thoughts seem to attract another another part of his body. His dick swelling with blood and excitement at the thought of Dean winking seductively only for him. He tried to will it away hoping his erection would falter. He would not masturbate to filthy thoughts of his professor. That would just solidify the dangerous crush that formed the minute he laid eyes on the man. Not tonight. Not tomorrow night. Not ever. It took a while for Castiel to fall asleep that night.
Despite Dean’s better judgement he found himself in the kitchen with Ellen cooking Thanksgiving morning. He was nervous, it showed in his stiff movements and his tired expressions. He hardly did anything and was so drained. All the stress was weighing on him now.
“My point exactly. Not that I want Balthazar to go to jail either.” He chuckled sadly. “I just want tonight to be over.”
Everyone was stuffed to the brim with the food that Dean had cooked. Even Gabriel complimented Dean despite him trying to be tough and aloof. Dean knew Chuck was as hopeless as they come when they started off, but towards the end he did get a little better at it. He just didn’t want to do this again any time soon. He was stuffed himself, and the day wore him out. At the start of everyone eating he’d put on some hot chocolate, now that the food was over with, he grabbed the tray of mugs and brought it to the living room. They looked like a bunch of kids, all gathered around the beautifully lit white tree, ready to open exactly one present each. He was so excited to give Cas his present it was eating away at him. He’d gotten something generic for Chuck and Gabriel since he didn’t really know them very well and he thought it would be rude to just show up with nothing.
He pulled off wiping his wet lips with his arm and continued stroking Castiel’s thigh watching him gasp in his orgasm rush. Cas waited until his breathing slowed and his mind returned to him before speaking.
Dean clearly had other plans for this moment. All heat and passion behind each slide of their lips. It was sweet and warm at the same time. Castiel tried and failed to keep his composure. Against his will a breathy moan escaped his lips. Dean’s hands slid behind him and he was now gripping his ass pulling him forward, their crotches meeting together. This pulled a similar moan from Dean and Cas’ walls were tumbling down. He ground on top of Dean, his fully erect arousal searching for friction. This left Cas panting and wanting for more. He tried to push his brain to form words that he could communicate to his lover, but nothing seemed to flow right. Except for the broken whimpers that left his lips.
At that Dean laughed. It was a noise bathed in sarcasm and spite. Someone had shut the music off and it was the only noise to be heard in the room. Dean could see Ruby off in the corner of the kitchen bouncing little Mark in her arms, he was crying softly, startled by all the shouting.
They were played. Played by some bratty psychopath who thought Castiel was a possession he could buy and not a beautiful person that no one deserved.
“Red alert.” He plopped down in the plushy armchair that he brought specifically for his use in her office. “I met the guy.”
“I’ll do you one better.” Her face had hardened in a state of anger. “I’m gonna find where that bastard is holding Cas at. You got any coffee?”
“Oh but it did. It was a shit show the second we walked in. Girls everywhere I turned. It was nerve wrecking. I hadn’t even had my first kiss and here I am being offered alcohol and lap dances. Gabe thought it was the funniest thing he’d ever seen. I was mortified, all those older women and my raging teenage hormones.”
Castiel noticed the soft glance he shot his brother before he started to say, “It was no trouble at all. I did have fun with him. Though I’m not sure why he thought to refer to me as his Uncle. Not that I mind.”
Rising up on his knees to rip his shirt over his head, he hadn’t meant to put on a show, but the way Dean was looking at him he felt like he was on display. Normally attention this intense would cause him to shrink into himself, this was, however, glorious. Once naked he returned to his assault on Dean’s neck and shoulders.
The room he’d been given wasn’t at all fancy, but a complete contradiction to the usual places he stayed. It looked like he’d stepped into the bedroom of a cottage rather than a room at an inn. The walls were a dark, rich green to compliment the deep, shining brown of the wooden furniture. The coverings of the bed were a navy and tan, making the bed stand out. Castiel sat down his meager belongings and toed off his shoes before exploring the rest of the room. The bathroom didn’t smell like cigarette smoke like in other motels, even though he always got a non-smoking room. It smelled fresh and of light cleaning products. The tub and tile was in that same green, while the rest of the room matched the tan of the sheets. He wasn’t a stickler for décor by any means, that just wasn’t a luxury he could afford. He simply appreciated the feeling this room gave him. It was clean, warm, but not at all stuffy. Whoever did this room really knew how to make a man feel welcomed.
“She didn’t defend me either.” He said slapping some ground beef on a cutting board and gathered his seasonings.
“A nuisance is what it was.” He grabbed a couple beer bottles tossing one his brothers way before he decided on what to eat.
Dean sighed at the talk of his father. Though he harbored some strong negative feelings for the man for all that he’d done throughout his life he was still a bit saddened that he wouldn’t be there for Christmas. He still remembers the Christmas he’d turned 13 when his father gave him his first beer. It was not a good ideal at all to give someone that young alcohol, but he was certainly happy at the time. He recalls the giddy fuzzy feeling in his head after he finished the bottle. The old memory brings up a laugh within him.
His father was in prison? That was good news if he’d ever heard it. No one told him that his father was put away. He wondered for how long, so he could get his life together and keep him and his brother as far away from the man as possible.
Sliding out from under him, he barked for Castiel not to move. Move? He could hardly breathe so that wouldn’t be a problem. Dean moved behind him, mimicking his position, he could tell by the body heat rolling off the man in waves, but he didn’t touch him. He could hear the slickness of lube on skin, could feel Dean’s breathe on the back of his neck, and the last of contact was driving him mad.
“And I would, but not immediately. You aren’t ready for that yet. How are you touching yourself right now?”
Mid-terms were crawling up slowly and as the time grew closer the couple saw less and less of each other, for the next two weeks. Dean had to make all of his prep papers for his classes and Castiel had a heavy amount of studying to do. Charlie joined him through most of that time and insisted there was no reason for him to study that hard since he’d ace everything anyway. Though he agreed with her it wouldn’t hurt to be overly prepared for it.
Cas wriggled in his arms until he lifted his head and giving Dean the smallest smile he’d ever seen on the man. He strained his neck to kiss his boyfriend’s chapped lips. They might look dry, but they’re the softest pair of lips he’s ever had the pleasure to kiss. Sure Cas was hot and all, of course Dean wanted to ravage his body until he was a writhing mess, but the kisses they shared were far more important than any other physical contact they could share. Dean never thought such a careless gesture could mean so much, but the more he kissed Castiel the more it meant to him. When the hell had he become such a sap?! These thoughts never arose with any of his exes, even Lisa who he was 5 seconds from proposing to. Even though they were technically in the beginning of their relationship it felt so much older than it was.
John was the first to notice Dean standing in the open doorway and smiled shyly when their eyes met. He had to admit that his dad physically looked like he was getting better. He looked more like the Dad he knew before his mom died, granted his hair was a little more gray in some areas, but his skin held that healthy glow it use to. Maybe he was really trying to turn things around. Dean had no plans on forgiving him anytime soon, if ever, but the effort was noticed even thought he’d never admit it aloud.
Helloooooo all!!!! It's only been a week but I miss you guys! And because work has been ugly I have to post a day early again. I'm spoiling you guys, but you deserve for sticking with me trough this. Not may warnings for this chapter.....there's quite a bit going on. I decided to play around with povs other than Dean and Cas'. I hope you like it I tried to make it as clear as possible. As always and forever thank you for reading. I hope you enjoy!!!! comments and kudos welcome!! xoxo
Gabriel was a weird dude, but he was grateful for the awkward (borderline creepy) efforts he put in to make sure they met. Now he really wanted to see what he meant about Cas’ personal computer. Would he find a ton of his videos? That Cas had a gold membership to the studio website? Or did he not pay for his porn?
Like a bat out of hell he jetted out of that meeting room without another thought for anyone else. Normally he’d stick around, trying to be friendly with his new coworkers, but today was not that day. The headquarters of this magazine was about a half hour drive away from his home. That was way too long for his lack of patience right now, but he had no choice but to endeavor.
Hey! Bit of a late update cause of life. I recently moved. Yay! Here's a fairly long chapter to make up for my absence. Hope you enjoy! xoxo
The man was frustrating as well with all his flirting. Castiel knew that it was outside of Dean’s norm to be dating someone for this long and never having sex with them. He was glad for the man’s patience with him getting use to the idea of being that vulnerable in front of another person. But of course, that didn’t mean he was entirely innocent about it. Since that first time spending the night together Dean had slept over many more times after that. He often spent more time at Castiel’s apartment than his own house. He’d gotten comfortable too, opting to only sleep in his boxers instead of sleep clothes. Even going as far as cooking breakfast in the morning without bothering to get dressed. Castiel was getting daily views of how perfect and beautiful Dean’s form was. He got eyefuls of the man bent over or stretching to get something out of the cabinet. He was quite familiar, visually, with all the curves, dips, and sharp edges that made up his boyfriend’s body. Not to mention all the kissing and heavy touching they’d been doing. With all that aside Dean had made it very clear that if sex wasn’t on the table for them right now then he was perfectly happy to accept that.
“I’m not trying to hit on you again.”  He chuckled. “I’ve taken the hint. I just stumbled upon a lovely little café just outside of town that serves some well brewed teas and quaint pastries that are just to die for.”
From what Cas had shared of his sexual ventures it had been a while since anyone had entered him. The easiest way would be all fours, but he decided against it. He needed to see his face. They switched their positions with Cas laying on his back and Dean kneeling between a pair of strong legs. He pushed his knees towards his chest and motioned for Cas to hold them there. Castiel followed Dean’s direction, his mind hazy with possibilities of what Dean would do next. Dean reached over and grabbed the lube that sat on the night stand, which wasn’t surprising at all. But when Dean scooted further away from Cas and brought his face down to his entrance and now had his tongue swirling around it. This was very suprising indeed and felt intense. No one had ever done this before. It felt good to have a warm, wet tongue moving around down there, especially when it belonged to Dean. He had brought his hands up and began kneading into Cas’ butt cheeks pulling them apart while he kept up his motions.
“Yeah well I never even planned for you to meet him so I didn’t think to warn you about him.” Cas turned away at this and frowned. “Not cause of you. You know I’m not ashamed of this in anyway, but because of how he would react. I’m not particularly close with him, so he doesn’t get to meet someone like you.”
Dean studied his face. Looking for any negative reaction. Anything he could turn into an escape route from those concerning eyes. When he found nothing but real compassion he didn’t know what to make of it. It stuck him right in the middle of his chest and he let the feeling resonate throughout his body. In all honesty he made a habit of doubting his partners level of compassion and genuine care. What his father did to him really messed him up when it came to love. He just couldn’t shake the thought that he wasn’t actually loveable.
Castiel didn’t want to but he listened to Dean. He kept up his efforts until his lips were swollen and tired. He pulled off and stood up immediately crashing their mouths together. He turned them so Dean’s back was facing the bed and he roughly pushed him down on it. Dean used his hands to lift himself up scooting back so he sat in the center of the mattress. Cas wasn’t far behind him crawling up Dean’s body on all fours leaving tender kisses and bites as he did. When he reached his destination of Dean’s lips he kissed him for a bit before Dean turned his head stopping everything.
The pounding resumed with a hard grip on his hips and Castiel let Dean take what he needed and concentrated on keeping a hold on what little control he had. He didn’t leave him waiting because he finished soon after. He was a little upset that he didn’t get to see Dean’s face in that moment as he reached his finish, but the feeling of him bowing over his back and embracing him was enough to tide him over.
“Don't lie to me Cas.” He said firmly. “ain't a lot that'll put me off, but lying is one of them. Now tell me what you’re thinking about.”
“If you wanted to get laid tonight all you had to do was say so.” The man laughed as he dug into the pie head first.
Through their time together he’d learned so much about the world he was living in, but never really participated in. Dean had shown him the wonders of movies and tv shows, the beauty in diner eating, and the niceties of living in a small town that’s actually friendly. He’d learned about his self too. Things like what he preferred on his burger, that he really wanted a pet now that he had a solid place to live, and the fact that he really wanted to be in a stable relationship and surrounded by loving and supportive people.
The video expanded to the entirety of his screen. It faded in from black to a pink haired man lounging around in a very nice living room, a knock sounded at the front door and he went to answer it. The man on the other side was built much like Dean, though his eyes were gray instead of the stunning green that Dean’s were. They exchanged greeting and hugs then pink hair led them to a bedroom. He’d instructed the fake Dean to take his shirt and pants off and lie on the bed faced down. From there he massaged his back with some kind of oil before moving down to his legs. Once he was finished with the massage he crawled back up the man’s body and laid himself on top of his back, leaning in to kiss him. They kissed for quite a while before he moved away, tugging the man’s under wear down and pulling it to his ankles and leaving it there. Slowly he parted the man’s cheeks, rubbing the oil into them before he dove in with his mouth and began kissing and licking at his entrance. The fake Dean didn’t seem surprised by this and immediately responded with noises rivaling the loud sucking and slurping of the pink haired man. They both appeared to be enjoying themselves a great deal, a chorus of pleasure heavy noises filling that room. Castiel felt his own arousal spiking at the vision in front of him. Feeling inspired by these men he pulled himself out of his pants and began to stroke himself. It’d been so long since he touched himself to some form of pornography. The noises were getting louder and fake Dean was now rutting up against the bed, taken over by the throes of passion. Pink hair pulled back and with him he pulled up the other mans hips so that he was on full display, the camera zoomed in on the sight before panning out to pink hair returning to his mission. Both men stroked themselves, cursing and groaning alike, Castiel was close now, never having seen something so outlandish yet entirely pleasing. Pink hair finished first, and when fake Dean finished, Castiel imagined that it was the actual Dean and he was pink hair, it drove him to the edge and he tumbled off.
Kevin was grateful when all the invaders left his room and he was left alone with Castiel. He needed to find out what the hell was going on and he needed to know now. Like right fucking now. He could feel a bout of panic rising in his chest but he squashed it as quick as it formed. He needed to help his friend, and he couldn’t do that if he was freaking out. He helped the man onto his bed and he was eternally thankful that he didn’t have a roommate this year, imagining explaining to some strange person why he has someone bloody and tied up, probably starving, in their room. He knew it would only be a short time before Dick and his goons returned so he gingerly took the tie from around Castiel’s mouth to get the answers he deserved.
“Then it’s settled. Bye Dean. Bye babe.” She placed a peck on Cas’ cheek and bounced away to her car.
When they were all strapped and ready to go, the teams fanned out across the campus all shooting in different directions. Dean knew the campus pretty well, so he lead Sam and the officer, Garth, towards Kevin’s building.
Castiel looked to Dean with a nervous glance. He had no idea they’d be going somewhere that required reservations.
Stopping by here actually hadn’t been his intention at all, but who was he to question where the universe took him. There were always bigger things afoot, one of his father’s lessons that stuck with him through all these years.
“Yeah in like a 'holy hell he’s drop dead sexy' kind of intense. She’s more on the ‘please put this girl to sleep’ kind of intense at first, but once you get use to her you’ll be really happy she’s in your life.”
“I’m sorry Dean I shouldn’t even have mentioned it.” He repented approaching the man and wrapping him in a tight embrace.
Now he was coming to dinner at his parents’ house. He needed to meet up with his best friend before tonight.
“No Dean absolutely not!” he shouted. “Listen I know you’re a grown man and you can handle yourself. Believe me I know first hand, but I don’t want to see him trying to tear you down again.”
Dean had been right; he couldn’t say no to this woman. Not when she looked so hopeful of his acceptance. He’d just have to try his best to get through this.
Dean pulled him to lay on his chest, hands curling within the strands of his hair. “Just you wait till it’s your turn.”
Finishing the shower and getting dressed for class he decided to text Cas. He felt a little guilty using the guy in one of his morning fantasies. He wasn’t even sure if the guy was attracted to him. Nonetheless it had happened and Dean decided to shrug it off. He was out the door and on his way to get coffee when he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket.
“You need to. For you not for him. He knows he’s welcome, but that invitation comes with conditions. Ones he’s well aware of.”
Dean let out a sound that was half a growl, and a loose interpretation of his name. An idea dawned on him suddenly and he went with it instantly. With his free hand he kneaded one of Dean’s cheeks and then drew back, bringing his hand right back with a slap that cracked a little harder than he thought it would. Dean cried out, and he almost apologized profusely before the man began to speak.
A blush formed on the man’s cheeks and wandered its way down his neck. Dean pulled away as he noticed two other men walking into the room. They were both pretty short but the one who was shorter looked older and appeared to be Castiel’s dad. They had the same bright eyes that swallowed up your soul. He spoke first.
He followed Dean inside and observed as he talked to the host about their reservation and were soon led to a booth in the corner. From his seat he could see the whole place. The building was split in half. Restaurant on one side and bookstore on the other. They even had a coffee bar on the book side. Tables where people were setup with laptops and chatting with friends. Even with the food side the overall volume of the place wasn’t very loud. He could see himself coming here often.
As if his brother could sense his distress, he clapped his hands and announced that they would be starting. Castiel was ready and was finally rid of the young talkative man. His instruction began with telling the young man to go outside and then walk in the room say his lines and go from there. Castiel, himself wasn’t privy to much of the script, just that he had to follow them around as steady and quiet. That’s what he was concentrating on, or at least trying to at this point.
Dean reached over and grabbed the vibrating device that he was doing his best to ignore. One look at the screen and his whole fuzzy mood was destroyed. His father was calling. Knots began to form in his stomach and if Cas wasn’t practically on top of him right now he would began to have a full blown panic attack. He felt his heart start to race and with that his breathing quickened. He gave Cas a quick kiss in hopes that it would calm him down. His dad has been calling him for weeks. He wants to escape the inevitable, but he knows he can’t avoid the man forever. Bobby and Ellen will hunt him down eventually if he stays MIA. Reluctantly he picked up the call, putting the phone to his ear and not saying a word.
Now Castiel’s face was burning red. He liked how being wanted by Dean felt. Arousal replaced his excitement. Though they were in public the direction of this conversation wasn’t as daunting as it would feel with anyone else. He leaned over the table propping his chin on his hands while his elbows sat on the surface.
“Intimately….i’m not ready to take it as far as you want to. I just want you to be aware of that, and if that’s not something you’re ok with or you’d rather not wait then I totally understand that. I’m just….not really over the…trauma…and I don’t want to put you in a position that you don’t want to be in.”
“You aren’t old, and this is getting weird.” He pushed himself off the counter. “I’m gonna head to work. Get your head out of the gutter.”
Before Cas lost his mind or Dean could continue the waiter showed up with their food. Castiel sat back in his seat and began shoveling food in his mouth. Dean sat back with a devious grin on his lips. He was clearly pleased with himself. Dean ate much slower than Cas. Making a show of wrapping his lips around the fork with each bit he took. After a while of that Cas was painfully hard in his dress pants. They weren’t exactly made for times like this and he had to keep shifting in his seat trying to sit comfortably.
John flashed his eyes over to Dean peering at the expression on his face. That was the last straw for him. He couldn’t do this anymore. He’d avoid any questioning in his direction as if his life depended on it. He’d rather die than be part of this conversation any longer. He pushed his chair back from the table with his head handing in between his shoulders. He muttered thanks for dinner to Ellen and half ran out of the house. As he walked through the threshold he heard another chair move and someone stalking after him. He knew it had to be Sam, but he really didn’t want anyone coming after him right now.
Castiel on the other hand was wracked with anxiety. He paced around his room trying to figure out what to wear, and what to do. He had no clue what Dean’s family would be like. Sure they accepted his sexuality, but what if they didn’t like Cas himself? What if he came off as rude cause he was quiet? What if they hated how awkward he was?
Dean’s rising bad attitude was wiped away with mention of his favorite redhead. He followed the mysterious v-neck man to get their host. They snaked through half naked bodies in stereotypical Halloween costumes. Some got grabby and Dean had to evade a lot of inappropriate touches. They finally got to a room in the back. It appeared to be the employee break room.
He began eating and tried his hardest to avoid Cas’ concerned looks. He wasn’t ready to talk about all of that yet. The wounds that were still scabbing over in his head were threatening to burst if he ever saw his father again. Cas was great, but this was deep. Cas had his own secrets that he wasn’t ready to share with Dean, and he was fine with that. They were still practically strangers despite the fact that they were now together. Time always tells, a saying that Dean held to be the truest truth he knew.
His heart clenched and his hands shook, but he meant every word. John was harsh, and how he treated his sons couldn’t be considered parenting. He was more of an abusive, occasional babysitter than anything that could be considered a father. He wasn’t always like that though, this all came about when their mother died in a house fire all those years ago. It was the worse time in Dean’s life. He was only 4 years old, holding little Sammy in his arms outside the house, only wearing his pajamas in the middle of winter while they watched it burn to the ground. For years the smell, and the brightness of the fire haunted him. He could barely go to a cookout without having a panic attack for so long. Even now he’d have a nightmare about that night. The hot and cold of it all, a shocking contrast he wished to never experience again. Looking back that was the one and only time he had seen his father cry. One of the only times he’d seen him express emotion without the help of alcohol.
“I didn’t mean too actually. But I guess I got carried away.” He spoke reaching in his back seat to take out yet another bag.
“If that’s alright with all of y’all? I mean we haven’t been dating that long, but I do really like her.”
So it seems they were talking about this. And of course it was once again Dean to bring up the serious stuff.
No one spoke for a good while, just the happy hums of eating and silverware scratching against ceramic plates. Castiel actually really enjoyed the food he was given, everything bursting with flavor like it had whenever Dean cooked for the two of them. He’s never been into food as much as his boyfriend is, but he found himself making the sounds just as much as everyone else. When the plates were clean and those who wanted seconds got them Ellen decided to speak.
“Yeah I mean it’s not like there’s a monster age gap between us. Castiel might be in your class, but you guys are both adult enough to keep your academic life separate.”
“What if he has changed Sam?” Dean was surprised by his own optimism. He really did want his Dad to get better. He was the only parent they had left of course other than Bobby.
