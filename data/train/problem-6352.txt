Tony turned to look at Péter, shocked to hear him speak but not at all surprised to find that he was also looking back at the disbanding group of boys, his face expressionless.
Tony closed his eyes, biting his lip to stave off the sudden urge to sob. Quiet. They needed to be quiet. No one must hear them.
At the sound of the curse Maria gasped in shock behind Natacha, leaning around her sister to stare at Tony with wide eyes.
Bruce.
Steve was fortunate to have missed dinner. He had no doubt that if there had been anything in his stomach it would have come back up again, but as it was his gut just twisted painfully around nothing.
“I’ll be along,” Steve replied clipped and dismissive.
Bucky kind of wanted to box the kids ears but he did his best to stifle the urge. It helped remembering that Péter had been served up his fair share of Stefen’s particular brand of bullshit, and even if
He was saying something low and clam, holding out his hand but Bucky couldn’t hear a word of it over the howling in his head. It was amazing, how even in that din he could still hear the subtle
“Did she really?” Tony asked, curious despite himself. It seemed an odd choice of literature for a first-time reader. It wasn’t exactly light material.
Steve was spending his waking hours split between the visits and meetings that Schmidt had organized in the wake of the critical response pouring in from abroad after the mass deportation of the Polish Jews. He was also trying his best to discreetly gather information in order to discern what might be coming in the future.
He’d not hoped for too much, but he’d never expected this short dismissive little letter begging him to play nice with Nazis. It felt like a blow, though he felt silly for even acknowledging the strange feeling of disappointment in his chest.
“I’m not a soldier
“Are you alright?” Péter, whose hands had darted out to steady his cup of juice, was looking at Bucky like he’d just declared himself the queen of England.
.” Tony pointed out succinctly, with bite. Steve stiffened his back, bracing for the argument ahead. There would be no bending this time. The note from Holmes at SIS had been very blunt. Britain would not risk helping them, unless Steve committed to their mission in the defense of Norway. There was no point in waiting for Kirk any longer because they’d learned in an earlier letter from Jann that he’d been conscripted for the navy. He’d be with the fleet heading to battle in Norwegian waters.  This was their only way out. Tony just didn’t see it yet.
“What does he want?” Tony asked. He didn’t feel like mincing words. His stomach was grumbling horribly and he could tell by the light filtering in from above that breakfast was long over. Given that he’d missed supper as a part of his punishment and he was likely to go without
“Who do you think taught me that move?” he asked, offering Bucky a hand to help pull him to his feet.
Tony hesitated for a moment but figured there was no harm in telling Péter the truth.
“I’m sorry we frightened you,” Tony spoke to the girl first in Italian, but when she just stared blankly at him, he switched to the Czech she’d been singing in. Steve grit his teeth. Tony said ‘
Stefen swallowed past the tightness in his throat and clenched his hands. He was the worst sort of hypocrite, but he needed to say this.
No, they don't exist anymore
He leaned back against the door and slid to the cool floor. The sound of his bottom thudding softly against the hard floor seemed louder within the room as the sound bounced off against the walls. He drew one knee up toward his chin in order to rest his head upon it and sighed. His eyes roved over the dark shadows within the room, tables, machinery, and the body of the mostly completed engine were all just grey shapes within the darkness. The room was cold and still, and Tony sat there in the dark breathing shallowly as the weight of his own fears bore down on him.
“Still. It’d be easier if she was here. If things go to shit, it’d be easier for the children.”
Shifting again he thought miserably that his collar was too tight. His dress uniform was stiff, and pressed to within an inch of its life. God, but he hated having to dress up and play these games. He wasn’t any good at them. He wouldn’t do it, he decided with a fit of ill temper. There was nothing he could do to change the past and his family’s future was all that mattered now. There was no way forward but to be honest with Charlotte.
Maria leaned forward in her chair and tugged at his sleeve.
“And others, particularly those from the south, sadly are muddled and mixed with any number of unfortunate bloodlines, even negros.” She lowered her voice as if she were sharing with him some tantalizing bit of gossip, and Tony fought the urge to knock her out of his way as he got up from the bench and took his bows as the audience politely clapped.
“Are you?” Steve snapped, turning toward Tony, already focused on the mission at hand which was finding his daughter. “Do you know what they’re talking about?” Tony nodded.
"Because you know what's good for you," Tony murmured leaning over to press his mouth softly against Steve's, a whisper of a kiss.  “And because I’ve asked Bucky to take over your exercises and somehow, I doubt he’s as soft a touch as I am.”
“When is it the rule in Germany to execute without trial?! You can’t treat people-”
"The police will be looking for us, won't they?” Ian asked, shifting on the seat next to James and poking him with his elbow. “What if someone recognizes our names and they turn us in?"
The children filed in behind him, their heads swiveling round to take in the small space that was going to be home for the unforeseeable future. It was a far cry from the villa, but it was empty, and they were safe.
“You’re so damn preoccupied in here!” he accused, jabbing with one finger. “Meanwhile my son is –”
"The whole city smells like smoke." Bucky grunted in answer and Natacha flinched. Bucky swiveled his hand to grasp her wrist, gentle but firm.
“Is there any other choice?” Tony stared hard at him, rising from the old chair his grandfather sat in every night after supper to rest old bones and tell the children stories. “Your English is serviceable, but you don’t speak French. What would you do if something went wrong on the way to Dunkirk?”
Tony had never slept well when the family traveled, and no matter how sweetly his mother had sung to him or how sternly his father had demanded that he grow up, he had never been able to force his mind or his fears to quiet. It was as if his bones knew the shape and feel of his own bed, his skin the sweet airs of home, and every sense he had seemed to long for them.
Good. Jesus Christ if they’d been found out…
“But there’s no hole in the roof!”
“You were always the one to bite the hand that fed you. Like a little rat.” The general crossed his legs, one booted heel over the other with a sharp clink.
“My only wish is to continue the command I've been appointed. My battalion needs me. I won’t leave an entire battalion on Major Dvořák’s shoulder.
Péter stared down at his plate, shoulders tight, looking angrier than he’d been before. He looked on the verge of saying something but he bit his tongue.
Bile climbing his throat he crawled back into bed.
Shuddering Tony scrambled to his feet, muttering useless apologies as he backed away from the pair all but fleeing from their space and then from the attic room altogether. The door slammed behind him and he fell back against it, the strength suddenly leaving his legs.
"His Highness the prince of Norway would like an audience. A private one if you catch my drift."
It had been the son, Franz Hofeiter who had informed the authorities of his sister’s activities. He’d made some sort of deal with the SS. When Schmidt had come, they’d only arrested Herr Hofeiter and his wife and later the daughter when she’d turned up. The traitor and the failures who’d raised her. They’d left Franz and the youngest girl.
He wasn’t far from the attic stairs when he first heard it. A faint creaking followed by a small thump, not unlike a book falling or a heavy footfall, but it gave Tony pause in the dimly lit hallway, the light from his lamp making his shadow long upon the wall.
She didn't say it, but they all heard the warning: or else. Péter was too stunned to think of anything to say, too shocked to move even, but beside him on the bench Natacha raised her arm and gave the BDM leader the salute.
He wanted to see Tony even though it was the last thing he should want. But then again he wanted a lot of things. He wanted to hold himself up in his office and sleep for years. He wanted so many things that were out of reach. He shook his head and forced a smile on his face.
“Plans change Captain. We got a credible tip that the Germans have been mobilizing since February.” Carol replied, her grip tightening on the wheel in her frustration. “The brass is worried the Germans are about to beat us to the punch, but there’s still a chance to save Odinburg and his parliament if we send a small team. The HMS Avenger is leaving with a detachment from Scapa Flow in less than a week for a mining mission in the Vestfjorden. Your team is on it and you have to get there with enough time to prepare. Lucky for you I’m a damned good pilot.”
It drove the air out of his lungs, and he gasped like a fish. Still he tried to rear up again only to have his fist caught and pinned above his head. Schmidt’s laughter filled his head. His hands gripped Steve’s face broke his bones and ripped at his hair. Steve fought. He twisted and kicked and screamed, his throat ripping raw around the sound, but the man above him was immovable.
Hortense had ducked inside, presumably to spread the word, and as Bucky crossed the threshold, the warmth from the ovens washing over him like the touch of an angel she reappeared from the pantry with Willamina in tow. Another smile cracked Bucky’s stiff face as the large woman sucked in a hard breath and wrapped him up in a fierce hug.
“Not bad for my first explosive, was it?” Tony grinned in answer.
The commotion drew Charlotte and Pepper who appeared in the doorway of the captain’s room and immediately broke into shocked cries of their own; but Tony’s attention had been captured by the hot air pushing against his face as it rushed into the cooler hall. His brain stuck on the startling discovery of Bucky, the housekeeper, and Stefen’s fiancé all gathered within the captain’s room, where a roaring fire filled the fireplace, and the drapes had been drawn tight across the windows to create a cocoon of heat.
music for Christ’s sake!
“I’m a fair mechanic.” Tony said over the stunned silence, the Italian slipping easily over his tongue.  “I pride myself on being able to take things apart and put them back together. Don’t look so surprised.”
"Maybe. But you're not too old to do what you want." He insisted. "The things in your journal, you could still do them someday."
He could see that now. Steve had lost weight and even though it was clear he’d been out in the sun his skin, which had always favored his gaja fathers, was an unhealthy shade of pale. In Vienna Bucky had thought when the bruising faded his skin would return to normal. Instead Steve looked...ill. Just ill. Almost the way he’d looked as a little boy.
“Rather die… eaten by pigs. Free me or kill me. I won't go back.” Steve’s voice petered out completely like a dying automobile, but he held the woman’s gaze.
But instead of finding breakfast under way he and James found the others crowded in the smaller sitting room, bright bubbling voices carrying out into the hall helping the two confused stragglers locate them when they found breakfast abandoned at the table.
~*~*~*~
Wide brown eyes searched his.
Now Charlotte's mention of them made father pause for a fraction of a moment, his body going taut with tension as his eyes flickered toward the door where they were all standing in the hall and his gaze caught Natacha's. She'd been wrong she realized as he stared back at her blankly. He hadn't forgotten they were there. He’d never seen them at all, and she had the terrible feeling that even though he was looking right at her, somehow, he still couldn't see her.
Like Stefen.
Perhaps he should get an early breakfast prepared and brought up to Tony?
Tony took a seat at an empty table, near the boy and his grandmother and signaled for the host when he’d settled to order a coffee. He was content at first to open one of the books he’d brought for just this sort of lull in activity, but he found it difficult to keep his attention on the pages. His thoughts strayed often back to the Villa, wondering on the children and how Pepper was faring with them. Wondering on Peter and how the first few weeks of term were going, and of course, there was the counting down of minutes he couldn’t seem to deter. His agile mind keeping track of the passing of minutes like the most steadfast of clocks, all of it winding down to when the train would reach the station in Berlin and he would find Stefen waiting for him there.
She didn't say anything, just watched him approach with the same detached expression most children of the Wehrmacht saved for men in uniform. It was surprising in a servant and civilian. Dvorak was used to the uniform's ability to intimidate.
She darted out of the shadows toward the doors of the businesses, spreading leaflets as she went and Péter followed, dropping his trunk at the side of the nearest shop to retrieve the paint brush.  He made quick work of the first two buildings mindful of the time when the next patrol was likely to be around but when they reached the flower shop the poster on the door made him pause.
~*~*~*~
It wasn’t public knowledge yet of course, but the Wehrmacht had plans to send him to the research facility at Dachau while they slowly unveiled the details of the investigation to the common people. A slow but necessary rebranding. A worse fate for any man Deiter could not imagine, then to be under the knives of the researches at Dachau, but at least it would not be very long. When they were done poking him full of holes, they’d execute him, not quietly but for the whole world to see. And the people would cheer. Or so they hoped.
Pepper looked up from where she was rolling numerous pairs of socks into tight little balls, her expression about as grim as the colorless sky outside the window.
She bid him to be careful and he told her to do the same. Brave woman that she was, Bucky doubted she’d keep out of trouble any better than he did. He’d set out that same night for Erlangen, a village just four miles to the west.
Two days was not nearly long enough to show someone the depth of love a human heart could hold for them.
“Nonna, listen to me.” his voice cracked. “You have to leave Pola. It's not- you and Nonno have to leave. It's not safe anymore. Do you understand?”
That’s another thing the movie left out. They bickered constantly. I used to think they’d go to their graves that way, shoulder to shoulder arguing about who said what and which of them was right about this or that. Like a ridiculous old couple. That was how I knew my father loved him. You can only be that ridiculous over someone you truly care about.
~*~~*~
“It’s light out. I should go.” He ventured but Stefen’s grip stayed firm.
“Your father set aside exactly Five-hundred thousand marks at the bank of Berlin, which was to be metered out in donations to St. Péter’s Abbey for every year that you remained in residence and given to your mother’s kin should you die an untimely death.”
“What are you doing?”
“And a plate of Vati’s schnitzel. I know what you like James.” Leaning close to his ear while she plucked the menu out of his hand, the curve of one breast brushing against his shoulder, she said on a low breath, “And I’m just fine with it.”
“Let me in?” He asked, weariness pitching his voice lower.
Pietro rocked his sister for a moment more before his eyes met Tony's again. In them was resignation, heavy with the knowledge of something old and terrible, but brittle with defiance as he held onto his sister and muttered promises he had no certain way of keeping.
But now he was. Just like everybody else.
Tony needed to know if his grandparents were still alive, and if not what had happened to them. The events that had thrust Tony into the monastery had allowed him no chance to say goodbye and all of his letters to them had been returned unopened. He’d asked Obadiah to look into it for him, worrying that Nanno and Uncle Isiah had been hurt in the riot that had killed his parents. Stanislov’s response that neither men had reported to the Yard since the end of the riots and their house had been put up for sale had sent his seventeen-year-old self into a tailspin of depression.
“Uh, Stevie, I’ve almost never had sex the same way with each person. The positions may be the same but there’s always something different. Like with missionary, some of them liked me to roll my hips, slow grinding softly into them while some liked for me to nearly break their hips fucking them hard through the mattress. You can break those categories up into people that liked to be talked dirty to and the ones that liked to hear affectionate stuff instead, then break those down even further with other stuff. I’m not even sure where to start telling you what may work because I’m not sure what Tony would or has gotten off on you doing.”
Bucky had kept his promise to Tony that night, never increasing his tempo and lazily plunging into Tony. He edged Tony the entire time, bringing him to the brink of release before dialing back. Tony was a ball of shivers down overstimulated nerve ending by the time Bucky let him come, morning light shining in the room.
“He’s over there, you’re right here, and I’m pissed off now.” Tony whispered back as Steve sat a plate of food in front of him. Placing a cup of coffee down as well, he sat beside Tony pulling his chair close.
He amended that statement to majorly overboard when Clint nearly fell to the floor laughing when Tony walked into the room. They were going out to meet Darcy and Jane along with Thor at the bar they frequented that night. It looked as if everyone had already gathered on the common floor except for Steve. His science bro was giving Tony a bewildered look of confusion as Thor leaned over to ask him whispering; well what Thor considered whispering, “Is it a Midguardian custom to wear your new mate’s colors? Does Jane not consider us… Uh, what’s the word… Ah, ‘dating’, since she’s never done so?”
“I’ll run and go look around…” Steve began but was interrupted.
Only Steve’s eyes showed the surprise he felt at Tony’s words, it was there for just a second before Tony saw it disappear. “Alright, I’ll handle it.” Holding his hand out to Tony again, he gave him a challenging stare. “You gonna trust me to take care of you Tony?”
Steve stripped him slowly, as if he hated to remove every article of clothing but couldn’t wait to unravel the prize beneath once he’d done so. He went to remove the dog tags once he’d finished with Tony’s clothing, but after a moment of indecision while holding them tightly, he decided against it laying them back against Tony’s chest.
Steve quickly shook his head, “No, that’s… I don’t want to just drive him out after how much he’s helped us. But, I guess… Maybe like, for a week or two a month or something… I guess, could it, could it just be us again? I’m sure Bucky wouldn’t mind.” Dropping his head down, Steve looked a little contrite when he said, “I know I’m the reason we’re all together in the first place, and I love having Bucky in our relationship I really do. I mean the guy made me cum three times yesterday and came in me twice. He like really knows what gets us off. When he told me how much I’d like what we did this morning, saying how he could barely cum and all that other stuff, even though it wasn’t true I still was so turned on by it. But, I guess when…” Steve broke off blushing, giving a regretful sigh, “When Bucky said he was in love with you, it kinda really hit me for the first time. I hadn’t realized until then how deeply involved we were with him. I love that he loves you… You deserve all the love in the world. I just… I think, I um, I just need feel more involved with you than I have.”
This would have all been hilarious if Tony hadn’t felt the prickle of jealousy role up his spine. Any amusement he would normally feel at Clint’s pain was drowned out by all the emotions one statement made him feel. He tamped them down quickly, giving Steve his biggest press smile. “I knew it; no one in the world could be as wholesome as you were making out to be. Good for you…”
time Steve had edged him right to the brink only to pull back, Tony’s mind finally broke down. His body, completely exhausted from the constant arousal, gave out sinking into the bed with only Steve holding him in place. A violent shiver rolled through him as Steve murmured, “That it baby, so good, let go for me sweetheart. Hand over that last bit of control you’ve never given to anyone else.”
As he continued to stroke himself through his climax he heard Bucky growling voice. “God if you aren’t fucking perfect under me.” Steve wondered if this was a mistake. Even though he felt jealous and wished he could do for them what they were obviously doing for each other, Steve came harder than he ever had watching them. He wasn’t sure if Bucky calling Tony perfect made him come even longer or all over again. What he was sure of was that it was just the one night, and that he’d be a fool not to enjoy his boyfriends drive each other crazy in front of him. Even better, after this they’d probably feel comfortable having sex with Steve together now and he wouldn’t have to leave one or the other out.
Tony gave a nervous chuckle the belied his flippant tone as he spoke. “Then I’d like to start out by saying anything done prior to ’99 was under the influence and should not be taken into consideration in regards to my moral character.”
Chuckling as well Steve gave his agreement. “Yeah, he’d stay in his lab for days if I let him.” Bucky used the hand wrapped around Tony’s neck to push him down onto Bucky’s cock, freeing the other to wrap around Tony’s. Unable to hold back, a gasp the sound squeaked out of Tony. Luckily Steve thought it was because of what he said. “What Tony, you know it’s true.” Bucky squeezed at his throat prohibiting any further noises. “Anyway, Bucky and I were trying to decide if we wanted to go out
Greeting Steve first with a heartfelt smile and kiss, Tony looked hesitant but also curious as Steve guided him over to meet Bucky. When the smaller man reached out a hand to Bucky saying, “Hello handsome, it’s good to finally meet you.” Bucky’s playboy ways took over before he could stop himself from toying with the other man.
Subs almost always fell into one of 3 categories, they were usually a
. Codependent Dom’s lived off their Sub’s approval, adjusting themselves to whatever their partner needed. Because of this where often called the chameleon’s of the Dom world, able to service pretty much all the Sub types. Service Dom’s needed to have someone to take care of; giving them the love and stable environment they need to feel safe and cherished. Authoritative Dom’s loved being in control and exerting that control on their partners as well as others. These were the Dom’s that could make a Sub fall to their knees with just a look.
Tony’s eyes were closed as he felt Bucky piercing deep inside him, sending waves of ecstasy from places Tony didn’t know existed, when he heard Bucky speaking to him. “Fuck… Tony, Yeah baby, can’t wait to feel you suffocate my dick when you cum. Squeezing so hard, Uhh Damn…”
Bucky was true to his word, he pushed in slowly barely half an inch before pulling out and pushing in a little more. While he did this his hands roamed as if mapping every inch of Tony’s skin. Sliding up Tony’s thigh’s to his waist then around to grip the globes of Tony’s ass before moving on to his chest. Small trembles made their way up Tony’s legs from where they resting now against Bucky’s shoulder.
Tony’s synapses finally started firing again as he saw Bucky looking behind his back to Steve. While he gripped Bucky’s hips to stop his retreat Steve’s tone was a little whining as he said, “No why, of course you should finish. What wrong, why you need to stop.”
Looking perplexed as if wondering what was wrong, Bucky watched as Steve became more undone, hands gripping Bucky’s waist as he continued his grinding slide over Steve’s pulsing shaft arousing him further. When Steve’s eyes became glazed and hooded, legs twitching every few seconds, Bucky stopped. “You know what, it might have been because we were making skin to skin contact.” Without even asking Bucky pulled the sweats down to bare Tony then lifted off Steve to pull his down to the tops of his thigh. Settling right back on Steve’s hard length, Bucky gave a clenching slide as if readjusting his weight to show Steve how much better he’d feel Bucky now.
, he didn’t respond in anger. He instead used the time to get as much information as he could out of Steve. Contrary to how Pepper and Rhodey would tell it, Tony actually did know how to be charming when the situation called for it; he just usually didn’t care enough to use the skill. He didn’t even have to pry the information out of the other man all that much, only really had to ask and Steve would tell him whatever he wanted to know.
Bucky growled low in Tony’s ear while Steve said, “Well at least he’s making sure you eat. You’d probably have survived on coffee without him there.”
Nat gaped a Steve with raised eyebrows of her own while Clint turned his head in shock, forgetting the ball he’d thrown. He was reminded pretty quickly when it bounced off his face. The surprise caused him to lose his balance as he fell off where he was perched, “Ouch, fuck… No, no, no…”  Hand holding his face complained loudly his entire drop to the floor. “Damnit, stop laughing Nat. Ow, ow, ow… Stupid Steve’s fault… A good Dom would help their Sub instead of laughing their ass off… Fuck, I think I bruised my hip.”
“Yep,” Tony said as he gave Steve a kiss on the cheek. “Gotta stay fit so you’ll keep me round.”
Feeling the tug of happiness in Steve brought a surge of happiness within Tony as well. As he leaned down to lay his head on Steve’s chest, he could feel the surge of protective love envelope Steve’s mind as he wrapped Tony is his arms before succumbing to sleep again. Tony just smiled before letting sleep wrap around him again as well.
Tony gave him a disbelieving look, sending Bucky an
Nat laughed lowly when she interrupted him with, “Like someone else we know.”
Bucky ran a hand down Tony’s chest over his t-shirt saying, “I need to feel him out first and see where the tension is located the most at.” His breath began coming quickly as Bucky reached his hip and leaned in to run his tongue around Tony’s lips, “Definitely need to start in right there.” Bucky pushed his sweats down each side hanging just below Tony’s ass, making him groan slightly when Bucky palmed and stroked down his hardness. “This part of you seems to always be stiff Tony; we’ll have to make sure we don’t stop until all the tension is released. We should probably even work it to release a couple times to see if that helps.” Bucky reached in his own sweats bringing his long cock out bobbing over the top at Tony. As he did this he leaned forward into him a slid the hand on Tony’s cock between his legs all the way to Tony’s opening. Tony shivered and let out a squeaky moan as Bucky began circling over the crinkled skin, grazing over the entrance. “Yeah I think we need to start stretching right here first, you’re always so tight right there sweetheart. I’ll have to work into that one slowly for a while, and I know just the right position for that.”
Tony began stroking his cock at yesterday’s indiscretion, as well as Bucky’s continued honesty to him and only him. Although he doubted the man at first, he could honestly say he believed Bucky now when the soldier said he loved him. Tony shuddered as the plug inside him roared to life and moaned as he saw the door open. Smirking Bucky made his way into the room. He watched under a hooded gaze as Bucky kneeled at the edge of the bed and began a seductive crawl up the bed towards him. “Somehow when Stevie told me you’d be working in your lab all night, I knew exactly where you’d actually be.”
Steve chuckled softly as he saw Tony roll his eyes. “You may have been a playboy in the 40’s Barnes but I was one in the 90’s and unlike you we had porn. Pretty sure I know moves you haven’t heard of.” Bucky moved over to lay above Tony between his legs. Steve’s fingers twitched wanting to draw the men together, hoping like hell this worked out like he wanted.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve studied him as he leaned back chiming out, “Hm.”
Tony shuddered at Bucky’s words as he caught Steve’s nod in his peripheral. Steve rose up stretching and giving a yawn, he then motioned with a hand toward his vacated spot on the couch. “You can just lay him down here Buck. You’re right, no way I can hit Tony that hard, can’t even stand the thought.” Steve gave another tired yawn, “I’m tired and need to get some rest, hope you feel better after Baby.” Steve leaned down to kiss Tony who sighed into it as Bucky moved his cock incrementally inside Tony.
“I don’t know if it’s working, feels as if he’s tightening up on me.“ Bucky used his hands on Tony’s ankles to push his legs back further. Tony let out loud groans as his ass shifted up into Bucky causing his cock to hammer deeper inside. “No matter how hard I’m pushing into him, Tony just keeps getting tighter around me.” Tony could barely keep his eyes open, overwhelmed with Bucky battering into him every second. “I’ll probably have to start stretching his legs out every day to.”
Looking up at Bucky, his body teetered closer to the edge in anticipation. Bucky was a lot bigger than anyone Tony had ever been with. Thinking of how deep Bucky would be driving into him caused a pleasurable ripple to travel through Tony. With his body aching at the vision presented in front of him, Tony’s voice began to plead with him, “Please Bucky, I’ve been on the brink for days. I can’t think or work, make it stop. Give it to me. I need... I want... God, I don’t know... just... just do something...”
Bruce was a switch, having overlapping traits between his level 6 Sub and level 5 Dom orientations. This made him the perfect friend for Tony. He could sympathize with some of the trials Tony faced as a Sub running a company, as well as give him guidance as a Dom when he felt unbalanced. With Rhodey gone off with the military most of the time, when he and Pepper broke up, Bruce had been there to give him the support he needed without trying to assert influence over him like other Dom’s would.
“You cannot be serious, I must be hearing things…”
Tony knew at that moment he was completely done for. He had went and fell in love with Bucky fucking Barnes.
“Why are you sorry? You didn’t do anything wrong, I should have never let you get your hopes up.”
Bucky smirked arrogantly as he turned to Tony and leaned against the door frame. “No you don’t, you just wish you did. If you hate anyone it’s yourself sugar, for loving me in spite of it all.” Bucky’s gaze grew serious momentarily as just before walking away he said, “For what it’s worth I love you just as much sweetheart, and I’ve never given those words to anyone. Ask Steve if you don’t believe me, and about the fact that I’ve never been with anyone longer than 3 months.”
Bucky’s hand kept moving as he smirked down at Tony. “Other than the obvious, same thing I’ve been doing for the past two days, thinking about you.”
The last few months were heaven for Bucky. He’d finally gotten everything he wanted, but there was never really a question in his mind that he wouldn’t. He loved being able to go out with Tony, showing everyone how much he owned his little engineer. Even when they went out with Steve, Bucky always kept Tony close so there’d be no doubt in anyone’s mind. He knew inherently, in the back of his mind, that he owned Tony like no one else. Tony would never have done half of the things Bucky had drew him into doing if he didn’t. Bucky had set this morning’s scene up with Stevie before he woke the smaller man that had lain between them. He’d told Steve some of the things he would say to Tony, and had even told Steve how much he’d get off on it. Bucky didn’t think the humiliation would make Stevie hot enough to cum without anyone touching him but it shouldn’t have surprised Bucky.
For a moment, Bucky had forgotten Steve had come to sit down beside him. It wasn’t until the other man spoke again that he remembered he had entered the room. “Guys, we need to uh… I think we need to talk about this.”
It took nearly 20 minutes, but Bucky finally drilled down until all his cock pierced through. Once there, he groaned out a low growl as he grinded forward, eyes growing heated when he heard Tony’s whimper as he held his place.  “Knew you’d be able to take all of me.”
Usually he was all for dirty talk in his partners, but it was completely different when it was geared toward the man you love and coming from the man you were jealous of. It wasn’t even as if Bucky was talking the entire time, but the times were close enough together that when Tony would manage to make himself think he was alone with Steve, he’d hear Bucky saying ‘fuck you take it so good Stevie’ or ‘love the way you moan for me baby’.  So yeah, after 30 minutes of trying and failing Tony was ready to end this as quickly as possible. Tony knew after orgasm 3 Steve would be down for the count for at least a couple hours, super soldier refractory period doing only so much. He’d already come hard twice, once with Tony’s mouth while Bucky fingered him open and again after finally getting inside Tony once he’d stretched the smaller man open, Bucky fucking him slowly from behind. Tony did what he could to push Steve along to the third, squeezing around his length moving inside Tony and biting down on his nipples.
Making a sound of disapproval Steve said, “Tony, so help me I will drag you away from that lab finished or not. Listen to Bucky, and please for the love of God do what he says.”
Bucky’s hands gripping his toes while fingers ghosted over the sensitive skin between, and kneading the insteps of his feet had Tony nearly panting within a few minutes. He bit his lip hard enough to draw blood trying not to moan or squirm as Bucky’s hand traveled up his leg to knead his calves. He couldn’t stop the shiver rippling over his body when Bucky fingers grazed the back of his knee. The soft caress caused Tony’s gaze to grow hooded blurring his eyesight. His cock had become so hard it hurt. If either man looked closely, they’d see the small wet patch of fabric where Tony’s erection was leaking through.
Tony retreated with a small wave goodbye, smirking at Steve when he said, “Don’t stare too hard at my ass as I leave.”
Though his erection had flagged after the other two had come, Tony began to get hard again as Steve kissed beneath his ear and rubbed the towel gently between his legs. When Steve’s arm brushed against it and Tony moaned softly, Steve looked down and noticed he hadn’t come. When a look of guilt rushed across Steve’s face, Tony quickly shushed him before he could say anything. “It’s alright Steve, seeing you lose yourself was more than enough for me. Besides,” Tony shrugged giving him a small smile, “It’s your birthday so tonight should be all about you.”
So yeah, Bucky knew he owned Tony, but he never heard Tony say it without having Bucky to cajole him into it. This time it meant more, because Bucky could see exactly how much Tony meant and believed the words. It tore a growl from his throat as he leaned down to kiss Tony, hips stilling in their movement. Rising back up, Bucky gazed down at the man below him, completely enraptured as he said words he never said to anyone before and meant. “Knew you were made for me Tony, God help me but I’m completely in love with you.” While Bucky did began to give it to him hard, just as Tony asked for, the feeling of the movements had changed. Never breaking eye contact, Bucky drove into Tony over and over until they both came, Tony with his own declarations of love.
. Perpetual Subs were your level 1-3 partners, craving full control from who they were with. They loved being a slave to their partners or having a relationship of full time power exchange. Level 4-6 Nesting Subs were the usually your homemaker types, craving rules and schedules. Like his mother who was a 5, they are balanced by always knowing what’s happening around them and keeping things in order.
“I can’t fight it anymore, Tony. Everyday it’s been harder to keep from touching you.” Tony’s eyes opened and his heart began to race when Bucky’s hands hesitantly touched him. Eyes drawn down, Bucky slipped his hands beneath the hem of shirt and inched upward. “Let me have you baby, I know you’d be so good, giving me everything I need.” Tony’s released a small sound as his lips parted to gasp for air at Bucky’s praise. His hands continued in their slow motioned path, only stopping once Bucky’s fingertips could graze across the skin near Tony’s abdomen.
Bucky grinned and leaned down to devour Tony’s mouth, his hair framing their faces from view. Muffling his shouts, but only very little, he continued pushing Tony to a climax not even Bucky had given him before. Breaking their kiss, he looked to see Tony overwhelmed trembling apart beneath him. Bucky gave a growled possessive groan as he plunged faster into Tony. “Uhn, Fuck yeah, I’m the only one who does this to you, nobody can but me sweetheart.” He saw Bucky look up asking, “You ever seen him look like this Stevie?” Steve to looked down to him, and Tony knew he had to look completely wrecked, eyes fluttering as they rolled back with his limbs twitching repeatedly. Bucky continued as Steve shook his head no, “Look at the way I’m hammering my way into him. Can you plow in like this Stevie, if so I’ll get up and let you finish working Tony?”
. These were your level 10’s and were so unique only 0.5% of the world fell into that category. The odds of actually meeting one in person were 1:900,000 chances. When the books he read didn’t give much detail about them, Tony waved it off thinking it didn’t matter.
Tony’s high pitched whines were coming with more frequency at Bucky’s pace, his eyes focusing up on Steve. “God Steve, he’s, uhhh… didn’t think I could… Oh God, yes, feel this good… He’s working in there…” Tony quivered as his arousal barreling forward lighting across his skin as he sobbed, “Uhh, oh my God, oh my god, fuck I, I, stretching… so… Uhhh wide… Please, Bucky, Uhhh, never want to stop.”
If it were him he wouldn’t have stopped either, kept at it until Tony got everything he needed. The constant words spewing from Bucky’s mouth about how good Tony felt and how great he was being for Bucky helped to keep him from going soft as well. He’d never come so hard or so many times in such a short period of time.
“Ah ok, that makes more sense,” Tony said nodding his head before he stopped and began blinking his eyes up at Steve, “Wait no… Actually it really doesn’t, how did you get ahold of Pepper… Why did you get ahold of Pepper? Oh God, the world’s ending isn’t it? Zombies are everywhere outside and trying to get in to eat us aren’t they?”
Steve didn’t even lift his eyes from what he was working on as he acknowledged Tony’s agitation. “What’s wrong?”
a little further.”
Hearing his name, Tony looked up from his work for the first time in days. Blinking his eyes to clear the blurring of his vision from moving so quickly, he took in Steve staring worriedly back at him. It was then his brain began to clear and let him know it wasn’t the first time his name was called. Tony had been too clouded to acknowledged and comprehend the numerous others prior to the last.
Steve responded with a sweet smile that gave Tony butterflies. Bucky’s flirty deep voice responding ‘No promises’ and giving Tony a heated look made him turn a deep shade of red.
Ok fine, she was completely right.
Tony would deny the needy high pitched whimper escaping from his throat to his grave. At the sound, Steve’s hands clenched harder around Tony’s wrists. The action caused his back to arch, rubbing their groin and chests together as he moaned against Steve’s lips. A growling sound rumbled from Steve as he repeated Tony’s action, rolling his hips down to slide their lengths together.
Well… Tony may have had to turn his head slightly.
Bucky took Tony’s hand to pull him across the short distance toward the training room wall in front of Steve. “Yeah you’re fine right there to see everything I’m doing to Tony.” Tony’s face flushed brightly at Bucky’s words as his dick sprang to full attention in record breaking time. He was maneuvered with his back to the wall in front of Bucky, unable to view behind the man to Steve just a few feet away. “I may need you to help me put him in the positions I want him in.” Tony shook his head no, eyes widening up at Bucky who just smirked down at him. “I’ll let you know if we need the help Stevie, I know I can handle this first one ok. For now you can just watch and learn.”
Bucky opened the door to walk into the dark bedroom. He was barely able to make out the two figures lying on the bed, Tony on top of Steve’s chest leaning to the side as the other man lay on his back. Bucky wanted to laugh at how easy it was to secure an open invitation to this bed from Steve. Turn on the sob story and Steve Rogers went down like the Titanic trying to make everything better. Bucky loved his friend, but it was laughable how gullible he could be sometimes.
He closed his eyes as Bucky began rolling his hips, barely slipping out of Tony but merely shifting his cock around. As the movements sparked small tendrils of pleasure inside him, Tony did his best to think of Steve and picture the blonde doing this to him. He lost track of time in his fantasy, had no idea how long Bucky teased him with the short deliberately slow thrusts. Not wanting to give him the pleasure of knowing just how good he was making Tony feel, even though the slow ember had raged early to an inferno through his body, Tony did his best to keep silent. Only the occasionally gasp and whimper escaped his lips but unfortunately he was unable to control the near constant shivers traveling through his limbs.
As Tony thought through it he saw more pros than cons to agreeing. With Bucky not rattling off porn phrases to Steve, Tony might not only enjoy this but he could also cement to Steve this 3 way thing might work if he chose to continue down his insane path. He could at least try; if Tony hated it he could always stop him. So Tony looked up to Bucky as he shrugged and said, “Why not.”
happy to.” Steve grinned at Tony’s eye roll before shaking his head and continuing. “I’d um, well I’ve really been wanting to be with both you and Bucky, at the same time. So if you’re uh, okay with that, I’d love for it to be tonight.”
Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist, pressing their bodies tightly together. “I see anyone touch you like that again, I’ll break their arm.”
This is when Tony made his choice and gave in… to Bucky.
Over the course of the next 3 months, whenever Steve continued his annoying habit of following Tony
Bucky didn’t take his eyes off Tony riding him when he spoke to Steve this time, to focused on watching Tony lose himself so completely. “Look at him Stevie, he wants it so much. He looks so wrecked already and he’s only been on my dick for a few minutes. He’s already so close… Fuck just… Just let me make him come first.”
“All right baby, you asked for it.” Bucky said to Tony smiling down at him arrogantly and with a small amount of awe. He pulled out before thrusting back so hard Tony slid up the bed causing the latter’s eyes to roll back as his back arched from the sensations.
He heard Bucky’s laughter behind him as Steve asked, “Do you keep him in the same position or change if he needs something else?”
The flesh hand hold Tony’s hip while the other metal one held Barnes’s dick in place gripped Tony harder. Tony saw his gaze flash heatedly as Bucky gave him a cocky smirk. “Ah sugar, for that I’m going to make you beg before you come.”
Tony’s voice was low as he spoke, his throat sounding dry and scratchy from taking Bucky so far in. “God yes, so ready… Please, I need…”
When Steve first brought Bucky to the compound after finding him, he was grateful to have his friend back close to him. The team was wary at first not knowing Bucky’s state of mind but soon grew to embrace him as well. He enjoyed verbally sparring with Clint, talking to Natasha about Russia, pranking Steve with Sam, and taking Wanda under his wing helping to control her powers. After a month they started inviting Bucky to the weekly movie night. He usually sat with Steve, when he was there, throwing popcorn at Clint when the moving was boring or giving quiet commentary to Steve when it was one he liked.
Bucky walked out after leaving Tony hard, but not before telling him not to touch it. It would be later that night before Bucky finally let Tony come. In the kitchen before dinner, Bucky came up behind Tony to pin him against the counter. Rubbing his hardness against Tony ass, Bucky palmed Tony’s erection through his pants until he was about to come. He then pulled back saying he was starved and went to sit at the kitchen table leaving Tony right at the edge. It was in Bucky’s bed that night, after two hours slowly fucking into Tony, that he finally pushed him over. By the end Tony nearly lost his voice begging Bucky for release.
wanted, but was stuck with so had to love him anyway. He was a level 9 Sub, a highly uncommon type, who was constantly saying
He gave her a disbelieving look as he said, “That’s it? Just put on a Cap T-shirt?”
Around the 6
Eyes still on Bucky, he saw the man’s smirk widen at Steve’s question. “Everything’s fine here,” Tony responded, hoping his voice was coming out as normal since Bucky was still moving him. “Bucky’s… behaving fine, um… He’s, ah, right there, uh sorry, right here if, um, you wanna say hi.”
Bucky wanted laugh at how easy Steve was to manipulate as he gave the man a smile nodding. Giving a quick stroke over his already slick cock and lined Tony up, head coming against the wrinkled skin around his opening. Bucky looked down to watch himself glide into Tony’s hole, stretching it wide as it engulfed every inch of Bucky’s long hard rod. Tony’s quiet gasps and moans were music to Bucky’s ears as pushed into him slowly until all the way inside. “Mmm… Yeah, Tony and I fit much better this way.”
Tony’s cheeks colored as he gave a slightly flustered answer back, “Reassurance, structured atmosphere… C-Control and, and…” Tony had to cough as the fourth word seem to lodge itself in his throat, “…And Discipline.”
Tony came to consciousness slowly, feeling fully sated and relaxed in ways he hadn’t ever had before. After making Tony come for the last time, Bucky had sweet-talked him through the aftermath of what happened. Still seated deep inside, he murmured praises of how Tony had done so well with his lips beside Tony’s ear. His hands roved up and down Tony’s body soothingly as he slowly came back to full coherence. He’d known all about subspace, even had the pleasure of seeing a few lovers go there for him, but had never felt the effects himself before.
Things kept happening over and over again for 2 weeks until just glancing Bucky’s direction immediately set Tony’s blood on fire. Thinking it would help in keeping him more composed throughout the day, he tried having more sex with Steve. Even though their sex life hadn’t changed, he found it hard and harder climax as each day passed. By day 8 it was so bad Tony had to fake an orgasm when Steve wasn’t looking. Making matters worse, even when he managed to come Tony still felt on edge. It left him more sensitive to Bucky instead of less, feeling more unsatisfied each time.
A couple hours later Steve walked into Bucky’s room at the compound. Bucky had been lounging on his bed working through a couple items on the list Tasha gave him of important history he missed. “Hey Buck, Tony’s locked down in Manhattan for the next week so we have to go to him. You okay with staying at the Tower for a few days?”
Everything.
Bucky’s eyes darkened at Tony, arousal at his words reflecting through. Anytime Tony did something to make Bucky happy, the soldier would reward him in some way. Having confessed this morning to the soldier about loving Bucky’s manhandling, Tony knew his prize was Bucky’s arms gripping beneath his thighs to lift him. Still kneeling on the sofa near its arm, Bucky held Tony’s thighs hostage against his own chest while lower legs dangled free over Bucky’s forearms. Movement inside him renewed, Bucky’s hand gripped his cock again to stroke him. Truly whining in distress now at the inferno inside him moments away from exploding, Tony told Steve, “Please come rescue me from him, Bucky won’t stop shoving things down my throat. He’s always trying to fill me up until I’m stuffed and can’t take anymore.”
Yeah, everything would be totally fine, this was definitely not a bad idea.
Giving him a concerned look, Steve reached up to hold Bucky’s face in his hands. “I know… I know it came as a surprise to all of us, but…” Steve looked away as if searching the room for answers before bringing their eyes back together. “We all have to figure out why it I
It had not even been 12 hours yet but Tony already missed Bucky. He knew it was going to be hell going from Bucky taking Tony at least twice a day to whenever they could find the alone time. With his mind on that thought, Tony was overjoyed when Steve came down to his lab and gave him the best news. “Tony, I need to ask you a favor. You don’t have to say yes, but I need you to promise you’ll at least think about it.”
Head cocking to the side for a second as he took Tony in, Steve looked as if he’d finally unraveled the last piece of a mystery. He leaned down into Tony’s space, hands bracing his weight on the table behind Tony. Though light in wrapping around his upper arms, they were firmly holding them in place. He really hoped the Dom didn’t feel the small shiver of arousal that raced through him at the action.
Laughing Steve said, “You did, I had to listen to you about every girl you were with. Then I’d have to let them cry on my shoulder when you moved on. God,” Steve breathed out loudly giving an exaggerated look of annoyance, “You owe me so much for having to listen to all that blubbering over missing you. I was told so many things about you I never wanted to visualize.”
Breaking him from his thoughts, Steve smiled as he heard Tony challenge Bucky. Steve slapped a hand over his face and shook his head. Bucky was going to shatter Tony to pieces, but Steve knew from experience he’d enjoy every second of it.
There was no doubt Bucky would have him, Tony sealed his own fate the moment he opened his legs. The look on Tony’s face when he did it was pure need, and Bucky was just the man to fulfil it.
Steve brought his hand up to cup Tony’s cheek while he stroked his jaw. He looked as if he was trying to figure something out when he hesitantly said, “You seemed to really like what Bucky was doing to you to. I’ve never seen you lose yourself like that before.”
The problem wasn’t that Steve didn’t enjoy sex with Tony, the problem was that Tony’s sex drive had diminished over the years. He still enjoyed it, especially with Steve since he loved the man, but usually Steve would have to coax Tony in the mood. Being that Tony’s body was getting more sex than it actually needed; Tony hadn’t initiated sex with Steve since that first month they were together. It often made Steve feel that he was pressuring Tony when in actuality Tony felt the exact opposite. He loved that Steve wanted him that much so even if he wasn’t in the mood, he felt desired and loved to the point he wanted to make Steve feel as good as he made Tony feel. If Steve’s moans and cries of ecstasy when inside Tony were anything to go by, Tony had been doing a damn good job of it to.
Level 10 Submissive’s were considered a rare oddity because in addition to their own traits, they also had the traits of an Authoritative Dom. They would fight to gain control and then even harder to keep it. It’s why most Dom’s couldn’t top them. Only a hand full of level 9’s had the patience to even try and even fewer had the temperament follow through.
Hand in Bucky’s fist, Tony wrapped his fingers around the hardened length and began stroking it. “Steve, its… it’s, so big. God, I’ve never seen one this long and thick.” Eye’s going up to Bucky’s mischievously Tony asked, “Wow, Bucky how big is this thing?”
Maybe after some time, Tony would be able to move on and forget this as well.
“Okay… How long has it been since you had sex together? What were you guys doing before and what have you tried?”
Tony was rock hard and his hands began shaking as he worked by the time Bucky finished. Clearing his throat he asked, “That doesn’t sound too bad, he still wasn’t willing to try?”
Licking his lips, Tony made his way over to stand between Bucky’s legs. “Last time I checked, you still owe me for being nice to you yesterday.”
He leaned back thinking everything had worked out as he hoped with his fella’s. He settled in to enjoy the show, wanting to figure out how to make Tony quiver and moan that way under him or make Bucky that wild and possessive.
When Bucky heard Tony’s voice he lifted his head to watch the other man pleading to be fucked. His dick grew even harder as he remembered when Tony was moaning those same words to him. Lost in the fantasy his hips stuttered forward more than he meant to, pushing his dick slightly further into Steve. He grunted in discomfort saying, “Bucky… Too much, be careful baby.”
“Yeah sugar, fuck if I don’t love the way you moan taking my dick.” Steve heard Bucky say, at this point he’s pretty sure he was the only one that heard it. Tony looked lost and completely wrecked. Steve had never seen his body quake like it was doing now or heard him moan so much and so loud before. The smaller man had always been so quiet when he was with Steve, only whimpering occasionally before moaning Steve’s name before he came. But now, Steve wasn’t aware those sounds could be drawn from Tony or the guttural cry Tony made as he finally came.
Bucky didn’t even try to hold back his orgasm as it rolled over him. With Tony riding him like it was the only thing he ever wanted to do, ass clenching as it rippled around him from Tony’s uncontrolled trembling, there was no way he could try to stop it. He did however grab Tony’s hips and began thrusting up, fucking Tony hard as he pumped him full of cum, wanting to bring the smaller man to completion along with him. It didn’t take long before Bucky felt splashes of cum hit his stomach from Tony, shuddering and crying out Bucky’s name as he came. Steve’s groans in release could be heard only vaguely, hidden beneath the sounds of Tony’s orgasm.
Bucky began rolling his hips down finally beginning to thrust in and out albeit still far to slow. Tony felt stretched impossibly wide as Bucky kept moving, kept going so deep. From this position Tony could now see Bucky’s cock sliding in and out of him. He could see Bucky rolling his hips and testing different angles, categorizing Tony’s reactions again as he’d done before with his hands.
He’d told a little white lie to Tony when he said Stevie hadn’t been able to take all of him, but he knew Tony needed to hear it. Bucky had also lied about where and how he came. He’d actually spilled into Stevie’s ass, twice to be exact, cumming like a freight train both times as he pulled 3 orgasms out of Steve. All of that withstanding nothing, and Bucky meant absolutely nothing, came close to being inside Tony fucking Stark. Bucky would do anything, even if that meant lying to the man between his legs and never touching Stevie’s ass again, if it meant Tony would keep giving it up to Bucky whenever he wanted it. It hadn’t even been the first time he’d fucked Steve, it was just the first time Tony had ever seen them. He’d been inside Stevie’s ass almost as much as he’d been inside Tony’s these past few months. Tony had just never known because he only ever wanted Steve’s ass when the other man wasn’t around. Bucky would just have to make sure Stevie never spilled the beans about his rides on Bucky’s dick.
Tony’s eyes landed on him across the room as he nodded at whatever Steve was saying to him. Tony choked on the wine he had just raised to his lips as Bucky increased the vibrations of the toy inside him again. Bucky chuckled quietly as he Tony turned to glare in his direction after saying whatever words he’d used to placate Steve. He had to admit that he loved that Tony knew everything now, knew exactly how devious Bucky could be and had been, and was still with him anyway. It was freeing in a way, to have someone know the devil in him and still love him anyway. When Tony looked toward the bathroom and then back at Bucky, he just shook his head no. As much as he would love to fuck Tony and then send him back to Steve covered in his cum, Bucky had other plans for his engineer tonight.
Bucky sounded contrite as he rubbed his forehead looking bashful. “I uh, guess it because we’ve been at it so long, I felt like I was gonna, you know... cum on Tony. I’m still really close and it’d take a while to get off the edge.”
It was safe to say that when all three men sat down to watch a movie after all this, Tony was already extremely sexually frustrated. Letting Bucky continue with pulling Tony’s feet into his lap and massaging them was the very last thing Tony needed.
Tony moaned as he nodded around the head of Bucky’s cock that was still in his mouth. Bucky handed him the lube, letting him get his fingers coated without distraction before he began to fuck Tony’s face in full. Tony lost track of everything except keeping his throat open and stretching himself open like Bucky asked. He felt free in a way he never had before knowing Bucky would take care of everything, he’d tell Tony what to do. Tony wouldn’t have to think about anything but giving himself over completely into the other man’s hands. Tony began to feel as if he was weightless, his body floating and charged in anticipation. Every word from Bucky’s mouth just drove that feeling higher until all Tony was completely focused on him as the rest of the world fell away.
Steve blushed saying, “No, I, uh, I’ll have to practice. I can’t, uh, move like that.”
Some sort of realization dawned on Clint as he stopped laughing suddenly. He straightened up as he looked at Tony fully before throwing up his arms in disappointment and crossing them. “Ah man… Damn it Tony, I was really looking forward to seeing what Dom Steve with a sub was going to be like.” His voice had lowered when he muttered childishly, “Always ruining stuff… Never gonna see Dom Steve…” as said man walked into the room.
This love he dreamed of, had hoped for, and had thought would never come, was finally his…
“Loved watching you sweetheart, always have been more of a work of art than anything on the walls of those fancy’s shows you dragged me to.” Bringing a hand up to cup Steve’s cheek Bucky asked, “Do you trust me baby?” When Steve gave him a nod almost immediately he continued on, “I want you to sit here quietly and not move, not even to touch yourself, until I tell you it’s ok.”
He talked about the man as if he were the nanny, the governess, and everything else besides where the children were concerned, and even though any other man in Stark’s station would have been utterly insulted by that treatment, she’d witnessed how happy he was to comply when Stefen did the asking.
Steve’s pact with the Prince of Norway was based on more than mutual respect and the friendship that Thor had offered him in Vienna. Thor could not convince his father to move against Germany preemptively, but he had seen what Steve had seen all too clearly. Norway was too crucially positioned for Germany to allow it to fall into enemy hands. Neutrality would not save them.
I was very sorry to hear about the health of your aunt. I don't know much about healing that sort of affliction I'm afraid. Illnesses of the heart are often as delicate as they are deadly. Nevertheless, I will give you everything I have at my disposal to give.  Please send me a detailed list of her symptoms and her any description you can provide as to her usual color when she experiences these episodes of breathlessness. The more detail the better. And as a matter of course, I strongly urge you to consult with her physician before you take on your own methods for care.
"I did what
“Is there something you needed Sir? I didn't hear you ring.” He glared at the night staff, Frau Hogan, her husband, Willamina the cook and his grounds keeper Samuel Wiess, gathered around the table as if it was personally their fault.
Tony swallowed, frozen in place. He should leave. This was a very private thing…
Tony and Péter managed to find Pepper in the crowded market after. They stopped at a vendor when the smell of roasted nuts proved too irresistible to ignore. Tony got the chestnuts for himself and a bag to share with Stefen, and Péter got a large bag of cinnamon dusted almonds to split with his siblings; but judging by how fast the hot little delights were disappearing down his gullet Tony thought it best to trot back and purchase another.
The reports on the radio were all grimmer than the last. All day they’d been telling people how necessary it was to deport the Jewish Immigrants who drained their economy and brought crime and corruption to their neighborhoods. Many of them were hostile to removal. People were dying, but the newsmen said that if soldiers took shots, it was for the safety of the public.
“My superiors have sent me, as German law mandates Abraham Erskine is no longer suited for practice. He may even be responsible for the Major’s current condition. The Führer is most concerned. I’m sure you are as well. Erskine is being held for questioning.” Fischer was explaining to the woman and Dvorak’s eyebrows inched upwards in surprise. Erskine? Rogers had kept a Jewish doctor on as the family physician. Was he mad?
He knew what a man looked like when he’d made his peace with death and the boldness it gave you when you realized it was all over but the shouting. This was a savored sunrise.
It was like once he’d allowed himself to want it, to dream these things, there was no stopping it. The flood gates were open.
But a sudden hush followed by an outbreak of murmuring in the room drew his eyes up once more, anxious to find the source of the fuss. With relief he noted that it was the arrival of the incomparable Janneke Van Dyne that had caused the stir and not something more sinister. Tony had only met the lauded singer on one occasion, and a very strange occasion it had been, and this time it was easy to see why people hailed her as one of the great beauties of the world.
It had been too dangerous for Tony to be on the road immediately following the break out of Dachau. Just as Brother Simone had predicted, officers from the camp had arrived before vespers, only hours after Tony and his companions had been shown to some heated water and a dry change of clothing. The small country abbey was already full of refugees who had lost their homes in the pogrom. Tony and Bruce had been offered the floor in the subpriors room, but Bruce had insisted that they were fine bunking down in the barn with the refugee families and Tony had been too sore and exhausted to argue.
And for the moment, Tony felt very light indeed.
For as large as this steel flying death trap was, it was still cramped in the bunks where Captain D’Anvers stored them, behind the flight engineer’s compartment. Besides Carol herself, her crew consisted of four others. First, there was Martin Vayle the navigator, who Steve would bet had some sort of relationship going on with Carol. The painfully professional way she introduced him was a dead giveaway. Especially in contrast to the almost offhanded way she introduced the remaining three: Quill, Drax and Rocket. Last names only and in the case of “Rocket”, a nickname he’d picked up somewhere in basic training.
“Latcho drom.” Bucky returned, his voice barely above a whisper, and a moment later he was gone, shutting the door firmly behind him.
“Captain, we’ve heard many tales of your exploits.” Loki said, giving no hint that he was at all impressed by them. His eyes flickering to Thorson gave away the first hint of emotion that Steve had witnessed in the form of fond amusement. “Thor has subjected us to them almost daily since we left home.”
He would have to leave tonight.
Natacha stared back at him, her eyes swimming with some unnamable emotion before she slowly looked away, nodding solemnly. She went back to her knitting without saying a word, but Péter knew her. He let out a slow breath of relief.
Steve was barely listening, the minute his head had stopped swimming he'd begun to drift off. He began to lose himself.
“What do you mean?”
That man’s existence was impossible and yet, Tony had seen him, heard him call Weiss a friend and had believed him. That man was someone even Tony would have followed into war.
“Of course, I’m not alright!” he snapped irritably, flushing an embarrassed pink. “You just… you just-“
He finished playing one song, and while the audience applauded, he swiped the glass of wine perched atop the piano and downed about half of it to settle his nerves.
Stefen chuckled despite the worry still clinging to him and pressed a kiss to the top of her head, gaze meeting Tony's as he murmured in reply, "of course. The kitchen will be nice and warm with the stoves going. Why don't you go down with Tony while I wake Cameron up?"
Péter nodded emphatically, little droplets of water landing on his shoulder.
His grandad had been teaching him his trade. Steve had expected to earn money making trinkets and instruments and selling them to the gadjie the way that Ian had before the war had come. And there was always his art. After the war when he and Bucky had lived in Leopoldstat Steve had managed to bring in a little income working with a magazine. He and Bucky had made a little extra money here and there using their talents, breaking even between their rent and the money they sent back to their mothers. He could live like that again.
Frauline Werner tutted softly at her and touched her cheek.
Tony nodded, sighing contentedly as the music in his head finished it’s swell.
Steve had contacted Parodi months ago. The last he’d heard, Lucan had gone back to his father’s home in Dagal earlier in the year, only to find that even as far south as Liechtenstein the Germans were forcing the Jews from their homes and into the ghettos. Three cousins on his father’s side were now in a segregated quarter of the city. His wife’s entire family had been transplanted out of the city entirely due to overcrowding.
Bucky sighed.
"Yes. It was far."
She didn't want to sing, or to know the names of flowers, or to listen to any more of Herr Stark's lectures. She wanted to scream.
“I know who he is.” The girl challenged, holding Bucky’s stare. Lang whistled lowly and made himself look busy. Bucky was in a mood, and the girl was asking for trouble. Best stay out of it.
Tony just barely resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the way he managed to make hours sound like months.
“Good morning, children.”
“I'm sure they do.”
Artur scrunched up his face and leaned into the table to better capture Herr Stark’s attention.
It was ridiculous to think that anyone would know he was looking up his decidedly Jewish relatives just by looking at him, but Tony couldn’t shake the feeling that anyone who looked at him would know. It was a public library after all. If anyone cared to get nosy there was nothing to stop them from knowing his business, there. That could come back to haunt him.
“This is for anyone you feel might need it,” he instructed with a meaningful look. She looked puzzled for a moment as she took it from him, her mind working quickly behind her eyes before it seemed to connect.
Turning back to Emil and the others she tossed an apology over her shoulder and began to hurry as quickly down the steps of the Cinema House as she could without earning a scolding later from her superiors. But she hadn’t got very far when Emil grabbed her by the shoulder and squeezed, almost causing her to slip. His fingers were digging into her shoulder.
“I kissed you first. You acted as if nothing happened. The day I confronted you about it, you and Bucky were going over a map in your office. As I recall, I would have asked more questions about what you were up to, but I confess that your lips and generally infuriating nature are effectively distracting.” Tony reminisced, and Steve just stared at him for a moment, astonished to learn that despite his best efforts Tony had seen what he wasn’t supposed to see.
She and his little René.
His gaze flickered over Tony one last time before turning to squint at Ian and James.
Over the noise Charlotte did her best to answer the questions being hurled her way.
“Yes?”
He meant to tell her it was too early to be up, send them both back to bed – there was no time to comfort them when their father’s life hung in the balance - but the words died on his tongue as he took in the horror in her eyes as she stared at her father’s wasted form on the bed, the ragged weariness weighing down her shoulders as she turned those tear filled eyes toward him.
Steve clenched his hands at the unwelcome news. The DELASEM knew good and well where Antony Carboni was residing within the city. How this fellow had connected that name with Antony Stark was as much a mystery as who that man was and what his intentions were in the first place. But there was no time to think on it, as they swung from one blow to the next.
“He’d want us to go on.”
“There’s every reason,” he whispered so fervently Tony shifted uneasily. “Tony, I did-“
He chuckled deep in his throat. Stark was anything but that. He was so many things really… too many to properly put labels on him, but that didn’t stop his mind from trying.
But if Steve were honest, the distance had started before then. Peggy's death had changed Steve… and he knew not for the better. It had been hard on Bucky too, and hard on top of that to try and prop Steve up only to be pushed away at every turn. Steve had insisted on grieving alone and Bucky had left shortly after that for Hungry. He knew logically that Bucky had his family still to support, but somehow he'd not quite comprehended that Bucky would leave and then truly be gone.
“-study when you're finished. Ask Virginia for my whereabouts if I'm not.” Steve finished as if Bucky had not even spoken.
“Franz loves us. He’s not a coward!” She flayed underneath him. He grabbed her face, squeezing her head between his hands as if he could pop it like a ripe tomato, screaming into it. “Your brother betrayed his blood to save his own neck. Open your eyes! Why do you think the SS spared the two of you?”
Somewhere right now in Hamburg, Salzburg, Berlin, Vienna, and anywhere else that could be imagined, there are two old friends happily sharing their lives together. People wonder but they didn’t pry, and if someone recognized them in one of those infamous establishments that catered to a certain kind they weren’t likely to mention it for fear of being asked why they were there themselves.
The artists that Bucky had signed were like his children in a way, in the fact that he’d helped them birth careers and had diligently fostered them over the years. He took care of them and they took care of him in return and it was just one more bitter taste on his tongue having to cut them loose. Some of them didn’t have much to go back to.
~*~~*~
Ian must have looked very pathetic because it wasn’t long at all before, he found himself sat in a comfortable chair in front of the wood stove, the woman Karlina fussing over his cut while her husband fed the stove more wood. When she’d cleaned him up to her satisfaction she hurried off into the kitchen, and Ian slumped into the back of the chair his body shaking with exhaustion.
Péter, who was a little bit ahead of them, turned to look over his shoulder with a droll expression and say, “Ian doesn’t give up easily.”
“What’s going on? I heard screaming.”
“No it doesn’t.” James shot back with a worried frown. “He said that if it was going to take as long as last time, he’d send for us. Father’s always gone for ages!”
“I do.” Tony allowed, wondering where Stefen intended to take this. Stefen stepped closer, and the tension between them changed yet again, back to that low thrumming intensity that had his stomach fluttering.
“Alright, bambinos!” Tony clapped his hands together to grab the children's attention. It mostly worked, nearly all of them quieting their chatter to look his way. James was the exception, continuing to try and bat away Ian who had the misfortune of standing his bicycle too close to him.
Tony was leaning into Stefen’s space and for one reason or another the captain hadn’t moved. They were standing close enough for Tony to feel the puff of his breath against the skin of his cheeks and suddenly he had to fight down a blush of his own.
"Heretic!"
ave maria, ave maria
“The Captain has already done what he can.” Daniel stated, stepping forward with more confidence now that he saw they really weren’t going to run and get their father. “The Germans dumped our parents in Poland and nobody knows or cares what happened to them next. It could take your father months to find them, and he has his own family to worry about.”
Bucky’s eyes on the other hand narrowed shrewdly in appraisal.
Steve ran until he couldn’t anymore.  He tried to be smart, using thicker pockets of trees for cover and steeper ground to force his pursuers to abandon their vehicles. Even military automobiles were only so equipped for off road travel and Steve was intimate with their weaknesses. After a time, the gunshots behind him grew distant and tapered off altogether. He kept running. The numbness from the morphine faded in staccato bursts of increasingly brighter and brighter pain until it was back in full force a consist burn that covered his entire body.
For James that meant screams.
“Children this is Frau Hogan, my head of house. She’ll take you up to your room.”
Tony was glad to see Bucky back safe after the horror of the pogroms. They'd stretched all over the Reichland, from Salzburg to Berlin. Anything could have happened to him out there; but that just made Péter's absence at his side all the more noticeable and Tony's chest tightened with dread, certain that them not having entered together meant that Bucky had not been able to find him.
“Makes you wonder, doesn’t it? Maybe if we’d had weapons like that, things might have turned out differently for us in the Great War," Richter mused aloud, staring thoughtfully at Tony.
“And why not Captain?” Schmidt asked with a disapproving tsk of his tongue. “Surely you do not object for their health? After so long being ill surely you are eager to celebrate their good fortunes, just as I am sure they are eager to return and serve the public.”
“And you’re sure Schmidt couldn’t have planted it there?” he asked as he handed one of the glasses off to Siv and Steve stilled momentarily. To be honest the thought had never even accorded to him.
His eyes immediately flew to Susann, who was watching him closely, and then to Tony who was paying attention to neither of them. If he’d seen he didn’t show any sign of it.
Uncle Bucky went straight away to father's office. Ian could hear the door slam even from down the hall. He could hear his father speaking, his voice gone brittle and clipped as he tried to explain again to James, who’d latched onto his arm, why he was leaving.
Only the one! And it wasn’t as if Tony’s secret were some small thing without much consequence attached.
“Why didn’t you tell me about what happened in the market that day?” Stefen asked, only a hint of his early anger present. Tony arched his brows.
Hammer hadn’t reported to work since the day of the party. It could be he hadn’t felt safe on the road, or it could be the beginning of their end.
The thought burned clearly in his mind, undeniably true and terrifying for that.
She frowned and took a hesitant step back.
There were steps in the hall and the room went quiet, it’s occupants tensing. Steve reached slowly for the weapon resting on the table. A moment later there was a knock on the door. Four, two, and three rapid taps in the prearranged code but Steve kept his weapon at the ready while Zimmerman got up to answer the door.
“I told you! I told you I’d put you in the ground first!”
All that was left to do now was pick up his soldering iron bury it at the bottom of his bag and go.
There was so much that Tony wanted to say to Stefen. How he wished they could be open with each other and talk about what was developing between them. How he wished that Stefen trusted him, knowing that Tony would never willingly betray him. How he wished he was at all certain that Stefen’s feelings, whatever their extent, would not alter if he learned the truth of who Tony was.
“You will be careful, won’t you?” he asked lowly once Bucky got both children settled inside and Steve had stepped back. Seeing the worry so clearly in his eyes warmed something inside of Steve. It wasn’t the moment for it, but he thought Tony’s eyes were just as gorgeous in the moonlight as he remembered.
Tony could confidently say that he had been faced with tougher choices than the one that lay before him and Captain Rogers now, but none that filled him with such anxiety, such insecurity of mind and fear of misstep as this one. On the mountain, choosing to send Péter and Natacha away had been the clear choice for all that it was agonizing.

!” Tony jerked, cursing as Steve gagged and reared his head back, chest heaving with coughs. It wasn’t a laughing matter, but he couldn’t help but laugh at the utterly affronted expression Steve was giving his cock. As if to say,
“Hey, stay with me Cap.” Tony cajoled, continuing the gentle motion of his hands rubbing over Steve’s skin. He was being distracting on purpose, purposefully making light of what he’d suffered just keep Steve grounded. Maybe he could feel it, how close to the edge Steve was. Hell he could probably see it, Steve wasn’t doing the best job hiding the insanity bubbling inside his head right now.
She did not look back as she slid into the back seat of the car alongside Thor’s brother.
pungent in his nose, and then he heard it, the sound of low groaning that seemed to pull him forward like a magnet until he’d walked halfway to the bed without realizing it.
It was too dangerous to discuss the operation over the line, so Steve was left with nothing but second-hand information.  For the length of the journey he did his best to turn off the howling in his head that had driven him from Charlotte and the children. Natacha's face and the words she'd last spoken to him haunted him in place of his fears that Bucky and Tony had perished in the rescue attempt.
Had Stansilov even looked for them? The answer was staring him in the face. Of course he hadn’t. Why would he? Why would he devote time and energy to finding Tony’s grandparents when they were nothing but a stain on the company image, when Stansilov had gotten everything he’d ever wanted with Hughard’s death and Tony out of the way?
Tony had brought happiness and if it wasn't the poetry Peggy had been so fond of, it was enough for Steve to know that where Stark was concerned he intended to deny himself nothing. That was perhaps the good thing about Tony being male. He wouldn't care that Steve had never been good with words. But he might still appreciate a gesture or two, and if having his own designated work space would keep the monk out of trouble for five minutes it would be a worthy enough investment all around.
A startled laugh scraped from his throat and Bucky’s lips tilted in a sad grin.  Steve’s legs felt weak, like he might fall down. All this time and Bucky had known. Hadn’t cared. All this time.
Steve tuned out the sound of Tony questioning the man selling fish, because they asked the same questions every day and received so many of the same answers. Tony did most of the talking because his Italian was better, but Steve’s was good enough that he could tell the difference between ‘
“But how did you get these plans?” Steve wondered, fear jolting through him. God if Tony had stolen these, someone would have noticed. They’d figure it out and they’d kill him.
Tony had to bite his tongue to avoid saying all the things that welled up in response to that because Rogers, damn him, looked hopeful for the first time in their acquaintance and it had nothing to do with Tony but his damned name.
"Turns out Stefen rarely does what people expect him to." Tony offered in answer to the unspoken question of what on earth he thought he was doing. He heaved a small exasperated sigh. It was tinged with amusement, because Bruce must think him mad staying in Austria, flouncing into prison camps disguised as a catholic official and exploding buildings just for the fun of it.
With Stefen towering over him the way he was, it was almost comical how young fourteen suddenly appeared. Still a child in too many ways, Tony thought with a miserable pang, but on its heels, was the bitter acceptance that Péter was no more in a child's world than Natasha was.
“They have every reason to be afraid!” Rogers shouted and Tony fell silent, taken back by the anguish twisting his features, the stark pain flashing in the blue of his eyes and Tony drew in a breath of sudden realization.
"Tony, I don't intend to.” Stefen refuted quietly, to Tony’s surprise.
“You can’t or you won’t? You can’t fight every battle Stefen. It’s not on you to save Austria, but you do have a responsibility to save your children. They don’t need a martyr, they need their father!”
“If I were you Herr Stark, I’d be more concerned with who is monitoring you.”
“Look at you,” Schmidt sneered down at him, his face swimming above Steve. “Down in the dirt with the rats.”
Through the door you've opened
“Relax Harry. You don’t really think one little girl was behind the X-Men. Do you?”
"To help. I know. And you did. But now they want you to do the same for the Reich."
Steve. We put him through a lot, and writing the scene where he's forced to deal with his attraction to Tony was weeks of back and forth and planning for us. lol writing the nuances behind sex is difficult (so please let us know what you thought)!
Good, good, good. The good Austrians could clean it up.
“Are you with me?”
He meant it. Tony and the children were safe for the moment, and he had Bucky by his side. It was the only thing in the world that mattered.  Whatever Charlotte chose to do next they’d weather it together like they weathered everything else.
And that is why Natacha found him hours later stooped over a table in the day room transforming the curtain’s Hammer had instructed the maids to throw away after James’ fit into seven pairs of matching jumpers.
BANG. Another miss.
Dinner that night was a quiet affair. The air of misery that had been hovering all afternoon had not dissipated, settling comfortably over the children's heads like the wettest of blankets. Even Sara seemed to know it was a night to be miserable. The only time any of them had spoken was when Natacha had asked if any word had come from their father.
Steve shrugged, tilting his mouth in a smirk.
He glanced once more at Stefen, noticing this time that the tips of his fingers were stained black. There in the middle of the room with his bare feet and dirty fingers sipping on his coffee he should have looked ridiculous. But of course he didn't, Tony sighed. The word adorable came to mind, and promptly made his brain feel like it might melt and leak out his ears.
“Let’s go to bed.” He murmured when they parted once more, his forehead pressed to Tony’s.
“It'll be fine, Sir. I’m just a poor man, not a wanted one.” Sam laid a hand on his shoulder briefly, too aware of the houses numerous eyes. He was right. He wasn’t a wanted man. No not yet.
Willamina was up before the rest of the house, already deep in preparations for the morning meal with lunch and supper hardly waiting their turn. She'd been in the middle of an argument with Hammer when Tony arrived, loudly proclaiming that she'd served the Rogers family for going on fifteen years and she'd thank him to remember it.
“I count on it,” he sighed.
“Of Captain Rogers pride of the Gebirgstruppe? Yes. But Stefen Rogers?” Stef’s gaze snapped back to him all the intensity from before returned to crackle in the air, all of his focus on Tony. Just how Tony craved it.
Time to say goodbye
Tony heard the underlining threat and could hear Maria again pleading ‘
But that didn’t make them untrue.
“Ah, so is that where your heart truly lies?” Tony teased. “Through your stomach?”
Don’t die for them. They don’t deserve you. They never did.
“Not since half past one. The operators found it necessary to be at home if you can believe that. What do you think, was it the lateness of the hour or the smoke outside the window that did it?”
“You absolutely were.” Tony mustered up a smile from somewhere. “You all win.”
“Why the hell not?” Bucky demanded, but it was Stefen who answered.
“An operative will bring them to your residence where they will need to stay until the boat leaves from Belgium. When the boat is in dock we’ll come and get them. This money is for their upkeep, and for you to make arrangements for transport to London for yourself and Frank.” Steve waved one of the envelopes and slipped it across the table. “When we pull Ret and the others out of Dachu you’ll need to be gone before the police come looking here. A number is in there to get in contact with the professor. You know what code to give him.”
Tony murmured, “No problem,” from where he stood, still reeling from the decisions being made around him. He turned a glare a Bucky as soon as Steve closed the door to the bathroom to which the other man just laughed at. He asked Tony what was wrong as he continued to laugh in Tony’s direction. “Oh I don’t know, maybe the fact that I don’t want to stop fucking you for any period of time let alone a month. Why the fuck did you agree to that?”
Moaning into Bucky’s kiss, Tony’s body shuddered at the lack of effort it took Bucky maneuver him. Bucky’s tongue dominated its way through Tony’s mouth before massaging it with his own. The way Tony’s mouth was being devoured, as if Bucky was marking his territory by touching every part, caused his hips to shift forward seeking relief. He was so lost in sensations that Tony didn’t notice Bucky moving them. Bucky broke their kiss when he sat on the edge of his bed, Tony still wrapped around Bucky straddling his lap. Bucky gently removed his shirt before moving to undo the button of his jeans and pull at the zipper.
Bucky smirked shifting his hips, causing Tony’s lips to part as his eye’s fluttered. “Should probably lay you down if we’re going to be banging into
I just said.”
The harsh laugh Tony exhaled with a breath was laced with pain and bitterness. He stared at the man in front of him, shaking his head he sighed thinking maybe it was for the best. Steve would leave, would move on and finally, maybe…
Tony shrugged back saying, “In my defense, knowing how people were back then it was a logical conclusion. You’re definitely not wading through any one night stands since you were defrosted…”
But he really would.
Crossing back to his open trunk he reached for a stack of trousers. He paused, clutching them in his hands as he took a breath. You don’t get anything without effort.
It was hard for Tony to concentrate on the children’s lessons that day, or not to worry that he’d not heard anything more about the runner who was supposed to collect tonight’s message. Stefen had said only that he would meet Tony at midnight in the garden, though how Stefen expected a man to sneak into their garden in the dead of night Tony didn’t know.
Ian clenched his jaw and opened his book again. He'd made a clear little space for himself in the midst of James mess. He sat the book on his legs and turned the page, scratching the bare bit of ankle that peeked out from under his folded legs, his jaw set, determined to wait Tony out.
as punishment for missing morning prayers… well it was a good thing Tony wasn’t in the habit of eating regular meals.
“Tony?” a little voice that Tony would have called sweet at any other hour whined. “I have to use the bathroom.”
And Steve had loved her with everything in him and gotten the life he’d never thought to have. He'd been glad that the old fear that he was incapable of loving a woman had proved to be false. He was capable, but Bucky was right.
“Your father gave you orders I see.”
“You should hear the rumors going around. It’s indecent for you to be shacked up here, playing nurse maid!” The woman was hissing like a riled-up cat at Charlotte, pacing the length of the drawing room with anxious strides. Charlotte for her part looked deceptively relaxed from her seat, watching.
Tony hauled the sled and had Ian follow behind, obscuring their progress with a branch of pine. It wouldn’t be enough; he knew that, but it had snowed off and on very faithfully the past two months. He could only hope the snow came again soon and did the rest.
He knew he wouldn't be.
“What are they going to do if you’re...indisposed as you were this morning? The quicker you have someone on your side.” she huffed a breath through her nose, her lips pursed. No doubt the memory of that morning turning over in her head.
“They can’t be put back together once they come apart.”
Tony opened his mouth to politely refuse, but something about Stefen’s soft smile made the breath catch in his chest. He looked so boyishly proud that he could have been Artur just then as he slowly extended the package Tony had all but forgotten was under his arm.
He felt a twinge of jealousy at the ease with which Tony dealt with the children. He never seemed to struggle with what to say like Steve did, or looked like he felt too big in his own body and in danger of going off from one moment to the next.
Péter didn't know why she resisted making friends when months ago joining the league had been all she could talk about. Her bedroom was still covered in clippings and magazines lauding a woman's role as wife and mother, and nobody scored hirer than she did in the eugenics classes the girls were all required to take.
and continuing till morning, the German police came to the homes of Jews who had previously immigrated from Poland with orders to round them up for deportation. There was no consideration for the illegality of this action. Immigrants who have long thought themselves German and held the documentation to support that fact, now found themselves classified as aliens.
Major Heinrich Dvořák desk was littered with letters. Each one more vital than the last. It was all creating a tremendous pressure behind his eyes. Shit he was tired.
When Artur tugged on his hand for his attention Tony ignored the squabbling of his brothers for the moment to focus on the younger boy. He figured it was safe enough, as there were no projectiles being thrown yet and no blood.
When he would try to recall the moment, the only thing Steve would remember with clarity would be the way the news hit him, like a physical blow.
Her voice was still small and trembling, but her gaze hidden from the officer’s view was unflinching as she stared back at him.
“That I never doubted, Ian. Thank you.”
“I wanted to speak with you before your visit with Frauline Werner tomorrow. It means a great deal for the future of this family." He began and Natacha narrowed her eyes.
He abandoned his examination of Tony’s chest to get to the very urgent task of opening his slacks and Tony helped. But he’d barely kicked them away before he was pushing Steve back and tugging his jacket and shirt the rest of the way off. That was rather a good idea actually. Steve didn’t want any barriers between them when he laid Tony down upon that bed. Thank god for his presence of mind.
Not very smart, for a Genius.
“Both of you are alike in that way. Difficult to discern.”
"Good." Relieved, Bucky threw an arm around his neck and pulled him close, a grateful smile tugging at his lips as he let their foreheads knock gently together.
There was no plan. No fix for this.  They’d been taken off guard and now the enemy had the upper hand. Tony couldn’t hide the chest in Stefen’s study and he couldn’t get into the attic to destroy the radio, and both of those things had been discovered and taken in for evidence.
