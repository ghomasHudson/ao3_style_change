When no one could answer Mr. Dixon's question, he just sneered. "If that ever happens again, the whole class gets detention!" He yelled before turning back to the blackboard.
But Moriarty just cackled again, not even flinching at the gun pointed at his face. "Of course I can't kill Sherlock
"You have her all wrong," said Sherlock, smiling. Molly's interest in helping them had actually inspired him in a way, and he was a lot happier and more energized than he had been this morning. "You see her as timid and afraid because the last time we saw her she was so shaken up, but she's actually quite courageous. I could see it in her eyes when she was talking. She longs for excitement, like me and you.
"On the contrary," Sherlock retorted just as quietly, "I am quite probably the most honest person in this room."
! It's the weak man's emotion; the most vicious, destructive, inhibiting thing there is, and anyone who lets themselves feel it is an imbecile!"
"Then don't," said Greg, quickly standing up to lead him to his own bed. "You can tell me about it in the morning. Get some sleep."
"Why yes, of course," he responded sarcastically. "That was my goal all along, you see. I actually paid Sherlock Holmes to put a bullet in my leg, just so I could sabotage us all. Because screw all those months of hard work and planning on our part, right?"
They had been at this stupid party for nearly an hour and a half, and John was more than ready to go home. Most of the others who had been at the party had either stumbled home themselves by now, or were passed out drunk on the floor. John had nudged Sherlock several times throughout the night, hoping his friend would give up on whatever he was trying to do here and let them leave, but every time Sherlock had simply waved him off, hardly so much as looking at him.
"Of course I'm fucking awake," Sherlock growled. "You don't tend to sleep a lot when you're thinking about how someone wants to murder you."
that Jim Moriarty was still alive and in their building, and likely plotting revenge against them for screwing up his plan.
"Believe me," said Mycroft, enjoying Greg's muscular arms wrapped around him and hugging him back just as tightly. "I do."
Though this broke his heart, Seb tried his best not to take it personally. It helped that Jim never showed interest in anyone else either. He just wished that not being loved back didn't hurt so much.
Both Sebastian and Irene stared at him with confused expressions. Jim sighed. Such small minds he was forced to be around. "Look, the original plan was to get his attention, and then get him to come to us, right?"
The undertone with which his dad said the last part made John gulp. He would've given anything to be back at the police station being interrogated right now.
Greg would still be there, he knew it. His roommate had barely gone to meals all week, choosing instead to sleep in late and go to bed early. When he
Suddenly, Mycroft was on the floor, having been tackled by his muscular roommate who saw no other way of getting his attention. Greg was sitting on Mycroft's legs and had his arms pinned down above his head, leaning down so that their faces were inches apart. Mycroft fell completely silent. He even stopped breathing. Everything was erased from his mind, and he was aware of nothing except the position he and Greg were in, and what it was doing to his heart.
"You won't kill him," Mycroft confirmed in a monotone, glancing back at Greg once more. "After I'm....you won't, you
And that was the beginning of his obsession. But certainly not where it ended, oh no, not even close. Because Jim learned a lot more about Sherlock Holmes over the next few months, including what the boy looked like, and he found that the more he knew about him, the more his feelings began to....change.
The two were able to work silently for about three minutes before the door burst open, causing both their heads to snap up. Sherlock stumbled in, looking for a moment like he had just been mugged. His coat was hanging off his shoulders and his normally crisp, button up shirt was rumpled. His hair was a complete wreck, like it had been yanked violently in several places, and his face had a wild, manic look to it.
"But that still doesn't explain why Jim cares so much!" Sherlock continued. His eyes were darting around with incredible speed as he paced, searching his mind palace frantically for answers while he ranted. "I mean, he obviously wants to murder me eventually, but why? Does he see me as a threat to his father's operation? Why me and not my brother? I'm not even in the secret service! What does he want from me?! Urggggh!" Frustrated at not knowing, Sherlock picked up one of his textbooks from his desk and threw it against the wall.
Sherlock snapped his head up suddenly. His grey eyes looked vacant and unfocused, and John knew that his mind was working a million miles an hour, making deductions that the other two couldn't even begin to understand. After a few seconds his eyes widened, as if the final piece of whatever puzzle he had been building in his mind had finally clicked into place. He smiled. "Oh, this is too good," he said.
listen to me," Mycroft begged. "I know that I hurt you, and I'm sorry! Believe me, I can't express how sorry I am. But I don't want you to leave." And as Mycroft said it, he knew it was true. Even though he had tried to distance himself when he realized he had feelings for Greg, there was no way he could live without seeing him everyday at this point. "You're the only person I've ever really wanted to be around!"
"Don't worry Molly Hooper, it was nothing that concerns you. Now, as for Moriarty," Sherlock finally began his explanation while Molly fumed. "I remember his case exactly. For the brutal murder of his sister he was sentenced to a year in an asylum and four additional years in a behavioral correction facility. That's why he's here. However, he's known about me for a long time. I know how and why he's heard of me now, but I still don't know
"Because someone's about to die, I'm sure of it!" said Sherlock. "I'm not sure who, and I'm afraid to find out."
"I know," John said, not at all offended. "My dad wants me to. He thinks being in a sport is a sign of manliness, or whatever. Bottom line, I've got no choice in the matter."
Well shit, he had him there. Not that Mycroft was going to let it show. The only way to quit loving Lestrade, he decided, was to once again shut off his emotions completely.
"Based on what I've heard," Harvey practically whispered, "both from your teachers and Mr. Jacobsen here, I think you are more than intelligent enough to come up with a story like that on the spot. I also think you are a liar. An evil, rotten, devious little liar."
When Irene finally pulled away, Sherlock wasted no time. "What is it?" he repeated. "Why does Moriarty want to kill me?"
"You're right," he said, rubbing his neck in embarrassment. "I'm sorry. You hardly know me, and I've been unloading all my crap on you. It's just that....sorry. I-I'll shut up now. But by the way, my name is-"
"Myc," whispered Greg, his breath still hot against his lips, and Mycroft could taste him on every atom in his mouth, and god dammit he was
By the time they were finished, the only proof left that anything had happened in this room was the broken window, and Viktor's body on the ground below.
Sighing, Greg stood up from his own bed to join Mycroft at his. The latter boy tried desperately to ignore how his heart sped up at the increased proximity. And even more so when Greg took hold of his hand.
He then continued to tell John what a huge disappointment he had always been, how he wasn't good at anything, and how a loser like him would never become a doctor.
Mycroft was sure that he and Greg had been sitting silently in the dark cupboard for over half an hour before one of them finally spoke.
" Then, without breaking eye contact with Mycroft, Moriarty yelled in the direction of the still-open stairwell to the roof. "Sebastiaaaan," he sang. "Bring him in."
you. I should've sold you out to the police when I had the chance. Now, my last year before university is ruined, because I had to try to protect you. I had to fucking
He groaned, putting his head in his hands. There were certain times when Mycroft wished that he could un-genius both Sherlock and himself. He knew that most of their major problems would disappear if they became just as stupid as the rest of the world, particularly whatever made it difficult for them to deal with emotions. That was why Mycroft had always taught Sherlock not to care; things were just easier that way.
"Do you think I'm a fool, Irene?" Sherlock asked. "You turned to pour yourself a drink several times, yet you haven't been drunk this entire night. You've been turning to look at the clock. Waiting for a deadline."
But instead, John set the instrument down and sat on Sherlock's bed. "What's the matter with you?" He asked, sounding more concerned than annoyed. "Can't sleep or something?"
Groaning loudly at his own failure as a brother, Mycroft threw his phone against the wall. He heard the screen shatter, but he didn't care. He just sank to the ground and put his head in his hands, knowing that he'd definitely be crying if he hadn't run out of tears long ago.
Sherlock sighed and took a bite of the apple, filing away John's suspicious concern for his health in the already-too-extensive John room in his mind palace.
The second Mycroft dropped his gun was the second Moriarty seemed to realize he had the boy completely under his control. Mycroft's heart sank even further as he realized that he wouldn't get to die peacefully. Moriarty was going to have his fun first.
"Of course," said Sherlock, not taking his eyes off Irene. "It's almost 9:45." He seemed to be expecting some sort of reaction out of her.
"Jim what are you-?" Seb tried to ask, confused as to what the boy was doing sitting by his bedside, instead of attending to more important things.
Not only was the room empty, but there were obvious signs of a struggle. A desk was tipped over, papers scattered everywhere, and there was a huge splatter of blood on the back wall. It was almost as if....
Jim thought, putting his mind at ease with a simple realization. Sherlock would definitely show up, there was no doubt about it. The Sherlock he knew would never walk away from a shot at danger. A chance to find answers, to cure his boredom....
He said goodbye to his own gift of advanced metacognition that he had always taken for granted over the years. And he prepared to step off the roof.
"He's been out to get me since the school year started," Sherlock explained. "He's also been observing me from the beginning. Presumably, he noticed that Viktor was the first person I didn't get along with and thought it would be clever to brutally harm him. He obviously threatened him with even more intense violence if he didn't blame the attack on me."
Greg listened calmly as Mycroft blurted out the story and, much to Mycroft's surprise, did not look at him with disgust when Mycroft told him what he had done to Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed in frustration as he continued wandering the hall with his eyes on the ground, hardly looking where he was going.
Mycroft hadn't bothered to look in a mirror at any point over the course of the night, but he had spent over an hour in the middle of a storm and had almost been forced to kill himself, so he didn't doubt that Greg was right. "Everything," Mycroft answered. "But honestly....I'm not sure I can talk about it right now...." For it was right then that Mycroft realized just how exhausted he was, both physically and mentally.
"You made it my concern when you told him about me!" Sherlock shouted back. John had never seen him this angry. "So anything that happens to me will be YOUR fault!"
When they reached the second floor and turned left, Molly suddenly jerked away. "I can't be here," she said. "It's the boys' wing-"
John smiled as he looked at Sherlock's face, first focusing on his eyes, then on his lips. He wondered what it would be like to....
Mycroft tried to return to his planning, but gave up after a couple minutes. Far too distracted at this point, he decided to give thinking a break, and settled instead for watching Greg as he threw the ball up into the air and caught it with impressive reflexes.
unrest ensued. The silence was broken first by shocked murmurs, followed by terrified screams. Heads turned, eyes darting around the room and - unsurprisingly- several pairs found Sherlock.
, of course, but it still bothered him. And he did regret what he had said to Sherlock the other night.
Another quiet rumble, and a brief flash in the distance. Maybe if he opened his umbrella, the lightening would find him and strike him down.
Sure enough, about two minutes later. "No....no. This is unacceptable!" Frantically, Sherlock started flipping through the other Harry Potter books sitting on his desk. "Where in this series does it say that thrown inanimate objects can travel with apparating wizards?!"
"Positive," said Sherlock. "Believe me John, if it was anything you needed to know, I would tell you."
Irene giggled, ignoring his question and taking a long sip of her drink. She never broke eye contact with Sherlock as she drank, staring intently at him from underneath her heavily mascaraed eyelashes.
Sherlock, however, was not the slightest bit intimidated as he sat himself in between Viktor and John. He knew exactly how this was going to go down.
Forty-seven minutes later, Sherlock stood outside the agreed-upon meeting place: an abandoned hospital parking lot in the shittiest part of Eastern London. Sherlock had tried to convince the bloke that this was possibly the most obvious meeting place in the history of drug deals, but was sent the response, "Do you want the drugs or not, prick?"
Yes, Sherlock had lied to Molly Hooper slightly. The file he was looking through had a lot to do with Moriarty. It
"YOU WERE!!!" Sherlock shoved him forcefully. He wasn't just angry, he was the most angry Mycroft had ever seen him. More angry than the night Mycroft had told him he regretted his existence. More angry than when he had found out Mycroft had betrayed his secrets to Moriarty. Even more angry than that day by the tin shed, during a storm much like this one, when the two of them had wrestled in the mud for hours out of fury at each other, and screamed those hateful things.
Next, John noticed Molly in the very front. Unlike both Irene and himself, she sat upright and alert, watching Harvey at the podium while she dutifully waited for him to start speaking. At first glance, it seemed like she was just being her normal, perfect-student self. But upon closer examination, it was hard to miss the dark half-circles beneath her lower lids that her eyes themselves seemed to disregard completely. Though she hid it well, for her too it was a struggle to remain awake.
The headmaster was a short, round, and balding man named Mr. Harvey. Though Sherlock and probably two thirds of the student population were at least a head taller than him, he had a certain aura of intimidation about him, as well as a glare so frightening that even the school's biggest delinquents have been known to squirm under it.
It should not have bothered Mycroft that his roommate hadn't so much as looked at him in over a week. He shouldn't have even noticed that Greg was no longer suave and witty with him, that he never made jokes or asked those bothersome questions anymore, or that the crooked smile that Mycroft had come to love no longer flashed his way.
"Life is boring," he finally said. "People and classes and the whole goddamn world. It's all so mundane and repetitive, and my brain is-" he stopped suddenly. What the hell was he doing? He had just met this boy yesterday, and he was about to bare his goddamn soul to him? No way.
Mycroft's eyes, which were fluttering at first, became wide and alert in an instant. He almost bolted upright, his mind flooded with questions and curiosities, ready to dart to the window and start making deductions....
Now, Mycroft ran into his dorm, ignored his concerned roommate, and did the exact same thing, cursing himself between every bang of his head.
The first thing John noticed was that it was possibly the most beautiful sound he had ever heard. The way the bow seemed to gently kiss the strings, producing long, silky notes was perfection, and might've lulled John back to sleep....had it not been so terribly loud.
Sherlock thought, memories of yesterday's fight flooding back to him. He never wanted to see his brother again.
John chuckled under his breath, and pretty soon the passing of the notebook became a distraction within itself.
"The room number is 221 B," she said in her bored, nasally voice. "Your roommate should already be in there."
The bully looked up at the older, brown haired boy making his way toward them. "What's gotten into you, mate? Put that poor kid down!"
John just smirked. "Who needs breakfast? Isn't it the most overrated meal of the day? Cereal propaganda and all that?"
let anything happen to him," Sherlock said, speaking in a much lower voice. "And I don't see what concern it is of yours what our 'relationship' is-"
Mycroft smirked, but his eyes were hard with anger. "Same way you managed to find yourself a drug dealer. You have your homeless network, I have my own spies. But that's besides the point."
Jim turned to him with a scowl, irritated by his friend's lack of faith. "It's still going to work!" he snapped. "It just....needs some adjustments."
Luckily, Irene was facing the direction of the open doorway and did not notice. Taking advantage of this, Sherlock opened his eyes all the way and observed her face. She appeared both nervous and irritated, and had a distinct countenance of longing. She obviously wished to join the excitement up on the roof, and resented the fact that she was stuck down here.
Mycroft didn't answer. He just read the two sentences over and over again, growing incredibly numb as he did so.
They shared a laugh and continued on to their room, leaving Mycroft and Greg to sit in the darkened supply cupboard in stunned silence, working desperately to calm down their hearts and to summon the courage to leave.
For Sherlock, it was like looking into a mirror. Not because the brothers looked any more alike than usual, but because they currently shared the same dark eyes, wild hair, and look of near starvation. Both boys were stressed beyond belief.
"However," he paused to meet the eyes of some of the students who looked especially troublesome. "I hope you know that I do
"I was emailing my secretary important information to send to my supervisor in Russia regarding our engagement in Hong Kong, that's all."
Sherlock shook his head. "Not all of it. Yes, my brother lives, but I think it's safe to assume that my own fate is sealed.
"Ireland..." His face showed sudden realization, and then he laughed. "Ah, yes. This does make it more interesting. You're still a dick, though," and with that he shoved Mycroft to the floor.
"I tried, but there was nothing open for them to move me to. That's the only reason you're still stuck with me. But if someone gets kicked out or something, don't worry. I'll be first in line to move into their room."
After the three boys left and went their separate ways, Mycroft returned to panicking about the job he had been asked to do. He was not unaware that he hadn't yet sent his angry reply before being forced to shut his laptop, but now he wasn't sure if he should. The consequences of breaking his contract would be detrimental to his future, and there really wasn't anything else he wanted to do in life.
John watched him read with fascination. He loved how he seemed to let his guard down entirely as he read, allowing his facial expressions to change dramatically, displaying exactly what he was feeling. It was something that he never did any other time.
Mycroft smirked, despite himself. He hadn't been in a class with his younger brother since that year in primary school when everyone had to learn the recorder (which had taken both boys about sixty seconds). He had forgotten how much Sherlock enjoyed disrespecting teachers. It was really quite entertaining.
"Are you alright?" John asked Sherlock quietly. His voice warned against any lie his roommate might reply with.
leaves," Sherlock replied, motioning to his Mycroft. "Wouldn't want my dear brother giving out anymore of my personal information for his business, now, would we?"
to bring a friend?" John couldn't help bringing up, even though he was secretly thrilled that Sherlock had insisted he come along. They were on their way to Irene's room, Sherlock dressed in his finest shirt and slacks under his usual coat, while John had chosen to stick to his jeans and t shirt (not admitting that he didn't really own anything nicer). Molly had chosen to stay in their room and do homework, having no desire to tarnish her "unpopular nerd" reputation by attending a party.
"Hold on," said John, the incident from earlier coming back to him suddenly. "Speaking of people being threatened, I met Molly's roommate today, and I'm a bit worried about her situation-"
"Regardless," he redirected icily. "My feelings on the whole matter are irrelevant; it happened and it's over. What's more important is planning ahead-"
"....To be honest," said Sherlock, and it was incredibly painful for him to admit this, "I'm still kind of figuring that out."
"Alright, alright, keep your pants on! It was just an idea," the girl backtracked. Although she hid it rather well, she was obviously afraid of Moriarty and did not want to make him mad.
They had quite a bit of fun with this, both of them claiming to have been arrested for brutally assaulting their previous chemistry teachers. John said he stabbed his in the neck with a pencil. Sherlock topped this with a frighteningly detailed story involving hydrochloric acid and it's effects on the human body.
time but the wee hours of the morning, John might've sat back and enjoyed the beautiful sound. But at four-fucking-thirty in the morning, he wished he had a rock to throw at his roommate.
"That's not the worst part, though," Sherlock continued, his eyes narrowing as he recalled the incident. "He knows who I am."
But Mycroft couldn't. Because there was one person in this world that Mycroft cared about very much, and that was his little brother Sherlock.
"I get it," said John, removing his hand. Sherlock sighed in both relief and disappointment. "I'll leave you alone."
"All in good time, Molly dear," he muttered, not glancing up from the screen, but John thought he glimpsed the smallest hint of a smirk. He seemed to enjoy keeping Molly waiting, as if her growing frustration amused him.
Much like every other student in the school with more than a single brain cell, Jim never attended the required Behavioral Corrections class. Instead, he often spent first period roaming the empty hallways, thinking and plotting.
The boys marched upstairs. As soon as they reached their landing, Mycroft shoved Sherlock to the floor.
"I'm so sorry," whispered Mycroft, still knowing that it was inexcusable. He began to cry as well. How could he have let himself be so weak as to forget that Sherlock needed him? How could he have been so selfish?
And just like that, the second was over. Irene straightened up, all of her possessions safely returned to her handbag, and Moriarty glanced away.
Then, because the girl wouldn't get the hell off of him, and because Sherlock did not know what else to do, he pointed the gun towards the open doorway at the top of the stairs and fired.
"You've done well," Jim assured her. Then, to add to the compliment, he went ahead and tossed her a wad of notes from his pocket.
"It's not just about the money, and you know it!" Irene practically growled. "Mycroft Holmes has interfered with my affairs for the last time. I want him finished-"
Sherlock still seemed to be under the impression that John was up to speed with his latest revelation, without him having to explain anything. But of course, John was still quite confused. Suddenly, Molly's manipulative roommate– who, John recalled unpleasantly, had been sucking Sherlock's face mere hours before– was a murderer in collaboration with Moriarty. How Sherlock had come to this conclusion John still had no idea, but he didn't bother asking.
"Okay....well, when I walked outside I turned straight into the alley, which is where I usually go. And they almost seemed to be waiting for me-"
, overambitious teenage boy with an unhealthy obsession with my brother, and I just know that Sherlock is part of his plan somehow."
Sherlock didn't know if older brothers were naturally born with this irritating ability or what, but Mycroft always seemed to sense when Sherlock was "up to no good", even in the middle of the night. It was quite annoying, and extremely inconvenient.
detective!" Mycroft sank to the floor, his head in his hands. "Everything is so fucked up now," he muttered.
As tedious as it was, Sherlock forced himself to devote a decent fragment of his attention to the stupid assembly. He took careful note of the new rules and policies that Harvey was listing off, which he knew he would need to follow to a T under the watchful eyes of the school's new security guards. The guards who would undoubtedly be keeping a very close eye on Sherlock specifically. That is, if he wasn't immediately expelled and imprisoned for murder.
"I'd rather not think about it anymore, truthfully," Sherlock replied. He sounded ancient all of a sudden, his voice weighted with a thousand worries. "I'd much rather go to bed one more time pretending that everything's going to be okay in the morning."
Sherlock trudged into chemistry class with John the next morning, hardly able to stand upright. He had gotten even less sleep last night than he had the night before, finishing the last Harry Potter book at around 3 am and lying awake thinking for the next several hours. Also, he hadn't eaten anything since that apple John gave him over thirty hours ago, and he had eaten nothing for days before that. He refused to admit it to himself, but he honestly felt like he was about to pass out.
feel this, and I will walk away right now. I'll leave you alone; give you all the space you want. Just tell me."
"We've been looking everywhere for you! We called all your friends. We were just about to call the police."
"It's okay," John repeated in a comforting tone, apparently unaware that his friend was now shaking for an entirely different reason.
It annoyed the older Holmes boy immensely that Lestrade seemed to think being roommates automatically made them friends. He thought of voicing this complaint in third period history, when Lestrade's constant jabbering made it difficult for Mycroft to pretend to pay attention, but....something about the way Greg smiled when he talked to him, something Mycroft couldn't quite explain, made him reluctant to say anything that might hurt his feelings.
Irene bit her lip. "I have a theory. I've thought a lot about it, and it seems the most plausible...."
John opened the book to see where Sherlock was at, and when he saw the part he was approaching, he almost didn't want to let Sherlock read it. It was possibly one of the most painful parts of the entire series. But he needed to get his mind off of Moriarty.
John thought, snorting internally. From the way Sherlock raised an eyebrow next to him, John knew he was thinking the same thing.
"Oh, don't you worry about him," Jim responded, mysteriously. "You'll find out soon enough. For now, you just focus on your responsibilities. I've got mine all under control."
have, because it was his older brother's case file that he had hacked into, but it did. And now he knew what Mycroft clearly had no interest in telling him. He knew what Mycroft's next assignment was, and why.
At the opposite end of the roof, the three villains were paying no attention to the moment happening several feet away. They were all a bit busy panicking.
He wasn't sure what it said about him that his opinion of his friend never changed. That he visited Jim every week in that goddamn nut house, and on the day of his release their friendship continued like nothing had happened, except they began spending all their time plotting revenge against the Holmes family....
He had always thought that he was the only twelve-year-old on Earth who was interested in the science of deduction, but apparently not.
Harvey had to tap the microphone again to recapture everyone's attention. "Students, students please!" But the previous stone-like silence was never reclaimed. All he could manage was to turn the screams back to murmurs.
But Mycroft tapped him twice on the arm: their mutual signal for when someone was asking a rhetorical question and the other didn't realise it.
Turns out, he didn't need to. Without warning, Irene climbed on top of Sherlock and straddled him, causing her tiny dress to ride up to hip level and exposing her black thong. He was incredibly glad that the room was dim enough that she couldn't see his intense blush. She kissed him with even greater force than she had earlier.
He looked around frantically for something familiar, feeling like a little boy who lost his mum in a supermarket.
"Yes, let's not even pretend that we both don't know who I'm working for," Irene said. She spoke casually, as if they were discussing a school assignment instead of her affiliation with a vicious murderer. She pulled her feet up onto the sofa, leaning into Sherlock suggestively. It took all the boy's willpower not to tense up. "But like I said, I was different when I joined him. For one, I was desperately and pathetically in love with him," she laughed, seeming to cringe at the very memory of this, while Sherlock stared at her in disbelief. "What can I say? He's intelligent. But that was before-" she stopped, obviously realizing she was about to say too much. "Never mind. The point is, that was my main reason for joining him."
Mycroft did not blame his roommate in the least for hating him. The things he had yelled that day in the supply cupboard out of pure frustration had been awful, many would say unforgiveable. Still, Mycroft had considered apologizing several times over the past week, and had almost done so on some occasions. Except every time he'd made eye contact with Greg since that day, the latter had given him a glare so full of rage, Mycroft had to look away.
Greg rolled his eyes. "Oh please. You think you're so mysterious, but I can read you like a book. It's obvious that you care about your brother, no matter how much you two fight."
which he is generally inclined to take as an insult, sounded so lovely coming from John. Almost as lovely as his hand felt over his.
"Yeah. I think he got off for a combination of young age and mental instability, though. They locked him up in an asylum for a year."
There were a few awkward seconds of silence. Greg rarely lost his cool, blasé attitude when it came to school work. It appeared that he really did care underneath it all, however.
And that was the rest of the truth. Though embarrassed to admit it, seventeen-year-old Mycroft Holmes had never personally killed anyone before, and wasn't entirely sure if he could.
But his body wouldn't move, and something else was telling him that it wasn't the right time. That killing Moriarty now would only seal his brother's fate.
"Right, because you're such a robot!" Greg spat sardonically. "Not someone to be bothered with measly
"Then we'll be late," John said sternly. "I can't believe what I just saw! Why the hell do you let that bitch push you around like that?"
Mycroft rolled his eyes, but didn't bother correcting him. The funny thing was that Mycroft knew twenty different languages, but Mandarin Chinese was not one of them. That one was Sherlock's.
Molly must have noticed how embarrassed Sherlock was about this, because she backed off a little. "Well, I'm sure you'll come up with something. And," she hesitated for a moment, as if not very sure of herself. "Whatever it is, I want in."
Somewhere in the back of his fiercely occupied mind, Mycroft vaguely registered his roommate's voice. However, he did not immediately comprehend it. He was far too busy staring out the window, wondering how the hell he was going to complete the task that he had already agreed to....
Greg was lying face up on his bed, but turned quickly to the side in an attempt to hide his face when Mycroft entered. A second too late, as Mycroft was still sure he saw tears streaming down the boy's cheeks.
"He's on the roof," she told him. "They all are. But don't think you can make it up there in time to save his life."
who he is," Irene snarled. "All I care about is that I have chemistry in two minutes, and I still need to copy your homework. I looked through your bag and I couldn't find it. You've got quite the mess to clean up when you get back, by the way."
going to kill her. She's useful, she knows people, and backstabbing goes against everything I stand for. We're criminals, Seb, not barbarians."
Perhaps it was a placebo, but the food seemed to improve Sherlock's perception almost instantly. His vision was no longer blurred around the edges, and he could now notice things that he hadn't seen a few seconds ago.
Well, aren't you the one who always taught me not to care?" Sherlock said from the floor, knowing that if he got up he would just be pushed back down. "You should really follow your own advice."
"Oh, we're still going to murder someone," Jim said with a shark's grin, as an idea popped into his mind at that moment. "We'll just need to do a little more observation."
Sherlock opened his mouth to answer this rhetorical question, but Mycroft quickly reached up and tapped Sherlock twice between the shoulder blades. He closed his mouth immediately.
Irene made a confused face, and Sherlock took advantage of her momentary distraction by grabbing her gun-yielding arm and twisting it violently, kicking her legs out from under her at the same time. She shrieked and keeled over, quickly losing her grip on the weapon, and just like that Sherlock had overpowered her.
"What about your other jobs?" Jim demanded. He felt a bit guilty about the amount of work Seb had to do tonight. He might've done the first real murder himself, but setting up that fake scene for Mycroft Holmes had taken up a lot of Jim's time.
Just thinking about what he was leaving behind made John shiver, despite the heat. That final image of his shitty excuse of a father beating up his drunken mother on the kitchen floor, while his sister lay drugged up in her room, was enough to traumatize any fourteen-year-old boy. But John had seen it all before, and worse. That was his life.
"Oh, suck it up!" Jim yelled at him. And they retreated down the stairwell, leaving the Holmes brothers on the roof.
John grunted in response, not looking up from his homework, so Sherlock was able to stealthily grab his pack of cigarettes from John's dresser before slipping out the door.
"What?" Sherlock laughed. This was new. "Since when? We've both done it for years. You bought me my first pack for chrissake."
But all Sherlock had to say was, "It's all apart of Moriarty's game, John. Just relax and let me do the talking."
the rational part of him knew to push what had just happened aside. What mattered now was that they made it through the night. Then, maybe later, they'd be able to pick up where they left off....
Sherlock joined the other students in looking around the room for the culprit, although both Mycroft and John had seen him do it.
Sherlock could've easily fought back and overpowered her, but there was a certain emotion behind the deviousness in her bright blue eyes that stopped him. Fear? Or was it a warning?
His father threw a punch that knocked John to the floor, then gave him a savage kick to his ribs. "WHAT DID I JUST SAY-" he gave another kick "ABOUT TALKING-" kick "BACK-" kick "TO ME?!"
Mycroft had to shake his head to clear it of all the nonsense. Greg would be fine. There were more important matters to attend his thoughts to at the moment.
John suddenly remembered one of the things his father had demanded he do while at this school. "Hey, when do those start by the way?" He asked.
The other man laughed and nodded in agreement. "I can't wait to wipe that smug grin off his stupid face!"
"Sit down, boys," the headmaster said, his face unreadable as he motioned the boys to the two remaining chairs. They sat, and Sherlock immediately started making deductions.
By the time John arrived home, it was 3:45 am, and he was practically sleepwalking. Yet, he managed to stay upright as the policeman walked him to his flat and rang the doorbell. And he had just enough energy left to feel fear when his dad opened the door.
Eventually, it was John who did it. He walked up to Sherlock purposefully until they were less than a foot apart, and put a gentle hand on Sherlock's cheek. The latter shuddered visibly at the touch, closing his eyes and leaning into it.
did nothing, John," said Sherlock with a sigh. Moriarty's plan was starting to make a lot more sense to him now. "Except associate yourself with me."
The girl pressed her body against his so that every inch of their torsos was touching. She reached for his right hand (which had dropped the cigarette at some point) and deposited a slip of paper into it, while making sure there was as much contact between their fingers as possible.
A small girl with brown hair and pale skin was cowering against the wall by the alley as two boys blocked her escape, laughing as she cried. One of the boys, to John's horror, was shoving his hand up her shirt. John recognized the girl from their chemistry class. Molly Hooper was her name.
"It's called Baskerville's School for Troubled Teens," the officer continued. "It's what we're recommending to all parents nowadays. It's like a regular boarding school, only it focuses especially on correcting behavioral problems. The school challenges your child both academically and physically...."
"I'm failing every class!" Greg snapped, just as the bell rang. "Except for French, and that's only because I have you to help me!"
Sherlock did not stop when he was a few feet from the pair. Instead, he marched straight up to the blond boy, grabbed him by the shirt, and punched him square in the nose. The boy cried out in pain and collapsed to the ground, his face gushing blood. Sherlock ignored him, extending a hand down to Molly, which she gratefully took. He let go the second she was standing, however, turning to the suited boy.
"No, I will. I just have to finish up this-" Greg cut himself off when he looked up at Mycroft, who was still wearing only a towel around his waist. He had never seen his friend out of a suit before. His eyes widened. "Woah, nice- er, I mean," he blushed. "I...do you play sports?"
"Don't be," Sherlock cut him off. One benefit of being away from home was that he no longer had Mummy breathing down his neck about his eating habits. He did not need a substitute mother. "I eat in private, when I need to, and no more. I don't need your
"I will not! Molly, I know you well enough by now to know that you take pride in your work. You would
As Molly pulled her chair up to John's and Sherlock's table with narrowed eyes, Sherlock found himself wishing that they had been paired with Anderson instead.
But Greg wasn't finished. He left his bed and began pacing the room anxiously. He had clearly needed to say this for a long time. "If anything,
Mycroft wrapped Sherlock in a tight embrace, allowing his little brother to cry into his shoulder, and Sherlock hugged him back. He sobbed something that sounded like,
"Well, I have to get to class," said Molly quickly, attempting to rush out the open door and join the mass of students, but John pulled her back in and shut the door.
So yes, he told them about his brother, who Moriarty evidently already had a file on. "I have a younger brother" was the first thing he could think of to say when confronted with "So, tell me about yourself". Moriarty wanted to know the secret plans of Mycroft's unit, and he chose to sell out Sherlock instead.
Of course, Sherlock ignored them. His previous shock from being forcibly made out with seemed to have vanished, though. Still grinning, Sherlock tossed his coat aside and went into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him.
"No," Sherlock answered simply. "I'm much too involved with my work to engage in ludicrous activities such as dating." John couldn't help but notice that he did not hear an 'I'm not gay.'
he growled. His glare could rival that of a lion's when facing its prey as he rushed towards her, not stopping until he had her backed up against the wall. "I ought to rip your lungs out through your throat."
"What should I read next, John?" Sherlock asked, out of nowhere. He spoke so randomly, in fact, that a startled John slid his pen across his paper mid-sentence, ruining his English essay.
"Quit using those fancy words!" The bully bellowed. "What, you think you're better than me? I can kick your arse, and I will!"
"Here we are, 231 A!" Sherlock announced when they reached their destination. There was already annoying pop music blasting behind the door, in addition to the voices and laughter of what John assumed to be maybe thirty other kids. He couldn't help wondering if Irene had invited any of them the way she had invited Sherlock....
He looked all the way down to the point that he knew was soon to be his final destination. If he squinted through the darkness and the haze of the rain, he thought he could see a dark shape on the ground that disturbingly resembled a dead body. Another part of Moriarty's plan?
The two boys walked to chemistry, with Sherlock still picking bits of pancake out of his hair. "You're lucky I don't like syrup with those," John said, reaching over and running his fingers through Sherlock's curls in an effort to dislodge remaining crumbs.
Mycroft thought, trying desperately to rip his hand away from Greg's. But he simply couldn't; it was as if his hand was frozen in his grasp
been difficult in the past," The boys' mother interjected. At least someone realized this. "I just don't understand it. They're both so intelligent. It's as if they're
Reluctantly, Sherlock took the book and opened it to his saved place. Meanwhile, John sat at his own desk to work on his chemistry homework, and waited.
"I'm sorry," Mycroft said, the words feeling strange and foreign in his mouth. "I have been rather stressed today. There's something I have to do that I'm not sure....I can handle."
John sighed with relief when he realized where he was. This was just the rich side of London. This side of town was safe.
As John read the elegant handwriting, he suddenly felt as though a block of ice had been dropped in his stomach.
Sherlock cut himself off abruptly and turned to look at John, who quickly closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep. He knew that Sherlock saw right through it, though, as he spoke a again in a much lower voice.
"Of course you do. I hope you both know that I have the power to make your lives a living hell, and think better about acting out in my class again. I'll expect you both back here after your classes this afternoon to do lines. Fail to show up, and it'll be something much worse. Disrespect me again, and it'll be something much worse. Got it?"
They had grown up side by side, he and Jim. Hard not to when their fathers were in the same business. Or had been anyway, before Mycroft Holmes and his damned secret service had shut it down and hauled both men off to jail. Seb remembered the raids of their homes vividly, because Jim was already institutionalized at the time and Seb had to deal with losing his dad alone.
eat, Sherlock?" John asked as the two boys sat down for lunch on a Saturday, at their usual table by the window. Or rather, John sat down for lunch while Sherlock simply sat down, once again without a tray.
He checked his gun to make sure it was fully loaded. Time for the final part of Phase 2 of this brilliant plan of his.
After he was dressed but before he headed down to breakfast, he tried to get Sherlock's attention. "Erm...I'm heading down to eat. You coming?"
But it had. And when John opened his eyes to see that his face was still red with embarrassment at himself, he wanted to cry in frustration. Sherlock was bound to notice this. What the hell was wrong with him?
"Yes it is," John assured him, stroking his hand softly. "You're only human. Despite your best efforts." He added that last part with a chuckle.
"...Shit," John said aloud, biting his lip and turning away from Sherlock. He didn't think he could stand seeing Sherlock's grey eyes bore into him, making deductions, drawing conclusions....
Sherlock swung again, but Mycroft grabbed his arm and flipped him over. Sherlock got right back up, however, and ran at him, tackling him to the ground. Once he had his older brother pinned, he attacked him with both fists. He hated Mycroft. He hated every atom of every molecule of every cell in his body. He wanted him to die.
He focused on one rather large teen in particular, who was currently striding into the building. Sherlock could tell by his luggage that he was extremely poor, though the way he carried himself demonstrated that he was cruel and tried much too hard to be intimidating. He wasn't sent here for harming someone else, though. Anyone
Molly bit her lip. "I kind of suspected she'd be after him soon, especially with how everyone's been talking about him. The thing about Irene is....besides being a manipulative bitch, she's sapiosexual. That is, she's extremely attracted to intelligent people."
He sat back on his bed and arranged himself in his classic mind palace position, with his eyes closed and his fingers steepled just below his lips. But before he could begin to think-
He glanced up at John when he entered, his expression of boredom seemingly permanent, his facial muscles unchanging. Except, John noticed, for his eyes. They seemed to dart around constantly in the tiniest incriments, his pupils dilating and contracting as if absorbing pieces of the environment. And when they looked at John, he almost felt as if
Mycroft had been on the roof for nearly an hour. The rain he had anticipated earlier that evening was pouring down by now, forming a thick white sheet that reduced his visibility by half. The boy was drenched and freezing, but still he held his closed umbrella tightly in front of him where he stood.
Sherlock, however, smirked back and pulled a small, grey device out of his pocket: a tape recorder. "I think I'm safe," he said.
But John did not relax; by the time they reached their destination, his heart was hammering in his chest and felt like he was going to faint from anxiety.
John was taken aback. "Really? That's bullshit. You're a bloody genius. Any secret agency would be lucky to have you."
"I'm, uh....going down to breakfast. You coming?" John repeated, since he had clearly not heard him.
gone to Ireland, ignored his phone buzzing with what were undoubtedly coded texts describing his next mission, went upstairs to his room, and slammed his head into the door repeatedly.
Jim's face pulled itself into a shark's grin as he recalled his most recent discovery. Ah, Greg Lestrade. What an interesting addition he made to Jim's original, well-thought-out plot. A useful one, too, and surprisingly easy to incorporate. Jim hadn't initially planned to concern himself much with the older Holmes boy, except to eventually kill him in exchange for Irene's help. But now that he had found a hold on him...oh, there was so much he could do.
"I'm serious, I don't think I've seen you eat one bite of food since I met you. I'm kind of concerned-"
awake, he would still spend most of his time in bed, tossing his football in the air, but with none of the carefree cheerfulness he had once displayed. Instead, his countenance would change from bitterly morose to one so depressed that just seeing him made Mycroft want to pitch himself off the roof.
Sebastian felt the throbbing in his leg before anything else. Before opening his eyes or tuning in to his current surroundings in any way, pain was the first thing on his mind. It was his most prominent memory of the previous nights' events as well. So much had happened— both in terms of successes and failures— and yet it was all so shrouded by recollections of pain and blood and
Mycroft laughed out loud and passed Greg his French notes, forgetting for a moment that he had ever found the boy annoying.
"I'd like to see you try," Sherlock challenged confidently, as if he had not just been doused in breakfast by a boy three times his size.
"Well I wish I could help you Sherlock, but I really need to work on this essay." John said, reaching beneath his desk for a fresh piece of paper.
Immediately after the incident with Sherlock, Jim had dragged his injured comrade up to their dorm and summoned Irene Adler, his only other asset in this godforsaken place, to tend to him while he considered how to proceed. There were so many options. However, many of them included murder, and Jim wasn't sure if it was time for that quite yet. Especially since Sherlock now knew about him.
The boy jumped and looked around frantically, as if unsure of where he was. He then glanced at John in surprise. "I thought you went back to bed."
Mycroft lingered as well, dropping his notebook near where his brother was standing and taking his time to pick up the papers that scattered. He had a feeling he would be needed.
"It wasn't my fault!" Irene protested. "I tried to stop him! Besides, it hardly matters now, does it? If we don't get Seb help soon, he'll-"
The brothers seemed to acknowledge each other at the same time, but avoided speaking or making eye contact, perhaps afraid that doing either would immediately start an argument.
with her?" John interrupted, trying his hardest to keep his voice level under control. Of course, he was failing.
Mycroft's heart froze. "Did you, uh, did you stop him?" He asked, trying not to sound too concerned.
the villainous boy jeered, his tone one of utmost disgust. Then he laughed out loud. "Mycroft Holmes. You're telling me that you would honestly be willing to
Mycroft swallowed back a sob. He took a deep breath in and exhaled slowly, a trick for stopping tears that he had learned when he was very young. Then, he took Greg's face in both his hands and kissed him hard. He felt Greg gasp into his mouth before kissing him back earnestly.
Sherlock just shrugged, the way he always did to avoid questions he did not choose to answer. "I'm sorry you keep losing your breakfast because of me," he said simply.
"Don't you think that's a bit fucked up, though?" John almost yelled. "Messing with someone's feelings like that?" Shit, was he talking about Irene's feelings, or his own?
Although it was barely 8 am on a Sunday and John kind of wanted to go back to sleep, he got up and started getting himself ready for the day.
Harvey leaned back in frustration. He shuffled through some papers on his desk, grumbling under his breath. He was obviously searching desperately for something- anything- to use against the boy. Here was a man, deduced Sherlock, who detested nothing more than being proven wrong and looking stupid. And right now, Sherlock was making him out to be both.
"Y-yes. Yes, of course," Sherlock recovered quickly. "If you'll forgive me, my mind is a bit....a bit scattered right now."
"Oh for god's sake, will you quit obsessing over the time!" Sherlock snapped. "It's not even four thirty anymore! It's, like, six minutes past!"
"Get a grip, Watson," he told himself. Talking to himself always calmed him down. "It's just dark. You've lived in London all your life, there's got to be something you can go off of."
His legs shook from standing, but he didn't sit for the same reason he didn't open his umbrella to shield himself from the storm: He was going to die tonight anyway, and he deserved every ounce of pain and misery he experienced up until that point.
"What about your little friend, hm? What about John Watson? You think he won't go straight for the people you care about most? And you know, I'm not sure your relationship with him ends at friendship. If I can see that, Moriarty will surely be able to!"
John's father looked relieved, but wasn't fuming any less. He glanced at the brochure still in his hand. "Well, you're going to this school!" He yelled.
"I don't care what you've been assigned to do!" Sherlock cut him off. "You're not killing him until I figure out what the hell he wants with me."
It was at that moment that the second bell rang and the burly teacher walked in. "Good morning class," his voice boomed, silencing those still talking. "I am Mr. Dixon. We're going to get started right away, but first I want to make one thing clear."
"Oh, I thought it would be!" Moriarty responded happily. "Of course, I knew it would only fool you for a few seconds, but it was worth the effort all the same. I just wish I could've seen the look on your stupid face!" He giggled, gleeful at the thought.
They started to lift him, and from across the roof Mycroft watched. He watched Jim Moriarty- the boy who had pointed a gun to Greg's head, who had almost made Mycroft kill himself to save him- about to walk out the door.
"You're not going to kill him," said Mycroft, surprised by the steadiness of his own voice. He was terrified. "Not only would you lose leverage over me, but you still need Sherlock. This isn't the end of your little plan, I
Mycroft still remembered that day in early primary school, when he and his brother decided that the two of them were going to master every single language in the world together (not anticipating at the time how impossible that would be). Since the Asian languages were so difficult for them, the boys decided to split them up. Sherlock got Mandarin, Hindi and most of the western Asian languages, while Mycroft chose Japanese, Korean, and most of the eastern ones. He also chose Russian, but both boys ended up learning that one.
"Oh, Mycroft," said Moriarty, his jovial tone dropping and sounding suddenly like he was speaking to a very naughty child. "You do know what will happen if you so much as point that gun of yours at me, don't you? You know how we'll punish you."
"Oh. Uh, John," John replied. "And this is Sherlock," he motioned to his friend who stood silently beside him.
have that drink you offered me earlier." He snatched the clear bottle off the end table before Irene could stop him and took a long drink from it. He lowered it from his lips looking extremely satisfied. "Water."
"You know something...." Mycroft came to a sudden realization. "I don't think I've ever really laughed before."
"Shhh!" Mycroft quieted his friend, trying to listen. Yes, the voices were getting closer. And one of them was definitely Moriarty's.
One of the first things Sherlock had done after discovering Moriarty was hack into the school's student records and find out his room number: 203 B. Since then, he had been tempted several times to simply pay him a visit, but John had always been there to make him see reason. "This is the boy who burned his baby sister alive," John would remind him. "There's no reason to believe that he wouldn't be ready to kill you the moment you knocked on his door!"
"Fuck off, Anderson. Don't you have a dermatologist appointment to get to?" Molly cut him off, cruelly. The class laughed louder that they had when taunting Sherlock, and Anderson's acne-scarred face turned bright red as he reluctantly slunk off.
Embarrassed, Greg quickly regained his composure by flashing a crooked smile at Mycroft and nodding at him to move along. "Get yourself cleaned up, mate," he said. "You look like shit."
"Well, not if you kill him first!" Greg shouted. By now Mycroft's eyes had entirely adjusted to the dark, and he could see that his friend's face was etched in panic. "Come on, what are you waiting for, let's go kill him!"
As the clever boy sat in the grass, mapping out his route, he couldn't help noticing the fierce pounding of his heart and his shortness of breath.
Viktor was staring at him in awe, subconsciously nodding along with the explanation, but still Harvey had eyes only for Sherlock. "....interesting. Very specific. You seem to have given much thought to this explanation."
, Sherlock thought, unable to refrain from deducing the woman. Bitter, divorced, and possibly the phoniest person he had ever laid eyes on.
the one who should be sorry! I've been nothing but a burden to you since the day we met, and you've got enough on your plate, haven't you?!" He yelled the words with all the anger he could muster, but surprisingly, there was not a hint of sarcasm in his tone. "You know, I always suspected you never really liked me. How the hell could someone as smart as you want to even be
Though the auditorium was already packed with chattering students and faculty members when John got there, no one was addressing the crowd. Mr. Harvey stood by the podium, but he was busy having a heated discussion with a group of police officers.
John felt like he was going to pass out, but no longer from exhaustion. He could practically see his carefully planned future evaporating before his eyes. What university would take someone who graduated from a school for "troubled teens"? What chance did he have of becoming a doctor now?
Sebastian checked his watch and was extremely pleased to find that he was ahead of schedule. He had managed to collect the materials he needed with no problem, so he had a good fifteen minutes to spare before he needed to be at room 233B. Jim would be so proud of him!
"Oh god, I can't stand inexorable females," Sherlock uttered, already typing into the browser. "John, show her out."
"Oh cut the act, Mycroft!" Greg snapped, ripping his hand away suddenly. "I saw you last night! You were shaken the hell up, and there's no point in sitting here and acting like you're over it already, because you're not!"
observing the scene. Beneath the splatter of blood was an unmarred wall; and in fact, now that he looked at it, the splatter itself seemed a bit to artistic to be real. Then he examined the bullet and noticed that it was perfect. Not even the slightest sign of impact.
Sherlock did, raising his hands into the air. "You don't want to shoot me," he said, because it felt like a sentence that someone who wasn't scared shitless would say.
"Take a deep breath in," Miss Sandy commanded. "One...two...three. And let it out. Feel all the stress just drift away...."
The woman officer seemed unable to contain her laughter. "It's that smart arse teenager you guys have been going on about! The one who keeps trying to help us solve crimes."
"Would you hurry up and commit suicide already?" Sebastian yelled at Mycroft from across the roof. "I'm freezing my bullocks off out here."
"FUCKING. MYCROFT. HOLMES!" He cried out in anger suddenly, kicking aside the nearest desk. He then put his head in his hands and continued sobbing even louder.
"And I suppose you think that's helped me!" Sherlock's voice broke. A loud, rumbling wave of thunder shook the earth, and the rain started coming down even harder, hammering into the roof above them with such force that it seemed like the barrier would shatter.
Greg stared, analyzing him. He looked as if he wanted to believe Mycroft, but was too scared of being hurt and humiliated again. "Yeah? And what were you so frustrated about that made you take it out on me?"
Before John could respond, their door opened a few inches and Molly poked her head in. "Is everything okay in here? I was just coming back from lunch and I could hear the yelling all the way down the hall."
The very second John had retrieved his stuff and closed up the back, his father peeled out, tires screeching, at twice the speed limit. John watched the car until it disappeared around a corner, hoping karma would take effect and his dad would get pulled over by a nearby cop.
life, the thought of which hurt Mycroft even more, and which forcibly reminded him of his oldest philosophy: that caring for others was dangerous, for them as well as himself.
Sherlock paused. What was that? An insult? A compliment? If it was the latter, did that make them friends? How long were two people required to know each other before they became friends? He needed to ponder this further.
Greg, of course, now unoccupied, turned his attention to his favorite pastime of bugging Mycroft. He rolled his chair up by the window so he was right behind his roommate. "Hey Myc," He said with a smile. "Whatcha thinkin' about?"
It was Mycroft. But he was hardly recognizable. His eyes were puffy and red and his face held greater sadness than Sherlock had ever seen in his brother.
"No, it's fine, I get it!" Greg shouted. "You hate me, so I've done you a favor and quit talking to you! I even requested to be moved to a different room-"
"My mind palace, John, I'm quite sure I didn't stutter. If you're going to be an idiot, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave the room."
Sherlock looked as if he was about to ask another question before he caught sight of his watch. "Well would you look at the time? John and I have got to be going." He stood up, putting his coat back on.
John's father pulled the car up to the curb and parked it in front of a fire hydrant. Then he said something, but John didn't hear him. He had caught sight of his reflection in the windshield, reminding him that he would be starting at a new school with a black and yellow bruise covering half of his face, to match the one that extended across half his torso. At least the larger one was hidden underneath his shirt.
But it was usually when Sherlock was thinking of several important things at once while talking about something quite unimportant that he had epiphanies. Like now, while they had been talking about Molly, he had simultaneously been thinking about Moriarty, his brother, and John....mostly John, though. There was hardly a time anymore when part of his mind
When he reached 221B to find the door ajar, Mycroft's sliver of hope that Moriarty had been bluffing vanished. "Fuck," he muttered, his heart racing as he opened the door to observe the scene inside.
Mycroft relaxed into his mattress. Yes, he was tired. Tired and relieved that no one he loved had died tonight, but at the same time absolutely terrified for tomorrow.
As the boy sat by the window sill, taking drags from his cigarette, he wondered what his time at this new school would be like, and how long it would take others to decide that they hated him. It usually didn't take anyone more than a day. For whomever was misfortunate enough to be his roommate, it would probably take about five minutes.
"What the hell, Sherlock?!" John yelled, marching over and slamming the window shut. "Are you trying to catch pneumonia?!"
John had no idea what the hell that was about, or how one teenager could earn so much hate from so many police officers, but he was too tired to contemplate it at the moment. It had nothing to do with him, anyway.
With nothing more to talk about concerning their current predicament, it seemed, John allowed his mind free reign to think about the kiss he and Sherlock had very nearly shared last night for the first time since it had happened. Er,
"Hey, that's my room number!" said Molly, who had read the note over John's shoulder. "Irene..." she looked at Sherlock again, taking in his overall state. "Oh, I should've known this was her doing!"
So instead, as a couple of the brutes roughly shoved handcuffs on his wrists, Sherlock resorted to his oldest excuse.
"Then you've seen my file!" Mycroft countered. "You know that I've already been assigned to kill Moriarty, so you don't have to-"
"Kids these days have no respect for their parents," the officer said. "Believe me. I've had problems with my own kids as well. However, if I may offer a solution-" The officer then pulled a brochure out of his pocket, where he seemed to have a whole collection of them.
"Wait! Come on Myc, let's think about this." Greg put a hand on his friend's shoulder, trying to stop him, but Mycroft shrugged him off.
"BOTH OF YOU!" Dixon's booming voice silenced the last of the laughter. Sherlock stood up, preparing to argue John's innocence to the death.
Sherlock didn't answer. He couldn't. The cold electricity that he had come to associate with John's touch had just jolted through him stronger than ever before, and he was afraid that if he opened his mouth he would find that he had stopped breathing.
"Oh, I'm sorry," the boy responded, sarcastically. "I just liked the way breakfast looked on you so much yesterday that I wanted to see it again." He shoved Sherlock off his chair and to the floor. "Prick."
Sherlock nodded impatiently. "Yes, yes now let's get this over with. I don't have all night." He reached his hand out for the bag the man was holding, but he held it back, shaking his head.
"Molly, I'm not sure of the proper etiquette for telling someone this," Sherlock started, awkwardly, "But it appears as though you were seconds from being murdered before we showed up."
Jim was still and silent for quite some time, never losing his grip on the knife. Only Seb noticed how his friend's coal black eyes were flickering in that amazing way they did whenever he made deductions, seeing and considering more in milliseconds than most people could in hours. His mind-clouding emotions seemed to be clearing away at last, allowing him to entertain more possibilities.
Dixon continued his lecture as students snickered under their breath. Meanwhile, Sherlock seethed. He couldn't give any less fucks what his fellow students believed about him, but when a false accusation started stripping him of his rights, that's when he got pissed off.
"Anyway," Sherlock continued excitedly. "I should only have to study this list for a few hours to figure out who he is threatening. I will, of course, need to be left completely alone during this time."
"Christ, are those police cars?!" Greg exclaimed, glancing through a crack in the curtains. He pulled them back to reveal the same cars that Mycroft had seen before, now looking to be on their way out. Harvey was no longer down there; in fact, the courtyard was just about empty. All that remained were a couple of lingering officers examining a grotesque-looking stain on the pavement.
Having skipped out on Behavioral Corrections the same way as they had yesterday, John and Sherlock had a whole hour to kill before their detention. Both boys sat on their individual beds: Sherlock flipping through one of John's anatomy textbooks while John doodled aimlessly on the corner of his unfinished maths homework.
After class was over, Molly gave a parting smile to the boys before heading off to her next class, while John and Sherlock headed off to theirs.
Sherlock was too pissed to answer this time, feeling utterly betrayed by his body. He closed his eyes and focused on counting his breaths to bring himself to a calmer state.
"And maybe also learn not to steal from your father's goddamn bank account," their father added from his desk. He was changing all of his passwords as they spoke.
Sherlock swallowed, horrified at what he was about to do, but he knew it was necessary. Keeping his eyes away from the corner of the room where he knew John was watching, he caressed Irene's cheek with his hand in the same way he had done to John in the hallway. He kept his expression stoic, even though he wanted to vomit. "So....Moriarty wanted you to hurt me?"
And Sherlock did. "What whathappened?" he said, looking quite dazed, as if he had just been woken from a dream. Then he noticed John, and his face turned bright red.
John got up and left without looking at Sherlock, as he had hardly looked at him all morning. Sherlock found this odd, but he stored the observation in his mind palace to ponder later, as Molly Hooper was currently giving him a death glare with the power to wipe everything from his mind.
But most importantly, why had Sherlock spent the last twelve hours dissecting his possible feelings for John Watson rather than trying to figure out Moriarty's plans?
Neither of them uttered a single word as they finished their cigarettes. Nor did they speak as they stumbled back to school together, even when Mycroft allowed Sherlock to lean on him because one of his ankles was sprained. And when they reached the building, just as the rain was finally quieting, they parted ways just as wordlessly.
Two stories down, a man dressed in camouflage to blend in with the bushes revealed himself. Then, after triple checking to make sure the coast was clear, Mycroft dropped the letter out the window and the man caught it. He then gave the teen a brief salute before racing off to his next destination.
"That is classified information," Mycroft said, still looking at his brother with disdain. "And Sherlock, I strongly suggest that you not get involved. Whatever Moriarty's plans are, my men are already looking into it. Your idiocy will only get you hurt. Besides, it's none of your concern-"
Moriarty let out a loud, manic cackle. "Oh, how appropriate." he jeered. "The great and clever Mycroft Holmes,
Surprisingly, the bully (who's name was apparently Viktor) obliged, dropping Sherlock back into his chair. Sherlock straightened the wrinkles out of his coat, glaring up at Viktor.
"From what I can deduce about your personality, it's unlikely that you were sent here for anything illegal, or even immoral. Given your obviously difficult home life, a runaway attempt is the most plausible remaining option."
By the time the men from his unit arrived and negotiated a peaceful deal with the Moriarty family, Mycroft had managed to go his entire interrogation without letting a single secret slip, instead having told Jim everything there was to know about his little brother.
"If you shoot, then I shoot Mycroft!" said Jim. And there the boys stood for several moments, aiming their guns at each other in what everyone on the roof knew was a pointless stalemate.
But there it was, on the ground beside the bureau: a bloodied 9mm bullet that had clearly found its exit wound.
"Christ, Lestrade. It's simple conjugation," Mycroft replied without looking up from his screen. "Do you have trouble finding your way to the toilet at night, as well?"
"Why don't you ever stand up for yourself?" John asked him after the fourth or fifth time this happened. John, as always, had tried to stop them but it always happened that the bullies were a lot bigger than he was.
"I-I um, I-" John stammered. The large teen, maybe three or four times his size, was staring down at him as several bullies had done before. Being short, poor, and assumed gay by everyone, John had been beat up quite a bit at his old school. Wishing to get a fresh start, he was not ready to make enemies on his first day someplace new. He wanted to go just one year without trouble.
Slowly and carefully, Sherlock used his recently freed hands to push himself into an upright position. Irene didn't notice.
Molly visually relaxed. "I knew that it wasn't you. I just had to double check. So, what did you tell Mr. Harvey?"
it isn't." Of course, Mycroft had always known. Moriarty wanted Mycroft out of the way specifically so he could continue whatever plan he had laid out, so using Sherlock's life as manipulation didn't make any sense.
His temper flared up beyond belief. "But of course, why would you care?!" He yelled, making Greg jump. "You're so stupid, you're failing every class! You don't care about anything but sports and looking cool and following me around everywhere I fucking go! You know something, Lestrade? Ever since I met you my life has been a living HELL!! I swear, being around you has made me so STUPID! More so than I ever thought possible! When you're in the room, I can't focus! I can't think straight! I forget who I fucking
his brain reminded him. Sherlock knew that, thanks to his forethought to demolish the crime scene, there would never be sufficient enough evidence to determine that he had murdered Viktor Jabcobsen. But he would definitely remain a suspect, and a significant one at that, and probably accused by the majority of his classmates. And dammit to hell, that was going to be inconvenient.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes in suspicion. He still wasn't entirely sure whether or not he could trust this boy, however much he enjoyed his company. He decided to take the risk. "I hacked into Scotland Yard's database of unsolved case files when I was ten. I've been solving those in my spare time ever since, anonymously sending them my results, but they never take them seriously."
The inside of the school was even more pristine and immaculate than the outside, which John hadn't previously thought possible. The shiny, marble floor was made up of a distinctive black and white pattern, which continued down every hallway extending from the entrance.
John did, however, spot Irene a few rows up. She was leaning back in her chair like he was, her own virtually sleepless night evident on her face, only she seemed to be making little effort to stay awake. Her untamed hair hung over her face to hide her drooping eyelids as she stared off into the distance, not particularly intrigued by any of this.
. Even sixteen hours after their fight, the mere thought of his brother brought on a tsunami of stupid emotions: anger, frustration, annoyance, guilt, shame, sadness. Everything painful. But most of all, he was worried beyond belief. Sherlock was in trouble, and he was positive that Moriarty was involved somehow.
, if you must know, I'm writing a letter to the current leader of North Korea regarding his request for nuclear weapons. The fate of the world kind of depends on it, so if you don't mind, I'd like to get back to it."
Mycroft helped Greg with his chemistry homework and, for the first time, did not call him an idiot once.
"Lestrade?" John said, remembering that name. "I've met your dad. He was the one who, well, arrested me."
"Great, you're catching on," Mycroft said. He stood up and made to grab his coat. He didn't need to take this; he could use a cigarette anyway. Of course, he would have to get past the newly-instated security system, but he was confident this would only take a moment. Child's play, those systems always were.
Sherlock stumbled to his feet, ready to sprint, but Irene was too fast. She had her gun out and aimed at him with the speed of someone who had done the motion several times before. "Stop!" she shouted.
According to the brochure, the school was only four years old, and still looked quite modern. It didn't have the worn look of faded brick that John's old public school possessed. But to John, the brand-new, freshly painted look made the school seem all the more intimidating.
"Silence, both of you!" Harvey yelled. Then, quite calmly, he turned to Viktor. "Mr. Jacobsen, why don't you recount the story that you told me earlier?"
As soon as he was alone, Jim's demeanor changed from smooth and composed to irritated and utterly defeated. He slumped down in his seat, staring at his oldest file of Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock glanced over at John and was pleased to see his look of revulsion. He didn't like this anymore than Sherlock did.
The raindrops pounded into them like nails as the brothers wrestled, each trying to get the upper hand. Mycroft won, of course, like he wins everything. He pinned Sherlock down into the mud, holding onto his hair with angry force.
"Oh, please!" Greg strode back over to his side of the room and flopped onto his bed with a sports magazine. "Why on earth would a Korean dictator write to a random teenager in England asking for nukes?"
It was only when Dixon walked in and started taking attendance that Sherlock noticed the empty seat behind him. Mycroft was missing.
Mycroft didn't answer, still breathing heavily and trying to figure out why the fuck he had just said all of that. Sure, he was pissed off by everything that was going on, but he didn't blame Greg. He just took it out on him because....well, because being with Greg forced him to feel. And he hated it.
me mister smart arse," Greg snapped. "Not all of us can be international spies, or whatever the hell you are."
"Shut up, you arsehole, it was an accident! Besides, it's not like anyone saw us," she bit back, even as she scanned the hall nervously. "Everyone's at breakfast."
He snapped to attention, glancing over at Greg who was sitting at his desk, looking quite exasperated. "I've been trying to ask you something for, like, ten minutes!"
"Students, I'm afraid that one of your classmates....and I suppose it'd be pointless not to tell you who." He cast side glances at the policemen standing at his shoulders and pinched the bridge of his nose. Despite how he had been a dick to him and Sherlock in the past, John couldn't help feeling sorry for the man. He looked like he had aged ten years overnight.
The room grew quiet and still once more, as neither Harvey nor Sherlock wished to back down and accept defeat. The original intent of the meeting seemed to have been long forgotten, as it had now turned in to a battle of the wills between Mr. Harvey and Sherlock.
"It's 8:07," said Sherlock, raising an eyebrow like the answer was obvious. "At least three more minutes before we can be considered fashionably late. That's what people usually are at their first parties, right?"
"How did I get into bed?" he asked, trying to recall when exactly he had fallen asleep after the life-altering events of last night. Then he scanned the room. "Where's Molly?"
He lifted his head slowly and was faced with the back of another. Greg Lestrade's hair was not so much tousled as severely wild and unkempt, as if it's owner had yanked it repeatedly out of worry or frustration recently. The right side of the boy's face rested just below Mycroft's sternum. His breathing was slow and steady. His right hand, Mycroft only now noticed, was still joined tightly with his own.
Sherlock didn't respond. He just retrieved his pack of cigarettes from his coat pocket and pulled out another one, but John confiscated it as well, along with the entire pack. "Stop it," he said. "You don't need to smoke."
The young genius then receded into the deep recesses of his mind, and John was left to wonder why the hell he liked this kid so much, seeing as how he could be kind of a dick.
John didn't want to tell him that one, knowing that he would definitely be taken home, but at three in the morning he was too tired to be difficult. So he told them.
Then it was over. Sherlock accepted the book without a word, returned to his bed, and immediately started reading it.
Mycroft took a deep breath in and exhaled slowly. The palms of his hands were scraped and bleeding, he was freezing and soaked to the bone, and he knew that his chances of surviving the night were slim. But he
"Take that kid home," he told him, pointing at John. "Here's his address. I've got some important business to attend to." Then he ran after his partner, giggling like a schoolgirl.
He was positioned at an awkward angle, with his arms twisted behind his back and his hands tied together, but he knew better than to try working at the knots. Instead, he kept his body motionless and his breathing even, listening closely for other breathing around him.
"Please!" Greg cried, putting a hand on Mycroft's shoulder, forcing him to turn. "Please let me put myself in danger for you." His eyes were teary and pleading.
He had to walk all the way around the school and across the large courtyard behind it, trudging heavily through the wet grass in his soaked-through clothes before he reached the place. It was the small, rusty shed about a hundred meters behind the school building, where the groundskeeper kept his gardening tools. The shed itself was locked, but it's flat tin roof stretched off a few feet on all sides, providing a decent shield from the rain.
"He has to be," said John, his voice cracking. "He's Sherlock Holmes. If anyone's going to fix this, it will be him."
In a heartbeat, Sherlock elbowed Mycroft in the side and escaped his grip. In another, he punched him in the face, sending him to the ground instead. "AND HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?!"
"Magnificent job, Seb! You've done brilliantly." Jim exclaimed before glancing away, pretending not to notice the way his friend beamed when he expressed his gratitude.
Mycroft took a step back, more out of honest shock than fear. The fury in his roommate's eyes was something he had never seen before, not even when they were fighting.
Moriarty nudged him forward. Taking a deep breath, Mycroft stepped onto the ledge. He never realized how high up four stories was until he had to peer down that far from the ledge of a roof, preparing to jump. The height was strangely exhilarating.
Having skipped breakfast that morning, Mycroft had missed the episode that had occurred with the bully and his younger brother. However, it wasn't hard to deduce once he walked into chemistry and saw Sherlock's damp hair and slightly flushed face.
"I can't believe you let them get a hole of your scarf," Mycroft said, handing the article of clothing to Sherlock.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Please, it's obvious. You're face is bruised, and the fact that you're holding your left arm about an inch outward from how it would naturally hang by your side leads me to believe that the entire left side of your torso is bruised as well. Both bruises are about a week old and were caused by your father after you tried to run away."
Mycroft didn't respond, his teeth clenched as they had been for the past hour while he tensed up against the cold. But he didn't realize how tense his entire body had been until he tried to move towards his foe, and his locked leg muscles prevented him, sending him tumbling to his hands and knees at Moriarty's feet instead.
"You're going to this school! And that's FINAL!" His father finished off his ranting with a final kick, this time to John's face, before storming out of the room.
Both boys were silent for awhile until Greg finally couldn't take it anymore. "Alright, what the bloody hell are you doing now?" He whispered angrily.
The next few seconds seemed to happen in slow motion. First, there they were: Jim Moriarty and a tall girl with wavy brown hair whom Mycroft immediately recognized as Irene Adler (or The Woman, as she was known throughout the criminal world). Astonished to see her here when he had sworn she was last rumored to be hiding in America, Mycroft leaned forward, briefly exposing his face through the crack in the door.
Sherlock wasn't convinced. However, he didn't really want to think about his brother anymore. He picked up John's pencil and wrote back:
Sherlock mimed throwing up into his lap, and John had to suppress a giggle. Then, Sherlock motioned to the open door.
"I guess that makes sense," said John. "But damn, after that big talk he gave us yesterday about what a hard arse he was going to be, this just seems suspiciously pitiful. I won't be surprised if he gives us a special pen that makes us write words in our own blood-"
They were both female. The only other sleeping breaths came from his left, and he could only deduce that they were from Molly. Though how and why she had gotten
, while Mr. Dixon himself paced the room and questioned them about why they were sent to Baskerville's.
John's own breath caught in his throat as Sherlock brought his right hand to John's face, resting it gently on his cheek. His heart pounded relentlessly. He couldn't have moved if he wanted to.
Had Greg heard what he had said right before that? If so, was he able to put two and two together? Mycroft did not want to meet his eyes and find out, but Greg didn't give him a choice. He crouched down so that they were right next to each other on the floor and took Mycroft's face in his hands, boldly.
Mycroft couldn't take it anymore. He looked up from his work and at the muscular, brown haired boy across the room, who was pacing back and forth as he ranted. "You know Gavin, as much I've thoroughly enjoyed hearing about your daddy issues for the past ten minutes, I would like it very much if you'd shut the hell up now. In case you didn't notice, I'm busy."
John's thoughts, as well as the several side conversations of his fellow students, were interrupted by three loud taps followed by a high-pitched whine. Mr. Harvey was testing the microphone.
John sighed, knowing better than to push the issue. He could bring it up later. For now, he sat on the corner of his bed and pretended to be completely immersed in his novel for English class. In reality, however, he was doing what he did all too often lately: watching the brilliant Sherlock Holmes out of the corner of his eye and imagining what it would be like to kiss him.
The sky was still dark when Mycroft woke, but that said nothing about the time. It was November now; winter was fast approaching. It could have been three in the morning or seven. Either way, the sky was dark. But more importantly, the rest of the world was not. Because the darkness that should have shrouded the grounds was punctured sharply by flashing lights that bled in through the curtains.
Molly opened her mouth, then closed it again. She obviously did not want to leave, but didn't seem to know what to say. She bit her lip, then quickly turned and left the room.
Sherlock was speechless, but didn't get a chance to respond before a large hand picked up John's tray of pancakes and sausage and dumped it over Sherlock's head.
Jim and Irene had retreated immediately to Jim's room with Sebastian and laid the injured boy down on his bed. Then, per Jim's instructions, Irene had injected Seb with the same sedative they had used several times that night, and Jim proceeded to google
What was with all these emotions all of a sudden? Maybe he was still frustrated about his fight with Sherlock, and his predisposed annoyance was making him more easily irritated in situations that he normally wouldn't care about. Yes, that was probably it.
Their voices grew louder as the two came closer to Mycroft's and Greg's hiding place. Mycroft held his breath, eager to see the face of Moriarty's female companion. Why was her voice so familiar?
Just another part of the whole truth, and another statement that would get him fired faster than he could blink.
Sherlock groaned loudly. This John Watson kid was as bad as his parents. He assumed the next thing he would do was lecture him about the concept of "having consideration for others".
Meanwhile, the brilliant spy Mycroft Holmes went back to his house, ignored his parents who asked how "summer camp" in Ireland was, ignored his twelve-year-old, inevitably doomed little brother who wanted to know why the hell he had
"OH COME ON!" Moriarty shouted, making even his partner Sebastian jump slightly. "You know you can do it, and you know that if you don't you're going to die. You
Greg lay unmoving in his bed, facing the wall. Mycroft didn't think he would respond until he muttered, in an equally unstable voice, "About what?"
John did not respond to the false accusations as calmly as Sherlock did. "Bugger off!" He told the kid, shoving him aside as he followed Sherlock.
Once he was showered and dressed, he came out of the bathroom to find Sherlock still sitting at his desk, but staring at a blank laptop screen. John wasn't sure if his friend was at a loss for what to do, or had just slipped into his mind palace randomly. Either way, John did not want to just leave him alone this time, afraid that, like yesterday, he would end up sitting in the same spot for several hours.
Luckily, John didn't notice. "Sherlock, it's half past midnight, and I don't think you ate at all yesterday. I know that you're concerned about what Moriarty-"
"Because," she said, running her fingers through his curls and smiling when he shivered involuntarily. "I've switched sides, my love, and I need you to know it's because of you. I didn't care who I had to hurt until I found out this Sherlock Holmes boy was so..."
But he said nothing as John turned off his lamp and crawled back into bed. He just glanced at his violin, considering picking it up once more, but then deciding against it. It worked with boredom and thinking, but not with feelings. What exactly was he feeling, anyway?
Irene smiled as if what she was about to say amused her. Then, she leaned in close. "Because," she whispered. "You make him
"That's not true," John mumbled, as he sat back in the chair in defeat. "I'm fairly sure it's all one sided."
to go down without a fight. He slipped his hand inside his soaked-through suit jacket, closing his fingers around his gun.
John looked at his friend, and was impressed by his stoic expression in the face of so many accusatory glares.
It was true. After finishing the Harry Potter series, Sherlock was forced to conclude that fantasy novels were  fantastic, and quite good at helping him forget about his problems for awhile. And since goodness knows he needed that at the moment, he had taken to borrowing books from John to read in his spare time.
"Just now." But Sherlock wasn't looking at him. He was craning his neck, searching the crowd before them intently.
"When one looks at the time it takes for a witch or wizard to vanish into thin air, versus the time it takes for a thrown object to travel from several feet across the room-factoring in, of course, the knife's velocity-"
"I'll make it down there," Sherlock responded in a monotone. "They won't start right away, believe me. Just go."
Despite the rising levels of stress and anticipation, particularly in three specific dorms in the B hall of Baskerville's, three uneventful weeks passed.
Greg shrugged. "My dad's a police officer. I've kind of become immune to the subject of murder. Besides," he said, smiling like an idiot, "I still think it's cool that my roommate works for the secret service. This is, like, the most interesting thing that has ever happened to me. Hey, do you think I could help you out on a job sometime?!"
But before Sherlock could analyze him further, Moriarty shocked him by changing his surprised expression into a wide, shark's grin. Slowly, he lifted one bloody finger to his lips and whispered "Shhh." Then he continued on, leaving Sherlock feeling utterly bewildered and just a little bit afraid.
The water in the sink ran red as Jim washed his hands of the stupid boy's dried blood. To him this was the most tedious part: erasing the evidence. He still had to hand wash the several bloodstains out of his suit. If only that boy hadn't been so difficult....
