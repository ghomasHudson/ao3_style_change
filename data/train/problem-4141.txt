"Did you shoot her or not." Dean said, feeling anger come over. Ejhil watched Dean's every move and took a deep breath.
Dean was sure of it. She said his name. Cas stared at her with a mix of apprehension and embarrassment. He sighed and glanced around him and looked down a bit.
"Well, it should be right there, Capn. These are its last known coordinates." Chief Navigator Fitz said, scanning the empty space around the ship.
Dean turns to follow, stuffing the thick wad of cash in his jacket pocket. Castiel moves fast, walks with almost a hunch now towards the car. Dean watches Castiel's hands curl into fists like they had been all day long.
Castiel squared off with the man and slowly took his arm out of his lab coat sleeve, letting it rest against his back. He was slow now, side stepping and mirroring the Romulan's move. The Romulan lunged forward and Cas sidestepped him. He turned and pushed the man to the ground and brought his free sleeve around the Romulans neck. He pulled on it until the man below him stopped moving.
“Hello, Dean.” He hears the familiar gruff voice behind him. He turns and sees Cas. Smiling but sad. Dean stands there frozen. He stutters.
“Aye, Captain.” The shuttle shook a bit as the Argenteus flew past it laying down fire on any cube that got close. Cas’s voice jumped back into Dean’s brain.
“What should I have said Cas, ‘By the way while you were being ripped apart nerve by nerve by your own brother, I snooped around in your memory. Sorry!’ Besides, that entry was during the Academy, why didn’t
"That's a neat trick, Cas. " Dean grabs the cash as Castiel pulls the card and his hand away from the ATM.
“You're really gonna make me talk about this, huh." Dean asked, forcing a chuckle. Cas raised his eyebrows. Dean huffed and leaned on the console.
"They died natural deaths. Old age. My father was almost 180 years old. That's old for a Vulcan. When he passed, my mother passed soon after that. I don't think she could be without him for any longer. I believe that was a year before Castiel and Samandriel were assigned to this ship.”
The Terminator, Gadreel, turns to Castiel now, swinging its arm into the console. Sparks fly in every direction.
“Can she use her betazoid mind tricks on people? You know, cruise someone’s noodle?” Cas clenched his jaw and fists just a bit.
“Letting my emotions get in the way.” He mumbled. “You remember Cas is the Vulcan and not you right, Sam?” Dean said as Sam chuckled and went for the door.
"I have a mission for you. I've tracked down a Romulan ship that needs to be taken out." Dean looked up at his father.
“You misunderstand me, Captain. I was like you once. Average, nothing special. Except for my powers. Our father, for some bizarre reason, wanted me in Starfleet. I couldn't stand the monotony. Sure space travel is exciting, but where's the fun in just exploring, when I could just take so easily? So I dropped out. As I experimented with my powers I found my body just wasn't enough to power me. So I voluntarily assimilated. At first, I didn't remember who I was. But, when the Borg Queen died, myself and several other drones were severed from the collective. In a last ditch effort to save our species, we formed our own, and I became King. I have more power than you can imagine. Just imagine if I assimilated Earth, or Vulcan, or Betazed how powerful I'd be. How important I'd be. No one would forget me. No one could tell me what to do. If I assimilated you and your brother, you could be my right hand men. Sam the genius, and you, the battering ram. We'd be the most feared creatures this side of the universe. What's more important in the long run, Dean - feeling like nothing, or feeling like something?”
"Man. I've ... heard a lot of crazy shit in my day, but this. How am I supposed to believe you? For all I know you could be here to kill me.” Dean says.
Dean blinked at Cas. Sure, the guy had had some crying fits in his time, but they were few and far between. Dean never thought Cas was scared.
A part of him couldn't believe that Cas had blasted in there and rescued him. Mostly because … it was Cas. It's wasn’t that Cas wasn't capable, it was that he hardly ever resorted to physical combat. Dean craned his neck to look at Cas and make sure he wasn't still hallucinating.
Dean sits against a cold concrete wall in a cave that's mostly underground. Castiel sits next to him, shoulders almost touching. There's one entrance into a larger cave system, but over the years, explosions have blasted away at the cave roof. As holes appeared, Castiel would shove steel plates or thick dark bulletproof glass into them, making small makeshift skylights. It wasn’t much but it's all they had.
“Alright, Dean. I won’t.” The brothers held on to each other’s arms as the Argenteus slipped into high Impulse and pulled the shuttle along at a devastating speed.
“Alright, shoot those off right before we hit the cube. It won’t do much but it’ll at least neutralize the bastards for a second.”
“I do not think Starfleet protocol requires this kind of reckless action. You might not survive this Dean, and in the chance you do, what about the Impala?” Cas was right. The chances of Sam and Dean coming back were slim, Dean knew that. The pair reached the shuttle bay and stepped through the doors.
Castiel takes a small pocket knife out of his pocket and goes for his palm. Dean glances around, making sure no one can see what they're doing. He looks back at Castiel when he hears the click of the knife opening.
“I will join you in the mess hall for lunch, Anna, we can discuss the details of the funeral then.” Cas said. Anna nodded and smiled at him. More silence rang between them and Dean craned his neck ever so slightly trying to hear what couldn’t be heard. Cas left the transporter room. Dean turned his attention back to Anna.
"Listen Sasquatch, if you don't drop this I'm dropping you out an Air Lock. Brother or not. Computer: Resume Turbolift." Dean said crossing his arms. Sam rolled his eyes as he spoke.
“He looks pretty dead to me ... whatever he is.” Dean takes a few steps closer. Castiel puts up a hand as he scans the rubble. A box of rags shifts and through the rubble he sees the heat of Gadreel's power cell. It does not dim.
"I am fine." Castiel says, voice deep, tight and balled up like his fists. Castiel reminds himself he could disarm Rufus if he needed to. Easily.
Turning a corner down a main road, Castiel sees the sun crest over the horizon for the first time in his life. He peers over a tall hedge and sees the sky change colors; from a dark navy blue to deep orange to a soft pink. As far as he can remember now, he’s not even sure that he’s ever been outside. His memory is all-steel walls, corrugated shelves ... the color green, like dry moss growing in the cracks of the concrete floor of a bunker.
Had Dean followed his fathers orders, Ejhil would already be dead, but Dean … something else was eating at him.
"What. Cas, what the hell am I looking at here?" Dean says vaguely throwing his hand up. "I don't want to mess you up." He finishes. Castiel wants to laugh at that.
He remembers Dean in the future or parts of his future at least. He remembers crow’s feet and graying hair, but the same voice, the same eyes staring back at him. He remembers being built and programmed with Legion’s most advanced learning computer. Tearing through human flesh with his bare hands. Dean's face with tears rolling down it as he sits at the business end of a rifle that's seated firmly in Castiel's hands. Being hunkered down in a concrete hideaway for a year, protecting Dean from the Terminators that will be sent to kill him. Most of his memories are still clouded, still buried but ...
Red fills Unit 13's vision. As the red goes from a crimson to dark maroon and then to a cool grey, their surroundings settle into place. They see a grey concrete room and thick dark cables running towards them along the ground. Words flash across their vision.
"Yeah. He's, uh, something else." Dean stared in front of him, but he could feel his cheeks flush and his heart pick up.
"Captain to the bridge, what the hell is going on up there!" The comm was laced with static but Sam responded in a desperate voice.
"Enter." The door slid open and Dean stepped inside. The room was long and grey with a desk at the end, and two chairs in front of it. Admiral John Winchester sat reading a pad and didn't bother to look up. Dean walked the 10 feet to stand in front of the desk, feeling himself shrink and start to feel like an ensign again.
Another sound shook Dean from his trance. A crash from the far side of he room, near the bay window. He saw a bookshelf had been shoved over and a door had been hiding behind it. Dean turned and took quick steps to the door.
Cas whispered.Dean felt his palms sweat and his heartache. It felt like his skin was about to melt off. Dean glanced down at the console and saw a pool of tears. With his free hand he reached up and felt the wetness of his face. How long had he been crying? How long had it hurt this damn much? How long had he held this down? Cas continued.
“Duck!” Dean yells to Castiel as he crouches behind a counter next to Gadreel. Castiel obliges and he sees buckshot fly into Gadreel's chest, leaving large pock marks in its wake. If he were human he’d be dead, but instead, his metal chassis shines with dark synthetic blood as he twists himself in recoil and swings back to face Dean. Castiel reaches up and catches his arms in a lock, planting his feet and pushing all his weight to keep Gadreel still.
Castiel watches as Dean makes his way to the back door of the garage. He glances up to see the other Terminator move to the edge of the parking garage. Castiel vaults over the sign and sprints to the old auto garage. He looks around to the front, no civilians, minimal casualties possible.
"No I'm not coming on, Sam. There's nothing to say about it. Computer: Bridge." Dean said crossing his arms. The turbo lift whirred and propelled the pair upwards.
Something about a cybernetic organism driving the Impala makes Dean's stomach churn. He isn't sure if it's the fact that someone else is at Baby's wheel or the fact that Castiel makes slow stops, turns the wheel a bit too sharply at intersections, and rides the edges of the roads too much. Sure, Castiel can drive, Dean figured he was programmed with that knowledge or he watched Dean enough to know the basics, but he has no ... heart in it.
Dean had lost officers before, but this was Castiel’s little brother – barely an ensign, assigned to the Argenteus so that Castiel could look after him. Dean picked up his pace and jogged to the sick bay. The door slid open. There was never this much blood in sick bay. Even after battles, sick bay remained clean and grey. Now, blood dripped to the red stained floor. Dean stared at the drips and followed them upwards to find Samandriel on the bio bed. Castiel stood over him with his head down. He was shaking. The two medics were standing on the other side of the bed, waiting for Castiel's order.
"You think Cas wouldn't be upset if you died now? Even if you didn't tell him how you felt? Like there's some magic switch and all the emotions go away? Sure, Cas is half-Vulcan but nobody is that heartless. You're just being stubborn."
Dean sat on the edge of the captain's chair, with Sam peering at him from his right, and Cas standing somewhere behind his left shoulder. He could feel the doubt floating in the air. It was ludicrous.
“I want to meet her,” Dean said innocently, “Besides you still haven’t answered me. Don’t make me order you.” Cas sighed and entered the transporter room. He gave a nod to the man at the computer. The pair stood at the pads waiting for the communiqué from Starfleet.
“It’s ok Cas, you’re ok.” Dean said quietly. Cas wasn’t much of a hugger (or a crier for that matter), even when it was important, so Dean knew Castiel’s arms would stay slack at his sides as his tears soaked through Dean's uniform. The whisper in Dean's subconscious was there - barely audible, telling him something he probably already knew. He pushed it away again. Cas’ tears had ceased and he slowly leaned back, pausing for just a moment an inch from Dean’s face, before sitting all the way up and wiping his face.
Dean's third year came and Cas got assigned as a field medic on a six-month training mission on Betazed. Dean thought he could handle the ‘seperation’. It
“Atta boy Sammy. Let’s kill us a Borg King!” Dean grinned and turned toward Kevin, ready to open a hailing frequency.
Dean sighed. He couldn’t tell Sam why he didn’t want him to come with. Not in front of the crew, not with everyone watching.
Before he can turn back he hears the glass shatter and feels the other Terminator’s arms slam into his chest. This one didn't bother to find clothes so when Castiel reaches up to grab the Terminator's arm; his grip is faulty. Castiel looks back to see that Dean is still firmly planted, mouth fallen open. The Terminator stands to his full height and whips his head around, jaw set, dark eyes targeting Dean.
He runs across a street and hears a screech as he narrowly misses getting hit by a car that doesn't stop fast enough at a stoplight. He stumbles and rolls over his shoulder out of the way. He stands as the car honks at him. He hears a voice but he doesn't care about that now because he sees two things.
“Cas, that doesn't change anything. It doesn’t matter if I was just a kid, I made a mistake that I can't fix. It's my fault. She's dead and she's never coming back. Sometimes I just … I wish I could trade places with her.” He regretted it as soon as it left his mouth.
"Lucifer." Cas could barely breath. "I tried to … he locked me in here…still out there … he's strong. I can't." Cas fell limp in Dean's grasp.
It’s like a cough deep in his throat. His memory is still faulty but he manages to access a piece, a voice. It’s not his. It's ... got a subtle twang to it that he can't place. It's steadfast and strong, but lilts like a melody.
"Cas sure did work a miracle back there, didn't he." Sam said, with something like sarcasm coating every word.
Dean will never forget the look on Cas’s face the first time they went to a real party. Not a Starfleet mandated, dress-uniforms-only party - a real, off campus, alcohol soaked party. Dean will never forget the way Cas refused to leave Dean’s side. Cas explained it away as a safety precaution, claiming that as representatives of Starfleet, they should remain together, just in case any partygoers had ill-intent. Dean was pretty sure that was bullshit and had to refrain from laughing when pure terror flashed across Cas’s face anytime anyone tried to hit on him.
“What?” Sam twists his face. “But. I can’t … Cas, I can’t.” He says looking back at his brother's face. Cas follows his gaze.
Castiel stares back at Dean. It's familiar somehow, standing opposite Dean. Like he's been here before, with just a short barrier between them.
“I don’t know, the transporter got scrambled on materialization. They should have transported to sick bay, but I’m not reading their signals. Our sensors were damaged in the battle.” Cas tapped his badge.
“Jack. He pulled me out. It was the first thing he did when he left you and Sam. He was very persuasive to the empty. Angels will no longer go there when we die. We’ll become cosmic energy and return to Jack. Sort of a … circle of life.” Dean nods his head. Circle of life. He glances down at his corpse.
"No Dean. I don't enjoy removing bullets from the one person I am supposed to protect. But ... I enjoy your stories. What I can remember, anyway." He finishes.
"You ... are you good over there?" Dean says, leaning forward, trying to follow Castiel's distant gaze. Sound returns to him as a scream comes from Gadreel’s direction. A civilian must've gotten in his way.
“No, Dean, I don’t. Casualty of war. Besides, unlike my brothers and sisters I’ve managed to rid myself of those emotions. It’s a wonder what the Borg collective can do to the psyche."
“No, I didn’t. I killed the baddies, and my crew was safe, but I guess Starfleet doesn’t like it when the Captain sacrifices themselves and ends up dead because of a head on collision. They didn’t beam me out in time during the test.”
“I’m not here to heal him. I’m here to take him.” Cas says, low and soft. “I’m taking him to heaven”
"Are you hungry?" Castiel says quietly. Almost as if his voice could set off an explosive if it's too loud.
"Boy, you sure know how to treat a lady," Dean smirks. Castiel watches as the smirk fades away. "Let me guess, you don't have money in the future."
His voice was shaky and so unlike Castiel. As Cas stumbled to get more words out, a light flicked in Dean's peripheral. He turned to look, but before he realized what it was, the hull just below Castiel's window was hit with a torpedo. The ship shook and sparks flew as the men were sent to the ground.
"To the bridge." Sam answered, trailing behind. The walk was silent until the brothers turned down a hall.
"It's ok Cas." Dean starts, voice low and quiet. It sounds like he's eaten glass and gargled acid, but it's still his voice. It's still Dean. He coughs a few times, blood splattering forward. He clears his throat and continues as Uriel stops moving. Waiting. "It's ok. If it had to be someone ...." The first tear breaks over Dean's eyelid and falls down the contours of his face to his mouth. Castiel can't look away from it, how the tear clings to Dean's face. How Dean is still here after all this time. When Dean speaks again, it's like Castiel is hearing him for the first time. "I'm glad it's you ... " Dean's eyes lock to Castiel's and never leaves. "I'm glad it's you." He closes his mouth and even though it trembles now, the smile stays.
With the pocket knife, Castiel digs into the synthetic muscles and finds a wire. He pulls gently till the wire is coming out of his hand. There's enough slack that he's able to cut the wire leaving about two inches sticking out. He takes Dean's card from his hand and cuts a slit in the card. He pulls the wire and runs it through the card.
The impossible feeling returns, feels like a ball in his throat, aching to be released. Castiel thinks about lying again. He's becoming better and better at it as time goes on. He looks back to Dean, but not at his eyes. He looks back down into the Walgreen's bag, now soaked in blood.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel said, anger mixed in with every syllable. The one person he didn’t want to deal with, or rather couldn’t deal with.
Dean had received additional orders that morning from his father saying that he was to take out the man who killed Mary - a man named Ejiul Neral who was beamed back off the Durus once the Auroto decided to retreat. Search and destroy. Ignore other targets. A life for a life. Dean had yet to share this new order with anyone, including Cas. Dean knew the orders were a pile of bull but something in him tugged him forward. Dean finally spoke.
“You can Sam. He said it himself. You can. You are strong, you have survived so much and come out the other side kinder and wiser. I wish … I wish he had more time here, but we don’t always get what we deserve.”
“Yes sir.” Dean said, still not looking at his father. He turned again to leave and was just at the door when John spoke again.
They had parked a block away across the street to avoid tracking, but now that meant they'd have to cross the open road. Castiel stares at the distance between them and the car. It’s a long way, but they have to make it. They have to.
"Dean, I said hold still." Cas said staring down at the tri-corder in his hand. Dean chuckled, looking away.
"Yeah, well. It really feels like I don't." Dean leans against the Impala and shoves his hands in his pockets. His face falls and lolls to either side. Castiel can almost see his will breaking.
"Thank you Commander. Well, I should be returning to my duties. I will be in my office if anyone requires my assistance. The Captain can return to his duties when he is ready." Cas glanced back to Dean before nodding to Sam and returning to his office. Dean watched as Cas left and ran a hand through his hair. He took a deep breath and looked to Sam.
"Fine … fine. Dropping it. Now, I've talked to the Romulans and they've agreed to let us go. We've given them food and supplies and the medics are almost done treating their wounded."
"Oh hell, we watched Superman at the Academy, I know we did. At uh, one of those vintage movie theaters. I remember because you kept saying that it was 'illogical' that no one knew Superman and Clark Kent were the same person. Or did you forget that we got thrown out because you made those comments out loud, during the movie, with a packed audience?" Dean said seeing a small smile stretch across Castiel's face.
"Uh ... yeah ... Uh The uh bunkmates, we were like a family. There was this scrawny kid, Garth. Ugh ... He was in way over his head but he didn't give up, not once. Everyone gave him shit but by the end of it, he was the one giving out advice and making an impression. I think he's a park ranger now in Colorado. Got a wife and kids and everything."
"Son of a bitch!" Dean grunts out. His head rolls back to hit the cool window of the backseat of the Impala. The sound of Dean's pain echoes in the empty parking lot across from the pharmacy Castiel just came from.
"Trust me, Cas. That man can take care of himself. He's got hideouts and go bags all over the country. If anyone's gonna survive the future, it's him. He'll be fine."
“That ... was a Terminator. Model name Global Advanced Defense: Revision - Eliminator Line or Gadreel. He’s a cybernetic organism sent back in time nine years from now to kill you. In the future, a military defense program called Skynet becomes sentient and turns against humanity bringing on the destruction of the world. That apocalypse was halted by John and Sarah Connor. A new force named Legion adopted the same technology and 4 Years from now Legion will attack the world. Few humans survive, but those that do build a resistance. You, along with a handful of others, become leaders in that resistance under a woman named Dani Ramos.” He should go on. He could, but the pained look on Dean's face tells him to stop. There’s a long pause, long enough for Castiel to scan their surroundings and get a negative reading on Gadreel's power core.
"Lemme guess, no Lethal Weapon in the future?” Dean says. Castiel’s blank stare answers the question for him.
hero who defied that statement and saved his friend anyway." Dean let out a breath and let his head sway a little.
Dean glared at Lucifer and let go of Cas. He took a step forward. Lucifer raised his hand and with a flick of the wrist, he sent Dean flying into a wall of books. Cas stumbled to his side to help him up. Lucifer still stood crossing his arms.
"Nothing you don't already know, Dean." Sam said leaning back and pressing a few buttons on his chair.
The conference room was usually empty, given that the senior staff of the USS Argenteus never really liked sitting in a small room arguing about their next move. They preferred their battle stations to the tall red chairs and the thin aluminum oval table. Nevertheless, Dean had called a meeting to give the new orders. Dean sat at the head of the long table and tried his best not to watch Castiel on the opposite end of the table. Dean explained their new mission – changing course, finding the Romulan rebels and taking them out - effectively abandoning their old mission. Needless to say, his crew didn't like it.
"God, fine. Um .... What is it ... Uh." Dean runs his free hand over his mouth. " Uh ... oh ... You're not dead until I tell you. You got that Riggs?"
The Impala slammed into the wall of the cube and detonated on impact. Inside Lucifer’s  cube, shrapnel flew and an explosion set off by the second torpedo ripped Lucifer a new one. As his neural net failed, so did the smaller cubes. Electric currents spiked and shorted out as the Argenteus slipped into warp drive.
Sam returns to the barn, bundles of fabric in hand. He stops for a moment in front of Dean's body. He kneels next to Dean and places a hand on his shoulder. Dean and Cas see Sam's back heave and shutter as tears drop onto Dean's blood-soaked jacket.
"My destiny?" Dean laughs hard for a moment. "There's no such thing." Dean throws his arms out at his sides. "That's just your bullshit way of saying, 'You have no choice, do what I say'." Dean closes his hands into fists. For a second, Castiel thinks that Dean is about to swing at him.
Unit 13's grip on Dean's neck is loose as they look back at Dean. His eyes are full of water. The rest of his face though is cold, vacant but searching Unit 13's face. Unit 13's processors sense the man's eyes dilating, indicating recognition, but a recognition that is impossible to return. Impossible to comprehend.
“He told me when you graduated. When you went to the hospital after he broke your nose. He fought with you about discipline because he thought he could save you. But, even then Dad knew you were too stubborn to let Cas go. Even though you hide it, he knew it would never go away. He said Mom was the same way.“
"Screw him, screw the orders." Dean looked down and then back to Sammy. He touched his badge and spoke to the ship's crew.
“Deck 7 then.” Dean waited as the turbo lift lowered him. Dean had avoided this discussion over the years. Whenever Castiel asked about his mother, he'd say she died on duty and that was it. Nothing else. It wasn't a lie - she did die on duty. But the circumstances? Dean couldn't face them. He couldn't face the blame that both he and his father put on him.
"Cas, it's me." Dean gasped for air. Cas tilted his head. "It's Dean, your best friend. Please." Dean coughed out as he placed a hand on Castiel's shoulder. Cas blinked and looked to the hand. He looked back to Dean and squinted.
"I ..." Castiel starts. "Yes. I am a Terminator. My name ... My model is The Cyberdyne 4th System: T13 Legacy, or as you called me, Castiel. My specialty is human infiltration, with blending and learning being my strengths. Although, you always said I could never get the hang of humanities quirks." He forces a small calculated smile. He watches Dean. Looking through the glass of the window forces a memory to surface. A memory of being dragged away from Dean, the rifle being pulled from his hands. Of being thrown into a containment room while Terminators swarmed Dean.
Dean looks to Castiel again and doesn’t look away. He pulls the whiskey to his lips but doesn't drink. He just holds the bottle there where his warm breath blooms on the cold bottle. Castiel meets his gaze and cocks his head to the side. Castiel notes Dean’s eyes dilate and his heart rate picks up.
He put an arm around Castiel's waist and pulled him toward the door and down the long hallway. Dean glanced out the bay window and saw lighting flashing across the sky. That’s when he heard it - a laugh echoing in the library.
"Yeah … yeah, I um … Yeah.” Dean, almost coughing out his words. Dean lifts the bottle to his face again but Castiel puts a hand up.
Dean turned away from the door. He felt sweat start to bead on his forehead. He closed his eyes and laid a hand on his phaser. He turned to look at the clearing again to see the women walking toward him. They had no clue Dean was there, and all he could do was stand, get as close to the wall as possible, and hope that they turned down the other corridor. He closed his eyes as he heard their footsteps and held his breath as they passed. He heard the footsteps receed and opened his eyes. He glanced around and let out a quiet breath. He turned back to the opening and took quiet steps toward the man, still hovering over the basket. Dean tiptoed until he was right behind the Romulan. He tapped the man on the shoulder and when Ejhil turned around with wide eyes, Dean covered the man’s mouth.
“I said run, you have to get out of here!” Castiel yells as he raises the muffler and swings it against the Terminator's head. The metal dents with a metallic crunch and knocks the Terminator’s head to the side.
"You're really just gonna stand there ..." Dean grumbles turning over in the motel bed. He faces Castiel now, who is standing in the corner opposite the bed, shotgun in hand.
“It is.” Dean looked to Sam. “I’ve decided to hand myself and my brother over to you, if and only if you leave Earth and this ship alone.” Sam was trying his hardest to look hurt. The crew looked pained.
"Well, it's creepy. I can't sleep like this. I bet I’d sleep better in the car." Dean says laying on his back, staring at the ceiling. Silence takes the room quickly until the only sound is traffic from the highway a few streets over. Dean opens his mouth a few times, maybe trying to start different sentences and failing to complete the first sound. He finally manages ...
“Cas, what am I supposed to do,” Sam says as his head drops, finally letting the knife drop out of his hands.
Dean looks at him, sun shining on his face. He notices the way his eyelids droop and the way his lips spread across his face. His throat runs dry as Cas’ last words to him before the empty took him, play in his head. Cas starts to walk forward but Dean puts out a hand, grabs Cas' trench, and swings his arm back. Cas stops in his tracks and faces Dean.
“Cas! Calm down! Look at me. Don’t look at him, look at me.” Dean said. He grabbed Castiel’s chin in his hand.
Dean pulled the purple uniform undershirt over his head. He glanced up to Cas who was rearranging the hyposprays. Dean closed his eyes and shook his head again as he pulled on his socks, pants and shoes. Just as Dean pulled his uniform top over his head, the sick bay door slid open and Sam walked in.
"What is the use of emotion if it makes you weak. Unit 13 shows weakness. He protects the human when humans are what we destroy." Gadreel says as he grabs at Castiel's collar. "It is a malfunction and should be corrected."
“I know that, and I also know that he’s a soft spot for you. Always has been, ever since you two met at orientation. You have to be strong, Dean, and I know you can be. But he makes you weak, Dean. He also makes you blind. You think the Borg are the only thing out there threatening Federation Space? No, but you want to fight them because his brother was killed in the line of duty.”
"Why," Gadreel says. "He is a human. We destroy humans. They are weak to their condition." Castiel can't respond.
Castiel cocks his head to the side. Dean has never looked this vulnerable, this small and quiet. Castiel wonders where this came from, where the Dean who was ready to shoot a Terminator without question went.
Unit 13 moves to hover over Dean as he reaches towards his neck. His hands close over it easily and squeeze.
"Don't start citing Starfleet protocol at me, because I know what you're going to say, and I don't want to hear it. I'm going. That's final." Dean paused and glanced to Cas. "I have to." Dean hated the tone that he was using now. It sounded just like his father - too much like his father.
Castiel opted to lean at a spot on the wall, a place where he could see through the window and have a beeline to the front door at the same time.
“I don’t believe you have,” Cas says taking Dean's hand and stroking his thumb along the back. Cas looks out the window. “It’s almost time”.
"Cas, what do I do? What the hell am I supposed to do?" Dean says. It's all Cas can sense at first is Dean's voice. His vision is still dark red and his sensors are calling out malfunction after malfunction. Castiel blinks and pushes his hands down, trying to push himself off the ground. Dean loops a hand under one of Castiel's arms and pulls him up.
“Sam. I am truly sorry. Neither of you deserved this end. Jack … he doesn’t want to chance fate. Not like Chuck did. He played with our lives and we all know how that ended. What I can tell you is that he’ll be with everyone you have lost. I know it seems dismal and hopeless but … his hope continues with you. Making the most of your life.” Cas says. He places a hand on Sam's shoulder. “I will always be there for you Sam. For anything. Just, send a prayer and I will be here.”
Space, Cas noted, always had a blue tone to it when there was a funeral. The stars burned a little cooler and the space dwelling specks steered clear of the USS Argenteus. The ship was on course back to Starfleet Command where Castiel’s sister would join him in sending Samandriel off in a proper Starfleet funeral. Dean had been following Cas around when he wasn't on duty for the past few days, bothering him about everything. Really though, Dean wanted Cas to feel something other than guilt. Cas had been pretty mellow since his freak out in sick bay - which is common for Cas - but it was the kind of mellow that made Dean and even the rest of the crew wary. Dean really just wanted to see Cas smile again. Not a cheeky little up turn of the lips, but a full ear to ear smile. The last time Cas smiled like that was when he found out he'd be serving on Dean's ship. That was three years ago. Dean still kicks himself for not taking a picture.
"Are you an imbecile? It's a simple yes or no query. I know the answer, it's no. You're not. I’ve known you for sixteen years Dean. I think I know a little bit about who you are and who you aren’t. You don't think you deserve forgiveness, yet you put you're life on the line everyday for people you don't know. You have a crew that is loyal to you, and it's not just because you have those pips that you so clearly earned. It's because of who you are, Dean. You are righteous; you lead your crew with compassion and a thirst for justice. People care about you a
Castiel stands and places the bowl of beans next to Dean. He probably won't eat them and he probably won't look at Castiel in the eyes again until tomorrow. Castiel does it anyway. He has to. Well, at least that's what he knew for a long time. He has to help Dean, he has to protect Dean. He never questioned it until that "has to'' started to turn into "wants to".
“No, she can read people with empathic abilities, but … communication outside of the family is something she hasn’t reached yet.”
“Captian to the ship. Listen up everyone. I know we’re hurting, but Sam and I have one last go in us. We are gonna need you all behind us. We … we might not make it back from this one. We’re gonna take the impala and give Lucifer what he wants. Us. We need everyone here to get power to the ship so we can get out before it’s too late. Captian out.” Dean turned to Kevin.
"Oh for fucks sake. You're not even supposed to be sorry. It's ... you shouldn't feel it and it's my fault. It's all my fault. I just ... '' Dean turns completely away from Castiel now. "God I'm so sick of this. Of ... of feeling like this. Of feeling. Period. It's too fuckin much, man." Dean takes another drink and turns, sliding down the concrete wall.
"Dean, you've got to wake up. You ... You can't ..." Castiel says. He's quiet, speaking low enough that the engine covers his voice. "Dean." He starts again. Louder this time. "Dean, wake up. This isn't it for you Dean." Castiel takes a turn down a street away from the downtown area the bank was in. "Dean!" He yells this time.
“Trust me, he's not.” Castiel pauses pushing Dean back towards the counter. Dean looks down at Castiel's hand and moves away from it.
"This one," Dean says, pointing to a metal door with a grated window. The metallic thud of the door slamming echoes in Castiel's ears as Dean reaches for the front door too. Castiel blinks and grips under Dean's arm tighter as he helps him up onto the curb and across the sidewalk.
"Cas?" Dean said. He reached for the silver knob of the door, but just as he touched the cool metal, a scream and another crash erupted from behind the door.
"Prior to my admittance to Starfleet Academy, I was trained in over twenty styles of martial arts, spanning Betazoid, Vulcan, Klingon, and human techniques. I am also well versed in Vulcan Nerve Binding. I can easily 'take an opponent down'. I normally don't use physical force, unless the situation is dire enough. Getting you out of that cave was a dire situation. You can sit up now. I need to take a few more scans." Dean sat up as Cas scanned his back, and neck. Cas rounded the table and Dean could swear he could see Cas blushing ever so slightly as he scanned Dean's bare chest.
“Cas, I know you hate it, and believe me I agree, it's the craziest thing we’ve ever done. But crazy comes with the job, right?” Dean said forcing a smile and stepping into the Impala. Cas shook his head as he followed Dean. Dean sat at the helm and brought the Impala online and started punching buttons, turning his back to Cas who stood in the middle of the Impala, staring daggers at the back of Dean's head.
“Alright Castiel, break it, you owe me,” Dean says. “Nearest highway is about a mile away, just have to make a few turns.” Castiel feels the gun hit his hand but the sound of his name coming out of Dean's mouth, its all he hears. It's all he can feel ... sense. All other sound is sucked out of the air.
Dean chuckled, thinking back to their senior year in the Academy when Castiel drank enough Romulan ale to start belting Klingon opera wearing nothing but his medic's coat in the middle of the quad.
“Our plan falls apart, got it. Alright, how are shields?” A blast rattled the port side of the shuttle and sent sparks flying behind their heads.
"He will gain a target on his back if we go there, Dean," Castiel says, retaking his place against the wall. Castiel searches his memory processor for Rufus. Nothing comes up, not even a blip.
Dean's been dragged into the shooting range. He's been bashed across the face and his jumpsuit is in tatters. Uriel stands to his side, his own fists bloody. He looks up towards Castiel.
"Dean!" He yells. Passer-byers stop and look. He was louder than he intended, his voice sounding like the growl of an engine, but it worked. Dean stops dead in his tracks. Castiel quickly closes the distance between them and reaches up. "Give me that."
“No, Dean. It’s alright. You are my Captain and I will follow your orders as I always have. However, I feel the need to remind you that I am also your friend, not your weapon.”
Dean stared down at the book. He would be lying if he said that he wasn't a little curious about the sheer volume of the book. It’s not that he wasn't worried. Dean was beyond worried, but this was too much to pass over. Dean saw a red bookmark sticking out between two pages. He raised his brows and reached for the bookmark and pulled the book open. At the top of the page was a date. A familiar one, a date Dean recognized as the day before Castiel returned from his mission on Betazed all those years ago.
While Dean’s always thought a bank heist would be cool, Castiel hacking into an ATM for cash, isn’t what he had in mind.
"They won't be able to stop him, not unless you kill him. Vulcan-Betazoid physiology is a treacherously beautiful thing. My siblings and I are some of the most telepathically gifted in the universe, yet my siblings refuse to hone their abilities as I have. They could be fierce forces of their own. I know Anna and Samandriel seemed like cute little kittens, but the constant war between Vulcan logic and the Betazoid propensity towards drama and decadence is … well it's the perfect storm. You and I both know the wrath Castiel can conjure. Imagine what he could do under my control."
"Yes, I shot her." Ejhil whispered. Dean looked to the ground again. Somehow, he knew this was wrong. But he couldn't let it slide. He finally had a punching bag that wasn't his own psyche.
“Yes, and too soon I might add. If I’d have known you’d die this soon I wouldn’t have …” Cas trails off as he looks down to his feet. A weak smile lingers there.
Electricity arcs across a street lamp, shorting its bulb. Glass shatters and sprinkles the ground while sparks fly from the live wire. A five-foot-tall iridescent bubble shears into existence, cutting into the street lamp at its base and forming a crater in the ground. The bubble dissolves as the street lamp teeters and falls with a crash. A figure emerges shaky, his legs waver for just a moment. A white-hot heat radiates through Castiel's hyper alloy skeleton as his hands fall to the concrete.
“It’s the same ship that attacked us thirty years ago.” John paused. “Their last known coordinates are near a planet called Mab-bu. It's about twenty light-years from here." John squinted at Dean as he averted his eyes and stared at the pad.
Dean never thought he was good at much, so it was a pretty big leap when he joined Starfleet at 18, graduated with honors, and became a Captain in record time. Sure, Dean was proud to be a Captain; but there was never a moment when he didn’t second-guess himself.
Another firecracker went off. Only this time it was outside of the ship, and it wasn’t a firecracker. It was a photon charge aimed directly at the shuttles nacelles. Smaller Borg cubes started appearing just behind Lucifers, and they were closing in fast.
Cas stared at Dean a moment longer. He turned back to the console and hit a few buttons, bringing up the route again. Dean stood there, frozen. He felt his heart clench up and the whipser in his head echo and rattle around his head. Cas punched a few more buttons that brought up the schematic of the Auruto. He looked back to Dean who was still bracing himself on the console.
"Yes, Dean. That first volley hurt you pretty bad didn't it, and I'm just getting started. Just give up. It'll be easier for everyone involved. I don't think you all want to end up like Samandriel, now do you?" A grin spread across Lucifer’s face as Dean turned his back to the screen. He gritted his teeth and tried his best to hold himself back. He turned back around and took quick steps to the helm, and braced himself on the piloting console.
"Dean. Don't walk a...." Castiel moves to follow Dean but stops when Dean looks back, eyes glaring back at him. "You can't call your brother." Dean turns fully facing Castiel now. "I won't allow you."
"Well," His head cocks to the side just a bit "Sounds like we gotta explode the son of a bitch." Dean grins wide at Castiel.
Castiel sits like this for approximately 37 minutes. Castiel could sit there forever really, holding Dean up against the harsh reality of the world. But, he knows in the morning Dean will be the furthest thing from warm. Will push Castiel away, keep him at arm's length. It’s as if the night calls out of him a ghost of his past self. The man he used to be. The one whose memories flow to the brim, threatening to spill over with just another drink of whiskey.
The Argenteus crawled along at impulse, while the crew worked on the warp engine. It had been two days since Dean made the order to go back to Zetar, and the crew had been working non-stop. They had at least two more weeks of searching to go through to get back to Lucifer and all Dean could really do was wait. The comm would beep to life every few minutes, but it was usually a small update, nothing out of the ordinary. Even Castiel was quiet. Dean hadn't heard his voice since the day before, but Dean just assumed he was busy. Dean sat in his ready room, sipping on a mug of coffee, and stared out his window, not really focusing on anything.
Dean merges into traffic and slows down, weaving in and out of it. He handles the car like a dream. Castiel reloads the shotgun and aims at the motorcycle’s tires. One-shot hits the car behind Gadreel and the other nicks Gadreels shoe. Gadreel looks down at his shoe, a twisted snarl crossing his face. He reaches behind his back and pulls out a large pistol. He aims at the Impala and fires off three shots. The first flies past the hood and hits the back of a delivery truck next to the Impala. The second one clips Dean’s headlight, sending glass flying in every direction. The third makes a loud thud as it hits the trunk.
Dean is standing in front of him wearing the grey jumpsuit, his back to Castiel. In front of him stands Uriel, Gadreel, and another Terminator. A242 - EL. An older model, Azazel was one of the first to receive human like emotions. The three stand all with guns pointed at Castiel, and by proxy, Dean. Castiel tries to place the time, this is later, a while before they break free but he feels something towards Dean. Loyalty. Something else, something still growing.
He heard footfalls behind him and he turned to look. He saw shadows moving against the hall. He turned back and the stench of blood on his hand hit him, shattering his hallucination. He looked to his hands and to the man barely breathing below him. John's grinning face was gone, and in its place was a bloody Romulan mess. Dean felt his throat close up a bit. He reached down to touch the man’s neck checking for a pulse. It was there, only barely.
“You hear that Sammy? We might just win this one.” Dean touched his badge, “I hear you Garth. Please tell me you have something. We’re dead in the water.”
"I’m not trying to be a hero. I’m trying to do the right thing. Besides, wasn't it your hero who said 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few … or the one'." Dean said biting his lip and raising his brows. Cas lips twitched into a small smile, but it faded quickly as he spoke again, making sure to stare straight at Dean.
"Are you sure you're ok, man?" Dean puts a hand up and almost lays it on Castiel's shoulder. He doesn't get the chance to because a bullet flies past his head, missing by only a foot or so. It strikes the brick facade of the back with a crack. "Shit" Dean yells, whipping his head around. Castiel does the same. They scan the street next to them.
“Anna, I wish the circumstances were better, but it’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm very sorry for your loss.” Dean said.
Castiel pulls Dean forward through the dark doorway down a hall that leads to an dank open room towards the back of the old brick building. The archway opens up to a large industrial style room with exposed beams and brick, license plates and deer taxidermy hanging on the walls. There's a green plaid couch next to a warm golden oak coffee table filled with hunting magazines. In a dark green recliner sits Rufus with a shotgun aimed directly at the two men. Rufus holds a look of contempt on his time worn face.
"I'm doing this." Dean said. Cas was silent a moment, but nodded and let Dean pass. Dean grabbed a phaser and went to the door.
"Captain, sit." John said, never looking away from the pad in his hands. Dean followed the order and let his eyes fix on the sharp corner of John's desk. John took another few minutes and finally looked at his son.
Dean stammered grasping for an answer. There it was again, the voice in his head, prodding him. What could Cas possibly have that would make him better.
"What? No. I'm calling Sam. I gotta let him know what's going on." Dean says moving past Castiel to the car.
"You have to ... pry that off" Castiel growls. "There's a ..." He's cut off by his own pain, almost as if his processor knows it's about to be reset. Dean reaches in his pocket for a knife as he pulls Castiel back in the chair, firmly holding him back. Dean places the knife in the crevice of the small square and begins working the knife in, prying at the plate until it wiggles itself free. The panel falls with a metallic sound on the ground. Behind the plate, Dean sees a deep well, with silver-plated fins all the way down. At the bottom, Dean can see a series of flat black lines.
"It's ..." Dean coughs. "It's your na..." Dean struggles to take a breath, gulping hard. Unit 13 could feel the muscles tense under his hands.
“Look, I know you’re scared, but Ash is doing everything he can to scan the surface of the planet to find them. You know we can’t send any shuttles down because the atmosphere's too dense. Ash doesn’t want to transport anyone else until he finds them. Dean, you need to Captain this ship.” Dean stopped dead in his tracks and turned to face his brother.
“You won't need the shuttle once I assimilate you.” The screen went black and 3 photon blasts came hurdling towards the nacelles.
“Lucifer’s gotta know something’s up.” Another blast shook their tail as the Borg cubes corralled the shuttle towards Lucifer’s cube.
"Well, what the hell am I supposed to do then, huh?" Dean says, loudly. Castiel looks at him and swallows. The woman next to her Nissan at the pump across the way stops and turns, craning her neck in their direction.
"You just can't stop saving my life, huh, Cas ... " Dean says, his words drifting as he leans back against the wall, letting his head loll back and land on Castiel’s shoulder.
"The Romulans aren't a threat right now, Dean, the Borg are. It doesn't make sense for Dad to send us like this." Dean glared at Sam until Sam stepped back.
"Buddy, what the hell?" Dean says putting his hands up in front of him, keeping his eyes on Castiel.
"Alright, let's do this. Garth, set a course back to Zetar. That'll be our best bet to find him. Jo, warp 7. Ash, scan for Borg activity. I'm sure Lucifer's on the move. We have at least forty lightyears to prepare. Everybody get to work, we gotta get the Argenteus in tip-top shape." Dean sat back down and looked to his brother again. He heard Castiel's voice in his head.
Dean's head cocks to one side and he takes a gulp of air. He squints his eyes and for a moment looks like he's going to speak.
"We must connect. A mind meld. Not a traditional meld. It will be more like a trip to the holodeck than a crossing of minds. He's in here with me. Find him." Cas said, groaning again.
“He’s waiting for our move. Cas and I outsmarted him in Cas’ noodle and now he wants a grudge match.”
Castiel pulls over and stops, gets out of the car, and opens the backseat. He forgot how much blood had pooled back here. His sensors couldn't pick up the thick iron scent until just now. Dean's covered in it and the smell wafts to him. Dean looks up at Castiel.
"Cas ... " Dean snaps in his face. The sound ricochets in Castiel's memory as he flicks to the future again, this time on the business end of a punch from Gadreel. The metal of his fist sparks against the bare metal gash on Castiel's face.
"You wanna know a little secret Castiel. That right there?" Rufus gestures with the shotgun to the metal framed doorway. "That's a silent metal detector. And when you stepped through it." Rufus pulls out a small phone in his hands. A notification bar blares on the screen. An X-Ray image appears once he clicks the bar. It shows Castiel, his metal skeleton and mechanical core. "You're whole body's a machine isn't it. If you got any proof of the alternative, be my guest. The way I see it, ain't no human gonna look me in the eyes like you did. I saw nothing starin' back at me, no soul so heart no nothin'. It's cause you ain't got one."
Castiel moves towards Dean and punches him in the jaw, hard enough that he hears a crack. Dean growls with pain but returns to his position sitting up against the wall. He spits blood out in front of him and lifts his eyes to Castiel's. He tries to force a smile but he winces reaching up to his jaw. Castiel pulls his fist back again and grabs Dean's collar with his other hand. He lands a punch on the side of Dean's head, throwing his head to the side. He throws Dean against the wall with a thud.
“God dammit Cas!” He growled. He rested his hands on his hips, not bothering to check if he had injured himself.
great deal. You are a good person. You can deny it and say that you're worthless but I know at least a solar systems worth of life-forms who think otherwise. Forget what your father says. You are a Starfleet Captain. You put on that uniform and you represent something, Dean. You represent goodness and hope. The very nature of Starfleet cries out for those things. Yet, you still don't believe that you are good. It is illogical to say the least."
Dean mulled over the word in his mind and felt his heart beat faster. Imzadi repeated in his mind over and over again and what used to be a dull echo; now was clear as day. All these years, Cas felt like this and didn’t say anything.
"There's an unnamed moon in it's orbit. It's the only M-class place around here. Should we go there?" Garth asked.
"If I had any currency, It would have disintegrated in the continuum jump," Castiel says almost shrugging.
?” Dean hung his head and waited. The door opened and he took a step without looking. He was met with something solid. He looked up to meet livid midnight blue eyes.
"Why do you keep calling me that?" Unit 13 finally speaks, their voice graveled and quiet. "My designation is ... Cyberdy..."
“I can rebuild her, I’ve done it before. Haven't I, baby.” Dean said, patting the hull of the Impala and making a few circles around her, checking her hull. Again, Castiel trailed close behind, trying to get Dean's attention. But, Dean couldn't face Cas. He couldn't face what he read in Castiel's brain. Cas, however, wouldn't let up.
“Cybernetic ... what, like robots?.” Dean shakes his head. He turns the car again down a one-way road. “But he was ... a guy." Dean continues looking down at his own lap.
"So, Captain, we obviously have no reason to fight these people. What's our move?" Dean looked at Sam. He knew what he had to do. He couldn’t let Lucifer get away, no matter what his father said.
Castiel obliges and opens the passenger door, not taking his eyes off of Dean until he's inside the mart. He turns his head and watches the street. It's quiet, early evening and Castiel breathes for what feels like the first time today. His memory processor is still repairing itself, but looking at Dean, hell, just being around him is ... enough it seems, to jog it.
"I ... I what?" Dean says, moving to Castiel's side. The last thing Castiel sees is Dean waving a hand in front of his face. He sees his mouth move but it's fading now into a different place. A different time. This is right before they escape.
Not until they landed on the moon. Dean looked out of the window and saw a rocky maroon landscape around the Impala. A rust colored dust coated the air, but Castiel deemed it safe enough to breathe.
"I know you doubt yourself, but ... " The way Dean closes his eyes and lets his head roll forward makes Castiel pause.  "You save a lot of people, Dean."
With that, the trio left in silence. Sam stayed on the bridge as Dean and Cas took the turbolift. Dean could feel Cas watch him as they walked the corridors. Normally, Dean just shrugged of the little staring contests they had, but this staring was different. It was sad, and pleading. Dean hated it. He stopped abruptly at the shuttle bay doors and turned to Cas.
“Of course. Anything for the Winchesters.” Cas pauses as he steps around to pull Sam into a hug. He pulls back and looks at Dean's body. “I have to go now, his soul is waiting.” Sam smiled weakly at Cas as he hears the flutter of wings. Sam looks down and lets his tears fall for a few moments before going to the car to start building a funeral pyre.
Some days when he looks at Cas; he swears he can see his wings or some glowing blue parts of his true form. He sees the wrinkled vessel that Cas stitched back together all those years ago. He sees the bright blue eyes and the windswept hair. Above all, when Dean looks at Cas, he sees love. He sees sacrifice, loyalty, pride. He sees the man who risked it all for him, over and over and over again.
lie. It's a part of their programming. Lying makes you more human, which makes you smarter, which makes you vulnerable. It's all part of the act. Looking at Dean now though, Castiel knows he wouldn't be able to look him in the eyes and tell him the truth, even in part. There would be questions, there would be consequences. So, Castiel looks away, stares up at the moon ... and lies.
"I am ...  I am begging you. Please ... Let me in." Castiel says, the last few words coming out as more of a growl than he intends.
Dean was silent, but he heard Cas mumbling behind him. He recognized his words as a Vulcan prayer of focus. He tried to heed Cas’ words, tried to push Lucifers words out. He felt a churning in his stomach. Dean watched Lucifers’ stoic face twist into a grin, stretched and pointed, just like his ears.
Dean lets out a wince that's muffled by the towel. He slams a fist against the passenger seat in front of him. Castiel pulls the towel back and tosses it into another bag. He grabs another towel and wipes at the wound. Blood has stopped pouring out of it, so Castiel grabs the large tweezers and leans down close to Dean's wound. His sensors still aren't working as they should, so Castiel has to recall as much first aid training as he can. He looks at the wound as he takes a lighter and passes the flame over the tweezers. He takes the tweezers and dives in, moving skin and muscle aside. Dean's back arches and his face scrunches up as he lets out a muffled yell.
"Do what you want to me. But don't .... don't hurt Dean." Castiel manages. His right arm hangs down after being broken by Gadreel earlier in their sparing.
“Dammit, shifty bastard…” Dean spat, “Cas I’m gonna get close to him, but you gotta give me a weapon. This is your brain. Use it.” Cas nodded and stood straighter, stronger. Dean looked around again and took off running towards the bay window. He figured If he could bash through the window, he could distract Lucifer long enough for Cas to gain control.
“Put pressure on it, Cas will fix you up if we make it out of this. Reroute everything to impulse power and hull integrity.”
“My job.” Dean said, picking up his pace as he walked to the shuttle bay. Castiel, however, kept up with him at every turn.
Months later, when Cas returned, a second voice haunted Dean's mind - a whisper. At first, Dean thought it was Cas messing with him, but this voice was different. It was an echo of a familiar but distant voice. The voice repeated one word over and over when Cas was around, but hard as Dean tried, he could never quite hear or make sense of it, and over the years he managed to push it away and ignore it.
Dean missed this. The playful bantering, the good stuff. And then it dawned on him. He stared at Cas, his saviour, as the whisper in his mind grew louder and louder. Though Dean would never admit it, he knew there was a feeling that was catching like fire, and it had been a slow burn, probably since the Academy days. It was like a burn in his stomach that stretched to every nerve now. He thought back to the staring contests, the telepathy and it all fit into place. It made sense, but at the same time it was terrifying. Two men thrown together by a wagon train to the stars.
"Look Castiel. I just ... You got that gash on your face with ... " Dean lowers his voice "With that stuff coming out of it. You know, I know what blood looks like, real blood. That ain't it. It’s the same as the other guys." He pauses placing a hand on the shotgun. "You're ... not human, are you?" Dean says.
Uriel begins to move away when Castiel raises the gun to Dean's face. He feels the cold metal in his hands itching to fulfill its purpose. He feels the concrete rubble under his feet crunch under his weight. The bright red blood falls from Dean's mouth as a smile spreads across his face. A smile that doesn't quite reach the eyes, because they're too busy welling up with tears.
“All due respect, Admiral, but I thought the Romulans were a neutral party now. Ever since the Dominion War …”
scared. Jesus, more like terrified. It was like there was something in his throat, begging to come out. It had been resting there making a home for years, but now it was breaking the door down.
Castiel stared at Dean and squinted just a bit. Dean flicked his eyes away for a moment, and he shifted a bit and let his mouth open ever so slightly. Cas felt his heart beat a little harder as he felt his eyes connect the freckles on Dean's face. Cas tugged at his sleeves a bit, not really knowing why. When he felt blood on the sleeves he remembered where they were and who was lying only a few feet away. Cas looked away and hopped off the bio bed. He walked to Samandriel's body and took off his lab coat, tossing it back to the empty bio bed. Dean followed him reminding himself that he has a job to do.
Not out of lack of ability, but lack of words. This is only a few weeks before they escape. 6 months before this, Castiel would have agreed with Gadreel. But, Looking through the glass to see Dean holding it together, almost as badly beaten as he is. Dean could have easily skated by as a programmer, but he didn't. He's stepped out of line, put himself in the way.
Castiel doesn't realize his hands are shaking too. He hears it first as the metal of the gun vibrating against itself and sees his aim is wavering. His eyes flick back to Dean, who opens his mouth again.
"Well ... " Dean starts, looking for a way to justify taking money out that isn't his. "I guess you're right."
“Dean, at least say something to the crew.” Sam said. Dean turned on his heel. He let his eyes pass over the crew and nodded. He didn’t want to linger too much on his feelings. He touched his badge and spoke.
“Cas … Cas you gotta take control of this.” Dean said gripping onto Castiel and standing with him. They looked to Lucifer, but he wasn’t there.
Dean glanced to Cas, but only for a moment. He knew that if he stared at Cas long enough, it would be all over. There was a laundry list of unsaid feelings floating between them, but Dean refused to deal. Though Dean had glimpsed inside Castiel's brain and saw how he felt about Dean, accepting that on the brink of death seemed like the biggest lie in the universe. Why spill everything if it means Cas will live in turmoil for the rest of his life? Keeping Cas in the dark, Dean decided, was the safest bet.
"Oh good, we don't need to bother with pleasantries. Let's get straight to the point. I'm going to board your ship, assimilate you and your crew, make a pit stop at Earth, assimilate another 7 billion or so, and then take over the universe, quadrant by quadrant." Lucifer said, dragging his gaze over every member of the bridge crew. Dean exhaled and shook his head.
"You didn't mean it? Oh well that fixes everything!" Dean said laughing. "That just makes it all better." Ejhil turned a bit but Dean grabbed him and pulled him back. He made a fist with his right hand and pulled it back. He swung and hit Ejhil right across the nose. He fell back, tripping over his feet. He screamed but everything was muffled now. Dean threw himself over Ejhil and laid punches on his face over and over again, all the while screaming.
Dean wanted to say there forever - sitting on the floor with their legs tangled together. Dean wondered how sitting like this didn't hurt, but the warmth of Castiel's arms slung around Dean shut that thought out. His eyes flicked open when he remembered the book in Castiel's brain - the one that held the word beloved.
"Tinman's got a heart, after all," Dean says as he looks to Castiel and lets out a sigh. Castiel looks back, eyeing the phone in Dean's hand. His eyes flick back to Dean's face, to his eyes. "Didn't think a killing machine could be sorry."
"I'm alive." Dean whispered to himself. He was sure he was a goner but the very real pain was now washing away. Dean tried to sit up but Cas held him back.
He watched Cas walk away and held back the fact that he hadn't had a good nights sleep in a long time. The word 'Nightmare' doesn't even begin to describe what happened when Dean tried to fall asleep. Usually it was his mother or Sam dying in some gruesome tragic twist of fate that Dean blamed himself for, but lately, Castiel had taken their places. Without thinking, Dean reached his hand up to where Cas' hand was minutes before. The lingering ghost of Castiel's touch was hot on his hand. He let out a low laugh realizing how ridiculous he might look, and let his hands rest at his sides. Dean turned back to the console and punched a few buttons, turning off the screen and dimming the lights. He closed his eyes and let his head hang low, something he did a lot of lately. He let the darkness wash over him, relishing the closest thing he'd get to sleep anytime soon.
He detects a sign for a clothing store. He scans the lock on the back door, grips it in two hands, and rips it in half, pulling open the door. He walks in as the loud klaxon of the building alarm sounds. He grabs the first few things he sees; gym shoes, a grey shirt, a black jacket, and jeans. He’s quick to put them on as the sound of police sirens gets closer. He rushes out the back door and scans everything he can, trying to jog his own memory. He has no time to stop and run a diagnostic check. He keeps moving. He doesn't have time.
"Dean, get back, It's a machine. It's dangerous." Rufus barks, moving to be between Dean and Castiel. "It's no friend of yours. It'll kill you, I'm sure of it."
Unit 13 scans the rest of the room to find that one wall, where Uriel entered, is bulletproof glass with seams that indicate a door. Across the way is another room identical to this one, but it's lacking a Legion unit and a human programmer. The metal table Unit 13 sits on registers as cold, even through the black jumpsuit they've finally noticed they're wearing. They move to stand but as their feet hit the floor a nerve signal is sent to their main processor. It registers as sharp, biting pain, and Unit 13 buckles under their own weight.
“How do you know that? I haven't ... I mean not even Sam,” Dean almost grumbles. Castiel sensors tell him Dean’s face is getting warmer. According to his programming, that usually accompanies anger. Castiel pauses, examining Dean's face, each line pinging a different memory.
“You read that?” Cas said cutting in, still staring at Dean. Dean threw his hands up, thinking Cas was offended.
"Dean, try not to speak. I'm getting you to sick bay." Cas put an arm around Dean clutching onto the man’s waist. He hoisted Dean up, making Dean cry out in pain.
"I ... was programmed to kill but I couldn't kill one target. I couldn't pull the trigger. I ... " Castiel stops and whips his head around as he hears the distant revving of a motor. He scans the highway and sees Gadreel, finally wearing clothes. He sits atop a large motorcycle and has started merging to take the exit toward the rest stop.
Dean was right for the most part about not needing sleep. He had driven for a full 12 hours and swerved only once before he pulled over at a motel at three in the morning. The room itself had peeling light blue wallpaper covering up some awful orange paint job. It had only one queen-sized bed with grey fleece blankets that felt like sandpaper, a lumpy blue chair, and a small dresser. It was the last room they had, but Dean was too tired to complain about the state of the place. He'd taken the room key and almost fallen asleep twice just walking over to the room.
"Cas." Dean chokes out as he reaches up to Unit 13's wrists, prying at them, using all of his strength. "Cas ... Dammit." He sputters. The creases in Dean's face only deepen as his face begins to turn white. "Castiel." He croaks.
Castiel stood, emotionless and put his arm back in his lab coat. He turned with now frantic eyes to see Dean, now almost passed out on the garden floor. Cas made a move to get to Dean, but the armed Romulan was back and stood in-between the men. Cas held up his arms.
"Don't fucking ... lie to me, Cas," Dean says, pointing the hand with the vodka bottle at him. "Don't you lie to me." Dean glares daggers at Castiel.
Dean blinks his eyes adjusting to a bright white-blue light. His vision clears and he sees the barn he was just in. Weird. He thinks. His vision falls down and he sees his own body, cold, lifeless. If he could feel the hairs on the back of his neck, they’d be standing up.
"Better than I thought. The human additions don't disrupt Unit 13's functions." Castiel looks down at his hands covered in bright red blood. He feels nothing. He looks up towards the voice and sees Uriel, watching from behind a window. Uriel tilts his head and looks next to him. Dean stands there looking down, never looking up to Castiel. Uriel speaks again, his voice scratchy through a speaker. "Too often brainless thugs get sent back and they are eliminated easily by humans. It is a delight to see you adapting so well, Unit 13. We'll be able to send you out soon enough."
"Look, Dean. No matter what anyone says, no matter what Cas says, you know what you are. You’re Dean Winchester. You barely pass as captain, you drove your father to be an abusive asshole and you killed your mother. You're a lost cause, kiddo. Everyone around you will die one day and theres nothing you can do about it. Those are facts. Join me and you can forget the skulking failure you are. You can become what you were meant to be - something worthwhile and powerful. Or is that a no.”
"I can generate extremely close approximations of human emotions," Castiel says, his voice quiet. "It's the best I can do."
