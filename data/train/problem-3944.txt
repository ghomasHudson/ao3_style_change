And then Castiel stood up straight, ready to fly out of the bunker and likely out of reach to Dean. Unbidden one word, the only word he’d only ever needed to say, bubbled up Dean’s throat and burst of his mouth, “Stay.” Castiel spun around quickly, his coat whipping around his ankles. He tilted his head slightly and furrowed his brow. Their eyes connected, and Dean lips quirked up in a small, almost imperceptible smile. “Please, Cas. Please just stay.”
Cas’s head dropped back against the wall and he sighed, rubbing at his eyes – a human gesture he picked up from Dean. “I’m not going to do this tonight,” Castiel barely whispered.
Dean chuckled, shucked off Castiel’s coat, his fingers went to work on his shirt. “Been the longest month of my life,” he breathed across Cas’s lips before kissing him hard, pulling at his lower lip with his teeth. Castiel found he could not make words to respond, so he just slid his hands up Dean’s shirt, nails raking his back instead. “Can’t tell you how much I need this, baby,” Dean added with a moan.
Dean was still looking at the spot where Castiel had been standing. He exhaled, reaching to touch the spot on his neck he knew a hickey had bloomed. “Yeah…I know.”
Heaven really was perfect, Dean thought, as he walked from his parents' house back to the impala. He looked over his shoulder, watching Mary lean into John, whose arm was wrapped around her. His mom and dad smiling from the porch of the home they deserved to have together.
It took Dean a moment to register that the music coming from the record player was the same song that had been playing in the car. Dean's insides felt warm and he smiled.
Castiel was pacing around the entrance to the bunker, his trench coat billowing in the night’s breeze. It had been four weeks, two days, thirteen hours, and thirty minutes since he’d last seen Dean, and the ache in his soul had been nearly unbearable. When he heard Dean’s call, nearly fifteen minutes ago now, he had not hesitated to fly, but he stopped short of his final destination. Castiel knew what would happen if he went into Dean’s bedroom --- he and Dean would tumble into bed, and it would be perfect. It was all Castiel’s heart and body wanted. And yet he was conflicted. This kind of relationship, if you could call it that, was not sustainable. He wasn’t even sure it was real if he was being completely honest with himself. Was it more selfish to keep taking what Dean was drunkenly willing to offer or to refuse Dean what he wanted? Castiel could not decide, and so he was stuck unable to move forward and terrified to go back.
“I’m just going to shower and sleep,” Dean answered flatly without looking at his brother. He walked around to the driver’s side, pulling his door open.
Dean strode over to Cas, pulling the sleeve out of his hand and tossing on the floor. He put his hands on either side of Cas' arms, fixing him with a determined look. "I love you too."
Watching Cas' face, Dean could feel a heat spread through his body, somewhere in the back of his mind he could hear Chuck's voice: You know what every other version of you did after "gripping him tight and raising him from Perdition?" They did what they were told. But not you.
And here he was again. Dean had begun sucking a mark onto a sensitive spot behind Castiel’s ear, pressing his warm body into the angel’s. All of the self-control was being sucked from his body as Dean’s mouth made it’s way back to Cas’s. Dean bit down on Castiel’s lip, and Cas groaned with pleasure. Dean chuckled and put his hand on the belt of Cas’s pants. “Do you have any idea how bad I want you, Cas?” Dean whispered against Castiel’s mouth, sex and alcohol mingling in his breath. Suddenly, Castiel’s mind was very clear. He put both hands on Dean’s chest and pushed him backward. Dean stumbled a little, wobbling dangerously. He plopped down on the bed, “Oh you want to get rough, angel?”
Dean's free hand slid down Cas' arm until he could lace their fingers together. "How about that drink?"
The right side of Dean’s body was cold. He rolled onto his side, eyes cracking open slowly. The empty space on the bed next to him gave no indication that a person had been there during the night, but Dean knew better. He could still feel hands on his body and lips against his skin. There had been no random hookup – no scouring the bar for a nameless woman. There had only been Castiel, and Dean was not in a position to pretend otherwise. His head was pounding, his mouth was desert dry, and stomach was roiling, but none of that compared to ache of having woken up alone. It was not as though he’d really expected, or even wanted he supposed, Castiel to stay the night, but disappointment still crashed in his gut.
Castiel broke the kiss to bite down on Dean’s neck, grinding hard against Dean’s thigh. Dean dug his nails into Castiel’s hair, groaning and cursing with pleasure. “God, Cas,” Dean moaned, “I need you.” And with that, Castiel shoved Dean backward until they both fell on to the bed.
Castiel took a few steps toward Dean, smiling, "What do you think?" He motioned around the barn, not taking his eyes off of Dean.
Dean parked the Impala in front of the barn's doors, and hurried out of the car to pull them open. Dean stepped inside, it was dimly lit, as it had been in his memory. There were wards and symbols painted on the walls and ceiling, which had proven useless all those years ago. The only difference was that now, in the corner of the room was a sitting area -- a couple leather arm chairs, a coffee table with books and a bottle of whiskey on it, and a record player.
Castiel lifted the arm from around his waist, stood from the bed, and gathered up his clothing. He looked down at Dean’s sleeping face. It was too much ---too much to have Dean press against him in his sleep, too much to have Dean writhing underneath him, and far too much to have Dean saying such perfect things while he reeked of alcohol. He mojo-ed back into his clothes and was gone.
At that, Dean's gaze dropped to his boots, he could feel his heart beating in his ears. It was like being in that god forsaken room in the bunker all over again -- the last place he had seen Castiel alive. He could feel the angel's eyes on him, so he took a deep breath.
Sex was one of the primal instincts for Dean. What couldn’t be dealt with violence, he dealt with with sex and apparently it had rubbed on Castiel, or maybe it was just that human body that couldn’t get enough of feeling Dean in any possible way,
“Cas?” he called a few minutes later, knowing the angel didn’t sleep but that he did something similar, sometimes, after sex. He got a low grunt in response, “you know when you fight and you turn all warrior-y and mighty, strong soldier of Heaven…” Castiel interrupted the description by raising his head to look at Dean, confused, a frown on his face.
It was a beautiful day, the sky over Ohio clear, the air just the right side of chilly. There were birds chirping and kids laughing, a relaxed chit chat coming from the small crowd.
“I love you too,” Castiel repeated, even his breath getting out in short puffs, and the words made Dean’s heart swell even more.
“Cas, whatever you have in mind,” Dean started, absolutely ignoring the flush he could feel on his cheek and the smile he knew he always had when embarrassed, so much for his great poker face, “whatever, man,” he finished, lamely, blushing even harder.
"Don't you ever do it again, Cass," Dean growled the second the angel broke the hug with Sam, pulling him into his chest once more. He needed to feel him, to smell his skin. It didn't have a real scent, and still, it smelled like Cass, something Dean could have recognized among a million Angels.
“You already sent me there, Dean,” Castiel growled, close to his lips, “I came back, sorry, bad plan,” he added, feeling the right to hold a grudge over that too, but then he just kissed Dean again, their usual way to make up, their way to say what pride or, probably stupidity, always kept them from saying out loud and this time Dean kissed back from the first moment. Still hard, still too close to a fight, lips and teeth and spit, but intimate, tasting of them and their reckless and complicated bond.
Dean looked down at the huge tray filled with every kind of pie he could imagine and took a deep breath. He closed his eyes, shaking his head.
He had lost everything in life, he had dealt with loss since he was 4, lost his dad, watched friends die, even his brother a few times, seen Bobby pass in front of him, lost his mother for the second time… so why didn't he know how to deal with this one loss? It even wasn't like he had always spent every minute with Cas, their time together always too spare and little, so he was more used to Castiel's absence than his presence. Not to mention he had already lost Castiel in the past. Sure he couldn't miss him in a situation like this one, in the middle of the night.
"Cas…" Dean started, but stopped, confused. What was he supposed to say to an Angel of the Lord telling him something like that while laying in bed with him? It felt huge, it felt scarier than anything he had ever faced, Hell included, and it felt like the biggest luck of his life. The only one maybe, but he was okay with not having anything else, Castiel was more than enough, Castiel was more luck than he could even imagine. Something too big for him to deserve. Some things just didn't happen to guys like him. Or at all. Who the hell ever had an Angel talking to them about their deep bond? He got his hands on Castiel's legs, running them up and down his thighs, just to have something to touch.
It was a handful of seconds later that Dean felt a familiar rustling, and his heart seemed to stop for a moment while he turned.
To Dean, it felt like he could start to breathe again as if his chest could finally fill with air after days. Castiel was back and his again.
Who was he kidding? He had one regret, keeping him awake as much of the pain: he didn't answer to those three words.
"We all have, but you can't turn it all on me! I'm tired of being the scapegoat to clean your conscience or the one you use to take out your frustration!" Castiel lowered his voice to a menacing growl. He took one more step and the pointed finger got pressed against Dean's chest.
It was strange and definitely electric. It was like kissing the lighting Castiel smelled like, every hair on his body suddenly standing on attention and his heart gave an odd flutter. It really felt like being electrocuted, in the best way Dean could imagine.
“Good luck with that, you’ll soon learn that it will take more patience than even an Angel can find.”
“Cas?” Dean called after a few seconds, “mind to share with the class?” he asked, slowly running his fingernail down the pale back, smiling at the pink marks he left behind.
"Cas?" Dean frowned, confused, "I'm not sure where you are going with this, but I'm sure it's not like whatever you are thinking. I don’t see what…."
Castiel bent his back, searching for more contact and that pushed his hips down, forcing his cock to press against Dean's. Both men gasped, neither able to keep himself from moving and rub their cocks together.
Castiel had bent, even more, forehead pressed against Dean’s legs, hips now moving in quick and short thrusts. He was close, his body thrumming with pleasure, every spank a slight pang of pain that ran straight to his neglected cock, just occasionally barely brushing the skin under him. He let go of the cheek he was still holding open, grabbing Dean’s calf instead, hand outstretched in front of him.
Castiel stopped when he decided Dean’s lungs must really be burning, hungry for air when he felt him struggle with something different than anger. He pushed his hips forward, instead, another way to pin Dean against the wall.
They kissed again, their lips and tongues getting hungrier and hungrier, teeth biting and pulling on sucked lips, stubble scratching and marking the delicate skin until their mouths were red and puffy, wet with each other's saliva.
“I thought you might enjoy a familiar form and honestly, for human standards that’s a pretty hot one, but you already know it, right?” Slowly the creature walked in front of him, touching his bound and hurt, arm in the passing, and stopped a few steps away from his face, head slightly tilted, “what do you think, good enough?” it asked in an amused tone.
"No! You don't stop loving a son! You lost your mother and you were just ready to take the kid from me! You wanted to inflict that pain on me just to try and fill the emptiness that you already knew you couldn't fill! Not like that! But you didn't care, so you just shoved hate inside it!" Castiel didn't even notice he had grabbed Dean by the shirt, not until he heard the hunter's back hit the wall with a painful bang, "you did that your whole life, but this time you destroyed two of the most precious things you had just not to deal with your pain and regrets," he accused
“Dean,” Castiel moaned again, a broken puff of air. His world started and finished with the hand around his cock, with the cock hitting his prostate at every upstroke, dragging over it again and again. He felt his body burn from the inside out, his blood boiling in his veins while it ran south, hot and pulsing between his legs. A few more strokes and the hold in Dean’s hair tightened, the hand convulsing around them. Castiel's body went taught, back bent, mouth open in a scream that had not enough air to come out.
“Feel free to do it again,” the angel used a reassuring voice but didn’t hide the arousal leaking through his words.
“So, if you wanted to prove to me I can go a little kinkier with you, I can assure I got the message,” he smirked, eyebrows slightly raised in the wait of a reaction.
"I guess you'd say we're both hot messes?" Castiel tried the words carefully like he was expecting to say something wrong and non-sense and this time Dean laughed, eyes crinkling at the corners.
It was probably wrong, what they were doing; if a Nephilim was an abomination deserving only death, to lay with the man you saved from Hell couldn't be much better, but Castiel didn't care. His Father was gone, Heaven was a more unorganized mess than Hell had ever been and at that point, his brothers and sisters had so much to judge and hate him for that his being in love with a human was the last of the problems. Still, Castiel knew that not even God himself could have stopped him now. No, not even his Father would have been enough to take Dean away from him. He was up to anything for his human. He was more than ready to give up his wings and his Grace for him. He already did, to be honest, more than once, in various ways. He never regretted it.
"I'm sorry, you needed to survive and there wasn't another way. You didn't need to know about the deal, it would have only slowed our mission and unnecessarily burdened you even more."
“Don’t care,” Dean shook his head, raising his naked leg on Castiel’s hip, over the trench coat. It felt even dirtier with their clothes on, even more like what it was: their exorcism.
It took Castiel half a second to open Dean’s jeans and push them down, looking just to see him quickly kick off a shoe to free one leg from the pants, leaving them still around the other ankle, over the remaining shoe. A  moment later Castiel was pushing back against him, cocks, sliding against each other wetly.
"When I woke up," Castiel started before Dean could say more, voice lower and rougher than usual, yet uncertain, "it was dark and scary but my first thought was that I needed to get back, I told whatever that creature was that you and Sam needed me, I told myself that I needed to come back to help you with the huge fights ahead, but what I was too scared to admit was that I wanted back because I needed you. I love Sam, but it never was about him. Or the fight. I just couldn't think of being dead or being stuck there forever simply because you weren't there. I had to come back to you and I must confess there was little selflessness about it, as an Angel I failed again because that need was driven by my own desires and needs," he smiles sadly, averting his gaze, but Dean shook his head.
“The reason, I don’t care about it, what I know is that you died with that hope in your heart, that you spent every second here thinking, hoping, Dean would still remember you. You’re so stupid you even thought he’d do something to rescue you. So cute and naive,” it circled around him, touching his body, pulling on the already too tense ropes, “Dean forgot about you the moment he saw his brother. He never cared, Castiel. Actually, I think he was even a little disgusted by your confession, come on, an angel, the one he called family and friend wanting to get his paws on him?” the entity tutted, shaking his head, “not nice if  you get my clue.”
“Do you really think you’d have felt better, getting me killed? Would you have justified yourself that it was to save the World? Is that how little you can control your anger?” but Castiel didn’t wait for an answer he knew he would have never got, one that, maybe, under all the anger and pain he still knew, instead he pushed forward, pushing his lips against Dean’s in a furious kiss.
"Cas! Come on, I know you are around, you just can't ignore me forever!" Dean yelled at the night sky.
He was against chick flick moments, but apparently, he had lived the past hour like he was straight out of a teen movie for girls, so he could at least admit to himself that with Cass near him even that crappy place could feel home-y.
"Dean, I'd die for you another thousand times," Castiel interrupted, placing his own hand on Dean's arm, and Dean could feel it like the touch burned, the place where Castiel had touched him the first and the last time. Their place. Their scar. The proof of their bond.
"So you're ready to lose him from your sight for a few minutes?" And that, that was Sam teasing him, and damn if Dean wasn't going to make him pay. Mostly because he was right and he hated when that happened. He was the older brother, he should have been always right.
“Can...can I lick you, while you go on with the show?” Dean asked, suddenly needing permission, finger gone from the hole and voice a little shyer than he’d like.
"No, not that, I can totally eat these pies. I can't be happy, Sam. I tried and this new life feels great and it's what I've always wanted, what mom had always dreamt for us. I have a dog, a home, nothing to keep me up at night, no fear that you or I are gonna die tomorrow…"
Castiel resolve of following his plan faltered for a second, the need of going back to those lips, to the warm taste of Dean, a sinful pull, but he took a deep breath and shook his head.
He swallowed a few times, trying to order his arm to move and open the bedside drawer, but his brain seemed too busy watching the angel sitting on his chest, his cock dribbling on overheated skin and the dampness of his spread ass pressing against him. It took him all he had not to reach for Castiel, to go, instead, for the drawer, but the angel stopped him.
There was nothing dignifying in the acute moan that left Dean’s lips, but he was sure no one could have blamed him, not with those sinful lips sucking on his head and slightly slipping down his shaft, both Castiel’s hands at the top of his thighs to keep him still. A better yet reason to moan, though, was the angel’s ass almost in front of his face, spread by the legs forced open to straddle him.
“Still with me, Dean?” the angel purred, his voice a low rasp. He rotated his hips a little before sinking lower, a moan escaping his lips when the head finally sank in. It was big and intense, it burned more than any other time, with a lot of fingers action and lube, but still, Castiel was ready to swear it was the best thing he had ever felt. The stretch, the idea it was only him and Dean, their bodies perfectly adapting, his hole tightening around the cock, grabbing it.
“I think even my toes are tingling from that orgasm,” Dean commented after a few seconds, a smile in his lazy voice.
Castiel flinched, a wave of nausea similar to a punch in the stomach. He knew that voice, he knew it better than his own, his world, his whole being had depended on that voice.
“I should have stayed before too. Sam, you’re family and I swore to protect you, and now Jack, with my life,” Sam nodded, lips pressed together, “but Dean...our bond has nothing to do with Hell or Heaven, I just have a personal need to share every day of my life with your brother,” Sam raised the corner of his mouth, then chuckled.
"You love me," Castiel repeated, voice low and broken, coming out in little more than a rasp in his bewilderment.
“He killed my mother!” Dean shouted back, pupils blown wide, hands tightening on Castiel’s trenchcoat.
Dean shook his head with a small smile. He wanted to smile for real, to laugh, to howl at the sky or just scream that he got his Cass back, but he felt frozen inside himself, he had since the moment he had picked up the phone, heard that voice. His heart had skipped a beat and for a second he had been sure it was a very cruel joke or a new torture from some demon, but then the need to believe had taken over. And now that he was there, with Castiel in his arms, real and solid, it was like he was feeling too much all together to get any other reaction, to do more than desperately cling to the Angel like he was going to explode the second he was going to allow himself to completely feel.
"Cas? Maybe things changed and you can hear me from where you are?" He whispered to the empty room, "I...I miss you, man. I thought I could do it, be happy, live a free life, what you gave your life for me to have, all of it, but I can't. It's just a play, Cas, I’m just going through the motions of how things are supposed to be now. A dog, clean clothes, healthy food," Dean rubbed a hand on his face, "damnit Cas! How could you die on me like that? How can you leave me with no one listening to my prayers, without my best friend, without the one…" he stopped, eyes burning with the beginning of tears, just one already sliding on his cheek, "I can barely remember your scent, Cas, it's like it's fading from my memory a little more every day and I can't go on without your scent. Cas I can't live with the idea of you fading in my head," his hands were shaking as much as his voice, his chest hurt.
Lips pressed together so hard the skin broke against teeth, and then when Dean moaned in surprise, or maybe pain, Castiel took control of his mouth with the same burning fury, licking and plunging, biting on the already ruined lips, taking and taking until Dean really started to struggle for breath and at that point he tightened the hold on his wrists even more and kept going, kept kissing, snorting when Dean, out of breath, started to kiss back with the same anger, eyes open, trying to see each other soul.
“Dean,” Castiel moaned a single, desperate word. He didn’t know what he needed, he had control, he didn’t want to come, not yet, and still, he needed. Something. More.
“Man, I’m not sure what you are trying to tell me here. Are you saying you don’t like what we do? I mean, you are…”
Dean leaned against him, one hand fisting his pyjamas. For most of their lives, the roles had been reversed, but Dean could remember a few nights like this when it had been his little brother who had consoled him and not the other way around. The first time Dean had been maybe ten and had been sure John had left because he had thrown a childish tantrum about something and that he was going to die on the hunt because he had been a bad son. Little Sammy had spent the night holding him and repeating that every parent would have wanted a son like him. Dean had thought that maybe every parent would have wanted him, but surely not their father, but had said nothing to Sammy.
"They don't, he does. Like the best dessert ever, eaten on a sunny Sunday. With a hint of gun oil and a note of Impala," Dean bit to the tease, getting a laugh out of Sam.
The angel straddled him again, but this time facing away from him, giving Dean a great view of the infinite expanse of his back. He reached up, fingers tracing his shoulder blades almost reverently. With some effort and whatever mojo he needed, Castiel could have manifested his wings even while inside his vessel, he never had though, too scared to lose control, to hurt Dean, but Dean couldn’t help but wonder how it would feel for them both, how it would be to touch an angel’s feathers, how much of an intimate touch it would be for Castiel.
He had all the rights to be smug because all Castiel could think about was the wet and warm touch, how easy it would be to push back and have exactly what Dean proposed. His balls were tight, his cock leaking, all of his body was begging for release. But no, he had a plan. With a conscious effort he moved away, grunting when he found out that yes, he could feel Dean’s nipple against his cock, a pang of excitement running up his spine like lightning at the idea.
"Sorry, I'm drifting away from what I meant to say," Castiel corrected himself, hands firmly planted on Dean's chest, and Dean raised an eyebrow to that, "Dean, what I am saying is that I'm grateful for what we do, but I know about the porn and I know about sex and…"
Dean sighed against Castiel's lips, something deep, far deeper than a moan, deeper than simple pleasure. It wasn't about the angel's body pressed against him, naked and sweaty and incredibly arousing, that was good, great sure, but Dean's release of breath was because of something different, it was about the Angel himself, about their bond. Dean could almost physically feel it in moments like that, it was like his scar was burning like it wasn't just his body trying to get closer and closer to Cas, to get under his skin, to lose himself into the Angel. It was more. It felt like their souls fitted more than their bodies like Dean's wasn't whole if not in such moments of sheer intimacy.
Castiel didn’t look up, he couldn’t do that, he wasn’t ready, he knew it was going too close to losing his mind.
"Cas, I've shared a lot with a lot of people and I swear I've never wanted to kiss Eileen or to tear the clothes off Jody," Dean explained with a smirk and Castiel's lips slowly widened into a smile.
Anger, frustration, pain, but also love and loss in that inhuman yell resonating through the nothingness surrounding him.
"Yeah: oh," Dean repeated, "I mean, it wasn't like...and I didn't… but…" his loquacity suddenly gone too, cheeks cherry red, "damn it, Cas. I didn't know I did, until it was too late, but I love you, I've loved you for far longer than I can pinpoint," he got out in a single breath. He was shaking, but the hand on his shoulder was too, so it was ok.
“Do you think that’s why I saved him, why I confessed to him? To hear him say it back?” Castiel laughed, and the Entity just shrugged.
He gently palmed the angel's face, mirroring his pose, feeling the warmth, the weight of Castiel leaning against it and pressing against the caress. Dean moved slowly, getting closer and closer, watching the plump pink lips he was about to kiss but also giving Castiel time to change his mind.
There wasn’t a way out, there had never been. He had been released from there once, and it had costed the lives of some of his brothers, not to mention the power of Lucifer’s son, but this time it was different. This time he was there by choice, he was there because of a deal because the Entity ruling that place wanted him, not because he had just died. They were all things that pointed toward never getting out. He had known that, when he had closed the deal when he had told those three words to Dean to save him, and he didn’t regret any of that, still now it felt a lot worse than he had imagined, a lot scarier. Darker. Hopeless.
In silence the creature took a few steps forward and grabbed his chin, forcing Castiel to look in its eyes.
"NO!" Castiel could feel his power flash, his eyes turning into a blue light, "don't say a single word unless it's your admission!"
"Dean?" Sam whispered touching his back lightly, "we should go," his voice was uncertain like he felt bad at having to ask to break the hug, but Dean got it. It wasn't the best idea to stay there, they had no idea if Castiel's return from the dead had given signs if demons or who knew who was on them. They had Jack and everyone knew and wanted him.
The Entity laughed, but it had nothing to do with Dean’s laughter, not even his sarcastic, cruel one, and that gave Cas a second to take back control over his thoughts. He had no idea how much of them the Empty could read, but he wasn’t going to show his desperation.
"No," he said in a normal tone and then turned, "No, Dean, you know what? I won't leave and I won't feel guilty because you're emotionally constipated," he continued in a hard tone, fists now so tight his fingernails started to indent the skin.
“When I ask you something, you answer, clear?” the human form asked, twisting his hand more until Castiel desperately nodded, and just then it let go.
"That's...that's not it, Castiel. Is that once more I couldn't say goodbye, I was sure I lost you for good and I had and it was terrible because you went happy to just love me but firm in the knowledge that it was the one thing you couldn't have."
“You think? Sure, Cas,” the voice was now closer, but too sweet, honey-coated. Castiel closed his eyes and nodded, lips in a tight line.
"I'm sorry about Mary," Castiel broke the relaxed silence while sitting on the bed near Dean. He nodded his thanks and Castiel continued, "Lucifer may have a use for her, and if there's someone who can survive in that place is Mary."
“For a moment I was seriously scared he was too far gone for even me being able to reach for him again,” Sam admitted with a pained sigh. He dropped the jacket on a chair, moving to the free bed, “so, I guess you know now you’ll have to stay or you’ll break him for good,” it was a statement, but Cass knew it also was the biggest threat he had ever got.
“Yes, Dean, I know my warrior side pretty well, it’s what I’ve been for millennia,” he answered all serious, missing the rhetoric part of the question and Dean felt his heart swell with love even more.
"Stop saying his name! You knew better than me what he was, you saw it, but you led him to believe you considered him a son!"
“Back to wetting it is,” Castiel murmured to himself. He kissed from base to tip, sucking the shaft slightly between his lips, he licked away a few drops of precome, teasing the slit with the tip of his tongue, before following the same path down once again, shuddering at every moan that left Dean mouth, and that vibrated and resonated through him. Castiel focused, more than he had in any mission in the last few centuries, wetting every inch of the cock, moving it around, the body under his trembling and sweating, but Dean seemed laser-focused too on his mission of fucking Castiel with his tongue, probably trying to make him lose his mind.
Castiel let go, let his head fall backwards on Dean’s shoulder, the little breath he still had left him in a rush when the deft mouth started teasing his exposed neck, his bared pulse point.
“I can…” he offered, gesturing toward Dean’s spread legs, but as always Dean shook his head no. He was still half naked, still panting hard, but his jaw was tight again, the slackness of pleasure already gone
“I want you to come, Cas, I want to feel you impossible tight around my cock,” Dean said between ragged panting, and Castiel reached back, fingers sliding into messy hair.
"I love you too, Dean," the angel was quick to say back and Dean knew he could leave it like that, he probably should, he shouldn't have said it in the first place, but now he couldn't take it back, the words felt like fire in his throat and he needed to spit it out.
"I miss him terribly too. Without him feels like just half a win," Sam nodded again, "but I was waiting for you to get there, at this point it's something between the two of you before being a family thing," he affectionately bumps their shoulders together, still smiling, "didn't know Angels have a scent," Sam teased.
“You sure? I’d love to see you come around my tongue while I taste you,” Castiel could hear Dean smirk, didn’t even need to see him to know the smug expression that was on his face.
"Not my fault you get all philosophical on me while all I want is to feel you in every possible way!" Dean protested, hands stopping at the small of the angel's back.
“I never thought a fuck could have changed that. Goodbye Dean,” Castiel said, turning toward the stairs. He felt like he couldn’t breathe, even if he didn’t need to like his body was suddenly too heavy to drag around. He wanted to go back to be only an Angel, only Grace with an Ethereal form. He wanted to forget what real, free love meant. He wanted not to know pain.
“It’s been amazing,” Castiel's voice was light, distant, a little daydreaming, his body still thrumming with pleasure, pulsing with the aftershocks, acutely aware of the soft cock still inside his body. He loved it, he’d have kept Dean like that forever.
“Like the show, Dean?” he groaned. He reached out, grabbing his cheek, spreading himself even more, even if everything was already visible, “I can feel you leak inside me,” he continued, “can you see how hungry my ass is for you?”
“Maybe I expanded, maybe I finally swallowed everything your Father stole from me!” it still was a teasing tone, but Castiel could detect anger too. It was well hidden and subtle, but it was there, it was a weak point and he could maybe use that.
"Cass, I've met my share of angels, and demons and whatever else and you are the most selfless creature I've ever met. Everything you did, even the most messed up things, you did to help, to be better. And maybe to redeem yourself, but always through good, through what you thought was the best thing," Castiel scoffed.
“That’s my show, my wetting, Dean,” Castiel growled, low and threatening, a sound Dean had only heard from him around Demons or Angels with very different plans from his. Damn if that didn’t make his cock leak.
“Sure, you know now, but what in a century or two? But it’s true love, let's say a few millennia, instead. You’ll be out of your mind, your small Grace rotten with desperation and pain, and then you won’t know I’m not him, you’ll only remember you gave everything for Dean, for something stupid you call love, but the only thing you’ll know will be that he’s torturing you. How does it sound?”
“I don’t understand the problem,” he said, genuinely at a loss and Dean shook his head in awe. What did he do to be so lucky? Because he was pretty sure he had done nothing particularly good in his life, not that he knew of, at least, and still he had that incredible creature laying over him, smiling and sated, an Angel straight out of Heaven apparently devoted only to make him feel happy and alive.
For a moment Castiel’s mind blanked out. It couldn’t be true. He knew now that God wasn’t the benevolent, wise Father he had blindly followed for aeons, he knew he was selfish and spoiled and often cruel, but that seemed like too much. To condemn his angels, his children, like that, just to treat himself with creations to play with. Stories to write, humans created just to use them like in a bad novel, and then wiped out to start anew, in exchange for the eternal suffering of him and his brothers.
It took little before Dean came with a suffocated whine, biting into his partner’s clothed shoulder, short fingernails sinking on the back of Castiel’s hands, and it was enough to push him over the edge as well. Castiel came without even stopping to move, short, angry thrusts to milk his orgasm to the last drop. He then stayed still for a moment, distractedly feeling Dean’s leg slid down his hip, but too busy smelling, for the last time, the scent of the two of them together, the sweat on Dean’s skin that he wasn’t going to lick away, not this time. When he was ready, when even a second more was going to be too much, he took a step back, not even looking at Dean while he slid down the wall to sit on the floor with a flinch. Instead, Castiel tucked himself in, cleaning his soiled shirt with a distracted gesture before he zipped up his pants.
Dean’s teasing attitude dissolves as he reads. By the last line, his ears are flushed crimson and his mouth is silently gaping. Castiel responds with a warm chuckle that flusters him so much he almost knocks the drink over with his elbow.
Castiel eases down next to him on the mattress, placing a warm hand over Dean’s heart. Smiling affectionately, he chuckles. “Yeah… wow.”
“I thought you weren’t gonna be here for another hour or two. I’m not taking my break until later,” Dean says with a hint of disappointment as he sorts postcards by design.
Sure, Castiel may have told himself that Monday through Friday every week for the past two months, but today is going to be different. He could feel it.
A shimmer of excitement stirs in Dean’s chest as he raises a prompting eyebrow. Half the time Cas says something like that, he ends up teaching him how to play mini golf or something like that, but the other half…
Castiel leans in and murmurs in Dean’s ear as he gently brushes his fingertips along the underside of his thickening cock. “I’ve only taken you with my vessel, Dean. It is a crude approximation of how much desire I feel for you.” He wraps his warm palm around its girth and starts stroking, teasingly slowly. “You deserve all of me. Every drop, every inch. I won’t force it upon you; I know it can be… overwhelming. But if you want everything, all you need to do is lay down on that bed and it’s yours.”
Dean subconsciously wets his lips as he catches Cas’s electric blue eyes with his own. Castiel’s carefully calculated monotone rarely betrays his desire, but his eyes blaze with hunger. Dean’s body immediately responds and it’s all he can do to not crash into Castiel, grinding against his hips like a storm. Instead, he cups Cas’s stubbled jaw and trails teasing kisses down the side of his neck. Nipping playfully, he asks, “Would you like to try that again?” He’s rewarded with a small moan when he bites down harder, but Castiel quickly steps back.
"Angels, always leaving the dirty work to me," Dean smiled and closed the distance, pressing his lips to Castiel.
"I loved you," Dean said with a solemn nod, staring into the eyes that were back to their normal blue, "but we messed up and my mother is dead," he added.
"What do you need, Dean?" Castiel asked, voice even lower than usual while his lips brushed against Dean's chin. He bit on it while waiting for the answer, this time eliciting a sensual moan.
“Lube?” he asked without turning, knowing that seeing Dean at that moment would have been his demise.
“Right. I’d love to see that part in bed with me, next time,” Dean asked, moving his eyebrow in an explicit suggestive way, and Castiel smiled, a little dirty. He could maybe miss the meaning of some references or take things too literally, but that hint he definitely got.
Dean moaned behind him. He tightened the hold on Castiel, started to help him move, feeling the angel’s legs tremble against him. Probably for the effort, more likely for the arousal, all his body tense and blushed. He was close too, the sight of Castiel riding him like that, of his hips undulating and moving around his cock, the constant stream of precome dripping from Castiel’s cock over his balls, too much to get his body to behave. He spanked him once more, scratching the pink mark, losing himself in the broken moan that came from the angel.
"You know I did! You know I loved you, I loved Jack, but that doesn't mean," Dean's voice was suddenly low, shaking. A scared whisper.
Suddenly it was Castiel’s turn to control his body, when Dean roughly grabbed his hips and pulled him back until Castiel was almost sitting on his face and, with no warning, he went straight to suck on the hole. It felt good, far from the first time Dean did that to him, but the most intense, the dirtiest, maybe, and the angel was starting to get why humans were fixated with the worst kinds of debaucheries. Castiel could already feel his balls heavy, his cock dripping. He looked down, to see a few drops slipping over Dean’s chest, one stopping on a nipple and he had to use all his control not to do anything, not to push back or even down to hump that chest. For a second he wondered if he could have felt the pebbled nipple against his cock, catch against his head, but he forced the thought away, for later maybe, to focus on his plan. Dirtiness. Debauchery. He’d have already been that if it wasn’t for Dean and his distractions. He bit his hip again, but the gesture turned against him when Dean moaned, tongue deep in his ass.
“I’m the one supposed to show,” Castiel growled a moment later, letting the cock slip from his lips and pressing his cheek against Dean’s hipbone. The skin was hot and slightly sweating, the smell of sex already heavy in his nose.
He was in front of the two story house he had claimed for himself because that apparently was how things went into new Heaven, you just had to ask and then claim. Sam lived very close by, like maybe twenty steps away close by, back with Eileen, and Dean had to admit it was almost good to live alone after a lifetime of shared motels rooms. Not that he could really appreciate it, to be honest, he's been in Heaven just for a few days, not counting the time waiting for his brother, and most of them he had spent hugging all the people he had lost too soon in life. The remaining time he had called and prayed to Castiel, also yelling to him some colourful insults after a few beers, to be honest. Another great thing Jack and Cas didn't forego: you could get drunk in Heaven too if you wanted to, or drink whatever and stay sober. Dean was definitely on the side of getting drunk, he wasn't ready to think about everything that went on in the last years of his life.
“Oh, the poor kid had no idea!” the entity teased with a maniacal laugh. It shoved him slightly, his shoulders almost popped out of place, but Castiel was even unable to feel pain at that moment, “Your Father created you just to have something to play with, sold you and left you when he found something more interesting to play with. It took you so long to realize, you brave, faithful soldier. Luckily Dean Winchester came along to save you from your blindness, it’s a pity he did with you exactly what your father had.”
"No, Cass. I mean I love you. Not like everyone else, I love you like…. Like I need you, I love you as a lot more than the Angel on my shoulder than my best friend," he was shaking, he could feel his hands cold and sweaty in his lap, restless, like they had a need of their own to grab Castiel by his stupid trench coat and pull him in.
“You want to kill me,” Dean’s voice came out breathy, words spoken between his teeth, but now his eyes were glued to Castiel’s body. His thighs were slightly trembling with the effort of maintaining the position for so long, the back a tense line of muscles, still everything disappeared in front of the ass swallowing just a little of his cock, too dry and hot around his head.
Dean gripped the hips tighter while biting down on his lip. That was something he didn’t expect. He had known Angels for years, they made all kinds of heinous things, but that seemed too dirty for one of them anyway.
He was shaking so much that even to open his eyes felt like too much, but he slowly did. Around him just black. No shadow, no dark, those had a form, an existence, there, instead, there was just a black nothing. But that voice behind him was there, he knew he wasn’t hallucinating, he knew it was what had woken him from his tortured blackout.
Dean took a moment to calm himself down, to convince his body that, even if his cock was in the angel’s throat and the tongue was doing things to him he wasn’t sure a mere mortal could do, there was no way he could come yet. Oh, no, if that was just the beginning he was definitely going to wait for the end. If he was to make it alive, at least.
“I’m sure you’ll like this one,” Castiel assured and Dean wondered when and where Castiel picked up such a dirty smirk. Not that there was a lot of innocence left in his angel, but that smirk was a new level of dirtiness, something he was sure Castiel didn’t even learn from him. He definitely had to be more careful about the porn he left around unless he wanted….
“Like that, baby, yes,” Dean hissed, forehead pressed against Castiel’s temple. He quickened the strokes, jerking him through his orgasm, drinking in the sight of the angel coming undone under his touch. His body seemed to have waited just for Castiel to go limp and relaxed in his embrace, though, because the moment it happened, it started to scream in need, all the arousal raining down on Dean in a moment, too much to contain. He grabbed Castiel tighter around his chest, now moving him like a ragdoll, movements hard in his unbridled need, broken whimpers the only sounds escaping the angel, and a few strokes later Dean came undone, pleasure so big and forceful he felt like his body was bursting at the seams before he exploded, fingernails scratching Castiel’s chest in the throw of pleasure, pressing the angel against himself, holding, taking.
“Tsk, tsk… let’s not bring my Father into this,” Cas chastises. He slides that thread of grace down between Dean’s spread asscheeks and presses it against his entrance. “Ah, but you’re so greedy.” Sending tingling pulses in time with the lazy pumping of his grace around Dean’s cock, he purrs, “Is this what you want?” Dean grunts and tries to grind against it, angling his hips down towards the mattress.
Cas’s eyes widen in surprise and he rocks back and forth on the balls of his feet. He’s disproportionately excited that Dean bothered to remember his guilty pleasure. “You… you really don’t have to. I don’t want you to get in trouble.”
Neither does Castiel’s frown. He’s distracted for the rest of the day, ruminating over the encounter. He had gotten so close, despite his mishap, but the words just refused to come out. There’s something about being face-to-face with Dean that just unravels all his plans. Fear clenches his jaw shut every time or sends him careening in some random direction trying to fill the silence. It doesn’t matter if he practices the conversation in the shower until the damn water runs cold, it always goes sideways on him.
“Ohhhh?” Gabe sidles up on the stool next to him, peeking over at the creased paper. Popping his gum in Cas's ear, he rests his chin on his little brother's shoulder and chuckles with awareness. It’s a LOVE letter and knowing Cas, it has to be ridiculously entertaining. "Soooooo... I'm guessing today was not the day then?"
Castiel flushes crimson, his eyes wide and mouth gaping. "I... I... well it was only a first draft and..."
“Dean, I don’t understand. You told me I needed to learn to knock. I have been knocking and you grow more agitated each time. I thought, perhaps in the car, I had not knocked loud enough as you were… preoccupied. But I know you heard me this time and still… What did I do wrong, Dean?” Exasperation radiated off of him and his eyes bore into Dean’s, steely and probing.
Castiel pulls Dean close and kisses him possessively. Taken by surprise, Dean grasps the back of his neck to steady himself as Castiel sucks on his bottom lip. He can’t remember the last time Castiel grabbed him with such dominating need. It makes his knees weaken. Castiel’s grip tightens as their tongues frantically rasp against each other. Deep and penetrating, the kiss leaves him shaken when Castiel lets him gasp for air. Backing him into the wall, Cas roughly palms Dean’s erection through his jeans. His cock presses firmly against Dean’s hip, thrusting slowly and promising more.
It’s all still so new. Although Dean’s the first to say he doesn’t deserve it, he’s giddy with potential. After all these years, after going through so much together… every time Cas flashes him that brilliant smile, his stomach flutters. He may not deserve it, but they both fought for it, and they’re sure as hell going to keep it. He trails his eyes admiringly down the length of Castiel’s body, savoring how openly he can appreciate it now.
Dean flashes a brilliant grin. “Well, hello then. You sure know how to make an entrance.” He winks at the rosy flush creeping up all the way to Cas’s ears. After a few moments, Castiel realizes that they’ve just been staring at each other again. Clearing his throat, he rushes to fill the silence.
Castiel doesn’t see Dean immediately the next morning, but he lights up when he spots Dorothy at the customer service desk. “Hey, you’re back from the dig! Tell me all about Peru,” he exclaims with friendly grin.
“What can I say? I’m a man of many talents!” Dean jokingly brags while flipping a can of whipped cream in the air. “White chocolate mocha with extra whip, right?” He asks as he grabs a large to-go cup. “It’s on the house.”
The problem was, that made him intensely nervous. A casual wink at the end of a joke once made Castiel’s hand shake so much he spilled coffee all over himself. His words came out either stammering or rambling; there was little in between. It wasn’t even because he believed Dean was entirely disinterested. As he had explained to his brother, there was a pretty reasonable chance the attraction was mutual. Cas wasn’t blind to the way Dean stole sideways glances when he thought he wasn’t looking or how his tongue darted out to lick his lower lip when they made eye contact. But interest and willingness were two very different things and he was afraid of destroying their fledgling friendship. Castiel wanted to find the courage to say something but, every time he tried to work himself up to it, he backpedaled or embarrassed himself with anxious clumsiness.
“Oh, fuck!” Dean cries out and thrusts his hips up sharply. He twists and drags against the restraints, flexing his hands. “Fuck, why can’t I touch you?” Castiel continues tormenting his nipples as droplets of his grace ghost all over Dean’s body. Dean shudders from overstimulation.
“I mean, if you don’t want to, it’s cool. I thought maybe…” Dean trails off and starts to turn away to hide his disappointment.
Cas massages Dean’s entrance gently with his grace, sending sporadic sparks to tingle deep inside him as he loosens. Dean moans encouragingly around Castiel’s cock as he delivers a strong current, delving deep towards his prostate. He spasms in pleasure once Cas finds the right spot, surging more power into it. Unable to speak, Dean squirms for more, sucking harder for emphasis. Castiel widens the flow of grace and he shakes with pleasure.
Bal nodded, grabbing his bag too quickly, laying a swift peck on Cas cheek. “See you later, Castiel.” With that the alpha was skedaddling past Cas and Dean with his head lowered- eyes to the ground as a sign of submission.
Dean threw his head back and barked a laugh- he couldn’t help but chuckle at the alphas contagious humor. Dean smiled at him with so much softness, “Do not worry omega. Though, I have sex with your sister, it is you that holds my heart”.
That night, when his parents had told him the news of the arranged mating, he did not get any sleep, instead he wept and soaked his pillows with his salty tears. It was so sudden and tomorrow he would meet the young alpha and be taken away to Winchester Pack lands.
Bobby Singer, a good friend to John, surrogate father to Dean and Sam  and a member of the High Wolf Council, added with seriousness, “Yes Chuck! Expect a visit from us soon!”
Again, Dean surprised him. This time they headed for a farmers festival that was happening- just an hour outside of Lawrence. It was like a carnival, with joyrides, booths and food trailers everywhere. The smells of popcorn, pastries and grilled food wafted through the air. The sounds of farm animals in their little man made pens filled the air.
He licked his lips and shyly uttered, “Because, Cas is doing something to me, mom. It’s like, my alpha wants him.”
The alpha wiggled his nose and sneezed. Yeah, he couldn’t help it, rolling around, laughing hard (legs and belly up in the air, before, returning to his seated belly flat position) smirking at the now grinning alpha (from a meter apart). The alpha didn’t move, just laid its great head on its big paws and studied him with adoring green eyes. He could feel his cheeks heat up; if he was human, he would be relatable to a tomato.
He was to be offered as a peace offering to the forest wolves. It terrified and upset him to know that this was the future that awaited him. Eventually, he had to disappear into the forests, never to see nor hear from his loved ones again. All in the name of stability and peace making. As the years went by, he began to slowly accept his fate- though it still shook him. And every time he would look at his younger siblings- Gabe and Samandriel- he would gain more courage and tell himself that he was trying to protect them. Big brothers always protected their younger brothers.
Dean could only roll his eyes at his cousin and boyfriend’s petulance. He pinched the bridge of his nose, “Guys, we have more pressing matters at hand. My dad would have sent his best scouts and they're
. It was too rough for that, as Dean proceeded to thrust into a loud moaning Anna who could only hold onto the alpha for the ride of her life.
Of course he’s still smells like Dean. And, that’s why he always kept an extra change of clothes in his car- just so he can slip it on before entering the stone- like Novak mansion in the outskirts of Lawrence City.
He wasn’t no disrespectful brute. He wasn’t oblivious to the fact that this sudden arranged mating wouldn’t be hard for his intended omega too. This mating needed to happen.
He glanced around seeing the omega feel not very at ease when his father, Mr. Novak, stepped closer to the wolf. Hmm, something wasn’t right. He spared one last glance at Sammy, who was chatting and smiling goofily at his blonde omega mate and decided that his baby brother would be ok if he briefly took his omega away from this tense atmosphere.
Lucian and his kind had been in chains all their lives; in spiked collars; in rags; lived in dirty stone cages- everything under the feel of a barbed whip against their skin.
He only ever skyped with Cas while inside his dorm room. His eyes lit up in sudden realization, “You mean Charlie?”
. Yes, because Gabe new about the ridicule he received from everyone because of the fact that he was
And he couldn’t refuse. He just couldn’t! So, he answered what his wolf and heart wanted. “Yes, Dean.” His voice had been the quietest he had ever heard, but, there was excitement underneath.
Both Dean and Castiel were stunned at first. Then, Dean felt fire begin to creep into him. How dare she! He instinctively stepped in front of his husband as if to shield him from Anna’s wicked eyes. He clenched his fists barking out, “Anna, I gave you an order! AND you better mind your tongue. I already warned you earlier”.
He sighed, rubbing a hand down his face, “Jesus, Cas! Lisa and I used to kiss out in the open, in the gardens outside mostly, but,
And just like that, everything faded into darkness. Next he was gasping and opening his eyes. He groaned as the light suddenly entered his pupils- pinching his eyelids shut in uncomfortableness. He couldn’t help but hear the rumble of a car engine and feel its vibrations travel through his body.
Momma and daddy were oblivious to him as he carefully made his way towards his parents. He picked up on how momma whispered frantically to daddy, “Talk to him, John. Explain to him how he needs to relieve himself with these items. It’s his first rut, so it’s going to be quite overwhelming.”
too? Hmm!” Again, Dean’s posture tensed and he saw the alphas grip on his beer bottle flex and tighten.
Both the boys did as their father requested- looking both highly nervous, shy and afraid. John only shot the boys a soft fatherly smile, full of warmth, protection and pride. The alpha said something that made the boys eyes widen slightly. Those words were, “its ok.”
Mary could see that the boys needed time to process this information. She also could read that her oldest was probably one that would take more time trying to figure things out and come to terms with what was being revealed here today. Dean would probably be the one that breaks Castiel’s heart in the future trying to accept this bond and till then, they had to walk this road alone. This was their bond and they needed to fight for it.
“Son, there's no choice. I can only delay your mating to Anna for the year, but until then, she has to live under your roof, while you and your omega try to conceive".
furs (as if wanting to be covered in his alpha scent). His wolf continued to drink water, purring at the omegas caresses.
He pulled his head slightly back, just enough to capture Cas starry blue eyes. He smiled warmly, thumbing at the man’s left cheek, “Cas, I am honored to be the one to give you your first kiss. And, I thought it was so perfect too.”
. But, the thought of parting from Dean, just left him feeling hollow inside. He would have given anything, just to stay by Dean’s side- playing pool, kicking Charlie’s ass in the process, and laughing away. And, maybe getting more lessons or tips on how to play pool-
to say I’m sorry.” There was a pause, before the alpha added, “At dinner, a week and a half ago, I shouldn’t have said those…insensitive words.....to you.” He felt his heart skip as Dean laid a hand atop his, squeezing lightly, looking sorrowful as he continued, “You are NOT needy, whiny and suffocating, Cas. YOU are an amazing omega with a heart of gold. And,
Oh wait till he gets his hands on his alpha- he was going to hear a damn earful- and he better pray that that’s all he gets from him!
pretending to skim through his contract once again. He knew he was being a jackass, but, he just wouldn’t go down any path that screamed
“Cas’s boyfriend. Yes, I have dad.” His heart was beating hard, as Dean turned to glance at him with a small smile (again one that didn’t reach the alphas eyes). “He seems like a good alpha. Definitely puts a smile on Cas face and that’s all the approval he needs from me.”
He comments in a purring like tone of affection, “Just the way I left you sweetness”. He was so lost in taking in his car that he didn’t notice the figure that stepped out of the shadows of a nearby tree.
Castiel held in his gasp. His heart aching harder- if that were possible. In this instant he knew that he wanted to make it his life’s mission to keep this traumatized, broken omega, happy and continuously smiling. So, without much thought, he promised, “I will not let anyone harm you, Dean. You are mine and as my omega, I will respect all that you do. I will respect your choices. I will keep you by my side and make you my prince, so to speak”. He was surprised at the determination and emotion in his own voice. No one would dispute his decision back at home, if he has chosen an omega slave to be his mate. After all, that’s what a few of his relatives have done over the past century, if they found an omega appealed to them.
"Dean, what you showed me about sex is amazing, everything we did, you'd say it blew my mind," he pressed the finger a little harder to stop the joke he could already read on Dean's lips, "but I know there's a lot more we didn't try yet and I know a lot of it is about doing what we already do but a lot dirtier,” he explained, hoping his words made sense to the hunter, but he wasn’t so lucky, because Dean frowned, unhappy, before grabbing his wrist to move the finger away from his lips, every other touch just gone.
“Thinking of it, you’re wet enough,” Castiel said, his voice focused like Dean had only heard it during difficult hunts, but before he could grasp what was happening, the angel grabbed his cock and moved to sit over it. Just the very tip, still facing away, hand tight at the base.
Dean tensed for a moment at the touch. Years of wanting, of pining, were ending right that second with that simple press of lips on lips. Warm and chapped lips suddenly erasing all the pain, all the sorrow that for so long had pushed him on his knees. But then they were just lips. Castiel’s lips. His taste, his scent, his touch, everything Dean had craved for long before admitting it.
He grabbed Dean’s wrists, pinning them over his head in a punishing grip, relishing in the feeling of the blood running fast under the delicate skin.
“Yeah, I got that you liked the show and tell game,” Cas agreed with a smile far smugger than Dean had seen on his lips since...probably since forever. Laughing he pulled up a little to kiss it off Castiel’s mouth, a slow, lingering kiss that ended when the angel let himself fall half near, half over Dean.
“Think about your words, Dean,” he commanded, “there’s a limit we don’t want to cross. I know you can only spit hate and rage when you’re hurt, but you’re not the only creature in this world and you’re not the only one hurting,” Castiel’s eyes closed into two slits, waiting but menacing.
“More?” Dean asked and who was Castiel to resist the puppy eyes Dean was giving him? He could have found the force to rebel to Heaven, but he was sure he could have never been strong enough to ignore that stare.
"Cas…" Dean's voice was weak, broken. He was in pain and breaking down and Castiel felt a sadistic sense of justice in that.
“I’m sorry, Cas, I left marks,” fingers traced the four lines running down the angel’s chest, then moving to gently caress the marks left on the neck, but Castiel looked at him confused.
"I've been calling you for days," Dean started to protest, "to be honest I half hoped to find you here when I arrived," he added, feeling warmth running to his cheeks.
Castiel couldn’t even think for a second, he just grabbed Dean by his clothes, pulled him in and then shoved him back against the wall, so hard the bricks cracked, smiling evilly at the grunt of pain he got as a result.
"I am trying to do a serious speech here, Dean," Castiel scolded, but he was smiling. He felt like around Dean he couldn't stop smiling. Well, unless they were fighting with each other or against something that wanted to kill them, which was most of the time, unfortunately.
"It's okay, you told me, we are here now," Dean reassured once more, one arm snaking around his chest to pull their bodies flushed together, "so, how does this place work, am I going to be kicked down to Hell if I defile an Angel of the new Lord?"
"We’ll bring him back, I promise nothing will stop me from seeing you happy after everything we went through," Sam whispered while arranging his too long limbs to fit on the small bed.
Dean said nothing, opened his mouth, but no sound came out. Good, because Castiel felt anger and desperation almost tickle at his Grace, he felt a surge of power led by fury.
"Dean? What?" Cass asked, and Dean could imagine his confused frown, could almost feel it through his clothes.
"We all messed up with Jack! Me, Sam, you. We all added to get him to that rupture point and maybe I knew about the snake, but I'm done with your ignoring things that you don’t like. You knew too, after Donatello, actually, you brought him there because you already knew, but you were desperate to hear that it wasn't true, that Jack still had a soul," Castiel kept getting closer to the hunter, stopping in front of him, until Dean stopped slouching against the table and instead stood tall and obviously furious, but the angel didn't care. For more than a decade he had kept up with Dean’s mood swings, with his total incapacity at dealing with feelings like a normal, living creature. Now it was his turn to get angry. To be done.
“No need to ask,” Castiel only said before starting a punishing pace. He reached Dean’s hand once more, their hands sliding against each other like their bodies were doing, Castiel’s face hidden against Dean’s throat.
“Calm down,” Castiel said, one hand on Dean’s chest to push himself up, “that’s not how I planned to end the night.”
“I fucking love you,” Dean murmured with his remaining breath, panting for a few seconds before he could attack those luscious lips again, his tongue caressing them, slipping just inside, between them, before going back to trace them again.
A swift smack to Castiel’s exposed ass. The sound seemed to reverberate through the room, almost covering the grunt of the angel.
"You can't tell me to go," he could feel his Grace, restless inside that too tight human body, he could feel his power kick and scream to come out, to instinctively smite their enemy, "look me in the eyes and tell me you ever loved us or have the balls to admit I've been nothing more than an upgraded one night stand"
“You’re not the only one who lost someone,” Castiel reminded him, starting to climb the stairs. It felt like a real goodbye, and yet he knew, they both knew, it probably wasn’t. not with their lives, not with what they were. Still, it was a goodbye to the two of them, to what they were even a few days before.
Castiel had died a few times already, but now was different, now Dean missed him so much he couldn't breathe, everything seemed to bring along a memory of the Angel. Of them together. The three of them, having a home, raising a kid. Being a family. Now they had been too close to be happy. Funny that the happiness they had missed their whole lives was exactly what killed Castiel.
"I do," Dean confirmed with a nod, "probably for a long time. I never thought about it before, but you've been different from anyone else for years now."
"Cass, can I have you now? Like for real, can you stop running and hiding and fighting and just be mine?" Dean asked in a rush, eyes down, still busy to look at his hands. His heart was beating so hard and fast it almost hurt in his chest and it felt like something was constricting his lungs, keeping him from breathing. Odd, he had had all kinds of creatures do that to him in the past, squishing his internal organs, and yet it had never felt so unbearable.
Dean took a deep breath through his nose. Self control. He was sure he had it, at least at some point in his life, because it seemed to be lacking at the moment. It was the dirtiest thing anyone ever showed him, the angel made a point of moving on and around his cock, of having his hole fluttering and opening in a sensual performance, spreading himself even more while rotating his hips, arching his back to hide nothing, and it was a thousand times better than feeling only because he could see when he clenched down on purpose, to slid tighter along the pulsating vein, to not let the cock slid out of him. He could see spit and precum run along his shaft, out of the angel.
Dean stared at him for a moment, wondering if heaven shouldn't be devoid of awkward moments like this, but then he shook his head. "No. No. I do have to, you deserve to hear me say...thank you," Dean inhaled, "Thank you Cas."
Dean nodded, then his brow knit together, "But that still doesn't answer my question, if these aren't memories then what is this place..." his voice trailing off at the end. Dean looked around the barn, doing the calculus in his head. Castiel just waited, head tilted slightly to the left, watching Dean with interest. "Is this...your place? Is this where you stay?"
“Heya, Cas,” Dean said smoothly as he righted himself. He moved his hand from Cas’s arm to his neck, stroking his stubbled jaw with his thumb.
“Sam just wanted me to review some of the bunker’s files,” Castiel began without moving to face at Dean. “I’m not sure I can be of any help,” he said flatly. It was a struggle to keep his hands planted on the table when all he wanted was to look at Dean. He waited for a moment, hoping that somehow, Dean would say something that made staying possible.
The angel huffed out a laugh, tears falling freely from his eyes. Dean reached up and put a firm, warm hand on Castiel's cheek. He leaned into the touch and sighed. Dean pulled their faces together until their foreheads were touching. They stood there for a few long moments just breathing.
Dean who had been following behind the angel stopped, starring almost blankly at Castiel's back. Cas looked over his shoulder. When he saw the look on Dean's face, he turned holding the sleeve for Led Zepplin II.
“Can it, Sammy. I’m a healthy man with healthy appetites,” Dean retorted, leaning back in his chair, crossing his arms. He looked up at Cas who was staring at him with wide eyes. The two held eye contact for what felt like ages, and Cas was certain that there was understanding in Dean’s face. But suddenly, he coughed, looked away, “I thought we were over this. You’ve gotta stop looking at me like that, Cas. It’s freaking creepy.”
Castiel dropped into the bunker some time after noon. Sam was seated at a table, open books scattered around his laptop, his fingers tapping rapidly against the keys. “Good morning, Sam,” Cas said flatly, his eyes flitting around the room looking for the elder Winchester.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel responded tightly and inched back a fraction. He was already feeling guilty about the encounter. If Dean realized that Cas was being cold, it did not deter him. He pressed Castiel backward until he was against the wall and began kissing down Cas’s neck, murmuring amorous greetings.
Sam picked up his laptop, and looked down at his brother with disdain, “I’m going to pack up. We can leave in 20.” He started out of the room, and without looking at Dean, he added, “You are SUCH an asshole.”
When he opened his eyes, Dean was standing right in front of him. He growled and grabbed Cas by his hips, pulling him flush with his body. “You’re already hard, babe. Don’t lie to me,” Dean whispered as he rolled his hips.
“I was afraid you weren’t going to come, darlin’,” Dean whispered with a nip to the angel’s earlobe.
Cas walked past Dean, barely an arms length away, but he did not pause. "I have your favorite whiskey, and I know you prefer cassettes to records, but I have to say that Zepplin is really wonderful on vinyl."
Castiel opened his mouth to respond when Dean entered the room, freshly showered, but moving stiffly with dark bags under his eyes. “We can hit the road as long as you guys promise to whisper,” he croaked, voice rough and tired. He dropped into a chair and squeezed the bridge of his nose.
"Oh hell yes," Dean exclaimed. Really perfect. Subtly, under that feeling, came a tug in his gut. Something was still missing.
“Stop it,” Cas said, with no force and only longing in his voice. It would take no effort to leave. He could get out of the bunker and be thousands of miles away in the space of a heartbeat. With the flick of his wrist, he could break Dean’s arm or send him careening into the wall. Castiel had all of the power to make it stop, but none of the strength required to do so. Instead, Castiel sighed and grabbed Dean’s face with both of his hands. “You matter more than anything,” he breathed across Dean’s lips before kissing him hard, pouring everything he had into the kiss. He could feel Dean quivering against him, as Dean slid a thigh between Castiel’s legs.
Dean rolled his eyes, lips seeking Castiel’s. When Cas turned his face away, Dean groaned in frustration. But Dean was relentless, so he started to kiss up Castiel’s jaw. Stopping to bite his earlobe, Dean whispered, “She didn’t matter.” In the same moment, Dean cupped Cas’s erection through his pants. The angel shuddered and put his hand on Dean’s pushing it away. Dean chuckled and resumed groping with more fervor. “Stop playing hard to get, sweetheart,” he added before latching onto the pulse point in Castiel’s neck.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Listen, Cas. I never said...well I know never said it enough, but...ummm....The number of times you put yourself on the line for us, sacrificed yourself for us. For me..." Dean paused, clearly struggling.
Sam motioned toward the cluttered tables and gave a half grin, “I’ve been trying to sort through all of the information the Men of Letters have. And I found a bunch of stuff on angels. I was hoping you’d be willing to look it over, tell me if they got anything right?” Castiel opened his mouth the refuse, shifting awkwardly on his feet, but Sam just added, “I’m going to run down to storage to see if there are more files, don’t move.” He took a few long strides and disappeared from the room.
Now that Sam was here, after a good, long, well-deserved life, Dean felt even more at peace. Not that he'd had to wait that long, time really did move differently there. Of all the times he'd been to heaven before, of all the iterations he had seen, he had never imagined that this kind of beauty and happiness would be possible. "Under new management," he chuckled to himself.
Dean opened his mouth to say something, but Cas spoke instead. "Now that you're here, do you want to have a drink? Catch up?" he asked motioning toward the chairs and table.
The tables in the bunker’s library were covered with papers and half empty boxes and open books, and Sam Winchester was fed up. He was tired of seeing his brother a mess. “Maybe this isn’t going to change anything,” Sam thought, “but neither is doing nothing.” He was pacing back and forth, his cell phone in his hand, and glancing at the time every few minutes. Finally, there was a  rush of wings behind him, and he spun on his heel to face Castiel. The angel looked drawn and tired and uncomfortable.
But then Dean’s calls, which had not really ceased since they began, became more desperate, more insistent. Without another thought, Castiel was inside Dean’s room at the foot of the bed. Dean was at the top of the bed, leaning against the wall and staring at the center of the room as though he knew that was where the angel would appear. His legs and arms crossed almost defensively, but when Cas dropped into the room, Dean immediately opened up and crawled to the end of the bed. An empty bottle rolled from the bed onto the floor as he moved. Wordlessly, he got up on his knees and reached for Castiel, grabbing his tie and pulling him in for a bruising kiss. The pair sighed in unison when their lips connected, and the tension bled from their bodies. Castiel could taste the bite of whiskey on Dean’s tongue, as it demanded entrance to his mouth. The most rational of his brain threw up a red flag, but the longing in every other part of him overruled it. Dean moved his mouth from Castiel’s lips, across his jaw to the spot behind his ear. Cas groaned and wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck, pressing as much of his body against Dean as he could. Dean began murmuring against Castiel’s neck, his mouth sucking and biting Cas’s skin.
Dean looked from the record to Cas and then back again, and something inside him snapped. "No. No, you know what, this is ridiculous," Dean burst suddenly.
The angel narrowed his eyes and surveyed the cluttered tables. He should leave. He knew at any moment Dean could walk into the room and Castiel would be faced with another dismissal. The smart thing to do would be to leave before Dean’s denial or ignorance or whatever forced Castiel away. He leaned against the table, unable to move, and then he felt Dean’s eyes on his back. He tightened his shoulders and dropped his head.
“No,” Dean snapped, finality in his tone. So Sam bit his tongue and climbed into the passenger’s seat as Dean turned the ignition.
“Do you want to grab a beer?” Sam asked as they threw their shovels into the trunk. “Digging up a grave always makes me thirsty.”
Dean crossed his arms over his chest and looked around feigning scrutiny. "Looks pretty much exactly like I remember it," his eyes landed back on Cas, "But I thought heaven wasn't just memories anymore? Bobby said that you..."
Castiel smiled and looked down at the floor for a moment before looking back up at Dean, "Well, yes. This is my corner of heaven, like Bobby and Ellen have the Roadhouse. Like John and Mary have their home. After Jack pulled me out of the empty, and we reconfigured heaven, he made sure I had somewhere special...somewhere that made me happy."
Dean gasped, hand seizing around the cheek he was still distractedly kneading. His cock twitched, alert. It wasn’t like it had all been slow and sweet lovemaking, both had sported a few bruises in more than one occasion, but Castiel had never bit him like that. In retaliation. In punishment almost.
“Yes, yes, love,” Dean’s chest was suddenly pressed against his back, without Castiel even noticing he had been pulled up, and Dean an arm around him to take over the movements.
"I don't care. You messed up, I messed up, everyone does, all I need is you with me. We can fail together," he smiled at Cass, then turned slightly to kiss his palm, lips lingering against the warm skin.
“Did they? Do you really believe you meant something to them? no one but them meant something to the Winchester, Castiel. They roamed the Earth breaking hearts and leaving people behind, you were just another they used, you just lasted longer because of your nice angel powers. Ohhh, but maybe you expected something different, maybe you thought Dean was going to say those three words back?” the cruel voice turned into a fake sweetness at the end, a teasing empathy that was incredibly wrong on Dean’s lips, which was perfect to Cas, perfect to remember that wasn’t Dean. Not that the doubt had ever crossed his mind.
Instead, he raised his hand, cupping Castiel's face, and this time the kiss got more intense, the angel's lips opening under his, asking for more and the moment their tongues met Dean was sure no beer or pie had ever tasted better or sweeter, that mouth definitely was something he was going to get addicted to, a very welcome addiction.
Gulping down a new moan, Dean reached up, squeezing both cheeks in his hands, losing concentration only for a moment, when he tried to raise his hips but Castiel pushed him down against the bed. He loves those shows of strength, enough to remind him it was an Angel he was in bed with, his powers and strength almost unlimited. A powerful soldier.
And yeah, there was so much going on. He knew that. He was scared but at the same time, he knew that rushing wasn’t going to make things easier.
But, yeah, not all is as it seems. And that glorious saying comes to mind when writing this chapter 'Assumption is the mother of all fuckups'. I guess both sides had a part to play in this massive miscommunication. But, things will move forward, hopefully.
to sleep; peering through his thin, moth eaten covers, he watched as Dean and Anna slowly ravaged each other.
. And, he felt this jolt in his heart. He knew Cas felt it too. The omega slowed his pace and jogged over to the banks of the stream, peering at the running water, before lowering his head and lapping water into his mouth.
And he did meet that special someone 10 years ago, in his opinion at the most horrible of events- senior prom.
Sam had witnessed the death of his girlfriend Jessica Moore, at the tender age of 16. Her youngest son had boasted about how he felt Jessica was the one and that he would marry her one day, he was the happiest ever. That was until he witnessed the gruesome scene of Jessica’s alpha dad ripping her throat with his bare sharp teeth, all because he was sick in the head. Her death had paved a dark path of depression for her son, who had to see a therapist for almost a year until he was able to cope well. Sam mentioned her from time to time, it got easier as the years went by.
Dean chuckled, “you have a naughty way of marking me as yours, hmm”. The wolf slipped a hand into his pants, squeezing the globe of his firm ass. “I like it”.
He immediately sat up and smiled through the darkness. He replied, “Hey babe. I’m awake. Come in.” He flung his sheets off and sat up on the edge of the mattress, turning his bedside lamp on.
If face time and skyping told him anything about the omega in these last 2 years that he’s been away- it’s that Cas had grown up to be a full blown beauty. He wondered if the camera was doing the
Oh how his heart squeezed in sadness. There goes his chance of hoping that the alpha was into him. And, what was he thinking, the alpha would probably run away if he saw the marks that littered his back and torso…..and not to mention he was a HALFBREED! No pure bred alpha would ever dare mate him. He felt his vision blur, “Well, I wish you nothing but happiness with your chosen omega. You should get back to him or her, as they must be waiting for you back at the Annual Meet.”
It was like they didn’t care that they were getting it on in the front yard of the house where every one of Cas family members could see. No one existed but them.
His pack had successfully defeated the no good northerners that had once killed many in their pack. For a week now, around the fire, the alphas drank to the lost souls of their pack members, to finally claiming the revenge they sought.
Charlie winked, “Oh you know me, Cassie! I go all out when it’s time to hit the bar”. She added with a purr, “though, I believe you’ll be the eye candy tonight. I still don’t get how you’re still single with that perfect ass, body and sex hair- and damn have YOU checked YOU out? You’re like a walking wet dream when you’re out in casual!”
The alpha looked slightly saddened, “No, I don’t have a mate. I’m a single dad.” The alpha almost said shyly, “However, I was hoping that I would find that perfect omega to be a part of mine and my son’s life.”
Cas grazed those lips gently across his, before pulling away with a big smile. The man carefully turned around in his arms- with the bee still being cuddled into the man’s chest. He instinctively wrapped his arms around Cas waist- both his palms rested flat on Cas tummy, while he enjoyed the snuggle of the blue eyed man’s back into his entire front chest and torso. He laid his chin lightly over Cas left shoulder, and, just stood there-  both lightly swaying side to side, as they glanced out over the waters of the glassy lake.
’. He looked down at the honeyed eyes that were studying him with equal curiosity. He asked, “I’m Blue?”
Raphael smoothed out the lapels of his jacket. He really didn’t care much for Castiel’s warnings, snipping out, “That’s what these omegas become when sold off, Castiel. Sluts for them alphas. Sex slaves. Might as well call them as they are!”
Dean took in a deep breath trying to settle himself, before wrapping an arm around Cas mid waist and pulling his omega to his side. “Anna, there are many ways my omega can take care of me despite his young age”.
He watched as the green eyed alphas snarl slowly disappeared, only to tilt its head curiously to the side, studying the younger brown eyed wolf, questioningly. Meanwhile, the older wolf with strands of silver grey fur embedded in between its black fur- just stood there, leaving the two alphas to whatever was going on.
He hadn’t realized that his tears were streaming down his face until he heard the omega within him give out an involuntary whimper of sadness. He couldn’t do anything as he sat there, in the grass, at the edge of the top of his hill, watching and knowing that nothing good would ever come.
Cas liked to chase the friendly rabbits who have made a home in their mother’s gardens. He doesn’t eat them, or attempt to harm them; he just like likes their bushy tails fanning across his snout- which the rabbits are fond of pampering the little 5 year old omega with. Cas was like some
“Well, that sounds like quite the first day, Dean”. He could hear Sam’s brotherly smile in his voice, that was filled with warmth, as he said, “Take it easy today, Dean. Get through the first day and you’ll be fine”.
He was just visualizing how he would smash the damn car to smithereens, when his cell phone vibrated in the front pocket of his jeans. He felt his pockets, digging his hand into the tight space, and carefully tugging out the cellular device.
“I like making you feel good, Cas”. Dean added with a smirk, swinging their entwined arms back and forth, “So, shall be go grab some dinner?”
So, when Castiel followed his alpha, Sam and John into the forests he would call home, he did so with a sense of calmness and joy.
When they drew apart, it was to rest their foreheads against each other’s, breathing unto each others’ lips. Deans’ grip on Cas waist was still delicate and sure. Though, it was a short, sweet kiss; it was still the best kiss he has ever experienced in his entire life.
Both were hungry. Both growled and gave all they had. Covered in hay and rolling around back and forth with their mouths refusing to give up their pleasuring. This went on for several more minutes before Dean’s felt the omegas juices drown his tongue, flowing down his chin as the young wolf came with such a force that had him crying out around Dean’s cock. Dean drank the omegas delicious juices, like a greedy alpha.
A/N: Hey everyone! Apologies that I had to cut this fic short, I know there is more to the story that can be added and so I have decided that I will work on a second part soon.
The air reeked of sex, pheromones, ale and intermingled scents. It was really not pleasing at all, instead making his omega wolf whine in displeasure.
He watched on as barbarian alphas ripped the clothes off female omegas chests, revealing their breasts. These northern omega whores were very compliant and allowed the barbarian alphas their indulgences.
They didn’t waste any time- well Castiel certainly didn’t- with the way he ordered Dean to strip, doing exactly the same, without warning shoving Dean unto the hay bed and swallowing that cock whole. There was some choking, some gagging, but soon, Castiel was expertly working that alphas cock with the right amount of suction and tonguing.
Cas pouted, before breaking out a small laugh. He laughed along with the omega- too cute to even let up. Cas then teased,
They stayed that way- snuggled and relaxed- Cas with his head still buried into his black furred chest, while, he rested the underside of his snout atop the omegas head- always comforting. The whole world for the next hour or so, was only centered on them.
He watched as Castiel worried at his bottom lip, before glassy eyes filled with tears met his. Oh how he wanted to turn the world upside down for the pure slightly guilty sight he was met with. The only thing that he could think of was how Castiel was the perfect description of a fallen angel living in a cruel and heartless world.
Of course, Charlie completely ignored him, in favor of racking up the pool balls into the triangle. When she was done, she grabbed two cue sticks and walked over to him. Her smile was as-sweet-as-sugar, “Come on Cassie! Give it a try!” She added with the worlds biggest pout, “Pretty please, for me”.
He usually sat on his lonely porch, watching how all the pretty pure bred omega wolves of the Milton Pack would beautify themselves for tonight’s event; trying on eye-catching dresses or suits, getting their hair and makeup done. And secretly, he wished that he was one of those pretty pure bred wolves who were so excited to meet THE ONE. It was times like these that he loathed his tainted blood.
His insides felt worse than when the Empty was playing with them, a pain in his chest similar to someone ripping out his heart and lungs.
"Anything, Cas," Dean breathed out while running the tips of his fingers down along Castiel's spine.
Today felt like everything was possible and like even Dean Winchester could cut himself some slack and just be happy. He would have had time tomorrow to go back to feeling guilty.
"Cas! I give you one more chance, then I'll start praying to Jack to drag your angelic ass here!" He yelled again, eyes fixed into the dark sky. There were stars, he wondered for half a second how that Heaven thing actually worked, where they were, but he soon discarded the useless thought for another occasion. He had forever, after all.
“A little show and tell,” Castiel looked at Dean over his shoulder, dirty smirk once more on his lips, “I think I need to get you wet, first of all,” and before Dean could fully grasp the words, Castiel was scooting backwards to fully sit on his chest and take the tip of Dean’s cock in his mouth.
That had been unexpected, that had been something they never talked about, something he shouldn’t have done, at all. Dean felt a ball of panic form in his throat, hand still raised mid air, but before he could freak out for real, Castiel sank on his cock all the way, until he was sitting on his hips, their balls brushing.
“He lost control of his power! Do you want the body count of when you had the mark? Of Sam without a soul? Jack had the knowledge of a kid and the power of a God!”
It was another cheap motel room, dark red bedspreads, plastic chairs and a dusty wallpaper out of the 80s, yet nothing had felt cosier to Dean in a long time.
The keys still in the car, both brothers just stood while watching Castiel approach the car, climb in the back. In his place. With them, on the Impala.
"Stop," Dean ordered and took the last step, getting close enough he could smell Castiel's scent, different, more like it was at the beginning, the scent of a storm, "Cas, man, look at me," his voice had turned soft and he raised his hand to put it on his shoulder.
In the dark room, Dean turned into bed for the hundredth time that night, groggily looking at the alarm that informed him it was just past 3 am. Apparently, that was one of the lows of being well rested: once you're not too exhausted to even think, your brain takes over and you lose every chance at sleeping again. Maybe it was good. Maybe it meant in a few days he was going back to be dead on his feet and back at passing out for four hours straight the moment he touched the bed. The problem, though, was how to make it to the next few days, because Dean was sure he couldn't take that for long.
"Fuck you, you fucking winged bastard!" Dean yelled at the wall, "you asshole! You had no right to make suicidal deals! You had no right to make them assuming things! You have to come back, Castiel, because I need to tear you a new one! Do you hear me, idiot? You decided for me, for my existence! You had no right to offer my happiness too!" He kept screaming, angry, but then he just hid his face in his hands, "please Cas, hear my prayers," he begged between sobs.
They had made it because there was nothing a Winchester couldn’t do, they had found a way, fought for him.
