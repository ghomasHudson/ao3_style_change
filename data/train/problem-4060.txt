“Do you know what this one is?” he asked, Dean shook his head. He didn’t seem to notice Dr Bailey checking his penis.
Dean still couldn’t tell where he was because as they moved the blue blanket shielded his vision. All he could see was Gabriel’s face and the lights above, making the man look like he had a halo.
Plating up one of the omelettes Gabriel cut it up before bring it over to the table. “Hope you like cheese omelettes kiddo,” Gabriel said, giving a side smile. Seeing Dean’s green eyes look up at him sadly Gabriel could tell the small boy was still scared of him.
“Um…hi, who are you?” Gabriel asked, giving the man a weary look.
Gabriel bit into his bottom lip, holding back his own tears. He had to be strong for his baby brother. “I’ll get him back,” he said hugging Castiel tightly, he was going to get him back.
“You’ll have to take him tomorrow. We’ll go look at cars this afternoon and if we don’t find anything I'll take you.”
Rolling his eyes, Castiel grabbed the stroller walking away. Dean watched him go, his insides gurgled seeing Castiel leave. Worse, Gabriel was holding him very tightly, which wasn’t helping his bladder.
Undoing the tray Castiel lifted Dean up. Sitting him on his lap to face him Castiel bit his cheek to stop from smiling. His baby was so cute.
“He’s in that,” Gabriel said, pointing down by Castiel’s feet. Turning away from his brother, Castiel saw a beautiful stroller next to his feet by the sofa. Standing up he walked over to it to find Dean sleeping soundly. Castiel smiled. His boy he looked so comfortable with his blue blanket laying across him.
Taking out his phone Gabriel sighed to himself, he really didn’t know what to do. Holding his phone to his ear he walked out of the toy store to sit on a bench outside.
“WHAT did you do” Michael repeated though his teeth.
Taking his Daddy’s hand, Sam happily tugged him along to get to the next store faster.
“..Cold..” Dean groaned, feeling the cold wipes on his bum.
Deans face dropped he was starting to regret his acting out. Shaking his head, Dean looked up to Gabriel with tears in his eyes “nu….nu.”
“..ye..” Dean said pushing the nipple out with his tongue. Scoffing Castiel put the bottle down on the floor next to the recliner, his little boy seemed to really like watching his show. He didn’t think Dean would enjoy watching such a young age TV show. Lowering his legs. Castiel stood with Dean in his arms.
And was he sitting eating his body size of creamy goodness? Nope, he was sitting in a waiting room of a doctor’s surgery on his Daddy’s lap. He wasn’t impressed that Daddy had failed to tell him that they were doing this first.
“Is he okay?” Michael asked, looking at them in the mirror making Dean jump at the new voice, he really wasn’t sure about Michael yet, but hearing the man’s cold, still voice did make him feel glad that he didn’t have the same warm but gruff voice as his Daddy.
“Shhh..it’s okay Dean, Daddy’s here, Daddy’s here.” Changing Dean with tears in his eyes, Castiel felt lost at what to do, nothing he was doing was working to calm his baby down.
“You changed him?” Castiel said, sounding disappointed, It did annoy him that his brother got to change Dean’s first diaper. He wanted to have that moment with his baby. Looking back down, he saw Dean was still looking at him, looking very tried. His baby seemed shockingly calm to him.
Gabriel looked at the boy in his arms in shock, why would Sam ask him that, “Why would I get rid of you? I just got you five minutes ago,” he half huffed, half laughed.
“Okay then, I’m heading out.” Bending down Gabriel rubbed the top of Dean’s head with his thumb. “Goodnight kiddo, you be a good baby now.” Seeing Dean lean into his touch Gabriel smiled at his new nephew.
Smiling, Gabriel could tell Sam was nervous. His baby had been silent since he woke from his nap. When Castiel called saying it was okay to come over, he was so happy. He was fearful that Castiel would say no, he didn’t know what he would have done with a very upset little boy.
Once he’d left the room to get ready, Gabriel let out the biggest gust of a laugh Dean had heard, Castiel scowled, “ A homemade, huh?” He asked sarcastically, swiping his finger back in forth in the air, indicating a gesture to both of them. “It was a spontaneous thing, ok?” Dean huffed and let his head fall to the table. Rowena pursed her lips as a way to stop herself from giggling, Gabriel didn’t even try to refrain.
__________________________________
They pulled into the Bunker’s drive way and got out of the Impala, walking inside they were relieved to find Sam and Rowena reading while Gabriel was Chuck knows where. “ sam, ypárchei próvlima.” Cas stated as soon as he got to the library. Sam looked worried at the angel’s use of a different language, but Rowena understood. Why are you speaking Greek, dear?” She asked, “ makrá istoría.” He replied, she sighed, “Oh, I see. She cast a spell one you, huh?” Castiel nodded.
Sam chuckled, “Then what is it then? ‘Special’ anime porn?” He scoffed playfully with air quotes, Dean’s face pinched together, and he covered his mouth forcefully, Sam rolled his eyes and shook his head, “It’s not like you’ve ever been ashamed of porn before, I mean how bad could it be? Come on, Dean, what’s on the tape?” He asked with a slight laugh, Dean clenched his teeth in protest but words flew out, “ A homemade video of me and mph-!” Cas blockaded his mouth with one of the napkins on the bunker kitchen table, knowing that uncursed Dean wouldn’t want this knowledge out.  Dean sighed. “Thanks.” Castiel nodded.
“Don’t worry about it Sammy.” He glared at the witch and Archangel, “Not a word.” He said towards them, Sam looked once again confused and slightly offended at his being left out of the conversation. “ Oh, don’t worry Dean, but he wouldn’t be wrong, even old dad had been experimental at one point.” Gabriel said with a snort, Dean death flared him, Rowena laughed loudly , Cas patted Dean on the back once more, and Sam looked more confused.

Dean got the hint and walked over to look at himself, “Damnit Cas!” He exclaimed, rubbing at his head as if to make the glittery pink color get out of his hair. Castiel had written him a note on notebook paper and held it up to him. ‘You look fine Cinderella’ Castiel shrugged, Dean spluttered angrily, “Get this the hell out of my hair!” He demanded, Cas didn’t quite roll his eyes but the eye gesture was very similar. He hovered his hand over Dean’s head, and the color faded out. Dean looked back in the mirror, he sighed “Thanks.” He said, Castiel nodded and left the room.
Dean pressed his lips shut as much as he could, and it worked for about 20 seconds before his mouth betrayed him and said “Almost every night.” He hit the table, “Damnit!” He whisper yelled, Gabriel suppressed a laugh and Rowena just laughed, “I’m going to bed.” Dean grumbled and walked away, “ aftó ítan aparádekto gia.” Castiel growled and followed Dean. “Have fun!” Gabriel said with a snicker, Rowena rolled her eyes.
“Would you like some water?” She asked, Cas shook his head no, but Dean accepted the offer. She got him a glass and she sat down. “So, why is the FBI here?” She asked, Dean cleared his throat. “16 men had some accidents, all a week before all of them were found dead. All on the same days.” She put her hand over her chest, a look of surprise catching her, “Oh that’s terrible! Wait, what do I have to do with this?” She asked, Dean narrowed his eyes, “ Well, all of these men seem to have had a connection with you at some point.” He responded, she tilted her head. They both pulled out files, showing her the faces of the men. She became tense, “We just want to ask you some questions about them, and then this’ll be over, ok?” Dean reminded, looking over at Cas with a face of suspicion.
Cas rolled his eyes, ‘You aren’t just saying the truth , you’re doing what you want.’ He wrote, Dean nodded, “Oh, ok. And your spell’s alright?” Cas hummed, ‘I’m fine.’ “Ok, good. Rowena should know about my thing right?” ‘Yes.’ “Ok,lets go?” ‘Yes.’
Dean and Cas took seats near Sam and Rowena, Gabriel sat on the end of the table. Castiel kept having to push Dean’s hand away seen as it kept coming all to close to his thigh under the table. At one point he had to pretend he dropped something to dodge an upcoming kiss that Dean would have given him if he stayed seated.
They met again in the kitchen, Sam starting to make breakfast, and Cas pouring himself a mug of coffee. Sam got straight to the point, “Why were you in Dean’s room?” He asked, Cas was a quick thinker, “ He took the keys to my truck, I think by accident. I was just retrieving them.” He replied, Sam shrugged and bought it. A few minutes later, an archangel emurged from the hallway, “Hey nerds, what do I owe the pleasure?” He grinned cheekily, Sam gave him the plate of toast that Castiel had turned down earlier. “Why are you up so early?” He asked, “Couldn’t sleep.” Gabriel shrugged. Cas tilted his head in confusion, “But- We don’t sleep.” He stated, Gabriel rolled his eyes, “We can if we want to, we just have to shift a few gears and vuala.” Both Sam and Cas were confused, “Whatever,” the archangel retorted and took a bite of the toast.
“I’m standing right here. And this is kind of concerning.” Dean stated, taking a seat across from Cas. Sam nodded, “I know, you’ll be fine.” Sam scoffed, “I know I will, it’s my big mouth I’m worried about, and Cas.” Sam sighed and looked around the room. “I still just don’t get it, none of your secrets could possibly be that bad.”
He thought of a quick idea, Dean started to pray. “I don’t know if you can hear me, or if you can respond, but Cas I need you to be here. I, Cas, or Castiel if that’s how to get your attention, I absolutely can not do this Chuck bullshit without you, man. And there are obviously some things I need to say, and ask.” He dropped his head, taking a deep breath,
The witch panicked and tried to run, Dean had it aimed and before he shot, she screamed a string of random words in Greek. “ den mourmourízei típota í na eínai alítheia!” Her shout was cut short as a witch killing bullet shot into her head.
On their way back to Sam and Rowena, they ran into Gabriel in the hallway, who did not by any means look happy.
“Oh, you know, all ‘Dean, eínai entáxei, o Theós latrévei tous fílous.’” He finished in Greek, not meaning to, but grateful he figured out to. Gabriel grinned, and Rowena held back a smile, Sam tilted his head in confusion, “I only recognize the Greek words ‘god’ and ‘love’ from your sentence that was supposed to mock me and I’m highly confused.” He responded, Dean smiled apologetically, and then figured out Gabriel and Rowena had understood him, as well as Cas but he wasn’t as important.
A lot of things went without saying, for example that they weren’t telling anyone about it. Why would they? Dean didn’t think Sam would be unaccepting, he just thought he might get all ‘Sam’, which meant way too nice about it. Cas thought this was fair, as he put it “No one needs to know, it isn’t about them.” And as Dean put it, “ If they find out, they find out. But we don’t need to throw a friggin’ pride parade.”
Gabriel came home with the food, and set it on the table, he looked puzzled between Dean and Cas. “I know something happened to them but I’m not sure what.” He stated, taking an even more close look at Dean. “ ítan mia mágissa.” Castiel responded, Gabriel nodded, “Ohh the witch, ok. So what happened to him?”
Cas sighed and rolled onto his back, the bunker beds making little noise. Dean huffed a laugh and turned to face the angel, “You are not one bit off your game, Cas.” Cas hummed and smiled very slightly. “Thankyou. I believe it’s because humans can only increase their heart rate so much, so-“ Before he could finish, Dean had cut him off, “It’s ok Cas, I don’t need a play by play.” He said sarcastically. “Alright.” The angel answered. “Wanna go again?” Dean asked, blue eyes darkened, followed by a ‘yes’.
Sam grimaced and rolled his eyes, “What so Cas can know? What is this, about your profound bound or something?” He asked, still slightly chuckling, “Something like that.” Dean mumbled, Sam finished his food, side eyeing Dean the whole time.
“But don’t we have research to do?” Gabriel asked, Sam nodded. “Yeah, we have to research more on the consequences of opening that portal. Maybe only one of us could take down the witch? Dean?” Dean started to pay attention when his name was called, “Yeah, ‘course. I’m the one with the car, and I need to get some air. But uh, I need backup, so I’m taking Cas.” He said, Cas looked up, slightly baffled. “I never said I was going.” He argued, “Yeah but I need backup man, and you’re the angel for the job.” Dean rebutted, throwing in a very subtle look that only Cas would pick up.
when he did tear up, choking on his breath.
Same furrowed his eyebrows, “ Why didn’t we know about this?” He asked, “Because you’ve only seen people die from a spell, or be cured.” Dean nodded, “Makes sense.” He stated. Rowena smiled at the fact that she didn’t need to explain anything else. “Is there anything we can do to stop it?” Sam asked, Rowena’s face fell, “No, you’re just going to have to wait until the spell wears off. He can write things down if he needs to speak.”
He almost expected a whoosh and a ‘Hello Dean’. But it didn’t happen, no whoosh, no ridiculously deep voice, no Castiel. “Damnit!” Dean cursed, throwing a book at the brick wall and seeing it hit the floor.
By the time he had finished the books and note taking, and praying. (God, he had prayed more times in one night than all of the times in his life.) It’d been past morning, nearly 9 o’clock. He inhaled, rubbing his temples and leaving his room for some coffee. In the kitchen sat Jack at the table with a bowl of ‘Kookie Krunch’ and Sam making one of his smoothies. He thought maybe some good old teasing could maybe take his mind off of Cas, “Health freak.” He muttered, pushing Sam out of the way to get a mug and some coffee from the pot. But it was weird, instead of Sam rolling his eyes or shoving him back, he just smiled with what looked like sympathy.
“What about Dean?” Sam asked Rowena, she shrugged, “We’re going to have to find out.” He looked bemused, “Shat?” He asked, she breathed out, “ No one is hurt, no one will get hurt, so far I can’t see what’s changing with Dean, but something will happen.” She responded, her hands gesturing to Dean.
Once he sat
“ chtypíthike me éna xórki alítheias.” Cas answered, Gabriel laughed loudly, “Truth spell! Classic!” Cas and Dean both shot him a look. “It really isn’t that funny at all.” Dean grumbled, Gabriel raised his eyebrow, “Isn’t it though?” He chuckled more and unpacked the food. “Wait, you can understand Greek?” Sam questioned both Rowena and Gabriel, “I’m an archangel.” and “I’m a witch.” They both answered. Dean nodded as if saying ‘Makes sense’.
Dean raised his eyebrows, “ Was that dirty talk, Cas?” He asked in surprise, Castiel shrugged sarcastically, “It might have been.” Was his response. Dean gave a quiet, short laugh, mouthing ‘wow’.
__________________________
Dean rushed to the library and picked up a notebook and pen, bringing them to Cas and placing them on the table, Cas smiled, ‘Thankyou’ he wrote. “Any time. Seriously, anything.” Dean replied, scowling at himself for the answer. Rowena  snorted quietly, Sam gave a confused, slightly amused look.
‘ He took my coffee’ Cas lied onto the paper, Gabriel scoffed, Rowena nodded ridiculingly, Sam stayed confused. “They’ll be fine, Samuel. It’ll only be a few days.” Rowena assured, ready to explain to Gabriel what was going on.
“ This is really confusing.” Sam said, walking away to his room. Cas looked apologetic towards Sam and sat down. Dean took a seat and loaded up a plate with pizza and Chinese food. “Awesome.” He said studying the plate. Rowena looked between them, “So, you two?” She asked, her face looking mischievous, Castiel flared at her, Dean looked up and he didn’t mean to but, “Yep.” He said. Gabriel chuckled, “Knew it, not so uptight after all, huh Castastic?” Castiel made a face, “ parakaló min mou tilefoneíte.” Gabriel snorted, “No, little brother, I don’t think I will refrain from calling you that.”
And Cas picked it up pretty clearly, clearing his throat, he nodded. “I suppose I could go, the witch sounds dangerous, and my grace may be of assistance.” Gabriel’s face held confusion as he noticed the sudden change in Castiel’s tone and choice. Then his face shifted just slightly into a quirked brow, then his mouth opened. But as soon as a look of realization hit him, it was gone, and a look of mischief replaced it. Both Sam and Rowena hadn’t thought anything weird of the conversation though, maybe it was Gabriel’s ‘angelness’ that made him more perceptive.
Dean furrowed his eyebrows before doing the oddest thing, standing up, taking Cas by the hand, saying “Gotta run, taking Cas.” And heading down the hall.
Sam looked at his brother in awe, it was rare that he’d show this amount of emotion, anyone knows that. Jack looked down for a moment, then back up. “ We will figure it out, Dean. There has to be some way we can get him back.” He tried to assure, Dean looked up and smiled sadly, “ Wishful thinking is good kid, but I think this is out of our control.” He sniffed and got up quickly, trying to pretend that never happened. “Dean, why don’t you get something to eat? Maybe get some sleep?” Sam asked, being concerned for Dean’s current state. “I’m not very hungry Sammy, or tired. I’ll um, I’ll be in the library.” He nodded at the both of them and walked as fast as he could to the bunker library.
Dean smiled, “ Relax Cas, I was helping.” He said, clearly being sarcastic. “I am calm.” Cas said, sounding a mix of irritated and confused as to why Dean ordered for him. The waitress laughed from next to the booth. “Y’all are cute.” She stated, they both realized she was there and struggled for words. “ Oh, uh, we aren’t-“ Dean started, Cas finished for him “in a relationship.”
Dean and Cas both looked startled, “Oh,” Dean answered, “Sorry for you, but not for myself.” He said, nodding, but also looking slightly embarrassed. Gabriel scoffed, starting down the hall, Dean and Cas following.
“We gotta find out who Lorana Rand is, because she what? Just happened to date all of them? I don’t buy it.” Dean said, sitting back into the driver seat, Cas sighed, “Yes, it is definitely suspicious.” Dean nodded, “Yeah. The first girl told us where she lived, and her number. But I don’t think we should call her, it’ll give her time to think of lies.”
Dean looked slightly defeated, “ That’s ok, Jack. We’ll figure it out.” Sam nodded in agreement. Jack looked at the floor apologetically. “I need a drink.” Dean stated, and walked outside to Baby. “Aren’t you forgetting that no one is on Earth?” Jack asked, Dean nodded, “That only means free beer.” Dean answered. Sam and Jack followed him to the car.
“He could speak Greek before, now he can’t speak anything. Like the poor dear’s mute.” She explained, gesturing to the grumpy looking angel. “That’s terrible, and a little worrying.” Dean stated, not meaning to add the ‘worrying’ portion, “Why?” Sam asked, Rowena sighed, “It could very well be a side effect of the original spell. Sometimes things like this happen during the spell’s, well what you could call, ‘shedding process’.” Everyone gave her a look, she rolled her eyes, “When someone is about to come off a spell, the spell could change briefly.”
Sam looked at the situation, confused. Cas noticed and grabbed a notebook and pen to explain. ‘A similar exchange happened earlier and I don’t think he wants a certain knowledge to be known.’ Cas wrote, Sam furrowed his eyebrows, “Oh, ok, I guess.” Rowena smirked, “I’m quite curious as to what it is. We won’t judge dear, you can tell us.”
“Not bad, no one said they were bad, per se, actually they’re awesome, but I don’t need you in my business.” He said, hissing at the slight insult toward Sam. Speaking of, looked baffled. “Why? It’s not like I have anyone to tell.”
He took in Dean’s appearance. “It is what it looks like. Damnit!” The older brother admitted, rubbing the bridge of his nose. Cas looked ashamedly at the floor from where he was standing. “Was this the secret?” Sam asked
As Dean was about to open the door to his room, Cas tapped him on the shoulder, “What?” The angel shook his head and snapped, Dean’s jeans now covered his boxers and his hair was less tousled, “Oh, thanks.” Cas nodded.
When Cas stirred in the morning, Dean immediately woke from the slumber he had fallen into not long before, his whole attention on the angel. Cas yawned, sat up, and then his eyes found Dean, lighting up in his face that looked so much healthier than it had done the previous day.
“I’ll have a talk about this with Rowena.”
And Dean hated it, but his life had taught him to always expect the worst, so his first thought while catching Cas’ weight in his arms was that it's a joke. That Chuck pulled another of his sick shenanigans. Bringing Cas back, only to have him die in Dean's arms. And while the last days were desperation, emptiness, his heart an empty shell inside his chest, that would have
There was a wound at the side of his neck, and Dean could feel blood seeping into his jeans, so Cas had to be hurt even worse, and his voice on the phone had sounded so weak-
An invisible force seemed to have punched Dean in the stomach, all the air leaving his lungs, and he felt tears well up in his eyes. He remembered them. Remembered their faces. Remembered a faded black and white photo that his father had handed him – one that was a bit blurry, but, more importantly, so very
Instead of answering that, Dean slung both of his arms around Cas, holding him tight to his chest, before he started softly rubbing his hands up and down Cas’ back. And Dean caught the exact moment in which Cas understood, for there was a soft laugh, and the temperature seemed to drop by at least 20 degrees in a heartbeat. Before Dean could regret his request though, a blanket appeared around both of them, as well as two steaming mugs on the ground next to their bench, and despite their delicious smell, Dean decided that they could wait for a little longer. For now, everything he wanted was to snuggle his angel closer, and that he did. Their breath painting puffy clouds into the freezing winter air, and Dean’s heart beating in nothing but peace.
“You’ll go all Sam on me.”
“Boys, we have a problem.” Rowena called to Sam and Dean, they both speed walked to the bunker map table from their rooms, finding Rowena and Cas sitting down, Cas looking utterly distressed. “What’s wrong?” Sam asked, Rowena pursed her lips before speaking, “It’s the angel, Castiel, he can’t speak.” Dean squinted, “ What do you mean?” He asked, Sam nodding along with the question.
She came back ten minutes later, holding several files. “ Here, these are their case files, basically everything about them, pictures, et cetera. We have copies so you’re welcome to keep those, if you need anything else I’ll be here.”  She said, handing the files to Dean.
The archangel gives an innocent look at Sam who looks slightly more annoyed, Cas puts a hand on Dean’s shoulder, “ What the hell, man. Is it something about me? Is something wrong that I should know about?” He asks, Cas takes a note pad and writes ‘No, he’s just insecure.’ Dean reads it and gives Cas a look, “What? Yes I am.” and then he recoils, “Seriously, I am.” He shuts his eyes in irritation and licks his lips. Gabriel snorts, earning a whack in the arm from Cas. “Seriously it’s fine Dean, you can tell me whatever it is, I won’t be mad, you know that.” Dean sighs, “I know, it’d be pretty dickbagg-y of you to be mad about that.” Sam looks baffled, “So why won’t you tell me?
He looked startled at his words, but Rowena explained for him, “ While I was figuring out what happened to you, I gave you a spell that’d help you understand and speak Greek.” Dean nodded and grinned, “Awesome.” Sam furrowed his eyebrows, “Can you do that for me?” He asked, Rowena looked back and forth between Dean , Cas, and Sam. And before she could reply, Gabriel had for her, “They’d rather you didn’t.” He said with a sneaky smile at Dean who looked back at him, bewildered, Cas cleared his throat, and looked towards Rowena, a way of asking ‘Why not Sam?’ She closed her eyes for around 10 seconds and opened them back up, “ I figured that if Dean could speak a different language, he’d be able to be comfortable with his spell if we didn’t understand what he was saying.” She explained, Sam looked confused and concerned, then a little offended, “What, so they can understand your truths and I can’t?” He asks to Dean, he shrugs. “ I have a feeling Gabriel here,” he looks toward Gabriel, who shrugs, “Already knows most of them judging by the way he’s been looking at me all day. By the way, can you not?” He finishes, asking Gabriel.
“Ahhh!” Dean cried. He didn’t like it. He knew he had had worse pain than this, but he didn’t like the fact that no one, especially Daddy, had warned him that they were going to give him shots.
Once Dean was changed into his new diaper, Castiel redid the snaps. Taking a baby wipe, he cleaned his boy’s face of tears and snot. Throwing the messy diaper into the bin, he washed his hands before picking Dean back up into his arms.
“Cas,” Feeling a warm hand on his shoulder Castiel sees Michael looking at him worried. “May I try something,” he asked, bring his other hand to Castiel’s face he rubbed his thumb along his cheek.
Nodding his head frantically Sam cried loudly. “I wanna...but I can’t…”
“Would you like me to care you for a while, Samuel?” Michael asked, holding his arms out, “I’m quiet tall so you’ll be higher the everyone else, even Daddy,” smirking to Gabriel, Michael grinned when Sam giggled jumping into his arms.
“Shall we watch tv while you have your bottle? I think your favourite lion guard is on soon.”
Castiel scoffed to himself. It was clear his big brother had fallen in love with being an Uncle. Maybe, just maybe, he would be a good Daddy to someone.
“It’s okay baby, Dean. You’ll be able to talk again soon. It’s all part of the process of getting you ready,” The man smiled down at him as he started to undo the blanket. “My name is Gabriel. I’m here to get you all sorted for your new daddy, baby boy.”
“Casey I was starting to worry. Is Dean okay? He just started to cry, those women just came up to us and….” Castiel raised his hand up to stop his brother talking,  Gabriel looked like he had been in a panic but Castiel didn’t care right now. All that mattered was that Dean was happy.
“And your uncle doesn’t understand the pleasure of a good lay in, does he Sammy?” Hearing Sam giggle into his neck, Gabriel kissed the boy’s cheek.
Castiel had a closer look at the stroller. It was one of the top brands, in a nice shade of scarlet. The hood was lit up with silver stars hanging above his baby’s head. Raising his eyebrow Castiel turned to look at Gabriel.
Dean could feel his cheeks redden. He had never felt so exposed before. He had been in just a diaper when he was with Daddy and Gabriel but that was different, now he was naked in front of a stranger. Cuddling into Daddy, Dean felt Castiel’s soft skin against his. Closing his eyes Dean lay his head on Castiel’s shoulder, it felt kind of nice being this close.
“Silly baby, don’t you want to see your new home?” Patting Dean’s bum. Castiel tried to encourage his boy.
“We will get to the toys, be patient Uncle Gabriel. I swear Dean, I’m starting to wonder who’s the kid here,” Castiel looked down at Dean, rolling his eyes playfully, making Dean scoff behind his pacifier. Castiel laughed, feeling Gabriel elbow him in the arm.
Castiel looked up at the men with wide eyes, they were here for Dean. “What are you talking about? I am legally his Caregiver, I have the papers to prove it,” Castiel could feel his anger rising with every minute, he was not letting anyone takes his baby.
Taking Castiel to Hannah’s was the hardest things he had ever done, but he knew his little brother was in no fit state to be any help and he knew Hannah will look after him.
“Didn’t you say you were going to change Dean’s name to Daisy and put him in pretty dresses?” Gabriel smirked, waving the dress in front of Dean.
Dean smiled victoriously, “We got her Cas! I mean I was like scared I’d die but we got her!” He exclaimed, but then his eyebrows furrowed, “I meant to say I was terrified.” Then he looked more appalled, “ I was really scared, I usually am.” Now Cas looked concerned, and when he went to say ‘Dean are you ok?’ It came out as “ Dean, eísai kalá?” And then he startled himself with his wording. “What the hell?” Dean asked, Cas’ eyes widened and he shrugged questioningly.
Dean switched to Greek incase  someone could hear him, “ se thélo.” He admitted in a whisper to Cas, who nodded understandingly, “ xéro, sto domátio.” He replied.
“So you and Dean?” He asked in a sigh to Cas, Cas took a deep breath and nodded.
“Please, Cas, please.”
It was enough of a difficulty having to dodge Sam when he thought of anything remotely related to Cas, and then he felt bad for dodging Sam. Cas was handling things miraculously well, and was very reassuring.
After leaving the diner at 9:30, they decided that Dean would check the bodies at the morgue, and Cas would talk to the sheriff again for more clarification.
Castiel looked confused, “I don’t remember making a promise.” And after a few seconds of thinking, “Oh, the clothing thing. Well, technically that isn’t a promise, it was more of a statement.”
When the three had gone through the notes and skimmed through the books. Dean had seemed to come to a conclusion, “Sammy, we’re going to hell.” Sam and Jack looked equally baffled, “What?” They said in unison. “Dean, how and why are we supposed to do that?” Sam questioned. Dean rolled his eyes, “ Rowena’s there, she could help.” He explained, turning the notes towards Sam and Jack. Sam nodded slowly, “We know that Jack’s been sucking up power, so maybe he’s strong enough to make a portal?” The statement came out as a question to Jack, the former nephilim frowned, “I’m sorry but I can’t, it’s not enough, I don’t even have enough power to be considered an angel yet.”
Castiel frowned. It did worry him what exactly has his brother had done. He really hoped Gabriel hadn’t gone to crazy. The man wasn’t known to do things normally.
“Dean!” he cried. Leaping from his chair, he ran to Gabriel plucking Dean out of his arms.
As he was turned back around he came face to face with a very angry looking Meg.
Dean smiled. Closing his eyes, he leaned into his Daddy’s warm body, breathing in the man’s scent. He felt truly happy for the first time in forever.
“I’m afraid Mr Novak can’t be your Daddy any more, but don’t worry we’ll find you a new family soon.”
“You want to just watch cartoons” nodding his head Dean looked up smiling to his Daddy glad the man understood him.
Seeing a small bit of fear in Meg’s eyes, Michael walked out of the room after his brother. He knew the first thing he was going to do when he got back to work was have a clean out of staff with the AB Program.
“It’s not too deep, I think you’ll be okay without stitches”, Sam told Cas, shortly clutching his hand before wrapping his back in bandages and gently putting a band aid on his neck.
"Did you fucking mean it??"
He answered the phone, “Cas?”, a question, a hope, a prayer.
, and Dean could have drowned in his happiness, hadn't it been for the fact that right after the split second it took him to take in Cas (Cas, his Cas, alive alive
“Cas”, not quite a sob but close to it, and Cas was next to him before Dean knew it.
. Or maybe she could see is in his eyes, his tears, it didn’t matter. What mattered was that when her fingers lightly brushed the tears off his cheek, Dean could feel her forgiveness.
“Thank you, Sam”, and Cas yawned, which Sam took as his cue to raise.
Dean could feel Cas' breath on his skin, on his
“Yes. It makes sense, really, how could it have been any different? But I didn’t know. I woke up in the empty, and I remembered us fighting against Billie, and I.. I don't know how I ended up there, or how I got back for that matter, only that I was glad that you weren't there. And at the same time, I felt as if there was.. something missing."
Cas couldn’t die. He
"Hm. I, I don't. When?”
So Dean was.. confused. And, even more so scared. Of having gotten it wrong, somehow, even though that didn’t seem possible. Of being too late.
, because there were so many words he wishes he’d have said, so many things he needed Cas to know, and yet his angel was hurt, he didn’t even know how bad, so he couldn’t, not yet. So instead, he placed a hand on Cas’ chest, felt his heart beating, and when Sam cleared his throat, Dean had no idea how long he already had stood there.
“Cas. Talk to me.
Dean’s phone rang, and it was as if the sound reached him from oh so far away, through a thick fog that had started to cloud his entire existence. Everything just seemed so… pointless, and even the movement of his head to glance down at his phone seemed like too much of an effort. What could it matter anyways? But the phone continued to ring, loud in a way that Dean couldn’t ignore, and he finally fixed his attention on it, even if it was just to turn it off, to be able to get lost in a deafening silence again.
And Dean still didn’t know how Cas had managed to get back to him, which heavenly or sinister (or both, those two seemed to overlap too often) forces might have had a hand in that. And he had no idea how Cas had lost a part of his memories, how he got hurt, what it all meant,
The angel smiled, softly, but didn’t say a word, just rested his hand on top of Dean’s. Dean squeezed it, gently ran his thumb over Cas’ skin, and his heart beat as fast as if it wanted to jump out of his chest. They had started doing this, some time after reuniting in heaven; after Dean finally had found Cas and shouted at him and cried into his trenchcoat and then oh so softly took his face into his hands to kiss him. And he couldn’t say it, not yet, but Cas’ brilliantly bright smile told him that the angel,
"Dean", and Cas' brilliant blue gaze was grazed by tears.
And the hug was not followed by any more touching (which Dean might have expected, might have hoped for), Cas even took his hand back from where his fingers had bushed Dean’s, and the hunter could not remember ever being as confused. He tried not to be disappointed at Cas’ lack of words, he already had said so much, so much more than Dean deserved, but at the same time, he’d have expected some kind of.. happiness. Judged by Cas’ words, even surprise. Because it had seemed as if he hadn’t known, hadn’t been aware, and now, when Dean told him that he loved him too, which had seemed to be what Cas dreamed of, what he didn’t dare to dream of, he spoke of
Cas’ fingers tightened in Dean’s hair, and before leaning in for another kiss, he whispered “I’m yours.”
He nodded, his eyes never once leaving Cas’ face.
“Yes”, Cas breathed, and Dean drank that word in by softly pressing his lips to Cas’.
. Two women, arm in arm, the shorter one of them resting her head on the taller one’s shoulder, their laughter about a joke long forgotten captured forever on a square of paper. Dean hadn’t understood, hadn’t dared to hope, but with how they looked, and their happiness, and his father earlier that day having mentioned something about a surprise… And then John had explained. Who they had been, his voice as cold as when he talked about the worst of monsters. What they had become, an uncaring shrug. What he expected Dean to do, a glimmer in his eyes, as if he just
Dean didn’t really notice his knees giving in, only belatedly realized that he had fallen towards the ground, and the tears in his eyes clouded his vision too much to be able to see the confused glance the two women exchanged.
“Nothing”, and Dean could see that Cas didn’t believe him.
as his face when he was confused. Yes, cute was the right word, and at least in his head, Dean allowed it to himself.
“I love you.”
The words tasted foreign on Dean’s tongue, and yet saying them to Cas felt like coming home. And he had expected Cas to smile, had dreamed of his smile before waking up in loneliness and regrets, but… not like this. There was a hesitance to Cas’ smile, nearly a sadness, it was not nearly as bright as when he had bared his own heart to Dean. And Dean didn’t understand.
"Mean what?"
), the angel collapsed into his arms.
Dean didn’t quite notice standing up, getting to the stairs, he just knew he was running, as fast as he could and yet not fast enough, and then, finally, he reached the door. Paused, just a second, his heart wanting to burst out of his chest with fear, joy, possibilities.
"Someone."
", and Cas' voice was trembling while he took a step back, away from Dean, until his back hit the wall.
To find Cas looking at him, his eyes widened in wonder, in happiness, in
The other woman joined them, and suddenly, Dean found himself talking. Spluttering apologies, vomiting words about his father that he never had dared to say out loud before, and in their eyes, he saw that they could understand. And he hated that they did, could relate to the deep scars in his soul that never had quite managed to heal, but at the same time, it felt good, felt
. The taller one took a step forward, thereby placing herself between Dean and the other woman. And suddenly he knew.
Sam nodded, without a word but with so much understanding in his eyes, and Dean thought of how his baby brother always had been the smart one of them. He leaned in for a quick hug, and then wished Sam a good night, turning back to the bed. Where Cas, still shirtless and with his pants and shoes on, had curled himself up and fallen asleep. Dean’s heart did a funny little jump at that sight, and he carefully put off Cas’ shoes, placing them next to the bed, before he grabbed his warmest blanket and wrapped it tightly around the sleeping man. After a moment of consideration, he then sat down at the edge of the bed, his back to the wall, and watched Cas’ sleeping face. The whole night. And maybe there was its own kind of irony to that, Dean watching over his guardian angel sleep, but he didn’t think of it. As for the first time in days, in all the terrible endless seeming hours since he had lost Cas, his mind found peace.
“As Billie chased us. When you s-summoned the empty. To save me. You told me about the deal you made, and about the happiness, and you talked about me, as if-“
", Cas placed his hand on Dean's shoulder, the left one, and his touch seemed to burn through Dean's skin.
Understanding began to dawn on Cas’ face.
“Dean?”, he asked, so very careful, and three pairs of eyes focused on the angel.
And Dean couldn't take it anymore. He walked up to Cas, cornered him, and hissed through his teeth: "What you said to me. Before being t-taken away. Did you mean that? Or was that all a li-, just made up?"
“You do?”
. As if they hadn’t finally figured out that it was something else that they both dreamed of. Something more.
With a careful movement, he opened the door, and there stood Cas. Cas, trench coat, messy hair, blue eyes, he was
“Thank you”, and with that, Dean placed a quick kiss on Cas’ lips, just because he could.
“What?”, he mumbled, because this couldn’t be true, and at the same time, he never had wished for anything as much.
Dean let himself get lost in their kiss, the rain gently washing away the tears from his cheeks, and above them, the whole sky was lit by the bright rainbow.
"So. I don't remember what I told you exactly. And I'm sorry that I don't. But, answer me one question. Do you think that that means that it isn't true?"
But he wasn’t.
Only that in this case, having proved to be even more beautiful than being.
And then, his heart skipped a beat. Or three.
"I know, and I you too, of course I do, we're family", and Cas leaned over, hugged Dean, but it was.. careful, not really tight, not
It was raining. Softly, steadily, and Dean smiled. At first, he had thought that this wouldn’t be possible here, that heaven would be an eternity of nothing but bright sunshine, never a cloud in sight. But when he once had mentioned this towards Cas, on another sunny day a while after he had gotten here, Cas shook his head with a smile. He asked Dean if he’d like it if there was other weather, and Dean shrugged, not sure about that. The sun was nice, sure it was, especially when one could actually feel it on one’s skin, not through the windows of his car or as a faint thing hidden somewhere behind bunker walls. But nevertheless, Dean liked the thought of some variety, and Cas seemed to get what he meant.
. And that was exactly the reason why Dean's heart seized in fear. Because Chuck knew this. Knew him. Knew them. Probably knew Dean's own feelings better than Cas did, hell, better than he
Cas’ hand was warm in his, and Dean had an idea. An idea that he realized that he could follow, just like that. Here, in heaven, with Cas, being together, being safe. So, after a second to brace himself, he raised their joined hands, and kissed the back of Cas’. The angel’s intake of breath was sharp, and his blue eyes shone brightly. Dean never had been to the sea, never jumped into the waves in Hawaii or admired the endless blue off the coast of Greece, but here, getting lost in Cas’ eyes, he knew that their beauty was unparalleled, in heaven as well as on earth. And he knew that if he’d drown in them for each day in eternity, he’d do so with a smile.
Dean was taking a walk, not finding it strange anymore that the rain was softly falling on his face, but not soaking his jacket – these things tended to happen only when he wanted them, and right now, he could do without the cold seeping through to his skin. He wasn’t sure where he was, but that didn’t matter, as he had found out shortly after arriving here. There were no directions in heaven, but there also weren’t walls anymore, and whenever he found himself really wanting to be somewhere, his feet would take him there, or the road would lead him to just that place. And when he didn’t have a place in mind where he wanted to be, as he did right now, he nevertheless always ended up somewhere he liked it. Sometimes that would be a beautiful place, sometimes the house of an old friend, sometimes a meeting with someone he hadn’t expected. What he had noticed though was that some places were closer than others – if he wanted to visit Charlie, or surprise Bobby, he only needed to walk a few minutes, no matter the direction. Whereas when he ended up meeting someone he hadn’t seen around heaven before, it tended to be after longer walks, hours of driving. He supposed it had something to do with the people he held close to his heart also being close by, and he loved it.
"You, you don't remember?"
“Dean, look at me”, and Dean would follow that voice to hell and back, so he opened his eyes.
"I thought it was what you meant. I thought it was what I could have."
“Prospáthisa na ton therapéfso, den leitoúrgise. ti kánoume?” Cas asked, Sam looked once again confused. “Cas, dude, you're going to need to write that down in English because we have no idea what you’re saying and like I said earlier the Greek is doing-“ before Dean could finish, Cas slapped a hand over his mouth. When it was removed, Dean sighed in relief, “Thanks, Cas.” Castiel nodded, “ kanéna próvlima.”
‘Impatient.’ Cas wrote on Dean’s hand as they were walking down the hallway, Dean kept trying to kiss his neck. He ‘egraced’ the writing from Dean’s hand and in place wrote ‘Closet.’ They opened the door to the supply closet that had been the hallway.
“ Ok, we aren’t sure who the witch is, but she definitely lives in this town. Is there a pattern between victims?” Castiel asked, sitting down on the bed. Dean loaded up a gun with witch killing bullets across the room and looked over. “Uh, yeah. Vics were all guys, all in their 30s.”  Castiel nodded, processing the information, “ We should check the bodies, records, and ask the town if they know anything.”
“I know Cas.”
Dean followed, clad in only a tshirt, boxers, and his robe which contrasted to Cas’ full suit and trench coat. Everyone else had already been in the kitchen. After Dean finished his coffee, he looked towards Rowena first, “I can’t understand Cas anymore and that kind of pisses me off, so uhh, why can’t I?” He asked, not meaning to say he was pissed off about it. She frowned, “The spell wasn’t long term, 24 hours, dear.” He nodded, “So can’t you like re do it?”
The waitress gave them the check, and answered their few questions about the victims, five of them were regulars, the other five came in once in a while with family, and 6 didn’t go to the diner, but she saw them around town.
__________________________________
“Hello Dean?” Cas answered, Dean quickly answered, “All the vics have like, uh, lipstick prints by their heart.” Cas raised his eyebrows from the other side of the phone, “That’s definitely not right.” He replied, Dean nodded, “Yeah, I thought so too. Are you done at the station?”
When they had walked back into the room, the first words out of Dean’s mouth were “Where’s the coffee?” By then, Cas already had a cup ready for him. Gabriel’s face pinched up, “You drink black coffee? It’s better with cream and sugar.” Dean made a face, “Uh, absolutely not. Plain coffee is the best way to go, right Cas?” Castiel nodded, “Yes, I agree.” Dean looked at Gabriel with a face that said ‘see? I told you.’ Gabriel chuckled condescendingly, “You did not just ask
Dean shook her hand, “I’ll go get the records on victims, you’re welcome to come with me or stay here, whatever you’d like.” She said, already starting to walk away, Cas and Dean had decided to stay in the lobby, taking in the sight of other officers and what they had been doing.
“Ok, fine.”
“Huh, fair enough.” Dean replied, starting the car.
“Ok so first guy, he lived with his girlfriend, about 3 miles from here.” Dean continued to list off victims and their addresses. “We should go see the first victim’s girlfriend. She will know who he was associated with.” Cas replied, flipping through more of the files and noting down names, numbers, and addresses.
She stopped struggling and tilted her head, “Don’t be so sure.” She held up her hands, unbound and the rope picked apart.  Her movements were so fast you could say she flew to Cas, putting some sort of magic hold on his neck. He choked, trying to pry at the force but it didn’t work. “And you.” She walked towards Dean, “What are you gonna do tough guy? Where’s your gun?” She asked with a smirk, he looked confused and reached for the gun, it wasn’t there. She held it up and aimed it at him. Before she could shoot, Cas had lunged at her hands and grabbed the gun, tossing it to Dean.
“My name is Alethea.” She answered quickly. “She’s telling the truth.” Cas declared, she glared at him. “Why’d you kill those men?” Castiel asked, “Because they didn’t love me.” She answered angrily, still trying to break the rope, “So you killed them?” Dean asked, baffled. “It’s what they deserved. I’m beautiful, they should love me. They needed to pay for not loving me, everyone should.  She stated, Cas furrowed his eyebrows, “ Why are you telling us all of this?” The witch grinned, “Because I’ll kill you anyways. Dean gulped but rolled his eyes, “Like hell. “
Dean couldn't take it as he slumped down the wall, it all hit him at once, everything. The entire goodbye speech replaying in his mind, Cas getting covered by nothingness as he smiled down at Dean. He just couldn't take it as his phone rung, it was Sam, he couldn't seem to care as he hit ignore. He just couldn't take it as he covered his face with his hands, leaned over, and cried. He couldn't take it as he grabbed the flask from his inner pocket, took a big sip from it, and passed out on the ground. He dreamt of Castiel, instead of getting swallowed into the empty, leaned in and it was about to happen. No Billie, no empty, no Chuck, just Cas saying those three words, and leaning in. It was going to happen, Dean waited, and his face was so close, and then, he was getting shaken awake. "Dean! Come on, wake up." It was Sam and Jack. He gasped and got up, he slowly looked around, taking in what happened before he knocked out. His breathing got shaky and his eyes threatened to tear up, he gained his composure the best he could. "The dream was just getting good, Sammy." He sighed a laugh, and then fully understood the dream, the events, what he fell asleep from, and
Leaning into Castiel’s hand, Dean slowly started to wake. “Dada..”
Dean held onto his Daddy tightly as they walked through the house. The inside was even more amazing. It looked modern, with an old fashion and cosy feel to it. Dean was starting to feel dizzy trying to look at everything at once. He couldn’t believe he was going to live here, it was the nicest place he had ever seen. With all the looking around he was doing he didn’t notice someone walking in the hallway from the kitchen.
He had been startled awake at Dean’s body jumping next to him. Seeing his baby so upset and broken really was breaking his own heart. He never want this for his baby. He took Dean to give him love and a family, but after everything, he felt like he hadn’t done his job as a Daddy very well.
And Thank you Ambersagen xxxxxxxxxx
Sam thought he was going to be sick. He was feeling so nervous to the point that he could feel his whole body shake. He just couldn’t believe it, he was going to see Dean. After so long he was finally going to be back with his big brother.
Out of the corner of his eye Castiel saw a young, redhead girl running into the kitchen.
“Alright baby, but you have to hold ether my hand or Mickey’s hand at all times, okay?” Gabriel said, trying to sound a little stern. He didn’t want to lose his baby on their first outing.
“Guess he’s busy,” he whispered to himself. Sighing at his phone he scrolled down his names to Michael’s phone number.
“Here you go kiddo.” Looking up Dean smiled wide when he saw Gabriel walk up to them with a big ice cream sunday, just like the one the couple had.
“Would you like that bud? Then your car will stand out and be the best looking car in the whole town,” Gabriel grinned to Crowley for his quick thinking. Seeing the baby nod his head everyone relaxed, glad that there were no tantrums.
Once the movie started Castiel started to feed Dean small amounts of his lamb korma. Dean hummed at every mouth full. The rich, creamy taste made him never want it to end.
“Don’t be a tight-ass Daddy. Our boy has been looking forward to this I bet, so I wanted to spoil him,” Gabriel said, winking down at Dean. Picking up the spoon he scooped a small amount.
“Oh look Sammy, Uncle Mickey’s got your clothes all ready for you.”
Giving a slight nod, Gabriel shook his head in disapproval. It was one thing to take people against their will, that wasn’t so bad to him, especially when he thinks they’ll have a better life, but to take their minds from them was a step too far.
“Wow, look at you Sammy, you’ve grown so fast.” he said playfully, sounding shocked.
“Thank you Sammy,” Castiel smiled handing Dean Rosie, seeing his baby smile behind his bottle, Castiel looked back at his nephew to see tears run down his cheeks.
“Night-night Uncle Cas,” Charlie waved as Hannah cared her up the stairs.
Hannah walked over to Gabriel, letting him say his goodbye. “Come to me, my special flower. I'll walk with you and mommy to the car.” Taking Charlie in his arms again, Gabriel headed out, chatting away to the girl.
“Oh, you’re hungry!” Castiel sighed with relief when Dean noded his head happily. Feeling the panic leave him, Castiel chuckled to himself, feeling silly. “Let’s get my special boy something to eat, shall we?” Standing up, Castiel held Dean on his hip. Moving round the table he stood in front of the high-chair. “Aright baby, in you go.”
“Don’t have things,” Sam said tilting his head.
“Good, I’m glad he likes it. I need Deany’s help if we’re going to get you a good car, Cas. There is no way you are getting to pick it,” Gabriel laughed, winking to Dean in the mirror.  Hearing Dean giggling in the back both men smiled to each other.
“Oh you’re a big boy hum?” Nodding his head, Sam looked pleased. Gabriel smirked at how cute he looked. Turning the boy to be cradled in his arms Gabriel laughed when Sam squeaked at the quick movement. “Are you sure you’re a big boy?” he asked, grinning at his boy.
Snuggling into Sam’s body, Dean closed his eyes breathing in the sent of his little brother, this has truly been the best day of his life, he had his Sammy back and there was no way he was letting him go ever again.
“If that’s alright? I don’t feel like going home to that empty house.”
Smacking his hand on the back of her chair, Michael heard Lilith let out a gasp as he pulls her back to face him. “What did you do?” he said coldly glaring at her with his ice like eyes.
“Guess he was still hungry,” Castiel chuckled, still rocking his boy.
“I’ll have and small rum and raisin and can Dean have a small chocolate chip please.”
“It’s good though Cas, it means he’s happy,” Gabriel wrapped his arm around Castiel’s shoulders. “That means he’s happy being with you.”
“Hey baby,” Castiel smiled when he felt Dean’s fingers, “How’s my special boy feeling?”
Looking back up, he sees Dr Bailey come back with a tray of syringes.
Feeling his cheeks warm, Dean buried his face into Gabriel neck. He didn’t like them all looking at him.
“Hey the Lincoln was a good car,” Castiel specks up, looking a bit offended.
“I’m joking Daddy, I have two Disney movies here,” Gabriel held up two dvd boxes. “What one do you want to watch Deano? We had Lion King or Beauty and the Beast. Daddy is the star of the last one,” Gabriel smirked at his brother.
Nodding his head Dean hummed before turning his head into his Daddy. Gabriel scoffed. The kid was so going to be a Daddy’s boy, he couldn’t believe this was the same boy he met the night before. It seemed Dean was made for being a baby.
“You’re a messy boy,” he whispered, chuckling to himself when he sees Dean quickly glance up at him before turning back to his show. “Sorry baby, Daddy’s interrupting your cartoon.”
“Does Michael know?” Hannah asked.
It wasn’t a dream, he thought, as he looked around in excitement.
Castiel eye’s widened, “Yeah...the demand for adult babies was getting to high so the government decided to offer people who were going to jail an alternative sentence, to live as an adult baby/child or go to prison. I heard it didn’t work so well.”
“What is it?” he asked, taking the file from her. Reading it through he couldn’t stop the sigh leaving his throat. “Castiel has adopted a little with the help of Gabriel.”
Dean wasn’t listening to their conversation, he was too busy enjoying poking his fingers into the melted ice cream, Feeling his Daddy hugging him, Dean looked up with his fingers in his mouth. To him, Daddy looked scared. What could have upset his daddy? He didn’t like seeing his daddy sad, maybe he should do something to cheer him up. Sighing to himself, Dean looked down at his bowl. Smiling, he placed his sticky hand into the brown cream. Holding his hand up, he placed his fingers over his Daddy’s lips.
Standing up with Dean, Gabriel followed Castiel. Taking a seat in Castiel’s recliner he got himself and Dean comfortable before holding the bottle to Dean’s lips.
“Yes Sammy?”
“Nothing’s wrong. It’s about my Little, his name is Sam, he’s...he’s Dean’s little brother.”
Laying Dean down on the changing table, both Castiel and Michael winced when Dean started to scream.
“Did you see Michael?”
Michael didn’t say anything, he knew that he couldn’t defend himself and he really didn’t want to. “We had better get inside and find Cas’s boy,” he said, not thinking he could feel any lower.
“I did,” Gabriel laughed, “I don’t mean that, I mean his diaper smells. You need to change your baby. I’ll grab the changing stuff.”
Sticking his tongue out at his brother again, Gabriel saw Sam smirking behind his pacifier.
Sam looked up at Gabriel in shock, how could he know that he had a brother. “Yeah...”
“Baby boy, please it’s me, your favourite Uncle. Come on Deano.”
Feeling a tap on his chin, Castiel looked down to see two big tried green eyes looking up at him. Seeing Dean staring up at him upside down with his bottle hanging between his teeth, Castiel chuckled to himself thinking how cute his baby was, “Okay baby, finish your bottle. Daddy will sing.”
“Oh no you don't. You can’t laugh at your Daddy,” Dean sniggered into the pillow next to him.
“Meh… I see it as a win-win thing. The homeless get a home and the Mommies and Daddies get their babies. Can’t complain really. Right, let’s go get your baby boy.” Gabriel stretched his arm around Castiel’s shoulders. Castiel relaxed into his brother. Maybe what Gabriel said was right, this would be a good thing for Dean.
“Stop pretending, where is he Michael?”
“You can’t be serious Casey. The boy had a tantrum because you stopped him watching tv and then threw his lunch on the floor, if he was my boy he would….”
“Hey Honey, you okay? Can’t you sleep?” she asked, glancing back at Castiel, who was still staring into space. He hadn’t notice Charlie come in to the room.
“Now if I so much as hear a peep out of you, I will not hesitate to remove your diaper and spank you on your bare bottom, do you understand?” she said, pointing her finger in his face looking at Dean dead in the eye.
Pulling back the covers he climbed out of the bed. Looking back at the bed he found his pacifier on one of the pillows. Picking it up he put it into his mouth, and sucking it he started to feel calmer.
“Your humour is turning into Gabriel’s, I won’t hesitate to put you in the corner Angel.” standing from the rocking chair, Michael stood with Dean in his arms. “I think your Daddy is being too bold, what do you think Dean, stall I put him into the corner.”
Feeling tears in his eyes Dean held up his hand, touching the top of Sam’s head, Dean combed his fingers through Sam’s soft brown hair. “Sammy...orry..”
“Baby’s pancakes are on the table Cas, still doing ours,” Gabriel said, not looking away from the pan.
Dean lifted his head in shock. Was it Michael’s fault he was taken away from his Daddy? Feeling a tap on his check, he turned to see Gabriel shaking his head at him.
“Daddy, who that?” he asked, pointing at the bee, forgetting his Daddy’s question.
Nodding, Dean brought his hand up to take hold of Castiel’s that was stroking his cheek.
Dean sighed when he tasted the warm vanilla milk, sucking greedily he enjoyed the warmth of his belly being full.
“Who told you that?” Gabriel asked kneeing down in front of his baby.
Looking up Dean saw his Daddy. When had he come in? Castiel was smiling down at him, leaning his head in his hand against the top of the crib.
“Good boy Deany, get all the air out. We don’t want an upset tummy do we? No we don’t,” Dean let out one big burp before Castiel stopped.
at how happy the little boy was with his finds. Without saying a word Gabriel took the clothes to check they were the right size and placed them with the rest.
Smiling, Castiel kissed his forehead, “As you wish baby, Daddy’ll sing for you, let’s go get changed and comfy in bed first. I think you can say with me tonight,” Castiel whispered, really meaning every night, he wasn’t letting Dean out of his sight ever again.
Walking into the mall the sound of people suddenly surrounded them, making Dean sink into his seat. Anxiously, he kept his eyes on Castiel, who smiled down at him.
The following week, Castiel meets his brother at his office to tell Gabriel about what he had seen.
Standing up, he moved over to the examination table. Laying Dean down, Castiel stood, combing his fingers through Dean’s blonde hair.
“..Dada?..” he cried, looking around, but his Daddy wasn’t here.
Dean looked at Castiel. No one had ever talked to him the way Castiel does, everything the man has said and done so far had be kind and gentle. Maybe he really did care.
Castiel felt like Michael wasn’t the same person that he had grown up with, he use to really look up to his big brother. But now he just didn’t know how he felt about him anymore.
“Uncle Cas...Uncle Cas!”
Dean groaned when he felt Dr Bailey start to feel up his legs and belly, he didn’t like the feeling of her cold hands roughly pulling at his body.
After Sam’s nap, Daddy had got a phone call from his brother. Dean’s Daddy, Castiel, had said it was okay to come over.
“Oh Baba, he’s so happy.” Seeing his baby smile, Gabriel grinned, patted Sam’s diaper he noticed it was very wet. “Sammy, why didn’t you say you were wet?”
Castiel’s heart sank. His dream wasn’t doing to happen.
Stroking his fingers along Dean’s spine, Castiel smiled when he felt Dean’s skin shiver under his fingertips. Dean hummed at his touch, it felt nice having his back stroked by Daddy’s soft hand.
Walking around the toddler aisles all three picked up toys that looked fun. Picking up large blocks like the ones Dean had Gabriel placed them into the cart, he could just see his and Castiel’s little boys happily playing with them together.
But it didn’t matter.
Dean did so too, following his brother to the door, where Sam leaned in close, whispering: “How? How is he back? What happened?”
"I, I don't know. When I said to you, you know, and you said it's like family, I thought-"
“Wow”, he whispered, his eyes taking in the surroundings of the little house he had found one day wandering through heaven, the one that was so perfectly
again, with Cas by his side.
there even was a meaning to it. Or what they would do next, about the two of them but also about Chuck, the empty, the world.
him, burned his heart right out of him to leave behind nothing but ashes.
"Cas. Castiel. Can I kiss you?"
“Would you like it to be colder?”, the angel asked, and Dean was unsure if he ever had seen something as.. as
And he had thought a lot about it, about the best way to do this, about all the big words that Cas certainly deserved. But here, sitting together with Cas in his own bed, blue eyes bright and hair sleep tousled; his back hurting from a night of sitting against the wall and his feet cold after giving Cas the good blanket, Dean thought about how he couldn’t think of a more beautiful way to wake up. And about how there was no time to lose, not when things finally felt
In his love’s arms, Dean slowly found himself calming down, and, later, they sat down on the ground, opposite the two women. Dean told Cas what had happened, the angel’s fingers holding his tightly; he felt the barely constrained rage rolling off Cas like static at every mention of John, and he loved him even more for it.
“Cas?”, he asked, carefully lowering both of them to the floor, until Cas was cradled safely in his arms, his face looking up at Dean, eyes closed.
Instead of an answer, Cas only shook his head, and before Dean could further investigate, Sam was there, so together, they helped Cas out of his trench coat. The back of it was drenched in blood, and Dean swore to himself that he’d do whatever he could to get those stains out, so Cas could once again wear it, feel at home in it. His fingers slightly trembled as he buttoned open Cas’ shirt, gently ushered him to turn around. Sam then cleaned up Cas’ back, careful and yet unable to avoid causing the angel to flinch, Dean having to bite his teeth together, hard.
“Hello”, and Cas’ hand brushed Dean’s on top of the blankets, his fingers warm, and there, and alive, Dean’s brain still singing in joy faced with that.
When their eyes met, a smile played around Cas’ lips, and it was tired, barely there, but Dean never had seen something as beautiful. The anxiety still was there, in the back of his mind – about Chuck, Cas’ wounds, everything. But it was overshadowed, or rather overlighted; the darkness not standing a chance against the brightness of Cas’ smile.
“But, why?”
"Dean, listen to me-"
, and with that, all of the anger left Dean, as his voice broke on one syllable.
"Please, don't-"
Dean was unsure of what to do, to
“I’m sorry”, Dean whispered, and he knew that it wasn’t enough, but all other words seemed to have left him.
Cas shook his head, and Dean felt the ground slip away from beneath his feet.
in his stomach, he’d blush when Cas leaned over to place the hint of a kiss on his cheek, and his arm around Cas’ shoulders felt just
And there was something in the back of Dean’s head. A nagging feeling, the conviction that he should recognize them. But he didn’t. He just looked at the two women, shocked at the expression they were watching him with. Caution, distrust, and, somewhere underneath that,
"Dean?", Cas’ blue eyes were widened in even more confusion, and that just managed to make Dean angrier. As if Cas wouldn't know exactly what he was talking about. As if he wouldn't know exactly that those three words he had said had totally tilted Dean's world off its axis.
. As if it belonged there. And somewhere, deep in his heart, Dean knew that it did.
angel, did understand. So, they took it slow. Slower than Dean ever had gone about such a thing (though, if he was honest with himself, no former relationship ever could compare to what he shared with Cas), and it was wonderful. Every time Cas took his hand, Dean got this warm feeling of
"That you don't remember."
“I would, yeah.”
It was a short first kiss, no tongue or wandering hands involved, and yet, Dean couldn’t remember a single meeting of lips ever leaving him as breathless. And, judged by his nervous little laugh, Cas wasn’t feeling much different. Dean leaned his forehead against his angel’s, and slid an arm around his hip, as if they were about to dance. But he just held him close, Cas’ own hands linking behind Dean’s head, his fingers settling in still slightly wet hair.
"Dean Winchester.
And Dean understood it oh so well, how Cas had felt his true happiness.
“You’re most welcome, Dean”, Cas answered, his eyes still fixed on Dean’s lips.
In that moment, when Cas softly sighed into their kiss, nothing else mattered. For Cas was here, in Dean’s arms, where he belonged.
The deal, of course. I get it now.”
Cas leaned over to kiss Dean, and in his mind, he heard Cas’ voice.
Meeting Christopher had been a nice surprise, and when Dean walked on the unfamiliar path in the rain, he wondered what heaven might have in stock for him today. He rounded a few trees and then ended up on the edge of a deep yellow corn field, illuminated by a bright autumn sun. Dean walked further, and when he stepped onto the field, he spotted a rainbow in the distance. With a smile on his face, he continued his way, and finally, he saw two human shapes in the field, sitting down, maybe for a picnic. He walked towards them, curious to see meet another old friend again, but as soon as the first person, a young woman he now saw, raised her head, spotted him, her eyes widened, and very much not in joy. The woman pulled her companion, a tall lady with short dark hair, to her feet, and both of them stared at Dean.
He had driven to the church John had sent him to; the bracelet Sammy had given him early in the morning, before their father had been awake, safely hidden inside of his jacket. Had overheard a conversation between two of the nuns currently living in the convent, about how terrible the priest dying under mysterious circumstances had been as a person. Had searched for their grave, dug up bones from the dirty ground behind the kitchen, not even a gravestone anywhere close. His hands had started bleeding, and he hadn’t cared, rather the opposite – had welcomed the pain, focused on it, because it was easier to focus on his burning skin than the confusion, the lingering fear in his mind, the pain in his heart. He had caught a quick glimpse at them, right before setting their bones on fire, and he wondered that if he had been braver, he might have said something. But he didn’t, just flipped the lighter, and the two women had gone up in flames, their screams bursting through Dean’s soul. He hadn’t cried, because he never did, never allowed himself to; but when he dug up a little hole underneath an apple tree, cursing at the frozen ground, and carefully put the picture his father had given him inside, touching it as if it might shatter every moment, he had felt a sob inside his throat.
“I love you”, Dean said, in a low voice and yet with all of his heart in it, “Cas, I love you, I love you, I love you so much.”
But when the woman extended her hand, lightly placing it on Dean’s shoulder, he knew that she understood. Maybe it was another magical aspect of heaven, that sometimes, when you really wanted someone to know something, they just
“I, I don’t know. He didn’t say anything, and his back, that’s like, where his wings should be, but I don’t- I have no idea. But, he’s back. Cas is
And then, Cas’ voice continued talking, and Dean’s entire being focused on one task.
In the distance, Dean could see snow-covered mountain tops that he couldn’t remember ever seeing before, but while they were beautiful to watch, he felt something like a gentle pull, an instinct that told him to not go towards the mountains but to take a road to his right instead. He did so, remembering how the last time he had been this far away from home, he had met a man who turned out to have been a former classmate, from one of the few times Dean had visited a school. The boy, Chris, had taught Dean the basics of how to play chess, and he, now going by Christopher, lived in a cabin close to the sea, a bright smile on his face once he recognized Dean. Christopher had told Dean about the car accident that caused him to end up here, but more so about his two daughters, his wife, how much he loved them, how proud he was of them. How he sometimes caught a glimpse of what they were doing on earth in the waves, or a hint of his wife’s eyes in the sky. At which Dean had just smiled knowingly.
“I didn’t want this, I didn’t-“, and his voice broke on another sob before he could explain more.
"And what if it isn't?"
The taller woman took another step forward, finally crouched down in front of Dean, and he found that he couldn’t meet her eyes, couldn’t bear to look at her.
After Dean had ended his story, Cas’ wrapped a protective arm around his shoulders, and his voice was steel when he spoke.
Ever since that day, the weather had changed every week or so (getting a feeling of time still was difficult here), and Dean found it exciting. Just a few days ago, Jack had visited them, the three of them curling up in front of the fireplace while the fog outside was so thick that one couldn’t even see as far as to the lake from their living room window, then there had been a warm summer day, when Dean went swimming with Charlie and later taught Cas how to make the best ice-cold milkshakes, and today, it was raining.
"You said you loved me. You said it, like, like, as if you would,
. And that, that was the expression that Dean had dreamed of. That he had feared to never experience, had expected to see earlier that morning, and that he now knew he’d never let go again.
“Maybe it would be better to get him somewhere..”, he trailed off, but Dean got him. The cold floor right behind the bunker’s door certainly wasn’t the best place for anyone, especially not his angel, and least of all when he was hurt.
"Something?", the hope in Dean's chest cut deeper than the fear earlier had.
"Dean, please. I don't know what you are talking about."
Dean found no time to answer, since Cas’ lips already were on his again, but when Dean let his tongue glide over the angel’s bottom lip, when he buried a hand in Cas’ soft hair while the other pressed their hips closer together, and when the closer contact caused him to moan into the kiss, it all screamed
Jack never had explained how it was working, but whenever Dean could see Sam’s smile in the corner of a mirror, heard Eileen’s laugh at one of his brother’s bad jokes in the wind, he knew that it was his son’s doing. And it was wonderful.
“I’m here. I’m hurt, can you let me in?”
“I could feel that you’re in distress, and I-“
"Cas-"
, in the way that they had hugged long before Dean had understood what it meant, the way that letting Cas step back from his arms seemed to physically hurt.
