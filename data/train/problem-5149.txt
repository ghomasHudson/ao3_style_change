“Yeah, Tony?” he asked, not even slightly out of breath from sprinting over. God—Tony really envied that serum sometimes.
“Knowing Pepper, she’s probably already on it,” Rhodey said. “But I’ll text her just in case—yup she’s on it.”
“It’s clear he’s hurting—he’s put all of this on his own shoulders, like he always does, because he thinks everything is his responsibility. Despite what Pepper told us, he’s blaming himself anyway, and drinking himself into a pit in the process,” Nat explained.
Tony took a step forward, now crowding into Steve’s personal space, and looking into his eyes defiantly. Steve swallowed so hard that his adam’s apple violently bobbed and Tony’s smirk grew.
Despite the recent quiet, it came as no shock to Tony when the following headline was plastered across every platform possible:
“I know, I’m sorry—I just really like kissing you. I’ve been wanting to do it for over a decade. It’s hard to stop now that I can,” Steve replied, sheepishly looking away as he blushed—which only made Tony grin like a fool.
Tony paced his room, shucking off his suit jacket and undoing his cufflinks, on edge about something. Steve felt guilty—had he overstepped? Had he upset Tony? That would be just his luck.
The thing they had been tiptoeing around was finally happening and it was entirely consuming Tony. He was lost in the feeling of Steve’s hard muscles against his body, the smell of his shampoo, his firm hands on his hips, and the skill of his tongue. The sensation overload was intoxicating—better than any alcoholic drink he ever had. And it was in that instant, Tony realized this was the happiest he had been in a very long time. He was euphoric. Steve’s lips against his lit up his nervous system and set his skin on fire. Their bodies moving against one another—this closeness, the shattering of the wall that stood between them—ignited a passion inside Tony’s chest that he thought long gone.
With his heart caught in his throat, Tony stuttered out, “I-I believe there’s a Christmas party we are meant to be partaking in?”
Without thinking, Steve let himself into Bucky’s room without knocking and he was greeted with his friend having sexual relations with Natasha.
Tony’s mind short-circuited for a second as he realized this was happening—finally, happening—but then he realized he was being kissed but not kissing back and that had to change. He swept his tongue across Steve’s bottom lip, which earned a surprised noise from the back of Steve’s throat, and Tony took the opportunity to nudge his tongue into his mouth. Steve gave pleased, deep moan and Tony couldn’t handle it any longer—he pushed Steve up against the wall and pressed their bodies together.
As he listened to Rhodey’s explanation he couldn’t deny the accuracy of it all. He supposed Rhodey was his best friend for a reason—their deep understanding of one another had led to a bond forged in compassion and loyalty. Throughout the years, even when he had no one he had Rhodey. He was lucky to have Rhodey at his side during his happiest moments and holding him through his worst. One memory in particular was nagging at the peripheral of his mind now.
“God—do I need to get laid that badly?” he wondered out loud to himself. Tony stared at his reflection and silently acknowledged it was not that simple.
“You’re a good friend, Nat. They’d be lost without you—not just for this, for everything,” Bucky said, leaning across the mattress and holding her hand in his.
“I’m not really worried about the news story,” she replied. “I’m worried about how Tony is going to handle this. He was unusually shaken up about it.”
Tony smiled weakly and took the paper towels, wiping his face clean before tossing it in the trash can a few feet away.
“Oh that’s really fucking bad timing Ty. You’re a real class act, you know that?” Tony snapped. “That was anything but smooth.”
“Steve! You’re late!” Tony shouted over the sound of the drill he was using. “You’re usually here hours ago.”
“Anyway Thor—does that answer your question? About my mother?” Tony snapped, yanking his arm away from Rhodey before storming out of the room.
Tony was a kind man, a generous friend, and a hero that used every ounce of who he was to make the world a better place. Steve had witnessed Tony in some of his worst moments—they had gone toe-to-toe and nearly killed one another—and he could still say with confidence that there was not a better person in the universe. Tony Stark was Earth’s best defender—whose altruism rivaled Steve’s own—and the last thing he deserved was this horrific news story to drag him back down into the pits of depression.
Or maybe it was not quite that, but that his concept of a family, a partnership—life entirely—had evolved. The Avengers had been his family for a long time now. And a white picket fence was no longer his ideal, but the Avengers compound had become the place he was happiest.
Steve sat in silence—taking in Tony’s words and mulling them over. God—how wrong he had been about Tony when he first met him. And apparently that was not a rare phenomenon—assuming the worst of Tony Stark. He knew people made the argument that Tony’s recklessness as a young adult was reason enough to dislike him now, but that was bullshit. And flat out unfair.
“No really—you know I’m not good at these things. But it has been all over the news. I wanted to check in—see if you were—you know, okay,” Tiberius fumbled. “I care. I’ve always cared, Tony.”
“Steve,” Nat said, breaking him out of his thoughts. She had just come into the infirmary room and was walking over. Something told Steve she had been watching him for a few minutes. The worried look on her face was telling for a super spy that endeavored not to wear her feelings on her sleeve.
Steve walked around her desk and stormed right into the office without another second of hesitation.
What came out of his mouth, “We should start spending more time together. Y-you know, uh, like we used to. Before…”
He needed to apologize. He knew that—hell, he wanted to apologize. But he was unusually nervous to do it.
“You should always dress nice for a date, Steve. That doesn’t mean anything,” she said. “Will you feel better if I help you pick out an outfit?”
A shaky hand cupped the back of his neck and he lets out a tiny whine of protest as Steve pulls away. But Steve keeps his face close, resting his forehead against Tony’s, panting desperately for oxygen. His baby blue eyes are alive with arousal and looking down at Tony through his exquisite eyelashes. Seriously—did Captain America wear mascara?
Steve collapsed to his knees, arms wrapping around Tony’s waist, and leaning his head against his stomach. After taking a few shuddering breaths, Steve moved up just enough to kiss Tony’s chest where the Arc Reactor had been.
“Tony needs medical attention—NOW!” Steve cried out over the comms. He dropped his shield and applied pressure to the wound, guilt seizing him as Tony sobbed in pain from the touch. Guilt suffocating him as he increasingly felt more and more responsible for Tony’s injury.
He parked right in front of the building, not bothering to put anything in the meter—he was not going to be long.
Nat could read his self-loathing a mile away. It was a devastating feeling that she was too familiar with herself. Her heart broke to see Tony like this—one of the most admirable, kind, and brilliant men she had ever met—so deep in a pit of self-hatred.
Part of him yearned for the days when everything wasn’t so serious—before Afghanistan, before learning of Obie’s betrayal, before the Avengers. He knew it was morally reprehensible to feel this way. He knew the person he used to be was selfish, often cruel, and reckless. But he couldn’t help but desire for things to be easy again. He just wanted a break—who could blame him? Was that wrong?
“You should go to bed,” Nat said, nudging him off of her and into a sitting position. “I know Bucky and I are on our way out soon. And Bruce already went to bed.”
“Tony,” Rhodey chimed in this time. He stood and grabbed his friend gently, one hand on his shoulder and the other on his elbow. “Tony, that’s in the past.”
“If you were going for a run you could have let me know,” Sam’s voice carried from behind him. Steve turned around and gave him an apologetic smile.
“Listen, Rhodey Bear. I drew Steve’s name,” Tony whined. He picked up a tennis ball and started tossing it against the wall—unable to stay still.
Nat narrowed her eyes, arms crossed, and observed the scene before her. The first time she meant Tiberius she had warned Tony that he was a user and manipulator and that he should cut him off immediately. Obviously, that had not gone well. That was not the sort of advice Tony had been looking for from his secretary at the time. When Tony chose Pepper, Nat had celebrated the removal of Ty from Tony’s life and had hoped to never see him again.
Steve closed his eyes—trying to locate the exact moment that he realized his feelings for the one and only Tony Stark. God—how did this happen?
“Uh—who with?” Tony continued, fearful of going down this path, but if Steve didn’t enjoy the date, then what was the harm?
“What! No—that’s not what I was saying,” Tony balked, looking horrified with wide eyes and reaching out to hold onto Steve’s arms.
“Thank you,” he said. “That’s not an easy thing to say. Or easy things to admit—especially not to the guy who killed your parents and then tried to kill you.”
Steve rushed across the room and slowed down right as he reached the door, a feeble attempt to regain his composure, as he opened it.
She was surprised no one else noticed the significant increase in the touching between the two men. Or, if they did, they were staying alarmingly silent about it. The Avengers team were well known for gossiping among each other. The radio silence about the obvious touchy feely interactions between Steve and Tony must have meant only she had noticed. It was likely everyone had expected this to happen ages ago—because honestly there was a running bet between the Avengers about when, how, and who would initiate between the two—that the new touching felt natural.
The sound of Steve and Bucky’s laughter filled the room. Tony looked to see they had knocked each other on the ground and were giggling like children about it. The jealousy monster started wringing his stomach again.
“What do you mean?” Thor asked, looking at Steve and then Tony, both of whom were sporting vibrant blushes on their cheeks.
“Come on Tony—you already know I know. I’ve been in the same room as you two—anyone who has knows,” Peter replied, wearing Tony’s shit eating grin with an alarming accuracy. He took another mouthful of pancakes.
“Oohhh—yes!” Morgan said, jumping out of Pepper’s arms and rushing out to be with Nat—who was apparently just outside which meant Pepper came here to talk more than she did to check in on how he was doing. Tony’s heart sank.
She got up, unceremoniously dropping a nicely wrapped package in Sam’s lap with a smirk on her face. He unwrapped it to reveal an Ella Fitzgerald ‘Best Hits’ vinyl record—his face lit up.
What had started out innocent was now surprisingly intense, fueled by years of neglected passion and need.
Tony choked back tears. There were more minutes of long silence. But he composed himself—Natasha saw a switch click inside of him—and he turned fully towards her with a serious look on his face.
“I’m just saying,” she continued. “You love each other. You’re all in this, Tony’s all in this. Hell, you two have both been wanting this for years—you’re going to be okay. Besides, what honestly would happen? He takes you to a fancy dinner and you pick up the wrong fork and he leaves you? Steve, you are not nearly as incompetent as you think you are and Tony is not at all judgmental like you’re freaking yourself out to believe he is—and you know he isn’t. You know he’s actually the most chill person on this team, at times.”
Steve’s eyes were stuck staring at Tony’s lips as he talked. There was a warmth in the pit of his stomach that was not there earlier. His body was leaning in towards Tony’s—as if his friend had some sort of magnet the was drawing him in.
“Uh—no, no, I’m good Spangles, thanks,” Tony stuttered, being ripped out of his wildly inappropriate thoughts and crashing back into reality. He was too busy mentally cursing himself for allowing his mind to go there to properly respond when Steve said goodnight and left.
“I don’t know Tony,” Peter replied. “Me and M.J. are doing really well. I think I might be a pro at this dating stuff.”
Steve was off in the distance holding Morgan by the hands and spinning her around in circles. Tony and Peter could hear her giggles and his laughter all the way across the park they were having a picnic in.
“Funny thing is, this means you've always known how I was going to die. All the time we've been together, you knew I was coming here. The last time I saw you - the real you, the future you, I mean - you turned up on our doorstep with a new haircut and a suit. You took me to SHIELD’s Helicarrier to see the New York skyline. Oh, what a night that was. The city was safe… and you cried.”
If Tony was being honest, it had been one of the hardest things he’d ever experience. Seeing the man he loved not recognize him hurt something deep within him. This Steve Rogers didn’t trust Tony very much and had only allowed Tony to join the Commandos because he’d been ordered to.
Three days later he was sitting in Tony's office at the San Francisco mansion with Matt Murdock going over the last details of the divorce. Right at that moment Matt was saying something about one of the sections in the divorce, but Steve wasn't really paying attention to what the lawyer was saying, instead concentrating on looking at Tony. Memorizing each of his features as if this was the last time he would ever see him.
Tony had been mad and demanded he stay, to which Steve had refused, it was his duty as a defender of humanity to be there when necessary. Tony had been able to leave his life as an Avenger behind, but not him. He had a duty to fulfill and he would do it, he couldn't let down those who believed in him.
"I think that's my line," Steve glowered back. Tony scoffed and shook his head, he unsteadily got to his feet. He took off the watch in his hand, threw it at Steve's chest and stumbled to his jacket.
It was true that it made him a bit restless to leave his life as a superhero and a protector of humanity behind, but now he had what he'd dreamed of as a kid, a family, and for him there was nothing more important
"Don't make this more difficult, please. I will call you in a few days for you to sign the documents. Now please, go."
“Jesus Christ Steve! I get it, I am a stranger and you don’t trust me, but why would I want to blow this us all up? Please! Leave and let me deal with this bomb.”
"It's not that love, is just..." he abruptly stopped once he realized what had come out of his mouth.
For a moment Tony said nothing, making Steve's heart skip a couple of beats at the uncertainty, until Tony nodded with a slow and small movement of his head. Steve smiled wildly and leaned his face against Tony's to press a kiss to his lips.
"I've got it." Steve interrupted. "Just add my Americano to his tab and I'll pay for it. Throw in a couple of muffins too please." Tony had turned around and Steve had been charmed by large brown eyes.
"It means I know everything." Steve glared at the young man and his heart broke as he saw all color leave Tony's face. "It means I know that Tony Carbonell doesn't really work for Stark Industries."
"So what is it that I've done according to you and your friends? I think I have a right to know the charges against me, don't you?"
"Yes, well... that doesn't matter anymore. Let's talk about what's going on right now. If you don't want half of my money let's settle on a sum. How about 20 million? it's a relatively small amount s...."
"You could help me save this entire universe from itself, and then you would be the most powerful man in the universe. Join us Stark"
"Tony? Guys," he felt his jaw clench, "I thought we had already finished these conversations. I appreciate it, truly, but Tony and I are happy. And I know you mean well but I am getting really tired of having to defend my relationship to you guys."
"But you don't have to give me anything, Tony. I don't want you to pay me for being married to you."
"And what exactly is it that your friends have been saying about me all this time Steve?" Tony's voice was hollow, tears were silently streaming down his face. Steve ached to clean them off.
“Is not a matter of trust, I need to stop this, and I am a lot more durable than anyone else. Now get out.”
"I had hoped you would see reason," he walked towards the medical equipment in the room, "perhaps a little reminder of what Earth has repaid your loyalty with will help."
He stalked to his balcony, box fisted in his hand ready to throw it out the goddamn window, only to freeze at the last minute. His shoulders dropped, the tightness in his chest grew and before he knew it he was balled out on the floor, crying in grief. Grief over the loss of his dream, of the relationship that had brought him back to life. Of life without Tony. He sat there for hours, ring still clutched in his hand.
"Will anything I say even matter to you." Tony's voice was hollow, "it seems to me like you've already created this picture of me in your head." Steve turned to stare at him, Tony didn't meet his gaze.
He was crying again, Steve fought to keep his anger in his face, unable to stop the stupid twisting in his chest at the sight.
By the time Steve began waking up again, Tony had already hooked up the  gun and the arc reactor in his chest to the bomb and pulled out his phone.
He could hear a faint beeping coming from the his left side, that he really wish would stop. He groaned and tried to shut whatever that was, but his hand was being held by another one. Slowly he tried to open his eyes and met a harsh bright ceiling. He blinked slowly and tried to get his thoughts in order. The last thing he remembered was…the Hydra base…Steve…the bomb…Steve…
"I have come for you Stark. Earth's Greatest Defender. When I first enslaved the Asgardian, I thought his task a simple one. After all this planet is quite primitive compared to others we've conquered before. Yet, you and your team managed to defeat my army." The titan walked closer to him, "Imagine my surprise at realizing that it hadn't been your Asgardian ally who'd laid waste to my ships and army, but a simple human. Fascinating. After that it was difficult not to pay attention. Time and time again, you defend it, and this is your reward" The titan waved a hand towards the pathetic picture Tony painted.
"I can't go on like this Steve. I know what being Captain America means to you, and I completely understand. I know the country and the world needs you, but I do too Steve. Do you not realize that? I am tired of being alone, of waiting every night for you to come back, of being constantly worried about you. I am basically raising our son by myself, he's so used to you not being here that he has stopped asking about you."
He picked up the phone again and stared at the background, stroking the screen with tears in his eyes as if he could could caress his two great loves. It was a picture of the three of them, where he and Tony where hugging Peter at his birthday party while he was crushed between them. He dialed Fury's number and was answered at the first tone.
He took another swig of the bottle and thought about the fact that the photo in his background was the last picture he had with his son, and he was about to turn 5. He had certainly been very absent.
"What do you want from me? From the looks of this ship, you have no need for my tech much less my money, so what do you want? Weapons? I'll die before I ever create another weapon of mass destruction!" The titan simply smiled and sat beside him. His two deadly looking daughters stood guard by the door.
His cellphone rang at that moment. With the bottle in one hand and his cellphone in the other he went towards his room taking large swallows of the drink. He threw himself on the bed and took the call, it was Fury.
"And it's not fair, it's not fair that my 4-year-old is used to his father's absence, I already went through that and I don't want that for my son. It's not fair that even though I am married I have to be a single dad, because that's what I am. I can't keep forgiving you doing the same thing my father did my whole life, getting wrapped up on his job and leaving my mother and I to the side, which is what I always swore not to do with my kids."
He let out a long and heavy sigh, Tony was probably mad at him. They hadn't been in good terms when Steve had left for his mission after just one day of being back from a 5 week mission. He was suppose to have taken a vacation to be with his family and not even twenty-four hours after being back home, he had already been preparing to leave again.
“Then how come I know your parents’ vows.” Steve paled further and Tony took his moment of hesitation to do what he needed to do.
When Tony came to again, everything was still cold and painful. He tried to move, but the suit was frozen and still dead, quiet honestly, Tony didn't know how he was still alive.
After that call he had been unable to call his husband until that same day when he was on his way back, he had called several times but had been unable to get an answer. Steve attributed it to being busy with his company meetings.
“Oh. You alright?” Steve turns to look at him, gray eyes stare back at him and Steve debates telling him everything. Because Tony had known his parent’s vows, and he had his dog tags and his father’s ring. The same ring that he knows is safe back in his room, just like he knows Bucky wears his dog tags and his mother’s ring hanging from his neck.
He woke the next day with a raging headache. He sent out an email that he'd be out of the office for the next couple of weeks and curled back in bed. He couldn't sleep, but he didn't really have the energy to do much else.
"Tell me my child, do you wish to forget? To bury all this pain and suffering. All the betrayal and abandonment?"
"What do you guys even do together? Besides have sex and go to expensive places that YOU pay for?" Clint had complained.
"I-," the short brunette blinked at him as he accepted his drink and was led out of the way by Steve, "thank you."
"Good idea," Steve said, "but let's talk payment first." Steve pulled out the ring box he'd been hiding in his sock drawer for the past month and flipped it open. "Will this suffice for the night?"
"No," interrupted Tony. He brusquely freed his hands from Steve's grip, "I made my decision and I won't change my mind."
He gasped. The hand holding his squeeze it. He turned to find Steve beside him a tearful smile in his face.
“They’re always unbearable. But at least I usually had Pepper at my side to make things less horrible. We’ve been broken up for a year and I doubt her new boyfriend would want her on my arm at such a public event,” Tony sighed.
"I don't care what the law says," he interrupted again, "if we both agree we can ignore it and not separate assets."
"Let's be honest here Steve, you are his sugar daddy, and there isn't anything wrong with that as long as you know that this isn't some fairytale story. For all you know, you might not be the only one." Natasha had told him.
So far it had been a pretty awkward affair. First he’d had to somehow prove that he was not a Nazi, meet his father - who just happened to be younger than Tony right now - and look into the eyes of Captain America before his 70 year long chilly nap. It took some time but he somehow managed to convince them that he was in fact from the future, but since the technology he needed to get back to his time doesn’t still exist he’s been traveling with Steve and his team in search of tech scraps to help him build his own time machine.
"Wow, I saw your presentation last week regarding the new line of prosthetics you were looking to add and how you wanted to make it available for Veterans. I was very impressed."
Like many of bad situations in his life, this was all Reed Richard’s fault. He had asked Tony to consult in a time traveling machine, and in an effort to avoid dinosaurs to attacking New York he’d agreed. All he’d seen was a flash of blue light and then he’d been standing in Nazi Germany during WWII where he’d been found by The Howling Commandoes.
“...9, 8, 7, 6…” Tony played with his phone, looking at the last pictures he had of him and his husband. Because that may be Steve tied to that pole, but HIS Steve, his husband, the love of his life, was 80 years in the future.
Steve took his time to learn every inch and curve of Tony’s body—as if he were trying to memorize it for later. Which he didn’t doubt, given Steve’s eidetic memory and artistic abilities. It left Tony feeling worshipped.
words from Tony, words he never thought he would hear—words he didn’t think he deserved—it sent him soaring. He did not even attempt to hold back the tears that welled up in his eyes. Before Tony knew it, he was being pulled up off the bed into a hug. He was rigid at first, but hearing Steve softly cry turned him into a sappy mess.
He immediately locked eyes on Tony and Pepper and fired a blast directly to their left. Tony knew it was not a warning shot, but poor aim due to the amount of power surging through Zeke’s suit.
Tony grunted in response and Pepper laughed at him, learning forward to kiss his cheek. “it will be okay.”
Thank you to everyone who is providing support and reading along as I work on this fic. I am truly pouring my heart out into it. Yes, this is a slow-burn, but I promise the pay off is worth it in the end. It doesn't feel right to rush Tony into anything since he is dealing with a divorce and a recovering alcoholic. I want Steve and Tony to naturally drift towards each other at a healthy pace. :) The next chapter is an intense one, so be ready...
“It’s okay Tones,” Rhodey replied. He reached over and patted Tony’s knee. “Sobriety is not always a linear journey. We understand. I don’t think any of us are angry with you. This stuff isn’t meant to be easy.”
“Yes, as I was saying,” Tony continued, picking up where he left off and doing his damnedest to act like nothing had happened. “I’ve been experiencing attraction to a certain individual who…is probably, likely, off-limits.”
The only sliver of hope he was holding onto was that, unlike his father, he never laid a hand on Pepper nor did he physically lash out on anything else. He supposed he should be grateful that their arguments were verbal and that was it.
It was not that simple. Steve knew from personal experience that no one could save a man who did not want saving. This reality did very little to tame his superhero complex.
Should he rat out the program or the person? Instead of saying either, he just kept his mouth shut and shrugged. Tony threw his hands up in the air in response before putting them on his hips and sighing. “I guess it doesn’t matter which one. But it was probably Rhodey—he’s seemed suspicious lately.”
"My friends did. They didn't trust you," he let out another dark chuckle, "turns out they were right not to."
Matt picked up the divorce papers scattered across the room, proving effectively that they'd forgotten he was there, left the room smiling, happy that his serviced hadn't been needed.
"Patience daughter, I have plans for Stark." A deep voice responded. The two women walked into the sliver of light that managed to get into his cold dark tomb. He finally laid eyes on them and his breathing grew harsher. The two women were not...human. They were humanoid, but one of them was blue, and her body was littered with mechanic enhancements, the other was completely green with deep burgundy hair. The two of them exuded murderous vibes. The kind that Tony usually only got from Natasha and Pepper. He drew in a harsh breath and tried once more to get up from the cold floor he'd been planing to die in.
"I don't enjoy being made a fool." The brunette scoffed and turned to face him, a furious and anguished look in his face.
"His previous relationships were with Tiberius Stone, CEO of Viastone, and Sunset Bain, CEO of Baintronics. His friends, wealthy heirs Janet & Hope Van Dyne, Loki & Thor Odinson. He clearly surrounds himself with people who can provide him a certain lifestyle."
"Of course you can, take all the time you need. I told you I wouldn't take that from you and you can see him as often and as long as you want."
This time Steve had promised Tony to take a break from work for awhile, and he was completely serious. He had already informed Fury and the team of his coming absence and had made sure to leave Clint and Tasha in charge of the Avengers while he was gone.
"Why are his friends worrisome?" Steve croaked, eyes glued to the countless pictures in his desk, Tony at expensive boutiques, expensive restaurants, in a perfectly tailored suit next to Howard Stark, champagne glass in hand.
It was hard to miss the loving looks exchanged by Steve and Barnes, the way the two of them just gravitated towards each other, the way that Barnes looked as if Steve had hung the moon and stars and the way Steve would burn the world for Bucky Barnes.
"Here is your fucking car keys, your stupid penthouse keys, and your goddamn credit card," he said as he threw each thing at Steve, "gifts that I didn't even fucking ask for you asshole. Keep your money, your stuff, and tomorrow morning I'll send you a reimbursement for everything you paid me for."
And like Tony had told him, he would keep full custody of Peter while he was entitled to all the visits he wanted, but would be unable to appeal for joint custody. Not that he thought about doing that anyway, Tony was was right in saying that his job as an Avenger forbade that possibility.
"I admire your bravery and tenacity Anthony, you would do well in my order and when I have achieved perfect balance in this entire universe I wish to retire, but I must leave someone in charge. I think you would do well."
"I still think you could do better," Tony said with a slight smirk,"look into brain receptors and make the prosthetics work more like an arm. I actually had some ideas I'd be more than willing to pass on."
“Thank you,” he whispered. And in an attempt to save himself some face and change the subject, “What are you watching?”
“Tony, it’s going to be okay. Steve’s stronger than you’re giving him credit for. You know he doesn’t care about those things. He would only care if they hurt you or someone else. But like you said, the headlines don’t bother you anymore.”
Their bantering earned another laugh from Steve. They had finally settled back into the comfort of their friendship—now relationship—and the nervousness had melted away. This was easy—it felt right and it was fun, the way they teased each other with nothing but deep love.
But he couldn’t help it, because suddenly the thing that had been so important was real and he was terrified he was going to screw it up.
He went into the bathroom, brushed his teeth, and washed his face. When he caught his own eyes in the mirror he froze.
It made something coil tightly low in his belly—a new, fluttering feeling that was stronger than anything he had ever felt before—it was immediately addicting. God—he loved him.
“Because a date with the very rich, incredibly suave, and extravagant Tony Stark is intimidating? I mean honestly Buck—my go to dates are picnics in Central Park, Netflix marathons at home, and cozy dates in little hole in the wall restaurants in Brooklyn.”
Tony got sucked into the Triwizard Tournament and the perils of Harry’s adventure. He was so engrossed that he did not hear Steve come up behind the couch and lean forward on the back of it.
“Of course. Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” he replied, scowling at Steve when Morgan leapt out of his arms to go tell Peter the good news. Steve burst into roaring laughter when he saw Tony’s face.
Holding back tears Steve headed to the backyard of the house, where Peter was playing with his little friend Wade. Luckily, it didn't seem like he'd heard their conversation.
With his back against the wall, he slumped down until he was sitting on the floor. He covered his face with his hands and cried, in a way he hadn't done so in years, hating himself for being such a terrible husband.
Tony had found himself in a number of different difficult situations before, but this one took the cake.
Tears fell out of his eyes as he fell back to the floor. Steve had left. He'd taken Barnes and walked right out, without sparing a second thought for Tony. After he and Pepper had broken up Tony had resigned himself to being alone for the rest of his life. Then Steve had kissed him and all of the sudden Tony had been in love again. They'd still fought but Tony had learned to see Steve's side of things and to explain his side of things to Steve. Tony had been sure that this was it. He'd fallen hard and fast for Steve.
Matt watched the fight between the couple. At this point, the both of them were practically screaming and he was completely sure that that they'd forgotten he was in the room with them.
"Steve Rogers." Steve accepted the handshake, he had soft hands and yet his hands were also marred with callouses.
Tony couldn't help his scream at the pain his head was under. As he trashed he thought he saw pitying looks come from the two women by the door.
"That all you were after is my money." Steve walked over the shorter man, pulled him into his arms,  "you know, if I wasn't paying enough for exclusivity all you had to do was tell me."
"Steve?" Large brown eyes stared at him confusedly. The penthouse was torn apart, clothes ripped apart, jewelry thrown on the ground.
And even though his marriage was going through some hard times cause of him, he never expected to come home to a dark, cold and completely empty house.
Sitting in a couch in his old apartment in Brooklyn and with the divorce papers in hand, he wondered at what point his life had gone overboard.
"Look Stevie, you can be mad all you want, but we were just looking out for you, and it looks like we were right to be."
They had talked very briefly on the phone during the 7 weeks that the mission had lasted, mostly because Steve had no time for anything else, but Steve notice as Tony's voice grew more and more distant with each call and Steve feared losing his husband.
"I won't go to the mission," he said before Fury could say anything and hung up once he was done speaking, cutting off Fury again.
"Don't worry, the time will come but there is much to do before I return for Earth's salvation." Tony's jaw clenched as he watched the purple maniac approach him. "Like I said, I am here for you Stark."
"Because you don't know what you have until it's gone, I didn't realize my continuous failures were this serious until now."
The door to the room he was currently trapped in opened and in walked the mad titan himself, accompanied by his two daughters? Who looked nothing like him.
“Why? Because you are from the future?” and you could hear the disbelief in his voice, “I am sorry Mr. Rhodes but this is on me. This is my job.”
“No! Someone has to stop this, and neither of you would leave the other behind. Stay here, I’ll send him out.” And with that he ran after Steve.
“May you never steal, lie, or cheat, but if you must steal, then steal away my sorrows, and if you must lie, lie with me all the nights of my life, and if you must cheat, then please cheat death because I couldn’t live a day without you”
"Please Tony, I know I haven't been present lately, but I love you, and I'll change I swear. I'll take some long vacations, I'll be with you and Peter and..."
He searched the entire house hoping his suspicions weren't true, but unfortunately they were. His beloved husband, the one he loved dearly, the one he'd swore to in front of God to love, to hold and protect until death do them apart, had left him. His empty room, wardrobe and Peter's room confirmed it.
He rang the bell at the mansion Tony had in San Francisco, hoping to not be dismissed. Luckily, Tony opened the door almost right away. His face showed surprised at finding him standing there, it pained Steve, had he been so absent that his husband was surprised to see him? Just the thought brought tears back into his eyes.
There was a long and heavy pause between the both of them. Steve didn't know how to respond, he didn't have anything to say on his defense. Tony's face was full of tears and he watched Peter through the window as he played with his friend Wade.
"Don't try to turn this on them," the blonde growled, "it's very simple, I wanted to marry you and all you wanted was an expensive lifestyle, a sugar daddy."
The latter seem to make the brunette uncomfortable, who blushed and looked somewhere else in the room.
“He’s a kid Steve. Don't get me wrong he's cute and he seems to make you happy. But he's young. I don't want you to get too attached to him." Bucky had cautioned.
He was back from a long mission that had taken more time than originally planned. He was seated on the Quinjet being piloted by Clint and Tasha, it was late, he was exhausted, bruised and the only thing he wanted was to go home and kiss his son good night and snuggle into bed with his husband.
“Alright Cap, who did you get?” Tony asked, peering over the man’s broad shoulders after everyone had finished drawing names for Secret Santa and went their separate ways. Steve yanked his paper away from Tony’s view and leaned away, laughing.
“Now that we have gotten the, apparently entirely unsurprising, revelation about my feelings for a certain American Captain out of the way,” Tony sucked in a deep breath. “What do I do?”
He slotted his leg between Steve’s and put pressure against the growing hardness that was there. Steve could not help himself but to rut against the feeling a few times before leaning down to kiss Tony again. The feeling of their lips together was sweeter than heaven—it was everything Steve had hoped for and more. He made a point of drinking in the moment so that he could remember it forever.
“You wouldn't have a chance and neither do I! I'm timing it for the end of the countdown. There'll be a blip in the power flow. That way it should improve our chances of a clean shut down.”
Steve had known the truth about his parents' death for years. He'd known when they fought Ultron. He'd known when he gave Tony shit about keeping secrets, the fucking hypocrite.
He found Nat and Bucky at his office when he came in, noting their concerned eyes and serious faces.
“This is not a joke. Stop this now. This is gonna kill you! I'll have a chance, you don't have any!”
Suddenly Tony went limp in his arms, the deadweight so unexpected that Steve let go and Tony dropped to the floor. The young man lay there harsh sobs rocking his body, and for the first time since his friends left his office, the fog of pure fury that had filled Steve's vision cleared. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a moment. He opened them and knelt down, next to Tony's shivering frame.
"What happened? Are you okay? Were we robbed?" Tony hurried to Steve to check on the blonde. Steve stood up and stopped Tony from coming any closer, he grabbed a hold of his wrist.
“Rhodes!” Barnes barked his fake name, “we have a bomb that seems to run on the same energy as those Hydra guns. If this detonates god knows what it would do.  We need a way to shut it down.”
“Steve, one day I am going to be someone you trust. Completely. But I can’t wait for you to find that out. So I’m going to prove it to you, and I am sorry. I am really very sorry.” Tony pulled at the chain around his neck and showed him.
"I can't Steve. I can't keep forgiving you." Making his way into the mansion, Steve took Tony's hands and held them tightly hoping to transmit all his emotions and the love he felt for him with the gesture.
"I will be back next week love," he had told Tony on the other line two weeks ago. Unfortunately, not everything had happened as he thought, and he reproached himself for making a promise he did not keep. But that was something out of his hands.
That final thought made him pull at his restrains, he immediately slumped back in the bed his body still felt like he'd been run over by a bus.
Tony had passed out after his encounter with Thanos and when he'd woken up he was being moved. The pain had dulled down, most likely a result of the forced blood transfusion. He'd shuddered as he thought about it. Once more a victim of nonconsensual body modifications.
"Your work is important to you, and it's clear that it will always be more important than Peter and I, " said Tony breaking the silence and looking back at his husband, "but if I am going to live alone, if I am going to raise my son alone because of your job, I am going to do it legally. I am filling for divorce and I am taking full custody of Peter. I spoke to Matt and he'll make sure the process is as short as possible. With your job it is impossible for you to get joint custody, so let's do this the most amicable way possible. You will be able to visit Peter however many times you want...or can. I won't take that from you, you are his father and that won't change."
“You wouldn't tell me why, but I suppose you knew it was time - my time, time for this little trip. You even gave me your dog tags to keep safe, even though you weren’t going on a mission, that should have been a clue.” The dog tags and ring laid on Tony’s chest, and Steve struggled to break free from his bonds.
It wasn't a hard task finding Tony. After spending the night crying, in the morning he decided to get down to work, to find his husband and seek forgiveness. And may lighting strike him down and Hela claim his soul if he failed.
“You still have yours, probably around your neck, or Barnes to be honest. But these here? These are mine. You gave them to me. In 2014.”
"He looks half dead. Should we put him out of his misery?" Another woman said, her voice a lot more confident. The two figures walked closer, and Tony struggle to keep his eyes open. There was no way he could defend himself.
Throwing the papers at the table in front of him, he leaned back against the couch and ran his hands through his face and let out an audible and pathetic sigh. He felt like he had suddenly aged those 70 years he'd been in the ice.
"Are you still trying to deny everything?" Steve scoffed, "I've seen the photos with Stark and Stane. How they parade you at their galas and events. Meanwhile I am sitting here at home, waiting for my genius boyfriend to get back from work or his parent's house. Like a goddamn idiot." He wiped the angry tears from his eyes. "Was any of it real? The plans for clean energy? It can't have all been a lie, you've consulted for Shield Inc., I know you are an actual genius. So why?"
He'd known over a year ago, he'd known when he leaned over the table to kiss Tony. He'd known when they tumbled into bed that same night. He'd known for the rest of their relationship, even when he whispered "I love you" late at night and when Tony had said it right back.
“If that thing goes off it could destroy all of Europe.” Tony worried and began thinking of everything he knew about the tesseract. He needed to shut it down. “Perhaps it could be shut down by using one of the guns and using it to penetrate the force field and using it the bomb to destroy itself, but that would very likely cause the person doing it to be caught in the blast. Not a large blast but the proximity would cause someone to get caught on the crossfire. Plus we would need something to kickstart it.” Tony rambled, he needed to fix this. There was no way he was letting Steve died in the 1940s. Without ever having met him.
"Such fighting spirit. It's a pity that humanity does not appreciate you Anthony Stark." An imposing figure approached from the shadows. He was huge, probably bigger than the hulk himself. "I have waited a long time to meet you Stark."
He went to the kitchen and open one of the compartments and took out a bottle of Asgardian mead that his good friend Thor had brought him. He didn't usually do these things, but by God did he need it today, he needed to drown his sorrows in alcohol.
Steve could see why his friends were concerned. Steve was 32 and Tony had just turned 21, but Steve had never met someone as fascinating as Tony. The young man had so much hope for the future, late at night he would tell Steve about his clean energy research and how he hoped to advance the field, he consulted at Shield Inc. on their prosthetics research. It took Steve no time at all to fall for the young brunette. So yeah, he bought him flowers, expensive clothing, a car that he'd seen Tony appreciate, jewelry that caught the young man's eye, he wanted to provide for Tony to make him as happy as he made Steve.
And he knew the reason exactly. It was his fault. He should have never taken for granted that things would be fine after the huge fight they'd had before leaving, he should have payed more attention to the indifference on his husbands tone on the few times they'd spoken on the phone.
"About the fact that you will keep half of my fortune, it's whats rightfully yours but I know it's something that makes you uncomfortable."
Despite Tony's disapproval, Steve had no other choice but to leave with a heavy heart at having to leave his husband in tears because of him. He hated himself, but he had no other option.
"Sir, like I've already told you, I can't give you the coffee and wait for you to come back. You can come back when you've got your wallet."
"Ah, right," the young man threw the pictures back at Steve, "the pictures your friends gave you. Let me guess, they asked a couple of questions too? And how long did it take for them to convince you?"
"How could you?!" he demanded, aggressively releasing Tony's wrist and storming to the other side of the table.
“Those…those are my dog tags…and my…my father’s ring. Where did you get this?” he thundered. Tony pulled them back to his chest.
"Father," he didn't recognize the breathy feminine voice that rang out, "We've found him. We've got Stark."
Hours later Steve would call Fury to inform him on his resignation and would hang up before a reply could come. He also informed the rest of the team and they'd all agreed that Black Widow and Hawkeye would be the new Avengers team leaders. And finally he posted on his instagram account, with a recent photo of himself with his husband and son, that he would definitively be leaving his mantle as Captain America to dedicate himself fully to being a family man, to what the world didn't take long to react.
He'd called him "love" like he'd always called him when they were a happy couple. It was a hard hit for both of them. But it made Steve realize something...
From then on, it had become a whirlwind. It started with regular dates, and constant text messages and phone calls. Tony would Skype him every night after his classes and soon began staying the night at his penthouse on the weekends. He would have to go to his part time job every other weekend, but at night he would curl up with Steve. Tony moved in after 6 months, he would spend the weekdays at MIT, but the weekends, holidays and breaks were all spent at Steve's warm penthouse in the city.
"What happens after your vacation? You'll leave again, you'll leave me and Peter alone, and years will pass until you take another vacation or I force you to do it."
The sound of footsteps echoed through the bunker, and Tony blinked trying to place the sound. Had FRIDAY alerted Vision?
When he awoke from the ice he couldn't imagine himself marrying and having kids, until he met Tony and everything changed. Now, only days away from being divorced he couldn't imagine what his life would be like as a single man.
Tony closed his eyes as the entire fight replayed in his mind. God he'd been so fucking stupid. And now here he was trapped by some crazy alien bent on conquering earth. Who would protect Earth now? Rogers and Barnes were definitely on the wind now. About half of the team were sitting in Ross's super secret prison. He hoped Vision runs and hides that damn stone. God knows were Natasha was hiding.
"I don't want your money Tony, I didn't marry you for your fortune, I married you because I love you."
“What, no!” Tony grabbed his tools and a weapon, “you stay here. I am going to send him back out here and take a closer look at the bomb and try and stop it from blowing up.”
At those words, Tony, still crying, couldn't help but smile. Steve got off of the chair he'd been sitting and kneeled before his husband taking his hands between his and pressing a kiss in each one.
"He was with Howard Stark at a Gala." Bucky pointed at the picture in question. Tony is in yet another fine suit, getting into the limo with Howard Stark. Steve leaped from his chair and faced the large glass wall, the New York skyline in front of him.
"How many engineers find themselves friends of not one, but two sets of billionaire siblings? He befriends the heirs and sleeps with the CEOs. Never ending supply of gifts and money. Stane and Stark obviously know about each other, they might even share hi-"
While he kept drinking that magic liquid that was already beginning to cloud his senses, he thought that if he went to Ireland tomorrow he would not be able to attend the divorce meeting with Tony in three days. For a fleeting moment he was glad that because of that his divorce would be delayed, but then he realized that this was the reason Tony was doing this in the first place. His continued failures, his constant abandonment despite him promising otherwise, and this time he had promised to take time off to be with his son and had informed SHIELD, and the rest of the team on this. If he now told Tony that he couldn't go, not only to the meeting but also to the trip to to the zoo that he'd promised Peter in a few days, he wouldn't be doing anything else besides proving him right.
The pain in chest grew immensely, tears blurred his vision and he dropped back down on his seat. Suddenly the past year was tainted. All those times Tony left for work, the times he left to visit his parents. He knew that Tony had his secret, but he figured they were personal things that the young brunette would one day entrust him with. Turns out that it was just his double life he'd been leading. It hurt to know it had all been a lie, that all those whispered words late at night had meant nothing to the young man. He wanted so badly to argue with his friends, defend his sweetheart, but all evidence pointed to his friends being right, they would never lie to him or hurt him purposely.
"..w- wh..who...?" Tony could barely keep conscious. He was still on the verge of death, and aliens invading earth was literally his worst nightmare. A new voice rang out and a squid looking figure joined the others.
"I love you, Tony, and the only thing I want is to spend the rest of my life with you. My job as an Avenger has separated me from you more than I thought and I won't let that continue, I'll quit, in this instant, I'll call fury and abandon my role as Captain America for you and for Peter, because you two are more important than anything else. Just say something, just a word to know that you still want to be with me, and I'll do it."
Tony had no clue how much time had passed between the opening of the bottle and when Steve knocked on his door, but he knew it had been at least an hour.
The world melts away as they melt into one another. Those walls quietly crumble as they drink each other in. And their kiss—it is so much more than a simple kiss. It is an extension of the trust and partnership they have in every other arena—in the Avenger’s Tower, on the battlefield—suddenly everything is given a depth that was previously unfathomable.
Moments later Tony and Peter burst through the doors and into the kitchen. Tony held his arms out like a faux savior.
“Yeah, alright. I get it, snookums, you have lives to save or something like that. Thank you. I’ll do my best,” he replied, hanging up the phone and tossing it on the desk. He went back to bouncing the tennis ball off the wall as he racked his brain for the ideal gift.
“C’mon Cap, I’ve worked pretty closely with the military. Rhodey is a Colonel. I know what kinds of things can go on,” Tony added, raising his eyebrows high.
Tony buried himself in his work—designing a more potent version of Nat’s widow bites that would have a quicker response time and further range. He was so engrossed in his new project that thoughts of alcohol faded and he failed to notice Steve entering into the workshop.
“Don’t apologize, Steve. I actually really do appreciate it. I just didn’t want you to feel like I made you do that or anything,” Tony said, rubbing he back of his neck. “But thank you.”
“Hey Tony,” he said, slowly approaching him and sitting on the edge of his bed. Tony was sitting upright near his headboard, legs crossed, smiling.
“This is the nicest thing someone has ever done for me, Tony,” Steve whispered, turning to face him with tears running down his cheeks. “That you think my art is worth this—to be seen by other people? I love it. Thank you.”
That evening Tony found himself vibrating with anxious energy while down in his workshop. He had drawn Steve’s name, because of course the universe wanted to do this to him. These sorts of situations always had a way of happening to him. Now he had to find a way to give Steve the best gift possible—a gift that could communicate all the things he was struggling to express. Gratitude. Affection. Loyalty. Forgiveness. Significance.
But Steve took those words to heart. And the result was an idea to give Tony one of his best sketches of him working away in his shop. In his mind this was one of the most romantic gestures he could muster—he had poured endless hours into that sketch—it was a visual representation of how much he cared about Tony.
Ivonne walked them back to the furthermost booth tucked away in the corner, dimly lit, and quite cozy. They sat down and Tony automatically ordered a bottle of their finest wine.
“N-no—no, Tony, that’s not why I did it,” Steve replied. “I mean—it partially is but no one should have to endure that. It’s gross. Dehumanizing—I hated seeing it happen and honestly I couldn’t control myself. I’m sorry.”
Bucky burst out into laughter. “No, this book is total shit. It is the most boring thing I have ever read.”
“Come on Thor—let me try the big one,” Steve teased in between swings. He took out a line of Chitauri by throwing Mjolnir their way and calling it back into his palm.
“We should exchange our Secret Santa gifts now,” Nat said, breaking apart the separate conversations happening. “Now that we are all here.”
He could feel the tightening in his chest that signaled an anxiety attack was welling up inside. Tony slipped out of the circle he was pretending to converse with to rush to the bar and down a glass of scotch. He placed both hands on the counter and hung his head, sucking in a deep breath to gain some composure back.
“Steve, what’s wrong? You’re not the type of guy to get shaken up,” she whispered, gently rubbing his cheek with her thumb.
“They’re both so dense it is painful,” she said, sitting down on the edge of the bed, turning to face him. “I mean, don’t get me wrong. Tony’s a literal genius and Steve is really damn smart himself, but god. I’m holding their hands through this.”
He paused as the crowd clapped enthusiastically and the people around each respective Avenger turned to them and nudged them in acknowledgment.
“I love you too, Tony. Now please, finally do something about your feelings for Captain America because, and I think I can speak for everyone when I say this, we are tired of you two helplessly pining after one another.”
Stane emerged from the elevator wearing a black and silver suit that was far higher tech than any of the ones on the ground below. His palms and fingertips were glowing yellow, charged with a significant amount of energy, not unlike Tony’s repulsor blasts.
“No—no, no, no,” he rambled. “It is not about that. But thank you—thank you for that and handling that. You’re amazing and perfect, like always.”
“Tony, my dearest Tony, it is going to be okay. Morgan and I are moving back to the cabin, I will just balance working remotely and having Happy babysit or having Morgan come here more, okay? But I don’t blame you for the cruelty of others coming after us—I never will. You make the world a better place—you make me, Morgan, the Avengers—all of us better,” she said. When she leaned back to look Tony in the eyes he would deny that he was crying, but the tears were there anyway.
She titled her head, appraising him for a moment. “Well, because this is the public debut of your new relationship with Captain America. I think that might have something to do with your nerves.”
The smell of Tony—motor oil, coffee, and mint—was intoxicating. Whenever Tony’s calloused fingers brushed against his own it made his heart jump in his throat. Yeah—this was different.
“Steve—these are singlehandedly the most gorgeous pieces of artwork I have ever seen. And yes—I am a bit partial because they have me in them, but still,” Tony said, handing the drawings over to the others so they could see them. “This better than any present I could have thought to ask for. Thank you.”
“We don’t do this enough,” Bucky said. “Men, I mean. Well, us too, I guess. But men—we’re taught not to talk about things. I’ve always had a problem with that, but Steve is the only guy I’ve ever managed to have those conversations with. It takes a lot to do this, especially because society tells us we aren’t supposed to. Thank you, Tony. I forgive you—for all of it. I’m not mad.”
When the quinjet had landed in the streets under the Tower, Bucky and Nat hopped out quickly and went to work on the dozens of bots before them. Steve watched for a brief second as the bots essentially crumbled under his friends’ touch. The sight made his stomach churn.
By the time everyone—save for Tony, who was always a late riser—woke up and made their way to the kitchen, Steve had made an impressive spread of everything from pancakes to bacon and eggs and a parfait bar.
Steve tried to muster a clever retort, but got quickly distracted by a buzzing in his pocket. He took out his phone and checked the notification.
“Danvers,” he shouted, hoping the severity of his tone got her attention immediately. “Get me up top!”
Tony had not seen Zeke in over fifteen years, but apparently the kid—well, now he was a full grown adult—was committed to taking after his father’s ‘destroy Tony’s life mission’.
“Oh god—Tony, are you okay?” Steve’s tone of voice completely changed. He shifted inwardly towards the other man, frowning with worry, and almost checking him over for emotional damage.
They stayed up far too late—all giggles and bad horror movies. Thor somehow continually supplying an endless amount of popcorn for everyone to munch on. As the night went on, Tony completely forgot about the incidents from earlier. Or maybe he stopped caring about them altogether.
“Where is he? Where is Stane?” Tony questioned, his hands clasped on Pepper’s shoulders, forcing her to focus.
Steve’s lips were delicious. And he was a brilliant kisser. He had not even used his tongue yet and Tony was already seeing stars. It was as if they had been doing this all along. It was new and exciting, but felt oddly familiar. It felt like coming home—like coming to a place that they were always meant to be.
“Thor, it’s not your fault Tony’s a jealous child about some things,” she said. Bucky finally looked up from the floor and gave Steve a pointed look.
“I’m sorry if this is crossing a line—I promise the art just went up, no one has seen it, I wanted to get your permission first,” Tony rambled. He reached out to touch Steve’s arm, panicking that he had made a big mistake and Steve would be furious.
It was exhausting listening to these people, who all held positions of extreme privilege in the world, complain about the minor inconveniences in their lives. The politician—Smith, was it?—had cheated on his wife and gotten caught. He talked as if the getting caught part was what was wrong with the whole situation. Tony’s stomach churned.
He should have passed out about fifteen minutes ago from the exhaustion, but his anxiety was a type of inertia propelling him forward. In his worst moments he saw himself in the punching bag and hit harder.
The next few days were filled with other valiant but failed attempts. Steve thought making Tony’s favorite dinner and bringing it down to him would work. Wrong. Taking Tony to his favorite art gallery? Didn’t work. He even got Tony to agree to a baseball game and that didn’t work either. Despite all of his best efforts Tony seemed completely oblivious to Steve’s advances and his feelings.
“Yeah, I know. That’s why you’re lucky I like you, because if I didn’t, I would still be having sex right now.”
But the second he began considering sharing, even with Natasha, who he had known longer than the rest of the team—he slammed into a mental wall. The boundaries he set up to protect himself were oppressive even to himself.
Steve had already gotten excited as they drove into Brooklyn. The fact that Tony would plan their date in Brooklyn meant the world to him. But then they parked in front of a small local art gallery and Steve’s love for Tony grew bigger than he thought possible.
“Turns out I’m not totally useless in the kitchen, Cap. I’m just as surprised as you are,” Tony joked, winking.
And Tony continued on, encouraged by Steve’s blush and sputtering rather than put off by it. “What’s wrong, Rogers? Cat got your tongue? Or has someone else laid claim to it?”
“Right, well, Buck and I are off to the gym to spar,” Steve huffed, setting his dishes in the sink and shooting his best friend a pointed glare.
Tony skyrocketed his way into the main penthouse floor—the same space that Hulk had beaten down Loki in all those years ago—and that was now in a similar state of disarray. There was glass and concrete shattered everywhere. The outer deck was in flames, black smoke billowing up into the night sky. Tony’s heart sank. It looked grim.
“You know why I despise you. I have a list of reasons,” she snarled. “But most importantly, right now, I despise you for fucking up Tony’s sobriety.”
When Steve looked up, Carol was standing over Stane’s lifeless body, breathing heavily. Friday had flown the Iron Man suit with Pepper inside out of the building and down to the quinjet.
I know this chapter was a little rough. It is always hard seeing either Tony or Steve in pain. BUT I promise the next chapter is going to be worth the pain we just went through. And Tiberius will absolutely get what he deserves (hint: it is a fist in the face).
Tony, on the other hand, had brought Peter over for this special night of decorating since he would be spending Christmas with May and family. They sat in the corner, a Stark Pad before them, scheming away on something spectacular. No one was paying them any attention until Steve came in.
“Tony—you loved me with every ounce of yourself and gave our relationship everything it could be given. So, no, you do not get to pretend it did not work out because you were secretly in love with Steve Rogers the whole time. It didn’t work out because sometimes things just don’t,” Pepper said, now stern and reassuring. She was not going to budge—she was not going to let Tony spiral into another self-hatred space.
“No thanks, no intergalactic work for me for a bit,” he laughed. “Last time I was out there I got stabbed and I’d rather not do that for a while.”
Heartbreak was too kind of a word for the way he felt seeing Tony break his sobriety. And devastation was too soft for the feeling of learning that Tony had a man in his bed. Those feelings came back to him now, welling up inside his chest, as he let himself really feel them this time. He was alone—far enough away from the main building that if he cried no one would hear him. The anguish gurgled up in his throat until the tears spilled down his cheeks.
Tony struggled to regain his composure, but he managed to stand up and give Steve a salute. “Lead the way, Captain.”
“It’s okay,” Tony whispered, realizing how much this actually meant to Steve, and that it was more than the Captain’s usual savior complex bullshit. He carefully placed his hand on Steve’s shoulder and squeezed. Several seconds passed before Steve regained his composure and looked over at Tony with a tiny smile.
“It isn’t your call this time, Rogers!” Tony yelled. He couldn’t restrain the anger and panic that was gripping at his throat.
“Rhodey-bear, you’re being awfully quiet,” Tony hummed, bending over and zeroing in on a small section of the gauntlet with a tiny laser pen. Steve’s heart clenched in his chest knowing the second he replied, this brief version of this where he could pretend that Tony knew it was him in the secret workshop—because in this daydream they were a couple so of course Steve knew about Tony’s secret workshop—and this was their routine to hide away in here together. The minute he spoke—that beautiful illusion would be shattered.
Relieved that maybe he would not have to spend every other evening arguing with Pepper—having to decide between his spouse and the work he loves so dearly.
Steve rode his vintage Harley-Davidson Street 750 that Tony had gifted him back in 2012 all the way into the city. He hoped the ride would calm him down, but instead it only gave him more time to ruminate on what had been done to Tony. The longer he thought about how vile a person would have to be to blackmail someone—someone you claimed to love, that had been your friend for decades—simply because they would not continue to sleep with you—Steve could not fathom the thinking behind that decision. And on top of that, Ty knew what Tony had been going through—he knew about the alcoholism, going to AA, the divorce—and he still made the choice to kick him while he was down. By the time Steve reached the city his blood was boiling with a righteous fury.
“Yeah alright, that is a fair assessment,” Tony drawled, coming back to the present moment. “I seem to remember a drunk night or two where I waxed poetic about his beautiful ass, so I’m aware I’m anything but subtle when I’m around you.”
He kept eye contact with Steve while he playfully licked the length of his own palm. Then Tony reached down and wrapped his hand around both of their erections, holding them together and giving them a few languid strokes. Steve’s entire body shuttered at the sensation.
“Yeah—something like that,” Tony responded, eyes glancing over at Steve who was busy chatting away with Scott and Sam.
“A bad influence, I know,” Tony grumbled. “You think I don’t know that? That is exactly why I answered his text. I was lonely and horny and I like attention.”
