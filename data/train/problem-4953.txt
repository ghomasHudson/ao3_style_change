Dean laughs, the low rumble shaking through Castiel. The physicality of sensation like this never fails to catch Castiel off guard.
Castiel feels the want to crawl into Dean’s bed after he steps out of the bathroom, freshly showered and sleepy from the hot water. Dean’s already curled up under the covers, full of pie and conversation, and as much Castiel wants, he doesn’t give in. Wanting is a strange thing, and sometimes not fulfilling it is enough to quell it.
“Why didn’t you let me do it?”
“How about we go for a drive to that diner? I could use some fresh air. And a burger.”
Dean just blinks at him. Jack gives him a knowing look.
Dean rolls his eyes, trying not to blush, while Jack looks at them somewhat confused. Castiel pecks Dean on the cheek before standing up. “Jack, I’m glad you want a friend like him. There are certainly far worse choices on that show,” Castiel declares, and Jack giggles. Castiel stretches his arms over his head with another yawn, his sweater riding up to show a bit of his belly, much softer now than it had been years ago. Dean resists the urge to poke it.
On the drive back, Dean admits that he told Jody what had happened. He assumes that Castiel did the same with Claire, and he confirms. It’s as simple as that. Castiel did not tell Claire about the loaded confession that preluded his capture (and he assumes Dean didn’t tell Jody either), but something tells him Claire pieced it together pretty quickly.
“Thank you, Dean, for everything. I talked to Sam, too. He knows. I don’t know when I’ll be back, but I look forward to it more than anything else.”
All of Jack’s previous apprehension seems to have dissipated as he passes the laptop over to Dean, a word document open. “You can read it if you want. There’s not much, and it’s mostly just ideas I guess.”
Jack contemplates for a moment before putting the laptop towards him. “No, it’s nothing secret. Maybe it’s a little, um, silly?” he mutters, chewing his words thoughtfully.
“Well, it seems like it’s mostly Archie and you doing stuff here,” he mutters, sneaking a glance at Jack whose face is growing red. Dean places the laptop back on the bed and picks up his coffee mug, taking a long sip of the now lukewarm brew.
on my own, it all flew out the window the second I saw you.”
“I wasn’t able to get him back the way he was, Dean, but I did my best. In some ways, it’s nice, because I don’t think I want too many angels on Earth anyway, but I feel bad that Cas had to lose his grace.” Jack looks up at Dean, and Dean’s still frozen in place.
“He’s busy, Dean. He will visit when he can.”
“Just because I want it doesn’t mean it’s what you should have done.”
Jack blushes. “N-no, no! I mean, maybe a little…” he stammers, and Dean can’t help but smile. He knows Jack has no qualms about being attracted to boys or girls, but it’s a universal thing to be embarrassed about a schoolyard crush.
He tells Dean that he sometimes thought he could do this human thing on his own, but he realizes that the happiness that is supposed to come with freedom, with the liberation that Jack gave them, would never truly be his if he was alone.
Dean’s on his second cup of coffee when he stops by Jack’s bedroom door. Castiel is taking an excessively indulgent mid-afternoon nap and judging by the locked bedroom door, he is not in the mood for a bedfellow. Jack, on the other hand, is sitting up in his bed, brows furrowed at his laptop screen while he furiously types away. Dean knocks lightly on the doorframe, causing Jack to look up and smile, a hint of embarrassment on his face.
Castiel’s eyebrows shoot up into his hairline. “That was you?”
It’s too much to hold.
Sometimes, when Sam and Dean leave to go on a hunt, leaving Castiel alone (though Miracle is there, and he’s basically at Castiel’s heels wherever he goes), he just wanders around the bunker. Castiel asked to join them a few times, but Sam insisted, perhaps on Dean’s behalf, that he needed to rest still. The hunts are infrequent, thankfully, and they talk loosely about stopping the hunts in the near future. Castiel can’t help but find that funny, that he would return to Earth just in time to
“I heard about it on the internet when I was looking up stuff about Star Wars and Riverdale,” Jack explains, and Dean shifts closer to him to see what’s on his screen. He sees a few websites open, but they look like just a bunch of text. “It’s called fanfiction. Do you know what that is?”
“He’s the one person we can trust to do the right thing, don’t you think? I mean, we can probably talk to him if we want to, and maybe even ask about Ca-”
“So, you don’t think it’s weird, Dean?”
One evening, as Castiel is washing the dishes (upon his insistence, and after much protest from Dean), he asks Dean if they can go see Jody and Claire. Dean raises his eyebrows at the request, asking why he needed Dean’s permission to go. Castiel shrugs, but deep down he knows Dean wants to see Claire as much as he does. He asks if they know what happened, and Dean says no. He wants to ask if he should tell them, but he decides to keep it to himself.
“Not important. Nerd stuff. You’ll learn about that later,” Dean huffs. Truth be told, writing may have been the one thing Dean did not mind during his sporadic high school stint. He’s sure that if John had let him stay at one place for longer than a few weeks, he might have actually enjoyed analyzing literature and writing comparative essays on historical events. Instead, all he had were beat up Vonnegut volumes he stole from the school libraries in some deep corner of his closet. He’s not sure if one can get a degree on one author, but he’s pretty sure he’s qualified for at least a bachelor’s in Vonnegut.
“What do you mean?” Dean asks, his voice quiet and tentative.
“It’s not silly, Cas,” Dean interrupts. He feels Dean’s arm wrap around his shoulders, squeezing Castiel into his side. He relaxes into Dean’s touch.
They’re facing each other, a few inches apart on the couch, and Castiel admires Dean up close. The crook of his nose dusted with freckles from long days in the sun. The curl of his eyelashes, the wrinkles around his eyes, the fullness of his lips. And, of course, the green in his iris that not even nature could conjure. When Castiel loved Dean before, he saw something that he thought was much more meaningful, his soul, his spirit, his righteousness. Now, without his grace, he knows that he sees those same things with equal intensity in the beauty of his form. Castiel sees Dean deeper than he ever had before.
“Is that Jack?” Dean’s says quietly, a curious playfulness colouring his tone. Castiel jumps slightly, turning his head towards his voice. Dean is dressed for the day in his flannel uniform, holding a cup of coffee in one hand and a few books in the other. Castiel softens at the sight of him, the man he loves, looking radiant even in the dimly lit corridors of the library.
Dean swallows. “Yeah, I guess you would know that now, but just because…” he coughs, pushing down the need to cry, or scream, or go silent again,
Dean doesn’t want to be angry with anyone. In a sense, it was all a collection of necessary evils to get to this point – Castiel had to sacrifice himself for Jack, and Jack’s departure was the logical next step after he took Chuck’s power. He should be used to this, he thinks, and he should be
The following morning, Castiel pours his coffee with honey into a travel mug, and it’s early enough that neither Sam nor Dean are awake. He scrawls a note about heading into town to pick up a few things, leaving it on the kitchen table, and climbs into his old truck. He thanks Jack that the car still turns on after a long stretch of neglect and he drives aimlessly towards the closest town.
“You do?”
If Dean can’t be the one to drag him out himself, then he doesn’t know if he deserves it. So, in a way, Dean’s scared of Jack doing the right thing. What is he supposed to do for Castiel on Earth? What could he even offer to the angel that gave up
Jack smiles, and his childish veneer disappears with it. “Dean, I may still have much to learn, especially from you, but I am confident with what I chose to do. Yes, there was some compromise, but anything dealing with humanity works that way.” Dean lets a breath out, his chest sagging.
Dean figures that it makes enough sense. Every kid out there has imagined themselves as a jedi, or a superhero. It seems to be more or less the same thing. He looks back at the document, and another question surfaces.
Dean chuckles before gently ruffling Jack’s hair. “Just yankin’ your chain, kid.” He sets his coffee cup on Jack’s night table, internally wishing there was a coaster there but a heat stain on furniture here is not exactly of high concern. “So, what is it? Don’t tell me you’re already writing essays before you start school. I knew Sam would be a bad influence on you.”
“Are you going to be okay, Dean?”
Dean is quiet beside him, but he’s relaxed. Castiel is relieved at that – the last thing he needs is for this to turn into an uncomfortable situation.
Dean scrolls to the top of the document, and in large, bold font at the top of the page it reads “Jack and Archie’s Adventures”. Dean raises an eyebrow at that.
Castiel squeezes his hand around Dean’s. He remembers the drawing well – the dramatic shadows, the detail of his trench coat, and each individual feather of his wings. Some days he forgets that he had shown Dean his wings back in the barn, and it still surprises him to this day how impactful that has been on Dean.
Dean sighs. “You said something about taking care of things here, but what does that have to do with any of this?”
“Why don’t we tell him to come visit?” Dean murmurs, and Castiel shakes his head.
. His purpose is increasingly unclear as he pads around the bunker, his fingers grazing the walls as he walks by, and in some ways, he envies Jack, his son who will never be without purpose.
Castiel doesn’t know if he should admit that he has. It seems vain to want to see his own entry, especially since he’s no longer an angel, but curiosity had gotten the best of him.
“So, there is a catch.”
Castiel hums. “I…I was so
Sam invites Eileen to stay at the bunker for the weekend that Dean and Castiel plan to head to South Dakota. Castiel had invited him to come as well, but Sam insisted that he stay, saying he wanted to keep an eye on potential cases. They pack overnight bags, Castiel smiling as he packs his own bag with his own things, and they head off. The drive is pleasant, and Dean doesn’t strike up much conversation, but Castiel doesn’t mind. The long drives are familiar, but something about the destination not being a vampire nest or a murder scene is nice for a change.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Where is he, Jack?”
He’s there.
The night Castiel was taken away, Dean had drunk himself into a stupor. Sometimes he continues that evening in the solace of his own room and fuck, it sure is effective at soothing the swells of emotion that creep up on him at every hour. Dean hears Sam’s footsteps pause outside his door each night, and he wonders if his sobs are audible in the halls, and if maybe Castiel could hear them, too. It’s a stupid thought, knowing how the Empty works, but every so often, after five more glasses of whiskey than necessary, he calls out to him. Once or twice, he catches himself screaming Castiel’s name, and he knows Sam can hear that, but it’s too much to hold inside. It’s the only thing he’s said in days.
He doesn’t mean for Dean to catch him sketching on a Thursday morning, hidden away in the corner of the library with a cup of coffee by his feet. Castiel had been sketching for several weeks now, his sketchbook filled with bees, flowers, Miracle, and, of course, Dean. Today, though, he’s drawing something different.
He smiles and nods, weirdly embarrassed about being caught drawing. It was hardly a scandalous thing to be doing, but the moments he spent with his sketchbook always felt so private and intimate. Besides, he mostly drew Dean after all.
Dean stares blankly at Jack, as if he was speaking an entirely different language. Jack smiles.
Dean’s silence provides Sam with all the answers he needs. Dean feels Sam get up from the bed.
When Dean calls him to dinner, Castiel brings the camera with him and snaps a candid photo of Dean and Sam at the table. Sam asks if he got that today and mentions that he may have extra film somewhere in the bunker. Dean scowls, unhappy that he was taken by surprise, but insists on seeing the photo. He shows Castiel how to properly let the film develop, and their eyes linger on the photo a beat longer than normal. It’s an unassuming photo, much like the ones Dean had taken, but it’s honest, visceral, and real. No amount of angel memory could capture the beauty of that singular moment in time the same way.
Like Castiel must have done for countless nights.
Dean’s tone is biting and cold. Given that these are the first words Dean has said to Sam in days, he shuts his mouth. In a sense, Dean’s said too much already, and now Sam knows for sure the reason for his excessive ennui. He reaches a hand to Dean’s shoulder, and Dean doesn’t flinch away. They stay like that for a moment before Sam gets up, closing the door behind him.
Dean snorts, and Sam furrows his brow. “Don’t you want to, Dean?”
He thinks more about what Sam said as the days pass, as he fills in his sketchbook with more drawings, the pages paperclipped with new photos. He took a few of more of Dean, some of Miracle, and others of the nature outside the bunker. When they went out to the city, he would snap some tourist-y photos of Dean, who would roll his eyes at being forced to pose, but always flashed a brilliant smile for the camera. It’s a smile that Castiel studies intensely, but he can’t quite capture it on paper. He wonders how he could ever take care of Dean the way he is now, weak and riddled with emotion, unable to even heal the smallest cut without the help of a first-aid kit. He wants to say he understands, just so his mind can stop racing, but it’s more challenging to convince himself that he would like.
Castiel’s eyes widen as Dean chuckles.
Dean tells him he loves him.
He feels Dean tense beside him. It’s a sore subject, that time, particularly for Dean. Castiel has forgiven him probably a hundred times over, but Dean had yet to forgive himself. Perhaps he never would, but Castiel doesn’t mind reminding his love of his love.
“I’d like that, Dean.”
“I don’t want a thank you, Dean,” Jack says, shrugging his shoulders. “All I want is for you to keep your end of the promise.”
Dean takes a sip of his coffee, as if to avoid the question, and Castiel prods at his cheek to get him to answer. Dean rolls his eyes.
Deans wants to reach out and touch him, but he’s afraid he’ll disappear if he does.
It’s too much, and so he lets some of it go. He tells Dean how he’s felt about being human, about how confusing and nonsensical everything about it has been. He tells him about how it feels to want such trivial things, how impactful the smallest inconveniences can be, and how overwhelming it is to be so
Dean scratches his chin. “Yeah, I’ve heard of it. Like, fans writing alternate versions of stuff, right?” Jack nods in confirmation. Dean’s pretty sure he’s heard Charlie talk about fanfiction (sometimes it gets difficult to parse what’s canon and not in her rants), and although he hasn’t participated in it much, Charlie had made a compelling argument for fanfiction being an excellent source of queer literature. Sure, Dean’s imagined Kirk and Spock getting it on every so often, though he’s not sure he needs to read a 20-page manifesto about it.
He is his own person.
Jack, all things considered, is still very much a child. As far as they know, Jack doesn’t really have any friends besides Claire and Kaia, and Castiel worries about his lack of socialization. Dean finds it very funny, poking at Castiel’s own stunted social skills, but he certainly doesn’t disagree. At the end of the day, Jack deserves a childhood that is not shackled to a narrative that involves saving the world and all that jazz. Castiel worried himself with where the best possible place to relocate for Jack would be, consulting nearly everyone in the contacts list for help (Dean had overheard Aaron’s voice on the phone saying “Oh you’re his gay thing”) while Dean focused his attention on the menial task of organizing and packing. It’s mind-numbing and physically demanding enough to push down his own anxieties, though if he lets Jack magically move heavy things into boxes a few times, that’s their secret.
– he knew that his usual attire was somewhat odd, given the bevy of strange looks and comments he’s received during hunts over the years, and even Dean’s own teasing of his trench coat – but it was never a major concern on his end. Now, suddenly, surrounded by a sea of t-shirts, the need to appear sensible and stylish is a burdensome priority.
Jack tilts his head. “Do you remember what I asked of you, Dean?”
“Jack, you have to tell me the truth right now,” he starts, doing his best to keep his voice steady. “You have to tell me if there’s a catch.”
He still keeps the shirt he’s wearing, which belongs to Dean, and folds it in neatly with the rest of his clothes.
Jack briefly looks back at his screen sheepishly. “Uh,” he says slowly, “I’m writing. Something.”
“Don’t talk about Cas.”
“I’ve been trying to capture his face for a while now,” he replies, pausing as Dean slides down onto the floor next to him, their knees knocking. “It’s much more challenging than I anticipated. I wish I had more photos of him.”
“I didn’t realize how deep human emotion was until the first time I became human.”
Dean wonders if Castiel fell for him while he was asleep, because now, watching Castiel sleep peacefully, he feels an indescribable pull in his heart.
So, instead, he sits in the chair by the bed, and watches him.
“It’s what you wanted, Dean. I know that.”
“This just feels too easy, y’know?”
And through blurry eyes he still thinks Dean is beautiful, when he is nothing more than splashes of colour through his tears. He asks Dean if he’ll stay, if he’ll let Castiel come with him. He says it’s too much to ask, but he knows he must ask it.
Sprawled out on his bed, dressed in his trench coat and suit like always, his back rises and falls with his breathing.
When they return, Sam and Eileen rush out of some corner in a shockingly similar manner to how Gabriel and Rowena had once scrambled, and Dean groans loudly about using bedrooms for bedroom activities. Sam looks flustered but Eileen laughs it off, dragging him away somewhere more private. Dean comments under his breath that the lovebirds would eventually have to find their own nest, and this time Castiel does not miss what he says.
of the physicality of the world. He talks about how much he misses Jack, how he didn’t know how much he needed him to be physically here, to hold him, and he talks about how much it scares and delights him that he’s becoming his own person, separate from the person his body used to belong to. Dean listens attentively, his eyes warm and safe to look at for once.
“S-So… Cas…”
Castiel lets his head rest on Dean’s shoulder.
“I was a big part of the reason Cas went to the Empty in the first place, so I had some, um, leverage? Is that the right word? Anyways, I got him out, but his grace couldn’t come with him.”
Jack tilts his head. “I made two promises to you, Dean. I would do my best, but I needed time,” he says matter-of-factly, “and that I would no longer interfere. I’ve fulfilled one, and I’m here to fulfill the second.”
“Hey,” Sam starts tentatively, sitting at the edge of the bed.
Dean catches what Jack almost said. It’s no secret, the kid’s face lights up any time Archie is on the screen. To Dean, Archie’s pretty unremarkable, a typical handsome male lead who gets all the ladies, but definitely the kind of guy young kids would idolize. He scrolls down further, his eyes scanning the words in the document.
“Just drawing it like I see it, Cas.”
Jack tilts his head to the side, another Cas-ism that makes Dean turn to mush. “What’s an essay?” he asks innocently.
Jack chuckles. “That’s true. I guess it’s more about getting to hang out with Ar- I mean, with the characters. That’s what I like.”
It’s warm, it’s so warm, and it’s the loveliest thing he’s ever felt.
It’s only enough clothes to maybe fill two drawers in his dresser, but it’s a start. It’s all his own, and the thrill of ownership of material goods is something else. The shortcomings of humanity and materialism are becoming clearer to him. Wanting and desire used to be so much more unidimensional to Castiel, a bright, sharp light that flickered and guided him off his path, but now, want and desire is attributed to something as small as a t-shirt and a pair of boxers printed with little sailboats. It’s hard to believe that at one point, he agreed with the angels that they were far superior to humans. To be without complexity, without small joys and losses to accompany the bigger ones, is a fate that Castiel now fears.
“Goodbye, Dean.”
“I just think that when I go to school, I would want a friend like Archie.”
When he returns, Dean is halfway up the stairs, and there’s a concerned look on his face. Castiel smiles at him, and Dean seems to relax at the sight of him. Dean asks what’s in his bag, but Castiel plays coy, though Dean does comment on the hat, saying he really looks like a dad. Castiel laughs, mentioning that Claire had said the same thing. It’s easy conversation, though Castiel can still tell Dean was worried moments before. Castiel wonders if Dean thought he had left again, and he suddenly feels his heart sink. Dean plasters on a smile, and Castiel does the same. Castiel is used to putting on a façade; his stoic, emotionless behaviour was nothing more than a cover-up most times after all, but it’s strange to put on the façade of happiness, of content, to imitate what it might feel like to feel good.
“Just like in Riverdale.”
Castiel hums in agreement, but he feels that same embarrassment from earlier. Being human is so strange.
Something clicks in Dean’s head when Jack says that. In all the nights him and Castiel had fretted over Jack’s integration into society, they hadn’t really considered what Jack thought about it. Riverdale, admittedly, is a poor representation of what high school was going to be like (though not for the murder mystery part, they had that down), but otherwise Jack doesn’t really have a reference for what teenagers are like. There was that time Jack had run into those kids when he went off to do a supply run, a story he told them long after it happened, but that didn’t exactly end well for Jack.
Every morning, Castiel puts a spoonful of honey into his coffee, just enough to sweeten it and change its consistency ever so slightly, its sweet and roasted residue sticking to the inside of his mouth. Dean doesn’t get it and refuses to try it, which in many ways is fine as it means more honey for Castiel, but he can’t help but want to share it. It’s the sharing that’s complicated for Castiel. As an angel, he was so self-sustaining, and although Sam and Dean offered him shelter (except for one other time that is both painfully similar and unbelievably different from his current human experience), he decides that part of his humanity is to build an independence. However, it would be an independence that is more complex, more nuanced than before.
They’re both quiet for a moment before Dean clears his throat.
Jack’s eyebrows shoot up. “Oh, no I brought Cas back,” he says cheerfully, and Dean’s eyes go wide. He quickly sits up in bed, much to the protest of Miracle, who growls playfully before leaping off the bed.
“I mean, that makes sense, but why Riverdale?” he asks lightly, a little bit of teasing in his tone. “Not exactly the most cheerful world to put yourself in, kid.”
Dean nods in understanding. “So, it has nothing to do with his handsome face?”
Dean smiles, and it feels foreign on his face.
“We could go look for him, you know.”
Dean crooks an eyebrow at him. “You saying you won’t visit?”
“Have you ever seen your entry in the bestiary?”
Dean jerks his head towards Jack. “We’re just talking about how Jack wants a friend like Archie Andrews.” Jack tosses a pillow at Dean, and Dean revels in the small joy of being the one Jack confided in first, even if he leaked his little secret almost immediately.
that day, Dean. It was so strange – all it took was for you to be there, physically.”
Jack shakes his head. “Nope. Well, besides Cas being human, there is no catch.”
The hellos and hugs are long, and Jody and Claire notice something different about Castiel immediately. Claire speaks up first, asking why he’s wearing a sweater, and Castiel just smiles. They have dinner, catch up with the exploits of the Wayward Sisters, and Dean ends up in a deep conversation with Patience and Jody, giving Castiel his chance to be alone with Claire. He asks her where they can talk in private, and Claire takes him to the roof of the house. It feels unsafe, especially without his grace, but the simple thrill of being somewhere unconventional and unadvisable warms him. He supposes that he would also experience pockets of teenage rebellion well into his human adulthood.
Happiness, with Dean in his last moments, so on and so forth.
Dean watches patiently as Castiel feels the different fabrics and cuts around him. He’s not particularly helpful, though, as any time Castiel asks his opinion, he just shrugs. He does offer some knowledge, such as what fabrics are easy to wash, and what will keep him warm or cool, but nothing aesthetics-wise. It’s odd for Castiel to want to know what would look
“Whatcha up to, kid?” Dean asks, doing his best to lean casually against the doorframe. He’s still navigating his relationship with Jack – the boy is far too forgiving for his own good, and the things Dean did eat at him, but he knows now is, among many things, an opportunity to make it right with him.
for him? How could he ever be enough for Castiel, and how could he ever be so selfish to want him here after that?
Dean huffs. “Too busy to see his dads? I don’t think so. C’mon, one prayer wouldn’t hurt. We can do it together.”
Jack turns to look at Dean, his face still so strikingly similar to Castiel’s.
“Jack, what do you mean you brought Cas back?”
Jack smiles, tilting his head. “He’s in the bunker. I put him to bed, which was super weird since he’s my dad and all, but he’s pretty tired.” Jack thinks for a moment. “He should wake up soon, but he might be in rough condition.”
In every iteration of himself, he loves Dean Winchester.
They pull up to a department store, a dying artifact of America sustained by rural landlocked areas like Kansas. They’re unimpressive in all ways except their size, and the stark whiteness of them reminds Castiel a little too much of heaven. Dean insists on taking a cart with them, and Castiel thinks it’s so he has something to do with his hands. Dean’s much more fidgety these days, always needing to have his hands occupied, whether it be mindlessly cleaning weapons or cooking an unnecessary meal in the kitchen. After years of watching over him, Castiel knows when his pattern is off, but he tries not to let it consume him. Dean tells him he’s fine whenever he asks, and he doesn’t press further. What they have is precious, fragile, and sensitive, and perhaps he could prod it to grow, but one wrong push could send it all crashing down.
him. And Dean loved Cas.
“...you wanted to have sex for the sake of
made me come alive.”
One rideshare downtown and Castiel and Charlie were standing in front of Chuck’s small, rundown brick house. “Woof,” Charlie said. “You’d think some of those book royalties could’ve paid for a little upkeep around here.”
“Castiel.”
Cas frowned, dropping his shoulders in surrender. “You’ve come to make good on our deal, now that I have everything I want. Fair enough. But please, allow me to say goodbye to my family before you take me forever.”
Cas’s eyes fell closed. Dean holding him felt so
Nevertheless, Dean was seething all the way home, muttering murderous threats under his breath. Sam looked at Cas, his eyes clearly saying,
Sam smiled sympathetically. “You’re doing the right thing, you know. Being respectful of Cas while he’s like this.”
“He’s just...narrating.”
“He does?” Castiel said in surprise. Dean had been sort of...not cold, exactly, since Sam had welcomed him in, but not overly friendly either.
“You don’t know Metallica?” Dean said in disbelief. “What, there’s no rock music in Jonestown either?”
“Dean! Um...kids? Can I see you in here?”
Dean, Jack, and Claire clambered into the library where Cas was waiting. “Whoa,” Dean said, eyes wide. “What’s all this?”
Rubbing his eyes, Castiel padded into the bathroom and turned on the faucet to his bathroom sink. He wet the bristles of his green toothbrush, squirted out a pea-sized dollop of toothpaste, and set to brushing his 32 teeth 76 times
Dean gave him an inscrutable look. Castiel’s face flushed and he shyly cleared his throat. “That was...an attempt at a joke,” he said weakly.
Dean fumed as they left, Cas coming up beside him. “Dean, you look tense. Would you like a neck massage?”
“Oh...I guess you can just take me back to the bus station. I’m sure there’s an empty bench I can sleep on.”
“I guess...” Castiel sighed. “I have always wanted to learn to play the guitar.”
Cas felt a chill run through him. “What else?”
”Sorry it took so damn long for us to get our shit together,” Dean said. “Guess we coulda used that courage a lot sooner, huh?”
Well technically, Dean
“I’m...changing?”
Dean then gave Cas another one of those mind-alternating kisses, this time gently coaxing Cas to part his lips for his tongue. They made out hard and sloppy, and Castiel suddenly felt Dean cup his bulge and he squeaked.
Castiel nodded. “Okay.”
“Narrating.”
“Damn, this has really got you down.”
“It’s fine, just don’t, like...mess with my stuff and we’ll be fine.” Dean looked at Cas’s empty hands. “Speaking of which, where’s
Finally the watch fell silent, returning to its normal time display.
“I will,” said Charlie, taking the envelope and smiling. “Thanks, Chuck. I, uh...I was totally addicted to your other books in high school, by the way. Even though I always hated the endings.”
“Yes, although I’m not very good at it. The others are faster than me.”
Castiel Novak had been saved...by his wristwatch.
“I’ve been hearing your voice. You’ve been narrating my life. The way I count brushstrokes when I brush my teeth, the way I style my hair, the way I tie my tie...falling in love with Dean, you narrated all of that!”
“Hello?” he called out. He was met with only the sound of blaring rock music. He slowly paced around, looking everywhere for a sign of life, till finally he saw a pair of bow legs clad in grease-stained jeans sticking out from underneath a bright orange car. “Mr. Winchester?” Castiel said.
Claire helped him pick out a guitar strap, a travel case, a capo, and a guitar stand, and also gave him a business card for a YouTuber who gave free online tutorials for guitarists who were just starting out. “That’s my girlfriend Kaia,” Claire gushed as Castiel paid. “We have a band with our friends, The Wayward Sisters. Our cover of ‘Black Betty’ is lit. Check us out, we’re on Spotify.”
Well, not
”Yeah. Makes people less afraid. In a fight...or of telling people how they really feel about them.”
“No. I mean, he doesn’t sound like me. It’s a voice I’ve never heard before.”
, Castiel. Surely there are more
“There are a lot of interesting artifacts in here. I wish we had time to look everything over with more scrutiny,” Cas commented, studying a yellowed envelope. “This is correspondence from THE Arthur Conan Doyle about a sighting of fairies in the English countryside. Apparently he was a British Man of Letters.”
The other angels gasped in shock at the use of vulgarities. Right here, in Santa’s workshop of all places!
“Castiel,” said Castiel flatly. He
“You know what?” Eileen said loudly. “It’s fine.”
Dean clapped his hands, a desperately hopeful glint in his eye. “Okay. Let’s do it!”
Uriel/The Empty laughed. “Isn’t that sweet. Your little guard dog thinks it can take me on. If you like, I can always just go and find the boy and take him instead. He won’t be hard to find on a planet this barren.”
, man,” Dean groaned. “Not right in front of me.”
Castiel tossed Dean’s boots over his shoulder without a care, and his sock quickly followed suit. Then he unbuckled Dean’s belt with ease, and peeled the jeans and underwear down his legs. Castiel smirked at Dean’s cock. “What have we here?” he said.
Little did Castiel know, that one little act of rebellion had sent the tax auditor in the trenchcoat down the path of fate...to his own end.
“You can’t write Cas’s ending,” Charlie said, stepping forward. “Maybe he’s not really your son—maybe he didn’t exist before you started writing—but he’s real now, you can’t just kill him!”
“Yes, yes,” Cas gasped. “But before that...the last time we made love, I promised you something.” He smiled mischievously. “On your back, Dean.”
Castiel learned, slowly, to play his lovely new guitar. He no longer counted brushstrokes in the mirror. He didn’t worry about how long it took to get dressed or being at the bus stop at an exact time down to the second anymore. And, he discovered, he really wasn’t as alone as he’d thought. Inias really was a kind, friendly person, and Charlie kept in frequent contact, inviting him to join her and her roommate for movie nights and to go LARPing with her on weekends.
“Dean, I’m-!...I’m

Cas rolled his eyes again. “Relax. I drove to the International House of Pancakes this morning and ordered this to go.”

find himself playing with the cube’s little buttons inside his pocket as he stood on the corner by the crosswalk, waiting for the light to change. With a growl he jerked his hand out of his pocket. He brought his wrist up to his face to check the time...to see that his watch said 11:17.
“Thank you,” Cas said, ambling past her, weaving through the small, dark, cramped living room to where Chuck sat in front of his typewriter, head buried in his hands. “Hello, Chuck,” said Castiel softly.
“No, no, of course not; you’re wonderful.”
Cas dropped his head to lay kisses along his shoulder. “When I went to hell to save your soul, I worried I would have to spend days, weeks, maybe months searching for you among the damned. I didn’t have to. The soul of the Righteous Man was so brilliant that I found him in an instant. And then I put your body back together with my own two hands, trying to build a vessel to do justice to your radiance. I think I did an excellent job.” Cas smirked.
it sounded a thousand times filthier. Dean was blushing like a whore in church.
Dean blinked again. “.........w-what now?”
“Relax, just the people who know about the potion—the four of us, and Rowena.”
“Castiel, uh...you know
“Tell me exactly what happened, in excruciating detail. And definitely don’t forget about what the narrator said.
at him.
Castiel touched Dean’s forehead with two fingers, and suddenly Dean was lying on his back on a bed, hands bound above his head. “Hey!” he shouted. “Let me go, or I’ll-”
“I’m getting dressed,” Dean snapped, stomping out of the room.
It took roughly 12 hours to finally reach the station in Lebanon, so it was early afternoon by the time he reached Dean’s address. Sure enough, parked on the street in front of the modest yet charming red brick house was a life size version of Castiel’s toy Chevy Impala. Castiel grinned, cheeks flushed with excitement. He was finally here!
“Anything for you,” Dean purred, and he sat up, pushing Cas’s leg higher so he could fuck into him deeper. The angle allowed Dean to strike Cas’s prostate with exact precision, and that paired with Dean’s hand stroking him in rhythm had Cas crying out.
Dean smiled and kissed his forehead, then led him by the hand to the table.
Cas looked back at Chuck. “Look, I’m not just one of your characters, I’m a real person, I exist. You can’t kill me, please!”
Dean had kinda been hoping to eat the pie and ice cream off the angel’s body instead, but he decided birthday sex could wait (just as long as it didn’t wait
I’m sorry.” Crying, Castiel hung up the phone and burying his face in his hands as he sobbed.
“How do I do that?” Castiel asked. “Death could be waiting for me around every corner no matter what I do!”
“Yeah, ‘cause two guys sharin’ a body sounded so simple on the surface,” Dean laughed, exhausted.
“I don’t know. I-I guess you...you hold the pearl and...and concentrate on what your heart desires.” Sam’s voice trembled with excitement.
Castiel...is dead,” Chuck said quietly, looking at his lap.
Claire gave him a bewildered look. “Uhh, Mom?” she called over her shoulder.
“That’s it, Dean,” Castiel growled, grinding against him. Dean could feel a sizable bulge to match his own. “Your body is responding to me. It wants to give itself over. I’d advise you not to fight it.”
“Hey, Cas?” Dean asked a few minutes later. “How many hours we got left till this Friday gets unFreaky’d?”
Michael glared at him. “Go get the mop and clean this up,” he growled.
Cas gasped, stepping back. “You’re not Crowley.”
Suddenly, he felt warmth spread within him, starting in his stomach and growing outward till his toes and fingertips tingled with it.
“Lemon...lemon...I don’t see anything like that here,” Sam said.
“No,” Cas said, sniffling, cold dread beginning to seep into his bones. “No,
“Very well.” Joshua held out a small bowl full of individually wrapped butterscotches. “Candy?”
After Dean had recovered, he reached into his nightstand and pulled out a bottle of lube and a condom. He pressed them into Castiel’s hand. “Want you in my ass,” Dean ordered. “Don’t worry, I cleaned myself up while you were out.”
Sam thought for a second, then said, “I suppose...maybe I would bring Jess back. Or Eileen. I still miss them. And I wonder if they’d lived...if they’d be happy. If they’d gotten to have their own lives. Not even necessarily with me, but just...alive, and free.”
“No. It was a
Sam flipped through some pages in frustration, looking for another viable option. At the same time, Dean felt the toe of a sensible shoe slowly sliding up the inside of his thigh. Dean looked sharply at Cas, who smiled back, innocent as a lamb as he continued to tease Dean under the table.
Castiel sighed to himself. So far, this was not boding well.
Cas felt his heart sinking, but smiled back nevertheless. “Tell me about...us. Our life,” he entreated quietly.
”Finally worked up the nerve to tell ya how I felt that night before going up against Raphael. When you thought you were gonna die. I definitely didn’t let you die a virgin that night.” Dean laughed. “Got Bobby to officiate a little impromptu ceremony when it looked like Michael and Lucifer were gonna tear the world apart. Sam, Ellen, and Jo were witnesses—that was the night right before Jo and Ellen died.” Dean sadly squeezed Cas’s hand, the one wearing the ring. “Sam thought I was crazy. But if we were going to die, I wanted us to die tied to each other. I knew you were it for me, Cas.
“Because I don’t eat and getting you and Claire to sit still longer than two minutes is impossible?” Cas teased.
Dean did in fact, keep very organized records. It was a relief, really. Most audits went about like swimming through peanut butter. Assessing Dean’s finances was more or less like swimming through...well, not water. No audit could be that easy. Cooking oil, maybe. Or strawberry yogurt.

Edlund paused, then smiled mischievously.

“And your

The angels nearest him, Hannah and Samandriel, visibly cringed. Castiel knew either of them could make 10 stuffed animals in the same amount of time it took him to make just one.
“They were in my pocket the whole time!” Sam said defensively. “She knew how to hotwire.”
. Something small inside Castiel did a hopeful fist pump.
“Hey. Writing is writing,” Charlie chastised. “So...why’d you let Becky change it? Why did you go for the happy ending?”
Dean looked thoughtfully at Cas’s hair, still slightly sticky from the potion (yet somehow still cute—unfair). Not

know he’s going to die, and dies anyway...dies willingly, knowing he could stop it...” Dean shrugged. “You tell me: isn’t that the type of man you want to keep alive?”
Castiel leaned forward and lightly touched his lips to Dean’s throat. “Your heart is racing, Dean,” he breathed as he mouthed a trail of kisses down his neck. “Did you know that when an angel claims a human soul, it leaves a mark?” Castiel covered Dean’s left shoulder with his hand. “Right here,” Castiel said. “This is where I marked you. This proves that you are mine and mine alone.”
Cas giggled. “Okay, Dean, I promise not to die until I’m so old and wrinkled and bald and disgusting that you can’t even look at me anymore.”
“I thought you moved in with us because you ran out of money because you still haven’t finished your next book,” said Sam knowingly. Dean glared daggers at him. “Dean, the least you could do is check him out,” the younger Winchester brother pleaded. “What if he’s the real deal?”
Dean swallowed hard, just barely managing to keep his hands from shaking and splattering coffee everywhere. “Sammy, it’s gotta be a mistake. Cas doesn’t-...he can’t-...what the fuck do I have to offer an
, my mistake,” Dean said, rolling his eyes, pretending to be annoyed. Suddenly, Castiel’s stomach rumbled loudly. “Damn, when’s the last time you ate something?” Dean asked.
Castiel sighed, happy butterflies dancing in his stomach. He looked around the room, drinking in all the wonderfully little Dean-esque touches, when he spotted something hidden partially behind a chair.
“Trust me, you shouldn’t be. You kinda made my night. It’s not all the time a really cute tax accountant tells you he thinks you hung the moon.”
Dean smirked, leaning in to kiss him. “I love you...” Another kiss. “I love you...” Another kiss...
“Huh. I think the blue looked better—goes with your eyes.” Picking up a tray of tools, Dean disappeared behind a 2004 Hyandai.
“I can’t believe you did it,” Charlie said in awe, squeezing past him. “You

Dean swallowed. “Well maybe you should
Gee, I guess I’m in a Burt Reynolds mood tonight.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Geek.”
Dean kissed him again, a little more fiercely. “D’ya mind if I...top?” he asked.
An hour later, the three men and Jack were gathered in the war room, watching as Rowena poured over her spell books and the microscope with Cas’s hair on a slide. “You know I’d have a much easier time with this if you lot weren’t breathing down my neck,” Rowena tutted as she peered into the microscope.
“Of course I’m sure,” Cas said insistently. “Dean,
”Dean...” Cas breathed. “How...long?”
“That’s what I thought.”
“Again, sorry. You okay?”
from Hell?”
, no,” Cas shuddered at the thought of his own
“I can do that, if you’re still interested.”
Castiel slid into his bed and opened the book, taking in the story eagerly. About halfway through, though, his eyes fell shut and he nodded off with the book face down on his chest.
“Yes.”
Castiel muttered. “...not in so many words, anyway.”
This is a story about a man named Castiel Novak, and his wristwatch.

“Wait, how do you know I’m the hero?” Castiel asked.

Cas froze. “You...what did you say?” he whispered.
he thought.
That made Cas feel somewhat better. He smiled faintly.
something-”
Cas showed Dean his phone proudly. “And that’s my new lockscreen photo.”
“Ah, Castiel,” Joshua said, smiling and gesturing grandly to the large beanbag in front of his desk. “Or would you prefer Cassie, maybe?”
“Mmm...what happened?” Castiel moaned.
“No, I meant...” Cas looked mildly annoyed, and Dean grinned cheekily. Guess the angel
Now babies often get adopted so quickly, so it was strange when only one, James, was taken immediately and the other wasn’t. As the days to Christmas Eve grew nearer and nearer, the angel Gabriel became more and more worried for the leftover baby, knowing he’d have to report back to the North Pole soon to get assigned to his new family. But he still felt obligated to his current charge.
As he turned the doorknob and made to leave, Dr. Bradbury said, “Castiel...what
“No and no.” Castiel had lost count of how many times he’d said “no”.
“‘Kay then.” Charlie crossed her legs and peered deep into his eyes. “Let us begin.”
that.” Suddenly Cas’s eyes widened. “Look out!” He pushed Dean out of the way and staked another vampire that had been zeroing in on Dean’s neck. “The only one who gets to bite Dean is me,” Cas growled.
The next morning he woke up to find the book on the nightstand beside him with a bookmark holding his place, and the covers pulled up over him.
“Does that mean-?”
“In Italy?” Claire said, crossing her arms suspiciously.
“Oh, yes sir, absolutely,” said Naomi in that tone of voice that every middle manager takes on when they don’t really agree with their boss but they’re hoping their troubles will get them a boost on the corporate ladder.
“Lying in bed sick is not a vacation. You’ve got a lot of time saved up. I’m recommending you use some of it.”
After dessert, Claire and Jack headed off to their rooms, big smiles on their faces. Dean helped Cas clear the table and wash the dishes.
Dean moaned in response, letting himself drown in the sensations of his own body wrapped around him.
Suddenly Dean hissed, jerking his hand back, breaking the kiss. Blood dribbled from a small wound on his middle finger—the culprit was a small shard of glass hidden in Cas’s hair.
“Two people Dean fell for,

“I’m glad
expected.
“Yeah, okay, you might have inspired the purchase,” Dean said, blushing. “But for the record, I haven’t used it yet. It’s brand new, out of the box, and it’s been washed. I am gonna wear a condom on it though, makes for easier clean-up.”
the heroes.”
,” Cas sighed as Dean settled inside him. The dildo was about six inches long, just about the perfect size to be satisfying but still comfortable. It was also made of a softer silicone so it bended and molded more easily. “Feels good,” Cas murmured.
After their late lunch-breakfast, Cas asked Dean, “Don’t you have to go to the garage?”
Castiel flushed, realizing he was pestering her. “Never mind.” He took a sidestep away from her and remained mindful of any involuntary shoe-rocking until the bus finally rolled to a halt in front of his patch of concrete.
“Maybe it’s an enchanted forest,” said Cas dreamily. “With talking deer and birds who help Nathan on his way through the woods.”
What? No, this last chapter wasn’t a total callout for the Supernatural showrunners, what gave you that idea? *looks pointedly into the camera*
not supposed to get involved with the people I audit...I mean that would be worse than the gift-giving thing...but I don’t care. I just want you.” Castiel took a deep breath, suddenly feeling light-headed. “So there...I’ve said my...piece...”
Now he had his answer.
“Hey, Novak,” said Balthazar, putting a friendly hand on his shoulder. “What’s 69 times 420?” He looked at Gabriel and the pair snickered. The two resident jokesters of the office were rarely seen apart at work, and Castiel wondered if they ever got any work done at all.
“No, he’s mad at me. But I’m worried I may have just made things weird for you two.” Sam frowned apologetically at Castiel.
“Who are you?” he growled, hoping to sound menacing.
Castiel chuckled, moving to Dean’s (Cas’s) neck. He started sucking kisses down his throat, hard enough to leave lasting hickies on human skin, but not angel skin. Angel skin healed itself right up, a decent hickie disappearing in five minutes. “I suppose I’m just marking myself up, hmm?” Cas murmured in Dean’s ear. “I wish you could leave marks on my body, Dean. I love the thought of being utterly owned by you, the same way I own you.”
you.”
“I never told Castiel my mom’s name. If you created him, then you know everything he knows. But if you created me too, then you know my mother’s name. So what is it?”
Cas huffed, folding his arms. “Is that all I am to you?”
“15 years ago, my late wife, God rest her soul, was expecting a baby. We were so happy. We even had a name picked out: Castiel. We thought since our son was a gift from God, we should him give a Biblical name. We chose one of the more obscure angel names, Cassiel, but modified it a little. We liked the sound of Castiel.
Dean blindly felt around for the lube as he and Cas kissed again. Then his trembling hands popped the cap and got his fingers slicked up. As he eased the first digits inside of his own tight hole, he thought to himself,
“‘Hey Jude,’” Chuck answered promptly.
Dean chuckled, blushing slightly. “You better not go dyin’ on me anytime soon, dork,” he murmured affectionately, as he leaned forward and
Castiel’s blood ran cold at that.
“Dude, stop, that’s weird!” Dean grouched.
Cas stared at his boyfriend and smiled. “He is.”
“Don’t tell anyone you heard it from me,” Michael was saying, “but Santa is getting ready to retire after this Christmas, and I am
Dean kissed him sweetly. “I doubt that’s possible.”
“Aw, why does
Dean huffed out a breath, then rolled his eyes. “Fine.”
“M-Mr. Winchester,” Castiel replied, that charmingly roguish smile knocking the wind of his lungs and evaporating any confidence he’d felt this morning when getting dressed. How
Cas honest-to-Chuck pouted. “You should’ve let him keep the shirt on, Sam.”
Castiel blinked. “But if you don’t have a penis, then how can you...?”
“To be honest...neither did I,” Cas said, dazed. What had happened? Chuck

you?” Dean groaned.
“Love making you come apart for me, sweetheart,” said Dean huskily, kissing and nibbling Cas’s neck. “Definitely gonna make you come again after dinner, maybe twice if you got it in you. So pretty when you’re beggin’ for it. So gorgeous, just for me.”
“Excuse me,” Castiel said, turning to the bored-looking woman standing beside him. “Did you just say something about my shoes?”
“I see...you coming here isn’t a work related thing,” Dean said.
“Oh, Castiel.” Joshua shook his head. “You aren’t the first person to catch a case of the old ‘cubicle fever.’ It’s nothing to be ashamed of, even if it’s making you hear voices.”
And like that, Castiel was inducted into the life of the Christmas angels. He grew up at the normal human rate, which felt like both a blip and an eternity to his angel guardian. See, time feels different to an angel since they’re immortal, but angels are never really born, they’re just created, fully formed, so they never grow up. So it was pretty hard for little Castiel, having no kids to play with as a kid. Then again, there were no snot-nose kid angels around to mock him about his lack of wings, so maybe it was for the best. Castiel never questioned why he had no wings, assuming they would grow in when he reached adulthood.
Cas was happy to oblige, having waited patiently all this time. He draped himself over Dean’s muscular back and clung to his shoulders, thrusting into him over and over.
Cas deflated slightly. “Oh. I see.”
Sam raised a knowing eyebrow. “You sure about that?”
voice,” Castiel insisted.
“You should be nicer to each other,” Jack lectured them. “You’re best friends.”
Dean crossed his arms and looked at the floor. “Say, uh...I’m takin’ a break, gonna walk down the street to my buddy Garth’s bakery to get somethin’ to munch on, maybe get a cappuccino or some frou-frou drink like that. Since you’re all finished here...why don’t you come with me? My treat, anything you want.”
was true happiness.
“If you want, you can always call me an...
”Hell yes, now you’re speakin’ my language,” Dean said. “Who’s playing?”
Dean began to sweat nervously, and he felt his cock swell in his jeans.
The next morning, Dean entered the kitchen and did not find another glorious stack of IHOP pancakes awaiting him. No Cas either. Guess the potion had finally worn off and he was making himself scarce out of embarrassment.
“Rowena?! Oh great,
That place wasn’t special. He knew he had so much more to give. “Surely there’s a family out there I could watch ov-”
“Shut up,” Cas whispered.
“Castiel...I don’t
“Come on, man, you’ll wrinkle up your nice clothes. Here...” Dean dug around in the duffel bag by the foot of his bed. “You can wear these,” he said, giving him a pair of flannel pajama pants and a worn tee shirt.
“I can, and I have. Fight me all you wish, my little human, but it is an irrefutable fact that you belong to me.” Castiel smirked at Dean, stroking the back of his hand over Dean’s cheek. “A fact you will come to realize by the time we’re through tonight.”
Dean felt a rush of exhilaration as he kicked the door down with his boot. “Rise and shine, boys!” he crowed.
“Is this about your job? Cas, the audit’s basically over, I don’t think you have to worry about-”
“And?” Cas gently promptly.
“Which should be considered a fucking war crime,” Dean added, rolling his eyes.
It was Dean Winchester’s vivid green eyes gazing at him with unadulterated love on the couch beside him. It was Dean’s warm hip pressed against his and his arm casually thrown around his shoulders, as if there was no need to put distance between them. It was the twin bands of gold circling their ring fingers. Cas had been in love with the hunter for so long and so much that it had simply become a fact of nature. Grass was green. Weight equaled mass times gravity. Castiel loved Dean Winchester. The angel felt so stupid. How could his heart’s desire be anything else?
“Look, first thing’s first: I know you’re planning on killing me,” Castiel said quickly. “And now that you know that I exist...I’m asking you
Castiel remembered getting caught staring like an idiot at Dean Winchester’s naked torso, almost breaking down into tears in front of him, and making a complete ass of himself when he tripped over the toolbox. He cringed. “It was...pretty disastrous.”
“Oh, baby,” Dean said softly, pulling him into a tight embrace. Cas clung to him, burying his nose in his motor oil stained shirt and breathing in his soap and his sweat. “I love you too,” Dean muttered, rubbing his back.
Castiel thanked her for all her help and left the store feeling more determined than he had in his whole life.
Still basking in the afterglow, they crawled onto the bed and got under the covers, clinging to each other’s (well, their own) sweaty bodies desperately. Dean kissed Cas on the forehead. “Damn kinky angel,” he mumbled, drawing a giggle from Cas. It was definitely a Cas giggle. Dean
“I have wanted you,” Dean growled between their lips meeting, all wet and messy, over and over, “since the moment you walked into my garage.”
“Gabriel, what in the Christmas have you done?!” exclaimed Santa when he arrived with that gurgling mass of blankets in his arms. She looked mad enough to have kittens.
“Dean’s big on sweets,” Sam said. “He’s had to have our dentist friend Garth give him three fillings.”
Dean bit his lip. Then he looked at Chuck. “What song did my mom sing to me when I was young?” he asked quietly. “Before she died.”
. Castiel wanted to cry.
Holy shit, he had freckles on his hips too, he realized, not just his face. How was that even possible, his bare hips never saw direct sunlight.
Suddenly Dean found himself shoved back against the bookcase by enthusiastic angel strength and hot angel lips pressed up against his.
“No one, oh, I need your cock in me, baby,” Dean whined, arousal quickly building and building inside him.
Castiel could think about.
“You do own a mirror, right?” Cas asked, making Dean laugh and lean down to kiss him as he continued to move in and out of him, fucking him with a steady rhythm. They kissed and caressed as Cas continued to make noises of contentment. One nice thing about using a toy was that a toy didn’t run out of stamina, so they could take their time. Dean sucked on Cas’s neck and Cas suspected he would have a mark there tomorrow. The old Cas would have protested about the impropriety of having a hickey on one’s neck, but the new Cas was thrilled to be marked by Dean.
Just then, Mary and Jack appeared in the doorway. “Please tell me you guys went grocery shopping, I’m
“Thanks, Jack. But you should probably go to bed. This is going to be boring adult stuff,” said Sam.
“Good morning, Dean,” said Cas, kissing Dean’s cheek (was this going to be a thing now?). “I was starting to think you were going to sleep all day. I’ve been using my grace to keep your breakfast warm.”
Cas checked the digital alarm clock on Dean’s bedside table. “Roughly...19 hours?”
“Uh, sorry, I meant, 28,980,” Castiel corrected himself with a blush, then hurried away. His coworkers shared a surprised look. Castiel was
he sang, smiling shyly as he set the tray on Dean’s lap.
“Nope. It was definitely whitish-purple. Or maybe silvery purple. Like a pearl, kinda,” Dean said.
A third party appeared behind them. “Same here!”
Cas looked at Dean hawkishly. “What?”
” Dean roared angrily, hugging Cas to his chest tighter, as if someone was trying to physically take him away. “I don’t care what it is, they can’t have him! There’s gotta be another way!” He glared at Chuck. “You write some way out of this, you owe him that!”
“Hey, stop that,” Dean said, putting his arm around him. “You are
Castiel repeated in disbelief. “I’m homeless, heartbroken, and I’m going to die soon!”
.” He turned to Sam menacingly. “That photo gets out? You’re waking up with a mullet.”
Another thing everyone gets wrong: Santa is an old fat guy with a white beard. Santa can come in any size, shape, color, age, or even gender. See, Santa’s kind of like a title. It gets passed down from person to person. At the time, this Santa was a beautiful lady with dark hair, dark eyes, dark skin, and a commanding voice that gets everyone’s attention when it’s raised. This Santa may not have been the holly jolly type, but she cared, deeply, that Christmas went exactly right, that every child got the toys they deserved on Christmas. And a rogue human baby at the North Pole was

trying to project their masculinity, weren’t they?
The mechanic gasped, jerking around to see who was there, then exhaled when he spied Castiel standing there. “Mr. Novak...you ditched the trenchcoat, I see.”
Oh. The handsome man was Dean’s
“Interesting,” said the media professor, tapping her lips thoughtfully. “Well...I wish I could help you, but this is a little out of my wheelhouse.”
He didn’t know it, but leaving his hair fluffed up and slightly sleep-tousled as it was now was much more flattering on him than his usual corporate comb over.
The thing looked down casually at the knife handle now protruding from his chest, then back up at Dean, almost in amusement. He wrapped his fingers around the handle and slowly pulled it from his chest, never breaking eye contact, and dropped the knife on the ground, the clattering sound echoing around the barn’s metal walls.
Dean flipped on the lights and led Cas over to the bed, sitting them both down. He seemed...tense. Dean took a deep breath and pulled his shirt off. There were those gorgeous muscles Cas had so admired the first time they met. He was practically salivating.
James Novak was indeed the spitting image of Castiel, from his square jaw to his stubby fingers to his crystal blue eyes. The tax accountant tended to wear his hair a bit shorter and more neatly combed than the often disheveled Castiel, but other than that, you could never tell them apart just by looking at them.
. Cas had, of course, always considered Claire and Jack his children to a certain extent, but now, seeing the two of them and Dean, waiting patiently for him with their arms outstretched, Cas felt his heart swell with emotion. He rose from his stool and let them wrap their arms around him, and squeezed them tight.
“It’s been a long ten seconds. If the narrator said
“I had to stop filing,” Castiel said, squeezing his eyes shut. “So he would stop
“Chuck Shurley?” Castiel said.
“And me!” Dean piped up, feeling...strangely pumped. Maybe it was because he’d been cooped up in the bunker worrying about Cas and the potion and now he was finally getting some action. Speaking of action...
“Great idea Sammy, best way to look for clues.” Dean says.
“How did you find us?” Castiel says.
Castiel's eyelids open like the shrug of the universe. Weighty, salt crusted, and painful. Jack stands above him, haloed by cloudbursts and sunlight.
“I thought Dean said spinach was ‘rabbit food’.”
Dean’s ASL still isn’t very good, but Eileen very politely fingerspells “
Three build-it-yourself garden boxes show up in a Lowe’s truck one day, the delivery driver looking harried as he complains about confusing directions and dirt roads that just end. Castiel nods solemnly as he speaks, and doesn’t take a word of it in. Two days of trying to put them together leaves him with sixteen splinters, a broken thumb, and a permanent ban from any tools in the bunker. He spends the third day after they arrive sorting through seeds and perennials, watching on as Dean shows Jack how to not slam a hammer into your own hand on the very first go. There’s a tension in Dean as he hovers, the grip of his boots twitching in the gravel on every downswing of Jack’s arm, a flipbook pose back and forth as he firmly plants his arms on his hips, then crosses them in front of his chest, before he switches again with idly twitching fingers. Castiel, however, lets a suffusion of the late winter breeze, early smells of unbudded flowers, and the carry of Dean’s “Look. No you’ve got it. Yeah. Just, don’t put your hand there. Careful. Careful!” sink into him.
Sam wakes up at 5:30 in the morning for his runs, greets Dean in the kitchen at 6:30 for early morning breakfasts of granola and scrambled eggs, respectively. By 8:00, Dean is hunched over some rusted spark plugs of a gutted out Honda at the shop, and Jack will wander into the kitchen, leftover granola and scrambled eggs already plated out for Castiel, Eileen, and him.
“I guess.” Dean shifts in his seat, looks to the passing cut of canola and corn fields, an exaggerated discomfort once again finding its way up his spine.
“High schoolers are very cruel, Dean. I’ve seen Carrie.”
“What? What’s wrong.”
Sam glances between the two of them, never quite used to the way they’ll continue a conversation like they’re the only two there, “We were cutting back. One or two a month, nothing that was more than a 5 hour drive away.”
“Chuck was… not known for telling the truth. The universe we were living in had been unbalanced for millennia. That power… it was older than Chuck. The all consuming nature of it couldn’t exist in one being, even with someone like Amara as a counterweight. I think it was waiting to be given up.”
Who is this.
“You good in there?” Dean leans into the bathroom, body angled and ready to beat a quick retreat.
” and Castiel smiles at him, gentle and fond. Dean heads for the car, eyes fixed ahead.
” Eileen’s fingers pry the plastic clamshell open, the tips of her nails staining as she plucks a raspberry out. “
“Well I was going to get some curly fries. But I’m starting to think that’s not something they carry here.” Dean motions vaguely at a display filled with starch-free, salt-free chips. “Ok then, what do we got.” He shakes the list out, “Why the fuck does he want brown rice? I’m getting white rice.”
Jack is halfway to the Ford already, trailing within arms reach of Castiel. He glances to Dean, but Dean’s preoccupied, a silent exchange of head tilts and firm nods passing between him and Castiel. Sam and Eileen have taken up a similar kind of inferred conversation. Finally the four of them all turn to look at Jack at once, an almost synchronized turn of heads.
“You’re the one that asked!” Sam says, straining to be heard.
He says it like an eventuality. Castiel swallows the ‘Never’ before it can form. He places the ruined cookware back into the overfull sink and watches the waves that peak around it. Eyes following the steady rise and fall of the sudsy water, he lets his breath match the movement. He turns and the ‘Not yet’ gets caught as well. Jack is squinting at the fine print of a cereal box that got left on the table.
“Well, now’s as good of a time as any for her to start playing nice again.”
10:46 am
“But we can do more than research. We can…” Jack trails off, trying to condense everything they used to do into a new framework, “Keep people safe.”
The door handle is still loosely gripped in Jack’s hand, forgotten as he tries to keep up with what’s going on, “They don’t know?”
“If he picked and chose favourites?”
“Cas?” Dean turns to look at him.
The front wheel of their cart is screaming out a teeth grinding psalm, it’s rhythm matching to the quake of rocksalt over pavement. “Yes.” Castiel says as he leans the weight back, tries to unbalance the whole thing for a moment of silence.
“What about me? What have I earned.” Jack looks at Castiel, the soft creases of his face making their best attempt to firm into something challenging and serious.
Still though, when he fills his mug in the morning he thinks about thresholds, the surface tension of liquid as it holds back from cascading past the rim and leaving meandering patterns on his wrist. He’s spent years testing Dean’s point of brimming, inadvertently for the most part. For years their interactions like drips from the carafe measured against Dean’s willingness to close his eyes to anything that might upset his status quo.
“I died.” He’s done it enough to know the trappings of it. He knows what last breaths and final regrets feel like. The comfort of despair more familiar than the trenchcoat with permanent creases marking the every bend of his vessel.
Castiel reaches past him and pulls a bag of long grain wild rice off the shelf. “You don’t eat rice.”
One week later they break the lease and move into a bigger place, as Castiel and Jack learn that most human fathers and sons actually prefer to have separate bedrooms, and single room motels are an exception not the norm to sleeping arrangements. Especially when it turns out certain ex-half-angel-gods snore.
“Sam said that Chuck showed him a vision of a future without god. He said that the universe was thrown out of order and that our world ended in chaos. Or at the very least all of our lives.”
“We uhhh…” Sam trails off.
“You guys are also always welcome back at the bunker. It was your home as well.” Sam says. Dean nods along jerkily, the shake and pop of pressure building in him around words that won’t form sentences.
And Castiel feels his resolve weaken.
The moment has passed.
for responding at 10pm to my desperate plea for line edits and a full walkthrough on how to use AO3's UI.
The leather on the steering wheel of the Impala is cracked. Hairline fractures that start in the crease of the seams and radiate the circumference, rings of a tree reminding Dean of the age of his car. An oppressive sort of silence weighs heavy as they push 80 mph down the freeway, spiderweb thin fissures in a pane of glass pressing down onto the both of them.
“I’m not! Well, not anymore.” Jack holds up his hands, as proof and in surrender of Dean’s quickly rising anger.
Jack stays silent.
“How old do you think I am?”
Castiel finds a patch of gray hair three months after moving back into the bunker.
So he calls a mechanic. Dean had always taken care of the upkeep of the impala, and said “All mechanics are thieves, they’re out there charging you a 500% markup on a serpentine belt, and then installing it with next to no tools in 30 seconds. If I wanted to get fucked that bad I’d ask out Crowley”. The garage he finds online is a little ways out of town, but it’s only got one review that’s not five stars which just reads “Owner told me to fuck off when I asked him to change my windshield fluid.” so it seems like a good bet. The kind of mechanic Dean would approve of. The number dials and Castiel sits perched at the kitchen table, the sharp staccato ring innocently connecting his call.
Dean shuffles into the bathroom, his arm just shy of pressing up against Castiel’s, the rough of flannel brushing into the knit of a light brown two-for-one-sale Target sweater. He reaches past Castiel, straightens a toothbrush, rubs his finger through the gathered dust at the back of the sink. “I mean, technically he’s four, physically he’s like maybe twenty-two, and mentally he ranges from three to teen-angst to however the hell old god is. It’s like some sort of shitty riddle.” He catches Castiel’s eyes in the mirror with a quick grin.
The pulse of Castiel’s heart sounds louder in his ears at that. The crush of his vertebrae should have been the first hint, the ache of back pain being so uniquely human. “What’s happened, Jack?”
“Ok. I don’t like broccoli though. Or peas. Or brussel sprouts.” Jack says.
Sorry this chapter is a little shorter and not much happens! Plot-like things will happen next chapter (And Claire’s finally gonna show up!), but ultimately this fic is just me meandering through small character interactions I want to see. So.
Castiel sleeps late most mornings. His first time around as a human, he’d woken to the sharp cut of sun rays streaming in through the Gas-’N-Sip’s backroom two-by-nothing window. It’s both better and worse now. The soul deep unforgiving blackout of an underground bunker, letting him sleep late, while he fights off any night terrors of viscous unlifelike goo pouring from the wall of the dungeon.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well-”
“I know the choice was his. To become human. To end up in a world where everything he does becomes a choice instead of just Being. And I know that’s what we’ve been fighting for the whole time, but...” Castiel knows what it is to have a plan laid out for you, he knows the comfort that can be found in the claustrophobia of it, and in turn the agoraphobic directionlessness of free will. “I just want him to have options.”
Before existential dread can set in, each of them folds the thought up like freshly cleaned sheets. Tucking them into linen closets that have collectively spent 60 plus years packed full of any desperate thought they weren’t ready to starch and iron.
“It’s… With everything that happened with Jack. When he was born. With mom and then… trying to take out Chuck. I just….” The rub of his palm down the side of his face grounds him, just for a second. “Do you think Cas wants to keep Jack away because he knows I’ll fuck him up more.”
“Jack! What’s going-” Sam says.
Dean matches Castiel and steps back, a pull against their orbit. In recent years Castiel has noticed the way the two of them fall in line with each other, like mirrored dancers or soldiers at war. They’ve learned the unspoken casualties of each other, gotten better at anticipating.
“So you gave it up for balance?” Castiel says.
The bite and hold of February is giving way to spring in Kansas, the arid rub of sunlight reflecting off the mirror finishing on the Impala. It’s still too cold for rolled down windows, but Dean is stubborn, shivering through the whip of wind in the car.
“I wasn’t sure how to tell you. I was going to-”
“All of the parenting books say socialization with kids his own age is important,” Castiel says.
“What, another best friend return from the dead and dial the wrong number?” Dean says.
“I’m… ok. It...” Jack says, “It seemed like you had something you wanted to talk about.”
” She smiles at Castiel, a knowing sliver of a look, “
“I know. I couldn’t….” Wind kicks up behind them, a slight shiver working its way through Jack, “I couldn’t leave you there. I know it wasn’t my decision to make.”
“Huh. She’s topside?”
Dean reaches out, a gentle grip on Jack’s arm, “You
The front entryway is cramped, but Castiel stands neatly tucked into the gap between wall hooks and the radiator as Dean and Sam pull their boots on. A distant soundtrack of Jack bumping plates together as he finishes off the dishes. There’s the sharp chirp from Sam's pocket of an incoming call, and he excuses himself back down the hall as he answers.
“When do we get to go see Sam and Dean?”
“It seems like it would be worth more than twenty five cents.” Jack says.
“No… I mean…”
, uh,” Sam grabs a pear. He bites a quarter sized piece off, and gestures with the fruit, letting juice flick across the aisle. “
Castiel opens his mouth, madlibs excuse primed. ‘Thank you for the invitation but since we (verb) the (adjective) (noun) here, and Jack is now involved in (local activity) it would be best for us to stay here.’
Castiel shifts back, out of range. “He can’t exactly go to high school.”
“What?”
“That’s a good observation Jack.” Castiel agrees. “Did you want to push the cart?”
“You’re alive.” Dean says.
He’s waiting for the shift, for the moment of calamity. Even just for Dean to pat Castiel on the arm in full view of Sam, Jack, Eileen, and whatever last vestiges there are of a god with a “You’re like a brother to me,” and an uncomfortable look on his face. If Dean never wants to mention it again, Castiel will understand, he’ll adapt. Some kind of a sign that the spilling point has been reached would be nice.
“Did I miss something?” Garcia asked when nobody responded to her.
“I can’t hold Jack, but I can hold you and your brother,” Derek said, raising his gun.
“I don’t remember. My head was hurting.”
The atmosphere was tense now, she had to turn it around somehow, “What other rules did your parents set?”
Dean looked at Sam, a knowing look in his face, “Okay. Tell your men not to stress him out. He could … lash out if he feels threatened. Just wait for us and we’ll talk to him. We’re on our way.”
“Nice? They held you captive.” Dean argued, “I’m taking you out. We are going home.”
“Did they leave you alone?”
Derek burst into the room, grabbing onto Emily and holding her steady, pulling her out of the room. It was quieter but the ringing could still be heard from inside. The fixtures on the walls were swaying.
Emily took a chance, “Wait a minute. We still have questions. Like what happened to Jack, and why he was found at a scene of a crime. He’s still a suspect and if he walks out of here, his picture will be passed to all authorities and everyone will be on the lookout for him. It’s hard to do your job if the police have your pictures in the database right?”
“Sam and Dean Winchester. They are legally dead. They have records ranging from credit card fraud, impersonation of a federal agent, all the way to murder. They have a whole list. Dean Winchester apparently died several times but none of them stuck. Partner is Sam Winchester, his brother who is 4 years younger. Sam went to Stanford but in his last year, he quit. Didn’t show up to the interview. I can compile the files and send them to you guys. It’s an extensive list. You guys might want to see for yourselves.”
Jack nodded, “I couldn’t get my powers under control. What if one day I just explode and I hurt you? Or Dean? Or Cas?”
The woman fiddled with the paper she came in with. She took out a photograph and showed it to him.
“Okay. Good. Now focus. What caused them to hurt like this?”
“I was walking around. Never been here before, I was lost and he said he could help me. I followed him to his car and he injected me with something. I was knocked out. I didn’t even know it was possible.”
“So when did your mum … leave you with your dad?” She urged him on, trying to get more background on a boy that is seemingly no one.
“Hey Jack, I’ve called your parents and they’re on the way here right now.”
“He’s ok. Just a bit shaken up.”
"How about your dad?" Emily brought his attention back.
“They’re all my dads. Castiel is my dad, Dean is Cas’ boyfriend. They don’t know it yet. Sam is like my third dad. He’s nicer to me than Dean was at the beginning.”
Jack looked confused but followed his lead.
“I don’t know. It was sad. I just wanted to help. They were screaming. They were so loud.” Jack started rocking in the chair, “They were screaming right in my ear. It might even be louder than angel radio. Like they were in my head. Make it stop. Make it stop!”
“You can say it now. What do you think he did?”
The police were still on the lookout for their kidnapper, any extra manpower was setting up all their rooms for the Winchester’s arrival. They were told to stand by, at the ready in case anything goes haywire. They were all anxiously waiting for the arrival of the two criminals.
“I did it before, but with demons. Imagine it is a little different though.” Sam smiled at Jack, “Now I’m going to talk to the agents here. You try to relax, okay?”
“Yeah but you can save yourself by not rushing in all the time. You die, who else is there to save people?”
“Our talk with Dean Winchester shows that he believes that Jack is also unstable. Warning us not to stress Jack out. Jack could have a disorder that causes him to become violent in stressful situations.” Emily deduced, trying to link the Winchesters to Jack, “The disorder could be what attracted the Winchesters to Jack in the first place. They feel the need to protect him.”
If Emily seemed shocked, she hid it well, as she continued to probe, “What did you do, Jack?”
“What’s going on? An earthquake?”
“They want to get out. Let them out!” Jack covered his ears, trying to block out the sound in the quiet interrogation room.
“Okay.” Jack said in a small voice, "but let's just go. So no one gets hurt."
“Thanks, Garcia.”
Emily walked out to call Garcia.
“The way the boy was standing and the things he said. He said he did this, it doesn’t fit the profile. He might have killed this guy but it’s not the killer we were after.”
Jack messed up. He did not mean to.
“There has to be something we’re not getting here. What kind of weapon leaves a burn like that?” Derek asked out loud.
“Was there anyone else there?”
“Alright. Widen the search, see what comes up.”
Dean, Sam and Castiel got into the car first as Jack protected them. Jack went in last and they drove off immediately after the door closed, leaving the agents mystified.
“Hey, hey, hey. What’s up?” Emily tried to bring Jack back from his mind.
“Let’s just hope the interrogation gives us something more than just a confession.”
Dean heaved a sigh of relief, “Thank God. Take him and let’s get out of here.”
“I see. What happened Jack?”
Meeting everybody back at the conference room, they shared their gathered information.
“It’s alright, Jack. Sometimes we do things that hurt others, but it’s okay. We can learn from our mistakes and try not to make them again. Right?” Jack kept quiet, Emily could tell that he regrets what had happened.
“We don’t think. He confessed. He had been found standing over a dead body and admitted to killing him.”
“Possibly. Based on how he is acting right now, and what he said when we arrested him, Jack could have a personality disorder. Some people with DID don’t remember their alters’ and could be accompanied by headaches when they switch personalities.”
“Do you recognise this person?”
“Nothing.” Jack sat back on his chair.
“Hey kid, next time, leave the serial killers to the experts,” Dean remarked.
Prentiss looked at Spencer, “He could be a victim and decided to fight back. Makes sense.”
“Hey Jack, do you remember what you were doing before all this?”
Aaron took this moment to step up, “Any information you can get out of Jack would be useful.” He directed them back into the room.
Derek stopped Dean from exiting. They stood eye to eye, staring each other down, sizing each other up.
“How’d you know how to do that?”
Rossi went around the body and looked around, “The body fell flat on the ground after the fact, there’s no sign of burns on the ground. No signs that any equipment was brought here. He must have been held up somewhere while he was being burned.”
“Are you ready Jack? Time to practice.” Dean told Jack.
“No, but I felt something. They were watching. Waiting for someone to help them too.”
Dean slammed the trunk closed and headed to the driver’s seat, ending the conversation. The drive back was a silent one, not even music was playing. They all got a shock when Dean’s phone rang with Jack’s number.
“Dean,” Sam said.
“Can I call my dad?” Jack asked, not answering the question.
Derek nodded and followed, opening the door to see Sam crouched in front of Jack again, speaking in a soft voice. Dean was leaning on the far wall, his arms crossed.
“They look nice.”
“Well, your records are coming up in three, two … this is weird. Like mega weird. This kid has no record. He’s either lying about his identity, or he doesn’t exist.”
“Not just the burns, the entire scene was weird. With what we know and what he said when we arrived, it seems like a closed case and it has no link to our kidnappings. He doesn’t match our profile. Our unsub is intelligent and organised, probably in his late forties, his kidnappings were spread out over five years. Victims all boys in their teens, brown hair, similar body structure. This boy wouldn’t even be older than me and according to what Prentiss got from him, he is still a child. Judging from his age, he seem to have some kind of disability, that's why he still listens to his parents religiously and is innocently naïve. He seems to be more like the other victims than our unsub.” Spencer ranted off.
“How old are you, Jack?”
“Hi, my name is Emily. Would you tell me your name?” The woman seemed nice.
Aaron gave out the orders and everyone went to get ready for the Winchesters’ arrival. There were so many inconsistencies in their profile, the most they can do is to be prepared for anything.
Castiel was quiet, just observing the exchange. As the trembles slowly stopped, he looked around the room for any other dangers.
Sam waited a while for Jack to nod, “Good, good. Now listen Jack, we can help remember? These voices will stop when they move on. They can’t right now and you’re the only one who can help them. Remember our training?”
“Where are your parents, Jack?” Emily asked.
“Yes.”
“We’re going, Sammy. Get your butt up and we’re going home. They have their story. It was self-defence. You can’t hold Jack here.”
Sam looked surprised at that and asked, “Are you sure? What did he inject you with?”
“There’s a profile that the previous FBI agents assigned to their case created but not everything fits. Says that Dean Winchester is the dominant, raised by his father with a military background. He has been raised as a soldier, confronting him would lead him to respond aggressively. Sam, on the other hand, is the submissive. Dean protects him, we have to get past Dean to get to Sam. Both were raised to believe in supernatural creatures. Shapeshifters, wendigos, monsters that go bump in the night. They adopted the delusion and would kill anyone they suspect of that.”
Aaron looked at Derek, “Don’t let them leave the building. If they seem like they’re planning an escape, stop them.”
“And your grace just came out and burned him. It’s fine, Jack. It was an accident. He was a bad man, right? He won’t hurt you or anyone else again.” Sam took Jack’s hands in his, wanting to comfort him.
“You heard the story, now we’ll be going now.”
“Jack, what are they saying?”
As they left the station, the police gave the signal and fired. Instinctively, Jack put his hand out in front of him, stopping the bullets and dropping them onto the floor as they headed towards the impala.
“Yes. They’re right behind you. All around us.”
“Well from what I saw, she was gonna die so I stepped in. Now she’s injured but dandy.”
The agents were stunned as the purr of the impala faded into the distance. A phone rang in the silence, Derek answered to a bright voice at the other end.
Dean took a moment to consider, they are out now. Now the FBI knows that they’re not dead, they’ll be hunted down and their future hunts would be affected.
Jack shook his head, “Am I supposed to?”
“Kelly. Her name is Kelly.”
Dean hung up the phone and pressed harder on the gas.
“There has to be some Jack Kline in the world Garcia.”
“Is Jack in that room?” Sam asked as he headed towards the door, sheathing his knife.
Jack nodded once again. Emily and Derek looked at each other, suspicious of what ‘training’ could have meant if it came from the Winchesters.
Cas found that the sleep clothes Dean had given him were very comfortable indeed. After he was dressed, he re-emerged from the bathroom to find Dean absorbed in his computer. He looked around awkwardly, trying to think of something to say (or maybe he shouldn’t say anything at all?) when his eyes landed on a stack of brightly colored books. Castiel squinted and saw that all of the spines had “Dean Winchester” stamped on them. “These are the books you've written?” Cas said curiously, picking up the top one.
Cas buried his face in Dean’s chest. “I’m real, Dean. Tell me I’m real,” he sobbed.
Dean cackled with laughter, the sound ringing in Cas’s ears sweeter than any music he’d ever heard. “You’re such a little dork. Come on, baby, we got about 35 minutes ‘fore that timer goes off. We can at least have a
“Your dad’s a sentimental guy,” Dean chuckled, kissing Cas’s forehead. “Don’t hold it against him.”
About an hour later, Sam poked his head into Dean’s room. “We gotta go.”
He pulled a dumbfounded Dean into a tight embrace and used his newly returned wings to fly them both out of there, disappearing just as the Empty reached out its inky black tendril, just as Billie swung her scythe, leaving them to deal with each other.
Silence. Then...
“I see ‘im,” said the foreman, in a Cajun drawl. He called up to Castiel. “Ay, you up there! Can’t you see we’re tearin’ this place down, brother?”
Sam’s eyes widened. “Wait, really? You are?” Castiel nodded and Sam laughed with delight. He certainly seemed the more personable of the Winchester siblings. “That’s amazing! And you said Dean wouldn’t talk to you?”
do it, but I want to hear you admit to what a little cockslut you are.”
“Then you know what to do.”
“A potential bard. Interesting.” Charlie made a note on her legal pad. “Okay...do your parents have a room they’ve never let you enter, like an attic or a storm cellar?”
“I know,” Dean murmured, soothingly kissing his neck. “Pretty amazing, isn’t it? Love the way you split me open, baby.”
Dean gasped, sitting bolt upright in his bed. There was cold sweat beading at his hairline. His own arms wrapped around his frame in an attempt to hold him, calm him down.
Dean’s smile fell a little. “Not that I’m not glad to see you, but...what are you doing here, Novak? I know this ain’t just about a toolbox.”
“It’s a comedy!” Cas exclaimed, bursting into Charlie’s office. “Charlie, it’s a
Gabriel nodded. “I always knew this day would come. You’ll need some things for the trip. Food, money, clothing to keep you warm. Here.” Gabriel pulled a bundle of beige clothing out of the closet and handed it to Castiel. “It’s called a trenchcoat. Humans wear them, apparently. It’s well insulated, I made it myself.”
Dean took a step forward, glaring daggers at Chuck. “And you owe your
“Be my guest,” Dean said, smiling as he sat back down on the couch.
This felt so right. Why had Dean been resisting the urge to kiss Cas for so many years? They should’ve been kissing like this all the time. Hiding his feelings from Cas was stupid. No more. Dean broke the kiss, breathless.
“Yes. What I’m doing, what I’m thinking about.”
,” Naomi said. “Why hasn’t Gabriel told him the truth? I mean...if Castiel hasn’t figured out that he’s a human by now, I don’t believe he ever will.”
Now Dean is on the phone with Jody. He’s blushing a lot.
“It’s okay, buddy, let it all out,” Winchester said soothingly, patting his back. “I’m sorry, I can be a real dick sometimes, ‘specially when it comes to things I’m passionate about.”
Castiel wanted to melt into the floor. He’d never understood that particular expression before, but at this very moment he felt it very apt indeed.
“Wait.” Dean turned green. “He wasn’t narrating when we...?”
“What’s going on?”
Sam looked back and forth between the two of them. “Are you two...flirting?”
“Maybe you are...but so what?”
Castiel nodded solemnly. “I’ll put in a good word with the Boss.” He winked.
Why?”
Cas exhaled sympathetically, taking Dean’s hand. “Dean, I may be as old as creation itself, but the time before I knew you...it’s all a hazy memory to me now. That was a very different Castiel, a Castiel who had no purpose, no agency. It was an existence, nothing more. In many ways, I don’t consider my
“Uh...I don’t know,” Chuck said, shrugging.
“How...how did you know I was expecting to see another person in here with me?” Castiel asked.
“Dean, I...” Castiel could feel a lump welling up in his throat again. “Of course I want to be with you, but...it’s not that simple.”
“I don’t understand that reference.”
Cas smiled. “I don’t need a potion to have the courage to do this.”
“But he’s
John Wayne Gacy...yes. The name was familiar. He was the star of many of those pasta westerns Dean was always making him watch.
So, reluctantly, Castiel told him everything. About the narration, about how crazy it had driven him in the past weeks, how it had delivered news of his impending doom, and how he’d finally just discovered today that the narrator was his very own father, whom they were just about to confront before Dean had shown up. Charlie confirmed everything.
Chuck had a girl working for him, a literary assistant named Becky who helped bring Chuck around. “He hasn’t eaten today,” Becky explained apologetically, patting his cheek softly.
The angel exhaled, feeling all the tension he’d been clinging onto for over a decade dissipate at last.
“Uh, no. Just a regular male voice. American. Nothing out of the ordinary.”
Dean smiled, kissing him once more. “Let’s go home. Sam is gonna be so fucking smug about this.”
“However,
“I don’t know. I have nothing to compare it to. We didn’t eat meat where I come from.”
“Why does this sound like a goodbye,” the hunter asked in a hoarse whisper.
“Not...technically, no, it’s...a grey area,” Castiel said meekly. “It’s not inappropriate to call me by my first name.”
“Remember how gung ho you and Cas were during the fight yesterday? Like you weren’t scared of anything? Well...you weren’t. The potion doesn’t make people fall in love, it takes away their fears, their inhibitions.”
“Uh huh,” said Patty, clearly bored and wishing the odd chatty man beside her would just let her sleep.
Dean let out a muffled “yes” against the pillow.
The next day, Castiel found himself riding cross-country on his way to Lebanon. He stared out the window in delight at the snowy scenery rushing past. “There’s so much snow outside,” he gushed to the woman on the seat next to him, Patty. “Not as much snow as there is at the North Pole of course. But quite a lot.”
“I love being inside you, Dean,” Cas whispered enticingly. “You fit me like a glove. Like you were made just for me. And now you can feel the rapture that I feel when your needy hole takes me. It’s like coming home. It’s so good. Your hot body squeezing me so tight-“
“Tell you what, I preheated the oven when I was in the kitchen. I was gonna pop a lasagna in for dinner—you want in?”
Dean swallowed and squeezed Cas’s hand hard. “But
potion. Rowena told me this morning over text.”
“See, no ink,” Sam said. “It’s legit.”
a sister named Amara.”
“What are you getting at?” Charlie said slowly.
Dean’s entire face fell at the sound of those words. “What?...No. You’re gonna be just fine, okay?”
,” Dean muttered, to which Sam responded with a sharp kick under the table. They didn’t talk about it for the rest of the meal.
you’re going to die?”
Raphael actually laughed out loud at that, and Raphael
that you couldn’t have been raised at the North Pole, right?” Sam said. “I mean the North Pole is too cold to sustain life, except for like, polar bears and seals.”
Cas felt like he was on
Castiel hugged the book to his chest. “May I?”
And it was incredible how marvelous the mundane could really be when one stopped to appreciate it. Things like indie rock concerts...and homemade pancakes...movie nights with a friend...the smell of motor oil...perfectly blue skies...or reading a really good piece of fiction.
“In every single book, people die horribly.
he whispered, tears rolling down his face. He seemed like he was feeling a hundred different emotions at once: anger and fear and relief and joy. “You
The room was silent. Until finally Dean burst out laughing. “‘Just talk to him, Dean. Let him come in. Invite him to stay for dinner.’” Dean looked at his younger brother. “Well congrats, pal, you were right. Cas is my soulmate alright. And he’s also completely Looney Tunes.”
“Obviously. By human standards you’re especially aesthetically pleasing.”
“Take it off, right now!” Sam said.
Contacting the man who had abandoned him as a baby—he’d left for a reason, right? And what would he say if Chuck picked up? “Hello, I’m the son you gave up after your wife died in childbirth, and also I’m the main character of the novel you’re writing; could you please not kill me off?”
Sam smiled. “I knew I liked you for a reason, Castiel.”
the older man in this relationship?” Dean grinned cheekily.
Sam smiled sadly, shaking his head. “It was several years ago, when I was in college, getting ready for law school. I fell for Jessica right away, and we were happy...until one night, when she was driving back from a late night at the library, and a drunk driver plowed into her car. It was...really hard. I thought I’d never find love again, that Jess was it. Then I met Eileen.” Sam shrugged, smiling brightening again. “Happy ending.”
against Dean’s bare ass, and he cried out in surprise. That didn’t
Dean poked his head down from the second story and glared at Sam and Castiel. “I’m a semi-famous author, Sam. Do you know how many kooks have tracked me down in the past and shown up claiming to be my soulmate? Why do you think I moved in with you and Eileen? I had to throw those bloodhounds off the trail!”
Cas’s heart skipped a beat as Dean cradled his jaw, gently coaxing him to look up at him. Dean smiled warmly, and Cas felt his insides turn to pudding. “I’m not gonna laugh,” Dean said softly. “Promise. I just wanna hear you.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Jimmy said, clutching his wife’s hand. “I remember the first time I met Amelia and saw that our marks matched. I knew I was going to have companionship for the rest of my life. We wish you and your soulmate every happiness.”
Dean stared at him for a moment, then went, “Nope,” and slammed the door in his face.
“It’s outside, in the trunk of the-”
“Ugh, don’t quote Morissette in bed, that’s the opposite of sexy.”
Cas and Dean just got back from the library. They’re holding hands!!!
As long as he could remember, Castiel Novak had blanketed himself with routine and isolation, a defense against a world full of possibility and hope...and he’d nearly been smothered by it.
the thousand year-old laughed, pulling his angel toward him by the waist and eagerly digging into some delicious birthday pie.
. He wanted to sink into the hunter. He could almost forget this wasn’t real.
“Oh wow,” said Jack softly. “So
“Okay, THAT IS IT, SHUT UP!
Sam’s nose was, as usual, buried in a book. But it was odd for Sam to bring one of the Bunker’s books with him on a minor errand in town. “Sam? Where’s Dean?”
“Ew. I’m definitely not going to skip brushing my teeth.”
“Yeah,” Dean murmured, drifting off to sleep in his angel’s arms. “Husbands. Love you so much, Cas.”
, man?!”
Gabriel nodded. “Right...me either. Now, uh...scram.”
I’d be climbing the walls with sexual arousal,” Cas said. “As you can see, I’m in perfect control of myself.”
“You did NOT just take a photo of us!” Dean said. “Who did you send that too?!?!”
“I didn’t even notice them. I was too distracted by how absurdly gorgeous you are,” Castiel blurted.
“We agreed we’d never talk about that musical AGAIN.” Dean stomped away.
Dean blushed at that, thinking about all the times before he and Cas had truly, honest to goodness,
Dean was on the floor by this point, howling. “Holy shit, I’m using this stuff for my next book. This is hilarious.”
Sam, Dean, and Castiel looked at her questioningly as she calmly ate a spoonful of vegan chili.
“Aunt Amara?”
Cas looked him in the eye. “And don’t you feel incredible too, Dean? Your tight, hot entrance around you, sucking you in, squeezing you just right? Don’t you feel wonderful? This is how you make me feel all the time, Dean.”
write that,” Chuck gasped. “How did you know that?”
And with that, Castiel waved goodbye over his shoulder to the only home he’d ever had as he headed off to the human world, to find his soulmate, and hopefully, along the way, he would find who he was.
“No. No, ‘cause, you know, if this mojo works like you say, great. If not… why get her hopes up?”
No answer. “Maybe he’s not home?” Charlie suggested.
“Gabriel is the man who raised me,” Castiel replied. “He took me in when my parents died and my twin brother was adopted. I’ve lived with him my whole life.”
about to give you a handjob.” Dean smirked. “Lay back, baby, I’m about to blow your mind—among other things.”
“Linda Tran, of
” Castiel cried, once again drawing strange looks from other people on the street. “Am...am I going to
“Then play that song.”
Claire had never called Cas that before. That was a title reserved for James Novak only. “Claire, are you feeling alright?” Cas asked.
“Well I’m not gonna tell anyone if you won’t.”
“Benny,” said Dean loudly, making Sam and Castiel both jump in surprise as they turned to see Dean leaning in the doorway with his arms crossed, “was my boyfriend until he met his soulmate Andrea a year ago. We tried to make a poly thing work, but Andrea wasn’t interested in sharing her soulmate, so I gracefully bowed out. End of story.” Dean leveled a look at Sam. “Any of my other personal business you wanna share, Samantha?”
That fateful morning when Castiel had first heard Chuck’s voice...that was the first moment he existed.
I could have planned for a different outcome! Now I think it could be too late!”
Dean took one look at the car and glared at Sam. “The fuck did you do?!”
“Dean...maybe the pearl not working wasn’t your fault. Perhaps...someone else used the wish before it got to you.” Cas’s eyes darted nervously around the Dean Cave.
“Yeah, well,” Cas sighed. “People do crazy things...” He smiled. “When they’re in love.”
“Cas?” Dean whispered, taking a step back in concern. “Your eyes...they’re-”
tell me that’s not his kink.”
“Where would I find a person like that?”
“You look so damn sexy,” Dean said, beginning to rock back and forth. “Hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”
Dean glared at it. “What are you?”
“Honestly?...I’m here because...” Castiel blushed. “Because I want you.”
“Dean, this is kind of you, but-”
It was a long journey from the North Pole to Pontiac, Illinois. Castiel found that the human world was a lot different than the world of the angels. For one thing, animals didn’t talk. Castiel learned this quite quickly when trying to strike up a conversation with a grizzly bear.
After that they curled up together, Cas spooning Dean from behind, Dean sleeping peacefully in his arms. Cas nuzzled his neck and thought to himself that
Castiel burst into the small lecture hall the next day in a frenzy. “I did it, I did what you said, I did
“Obviously, Pops,” Claire chuckled, as she and Jack came over to hug Dean around the waist.
“I’m taking my hot chocolate break,” Castiel said, getting up from the worktable angrily.
Dr. Bradbury gave him a smart-alecky look. “Dude, I’m a

Dean stopped short. “What am I supposed to say to him, Sam? Huh? ‘Gee, Cas, I think you’re keen! Wanna go steady? We can share a malt at the soda shop and you can wear my pin!’”
“Nothing.”
me? You did
“I-I-...i-it’s not that I don’t want to, I just...I’m protecting you here,” Castiel said, following the mechanic out of the office. “You’re in enough trouble with the IRS as it is and I wouldn’t want you to-”
is hurting him?”
“Yes. You are definitely not Cinderella or Carrie White.”
”They don’t have to be,” Dean said. “I know I’m not exactly known for handling emotions well, but this is not going to ruin our friendship. We been through way too much together to let some sitcom shenanigans come between us.” Dean lightly punched Cas’s shoulder. “One day, I promise you, we’ll look back on this and laugh at ourselves.”
Castiel rubbed his face, discouraged. “I need help,” he mumbled.
Gabriel frowned, hugging the baby protectively. “I’ll be there for him.”
Sam poured Dean a mug and handed it over. “Have you seen Cas?”
”And then you finally came to your senses, but the Leviathan took over and, and...” Pain flashed across Dean’s face. “Jesus Christ, watching you walk into the river was like going to Hell all over again.”
Chuck let out a quick, manic blast of laughter. “I half expected you to burn the pages so I could never finish.”
” Dean hadn’t slept all night, pining like a goddamn teenage girl.
Jack leaned across the table to show Cas a bandage on his arm. There were also some minor cuts and scrapes on his faces that had already begun to scab over. “The werewolf tossed me through a window, Dad. It was like flying!”
Cas rolled his eyes, grinning. “Even
Castiel smiled, knowing that he wouldn’t live to meet Dean’s loved ones. “Sure,” he said. “I’d love to meet them.”
Normally Castiel avoided heavy physical contact, but with the mechanic...he didn’t seem to mind so much. “I’m...I’m sorry, I don’t know why I broke down like that,” Castiel said, cringing his voice coming out all squeaky. “People I audit don’t usually get to me like this, and they’ve called me way worse things than you. It’s...been kind of a bad day for me.”
Naomi simply nodded, marking it down on her clipboard. “I see.”
here an apology for abandoning him, you deadbeat piece of shit.”
“Uh, yes,” Castiel said, unable to discern by his voice if Dean approved or not. “I usually wear blue but I decided to...” Castiel flexed his fingers to indicate quotation marks. “‘Mix it up today.’”
“Mmpf,” Dean grunted.
“Truce.” Castiel shook, smiling shyly. “Technically I’m not supposed to get friendly with my cases.”
And suddenly he knew: it was true. He tried to picture his seventh grade teacher’s face, tried to recall what color his graduation robe had been, his first car, his first kiss: it was all just blank. The harder he tried to think back on all his “memories”, the more he realized it was all just a black void, just information he’d been given to “remember.” Facts about his character’s backstory Chuck had made up, or figures his desperate brain had conceived to compensate for his lack of a past, like Amara.
“You know we have a thing called a microwave?” Dean said, a little dumbfounded.
Cas paused in drying a plate. “I...already met your uncle,” he said, not answering the question.
written his death...right?
you’re saying it then...yes, I love you too. I’ve always loved you, Cas,” Dean whispered, finally looking up at him..
“I’m staying, Dean, for as long as you want me.”
ass instead.”
But there was one thing he still couldn’t get off his mind. Or rather...one
“In the
“What about Eileen’s soulmate?”
Cas, Dean, and Charlie were stunned into silence.
“Where is this pearl now?” Cas asked urgently.
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “Yes. I think I’ll do just that. You don’t seem to know your place, Dean, but I assure you, once this night is through, you’ll understand
Sure enough, Dean spied Cas in the nature section with a book on his lap, curled up on a couch with his chin propped on his elbow. But as Dean quietly approached him from behind, he saw that Cas wasn’t reading at all. He was staring gloomily at his phone—at the picture Sam had taken of them kissing.
“Yes, I’m real,” Castiel snapped. “I have been for the last thirty years, not that you cared.”
“Dean...I can’t see you anymore,” he whispered.
Maybe that was for the best. It was going to be hard to be around Cas, feeling how he felt about the angel, having heard those three little words he’d been dying to hear since forever, knowing exactly how Cas’s lips felt against his...
“Yes, I remember that part quite distinctly,” Castiel sighed.
“Maybe in the morning, smartass,” Dean said, kissing him. “You wore me out. Which is insane, since I’m not even supposed to feel tired in Heaven.”
“I would love that,” Cas whispered gently.
“No, no, not at all! I’m still very attracted to you. Although...I’m inexperienced in having...vaginal sex. Truth be told...I haven’t had sex with a lot of partners at all. I don’t let myself get that close to too many people. I may not be very good,” Castiel said, curling in on himself.
Castiel took the soldier and smiled, studying him. “He has green eyes. I like that.”
You mean
,” cooed a bone-chilling Scottish voice from the doorway.
Chuck thought about her question for a second. “I guess...I thought about all the people I’ve killed in my stories. All the stories I’ve ended before their time. All the pain. And I asked myself...but why? A tragic ending can be moving, poetic, maybe even fitting. But I’ve come to realize that a sad ending isn’t always the same as a good one. There can be just as much beauty in living as there is in death. As much meaning in happiness as there is in tears. As much value in hope than there is in bleakness. Maybe I owed the world a little hope after putting so much pain into it. At the very least...I owed it to Cas and Dean.” Chuck smiled. “They deserve their happy ending.”
One final tap of Castiel’s fingers to Dean’s forehead, and Dean was back to the first position, on his back on the bed with his wrists bound above his head. Castiel was now completely naked, between his legs, oily fingers pressing against Dean’s hole. “You’re going to feel so good around me, my love. Your brand new body opening for its maker, my perfect receptacle, the sheath to my sword.”
Finally Dean pulled away. “You
“Worse?” Castiel exclaimed. “What do you mean, wor-?!”
”Your son ratted you out.”
” Claire, the girl who’d helped Cas at the guitar store, yelled into the microphone before the young women onstage launched into “Black Betty.”
Dean shivered. “Cas, I...”
“Yo. Take a picture, trenchcoat, it’ll last longer,” Winchester said, glaring as he pulled the clean t-shirt over his head, breaking the spell that befallen Castiel suddenly.
Castiel turned around, about to say,
“It’s your birthday, Dean,” said Cas, sitting beside him on the bed. “I would have thought that was obvious.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And your bluer than blue eyes,” Dean finished, pulling back so he could stare into them. His green gaze was so intense, Cas thought Dean was going to suck him right in. “
“Sure, maybe that’s true, if you keep following the path you’re following now. But this is an opportunity for you to change that.”
me respect you,” he taunted.
“No. I tried asking but...”
Dean walked around the couch to take a seat next to Cas. “I don’t want you to feel embarrassed. It was the potion, it made us both act like dopey teenagers.”
“I told you, I’m an orphan.”
Sam crouched on the floor and gingerly picked up the unshattered neck of the potion bottle. “It didn’t have a label?”
Dean’s fingers stroked the side of his face tenderly. Cas sighed.

the perfect temperature. Hot enough to warm you up right down to your bones, but not so hot that you’ll burn your tongue off trying to drink it. Castiel had just poured himself a mug of this perfect hot chocolate and sprinkled a handful of multi-colored mini marshmallows on top. He was so focused on the marshmallows that he didn’t notice his boss, Michael, and Naomi coming around the corner.
Castiel shrugged and started to undo his belt.
Dean looked up at Cas. “Hey, family hug. Get in here, you big dope.”
?” Castiel turned around to see Dean coming into the dining room, dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt over a black tee and shaved. Dean snorted. “Lemme guess, you work for Santa making toys?”
“I didn’t
Cas stared at Sam curiously as the younger Winchester brother carefully returned the pearl to its drawstring bag. “Well...yes. Dean has said I’m like a brother to him.”
“Sorry ‘bout that. Now, can I help you?”
“Oh, murder,” Dean groaned bashfully, clapping his hand to his forehead. His mind was spinning. Normal Cas was hard enough to resist, all cute and thoughtful, but also detached and serious, his other-worldliness a constant reminder that Dean could look but not touch. But Flirty Cas was so tactile and brazen, a lot closer to Gabriel or Balthazar than his more dour angel brethren. He was practically...human like this. And
“I was just in the library, I didn’t see him,” Sam said.
Dean was tempted to roll his eyes at the cliched analogy, but he was about to get good and fucked and he’d much rather do that than risk another spanking or worse, being left with this raging hard-on without coming. Castiel would probably do that, the authoritative bastard.
Sam seemed taken aback by the question. “Uh...I don’t know. I didn’t even think about it. Uh...I guess...well, I like to think that I would’ve wished for the world to finally be safe. From Michael, from the monsters, all of it.”
Dean laughed as they approached the bus stop. “Don’t threaten me with a good time. Oh hey, your shoelace.” He pointed.
It turned out the little place situated right next to the garage was Dean’s house. It was a small yet warm environment, with a big bookcase and well-loved yet comfortable furniture. There were vintage posters on the walls too, like in the garage, of rock bands and old movies and classic cars. Felt very...homey. Like Dean.
“Yeah...a mechanic,” sighed Castiel. “With the greenest eyes you’ve ever seen. I’m seeing him tomorrow to audit his finances.”
Cas shrieked, pressure rising within him. “Oh, fuck!...That’s it, I’m coming! I-”
Cas shook his head. “I’m just...really happy we can all spend this night together.”
EXCUSE ME WTF
Cas grinned.
“You, you,
“To be fair, I pushed him back,” Cas said, looking at Dean with a mischievous gleam in his eye that brought a blush to Dean’s cheeks.
“Aw, come on!” Dean groaned as Castiel sliced his way up the front of Dean’s shirt to reveal his chest.
Eileen is texting Sam like crazy now and Charlie just responded with “lol gay”
“If one were to...accidentally make a wish, one they knew it was wrong to make, and they wanted to fix their mistake, could one possibly reverse the wish?”
“He’s not alone, look at the mark on his wrist. He’s got a soulmate out there. In a few decades’ time he’ll want to be with them and he can’t meet his soulmate if he’s up here with us. He doesn’t belong here, Gabe.”
“Castiel, I’m not sure that’s a good i-“
Dean shook his head. “No. Sorry, Sammy. S’just a pretty rock, that’s all.” His casual tone was masking dismay, Cas could tell. Dean had really let himself hope for a moment. Dean dropped the pearl into Sam’s hands. “Oh well. Easy come, easy go.” Dean laughed softly, shrugging his shoulders. Then his eyebrows shot up. “Shit, my burgers!” He raced back toward the kitchen.
Anyway, thanks for reading, I’ve wanted to write this AU for a long time. Seriously, go watch Stranger Than Fiction, it’s a great movie! —Ren
Castiel sipped the water. “That’s okay. I’ve never fainted, so we’re both in uncharted territory.”
“Right...
“Yes. To be completely honest...” Castiel took a step forward. “I have wanted you from the moment you stepped out of your office, half-naked and stunning. And that’s why I’ve made a complete idiot of myself in front of you ever since. Because you...you take my breath away. You shut down all my higher brain functions. I’ve never been so...
Sam yelled at them from across the room, engaged in a tussle with another vamp. “We’re in the middle of something here!”
Sam looked up and noticed his brother and the angel playing tonsil hockey and shouted. “Hey! Hello?! Dean, what are you doing?!”
“Baby Castiel,” Gabriel whispered, bouncing him gently in his arms. “Don’t be sad. You’re with the angels now.”
“I dunno, Dean. Sounds like Cas thinks you have a lot to offer. And also he likes your butt and fancy hair.”
“I’m aware of that.”
by myself?”
“Cas, we ain’t lettin’ you die if we can help it. We’re not losing you,” Dean said firmly, with no room in his voice for argument.
Dean felt Cas sigh.
“Oh, shit, that was the wrong thing to say, wasn’t it. Look, I’m coming over there right now with ice cream. What’s your favorite flavor? Actually, never mind, I’ll just get one of everything.”
“Dean...” Cas whispered.

Cas smiled warmly and came and straddled Dean’s lap, kissing him deeply. The two of them moaned simultaneously. “I want to ride you,” Cas murmured in between kisses. “I want to ride
“I...I wouldn’t kill you!” Chuck said, aghast. “I could never kill anyone!”
Finally when Cas was well slicked open for Dean, Cas gripped Dean’s shoulders and achingly slowly sunk down on his own cock. “Ohhh,” Cas breathed as he filled himself up.
“Nothing!” Sam said, his voice cracking.
“I see. And how close are we?”
“I can’t, gotta write,” Dean said with a smirk.
Jack set down a large stack of books on the library table. Man, sometimes Dean forgot that kid had archangel strength. “Here’s everything I could find on potions.”
the weirdest sex thing Dean had ever done, he thought as he watched his own green eyes sparkle up at him mischievously, as his own mouth slowly descended on his cock.
“Dean, while we were in the alcohol store, a child snuck into the vehicle and tried to abscond with it. Clearly we retrieved it safely,” Cas calmly explained.
me. I’m real. I was born, I have memories.”
“I am not joking. I know it must be hard to believe, but it’s the truth. I was adopted by an angel and raised to make toys in Santa’s workshop. Only the angel who raised me informed me that I was human, and sent me out into the world to find my soulmate.” Castiel smiled at Dean.
Sam wrinkled his nose. “Ew. Please
The angel finally pulled away and went back to sucking Dean off. Dean moaned at the hot, wet sensation and threaded his fingers gently through his own short hair. Hmm. Not as easy to grab onto as Cas’s. Maybe he should let it grow out a bit, like the way he’d had it when he was a demon. So Cas could give it a little tug every now and then. They’d both like that.
Sam’s head popped up. “Really?” He looked in Cas’s hand. “That must be it. I’ll get Dean.” He hurried off toward the kitchen.
night
Castiel worried his bottom lip with his teeth.
“That’s a damn lie!” Charlie declared. “You said you named your main character after your son on the morning show!”
Gabriel had never been the most...conventional angel in the garrison. But neither Santa nor the other angels could’ve ever predicted he would bring that little baby up North with him.
“Dean, I’m sorry, I was just-”
Dean just hummed vaguely.
Cas already knew. They must be glowing. His whole vessel was on fire as his
Castiel crawled up the bed, icy blue eyes radiating danger, sending an electric jolt of thrill up Dean’s spine. Oh, he should be very afraid of this entity, if he were smart, and not at all turned on. But Dean had never been the smart Winchester brother.
“I did.”
Castiel chuckled darkly, sending a chill up Dean’s spine. “You have always belonged to me, Righteous Man. Who do you think has watched over you all this time?”
Dean made a face. “Grow up, Sam.”
“She okay? She’s not gonna turn, is she?”

“Charlie,” said Castiel softly. “I’d like to read it.” He then looked at Chuck. “The whole thing, if you don’t mind.”

word today?”
“God, I fucking love you,” Dean groaned back. “You gonna come for me?”
Sam sniffed Dean’s shoulder. “Hold on a sec...you smell...lemony. And spicy. Like...thyme! That’s what you said the potion smelled like, right?” Sam sniffed Dean again, harder.
“I guess this means they won’t be having the sex then?” Jack asked, making Dean groan and bury his face in his hands.
“‘Kay. But first we need some light on the subject.”
“Our life is a mess,” Cas said. “Haven’t you noticed?”
Charlie rolled her eyes. “Well
Castiel Novak realized that his life was remarkable, and he wasn’t going to waste another moment of it counting brushstrokes in the bathroom mirror ever again. He had been given a second chance. He wasn’t going to waste it.
“Okay, okay,” Cas giggled. He rolled on the condom and lubed up the shaft, sighing with relief as he got just a little bit of stimulation to his aching, neglected erection. “I don’t know how long I’m going to last,” he admitted, posing himself at Dean’s entrance.
“Oh...oh, God...
“Yeah, that’s it,” Dean sighed. “More.”
to draw herself kicking ass and saving the fairy princess. The assholes at Sandover didn’t like the queer themes, they wanted me to make Charlie a king instead of a queen, but I put my foot down.”
Dean suddenly smiled. “Whatever it was, though, it was a good dream. I didn’t want to wake up.”

As Castiel lay in the hospital bed, limbs strung up and partially high on pain medication, Dean’s fingers laced with his on his unbroken hand...he finally felt content.
’” Dr. Bradbury perked up with interest. “That’s what the narrator said? Those words
Dean looked at his flannel and realized it was, in fact, the shirt he was wearing the day before, when Cas had been hit with the potion. He’d taken it off to wipe Cas’s face clean. He’d grabbed it on his way out at random, not even thinking about it. “Oh. Crap.”
“Peppermint, yeah,” said Dean, actually smiling. He had a lovely smile. “Instead of using a spoon to mix the hot chocolate mix in, I use a candy cane so the candy melts and mixes in with it.”

“What?” Charlie said, eyes opening wide. “It can’t be. He wrote books about werewolves and vampires, before
“I...I don’t have a son,” Chuck whispered.
Dentist? What was a dentist? What were fillings? They sounded delicious. But instead of asking, Castiel wisely decided to just nod.
Chuck sniffed hard. “I think about all the people I’ve killed in my stories...the werewolf girl who had to be put down by her boyfriend, she didn’t deserve that, she didn’t ask to be a monster. And the vampire hunter who was turned into a vampire...at the time I thought it was such cruel irony, but it was just

“She’s all dusty, her tire treads are wrecked, and I swear if there’s so much as a scratch in the paint or, or, or a dent in the fender-!”
“I’m...sorry,” Castiel said despondently. “I wish...we had met under other circumstances. I think I had better just go.”
Gabriel looked up from his book where he was reading by the fireplace, realizing what his ward must be talking about. He sighed, taking off his reading glasses. “Castiel, come in. We have a lot to talk about.”
The artifact Dean and Cas had stumbled upon in the backlogs of the Bunker had seemed innocuous enough, just a pinkish glass sphere. But the second their hands had touched it, Dean suddenly felt a rush, like he was being picked up by a strong gust of wind and thrown across the room. Then everything went white, and he woke up on the floor with the artifact in shards around him, and his own face was hovering over him, looking down at him in an uncharacteristically bewildered and concerned way. Like the way
