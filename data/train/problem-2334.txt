. Of all the people to appear at this precise moment … John who is sharply intelligent, albeit in a more ordinary manner than his prospective flatmate/friend/lover. John whose defense mechanisms are the only ones Stamford had ever found on a genuinely good man that could rival those of Sherlock Holmes. John who most definitely used to get a kick out of close-calls and near-injuries on the rugby field, and who did not surprise Stamford a bit when he declared his intention to join the army. John who he’d only ever known to date girls, but whom he’d occasionally spotted looking at blokes in a manner that could hardly be read two ways. John who always stands by the bullied, the outcast, the ones everyone else had given up on.
Sherlock is at a stalemate between befuddlement, desperate curiosity, and the absolute necessity of driving John away.
As the name suggests, the closest canon analogue for this episode is The Case of the Beryl Cornet. As far as I can tell the similarities are pretty superficial, basically just consisting of the fact that both mysteries feature a suspect taking the fall for a crime they didn’t commit for the sake of a loved one. I didn’t notice anything particularly interesting in the episode’s use of the canon story, so I am going to set that aside and focus on Watson.
The messenger boy’s announcement was not precisely a surprise. Still, there is a world of difference between knowing you are mad and having others see it, so I stiffened at the words. But then Holmes laughed, and in a moment I was chuckling myself, feeling as happy as I had in the whole of my life.
He squeezed my hand, waiting for me to continue. I swallowed and took a breath. Thinking back, I can no longer recall what I originally intended to say, but it was certainly not what I
At first, nothing much seemed to change in the wake of John’s big pronouncement. In fact, things were better than ever. Sherlock had John’s full attention, with the exception of his shifts at the surgery (dull, but John seemed to feel they were necessary), and he no longer had to worry about interference from potential love interests. It was perfect.
“It’s not living up to my standards I’m worried about, Sherlock! It’s your terrifying tendency to obsess about beating someone so much that you don’t even realize -- “ John clenched and unclenched his hands a few times and took a deep breath.
at me, the less likely that the pleasure of your company is going to be worth enduring this no-doubt ridiculous movie."
“I shall.  And now, John, I think we must be off,” said Sherlock as he closed the lid of the laptop and stood.
“Then why were you staring at me all night?” John asked, sounding tired and rhetorical. Sherlock froze for just a second longer than was necessary, and it caught John’s attention. ”Okay, what did I do, then? What mortifying oversight gave me away as an unwashed commoner? Was I wearing last season’s pocket square? Was it the Tesco aftershave?”
It was 4:08 am, and they were still at NSY giving statements to Lestrade’s people. This was the part John hated most — the mystery had been solved, the suspect was caught, and now they were in a little windowless room telling the same story over and over again to various people who didn’t actually care.  Well, Sherlock was talking to them; John was trying not to doze off with his head resting on his right arm.
short.  Okay, maybe for about a week after Sherlock-- came back from Serbia, when Mycroft’s people groomed him within an inch of his life.  But other than that, Sherlock tended to keep his hair a little too long.  He claimed it was “neglect of irrelevant transport issues,” but John suspected he was actually more than a little vain about his mop of glossy black curls.
and you know it,” Lestrade sighed.  “Don’t think getting cute with me will win you any favors.  You’re right, though, John looks like hell.”
Now John and Sherlock were in a cab trying to get home across London through evening traffic, and Sherlock was apparently planning to spend the entire longer-than-usual ride silently glaring out his window, looking like thunder.  Finally, John (
"I've absolutely no idea; you were resting comfortably for at least fifty seven minutes prior to waking up, and I didn't notice any signs of REM activity, you just--"
"C’mere, let me check your fever," John said, leaning over to put a hand on Sherlock’s forehead.  For the first time since Sherlock got sick his glassy eyes had a gleam in them, then he grabbed John’s wrist and pressed his hot, dry lips into John’s palm.
ruining all the surprises.  And he must have read the recognition on John’s face, because he shot John one of those side-eyed looks, winked at him, and went back to twitting Mycroft.)
When John and Overton finally made it through the front doors and landed in the hotel lobby, Overton said “Shall I find Tim for you?  I expect you’ll want to interview him, since he was the last one to see Jeff…”
"Yes, John," Sherlock cut him off, not taking his eyes off the lock.  "I know, John.  I screwed up, John.  You were right, John."
just wanted to break into the club’s office and read their paperwork so we could turn the agent in, but you insist on going to their Ugly Jumper party and busting the guy personally, so… there’s your jumper.”
John really must be hypothermic, he thought.  He must be experiencing mental confusion.  Because he heard himself saying, “Hmm, I can think of one…” before closing the last few inches between them and kissing Sherlock.
“Okay… you may have a point,” John conceded.  Having the source of his frustrations back safe and within venting range was possibly starting to calm him down a little.  Maybe.  “Sorry, you were saying?”
"You realize where you are?" Sherlock said with a raised eyebrow, as he walked directly over the coffee table and crossed the room.
“But what I want to know is, how will it affect my heart condition?” yelled the pensioner repeatedly, apparently unable to hear the chemist’s reassurances that it would not.
Sherlock was still fiddling with the fire, so John leaned in the doorway with his arms crossed and just watched him for a moment. Then Sherlock stood up, brushing his hands on his trousers, and looked back at John.
Finally, John got his breath back enough to say, "Hey.  This isn't -- I'm happy to see you, too, but let's get you home first, Okay?"
As petty and insignificant a detail as that was, Sherlock’s mind was stuck on it; it was like a song in one’s head that would not go away. He had a sudden etymological epiphany as he felt his mind chewing at the strangeness of John’s appearance over and over and accomplishing nothing, like a beast ruminating in a field. Even worse was that he was pleased by the distraction, that it was interesting rather than irritating.
“Sure, I could go for some fresh air,” John replied, brightening.  “Do I have time for a cuppa?  Ooh, or we can stop at Hyde Park Winter Wonderland for a coffee, if you want to get going.”  Sherlock rolled his eyes, but made the gesture that indicated it was John’s choice.  “Winter Wonderland it is, then,” John said, grinning.
“No, John, you were… everything was perfect.” Sherlock suddenly seemed to realize he was still standing by the coat hooks, cleared his throat, and stalked off to his room, shutting the door behind him.
Having exhausted not only themselves, but the possibilities of exploring Cambridge, they went back to their rooms to await the return of the tracking device. John expected Sherlock to be restless and irritable for the unknown length of time they had to kill until Armstrong returned home. Instead, he was perfectly content to spend the afternoon in the common room of the bed and breakfast with John, watching rubbish game shows and shouting at the contestants. All in all, it was a pleasant day, much to John’s delight -- and slight surprise.
I’d love to help.  Why don’t you come round Baker Street and tell us more about it?  Hopefully it’ll catch Sherlock’s attention, too…”
“I already told you, John… although now it’s five thirty seven AM.  Is there a reason you’re making me repeat myself?”
"Ah, well that’s where you’d be wrong," John said, meeting Sherlock’s intense scrutiny with a look of fond contentment, which didn’t waver even as Sherlock slowly leaned across the cab like a stalking cat and kissed him.
“Do you?” Armstrong asked, one eyebrow raised.  “Do you see how these kids had to tear themselves apart from the day they found each other, because if anyone knew, Jeff’s future would be over?  And not just the damned inheritance, not just his only flesh and blood rejecting him for who he loves, but his Cambridge education, and any chance of a good career outside of rugby.  Which would also be over, as the Lord Mount-James is a powerful man, and his whims can close doors as well as open them.”
"I know, I'm just surprised you thought of it," John said, then slid behind Sherlock to put his plate in the sink.  On his way back through he stopped for a second to rest his hand on Sherlock's shoulder and kiss the top of his head, then he was grabbing his coat and running out the door.
“First, there’s what I found in the room, before I even got to his email,” Sherlock countered. “The fact that he left his laptop at all, for example. He changed out of his trousers into pyjamas, and the trousers remain in a crumpled heap on the floor next to the bed. He put on his shoes and coat, which must have contained his mobile phone and wallet, over his pyjamas. But he left everything else, including the laptop, even though there wasn’t very much and it could have been packed quite quickly. So either he intended to come back right away until something changed his mind, or he was upset enough when he left that he wasn’t thinking about his things. The email was very brief, but it confirmed that evidence: ‘Jeff - Bad news. Call ASAP. -Dr. Armstrong.’ Fortunately, a quick search of Staunton’s inbox told me that Dr. Armstrong was his Director of Studies, and that he would have been in class with her today had he not been out of town for a sporting event.”
A moment later, the door re-opened.  "Did I just --" John said, staring intently at the wall beside him.
"Afraid so, John," Sherlock insisted.  "Maybe you stopped breathing completely, and it woke you up."
John couldn’t help a cold shiver that ran from his scalp all the way down his spine. “Oh come off it, she’s never so much as threatened you. She’s only told you to bugger off in no uncertain terms, which while annoying, is perfectly within her rights. She’s hardly as bad as… him,” John said, unwilling even still to say the villain’s name, but trying not to let it show.
“But I did give her a 10 minute head start and then I followed her,” Sherlock said, grinning.  “Didn’t do me any good though.  She could have made any one of a dozen turns in that time.  I did investigate the three most likely for a few hours, to see if I could pick up her trail, but no such luck.  That’s why it took so long,” he concluded, “and why I was ignoring my phone.  What did your surveillance yield?”  Sherlock said, never actually apologizing.
“So you think Jeff’s gone to be with Jason in his last hours,” John said.  “But why, if they aren’t friendly?  And if they are, why doesn’t anyone know that they are?  And why wouldn’t Jeff check in, if that’s where he is?”
“No, but I would rather the Lord Mount-James think it was.  Keeps him docile and out of our way,” Sherlock said.
Moriarty whirled around as John came through the door, gun drawn. He quickly realized his backup had been neutralized, and raised both hands, smiling. "You got me, boys." He nodded, and backed up a few paces. "You got me."  The smile dropped, and Moriarty's face became cold. "But not for long." Like lightning, he pulled a pistol out of his suit jacket and fired at John, then as John collapsed and Sherlock ran to him, he calmly dropped the gun and walked towards the emergency exit.
"Yes, I suspected you might be."  Sherlock was frowning.  "I’m sorry I got you locked in here without a coat, John.  And I’m sorry I’m a selfish git and didn’t realize you were suffering sooner."
“Mr. Hollister, we’ve come with the -- “ said Dr. Armstrong, trailing off when she realized who was present.
"I am now," John said, smiling and pulling Sherlock in again. They barely noticed a few minutes later, when Mycroft's people swarmed in and began taking charge of the scene.
"Of course," Sherlock said, and finally sat down beside him.  John took a deep breath and leaned back against the headboard.  He realized he was still clutching the sheets, and willed his fingers to uncramp and let go.
“When was the last time you saw a Zipcar in London that was parked and not in use?” Sherlock retorted.
John giggled as he collected the wine glasses and bottle and made his way to the sofa.  “So, Star Trek?  You’re sure?” he asked, as he turned on the telly and logged into their Netflix account.
"Oh, for God’s sake, Sherlock," John said, then ran one hand into the curls at the nape of Sherlock’s neck and kissed him.
The next time John woke up he could open his eyes, but it was mostly dark.  He was looking at a television.  It was on, but there was no sound.  There were rails on the sides of his bed.  He was covered in tubes and wires.  Sherlock was slouched in the chair next to his bed, asleep, still holding his hand.
“Five twenty three AM,” Sherlock announced, smiling superficially.  “Here’s some tea.  Let’s get moving!”  Sherlock thrust a paper cup of the hot brown water that purported to be tea from the vending machine in the lobby.  John had never yet had a proper cuppa from one of those, and he shot the cup a look of suffering and disgust.  But he sat up and took it anyway.  The first couple of sips flooded through him restoratively, and he was able to run his hands through his hair and swing his feet to the floor.
John finally looked up.  “I’m afraid so,” he said, and smiled the bland, flat smile that suggested he was struggling to keep a straight face.  “The only one in your size.”  He went back to his laptop.  “You should see mine; much creepier.  The snowmen’s eyes glow.”
He remembered, something was wrong. Sherlock was in trouble.  He struggled to open his eyes, to say something.
about who’s suffering in the meantime. No, Sherlock --” John interrupted himself to forestall Sherlock’s argument the second he saw his friend’s mouth open, “I am going to say this, and you are going to listen. If this thing with Dr. Armstrong is so important to you… fine. That’s fine. You go… battle her in a duel of wits, or whatever. Meanwhile, despite being a mere mortal that can barely comprehend your level of genius, I am going to go out tomorrow and do my best to find Jeff Staunton. Because maybe I’m an idiot, and maybe me and my concerns aren’t… aren’t worth your precious attention, but it’s important to me that someone find this kid, and make sure he’s safe. If you want to pursue this side-show diversion that you think is the second coming of Moriarty, I won't stop you. But this time, when you’ve got your teeth so deep in it that you don’t even realize you’re following it off the edge of a cliff -- “ John closed his eyes for a second, and made a small noise like a sob “--this time, it won’t be you forgetting to take me along. This time it’ll be you, walking away from me. Because I am done, Sherlock. I’m done trying to make you care about how you make other people feel. It’s your choice. And now, I’m going to leave you to think about that, and I’m going to go upstairs to bed. You can try to talk me out of being angry at you tomorrow.”
considerable talent to tell you where your daughter and her lover are now.  But if it’s any comfort, living on the run with that man must be more than sufficient punishment for the wrong she’s done you.  Now, if you’ll excuse me,” Sherlock said, and abruptly stalked off toward the main road to hail a cab, expecting John to make their apologies and catch up.
It was then that John remembered that he was supposed to be furious with Sherlock.  Maybe it was the good night’s sleep, or the cheerful blue sky and sunshine just visible around the edges of the curtains, but the worst John could summon up was a resigned fatigue.  It had finally happened, he thought; Sherlock had worn out his ability to be outraged through overuse.  John sighed and dragged his hands through his hair.  There was no point in expecting Sherlock to change… and then he supposed he couldn’t excuse himself either, considering he continued to tolerate Sherlock’s poor behavior as part of their relationship.
"I just -- it was nice. Both of us. Resting. Nothing going on for once.  And I forgot to bring that book, and... okay, maaaaaaybe I was experimenting to see how long it would take you to respond to your name versus a random word, and at what volume."
“No, but it’s quite urgent,” Sherlock said in a soft voice, evidently trying to hypnotise Lucy through intense eye contact. “I assure you, Dr. Armstrong will be glad to speak with me, once she knows why I’m here.”
And here is the final regular section (also highly ignorable) because I have no self-control: a list of episode highlights and their timestamps that didn’t fit in the above sections but that I can’t bear not mentioning. For example:
Each chapter title corresponds to the episode to which the chapter's events refer, and as a result there may not be a clear correlation between the title and the contents of the chapter.
So when I gathered my courage and took advantage of some factoids regarding female tigers to make a broad and nonsensical comment about females being more fascinating than males, his noncommittal grunt added considerably to my increasing hope. And if I ignored the fact that my reaction held as much joy as relief, I can at least say for myself that the monumental self-deception of the past month was nearly drawn to its close.
But here’s the thing about being pleasant, steady, and inoffensive: people let their guard down around you. That’s not to say that they impart their deepest secrets; they tend to assume you wouldn’t be able to do them much good there. They simply work rather less hard at disguising the boredom or the melancholy or the annoyance they happen to be feeling in the moment, because your easy manner suggests that you are unlikely to judge and even more unlikely to gossip, and your very boring ordinariness keeps them from being overly concerned about your good opinion, anyway.
Fortunately my mind hadn’t deserted me entirely, and I must have formed some idea of the real man, for I was perfectly sincere that day in declaring myself delighted to meet him, and within forty-eight hours there was a case, and it seemed the most natural thing in the world to drag him along when I broke into the murder’s home. Not that I gave it much conscious thought at time—I seldom do when I’m really absorbed by a challenge—but I thank every good thing in the world that I did it, because I suspect the excitement and danger was all that kept him from storming out of the flat for good those first few weeks.
Moriarty has disappeared again—he stood there acting and feigning and smiling and then was gone like it was nothing—and John is standing with the hard ‘proof’ that Sherlock is the fake and Richard Brook is the real man; only John really is just angry, looking as if he wants to obliterate every byte of data that ever had the audacity to doubt Sherlock Holmes. (
The words clatter through me, every letter clanging, jarring, threatening to cut and wound me if I don’t let them out but I can’t, god, I can’t.
Last year I discovered a 1954 TV adaption of Sherlock Holmes produced by Sheldon Reynolds and starring Ronald Howard and Howard Crawford, fell irrevocably in love, and promptly hunted down all the meta, gifs, and fic I could find on tumblr. It took about 10 minutes. I moved on to the internet at large—thanks primarily to one website this provided 1.5 hours of bearable material, tops. I dug for fics, which occupied another delightful but troublingly brief hour or so. Five minutes more were devoted to a short blurb in a book about Holmes adaptations, and I found with dismay that I had exhausted my sources.
The revelation comes with less relief than Sherlock expected, because that means it's TIME and there's no excuse for delay, no need to run back through Baker Street and be sure he’s absorbed every detail. So he slides his fingers from the cold countertop and turns, ensuring as he does that John's attention is fixed elsewhere (
The rhythm of the rubber ball that will stop his pulse is precise, unvarying, reliable. Like his mind and the scenarios he devises. Comforting.
Once everyone was in place, Shankley went in. Sherlock and John listened as he was greeted by Lester’s men and taken in to see Lester himself. Lester and Shankley chatted casually for a bit, and then Lester offered to show him his “secret party room” in the cellar. They could hear the two men chatting as they made their way down a flight of stairs. Sherlock signalled Lestrade to get ready.
John sat back in his chair with a sigh of satisfaction. “At long last, recognition of my true talents.” He tipped his head with a cheeky grin. “I can die a happy man.” He jabbed an index finger in Sherlock's direction. "And you like my jumpers. Admit it."
There was no response. Sherlock flew up the stairs, calling out as he went. He paused to knock on John’s door, but there was no answer or further sound from within. That was definitely not normal. He turned the knob and went in.
Besides Luddington, the other captives turned out to be Jesse Lincoln, a 16-year-old runaway from Manchester, and 17-year-old Cynthia Carrington-Knowles, the niece of a peer, whom no one had known was missing. She had finagled this by the simple expedient of telling her posh boarding school she would be spending the midterm break on an Alaskan cruise with her parents and telling her parents she would be remaining at school. Her planned party week in London hadn’t turned out quite as she had hoped.
They reached the landing and rounded the turn, and John could resist the impulse no longer. He grabbed Sherlock by the shirt collar, hauled him forward, and began kissing his way down that endless neck, stopping to nibble at the freckle just to the right of Sherlock’s Adam’s apple. He had been wanting to lavish attention on that spot for years. Sherlock shuddered and groaned, hips bucking, and John felt the hard outline of Sherlock’s cock bump against his hip. The sensation drove him mad. “I need to see you naked,
But before Cath, there was Louise, and before Louise, there was Amelia. Amelia had been more patient than many of John’s previous girlfriends, though this did not spare her suffering the same fate—a succession of dates interrupted by endless texts from Sherlock, which, if ignored, morphed into endless calls from Sherlock, which, if disregarded, culminated in the detective showing up in person, invariably at the worst and most awkward possible time. John was disappointed but not really surprised when Amelia ended it after the third such occurrence.
Sherlock opened his mouth and closed it again, nonplussed. Before he could come up with an argument, the other man had climbed into the cab and driven off.
That evening, the Lester investigation began in earnest. Sherlock stayed in character as himself to avoid arousing suspicion, but he checked in with his homeless network more frequently than usual for intel on Lester. As planned, Shankley went undercover as a newly arrived youth, in the hope that he would be approached by one of Lester’s minions. His accent helped sell the ruse.
I look over to where John has just come in with Rosie in his arms. Rosie catches sight of us and squeals with joy, nearly squirming right out of John's arms in her eagerness to reach us.
“Yeah,” he said, nodding. “So...this is me, I guess, trying to take her advice. This is me, talking.” He looked up with an uncertain smile.
John nodded, stepping away. By this time the police had arrived, wanting a statement. He gave it, then provided his contact information and was told he was free to go.
Three hours later, he bolted upright in bed, certain that he knew what John had been mulling over. He’d been thinking about leaving—not just
John blew out a breath. “Let’s start with some water,” he decided. “If that stays down, I’ll take the tablets.” He shivered. Sherlock reached for the afghan on the back of the sofa and draped it over John’s shoulders.
Sherlock collected his scattered wits. “Er...yeah. Tired, but still a bit wound up. Think I’ll play for a bit...unwind.”
So I waited, and John cleared his throat and began again, frowning down at his hands, fingers interlaced so tightly the knuckles had whitened. “Do you remember that ridiculous movie that was on a few nights ago, when neither of us could sleep? About the Jamaican bobsled team going to the Olympics in Canada?”
“Yeah, okay,” he said, and this time the smile reached his eyes. He sobered. “Can we really do this, Sherlock, do you think? Can we really...find our way out of this together?”
But Sherlock had reached the end of his limited patience. “For God’s sake, Lestrade, do you even have a working brain cell? I can’t do all your thinking for you, and I refuse to even try. I’ve given you everything I can. Work the rest out for yourself, or don’t. I don’t care. Either way, leave me out of it! Do not call, do not text, do not send an officer. In fact, delete the very fact of my existence from your pitiful memory banks for at least the next 48 hours. I don’t care about bank heists, I don’t care about abductions, I don’t even care if Jack the Ripper himself reincarnates and begins slaughtering the heirs to the British throne in alphabetical order. I. AM NOT. AVAILABLE.
He stirred and the puffy duvet shifted, revealing a head of raven curls nearly at his elbow. Sherlock was sitting on the floor, sound asleep, head pillowed on one forearm at the edge of the sofa. John shuddered to think of the aches Sherlock would have when he awoke, but he knew the younger man would scoff at his concern.
Mycroft lifted his own in salute, and they drank. They finished the remainder of their meal, chatting companionably, and sat back with sighs of satisfaction. “I don’t have any dessert on hand,” Greg said, “but I can offer you tea, if you’d like.”
“Indeed, John.  I was just asking your friend about the case,” Sherlock said, and if he was interrupting to move the conversation along, he did it with all the professional dignity of someone used to kidnappings and other time-sensitive emergencies and not with his usual terrifying rudeness.  “Mr. Overton, please start from the beginning.  Why are you in London?  When did you arrive?  When did you first notice something was wrong, and what, precisely, did you notice?”
"John, you’ve made it quite clear what you think of my hair; unfortunately nothing can be done to regain your approval other than letting it grow, so I suggest you give it a break and stop staring at me for a
“So Jeff gets this mysterious email from his Director of Studies, goes outside to the parking lot to return her call, and is never seen again. Meanwhile she knows he’s missing, and is hostile and defensive towards us,” John summarized. “Unfortunately she’s a dead end, or at least a brick wall. What’s our next move?”
“First, you should know what I’ve been doing since you went to sleep.  When you asked about the Zipcar account, you reminded me that Mycroft still owed me a  favor from a more recent case.  So I called him and ordered one of those hateful little tracking devices he uses, and he sent it over in a car with Anthea.  I went out and put it on Armstrong’s car about two hours ago.  It’s a low-range frequency, so we have to wait for her to go out and come home again, and then we can log in and see where she’s been.”
“That’d be Anne Roberts, Dr. Armstrong’s wife.  She was an English Lit professor when they met, but she’s since become the chair of a national nonprofit that advocates for gay and transgender youth.  Did anything interesting happen?”  Sherlock asked.
“Save it, Sherlock,” John said, with a raised hand. “I don’t have the energy for a verbal sparring match right now. You can argue me out of being angry with you tomorrow. Right now I just want to go to bed.”
“I have what you might call a ‘premium membership,’ thanks to Mycroft owing me over a little matter involving our cousin and the princess of Lichtenstein,” Sherlock said.  “It’s actually an entertaining case; remind me to tell you about it sometime.”
As they were leaving the museum, they wandered past the holiday ice rink outside.  “What do you say, Sherlock?” John asked, nodding towards the skate rental booth with a grin.
“But what, ultimately, was I searching for?  As I combed through Staunton’s contacts looking for anything that might indicate his whereabouts, I realized I still didn’t have the slightest idea what would have motivated him to disappear, or where he could have gone without telling anybody.  I was also thinking about how… um.  That no matter what problems we’ve faced, you’ve always… stood by me.  I wondered if that’s what Staunton might be doing right now -- standing by a friend in crisis.  Armstrong’s extreme hostility indicates someone’s life is likely at stake, remember?  But who?
"Whatever the reason, it's for the best," Sherlock replied smoothly. "His... little obsession with me was flattering, but we all know it wasn't meant to last."
Sherlock coughed and turned onto his side, then sat up.  “I’m fine, John,” he croaked.  “I just inhaled a little too much of the river.”  Then his eyes widened.  “Did you know you’re bleeding?”
After he made the decision to let go of his irritation, John had to admit to himself that he was starting to have a good time. They popped in and out of classrooms in the sciences buildings, ancient tiny niche museums, arcane shops supplying academics with research materials of all kinds, and finally, after John started staggering on his feet a little bit (“I did not faint,” he insisted, but Sherlock’s small frown suggested disbelief), they stopped at a restaurant for John to get a sandwich (and pretend he didn’t notice Sherlock stealing all the chips). While they were there, they saw on the telly bolted above the bar that the rugby match had happened, and that Cambridge had indeed lost without Staunton. John felt a bit of a pang when he realized they weren’t going to carry off a tidy little miracle on this case, but he tried to remain confident that they’d wrap it up soon enough.
As Sherlock struggled to work through all the possible implications of such an eloquent gift (despite their sheer ridiculous unlikelihood, given his own abhorrent nature), the only thing he knew with any certainty was that he would never, ever deserve a friend as brilliant as John Watson.
A moment later, they heard the sharp, firm steps of a well-dressed authority figure striding down the hall, followed by the woman herself. Dr. Leslie Armstrong was a tall woman in her 60s (taller than John, but not quite Sherlock’s height), and her gray suit and short but stylish hair emanated taste and confidence.
“I get it.  Totally practical, not a souvenir at all,” John said, then cleared his throat and attempted to look serious.  This lasted for all of three seconds, before he and Sherlock both cracked up again.  “You should see if Greg’s people know where to get them fixed, so you can start using them on cases again.”
“Mmmmm, no,” Sherlock said primly, although as he turned away he was struggling to keep his mouth from twisting into a smile.
Several nurses or paramedics and two women in business-professional clothes entered the house, one of whom guided Mr. Hollister to another room, presumably to deal with his grief in private.  The rest went upstairs to take care of Jeff and Jason.  That left Dr. Armstrong alone with John and Sherlock, who had finally snapped out of his paralysis and was striding toward her with a look of concern John could almost believe was sincere.  She saw Sherlock coming, however, and shrugged him off with a hateful look.
Sherlock seized this opportunity to push ahead and took his place at the counter.  “Hello,” he smiled, “I’m here for some Keflex… it’s under Holmes?  Thank you so much,” he said, then shot the old lady a nasty look for letting her umbrella drift into his personal space
"Sherlock. Calm down," John gasped. "It hurts like bloody hell, but I'm not dying. I think." He pulled ineffectively at his shirt buttons but couldn't get a grip on them. "Lost feeling in my damned arm, apparently. Impact, probably; it'll come back. Could be worse. Would you?"
," Sherlock breathed, still unable to move. Then he leaned down, deliberately, but just slow enough to telegraph what he was about to do, and kissed him.
“Nothing solid; I need more data…” Sherlock trailed off into silence for a moment, then said triumphantly, “But I think I just found our next lead.”
John thought Cy’s case was probably only a four, maybe a five… but maybe Sherlock would take it as a personal favor to John.  Or, at the very least, to get John off Sherlock’s back, because John was not above a bit of judicious nagging if it would save his jumper collection.
Sherlock unlocked the door to 221 and, behind him on the stoop, John murmured, “It’s good to be home, I’m done in” as he loosened his exquisite silk tie. (“
“Whatever you’d like,” Sherlock said absently, and then he was off. A moment later John saw him striding down the street towards the university, with his hands in his pockets and his coat collar up.
John knew Sherlock was taken aback by this pre-emptive strike from Dr. Armstrong, based on a slight tightening around his eyes. But otherwise he gave no sign of a crack in his composure when he said, “I can assure you that you are quite mistaken, doctor. In most cases, I’m much more discreet than the police, with their clumsy investigative methods and their obligation to report everything they do to the public record. Whereas I, in fact, have a professional and ethical incentive NOT to reveal my clients’ private affairs, and alienate my paying customers by doing so. Now,” said Sherlock, really starting to warm up, “I am here on a matter that might interest you. Geoffrey Staunton was reported missing by his rugby coach Cyril Overton yesterday, and he engaged our services to ensure Staunton’s safety. It turns out that you’re Staunton’s Director of Studies, and,” Sherlock paused for a fraction of an instant and he tilted his head ever so slightly before continuing, “we rather thought you might be concerned about him.”
A few minutes later they heard Sgt. Donovan distantly calling “Oi, Freak!  You here?” in the warehouse behind them, and managed to draw her attention down to the river.  And not even her snide little digs as she freed them with bolt cutters could put a damper on what had turned out to be, all things considered, a pretty spectacular evening.
this?” Sherlock asked, with a wrinkled nose.  He had drawn the offending object from the bag gingerly, and was holding it aloft pinched between his finger and thumb as though he almost couldn’t bear to touch it.
“John! I wasn’t -- I didn’t --” For once, Sherlock was speechless; he hadn’t expected John to say anything like this at all, and had no idea how to respond.
“Sherlock, I’ve invited a potential client over… he was one of my teammates back when I played rugby for Blackheath.  He coaches for Cambridge now, and one of his stars has gone missing.”  There was no visible reaction from Sherlock, who continued to experiment on John’s jumper, so John took that as a sign to continue.
Later. They’d finally managed to identify their suspect and apprehend him from among the rich dinner guests without alarming anyone. Lacking its usual brisk chase and dramatic conclusion, the quiet end to this case seemed almost anticlimactic. They summoned a cab to take them home, and John held open the door for Sherlock, who felt his pulse thundering in his ears anyway.
“Detective!” Lord Mount-James interrupted, sputtering.  “Private detective!  And who proposed to pay for YOU?” he said, advancing on Sherlock and turning a little red in the face.  “I certainly won’t be responsible; you weren’t my idea!”
At last, John heard footsteps in the hall that didn’t end up trailing away, and it was finally their lock a key slid into and turned.  He sprang to his feet just as the wedge of yellow light from the hall spilled into the room.  Then the overhead light switched on, revealing an irate Sherlock.
“No,” Sherlock said, “that wasn’t in his email. I told you, I studied here for University. Apparently they haven’t re-thought their computer security system all that much in the last decade.” He paused, then admitted, “And I may have learned a few things since then, too.”
John looked… good. Which was fine, Sherlock knew it was fine; it was all transport, and it had never been a problem Sherlock couldn’t move past, before. So why couldn’t he shake his mind loose from the loop it was currently running in, this time? How could he focus his observational powers on the room and find their suspect if he was so drawn to John’s stupid perfect suit? It was no surprise, after all, that John would buy (or, knowing him, more likely rent) a new suit for the occasion, since Sherlock knew very well what John owned and there was nothing elegant enough for this particular Christmas Gala in his wardrobe. So what was the problem? Maybe it was seeing John slip into this posh, polished state so effortlessly that Sherlock’s powers of deduction found so disconcertingly uncharacteristic that they kept returning by trying to resolve the incongruent--
“Well, after we -- after you… went to bed last night, I realized I’d been so focused on Armstrong I may not have... considered all of our options,” Sherlock said, carefully looking at his coffee and not at John.
John hadn’t even gotten to finish making his request, let alone work up to a really satisfying harangue.  He let himself be puzzled by Sherlock’s unexpectedly quick agreement for just a second, then chalked it up to “Sherlock” and gathered his laptop and newspaper.  Maybe Sherlock really was that bored and willing for a distraction; who knew?  John just hoped Sherlock’s good behavior lasted, suspicious or not.  Of Sherlock’s finding Jeff Staunton, John had no doubt, but of managing to convince Overton they’d done him a favor in the process… with Sherlock this bored going into such a small case, chances of him staying civil throughout were slim. Maybe they’d get lucky, and it would turn out to be more of a diversion than they were expecting.
"I — yes?" John could see Sherlock move closer in the faint light from the hallway, but he stopped about a foot away from John’s bed.
“Okay, sit here, and I’ll be right back,” John said, pointing at Sherlock’s chair expectantly.  Sherlock sat, his wounded feelings from earlier finally starting to give way to the now-familiar electric buzzing.  As terrible as Sherlock had been to John tonight, John was still determined to enjoy Sherlock’s company.  There hadn’t even been any scolding about the smoking.  In fact, it looked like John had been planning a surprise for him, and still wanted to give it to him.  What
Barely absorbing what had just happened, Sherlock's attention snapped back to John. "Oh god," he babbled, "Tell me what to do. John! I need you, don't die. I just got you back, I mean I *think* I got you back, you can't die now, John, I have to tell you how sorry I am."
"Wha — huh?" yawned John, vaguely aware he was being discussed.  "S’fine, Sherlock, finish up here."
“--or you could commit a tiny bit of fraud, and phone me in a prescription at the chemist’s where I ran into Dr. Armstrong yesterday, so I have an excuse to have a bit of a look around,” Sherlock said in a rush.
wrap this up tomorrow,” he went on, brandishing one finger at them, “so don’t make any other plans.  Now get out of here and get some sleep, you two.”
I found your little device on my vehicle this morning. I also presume that it’s you or your partner who’s watching my house from the room across the street. I advise you to cease and desist all attempts to invade my privacy, or I shall have to contact the police.
“Dr. Armstrong’s involvement also means it’s someone Staunton knows through the university.  Yet the need for secrecy suggests something of a deeply personal and potentially sensational nature.  The length and frequency of Armstrong’s disappearances suggest Staunton and his friend would be nearby.  With those data points and access to Facebook and the University’s database, it was child’s play to narrow Staunton’s acquaintances down to a name I already recognized - Jason Hollister.”  Sherlock smugly examined his fingernails and waited for John’s reaction.
“Hello, Mr. Hollister, may we come in?” Sherlock asked, sounding gentle, but taking full advantage of the man’s evident shock to slip into the house past him.  Sherlock started poking around in the entryway, then made off for the sitting room.
Sherlock vanished, needing no encouragement.  John was still a bit groggy, and took a second to stretch, drain the last of his coffee, and throw the empty paper cup in the bin.  By the time he got to the lifts Sherlock was already inside one, holding it open.
Sherlock thought about it for a second, then nodded.  “Reasonable enough precautions, I suppose,” he said.  “Hurry up and do that, then, so we can get on with it!”
—” John took a deep breath that was almost a sob, and finally looked away (but did not loosen his grip one bit).
John took a long, deep breath and exhaled slowly, trying to buy time.  Of all the quasi-legal gray areas they usually flirted with, the one thing John didn’t want to risk was his career.  He was afraid their lives may one day depend on his good standing in the medical profession.  And writing prescriptions for a friend was bad enough, but for a celebrity ex-addict like Sherlock… but in the end, he knew he was always going to say yes to Sherlock.  He really couldn’t do otherwise.
“I have an idea or two,” Sherlock said evasively.  “Come on, the first stop’s only a couple of blocks from here.”
"What do you want me to say that I haven’t said already?  Badgering me isn’t going to get us out of here any faster."
John went to the kitchen and rummaged in the cupboard above the sink for a minute, then returned with two glasses and a bottle of wine, and a small plastic bag.  He handed Sherlock the bag, and started pouring the wine.
But as he drifted off, John was thinking about how he wished he could quit his job at the surgery and spend the rest of his life traveling the countryside solving mysteries with Sherlock, and how quiet it was with nobody else's breathing in the room.
Sensing that he had broken a couple of ribs and possibly his collarbone, John very carefully grabbed the front of Sherlock's coat, and slowly pulled him down into a kiss, interrupting him mid-sentence. "Shut up," John said, unnecessarily.
At any rate, this was their third Christmas at the Holmes’ cottage.  As soon as they arrived, Mummy (as she’d insisted John call her too) took him aside for a chat.  “Sherlock tells me you’re the kind of person who worries until you’re very clear on something,” she said, “so I wanted you to hear this from me.  John, you’re
"Three people dead, John," Sherlock cut him off, "because two of them, as the saying goes, ‘found happiness,’ directly resulting in the third’s prolonged suffering and eventual madness.  Tell me again why anyone’s supposed to
John finally let his stern demeanor drop, and grinned along with Sherlock. “You sure you wouldn’t rather have backup out there?” he asked, knowing the answer but needing to try anyway.
Sherlock refused to explain until John was settled in a squashy armchair at the back of the café, and had started working on his tea and what appeared to be the world's largest Danish.  “Okay, you really know where he is?” John mumbled, his mouth full of pastry.  “How’d you do it?”
“And then, just as I realized we’d gone nearly in a circle around the city, I turned a corner to find the car parked across the side street, and Armstrong leaning against it with her arms crossed,” Sherlock said.
"Oh no, no, no, Sherlock, that’s not how this works" Lestrade replied.  "I told you I didn’t just do what your brother tells me; I have some discretionary powers. And right now, I’m going to use them to let you think about what you’ve done… not that you will, so I don’t know why I bother," Lestrade said, grinning through the bars at him, "but I guess I should get
As they left the suspect’s yoga studio and plunged back into the icy, inch-deep river on the pavement, John came to a decision.  “Sherlock, I need a break.”
“You sure, mate? You look a bit… green,” John said. Again, Sherlock neither moved nor spoke (for too long, John thought), but then he turned his head, took a deep breath, and dived into a frantic monologue.
“Yes.  Well.  I... did make it back to the pathology building in time to speak with a few of Dr. Armstrong’s students,” Sherlock said, looking remarkably chastened (for him).  “It seems she’s suspended office hours this week, and she leaves as soon as class is over.  I thought I was already too late to follow her, and decided to visit her other regular haunts to ask around.  But I turned out to be very lucky, and actually ran into her at the very first stop I made: a shopping complex not far from here.  She was coming out of the chemist’s with a rather large bag, and I slipped around the side of the building to avoid being seen.  I thought I’d been successful,” he said, with a wry twist to his mouth, “but she must have spotted me then, or at least become suspicious.  At any rate, she got into her vehicle and drove off.  But again, luck was with me - there was a Zipcar nearby, and I was able to follow her.”
When John realized what Sherlock meant, he suddenly needed to sit down as well.  "Sherlock... oh my god, no.  This is real, I promise," he said, leaning into Sherlock in the hope that physical contact would help ground him.  "Lestrade and some people are here, can I call them in?  They just want to make sure you're safe to go home, and then I'm taking you out of here."
When he decided they were far enough away from the chemist’s, John asked “Did you see what you needed to?”
“Wasn’t looking for company,” Sherlock said, pointedly taking a drag and exhaling without making eye contact.
And then, during a commercial break, Sherlock reached for his laptop. “She’s not home yet, I’m just checking my email…” he said, distracted. “I don’t expect her to -- oh.”
John was asleep when he felt a weight hit the inadequately-sprung hotel mattress.  His instincts registered it as "not a threat," and he went back to sleep.
"No, absolutely not; it’s freezing out.  It might even snow this evening.  Take a blanket off, genius." John set the tea on the table and patted at one end of the duvet-pile.  "Budge up," he said, and the pile contracted so he could sit down.
"Ah, see, there it is," John said, giggling. "And here for a minute I thought it might just have been me."
Sherlock practically ran down the stairs to Baker Street, and was in a taxi before John could get the flat’s door locked behind them.  When they arrived at the rugby team’s hotel, Sherlock was inside before John could even get money out for the cabbie.  Was Sherlock… excited?  About this non-entity (John hoped) of a case?
John's mind struggled to the surface again.  It was some time later; how much, he didn't know. Something happened, he remembered. Before.
Sherlock’s gaze dropped again as he said, “She said she knew I’d been following her, but that I wasn’t going to find anything that way.  That I may as well go back to London and stop wasting everyone’s time and energy, and my employer’s money.  Because wherever Staunton was, and whatever he was doing, he clearly wasn’t going to be found until he wanted to be found, and that everyone needed to respect that.”  Here, Sherlock’s embarrassed childish tantrum finally gave way to The Face, as John once called it.  Obviously, he expected the next leap to be as clear to John as it was to himself.
“Of course,” said the man who must be Mr. Hollister, “you must be the Macmillan nurses.  Thank you for coming, gentlemen, but--” his voice broke.
“Sherlock,” John said, furrowing his eyebrows aggressively at him in a “you’d better tell me what’s going on before I lose it” fashion, but Sherlock just stood there in the entryway, staring strangely at John and Mr. Hollister.
Even though they were in (relatively) sleepy Cambridge and not bustling London, it didn’t take Sherlock long to secure them a ride. Once again, John had the suspicion that Sherlock was no stranger to the town.
Despite Sherlock’s impenetrable silence on the walk through Winter Wonderland and most of the way through the museum, John seemed content to cruise alongside him, leaning in occasionally to examine an exhibit tag, with a faint but unmistakable smile grazing his face.  Sherlock was able to satisfy his own curiosity about the venomous creatures he’d come to see with only half of his attention; he was focusing the other half on John as unobtrusively as possible.  What was so different about John now, even today, and why was needing to identify it so... compelling? Was it John’s good mood, presumably from the lighthearted adventures they’d had that day?  No, Sherlock’s agitation started before he ever suggested leaving the house.  It had never let up since last night, if Sherlock was being honest with himself.
“Just practicing,” Sherlock replied, and then John saw that his cuffed hand was holding a safety pin and attempting to lock-pick itself to freedom.  After a moment the cuff popped open, and Sherlock caught it and snapped it onto the other wrist.
“Brilliant!” John couldn’t help exclaiming, although he was still trying to be cross with Sherlock.  But he couldn't help thawing a little at the way Sherlock positively beamed at his praise.  “So, what do you have planned for us in the meantime?”
“The Lord Mount-James, sir, Geoffrey’s uncle, and therefore the only person in this room who has a right to be here!  Who are YOU three, is the question, isn’t it?”
"John," Sherlock replied with a bit of a sarcastic tone, but still smiling that slightly preoccupied smile.
they hadn’t called Lestrade (or anyone else, for that matter) beforehand to say where they were going. Sherlock made halfhearted attempts to fiddle with the lock every half-hour or so, but it was too rusted for him to pick without the proper tools.  The best thing that could be said about the situation was that Sherlock had his coat despite the unseasonably warm day (
Sherlock flopped bonelessly into the corner of the sofa, and reached for his laptop.  “Did you save me any of the pad thai?  I’m not really in the mood for mussaman curry.”
Sherlock glowered.  “I hardly expected to get a lead on Dr. Armstrong as soon as I walked in, of course.  But I had seven different schemes for getting a glimpse of her records, and none of them worked!”
I hesitated at first, I wasn’t sure how he would take the question because it involved his brother. I took his hand again, holding it between mine, admiring the differences in size and color. With a deep breath, I asked what had been weighing on my mind, “Javier, last night at La Rosa Negra when we were on the dance floor, what was it that Carlo whispered to you that made you leave so quickly?”
For Q it is odd being the bottom when he has previously been the top. Still, he enjoys the feelings having his sentinel opening him, blunt fingers playing inside and out, teasing and touching, making him moan and move in need. When the older man finally lines them up and slowly pushes forward, he sinks his entire self into the link, sharing the feeling as he accepts the feelings being shared with him.
"Well then, the least you can do is give me a turn with your coat.  I’m freezing, and while you’re thinking it’s all just transport to you, right?"
The next morning John didn’t wake nose-to-nose with an impatient detective.  He opened his eyes cautiously, determined that Sherlock was lying on the sofa, then yawned and stretched ostentatiously to reinforce how nice it was to be waking up of his own free will (although he doubted Sherlock would get the message).
"You inconsiderate fucking bastard,” John hissed, skewering Sherlock a second time with his livid, grief-stricken eyes. “Will you
"You heard me," Sherlock retorted sharply, but he couldn’t stop one corner of his mouth from twisting up into a wry smile.  "But really, we need to keep you warm.  Any ideas?"
“Until I hear that from the police, I’ll thank you not to run around making wild accusations and inciting panic for no reason,” Dr. Armstrong spat. “Beyond that, nothing that transpires between myself and my students is any business of yours.”
Sherlock unbuttoned John's shirt, and revealed a kevlar vest. Relief hit him so hard that tears sprung up in his eyes. As he bandaged the graze on John's arm that had bled so dramatically, he continued the nervous chatter. "Thank god, I thought I'd lost you, and while you weren't speaking to me -- I hadn't even had a chance to tell you I love you yet, you can't die without talking to me, John, I forbid it --"
"No, we’ve lost them," Sherlock rumbled next to his ear, reading his mind. "This’ll be Lestrade and Donovan."
Sherlock had gone completely still, with his fingers steepled under his nose, staring at the laptop with a glittering animosity John had last seen at the pool where Moriarty was trying to kill them.
John couldn’t help being a little bit irritated as Lucy flushed slightly and stammered, “Um… okay, let me go see if I can even reach her. Probably not, though. If not, we’ll make you an appointment, don’t worry.” Then she backed awkwardly into the office behind the reception desk, and shut the door. And John was even more irritated when Sherlock dropped the wide-eyed stare abruptly, and shot John a sideways smirk.
sorry,” Sherlock said in a gentler voice, leaning distressingly close to John as he draped the coat over John’s shoulders.  For a second, John’s entire world contracted dizzily into the smell of Sherlock’s poncy shampoo and the warmth of his coat, and John could feel his shivering muscles start to relax by degrees.
“Hi, Owen.  Here to pick up for Jason,” said Mr. Hollister.  He looked tired, and not from one night of poor rest; the creases in his face seemed bone-deep.
“You don’t have to talk down to me, Sherlock, I’m well aware you think I can’t be trusted with this expensive of a suit,” he said, not looking up. “I’ll have you know you don’t need to be born a posh git to know how to wear one.”
They sat there staring wide-eyed at each other, hearts pounding, for a long minute.  Then Sherlock blinked a few times and said “I didn’t want to get you sick, too.”  John, still open-mouthed, made a small noise that might have been “oh,” then dove for him.
“Come. Inside.” John insisted, so he made a big show of sighing and rolling his eyes before he flicked his filter into the alleyway and ducked inside his bedroom window.
“The lad's only been missing since dinner yesterday, but he left visibly distressed without a word to anybody.  I’d say it was only about a five, but I was hoping --”
“Yes.  Well.  Fortunately, Jason’s parents are supportive of their relationship,” she said.  “And Jeff was hoping they’d only have to hide from His Lordship for a few years at most, until Jeff was established on his own merits.  The boys met before Cambridge and enrolled together.  I was assigned to be their Director of Studies, and when they found out about Anne and her work, they came to me for advice.  I didn’t really want to encourage them to hide their relationship, but I understood, having been through similar times myself.  It’s harder being out than you might think,” she said, shooting John a look. "Especially at their age."
“Took you long enough,” John muttered, pretending to look exasperated, and Sherlock pretended not to grin before continuing.
Touched by his soldier's faith and steadfastness even in this grim situation, Sherlock couldn't suppress a rueful smile. “Oh, I won’t regret it,” he said, as he leaned in around the bridge support, cupped John’s face with his free hand, and kissed him.
But the real problem with Sherlock’s haircut was that John couldn’t stop looking at it, for some reason.  He found himself outright staring more than once, back at the flat, until Sherlock called him out on it.  Fortunately, not long after that they got invited to a crime scene, which was at least a distraction for both of them.  But as the day wore on John started stealing little sideways glances again, wondering how so small a change could have such a huge impact on his friend’s appearance.  He wondered if it would feel different to the touch, the way his own hair felt paradoxically softer after a trim.  He thought about how different it was to ruffle short hair, rather than running one’s fingers through longer curls.  He considered —
Sherlock popped the latch and slid the door open in one fluid motion.  In two strides his foot was on the railing, then he was launching himself at the river.  John took an instant longer to climb the railing and vault himself over.  They were counting on the driver being occupied at the other end, plus the engine noise between them, to cover their exit.  But a second man noticed them immediately and started firing shots in their direction.  Their only hope was to dive, and swim for the riverbank as fast as possible.
At first, John thought they were chasing down Dr. Armstrong’s backtrail to investigate her routine. But as the day wore on, John became increasingly suspicious that Sherlock was just touring John around Cambridge to show him the sights. John thought there’d been enough friction between them already this weekend, and he didn’t want to shatter the fragile peace they’d established by asking. He resolved to go back to his attitude of “follow Sherlock’s lead and hope the case’s entertainment value lasts as long as possible,” if he could.
"Ah," Sherlock said, softly.  "John, I’m only — it’s not necessary to… he aimed that gun at you too, you know."
Sherlock actually only stopped in his room long enough to snatch some cigarettes from their hiding place and throw his coat on over his pyjamas. Then he was out the window and onto the fire escape over Mrs. Hudson’s bins.
Sherlock couldn’t stop looking at John out of the corner of his eye. While he was ostensibly working the room and keeping an eye out for their suspect, every time his gaze swept across John Watson there was a split-second electric fizz in his blood more addicting than the first heady rush of cocaine, and he kept coming back for a little hit whenever he thought he could get away with it.
"Oh, yeah, doesn’t surprise me.  I was bashed in the head by what felt like an entire log floating by.  No concussion though, it’ll be fine."  John sat down heavily in the mud next to Sherlock and leaned against his side.  "For a second I thought I’d lost you again, when I saw you lying there…"  Sherlock felt John shivering, and slipped an arm around his waist to draw him closer.
“I’ve absolutely no idea, but I’m prepared to go find out,” Sherlock said, passing John a scrap of paper with an address on it.
“Really now, John,” Sherlock said, brushing some snow from his coat. “I think I’ve had enough frivolity for one day.  We should really get back to Baker Street so I can write up what I observed at the exhibit.”  Without waiting for a response, he set off for home.
happen, it’s generally accepted that you choose one and let the other be free to choose or be chosen by someone else. No need to be stingy in a world like this… except Mrs. Everdeen taught her daughters to hold tight to whatever happiness you can find and never let go. If you can’t live without that someone, make sure they know.
The women held the men down long enough to give the large merc a head start before following the chaos. Jayne had disappeared from the corridor quicker than expected for a man of his size, leaving a confused Kai watching his mother attempt to talk Mal down and take his weapons away. Even Zoe wasn't enough to stop the captain this time.
The remainder of the ride home passed in silence. When they reached the flat, John declined Sherlock’s offer of tea or something stronger, instead going directly to the bathroom for a shower. He emerged a few minutes later, muttered a goodnight, and disappeared upstairs to his room. Sherlock watched him go with a twinge of worry. He moved to his chair and settled himself to think.
I cried for Mycroft, who had had Eurus's (and my) care thrust upon him at far too young an age and had borne the burden alone all these years, and who was now grappling with our parents' censure and the mental, emotional and physical carnage our sister had wrought. And who didn't have a John Watson to help him.
“SHERLOCK!” John thundered, then groaned as both his abraded throat and pounding head made their displeasure known. He put a hand to the back of his head, because that seemed a reasonable response to the sensation that one's skull was about to split open lengthwise. He continued, his voice quieter, hoarse but firm. “Stop and listen. Please.”
Mycroft’s look of astonishment morphed swiftly into mirth as he dissolved into a belly laugh of his own. Greg watched avidly, face creasing into a grin. Soon it was Mycroft’s turn to wipe at his eyes, and Greg produced the ever-useful pocket square, reaching up and gently wiping Mycroft’s cheeks. Mycroft sobered as he looked into Greg’s eyes.
Louise never had a chance to make it as far as the second date. Their first and only had consisted of drinks at Louise’s local, followed by a rom-com and shared bag of buttery popcorn at the cinema. Louise was a bright, bubbly, green-eyed blonde who genuinely seemed to appreciate John’s sense of humour—up to a point, as it later transpired. The first part of their date had unfolded so well that after the movie, John suggested getting takeaway from the Chinese at the end of Baker Street and taking it back to 221B to eat. Louise agreed readily. It should be safe, John reasoned. Sherlock had a time-consuming experiment under way in the lab at Barts that he had said would need monitoring until at least midnight. John ratcheted up the charm, and by the time they’d picked up the food and made it to the flat, Louise was beginning to cast heated looks his way. John began hoping for an even happier ending to the evening than he had initially anticipated.
For the better, I think. Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, recovering sociopath, and human human being. At your service.
In the wake of Mary’s death and the maelstrom that was the Culverton Smith case, and especially since Eurus's eruption into our lives, John has been struggling. As have I, truth be told. So much has happened, and so much lies between us. We have lost our way, I think. Lost each other in some ways, though physically we are closer than at any time since my fall. John and Rosie have come to live with me here in the revamped 221B, and for all intents and purposes, we are a family.
“Well, this food is a sodding miracle, so I’d say your brother was right on the money in this instance,” Greg grinned. He lifted his water bottle in a toast. “Cheers!”
Feeling steadier now, Sherlock opened his eyes. He considered for a moment, then launched a new browser tab and navigated to the Fleshlight website. There were two options of orifice on John’s particular model of Fleshlight (the Fleshlight Original, as it turned out): the Lady (a vulva), and the Butt (a puckered anus). John had opted for the latter. Why would he do that, if he was straight? Surely the delicate petals of the vulva would have appealed to him much more than the decidedly more masculine anus? One point in favour of John’s bisexuality, then, albeit a tenuous one. Women had anuses too, after all.
Rather than fighting back or trying to subdue Sherlock, John remained as still as he could under the assault, and said "Sherlock, it's me!  Stand down, it's over, we're here to get you out."
Sherlock glared skeptically at John, but there was no reaction.  Becoming resigned, he snapped the tags off the hateful garment, and peeled the “PRESS ME!” label off its sleeve.  As he slipped his arms into it and pulled it over his head, he shuddered; he could hear the synthetic yarn
“What, John? What could I possibly not realize that you with all your staggering intellect could pick up on? “ Sherlock snapped. “Enlighten me.”
"I don't really blame you for Mary, Sherlock. But it had to look real. He had to believe you were alone, vulnerable. And... okay, I had to know if I mattered to you as much as you matter to me. I *was* still angry, about Magnussen, and the drugs. But it was the hardest thing I've ever done, telling you to go to hell and sending you into this alone."
"If you were my imagination, you wouldn't have stopped me," Sherlock said, and John suddenly felt like he was on fire from the inside.  It took every fiber of willpower John had to remember where they were and what condition Sherlock was in.
John’s mouth snapped shut, and his eyes narrowed.  He realized he was trying to suppress a constant, full-body shiver as he stuffed his fists as deep as they could go into the pockets of his inadequate cardigan, and he thought,
"For God's sake, must everything be difficult with you?" Sherlock huffed, rolling his eyes; then he reached across the bed and kissed him; gently, briefly, but with unmistakeable intention.
Usually, when enough time had passed that Sherlock resurfaced in his own thoughts and played out whatever piece he found himself in, John would be dozing again.  Sherlock would quietly return to whatever he’d been working on, and John would eventually rouse himself enough to go back to bed.  But tonight, when Sherlock set down the violin and turned back toward the kitchen, he was pleased to see John still awake and grinning incandescently at him.
“It’s too early to call Sarah, and the chemist’s isn’t even open yet,” John said, and held up a hand to forestall a tantrum when he saw how Sherlock’s face darkened.  “But let’s get going anyway,” he offered.  “I can at least get some kind of food and maybe some proper tea, even if you aren’t going to eat.  And then we can call Sarah from the road.”
“I’m just wondering,” Sherlock continued, “on a purely personal level, mind you; why was it so important to protect them, if there was a perfectly legitimate reason for Jeff's disappearance?  Why were you so determined to throw me off, when a short and civil conversation would have ended my involvement?  It’s not to protect the family’s privacy; they’ve been all over the news with the fundraiser already.”
At first Sherlock had been encouragingly dismissive of the danger, saying that it was unlikely for the water to rise that much, at this point in the river, at this time of year.  But after what seemed like an eternity (but was more likely an hour or two), the water had reached John’s shoulders, and he realized Sherlock hadn’t assured him they’d be fine in quite some time.
“My grandad was like that… he left family to hang more times than I could count, in the name of his precious nest egg.  The way he used to treat Harry, in particular… it infuriated me,” John said, staring out the window.  He took a deep breath and squared his shoulders, then said, “Well… people like that get what they deserve.  He died friendless and alone in the end.  I’ve tried to let go, and have faith that karma takes care of itself.”  He shook his head and turned to look at Sherlock.  “Okay then, what’s our next move?”
Perhaps it would be more convincing to carry a drink around, even if Sherlock didn’t drink it; that’s what people did at these things, wasn’t it?
"Shut up, Sherlock," John said in a warm, low voice like honey that Sherlock had never heard before.  Then, as he passed Sherlock and went through the door, he reached up and kissed him; briefly and awkwardly, but with intent.  "I’ve been putting that off for too long, too," John said in that same strange but electrifying voice, then he ducked into the restaurant’s foyer.
Mr. Hollister made a peculiar noise somewhere between a laugh and a sob, and slid down along the doorframe a few inches.  John rushed to catch him, then guided him inside.  As he was settling the man into an armchair in the sitting room, John shot Sherlock an alarmed look.  Sherlock merely stared back, wide-eyed.
"Well, that's only fair, Sherlock, you have John," Moriarty grinned, "oh wait that's right, he's not speaking to you anymore, is he? I guess he found out your amazing superpowers weren't so amazing after all when you let his awful wife die, and now he's disappointed in you. How dull." Moriarty made an exaggerated frowny face, then rolled his eyes.
John looked back up at Sherlock and smiled bravely; then he slid one hand around the back of Sherlock’s neck and kissed him.
“Of course there was, for you,” John said.  “Wait, how does that work?  I know you can reserve them with your mobile now, but how did you manage that fast enough not to lose her?”
“We’re in town to play Oxford for a special televised throwback game, with classic-looking jerseys and all.  Huge spectacle, for our level of play.  We got here on Wednesday night; yesterday morning we woke up and practiced on the big pitch, to get the feel of it, and last night we came back to the hotel for the team dinner.  Until then, everything was right as rain.  After dinner the boys got a free evening… well, they’re supposed to take it easy in the hotel, socialize in the lounge or in their rooms, but they can leave, if they really want to, they just have to check out and give us an idea of their plans.  But Jeff didn’t… and it’s not like him, either… that’s the really strange part…” Overton seemed to be getting less coherent as he got more emotional.  John was waiting for Sherlock to roll his eyes and unleash a verbal slap to Overton, but it never happened.  John interceded anyway.
"…and here," Sherlock said, pointing at the snow, "you’ll observe two sets of tracks - one wearing boots and one barefoot.  They struggled, then Boots ran towards the woods.  So you see, Mr. Holder, your son
“Dear God, it’s good to see you, mate,” Overton said at last.  “And not just because of Jeff.  It’s been too long.”
When they arrived at the chemist’s, there was a bit of a crowd.  Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes impatiently, but his performance failed to hurry the elderly grandmother who was consulting with the head chemist.
“Well obviously, she knows the answer to ‘wherever Staunton is and whatever he’s doing,’ and her last comment proves that she’s personally invested in the matter.  That means she has a blind spot, a weakness that we can exploit, to get that information.  She’ll be emotional, she won’t be thinking as clearly as she could be, she’ll make mistakes.  And then, we’ll have her!”  Sherlock cried.  “And… and then, we’ll find Staunton,” he added, clearly as an afterthought but before John could glare at him.
Overton stepped forward hesitantly.  “Hello sir, I’m Cyril Overton, Jeff’s rugby coach and the person who contacted you.  This is Sherlock Holmes, the private detective --”
"No, John, I think we’re done for the night.  Any further questioning can wait until tomorrow, can’t it, Gerald?"
That evening they sat around the fire drinking peppermint white russians and cranberry martinis, while Mycroft moaned about the pedestrian Christmas carols and Sherlock pretended to deduce all the wrapped presents.  (When he told Mycroft that John had
John couldn’t help smiling fondly at the sight of Sherlock, slurping a mug of tea with both hands, practically curled around it with his knees drawn up, swaddled in comforters.  And apparently John really was a bad man, because the disheveled curls and red nose only added to his charm.
John couldn’t open his eyes.  His eyelids weighed about a thousand pounds each.  Why couldn’t he open his eyes?
“Focus, John. I shouldn’t be gone more than a couple of hours, and then we can regroup based on what I discover.” He rose and tightened his scarf. “If I hurry, I should be able to catch some of Dr. Armstrong’s students before they head home for the weekend.”
Seven hours, three webinars, and exactly half of each of their Thai takeaway dinners later, John was starting to lose control of his anxiety. Naturally, Sherlock wasn’t answering his phone or his texts.  Dr. Armstrong had returned home about an hour ago.  The rented room had long since grown dark, and any lights brighter than John’s laptop screen would interfere with his stakeout.  Which, speaking of, increasingly felt like NOT the place he should be; but he convinced himself that everything was fine, and Sherlock was fine, and the stakeout was the only constructive thing he was able to do right now anyway, so he should stay put.
"It's always been you, John," Sherlock replied too quickly, in a strange, tight voice, then smiled weakly like he was hoping it would pass for a joke.  "Surely even you must have figured that out by now."
Sherlock pulled away with a grin.  "Okay," he purred.  And then, "You know how I know this is real?"
“Why not?” Sherlock asked innocently, like he hadn’t just been throwing a tantrum and torching John’s belongings.  Like he always rushed to do favors for John, without dragging his feet and complaining.  Like he was pleasant and civilized on a routine basis, and not just when he wanted something.  ‘
"…so I deduced it must be the gardener.  And when we confronted him about it, in broad daylight in a public place I might add, he pulled a gun on John — us — both of us, actually.  Which is when I immobilized him and John attempted to disarm him.  Unfortunately for Mr. Woodley, in the ensuing struggle the gun went off, killing him instantly.  Fortunately for the public, the Brixton Ripper is no more.  And that really must be the end of it, Detective Inspector,” Sherlock said, suddenly standing up and tying on his scarf.  “My partner is clearly flagging and needs to rest.”
He was still sitting rigidly upright crushing fistfuls of blanket a moment later, when the door cracked open and a rectangle of dim light fell on his floor.  “John?” Sherlock said, uncertainly.
“Obviously,” said Sherlock.  Then, after a second, “That bothers you, doesn’t it.  Personally.”  It wasn’t phrased as a question, but John knew what Sherlock was asking.
tried to cover it up, which means he knew Boots’ accomplice and was trying to protect her.  And there’s only one person that could possibly be - his own sister, Mary.”
“Mr. Hollister, is Jeff here?”  Sherlock asked, now back in the entryway with them, and looking towards the stairs.
going after what made him happy and staying involved with her insanity that did it.  And if life is short, then… that makes it even more important to spend it with people you actually love, whatever the cost.”
John held his friend’s penetrating gaze for a minute without wavering, then he nodded. “Okay then,” he said, back to his usual agreeable self. Sherlock furrowed his brow at John for a second, then slowly returned to staring out the window (albeit with a slightly more troubled expression, and occasionally shooting John suspicious looks out of the corner of his eye). Otherwise, they passed the last few minutes of the taxi ride in silence.
The train ride was surprisingly pleasant, even though Sherlock couldn’t stop deducing the personal lives of the other passengers and collecting angry stares. Or maybe John was so desperate for a holiday that just getting out of London was a relief, Sherlock notwithstanding. Either way, in order to maintain the illusion, John avoided mentioning the case unless Sherlock did. He’d decided that, while his concern for Jeff’s safety was serious, the case was likely to be relatively straightforward, and therefore it was in his best interest to stay out of Sherlock’s way and hope the case’s entertainment value lasted as long as possible.
