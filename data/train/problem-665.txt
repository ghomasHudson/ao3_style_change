It takes him weeks to realise that he’s approaching it wrong. John hadn’t been pleased or grateful when he’d said it. He hadn’t been impressed with Sherlock’s brilliance or basking in a post-orgasmic haze. He’d been angry. Luckily, Sherlock makes John angry quite a lot – though almost always accidentally. It shouldn’t hard to do it on purpose. When John comes back from a shift and goes upstairs to change his clothes, Sherlock waits. Then the shouting starts, right on schedule.
“Because I thought you didn’t want me to say it! Sentiment. All that. Not your area. I assumed you would hate it. You never said it back.”
“No,” said Holmes, thoughtfully. “And yet I do not think she was entirely surprised. I believe that our minds work in similar ways. In my place, she might well have taken a comparable approach. Now that she has her chance to anticipate me, however, it is my turn to anticipate her.”
I silently willed her to release me, but instead she remarked aloud as to the eeriness of the house and Holmes turned towards us. He responded with some perfunctory remark, as I, my hand growing damp in hers, glued my eyes to his face. I do not remember what he said, but I remember that he was perfectly calm and that his eyes remained on her face as he spoke, never once flickering down to where our hands were joined. All I could think, as the pain of his indifference turned my stomach to lead, was that I should not be allowing Miss Morstan to believe that I was in love with her when, despite my best efforts, I could not seem to stop every fibre of my body from vibrating with mingled dread and a sort of sick excitement at the thought of what Holmes would make of our growing understanding.
I felt a terrible urge to press the point but knew that I had already worsened my own situation. Holmes was not a man to turn away from a puzzle. He must now be wondering, if he had not been already, what was so important about the strange unspoken moment that had passed between us the previous evening.
He flung this cryptic phrase at me over his shoulder as he exited the carriage and in a moment he was halfway to the station exit, flying through the small crowd on his long legs as though the devil himself were behind him.
“I don’t need your help. I'm a junkie who solves murders for kicks, John, not one of your little girlfriends.”
“They planned to bury you in the same coffin, Dr Watson,” Lestrade said somewhere above me, his voice hushed but steady. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Holmes make a brisk, abortive movement.
“I saw no other option,” I objected. “Once I knew that they were speaking with an undertaker it became clear that every moment was precious. I thought I might still be in time to save her.”
“Don’t be so dull. You’re not this boring, John. They were breathing it in for minutes, possibly hours. We were exposed for seconds. We’re perfectly fine and you know it. You’re a doctor. So why are you getting so irate? What business of yours is it what I do with my brain?”
It was at the scene of the murder in Lauriston Gardens, which I described in such dramatic detail for the public in A Study in Scarlet, that I first saw Holmes truly in his natural element. I observed the way he executed his performance outside the house, making his leisurely way up and down the pavement, gazing around him at the rather ordinary street as though it held secrets too arcane for the rest of us to comprehend. I saw how his slow yet thorough examination, lingering over the mess of footprints on the path, irritated Inspector Gregson, who stood waiting for him with his impatience showing nakedly on his face. I could not help but feel that Holmes was enjoying his rather theatrical examination and that a small part of his object was irritate the man who had summoned him so peremptorily. Inside the house, however, all posturing ceased. Seeming almost to crackle with barely contained energy, Holmes rushed about the room, ignoring the ghastly body that dominated my own attention with its bulging eyes and twisted face, and its strange, contorted posture, which gave the dead man an almost animal-like appearance. Holmes first examined the walls, fireplace and floors of the room, and I found my gaze drawn to his rangy form as he ran gentle fingers over the stained walls and folded himself down on hands and knees to examine with minute care a corner of the room that appeared, to my untrained eyes, to be empty. At last he approached the body. Even then, his focus was on the great sprays and whorls of blood that encircled it. He seemed almost to read them, staring at them with a singular focus, his grey eyes narrowed, like a scholar striving to translate some ancient language, or a code-breaker attempting to fit a cypher to an unfamiliar pattern.
For perhaps the first time since I had known him, Holmes seemed lost for words. His eyes raked my face, from my ears to my cheeks, then down to my jaw and my lips. I felt the weight of his gaze like a caress. But still he said nothing.
Sherlock freezes. His heart stutters alarmingly and then begins beating much harder and faster than usual. He closes his eyes and wonders why he feels like he’s just shot up. His body is crackling with sudden inexplicable electricity but instead of working better, quicker, more smoothly, his brain has slowed right down. John is still talking, squared up to Sherlock like he wants to punch him, but Sherlock’s mind isn’t working properly. He’s broken.
Sherlock stands and reaches for his shirt. Nothing the dry cleaner will be able to do. Those stains aren’t going to come out. Sighing, he drops the ruined silk into the bathroom bin.
“I must admit I would relish the chance to duel with her again,” he mused. “I rarely fail, and it is not a sensation I enjoy.”
The case has achieved its aims – John reacted exactly as he was supposed to and Sherlock will have plenty of time to analyse his own reaction later – but Sherlock still likes this part. Showing off, John calls it, but if he doesn’t explain his deductions the police will never figure it out for themselves, even with the solution in front of them. Can't work backwards, let alone forwards. The state of the British police force is a tragedy, really. Except for Sherlock personally, of course, for whom it's a bit of a boon.
By the time the appointed hour came for the woman to pay her visit, I was glazed with exhaustion, and yet my nerves were in such a state of tension that I was almost trembling. Holmes was as calm and controlled as ever and seemed to have slept for the first time in several days. He partook of an unusually hearty breakfast and it was I who picked at my food, my appetite subdued and my stomach churning.
“Lie down,” he ordered breathlessly, his shadow falling across me as I lowered myself onto the grass, warm and springy beneath my shoulder blades. He reached for his coat and I smiled as I saw him draw a small tin of Vaseline from the pocket, more evidence of the planning he had put into this surprise encounter. A moment later he was kissing me, insinuating slippery fingers between my cheeks as his lips devoured mine. I cried out as he sank one long finger inside me, pressing unerringly just where I needed him. Then he was drawing back, far sooner than usual, lifting me and opening me with two hands under my thighs so that he could replace his finger with the thick, insistent press of his cock.
“I am unaffected,” I said, knowing that the lie was as clear in my voice as it doubtless was on my face.
“It may be so,” said Holmes gently. “Whatever his intentions, I am certainly glad that he abandoned his attempt. Mr Phelps, your friend was not the man you thought he was but his sister is a good woman. I fancy that, just as they share certain similarities in appearance, they both possess the same strong spirit and ability to love with great fervour. But while Harrison’s flaws have turned him into a ruthless and dangerous man, I do not believe his sister shares his weakness of character. She is, I believe, everything that he presents himself to be and more. She has cared for you amid the greatest misfortune of your lifetime. I believe she will continue to care for you now that that misfortune has passed.”
He laughed, and, still laughing, came quickly across the room and kissed me on the mouth. Moments of unguarded, straight-forward affection such as these between us were rare, particularly when Holmes was distracted by a case, and I felt my heart leap within my chest at the sensation.
Holmes was still fully clothed and the contrast between my state of naked need and his formal attire, upset only by the disarray of his dark hair, the wild glitter of his dark eyes and the unfastened opening of his trousers only heightened my lust. But when I began to roll over, ready to beg if that’s what it took to feel him inside me, he stopped me with a firm hand on my hip.
“He is none of your concern,” Holmes replied, with all his damnable arrogance. “He is a problem that I'm taking care of and that I will be better equipped to handle once you are no longer living at Baker Street.”
In answer he kissed me again and I lost myself in him for a few moments, intoxicated by how it felt to finally express everything I felt for him without fear.
“A Stradivarius,” she observed, in the tone of a lover murmuring confidences across the pillow. “You play.” It was a statement, not a question.
Then he turned to face me again, continuing savagely: “Am I to be above such things, then? Is it to be acceptable for Dr John Watson to give up on his august career saving lives and abandoned his many friends, to waste his days following at the heels of a heartless automaton and to drown his sorrows in the whisky bottle every night, but not for a consulting detective with no friends and no lives to save to indulge in his own escape from the hideous mundanity of life?”
John throws his head back so hard that it smacks against the tiles. The impact makes a hollow thudding sound and Sherlock fights the urge to lean forward and grip John’s delicate skull between his hands, to hold it still so that John can’t do that again.
“What work?” I asked involuntary, half aware that the conversation had taken a strange turn but relieved to leave behind the subject of my many vices.
“You did nothing of the kind,” I expostulated, tightening my fingers in his hair. “It was I who threw myself into the path of danger – against your express instructions, in case you have forgotten – because I was unjustifiably angry with you and wished to indulge my ego. Had you not figured out where to find me, I would not be lying here with you. I would be in the ground.”
It had been John who had thrown the remains of a cup of tea over the burning drug and wrestled Sherlock out of the kitchen into the hall, slamming the door and half-dragging him to the bathroom. Sherlock had been leaning over the stuff when he’d set it alight and had inhaled a lung full of the smoke immediately. Maybe one of the experiments he’d run had destabilised it because the stick had burned like a sparkler, crackling madly as it filled the room with toxic smoke quicker than he would have thought possible. If John hadn’t moved as quickly as he had, they’d both be as dead as their murder victim. Sherlock doesn’t particularly want to remember the thoughts that went through his mind as he lay on the bathroom floor listening to John swearing between bouts of retching. Whatever the drug is, it’s clearly not recreational. No one would pay to experience that.
We met at the laboratory, where I found Holmes once again immersed in some experiment, surrounded by test tubes and liquids. It was a short ride to the address of our new lodgings, at 221B, Baker Street, and as I sat beside him in the hansom I strove to make conversation without dwelling too much on the imposing presence beside me. Despite his leanness, Holmes' height and the wiry strength of his body, evident even beneath his suit and ulster, lent him an air of suppressed power. Just as he had at our first meeting, he seemed to be humming with barely suppressed excitement, and I could only conclude that his experiments had gone well.
“His fiancée is an interesting woman. Of quite a different temperament than your friend. He seems to be of a most delicate disposition and his physical state is hardly more robust. He is as slender as a rake. But perhaps his slight build accentuates his frailty in the wake of his unfortunate illness.”
“Precisely. I had already left when I received your message, but I know that you do not ask for such details if they are not crucial to the case, even if you do not see fit to share your reasoning. I wired to the manager of the hotel there immediately.”
“What has my watch to do with my habit of imbibing,” I asked coldly, for it was clear that he was mocking me, though for what purpose I could not surmise.
“There is this man,” said the inspector, pointing a dramatic finger at Holmes. “He was in the room the entire time, as the locked door attests.”
I had agreed to make my way to the corner of the street, where Holmes would re-join me. But, secure in my hiding place outside the window, I could not resist waiting for the smoke to clear. Gradually, the thick roiling cloud began to dissipate and, moving in its depths, I spied two figures standing at either end of the room, one tall and imposing, the other petite and as curvaceous as Holmes was angular. As I watched, the woman moved with the grace of a dancer through the smoke, gliding towards my friend. When she reached him, she raised herself on her tiptoes and leaned in towards him. He lowered his head to meet her and I saw their faces draw close, as though she were kissing his cheek. In a moment, his hand closed around her upper arm and drew her still closer, until their bodies were flush together. Though I had never seen it from this vantage point, I knew that the angle of his head must look just as it did he was leaning down towards me, about to capture my mouth with his own.
He had taken the lead so firmly the previous night that I half expected him to fight for control, but instead he sank back into the pillows with a half-strangled curse, leaving me to relish the unprecedented sensation of reducing Sherlock Holmes to incoherence. A few minutes later, when he gasped my name, it was not “Watson,” but “John,” that escaped his lips. Had my mouth not been otherwise engaged, I would have been unable to suppress a smile of triumph as he finally succumbed to me, his hands fisting in my hair as he shuddered beneath me. It was not easy to win a battle of wills with Holmes, but on this occasion, although he had had the final word, I felt the game was mine.
“Precisely,” said Holmes. “Succumbing to an attack of fever was perhaps not the most admirable response in a crisis, particularly for a man who has sworn to serve queen and country.”
I sensed Holmes shift beside me and hastily looked away from my old friend, fixing my eyes on Annie Harrison, his fiancée. She was undoubtedly striking, with her olive skin and dark eyes, and her steady gaze radiated a sense of strength and calm that was appealing. Unlike myself, Phelps had never, to my knowledge, taken an interest in women. For a moment I felt a flash of pity for both of them. I was rarely in a position to feel thankful for the fact that I had no living relatives but I was struck forcibly by the thought that my isolation allowed me far greater freedom than most of my countrymen, who must marry or face the suspicion, disappointment or even ruin of their families.
Although my nights still passed slowly, my days had improved immeasurably since moving to Baker Street. Holmes’ company proved to be stimulating beyond my expectations. We grew closer as the weeks passed, often lingering over the breakfast or supper table engaged in conversation. During these discussions, we seldom dwelt on anything personal. Holmes seemed to enjoy hearing stories of my time studying medicine and I began to tell him anecdotes about various mishaps and misunderstandings and the antics of some of the other young doctors, which often made him smile and once or twice even caused him to laugh. This he did in perfect silence, yet his mirth shook his whole body and it began to be a goal of mine to induce it. I would spend whole nights sometimes, when the dreams were bad and sleep eluded me, running through possible stories in my head in search of one that Holmes might find amusing. For his part, he was able to speak at length and in great detail about a wide range of esoteric subjects, and although I had not formerly thought myself interested in the working of the Russian royal family or the history of a particular jewel, or many of the other eccentric topics on which Holmes chose to hold forth, he spoke with such confidence and authority and his knowledge was so extensive and exacting that I found myself riveted, no matter the topic. If the fact that my enjoyment was heightened by the way those otherworldly eyes glittered in his pale face as he spoke, and I often found myself half-hypnotised by the way his elegant hands described swooping gestures through the air in illustration of his speech, I told myself that I would be just as fascinated if he was not one of the most strange and striking men I had ever seen.
“By throwing yourself into him when he was passing the window? By making sure you both fell two storeys onto solid concrete? That. That was really the best sodding plan your genius brain could come up with?”
Holmes shifted in his seat, adjusting his long legs and turning his eyes to the window, telegraphing an air of disinterest.
It was as I had feared – everything I felt for him was contained in that single word. The raw, strangled cry of “Sherlock” seemed to echo between us as we collapsed onto the bed, both breathless and coated with sweat. The thick smell of our spent desire hung heavy in the room.
He pushed my shirt slowly upwards, surveying the expanse of stomach he had revealed as carefully as I had often seen him examine a crime scene for footprints. I steeled myself to calm, resisting the urge to squirm beneath his gaze. Perhaps sensing the urgency of my need, he did not stop to remove my clothing but reached straight for the fastening of my trousers. When he took me in his firm grip, I let out a low moan, and his eyes slid closed for a just a moment, his pulse fluttering in his slim neck. Then he was leaning forward, slowly, teasing me, as confident in his own power as I had ever see him. When his mouth engulfed me, and I felt the first sweep of his tongue, I finally allowed myself to close my eyes. To my mortification, a few slow, deep strokes were enough to bring me to the brink and in a matter of minutes I felt myself tense all over, unable to hold back any longer. Uncannily attuned to my every move, Holmes ceased his ministrations for a moment and drew back, kneeling between my legs.
“Very well, if your friend desires to see you alone, do not let me come between you,” he said, as he folded his tall body into his chair and began to pack the bowl with coarse shag.
“You knew the crime scene was faked from the beginning, didn’t you?” he says. “You knew it wasn’t a snake that killed the sister.”
“It was the brother. Obvious. Even Lestrade would have got there eventually,” Sherlock concedes. “But it’s not enough to know who did it. I needed to know how.”
The words taste foreign. Sherlock abhors apologising. He never does anything he doesn’t mean to do and therefore he never does anything he wants to apologise for. But John is normal – in this particular way, at least – and he likes apologies. And John is also angry and that was an unintended side-effect of what Sherlock decided to do, so maybe an apology is appropriate. He waits.
At the strange look Stamford gave me over his wineglass, I immediately regretted my choice of words, though I had intended them to have no hidden meaning. I had always been careful to conduct my affairs discreetly at Bart’s, yet suddenly I feared that some unsavoury rumour about my lifestyle had reached his ears.
“His life?” I exclaimed. “I have no doubt that the opium did him little good, but I would not go so far as to say that his life was in danger. He was in much better condition than you, in fact. Breakfast at Baker Street was more than 70 hours ago. I know you are strong but you even you cannot live on air.”
He waits until he hears the shower start up and then presses his face into John’s pillow and says it, letting the fabric soak up his words like water. “I love you, John.” Afterwards, the pillow looks exactly the same but Sherlock can’t shake the feeling – illogical, ridiculous – that it’s different.
Holmes initiated our erotic encounters quite as often as I did, most frequently when we returned from tackling a particularly complicated or dangerous case. The high that he experienced after solving a particularly complex puzzle, he also seemed to find in danger, and once or twice when we returned to Baker Street after being held at gunpoint or engaged in a brawl, I could feel his eyes on me all the way home in the hansom. On those occasions, Holmes barely waited for me to lock the door before his clever hands were divesting me of my hat and coat, his lips pressing eager kisses into the curve of my throat. The fact that the dangers we faced had the same effect on my own libido elevated these encounters to the hellish or sublime. One night, when we returned from an unexpected tussle with an assassin armed with a kitana, I found myself so desperate for Holmes that I could even not bring myself to stitch up the shallow but lengthy gash in his back before I had slaked both our need. I pressed bruises into his skin and he kissed my split lip until it flowed red and we lost ourselves in the taste of violence as he had me on the floor, both of us smeared with sweat and our commingled blood and half-mad with desire.
I cut him off with a kiss that caught him mid-sentence, mindless with need. I was slowly growing accustomed to the astounding fact that Holmes truly wanted me with the same fervour as I wanted him, but he had never before admitted to having such thoughts about me. I had not known whether or not he had considered engaging in such acts before the night that I first kissed him. The thought of him taking his cock in his hand and pleasuring himself to fantasies of me on my knees as I did the same upstairs, my mind preoccupied with a very similar scenario, was painfully arousing. Drawing back, breathless and aching, I caught his face in my hands, realising suddenly that I would never forgive myself if I passed up the opportunities afforded by his uncharacteristically communicative mood.
Holmes turned to me, letting his hand slide to my shoulder and meeting my murky green eyes with his piercing grey ones.
“Damn you,” he hissed. His face was twisted with anger and his strong hands clenched into fists at his sides. He took two heavy steps towards Holmes, only to stop as Bradstreet raised his own weapon warningly, his face furrowed with disappointment, anger and sadness.
When I finally made it to the Bow Street station the following morning, after a night very nearly as sleepless as those I had spent when Holmes was missing, I demanded to speak to him on the pretext of questioning him about the whereabouts of my friend. I could not have gained admittance were it not for the happy chance that the two constables on duty had several times called on Holmes for help and recognised me immediately.
Then the faces of my brigade were crowding around me once again and the air was full of the hacking cough of the bone saw and the smell of blood and rot and I was calling out the names of my friends in desperation as they died one by one.
Holmes asked a few desultory questions about Phelps’ people at the foreign office and then lapsed once again into silence. His eyes were still closed.
Several times, I came close to asking Holmes what his profession might be but I sensed that the question would be an unwelcome one. So grateful was I for his tact with regards to my own history and situation that I felt unable to probe too deeply into his life without invitation. Nevertheless, I found my mind was often fixated on the mystery of Holmes and his strange set of acquaintances and I passed many hours in trying to ascertain what could tie his eclectic array of clients together and how they might be linked to him.
“It never occurred to me that you could feel as I did,” I said softly, running a hand through his dark hair, admiring the way it slipped through my fingers like fine silk. “I do not pretend that I have no qualities to recommend me. Before the war, in fact, I was thought rather handsome in certain circles. But you could have anyone you wanted.”
The culmination of that strange and macabre case I have detailed elsewhere, but I will add here that it was the moment when I made the first big leap in understanding that allowed me to begin to truly know Holmes. Although murder had been committed, the case was far from black and white, and in the patient way he listened to Jefferson Hope’s story and the understanding written on his fine features I saw that he was moved by the man’s tale of loss and revenge. I began to realise that Holmes’ coldness stemmed from his determination to base his deductions solely on facts and to suspect that perhaps he was not incapable of feeling emotions, only unusually capable of suppressing them.
By the time Lestrade arrives to take control of the crime scene, Dr Roylott has stopped pretending to be dead and John has secured his wrists just a shade too tightly with a plastic twist tie to prevent him attempting to brain anyone again. His face has turned such a vivid shade of puce that Sherlock is half-convinced he’s going to have a heart attack before he can be taken into custody but their client has stopped sobbing hysterically and seems ready to give a statement. As Lestrade’s team mill around, messing up the crime scene, Anderson glares at Sherlock and keeps repeating as loudly as he can that Sherlock’s wasting all of their time, the women’s sister wasn’t murdered four years ago, it had been an accidental death. Some sort of fit. He’d been in charge of the forensics himself. Sherlock rolls his eyes and contemplates stealing Lestrade’s cigarettes.
Having finished his cigarette, Holmes busied himself with his pipe. I felt a rush of affection for him as I realised how often he happened to allow his attention to be diverted just at the moment that our clients were overcome.
“No one in that room could have failed to notice how I feel about you,” he interrupted me, almost angrily. “I knew what needed to be done but I could not stand there and pretend to feel only the concern of a friend as you breathed your last in front of me. At first I was not thinking at all, and then, when I began to be certain that you would recover, I could not bear it. The thought of telegraphing indifference as you lay there with blue lips, your chest barely moving, sickened me. I should have done it anyway. Instead I put us both in danger. I could not bring myself to call you Watson, to touch you clinically, to stand back as someone else tended to you. I could not even let go of your hand. So I cried your name like an idiot and clutched at you like a man who has just lost everything – in front of an audience of policemen and criminals. You ought to be furious with me.”
Mr Jabez Wilson was a stout man with a head of fiery red hair that blazed like a beacon in the middle of our sitting room as he stood twisting his hands and fidgeting on the very rug where Holmes had so recently driven me to a state of ecstasy. The memory of his hand on my chest as he bore me to the ground threatened to bring a flush to my cheeks and I had to glance away quickly. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw the ghost of a smile flicker across Holmes’ features, but when I glanced over at him the beam of his attention was turned with its full intensity on Mr Wilson, who had taken a seat on the sofa, placing his faded top hat and worn overcoat beside him.
It was the first time that Holmes, who was usually meticulously careful never to do anything that might arouse suspicion about the nature of our relationship, appeared to have forgotten our surroundings. He pulled me straight down onto one of the beds in the rapidly darkening room, the rough tweed of his clothes rubbing against my bare skin as he kissed me. When he began to unbutton his waistcoat, I had to remind him to close the curtains, which he did swiftly and impatiently. Returning immediately to the bed, he knelt and, in one graceful move, engulfed me in his mouth, taking me all the way to the root so suddenly that I cried out and thought for an instant that matters would be over before they had truly started. Sensing my predicament, he held still for a few moments, allowing me to adjust to the sensation, and then he began to move, bringing me almost to the brink before drawing back and rising up the bed to kiss me. Three times he repeated this exquisite torture, always ceasing his ministrations just as I felt myself on the verge of release, until I was damp with sweat and writhing with need that had crossed the line from pleasurable to painful.
Sherlock turns out the light. Then he peels off his filthy trousers, ignoring the throbbing pain in his side and shoulder, and crawls in behind John. He debates touching the stiff, silent form in front of him and decides against it.
Holmes quirked one dark eyebrow, a gesture I had had cause to notice in the past. It lent him a rakish air that I had tried and failed not be affected by.
Lucky Anderson is as inept a boxer as he is a forensics expert – and Sherlock uses the term sarcastically. Sherlock is rubbing his jaw more for effect than because he’s in any actual pain as Lestrade cuts the plastic binding Roylott's wrists and replaces it with handcuffs, rolling his eyes at Sherlock in a transparent attempt to hide the fact that he’s as amused as he is exasperated.
John is gasping into his neck, slumped atop him, careful not to put too much pressure on Sherlock's stiches. Sherlock’s heart is thrumming, racing like he’s just injected too much cocaine. He closes his eyes and focuses on counting the beats, blocking everything but numbers from his mind. He waits until his breathing slows, falling into a quiet rhythm, until John shifts and let out a long contented breath and Sherlock slides out of him on a rush of warm fluid. Before John can move away, Sherlock places one large hand on the back of his neck and stops him.
All that afternoon, as I worked on recording a recent case in which Holmes had saved a woman’s life by identifying a coded message buried in a series of whistles that sounded like bird song, half my mind was on his return and the best way to properly reward him for that kiss. By supper, when he had not returned, I was a little put out. By midnight I was dismayed. It was unlike him not to send a telegram if a case had presented itself that required him to remain from home for so long a stretch. The following morning, when I rose to find his bed unslept in and no word from him, I began to be concerned. I spent the day in a fruitless effort to track him down, wiring to Lestrade and Gregson, questioning Mrs Hudson and even searching Holmes’ bedroom for clues, wishing I had even a fraction of his talent for turning data into deductions.
He’s not looking at Sherlock and that’s wrong. He should be glaring, full of tension, larger and stronger, not smaller and weaker. He should be telling Sherlock he loves him, not what? Breaking up with him? Is that what's happening here? Sherlock feels sick, all of a sudden.
“And what, pray, would you have done to ensure the retreat of the foul creature?” he said. “You ran towards it with no weapon on your person. I did not realise that a campaign in Afghanistan qualified you to kill snakes with your bare hands. Congratulations, doctor, your skills are more varied than I realised.”
“Wake up, you idiot!” my voice was shaking. “Tell me how much you took. You could have killed yourself. You still might, if you do not wake up and tell me exactly what was in that syringe.”
“I do not doubt it,” he replied, running the pad of his index finger across my lower lip until I let my mouth fall open and he could slip it gently inside. “But that does not mean I am not grateful that his attention is otherwise occupied, leaving you free to practice your own remarkable skills on me.”
He held out one hand, imperiously, for the letter. His fingers were just inches from my shoulder and I realised suddenly that it was the closest he had come to touching me in days. The thought sent a wave of pain through me and a joking retort died on my lips. I turned away, hiding my face from him, and found myself picking up the letter and placing it in his outstretched palm without meeting his eyes. I needed his attention to be focused on anything but me. The letter was a certain distraction.
When Holmes pushed back the lace trim on Miss Stoner’s sleeve to reveal the bruises that marred the delicate skin of her wrist, I felt a thrill of sympathy beyond that I usually experienced towards our clients. Knowing Holmes as I did, I could see that he was similarly moved, though he gave no outward sign. It was the gentleness of his touch and the softness of his voice as he remarked on the cruelty she had been subjected to at the hands of her stepfather that betrayed an uncharacteristic tenderness towards a stranger. Although I had accused him of heartlessness several times, and I well knew that to those who were not as intimate with him as I he appeared cold and mechanical, I also knew that Holmes felt things more deeply than he ever allowed himself to reveal. Insistent as he was that emotion was the antithesis of the pure, cold reasoning by which he solved his puzzles and so helped his clients, I had seen how it affected him when he failed them. When he volunteered to travel immediately to Stoke Moran, I knew that he believed the threat against Miss Stoner’s to be grave indeed. The inexplicable fear that coursed through me at that instant was not for myself, nor, I confess, for our client, but for Holmes. I had seen him brave all kinds of dangers in the course of his cases but I had a strange feeling of foreboding.
“When I saw you enter the den, I assumed you had come in search of me,” said Holmes. “I knew that the inspector would recognise you and that there was a chance that your presence would threaten my disguise. So I withdrew to the room upstairs where you would not catch sight of me. I watched from the window as you left with Whitney but then I saw Wainwright approaching and cried out, intending to warn you. I did not think that he would attempt to harm you out in the open, but he is a ruthless man and a desperate one. It is our great luck that Wainwright chose to follow you back into the den and not to do away with Whitney while he was unguarded and out of his wits.”
When I at last took pity on him and ceased caressing the heavy outline of his desire through the thick material of his trousers, I slid my hand inside his garments and took his swollen member in my hand. He closed his eyes and threw his head back, the cords standing out in his neck as he hissed through his teeth. I bent my head, intending to reward him for his patience but, taking my face in both hands, he held me away from him as he stood suddenly. Extending a hand to me, he pulled me to my feet, tugging me after him into the bedroom.
“Most interesting,” he said, as I came to the end of my recital. We were not yet in sight of the house and I waited for him to say more, but he lapsed into silence, staring into the distance.
Holmes readied himself for sleep and lay down in the undisturbed bed. I slid between the sheets of the other, from which all traces of our encounter had been carefully erased. I was so tired that my whole body was aching but I had never felt further from sleep. The image of the snake coiled around the dead man’s head rose again behind my eyes, followed by Holmes’ rictus of horror as he stared at me over the second match. I knew that if I did manage to sleep, my dreams were certain to be filled with terror. It struck me then that perhaps it would after all be best if I did not succumb to slumber. Despite Holmes’ presence during my fever and his knowledge of my nightmares, I had no wish for him to witness me in their grip for a second time. I lay still, listening. His breathing was quiet and even, but I did not think he was asleep.
“Good night,” John murmurs, and Sherlock grunts and wraps one long arm around John’s chest, nestling his hand under John’s chin.
His words, combined with his touch, were threatening to end matters more precipitously than I wished. Unwilling to waste this rare and precious chance to be with him outside the well-secured confines of a locked room, I grasped him by the wrist, stilling his hand where it was still wrapped around both our lengths.
For this reason, or so he led me to believe, Phelps ended our association abruptly upon his final day at school, flushed with excitement at having been granted a well-deserved scholarship at Cambridge. He was characteristically kind about it, but his leave-taking left no doubt that we had no future and I did not attempt to dissuade him. In later years, I heard that he had won a good position at the foreign office, but after leaving school he had passed from my life and I had heard nothing further from him. Nor did I ever expect to. So it was with surprise as well as some trepidation that I finished perusing a letter that had arrived one morning at Baker Street, addressed in an unfamiliar hand. In it, Phelps expressed no doubt that I would remember him, before mentioning our respective forms in a way that suggested rather the contrary. His tone was uncharacteristically dramatic as he implored me to inveigle Holmes into visiting him at his home in Woking to help him with a mysterious misfortune so severe that it had precipitated an attack of brain fever. The letter was dictated, he explained in closing, and was signed, “Your old school-fellow, Percy Phelps.”
Unable to meet his eye, I stepped over to the window, where I watched Miss Morstan make her way down the street, a graceful, elegant figure with energy in her step. Behind me, I heard Holmes settle back onto the sofa and begin the familiar ritual of lighting his pipe, which he often smoked when immersed in deep thought.
Holmes half lifted me until I was kneeling in front of him, slumped in his arms, barely conscious of anything except the horror of my awakening and the pain in my head. He propped me up with an arm around my shoulders. With his free hand, he gripped one of mine so tightly that I thought he would cut off the circulation. Making an effort to see through blurry eyes, I saw that his lips were moving and realised with a jolt that he was still mouthing my name, a silent litany.
“I am quite well, John,” he replied, as informally as though we were still schoolboys. “Let us take a turn around the garden. I will call Annie and ask her to sit here for a spell.”
Several hours later, after I had bathed and gently bandaged Holmes’ fingers and we had made love with an urgent tenderness that I had never imagined possible, we lay together in his bed, his head on my chest and his long legs entangled with mine.
I could see Holmes’ suppressed excitement at the possibility of a new case as he coaxed his client, Miss Mary Morstan, to detail the mystery that plagued her. Although the shaking of her hands gave away her extreme agitation, I was impressed by her commendable composure as she shared her tragic story, describing the death of her mother during her infancy and the mysterious disappearance of her father some years later, just as she had thought to have him finally returned to her at the end of his service in India.
“I came close to doing it,” he confided, pressing a soft kiss to my jaw, just below my ear. “It was a few weeks before the affair of the Red-Headed League and you had been staring at me over your newspaper again, with your thoughts writ plain upon your face. I had been fighting the urge to kiss you for hours by the time we went to see that Austrian violinist, Wilma Norman-Naruda. Do you remember? She played with such unbridled passion.”
“But why on earth would he attempt to break into your sick room?” I demanded. “It is preposterous. My dear fellow, are you quite sure that you were not dreaming?”
“What on earth is a consulting detective?" I retorted, stung to sharpness. “It does not sound a very useful profession. Do you mean that you work in some part-time capacity as a private investigator? Or perhaps you investigate people’s private affairs in the hope of discovering a scandal that will pay?”
“He cannot have fled,” the mans said. “The door was locked from the inside and this old beggar hardly seems likely to have aided him in a quick escape. Besides, the only way out is the stairs and we did not pass him coming up.”
“We are not all as observant as you,” I reminded him, as he delicately began to tug loose the folds of my cravat.
“If you are not in the right humour for detective work, you need not concern yourself with it. I do not imagine I shall need your assistance at this stage of proceedings.”
“Fascinating?” I echoed. I had never heard him use the word about anything but a particularly difficult case.
“Mr Holmes,” she said, turning back to my friend. “I believe that you are empowered to negotiate on behalf of your client.”
“From the beginning, I had assumed that your interest in me lay in the novelty of my profession and certain of my physical attributes which, for some reason, you seemed to find appealing, despite the fact that you are muscular and square-jawed and have the face of an Adonis and I am as gaunt and shadowed as a crow and look like I am in the early stages of consumption. That you were gradually becoming aware of my many flaws I knew very well – you laid them out in quite dispassionate detail in your stories.”
Holmes pulled away from the kiss with an insistence that was almost violent. “I can see why your particular interests might make marriage to Miss Morstan a less than appealing proposition,” he said. His lips were swollen and his chest was rising and falling quickly beneath his shirt, now unbuttoned all the way down to his finely muscled stomach, but his mocking voice demonstrated that he had retained his usual iron composure.
“So far. Fuck, Sherlock. You ended up in hospital. You needed almost forty stitches. They were on the verge of giving you a blood transfusion, for god’s sake. You’d already solved the case. Why did you have to taunt her like that? It’s like you’re trying to get yourself killed.”
I have already written of my first encounter with Sherlock Holmes, but I must admit in these private memoirs that there remain many details of the first weeks and months of our acquaintance that I felt it necessary to omit from my public account. I mentioned, I think, that my time as a Doctor of Medicine in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers had brought me nothing but misfortune and disaster. That was the truth and I am guilty only of recording in too little detail what that meant. After the fateful shooting at the battle of Maiwand, I was left with a shattered bone and a damaged artery, but far worse were the wounds inflicted upon my mind. The effects of prolonged agony on the human body I was only too familiar with, having witnessed pain and suffering in Afghanistan that I had never imagined during my medical training in London. What I was not prepared for was the toll the war and my own injury would take on my mental fortitude.
Sherlock meant it when he told John that he doesn’t have a death wish and he’s not trying to make John angry anymore, so it’s not a calculation but a misstep, a tiny error of judgement, which leads to disaster. Sherlock miscalculates a step and trips ungracefully over the edge of a Turkish rug as he’s drawing back from the knife-wielding murderer whose husband Sherlock has just deduced is lying in pieces under the floorboards on which they stand. She catches him in the sternum with the tip of the blade and draws it all the way across the right side of his chest to his shoulder before John tackles her and she thuds to the ground under his weight, the knife skittering away under the sofa where Sherlock must remember to tell Lestrade to look for it later.
He plunged the syringe in his hand into a bottle and I saw him fill it with an enormous dose of the clear, deadly drug – a dose that even a healthy man could not possibly survive. As he lent towards me to administer it, Holmes turned on his heel and walked away.
I ushered her to the sofa and returned to my seat, hoping that the lamplight hid the flush that had stained my cheeks at the mention of Miss Morstan, whom I had so callously set aside for Holmes.
“Do you have more enquiries to make in London, my dear fellow?” I eventually said, attempting a casual tone.
I drew close and leaned across him to help myself to a cigarette from his case and as I did so he ran a finger down my neck and into the folds of my cravat.
As the weeks dragged on, these dalliances grew fewer and I spent increasing amounts of time alone, drowning my sorrows in the whisky bottle. I avoided mirrors assiduously, unable to meet the eyes of the man who stared back at me, a wasted shell of a person, scarred and broken, who I often found myself unable to recognise. Such was the state of affairs when I realised to my horror that my free spending had left me in a desperate position and that new lodgings must be sought without delay, were I to continue to afford numbing escape from the nightly terror of my dreams and to remain amid the stink and bustle of London. An enforced stay in the quiet of the countryside, I feared, might very well be the death of me.
“The case Holmes is engaged in solving is very sensitive,” I said, tearing my eyes from his still form and turning to the constable. “I must have a few minutes alone with the prisoner so that I may report back to him on a few crucial details.”
Young Stamford, I must admit, had never much interested me at Bart’s, but I was surprised by my own relief and enthusiasm when I saw him at the Criterion Bar, where I was engaged in an attempt to dull my mind after a night in which I had not managed more than a few snatched moments of sleep. I had not until then acknowledged the toll that my lonely existence had taken upon me, but the sight of a familiar face filled me with an unreasoning joy, perhaps in part due to my gratitude that he took such care not to remark on my pitiful appearance and the earliness of the hour at which I had sought out a drink. As we rattled through the streets in a hansom, he questioned me gently as to my presence in London, noting my thin frame and brown skin but kindly omitting to mention my red eyes and hollow cheeks. When he mentioned a friend in need of a fellow to share his lodgings, over a lunch I picked at, bereft of appetite, I jumped at the chance. I preferred any means of remaining in London to the deathly silence of the countryside, though I knew at heart that I would be lucky to find a man anywhere in England willing to have me as his constant companion in my current state.
“Ludicrous you may call it now,” I said, withdrawing my wrist from his grip. “It didn't seem that way when she was whispering sweet nothings in your ear.”
At last, uttering an inarticulate sound of need, he rose to his knees and pressed one more hungry kiss on my lips. When I pulled away, no longer able to resist the promise of losing myself inside him, I turned him within the circle of my arms so that he was kneeling before me, his back flush with my chest. Henry, too, had usually chosen to take the more active role in our coupling and it had longer than I cared to remember since I had felt the slick heat of a man's body surrounding me. I was shaking as I grasped one of Holmes' angular hips and pressed myself against him. Sweat had dampened the fine hair at the base of his skull and a tickle ran down between his shoulder blades. A pattern of fine moles painted scattered constellations across the pale skin of his back and I could not resist bending my head to press urgent kisses to them, where they decorated the delicate knobs of his spine, as I finally slid inside him. My own gasp was lost alongside the deep moan that escaped his lips as his body opened for me.
Stung by his tone and his evident distaste for Phelps, whose depleted physical condition was, after all, not of his own volition, I responded hotly.
Holmes gave a bitter laugh, looking away from me. “You did not notice,” he muttered. “I should have known. Your lack of observational skill has hardly failed to impress itself upon me.”
Never by word or gesture had Holmes suggested the possibility of such an encounter. He was so natural a leader, both in and out of bed, that switching the roles into which we had so naturally fallen had never occurred to me. To my surprise, however, a dark thrill blossomed within me at the thought and I felt my member twitch with excitement. When I leaned forward to kiss him, I found that he was trembling very slightly in my arms. I wondered if I should be ashamed by the fact that his loss of control only sent a further pulse of arousal through me. Wordlessly, I began to unbutton his shirt, my eyes fixed on his until our locked gaze had held so long that it began to feel dangerous. I turned aside then, busying myself with removing his clothes. I was afraid of what, eventually, he must surely see in my eyes.
“When you’ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,” John says, as though reciting something.
“You still could have been hurt. Why couldn’t you just have told me what was going to happen? I could have helped. Made sure you weren’t bitten.”
He turned to Holmes, lying as if insensible under his heap of rags, looking as haggard and withered as the addicts slowly poisoning themselves below.
The tenderness in his voice moved me more than I expected and I reached out to pat the thin hand that lay beside mine. I was gladder than I knew how to express to find that, after all, what lay between him and his fiancée was built on genuine regard.
John looks down at the floor. When he looks back up, his face makes Sherlock’s heart do something strange.
John raises himself on his arms above Sherlock, looking down into his face. His expression is very serious.
The voice in the darkness, smooth and deep, could have belonged to no one but Sherlock Holmes. His innocent tone was belied by the heat of his breath ghosting over my member, which he had evidently succeeded in extracting from my nightwear with a delicacy of touch that had failed to awaken me. I was disoriented from my dream and already damp and throbbing from his attentions. In the faint glow of lamplight that leaked into the room, I could just make out the devastating angle of his cheekbones and the glint of his eyes. A moment later, he was in my arms and I was kissing him as though we had been apart for months, rather than a matter of days. Still only half sure that I wasn’t dreaming, I pulled away and addressed him with unusual frankness.
But in the end, I believe, it was the complete and total absence of light that gave me the courage to speak. Surrounded by velvety darkness and the hot, metallic smell of the shielded lantern, listening to the sound of our mingled breaths, I finally found the words to broach the topic that had been foremost in my mind ever since Holmes had spoken of it that morning.
“For someone who observes others so well, you have a shockingly skewed view of yourself,” he said. “Not only are you a doctor and a veteran – with a face and a body that have not ceased occupying my thoughts since the day I met you, I might add – but you seem not to realise that you are also generous and far too forgiving and that, although I am undoubtedly more observant than you – at least when it comes to solving crimes – you are a thousand times wiser than I. It did not take me long to understand that you are also one of the kindest men I’ve ever met. It is a quality I admire so much, I believe, because it is one in which I am manifestly lacking.”
“After all, things did not turn out badly,” Phelps said. “I determined that I had forfeited any right to Annie’s heart and so strove to think no more or her – or her brother, who so evidently regretted what had passed between us. But as the months went by and Joseph continued as though nothing between us had changed, arranging more time than ever spent in the company of myself and his sister, I began to think that, after all, perhaps it was not impossible for me to have a future with Annie. It was evident that she felt as I did, you see – and there was already so much in my past that I could not tell her.”
“You were knocked out. We think they used chloroform,” Lestrade said, when Holmes still said nothing. “The Shlessingers, as they're calling themselves – although Mr Holmes tells me otherwise – had scheduled a funeral for a distant relative this morning. It was a ruse intended to allow them to inter the body of Lady Carfax and of…”
“Not a better man,” he murmured. “Only a more calculating one. I am sorry that I did not send word.”
“I remember seeing Dr Shlessinger's wife come into the shop,” I said aloud at last, unable to bear the silence. “She had a set of earrings that matched the pendant. I had intended to follow her home and then return to Baker Street but she did not go home. She went to meet with an undertaker. I knew then that our time had very nearly run out. I followed her back to her house in Brixton and when she opened the door I rushed inside, determined that I would not leave without Lady Carfax. I had hoped that perhaps she was being held captive awaiting the culmination of their plans. When Shlessinger appeared, I kept him at bay with my revolver and told him I would not leave until I had searched every room. I remember him instructing his wife to call the police. And then nothing until I awoke in the coffin.”
We were not perfect. We both knew how to throw barbs that hooked under each other’s skin and tore. We were not always happy. But we were as happy as we knew how to be – me, a crippled veteran who would never again work as a soldier or a surgeon, and him, an orphaned consulting detective with an opiate dependence, who understood one another better than most husbands ever understand their wives.
Holmes was clearly a man of scientific bent and I confess I was surprised when he mentioned that he played the violin. He laughed off my suggestion that a badly played violin was a din that should not be lived with before I had even finished expressing the thought, as though utterly certain of his own abilities, and I found myself even more intrigued by his extreme confidence, which seemed almost to border on egotism. It was with this same confidence that he declared the matter settled, without waiting for my acquiescence, and something about his certainty calmed my lingering doubts. As I shook his hand, too aware of the strength of his grip and the warmth of his calloused fingers, I was already looking forward to noon the following day, when we would meet again. It was the first time I had looked forward to anything in a very long time.
He closed his eyes and I kissed him softly, but when at last he looked at me I saw that there was still a shadow behind his eyes.
“There goes a very attractive woman,” I remarked, my back still turned. I meant every word of it - and yet perhaps I might not have said it had I not been desperate to put any lingering awkwardness behind us.
“What were your theories?” I asked, resisting the urge to pull his lips back to mine and leave talking for later.
He wants to press himself even closer, to keep tugging John’s small body nearer and nearer his chest until they merge into a single organism, all their atoms and molecules mingling until they are too entangled to ever be separated. It’s an illogical thought and not one he’s ever had before but for some reason it appeals to him. He tightens his arm around John’s chest, tugging him closer, so that every inch of his bare back is blanketed with Sherlock’s chest, and hears a small grunt of satisfaction. John’s eyes are closed, Sherlock knows without looking. He is already drifting into sleep.
I thought of finding Holmes lying in a coffin an inch from death and my arm tightened around him convulsively.
“I am delighted for you, my dear boy,” I said, forbearing to remark on my own circumstances. “But I am afraid I fail to see what this has to do with the treaty or your unfortunate situation.”
My mood was only worsened by the extraordinary appearance of Dr Roylott in our living room, just moments after his step-daughter had left it. His show of strength, when he seized up the poker from the fireside and bent it nearly in half with his gigantic hands, was enough to make a powerful impression, but it was his enormous size and malevolent expression, combined with his rabid fury, that created the impression of a dangerous wild animal caged within the body of man. I have rarely been as disappointed as I was that he left before Holmes picked up the bent poker and, demonstrating the power hidden in his sinewy arms and wiry shoulders, straightened it out again in a single quick movement. As he did so, he glanced at me, gauging my reaction, and I saw the small ripple of satisfaction that passed across his face as he registered that his performance had impressed me.
Holmes turned away from me and methodically removed his coat and hat. Underneath, I could see that he had dressed hurriedly. His shirt was improperly buttoned, and he wore neither tie nor cravat, not even his waistcoat.
I cried out the word without conscious thought, hating the shame and desperation in my tone. I was almost dizzy with shock and horror. How had he discerned so much that I thought I had kept hidden from him? Quick on the heels of raw shame came a wave of anger towards the man who had allowed me to believe that I had him fooled and so to continue making a fool only of myself. I sat frozen in shock and mortification for several seconds longer, hoping that the pain I felt at Holmes' words did not show on my face as plainly as I feared it must. For one who had seen so much to have interpreted my expression should not have surprised me, and yet I hardly knew what to think when Holmes’ hawk-like face suddenly softened, and he leaned towards me as though involuntarily, clutching at my sleeve.
All that afternoon we spent in the grounds of Baskerville Hall, alone and free, as though what we were doing was not dangerous, as though we had no need to fear discovery and ruin, no threat of ostracism or exile or a criminal conviction followed by hard labour hanging over our heads. We swam in the cool, clear waters of the lake, washing the traces of lovemaking from our bodies, and lay to dry side by side on the grassy bank, the sun warm on our skin, talking in a low pitch and laughing as though the moment would last forever.
I had half expected Holmes to refuse to travel to Woking on such abstruse summons, but to my surprise he handed back the letter and turned away, speaking to me over his shoulder as he headed to the rack for his overcoat.
Holmes led us on a slow perambulation of the house, falling into step with Harrison while Phelps, who was moving even more slowly than he had that morning, lent upon my arm for support. I saw Harrison lead Holmes over to the fence, where they stood for some time, talking earnestly. I tried to focus my attention on Phelps, who I feared might soon be in need of medical attention, were his mental strain not alleviated, but I could not help glancing frequently towards Holmes. After a few minutes, I saw that Phelps’ erstwhile lover and future brother-in-law was leaning back against the wooden rails, looking up at Holmes, who loomed over him like a Roman statue. They were standing rather close and although I could not hear what words passed between them, I saw Holmes shoulders begin to shake and realised he was laughing in his silent way. Harrison was grinning up at him and wore on his face a familiar look – one I had felt on my own countenance all too often when I was moved to hilarity by Holmes’ infectious laughter.
Only days earlier, Holmes had remarked that even the best women were never entirely to be trusted – an abominable sentiment but one that I felt he might equally have applied to all mankind, given his innate suspicion of the motives of everyone who crossed his path and his seeming aversion to emotional attachments of any kind. I had also taken it to mean, however, that he was attracted exclusively to men. Now I saw that I might have been mistaken.
Holmes sat beside me on the crate, his shoulder pressed to mine, and we resumed our silent vigil. I do not know how much time passed but I found that the worries and questions that had plagued my mind all day no longer intruded on my thoughts. I was content to sit in companionable silence, listening to Holmes breathing beside me. When at last we heard a scraping sound and saw a sudden gleam of light, he was on his feet in an instant, as swift and silent as cat hunting its prey. He waited, a lithe figure caught in the slowly increasing glow like a performer in the spotlight, as a slit opened in the stone paving of the floor and a white hand began to raise a slab, pushing it upwards until it overturned with a crash.
“That was different,” Sherlock says, exasperated. “Those were deliberate. Anyway, last time you were supposed to get angry. This time was an accident. I didn’t mean to end up in hospital. I hate hospitals. They won’t even give me morphine anymore since Mycroft –”
“That can be arranged,” said Holmes. “My client left with me a certain sum, should such an eventuality arise.”
It was not until he had taken me, slowly and unusually tenderly, his nails digging into my shoulders in the dark as his climax followed fast on the heels of my own, that I thought to ask what he was doing there.
“I am admiring your collection of portraits of criminals,” I prevaricated. A sudden wild joy was rising in me. “Anyone would think they were your heroes, the way you have set them to watch over you as you sleep. Are you certain that you are content being a consulting detective and do not secretly yearn to become a criminal mastermind?”
He walked swiftly to the window and looked out, into the fast-flowing, black waters of the Thames. I went to stand beside him. Lit only by the dim glow of the street lamps and the cool light of the moon, the river looked as dark and deadly as I had ever seen it. A shudder went through me at the thought of Holmes disappearing into its depths.
As I spoke, Holmes had begun to remove my coat, as carefully as if he were aiding an invalid. I stepped out of his reach and swiftly divested myself of the garment, which seemed to weigh twice as much as usual. The thought of Holmes playing the role of nurse to my sickly patient could not be born. The moment I was free of my soaked outer layers, I turned towards the stairs, desperate to reach the safety of my bedroom where, whatever the fever wrought, I would at least be out of his sight.
“You are a better companion than I deserve,” he said quietly. “Do not think that I am unaware of it.”
Joseph Harrison drove us to the station and soon we were ensconced in a private carriage on our way back to London.
“I can see that,” he replied, running one hand down my chest and taking the proof in a proprietorial grip. “Am I to assume that this means you were dreaming about me, or should I make time in my schedule tomorrow to pay some new continental acquaintance of yours a visit and mark my territory thoroughly and egregiously before we proceed with the case?”
“Do you trust me?” Holmes asked, and there was a searching look in his restless grey eyes, as though the question struck deeper than this peculiar circumstance.
“My dear Holmes, surely you cannot mean it?” I said. “Have you lost your senses? Sir Henry may have gone to London but what of his household? What if a gardener should happen by?”
“You cannot mean –” I began, and then checked myself. “Am I to understand that there was a certain… intimacy between you?”
I had no idea how Holmes usually conducted his affairs. Until the previous night, I had seen no evidence that he had ever had any. As passionately as I had wished for the kind of intimacy we had shared, I found myself fearful about how it might affect the friendship which had grown between us, and which, as I had so recently admitted to myself, had become the main source of happiness in my life. That it had also been a source of pain I was only too aware, but the fact that I had been willing to throw it all away for a quiet life with Miss Morstan only two days ago now seemed the height of folly.
When they get home, John waits until Sherlock has hung up his coat and sunk down on the sofa before he speaks.
“Please forgive me,” she said, her agitation clear in her voice and the pallor of her face. “I am very sorry to disturb you so late, but I must speak urgently with Mr Sherlock Holmes.”
“I saw you staring at the marks of the needle on my arm. Don’t tell me you have forgotten already," his tone was cutting, cold and mocking and unfamiliar. "You thought it important enough to attempt to raise it with me only yesterday morning and it had a powerful enough effect on your opinion of me to send you straight into the arms of Miss Morstan. Do I owe you my felicitations, by the way? I rather thought you might return from your outing this evening with some happy news.”
Holmes did not appear to register that I had spoken. His pipe now lit, he was curled in his chair, deep in thought, smoke coiling about his head. When he began abstractedly to loosen his waistcoat and undo the top buttons of his shirt, making ready to sink into one of the pensive fits that could occupy him for hours – sometimes all night – I left him and went up to my room. I bid him goodnight as I left the room, but he did not reply.
“Thank you, doctor, for your astute analysis,” he said. “I believe, however, that it was not the lack of food that affected me but the opium. I was forced to smoke considerably more of it than I had planned and it seems to have left me rather far from my usual self. It was not the opium that threatened My Whitney’s life, but Inspector Wainwright. I have known for some time that a London inspector was preying on the vulnerable of the city and that it was at the Bar of Gold that he hunted. I made some discreet enquiries but somehow he caught wind of my interest. By the time he wrote to me, threatening all sorts of fabricated charges if I did not let well alone, I knew almost everything about his operation. A few payments gained the loyalty of the attendant who you saw yesterday and who is quite terrified of Wainwright. It was he who told me that Whitney was to be his next victim.”
Suddenly, I remembered the police inspector waiting for us at street level and was shocked at the risk we had taken. Holmes stood and began to rearrange his clothes in the darkness. I felt something warm and dry pressed into my hand and realised that he had handed me his handkerchief, an uncharacteristically thoughtful gesture that brought an involuntary smile to my face. I cleaned and dressed myself as swiftly as I could, wondering just how dishevelled we looked as I ran a hand through my hair, attempting to smooth it.
“Two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time,” Sherlock says. He pushes his nose into the curve of John’s neck, where his hairline slants up towards the shell of his ear, and inhales.
I do not now recall how I intended to continue my rambling speech, for at that moment Holmes kissed me with such force that all coherent thought flew from my mind and all I was aware of was the insistent press of his tongue, the soft curl of his hair under my fingers and the rich tobacco scent of him in my nostrils.
Holmes had given no indication of his feelings towards me – other than his obvious, surprising, electrifying appreciation of my battered body. Having often heard him remark on the dangers of sentiment, I had no idea whether he might wish to repeat our unorthodox activities or whether he intended to put them behind us and return to a state of amiable friendship – and I could think of no acceptable way to ask him. I was uncomfortably aware that, having expressed no sexual interest in me, despite, as I now knew, having divined my attraction to him several months ago, Holmes had chosen to escalate our relationship to a physical level only when he was heavily drugged and half crazed with anger. The thought of never being able to kiss him again was more painful than I would ever wish him to know, and yet I could not be sure that he would welcome any attempt on my part to repeat what we had shared. In addition, I could not in good conscience ignore the fact that our activities of the preceding night would be viewed by the wider world as the most repulsive form of perversion and that, should they ever be discovered, Holmes’ life would be destroyed. A detective could not attract clients if he was himself discovered to be engaging in criminal acts, particularly acts of the nature we had indulged in, and I knew that without his puzzles Holmes would never have a moment’s happiness – save, perhaps, at the tip of a needle.
“How are you feeling, my dear doctor?” he said, and I closed my eyes in despair as I realised that he was really lying beside me. I remembered the cool cloth on my brow and understood that he had been ministering to me for hours in my delirium.
“Well, Mr Holmes,” she said, in a deep, musical voice. “I believe it is high time we were honest with one another. I have what you want. All that remains is to determine what you have that I might want in return.”
There was a strange tone to his voice and I found myself desperately trying to remember the roles he had played in my delirious visions, in a futile attempt to guess what I might have said in the grip of the fever. He was still watching me quietly, healthy and uncannily observant and so handsome and whole that I wanted to force him from the room.
Sherlock’s hand stills again. He’s not sure whose heartbeat he can feel but it’s steady and strong, just like John.
The air left my lungs in a rush, as though he had punched me in the stomach. The pain was greater than a physical blow would have been.
The red-headed doctor laughed. “He did not give it to his patients, even when they begged,” he said. “But we shall be more generous than he.”
About those other vices he could never know, but I trusted to my ability to remain discreet, should I ever wish to indulge them again in the future. About my drinking I said nothing, and I did not share the reason for my frequent night-time disturbances, but the shrewd look he gave me from those piercing grey eyes led me to believe that he had perhaps guessed at some of what I left unsaid. I could only hope that it was the nightmares he had read in my face, and not the other aspects of my character that I felt it necessary to keep hidden.
“This man is a tenant of ours and has been alone here these past two days,” he said, gesturing to Holmes’ slumped form. “I don’t know who you are or what you think you saw and nor do I much care. I’ll thank you to leave and stop harassing my customers.”
Holmes stepped very deliberately in front of me, bringing us chest to chest. I had to tilt my head back to see his eyes. The movement brought my lips very close to his.
Leaning down so that our faces were on the same level, I stared into his shadowed eyes, capturing his suddenly evasive gaze
I stood, turning from him as though in disgust, even as all my instincts told me to return to him, to help him from the filthy cell and escort him to Baker Street, where a bath and a good meal and a pipe before the fire might begin to transform him back into the compelling, irrepressible detective whose wellbeing occupied far too many of my thoughts.
“I see that what attracts you to men is not so far from what attracts you to women after all,” Holmes said, somewhat acidly. “I confess, I had assumed that your appreciation for the female form might lead you to choose a rather more substantial specimen when your impulse drew you in direction of men.”
“Are you saying you did not wish to be undressed?” Holmes inquired silkily. “I don’t recall you objecting. In fact, I seem to remember you attempting to tear my shirt off my body. I do not know how I will ever find all the buttons.”
“I have never heard you speak of him besides that one time,” I said, astonished to find that the man lived in London. I had assumed – perhaps due to my own circumstances – that Holmes's family were all dead. “Why do you never see him?”
“Well, perhaps I do not need to tell you how it felt,” he said, with a warm smile. It brought a glint to his eye I had not seen since he was a much younger and less badly used man. “I hope for your sake that you have found someone who makes you feel the way that Annie does me.”
Stamford’s stated misgivings about the man – his eccentric set of interests, including an enthusiasm for science and an aptitude for chemistry – seemed hardly reason enough to object to him, particularly given my own vices, and I hastened to suggest a meeting. I had already partaken of several glasses of wine by the time we made our way to the hospital, Stamford still seeming to wish to impart some obscure warning about Holmes, who he described as cold-blooded and possessed of a passion for exact knowledge. His vague objections, and his wild tale of Holmes beating subjects in the dissecting room with a stick, served only to enhance my curiosity. By the time we reached the hospital, I was so engaged in finding out more about the man that I hardly noticed the familiar sounds and smells that had plunged me into a deplorable state of anxiety on my previous visit, leaving me sweating and shaken and struggling for breath.
“Yeah, I know, high-functioning sociopath,” he says. “Only you’re not. That’s not even a thing. I’ve done the research.”
“Why should she need to sit here if we are to take a walk? Surely it would be better if she were to accompany us? Although you say that you are quite recovered, I fear that you are still not entirely yourself,” I said, as soothingly as I was able.
He smiled at me, his eyes flickering swiftly to where Whitney was standing, looking dazed with relief and seeming not to notice the intimacy of our stance. After all, I reassured myself, it betrayed no more than the concern of a doctor for his friend and patient.
What more is there to write of that awful night? Alone in Miss Stoner's bedroom, we sat in the dark, in utter silence, our ears strained for the least sound. I had only the dimmest idea of what form the crime we were to witness would take but the sense of foreboding that I had felt that morning had only increased, and my skin prickled with nerves as I sat, exposed and desperately vulnerable, in that dreadful coffin of a room. I was only feet from Holmes and yet I felt as if I were alone. I cast my mind back to the dark wait we had endured in the bank vault, an experience that, thought similar in its particulars, had never come close to matching the grim and sinister situation in which we now found ourselves.
“I find that I have become rather addicted to surprising you,” he said. “Though I cannot say it's something I have ever taken particular pains to do for anyone else.”
The story of the Red-Headed League was the strangest yet to cross my path and I could see that Holmes was filled with glee at a mystery that promised to put his unique skills to the test. When Mr Wilson read to us the advertisement that had led him to a job with an esoteric organisation that only hired men whose locks were of a particular hue, Holmes was almost wriggling in his chair with excitement. By the time the man had finished his account of days spent transcribing entries from the encyclopaedia for a ludicrously high wage, only to be summarily dismissed from his position eight weeks later, he was laughing to himself with delight. Watching him, I felt a measure of relief wash over me. Whatever his reasons for resorting to morphine – and I felt sure it could not be ennui alone that had driven him to inject so much of the drug that he had almost ended his life – his obvious happiness in this moment was enough to reassure me that he would not be in need of any other stimulant but the mystery until the case was solved.
He had retained such remarkable composure that I might have doubted that he had enjoyed our encounter, were it not for the proof I could see beneath the untucked tails of his shirt, still held together by a single button. But when I sat up and reached for him, he pulled away.
“Do not apologise,” he said. “It was no hardship. The fever has broken but you must drink plenty of water. Your temperature was dangerously high.”
My favourite hours at Baker Street in those early weeks were the evenings on which Holmes would take up his violin and begin to play, whiling away the hours between supper and bed with a virtuoso concert for one. In our short acquaintance, I had begun to think of Holmes as a man of rare intelligence but few emotions. Despite our growing friendship, he could be cold at times and rarely spoke either of himself or other people, instead tending to dwell on facts and formulas and history – the bedrocks of logic rather than passion. Yet when he took up his violin, he was transformed. I had not expected such a talent for music from a man of so scientific a bent, but when Holmes began to play he seemed to leave the man of reason behind him and become a creature of pure feeling. Often, when deep in thought, he would lay his violin across his knee and scrape at the strings with his bow, drawing out sustained chords that, while not unpleasant to the ear, were certainly not melodic. In the evenings, however, when he played for the pure pleasure of it, he would raise his fiddle to his chin, close his eyes and let his fingers dance over the strings.
It was the following evening, after breaking the news to Miss Morstan that she had not inherited a treasure – and from making plain, in the kindest and subtlest way I knew how that I was not a man in whom she should invest any romantic hopes – that I came home to find Holmes on the sofa with an empty syringe beside him and a drop of blood in the crook of his arm.
I did not know if it was the war or Holmes himself that had changed me, but, to my shame, I found that I was aroused by his capacity for violence. Though he used it sparingly and always as last resort, Holmes never flinched in the face of the most desperate and depraved men, finding ruthless and uniformly effective ways to render them harmless. I had always been drawn to women in whom I sensed gentleness, attracted by their generosity, their empathy and their instinct to care for those around them. The men with whom I had had affairs, too, had tended to be open and vulnerable and fundamentally kind. Several of them - like Henry - were fellow medical men, who had followed a calling to heal rather than to harm. Yet my attraction to Holmes was only stoked by his willingness to take another man apart with his fists in the pursuit of justice. I would have paid a small fortune – had I had one – to watch him boxing or fencing, two pastimes I knew he excelled at but had never had the opportunity to witness.
Darkness had fallen by the time I had tracked down Whitney at his home, and, with the reluctant blessing of his wife, to whom he had finally revealed all, convinced him to aid us in putting an end to his torment. Together, we returned to the hideous den from which I had plucked him not 24 hours earlier. Whitney entered, nervous but determined, a very different man from the wreck I had encountered the night before, and I wondered, not for the first time, at the transformative powers of hope on the human psyche.
I awoke gently, coming back to life slowly and sweetly, as I had used to do before the war. The sun was already high in the sky and I was utterly disoriented. For a moment or two I lay still, struggling to make sense of why the window was not in the right place and wondering how I had managed to pass a whole night without a nightmare. Then I registered the lean, distinctly masculine arm wrapped loosely around my abdomen. In the morning light, a smattering of fine black hair stood out starkly against the pale skin. In a moment, the events of the night came back to me and I froze, heat pooling in my stomach as I registered that I was lying naked beside my friend, who, if memory served, must be equally unclothed. No wonder I had not dreamed. We could have been asleep for no more than an hour or two, I realised, recalling that the first blush of dawn had already begun to appear behind the curtains when at last I had fallen into an exhausted sleep.
“I’ll have you both arrested for this,” he said, menace in every word. “If you think that the word of an amateur sleuth will be believed over that of an inspector with more than a dozen years on the force, you are a damn sight more foolish than I’ve been led to believe.”
I stared at him in amazement. He had never spoken of his family before. I had assumed that, like me, he was alone in the world.
“When you sent me away with Percy I feared that you believed there was something between us,” I admitted.
She sank gracefully onto the sofa, without waiting for an invitation, folding her delicate hands in her lap.
He turned to me and shot me a look that I could not interpret. “If this friend of yours was really here, as you say, then there is only one place he could have gone.”
John sighs but his mouth curves upwards at the corners. Sherlock knows that smile. It’s the reluctant version of the soft smile, the one John uses when he calls Sherlock an idiot.
“Woe betide my attacker, if I had been. It is quite the experience, being rescued by an avenging war hero. Particularly one who looks like Dr John Watson. Would that we lived in medieval times. I should have loved to see you with chainmail across that broad chest and a sword in your hand, a helmet framing your jaw. Have I ever told you what this angle just here does to me?” he mused, reaching out to trail a finger from below my right ear to my chin, just above the spot where I knew he could see my pulse thrumming fast in my throat.
“If he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him,” I found myself saying eagerly, as soon as Stamford mentioned his acquaintance. “I should prefer having a partner to being alone.”
It takes Sherlock three strides to reach him, one hand coming up to tilt John’s face towards his even as his mouth descends. The contact lasts two seconds, their teeth clashing, before John shoves him off.
“It was too bad to spring it on you like this, but Watson here will tell you that I never can resists a touch of the dramatic,” he said, as Phelps seized his hand and kissed it fervently, nothing but gratitude in his touch.
“Incredible but unwelcome,” he said. “Do not try to convince me that I have not discomforted you with my foolish wish to demonstrate my talents, my dear fellow.”
He closed his eyes for a long moment and I realised that he too was teetering on the edge of release.
“So,” I prompted, “it does not appall you to learn that I would rather spend the rest of my days with you than with anyone else I can think of, female or male, client or otherwise?”
I do not wish to relive the ghastly sight of Dr Roylott’s corpse, with the snake still coiled about his forehead like a gruesome crown. Still less do I like to recall the moment the deadly serpent began sinuously to uncoil, its movements sending an instinctive chill of horror down my spine. When Holmes reached for the dog-whip on the dead man’s lap, I cried out and grabbed for his arm, certain that the loathsome creature would strike him as soon as he drew close. But he had already grasped the whip with one long arm and swiftly, expertly, he hooked it around the snake’s head and flung the creature into the safe. As soon as he had done so, I darted forward to slam the door upon it with a clang. It was only once I turned back to him that I saw that he was shaking.
By the time the evening of the second day came, I was unable to focus on anything for more than a minute or two, worries about what could have become of my friend intruding into my every thought. I was drinking steadily to try to stem the flow of images – Holmes dead in the river Thames, his throat slit by one of the many criminals he had crossed over the years, Holmes kidnapped by a desperate client who would not let him free until his problem was solved, Holmes in bed with a tall, muscular young policeman – that were assaulting my mind. The last, I knew, was unfounded and unworthy, but we had never spoken of fidelity or acknowledged the unorthodox nature of our relationship aloud, and the lingering jealousy I had felt towards the lady and her impressive mental prowess had perhaps left me sensitive in certain regards.
“You do not lack kindness, my dear fellow,” I said, pulling his lean body still closer to mine and tilting my head so that he could press a kiss into the curve of my neck. “I don’t need to match your skills in deductive reasoning to have noticed that you care about your clients – it is obvious to me, no matter how much you try to hide it.”
People have said it before. Of course they have. People are idiots. So full of sentiment and so determined to smear their own illogical emotions all over other people, as though feelings are viral particles and if they only exude enough they’re bound to be catching. Three – no, four – people have told Sherlock they loved him, mostly during sex, when people seem almost pathologically incapable of shutting up and focusing on the enjoyable physical sensations that are the entire point of the exercise. One man Sherlock had picked up in a gay club near Soho and hooked up with between cases for close to three months – longer than normal, that had been his mistake – had even interrupted a rather nice blow job to say it. He’d got quite upset when Sherlock had rolled his eyes and urged him to focus. So why didn’t Sherlock want to roll his eyes when John said it? Is it because they’re colleagues? Flatmates? Friends? No. Stupid. Why would that change anything? It doesn’t make sense.
The next morning, I woke up easier in my mind than I had been for weeks, after a night of sleep disturbed only twice by nightmares. It had been some time since I had had an appointment to meet with someone and I refrained from the morning dram that had become an unhappy habit, less Holmes should smell it on me when we met. I did not wish my vices to become known to him if I could avoid it and the hours of uninterrupted sleep had left me feeling fortified, stronger than I had felt for a long time.
It was only after he left that I realised my whole body was shaking. Though I took deep, steady breaths, it took a long time for it to stop. I lay waiting for Holmes to return, already bitterly regretting the awful words I had flung at him, even as his own hateful insinuations echoed in my head. I did not believe that it would be possible to fall asleep. As the minutes passed, however, the events of the day began to take their toll and my eyes grew heavy even as I jolted myself repeatedly back into wakefulness, guarding against Holmes’ return and the inevitable nightmares.
I waited out of sight, in the dank shadows near the entrance, for what felt like hours. The cold seemed to cut deeper with every moment and several times I began to think that if I did not move around I should freeze to death where I stood, but eventually I heard the jingle of a horse’s bridle and the quiet sound of wheels and then Wainwright came around the corner on foot, silhouetted against the single lamp that lit the entrance of the accused den. He disappeared inside, and I waited a few minutes and then followed him, as unobtrusively as possible. Ordering a pipe from the attendant, I sat in a shadowed corner, from where I had a clear view of Whitney, slumped over his own glowing bowl of sweet-smelling poison. I hoped that the lure of the drug had not overcome my instructions to partake only of the smallest amount, smoking just so much as was necessary to avoid arousing suspicion.
The following day, I awoke from a nightmare that faded from my memory on awakening, leaving me sweating and shaken. I came downstairs to find Holmes sitting on the sofa where I had left him the night before. Although I had heard him playing his violin late into the night and suspected that he had not slept, he looked as immaculate as ever, his eyes lit with their strange pale glow as he turned to me.
“I thought about running my hand up your thigh during that concert we went to after the client in Brighton lent us his box for the night,” he murmured, increasing his pace too little. “I wondered what you would do if, in the middle of the second half, you felt me slide my palm up the inside of your thigh. Would you have objected? Shifted in your seat? Made a sound? Or would you have sat silently, obedient to my whims, growing hard beneath my touch as I stroked over your trouser front in the dark? What if I had teased you, in the middle of the crowd, until you couldn't hear the music anymore because the only thing you were aware of was my touch? Would you have held out or would you have succumbed right there, releasing in your trousers, your gasps covered by the sound of the orchestra?”
At a loss for words, I took several deep breaths, attempting to clear my mind as I had learned to do during my time on the frontlines when panic threatened to overwhelm me. I was still a doctor, I reminded myself. Resisting the urge to keep shaking him, I placed two fingers on his cool throat. His pulse was slow but steady. The colour was already coming back into his face and his lips were no longer blue. He was only half dressed, and his shirt, open at the neck, revealed a slice of smooth, pallid skin. He looked like a waxwork rendering of himself, but he no longer resembled a corpse.
“You knew exactly what was going to happen and you still let yourself get bitten. So what if the snake wasn’t poisonous?”
“I estimated the distance and our combined weights and calculated that the impact would be enough to cause significant bruising – maybe a couple of broken ribs – but the risk of fatality was minimal. Particularly given I made sure he landed first.”
“Not at all,” I said. Though Holmes had never appeared to be in any measure repelled by my disfigured clavicle and blemished skin, I was often frustrated by my ill health and wished that I might better conceal it from him. Sometimes, though I knew it to be foolish and self-indulgent, I fell into maudlin reflections on what Holmes might have thought of me before the war, when I was hale and hearty and reasonably muscular and altogether a worthier partner for a man like him.
Holmes ate swiftly as Phelps gradually recovered from his shock, then settled in his chair and drew a cigarette from his case. His story was a familiar one, in many ways. Once again, the case had necessitated a weary night-time vigil, crouched in a rhododendron bush outside Phelps’ bedroom window. But unlike the long interlude in the bank vault, or the nightmarish wait in Stoke Moran not two weeks earlier, he had chosen to wait alone. I busied myself with the decanter, avoiding his eyes, as he recounted how he had watched as Harrison broke into the room and his struggle with the man, whom he had tackled, barehanded, in the darkness, pitting nothing but his fists against a knife. As he described how he had been dealt a cut over the knuckles, I realised that I was gripping the crystal stopper so hard that my own knuckles had turned white. Turning aside abruptly, I dropped down onto the sofa beside Phelps, who appeared to be astounded by Holmes’ tale. I could see that he had never suspected that such a streak of viciousness lay within the breast of his friend.
“Nonetheless, I fear that my talents at dissembling do not always extend to how I feel about you. I am a stupider man than you give me credit for. It took me all night to figure out what the Shlessingers planned to do with you. It was no prevarication when I told you that emotion does not aid in the art of criminal detection. Knowing that you were in danger made it almost impossible for me to think. You can have no idea how it felt to know that the only way I could save you was to use my brain and yet find myself utterly incapable of preventing myself from dwelling on what would happen if I did not save you, to the exclusion of all else. As it was, I was almost too late. When I saw you in that coffin, I was certain that I had failed you.”
“I believe that our minds work in similar ways,” I heard him say again in that admiring tone. Throwing off the covers, I rose and poured myself a sizeable drink. Never since the night that Holmes and I had first lain together had I been so acutely, miserably aware of my shortcomings – the ugliness of my scarred body, the weakness of my shattered psyche, my shameful habit of drinking to calm my unsteady nerves and, above all, my deplorably ordinary brain, as dull and prosaic as a hammer beside the sharpened knife of Holmes' keen intellect. Ingenuity and intelligence were, I knew, qualities that he prized above all else. Unlike Miss Adler, I possessed neither of them in great measure.
“Shall I leave you, Percy?” the young woman asked, but he clutched at her hand to keep her beside him and I hoped that perhaps matters were not as I suspected they must be. There was warmth in his gaze as he looked at her and, whatever the nature of their tie, I could see that he held her in high regard.
He laughed softly. The vivid scar with which he had deformed his face gave him a strange lopsided look and yet that silent laugh was all Holmes. I felt a sudden overwhelming urge to press a kiss to his twisted lips.
“I don't know how they managed to obtain a medical certificate – if she died of an overdose of chloroform then perhaps they were able to make it appear like heart trouble.”
“For leaving you. I never intended to be gone so long. Whitney had never stayed so long in the den before and I could not leave him alone. I attempted to send you a message via the attendant, but it seems it never arrived.”
“I see that you have been very methodical,” I said, suppressing the foolish smile that fought to overtake my countenance at the thought that he had planned this whole outing to surprise me. “What sort of experiments do you intend to perform?”
Appalled at the implication that my health might be too delicate to allow me to carry out such a simple excursion, hurt at his continuing reluctance to share with me the details of the case that was keeping him too busy to accompany me and unable to tell him that the thought of a trip abroad without him by my side held less appeal than remaining at Baker Street in his presence, no matter how distracted he might be, I reluctantly acquiesced. Holmes had several times asked me to help out with his work in some small capacity – travelling ahead of him to a country town to scout out the figures who might prove relevant to a case, for example, or serving as a decoy should he need to perform some action or other unobserved – but never had he suggested anything that would require me to spend several days away from him. The disappearance of Lady Carfax did not sound all that urgent, nor did it promise to deliver the kinds of eccentric details and seemingly unsolvable mysteries that Holmes found interesting. I began to wonder if there was some other reason that he should wish me from home. I could think of no way of altering my plans once I had agreed, however, and in any case, he seemed so pleased by my willingness to go that I found myself reluctant to disappoint him.
“Describe the room for me. Exactly. Be precise. You said there was some kind of vent above the bed?”
Only when I did so did he once again lower his head, his grey gaze fixed on me all the time, to finish what he had started. His domineering attitude only increased my arousal, God forgive me, and I marvelled at his ability to place me totally at his mercy even as he was the one servicing my needs. He was still holding my eyes with his own when I could stand it no longer and I released with a cry, treacherous pleasure coursing through my body. Holmes' rhythm did not falter as he reached forward with one long arm and placed his hand firmly over my mouth, leaving me to convulse in silence until I slumped back onto the rug.
Holmes looked up at me over the top of his newspaper. He was lounging in an attitude of total repose, his legs sprawled across the length of the sofa and crossed over at the ankle as he read. His face was blandly curious, as though he had no idea to what I was referring, but I had seen his considerable skill at acting and knew that I could not trust his expression to reflect whatever he was truly thinking.
When Holmes returned, not long after me, he was unusually flushed and as gleeful as I had ever seen him.
“Mundanity? You did this because you were bored?” I said. Then, reflexively. “And I do not ‘follow at your heels.’”
“Thank you, Dr Watson,” she said. “I have heard of you from Miss Morstan, who told me of the help that you and Mr Holmes were able to provide in the case of her missing father. I see now that you are just as kind as she said.”
“I knew what he used. I didn’t know how it worked. I ran lots of tests at Bart’s before I lit it, John. But I needed to know what it felt like so that I could understand its effects.”
“I found her just entering its vestibule,” he explained. “It was almost noon and just as I was wondering on what pretext to follow her, a tall, dark man came rushing out and dragged me inside, where I became the sole witness to the tying up of Irene Adler and a Mr Godfrey Norton.”
“We thought we'd lost you, Dr Watson,” said Lestrade, who was kneading my shoulder firmly, as though unaware of what his hands were doing. He glanced anxiously at Holmes, who was stony faced and unreadable.
Somehow, our desire continued to burn as hot and as savage as that first night. Ever aware of himself, even when he was rock hard and watching me moan as he thrust his musician’s fingers slowly into my mouth or mapped every inch of my scar tissue with his tongue, Holmes remained almost unnervingly in control of himself, orchestrating my pleasure as he ruthlessly deferred his own. His emotions, too, he kept firmly in check. Even when he was inside me, or lying spent in my arms, his skin glistening with sweat and his pulse thrumming as frantically as the wings of a moth against the glass of a lantern, I was unable to guess what he might be thinking or feeling.
Sherlock drops his eyes again but he moves forward a little into the press of John’s hand, which has migrated to the side of his neck, warm and steady.
There’s something wrong with his voice. It’s oddly flat. He should be fighting a bout of inappropriate giggling by now. He loves it when Sherlock goads Anderson into doing something stupid.
My old school friend cast a curious glance at me and to my consternation I felt the colour rising to my cheeks at the question in his eyes. I attempted to look reassuring as I waited for Holmes to share his conclusions but he was still staring down at the drooping flower as he began to speak of religion. Outlined against the light from the window, his head bent and his eyes downcast, he looked oddly vulnerable. There was a hint of melancholy in his tone as he finished his rambling speech on beauty and what it promised, leaving a startled silence in its wake. I sensed Phelps’ questioning eyes on me as I stared at Holmes, who was still looking down at the flower as though it held the answer to the mystery that our client had laid before us.
I finally fell into an exhausted sleep in the early hours, only to awaken just after dawn from a horrific nightmare in which I was back at Maiwand and was caught in delicate circumstances with a soldier from my brigade. We had been court marshalled and were about to be executed when I awoke, sweating and in pain, my shoulder throbbing in a way it had not in many weeks.
I half feared that Holmes would ignore my request to take the next train down to Woking, for it was already mid-afternoon by the time I was able to send a telegram. To my relief, he sent a reply for us to expect him on the 5 o’clock train. It was a fine day and I was able to walk to the station to meet him. I was unaccountably happy to see him, so out of place in his frock coat and hat, far from the bustle and noise of London, yet so achingly familiar to me in every respect, from the sweep of his dark hair, to the way he stood on the platform, as tall and upright as a soldier, yet perfectly at his ease. As we walked slowly towards the house, I recounted Phelps’ story. Holmes listened, his brows drawn together in a frown, swinging his cane beside him so that it whipped through the long grass that lined the road like a scythe, creating a rhythmic swishing sound that accompanied the staccato beat of our footsteps.
It was a weary day. Phelps, sensing my distraction, tried to engage me in conversation, but his own troubles and his long illness had left him weak and out of sorts. In vain, I in turn endeavoured to interest him in tales of Afghanistan, seeking to keep his thoughts far from the missing treaty and the spectre of his former lover. His mind circled on the same well-worn tracks as he fretted over the investigation, torn between fear and hope that perhaps Holmes might yet prove the answer to his misfortunes. Once or twice, he valiantly attempted to distract me with talk of politics and social questions, while my mind tended to my own fears and my own distant hope. I do not believe that either of us slept much that night, me in my own familiar bed and Phelps in Holmes’, where I had only once dared to let myself sleep.
“Let us term it simply a duet,” I whispered. I turned my head as he shifted and leaned forward in his chair and then his warm lips were on mine. When he took me to bed, for the first time in weeks, it was slow and exploratory, an exquisite adagio that built inexorably to an allegro before reaching its climax. When it was over, I lay in his arms, my face pressed into his warm skin, and simply breathed. As he ran gentle fingers down my spine, half-asleep in the warm afternoon light, I inhaled the scent of his body into my lungs like fragrant cigarette smoke, wishing I could hold onto it forever.
“What a work of fantasy! I have never read such rubbish in my life,” I cried, throwing the magazine down beside the butter. Roused from his gloom, Holmes glanced at the page, still open to the article, and then at my face.
He drew back at once when I waved the telegram at him and turned away towards the mantelpiece, already reaching for his pipe.
When I bid him goodnight that evening before retiring, the first time in several days that I had done so, he answered in a soft voice and I found myself smiling as I climbed the stairs to my bedroom. The following morning, however, our growing accord was shattered by a telegram. Phelps wired to ask me to proceed as swiftly as I was able to Woking, leaving Holmes in London. He gave no reason for his strange request and I was at a loss as to what to tell Holmes, who had breakfasted with more fervour than usual and was making ready to depart for the station.
He raised one perfect eyebrow at me, already on his feet and turning away towards his bedroom door. Despite myself, I followed at his heels.
“Do not be ridiculous. I merely wished to be of help to you – and you ensured that I was not in a position to do so. Why must you persist in shutting me out of your plans?”
I watched as she brought Holmes tea and tenderly wiped the blood from his forehead with a soft cloth. I tensed when I saw her slender, feminine hand cup his angular jaw and skim the line of his high cheekbone as she ministered to him. Holmes' eyes were fixed firmly on her face. When she finished wiping away the blood and set the cloth aside, she allowed her hand to linger on at his temple as she stared back at him. Their faces were inches apart. For several long seconds, neither of them moved. The intimacy of their locked gazes took my breath away. Suddenly, Holmes made a gesture as though he were choking, raising one long arm in what I knew was a signal to me. I threw the rocket into the room, shouting “Fire!” and in the thick cloud of smoke I lost sight of both Holmes and the woman he had set himself to outsmart.
The door was stronger than it looked, and I had to throw my body against it three times before it finally gave and I tumbled into the room. It was empty. No furniture stood on the ancient boards, no curtains shielded the windows. The only objects in the room were a heap of wooden crates and a pile of rags in the corner. I ignored the blond stranger, who was firing questions at me, and set to searching the room. I had examined the unmarked crates and was about to kick out at the heap of filthy, torn fabric to see what lay beneath when I realised that there was a person half-hidden in the folds of cloth. It was an old, disfigured man, his face deeply lined and misshapen by a hideous scar that twisted his lip upwards at a dreadful angle. His hair was grey, his mouth drooping and his eyes rheumy and bloodshot – and a very familiar shade of grey. The old man must have seen my eyes widen and a name form on my lips, because he shook his head once, very slightly, Holmes’ eyes staring up at me from his wrinkled face.
“Jealousy is a strange thing. Human beings, I believe, are the only creatures that often act contrary to their own interests. Harrison could not have what he wanted and so he chose to destroy not only his sister and his lover but himself into the bargain. It was a timely reminder to reign in my own suspicions regarding Phelps’ designs on a certain doctor, retired soldier and former lover.”
“These are surely marks from where the key has slipped when you wind it each night. Such scratches are the sign of an unsteady hand. I meant no offense by remarking on it, but it is a sign I have seen before, in more instances than one, and it is always indicative of the same thing.”
It’s embarrassing and for a moment Sherlock is furious that John has made him admit it. Sherlock doesn’t trip. He’s trained in dance and fencing and mixed martial arts. He doesn’t stumble over carpets.
“You criticised the article, as you had every right to do, and I am its author,” Holmes said. “I have a talent for observation and deduction and I felt it time to put into words some of the theories on which my work depends.”
“It is nothing that you lack that causes me to desire your immediate return to London,” said Holmes, a trifle impatiently. “It is a matter of concentration and efficiency. I shall think more clearly and act more swiftly if I work alone.”
It was several hours later that Holmes, as clean and well-fed as I had ever seen him, slid onto the sofa, where I sat staring pensively at the fire. His hair was combed straight back over his regal forehead and he was wrapped in his familiar soft blue dressing gown.
So infrequently did Holmes say those words that I closed my eyes and tried to imprint every tiny detail of the moment upon my mind, from the blades of grass pressing patterns into my skin, to feel of the sun on my face, the quiet rhythm of his breath beside me and the feel of his scarred hand in mine. Since admitting the depths of his feelings for me, Holmes had never tried to deny or conceal them, but he was still the same man. At his core, I understood – as no others did, save perhaps for his brother – that he was capable of great empathy, but he was not a demonstrative man and rarely felt the need to articulate the sentiment that I often saw shining out at me from his eyes.
“If you need me, do not hesitate to call me,” I heard him say to my back as I finally reached the door of my room and shut myself away from him. As I readied myself for bed, I could hear the faint strains of his violin from the sitting room and the thought that he might be playing for me brought a smile to my face, despite my pain and worry.
All night, as my body lay in Baker Street, my mind roamed the battlefield of Maiwand, sometimes alone, sometimes with Holmes at my side. Once, he kissed me so sweetly and passionately that when he stopped I begged him to kiss me again, but he turned away in disgust, leaving me calling after him. Another time he appeared in Afghan garb. Just as I recognised the pale grey eyes in the sun-browned face, he shot me and I felt the bullet burning through my shoulder as he laughed.
“But what of our client?” I cried, half afraid that we should be forced to go after her and prolong the whole hideous affair.
It took me a few moments to process these cryptic words and then, I am sorry to recall, I gaped at him in shock.
“I think it would be best if you found somewhere else to live,” he said. “Now that I have so many regular clients I am no longer in need of a companion with whom to split the rent. I will give you a week or two to make alternative arrangements.”
He broke off suddenly, his voice strangled and strange. Glancing over in puzzlement, I saw that he had turned away from me and that we were already on Baker Street, almost at our door. We drew up and Holmes handed me down from the cab as distantly as a hotel doorman, watching to check that I could walk unaided before he preceded me up the stairs.
“Fine,” he says, in his long-suffering voice. “I promise you the next time I’m chasing down a suspect I won’t get myself stabbed or get hit by a car or jump of a roof. At least without informing you first.”
A familiar feeling of excitement mixed with dismay rolled through me as I realised that once again Holmes had seen far more in the matter than he had chosen to reveal to me. I could not understand why he had not spoken to me of Phelps’ telegram, nor why he had chosen to respond by wire, rather than confiding in me. Little wishing Phelps to read my misgivings in my face, lest he determine the cause, I affected nonchalance as I drew back and turned to ring the bell.
“I hope that Mrs Hudson did not hear that,” I said, already overcome with remorse at the risk I had brought upon him.
“Are you sure it does not make them simpler?” he asked, and watched the man’s face fall and a frown of irritation mar his brow. “I should be inclined to say that the discovery of the ring very nearly seals the solution.”
At Baden, I learned that Lady Carfax had become entangled with a couple of religious zealots, a Dr Shlessinger and his wife, and began to feel that perhaps I was making progress. I learned, with relief, that the entire party had departed for London some three weeks earlier, at last giving me reason to return to Baker Street and continue the investigation from there. When, on my arrival in Montpellier for what I hoped would be the final portion of my Continental investigation, I received a telegram from Holmes requesting a description of Dr Shlessinger’s left ear, I was equal parts exasperated and amused. The following morning, I set out to interview Lady Carfax’s former maid in good spirits, and retired that night anticipating a return to Baker Street the next day. I fell asleep fantasising about the many ways in which I might wordlessly communicate to Holmes how much I had missed him.
“I do see him, quite often, as it happens,” he said. “I have simply avoided taking you with me. It is not that I fear the two of you will not get along. In fact, I believe Mycroft will like you very much. But he is a man who sees everything and who – when it comes to his dealings with me – conceals nothing. Were he to meet you, I knew that he would deduce immediately how I felt about you – and how you in turn, felt about me. I did not wish to endure his pity.”
“Holmes,” I ventured quietly, when several minutes had passed and I could not erase the image of his horrified face from my mind.
Indeed, so powerful did my curiosity become that I had to take great pains not to let him notice my growing fascination with his habits. I took to watching him subtly when I was seemingly engaged in reading, often glancing at him briefly over the newspaper as I sat in the armchair that lay across from his by the fireside. My shortcomings seemed to have escaped his notice, to my relief, and I found that I was sleeping better and drinking less than when I had lived at the hotel. Yet, to my shame, I could not rid myself of the habit of a few drams before bed, nor of the dreadful haunting nightmares. My injury, although mended, had left me stiff and lopsided, and I found that I was often in pain as the long winter nights started to draw in and the cold left me aching and slow. After catching a bad cold one afternoon while walking in the park to give Holmes time alone with one of his clients, I began to fear that my fever might return. The thought of lying raving and insensible at Baker Street, as I had at the hospital in Peshawar, unaware of the passage of time or the doctors and nurses who tended to me, filled me with horror. Though I knew that to Holmes I was nothing more than a companion with whom to share a nice suite of rooms, I could not have borne for him to see me in such a weakened and pitiable state. Happily, the scare passed, but I took pains not to venture out so much into the cold, spending more and more of my time in our lodgings by the fire.
“It did not,” I said. And then, venturing more than I was certain I should, “I thought of you for two days straight. I was worried you had been killed.”
“My dear doctor, look here,” he said, taking it gently from my hand and pointing to the keyhole. Taking it back, I brought it close to my face and peered at it, only to perceive that there were indeed hundreds of tiny marks scratched into the metal, so small as to have gone unremarked. That Holmes had seen them at such distance and in the low light of the laboratory was astounding. I found myself thinking that he must have the sharpest eyes in England, as well as the most mercurial.
“Come inside and tell me what has happened,” I said. “I have none of Holmes’ talents as a detective but I am familiar with his methods and perhaps I may be of some small service to you.”
I took a small puff of my own pipe, attempting to hold the fragrant, toxic smoke in my mouth and avoid drawing it into my lungs. The room was so full of fumes that I knew I could not prevent myself from suffering some effects of the opium, which was seeping into my system every time I drew breath. Such was my state of nervous tension that the time seemed to pass even more slowly than it had when I was out in the cold. Eventually, I saw a man slide into the berth beside Whitney and knew from the set of his shoulders and the shape of his head that it was Wainwright. The inspector handed Whitney a new pipe and two men talked together for a few minutes, as I, making certain that I was unobserved, set aside my own apparatus in a fever of anticipation. Then they got to their feet and made for the stairs at the rear of the long, low room. I stood up fast, my head spinning and my limbs as floppy as they sometimes were after a long night of drinking. Forcing myself to action, I moved as swiftly and silently as I could in their wake.
