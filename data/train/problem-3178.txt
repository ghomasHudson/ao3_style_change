Charlie suddenly dug into the side pocket of her dark jeans, removing the pointed bulge and tossing it to Kevin: her car keys. Even through my panic, I couldn’t help but raise an eyebrow at the action and wondered just what kind of request she had in store for the poor, always-able soul. Kevin was sadly and terribly difficult not to take advantage of.
It was raining outside again, though I didn’t really see how it was possible. It was a chilly thirty-one degrees outdoors and my breath had been visible and foggy in front of me as I raced down the street and into the only slightly warmer walls of my apartment building, and I blew into my hands as I climbed the creaking steps until I reached the third floor, trying my hardest to be adamant in keeping up with my physical health since it felt as though the majority of my time was being spent at the pub, and marveled at the dull noise the freezing raindrops made as they hit the windows’ thin glass. The end of November was a time most often filled with heavy snowflakes that blanketed cars in an impenetrable shield of white, a time I usually dreaded, but I agreed that icy winds and frozen water droplets were better than a soaked overcoat.
“Don’t act like you’re actually pissed about it, man,” I sneered, a little meanly, but Cas got the point and rolled his sparkling eyes and I fought hard not to get lost in them, in their embodiment of all things warm and safe and gentle. Besides, there was a dull beep ringing from the opposite corner of the bed, my assigned corner, and it was officially eight o’clock. Cas was the first to remark about the time, as usual.
Soon I found my elbows leaning up against the bar’s surface with Dean’s robust hands in between them, clasped loosely together, with his own forehead no more than six or seven inches apart from my own, and story upon story came flowing from his lips like the floodgates in his head had been torn away, blown into nonexistence, and I took every word in like it was the last I would ever hear. There were times where I struggled to remember each one, because getting lost in the whisper of a usually gruff voice was very easy to do, but if asked I could probably recite everything that was told to me in order.
“Well if you haven’t noticed, it’s been a little busy out here and I have a lot of orders running through my head at the moment,” I retorted, a little absently, as I retrieved the proper beer for sir paranormal, doing my best to ignore the sly incline of Charlie’s lips, and I wasn’t keen on hearing her reply in the least.
The sound of his glass hitting the bar with force caused me to jump and nearly trip over my own feet as I turned around to face him. It seemed as though the sharp noise was his own, creative way of getting my attention, and while it was ultimately rude and startling, I appreciated it greatly because it meant that I was wanted.
I really do apologize for the later update. My day was full of AP homework, procrastination, and my typical forgetfulness. I hope the minor twist at the end made it worth your while, though! Also, as always, thank you all for the kind words and the support. Hopefully I haven't disappointed anyone yet.
The drawbacks of Dean and I’s most intricate exchange yet were minimal, but still present, like a small insect that continued to buzz around your ear but never flew in close enough for you to swat it away permanently. Kevin had picked up on my new interest, being the observer he was, and had tried several times to inquire me further about the matter, but I never said very much for there wasn’t too much I could think of in reply. I explained to him my challenge of figuring out how Dean Winchester worked and why I was so adamant in doing so: he’d eluded me for three nights in a row now, and there was simply no way I could let that slide. But, judging by the way he exchanged a fleeting but very amused look with Charlie, he had taken it in the wrong way, the most incorrect way, and there was little that I could do to fight the pungent red from spreading across my otherwise pale cheeks.
“Sorry to interrupt...but this poor guy’s been waiting here for a good ten minutes in need of a drink, and the bartender currently on duty seems to be a bit distracted.”
“Definitely. Nothing like gettin’ under the hood of an old clunker and making it roar back to life again. It never gets old.”
But, in terms of Dean Winchester, there was little optimism to be found in the world. It was a rare occurrence to hear laugh or see him grin ear to ear, almost impossible without the aid of alcohol, and I guess that’s where that illogical hope was blooming out of. I couldn’t ignore it, of course. It was swelling up in the pit of my stomach, making my limbs tremble and twitch with excitement until I had to steady myself as I poured the pretend-deacon another glass of whatever his poison of choice was, I don’t remember, and each creak in the floorboards, mumble of a hello, or any such sign of an entrance enveloped every ounce of my attention until I realized Dean was nowhere to be seen. I would then proceed to sigh, ignore my coworker’s giggles, and carry on glumly.
Charlie rolled her eyes, twinkling blue lighting up with the gleam of mischief and mocking that was sure to come quickly after. “I recognize at least three people from last week that are here right now, but you don’t see me going all googly-eyed for them. You’re into him.”
It was Sunday now, four-twenty-seven PM, and the street had finally cleared itself of bustling vehicles and drivers shouting profanities from the luxury of their interior, leather-bound seats. I walked to the opposite side, being sure to walk within the white walls of the crosswalk, and against the cold breeze of foreboding whiteness and ice. The pub was located at the corner of Ash street, the street to which I was walking towards, and I could see through the frosty windows that the lights were already gleaming through the front room and another co-worker of mine was scrubbing furiously at each table in the hasty and desperate manner that he seemed to do everything in.
I watched Dean’s reaction, gaging his willingness to answer, and felt my spirits raise as he opened his mouth to reply, eyes trained on my face, but panicked when they shifted focus. He was looking somewhere behind me, and a smirk of amusement was playing across his lips. I didn’t want to admit to myself what my theory was about what, or who, more rather, was the subject of his gaze.
“That guy’s a total psycho, a nutjob,” Charlie concluded as she placed the load of dishes on a cart being pushed stealthily into the kitchen and, ignoring the look of pure hatred the busboy gave her for increasing his workload, she leaned back against the wall next to the cascading shelves of liquor and crossed her arms around her chest.
As the time passed, I watched his shoulders slump inward more, his eyes focus less, and his fingers decrease in the severity of their grasp of the several glasses and bottles he went through. I'd kept track, of course, in hopes of not causing him harm or putting him in danger by being such an enabler, but I couldn't help but feel that sting of wonder coarse straight through me. What in the world could be driving him to drink himself into oblivion? What could've possibly occurred in his life that would need the burn of alcohol and stupid thought to relieve or fill it? What hole was there to patch up, and who had dug it?
Soon after his arrival, the chatter and the clinking resumed without further interruptions and the sudden air of tension blew away for a short while. I believe the old woman continued on her whiskey-fueled rant about dirty dishes, but I was a little too occupied with the man walking steadily towards the bar. His jacket, unzipped with a plain tee shirt underneath, the collar lowly cut to reveal a small portion of his tan chest area, covering his middle, flopped back and forth with each step he took, and each one of those steps carried purpose, much more purpose than the usual bar crawlers possessed. But, in all honesty, any purpose at all was more than what they had.
“-to make things as best as I could. You have no IDEA how much I wanted you two with me, how much I need you two, and now Sam’s off away at school and you-”
“Cars are something you’re passionate about, then?” I chimed in, wanting to confirm my theory once and for all, but mostly just wanted to hear him say what I knew aloud.
“Wasn’t sure if you’d ever come back, to be honest,” Dad replied with eyes wide and honest, just like he’d said. A drop of his beer sloshed from its container and I watched it dampen the carpet under our feet.
With a flick of my wrist, I flung Dean’s drink to him from across the bar, its underside screeching against the wood and dragging the moisture it had accumulated out in a cold, wet stream, and it landed just outside his fingertips, like the vacant version of the glass had done to me earlier that night. There must’ve been something different about my demeanor in doing so, however, because we’d finally met eyes and he was sending me a trying, inquisitive, yet overwhelmingly sly look, as if he was daring me to say whatever it was that was ghosting my lips, trying to pry my mouth open. Eventually my self control had worn too thin and the sound of my own voice, a sharp contrast to Dean’s, was echoing throughout the pub before I could convince myself otherwise and draw away.
“THIS!” Sam exclaimed. “THIS is why it all is so fucking hard. THIS is what is holding you back!” Suddenly I saw the bottle be flung from his grasp, cascade to the floor, and the rest of its contents spill onto the shag flooring in one large, damp spot. I watched it seep inward with too much attentiveness as the scene played out in front of me, and I felt Bobby’s laser-like gaze burn its own hole into the back of my head. What was he waiting for, me to step in?
Raphael was who people knew our family by, because they didn’t truly know him. He was evidently jealous of Michael and their relationship fizzled out the moment we left Michael to fly to the sunny shores. Raphael pushed himself after that, achieving nearly perfect grades and got involved in every club one could possibly think of, and I used to gawk over the perfection he’d achieved. In retrospect, I realized that he was not the only one involved in achieving it all, and my memory of him was clouded and stained by the way he’d demeaned each member of our family for being nothing but an obstacle to him, for getting in the way on his path to greatness, and I thought by the look in his dark eyes that he wanted to hurt me. Three days later, he left for Harvard and he got no kiss goodbye.
There was barely a millisecond of time where I was met with two wildlife green eyes staring back at my own with an intensity I had never encountered before. It made my skin crawl and my breath catch for a moment within my chest, but then it was gone. His vision turned away as quickly as it had shifted to my neck and rear end of my skull and I'd hardly had enough time to process it, but it had been there. It had graced the back of my head. It was as plain as the look of wonder my face had contorted into, combined with my embarrassment at dropping the keys.
The Sunday night crowd was one that I enjoyed, to say the least. While they were far more predictable than the Thursday nighters, it was an odd collage of personalities and characters that, unless one worked in a position similar to mine, many would not expect to see at such a place like a bar. Congregations of holy figures of all sorts flooded the doors, escaping after the last of the “Lord’s day” gatherings had finished. They were never rowdy, never rude, never too loud but never too awkwardly quiet and respectful.
“Yeah, she’s obviously messed up about it. She’s reevaluating her relationship, figurin’ out what went wrong. She’ll find someone else though, we all do. Someone that loves her for real, and so will her husband.”
“What?” I mumbled, rubbing sleep from my eyes and distorting the sight of Cas’s cheeks rising high into his face, intruding on the bags under his eyes, as he plain old laughed at me, and I was at a complete loss for what he found so amusing after being so grumpy seconds before. He would have to enlighten me, and he did so by holding up a finger-I wasn’t keen on waiting for his explanation; why the hell was he laughing?- and bending over the mattress to retrieve something. I would be lying if I said that I didn’t watch, and that there weren’t rather distinct red marks lining the skin around his spine and shoulders, remnants of the events that had transpired in the hours before, and I realized that he did have every right to be tired.
I placed my hands on the edge of the bar closest to me, directly across from Dean Winchester, and watched as he downed the last of his beverage in one foul swoop, the orange and brown liquid traveling down his gullet slowly and steadily. I liked to pretend that he didn’t see, or at least feel, me staring, but that was only wishful thinking.
Dean picked up his glass and turned it in his hands a few times, swishing the mahogany liquid in his cup around, and he examined it like a scientist gazing through the lens on a microscope. I didn’t think there was much to see within its small waves and spicy aftertaste, but Dean seemed to think differently. It was pumping through his very veins, of course.
“There’s no need to apologize. We’re open until one AM, and anyone can come through within those hours as they please.”
The flattery colored in my skin again and, apart for me searching frantically for what his reasons were for now being so nice, I managed to say something polite in response.
“I did have an actual point in bugging you right now, besides attempting to save you from the Jesus freaks and ‘apocalypse-now’ crazies.”
“But I-I wouldn’t put it that way,” I continued. I wasn’t trying to be rude, as he seemingly thought I was. Or, perhaps I just assumed he thought I was being impolite. His statements kept contradicting each other, but I was too concentrated on the circles under his eyes. What was their cause? Surely it wasn’t just ordinary exhaustion. That’s what Friday night’s tired eyes were for.
There was so much more there, lurking behind his choice of replies and the mask of casual annoyance at what was coming. I knew, just by watching the way he sipped his drink (lips quivering, pointer finger drumming on the glass surface) that he was horrified of the outcome, but I had a hard time believing his father was all there was to it. He’d said it himself: he was concerned that Sam would be upset with him for staying by his dad’s side. There was guilt there, the anxious nagging of possible dejection.
Noting that the brief exchange of conversation seemed to be over, I leaned under the counter and reached for the bottle of scotch I’d hidden behind a rack of glasses, a bottle that I’d earlier decided to reserve solely for Dean. I thought it was safe to assume that he would order what he always did. It was one of the things I’d recorded in my mind, under the file named “Dean Winchester,” that was slowly expanding.
“I believe something is vibrating in the pocket of your jeans, Dean,” Cas explained to me, instantly pulling away from his favored spot on my neck just above my collarbone, acting as though we’d done nothing but pass by in the hall, complete strangers. He had a knack for immediately shutting down whatever kind of energy he accumulated during such exchanges.
“Oh...sorry about that,” I said hurriedly, my words mashed together into one breath. “Um, what are you-”
“Not a problem,” was my answer, and I was about to say my goodbyes when Bobby beat me to the punch, adding one last remark that made me want to reach through the phone and physically detract my acceptance of his favor.
One may think that the Friday night shifts would pack the most excitement and the largest assortment of bar crawlers, but the Friday night customers at most every pub were rather predictable. In the occasional times I'd worked the shift, I'd taken note of the college fraternity boys, who traveled in loud and unruly packs, as if they were incapable of disbanding and making decisions themselves, as well as speaking within a reasonable volume. Following them were the temporarily innocent sorority girls, who also trailed behind their male counterparts so closely that I imagined their roles like mother and child. It always pained me to know that the giggling purity that was dwindling in their hands would soon be stripped from them, but there was little one could do to pull them apart from the frat boys with beer dribbling down their chin and supposedly sexual murmurings escaping their slurred lips. I never had understood the attraction.
Dean’s never had the courage to do what Cas did three days ago. Dean’s never said that to anyone, not really. Because it feels like a lie when it comes out. Dean’s love is so huge that it doesn’t physically fit into words.
“Bobby Singer? Old dude, baseball cap, smells like liquor ‘n smoke?” he prompted. I’d forgotten to answer after getting so embarrassingly distracted.
For those few moments where his fingers laced together with my own, where he tilted his head and I could memorize the very ridges of the lips that were pressed up on mine, and where my fingers dug into the freezing leather of his jacket, I could forget about the world. I didn’t have to worry about understanding everything, I could just be, and that moment was the best state of just being that I could ever have been in. I could feel each sigh of his breath against my own skin and hear every minute noise he made, relishing in the fact that I was pushing such sounds from within. I loved the way his hands felt and I loved the fact that he wanted this too and that I wasn’t crazy. This was okay.
Eventually I made my way over to him, placed my hands on the bar's edge for support and in an attempt to look casual, and cleared my throat to gain his attention. I wasn't sure if it worked, of course, but hoped that the glass was half-full that evening and tried my luck by speaking
Sam’s figure looms large in the distance and Dean can’t help but look. A cold breeze hits the tears still tumbling down his face, and with a glance Sam pauses. His feet halt in their advance. He’s still.
A deep, rumbling noise came from the base of my throat as I cleared it, alerting Dean that I planned to speak, and hopefully implied that it would be a statement of worth. And while I hoped he didn’t mind my prying, my desire for inquiry got the best of me, and I was rid of my self control.
“I found it rather sad,” I murmured with a small shrug of my shoulders, squeezing out of the way as Charlie craned her head around my front to get a look at the subject in question, allowing me to get a faceful of her electric red hair. She didn’t seem to share in my sympathy, seeing as though her eyes were alive with curiosity and a twisted kind of humour.
Hello, you have reached the end of the fourth installment, and I hope you have found it at least satisfactory! I'm a little more behind than usual at the moment, since I'm not quite done with part five yet, and with school fast approaching, I may struggle with the current weekly schedule. I will do my best to maintain it though, as long as you promise to be understanding if it becomes too much!
Perhaps the suggestion, one that he’d probably never been offered before in his life, made just a small amount of sense to him.
“Would you like another?” I asked, the moment he’d finished dissecting the scotch, downed its remains in one go, and slammed the cup down on the bar with a resounding thud. He nodded in response to my offer, flicking the glass forward and towards my hands. It landed barely a millimeter away from the edge of my finger and I could feel the places where his own hands had grasped it, like hotspots.
I needed to change the subject. I reached under the bar for the reserved bottle of scotch, fought the urge to jump at the coldness of its surface, because apparently my hands had grown hot and sweaty within the conversation, and reached to retrieve Dean’s empty glass that lingered just outside of his reach. I could feel him watch me as I did so, his lack of protest giving me the go-ahead, and I poured. I poured slowly and listened to the noise, hoping it would drown out the heaviness of Dean’s breathing and the drum-like beat of my own blood through my veins.
That captivation was interrupted, however, with a mild sense of concern, seeing as though he was barely able to keep himself standing straight and upright. I called out to him again, for the fourth time that night, and my statement earned me his second response.
“And how do you feel about it?” I questioned, trying to remain as neutral a party as possible as not to put thoughts into his head or offend him by disagreeing. “About Sam coming to see you and your father?”
“What I need...is some booze, some time to destress, probably some pretty lady to help pass the time, and, well, more booze. And I’ll be fine. End of story.”
“Sam was always a total genius,” Dean had remarked, with a distant sort of pride illuminating his eyes. I couldn’t help but stare and listen.
I did find one in the form of a lesson, a lesson that a certain redhead had taught me seven whole days ago about how one is supposed to know when they’ve come in contact with the person they’re meant to spend the rest of their lives. I thought of the eye locking, the heart stopping, and all the cheesy, painfully juvenile aspects she’d taunted me with in an attempt to bring color to my cheeks and a smile of achievement to her face. It looked as though she would be succeeding, twice.
“Ya know, to be honest,” Dean began. The appearance of apology was no longer painted across his face or dulling the shine of his eyes, and I knew this for sure, because they were staring right at me. And, much like I had, Dean took in a mouthful of air before filling the anticipation-ridden silence with his gruff, deep, yet oddly sweet and charming way of speech,
I wanted to retract within myself the moment the sentence passed my lips. They sounded as though they’d been spoken by a being outside of myself, a distant piece of my mind that had no filter floating above the scene, and I observed with horror as the syllables and the breaths in between cast their effects down onto his already melancholic face. There was such a dark moment of realization, of admittance, and of pushed back memories within him that he couldn’t even look forwards, and the guilt was consuming me from the inside out, starting with my mind and seeping into every corner like ink dripping off of a rain-soaked page.
Dean laughed again in the low, dry way he had been and his face contorted into an expression that I didn’t want to see, like my question was forcing words out of his throat in a way so hurtful he couldn’t handle it. It was a silent form of crumbling, a silent way of losing all hope, a silent notice of defeat and exile.
“Jack sends his apologies. He’s…overwhelmed. With all the work. But he says he’s checked in on you two regularly, and this is the first spot of trouble that’s come up.”
“Yes, very, but it’s nothing abnormal. It is Friday, after all,” was my answer. “Er, it was Friday. It’s twenty-two minutes into Saturday now.”
The doorbell rang and he was gone, taking the light and the warmth and the joy of the night along with him and I had the sudden urge to collapse inward on myself. I’d lost something there, that was for certain, and I couldn’t fight the worry I had about his state of mind and his safety in getting home. Nothing was playing out right and it all had collapsed in just a mere couple of minutes. The night had been going so well and then time had to catch up and then I had to be too awkward to understand that maybe Dean had wanted things, whatever they were,to progress just half a step further, and now I was lonely and concerned and lost.
After taking in my response, Dean’s face darkened with humor over whatever slick reply had popped into his head, egged on by the drink he’d consumed, and I waited on the edge of my seat to hear it.
“Sammy has no clue when it comes to that stuff…” Dean interjected suddenly, and the mention of his brother shocked me into an even more intense form of attention. Where in the world had that come from?
“I miss the hell outta Sam, every day. I see Dean at least once a damn week but I never getta see Sam anymore, because he ran away the second he could,” he explained, eyeing everyone up before his gaze fell onto me. “I don’t know what kinda thoughts you planted into his head, boy, but he left and I was stuck with you, after I promised to keep you guys home, after I promised Mary I wouldn’t let ya outta my sight.”
“But I don’t need some...stranger listenin’ in on my life story and my issues, ‘kay? I appreciate your concern and all but…”
“Put this on, go outside, and don’t be so stupid,” she insisted, nearly begged. “I’ve been manning the bar and waiting tables all night and even I can tell that he was so damn into you that he could hardly stand it, and now he thinks you don’t care about him whatsoever-”
“Y-yes...he did. Last night we spoke for a while,” I stammered. It seemed, out of the blue, like Bobby and I’s conversation had occurred many days ago, not just a mere twenty four hours. So much had conspired in that span of time, not necessarily to myself but to Dean, especially, and that made it seem as though the length of the typical day had increased tenfold. But then, it made sense to me.
It’s not an excited kind of happy. My blood didn’t pump swiftly through my veins and arteries and there isn’t some life-changing event waiting to happen at the end of each day. It wasn’t the kind of happy I felt during those compromising situations I’d mentioned earlier, though that sort was definitely new and very much appreciated. It wasn’t even the calm sort of happy, like the time Cas and I traveled to Virginia to see the beaches because apparently he’d never gotten the chance to touch ocean water and nothing could beat the look in his equally as oceanic eyes when he stepped barefoot into the soggy sand along the shore. No, it wasn’t any of those kinds of happiness specifically, it was some kind of inexplicable mix of all of them together.
I had found myself distracted throughout her analysis, however. There had been an undermining thought not relating to her cheating and “no longer entirely straight” husband, a thought that had been badgering my mind for exactly a week, bouncing in and around the walls of my mind until I found my eyes permanently plastered on the pub’s front door, waiting for its bell to ring and to see who was entering. For the first time in as long as my memory could recall, I was expecting someone on a Thursday night full of unexpecteds. I had the image of their face clear in my head, the smell of their diluted cologne teasing my noise, and the sound of their iconic voice still torturing my eardrums.
I didn’t want to succumb to his level of communication, I didn’t want to respond to his teasing remarks and annoyingly casual way of speaking, and I certainly didn’t want to do so and let myself slip and say something I would regret. I was still in the middle of the game, and this was certainly a high point.
“You couldn’t have controlled or changed my deal with the Empty, Dean. Why do you insist on bearing responsibility for it?”
“And look at me now!” she exclaimed, her eyes blurry with tears and dripping mascara. “Ranting off about my life’s problems to some stranger bartender…”
Soon after, I could tell she had finished her piece and I left her to her drowning tube of nicotine and sad addiction and moved on to grabbing bottles of whiskey, replenishing those we’d emptied that night. So far I’d poured a seemingly endless amount to three men who’d just returned from a game of late-night golf, after having broken into the country club they’d been kicked out of for “drunken horseplay.” Their clothes were stained so intensely with grass that the smell nearly drowned out those of the smoker just a few bar stools away. And while the lot of them was amusing, my old distraction had begun to spring up again, like the ghost of my new favorite regular was breathing down my neck. The warm air smelled of scotch and stale, unspoken words.
I was growing frustrated with the large gaps in her reasoning, and maybe I was dwelling to intently on a matter that was just meant to swallowed, but I couldn’t fight the fiery, curious inkling dinging somewhere in the back of my mind like that damned front door’s bell.
And the rest of that night was spent in intervals of serious discussion about his childhood and everything else in between that had ever irked him, laughs about anecdotes he’d told me that him and Sam had taken part in as children, awkward moments spent purposely staring in opposite directions because one of us had unintentionally moved and sparked another reaction similar to my own, and before I knew it it was the top of the hour and I was supposed to be closing up shop.
“All the way down to how their hearts stop in the chest, just for a moment,” her hands fluttered to her chest, like she was weak with the emotions being described, and fluttered her eyes in an attempt to look faint with love. It earned a small bout of laughter from the two of us, but there was no denying her belief in the concept of soulmates. While I found it rather trivial, outlandish even, I didn’t want to rain to harshly on her parade, and I still wanted to know more.
“I-I didn’t screw up!” he shouted and his voice reached its peak volume, just as I reached my absolute limit.
And, to my immense relief, Sam’s frown evaporated into the brightest of smiles, brighter than even the color of his eyes, and not only did he accept my final attempt at satisfying his questions, he leapt up from the chair we’d stationed in the bathroom, turned around it in one clumsy, lopsided movement, and wrapped his thin, lanky arms around my middle. Even then, being a whole five years younger than myself, his head still came up to just under my chin.
I was out of practice, really. I couldn’t gage the damage such a statement would do to my father because I couldn’t quite so accurately tell how far gone he was anymore. While it was safe to say he’d started much earlier, the tang of his breath beating down on my left cheek a sure sign of it, I wasn’t sure of the extent. It’d been a few years since I’d stayed at home. It’d been a few years since I’d witnessed the process firsthand.
This time, it was Charlie’s turn to roll her eyes in exasperation. I knew I was being thick and blunt, but it was my last line of defenses, and I really did not want to hear whatever was about to make its way from her lips and into my ears. I didn’t think the shade of red on my cheeks could get any more red, or my face would simply burst into flames and spontaneously combust.
“Thank you, Dean...I would appreciate that,” were the words that I eventually settled on, said to my conversing counterpart as I looked him straight in the eye and without and sort of faltering. I meant what I said, and I began to hope Dean had meant what he’d had the nerve to say as well.
The word wrote itself all over Dean’s face, stung in my throat and the aftertaste set my tongue ablaze with the prematureness of the phrase and the embarrassment it lit up inside of me. I watched the process of recognition in Dean’s eyes and waited on the edge of my toes for his reaction, desperately running through the different scenarios to pick out the best way to deal with my foolishness, but one stood out the tallest among the others: repulsion. I could just picture the way the emotion would look across his scrunched up front.
Dean’s lips curved upward into the most devilish of lazy and gleefully incoherent smiles, showing off a row of flawless teeth and cheeks that were quickly turning beet red. Not with embarrassment, of course, for I doubted shame was a familiar sensation to Dean Winchester, but with the effects of his drinks and the obvious distress his prying was causing me.
“It’s not mine either. It’s entirely not my fault that Charlie Bradbury spilled one massive tub of blue cheese dressing all over the kitchen floor and that she demanded Kevin and I help her clean it up, just as I was leaving.”
I tried to place myself in his shoes, understand his attempt at being relatable, but the only example I could come up with was an alcoholic, and I was not one. I lied though and nodded my head, eyes wide in a blind sort of horror over what I was hearing firsthand, though nothing could bring me to speak.
The one thing I did not expect however, during my mental failure and his breakdown of his inner self, was for my shattering companion to speak, and validate the irreparably insensitive theory that had crawled from the depths of my head.
“You took the pretzels into the storage room earlier today, I saw you,” I announced, like a blatant and unnecessary description of the elephant in the room, and I scolded myself over and over again for only being able to speak after Kevin had departed, when any words from me were deemed utterly useless.
Dean Winchester’s voice came from deep within his chest, caught gravel and was scratched up in the process once it reached his throat, and the way his lips formed around the individual words allowed for much mumbling and several speech imperfections. Perhaps that it was just the drunken version, though one couldn’t deny the sound’s tremble. The way it came out in pieces only furthered my assumption: he was broken. Parts of him were in shattered fragments and instead of alcohol being the glue he so desperately needed and searched for, it merely separated the fragments farther until some were lost and deemed irreplaceable.
My thoughts were distracting me. I stopped myself from walking out into a busy street, full of cars buzzing both ways, when I heard two drivers engage in a particularly angry exchange from the stop light about how driver A had cut driver B off, and apparently driver B “couldn’t give two shits,” which didn’t go over well with his companion. I had to side with driver A, of course, because it was common courtesy to apologize for one’s reckless driving. So I stood at the edge of the sidewalk, toes peeking over the curb as I rocked back and forth in wait for the volley of vehicles to cease, and pulled my trench coat further across my shoulders and into my chest. It was just occurring to me then that the last of fall was fading away, along with its red and orange and yellow coloring, though I suppose the stop lights and electric colored cars would suffice as fall foliage. Living in the city prohibited much of nature’s natural progression of the seasons.
“He’s so far gone that he doesn’t even remember so much of what’s happened…”Dean had murmured in the middle of his recounting of his most recent family reunion. “Sam was literally right there tellin’ him that what I was saying was right and it was like he’d shut everything that he didn’t wanna hear out.”
“C’mon Cas, you’ve never heard of soulmates? People that are destined to be in love, like they were put on this Earth solely to find the other person?”
Charlie’s words echoed in some unidentifiable corner of my mind, but their ring died down upon hearing Dean’s reply.
“It was stupid,” he added, with finality, as though the matter was really closed and that I would just leave it there, to torture him and keep him wallowing in the swell of self-hatred arising from his insides in a magnitude that I’d never witnessed. I was almost disappointed in him; he knew me better than that. I bent over and behind the bar, searching for the bottle I’d poured from earlier, and while I refilled his glass, I said the following,
“Your father must’ve been very hard on you,” was all I remember saying, and I wanted to wrap his hand in mine and try to stop its shaking.
The Dean that I was being faced with then, the one with the sad eyes, slouching shoulders, crumbling walls and inability to find any worth in himself, was the aftermath of his trip to his father’s. Bobby had been right, and now his words weren’t only echoing in my ears like a flashback, they were being blared against my eardrums like a megaphone was inches away. I didn’t wince from the volume, however, just my stupidity and ignorance, as well as my shattered hopes. I’d thought, maybe since Sam and Dean had reunited and reconciled well, that the same luck and family-born love would transfer to the second of visits, but I’d been very wrong. The evidence was refraining from staring me in the face, of course, but it was just as plain to see nevertheless.
“He did a hell of a lot more than just ‘be my brother,’ that’s for sure!” Sam spat. “You walked all over him. You let him pick up your pieces.”
“It’s not that I didn’t enjoy our time yesterday, I just think it would be more beneficial to you if there was less alcohol in your system,” is how I believe it was phrased.
Secondarily, I made note of the creases on the right side of his face. One may think it was the imprint of a pillow, but I thought differently. Dean’s hand was trained intently on his left pocket where I could see the bulge of his phone emerge, and it was the only part of his body that seemed to be carrying out a task with a large amount of precision. The creases and lines streaked across his cheek and ear were from a phone, and judging from their intensity and his finger’s grip around his cellular device, he’d recently had a very important conversation.
Cas is watching as Sam darts away. Moonlight bounces off his eyes and excitement thrums in between Dean’s panic at the moment he turns and confronts him with the full force of his gaze.
Cas props Dean against the barn’s exterior. To his right is a bale of hay, to his left a pitchfork, to his front a once-deceased angel looking as he did eons before. And he removes his grasp from Dean too suddenly, too confidently, as though it isn’t insanity incarnate that they were able to touch again in the first place.
“I didn’t think you’d notice,” I admitted, edges of my mouth dipping into my cheeks as they were colored pink. And Dean’s were doing the same.
I am SO sorry for the wait on this one. I was actually at a concert a good four and a half hours away on Friday night and the time for writing just seemed to escape me this past week, so the bulk of this chapter was written today. I hope you can forgive whatever foolish spelling/grammar mistakes are left. Also, I know this is a MONSTER in length, so if you read all the way through, hats off to you! I wanted to get this very important installment done and published as a whole so the next final part will make more sense. It's an epilogue, I suppose, and it's sure to be just lovely.
I had no more sarcastic grins, looks of exasperation, or frustrated sighs to give her at that point, and even if I had, she was out of the bar and into the kitchen at a speed I didn’t know she could reach. The need for escape was a very efficient motivator, I found out, more so than the need to combat, and I left her be to her own assumptions. I just hoped they didn’t get inside my own head too much and cloud my vision. I needed to be wholly focused on the task at hand and grasp the goal: learning all that there was to know about Dean Winchester.
“There’s two whole crates full of pretzels in the trunk of my car that I need for tonight, since we’re almost out, and I have to talk to Castiel about something in private. Would you mind getting them for me?”
“I’m just trying to convince you to act on it,” She went on, her voice increasing in severity. “I don’t want you and your lack of people skills--which I do love you for, don’t get me wrong--to get in the way of a real chance here, okay?”
Dean didn’t seem to agree with me, however, and shook his head no rather furiously, hinting that perhaps his previous drink was now beginning to affect him. I liked to think that it was helping him bring forward and unveil the hurt and the wounds he was trying to hard to conceal.
Dean’s vision flicked upward with more speed than he’d shown in the whole six minutes and forty-one seconds he’d been at the bar, and I saw the lights of recognition illuminate somewhere in his pupils, a satisfying process to watch. I noted the easing of his expression, evident in the lessened crease of his brow and the relaxation of his jaw. He was relieved to see me, and it nearly floored me.
“Thanks though,” She chimed, and the double doors bustled back and forth behind her. Within seconds, I could feel Kevin’s eyes train on me.
Dean didn’t want that bitterness. No, he’d never wanted it. He’d built it up, constructed monuments to its name, lined his innards with the stuff, carved moats of lies and back alleys out of those testy, sweaty conversations, hammered the windows shut with broken, almost-something stares, bolted the doors closed with unsaid words, huddled in the dungeons upon every resisted touch.
“You’re distressed about something,” I answered steadily and slowly. “Until you feel well enough to tell me and get it off your chest, I’ll wait here.”
“You’re an angel, Castiel. Any guy or gal would be incredibly lucky to call you their own.  And don’t forget that conversation we had about soulmates the other day. Very educational stuff.”
“I’ll stop by later tonight, I promise,” I said, grabbing my coat that was hung near the bed, because upon purchasing my first apartment for two, one has to give up the luxury of having a door more than ten feet from your bed, and getting ready to leave for good that time, no more surprises or distractions or dangerously intoxicating hands along my waist to keep me from going to work. I did intend on keeping my promise though, since I hadn’t paid a visit to the pub in a long while and it just so happened to be a place of rather large worth to Castiel and I.
Charlie sighed and continued her piece as she leaned up against the bar. I watched her fling a rag that had been clutched in her hand over her shoulder.
Dean looked on at me with his mouth converting into a small smile of curiosity, relief, yet a little twinge of surprise, and seeing that I was in no shape to initiate anymore conversation, he took the reigns.
“No, I think I’m pretty right on this one,” She implored. “No judging here of course. Hell, I’m happy for you-”
“Charlie, I think you have the wrong idea here,” I said, finally being physically able to interject my say into the exchange. She seemed slightly taken aback by me speaking, but held her tongue if she planned to protest, and her listening was greatly appreciated.
I began inching my forward, my steps along the dark hardwood floor small and helpless, until I was sure all the fiddling with the object in my pocket and the wandering of my eyes in the world couldn't prevent him from noticing my presence advancing towards him. I could never been one-hundred percent sure, however, since he still refused to meet my eyes head on. I would be lying if I said that it wasn’t beginning to drive me crazy.
Dean merely shrugged his shoulders passively, like no matter what words came past my lips, they wouldn’t lessen his anxiety or the severity of the situation, and it created of well of sadness caught somewhere in my chest.
I was instantly lost as to what her intentions were and where I was supposed to follow her words. Where in the world had that come from? Never had there been a time in the years that I’d know Charlie Bradbury where I had ever been truly upset or angry with her; I’d thought such a emotion was impossible to direct her way. Yes, there was the occasional episode where her pestering made its way just centimeters under my skin, caused a little itch of annoyance, and sometimes I did roll my eyes at her forgetfulness when it came to placing the supply closet keys in random places, and her sneaky methods of getting out of closing up shop weren’t ideal, but everything’s frustration put together wouldn’t even equal the irritation a papercut caused. Charlie was lovely, always.
In a flash of red hair, movement, and muttered curse words under her breath, Charlie dashed and grabbed me my trench coat, and I think I was beginning to catch on. But if I went outside, what was I supposed to do?
Just as quickly as the ID had appeared, it vanished and was slid back into its designated pocket inside his ages wallet as this Dean character slapped down the necessary amount of cash needed to pay for the last couple beverages he'd consumed. In fact, the wad of money he'd forcefully placed on the counter was about five dollars more than what was required, and as I carefully took the green slips of paper in my hands and began counting out the change, I was alarmed for a second time in no longer than a minute and a half…
“So,” She began, foreboding locked tightly in her tone. I couldn’t tell whether she was being dramatic to purposefully drive me mad, or if the subject at hand really meant that much to her.
After a few moments of tense silence, feeling as though I’d just been put under a microscope and examined like a scientific specimen, I stood back a half-step to admire my work and was satisfied. His shoulders and the first inch or so of his neck was now visible, in what my Dad called the “acceptable-manly-haircut-range,” and I deemed the job to be done. I clapped Sam once on the shoulder, signaling that he could move and get out whatever little-kid jitters he’d accumulated after sitting so perfectly still, but not before saying in a calm, gentle tone,
From the outskirts of my peripheral vision, I saw Dean’s own eyes perk up and widen at the thought of free drinks, and his expression shifted, now appearing to be confused. The sound of the scotch bottle emptying nearly drowned out his response, a word that I didn’t really expect to hear pass his round, pink lips,
I’d completely failed him, and I couldn’t take their current screaming that served as a constant reminder of that.
Dean shook his head incredulously, like he was lost for words or had lost the ability to speak them, but I didn’t press. I simply waited for the response to come to him, and it did, after another swig of his drink. I would offer him more of his favorite stress-reliever after he finished his piece.
In minutes I’d learned a couple’s entire situation, their demeanor, (the wife being a workaholic, probably the boss of many, judging by the way in which she ordered her drinks and the wrinkles on her face. Certain wrinkles on the face were caused by certain things, of course. The husband was a follower, the complement of her and not the other way around. But anyone could figure that out if they had even just a brief amount of knowledge of family dynamics.) and could even tell you the ways that they both held their drinks and what the man’s breath smelled like, yet all I knew about Dean was that he was into cars. It was mindlessly frustrating to say the least, and none of that frustration subsided until the very end of the night.
The same, fiery smell continued on inward and I marveled at Sam’s lack of wincing. Maybe he’d expected as much though. Maybe he’d been perceptive enough, after all. It had taken me a good forty-five minutes to get fully accustomed to it, and by that time Bobby had arrived and prompted my dad to start his version of a house tour all over again, from start to finish. I didn’t see much point in being shown a house that I’d helped put together just weeks ago, but my father didn’t feel the same way. He didn’t remember the same way I did.
My head shot up at the sound of the door opening, the bell attached the doorframe chiming for the seventeenth-dozen time that day. With his entrance came a weight into the room, like the constant chatter of the customers and the clinking of glasses subsided for a moment to take this presence in, and his heavy outer-garments I described earlier didn't help in the least. He blocked out the streetlight that usually seeped in from the door's windows with his shoulders and his shadow, which had originally painted itself across the immediate wooden floor beneath his feet, combined with the new resulting darkness.
I flinched at the sound of her using my newly appointed nickname, but my tensing meant nothing to her and she continued her analysis of the situation she’d so clearly witnessed...secondhand. And with a kitchen door with but one small, circular window separating her from Dean and I as it played out.
Dean’s green, flecked eyes were damp with tears, not emerging forth past his eyelids, but plentiful enough that they pooled and glimmered in the dim lighting overhead. His shoulders trembled with every slow intake of breath and his face, not contorted into an expression of frustration of his drunken sort of aggression, was lax and sad and distant, long gone, it seemed like, and it wasn’t right. It wasn’t normal. It wasn’t something I’d predicted in the least, wasn’t something that I could understand, not an outcome that I could’ve anticipated, and certainly wasn’t a situation that I knew how to deal with. Unfortunately, this realization didn’t come to me until my own hands were lying near Dean’s, shaking in a way vastly similar to his own, and he was looking straight at me. Trying to find answers. Trying to find reassurance or support, something that I could not give him.
“He’s probably savin’ up for one of those stupid Honda hybrid cars, the ones that look like mini-spaceships or something like that,” he said with disgust, but those undertones were echoing underneath his voice again, and I could hear the traces of that eternal brotherly love. “I always hate when someone brings one of those to the shop, ya know? Why not just go by a new one, if their mass-producing them so cheaply anyways.”
“I was more of a ‘live in the moment’ kinda guy, went through tons of girls during school, drinking whenever my dad was outta sight...the works. I barely scraped by, really. Not cuz I’m dumb or anything like that, I just...never had the room to care.”
“I am serious, Dean. There’s nothing wrong with trying...no one can blame you for doing so. Your father is your family and there’s no changing that. I’m sure, underneath it all, he cares for you very deeply.”
“H-hello…” I stuttered, wondering if I should touch on his familiarity to me. Would that ease the the tension he’d brought? With one more look at his clenched jaw, I decided against it.
“Well, I think you should give yourself more credit, cuz you’re a pretty damn good bartender a not a bad listener.”
“The drinks are on the house tonight,” I announced to her as I poured her the second round of amber-colored whiskey. “I can see you need it tonight.” It was the smallest act of kindness I could think of compared to the hurricane she currently found herself lost in the middle of, but it eased the pain I was experiencing through hearing her story, so I was selfish in my methods.
Dean sent me another one of his quizzical looks, still without judgement though, and I suddenly remembered how abnormal our collection of names sounded to those outside of the family, and even me when I was forced to list them aloud. I quickly hashed out an explanation, eager to avoid much talk on the subject of my siblings. Just like their personalities weren’t easy to handle, neither was my telling of our history together.
He laughed dryly, the sound weezy and ultimately false, at what I thought was a rather sad, yet hard to trace, comment bringing down his own personality and life choices, and it certainly did not strike me as a statement to be laughed at. Regardless, I continued to listen intently to every breath that passed his lips, recording the sentences and the ways in which they were said in my head with utmost care.
Bobby was not a soft-talker, did not have an inside-voice, so Cas heard the length of his comment and chuckled proudly to himself as his fingers danced along the back of my neck, flicking my collar down. I gave him a rather dubious look but it did little to dampen his spirits, and I went back to the quickly failing conversation.
He’d left Castiel hanging. Even as Cas tried to anchor Dean into the oncoming reality, the one of which he was no longer a part, placing that same hand on that same shoulder, and waltzing into the big black nothing, Dean had left him hanging. How was that his greatest happiness? How was that Castiel’s “okay?”
“Sorry to come today, not usually one of my scheduled visits I guess…” he muttered, his try for humor only making the very sight of him all the more pitiful.
It didn’t even matter that Dean had downed the last of his drink at that point, and that it was messing with his mind, increasing the incoherentness and decreasing most levels of intelligent thought, along with his basic fine-motor skills (his hands had begun fumbling over the empty glass), because I clung to the idea that there was a fragment of truth to his reply. I held on to the chance that the alcohol amplified some deep secret locked away, and that he did appreciate me lending in ear, and that maybe I wasn’t just imagining it all, and that maybe the hole I’d dug myself into was worth it.
Charlie, on the other hand, was a different story, a much more invasive, inappropriate, and troublesome story. Once again, Dean Winchester had stayed at the bar’s edge until the very moment we were closing (and he still denied my call for a taxi, prompting an undertone of worry that still hadn’t been extinguished four days later.), and while I was feeling the late night effects, Charlie had enough energy to split between the two of us. She chose to spend it on ruthlessly interrogating me though, and it went something like this:
I held in my groan and Cas, noticing my aggravation, began busying himself with re-buttoning the first few buttons at the top of my shirt, adjusting my collar as he did so.
“You woke up earlier than usual today.” It was said with innocence and observation and I couldn’t help but giggle, the sound moving Cas’s figure up and down slightly, since he was still perched lightly atop my middle, and he waited for my response.
“You’re not interested in little miss broken dreams and too much wine because you’re into sir leather- jacket-and-dangerous-jawline!”
“No, he’s not. He always leave when I wake up ‘n he comes home when I’m going to bed,” Sammy insisted, and I could in the mirror in front of us both that a frown of annoyance and knowledge that a five year old shouldn’t have had emerged across Sam’s mouth.
The familiarity was a bullet into my defenses and I fell into a brief stuttering silence, blowing my walls and shattering my facades, and I could do nothing as Dean sauntered weakly away. His footsteps were a new and unintentional kind of heavy, his shoulders sank with a weight that wasn’t merely his jacket. He shouldn’t be allowed to drive; he would put himself and the others around him in danger, and I wasn’t satisfied with the painfully minimal amount of information I’d gathered about him that night.
“Hell, that’s somethin’ to drink to,” my dad said, and my brother nearly lost it in a plume of smoke while Bobby sat back in dismay, in awe and horror over the chaos that had ensued because of his singular statement. And it was all I could do to eye Sam, beg him not to play on those stingingly ironic words that had just been said. We didn’t need anymore tension or conflict and no amount of satisfaction or proven points could convince me otherwise of that.
I had thrown him quite the curveball by using his name as a tool to prompt him into sharing his story. Fortunately, by the time I got around to explain how I’d learned it in the first place, he was too far away from the knowledgeable light of sobriety to consider the general creepiness and oddity of it all, for I highly doubted memorizing the name on a driver’s license peeking out from someone’s wallet as their trying to pay is considered normal. To be quite frank, quite little of the situation I’d found myself in with Dean Winchester was considered normal by any means.
I could feel my throat tense, constrict with guilt yet a polite kind of submission. I highly doubted he would listen to anymore pestering, no matter how much sincere concern I showed for his wellbeing and ability to successfully return home. The way his loose, stumbling fingers fumbled dependently on the door knob, as if it was the only thing holding his shaking knees upright, only furthered my theory. He was definitely leaving and wanted no assistance in doing so.
He sat down four seats away from the old woman, so two away from where I was stationed behind the bar, and his elbows slammed against the counter. The impact caused the other glasses seated on the surface to quake slightly, and I knew I had my work cut out for me. Often times those who paid the pub a visit did not want to be understood and liked to drape themselves in what they thought was mystery, but the added effort only made them more transparent. I finished my business with the woman, as politely as possible, and eventually made my way over to the newcomer.
I soon regained my stance and stuffed the keys into my pants' pocket as my boss gave me one last wave of a goodbye and disappeared out the back door, leaving me nearly completely alone in the almost vacant pub. The only other presences I was sharing oxygen with were the last of those rather strange, cult-invested men and the mystery man stationed a few feet away, and the others were just about to walk out the door. In a matter of moments it would be the mystery man and myself.
“I’m alright, it didn’t mess me up too bad, but I’m so worried about Sammy. He grew up like that, right from the start.”
Eventually, however, I saw Dean’s shoulders sag in a sigh and his lips parted slightly, over and over again, in search for the words he needed to stitch together his reply, and I waited patiently for as long as I was capable.
The young woman smiled, a smile full of submission and emulating an injured spirit, and I felt it rather challenging to meet her gaze, especially when I knew there wasn’t much I could do to ease her pain.
“Well, Michael is the overachiever of the group. He’s living in California I believe, with a wife and a good three kids. He’s always wanted a Jaguar as well-the car, not the animal of course-so he probably has bought one, or seven by now.”
I saw Charlie open her mouth upon my pause, but, in a strange turn of events, I was the one to beat her to the punch, and I’d be lying if I said that it wasn’t satisfying.
What he had just said, within the current context, along with the tone of his voice and the raise of his eyebrow gave me the discrete, barely-there impression that he was implying something other than simply kindness and the help to educate me further in what I considered to be an overly-masculine form of a pass-time. Flashbacks of Charlie’s countless lessons on social cues and the scary world of relationships came to mind, causing me to swallow hard and bite my tongue. That was a matter to be thought about a different and more private time.
“Geez man, I’m sorry,” Dean announced, startling me and crashing my train of thought. What in God’s name did Dean have to be sorry for?
“I lost everything when Mary died. You were his brother, Dean. You HAD to look out for him, you had no choice, just like I had no choice to carry on when Mary died-”
Again, the details were where the excitement lay. Only on Thursday night would a young housewife, with sa lot of life left in her, come to the pub, drink out her feelings with glass after glass of merlot, and despair over her cheating husband who happened to have a lot more secrets than he’d ever let on. They’d been married seven years, she’d told me, and in those seven years she never suspected anything. And that’s why I was hearing her story then, relishing in its element of surprise yet still trying to find the adequate balance of empathy and creepy interest.
“Evenin’.” Dean announced with a small dip of his head while the corners of his lips pushed further into the red of his cheeks, the change in color obviously brought on by the chilled weather, and I watched for but a moment as he rubbed his sturdy hands together in an attempt to keep them warm. I didn’t even have a satisfactory amount of time to marvel at the fact that he’d been the first one to speak, and had done so voluntarily.
“You’re the ones who all think I’m a drunk, that ‘imma lousy father, that I gotta be locked away ‘n some facility...well if you get to confess whatever the hell’s on your minds, then I do too!”
Dean is gripping Castiel’s collar before his mind catches up. The texture is known, almost soothing, so when Cas tilts his head once again, a dreadful realization dawning on his features, Dean squeezes. It’s firm. Concrete. Fair. Both Dean and Cas clench their teeth.
“C’mon now, you’re being ridiculous!” Bobby insisted, rising forward from his seat some and approaching me in some half-courageous, though still half-terrified stance of defense. I would’ve liked to be able to say that I was holding my own, that I’d been able to deny Bobby’s silent offer of protection against those words being spat mercilessly into my face and onto my shoulders, but that would be lying, and my father was doing enough lying to compensate for the three of us and then some. I held my tongue and looked on with disbelief, with a surreal, otherworldly sort of hurt throbbing within my chest.
He was so intoxicated that I almost laughed, which would’ve painfully strange after having shared an act even more intimate than our endless stares from earlier, but the happiness lighting up his features, brightly enough to illuminate the darkness one one o’clock in the morning, was enough to make my head go blank with a bliss I couldn’t define nor describe. I knew, despite the drinks that I’d supplied him with, that this was for real and that such a bliss was overwhelmingly mutual. It was written all over his face, in the creases of his mouth, and across the lines of his hand’s palm.
All she got in response was the sinking of my shoulders and a harsh glance, hopefully letting her know that as happy as I was to see her, I was simply not in the mood for her shenanigans, and that I had work to do. I had a conversation to start and a shell to crack. Unfortunately, while Charlie did understand the intent behind my stare, she also took it as a yes, confirming her theory, and a look of excitement and thrill lit up her face. I hoped she’d let me handle this one on my own, though.
My lack of understanding in regards to  John Winchester’s intentions and methods in which he decided to carry them out prohibited me from speaking much more than a few stammered, broken syllables, so I discarded the more vocal of my options and hoped that the remaining one would suffice. Trying my hardest to convey my willingness to understand, my willingness to listen, I stared on down to Dean with a softened gaze and a face free of judgment. He needed to confess things, and maybe it was the brushing of our knuckles against each other for the second time that night, or maybe he finally trusted me enough to allow me to be his shoulder, his crutch, his source of support that took on whatever form he needed, I don’t know, but the very muscles in his face relaxed, and so did my nerves.
She added her last remark with a low chuckle, one that would’ve caused a smile to paint itself across my own face on any typical day, but it was too busy catching color and heat then, and the current situation was not one to grin at.
The last part of my response didn’t seem like it made much sense to Dean and he sent me a quizzical look, as though I was without any pants and undergarments, and I felt a flush of embarrassment color in my neck again with a harsh red and a lighter pink on my cheeks.
“You’re tellin’ me…” he began, letting his hands cascade down his face as if to wipe away the stress and exhaustion that had accumulated atop his brow. “I haven’t seen the kid in what, like two years? I have no idea what he’s thinking, coming down to visit now…”
“You’re probably wonderin’ why the hell I stayed with the man for so long, while I still support him today,” he said with an increased volume and a vain attempt at humor evident in the sound, though I had to admit his statement did align with my inquiries.
“You remember him, right?” Dean continued, causing me to snap out of thought that I hadn’t even realized I’d been consumed in, and I nodded my vigorously, eager to let him know I’d paid attention to what he’d relayed to me. Perhaps it would make the “friend” word ache a little less.
I cut her off by placing a few more inches of distance between us and sending her the most intimidating stare I could, given my current mental state. Any other day I would be able to suffer through her jokes, maybe even enjoy them to an extent, but I had a mission that needed carrying out. A game that needed to be won as soon as possible.
“Of course,” I paused, resolving to go ahead and be daring and say things I wouldn’t normally say. It seemed to work wherever Dean was concerned.
