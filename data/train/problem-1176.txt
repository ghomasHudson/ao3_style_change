“No, he still waits and doesn't understand why he has been sent away. You can be happy he is such a stubborn man, too. I believe he really likes you. He doesn't want to lose you, Sherlock. Do not destroy this. You have found a friend, a good man, and perhaps there might even be more for you in it.” They looked into each other's eyes.
John looked at Sherlock’s back. His naked back. It was bruised and covered in welts, some old and some new. Some bloody and some not.
“Yes, that would be better. I don't want to risk an infection.” Now they both nodded and Sherlock was scared by that bit of information. What implants? What was John up to? He hectically panted.
“At first, we have to take you off that hook. I need a proper light to free you completely. I promise to be very careful when cutting through the metal. I need to know if you can hold still.” Sherlock snorted and it somehow calmed both Mycroft and Greg. The soldier took it as the confirmation it was and nodded.
Sherlock’s grip became tighter around John’s hips. They kissed. Well, John kissed him because Sherlock didn’t kiss back. Not for many minutes, but it suddenly changed.
He bluntly told him that he wasn't interested and James confronted him. He tried to use his powers but Sherlock fought back. And he won. He banned him after having injured him badly. We both believed him dead, at least we thought him no danger. Obviously, we were wrong. Now he is back, has found himself a mate and got Sherlock.”
“You won't lose me. And if you hurt me, it happens with my full consent. I am not some person made from bone china.” John insisted.
“It scared me what I did. Your reaction though was good and I am happy now, too. It was good to have stayed.” He quietly said. Again, Ian reached out and took his hand. And this time he simply took it without asking for permission. Sherlock just smiled and pressed it. Ian broadly smiled and they looked at each other for a while.
“Well, you haven’t sucked me dry yet. So, from what I’ve heard you will probably want to collar and keep me. You will feed off me. And …” Sherlock raised his eyebrows.
When John woke the following morning, he was still dressed. He had a horrible headache and was on his front on the bed. He groaned and got up very slowly.
Right after John had angrily ranted about it back home, Sherlock had hacked into Tesco’s system and did something really nasty. His brother hadn’t been very happy about it but John had a splendid time.
“Get changed.” Sherlock simply did as being told not wondering at all why he should dress into his pyjamas and not get naked.
“No. I don’t want to relax. I was looking forward to this for a very long time and I won’t allow it to end like this! It just can’t be! You have to do something! To me, I mean. I need to, need to…” Helplessly he shook his head.
But they waved to him when they left for several cars. Now Greg felt really good. He had been accepted as a part of this mission and not just the side-kick of their commanding officer which actually had been Mycroft.
“Or he had him trained well enough to appear by his dom's side and behave like the perfect sub he is.” Mycroft downed his wine and cupped it up right away.
This had been surprisingly nice. At first, he had thought it would be boring and tiresome but this man had been perfect. He wondered what his problem was. Every dom should be happy to have this man beneath him.
He slowly pulled out the penis-plug and stroked his cock. He pulled him up a bit and knelt behind him. He took aim and shoved his cock inside his hole. Sherlock flapped like a fish on the ground and John held him tight. He fucked him hard and it didn't take long until they came. He even let him come first and when he weakly slumped in his grip, he filled him up. Afterwards, he plugged him, something he had never done before. But all of this they hadn't done before and he was convinced, Sherlock liked it.
“You have heard me, Gregory. Tie me down and leave me be. There are enough things in my bag to do it properly. And when I say bondage, I am talking bondage everywhere.” Greg swallowed. He was good with ropes. Probably, Mycroft had seen it while doing his research.
“Why? You really like him; I can sense it. And he does like you, he really does. And you didn't really need to glamour him at all.” Sherlock took his brother's hand.
And only when they were all gone, the police had asked their questions, and the body had been taken away, John broadly smiled throwing himself on his smallish bed. He still felt high and he had held back until now; until it was quiet again.
“Molly showed me the autopsy report. It looked promising. Death because of nothing. They didn’t find any poison in the blood or drugs. So, I want to check on his stomach.”
Finally, he poured another wine and settled on the sofa with another folder of Greg's. He had brought work with him, of course he had. He typed his notes into his laptop and worked for several hours.
Sherlock heard the door close and looked out of the window in the living room. He saw Greg starting to run and he ran fast. He raised a brow. His moves weren't relaxed and his face looked unmoving. Had something happened?
“Yes, Greg.” Greg was pleased for now and gestured him over to sit on the bed. Normally he would have made him sit on the ground so he could reach him from a sitting position but he didn't want him to sit on the ground. That's why he climbed up on the bed and knelt behind him. His fingers moved through his hair. He already had a thick rubber-band in his pocket. He braided the masses of dark curls but not too tight. He slung the rubber-band over the hair at the bottom. He had a look at him and was rather pleased with his work.
“I have trouble finding the correct words. I can’t put my feelings into a proper sentence. You do this to me, John. And it is a first for me.” Sherlock smiled as well.
“You need a distraction then. I can provide that.” He let go of him and got the bag he had brought. Greg just couldn't resist and touched his cock. He firmly held it and moved his thumb over the head while he waited for Mycroft to return.
He got the rent-boy out of the box. He had brown, longish hair and huge green eyes. His mouth was stuffed with something and several layers of fabric covered his mouth. His torso was hidden inside a straightjacket and his groin was covered in an oversized diaper only used in asylums being shown in horror films.
The man pressed against his back and he bent over and spread his legs. A lubed plug was shoved into his still clenching hole. It was huge but it worked just fine due to the preparation over the night. The plug was held inside with a set of straps which went around his thighs and hips, too.
“What about it anyway? You just told me that you said where to find the corpse and left them. Greg probably wasn’t really amused, was he?” John asked.
“Any time, my lovely.” John smiled and got his jacket. He pocketed his wallet and mobile and stood by the door.
“OK, I’ll help you.” Moriarty didn’t answer but kept watching him. John moved to his side and helped him up. He was still clad in one of those horrible hospital gowns which were open on the back.
“Let's then. My place?” Mycroft just nodded and grabbed his wrist. The same moment Sherlock returned. He stood close to John putting his arm around his shoulder.
“Yes, Master.”  Sherlock was excited. They would go somewhere. He would leave this flat. Was this some kind of reward? But what was it that his dom couldn't do here?
“Oh…” Greg could both see and hear the understanding tone in his voice. Sherlock had just thought that John forbid him something. He hadn’t thought of the roof from which he had jumped.
„Do you need anything?“ Sherlock asked but the door just got closed right into his face. He stared at the wooden surface and a single tear rolled over his cheekbone. He lowered his head and went downstairs to sit in his armchair. He sat there for hours, still clad in his coat.
Then James Moriarty appeared from the midst of the tree-line. The moment their eyes met Jim dashed forward. He fell on his knees by his side and his hands touched him all over his body.
John hurried along and paid everything. He carried the bags outside and looked for a corner where he could make his call and, more importantly, where no one could listen in to his conversation.
“It depends. You will need to talk before the real session starts. I believe, two hours will suffice.”
“I don't know what to say. I don't know what I would do without you, Gregory.” He looked at him and Greg reached out for his hand.
“We are rather close. He stayed with me for a longer period of time when he had just gotten off the drugs. He didn’t want to stay with his brother and he knew he wouldn’t manage to stay on his own. So, he stayed with me. I agreed because my wife had just left and I was so alone.”
Sherlock’s mouth stood open and he stared down at John who had licked his lips and now knelt straight up waiting. Gently he placed his hand on his head and stroked.
Sherlock felt him relax beneath him and soon added a second finger. He worked him up to four fingers until he started to stroke his own prick. It didn't take long until Sherlock was completely hard. He lined up and carefully pushed inside. He locked eyes with John who slowly lifted his arms. Their fingers entwined and Sherlock leant forward. He held him down while he started to push inside.
? What did that mean? Sherlock didn’t understand and decided to wait for John to explain this to him. He really didn’t want to call his brother.
He needed to use the loo. He carefully pulled the huge thing out and quickly sat down. This felt like a very good enema and he was completely relaxed when done. He took a refreshing shower afterwards. Now he donned pyjamas, a t-shirt, and his favourite dressing-gown. Then he joined John in their kitchen watching him.
Would it be enough to visit a club like Irene's? Let himself be dommed and afterwards go home again?
Instead, he started to flick the clamps on his nipples. He used more clamps and put them on his balls.
Right then, the police arrived. Several constables in uniform entered the room as well as two people in suits. Their host pointed them over and they stepped up.
John parked the car in front of the house and they stepped up the few stairs. Inside it was semi-dark and not very fresh. John sighed and started to open the windows. Sherlock did, too, and received a smile in return. He felt much better at once. They entered the master-bedroom and Sherlock didn't know what he was supposed to do. Where John wanted him to wait or do whatever. He stood a bit helplessly in the middle of the room.
“Yes, of course, I am human. But I am someone under control. Well, mostly. Greg instead is very emotional.” Mycroft still just looked at him. Bela smirked behind his back on the passenger seat but didn’t comment.
A few minutes passed without John talking. He just carded through his hair and Sherlock almost fell asleep. John pressed his head down on his thigh and felt him relax.
Ian asked him to undress and he did it. Cuffs were placed on his wrists and ankles. They were made of soft leather and their insides were even padded with cashmere. Not even John had those. Sherlock liked them, liked the feeling on his skin.
John started to hit him. He would be bruised tomorrow and his body would show welts. He hit hard but Sherlock managed to be quiet. He was used to this and he also feared the collar too much. His teeth bit into the ball-gag and he actually thanked his dom for choosing a rubber ball-gag. He owned wooden and metal ones, too, so he probably would have lost several teeth in the process.
“I like him. I even like him close. John left me with him before his clean up. And Ian treated me well. He gave me something to do and he trusted me. He helped me in the end.” Sherlock exhaled and drank more wine.
“What about the place you found him? What was it again? Baker Street?” Greg asked after having topped up their drinks.
“OK then, I guess?” He smiled up at him and elicited a bright smile in return. He crept even closer and slung his arms around John’s shoulders pulling him against his chest. Now John was able to feel his erection, too. Sherlock’s fingers were holding his chin up. And then he kissed him. Languidly he moved his lips over John’s and pushed his tongue between them. He licked over his teeth and gum and even gently sucked his tongue.
He sensed John close. He stood in front of him. He heard him open his belt and expectantly Sherlock licked his lips. He could finally give him pleasure, could finally touch him. And even if he couldn’t do it with his hands and fingers, it would be his tongue and mouth.
John leant against the bondage rack and crossed his strong arms over his chest. One leg was over the other and he looked completely relaxed.
The dream he had, had been intense. He took it as a sign. He also knew if he wouldn't tell Sherlock sorry, Ian would spank the living hell out of him. He wouldn't care if Sherlock was present or not. He would turn back into his dom and show him the correct way.
“Sir, I found a film. It shows your brother. I watched it. I am not sure you should. I am already tracing IP and we are on it.” His eyes darkened.
“Could we perhaps have a new table in the kitchen to have breakfast? This is too large and too cold for me.” Greg asked while taking things from the buffet.
He was convinced now that his submissive would behave perfectly tomorrow and he dished out a reward.
Sherlock, surprised, opens his eyes to look at John. John, up on his toes, plants a soft kiss on Sherlock's lips. John hooks his thumb in Sherlock's waistband and tugs him closer.
Sherlock pulls the dildo almost all the way out and then pushes it back in John's hole a little deeper. John moans in response. Sherlock continues this, pulling it nearly all the way out and pushing it in a fraction of an inch deeper each time.
All right, all right. A year from the start of the relationship, Sherlock. But you are being ridiculous setting a deadline --
make it feel sort of like a date to Sherlock. He found himself getting a little jumpy, but he hoped his nervous excitement could be channeled into helping him get through the twin objectives of the night: solving the night club's little mystery
Yeah, I'll need to let you finish washing up on your own because apparently I can't even bloody touch you in the shower without going rigid.
All the same, I like the balance Gregory provides in my life. I just don't know what I give him in return.
John carries a chair over to the bookshelf. He steps on the chair and retrieves Sherlock’s shopping bag full of sex toys from the shelf. He shakes the bag and peers into it. He looks at the clock on the mantle and purses his lips in thought.
Could we see how much damage the lotion does first before we fight over who gets to take down drug lords, please?
John hands Sherlock the shirt. Sherlock, frowning, swipes it out of his hands and puts it on in a huff. John returns to the dresser.
Sherlock immediately cuddles up right next to John. Sherlock's head is on John's shoulder and his arm is thrown around John.
Clearly, we don't need to go slow for your benefit... apparently, I'M the one that needs us to go slow.
Imagining Sherlock peppering the clerks at the sex shop with a bazillion questions while making his purchases makes me giggle.
I've detected a pattern with divorced and widowed folks like John. They tend to be more than a little gun shy about falling in love again after being hurt once before.
They would have to call the emergency list then... half of Scotland Yard's on it now, so I think she'd be in good hands, don't you?
We know our Cambodian student isn't working alone. She carries out the thefts... but someone else is fencing the stolen art ...  but who? The roommate, you say? None of the missing art pieces have surfaced yet, but it's just a matter of time. Somebody is going be too excited by their new acquisition to keep mum. We'll have a leak by the end of the month, I'm sure.
Great work on the uni-student-art-fencing case! I don't know how you figured out that her roommate was involved, but it was a stroke of genius! The roommate's extended family was completely behind the whole thing. We think the court system will go easy on the Cambodian girl... seems like she was in fact coerced, as you suspected. Excellent job, you two!
Sherlock smiled brightly at the scattered dancers collecting under the disco ball, pouring on the charm. A gleeful trio of young men pulled him into their dancing group, and he shimmied along with them briefly before excusing himself gracefully. He exchanged smiles and barely-audible pleasantries with more club goers as he made his way around the noisy dance floor, while covertly watching John in the meantime. He was happy to note that John was keeping a keen watch on his antics. When Sherlock made it back to the booth, a little out of breath, John pulled a face.
Sherlock... I'm sorry. I have to go faster and harder now. I don't want to hurt you. I am going to pull out.
Sherlock reaches into his coat and pulls out a small case. He hands it to John who begins opening it without a word. Irene watches everything with fascination. Sherlock dons exam gloves. Using tweezers, John hands Sherlock small pieces of clear film and Sherlock presses them gently onto the fingerprints.
Good. I just wanted to hear you say it. Last time I checked... back at the powerplant... you weren't too keen on the concept of being "a couple", remember?
Great! I need to head downstairs to the lab... if I can just pinpoint the exact type of tea in those tea stains... won't be but an hour, ta!
Sherlock's already flushed face flushes a shade darker. John eases into Sherlock a little further. Sherlock hums with pleasure. John watches Sherlock's face for signs.
He spies a body lying on the floor in the middle of the sitting room and hurries over. It's Sherlock sprawled out on the floor, with the Union Jack cushion under his head and the tartan throw from John's chair being used as a blanket. John bends down swiftly to check Sherlock's pulse and breathing, but Sherlock saves him the trouble by snoring loudly. John stands up again, relieved that Sherlock is only sleeping, but rubs his face and glances away in exasperation.
John and Sherlock stand on the side of the playground, watching Rosie playing in the sand pit. Mycroft jogs up to them.
My brother was there and was none too pleased. Kept shoving a stack of clothes in my face yelling, "Sherlock Holmes! Put on your trousers!"
Now, now, Mycroft. You've been recently dumped. You're allowed chips. It's about the only perk. Come.
Can't even properly mind palace anymore... have to settle for semi mind-palacing, which is not nearly sufficient enough...
You and John have a past. A long, long past. And it is apparent to me that you’ve had to be as patient with him as he has been with you throughout your relationship.
John walks over to snap the baby monitor off and exits in a hurry.  Sherlock paces, anxious, as he listens for John's heavy tread on the stairs. He walks over and switches the baby monitor back on and sits on the corner of the bed. Rosie's wails fill the room again.
Oh, no. I'm so sorry to hear. I've seen him try to manipulate situations for his own benefit before... I didn't realize he'd do that to you, too. John, that's not good.
- The group of four eat and chat around the kitchen table in 221B. Takeaway containers are staggered across the tabletop.
Mycroft takes another sip of tea and makes a mental note to be the one who chooses the coffee shop next time, one without a television.
John glowers at her and Irene grins a bit evilly back at him. Sherlock sighs with irritation but continues to work, sniffing and searching.
"You're welcome. Now go on. He's waiting for you," she said with a wink. Sherlock's heart started pounding in his chest, and continued as he headed back up the stairs. He entered the sitting room to find John hanging up their coats and dimming a few lights. He really did look good in his black shirt and indigo jeans.
So, off to lunch, I see? A lovely lunch date. Not afraid to be tipping your hand with your new friend Molly, hmmm?
But this is just a very small packet. Yours is much, much bigger, Eurus. Let's be reasonable about this.
Sherlock stands on a stool changing an overhead light bulb (finally - it's been burnt out for ages!). Mrs. Hudson sits at her kitchen table, supervising and having tea.
Molly Hooper, I come to you for advice because you know me so well. And I have the utmost respect for your opinions and very good judgment, particularly in these sorts of matters.
As Sherlock finishes cleaning, he glances up and sees John's expression, although he can't quite figure it out. John gives him a reassuring smile.
Well, here you are! Audrey, how lovely of you to bring dinner, so thoughtful! Come with me, let's pop it in the oven. And Rosie, I bet you'll be wanting dinner. Come dear, I know exactly what you like.
Keeping up the flirtation and dancing while extracting information from people was exhausting, but Sherlock persevered. He found he also had to keep an eye on the bar too, as John was doing a piss-poor job of attending to his stakeout duties, choosing instead to follow Sherlock's every move like a hawk. Nevertheless, Sherlock had succeeded in sussing out some of the regulars, had been offered ecstasy three times and was propositioned twice, and was quite ready for refreshment by the time he made it back to the booth. Still, he managed to grab a muscly bloke playfully by the arm and complimented him on his mesh shirt right before John's eyes. The man ran a hand down Sherlock's sleeve and told him he had nice eyes. Sherlock smiled and turned away coquettishly as smoke nearly poured forth from John Watson's ears. Sherlock flopped down in the booth, poured himself a much-needed glass of water and guzzled it down. John stared into his own empty drink with grumpy knitted
“This is all my fault. I should have known better. Sherlock would never break contact completely. He would at least call to mock me or provoke me. But he did nothing of the sort. Nothing!” Now he was angry. He was going through the motions and Greg simply heard him out.
“Dinner is about to be delivered. Would you like a drink? Let’s sit down by the fire.” Sherlock was excited and it made John smile.
“I remember telling you I needed time to adjust.” Then John touched his neck as if to scratch it. His fingers took hold of the collar and his eyes widened.
“No, don’t touch me!” He shouted and stood on swaying legs looking at John who stood absolutely still. Sherlock had never done such a thing. He slowly straightened up, too.
Sherlock kept himself busy with his blog and waited for John to come back to him. He knew it would take longer because he wasn’t a quick reader. In addition, he was mulling everything over because this was very serious to him.
John didn’t move but used the ropes to force Sherlock onto his cock. Soon he started to scream but it sounded just fine.
Greg and Sherlock sat in the back of one car and Ian hugged him before they left. Sherlock was both sad and scared. Both cars raced away. They drove over the country-roads.
“Come down and talk to him after Sherlock is done over there.” Both men looked over and saw that they had stopped communicating. Right now, Sherlock was tilting his head and Mycroft acknowledged the hint by looking at Greg. He inhaled and moved up.
John let him come several times and stopped when he wasn't leaking anymore. He had fucked him slowly and almost tenderly. He had even kissed him and Sherlock melted into the bedding.
“Stop this right now!” He hissed and John at once pulled his hair again. It was nice hair, curly and dark, soft, and smooth.
Greg needed a bit longer than expected and Sherlock was busy with the fourth folder when he returned.
Sherlock didn't know how long he had been sitting there when it knocked on the door. His head came up and he stood. This must be Ian and he was right. He opened the door for him and they entered the kitchen. Ian looked at him.
“Excuse me?” Mrs Hudson exclaimed. Sherlock shrugged and swallowed the pastry. He took another napkin and drank his tea.
“You are all blotchy. Let me help you.” John stood and found a washcloth. He soaked it in cold water and wiped Sherlock’s face. Then he brought tissues and made him blow his nose several times.
“I think this could be a solution for your injuries. It won't put too much strain on them.” He held it out for John to take but his face hardened. It softened soon enough.
“No, I prefer mushy eggs.” He replied. Ian devoured his croissant and stood. Sherlock looked alarmed and wanted to get up, too. But Ian held out his hand.
“As you wish.” Sherlock left and Mycroft and Greg stood and watched the car disappear around the corner. They looked at each other and closed the door.
“Yes, Master. Thank you, Master.” Sherlock was actually hungry but at first drank coffee. He also drank the orange juice. It made him feel a lot better.
“Yes, that's it. You should know he won't come to his senses. He won't admit having done something wrong. It's because he doesn't understand.” He poured himself more coffee.
“I know. He told me already. I am sure though that his cock will find the way.” Sherlock said and it made Greg laugh loudly.
The first waves rode through his dick and it was almost nice. Soon enough though they became stronger and hence mean and painful. The pulsing and throbbing was unbearable and Sherlock wailed. It didn't stop; his dom tormented him without a break. He tortured him until he was a whimpering mess hanging from the cross.
“Well, you made sure it mostly ended up badly for me.” John smiled when saying the words. Sherlock nonchalantly shrugged.
He stopped on top of the stairs and looked down. It seemed like a mountain to him and he was afraid of falling down. But he had no choice. He needed water and food. He needed his dom.
He danced with his dom who held him in a tight grip. He slipped the plastic into his suit. John grinned and lightly bit into his jaw.
“Yes, the connection is secured and we can watch her over our telly. You can watch her break, John!” John came into his pants right away.
He turned away and walked into the kitchen. He prepared the soup and let it simmer. Then he sat down on a chair and cried his heart out. He didn't understand his dom's behaviour. He only meant well.
“Get out.” Sherlock quickly folded his body out and became a bit dizzy. John snatched his wrist and pulled him along. They entered through a door after having passed several others. It looked like a doctor's waiting room. And there were many dom's with their subs. They were all naked and kneeling on the ground.
He listened to the noises John produced and became hungrier by the minute. Finally, he gave in and stood. He needed to clean up before he ate. He also needed the loo again.
“Leave that to me, Sherlock. I would like you to wait in my private rooms.” Sherlock simply followed him and sat down in an armchair. There were cigarettes on the small table by his side and the bar was close, too.
“I had a look at his file. He has been sent home invalided. He is a cripple, Sherlock. He is limping and his hand is trembling. Even if he was a fantastic marksman and fighter, this time is over.”
Mycroft. He smiled dreamily and slowly opened his eyes to see what the warm thing in front of him was. And then he stared at a sleeping John who was resting against his chest. Right behind John was Sherlock and their eyes met. Then he was also in his head.
John’s grip tightened and it made Sherlock groan in response. He let go for a second and looked up. Their eyes met and Sherlock tilted his head questioningly.
They entered his office and Mycroft poured him a drink and made him sit on an armchair. Greg sunk deeply into the thing and watched him.
When he was back, he got up on his elbows and looked at Sherlock who knelt by his side carefully stroking over his chest and belly. He was still panting.
God, look at you Sherlock. You look stunning with the water cascading down your body like this... you fucking yourself on my hands.
Just as you did, we'll begin in the kitchen. You, in the buff, on your back, splayed out for me on the kitchen table. Those long limbs of yours reaching out wide. Are you with me so far, Sherlock?
Watch it Sherlock! You can't go yanking those things out so quickly. If you don't go more carefully, it’s going to be Vatican Cameos. Do you understand?
“I went shopping with Lestrade and talked to my brother. They will meet tonight. Lestrade is going to bake a cake for him and then they will have sex.” John choked on his tea.
“Indeed.” He handed over a decently filled tumbler and Greg sighed happily. They drank and didn't speak until their light dinner was ready. It got served in here, as well. Greg was thankful for it.
”Really? How amusing!” Mycroft quietly laughed and Sherlock grounded his teeth. He also looked out for John who was still talking to several women who seemed to need a doctor.
Sherlock was thankful and he did thank him. He was good. He behaved perfectly. But he also knew that another film was in order. He knew he couldn't prevent it. He just had to let it happen to avoid more pain than necessary. He didn't want to die. He wasn't yet desperate enough and he still loved his dom.
“I am glad you found me and let me live with you. I feel like chosen. I feel like I am important, worthy, and liked again. Loved.” John sighed and looked up again. Sherlock just sat there and looked at him. His lips were slightly apart and his eyes were wet.
“I never dommed someone inside my place. This was the first time I felt like it. It must be you, John. You are giving me certain feelings I still need to process.” John smiled. Then he stopped smiling.
“Well, well. I gave you a lot of time to think about your behaviour. Do you think you could be good for me again?” He asked. John desperately nodded.
“Ask away as long as you can, John. We will be using the colours, by the way. You OK with that?” John looked up and swallowed. It was exactly what he had wanted to ask. He had wanted to ask for a safeword.
Now he stood in their kitchen and stirred the dough for the pancakes. He had made more than usual because he wanted some, too.
He chased him for a good while to have some fun. He chased him until Sherlock wasn't able to run anymore. He only crawled over the earthy soil and panted roughly. John wondered about the fight still left in him and admired him a little bit. Of course, he would beat the fight out of him soon enough.
„No, just let me explain.“ And explain he did. It was easier now that he had already talked to Greg. There weren't too many tears but Sherlock was shocked anyway.
“He still is very confused. He hasn't yet fully understood, I am afraid. If you agree I will talk to him after you have left.”
“What else would help?” John asked. Sherlock tilted his head. Then he smirked. The expression on his face made John swallow.
“Mycroft!” He exclaimed looking at his older sibling who carried many bags from different shops. He dropped them all on the living room floor and helplessly looked at him.
“Whatever.” Mycroft saw that Greg needed him close now and he led him into the library. He knew Greg loved the place, loved to sit by the fire. They settled on a fur right there and he felt him relax.
“No, he was just worried. He normally never gets furious. At least privately. It’s different on crime scenes when I am around.” Sherlock pulled a face.
“You can either use the remote or you have to start before you climb inside. Right over your head.” Now John turned his head and saw the panel that almost disappeared between all the stainless-steel wheels and handles and whatnot.
“He only told me about a brother in the government but we never talked about it since then. Too much happened.”
“You should know something, too. I waited for you to come out for a long time. I could see and feel your attraction. I want you badly, Sherlock.”
“Yes?” They grinned at each other. John stood and got the next round. When he placed the pints on their table, he looked at Greg.
“I was told you were rather successful back then. That’s why I am trusting you, too. I trust you anyway.” Greg looked at his slim body and smiled.
Sherlock devoured the provided food his brother had sent. There even was chocolate for dessert. Obviously, his brother tried to pamper him or even bribe him. Sherlock wasn’t sure. But probably Mycroft wanted more intel on Lestrade.
It surely wasn't love or anything the like. But he was impressed by what he had done yesterday. He was an intelligent being and could be extremely useful. He decided to treat it a bit better from now on.
“I will be right with you.” Sherlock turned and simply shed the towel. Greg shook his head but didn't correct him. If he wanted to shed the towel where he stood, he was free to do so.
“There you are. Cut them off.” Greg urged him and Sherlock sat down and did just that. He wasn't shy in front of Greg. He had been naked for so long around both his dom and others, he didn't mind. That's why he simply shed his trousers and climbed into the shorts.
Suddenly it started and it wasn't a paddle. He could have borne the paddle; even the flogger. But this was a bull-whip that crashed down on his back and he screamed. The pain was extreme and he got whipped without a break.
Mycroft opened his mouth but didn’t utter a single word. Carefully, Greg reached out and stroked over his cheekbone.
Now Sherlock had a look outside. John followed close and they saw several guards surrounding two people on the ground. Cars were approaching and several bodies were loaded inside.
John dropped the ropes and took his hands pulling him into his arms. He held him tight and stroked his thumbs over his thin wrists.
“Hush, please. You can do whatever you like. I am glad you let me see.” Ian turned his head and his nose moved over Sherlock's temple and through the hair.
“I can see what you are, DI Lestrade. And I am slightly worried about Mycroft and Sherlock. So please talk to me!” Dr Kim's voice had hardened and only now Greg understood. Dr Kim was asking because he knew he was a dom.
“Since this is your home, you should do just so.” Mycroft said and Greg wondered if he still liked the idea of living with him when he saw what Greg would bring into the mix.
“John?” He called because he couldn’t see him but he could hear the radio playing. He walked into their kitchen where he found John leaning against the counter just lowering his mobile. Their eyes met and Sherlock at once saw he was upset. He looked questioningly at him but he wouldn’t talk. Sherlock felt the urgent need for something to drink. Something stronger than tea. Then he heard John whisper:
He checked the time and informed security about him leaving. They were trustworthy, very much so. Even though, he wanted to drive himself. They would follow in another car and wait outside. There had been a discussion about him going alone into her place but he made himself abundantly clear.
“Come on. We can have lunch together but then I have to get back to work.” Sherlock relaxed and quickly followed his Master downstairs.
John shouted roughly and came deep down. His legs trembled while Sherlock licked him clean and finally let go of him. He didn’t sit on his heels, he kept kneeling straight up. John looked down and saw Sherlock’s cock under his pyjamas. He dropped on his own knees and carefully pulled down the hem. Sherlock was panting.
“I'll be right back.” He needed tools to get the restraining items off of Sherlock. They needed a small welding machine. Or a laser. And he had seen one on the soldier carrying the tablet and all the other techy stuff.
“He was taken directly into Baskerville. He was secured in a cell deep down below the ground. He is not allowed to interact with others. Let it be guards or other prisoners. He tried to fight his way out on the way but was overpowered. As soon as Sherlock is a bit better, I will go and interrogate him myself.” Greg hummed.
“Come. Lay over here.” Sherlock slowly stood and placed his body over John’s lap. His cock dangled between his legs and John hooked his leg over Sherlock’s, so he wasn’t able to kick around. Sherlock’s head hung low and he drooled around the gag. John stroked him with the brush and Sherlock tried to estimate the first hit. But when John struck down, he was surprised and bit into the gag. When John was done, Sherlock cried. John kneaded his cheeks and brought him back down on his knees between his legs. He placed his fingers under his chin and lifted his head. Snot and saliva already dried on Sherlock’s face.
“I thought about my bedroom. We were having sex in there anyway and it is the most comfortable room.”
When he arrived back at Baker Street, there was a black sedan parked at the curb. And it wasn’t Mycroft’s. John walked faster and hurried upstairs. He dashed into the flat only to see Sherlock talking with Moran.
Now he took extra care of his hair and skin. He knew his hairdryer was outside and he simply slung a towel around his slim waist. He moved into the pair of slippers that the place provided and padded outside. John obviously hadn’t used his because they sat still wrapped in the small basket. Probably he thought if he tore the package open, he would have to pay for them. Sherlock snorted.
“I could help you find them. You could return to your former life if you so wish.” Sherlock sipped his drink.
Upstairs Sherlock sat on the sofa while John prepared a snack for him and poured drinks. When he came back, he found him fast asleep. He had fallen on his side and snored quietly. He was actually drooling and John took a picture to blackmail him later.
Greg's eyes were huge and he finally sat down rubbing over his tired eyes. His eyes rested on the DVD.
“He is falling back into old patterns. Perhaps the idea of moving back into Baker Street wasn't such a good one after all. It must have been too early.” He left the door open, picked up his clothes, and took care of the bedding. He stuffed everything into a plastic bag and threw it outside. He needed a washing machine.
“Come to bed and hold me.” Sherlock smiled and spooned John. He had read about it and seen it on TV. John obviously liked it because he purred like an animal, a strong animal. He held on to Sherlock’s arm and buried his head into the pillow. Soon after he completely relaxed and fell asleep in Sherlock’s arms who listened to his heartbeat, strong and steady.
“That insane little man! You should do something about him. Or tell your wicked brother!” Then she left and stomped down the stairs. Sherlock smiled after her.
“There you are. Now please, do your wonders. I am achingly hard and I want to fucking remember something while I miss you.” Sherlock gaped.
“I think you are deserving a reward. Think of how to stop me if needed.” There wasn't any reaction until Sergej lifted him up a bit more. He used lube over his hole and also slicked up a plug. He pulled his cheeks apart and moved the plug between them.
“I will brew more coffee, Myc.” He grabbed the thermos and left for the kitchen. Both men looked but didn't stop him.
“It is allowed to look around.” He said and dropped the leash. Sherlock slowly got up and knelt straight. He indeed looked. It was wonderful. He never wanted to leave again. Carefully he moved his fingertips over the duvet and sheets.
John sat in bed leaning against the headrest and watched him getting close. He tilted his head. Sherlock thought he had done something wrong and didn't move. But suddenly a smile came up on his dom's face and he slowly relaxed.
“Yes, John.” They stood and John led him into the library. The room where Sherlock had been first brought when he arrived in his household. But now he was walking with his Master. He wasn't crawling on a leash.
“Mate …” John sighed and looked up at him. He saw him lick his lips and he also saw his teeth poking through. His finger came up and moved over his lips.
“You don’t have to excuse yourself for your job. It’s all fine. You came. You were here. You spent time with me. We had wonderful sex. Everything is simply perfect.” Greg smiled.
John paid the delivery-guy and carried everything into the kitchen. He saw Sherlock had ordered Indian. And somehow, he had managed to order all his favourites. He raised a brow. So he could read his thoughts, it seemed.
“Now you look like a bug struggling to get on its legs again. And you should try it because I won't help you.” John stepped over him and left the playroom. He could watch his struggles later because the camera also recorded.
“Thanks a lot but no. I’ll take the tube and get food on the way.” Mycroft reached into his pocket and handed over a card.
„I will make a list then?“ He suggested and John nodded. After half an hour they had a plan. They knew everything they needed was provided in the playroom.
Time passed quickly and when he got nudged by John, he tore his eyes open. Instantly, there was the extreme urge to pee. He groaned and shifted. John pulled his head back and pulled the gag out.
“I'd like you to do something for me. And Sherlock.” Mycroft said after several seconds. Greg looked up.
“Let's head for the boat.” John texted these to another friend to pick up the weapons close by. Then they threw the mobile away. They had already changed into the clothes Greg had stolen. They left their old ones behind.
When Sherlock stepped out of the bath and into his bedroom, he found John fast asleep. He had hoped for some kissing and groping but he also understood that John needed to rest. He was a fragile human being and Sherlock let him rest.
“It was beautiful. Moreover, I did something I have never done before. I let you tie me up and I desperately wanted, needed, to suck your cock. I was in bloody heaven! Right after, I felt like floating. The pain in my nipples, the constant pull made the pain rise and fall as well as the ropes everywhere, your fingers pulling my hair. Just fucking everything! You were perfect! If I had only known before…” He shook his head.
“What is it? What did you find?” She asked but he just imperiously held out his free hand. She knew him well enough to know what he wanted and handed him the wrapped-up metal which had stuck inside the body. Sherlock snatched it and held it close to his eyes. They slanted after a few seconds.
“What are you thinking about, pet? You are far away!” John poked into his stomach and Sherlock was back.
It didn't take long and the cramps started. It always was a horrid business but this time Sherlock didn't fight it anymore. He relaxed and filled the diaper moving his behind over the mattress. His head moved from side to side while he cried and looked up from time to time to find the red dot again.
John moved to the wall and pulled him against his chest. He took the duvet and got both their bodies beneath it. Sherlock’s longish hair tickled his chest and he gently touched his naked body. There wasn’t any reaction and John sighed. He closed his eyes holding on to Sherlock.
He was aware of the silk around his ankles and wrists as well as the blindfold. He was very aware of John close by. At some point, he must have fallen asleep.
“I have some files here I want you to go through. I need your opinion on how to best approach and bribe these people. They are in the way right now, you see?” Sherlock nodded and took the first documents.
“No, this is my place. Inside, there are several rooms for different scenes. I even made up the dungeon.” Sherlock swallowed.
By now, he could smell the food. John was cooking pasta. He smelled cheese and fried mushrooms as well as alcohol for the sauce. He licked his lips. This would be a fantastic dinner.
The man had seen a lot and he simply ignored the half-naked man on the toilet. Instead he just knelt down in front of him again and gently took one of his feet on his thigh. Greg held Sherlock’s hand while Mycroft had his palm on his shoulder.
“Forgive me, DCI Lestrade. I didn't mean to mock you. I came here for your help.” Greg leant forward.
John just looked at him. This was so unbelievingly thoughtful of him. His eyes were wide open and he just stared.
„Naughty!“ John shook his head and made him stand. He used padded cuffs on his wrists and ankles and used ropes to connect them. Sherlock was chest down on the bed afterwards and panted already. Very carefully he moved his hips but John smacked his behind.
But now Ian offered to do things with him. And he trusted Ian. He was a good man and had proved that again and again. His brother had checked him out and approved of him.
He slowly exhaled and closed his eyes. He had feelings for the man. Firstly, he adored him. He was good looking and intelligent. The fact, he was a submissive wasn't important. Secondly, he wanted to show him he could live his life as he wanted even when he was in a d/s relationship.
“Please do so.” Greg called after him. He chose his favourite Chinese and placed their order. He knew what Sherlock liked and ordered a lot of everything. They could freeze the left-overs even though he knew he had to hide that from both cook and Mycroft. He smirked.
“Well, well.” He sank on his knees, too, moving to Sherlock’s side. He forced his head back fisting into his hair and his free hand pressed his prick down. Sherlock let out a suppressed shout.
Mycroft wasn't able to utter a single word. He just couldn't. He didn't want to shout at his brother.
“Are you telling me you need help, so you won't pee on the hardwood?” John nodded. But what happened next wasn't what he thought of. Sherlock retrieved a diaper. John's eyes widened and he shook his head making noises. He moved back.
“What do you have in mind, pet?” Sherlock scratched over his groin feeling John’s cock twitch. He grinned. John gasped but still didn’t move.
“Of course, I want to take him home with me! What do you think, Gregory?” Ian raised a brow and smiled.
“Yes, Master! Please, let me come again! Master, please...” He sobbed it out and couldn't believe it when John stroked his cock. He felt him grow inside again and his prostate was teased another time.
There was silence in the room and Greg's hopes went poof. But he stayed on his knee and kept looking at him.
Later that day, John actually met Mycroft Holmes who had invited him into his office in Whitehall. John had been led upstairs and at first, met Anthea behind her desk.
“I am glad to hear that.” Sherlock relaxed and rolled on his side with the blanket up. “Come to bed?” He asked already yawning. John happily complied and moved under the blanket with him. He liked it when Sherlock put his long arm around him and let him sleep beneath it, under his shoulder where he could press his nose against his soft, warm skin. It made sure he’d have no nightmares at all.
Sherlock watched him with a slightly open mouth. His long fingers were curled around the stem of the wine glass.
“Listen, this is sort of complicated to explain. I am endangering myself here but Sherlock has become my friend and I really want to help him.” Ian looked serious and relaxed into his chair.
“Yes, really.” Sherlock’s fingers twitched and John knew he was still feeling guilty. This wasn't good.
He opened the door and looked. Sherlock was fast asleep in their bed. He was on his side facing the other wall. He was completely engulfed in his blanket and only his hair showed.
“I am back, slut. Aren't you happy to see me?” John asked stepping closer so Sherlock could see him. He looked desperate and tried to mumble a reply from behind the gag. John raised a brow.
“I can see your erection. If you dare to come before I allow it or if you piss on the blanket, I am telling you, you won’t like the outcome. Behave! It’s just transport, you know?” John smirked and Sherlock’s eyes darkened.
“Do not do this again or you will lose him.” Greg said before he left and closed the door. John slumped in his chair and closed his eyes.
The emotions ran through Sherlock and his guts coiled. This was all new. New emotions and new feelings. He had to sort through them and he had no idea how.
“Tell me then.” John’s earlobes were a bit red and a rosy blush was on his cheeks but he cleared his throat and started to talk.
“If you haven’t stopped any of his businesses or angered him, then why does he want to kill you?” Greg asked.
He sighed and finished his coffee. He binned the mug and kept walking. He passed his brother's security and the butler sent him straight into Mycroft's office.
Sherlock watched John slowly falling down onto his side. He didn't move when he nudged him. Then he knelt by his side shaking him by the shoulder.
He jerked and screamed again when someone touched his cock and stroked it after he was done pissing. His body betrayed him, pleasure overtook pain and his erection grew. Now he blushed.
“I don’t know how to say it without insulting you but you are smelly.” Sherlock thought about the livestock, the fighting male he had killed. Did the fear and pain have an impact on his blood and did John smell that? Another thing he had to ask Mycroft.
“Fuck …” Suddenly his pants felt really tight. He had always wondered about these things but never really tried. He surely had fantasies but never lived them out. Except for one time at university. This he won't ever forget. But the girl had left and he never found someone like her again. Someone he could trust with this. Someone who shared his secret desires.
“Grab Sherlock. Now. We are moving.” Greg threw off the duvet and pulled Sherlock up. He moved about a bit and murmured quietly. He grabbed him and had him over his shoulder in seconds. His hands brushed over his bum and his hair was moving with Greg's walking. John walked behind them watching it. He had no idea where to go and how they could escape Mycroft's surveillance.
Ian grounded his teeth but sat down, too. They ate in silence and Ian knew something was very, very wrong. But he also knew it would be hard to pry Sherlock away from John's side.
“No. Actually, I felt rather, rather angry, because I needed to work by your side. I wanted to watch over you after yesterday, take better care of you.” Greg hugged him tightly.
John licked his lips. He was hard and erect but hadn’t come. He hadn’t touched his prick and hadn’t rutted against him. He had only given him pleasure.
All the time Sherlock’s eyes expectantly followed him through the flat. John though didn’t do anything and Sherlock wondered how on earth John would achieve to not get him bored.
John was behind him and took his wrists. He tied them tightly on his lower back. He also tied his upper arms and ran the rope over his chest and below his nipples. It went over his shoulders, too.
“Hush…” He whispered repeatedly until he felt him calm. He didn’t hug him back. He was sitting stiffly but suddenly he moved back and stood. He turned away and stormed outside.
John kept pressing and his finger disappeared inside Sherlock's hole. He quickly looked up and saw his eyes widen but he didn’t seem to be in pain. He kept going and looked for his prostate. And since he was a doctor, he found it very quickly. He rubbed over it and pressed down until Sherlock shouted and kicked his legs.
The following day John went rather easy on Sherlock. He had him kneel naked by his armchair and talked to him.
“Are you ready to come?” That would be the final loss of control. Mycroft shook his head and sobbed once.
“Dr Watson, we need to check your head one more time. If the result shows nothing serious you are free to go.” It was Dr Marlov speaking and Sherlock pulled a face.
He straightened up and took his coat from the back of the door. He switched off the light and left 221B. He walked the streets for a while until he ended up on top of a roof overlooking his city.
He was convinced that John Watson was a very good teacher. He had taught him good behaviour already. He would be able to teach him how the sex worked, too. He wasn’t stupid, was he?
“No, no, please don't stop! Don't!” Mycroft just got more lube and shoved three fingers into him the next second.
His eyes shot up and met Greg's who had just entered the room carrying a tray with food. At once he sensed the mood in here and put up a huge grin.
“I also never watched a film like this.” He hooked his finger behind the collar and pulled him closer kissing him. John hummed and when Sherlock let go again, he licked his lips asking:
“You won’t have to because I am going to ask him. But just for threatening me, I will punish you later. You may look forward to something.” Sherlock stood and got into his coat. He leant over John and kissed him.
Sherlock liked to look at John when he was so completely concentrated on a task. Mainly a task he couldn’t deal with very well.
“Will do. See you soon, Mycroft.” They shook hands and John left. Anthea shot him another grin on the way out which he returned.
John was handed a riding-crop and once hit the air. Sherlock knew what was expected and fell into presenting mode again.
Sherlock was aroused. He felt hot and he was also hard again. He had never ever experienced something like this. He had never been interested in someone like this. Not until John Watson had appeared and stepped into his life.
“Yes, Master.” Then Sherlock got surprised. John just pulled up the duvet and rolled on his side facing him. Sherlock had no idea what was expected of him now. They locked eyes and John whispered:
But today was different and Sherlock almost felt giddy. He carefully looked around when the car stopped in front of a bleak concrete building. There were signs showing the names of different businesses.
“I need to work now. It will stay outside for a bit. Perhaps the rain will wash away the dirt. Someone will pick it up later.” John left and Sherlock’s eyes followed him. Only when he was gone, he closed his eyes and allowed his body to relax. He leant against the fence because he was a horse and wasn’t supposed to rest on the ground. At the slave agency, he had been told that horses resting on the ground were shot.
“You are stupid, John. But you have to admit he is good looking. But always remember who is here in my arms.” John pressed his face against Sherlock’s shirt.
“Don’t move…” John whispered and moved between his legs. He sucked one testicle into his mouth and Sherlock made a very undignified noise. Sherlock’s cock pressed against John’s face and rubbed over it. Soon the tender skin was red and a bit rough because John had two-days stubble on his face.
“Hey, love. I am glad you are home.” He quietly said and approached him. Sherlock looked up and spread his arms wide open.
“There is no reason to be sorry for. Admittedly, I was surprised when waking up but very positively. It showed, deep down, you trust me. You came to me and it made me happy. I woke a happy man this morning.”
Since he couldn’t afford a cab, he rode the tube to Baker Street. The weather wasn’t nice and his leg bothered him so he walked slowly with the help of his cane and even strides favouring his good leg. Right when he turned up in front of the door of 221B a cab stopped behind him with Sherlock just leaving it. John waited for him and Sherlock held out his hand. John took it. He still had his gloves on and felt pretty cold.
“Anyway, this is the camera in front of the asylum. We can watch Anthea's rescue attempt live.” They leant back in their chairs and watched.
“Sherlock, it's me, Greg. Please, come down again. You are back home. You are safe.” His voice was low and soft and he carefully reached out for him.
Sherlock had been surprised when the intruder came into his flat. He had fought him, of course, he had. He wasn't helpless. But that man was very skilled, probably an assassin. Sherlock had ended up throwing things at him but he only laughed. He had finally fled up into John's room because the impulse to be protected was strong.
“I am done with the studio. Now I will explain what I expect from you when your appointment comes to see you tomorrow. Listen to me, bitch!” Sherlock's eyes were glued to his dom's face.
John gave him a heavy push and he yelled the house down. It came out rather muffled from behind the ballgag and John grinned rubbing his hands. He once checked for crossed fingers but found nothing.
“Here, blow your nose and sit. I’ll get you a coffee.” Sherlock sat and watched John. He carefully sipped the hot fluid and handed the mug back.
“I believe your work here is done, Greg. Thanks for dinner. You may return to my brother now who will be extremely curious about this. You may tell him. Have fun!” Sherlock grinned and made Greg blush.
“Obviously that is not the truth. Talk to me, slut. Perhaps I can make it better?” John smirked and Sherlock looked at John’s hand which still held his tee.
John pushed back into his mouth and he lightly swung. The ropes pulled at his testicles and cock and he groaned. The sound made John’s cock vibrate and he groaned, too. He grabbed several lengths of hair and again pushed into him. He held him into position, so he wouldn’t injure his cock and balls. He stuck into his throat and came down that long white neck. Tears ran over his face and when he was done, he pulled out and made him clean it.
“Sherlock, before we sit down for breakfast, would you please remove the chain?” Greg quietly asked. At once his fingers reached up and took a hold. He swallowed and then he panted.
“You are desperate. I can clearly see it. You need this. You need to be shown your place. You like to be hurt. And I will hurt you. You will beg me to let you come but will I let you? I am not sure yet. It depends solely on your behaviour. I can only advise behaving at your very best.” Greg wildly nodded and saliva kept flowing.
John closed his eyes after half an hour. He felt himself leak into his pants and swore quietly. He wasn’t very comfortable and he tried to shove Sherlock away and off but he wouldn’t budge. Then John just threw his body on the side. Unfortunately, it was the wrong side and Sherlock’s nose was almost touching his still covered cock. He bit his lip and stayed put.
“He will need professional help after all what that insane man did to him.” His eyes moved over to the DVD that still sat on the coffee table.
John pulled the straightjacket out of the bag and shook it out. It was black and leather. Sherlock swallowed. It was beautiful. At once he pulled his shirt off and threw it aside. He stretched out his arms and John moved it up and over his shoulders.
Later that day John left for his shift at the A&E again. Sherlock stayed at home. John took the blood from Greg and sent him home again. He seemed to be all good but he wanted to be sure. He pocketed the blood and walked home, too. Sherlock wasn't there but John wasn't worried. He was probably stocking up his blood supplies or whatever he was up to.
“What’s that?” John moved closer and held out his hand. Sherlock put the magnifying glass into it and he looked through it. Then he hummed, too, and passed it on to Greg. Sherlock raised a brow but didn’t utter a single word.
“Yes, you may …” John straddled him and used the belt to lift up his head. His cock bopped in front of his lips and Sherlock just opened up. He knew perfectly well that he wasn’t in the best position to give head but he would try. He was able to smell him, his arousal.
“Pray tell what you want. I am out of my depth already.” Mycroft poured a whiskey and only when Greg cleared his throat, he handed a tumbler over to him, too.
“No, he scared me to death at first. But my brain stopped swirling, Myc. I only ever achieved that state with drugs.”
“What else did you buy?” He looked over his shoulder and John could smell him. He closed his eyes for a second. His spine was tingling and he hoped he would get his body back under control.
“Stop fidgeting, slut.” His voice was dangerous and Sherlock stood still. A minute later John looked at him again.
“But it’s so much fun seeing him in pain when I torture you. It’s much better than hurting him directly. He would endure everything for you. And that would be so boring for me. Instead hurting you directly is much more fun. Watching him suffer and making him dance.” He giggled insanely and John watched him leave.
He knew he looked perfect. He had a beautiful physique, was finely muscled, and had a six-pack. He knew this was important. That was why he had secretly trained. Not that he had looked bad before. Now though he was simply perfect.
“Yes, I have, haven’t I? You needed a quick orgasm. It was the best way. And you are not the only one who can do such things, you know?” John grinned. Sherlock slanted his eyes.
“It has been awkward at the beginning. I didn’t know what to do or how to act. Where to sit or where to go. Gregory though had everything under control thanks to his experiences with you, I believe.”
“I am happy, too. I love Greg very much. I believed I'd never have what I have now. He also moved in with me for good. All his weird stuff is here. He has yet to place it everywhere.” Sherlock grinned.
“Chicken, please.” It was still hard for him to ask for something but Greg just put it on his plate and handed it back.
“I have many people working for me and I would like to be by your side helping you.” To Sherlock, this was a bit alien. How could Ian help if he was sleeping? But then he had an idea.
“Of course …” John picked up his trackpants. The boxers were torn and so was his t-shirt but only at the hem. He pulled it over his head and ruffled his hair. Then he deeply inhaled and exhaled several times before he faced Mycroft again. He entered the living room.
“See what you have done? This is your fault!” Now he yelled too and even stood. Greg straightened his body.
“Yes, please. Make a bowl for Myc, too. I am sure he hasn't eaten a thing and you wouldn't get him to eat risotto. But he will eat dessert.” A small smile came up on John's face because he remembered what Sherlock always said about his
“I didn’t see.” John murmured getting his med-kit. Sherlock just sat there and breathed slowly. His face was pale as death and when John felt his pulse it was rather weak. He gently pecked a kiss on his forehead. Only then he started to clean and bandage his wrists.
“I would like to go home now.” John shivered when his lips brushed over his ear. He just nodded and Sherlock tightened his grip around him. Then he jumped and brought them down. He kept his arm around John and they walked back to the car very close to each other.
John relaxed and smiled. His fingers found their way into Sherlock’s hair and slowly moved over his scalp. He felt his hot breath ghost through the fabric. His long fingers rested against his muscular chest.
“Wait... Could you perhaps... I mean... Just wait...” John panted and turned on his front. He spread his legs a bit and Sherlock understood. He didn't want to be fucked. He wanted Sherlock to rub between his legs, against his hot flesh. It made John vulnerable and gave Sherlock the full control. He could even hold him down if needed.
“Dr Watson has made Sherlock into his submissive. They are a 24/7 BDSM couple but I believe Sherlock is suffering. He needs to be saved. He is forced to act in front of a camera. John Watson is selling these DVDs and he is also renting him out. I have all the proof you need. Sherlock Holmes is in an abusive relationship with Dr John Watson. I am asking for your help here, DCI Lestrade.”
Surely, he wasn’t the type of man who enjoyed dinner parties with black tie restrictions. He also couldn’t imagine him in the opera. Mycroft worried his lips and didn’t even notice Gregory standing by his side.
He felt being carried outside and placed into a transporter. The van rode away with him in the back.
John's muscles were short of cramping and he had made it only half-way. He tried to look at his cock and his eyes almost crisscrossed with the effort. He wanted to show him he could do this, he needed to show him. He concentrated on the task at hand and forced himself down. When it touched his throat, he was able to suppress the gagging and instead swallowed and breathed through his nose.
He got his shaking arms under him and slowly pushed himself up. He groaned and shook but made it back on all fours. And he crawled. His speed was snake-like but instead of leaving behind a trail of slime, he left blood.
“And the one you are holding right now?” John asked and Sherlock swallowed. He opened his mouth to answer but found he couldn't. Tears threatened to spill and he bit his lips. Hard.
Sherlock turns around, surprised. John places himself in front of Sherlock and pulls up Sherlock's coat collar for him. John tries in vain to brush the water off Sherlock's hair.
Sherlock's shoulders deflate, defeated. Dr. Herscher puts down her notebook and stares intently at Sherlock.
No, not exactly. They do psychic readings and natural healing. Tarot cards, reiki, crystals, that sort of thing.
Then I don't think you are being framed. At least not on purpose. You see all your clients here, correct?
Sherlock mops up, rather meticulously, to John's relief and surprise. It is John's turn to surreptitiously watch Sherlock's somber face. John can't help but be in awe of the man.
So, we’ll not use the police for now. And as it turns out, Molly may have some candidates who won't mind participating in some topical drug testing.
Over the years, Sherlock had envisioned many things about a first kiss with John: that it would be sweet and a little awkward, that John's lips would be soft and warm, and that John would, of course, be more experienced. But he also made a grave miscalculation: he had not factored in John's response, the ardor of John's returning kiss, and Sherlock thus hadn't foreseen the devastating and euphoric effect it would have on his own heart, body, and soul. Sherlock broke off the kiss with extreme reluctance and rested his head against the backrest, recovering his breath.
Sherlock presses his body weight against John, pinning him to the shower wall as the water continues to cascade down them both. John puts a forearm against the shower wall for support, granting Sherlock enough access to his groin. Sherlock reaches around to grasp John's cock and begins stroking it back and forth, as he slides his own cock up and down the length of John's cleft.
Oh, very recent, dear. Very! But it has been a long time in the making. A long time. I was worried it would never happen. So many obstacles in the way... most of which they created themselves, you know.
John turns in surprise and sees Sherlock in the sitting room. He blushes and smiles and walks down the hall, through the kitchen, and joins Sherlock in the sitting room.
In the dark, they spoke softly about the evening's case and a myriad of other inconsequential things. Sherlock felt nearly overcome by this sweet and idle pillow talk—this tender, commonplace intimacy that the whole world took for granted but that Sherlock hadn't had the opportunity to experience until that moment. It was lovely.
Could you... give me a few more kisses? To help get me in the mood? All this arguing has put me off.
John noticed him and looked at him with a happy smile. He walked right up to Sherlock, and sensing Sherlock's nervous state, put a reassuring hand on his hip.
It's just that... it might be easier if this were more of a casual fling. Easier on our friendship, anyway.
John closes the door and walks towards the middle of the sitting room. He pulls out his mobile and sends a text. It reads: RU HOME?
Shall I regale you with my other fantasies, John? About how I plan to shag you... up, down, and sideways... in every room of this fucking flat?
Sherlock awoke from his reverie, finding himself once again in his leather chair at 221B Baker Street, in his proper timeline this time. He looked up at John curiously. John remained at his post standing behind his chair, possessing the same look of fear on his face, but a measure of hope had crept into his eyes as well.
Lestrade sits at his desk with a brown bag lunch and a couple of manila files open on his desk, but he doesn't seem focused on any of them. His brow is furrowed. Sherlock raps on the door and pops his head in.
No, forensics would have found nothing because the bloody medics opened the window and it all dissipated.
John leans against the wall, letting the shower spray patter on him, while half a meter away Sherlock lubes up his hand again and gently works his own erection. Sherlock's eyes are half-lidded, greedily roaming John's body as he touches himself.
Uh-huh. What's your schedule like this week? Oh, okay... yes, Tuesday works. 8pm. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Bye, AJ.
And when you are down here, you can be helpful around the flat, too. At my age, I shouldn't go about standing on stools. And you're nice and tall.
"There's no reason to be sorry, Sherlock," John reassured him. John's patience with him only added to Sherlock's distress, but he still slid his hand across the booth seat until his pinkie finger bumped into John's. John wrapped his pinkie around Sherlock's, and Sherlock felt grounded. They sat that way for several minutes, listening to the dance music swirling around them. Sherlock, by degrees, began to feel more stable.
He knew he would wake up in a few seconds and brought him into the desired position exposing his behind. He lubed the funnel and waited.
He stood still leaning on Sherlock’s thighs. Their eyes met again and Sherlock laughed. John laughed, too. He almost ripped off the gag and then he kissed him. He climbed on his lap and kissed him deeply.
“Oh, you want to have dinner? You never… Anyway, I could cook something fresh for you. I just had prepared several meals because no one told me… But if you wouldn’t mind waiting for half an hour, I could just…” She gestured vaguely at the fridge and oven.
“Wiggle your fingers if you are feeling well.” Sergej had his hand on his head. He watched the long fingers wiggle slowly and he smiled.
“You will love the way back to the helicopter. There is a secret passage-way that has been used by pirates in the past. It leads outside and ends directly by the sea.” Sherlock’s head slowly came up and a lopsided smiled pulled his lips up. Greg grinned at him.
“They want my help. They need me to solve their lost cases. They hate me for it. They call me names behind my back. Freak’s here, they say. They think I am insane. They think I have no feelings. That I don’t feel. But that’s not true, John.”
Greg woke up feeling quite drowsy and also a bit dizzy. His mouth felt like being filled with cotton. He also felt a bit caught between something cold and very warm. Somehow, he was able to feel Mycroft behind him. His mate.
"One of the remodeling crew told me he found it when they moved the sofa," Sherlock explained, "Apparently, he took it home to give it a read first before bothering to let me know of its existence."
Rosie got the best of both you, I'd say. Mary's cleverness, and all her father's sweetness. And her head-strongness... from all three of you.
a voice in his head chided him. But yes, that's exactly what Sherlock wanted to do. He was belatedly realizing he didn't appreciate watching people flirt with John any more than John liked people flirting with him.
"I should probably get to bed." The extreme hesitancy in John's voice set off a sweet twang in Sherlock's chest. Sherlock was struck with an idea.
In fact, he'd figured out you were coming into our lives before anyone else had. That's how clever he is.
John sits at the kitchen table, looking up at Sherlock expectantly. John has just tried very hard to get across the idea that he wants Sherlock to be the best man at his wedding. Sherlock stands looking down at him flummoxed and speechless.
I already know how much stock you take in your relationship with John, I can see it all over your stupid face. I needed assurance that John also treats it with all the seriousness it deserves.
“And so,” Sherlock said, rising from his chair with a small smile, “This one, in fact, will be our fourth.”
Sherlock strips as he makes his way to the bedroom, forming puddles of clothing all down the hallway.
Yes, that was very bad form of me, wasn't it? Young children thrive in a stable home environment, and I've certainly failed to provide that this week.
Oh lord, listen to this Audrey! "How will I know how to dress if you don't tell me where we're going?"
Perfectly fine surveillance, Sherlock. With you two acting like an old married couple for a decade now, how could anyone tell the difference?
"What do you want to do, then? You already made it clear you weren't interested in dancing. Unless you’ve changed your mind?"
Sherlock smiles in triumph and continues to caress John with his left hand while stroking him with his right. John has some happy genitals right now.
Sherlock continues to build a Duplo cemetery for Rosie as he talks. Rosie makes ghost noises and other playful sounds.
Come dear, out with it. A bout of domestics with John over the last week or so... must be wearing on you.
John pulls Sherlock to stand under the shower head. John gets out some shampoo and washes Sherlock's hair.
"No chance at all"? But... that afternoon... John, I recall the events of that afternoon quite vividly. You were crying a bit...
Okay, that's enough, Sherlock. We don't need you getting all worked up again. Let the medics finish up, please. We'll be seeing the heart specialist Monday. And I'll monitor him all weekend, promise.
Hello Dr. Watson! Thank you for calling us back... Yes, that's right, he never showed up... I've got Audrey here and an Officer Greg something...
You know my feelings better than I do sometimes... at all times, actually. And I don't know my own feelings in this instance, at all.
John growls lowly in frustration. Sherlock comes to stand behind John again and slowly unbuckles John's belt, kissing John's shoulder and neck in the process. Sherlock begins working on the button and zip, keeping up with the kisses.
Sherlock inserts a second finger into John's hole. John immediately rocks himself back onto Sherlock's fingers with desire.
We'll start with the vibration off. Perhaps we'll add it later, don't you think? Now spread your legs a little wider for me... thank you.
John looks up at Sherlock with uncertainty. Sherlock smiles at him, grabs his coat, and scampers out the front door.
John puts his phone down and returns to eating his sandwich. The mobile buzzes and he grabs it eagerly.
And my landlady Mrs. Hudson thinks I'm already in love and don't know it already, which I find highly improbable.
Not to worry, John. Just the embarrassing bits. Angeline, I didn't tell you about the time John got stuck with an ASBO for graffitiing.
I really don't think orgasming three times within one afternoon is a possibility for me, despite what my willy might think. But thank you for the offer. I'll go start my chores.
He sets down his phone with disappointment. John gets another text alert. It is from Nazir this time.
Sherlock glances keenly at John, one eyebrow cocked as if to say 'We should give this a try'. John looks at Sherlock in shock, and then is so embarrassed that he hides his head in his hands.
John, all set for bed, gets in and pulls up the duvet. Sherlock breezes in, also looking ready for bed.
By the glow of the night-light, he opens the mirror cabinet and takes out a small container of lube he's stashed there. He cautiously looks over his shoulder at the frosted glass door separating the bathroom from Sherlock's bedroom. He gingerly pulls down his pajamas and frees his painfully hard cock, inhaling through gritted teeth.
Where exactly are these precious children that you are supposedly supervising right now? For someone so keen on childhood welfare you are being rather neglectful at the moment, aren't you Audrey?
Sherlock tilts forward and braces his forearms against the shower door for support. John stands to his side to better access the front and back of Sherlock simultaneously. John generously lubes up his fingers, being careful to not let the shower water wash off the lubricant. With his left hand, he resumes masturbating Sherlock. With the fingertips of his right hand, he gently massages the sensitive area around Sherlock's anus.
Enough, Sherlock. Thank you, I get the point. I don't need a laundry list of all my failed relationships.
Needless to say, my feelings for Mary were far from sorted when she was suddenly killed, taken from me. Then there was only rage.
Really, John! She just wants to see what the fuss is about. I'll change her nappy while we're there.
I'm not quite sure how we went from fannying about with dildos to a massive heart-to-heart, Sherlock.
John gives out a tremendous sigh. He concentrates on the unseen patterns he's drawing on Sherlock's skin as he talks. Too afraid to make eye contact.
Some random woman who happens to smile at you on the bus, probably my long-lost cousin in disguise, or something.
Which is why we are here discussing the fact that you are practically despondent that your chosen partner hasn't said 'I love you' back to you yet.
John grabs the phone off the nightstand and hands it to Sherlock. John sits back down on the bed next to him.
Mycroft looks absolutely dejected. Sherlock hesitates slightly, and then gives his brother a stiff but gentle hug. Mycroft tolerates it for a brief moment.
And I slowly enter you... very slowly... so that I can watch the expression on your face as I push into you a centimeter at a time... so slow... until my entire cock fills you up. Just envision that, Sherlock.
Now please. Allow yourself time to develop and explore your feelings with John. It is the least you can do for yourself and for him.
Anyway, plenty of overly-blunt opinions about my choice of girlfriends and general annoyance with my dating life... but actual jealousy? Not really.
Molly sets down the tray on the table. Everyone gathers around. She takes off the towel with a flourish. A severed arm lies beneath. John and Nazir take a step back. Molly smiles happily, but notices John and Nazir's reticence.
Yes! A case! A string of mysterious poisonings! It's fantastic! Scotland Yard even thinks it’s important enough to work on a Saturday, believe it or not. I'm meeting Nazir at two.
Sherlock, it's late. I'm tired. We should each sleep on this anyway. We can continue this discussion when we're fresh.
It has been happening a lot more lately... us, spending so much time in bed together... the kisses, the cuddling. The proximity to you, night after night.
I've narrowed down the possibilities to twenty... fifteen of which require tickets that must be collected and paid for in advanced. Therefore, he must be collecting the tickets today.
“Let's hope it's the former," Sherlock smirked with a wink. He didn't wait for John to respond before launching into the next part of the plan.
That's not actually helpful. Or possible. Some of those things were mutually exclusive. A relationship can't be both casual and serious at the same time, for one.
No, I'm not. But Molly Hooper is. And John Watson is. John definitely is. He has a strongly held belief that he's not complete without a romantic partner.
Once the tea was ready, John carefully made his way into the sitting room carrying two mugs, one which he set down at the side table near his own red chair, the other he handed to Sherlock.
Sherlock pulls his head back from the doorway. Lestrade stares off into space with a frown. Sherlock pops his head in the door frame once again.
John exits the change room in the spiffy outfit to check himself out in the long mirror and the clerk rushes over with a gasp.
There's a knock at the door. Audrey enters carrying something wrapped in a towel in her arms. Rosie toddles in after.
And if looking after my daughter is inconveniencing you so much, I'll go ask Mrs. Hudson to watch her.
Sherlock regards him softly before getting back into bed and snuggling up to John, with Sherlock's head on John's chest.
Sherlock nods in response and closes his eyes, trying to focus on John's movements and the carnal pleasure it is bringing him.
His dead wife's maiden name. Well, it wasn't really her name, just one she stole off of a headstone when she gave up her life as an international assassin.
John, in bed, is reading a book with his reading glasses on. Sherlock exits the bathroom in his pajamas. He giggles.
end of the flirtation, John Watson's feathers would get ruffled: case in point, there was the time Irene had dared to text him on his birthday, around the time of the Culverton case if he recalled properly, and John had flown into an absolute rage. But that was over a year ago, well before John decided he "hated the suburbs" and had moved himself and his daughter into 221B (where they both belonged, Sherlock opined). All that was ancient history. Which reminded him...
John experiments by pressing his finger a smidgen deeper into Sherlock's arse. Then a centimeter more.
“There we go. This is new. I read about it on the internet. You know how to safeword, John. If you won't I will proceed now.” John looked up at him and just nodded. Sherlock snarled happily and pulled him up. He had to spread his legs a bit because the diaper was thick and he wouldn't be able to close his legs. He wondered what Sherlock was up to. He found out right then.
“Sherlock, my darling boy! You came home!” She hurried towards him and hugged him. Sherlock hugged her back.
”You had him dragged out of the concert hall as if he was a suspected murderer. It surely looked like an arrest.” Mycroft thoughtfully hummed.
“And I know he loves you very much. I was the one he confided in. He told me when he was looking at you, he felt something he couldn't analyse.” Both men quietly laughed.
“Like what? The only thing I want to do is join your troops when storming into their place. I want a weapon. I want to kill them all.” His blue eyes were on fire.
“Dinner will be served in a minute, Master. Please, take a seat, master.” He bowed and John stood following him over to the table. Sherlock pulled out the chair for him and let him sit. One arm on his back he filled his dom's glass.
But Sherlock fell asleep rather soon anyway and slowly slumped towards Ian who simply arranged him on the sofa. Finally, Sherlock’s head rested on his thigh and his long legs were pulled up. He was on his side facing Ian and his nose almost poked into his body. But he peacefully slept.
He almost didn't notice when he was taken off the rack and freed from his gag. He was pushed to the ground and fell hard.
“I am glad you understood. And even though it was a painful process, both for you and me, I believe we have something to build on, haven’t we?” Greg asked.
“He has scars, Greg. He has scars all over his back. Old and new. That's all I am going to tell you. You have to trust me.”
“Yes, I did. He was a bit sceptic after he read your file. But I am not. I think it will work. I really do. Together we can make it work.” John took the last of his wine and at once a new glass appeared on the table.
John made a quick step forward and ripped his dress-shirt off his slim body. Now Sherlock was completely naked. John licked his lips and touched his hairless chest. He rubbed over his nipples until they stood out.
“I don’t understand. He knows I am solving crimes. But how can he know that there will be a crime during dinner?” Sherlock looked at John.
“I believe you are very good at interrogating people, too, aren't you?” He smugly smiled up at him and finally, Greg relaxed. He even smiled.
“Yes! They are great. I know they are not healthy but I like them.” He had finished his bowl and stood to get a second helping. Now John was really surprised.
John looked at the closed door and sighed. He wondered if Sherlock really liked it that rough. Rough as he liked it. Perhaps, he wouldn’t like his skin being covered in welts. Perhaps, he simply liked to be taken roughly.
Sherlock had stopped building. Rosie lay on her back conducting her own experiment of banging two blocks together over and over.
John regards Sherlock with a sudden and unexpected soft look, making Sherlock's heart rate spike for a moment. John leaves the bathroom.
I just want you to know it's not you... not anything you are doing or not doing. It's me. I have troubles keeping the proper mindfulness for sex. I can't stay "in the moment" as they say. And poof! there goes my erection. If I think too hard, I tend to focus on the mechanics and the ridiculousness of it all. And if I don't focus on it enough, I drift off...
Sherlock resumes working over John's erection with his tongue, his left hand holding the base firmly. With his free hand, Sherlock kneads John's buttocks.
Sherlock begins experimenting with different angles of the dildo all while stroking John's cock from bell-end to base. John's head thrashes on the pillow and his moans grow more fervent. John suddenly tenses up.
John's praise stirs up both arousal and deep emotion in Sherlock. Sherlock's kisses on John's shoulders and neck get more desperate. He holds John to him even closer.
John assumes the position and Sherlock carefully and slowly inserts a finger with a sharp inhale. He moves it around gently. Sherlock plants some kisses on John's back and ass while he works.
John, indeed bored, meanders about. He spies a basket on a credenza filled with small bottles of lotion, like the kind you find at hotels. Curious, he picks up a bottle and inspects the label. He opens the bottle and sniffs it; he likes the scent. He hears footsteps and immediately puts the bottle back. Sherlock and Irene walk in.
Yes, I'll have the pleasure of contending with both my lovely and emotionally-draining siblings at the same time.
John is too chuffed having the upper hand (for once) to be annoyed. He leans against the counter watching Sherlock pace.
Can I assume this means you would like us to pursue a serious, intimate, relationship with all the bells and whistles?
John emerges from the bathroom with the now-clean toys in tow. He sets them on the dresser. Sherlock sits up and rests his back against the headboard as John approaches. John crawls onto the bed and places his hands on the headboard on either side of Sherlock’s face and kisses Sherlock deeply. John smiles and sits back on his haunches between Sherlock's spread legs. He looks down and watches Sherlock masturbating, then grabs the lube and slicks up his own hands. John's hands join Sherlock's on his hard cock. For a moment four hands work Sherlock's balls, shaft, and tip before Sherlock lets John's skillful hands take over.
No, I'm just saying you like women. A lot. And it is a bit hard for me to compete with fifty percent of the world population, John.
That's right, taking me all in... I want to feel you on my cock, I want to know how it feels to be completely inside you.
Why don't you go mind palace in your room, then? Or in that bloody mad scientist laboratory you have going on in the basement, hm?
John smiles at Rosie as she eats, and then glances anxiously towards the back hallway. But no Sherlock magically appears.
Gregory's intellect is not the problem. Gregory himself is not the problem at all. I am the problem.
Am I? And smug married couples often discuss how they don't want their friends to date sociopaths, do they?
Sherlock begins mouthing and sucking John's cock in earnest. His stroking takes on more force, setting a faster pace.
I have no way of knowing... since you've always been extremely private about your, erm, love life...
John looked up at Sherlock briefly and then back down at his drink, stabbing at a wedge of lime floating in the glass with his straw.
Sherlock lies on his back, his head on his pillow. He looks up uncertainly at John. John smiles tenderly at him, giving reassurance.
John begins to lightly stroke Sherlock's long penis from tip to base and back up. Sherlock closes his eyes momentarily with pleasure.
The vibrating component of the toy buzzes to life. John's knees really do buckle this time. He buries his face in the duvet.
Surprises are overrated. Is it dinner and a movie? I know that's cliché, but you're a bit of a traditionalist, John.
John leans in and kisses and licks at Sherlock's neck while gliding his hand up and down Sherlock's penis.
Sherlock looks like he want to flee the flat. John races into the room holding the paper shopping bag that Sherlock had shown Molly earlier.
John moans again and sways his hips back and forth. Sherlock's breath hitches as he watches one of his partner's favorite body parts in action.
Sherlock straightens up in a hurry, blinking in confusion. He gazes down at his sleeping friend with trepidation.
Sherlock goes breathless. He looks agog into John's loving eyes. Then he bends his head down again to listen to John's heartbeat. John wraps his arms around Sherlock. Sherlock, satisfied at hearing John's healthy heart, sighs in contentment. He closes his eyes and wraps his arms around John too.
Sherlock spreads them and John kneels in the space created. With an appraising smile, he leans over Sherlock and places one hand on either side of Sherlock's arms.
On the contrary, she tells me nothing. And even though Nazir holds her cards close to her chest, she is distinctly more chipper on the days she has lunch with you. I've narrowed it down to a standing lunch date on Mondays and Thursdays, although I suspect you are considering adding a third day soon.
Okay, can we get this pillow under your head, please? Your neck will thank you for it tomorrow morning.
John only pursed his lips and doubled his efforts to spearfish the piece of fruit. Sherlock sighed and slid heavily into the booth.
John is happy to comply. He holds the base of Sherlock's penis with his left hand while he wraps his lips around the top. Meanwhile he continues to work the finger of his right hand in and out of Sherlock. John tries to match the rhythm of his shallow finger thrusts with the bobbing of his head on Sherlock's cock. He takes it deeper into his mouth.
"Is that really preferable to prison?" John asked, "Where at least I would know you were alive, Sherlock. Rather than thinking you were alive, but you actually being dead."
Pleasantries were exchanged as John passed his one-year-old daughter to Sherlock and headed for his favorite chair in the sitting room.
Not just slightly attractive. Not merely "very" attractive. Undeniably attractive. Categorically attractive.
We both know that at soon as she sees you, she'll latch on and there'll be no way I'll coax her back upstairs. I know she's very attached to you, Sherlock. I don't need a hysterical toddler on my hands when she's perfectly happy at the moment.
Mine came back negative. Never been a fan of the stuff. I like a clear head when I work. Marta's on the other hand...
Sherlock sits in his chair with this hands steepled under his chin, deep in thought. He hears steps on the landing. Sherlock cocks his head to listen. John enters the kitchen carrying shopping bags.
I plan on telling Mycroft about the situation. His people will take it on and ensure my source's immunity in the process. I'm not certain your department can offer them the same amount of protection.
Sherlock goes to slice up an apple for Rosie. When he returns to sit at the table, John has brought them each a plate of eggs and toast.
Sherlock gently pulls John's face to his, so he can kiss him deeply. John runs his fingers through Sherlock’s curls.
Believe me, this is not the circumstances I would have chosen for our first time spending the night together.
John enters, turns on the baby monitor, and gets into bed on his usual side. He sighs happily and settles down to sleep.
John turned it over in his hands. It most definitely was the same ashtray Sherlock had filched from Buckingham Palace. John didn't like the tight feeling that sprang to his chest upon seeing it again. He tried very hard to maintain a neutral expression in order to mask the turmoil taking place in his heart and mind.
After all that, I made a vow to myself to give up dangerous things. My addiction to dangerous things. I needed to do it for Rosie's sake. And for my own. I can't let Rosie become an orphan like Mary was. I can't. I want to be a better parent to her than my own were.
“You know, I might keep you a while longer. Would you like that?” Moran looked up at Mycroft but said nothing. The drug was really good. He was pliant, didn't talk back but had all his abilities. Even his eyes showed no hate or anger; just some sort of curiosity.
“OK, I am sorry. Listen, Sherlock. Could you please tell me how you found him? I mean, you weren’t tracing us, were you?” Sherlock smiled.
“Anyway, Sherlock is due to see my doctor today. Afterwards, he is supposed to come here. He won't cancel the appointment. I will talk to him about the other night.” Mycroft said and poured another tea.
“Thank you, Sir. I am trying for you, I really do, Master. Forgive me, please, Sir!” Sherlock begged but desperately tried to push into John's hand. The grip tightened.
„This is a parking lot. Admittedly, it is nice here because we are a bit away from the motorway, the trees are close and it is rather quiet. I actually wanted something nicer but you wanted to stop.“ He shrugged.
He stood and looked through the cupboards to find something to nibble on. He ate several biscuits and actually ordered take-away. He also ordered for John and put it in the fridge.
After a while, he took off the pads and stored the machine away. John wasn't moving or twitching or doing anything. Sherlock carefully rolled him on his back and his head lolled over the pillow. He reached for his cock and slowly pulled it. John let out some breath but nothing more.
He slept for a few hours and woke by himself. He rubbed his eyes and felt warm again. He rolled out of bed and freshened up, brushed his teeth. He found a fresh pyjama and t-shirt. He decided to look for John and Ian. He desperately needed to talk to John.
Only then he walked upstairs. He saw it kneeling on the hardwood with the dress draped around him. His hair was still open and his hands were folded on his nape beneath it. Simply perfect.
“Sherlock, oh God, thank you! I thought …” His hands were on his arm again and fisted into his shirt. Sherlock thought where the fuck Lestrade was but suddenly a police cruiser moved over the water and they were bathed in the floodlight. As soon as they were caught in it, the cruiser came over and hands pulled John on board. Sherlock held on to the steel ladder at the side and waited until it was his turn.
“You never took my measurements.” Sherlock said while John adjusted everything and pulled the straps tight before he buckled it down on his back. Next came the arms.
Sherlock turned away and shed his coat to hang it up. He washed his hands and took the plates and everything else John had taken out to set up the table.
“Yes, I certainly do. But I will always listen to you. I will always stop when you tell me to. I will never hurt you on purpose. I will only ever dish out painful punishment during our sexy times. And I will never dish out a punishment that is wicked, mean or bloody.”
It took him yet another hour to finally come back up. He didn’t move into sleep; he simply came back from subspace opening his eyes and staring up at Greg.
“Well, he surely is not at Whitehall since I tried to reach him there.” Both men looked at each other and Greg didn't react. Dr Kim drank more tea.
“Yes, please do that.” First, Sherlock took the tray away. John had eaten everything. He returned and checked the wound. It wasn't infected and he taped it over.
He also started to think about John and how he had treated him during the last days, perhaps even weeks. He couldn't even be sure if John still was at 221B. Perhaps he had already lost him.
“I have found several leaks and two traitors. I wrote it down for you.” He pointed to a notebook. John was shocked and it showed.
“Ok, coming in a sec.” John just stepped into his shoes and grabbed his jacket. He got his wallet and mobile and then they left running downstairs.
By now, he was smart enough to accept the help of others. And not only accept it but actively ask for it.
John pushed into him and Sherlock gurgled but took it. He felt his balls pull up and pressed down. Then he waited holding his breath. His dome once yelled and then shot his load deep down his throat. Sherlock swallowed the whole load and gently pulled off cleaning the massive thing in the process.
“Get on the floor and on your chest. Close your legs.” John ordered and Sherlock quickly went down. He tied his ankles, used rope beneath his knees and around his thighs. He even tied his long toes.
“I am adding one more peg for that!” Sherlock whined. His balls were on fire. He felt John getting up and move through the room. He returned after a few seconds and slicked something up. It touched his hole and was pushed inside. These were anal-beads. Sherlock could feel them. He had never used them on himself. He tried to relax and the first three beads went inside just fine. But of course, they were getting bigger and bigger and soon he groaned and tensed. John forced the whole thing into him anyway. Sherlock was sweating badly. His behind felt filled and stretched. He also was in severe pain. His arms kept cramping and his back hurt. So did his insides and his balls.
“I agree. Get Anthea, too.” Mycroft nodded and both men settled at the large table. It left John and Greg standing around like furniture.
“Doesn’t it want to show me how beautiful it thinks I am?” He knew what to do and made his cock swell. She was very pleased by his instant reaction.
“Oh, Sherlock…” He murmured closing the door. He slowly moved up to his armchair and looked at the man who had somehow folded himself into the thing. Snot covered his mouth and tears had dried on his cheeks. Even his dressing gown was still a bit wet.
Greg joined Mycroft on the swing and lit a cigarette for him. Both men inhaled and closed their eyes.
“Oh, don't you worry, dear, they will grow again.” He giggled and approached. He stared into his eyes and Sherlock stared back. And then he ripped out his left fang. Sherlock gurgled and blood ran out of his mouth and over his lips and chin. Jim kept watching him and waited a bit until he pulled out his right fang.
“Thank you, Master. I would like to get tied to the bed with a blindfold on. I would like you to touch me everywhere, stroke my skin and kiss me. I would like you to make love to me. Please, don't use anything on me. I would just like your hands and your cock, Master.” John hummed. This he could do; it was no hardship and he would get to fuck him.
“When everything is back to normal again, would you like to have dinner with me?” He asked hopefully and a broad smile came up on Greg's face.
“I know you would never do such things to me. Don't be so doubtful or angry with yourself.” Greg's eyes swam in tears when he shook his head.
But now he felt safe and warm. He was covered by a blanket but something was on his face. His brain provided him with the answer.
Right then, Sherlock dashed out of the bath in all his naked glory. He looked fresh and absolutely not tired.
“DCI Lestrade, Sir, we have found a trace. A small plane left a private airfield and the description fit both this Dr Watson and Sherlock.”
“Are you cold?” The deep voice rumbled into his ear. It shot right down his spine and he weakly nodded.
Sherlock bought different oils and creams and even went into a special book-store to find information regarding bondage and disabled people. The guy in the shop knew him quite well and helped a lot. He actually advised a swing and a suspension rack. He gave Sherlock several magazines and leaflets who thanked him a lot. He wanted to give him something but the man denied him vehemently shaking his head. Sherlock stuffed several notes into a huge glass already filled with many coins with a label on it saying
