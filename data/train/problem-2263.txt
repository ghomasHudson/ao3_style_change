I do need to give extra special thanks too.
A quick heads up that I may not be able to post weekly all the time, the idea fairy is being a little slow on her flight this time so future chapters may be a bit less frequent. :'(
Nodding politely at each person as Mary introduces them the surgeon finally allows his gaze to settle on her.  Her dismissive attitude is jarring but not overly unusual in worried family members.  He decides to privately alert the nurses about the conflict that appears to exist between his patient’s wife and his patient’s friends.
“So, no-one?”  The rising colour on John’s face makes it very clear what he is really asking about.  Sex.  And doesn’t it all boil down to that, one way or the other, in the end? Sherlock thinks.
are important to
"Home!" John snorts. "Baker Street is home. Half completed experiments and feet in the fridge, are home. Case notes pinned to the wall and cold cups of tea, are home. That woman and that place we 'shared' is not home, has never been home!" John takes a deep breath, attempting to calm himself, aware that Sherlock does not deserve to be on the receiving end of his anger. "You, and wherever you are, is my home."
One firm hand is wrapped around his cock, unmoving but the muscles in John’s arm are tensed, giving evidence to how hard he is resisting stroking himself as Sherlock watches.
John slowly slides his hands over Sherlock's stomach and chest, pushing the shirt aside.  He can feel each dip and rise of muscle as he goes.  He knows from patching Sherlock up that he is more muscular than the narrow cut of his suits would suggest;  feeling the truth of it beneath his hands in this situation sends bolts of pleasure from his fingertips through his body, settling in his groin.  Upon reaching Sherlock's shoulders John slides his hands under the material of Sherlock's shirt, gently easing  it from them, cupping the strong curves as he does.  Sherlock is straining up in an effort to press his bare chest against John's as it hovers tantalisingly close to his own.  John quickly takes advantage of the situation and pulls the shirt out from beneath Sherlock, sweeping the thin material to the floor.  John presses Sherlock back onto the bed, laying his body against him.  The skin on skin contact is everything he ever fantasised about and so much more; Sherlock is hot and vibrant beneath him, not the cold, unfeeling machine he sometimes pretends to be.  John can feel the way Sherlock is trembling and quaking beneath him and realises it would be cruel to continue his teasing exploration.  John gives a low rumbling moan when large hands clutch at his backside, pressing their hips together. John's cock twitches in interest and Sherlock whimpers at the sensation.
"Oh..... Jesus Christ...... Look at us."
"And a day?"
"I'm going to put my hand on you now."
"John. Do you really think it's wise to be calling the man who is about to teach you to dance an idiot? A dance, in fact, that you will be doing in front of all your nearest and dearest?"  Despite the serious words Sherlock forced his voice to be light-hearted and carefree.
“He?”
“No. Look at them.” Sherlock insists, reducing the limited space between them even further.  “Matching wedding rings, clothing style that unconsciously mimics the other.  It’s the same with their body language, everything indicates at least twenty-five years of marriage. Two children, both grown; I saw a photograph when he opened his wallet a moment ago.”
Five minutes later John is back in the main room, clean and changed and looking longingly at his bed.
"Read on, John." Sherlock, always the quicker reader, has already absorbed all of the information displayed on the page.
“Least they could do considering they let a mad woman slip through their grasp.”  John mutters, his fingers digging deep into his skin.
Since Sherlock had regained consciousness all the visits had stopped. Mycroft's involvement was obvious, and the nurses were grateful that John and Sherlock had time to be together before having to deal with the rest of the world. They had seen the gentle kisses John had pressed to Sherlock's face and had heard about the way the machines had reacted to some intimately spoken words. They didn't need to be the genius that Sherlock was said to be to know that these two men needed space and each other. Nothing more was deemed necessary unless Doctor Watson requested it.
After what may be hours (and is at least five episodes of Doctor Who) John finds his attention being required once more.
As always the very deepest of thanks go to my wonderful beta - Lockedinjohnlock.  She's very busy working, parenting, living her own life and being a fabulous podficcer and yet she always finds time to beta for me.  I know I can never find the words to tell her how much that truly means to me!
"Well, as long as you are both well I'll say goodnight.  I don't want to be out too late, this little one is already making me tired." She laughs and pats her tummy.
"Mary? Seriously?" An incredulous grin sits on Greg's face as he waits for the punch line of the joke. He focuses on each man in turn but sees no deceit. "John's Mary shot Sherlock? And you knew, and did nothing?"
Sighing, Sherlock lowers his long frame until he is sitting on the edge of the single bed, facing John, their knees nearly touching. Leaning forward, he rests his elbows on his knees, clasping his hands against his lips before lowering them under his chin. Sherlock's gaze rests on him and John fights the urge to fidget under its quiet scrutiny. Sherlock's eyes are a bright, sky blue tonight and John is utterly spellbound as they scan over him. Sherlock's gaze finally stills on John's mouth and John holds his breath.
“Oh, John, you'll never need to beg me for this.”
“Great investigative work, love.” John teases.
Long moments pass and John can feel Sherlock starting to pull himself together, he sits back on his knees, studying Sherlock's face carefully for any sign of distress before resuming his seat on the edge of the coffee table.
Argh! First off I'm dreadfully sorry about how long it has taken to get this chapter out to you all! It's been mostly ready since June but lacking that last few hundred words.
The look on Sherlock's face causes John's breath to catch; Sherlock has obviously licked his lips at some point and they now glisten in the late morning light; they part slightly in a secret smile, meant only for John. Sherlock's eyes are sparkling, bright blue-green today, and his voice when he speaks is teasingly intimate.
It takes John a moment to realise that
When you marry
"Why the hell does he need to be involved?" John chuckles in relief at the return of Sherlock's imperiousness, even whilst tugging at his hand in a gentle reprimand.
He closes his eyes and breathes through the worst of the pain, focussing on the sensation of Sherlock’s palm against his own.
He cups his left hand against Sherlock's cheek, feeling the slight brush of stubble against the palm of his hand, another reminder that Sherlock is gloriously human after all. With great care, John lowers his head until their lips meet. It's the briefest of caresses but John can already feel the tension begin to creep out of his bones. Sherlock releases John's hand and pulls him down closer, large hands wrapping themselves over John's hips, anchoring him. John moves until he is straddling Sherlock where he sits on the edge of the bed, one knee on each side of Sherlock's hips, his full weight held above Sherlock's lap by the flexing of his bent thighs.
"Whatever you want, Sherlock, love. Whatever you want." The words have barely left John's lips before he slips into a deep and dreamless sleep.
Sherlock closes his eyes and visualises their rooms at Baker Street, a little tidier, a little cleaner but with the obvious presence of a child.  Toys are on the floor, children’s books rest in unruly piles throughout the room, wires and sharp edges are hidden away or covered over,  the sound of a violin playing a lullaby echoes softly around the room.  So far, so good; the idea of child in the flat brings Sherlock no distress, in fact he feels a sense of warmth and home; of rightness.
"Bloody Mycroft." Sherlock corrects from his duvet nest.
“But I want more than that, I want this, you, us….”
“I have found, little brother, that is precisely when you are often at your most truthful.”
"I need you to move, Love." The words barely leave his lips when he feels a tentative thrust, even the slight movement is enough to make him groan. It seems the groan is all the encouragement Sherlock requires to begin thrusting in earnest. Each surge of movement wrenches a cry from John and he grabs at Sherlock's arse digging his fingernails into the perfect globes. Sherlock cries out and tugs at John's leg, pulling it further onto his shoulder; the move causes him to slide in deeper and John's pleasured shout mingles with Sherlock's.
“Trust me, John.
Closing his eyes John savoured the sensation of his hand held within Sherlock's larger one, the long fingers gently, but firmly closed around his hand, his thumb idly tracing small circles on Sherlock's skin. He could feel the muscles on Sherlock's back, gently moving under the fingers of his right hand. Resisting the temptation to sweep his hand over Sherlock's back John allowed himself to live in the moment.
"Are these absolutely necessary John?" Sherlock knew his words were sharp, a feeble attempt to disguise his embarrassment.
John was stepping towards Sherlock's offered hand before he consciously realised what he was doing. Coming to an abrupt halt, his breath catching in his throat, he was suddenly very much aware that he would be invading Sherlock's personal space. Sherlock had no qualms about invading his.  So often and with such ease that John occasionally allowed himself to believe that Sherlock was attracted to him, enjoying the fantasy before remembering that The Work always came first. Sherlock showed no reticence about demonstrating acts of affection towards  Mrs Hudson, but was more hesitant with Greg or Molly.  When it came to acting out physical affection for potential suspects Sherlock was a master, adjusting the idea of personal space as necessary.  Despite this careful act John knew that Sherlock did not welcome the invasion of his own space, muscles tightening almost imperceptibly, eyes narrowing quickly, his distaste clear.  John had vivid memories of when The Woman had leaned in and kissed Sherlock on the cheek. John had looked for the usual reactions from Sherlock but there had been none to see, even now that knowledge pained him.  Sherlock had not locked down instead he had rattled off his deduction at super speed. Sherlock had obviously been inspired by The Woman, but had looked directly to John upon solving it and had actively asked for The Woman not to praise him, seeking only John's approval. That had been some comfort at least.
“What happened to you?”
His words are slow and careful, not wishing to complicate the issue further.
Sherlock closes his eyes and focuses on the patterns John's fingers are tracing on his naked chest.  Gradually, the patterns start to form letters.  I.  L.  O. V .... With a gasp Sherlock's eyes fly open and he flips John over onto his back, pinning his hands above his head, his own body straddling John's hips.  John's eyes are wide in surprise but he is not struggling.  Sherlock studies John's face intently, trying to find out what John might have meant with his letter tracing.
On their return to the flat, John heads into the kitchen expecting Sherlock to either head off to Bart's to examine his evidence or to throw himself into the relevant investigations here. Determined to grab some lunch and a cuppa before Sherlock takes over the kitchen, John moves with single-minded purpose, only pausing when he senses Sherlock standing in the doorway. Sherlock is intently reading something on his phone, a frown between his brows, before he finally lifts his head and meets John's eyes. For a moment, the two men just share the space, slow breaths mingling in the slightly stale air of the kitchen. Finally Sherlock takes a deep breath and turns abruptly, leaving the room.
"Oh fuck Sherlock. The sight of you on your knees, the things it does to me. " John was battling to keep some control over his body, willing himself not to come, but the sight of Sherlock naked at his feet, his tongue running along that plump lower lip was almost too much.
"No."  Sherlock quirks an eyebrow at John's sudden command but lowers his hands accordingly, resting them lightly on the duvet.  "I want to undress you."  John crawls slowly onto the bed and over Sherlock's body, keeping his weight off him.   He knows he is nowhere near as attractive as Sherlock, but the way Sherlock is gazing at him makes him feel sexy and desirable.  John lowers his face slightly, gracing the plush lips with light kisses before moving his attention onto the long column of Sherlock's neck. The skin is soft beneath John's lips, the stubble making his skin tingle.  He glides his lips back up to Sherlock's jaw, gently nipping at the rounded edge.  Each caress draws a moan from Sherlock and he grasps for John, gripping his neck and waist, anchoring him. John can feel the rapid rise and fall of Sherlock's chest, the heat of his skin, the moist kiss of sweat in his hair and John can't believe that he wrought this effect on Sherlock, that he has finally broken through all the carefully constructed barriers and has been allowed access to the man inside. He nips gently at Sherlock's earlobe before fluttering a light kiss on Sherlock's lips.
particular type of 'looking after' would have happened much further into Sherlock's healing process."
John exhales as Sherlock snaps to attention and swiftly exits the room, making John realise how shallow his breathing had been. Suddenly John wants nothing more than to get this case solved and to have some quality time alone with Sherlock - preferably involving a bed.
He closes his eyes and slides his mouth once along John’s length before letting him slip out, a trail of shimmering wetness apparent on his lower lip.
"Mycroft was wrong. Mary was rushed to hospital almost two months ago with complications from a ruptured appendix. There was a brief discussion amongst the ambulance crew, and again on arrival at the hospital, of an ectopic pregnancy, but I knew that was unlikely because, well......" Sherlock felt his eyes widen with astonishment when he saw John's face flood with colour.
Once more, Magnussen trails his fingers through the air just above Sherlock’s hand before turning his attention back to John.
John watches Sherlock carefully from the corner of his eye as he manoeuvres himself to the kitchen table. His movements are as graceful as ever but there is a tightness underlying his moves, an element of control that Sherlock is obviously exerting over himself. Sherlock catches John watching him and the flush on his otherwise pale skin deepens. John decides not to question him about it now, rather, catch him later when he's relaxed from eating and they're alone again.
“Time to head back in?’  John queries, knowing that Sherlock will understand what he is really asking; whether he is ready to share their bed.
“Quite.”  Mycroft concurs.  “As his parents already believe Michael to be dead I have arranged that when he does pass away he will be cremated and his remains flown to America to be placed, covertly, into his existing grave.  The Americans have agreed to meet all costs from this moment forth.”
“Sherlock, love?”  John intercedes, reading the signs of an impending long conversation.  “We had an early start this morning, let’s get booked in, unpack, grab some lunch and relax?”  He leans some of his weight against Sherlock, feigning weariness, his head resting against Sherlock’s shoulder.
“Watson.  Doctor John Watson.”  John provides smoothly, his smile that of a confident man in control.
“Oh, don’t be silly, dear.  I can never have enough photos of my boys and their little girl.” Mrs. Hudson coos, looking at her own phone to check that Molly has shared the photo with her.
"That's what I intend to find out, John.  It's unlikely that Anderson would have seen her since she attended the meeting.  There's a slim possibility he has seen photos of her on your blog and in newspaper coverage of the wedding but she could have changed the way she looked since he saw her last.  We know her hair isn't natural blonde, that it has a tendency to curl, what else could she have altered? Going unnoticed was her job for many years, we'd do well not to underestimate her."
.   And yet his job is dull, his career path is dull; even his marriage is dull.  He is
He reaches inside his suit jacket and removes a top of the range phone in one smooth movement.
"So, they're connected to this diplomat somehow? Was he the man in Regent's Park?" John waits until Sherlock nods before continuing. "But he's only been missing a few weeks and you returned those gems almost a year ago. Surely the fact that they're both Austrian and went missing in London is just a coincidence?"
John pauses.
Noise from down the corridor stops Sherlock from querying what Lestrade meant.  It is coming from the direction of John’s room; raised voices and the squeaking, rattling sound of a hospital bed being moved.  Throwing back his covers Sherlock begins to get out of his bed but before he can put his bare feet firmly on the floor Mycroft enters the room.
I feel absolutely disgusting.”
"No longer married to your work, then?"
“Of course sir.  It may take a few minutes to arrange, if you don’t mind the wait?”
John finally makes it home Thursday afternoon and spends a few wonderful hours playing with Rosie whilst Sherlock finishes up with Lestrade.
John expects Sherlock to move away for what is left of their journey and is very pleasantly surprised when Sherlock remains leaning against him. The gentle press of his long body against John's side simultaneously makes him relax and tense.
Eventually, John had moved back in to the much improved flat.  Baby gates were in place, dangerous chemicals and equipment were locked away in 221c, plug sockets and corners were all made safe, the floor was clean and free of junk.  Still very much 221B in essence, but now ready for its newest, and youngest, resident.  Sherlock still played his violin, often lulling both John and his daughter to sleep; he still took on cases, usually with John, Rosie safe in Mrs. Hudson’s or Molly’s care; but he also spent his time making up songs for Rosie to enjoy, reading her stories - complete with sound effects and actions; documenting her first steps and first words.  And it is the way it continues to be now - Rosie Watson is as much a part of life at 221b Baker Street as John Watson and Sherlock Holmes, and he wouldn’t change it for the world.
“Nothing he won't recover from, more’s the pity.
John!" John giggles at the sound of a very Sherlockian huff accompanied by the softer sound of a pillow hitting the dividing door.
John chuckles. "Going for the direct approach then? Hmmm. It really wasn't that obvious to me. I grew up always having strong feelings for certain friends, boys and girls, and I thought that was how everyone felt. It was only when friends starting talking about fancying people that I started questioning what it was that I felt." John leans back on the bed a little, his posture relaxed and Sherlock can see he is trying his utmost to be honest.
"I promise, John." John can see the truth of Sherlock's words in his clear blue-green eyes, their gaze steady, never wavering.
"What happens now?" His voice feels very small and he resists the temptation to curl up and hide away after baring so much of himself for John.
Sherlock is undeniably attractive; dark curly hair with hidden auburn highlights, a face that taken feature by feature should be odd, but blends the angled, ever-changing, eyes, the high cheekbones, the strong nose, the soft jawline and a full lower lip coupled with a a perfectly defined upper lip, into a face of such captivating beauty and allure that John has never seen its equal.  A  lithely muscled body, slim of waist, broad of shoulder; graceful arms and elegant hands, hands equally capable of pleasure or pain.  Long, strong legs and feet, equally capable of agitated strides and nimble manoeuvres; and a backside that has long attracted John’s attention, rounded and well-muscled.  Even with all these undeniable attractions, it is not the glimpse of Sherlock’s body that has John reeling; it is from the light-hearted laughter, the shy smiles, the kisses of such intensity that they make John breathless, the way that he is permitted, no -
"Sherlock! Over here!" John removes the package and slowly unwraps it. He can sense Sherlock standing behind him as the hair gems are finally revealed. Both men stare at their haul for a long moment before John wraps them back up, hiding their lustre. "Wow, solved by fireflies!"
"I'm sorry Love, 'his nibs' needs me at ho.... Baker Street." John quickly corrected himself.  He swept a nervous glance at Mary, she seemed oblivious to his slip, a small smile playing on her lips - he presumed from the use of her pet name for Sherlock.
The look on Sherlock’s face and the sensation that fills John is more than enough to send John plummeting head-long in to his own orgasm.
"Message received loud and clear, Miss Hooper. I won't hurt him, Doctor and soldier, remember." John gently reminds her.
“As I am sure you are aware, our dreams are often a way of our brains trying to make sense of what has happened to us. Unfortunately, this rarely seems to happen in such a way that they make sense to our waking brain, if we remember them at all.
I’m feeling like shit, furious with my duplicitous wife for obvious reasons and furious at you for reasons that I can’t even begin to make sense of but one thing I am aware of is that you were shot.
Be everything that you need.
A bed had been placed in Sherlock's room for Doctor Watson; John as they were urged to call him, and his meals were provided by the staff. He used the toilet area attached to Sherlock's room for showering and ablutions and read aloud for hours at a time, often stopping only when his voice became hoarse. The staff had lost count of the number of times they had walked past the room to see John sitting by the edge of Sherlock's bed either holding his hand or stroking his fingers gently through Sherlock's hair. No sign was seen of the good doctor's new wife and no-one queried it. It was obvious to anyone with eyes where his thoughts and heart currently laid. John only left Sherlock's room if someone else were there in his place; these trusted individuals were few and the staff got to know them well, even in such a short time. Molly Hooper came the most regularly, she appeared meek on the outside but had been heard telling John in no uncertain terms to shower as he smelled none too fresh and then to go for a walk to clear the thunderclouds from his brow. He had, rather surprisingly, quietly acquiesced. Mrs Hudson, a motherly older lady, had visited once, accompanied by DI Lestrade. She had fussed at Sherlock's bed sheets, patted John's hand and then sat quietly knitting whilst John and the DI, Greg, had discussed old cases, football games and some of Sherlock's more bizarre experiments. Greg had patted Sherlock's bicep as he left, but his intelligent eyes had seen more than just the man in the bed, a friend by his side. The final visitor, and in some ways the most alarming, was Mycroft Holmes. He always came in of an evening, precisely at 7 pm, briefcase and umbrella in hand. Sometimes he and John would read over the paperwork contained in that briefcase and if this were the case the staff knew to give the room a wide berth. Occasionally they would talk in muted tones, eyes glancing over to where Sherlock lay still in his bed and once they had sat in companionable silence, Mycroft reading the paper and John apparently lost in his own thoughts, fingertips idly tracing the back of Sherlock's hand.
"No. It's too late for that now." Sherlock gave Mrs Hudson one final squeeze before turning abruptly and marching from the flat, his coat giving one final dramatic billow before the front door closed behind him.
"Ready, John?" Sherlock's bright eyes fix on John, reading so much more than John's discomfort. Eyes that are a light, clear grey today, luckily miles away from the bright sky blue they had been when Sherlock lay 'dead' on the wet, uncaring pavement. John gives a brief nod, lips pinched together, jawline pronounced and strong, determination radiating from every pore before both men push the doors open, entering the cool sterility of the morgue.
Lestrade chuckles in to his drink and settles John’s coat more comfortably over his arm before wandering off to find Mycroft, a man who can always be relied upon for good conversation and company.
John rests his head back down, his free arm bent under his head, allowing him to still look at Sherlock. He moves his other hand lightly over Sherlock's exposed skin, the covers having slipped down to their waist, and mostly off Sherlock, at some point during their nap. His fingers trace the raised lines on Sherlock's back that he had noticed but not mentioned whilst Sherlock was in hospital. The scars are not large and are mostly white, well into their healing process but John knows whip marks when he sees them. At the hospital, he'd had to physically clench his teeth to keep the questions tumbling out. He'd decided to neither seek nor refuse information, but he won't avoid touching them either. John knows how he feels when people - lovers - avoid his scar and he doesn't want Sherlock to feel that way, doesn't want him to feel anything less than complete, anything less than ..... Loved. John remembers the beautiful expanse of long, pale back Sherlock had flashed at Buckingham Palace and thinks that Sherlock's back is a different sort of beautiful now. It shows who Sherlock is: a survivor. Sherlock's body is lithely muscled, defined and elegant, a pleasure to watch in motion and a joy to study at rest. John trails his fingers over the muscles of Sherlock's shoulder before moving to the curve of his bicep. Even in slumber, Sherlock's strength is undeniable and John feels his heart quicken at the thought of being able to explore that body and strength more thoroughly.
John moans against Sherlock’s shoulder, Sherlock’s casual use of profanity far more arousing than he had expected it to be. On loose limbs the men stand and wobble the short distance to the bath, they arrange themselves as before, John in front and resting lightly on Sherlock. Neither man speaks, after all, there’s nothing that needs to be said.
“Do you want a drink before bed?” John busies himself moving the cups around, suddenly nervous now they are back in their bedroom.  “ We could have a nice cup of tea.  Or there’s coffee, though that’s probably not the best idea this close to…..”  He forces himself to shut up, hands still busy reorganising the cups.
Sherlock awaits them just outside their living room, his face lit with a smile that is appearing more and more frequently.  With dexterous digits he straightens out Rosie’s wings and takes a step back to see her costume, fingers steepled in front of his lips as his gaze sweeps from her head to her toes; taking in the golden crown, the yellow and black striped long-sleeved top, the matching layered tutu, golden sparkly tights and shiny black shoes.  In her fist Rosie clutches a black and gold wand that she playfully waves at Sherlock, her wide smile showing off the six baby teeth that adorn her pink gums.
“Our way.”
“Yeah, I know, but I wasn't great beforehand either.  Helping you put this place back together, making it my home again, was cathartic for me; it was like putting my life back together.  That was when I decided that Rosie comes first, no matter what.”
Sherlock queries, eyes darting over John’s face, trying to read what he may mean.
"No need." Sherlock nuzzles into John's neck, the words mumbled. "The experience of tasting you as you ejaculated was more than enough to precipitate my own orgasm."
Taking a cleansing breath, John licks his lips and settles more comfortably on Sherlock's legs.
Even with that knowledge, the sudden flare of heat in Sherlock’s eyes and the wicked turn of his lips causes John’s breath to stutter and his heart to pound. Anticipation bubbling through his veins like champagne.
Now, Sherlock is hoping that his body will behave itself, or at least relax enough for him to have a simple shower.  Alas, it is not to be.  Sighing deeply, Sherlock strips off and steps inside the shower cubicle, turning the water on he enjoys the cold spray against his over-heated skin as the water heats up.  Once more, he takes himself in hand and allows his mind to drift back to John.  Specifically, the way he looks whilst moving, whilst smiling, the sound of his voice, the touch of his hand.  Sherlock barely manages to stifle his groan of completion, belatedly remembering how clearly he’d heard John humming in the shower less than fifteen minutes earlier.  The rest of his shower is conducted in a much more relaxed manner.  He dries off as throughly as possible before donning his clothes - slightly damp.  Just as John had predicted.
Per’aps Mr ‘olmes will stop worrying about you and spend some time making sure ‘e gets better.”
“Make me feel it love, let me feel you move.’
You know it’s not true.
“Physical contact is widely deemed advisable during recovery and has many proven links to speed of recovery.”  Sherlock states, his inflection falling flat as if quoting from some medical text and John concedes that is probably precisely what he is doing.
Sherlock moves closer to John’s bed but keeps a careful distance between them, unsure of how John will feel about waking up in Sherlock’s arms.
“Hello, sweetheart.  You two look like you’ve been having fun!”  John grins, happy to see his little girl so joyful.
Sherlock settles more comfortably against his pillows, pulling John in closer, making their conversation more intimate.
“Stay.” John requests once more, his speech barely more than a breath, before he finally falls back to sleep. His hand still safe in Sherlock’s.
Sherlock flicks onto the second page of the document. A photograph shows a heavily scarred male in a well cared for, but clinical, room. Machines monitoring his well-being and delivering pain-killers are linked to his body. John winces and looks away.
“John?”
“I thought it through - as much as I am able to currently - and I do not want to go back to Mary, in all likelihood, ever.
Their bodies rock in tandem, a new dance that they instinctively know.  Wrapping one hand firmly around the back of Sherlock's neck, John draws him into a deep kiss, before twining their fingers once more.  It's an innocent gesture but the feeling of Sherlock's long, strong fingers wrapped around his makes John desperately yearn to feel them elsewhere; in his hair, on his skin, wrapped around him, deep inside him.  Anywhere.  Everywhere. The accompanying images pull out a long moan from deep within his chest, a primitive sound that causes both of their grips to tighten.  Sherlock's eyes have flashed open, only a slim ring of bright colour remains around his pupil, all his  intense focus now on John.
Sherlock rolls off with a huff, long limbs limp, his arm raised above his head, curls damp and dishevelled. John leans over him to steal a kiss before sliding off the bed and going to get the flannel.
“Thanks.
“John?  She’ll be ok, Mrs Hudson will look after her.”
Sherlock hears the sharp gasp of pleasure and surprise, notices how John's eyes fill with tears of joy and he kisses John again, turning the gasp into a moan.  Slowly, he traces the outline of John's mouth with his tongue before gently deepening the kiss once again, one hand cupping John's cheek, the other firm at the nape of his neck.  Their bodies now move together, dancing once more.
"This feels faintly ludicrous, Sherlock," John mutters as he shuffles over to the sink, filling the bowl with warm water.
The click of the office door rouses John from his shock. He grips the pot more firmly in his left hand, staring at the door of Molly's bathroom. Squaring his shoulders, he marches over to Sherlock, holding out his hand in a silent request for the key.
The hold on his body tightens, he feels the fleeting touch of Sherlock's forehead against his sweaty shoulder, and the way the thumb at his nape pauses before rubbing more firmly. "I am sorry John. I never meant to cause you pain."
“Gethin Hughes.
The arrival of a nurse stops John and Sherlock from getting too lost in their thoughts and the fact that he is there to remove some of the cumbersome machines goes a long way to making Sherlock less resentful about having his comfortable silence with John interrupted.
Say you will
He is surprised at the door by Sherlock handing him a freshly brewed mug of tea.  He smiles his thanks as he toes his shoes off, refusing to relinquish his tea even as he struggles to get out of his coat.  He sighs, contented, as he sinks gratefully in to his chair, stretching his feet out towards the low fire burning in the hearth.
Opening his mouth to deliver a scathing retort, Sherlock halts when the hand on his shoulder tightens in warning, followed by a sharp ‘Gentlemen, please.’  He forces himself to take a few, deep breaths and only when he believes he can speak dispassionately, does he do so.
I do not waffle John. - SH
The man talks away at high speed and John can do nothing but watch and try not to look too ignorant. The man, Doctor Schmidt he presumes, is of an age with Sherlock. Tall, but powerfully built, his green eyes flash with merriment as he looks between John and Sherlock. His hair is of a similar shade to John's, but worn much longer, the tips just brushing his shoulders. He is impeccably turned out in shirt, trousers and tie and John can't help but feel shabby next to him.
"I meant..." Sherlock hesitates before continuing. "Between us. I know what I want. I want for you to move into my room and sleep in my bed every night. I want to continue exploring your body, and for you to explore mine. I want to continue to work cases with you and argue with you. I want ...... I
“Morning, John.”  The words are quietly spoken, Sherlock’s lips lightly brushing against John’s as he leans in for another kiss.
For those who are wondering skiddies is the wonderful term my ex-army buddies use to describe their underwear......
“Can I have the first shower, Sherlock?”  He calls out when he can’t locate Sherlock in any of their shared spaces.
"Is that your medical opinion, Doctor Watson?" Sherlock queries. He tries to keep his voice serious as befits their overall situation, but John's sudden humour is contagious and a chuckle escapes him.
"Why so surprised, John? I'm untouched, not untouchable. Well, I say untouched, but that's not completely true." Sherlock pauses, letting his words wash over John. "I've touched myself, of course." He tilts his head and holds John's avid stare unapologetically. He removes one long hand from John chest and allows it to trail over his own neck, along his collarbone before drifting it over the undamaged part of his torso, settling his fingertips in the trail of sparse hair that peeks over the waistband of his pyjamas.
"I think I'll turn in early, get some rest whilst I can. I'm sure you'll be hassling the doctors for your release papers at sunrise so I'd better make sure I'm awake enough to pay attention to their instructions."  John stretches and stifles a yawn before grabbing his pyjamas from the shared wardrobe in the room.
"Hello Sherlock, John." Molly smiles up at them. She's her usual self, hair pulled back with tendrils escaping or fluffing around her head like the soft feathers on a baby bird. Her white lab coat sits open over a fluffy jumper that even John has to fight not to cringe at. She chatters away inanely about various investigations she has already completed today and about a night out she has planned with some of the girls from work and leads them into her small office.
John trails off before shakily wetting his lips.
Sherlock waits, silent, for twenty minutes before he leaves John’s side.
"Lechner, was a very private man. Any records he kept were in code, he rarely visited his own house in daylight hours and even his ex-wife said that she barely knew him at all." A pause, John knows that Sherlock is hoping he will be able to finish off where this line of thought is going, but he can't, not tonight. "I was able to ascertain that he frequently rented out properties here in Thayatal National Park. I triangulated their positions and they all centred on that precise part of land. I was able to see from the map, that you kindly provided, where the water sources were, and that, added to the information the dirt from the soles of Lechner's shoes and the contents of the fireflies stomachs provided, was enough to narrow the search right down. Although, we could still have been searching all night if you hadn't brought my attention to the flying females surrounding me."
Crouching down, John leans over the body slightly to get a better look at the victim's features and attire. His gaze roams from the tip of the victim's head to the sole of his shoes.
to, taste the semen from your cock."
“I suspect that was purposeful, John.  To see which people are really committed and which people are merely making noise.  Although, I still fail to see how useful our being here is. This is something Mycroft could observe through his network of security cameras or, if he wants the more human touch, by sending one of his own people.  Someone whose face isn't known.”
“John? It seems I underestimated your tenacity.” Mary moves so that she stands between Sherlock and John, blocking their view of each other.
“Of course.
John's offer to reciprocate in the bathroom had been met with a long and lazy kiss, broken only when Sherlock's eyes flashed open and he suddenly yelled 'Anderson!' much in the manner of Archimedes yelling 'Eureka!' Scant seconds had passed before Sherlock was scrambling out of the bath and rushing into the bedroom, leaving John giggling in the bath.
His kisses trail down onto John’s chest, paying brief attention to the scar on his shoulder, before dipping down to suck a nipple into his mouth.
Magnussen walks slowly to the visitor's chair, taking time to wipe it down with a cloth from his suit jacket pocket, before sitting down and arranging his long limbs into a relaxed, but oddly refined, sprawl.
“You are his wife.”  Sherlock asserts, the contempt he feels for her colouring his voice.
Lowering himself John breathed deeply, concentrating on keeping his muscles loose. He gasped as the tip of Sherlock's cock entered him, he could feel it stretching him, heating him from within.  He wanted nothing more than to sink completely onto Sherlock but knew that they would both come too quickly.
“Except?”
"John? I know about Mary ....... that she shot Sherlock." Mrs Hudson continues to stir the gravy that is just starting to simmer on the cooker top. "Mr Holmes and that nice Detective Inspector came and told me a few days ago. They offered to pay for me to go and stay at my sister's until all the dust settles." She shakes her head before turning her head to look at John, her kindly face creased with concern and worry. "I told them no." She removes the gravy from the heat and goes to sit opposite John at her small kitchen table. Reaching out, she holds his clasped hands between her own. "I'm not leaving my boys when they need me the most."
“No.  There’s no-one due to be here who could be considered a security risk or a likely candidate for blackmail.”
"When? There
“You really are an idiot, John.”
"Right, Mr Holmes, this needs to come out." His nurse now has on surgical gloves and is gently manipulating the skin around the cannula insertion site. Sherlock clenches his teeth against the dull burn of pain and the constant chatter but is thankful for the distraction the nurse's one sided conversation is providing. "And, here we go." The cannula is slid free in one smooth move and Sherlock feels the relief instantly. "We're going to start looking at lowering your morphine levels, try and keep the withdrawal symptoms as minimal as we can. I see from your records that you have some experience of opiates before, so I'm sure you understand this necessity." Sherlock nods slowly, eyes flicking over to John, gauging his reaction. John looks unhappy at the reminder of Sherlock's less than shining history, but there is no disgust on his face.
Gethin explains further at John’s confused look.
"Feet together John." Sherlock could never understand why people thought John chunky or slow, looking at him now all he could see was a compact, trim body, very much in the prime of life, literally fighting fit. It must be all that infernal knitwear!
“Oh, Sherlock, love.”
“Gel?”
The ride back to the hotel is companionable and Sherlock uses the opportunity to update John on his discoveries.
“Well, when you put it that way…”  John grins. “Look, I’m refreshed now.  I’m going to help, like it or not.”
"Was this part of your plan, John?"  Sherlock drags in a deep breath and clutches John tightly.  "Talk me to an early death?"  Sherlock's growled words are accompanied by the scratch of his fingernails up John's back.
“I’m ok.” John attempts to reassure him but Sherlock can’t shake off the feeling that he has missed something of great importance. “Stay. Please.”
Come home if not convenient. - SH
"Don't pretend like you don't care, Mycroft." John is looking directly at Mycroft, meeting cold eyes and a pugnacious chin straight on. "England may benefit from Sherlock and me working together again, but don't think you can hide your true reason."
"And you accuse me of being the romantic." John huffs, his eyes swimming with tears. He leans into Sherlock before pulling Sherlock towards him. Still wary of Sherlock's chest wound, John engulfs him in an embrace, whispering against his neck. "I'm amenable."
John finally feels like he can participate in the conversation without looking like an utter imbecile.  Conversations with Sherlock are often like walking on quicksand, but this one has been more challenging than usual.
Sherlock squeezes some of John’s shower gel into his palm and runs his hands over John’s skin, gently massaging to create a foam, enjoying the contour of John’s body as he washes him.  He has always appreciated the way that John smells; a mix of his natural scent and his choice of toiletries that together make an olfactory portrait that is unmistakable.
This story was supposed to be a min. of approx. 20,000 words, it is much closer to 34,000 words - hopefully those extra words did not disappoint!
John swaps hands, feeling slightly sheepish and more than slightly cross with himself, and returns the firm reassuring grip, glancing briefly over at an apparently brooding Sherlock.
The chaps over those close-fitting jeans are inspired, they frame your arse so perfectly.
The amazing Lockedinjohnlock has spent MANY hours wrestling this chapter into shape ready for recording. I really don't have the words in which to express my gratitude to her! She's worth her weight in gold, gemstones and chocolate! If I could I would send Sherlock and John over to express my gratitude!
Alert a nurse afterwards and they’ll beep me if I’m not nearby, I’ll come and change it for you.
She had been far from the first person who had shown interest in John since Sherlock’s death but she had been the only one who had received more than an appreciative look from him.
John ends the call and taps his phone against his lips, contemplating what Molly has told him when Sherlock returns, tucking one arm between John and the sofa so that he is able to wrap his arms around John's waist.
"Jesus Christ Sherlock! I know I should have just left but the door was open and I just couldn't help myself. I saw you standing there, water running over your body and you just looked so fucking gorgeous! I just couldn't walk away." John's words tumbled out in a breathless rush but he met Sherlock's gaze defiantly, fists clenched at his sides but his shoulders squared, unwilling to back down from the battle.
"Oh, I think this is precisely the type of experiment I will enjoy, I won't even complain about the mess."  He giggles at the blush on Sherlock's cheeks, giggling more when he realises he is blushing too.  The giggles stop abruptly as cool fingers brush over his nipple, the intimacy of the moment is heady.  John originally had every intention of undressing Sherlock too, but he finds he is too lost in sensation to co-ordinate the fine motor movements required.
John let out the breath he hadn't even realised he'd been holding.  Smiling in relief John realised that this was something he could do; it would be hard for him to open up to Sherlock, to let him in emotionally, but he would. If it meant he could be back by Sherlock's side he would talk for hours, days, months.... "I think this discussion calls for a nice fire and a strong drink. You go check on the fire whilst I tidy up out here and sort us out some drinks."
"What? Hair gems?" John holds up a hand, silently imploring for more time before Sherlock fills in the gaps. "Before ..... Before I started working with you again," John deliberately avoids mentioning the time when he was still trying to make things work with Mary. "You worked a case to do with stolen hair decorations. Diamond stars, I think. Belonged to, hmmm," John's brow briefly furrows again before he sits up, swinging his legs off the edge of the bed, his face clearing. "Empress Elisabeth of Austria. Hang on, wasn't she Queen of Hungary? Whatever, doesn't matter..... The stars were stolen whilst en route to Vienna after being on display in the British Museum, right? You tracked them and returned them to the Austrian Government. I remember seeing it on the news, they tried to get you to wear the hat again!"
“Because then you would return to Baker Street.
“You’re able to shower now.
At that moment Sherlock heard a noise, almost like a groan being stifled.
"It's not,". John tilts his head back, resting his head lightly against Sherlock's shoulder.  "But it will be." He turns in Sherlock's loose embrace, gazing up at him.  "Oh love, you're exhausted.  Let's get some toast into you and the last of today's painkillers and head to bed."
Turning to follow them into the living room, John's gaze is arrested by the sight of Sherlock walking down the stairs. He is wrapped in a sheet and John barely has time to wonder where the sheet came from before he takes in the state of Sherlock's hair. It is quite obviously sex-hair, the curls springing every which way, clearly having been pulled and tugged; and if John can see that, he is damn sure that Mycroft won't miss it. More mortifying still is the faint pink colouring of Sherlock's usually pale throat; the after effects of John's stubble rubbing at the tender skin during their lovemaking. Sherlock meets his embarrassed gaze evenly, wearing the signs of their encounter proudly. Walking to stand in front of John, he raises one elegant hand and smooths down John's hair before tracing the line of John's jaw with delicate fingers. John leans into the touch and lifts his chin, silently asking for a kiss. He is amazed when that kiss is happily bestowed, in full view of their visitors. He becomes momentarily lost in the kiss, only becoming aware of his surroundings at the sound of a throat being loudly cleared. Sherlock leans into John a moment longer, apparently savouring the stolen intimacy, before gliding into the living room. John remains in the hallway a second or two longer before straightening his shoulders and following him.
“Why did he confide in you? And why did you choose this particular weekend to tell me how you felt?”
Sherlock shakes the suds off his hands, before drying them on a towel and rejoining John and Rosie on the sofa.  The dreaded programme has finished and he is just in time to hear the bedtime story being read, he smiles down at Rosie when she snuggles in, warmth spreading through him when John also moves closer.  Rosie’s eyelids are drooping before the end of the story and John decides to forego her bath, Rosie complains when John picks her up to take her upstairs, reaching out for Sherlock to follow; something he does so willingly.
, as John keeps being reminded.
“Good morning, Doctor Watson.” Gethin is almost unbearably cheerful in what feels like the very early hours to a sleep deprived Sherlock.
"At some point you are going to have to. Stop being so juvenile about it. You've done it before." Sherlock kept his voice light and teasing too, unconsciously mirroring John.
Sherlock's mouth formed a small 'O' in surprise at the last two deductions.  He had always been aware of John's physique and fitness but now he seemed fully conscious of the effects of them on him, the upcoming intimacy of dancing heightening each sense. His breath hitched as his eyes travelled across John's broad shoulders, a barely perceptible tightness in the left, down onto a chest that was still heaving from the quick race upstairs - must check John's fitness level, taking an inordinate amount of time for breathing to recover - the fit of John's shirt emphasising each breath. Tailored trousers only served to focus Sherlock's attention more on the natural strength of the man before him. Firm, strong hips and waist, deceptively flat stomach - why do you hide this away under jumpers John? You have a beautiful, amazing, powerful body. - Muscular legs, capable of running long distances without faltering. Sherlock's mind raced at the physique in front of him.  Images of John naked and breathless suddenly flooded his brain.  John's strong legs and arms bracing his weight as he thrust into Sherlock, alternated with those of John flat on his back, arms held above his head, legs wrapped about Sherlock as Sherlock pounded into him. Both men sweating and lost in each other, the desire palpable, words unneeded as they allowed their bodies to speak more eloquently than either could ever manage.  Sherlock felt the need flame into his stomach and took a sudden step back from John.  Tearing his eyes away from John he fixed his focus on the fireplace.  He needed to distance himself, needed to clear the fog of desire away so he could think clearly.  Act rationally, not do anything to damage his friendship with John. John. His John. Sherlock slowly ran his hands over his face before running them through his hair, the everyday motions helping to ground him.
And then in moderate levels, just enough to show up in urine tests, not enough to impair me or cause addiction.”
Still he teases, only paying attention to the head of John’s cock, his hand wrapped around John’s shaft, effectively stopping John from thrusting into his mouth.
He stretches but stops short with a  gasp as pain tears through his right bicep.

A short note today.  The text in italic represents John dreaming.  Enjoy Xx
“I know.”  John puts his mug down and looks towards Sherlock, finally making eye contact.  “I guess it’s just that this is the first time I’ve left her overnight since I started sorting myself out.  I know she’ll be fine but ….”  John leaves the rest of the sentence hanging.
“Sherlock, you don't know what room he is in.”  Mycroft’s hands flutter briefly at his sides, the only indication of his frustration with his brother.
"Power play John.  Do keep up. Pointless, he has loads. Anything else?"  Sherlock  purposefully kept his answers short, forcing John to expand them in his head, to make sense of them. To ask more to fill in the details.
The army doctor in him immediately recognising them for what they are, whip marks that were most-likely inflicted during Sherlock’s time ‘away’, if the amount of fading is anything to go by.
John can see in his peripheral vision that Greg now only has eyes for Mycroft, his eyes searching the other man's face. Whatever he sees there causes his shoulders to lose the tension they had gained during Sherlock's speech and he gathers Mycroft's hand between his own. Colour graces Mycroft's cheeks but he holds Greg's gaze, placing his free hand over Greg's. A simple smile is exchanged, an understanding gathered and then the hands are loosened and both men return their attention to the room.
Hi!  I'm back!  So sorry for the long break between chapters.....  This chapter starts immediately where the last one left off so you might want to go back and refresh your memory.
“Are you sure you’re okay with this?” John queries, stepping closer to Sherlock, his thumb rubbing distracting circles on the back of Sherlock’s hand. “Because if you’re not, we can tell Mycroft to shove it.”
"And the 'not gay' thing?" Sherlock asks, head tilted to the side.
"Me? But you said... You said you were married to your work. And you've never shown any sexual interest in anyone. How was ...." John stopped speaking when Sherlock's large hand pressed his hand more firmly against his cock.
Despite her whispered words Lestrade is awake, and almost instantly alert.
"Then, tell me." John asks quietly.
….isn’t real.  That John is just acting the role of caring lover because he finds it easier to maintain the facade rather than to risk making a mistake when it matters.  Staying in role makes the lie easier to maintain; Sherlock can hardly blame him, he has long-accused John of being a poor liar.
He broke the contact, moving his body lower, dropping light kisses as he went. Sherlock's hands were still in his hair; he loved the feeling, it was like Sherlock wanted constant contact. Finally his mouth was over Sherlock's cock, he breathed in the musky smell of sex, his mouth salivating. Delicately he licked the fluid off the tip, closing his eyes as he savoured the taste.  God this man even tasted good! He could feel the hands in his hair tighten their grip and felt a gentle push back towards the erect cock, he allowed himself to be guided. He pressed his tongue in one long firm stroke along the length of Sherlocks cock, it felt like rock wrapped in silk against his tongue. With a firm hand he held Sherlock's erection, again running his tongue along its length, listening to the groan from his lover. Again and again he licked, each time in a slightly different way, sometimes short licks, sometimes longer licks, listening carefully to Sherlock's groans and gasps, discovering which sensations caused the most pleasure. Transferring his attention to the tip he lightly ran his tongue over the sensitive head, swirling it around the base of the bulbous head. Sherlock gave a long, deep groan which sent shudders of pleasure through them both.  John began to move his hand along the long shaft, slowly but firmly, his tongue still swirling, darting occasionally into the slit to taste the pre-come pooling there. Finally he took Sherlock's erection into his mouth, the movement causing Sherlock to tremble violently. John knew that Sherlock was close to the edge of his self control but he had to have him in his mouth, he needed to taste him, to feel him inside.
This time it’s John’s turn to tremble, it’s only brief but it’s enough to reassure Sherlock that he is not the only one experiencing strong emotions about what is happening between them.
The memory of a cold winter's night spent in a Cornish bed and breakfast comes to Sherlock's mind.  Most of the guesthouses had been closed for the season and they'd ended up in a cold room with one bed, no heating and mould creeping along the rotting skirting boards. A storm had blown in and they'd lost the light in the room too.  They'd ended up lying close together, sharing body heat and discussing old cases until John had finally drifted off.  Sherlock had remained awake, listening to the sound of the waves crashing on the rocks and savouring the sensation of John's soft exhalations against his skin.  He'd watched the first rays of dawn as they'd made their way through the window touch John's skin and had had to link his fingers together so that he would resist the temptation to follow their path.
It’s history now, the same as his own gunshot scar and John makes a conscious effort to move his focus away.
As the front door closes, John tugs Sherlock up the stairs, laughing as Sherlock clutches at his sheet, not wanting to risk falling over it in their haste. Giggling, they fall through the door of the bedroom, clutching at each other as they go. Sherlock's large hands sneak under John's loose t-shirt and John gasps at their coldness. He places his own hands over them, smaller but strong, and rubs the material over the pale skin, trying to warm them up.
He laughs, looking pointedly at John’s arm.
I hope you enjoy the newest offering!
“Why does everyone keep lying to me?” The words are quiet, lacking their earlier steel.
John feels so warm and tight and Sherlock genuinely worries he will come before he has even been fully inside John.
"Sherlock!" John snapped out in warning.
"So what do I do?" Sherlock's voice broke. "I could risk everything and lose him, or I could stay quiet and at least have his friendship."
A questing hand reaches up to the pillow and John shoves his own hand under the pillow, searching until it closes over the bottle of lubrication. Opening it, he squeezes a generous amount onto Sherlock's fingers, his own body beginning to tremble in anticipation. He shivers at the gentle glide of Sherlock's hand over his thigh, gasps at its touch against his balls. Sherlock rubs tenderly over his perineum, familiarising John with his touch, even as he laves John's cock. Sherlock takes John in deeper as he slides one long finger into John; John's done this much to himself but it feels more intense when he is not in control of the touch, when he can't second-guess what is coming next. His hips rock of their own accord, deepening his contact with both Sherlock's fingers and mouth. A fine sweat lies over his skin and he is hugely grateful that they have kicked the duvet off at some point in the proceedings. John lifts his head to look down his body at Sherlock and groans at the sight that meets him; eyes of a bright sea-green ring around blown pupils gaze up at him and wet, dark pink lips surround him.
"Good god John, this is even more than I ever dreamed of, and believe me my dreams are exquisite! But seeing you here like this, being with you like I have been, the dreams weren't even close! You are so gorgeous; golden skinned like honey, soft like silk and strong like steel. Ever the enigma."  John could feel Sherlock's breath ghosting over the skin of his backside, his breath hitching with desire, he groaned aloud when firm hands massaged into his bum cheeks, spreading them apart. His body jolting in shock when he felt Sherlock's tongue sweep over his entrance, stilling until John relaxed again. "You even taste wonderful John. Please, let me do this for you."
them.  The idea of a physical relationship - a sexual relationship - without that, is almost abhorrent to me.  Very few people have been willing to put up with me long enough for that; and just because they can put up with me, doesn’t mean I can put up with them.”  He finishes with a wry smile, attempting to lift the serious mood.
"Fake."
"Feel better now, my love?" John whispers, nuzzling the gently curling hair behind Sherlock's ear. Sherlock nods, thankful that John instinctively knows what had just happened. John's arms tighten ever so slightly and Sherlock shifts until he is more comfortable then lies still, listening to the easy rhythm of John's breathing. The comfortable silence between them stretches on and gradually, Sherlock becomes aware that he is drifting back off into much needed sleep. His gunshot wound still aches but the wounds to his soul no longer throb, his tears cathartic.
He eats quietly too, knowing that John will spit it out sooner or later.
“Very noble.”
you believe I’m dangerous? Shooting you was too subtle a hint?” She mocks.
With a deliberate tilt of his head, Sherlock drifts his hands down to his pyjama ties, glorying in the way John's focus switches from his neck to his hands, torn as to which area he wants to look at. Slowly, Sherlock loosens the ties, letting the knot unravel, an unnecessary but enjoyable tease. John's focus is now unwaveringly fixed on Sherlock's hands, his lower lip sucked firmly into his mouth. His upper body unconsciously leaning towards Sherlock and his hands still tightly knotted in the blanket prevent him from reaching out. With a final tug, the drawstring unravels and Sherlock allows his pyjama bottoms to slide down his legs, closing his eyes briefly as the material strokes his skin. Meeting John's enamoured gaze, Sherlock hooks his thumbs into the top of his boxer shorts and starts to push them down, heat flooding his being when John's focus skitters down his body to the slowly revealed stretch of pale skin. Sherlock bends briefly to move the material over the burgeoning swell of his erection before letting the boxers drop to the floor, kicking them to one side. He stands proud before John, exulting in his obvious approval.
Magnussen’s words of unsubtle threat hang heavy in the stale air of the hospital, almost visible and, judging by the grim expression on John’s face, Sherlock is not the only one struggling against the foulness Magnussen’s visit has left behind.
“Good; because I won’t.”  Sherlock's face is fierce for a moment before he wilts slightly.  “In all honesty, John, I’m not prepared for anything more than we have already done, not until I’ve had time to process it all.  Our kisses … the embraces…have been almost overwhelming, there’s so much to catalogue, up here.”  He pulls one hand out of John’s clasp to gesture at his own head; his Mind Palace.  “But I want to do that whilst I’m lying in your arms, or you in mine, in that oversized bed.  I think better when you are with me.”
“I knew John would need to know who shot me, that he wouldn't stop until he found out so I tried to set up a scenario where he could discover the truth in a controlled manner. I truly believed I could get Mary to show remorse and admit to needing help if she was in the right setting.  John needed to witness it for himself, it was the only way he would understand.”
Sherlock grips John’s hand more tightly. “She can sometimes engage my mind but she has never managed to engage my mind
“He’s a strong man, Sherlock and a stubborn arse on top of that, he’ll pull through.”  Lestrade reassures, altering his hold on Sherlock’s shoulder to become that of a reassuring pat. Once again Sherlock finds the friendly gesture comforting rather than its usual source of irritation.  “You need to stay strong too.”
(Approximately a month ago. There was a break-in overnight. I alerted the police this morning when I saw the door was ajar.)
A few hours later Mycroft is interrupted in his perusal of a document he rests on his knees by a soft ‘Mr Holmes.’
Back at Baker Street, Sherlock resists the temptation to pace but his emotions are too near to the surface, too
“A dirty weekend away you mean.”   Sherlock retorts, unreasonably hurt that John is sharing with him how he would win over the woman of his dreams.  He too turns to gaze out of the window, hoping the action will prevent John from reading too much in his expression; something he has become annoyingly adept at since moving back in with Rosie.
“Just the bees?”  John asks, biting on his lower lip, picking at the weave on the picnic blanket.
“I have been informed that I flat-lined on the operating table.”
“You’re not listening, Sherlock.”  John turns to face Sherlock, waiting until Sherlock meets his gaze.  “This is someone I would want to live with, in whatever capacity, for the rest of my life; until I am old and grey…”  He smiles at Sherlock’s snort. “Ok. Greyer. Someone who stimulates me, mind and soul.  Sex doesn’t have to be part of it, as I said before, sex doesn’t necessarily mean intimacy.”
A ruggedness that he feels will work well with the whole cowboy look he has planned for tonight.  With a final glance at his reflection he dries off thoroughly, leaving his hair sticking out in random directions, before pulling his dressing gown on, gathering up his dirty clothes, depositing them in the laundry basket with his wet towel and leaving the room.  He is barely out of the hallway before Sherlock nips in to the still warm bathroom, still humming away to himself, John grins widely in reaction and jogs up to his room.
“Yeah, course.
“Nathan and I were too caught up in the whirl of hormones and the need for instant gratification.
John turns to hand them to Sherlock but stops short at the sight of him unbuttoning his shirt; the white bandage is stark against Sherlock's chest in the bright light of the midday sun. The rest of the skin on his chest is unblemished by scars, only the delicate kiss of a constellation of freckles and moles is apparent. John watches, lips parted, as Sherlock slips the material from his shoulders, carelessly (though no less accurately) throwing the shirt into the nearby washing basket. He flexes his shoulders before raising his arms above his head, luxuriating in the first stretch in his bedroom since being shot nearly a month ago. The muscles on his torso and in his arms flex and move and John is mesmerised by the sight. Sherlock looks so slight in his suits, almost like a strong wind could blow him over, but that is far from the truth. Even after enforced bed rest, Sherlock retains his defined musculature. It's not bulky; rather, it is streamlined and elegant. John thinks it's something akin to a dancer or swimmer, although he has never seen Sherlock participate in either (the gentle moves of the waltz he taught John could not account for the muscle definition). John has seen Sherlock in many states of undress but something about seeing him partially clothed, relaxed and ever-so-slightly rumpled, sitting on the bed they will eventually share, turns John's nervousness into something warmer. He smiles when Sherlock turns to look at him, his full lips quirked up on one side, his eyes soft and inviting. Sherlock holds one hand out to John in a silent gesture for John to join him.
The lead dancer, in particular, had such control, such presence.”
"Sorry. Did that hurt? I'm almost done." Sherlock felt John's strong fingers carefully tape butterfly stitches over his cut cheek and found himself leaning into the warmth of John's hand, moving quickly away when John nervously cleared his throat. Damn his treacherous body!
"Good news, I see John." Sherlock observes, his suit jacket has been exchanged for his blue dressing gown and his feet are now bare.
“Ok there, love?  You seem miles away.”  John slowly releases Sherlock’s hand, sliding his palm beneath Sherlock’s open coat and suit jacket, around Sherlock’s back until it rests, warm and distracting, just above the waistband of Sherlock’s trousers.
“You weren't meant to get hurt,” Sherlock’s voice cracks on the final word, taking a deep breath, he ignores the pain in his chest, determined to speak, to explain. “I know you believe I am less than human, a machine; I’m not, not where you are involved.” Tears start to stream down his cheeks, unchecked, his attention solely on John.
"You..... fantasised .... about me?" John runs his tongue over dry lips, his breath escaping in broken gasps. He knows it's an inane question, but the idea that Everyday John Watson is the stuff of Sherlock's fantasies is overwhelming.
Slowly, the two men make their way into the living room and it's not until John has Sherlock settled in his chair that he realises where he is. He straightens and waits for the anger and despair to wash over him ....... and waits a little more ....... long seconds pass and nothing happens. No anger, no sense of betrayal, only the warmth of Sherlock's body lingers against his skin and the soft sound of Sherlock's breathing fills his ears. He allows himself a small smile and looks over at Sherlock, surprising him in the midst of studying John. Whatever Sherlock sees, he approves of and John watches as he physically relaxes.
"John. I love you. I think I always have. I meant to tell you, always, but the time never seemed right. I was going to be selfish and play it off as being the love of one friend for another..... " Sherlock draws another breath of the calming scent of John. "And you are that, the very best of men and it's an honour to call you my friend." He moves so that his forehead is no longer touching John's and meets John's eyes steadily. "I, William Sherlock Scott Holmes, love you, John Hamish Watson, with all of my heart, brain and body and will continue to do so until my dying day. If, against all scientific reason, there is some kind of afterlife I will love you in that as well."
“You need my permission?”
"Tea, tablet, biscuits.  Doctor's orders." John smiles down at him, his eyes sparkle and he looks years younger.  Whatever Kalvinder has told him has worked wonders at clearing away his tension.
"I will," John asserts. "Just before we see her. I don't want reminders of her constantly haunting me."
Sherlock studies John, grey-blue eyes darting to and fro as he observes the way John is sitting - outwardly relaxed but some tension about the shoulders, growing more noticeable the longer he observes; the way John is smiling - hopeful, earnest….. apprehensive; the way John is looking at him - again hopeful and apprehensive, like he thinks Sherlock will read something he will react badly to; the way the sunshine dances over his features - highlighting strong cheekbones that others ignore, the cleft in his chin, mobile lips that promise… irrelevant.  Sherlock snorts, annoyed at the direction his observations have taken him in and returns to the matter at hand.  He studies John once more, noting the way John’s gaze flicks hopefully to the view outside the window.
"When we were dancing you told me about the legend of other halves, about how we were all once split in two and how finding that other person completes us, makes us whole.  Well I've found that person. I found them years ago but I've been too afraid to say it out loud.  I found them the moment I walked into that lab at St. Barts all those years ago and met you.  I wish I'd told you sooner what you mean to me, Christ, I wish I could be sure you could hear me now."
"Since when are you concerned about my shoulder?"
“I could smell perfume when we entered, do you remember?” He waits for John to nod. “It was Claire de la Lune, the perfume that both Mary and Lady Smallwood favour. I presumed, erroneously as it turns out, that it was Lady Smallwood that was in the building. I went upstairs and saw someone, all in black, threatening a cowering Magnussen at gunpoint.”
“Of course -“
Sherlock remembers how pale Mycroft had looked when he'd found him last, how similar that look had been to when he'd lost Michael and then he recalls his dream. Of a careworn Mycroft, swearing to always be there for him, reminding him that he always has been. Then, for the first time, in a long time Sherlock allows himself to think of Michael's warm smile and loud laugh and of how Mycroft would flush at the sound but laugh along. He thinks of the two men wading into ponds with him to examine the wildlife, all three laughing at the shocked disbelief on his mother's face when they had trooped into the house, dripping pondweed and water everywhere. He remembers being included in their intimate ring giving ritual, the only witness other than the trees, remembering how strongly he'd wished they could be open about their relationship and the promises he'd made to only tell those he trusted utterly. He drifts slowly out of his thoughts, gradually becoming aware of John's hand around his, the soothing touch a balm to a still-troubled soul.
Before all the current problems with Mary had surfaced - when John had been trying to write off his doubts and worries about his impending marriage as the product of an over-active mind teemed with the abrupt return of a man he had believed dead and buried - John had worried how he would cope with quiet nights in with Mary, at the perceived boredom married life would inevitably bring. Now he knows it wasn't the quiet he was dreading, it was the quiet with
“Where the hell have you been?” His words are sharp, his voice a muted growl. To her credit the nurse doesn't wince or shy away.
He’s what I’m getting for Christmas.
me take care of you, John." He gives John no chance to react before he slides down John's body, trailing soft, open mouthed kisses against salty skin. John pants and clenches at the woollen pile; he is so desperately turned on that he aches, his lungs, his thighs, his cock. Sherlock's lips and tongue soothe and lave over a heaving chest, against trembling thighs before he finally, God, _finally_, turns his attention to John's cock.
"Sherlock, I'm not going to hold your bloody hand!" Despite the serious words, John was still smiling, his mobile features soft and relaxed.
Twenty minutes later, John's stomach is rumbling loudly. He is expecting room service to arrive any minute now but is wondering whether the food will arrive before Sherlock emerges from the bathroom. Sherlock has always been very thorough when bathing, taking his time, but John thinks this is something of a record. A knock at the door signals the arrival of his food and John lets the waiter in. The plates are uncovered and left on a small table and John gives the man a small tip before banging on the bathroom door on his way to the table.
Sherlock’s hand spasms against John’s cheek and the kiss pauses as Sherlock slides his other hand around to the nape of John’s neck, long fingers sliding up in to John’s hair.
"I thought you'd still be out with ......" Sherlock waved his hand vaguely in the air, trying to at least give the impression that he knew the current girlfriend's name.
Easing Sherlock carefully back onto the bed until he is lying flat, John chases his lips for a kiss. He lies parallel to Sherlock, his body flush against the long length of Sherlock's side. Leaning over, he rests his weight on his elbow and deepens the kiss, tilting Sherlock's chin with his free hand. Warm, full lips open beneath his, encouraging him in with a brief touch of wet tongue against his lower lip. John moans at the teasing touch, chasing the tongue with his own. The vibration of Sherlock's answering moan sweeps through John, igniting his nerves and sending a surge of heat to his groin. John's cock twitches with interest against Sherlock's hip and again, Sherlock moans, pushing up into the kiss and guiding John deeper into it with a firm hand at the back of his head.
"You know how I hate to repeat myself, John, but as I said, I never delete anything important. What you say .." Here Sherlock seems to hesitate a little, some of his confidence fading. "What you say, John, it's important.
"Mary, sorry, Ms Morstan," Greg corrects at John's wince, "Lived with her family in Coldwater, Michigan; leaving, as previously stated, at 18, to join the CIA. We know now that despite external appearances of wealth and privilege, Michael and Angela lived a life filled with abuse. School records show that her brother regularly attended classes with abrasions and contusions indicative of more severe wounds. When the authorities were involved, all injuries were explained by the family as being sports related. The school were in doubt of the findings but felt there was nothing more they could do.
Sorry, it's been a longish break between chapters, hopefully this will help make up for it.  3000+ words of hot loving coming at ya!
“We’ve come to move you to a new room but first I need a decision from you.
"Surely you can deduce that my love." John chuckled, nuzzling his nose deep into the soft skin of Sherlock's scrotum.
“No.” Sherlock reassures him, taking a moment to form his answer. “Most people you know are the usual mix; anxious, happy, introvert, extrovert.” He pauses, biting on the inside of his cheek. “And one high functioning sociopath.” He decides to take a risk. “That’s me by the way. Hello.”
"No, she doesn't know, Mrs Hudson." John clears his throat, glancing quickly over at Sherlock before continuing at a nod from him. "And I think it's best she doesn't know at this point. We can't predict her behaviour and unfortunately we can't just take her off the streets as we need to know what else she is involved in." John licks his lips and folds his hands in his lap, willing himself to remain calm.
Billy turns his keen eye on Sherlock, taking in with a quick glance more than many people would in five times the amount of time.
She’s lied about so much stuff…”
"Sherlock?"  John purposely kept his voice gentle but he still managed to surprise the man; he really had been lost in his mind palace.  John watched as Sherlock stacked a few more logs onto the fire, admiring the contrast of pale, long fingers against the dark wood.  John held out the glass of whiskey to Sherlock as he rose to standing, resisting the temptation to wrap his fingers over Sherlock's as the glass was taken. His gaze briefly met with Sherlock's before he looked to the fire again.  Seeing Sherlock so close after so long was an assault against John's self control.  He wanted nothing more than to guide Sherlock's lips to his own, to move their bodies together, to finally, finally be what they should have been all along..... But he knew they needed to talk, too much remained unspoken between them and if any relationship of theirs was to be a success then talk they must, and a lot!
"Most assuredly." Sherlock's voice is wicked and John feels the dark throb of it directly in his groin, his cock heating and filling from nothing more than a kiss and a few heated words. He knows in the depths of his soul, that Sherlock is going to consume him, devour him; and, God help him, he can't wait.
"Sherlock, I don't know the dance. How am I supposed to bloody lead?" Exasperation clear in John's voice.
"He doesn't want me Mrs Hudson." Sherlock finally turned to her, his face a ruin of emotion.  He could feel the tears streaking his cheeks, eyes bright, knew he must appear the image of a broken man. "He doesn't. Want. Me." The words were forced out between clenched teeth. On the utterance of them Sherlock felt the last of his self control break and he fell, shaking, to the floor.
