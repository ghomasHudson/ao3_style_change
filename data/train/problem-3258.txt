It had been different, this time. Worse. He'd never dreamed that before, hadn't known how to handle it. Memories he was used to by now, flashes of what his brain desperately fought to keep locked away, crawling out of the dark to attack him when he had to let his guard down in his sleep.
It was killing him. He didn't remember how it had felt. He just remembered what it had looked like, how it had sounded. The sounds were the worst. He never wanted to hear Cas like that again, the voice that usually filled him with warmth and
"Only getting a wet cloth, Cas", he soothed, leaning down to quickly press his lips to the angel's forehead in reassurance. "Gotta clean you up. And maybe...take quick care of this", he added as an afterthought, squirming to readjust the uncomfortable situation in his boxers.
"I...I can't speak for Dean in this, God knows I have no right", he says then, huffing lightly, "Damn, he'd probably kill me if he knew I'm telling you as much as I did, but...I want him to be happy, Cas. And I know that he needs you in his life", Sam tells him truthfully, noticing how Cas draws in a breath, "In what way I can't say, but...I'm just asking you..." Asking Cas to give Dean time sounds pathetic, considering how long this had already been going, but...to hell with it.
"I'm gonna touch you", he said as softly as possible, seeing Cas' eyes instantly go wide. "But just a finger", he added quickly.
"It was how he moved", Cas said, his gaze drifting off into nothingness, fighting not to recall the pictures his tongue was painting, "the way he smiled, how he...touched me. It was all wrong Dean, it was-"
He wanted to go there. He just needed to find that bit of bravery to ask for it. Maybe it would go wrong again. Cas was well aware of that possibility. But that fear would always stay, no matter how long he waited.
, okay? And if he did, like...hypothetically (hypothetical thinking, not actual thinking about hypothetical kissing, that is) it would definitely be weird, and not the best thing he can imagine, not the only thing he's ever wanted, because why should it be something he wants if it's not even something he thinks about??
"I don't love you because you're perfect, Dean." (Though he is to Cas, but that's beside the point.)
"C'mere." Dean waves him towards the bed, as gentle and inviting as possible without losing his hold on himself. "Come. Please."
He could see as much as hear how Cas took in a deep breath. There was silence for a long moment, too long for Dean's liking, and shit, perhaps he'd been too optimistic after all, perhaps it had been too much, perhaps he'd ruined it already by letting Cas sit through any of this, perhaps he should have insisted that Sam-
The angel in question stirred in his sleep, ripping Dean out of his deep thoughts. He could hear him whimper into his pillow, just pitiful sounds that Dean tried to soothe with his hands stroking Cas' arms where the angel had rolled into his side in his sleep.
Cas smiled, smoothing a hand through Dean's damp, disheveled hair before leaning down and pressing their mouths together once more, kissing him slow and deep. Eyes closed, lips still connected, he could feel how Dean's hand that wasn't furiously working his cock came up to blindly grasp for Cas' on his chest, linking their fingers in a death grip just a second before Dean broke the kiss on a gasp, his entire body arching off the bed before slumping down, slack and slightly trembling.
It's endearing, the way Dean obviously doesn't seem to be able to believe it, but it also serves to wake an uncomfortable feeling in Cas' gut. Was it just the suddenness of his own question that caught Dean off guard or could Dean really have been expecting him to say no? Or is it something else entirely? Perhaps he'd surprised himself by asking in the first place. It's not as if Cas has been expecting that question, now, or ever. He hadn't been sure Dean was the type for marriage. Or at least he hadn't thought Dean would take himself as the type for it.
'. He remembers that it had felt wrong to him, even asleep. Something telling him that this couldn't be real, because Cas would never do this, say these things. Not his Cas. But the anger and disappointment on that beautiful face had been so intense, his words -despite the sense of wrongness- sounded so true.
"Could we start with some kissing again?" Cas smiled back, still nervous but apparently a little more at ease. â€œI seem to really enjoy that. It makes it a lot easier to...well, get..into..."
once. He didn't really want that sort of relationship with Dean, but then again, the characters of Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake
"I know what you're thinking. And you're right. I...I'm not unaffected by the thought of you...you know." Cas clasped his hands together, steadying himself. "But you don't understand, Dean. Yes, these are my wings. And I can't just...let anyone touch them. It's not like with our vessels. Wings are...they're not worldly, they're ethereal, part of our true form and I- I can't explain it to you, but please, you're the only one who..."
"I really don't wanna, but I guess we should move", he said regretfully, his skin feeling increasingly sticky now that it had cooled down. He winced slightly when Cas pulled out, saw the frown that appeared on Cas' forehead.
But now, with Dean's lips moving softly against his own, with the way he cupped his face so tenderly, he could almost pretend Dean loved him too, just the way Cas loved him.
It had been a long time ago, years like the blink of an eye in an angel's life, years that feel like millennia to Castiel's heart. He hadn't understood it, at first.
"Thank you, Sam." Jack smiles that adorable dorky smile of his as he stands in the doorway and Sam can't help the smile forming on his own lips at how unchanged the kid looks. Good for him. "I hope it's not inconvenient that I come uninvited?"
over and over, how it had both been liberating and painful. How he'd been scared, ashamed even. For loving a man. For loving his best friend. For loving an angel.
"Nono, Cas, they're- they're amazing", he assured him truthfully, daring to come a step closer. "I was just-"
"It's not the one I was out for today, those will have to wait till the...", he swallows, "The actual, y'know, wedding. But I thought...maybe you'd like something till then? It's nothing, really, just something I had lying around, but-"
you to go", he corrects himself, "because I never actually wanted you to. Not ever. I could never want you gone, Cas."
"Please", he breathed out, even though Dean could see the amount of concentration it took him to keep his voice steady, knowing that the tremor wasn't one of pleasure.
Eileen gives him a compassionate smile, but even the screen can't hide the amused twinkle in her eyes. He had called her first thing after Jack left for Heaven, needing someone to talk through what the boy had told him, needing someone he knew would
"You serious?", he asked, the amusement speaking from his voice, but Cas didn't catch the bait, just looked at him with a thoughtful, unreadable expression.
"Are you, Cas? Mine?" Dean knows the answer. He still needs to hear Cas say it. And he does, without hesitation.
Cas watched as Dean reached down, circling his entrance for a moment, relaxing into the pillow with a gasp when he breached his rim. Cas tensed slightly at the sound, but the look on Dean's face didn't seem pained, so he forced himself to relax again.
"Please, don't", Cas said, somewhere between snapping and a weak plea. He squeezed his eyes shut as he felt the fingers on his arm tightening.
"'Kay". He stroked a thumb over Cas' cheek, leaned down to place a sweet chaste kiss on his lips. "Okay."
Next to the days there will be nights. Calm nights of cudding, heated nights, passionate and desperate, savoured nights, slow and unhurried. There will be few days spent apart, and no nights at all. Because nights are sacred, and even on the rare occasion of a fight, they quickly figured out that neither ever wants to sleep alone again (and that days of built-up frustration are a guarantee for awesome nightly make-up sessions...)
As soon as Cas' lips softly brush against his, he knows that this is it. This is what he's asked for, this is what he's been asking for all his life. It's gentle and tentative and questioning, it's cautious and hopeful and perfect. He grabs for the familiar lapels of a trenchcoat, remembers that it's still hanging over the chair, over
and who knows what else I'm gonna start after that. I have like...at least five Destiel wips and countless ideas so (f.ex. some sort of angelic coma/Djinn-dream like state and Dean has to get Cas out, A getting-together through unexpected mpreg, Dean finding a poem Cas wrote to process his feelings, Cas wanting to sacrifice his life for some stop-the-end-of-the-world reason and Dean's fear of abandonment comming through and begging Cas not to...all in canon verse til the divergence and getting our idiots together in the end, obvs - maybe lemme know if any of that sounds interesting to you if you'd like bc I really need help making decisions what to write first lol)
Oh, Hell, no! If anyone got to touch his angel like that, it was Dean! Not that Dean would ever have dared to actually do it, but if he couldn't, no one would.
But he shouldn't think about Cas now. Not ever. Especially not without alcohol. Especially not without something drowning out his
"Do you think..." Tony smiled pretty shily for someone used to picking up people in bars. Maybe it was just an act for Castiel. He didn't really care. "I'm sorry if I'm being too forward here, tell me if I've been reading the signs wrong, but...do you think you could be persuaded to get out of here later?"
Cas' face appears in front of him again, smiling down at him. This time, he lets the images linger, dives down into the memory of that night he slept in his arms, the warmth and protection he'd felt such a contrast to the hard coldness he finds himself surrounded by right now.
"I love you too", he breathed, because he thought, hoped he was allowed to say it now. His eyes closed, pulling Dean in, pressing their foreheads together. "I love you, Dean. Of course I do. Of course,
Jep, denial. The liberation of the emotionally suppressed. And Dean is their leader. Could've been called
They hadn't been lovers before, not in the physical sense. But to Cas it feels as if they'd been lovers through different things, looks, expressions, thoughts. Lovers by inclination rather than by lust. (Not that lust is a problem, though.)
He kept his voice soft and soothing, but to his surprise, there was no relief in Cas' eyes, not only relief anyway, but also a bit of...disappointment? Rejection, Dean realized. This was Cas thinking Dean didn't want to kiss him anymore.
"Are you...are you happy here, Cas? With us?", Dean asked him suddenly, and Cas found he had to order his thoughts to follow. "I mean...maybe you don't wanna talk about it. I get that. But...y'know. Losing your wings, leaving Heaven...I can't help but ask myself if..." Dean paused, looked at him a little helplessly. "If you're missing something."
"Shit, you feel amazing." Dean leaned forward to catch his own weight, hands resting on Cas' chest, the skin hot beneath his palms. "Can't believe I actually get to have this."
The edge of the doorframe is biting into his hipbone and the arms he's crossed in front of his chest feel too heavy. And Cas...well, Cas is looking at him with his confused squint. Maybe he's wondering what exactly Dean's doing there. Dean's starting to wonder himself. He straightens up, clears his throat to cover up his embarrassment.
Dean makes quick work of their pants and underwear, it almost seems like there's too little ceremonial to it, but Cas doesn't seem to mind in the least, eagerly welcomes every touch and press of lips Dean bestows on him.
"You...You've been avoiding me as well", he says lamely, aware what a weak retort it is. Still, it seems to soften something in Cas, the fire giving way to something quieter, sadder.
"No, beloved." Cas smiled at him, loosening the knot of worry in Dean's stomach. "I don't mind the thought of you...
Dean always constructed a reality where he was at fault. And the only way of convincing his stubborn head otherwise would have been to admit that Lucifer must have found out about Cas' feelings, his deepest desires, and used it to-
How do we forgive ourselves for all the things we did not become? Dean is far from anything he wanted for himself when he was young, far from anything he wants for himself
"It's ok, Cas." He threads his fingers through the dark locks, pulls just enough to elicit a gasp. "Let go for me. I got you. I'm not gonna let you fall (not again)", Dean tells him, and he
He's gonna fuck up. He's gonna have the words stuck in his throat, and he's gonna stammer around after Cas gave him the speech of his dreams and
And yes, there was nervousness under the calm surface, but there was also sincerity and the neverending kindness that lulled Cas' brain into a haze and made him unable to do anything but stare.
This time Dean whimpered, throwing his head back and slightly nuzzling into Cas' side in a subconscious search for contact. Cas had to swallow hard when his eyes wandered over the beautiful lean lines of his body, the stretch of his neck, his slightly arched back, right to the way his hard cock curved upwards towards his stomach. A thin sheen of sweat had started to cover his skin, and Cas found himself desperate to taste it, to lean down and lick a stripe up that neckline, taste his skin before tasting his mouth, swallow those soft moans.
"He loved us, dad, but...he had an interesting way of showing it", Sam continues meaningfully, choosing his words with care. "And Dean...Dean idealised him, y'know, wanted to please him more than anything. Dad had a very specific image of what a man, especially a hunter, had to be like. So that's what Dean set for himself. And even though Dad's long gone, that's nothing you can just cut from one moment to the next. But that doesn't mean he doesn't want to, Cas", he says, pressing his lips together while he thinks about his next words.
Cas whimpered softly, but didn't wake, fingers clenching down so hard Dean could feel his nails digging into his chest. Before he could stop himself, Dean stroked his fingers through Cas' hair, noticing that his hairline was slightly damp with sweat.
"Could you say it again?", Cas asked, needed to hear the words repeated, as often as possible, reminding him that they had truly been spoken. "Please."
"Yeah..." His tone was careful, guarded, made sure not to drift off into pointlessly hopeful territory. "But it's fine, I'm gonna get Sam, I-"
"'Kay." He shrugged his shoulders, wondering why the hell that little answer made him feel so damn relieved. "Then I wouldn't."
Whatever it had been, Dean only knew that it was definitely 100% his fault that Cas looked the way he looked right now, and he couldn't stand it.
"But I don't understand." Cas shook his head, the head that refused to wrap around what was happening.
Dean watches how Jack lets his eyes wander over the table, the subject apparently closed to him now, moving on without giving it a second thought. He smiles to himself through his still lingering state of shocked disbelief.
Dean stops at that and looks at him for a moment, a moment during which Cas unconsciously holds his breath even though he's not sure why. Dean opens his mouth, closes it again, and Cas just thinks he's about to say something when Miracle interrupts by jumping at Dean to snatch a stick out of his hand. He watches how Dean scolds the dog playfully, but throws it again anyway, looking after him with a sparkle in his eyes.
"I knew it had a happy ending", he says, still smiling that sad yet loving smile. "Perhaps it was foolish of me, considering it's a work of fiction, but...it made me feel like there was hope."
"It's you", Cas breathed out, relief so obvious in the way his whole body seemed to slump down, tension easing out of his limbs....and what the actual hell was going on? Maybe Cas was confused, maybe...he didn't know, but he couldn't trust this, just shook his head, gripping the door handle like a lifeline.
"So what the hell were you thinking, man? How could you do that?" Dean hates how weak and shaky his voice has suddenly become. He can't do anything about it. "How could you have left me here with all that...that
In the end, he finds himself back in the library, panting and sweaty and with a mind that's unable to form a single clear thought except for the one.
"Just wander off to God knows where!", he says, lifting his hands for that bit of dramatic flavour. "I came home and you were gone, Cas. No call, no text, no note, I didn't know where you were or if something had happened-"
It was a bit easier then, moving to the headboard, lying on his back and waiting for Cas to join him. His breath hitched only a little at the sight of Cas crawling closer to hover above him for a moment, looking down as if Dean was some sort of miracle. And then Cas leaned down to kiss him, and Dean's eyes fluttered closed. He let the angel open his lips with his tongue, suppressed the shiver when he felt a warm hand carefully settling on his bare chest, fingers splayed out, a tickling, grounding point of contact. His own hands itched to reach out and touch as well, but he didn't dare to yet, not without Cas explicitly giving permission.
He waits in nervous anticipation for Cas' reply while the angel just looks at him for a moment, but then the furrow in his brow vanishes, his eyes soften, and instead of an answer, he simply moves up Dean's body to connect their lips in a chaste warm kiss again. Dean draws him in, holds him close while their lips move together, slow and unhurried. And Dean loves this, the way they could just keep kissing like that for hours, like they have all the time in the world. Because they do.
Cas pressed his lips together, but then something settled over his features, something Dean couldn't immediately put his finger on.
Silence spreads between them, still a bit awkward, but different from the heavy tension of the last weeks. This is a shared silence, one that's not forced on the other, but rather partaken in, in mutual agreement. Because sometimes, an understanding silence is better than a bunch of meaningless words. (There is an intimacy about being understood like this, but he doesn't want to think about that too closely right now. Not when he's just made some progress.)
"Yes." Cas instinctively hooked a leg around Dean's waist, the heel of his foot digging into his lower back to encourage his movements. "More."
Woah. That was a blow Dean hadn't expected. He could have sworn there was a hint of hurt peeking through the veil of anger in Cas' voice, but it was gone so fast he couldn't be sure if it had ever truly been there. Now, there was just fury staring back at him.
Cas gave him a small smile, and maybe that was all he could have asked for at the moment. Maybe more.
Today, Cas had decided to try and switch places for the first time, having gained enough confidence from their progress with his insecurities about the scars to allow Dean to be the one on top. It was nervewracking at first, the feeling of being surrounded, another body hovering over him, blocking his way to escape. But Dean had softly stroked a thumb over his cheekbone, the words
And to Dean's great delight, those nasty voices of guilt and shame were blissfully quiet during their sessions. As soon as he had his angel in his arms (or the other way around), everything else went silent, drowned out by the overwhelming sensation of pleasure and happiness he allowed himself to indulge in until he was completely swallowed up in it. (Who knew how long until it was snatched away from him again? He had to savour every second to its fullest.)
He knows Dean. He knows how Dean deals with things. Monsters get killed. He himself gets sacrificed. Worlds get saved. Emotions get swallowed. Problems get ignored. Feelings get denied.
Cas nodded frantically in return, responding eagerly when Dean pressed their mouths together for the umpteenth time that night.
"Have you listened to anything I just said?", he says, and Dean swallows, because has he? Has he really? Or did he just hear what he expected to hear, what he feared to hear?
"Great", he says, of all the things he could have said. But his mind is blank. There's just her hand in his and a feeling of lightness blooming in his chest.Â  When your heart is involved, it all comes out in moron. "That's..." He trails off, loses himself in tracing his thumb over her knuckles.
Perhaps Dean would actually have let him. Perhaps he could have taken what he'd longed for, craved for so long. Perhaps he would have been able to shut that voice off and let his walls down and let Dean see everything he had bottled up behind them, let go and feel free at last, free to take and to give and to love like he'd always wanted to, just this once.
"Of course I still want to, Dean." Cas let his fingers travel through the strands of Dean's hair, his nails lightly scraping over his scalp, and Dean wanted to fucking
He thought his world could only be turned upside down once an evening, how presumtuous of him, how gullible, like believing the end of the world could happen just once.
"Not always. Some people think it's easier, but..." Dean pressed his lips together. "I can, if you think that would be better, with...y'know, memories and..."
The moment the word left Cas' mouth, Dean's brain realized just what he'd just let slip out. A wave of white-hot panic surged through his veins, his body heating up before going icy cold, his palms damp, and he was sure all the colour must be draining out of his face.
"Sammy. How long have you known me?" Dean leans his hip against the countertop, totally-not-Cas'-eyes-blue mug in hand. "Obviously all your fucking life. And when has the answer to that question ever been no?"
"You-..." Sam watches as his brow furrows for a moment, then his eyes widen in surprised understanding. "You
Yeeeeeeeees, as a little surprise (at least for some of you), this is the first chapter featuring fanart by...well, me xD (credit to Euclase tho whose work was the inspiration and reference for this, I repainted it and added the wings:)
"But I'm ready", Dean assures him, words that roll from his tongue so much more effortlessly than he'd ever thought possible. "I've been ready for a long time."
"Cas, I cannot make speeches", Dean starts, and the way Cas' breath hitches tells Dean that he recognizes the words Dean is quoting, the words that had haunted him so much he'd repeated them over and over after Cas read them to him for the first time. "If I loved you less I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. I have blamed you, and lectured you, and pushed you away, and yet you have borne it and always returned to me."
, he felt like he could drown in those eyes, no need to breathe underwater, not when Cas was everything he needed to live.
"I believe I am", Cas finally declares, and even though it's said in jest, there's a heavy undertone to it, a seriousness that makes something warm settle in Dean's chest, loosening the knot there. He feels a smile spreading across his face and he follows the urge to lean forward and press a soft kiss to the angel's lips.
"What else can I do?" Dean didn't wait for an answer, too tired to deal with any of Sam's logic shit right now, or even worse -Â  talks about friendship and family and
"May I read that as a yes?", he asks with a sparkle in his eyes that betrays the innocent tone. "Because, as you know, I don't really have experience with this. My time with April was...educational but, well,
"So you've wanted..." His eyes squinted thoughtfully, the cogs in his brain turning and squeaking from the effort to wrap around Dean's words. "..
be up to anyone else." He dares to bring his free hand up to Dean's face and gently stroke over his cheek. He can see how it makes the breath catch in Dean's throat and his smile softens. "I want to love you, Dean. But you must choose to let me. That's something only you can do. Good things...good things
it, the gaze burning into him. He stays still, pretends not to notice and doesn't dare turn, keeps smiling a smile that feels more forced with every second that passes. And then it's gone. Cas looks at Jack and the tension leaves Dean's shoulders as he releases the breath he's been holding.
, Sam desperately wants to say, but he knows better than to make a sex joke in front of their three-year-old. He signs it to Eileen instead, under the table and out of Jack's sight just in case, earning him a choked sound from her and a scolding look from Dean and Cas.
He looks at Sam with a hopeful sparkle in his eyes, as if he were expecting Sam to tell him the meaning behind those incredible revelations, and even though his brain is working at warp speed right now to wrap around this overwhelming new information, Sam knows Jack's waiting for an answer.
"Don't do this, Cas", he says without thinking and Cas flinches slightly at the echo of his words from the dungeon, but this is not what Dean meant, this is not what he meant at all, not this time.
It wasn't like he was doing much. They were mostly doing the same things as before, they just changed the location. Reading in the library, watching movies in the Deancave (Cas liked movie nights more than ever, because he could sit on the couch with Dean however close he liked that day, just next to each other, sometimes brushing shoulders if it made him feel better, always aware of Dean's presence without it being overwhelming. And all the while he would find himself being sucked into the storyline for some time, a welcome distraction from his own mind, even for just a few hours.)
Note that I still find it really hard to write dialogue, especially for other characters than Dean and Cas. I tried out a little Sam here, so feedback on that would be very kind.
"I couldn't blame you", he said quietly, and Dean was sure something inside him just shattered. "And even though you said so, I couldn't hold you to such a promise, Dean."
Cas had miarcled the storm to quieten. Not literally (though Dean was not entirely sure Cas couldn't have done that too, theoretically), the storm Dean had both fought and nourished in himself for as long as he could remember. The thing with storms though, was that once they were over, you wouldn't even remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even remember how the storm started or be sure whether it's really over. The only certainty is that when you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what storms are all about. And he didn't ever want to go back. Not when this is what he got now.
Cas stared at him, squinted in confusion, but he still felt how his breathing evened and his heartbeat returned to normal under Dean's calm smile, the surge of panic vanishing as fast as it had come.
Cas could only nod mindlessly, arching up, lips searching, quickly connecting in sloppy attempts of kisses before the need for air forced them apart again.
For another half-hour, he resists. It's only when Dean starts to shift in his sleep that Cas finally cracks. He listens to Dean murmuring under his breath, something Cas almost thinks might be his name, and for the millionth time that night, he wonders if Dean had actually been dreaming about him earlier. It's only then, seeing him writhe in unease, that Cas gives into the surge of recklessness and lets his hand settle on Dean's head. It's a bold move, he knows, what if Dean wakes up and finds him like this? He's probably gonna ask Cas what the fuck he thinks he's doing, everything this night achieved might be ruined. But Dean's hair is impossibly soft under his fingers and Dean's breathing calms more with every stroke of Cas' hand, and he can't stop himself.
The angel throws an unsure glance at him, standing in the room, still angled towards the door but unmoving. Dean can see the fight going on in Cas' head, suppressed longing colliding with the instinct to flee and avoid confrontation, suspended in the in-between.
"Shouldn't waste your grace like that", he mumbled between kisses, completely failing to sound reprimanding. He felt Cas smile against his lips, deepening the kiss until Dean forgot what he'd even meant to scold him for.
"Good." Dean didn't care to hold back the relieved smile that spread over his own face. "How about...how about we stay like that while you try to fall asleep, hm? And every time..something comes back..you can feel my finger and you'll know you're here. With me." He bit his lip, lowering his eyes to their hands. "How does that sound?"
But then he felt Cas' arms tightening where they lay around his back, felt them stroke up to his shoulders, sneak into his hair and pull his head up, gently leading him into a kiss. Dean exhaled a sigh of relief into Cas' mouth as their lips met, aware of what Cas was communicating through touch before the angel had even said the words.
"You know...", the angel smiled, "if you wanted to be the one holding my hand, taking me home, kissing me...all you ever had to do was ask."
"Honestly, I...kinda always wanted to see them", Dean admitted before he could stop himself. (Honestly, what was it with his mouth today? Going and spilling all his secrets. He couldn't even bring himself to regret it, not with Cas' eyes lighting up like that.)
"It was...awful", Cas whispered then, almost too quiet for Dean to hear, his hand clenching around Dean's. "Disgusting. And I couldn't- He just..."
"Dean?" He said his name so softly, so carefully, but there was a slight waver in his voice he couldn't quite hide. "What happened?"
"Cas." Dean presses his lips together, feels how something swells up in him, something he's been nourishing and growing for weeks, finally threatening to break out. And he lets it. He just lets it. "You fucking idiot", he says, shaking his head in frustrated disbelief, "you're family. You're my friend, Cas, my
Instead, it's Eileen who moves, apparently she's had the same thought Dean just dismissed. Sam doesn't even comment when she comes to sit on his thigh, just welcomes her in his arms with a quick smile. Dean doesn't feel envious at all. He does
Dean had barely finished the thought when he felt Cas moving, tugging on his sleeves to shrug his flannel off. Dean froze for a moment. Was he still caught in his fantasy? But no, he'd broken the kiss, had opened his eyes, looked back into deep blue, and the angel in front of him was real, was still about to divest Dean of his outer layer.
"So if you're pushing yourself for me, because you're afraid I'll not want you anymore, then don't. I will never stop wanting you, Cas", he admitted truthfully. "Jeez, up until a few weeks ago I thought angels didn't even feel that sort of attraction, and it didn't change a thing about my-"
When Dean followed willingly, let himself be guided without hesitation, Cas knew that this was it. He wanted this. He
He could see his profile, how the angel squeezed his eyes shut before turning towards him, just his head, his body still aligned towards the door, ready to flee.
So...this maybe won't go in the direction you expected (or maybe it will, who knows) but I hope you enjoy it!
Today is a good day. His family is happy. And he's gonna make sure to have a nice evening with Cas, no drama, no fighting, no arguing, no stupid feeling getting in the way (hahaha, ok, maybe not this one), just a nice calm evening with his best friend. Who he's friends with. Like...friendly. Y'know.
The face that looks at him right now is nothing like that at all, just full of kindness and concern.
Those women didn't know him, saw nothing but a soft voice and a handsome face, another shot at someone warm and willing. And it's been enough. For those nights. What he wants with Cas, it requires a form of intimacy that goes beyond the physical aspect. (Not that he doesn't want that too, goddamn, he does, and it fucking scares him.) But the fucking scariest shit about all this is having to open up emotionally. Not something he does, ok? Like...ever.
The desperation speaking from Cas' eyes as well as his voice were like a fist closing around Dean's heart.
Dean awakes from his dream with a start. He's panting, his hairline feels a bit sweaty and his covers are twisted around his ankles. He takes a few moments to just sit and bring his mind to terms with his body, to draw his conscience back into reality from where it's still half-stuck in the realm of sleep. He closes his eyes, concentrates on the welcome darkness that chases the pictures away, black replacing hard blue eyes, a turned back, a door falling shut.
He looks in the mirror, his eyes frantic, hairline a bit sweaty, and tie backwards. The tie is backwards. Did he put it on like that after all or did he just screw it up when his thoughts were running amock?
He lay down, praying that Cas wouldn't notice how nervous he truly was, or how guilty, or how selfish, how ashamed, how excited, how needy, how
recall any of it. He swallowed the bile rising up in his throat, closed his eyes to gather himself for a moment.
It was easier than he'd thought it would be, once he started. This had been a good idea. He hadn't gotten to touch a lot, then, holding the flashes at bay for now. Not that he hadn't thought about touching Dean in very different contexts, though.
Dean stared open-mouthed as Cas stepped back into his space, reaching for Dean's flannel and pulling it off over his shoulders. Dean just let him. Cas' hands were warm and gentle as they lifted the t-shirt he wore underneath over his head, Dean willingly raising his arms to help Cas divest him of the offending piece of clothing. He heard how it fell to the floor with a muffled thud, watched how Cas' mouth opened slightly, his eyes roaming over Dean's chest, but before any self-consciousness could slip into his mind, Cas was kissing him again.
Cas' gaze is fixed on his when he looks up, eyes shining, hair a mess, a thin sheen of sweat covering his chest. He hasn't been sweating before, not that Dean noticed anyway, must be a new effect of his low charge on angel-mojo, and he looks...radiant, glorious, gorgeous-
"No." Dean shakes his head, paces through the room. "Nonononono. You can't- I can't let you do this, I-"
He shifted his weight to draw back the covers, but something in Dean told him he couldn't, shouldn't let this slide. It was that something in Cas' eyes that...
Cas smiled to himself when Dean turned his back to him and slipped through the door. Flustered Dean was undeniably adorable.
"Hey, I was hilarious!", comes the affronted answer from somewhere behind Cas, making him and everyone else chuckle.
Dean froze, stopped his ministrations, the breath that had ghosted in a warm caress over Cas' skin was suddenly stuck in his throat.
There's a moment of silence, then the rustling of the sheets when Cas moves, wraps an arm around him and carefully pulls him close. Dean tries not to tense up, tries not to feel guilty about how comforting it is to be held, how he doesn't deserve to be treated so gently, so lovingly.
He couldn't be sure how long they had been sitting there or when they'd come to find themselves lying down instead. Time had never mattered to him as an angel. Wrapped up in Dean, he found that time didn't even exist.
He took a sip of his drink, felt how his grace immediately burned away any effects the alcohol could have had. For once, he wished he could get at least a little drunk without having to consume a whole liquor store. When he put his glass back to the table, he felt warm fingers gently wrapping around his, holding his hand in place on the table before he could retreat it.
"Are you feeling good, Dean?", he pressed the words into the skin where Dean's neck met his shoulder, sucking lightly, not enough to bruise, but enough to make Dean's breath hitch.
He feels like watching the scene play out from afar, listens to the angel's words, recognizes the soft voice as that of his best friend, mesmerized by its tone and the words Cas strings together, far too good and beautiful for this dark cellar surrounding them, far too good and beautiful for the bangs at the door Dean can hear echoing somewhere in the back of his mind, far too good and beautiful to be witnessed by someone like him. He can see the tears streaming down Cas' face, they make the blue of his eyes glisten and it's always been hard not to get lost in those eyes, but now,
Oh, and slight warning for bad anger and pain management. I don't think it's a lot, but just to be sure, if such things trigger you, look after yourself first.
"Shhhh." Cas' fingers trailed gently through Dean's hair. "It's alright, love. I'm going to take care of you."
, and before he knows it he's opened his mouth, sings out the words he knows by heart as he makes his way towards the stage. (It's Dean's turn to stare now, microphone suspended in mid-air, his mouth already open and ready to form the next line, but instead he finds himself silenced, watches in amazement how Cas climbs the steps of the stage, never breaking eye contact.)
"I mean I never..." Cas shrugged his shoulders. "I never actually did anything, you know? I didn't dare pleasure myself thinking of you, but I couldn't stop myself from indulging in the thoughts on their own."
That was all. Nothing to it. Nothing to get in the way and make things complicated. More complicated.
I hope you enjoy this last little chapter and I hope it will give this story the round and satisfying ending that I anticipated. You guys are awesome, so with one laughing and one crying eye...thanks, love yall!!
"I'm sure you taught them to piss off", he says, mirroring the grin she feels spreading on her face at that.
"Shhh. It's fine. You're fine." Dean rested his chin on Cas' head, inhaled the scent of his hair as he held him tighter. "We're fine, Cas."
"You have to run your fingers along the feathers, the way they grow, smooth the crooked ones back into place", he instructed, "And if you find a loose one, try to tug slightly to get it out."
I have to say I've already been very happy and surprised about the attention and number of subscriptions this has gained, thanks to everyone for reading and bearing with the wait, I'm so thrilled about yall's interest in this story.
it shouldn't already be so hard to concentrate. "Wanna switch?", he asked, remembering that Cas had asked for Dean to be on top. Not that he wasn't also totally up for what was happing right now...
, it had only been a couple of days, but Dean had missed the feeling of those soft lips moving against his own.
Futile endeavours, Cas was well aware. Dean would never be his the way Cas wanted him to, and he had never desired anyone else's touch that same way, so why bother?
He can feel Cas' breath on his face, the burn of his own that comes in shallow pants, both mingling in the space between them.
"So...you interested?", he asked, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible even though his pulse was picking up speed. "Just thought that...maybe it'd be easier, y'know? For a first attempt? Just to get used to the idea of being touched like that at all."
. One of the heroines speaks to me in a way that...well." He looks down at his hands, an almost shy smile playing around his lips. "I don't want to give the plot away, but...some of it reminded me of us...of you. I could understand her, feel with her. She..."
I have an exam tmr so obvs I had to procrastinate and do literally anything but learn...and this is the result (don't even start, Charlie, I can literally hear you scolding me, I already learned yesterday, ok, it'll be fine). Enjoy a quick update for once, the next one is gonna take longer again bc I sadly won't have much time to write this weekend:(
Cas made a humming noise, arching up, and just for a moment Dean allowed himself to think that he sounded content.
But then he hadn't said a thing. Because he realised he couldn't. He couldn't go back to the way things were. Because he loved Cas. Like...
, did he need him. He needed him like he needed to eat and to breathe. He needed him to smile and to laugh and to be happy. And he needed it to be because of him.
His fingers around the doorhandle tightened at the sound, knuckles turning white. He couldn't have heard correctly. Surely, that was just-
"If this is about-" Cas breaks off, licks his lips. "I don't want to be presumptuous", he says then, slow and cautious, "but- if this is about that moment in your room yesterday, I told you, I know you don't
. Dean could never know. Cas hated himself for staying silent, for being so selfish to leave Dean in the dark, guilty and ashamed, just so Cas could keep him and his friendship.
He navigated Cas to lie on his back, hands smoothing up his sides, the words pressed into Cas' skin as Dean kissed a trail down his neck.
It didn't matter. So Dean was attracted to his best friend. His male best friend. Angelic best friend in a male vessel. Male body. Whatever.
He hadn't been able to look at Cas while he'd stood in front of him. Now with the angel gone, it was like he couldn't breathe as long as he was out of sight.
He turns from where he's standing with Claire and Kaia at one of the round tables scattered over the meadow, looking around for Dean who had been gone for some time now after announcing he'd just quickly get something fresh to drink. He should be back by now, Cas just thinks when his as well as all their guests' attention is drawn towards the lake where a small stage has been set up. Until now its only purpose had been to accommodate Dean's old musical equipment, providing them with a pleasant background melody hoovering over everything, enough to set the right atmosphere, yet so subtle it didn't hinder any conversation.
Dean escaped a gasp behind him and Cas just hoped it wasn't a sound of horror. He couldn't bring himself to look and find out.
Because Cas was in front of him, so close, but far too far away, and his pink lips and flushed cheeks would have been the most beautiful thing Dean had ever seen, were it not for the panic in his eyes, a spark of fear burning in the usually calm blue.
Cas nodded, already shoving at the waistband of Dean's boxers, and Dean instantly went to help him - just because he hadn't spared a thought to the fabric separating them a second ago didn't mean he wasn't absolutely burning up with the desire to feel all of Cas against him now that the option presented itself.
"You really like them?", Cas asked incredulously, tilting his head as he finally turned enough to throw a glance at Dean's face, couldn't help it. The sight that greeted him made his heart jump in his chest.
He needed Cas to move (like fucking yesterday), needed to feel him closer, deeper, until he couldn't tell anymore where his body ended and Cas began. He needed-
He tried to catch the angel's gaze again, lightly tilting his head up with a finger beneath his chin.
"I wasn't aware I needed your permission now for seeking out some human contact", Cas said far too coldly, an icy weight that settled somewhere in Dean's chest, pulling him down.
When he opens his eyes again, there's a determination rushing through his veins that he didn't know he still possessed. Getting up from the floor is easy, opening the door is easy. Closing it feels like leaving more than one mess behind.
The confidence it had gained Cas led to a new discovery, the act of knowingly bringing Dean pleasure woke reactions in Cas (and his body) that he had only experienced mildly so far.
Cas nodded again, the trust speaking from his eyes knocking the air out of Dean's lungs for a second.
Is that what's up with the sleeping? Cas watching over him in every waking (and apparently also sleeping) hour? Cas making sure that he's safe, even if from a distance?
And Dean did, picking the pace back up, their bodies meeting over and over, stroking the fire inside Cas' veins until all he could think about was the overwhelming pleasure of Dean moving inside him, above him, around him, the friction of his neglected cock trapped between their bodies, the taste of Dean's tongue dancing with his own.
"But I respect your boundaries", Cas finished, the by now familiar tiredness returning. "I'm asking you to accept mine."
Before Dean knows what has happened, he finds himself flipped on his back with a lapful of angel, pinning his wrists to the bed.
So no, tonight wasn't the first time Dean scrambled up from his mattress in the middle of the night to rush over to the bed, waking Cas with his voice once he heard the angel whimper and toss violently in his sleep.
"Are you having second thoughts?", it tumbles unbidden from his lips that day, his insecurity making way even though he's more than sure that can't be the case. Dean has seemed so happy lately. He's told Cas he's happy. He's
And where rejection hasn't even been a real concept before, it is now staring in his face and baring its teeth and growling its threatening arrival.
And just like that, as he lies there, without a thought, without a plan, without a care - he says it.
He doesn't know what happened. He doesn't know what he intended, he doesn't know if he intended anything at all. He doesn't know what it all means. All he knows is that there was a piece of him that couldn't let go of Cas. (Not like this. Not now. Not ever.) So he didn't.
"I guess I'm just...still getting used to it", he said, attempting a lighthearted smile, missed by about a mile. "The thought that you're here because you want to be. And not just for the sake of helping me. That you would get as much pleasure out of this as I do..."
"Okay." Dean keeps looking at him for a moment, keeps smiling, before he gestures to the side of the bed with his nightstand. "There's lube in the top drawer."
Dean was grateful. Like this, perhaps he could remember his name the way it used to come from Cas' lips, warm and affectionate. Memory was all he had, he was sure.
Cas' heart fluttered in his chest, filling with emotion so overpowering he feared he might burst if he tried to contain it.
, just be together, in what way Cas didn't care anymore. He just wanted Dean to admit that he wanted him in any way at all.
The only problem was, he found himself wishing more and more often that he could just kiss Dean outside of their sessions. It felt so easy by now, so natural, pressing their lips together whenever they pleased while they were practicing, and sometimes Cas almost forgot that it wasn't real, caught himself saying goodnight to Dean and leaning over for a goodnight kiss before he realized what he was doing. Sometimes he'd thought that maybe Dean was leaning in, too, but neither of them had ever actually closed the gap, had crossed that line between practice and reality.
He'd been on his way home from a supply run when he saw the glowing sign of an open bar. He'd gone in there with the intention to pick up some chick, have a round of quick, impersonal, dirty sex and get his mind off the fact that that was something he didn't want anymore. Maybe he could prove himself wrong, he'd told himself. He hadn't even made it to first base.
"No." Cas shook his head, wanted to reach out, didn't. "No, Dean, don't put words in my mouth. That's not what I meant, I-"
He leaned down, let his tongue travel from Dean's collarbone up to his ear, reveling in the satisfying gasp escaping Dean's lips. The taste was salty and heady, an underlying note that was uniquely and undeniably
He knows Cas is about to object, is going to make some excuse for him he doesn't deserve. He doesn't deserve his forgiveness either. He can't
"Warm", Dean had answered. "Calming. Like having a piece of you with me all the time." Which, in fact, is exactly how it is. "I wanted you to have something similar, but I'm afraid it's not quite the same", he'd gone on with an apologetic shrug. "Could hardly use my actual soul or somethin'. So..."
"You were worried", the angel states. It's not a question, but it's strained with surprise, and the fact that Cas just says it like that, says it out loud,
"See you at the altar", Dean says against those lips before he lets go, smirking when Cas rolls his eyes fondly, walking to the door.
"Oh, and Cas?", he calls down once they reach the door, unable to hide the smirk on his face, "You and Dean don't stay up for us. Might get late." He grins when Eileen playfully slaps him on the shoulder and exchanges another meaningful look with Cas, who's sat down on the chair closest to Miracle.
He'd looked peaceful that night, too, the night a few days ago when he had watched him in his sleep. Dean hasn't said a word about it. Maybe he doesn't remember. Maybe he doesn't want to remember.
Dean wanted him. Dean actually wanted him! He didn't need to force himself to touch Cas, Cas didn't have to feel guilty about making Dean uncomfortable anymore, at least not when it came to physical aspects.
He wanted to bury his face in his hands, hide away from Cas and those eyes, flee from the guilt and the shame and the pathetic pleading,
"No, actually, I..." Dean curses the heat he can feel creeping up his cheeks, prays it doesn't show. "I think I'm gonna stay awake for a bit. And I was wondering if you...ah." He swallows, takes a deep breath. "Would you like to stay?", he then blurts out before he can think better of it, licks his lips. "H-Here, I mean. Right now? With...with me?" He panics slightly when he sees Cas' eyes widen in surprise and he knows it's too late to row back now, tries nevertheless. "Maybe we could talk or...I dunno." Dean shrugs his shoulders, attempts to appear light-hearted, casual, as if this was nothing out of the ordinary. "But only if you want to, you don't have to, obviously-"
The words weren't coming. Of course they didn't. They never did when Dean wanted them to, needed them too, but maybe his eyes were telling Cas everything he needed to know with the way they were pleading for the angel to understand. He could see how Cas' eyes widened, how his shoulders slumped slightly, his gaze turning impossibly soft.
He squeezed Dean's hand as the hunter swallowed, lowered his eyes, but Cas wouldn't let him, gently tipping up his head until their eyes met.
It was still a dream, but Cas had never felt closer to it than he did now. They still had a long way to go, but they'd taken the right road. They'd even talked about getting a dog and were planning that beach vacation Dean had always wanted to take him on.
would say, doesn't it. All deep and flowery and too true for anyone's good. Why the heck can his brain come up with this shit the way it would come from Cas' mouth? That's such a dick move. His heart is playing with his mind, trying to convince him by using his biggest weakness against him.
Now to the chapter, I'd like to give a special thanks to a few of you readers, especially FlightofFantasy who I talked to in the comments some time ago and who gave me the idea of a plot point for this! And then we have LovelyOtt98 and charlies_secret_closet (surprise surprise, probably gonna have to point you out for every chapter from now on) who encouraged me to maybe have another little smut episode;) Don't worry, we're not having 7k of it again xD just a little bit, really.
The moment ends far too soon, but just as he thinks Cas is going to pull his hand away, there's a split second during which the angel hesitates, before swiftly drawing his fingers through Dean's hair. It's only then that he finally retreats, the slightest hint of a blush painting his cheeks as Dean stares at him. (Was is the cold? Dean's stare? The fact that he'd been caught? Caugh? Caught doing...what?)
The quiet, too high pitched groan of his name startled Dean, and he leaned down to check if he woke Cas after all, but the angel still had his eyes closed, unmoving except for the occasional twitch.
"I dunno." Dean leans down, hands on his knees. "He could've gone anywhere. There's a lot of woods around here, man."
"G-Great." Dean releases a breath, can hardly believe his luck when he watches Cas crossing the room again,
, not just a vessel", Dean continued, feeling that Cas needed to hear it. "Not gonna lie, angel", he smirked. "You're hot, y'know that?"
"Dean, this place is beautiful." Cas looked at him and smiled, the amazement in his voice making his eyes sparkle. "How do you know it?"
In a surge of panic, Dean starts pacing through the room, a biting contrast to the angel's stiff posture. His eyes are moving though, Dean can feel them following him as he picks up his pace. Because maybe if he keeps moving, if he makes himself a moving target, just maybe these divine blue eyes won't be able to settle long enough to scorch through him and burn away the last crumb of determination he'd scratched together.
He smiled a genuine smile. It was true, they really were doing good. Far better than either could ever have imagined a few months ago.
"I just...I've been a dick, okay? And not just...that thing in the kitchen or...I dunno. Just...y'know. And I'm sorry. Can you forgive me?"
But no, the way Cas' face seemed to open up couldn't have been an illusion. He wasn't quite sure what was going on, why on earth Cas would hold him back, but it was enough to freeze his feet to the ground, hesitating.
"Just don't..." Dean lowered his eyes to his own cup for a moment, a blue one Cas had seen him using exceptionally often. "I don't want you to think that I...that I think you can't look after yourself or something." His eyes returned to Cas', apologetic, almost pleading. "It's not that. You're your own damn person and I should've..." Dean shrugged his shoulders. "...yeah."
It would be weird, he decides. Kissing Cas. Not that he thinks a lot about kissing Cas in the first place. Or dreams about it. Whatever. Why would he. He doesn't think about kissing Cas
"Then trust me when I say we'll be fine." He stroked his knuckles over Cas' cheeks, wiped the last traces of dampness away. "We'll be okay if you decide to stop. And if you decide you want this, too, it'll be alright. Better than that." A shy smile suddenly curled the corners of his lips. "I wouldn't give myself to anyone else like this, you know that, right Cas?"
"That was..." Dean trailed off, his brain too mushy to find anything that even came close to describing the way he felt right now. "Shit, Cas", he sighed instead, and the smile on the angel's face told him that Cas understood.
Even on Cas' closed lips, Dean was sure he could taste a hint of the pancakes he'd made them, a trace of honey (Cas preferred it over syrup, a damn shame, but so undeniably
to love, and to be loved in return. In...whatever way you choose to", he added, hating himself for rowing back, but unable to help it. "In whatever way it may manifest. And I've never wanted anything more than to be the one that you'll allow to...cherish you, in any way you'd let me."
Until Dean twitches and slowly opens one of his eyes. Cas tenses in shock, swiftly withdraws his fingers, but it's too late.
This is a long one. Got a bit out of hand tbh. I just hope you'll like it. Not beta read and posted at 6am as usual.
"Yes." Cas will squeeze his fingers, smiling calmly. And despite the lump in his throat, Dean won't be afraid, and he'll know neither is Cas.
"Is it..." Cas swallowed hard, big blue eyes looking at Dean. "Do you mean because...because I'm an angel?"
His calm voice betrayed how Dean was practically burning up to feel Cas that way, how he'd been desperate for it from the moment he'd felt him hard against his backside.
"Yes", Cas smiles back. "It was so perfect, Dean. I should have known everything about you would be mirroring that beauty. A shame I was too much of an angel to appreciate it, then."
He can feel Cas' eyes following his movements as he grabs a kitchen cloth from the nearest counter and rubs his forearms dry. The gaze is burning into his skin, making his head empty and his fingers clumsy. He fiddles with the knot of the apron behind his back, swearing under his breath when the strings escape his grip.
. He's angry with Cas, too, disappointed and hurt when he thinks back to their confrontation, what he'd done and how he hadn't even consulted Dean in the matter first, something so huge and literally lifechanging. Doesn't Cas trust him enough to include him in matters that will be so substantial to him? Or is it just that he doesn't value his opinion enough?
Weeee, I'm excited, dunno why, should be used to it by now shouldn't I. Gee, okay, hope you like it, love yall! ðŸ’™
I wrote my first exam of the semester this morning (at fucking 8:15, guys, if I ever find out who set that time I SWEAR-) and spent the rest of the day working on this. And the night. Now that I think about it the exam was actually yesterday bc it's 6am. Anyway. Point stands. Much nicer than uni work, either way. I hope you're gonna like the way we're progressing...*nervously chews on fingernails*
Want and need, passion and love, desperation and tenderness. It was all there inside of Dean when it came to Cas, mixing and meddling, the nearly overpowering desire to care for and to be taken care of.
clothes, but they can hardly share Dean's sparse wardrobe on a daily basis. The coat stayed though, and he isn't sorry Cas insisted on keeping it, knows that coat like he knows the back of his hand.
Dean wanted to taste that smile, feel it against his lips and make it melt into moans of pleasure, so he just
And lastly, quotes from Jane Austen's Emma and references to Pride&Prejudice and Sense&Sensibility (now you know what I was talking about, don't you, FlightofFantasy?)
My dear friend LovelyOtt98 actually asked me in last chapter's comments when those two were FINALLY going to admit anything regarding their feelings. I didn't wanna spoil the surprise so I didn't tell her anything, but I had in fact already planned this conversation for the next chapter then and was just like muhahahahahhaah juuuust you waitttt eheheheh.
"Yeah, so I've heard...", Dean mutters under his breath, watching as Sam rolls his eyes in exasperation, but chooses to ignore his brother's comment. It's not as if it'd do any good, anyway.
"You're not." Cas shook his head, reached up to stroke a soothing thumb over his cheek. Dean couldn't help but lean into the touch even though he still saw that heaviness dulling the spark in Cas' eyes.
I was about to die, Dean. I never planned for you to have to deal with this...after. Because I thought there would be no after. I'm sorry."
"I froze up, Cas", Dean whispered, voice shaky, blinking against the stinging in his eyes. "I couldn't move, I- I was so in shock, I wanted to scream and bite and fight but I- I tried to stop him. But I wasn't strong enough."
"Dean? Are you alright?" There it is again. Of course Cas would feel his distress even when they're just lying here, facing away from each other.
"Oh, that sonofa- I'm gonna kill him. DO YOU HEAR ME?" The words echoed from the plain walls of the bunker, screamed into nothingness, sense- and heartless like the one they were addressing, mocking him with their futility. "I'M GONNA FIND YOU. AND THEN I'M GONNA MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS. FOR ALL OF THIS! FOR MAKING ME- making me..."
Cas hesitated. He knew he wanted to do it. He just wasn't sure if he could. He didn't know how, didn't know how to make it good for Dean, didn't know how to separate it from his own memories, how to turn it into an act of pleasure and love instead...
Dean turned and stood, having (pretending) to get his pyjama pants all the way up his legs, absolutely not fleeing from the way Cas' eyes had softened, the way he could still feel his gaze burning into his back now.
"I hope so. Chuck was not a very good God, was he?", Jack asks innocently, tilting his head to the side, and
"...it was about you, returning my affection", he settled on saying. "You telling me you wanted me back, but above all, you, allowing me to cherish you the way you deserve."
"I wouldn't have asked you to do this if I didn't think it would be good", Dean told him. "For both of us."
Letting go, it sounds so easy when he says it like that. But it's not. The hardest part of letting go is to understand that everyone else is okay with you. And Dean isn't even okay with himself.
"Dean." He has to close his eyes, can't help it, not with all the warmth seeping from that one word, his name in an angel's mouth, this angel's mouth.
"I think you've been the only person to ever truly see me, Dean", he said, and Dean swallowed, lips parting, his eyes going wide and awed. Cas would never get enough of looking at him, touching him, learning about him, getting closer and closer and closer.
, out of heaven, out of his element, and it's all for Dean. Cas is here because he chose to be here, with him. At least that's what Dean likes to tell himself in the secrecy of that place in his mind where he keeps all the pretty little lies, wrapped in bows to mask them as truths even to himself.
At least he'd never said his name. He'd never said Dean. Maybe he couldn't bear to say it, now that he thought the person belonging to that name, the person he thought to be his friend, was capable of this.
to be here. "Because it is. Your home. As much as it's Sam's and mine and.....if- if you want that too, then..." Dean trails off, prepares to finally say the word he'd held back for so long.
"Damn right I would have! This is nuts, Cas! This-" He doesn't even have words for what this is, except for that it's wrong, especially if- "This is for me, right?", he asks, voice pained, and at least it softens the expression on Cas' face a little, even if the determination doesn't waver. "Yeah, you...you're doing it again, sacrificing yourself for me. But I won't have it, I told you-"
Somewhere in the back of his mind, he registered that there was a lot of touching going on right now, that maybe he should panic, but the thought was somehow dulled and far away.
, Dean suggested, claiming he couldn't let the time while Cas was low on angel-juice pass by without introducing him to the culinary wonders of a good cholesterin-heavy meal.
to take those tears. He could carry them, every tear he took was one that Cas wouldn't have to cry anymore.
And this is how Dean finds him, standing at the counter with his back to the door, an apron loosely tied around his waist, askew and dotted with splashes of grease. He's panting a bit and swearing a bit more and burning himself on the pan when he tries to pour its contents onto a plate and Dean just can't help but stand in the doorway for a moment, leaned against the frame and watching the scene with a smile on his face, torn between disbelief, amusement and a sheer overwhelming amount of fondness for the dorky angel in front of his eyes.
He's subconsciously making a list in his head. Reasons to love him, by Dean The Coward Winchester. Like a frickin teenage girl with a school crush.
"You have gone through something that no one should have to go through", he told him, leaving no room for objection. "And we...IÂ want you to get past this, Cas. The best thing you can do for us is giving yourself the time you need, okay? And I will do anything I can to help you."
He'd been hesitant before, not just for his own sake, but Dean's as well, knowing better than anyone how it felt to receive unwanted touches. Not that he would compare what happened to him with Dean's situation, but...
"Okay." Cas stands in the kitchen like a little boy on his first day at a new school, shy and awkward and insecure. Dean has to remind himself that this is an actual angel right there in front of him. Cas shouldn't ever have to look like that. And not because of him.
Bc in case anyone wants to know what Cas' mixtape contains, here's what I thought of: Enchanted, You Belong With Me, Sparks Fly, Gold Rush, Cardigan, Stay Stay Stay, Red, Daylight, Willow, Cowboy Like Me, Holy Ground, This Love, Mine
"Shit, Cas, especially then", he said, desperately trying to find anything that would keep Cas from leaving, leaving him, taking away that last shard of hope Dean had clung to all those years - even if it cut him open, lay him bare and vulnerable. "You should have someone you trust, someone who will know how to take care of you...the way you deserve."
"Of course not, Sam", Cas says, and somehow, it sounds like the most natural thing in the world coming from him. "That's an easy promise to make. I could never give him up."
Now, for all you pain and hurt/comfort addicts out there (looking at you, Charlie), and everyone who just likes our idiots in embarrassing conversations - hope you enjoy!! Looking forward to hearing your thoughts as always!
Their eyes meet, mirroring smiles lighting up their faces, and the fluttery feeling in Dean's chest finally lets him give in with a huff.
"What have you done to me, Cas?", he asked, shaking his head to himself in disbelief. "I've never...it's never been like this before. I couldn't even kiss that chick without- I...I didn't want her. She was right there and I- I couldn't." Dean huffed, drew a hand over his face. "And then I saw you...with him and I- Fuck, Cas. I wanted to be there", Dean admitted, "instead of him. I wanted to be the one...just sitting with you, talking to you, making you laugh..."
, for that matter." Dean can hear the meaningful smirk in Cas' voice, can clearly imagine the warm sparkle in his eyes. "Even though I won't deny it does have its merits. But just being with you is enough to make me happy, Dean."
Not that he's good at that. Hell no. Why master the task of forgiving yourself when you can go around accumulating guilt and regret like trophies, right? But he's gotten used to them. They don't torture him anymore at night, not frequently anyway, have long stopped to be constant residents in the back of his head. Nothing he's done or said is one of his biggest regrets. Nono. That's crap for people with normal small apple-pie lives and normal small apple-pie problems. Dean though, Dean's long figured out that nothing haunted as much as the things we
, Cas", he presses out, angry with himself that once again, it's not the words he'd wanted to say, not the words he meant.
Dean can hear his own pant in the silence around them, not knowing what feeling it is that provoked it. Surprise? Realisation? Relief? Gratefulness? They all muddle into one indistinguishable ball of emotion until he's unable to tell them apart anymore. That happens often. Feelings going down onto each other, mixing, fighting, creating a monster he can't understand anymore. Joy laced with fear. Relief laced with worry. He has long forgotten what it feels like to really know your own heart.
Dean doesn't have faith in life (he certainly didn't have faith in Chuck), but now, he knows he has faith in his family.
Cas closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. The exhaustion of their earlier activities finally catching up with him.
, as he walks down the path by his brother's side. He tears up just a little bit looking at the people gathered here, Donna, Jody and the girls, Garth and his wife, Charlie and Bobby from the other universe, even Crowley and Rowena. It does have some advantages to have the almighty God (sorry, the almighty Jack) at your wedding, stuff like getting the current Queen of Hell out of said Hell to officiate a wedding even though she's sort of dead becomes considerably easier, as well as having her annoying son back from the Empty, because even when he's a prick, he has grown on you like a creepy cousin you still can't help but want to invite to family gatherings.
Heyyyyyyy sorry this took so long, I was on vacation this week and the laptop refused to connect with the wifi:( I'm not sure how much time I'll have to write in the next weeks, my semester starts tmr and I have an internship coming up and two exam papers to write, but we'll see, I'll definitely desperately try to find time to write!
"Perhaps he got lost", Cas suggests. "I already checked this route twice. Is there anywhere else you think he might go?"
"I've got you." Dean was panting, his rhythm beginning to falter, their kisses turning sloppy. "You're safe with me, angel. My angel. Let go, sweetheart."
"I see", he nodded, looked into the dark green eyes that seemed to dilate further under his gaze, a heated, desperate quality returning to their depths.
He remembers replaying moments like the one he'd just witnessed in his head, those moments he'd fed on for years, clung to like a safe rope. Rides in the Impala. Evenings with beer and laughter. A smile over something Cas had said. A hand on his arm. A hug after a long time apart. In that moment, when he'd been sure that it was all gone, all he could hear were the words that he needed to say.
"Please don't." Dean's eyes seemed to be pleading as much as his voice. "We talked about his, Cas. I don't need anything more than what you can give. And it's not...it's not just because I thought
He'd thought maybe it would fade with time, that thrill that made his heart beat faster and his skin tickle with pleasure. Maybe it was just the newness, the excitement of a long-hidden fantasy finally coming to life. But it didn't go away. Not by the third time Cas touched him, not by the fifth either.
Dean, on the other hand, suddenly doesn't seem to be keen on admiring the wonders of nature. Or of letting Cas do it in peace. For soon enough the angel feels how Dean draws his nose up his neck, nuzzles it into his hair, places a kiss behind his ear, on his pulse point, making Cas shudder.
"You sure you don't need me?" The question has slipped before he'd known it lingered on his lips, but it doesn't really surprise him. The thought is nice, even though he knows the answer already. He can't leave his brother and Cas alone like this anyway. He doesn't actually want to, either. And still - the thought is nice.
"You can touch me too", the angel whispered against Dean's mouth as if he'd read his thoughts (had he accidentally prayed? Was Cas even recharged enough on mojo to hear his prayers?).
I'm so sorry, I know I'm behind my schedule. I just wrote like half of this, and it wouldn't be me if that didn't mean in the middle of the night. I'm really sorry this took so long, but this was the first chapter I built completely from scratch without any dialogue parts ready in my ideas folder or anything. This was a spontaneous decision, just an idea that came to me and wouldn't leave me again. I actually hate writing anything with even hints of plot as this, so I hope it didn't turn out weird.
It was hard and uncoordinated. Dean heard how Cas released a surprised grunt as he was dragged forward, but his lips felt chapped and soft and perfect. Dean couldn't help but close his eyes, savouring the contact, engraving every detail to memory so he could add it to his collection, revisit it later when this was over and he'd be alone again.
"I- " Was it too much? It was. But somehow, it also seemed like not enough. His mind told him he'd longed for something like this to happen, for more than this. His body didn't seem to agree. Cas bit his lip, felt his hands beginning to tremble, laced his fingers together to make it stop.
"You can lie down and I can..." Dean gave him a meaningful look. "I can see the effort it takes you", he explained, keeping the sadness over Cas' distress out of his voice the best he could, lacing it with warmth and understanding.
He could see the hesitation in Cas' eyes, his hand coming up to cradle his jaw, a thumb stroking tenderly over Cas' cheek.
"Dean", Cas breathed again, and they were so close Dean could feel the warm breath of air on his lips, sending a shudder down his spine.
that maybe he didn't think this through. Because now Cas is next to him in his bed, and Dean is wearing nothing but an old grey shirt and a pair of boxers. No, he certainly didn't think this through. He should know himself better, shouldn't he, should know that the mere sight of the angel so close and under his goddamn blanket would make the possesiveness he's not entitled to feel stick her head out of the box he tries to lock her in. Not to talk about the fact that his dick has
Dean's voice sounds casual, but Cas thinks to notice how he relaxes slightly, smiles to himself, small and silent, while his gaze glides over the lake. He takes the liberty to believe it's because Dean's actually happy to have him around.
But then he placed a kiss close to the corner of Cas' mouth, felt Cas turn his head slightly, as if chasing his lips, and he could feel a smile spreading across his face when he heard a small whine in Cas' throat when he pulled back.
"But I'd still like us to...get there together, so to speak", Cas went on. "Make it a joined experience, you know? So I thought...maybe with you...on top of me?" A slight blush spread on his cheeks. "No...p-penetration, I just mean-"
Cas knew that sex was important to Dean. Cas also knew that Dean didn't seem to be very comfortable with touching outside of sex. And maybe even then he could only let go because he knew he would never be seeing any of his partners again. At least that was what Cas had always assumed.
"Not quite as fast, but yes", he assured, soothed by the genuine worry speaking from Dean's voice. "They're part of our true forms, so their ethereal nature lets them work on their own, to a certain degree. The wound will close, the feathers return in time."
There it was, the guilt and the shame Cas had seen lurking under the pain and concern on Dean's face. It made a heavy weight settle over his heart.
If it had ever been one thing for him, it had been right. It was what had helped him the most, overcoming the pain, the memories, the flashbacks. It had been the contrast, the feeling of good and
"I didn't like it either." It was just a whisper, muttered into Cas' hair, but in Cas' ears, it rang clear as a bell. "When you left. Always thought maybe this time you wouldn't come back." Dean sighed, and it was a heavy sound, like the weight of the world was bottled up in it. "Just like everyone else. They all left, sooner or later."
He held his breath as he watched Cas' brow wrinkling for a second, eyes squinted, but then his head lifted, blue met green, and the furrow between his brows was smoothed out and replaced by a look of surprised awe. Cas opened his mouth, a wry smile curling the corner of his mouth.
. Dean hated himself for saying that. It went against everything his body and mind told him, against every thought and every feeling he had experienced with his angel in his arms. Every touch had fucking
"So bear with the truths I tell you now, dearest Castiel, may the manners perhaps have little to recommend them." He takes hold of Cas' hand, needs something to ground him now that he fully enters the territory of his own words. "Y'know, sometimes I-"
Disregarding the fact that he currently felt like he might die if Cas said no, he had to ask anyway. Of course he had to.
And Cas wouldn't be able to say it's really a conscious decision that drives him to do what he does next, it just happens, an instinct, a desire, a
Because you...you said to me that it was then you truly knew your feelings for me. And even though you've had them before that, it was then you acknowledged them, it was
"Dean, you-" Cas opened his mouth, stared at him with an unreadable expression. "Tell me again", he said then, pleaded.
"Of course not, Dean." Cas sounds a bit smaller than before, but he doesn't avert his eyes. "I'm not...afraid to touch you."
Pleasure was hooding Cas' eyes, but he could still make out the small spark of panic behind, pausing his movements.
Cas' brow wrinkled with worry as he watched howÂ Dean reached out, gently trailed a finger over his collarbone.
The content hum that reverberated through Cas' body made Dean close his eyes for a second, revelling in the angel's warm body against his, Cas' fingers painting slow patterns on Dean's shoulder. He breathed in, let the feeling of peace and happiness and
"Yeah..." Dean lets his gaze wander through the room, apparently unsure where to settle. She's aware that he's making excuses, and he's aware that she's aware. Because come on - fucking everyone would be aware. It seems like he doesn't come across anything worth focusing on, though, finding the courage to lock eyes with her after all.
He knew he was staring, probably looked like a fool, his eyes glued to Cas' lips like they held the answer to every question in the universe, like they were water while he was dying in a desert - and in some way, Dean knew that Cas was indeed the only thing, the only
Of course he, damn moron that he is, had to put that on the mixtape. The mixtape (read: the fucking love confession in disguise) that he was only able to get himself to give to Cas because he'd been sure Cas wouldn't know what it is, what it
I'm personally not quite satisfied with this chapter, but those sometimes turned out to be some of you guys' favourites so..we'll wait and see.
for them, more than once. And his family doesn't end in blood. He cares about Jodie and the girls, he cares about Donna, Bobby, Jack. Even Rowena. (Yes. Okay, fine, he could admit it here in the secrecy of his mind. Even Crowley. He's never gonna know that if Dean has anything to say about it, but yeah, even that little demonic prick has almost been like something resembling family. A very distant and creepy cousin, maybe.)
Dean tugged questioningly at the hem of his flannel. Jesus Christ, had he forgotten how to form full sentences all of a sudden?
The following weeks are busy with preparation. Despite Dean's best efforts, Sam and Eileen manage to turn it into a huge thing, when asked only smirking something about it being a one time opportunity to see your ship getting married (and your brother, Sam adds as an afterthought) and even though Cas isn't exactly sure what their wedding has to do with sea travel, he deems it wiser not to asks and just lets them do whatever they're doing.
But if Dean said he didn't mind not going further...if he said he'd gladly keep doing this just because it was with Cas....did that mean it was more than just..what Dean had called the physical desire?
"Normal relationship crap, y'know... I've just never been there. So if I'm being an asshole again for some reason...just don't give up on me, okay?" He lifted his gaze, found reassurance in the warm blue that met him. "Don't let me push you away", he breathed.
Dean sits up on his bed and watches how Cas strides for the door with his pyjamas in hand, gathered from one of the drawers that Dean had cleared for him some time ago. It had happened gradually, really. No big invitation or announcement, they just hadn't bothered sleeping apart ever since that first night, and the few things Cas possessed naturally found their way into Dean's room to stay there, little by little. Dean hadn't even noticed until he'd found a pair of ridiculously printed socks among the shades of black and grey in his drawer.
"Does that mean-" Dean broke off, tried to calm his suddenly far too rapid breathing, failed miserably. "Sammy, does that mean he's not healing?"
That was as far as they had gone so far, the most skin they had ever exposed, but Cas didn't make move to kiss him again, or tell him what else to do, just kept looking at him expectantly. Dean swallowed.
He gets up and pulls Cas up as well, immediately wrapping him in a hug, smiling into the angel's hair when he presses a kiss to the top of his head.
"Dude." Sam gives him an almost pitiful smile, eyebrows raised. "You owe me a therapy session", he says meaningfully. (That's when Eileen finally breaks from the laughter she's tried to hold back in one of the corners.) "And a pair of soundproof headphones", Sam adds at second thought, letting the smile spread over his face when Dean throws him a glance that somehow manages to be both embarrassed and annoyed.
Dean's mushy brain needed a second to grasp what the angel was asking, a gasp of surprised exhilaration running through his body when he understood.
He's half-aware that Jack is walking in front of them, throwing flowers that seem unnecessary to Dean because the path has already cheesily been laid out with white rose petals anyway, but he supposed if it makes the kid happy, then screw it. None of this is really about logic or efficiency anyway.
"And sorry, I don't have a ring yet", Dean breathes in the space between them, nuzzling Cas' cheeks and making him hum contently. "This was kinda...spontaneous."
Dragged out of a bar on a Saturday evening, a little more drunk than he cared to admit (though not entirely his fault) with an angel of the Lord holding his upper arm in a vice grip, dragging him along into the cold night air.
Someone who would curl around Dean, hug him from behind and pull him against a strong chest. With messy, dark hair tickling Dean's neck and a familiar, deep voice wishing him good night, eyes in his favourite shade of blue watching over him until he fell asleep...
"And that's your favourite?", Dean asks, skillfully avoiding an answer as he sits up fully to be on eye-level with the angel. "I...ah. I'd have thought you would have avoided any reminder of me, while we had this whole...", he gestures vaguely into the air, "...thing going on."
"Dean." Cas' free hand lifted to Dean's face, stroked a tear away that he hadn't even realised had rolled down his cheek. "I never wanted to leave you", Cas whispered, his voice so soft and sad. "All I ever wanted was for you to ask me to stay."
"I have", he says firmly. "And it's part of why I want it. I wanna..." He presses his lips together, but his eyes are determined and never leave Cas'. "I know I'm not good yet...with that whole affection in public business. But it got better. You helped me. And I think this will too. It would...give me a way to show it without actually having to do anything about it, y'know? And I do want that, Cas." Dean smiles, suddenly shy, but no less sure. "I want people to look at me and know that I'm yours. And that you're mine."
Fiiiiiiiiiiiinally another one done! I don't have as much time for writing at the moment as I'd like to. Meh.
"Can you ever be happy again, Cas?", it suddenly tumbled from Dean's lips, just as Cas had settled down into his embrace again, surprising them both. He wasn't quite sure where it had come from, and now of all times, when it had gone so well for once, when it felt like neither of them had ever been happier, at least Cas had seemed happy to him-
He looks very small all of a sudden, quoting back Dean's words at him, the lies he'd created to keep the angel at a distance. Dean feels the urge to reach out and touch him, comfort him, but he's not sure his touch would be welcomed right now.
Dean looks through the gap in the door to Cas' former room as he opens it, feels a weight being liftend off his chest as he spots the angel in front of the mirror, fiddling with his own tie, Dean's tie, the tie Dean had been thinking about just moments ago. Cas turns at the sound of his name, fingers occupied with tying the perfect knot.
"Is there anything you can tell me about how their bond changed? Anything at all? I know you say it's hard to describe but...did you sense..." He searches for words, which is hard when you try to comprehend something that not even the one
"Y-Yeah." Dean faltered for a second, taken aback by the accusation in Cas voice. "I mean...obviously."
He watches how Cas reaches around him and into the pocket of his coat that's hanging over the back of their chair, and when his hand appears again it's holding onto that little glass vial he had thrown at Dean yesterday. Now he is holding it out to him, cautious, hesitant.
And if Dean secretly put the feathers in a jar that he hid in his closet before returning to Cas with the mattress from a spare room, nobody ever needed to know.
"Only because I didn't want to make you uncomfortable. To give you space. Isn't that what you always told me? Personal space."
