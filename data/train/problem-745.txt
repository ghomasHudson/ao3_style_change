John moved away and turned the key in the wall for the grate to start a small fire before going to the small replicator and getting them tea. It gave him some time to try to understand the ebb and flow of what the bramble of emotion was. "May I ask why you are so upset? Don't deny it, I, well I can sort of feel it."
“I’ll get you journals; quietly. You must keep the PADD I give you off of any other network, as a matter of fact I will disable it. Will that make you feel marginally better?”
As I came to myself, Sherlock was glaring daggers at his father who, himself, was wearing a small smile even if Sherlock was being insolent. This was terrible. Embarrassing. How stupid was it for me to go into shock over a bowl hitting the ground. I hope I hadn't ruined tea for everyone, fainting like that. I wasn't some poncy sheltered twat that wilted at- oh. Well, yes blood did affect me, but the bulk of the thought still held merit. I knew I was blushing scarlet but I had to sit up and calm down and not make more of a spectacle than I already had.
The tease of the slim metal just at the ring of his anus, the soft (warmth) of the water against him made his head swim and his stomach clench tight. Sherlock took a deep breath and relaxed himself against the pressure as the tip slipped in readily.
IF THINGS BREAK OFF/GET SUCKED INTO YOUR BODY: Get to a doctor as soon as possible. PLEASE. This is very serious.
We broke apart just as dad opened the door. I went to the sink and washed my hands while Sherlock began chopping the rest of the carrots and parsnips.
I turned tomato red as he spoke. It was mortifying and I felt miserable and thankful all at once. I knew this talk would be coming, was most likely not over, but after today, I just didn’t want to even try. We lapsed back into silence as we finished eating. He cleared the table while I started on the dishes. He dried and set them in the rack. It was comfortable. Like we had done this same thing tons of times before. I told him goodnight after we were finished and I went upstairs unwillingly to work on my maths. I could feel a tradition in the making.
Greg seemed to feel awkward standing in the kitchen doing nothing; so he lumbered into the living room to watch some telly while I worked. We were both more comfortable that way. I called him in when dinner was ready, and he sniffed appreciatively as he walked into the room.
I stared back, surprised, expecting him to look quickly away. But instead he continued to gaze with probing intensity into my eyes. There was no question of me looking away. My hands started to shake.
The young man, Radar, interrupted immediately finishing Greg’s statement for him. “I’ll go ahead and get the brandy and cigars, yes, sir.”
“Something fortifying, yes.” Came the straightforward reply. Sherlock, himself getting arranged on their sofa, PADDs close at hand along with his own for notes John assumed.
There was a flurry of activity around us now. I tried to get up, but Sherlock's hand pushed my shoulder down even as he grimaced and swallowed hard. "Just stay put for now."
"More birds for you, you mean." Sherlock tried at a smile and felt it sit oddly. "That one, Mary, she's quite fetching. Soft. Bit round. She's sweet for you, you know."
The words caught in his throat, pulling at sudden tears he had to swallow to reply, quietly, “Nothing happens to me.”
Deployment orders practically vibrated in the hip pocket of John’s barrack khakis. He’d waited a long time. Now a battle song rang in his ears, something like thunder and heartbeats and the endless wash of ocean against rocks.
Captain John Watson leaned over a stack of papers, neatly collated and bound at the top right corner with a clip. The seals of Bart’s and Her Majesty’s Army were partially obscured, but the heading was bold and clear.
"Hermione, as you know, John's secret wasn't mine to give. I talked to you about this from the beginning. And Harry has all the new files; you do remember my wife works with him closely? I only need to remind you that she knows everything Sherlock does, or I do, as a matter of fact, so you must be reassured that she will not neglect to inform her boss about it. Or is my wife's professional demeanour in question now?"
As they reached the door, John started getting nervous. This is it. If he revealed himself to the head of the Institute, his days of hiding in London were over. He closes his fist, clenching and unclenching his hand. Magnus grabbed his shoulders then.
She bowed and left, John already fully dressed by the minute she stepped out of the room. Sherlock grabbed John’s hand and kissed his knuckles.
“Oldest by one minute, but oldest nonetheless. Oh, let the boy be, young one. He is funny. I like him. Best wishes for you both.”
"This can't be, there aren't any copies left in the magical world! All of them burned in the Secret Library of Alexandria."
The mask was already back on, and only John, with all his knowledge of the man before him, could detect the smallest hint of hurt in his tone. Sherlock stopped talking, and John had to prompt him to continue.
“It is, isn’t it? I can’t properly do it myself, I suck at healing charms, but you did wonderfully. Again.”
"So, I'll start at the beginning, I guess. I never told you much about my childhood. I grew up in Chelmsford, as you know, my dad worked at the post office, and my mom taught first form. Harry is two years older than me, and she never showed any magical signs at all. My mum told me she knew something was off with me since I was a baby, rattles and toys appearing in my crib after she placed them off the nightstand, and the mobile over my cot moving even when there was no wind. I think one time I made Harry's homework shrink when I was five. No one in any side of my family had ever shown any signs of magic before, but then my father's mother never knew her father, he could have been a wizard for all we know, that was something I never found out nor pursued any further. When I was seven, I fell off a tree at school and got to the floor without a single scratch on me. My mother decided it would be better to homeschool me then; she didn't want any questions asked that she couldn't answer. Even with schoolwork at home, it was easy for me to make friends with the kids in the neighbourhood and after that particular tree incident, nothing happened until my eleventh birthday. That day the owl arrived. It came to the kitchen; no one was there except my mom, so she took the parchment from the owl's leg, read it and kept it all to herself. The next day, Professor McGonagall and a Ministry official came to my door. My mom and dad had lots of reservations; they were terrified and unbelieving when they told them their youngest was a wizard. My dad even tried to kick them out of the house. It was McGonagall who got to them in the end. She practically assured my mother she would be responsible for my well being while at school. In the end, they agreed they would let her accompany my mom and me to Diagon Alley. I was there through the whole conversation and never let a word out until she said 'Goodbye Mr Watson', addressing me directly for the first time. 'Ma'am', was all I managed that time. After they left, my parents sent me to my room, and I could hear the heated argument from upstairs. The words 'freak school' and 'dangerous' came out from my dad's mouth a couple of times, growing increasingly louder each time. In the end, my mother won the battle, and the next day we went with the Professor into the Leaky Cauldron and the Magical World."
“You are a natural Johnny. Pity you don’t know if you want to keep doing magic, losing you would be a blow to the magical community.”
Bill and Ianto were full of manic energy, playing with the levers as John and Sherlock leaned near one of the walls of the control room.
Sherlock lifted his head to the man now, seemed satisfied and gave him a chaste peck on the lips. The man started again with his unholy pouting. John wanted the earth to open and swallow him whole from the moment their exchange began. Alissa seemed to read his mind, because she locked her arm around his elbow again, which managed to stop him from returning where he came from through the fireplace.
Stephen Herondale: Father of Jace Herondale, notable member of the Circle after Luke Garroway was vanished from it he became Valentine Morgenstern's right hand man. He was killed on battle, and his wife committed suicide short after his death. He was a descendant of Tessa Herondale.
“Eleven. Instead of going away to school, I was sent here. Then, to the Shadowhunter Academy. It wasn’t all bad. But Mummy and me, we knew this wasn’t the life for you. So when I was of age, and you were about to turn eleven, I struck a deal with the Clave. To spare you
Mycroft lifted his eyebrow but declined to comment on that statement. Instead, he addressed Sherlock.
“And she’s expecting a little bundle of joy? I’m sure your hands will be full, with your baby and hers. So good for them to have playmates from an early age. Your mother in law lives with them?”
"Dear friends and family, welcome to our home. Let us rejoice in celebrating a new year in the life of my little brother, Sherlock, now joined by his partner, Healer John Watson. Today, we celebrate both his birthday and the arrival of their daughter Olivia Watson-Holmes. Tonight, we celebrate not one, but two members of our family. I'd like to propose a toast, for Sherlock and Olivia."
For all the things that Sherlock sees, I seem to always be the last - but it’s fine. It has to be. He can’t see what I see - that he’s in love, and that even if it isn’t me, I’ll do what I can in my own way to protect that.
When William died, Mummy cried and Daddy cried. Mycroft was already five, but he cried buckets when they said his older brother wouldn’t be sleeping in the bed with the super hero sheets anymore.
But John arrived, and he found holding to his plan harder than he realised. Listening to his blogger plead more and more desperately to stop, come down, not do this, Sherlock felt a sharpness in his throat that had nothing to do with the cold rooftop wind.The script was exact, the call was being recorded. But the tears that threatened to spill down his cheeks… they were unplanned.
Caught out, he smiled, but she didn’t return it. There had been a time when it was easy to make women smile at him.
Left the bespoke lines, soft wool, and polished sharpness high above on Bart's rooftop with the burst blood squibs and blank-loaded Browning (a detail, so crucial and lovely) and waited.
No more goodbyes. No more begging. No more false lines to push between them. But John looked away, and he knew (he was Sherlock Holmes, after all) by the hunch of shoulders and small, firm line of mouth that John Watson was steeling himself for a truth they both knew, but would be forced to live without the rest of their lives. Throat tight, eyes swimming, Sherlock searched again for the lifeline - the hint that somehow it would all be alright. They would find a way to go on, even if it must be without each other.
“He is, and he isn’t.” Mycroft’s tone was prim and exact. “You are as much him as yourself. You know that.”
There had been mountains of paperwork before he could get on the plane: next of kin, last will, emergency contacts, verifying medical details. It had been torture to drag his men through the pile, unbearable to finish his own.
“John, there’s something I should say. I meant to say always and then never have… since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again, I might as well say it now.”
Up on the roof, with Moriarty’s body cooling behind him, Sherlock had been convinced he could brazen though Lazarus and jump without a second thought.
The thought sent sparks along the backs of his hands and up his arms. At the joint of his shoulder he felt runnels of electricity where new met old and the arm he’d lost fought for space with the one the RI had given him. His mouth firmed, tongue pressing against the back of his teeth.
Mycroft was thirteen now and missed nothing. As small and soft as Sherlock was, the little boy had a will of iron. Sherlock might not get far on the day he chose to run, but he would do it and possibly get hurt or killed in the process. Something would have to be done.
“John, you’re the first soldier to receive cloned transplants over 30% of your body. It’s going to take you a while to adjust to civilian life, to this” and here she gestured his outline with her pen, “Writing a blog about everything that’s happened will honestly help.”
He flinched, wondering where accusation came on the wellness scale. “You just wrote, ‘Still has trust issues.’”
Pressing his lips together firmly, Mycroft bent low and put a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder: “You will not run away. I won’t allow it. There’s far too much washing up to do in the house for just me. Anyway, they’ve bought you a puppy. Once they’ve had a chance to calm down you’ll get to name it.”
There was bird song, the echo of traffic, the pulse of life moving on even as John struggled to manage the afternoon. If a group helped where private sessions didn’t...
“They won’t let him go,” the little boy hiccupped between ragged sobs, smearing a wrist across his nose and cheeks. There was clay streaked along his jaw. Mycroft pulled a long sleeve over his hand and scrubbed the dirt a bit harder than he needed to.
Sherlock was incredibly intelligent – not quite as much as Mycroft, but perhaps that was for the best. The younger Holmes would not be placated for long by loyal dogs and sharp reprimands from his brother. Medical texts in the study were already going grubby under his small fingers. Ideas were beginning to boil over and facts were piling up in his head. He would be overwhelmed by it all before long if something wasn’t done to kerb him. Would the same have happened to William? Mycroft breathed a plume of mist; looked up to the emerging stars.
“But you can’t have serial suicides.” An interrupting voice. It was that little shit from The Globe.
There were hearings and protests. There were television debates between boring old men in stiff suits with poppy pins in the lapels. There was an EU tribunal convened to agree in limiting cloned organ transplants to less than 30% of an overall human body.
Sherlock had tipped over the lip of the roof, fallen silently, arms winging through cold London air. He'd met the path with what John knew to be a crunch of shredding femur, splintering tibs and fib, ribs popping, vertebrae compacting and severing nerves. The end of a body, the exposure of ribboned white ligaments.
But then, he did see me, finally. He stood in my lab and looked at me as if I’d come in to being before his eyes. It was like standing in full sun after a winter in the dark.
The midnight chases, the guns. The drugs, the knives. The explosives and the men who secured C4 putty to the chest of the only heart he'd ever have.
Rockets or jets overhead. In his ears the whine of onboard alarms, squeal of radio static as the Humvee driver relayed coordinates. The convoy speeding over rocky open land. Its cabin bounced, jostled.
Jim had never gone to ground so long in his life. He didn't mind a decent vanishing act so long as it was dramatic; but really now.
Because he is precious—unlike anything I ever held, or anyone who ever walked through the doors of Bart’s.
The therapist had been engaged by the RI when his night terrors had begun interfering with overnight stats. She met him in an unused office in Barts’ research wing twice a week. Her actual practice felt stilted, but the breathing exercises helped.

Sherlock was quiet through the whole thing, and John knew that look, storing and gathering data, sometimes he even wondered how much space Sherlock had for him on his Mind Palace.
“No. I’m currently living in New York, but I have a place in LA as well. And I also keep my family place in the Hamptons. Whenever I stay in London, I stay at Mac’s place. He is like a big brother to me.”
“Oh, is he the one with the long term liaison with a fairy? And a male fairy if I remember correctly?”
“Pleeeease Miff, even a blind man can see that the man is not completely straight either. He has been checking me out, for crying out loud, though I don't blame him. The man is at least attracted to men on some level. So I’m just saying I see why you like him, and I wouldn’t mind being on all fours for a man like that. I wouldn’t mind even if he had a Venomous Tentacula kink or something like that. So that’s that, and there's no need to be mad about it.”
Victor threw a positively smug smirk Alissa’s way and strutted to the fireplace. Alissa just shook her head.
John touched his wand to his temple, and they were both standing back in Mycroft's office. Mycroft was in the same chair, still reading the Daily Prophet.
John was crouched next to him, hand on his wrist, checking his pulse. He felt dizzy, but otherwise unharmed.
“He came a few minutes after we wound up there, carrying your sister in magical bindings over his shoulder. He seemed to be expecting someone else because he threw a killing curse our way and apparated out of it. I grabbed him, but he managed to shake me off. Mercifully, Gabrielle had a hold on me, and we wound up in London. We came back here a few seconds ago. You?”
“That’s it, darling. Daddy has you.” Sherlock could hear the soft laugh and knew it wasn’t out of spite. No, it was like honey. Sweet sounding. He wanted John to do it again. “Do you like that, calling me ‘daddy’?”
Once inside the classroom, I saw with relief that my table was still empty. Mr Gregson was walking around the room, distributing one microscope and box of slides to each table. Class didn't start for a few minutes, and the room buzzed with conversation. I kept my eyes away from the door, looking over notes I didn’t really need, and heard very clearly when the chair next to me moved. My eyes stayed carefully focused on the pattern I was drawing.
"That name, it's dreadful." He spoke as he pulled on his drab coloured coat and then looked to his arms before his irritation rose and he yanked it off once again in favor for the polished cotton Polynesian printed shirt that hung on the metal post at the end of the bed. "Might as well call me Prick, as it is, instead of hiding your opinion behind yet another Americanism. They are ruining the language, thieving magpies!"
“No,” She smiled with a small laugh. “I’m no figment. Real and all that. Name’s Geraldine, but no one uses it.” Her curled hair bounced a bit at the negating shake of her head. “So it’s either Nurse Taylor or Gerti for you.”
“Yes.” Sherlock smiled to himself then. Words weren’t expected. John felt how he was in pieces and was giving him time to sort it all out. “Thank you.”
"Do you mind if I look?" he asked as I began to remove the slide. His hand caught mine, to stop me, as he asked. His fingers were ice-cold, like he'd been holding them in a snowdrift before class. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an electric current had passed through us.
A few slow breaths later, mirrored by John, had him relaxing once again. John’s own breathing pattern had become heavier against him as he slowly worked just the first little bit of the long wand into Sherlock. The slush of the water was constantly running out of him. It felt odd and pleasing at the same time. Sherlock found himself holding his breath in anticipation of what they would be doing next.
“John, I’m going to get my father,” I felt ridiculous as they prepped to unload me, Sherlock scooting in the back to speak to me. "He's the best here."
“Why ever would I wish to do that?” The plain baffled look that crossed Sherlock’s face was a sight to behold.
"Why would it change if you've already spoken your mind?" John was surprised that he could still feel the unraveling of each emotion as Sherlock thought to himself; the way they tapered down to a low hum from the roar that they practically had been.
He laughed. “Oh, this is going to be grand!” He bent over and began scraping together a pile of the white mush.
I glanced at him without thinking and told the truth again. "Not exactly. I'm more annoyed at myself. I have apparently been doing a horrible job of... it doesn’t matter.” I frowned.
Sherlock sighed and looked around the room for a trace of the young woman that had most certainly been there. It was as it should have been really, no outward sign in the sterile room. Maybe just a hint of her perfume, Evening in Paris,
“I did just say, John. Are you feeling well?” He wondered if it might have been too much to ask. No, he had calculated, and it was correct of him to ask.
But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was something different, and I couldn't quite pinpoint what that difference was. I noticed that Sherlock's skin was less pale, I decided the circles under his eyes much less noticeable. Yes. He had definitely been ill. He looked, well. Better. Healthy.
"No, you haven't," I swallowed, the gravity of everything coming to the surface. "We haven't; it may be a little soon, but maybe not for us?"
And that was the last contact I'd had with him, though he was there, a foot away from me, every day for the last couple of weeks. A welcoming remark on my end, a nod, side eye, or on good days a rough acknowledgement as if his voice was unused for days on in. Maybe it was. He looked fragile. I watched him sometimes, unable to stop myself— from a distance, though, in the cafeteria or parking lot. I watched as his silvery eyes grew perceptibly darker day by day.
The doctor was most certainly teasing Sherlock now and he had no idea how to handle it. Was this normal, their banter? He had never heard of this, nor had anyone propositioned him so gently. How was he to handle the immensity of what he was feeling at this pace? He felt as if ripping his clothes of and flaying him would be better in comparison and leave him less bare.
“John.” Sherlock kissed against the deep thrum of John’s heart and snugged back into his embrace. “It was... I am sorry though... You didn’t-”
"Sherlock Holmes, he was standing next to me." I gritted my teeth swearing in my mind to stop the rise of bile. I refused to vomit. Again.
Monday came in a little warmer, but devolved quickly. This did not help my mood. Molly and Mike met me in the car park and we walked to class together, Molly splitting off to her own while we went to class. I was actually beginning to feel comfortable here I realised, even if the weather was making me down. When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. I could hear people shouting excitedly to each other. The wind bit at my cheeks, my nose.
He couldn't help but to laugh honestly as John continued their banter. He'd begun stripping his day away and was splashing cold water from the basin onto his face and neck. This ease between them had been immediate which had never occurred in Sherlock's life before this. He chalked it up to a shared gallows humour and the lack of belief in a higher-power to get them out of the Hell they were currently living.
Sherlock just lifted a hand to stop him. "No blood, no foul," he said, flashing a brilliant smile. He moved to sit on the edge of Philip's bed, facing me. Smirked again. "So, what's the verdict?" he asked me.
Point was, it would be empty. Quiet. Not as bustling as the dormitories or as drab as that little hovel of a flat he currently occupied. No room for experiments. Only a hot plate and kettle. Not that food really mattered that much too him... It was the principle of the thing. If this were any other time, he would have been working at Bletchley alongside Turing and other marvelous code-breakers or being whisked away to program for NASA. Praised for his intelligence. Yes. His co-workers might not have liked him (not that he was not well liked now), but it would have at least been fulfilling.
Gripping at his shirt, blushing so hard my ears rang, I came right to the edge. Sherlock whispered back, his voice yanking somewhere low at my gut as he spoke. The sweetest things were coming out of his mouth as he clasped my hip, his elbow giving him counterpoint to push me over. I felt the deep tug, the pull of orgasm and prayed I wasn't shouting out. Our mouths found each other again. Sherlock continued to slowly rock against me, pressing kisses, talking softly as I came back to myself.
Thank you all for being patient. This one was a bit of a bugger, but that's ok. All of you who have commented or kuddoed- this is a serious heartfelt thank you. I love having feedback and knowing that you are enjoying this insanity. *kiss*
"I'm fine." My voice sounded strange. I tried to sit up, and realized he was holding me against the side of his body in an iron grasp.
Sherlock looked over sharply at me, his face still sort-of open, then the moment was gone. I watched as he shuttered himself in. A second later the bell rang and Sherlock swiftly left the class for his next one I presumed. Maybe he had a few things he was keeping close, too.
“Thanks-s-s.” His mugger said quietly, the word spoken through his tightly clenched teeth, as the man properly shouldered the thing again.
Standing by his bedside was a nurse; but the attire seemed off. Her blue sleeved frock, with white pinafore, seemed more fancy dress then the scrubs Sherlock was accustomed to. Perhaps he wasn’t at Bart’s at all, could he be so off that he was at an older privatised hospital? Had Mycroft had his way and actually instituted a secret portion of the NHS for care? It was preposterous.
"No.” I whispered gruffly and looked around under my lashes. “It’s- it was fine. He’s too young, maybe, but nice enough."
Sherlock nodded then, dropping the towel along the foot of John’s bed, and kneeled up onto the mattress. His whole body felt electric. “Like this?” He turned, looked back and gingerly sat over John’s extended legs, his cock nestled against John’s thighs.
Sherlock visibly bristled. “You’re an ex-military doctor... army most likely. Went in after becoming a surgeon, not before, so it speaks of wanting to be where you thought you would do the most good given your specialisation, so surgeon. That would have been... twenty years of service before you retired and decided to seek a more sedate life, possibly a wife. Somehow though, you missed it, the travel and excitement, so just recently you began working with Médecins Sans Frontières. Which is both thrilling and filling your need to help others that are in desperate situations. On your off time from that, you are partnered as a cardiothoracic as well as vascular surgeon and have decided to teach part time as well. Maybe to a very limited and or specialised group that would benefit from your specialised techniques being taught to them.”
I was so indifferent, I couldn't even concentrate on Mike's chatter as we walked to our cars. He noticed and just smiled widely before continuing on. The rain was just a mist as I walked to the parking lot, but I was happier when I was in the dry interior of the Mini. I got the heater running, unzipped my jacket, and ran my fingers through my hair so the heater could dry it on the way home. I looked around me to make sure it was clear.
It took the co-ordination of adults and responders to shift the car far enough away from us to bring the stretchers in. Sherlock vehemently refused his, but looked almost impossibly broken as he relinquished me to the adults. Everyone present watched soberly as they loaded me in the back of the ambulance. To make matters worse, Greg arrived before they could get me safely away.
John moved glacially slow, it seemed, then he didn’t. Their mouths were together and it was warm. Dry and a little soft. Ticklish. He inhaled softly from the surprise of it; John chased it with a soft touch of his tongue as his thumb caressed Sherlock’s cheek. It was heaven. He followed John’s lead and opened, letting him in to explore, promptly losing his breath at the intimacy of it. Instinctively, his hands found John’s waist to steady himself.
“Reach over and get the lube only, there’s a good boy.” He moved down to kiss at Sherlock’s hips and stomach and pressed a thumb against his anus. “Have you touched yourself here, love?”
"O-oh. So it's- blokes then?" John had lowered his voice as he turned and took his small towel and dried his face and hands. His cheeks were a little more coloured than Sherlock had expected, but there was no wariness telegraphed in John's movements. "Which is fine, just so you, well, it's all fine here. With me."
“Look, I know you- I know you saved me.” I said each word slowly, carefully. "I'm not going to tell anybody, but it matters to me," I insisted. It was hard to say what came next. "Thank you for jumping in and- you could have- as well you know. I don't know how you deflected Philip's car, but, thank you."
“Yes, John, exactly. But that is for antidotes, more like the First and Second laws. It applies to every potion. If you know what to look for.”
“Alissa said she managed to touch him. She will be getting a vision of him soon, and we’ll have a second chance at catching him alive.”
And soon enough, they were by a river in a secluded spot on planet Earth, were a silver haired Scotsman with bushy eyebrows was sitting near a group of otters. His expression changed from pensive to annoyed when he caught sight of them.
She signalled her extended family, son and daughter emerging from the first car. Sherlock was standing awkwardly in the background, as Victoria grabbed his arm and placed him in front of his mother. She pulled the tall man down and gave him a peck on the cheek.
So those were the famous members of the golden trio. John already suspected Alissa was Mycroft's wife, so not the ex, and Sherlock is gay. He knew the whole affair with Janine was a ruse to get to Magnussen, but somehow really knowing that Sherlock was indeed gay and that he looked happy in a picture with his ex, made John have a lot of unhealthy thoughts.
She then looked at John, who was still sitting in his chair. She frowned, and the man sighed before standing up and scooping her out of the floor, grabbing her legs so fast that Sherlock couldn’t really catch the movement. He had her on his arms like a blushing bride, giggling as he gave her a kiss to her forehead.
“Well, are you done with the useless facts, little brother? We need to see this Gideon about a dead Shadowhunter and fairy.”
At that, Mycroft’s eyes had a strange gleam in their eyes. Interesting, John thought, the so called Iceman had feelings for someone other than immediate family.
"No, but Potter is the Head of the Auror office, so he is sometimes with my brother these days. I've never been around both of them though, exile and all..."
"We were planning a birthday dinner for you in our house, as a matter of fact. Mummy was coming anyway, but I have to admit she's dying to see you again,
"I think she is acting a little closed about him right now. Not once did she mention anything. I don't know. You think she might be feeling I would judge her or him?"
He winked at John, and he could see both his eyes were blue, as he wore them at the wedding party. Also, he was smaller again. He was indeed a very handsome man, and he had a pleasant expression. John didn’t know how long he could manage to hate the man. He grabbed John’s arm with his right hand and steered away from the park into a cafe.
"Nonsense. Mycroft loves him. He's mad, but if someone else had tried what Victor did, he would be stuck in the brain room and would no one would ever hear of them again."
. He grabbed Victor’s arm without one more word, and apparated them just at the front step of the Leaky Cauldron, away from the eyes of prying muggles. John waved at Zack as they passed through the pub, and he wondered why he didn’t felt the usual dread as he walked through the old floor. John tapped the bricks, and they walked into the well-lit alley.
“Harry. I sent the Patronus. My brother got it instead. I was probably in too much emotional turmoil to concentrate on anything but the message.”
“And I’ll do it if he even looks at me the wrong way, Mycroft. You don’t have to worry. I trust John’s judgement completely. I trust this man with my life.”
pencil and paper”, and soon said items appeared flying through the dining room doorway. He took the fork, and removed the plate, and placed the pencil and paper in front of his wife.
Sherlock seemed indignant on his behalf, and that did wonders for John's current dark mood. He must enjoy this, his friendship with Sherlock, for whatever little time they had left.
After the battle, people started talking about the new Accords, and they wanted either Harry or Magnus as a representative for the Council. It was John’s cue to leave, before someone realized who he was. He waved at his siblings, and conjured a portal outside of the Hall. It was forbidden, of course, and that made him want to do it, more than ever.
She pouted and touched her dress with her wand, which changed into plum wizarding robes. Then she transformed herself into the gorgeous man John remembered from the wedding picture, almost nose to nose in height with Sherlock, with the same blue eyes and the same pout.
John was eerily quiet, as he reached for both Victoria and Sherlock’s arm. Portland, Portland. He searched his memory for the best place for apparition, an alley near the main entrance. He soon apparated them, and they started running to the revolving doors of the emergency room. Portland was a beautiful place, one of the best private Hospitals in London, and he internally blessed Mycroft for having the best care available for his wife and baby. They reached the reception in minutes, and soon they were moved into the maternity ward. Gabrielle was standing outside a private room, and so were Mycroft and Alissa.
“I’m impressed you only got three cases. She got five out of Tum and me. Well, we didn’t have to apologise.”
"Obviously. I wouldn't be wandering in wizard clothing, in a magical street and a magical bookstore if I was a muggle. You are one too, and how that fact has seemed to elude my mind for years is one that is bothering me right now. You remember how I despise ignorance."
John was still looking at Sherlock and Mycroft when a soft groan called his attention. Alissa was waking up, still hanging from that blasted hook. Mycroft walked to his wife and vanished the flames with a wave of her wand. He was shaking as he dislodged his pregnant wife from the hook, and as she gained consciousness, she looked at his face in a fury and slapped him. Mycroft looked hurt, but he soon was composed enough to talk.
John laughed, something the charms master and him shared, then. But he didn't think the voice had the same effect on the tiny professor that it had on him.
At that, John lifted one eyebrow in surprise, but before he could say anything, Sherlock resumed his story.
John felt he was finally getting to the bottom of the Holmes sibling rivalry, knowing something terrible must have happened all those years ago to make a brother erase his sibling from his memory. He knew Mycroft's twin must be dead by now, or he would have seen him.
He turned a knowing glance directed to Sherlock, smirking, and the look of outrage on the detective's face would have made John laugh if the whole situation wasn't so inappropriate as a whole. Percy took some powder from the fireplace mantel and threw it on the open fire, muttering 'Department of Magical Transportation,' before disappearing back to his office.
"I think I can handle it, with Alissa and Victor, if you let him. John can join us now if he wants to, that is."
“That was the reason you stayed out of touch all those years? I thought you hated me, and resented you for that.”
"It is Mycroft, she always thought of looking for it. She took years of leave, but she managed to get her hands on this. No wonder Moran was after her. He must know she had it. She was brilliant,
"I'll be expecting it Mycroft. Mr Holmes," she seemed pained by the very act of addressing Sherlock, disapproval still in her face, "John."
“Sherlock, John, this is our daughter Jackie. She was trying to find her grandfather on my TARDIS before we decided on calling for your help.”
Mummy seemed to have danced enough for the night. She moved towards her youngest son with a look of happiness on her face. She pulled Sherlock down for a kiss on his cheek, received under duress.
Sherlock turned to look at his friend, who was laying on the floor under the ministrations of the other two.
“Ahhh, self-cleaning robes. Victor managed to perfect it then; he was working on that a week or so ago. How many bites does he have?”
“Fine. So I guess I’m are done here. Harriet, feel free to stay and discuss whatever you wanted to discuss with the Praetor here. I did not leave the Institute for this.”
For those who skipped the last chapter, Mycroft and Victor are both injured after saving the day, they finally managed to capture a semblance of Moran that will enable them to track him to his real body.
“No, angels, demons and fairies are immortal too. But vampires are the only immortal ones who were human once.”
Sherlock winced at the recognition, and stepped into the background, standing near one of the walls.
“Sherlock is right, love. Your grandma will freak out if she sees you and will definitely shoot you.”
And John extended his hand for him to shake. Victor reached with his right hand, but John shook his head.
One of the things he appreciated more about Sherlock was that silence with him was pleasant, John should have realised a long time ago, one of the clues you were with the right person. No uncomfortable silences. John kept going over and over about the things he didn’t do this past few days for Libby, feeling all the guilt as it caught up with him.
John could see the compulsion spell working on Sherlock. When he handed his wand back to Mycroft, his eyes were out of focus. Mycroft pulled his wand out, and soon it was back in whatever secret compartment of Mycroft's existed in the void. As his eyes went back into focus, Sherlock grabbed the old alchemy book and started looking through the rest of the texts. He took a second book, a small blue one, and placed it in his robes. Then he set the old alchemy book into Alissa's hands.
John thought all first times with a new partner were supposed to feel a little awkward, but he and Sherlock just seemed to be made for each other. No words were needed, as they both explored each other, taking their time, washing away years of uncertainty. After they got their release and finally scrubbed each other clean, he could feel Sherlock’s mood improving; he seemed happy with whatever ‘sorting’ he made with Harry in his office. They got dressed and met Victoria in the hallway, as she was exiting her room. She was wearing a beautiful pink dress and pink heels, with a checkered pink coat.
“No, he became a hunter himself. A Shadowhunter. And they don’t really kill vampires anymore. They have a truce.”
Both Harry and Alissa disapparated. John found himself back at Mycroft's office, next to the pensieve. Sherlock was standing right next to him.
“Sal, go get the boss. Tell him we have unexpected guests. You know the drill, umbrella by the door.”
“Don’t worry. I don’t think the Night Children will join us tonight. They still haven’t made their minds.”
Mary was furious, and if he didn't detect a hint of fear in her voice, he might have been worried about his safety.
"You never asked for an explanation, when I fell. You never asked, and I only could tell you part of it anyway. Magic was involved in half of it; the jump was real. Alissa placed an
Victor kept looking at him apprehensively, as he couldn’t believe what John was offering him. John held his extended hand, waiting for the man to make up his mind.
“I don’t see them, Sherlock, but usually ghosts choose who they reveal themselves too. Or maybe your sight is just extraordinary, because they aren’t approaching you or anything, right?”
Victor beamed at him, and Sherlock just slapped the back of his head. He scowled back at the detective, touching his head in annoyance.
“Nonsense cutie pie, you can’t blame yourself for an Imperius curse! He was a mighty wizard indeed, and he took advantage of your broken heart. You just discovered your mentor murdered; surely you were distraught. He might never have got to you in another moment.”
He trailed after his friend, when his backpack chose the convenient moment to split up in two, spilling his ink all over his books and said items all over the place. Oliver was already turning the corner, exiting through the doors for the central staircase. He started to pick up his book as swiftly as possible when he saw a boy in Slytherin robes lean down and start helping him pick out his books. He was very tall, but he couldn’t be more than a third year, still, to the first year and already short for his age John Watson he was enormous.
"The first look at Diagon Alley, my mum passed out. The Professor placed her in a chair, smelling salts and all like a Victorian Lady, and when she came to her senses, she looked terrified. She looked at me, at the Professor, and, the look on her face, Sherlock. Fear. She looked at her son with fear. She asked McGonagall if she could take me to get my books and supplies for school. She'd rather trust her son to a complete stranger, a woman she only saw once in her life before, than face the unknown."
They took the lift down; Sherlock was quiet, he gave the trio some space. When they reached the front, two cars were already waiting for them. Oliver and Harry climbed into one, and Sherlock and John rode the other. Sherlock was quiet, but John caught him trying to talk to him, then stopping again.
Sherlock scoffed at him, rolling his eyes, and they wandered, John merely trying to put some distance between Sherlock and Clara, until they bumped into Oliver, who was looking behind his back at where Victoria stood surrounded by Roman and a circle of fans who kept getting bigger by the second.
"Nothing settled yet, we still have a lot of ground to cover today. I want to see Elle's memory of the incident in Paris."
"Excuse me", a deep baritone voice said, a sound he would recognise anywhere, which he did not expect to hear there.
“Dog-headed monster that roams Louisiana swamps. Alissa’s great-great-grandmother, Marie Laveau, had one as a pet.”
Sherlock nodded. He trusted the man with his life, even if he was keeping secrets from him. He tried in vain to remember the restaurant. John went upstairs to his old room, and he came back with a jar. The jar had something sticky in it, and Sherlock couldn’t really see what it was. John applied the contents to his back, and soon the pain was gone. In fact, he felt much better, almost as if he didn’t have any wounds left at all. Now the only thing he actually felt were John’s strong hands working on his back.
“I had this made for you today. I’ve just transfigured the original pair into your jacket. Now you can do this.”
“Those are from Venomous Tentacula, right? Why didn’t I see them before, when Moran poisoned you? Or when you almost died in the cave?”
John squeezed his hand, looking directly into his partner's eyes, letting him know without words how much it pleased him that he had done this for him and the family. Sherlock smiled at him and uttered softly, "So? Can we leave?"
“She wanted us to keep it hidden, because of my work and her family. But we had been together for five years now. I wanted to tell you, but…”
"Harry's. When he is on site, his memory is the official case file. I have Lissa's as well if you care about her point of view dear brother."
Just on cue, Percy Weasley appeared at the fireplace, removing ashes from his coat and carrying a common fountain pen.
Alissa looked back at Sherlock, eyes bright and a smile on her face. Mycroft smirked back at Sherlock.
The house was almost half an hour away from London. It had a beautiful front garden, that looked better kept than the last time John saw it. They went through the gates, and Mummy Holmes was waiting for them in the doorway.
He reached the cottage quickly, even though he had never been there before. Dennis Creevey was sitting in the front garden and waved at him from his guarding post. John acknowledged him back and entered through the front gate into the front yard. It was a beautiful place, with a beautiful rose bush in front. He went into the cottage and found Mary having breakfast with Gabrielle in small, but well stocked, modern kitchen. He greeted his wife, and he felt her stiffen a little when he bowed down to kiss her cheek.
Victor was starting to look a little better. Harry was talking in a low voice with Alissa and Gabrielle, who looked worried.
“I know you don’t believe me. But today I was there with you, and I could see the bodies. DI Hopkins and his team couldn’t see them. And surely you noticed how Mycroft and his team were examining them, clearly they could see them. So did Greg and his team, for that matter.”
is still angry at you. We want her to help, not throw us out of her office. You stay put. Really. I mean it.”
“I think we are at the right spot, but we must confirm before pulling the others from their locations.”
Their foreheads were touching at that, and as he pulled farther off without releasing his grip on John’s back. Sherlock gave him a predatory gaze as if going further was the only thing in his mind at the moment.
That night as he was changing and brushing his teeth in the bathroom, Sherlock caught a glimpse at his back. He could almost swear there was nothing there, not even one wound.
"I'm going to tell you this, and then you are going to obliviate me, John. Mind you; I only need to forget his name. His name was Sherringford Holmes. He was Mycroft's twin brother. I overlap my memories of them most of the time because they were inseparable since they were born. Sherringford was born a few minutes before Mycroft, and he was very good looking. Not as smart as Mycroft, well, not even as smart as me. They were twins, but not identical, like Fred and George, but they still had that bond. I remember I always felt like an outsider with them, because of the age difference and the bond they had."
He looked at John like that wasn't a sure thing, and John felt terrible about that. Surely after all that they had been through Sherlock knew he would stand by him, no matter what? But he was staring at the floor now, waiting for a denial from him. Well, John won't have that.
“There’s too many of us. Some alternate doors in the Department of Mysteries only let one or two people pass. I believe if we choose the correct door, we can all pass. We have to open all doors at once.”
John knew there wasn’t a way out of it now, he wanted to do it in private, but evidently Roman wanted to see his celebrity patient now. Mycroft intervened before John could answer.
"Preposterous. No, I'm afraid I lied to you, inadvertently I might add. I've never told you what happened to my other brother."
Magnus asked softly, basically speaking in a whisper, probably not meaning Mycroft to hear him. But Mycroft knew how he managed, how he still manages, duty, honor and the man standing beside him holding him, that’s how he escaped the certain madness that comes with losing a parabatai bond. He remembers the real moment he lost his parabatai, all those years ago, when he found him and two other members of the Circle cornering a young werewolf in an alleyway in London.
“I realized who you were as soon as I met your dear sister here. When she took the post and finally agreed to meet with me, it was obvious. My brother, living with one of the Sun twins. Talk about twisted fate. I’ve been protecting him from the Clave my whole life, shielding him from the Shadow World. But he goes and falls for one of the oldest warlocks alive in the world, a man who is known to be a recluse and not very nice. A bit of a hermit. People talked, you see. Even other warlocks. They said you had gone crazy with age.”
Gabrielle was still crying next to her former boss. John touched his wand to his temple and offered Sherlock his hand. The detective grabbed it and gave it a barely perceptible squeeze.
Yes, yes, I know this one is short, but I wrote this one a while ago, and wanted to cut it right there, sorry, but I'll update sooner than the week this time, since chapters 4-10 are done already. And also, I know I used the most used trope ever to exist in this fandom (Sherlock's back after Serbia) but at least in this case he is not getting any scars :D.
Sherlock and Victoria were standing side by side near the wall, talking in hushed voices. Victoria still had the red-rimmed eyes and looked caffeine deprived.
Then he disappeared through the window with Molly right behind him, the rest of them stood, John and Harry looking and moving to the window, not before John growled at Sherlock who was trying to get a look.
Moran’s body started coming apart in pieces, skin, muscle, organs, bones, even the eyeballs, blood spilt to the floor. John looked around in horror as the body parts still glistened, looking remarkably alive, for body parts spread on the floor, that is. The eyeballs even moved from side to side. John wasn’t squeamish, he was a doctor for God’s sake, but the sight was enough to make his skin crawl. The doctor took a look at the brain before deciding it was better to look away. Victor was still on his back, apparently drained. Mycroft fell on his knees, his face paling, and he grabbed his chest. John moved to him, as Sherlock ran to his brother, pulling a potion out of his robes and thrusting it into his brother’s mouth without a word. Mycroft still looked pale, but he stood up, grabbing his sibling’s robes.
“In this world, Gregory Lestrade is a very important man. If I want to keep peace between our allies in this city, I’ll do my best to avoid displeasing the leader of the London pack.”
“There. Now you just look like a gay pornstar from a low budget movie. We’ll call it the pornstache.”
“Unfortunately my dear someone has to get everything ready for tonight! Such short notice! Martha is coming over to help, but dear me, there’s a lot of people coming over and a lot of planning to do. My daughter had to wrap everything at the office, but she’ll be home soon enough. But I don’t want her to exert herself, you know, with the baby and all. A granddaughter and a grandson. It can’t get any better than this.”
“Now you just ruined it, John. You name your daughter after a queen and choose a pedestrian nickname?”
"I'm a wizard, a half-blood. My mother, the brilliant mathematician, is also a witch. My father is a muggle. My mom fell in love with him at Uni, which she attended after Hogwarts. She was not very fond of the wizarding world, had many friends and family members killed in Voldemort's first attempt to take over. Many of them fled to France at that time, her family name is Greengrass, and some of them were on Voldemort's ranks. But her mother was a Weasley, so they had people on both sides of the war. After that, she decided to test her luck in the muggle world, and she and one other cousin on the Weasley branch of the family were the first ones to pursue anything outside the magical realm. I believe he is an accountant and the black sheep of the Weasley family."
“Oh, yeah, can’t you see it? Mmmm, I bet you can’t. He looks lost. A lost Miff is a sad Miff. I could give you a ‘Miff expressions 101’ if you need it, hon.”
This was the first time John let Sherlock tell that story; he never wanted to hear the logistics of his fall. He knew he was in danger at the time, Sherlock had hinted something, but this was the first time he heard Greg and Mrs Hudson received direct threats. John was secretly glad he kept his questions to himself because he now knew he would have listened to an elaborate lie instead of the whole truth. That somehow made it all a little better, knowing Sherlock thought that, because John was a muggle, his best friend could never be a part of his magical escape. But still, he felt deeply hurt and jealous even, that Sherlock was able to completely confide in two others, two unknown figures that were important enough to be a part of it while John was out of the loop and mourning his best friend. As always, completing his thoughts, Sherlock continued his tale in a sad tone.
He took the tube home, and he walked the two blocks from the station to his house. He opened the door and found Mary reading a book in the sitting room.
She nodded and placed the dark book under her robes. John kept thinking this day could not end soon enough.
They started researching, Sherlock pointed to a stack of newspapers and John started going through them, setting aside notes that he thought might help the case. That gave Sherlock plenty of time to look at John. After all this time, seeing the object of his affection became a need. He started by committing John’s face again to his mind palace. The dreadful mustache. The lines, wait, it seemed his eyes were unlined now. His hair was blonder, not even a hint of grey. The lines around his mouth were softer now too. If anything, John looked younger than before. Sherlock rose from his chair and crouched before John, actually staring at his face.
isn’t going to help you always. You don’t have enough practice. Your grandmother must be rolling in her grave.”
“We could go see how Victor is doing now, and after that, you can make your decision. I assure you, if I see anything going in the wrong direction I will bring him back, in fact, I know Mummy would make him come if he doesn’t want to. I’ll see to it that he finishes his potion and gets the next dose in time, and surely he would be better off in his own home?”
He was smirking, clearly the joke wasn’t related to John’s height. He actually made Sherlock blush a little.
The lights from the incubator started flicking, and the doctor looked worried for a second. John took his hand out, and the lights went back to normal. It’s been ages since he lost his control and produced involuntary magic, but, strangely, he didn’t even feel it go through him.
“Are you sleeping still? Don’t be an idiot John; we need his real body. I don’t know if he can get another body while this one is still alive, I think even Mycroft doesn’t know if that’s possible.”
"No traces of magic or any spells in place. He must have erased the protecting spells from the cottage. Alissa, do you see anything?"
He tried to open the book, but the pages were stuck together. Sherlock worked on it a couple of times, before extending his hand to Victor. Victor looked at Mycroft, who nodded, and he pulled his wand from his robes, handing it to Sherlock.
"Chamber opened. Your mum panicked and sent you to France. Many kids were taken out of Hogwarts that year. My parents never knew students were under attack, specially Muggleborns, or they would have pulled me out too."
"She saw you and John at the Leaky Cauldron yesterday in a vision. We both decided not to act on it. She has also started having visions of William on a daily basis."
“It’s not your fault, besides she is getting a discharge tomorrow. And Father and Mummy are going to spend the night with her, Father while the party is going on and Mummy will take over from him. They were waiting for your approval to take over.”
The final showdown, and Sherlock gets to show off his skills as a potion master. Some truths are revealed and finally things seem to be brighter for one John Watson.
He allowed himself to be guided by his partner and soon enough they were again in their room. He did his bedtime routine in automatic, watching as Sherlock did the same beside him, both wholly used to being around each other as if they had done this over and over and nothing had ever changed between them. John really must have done something right before, to deserve something like this, something that was perfect. When he finally reached the bed, it was to the sense of a warm body beside him, and that was pure bliss.
“Yes, when the poison started its effect, Sherlock had a small vial and gave it to his brother, and his wife apparated him immediately here. We brought Victor later.”
He never knew what his brother saw in associating with vampires, after all this time and all of John’s warnings he was still friends with the likes of Raphael Santiago, the current head of the New York vampire nest, guarding the post for his brother’s ex-lover, that treacherous leach known as Camille Belcourt.
Oliver looked at Sherlock, and then his gaze went down to John again. He was still taller than John, had always been since they were kids.
“Each door handle was a trap, he was expecting us. He picked one of us to taunt on each door. The Venomous Tentacula was for me, the fire for Harry, the acromantula for Victor and whatever Creevey and Prewett are facing is for another one of us. The rest of the team was unable to see him? I wonder how he managed to acquire all this knowledge about us. Not many people know that Victor has an irrational fear of spiders.”
“Victor is a woman a big percentage of the time, John. He can be, he physically is one, his abilities let him do as he pleases, most of the time. Were you flirting with him because he is genderfluid?”
John gave the finger to Victor, who just licked his lips the way John usually did subconsciously, which only made him laugh. He read the spell and the motions three times out loud and three times in his head, before standing in front of his mirror image. He started on the conjuring, and it took just one failed try before the scar began to fade.
"John. Even though I left my old life behind, I can look after myself and my child. I can even look after you. It doesn't matter who is targeting us. We can both hide without Mycroft if it comes to that."
John Watson was very special, thank you very much. He was immortal, for one thing. He also happened to be a warlock. And not just any warlock. He happened to be the living spawn of one of the greater demons, one of the princes of hell. There were only three of them, his twin sister, Harriet, as she chose to be called now, and his little brother. He thanked the heavens his father didn’t often mate with humans, because the three of them were pieces of work. John had lived many years, lounged under countless skies, and frankly, he was really fed up with all of it. Nothing excited him anymore. Nothing except war, that is. John Watson put the war in warlock, as his brother once told him. He had fought along with the humans in many wars, dating back since the Crusades, when he was young still and had all the fight left in him. He even went to America as a redcoat to fight against the rebels, for King and Country. He fought World War I, World War II (he hated the Nazis), and he was wounded many times. But he was difficult to kill, and his magic kept getting stronger as he kept getting older. He had fought all over Europe, joined many different armies, but England was his home, so he kept being drawn back over and over to London. After a difficult time in the 14 and 1500s he kept away from Transylvania, where he had a close call with the original Vampire nest. He hid his warlock mark with glamours, and when contact lenses were invented and commercialized in the 1970s, he didn’t even bother with them anymore, preferring the lenses that could really hide him from those who could see through glamours. It was simple and practical, and no one could say John Watson was not a practical man.
“Sherry, be a dear and bring some breakfast for the boys. Alissa is back to work, and Mycroft needed to tend to some matters. If you don’t plan to help, I hope you won’t make things difficult.”
“Not really, no. It reminds me of coming back home and meeting Sherlock, so let’s say it has some sentimental value.”
"Oliver, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm going outside for a smoke since I can't even imagine lighting one up inside this house without a hoard of house elves chasing me away."
“Yes, I figured that when it didn’t let me into the actual dressing room. I guess house rivalries get on fiercely during Quidditch season and the Gryffindor team wouldn’t want me putting firepowder in their pants.”
are good, right Uncle My? And strong, like Daddy. Because Daddy says he is going to lift me up until I’m forty! Can you imagine, Uncle My? When I’m forty Daddy is going to be like a thousand years old and surely
"I saw my parents less and less after the years went by. I was training as a Healer at St.Mungo's when Voldemort took the Ministry. It was a stealth job, as you sure know, but they soon started rounding up Muggle-borns and sending them to trial in front of a committee. I was at St. Mungo's when the Ministry officials came for me, but one of the members of Order of the Phoenix saved me. Remus Lupin sent a Patronus as a warning to me because Minerva McGonagall found out somehow that I was next. I managed to escape with my wand and went into hiding with another healer in training, a muggle-born named Roman Hudson. We were able to pass as muggles, and we hid right here, in London, got menial muggle jobs and hid in plain sight. I wasn't counting on them finding my parents, though."
The stairwell looked terrific, decorated with small fairies, frozen by one of the spells from Mycroft's elf staff, who seemed ecstatic to show their capabilities to their guests. Sherlock was just two steps ahead of him, his robes swishing like his Belstaff usually did, descending the stairs two at a time like the madman he was. John resisted the ingrained need of running after him, remembering that the party was not a case, Sherlock was not in danger, well, at least not the usual kind. He might get a scolding from his mother, brother or sister if they saw him running around the house. He saw a house elf that he didn't recognise but remembered Mycroft said there were three of them in the house.
Anna Lightwood: Shadowhunter, alive on Victorian times. She was special, a crossdresser, preferred to dress like a male and was basically a rebel in Victorian Society. She was a good friend of John's in this story, not in a relationship with him because in my mind Anna is a lesbian, in canon Cassandra has not revealed this fact yet.
