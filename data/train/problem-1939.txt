"I- No, I suppose not," Sherlock says, eying John warily. "You've also been something of a surprise to me," he admits. "What you did last week. Coming with me, helping to get Tristram out. That was- good. Not many would have put themselves in that position."
"You can't trick me like that, Sherlock."
I straightened my back and shifted my shoulders back. The pain decreased as the spines were crushed and settled into place. "Fine," I said firmly, nodding to give him reassurance.
"Your dad couldn't go with him this time," Tristram points out, having decided there's no need to mention the kissing after all. "He had to stay with us."
"I know," John repeated, rocking Sherlock in his arms and finding his lips again. He did, he knew. The desperation. The feeling of being home at last after a journey that had lasted a lifetime.
"Go on then," Janine prompts him, breathless. "What can't I get in the way of?"
Sherlock tossed the box at him and crawled on all fours up the bed - he had to tell Gladstone to stay down - with the lubricant in one hand, straddling John's legs, until he was poised with his face directly in front of John's. John slid his hands up under the pyjama shirt still hanging open around Sherlock's shoulders and caressed his bare skin. He licked his lips, his eyes flickering down to Sherlock's mouth and back up. Sherlock held his gaze, looked into his eyes as long as he could while he slowly closed the gap between their lips. The kiss that followed was so full of longing, desire, and tenderness, the intensity of the emotion (flood of hormones) Sherlock experienced so great, that a painful knot formed in his chest and he couldn't breathe for a moment.
Without breaking eye contact, Sherlock picks up John's hand from where it's resting on the mattress and slides it under his tee. John draws his lower lip in and wets it then tilts his face up in invitation. Sherlock dips in to brush his mouth over John's, just enough so they can share breath. John stretches his lips to steal tiny kisses, but Sherlock moves with him, never allowing their mouths to fully meet.
When Emily's done, they don't go back to Tristram's flat; they go to the Watsons'. Doctor Watson says Tristram's father will come and get him later on. Emily's father has already collected her things from Baker Street while they were at school, and tonight they'll be staying at their own house again. Emily puts up a token pout, but Tristram can tell she's relieved, too.
Emily sighs and says, "Fine." Tristram is glad. He wouldn't have known what to do if she'd walked away. They talk about what they want to do when they get to her house, and before they know it, Doctor Watson is there.
And then all hell broke loose. Seeing their leader thrown to the ground seemed to be the trigger that set off the Blackwood students. With almighty shrieks, they jumped on John, clawing and scratching and trying to dislodge him. And the Baker Street students, of course, weren't about to stand by and let their favourite teacher (Sherlock had no problem admitting it) be attacked.
Emily reappears just then, freshly washed, and climbs onto the field bed. It creaks. She bounces around to make it creak even more, grinning at Tristram and her father. "Can you help us make a tent?"
"Why not? It's perfect!"
"Daddy!" Emily cries happily as her father enters. His cheeks and the tops of his ears are red from the fresh air. She throws herself around him, not even waiting for him to take off his jacket.
"Are you going to live with Sherlock and Tris now?" she presses.
"What did you think of John then?" Sherlock asked Gladstone as he waited for his computer to boot up.
Sherlock did too, so he didn't argue. He put his free arm around John and slung one leg over his, but kept his hips back. He didn't want to startle him or incite that discussion right now. He was enjoying the kissing. John was too, to go by the way he was clutching Sherlock's back, sliding a hand up the back of his neck. Following the line of Sherlock's jaw to his neck, nuzzling and nipping and generally causing mayhem down below.
He turned back but didn't come closer. "Hello, John."
Sherlock grimaced at himself in the mirror and checked his teeth. He wondered if he should have shaved again, but he didn't have time now and- What was he thinking? He wasn't trying to impress John. In fact, he shouldn't even have changed his clothes. That was sending the wrong signal. Not that he wasn't, in fact, quite possibly attracted to John, but he wasn't going to act on it and John wasn't to know, and it did - not - matter.
Oh God, Sherlock groaned internally and wished for something to bang his head against. John just watched him, his eyes crinkled in amusement.
Tristram bites down carefully on the plastic tubing and draws his hand back as steadily as he can. It hurts-it hurts-it hurts! He gasps but manages not to drop the tubing, and then he is free. He did it! It's bleeding, but not too much. He forgot to get a tissue. He presses the back of his arm against his cast instead. "It's out!" he says, loud enough so his father can hear him, he hopes.
"You would have left," Sherlock says shortly.
When they get to the end, there is a picture of a stick figure pulling the brakes on its sledge, so Father does and they slow almost to a standstill. Tristram is grinning and breathless. That was brilliant! His brain is only now starting to catch up. It feels like it's still halfway up the spiral.
"You can have the couch," John says, but his words are slurred and indistinct. His muscle tone is already going slack again.
Sherlock pushed the door open and stepped outside. "Yes, John. How?" He wouldn't have laid even odds on his hands not shaking if he were to hold them up for inspection just then.
"No yodeling," John admonishes with a twinkle in his eye.
"I don't think you should bother him," Tristram tries. "He's working."
Sherlock sat slouched down in his armchair, wearing his lounging outfit of loose t-shirt and blue silk dressing gown. He didn't look up, instead continuing to pluck at his violin aimlessly.
"Well here, at least have some of mine to warm you up. You look chilled through." John slid his drink toward Sherlock.
Tristram takes a look but doesn't understand it either. The only word he halfway recognises is 'präservativ', which must mean preservatives. Probably something to do with the ingredients of whatever's inside. It feels like a single, malleable piece of something. He tosses it onto one of the pillows lying askew near the head of the bed.
"I despise spectacles." Sherlock's mouth twisted into a sour smile. "But it looks like we're going to have to get used to spectacles."
John relaxed a fraction, amusement tinged with something more complex breaking through his receding anxiety. "Could do."
"Look, this isn't-" John sighs. "This isn't why I wanted to talk to you. I actually wanted to know what you found out today. How do things look?"
Tristram's father frowns. "My time will be better spent here."
There was no way to go but forward. I had no thought other than my task, the bowl and its dwindling contents. When it was empty, I would be released, as the omega who had to withstand ten shocks had been. The observers around us were a blur of color and atonal buzzing. I was aware only of Holmes murmuring encouragements as I worked, and once or twice he reached out to touch my shoulder, perhaps to adjust my posture, acknowledge my efforts, or simply remind me of his presence. I did not know nor honestly care. All that mattered was the placement of the next chestnut and keeping my movements as minimal and economic as possible in order not to dislodge any of its fellows.
"Sherlock, this is never going to work," John hissed, distributing deprecating and apologetic smiles as they made their way through the black-tie crowd. They'd waited until the interval, when it would be easiest to approach the mayor.
Sherlock loves watching him like this, when he's all keyed up and spouting confidence — and relief, it must be said — at another more or less successful end to one of their joint ventures. Almost as much as he loves watching John in action, tight control and efficiency battling with the urge to utterly and completely demolish. It is, he imagines, perhaps much the same way John feels watching Sherlock dig devastation out of tie pins and hospital corners. They match, in the same way in which they are complete opposites. Sherlock's heart pumps a bit faster and his blood flows a bit hotter at the thought.
At the same time, John's hands weren't idle, continuing to stroke and stimulate Sherlock's chest, his cock, his neck, his arse, all the while murmuring encouragements with interjections of profanity.
"See?" John said quietly. "That's not what a man without a heart would say."
"You think I'll-" Sherlock echoed incredulously. "No. I refuse. This is insulting and demeaning. I put up with that inane mentoring rot the first year, and we both know how that turned out."
And so while the bright lights and plastic decorations that were beginning to crop up in the windows of the houses on his street didn't overtly interfere with his existence, he nevertheless found himself invariably worked up to a palpable level of aggression by the time he arrived at the door to his brownstone. Which made him doubly gratified to be greeted by an enthusiastic bundle of knee-high, shaggy, gray dog when he went inside.
At the stroke of seven, the red curtains on the stage parted just enough to allow Moriarty, dressed to the nines in a new gray suit (Westwood), to pass through. The crowd surged forward, children shuffling between the adults to get a better view. Moriarty stood in humble posture with his hands clasped in front of him, a self-deprecating smile pasted onto his face. The clamour of conversation lessened to a buzz, and finally to nothing at all. He had obviously trained them well. Finally, when the silence had been stretched to its outer limit, Moriarty threw his arms out and began speaking.
"It would only mean a couple of hours," John interjected, but not without first casting an irritated glance in Sherlock's direction. It was then that Sherlock saw the flaw in his plan. He had depended on John having faith in his assessment of Mycroft's character and the futility of the visit. Presenting an argument in favour of the filming was like exposing a jugular to Mycroft's instinct for blood.
"Oh John," Sherlock said, his expression turning devious. "I have a feeling you're going to be late for work after all."
Over by the window, Doctor Watson almost rips the curtain out of its track as he struggles to slide it closed again. Emily is still pressed against the wall, gulping down sobs.
"Yeah, all right. I wonder what they're going to serve for lunch?"
He just... It's always been him and his father. All of the other major players in their life - Uncle Mycroft, Mrs Hudson, Inspector Lestrade - have remained more or less outside their twin existence. Even Tristram, if he is brutally honest, has never entirely penetrated his father's shell. The fact that Tristram's father is letting Doctor Watson kiss him feels like that door Tristram was standing outside of before is now being slammed in his face.
They walk several blocks away from the hospital before his father flags down a cab for them. Tristram is glad. Just that short walk has tired him and made his bag feel heavier than it is.
John clears his throat like he's about to say something. He doesn't, though, and when Tristram looks at him, he has his eyes firmly on his plate, although his eyebrows are raised so high his whole forehead is wrinkled.
Moriarty giggles. "He did, didn't he? Oh, Sherlock," he says, his face falling comically at Sherlock's suddenly thunderous expression. "Admit it. You were a rather negligent parent."
But Father also said, when he came back from the airport, that it wasn't over yet. Tristram doesn't know whether Emily didn't hear that or didn't understand what it meant. Another secret. He absolutely cannot tell her the one about her father being the hit man's target. That's over now anyway. But he thinks she does need to know about this.
John was waiting, as he said he would be, along with some technicians who were doing the preliminary set-up for lights and sound. He took aside the four boys who were playing the wise men, to work on their choreography, while Sherlock and Molly ran through the staging for Gabriel's song with the rest of the class. The children were very excited about the stage set up in the former apse in front of the skeleton tower and spire, not to mention poking at the cables and other equipment, and it was all the three teachers could do to keep them more or less on task.
"Feel like I'm nineteen again," John said wryly. Sherlock didn't. Nineteen had been rather bad. "Maybe we should get going," John suggested, nodding back toward the main road. The risk of drawing unpleasant attention was unspoken but understood by both. Another very real complication which Sherlock had never cared much about in his younger, more reckless years. And which he preferred not to think about now. Sherlock put his hands in his pockets, too, and together they walked quietly out of the park, maintaining a small gap between them.
There's that Moran again. The one whose killer Father is trying to find. But what does Doctor Watson have to do with it? Why would they want to hurt him? Especially if, as Father said, they're not trying to get Father to do anything or stop investigating. It was something about a right-hand man, but Tristram didn't quite follow that part. No matter, he knows what he needs to do now, even if he's afraid he's about to draw his father's displeasure.
sake? You know what? I know you're upset over what happened, running on your sixth cup of shite coffee of the night, not yourself and all that, but Jesus, you're a piece of work. How about for Sherlock's sake? Has it ever occurred to you that one reason he turns to drugs is because he's trying to regain some control? Because he feels that people don't trust him?"
"Sherlock, the Lord Mayor!" Lestrade said, as if that meant something. "You don't say no to the Lord Mayor."
"And that's today?" John asked, surprised and pleased at the coincidence. It didn't really mean anything, of course, but it was somehow comforting to know that he and Sherlock were part of the seasons now.
John slid over, bumping Sherlock with his shoulder. Not moving away, letting his arm rest against Sherlock's. Sherlock didn't move away either. An increased pressure along the seam of contact. Tentative but not unwelcome. Quite the opposite, in fact.
Return the chicken back to the pan. Add the ginger lemon grass sauce (if too thick add a touch of water) mix well, and cook for two minutes.
"So you want to play with paper?" he asked in a dangerous tone. He was speaking to the class as a whole, but he kept his focus on John. "Fine. Your task this morning is to create seasonal decorations out of paper, without using adhesives or scissors. Folding only. I want to see recognisable shapes and sharp lines. Extra points for creativity. And, after you have made at least one decoration and had it approved by either myself or Mr Watson, those who want to may make
"A mere formality, as I said." He reached for his hat and held the door open whilst I gathered my own hat and cane.
The other adults fall silent. Emily rolls her eyes and Tristram tenses up; now they're going to be caught. Father's told him time and again not to eavesdrop. It's not any better that Emily was the one who suggested it.
"What do they usually say then?"
As if Father's heard Tristram's thoughts - he probably has, somehow - he explains, "You're exhausted, and we have over an hour still to go. Lie down." He raises his arm to give Tristram room. Tristram is tired, it's true. Father's never offered to let him lie down on his lap before, though. At least not that Tristram can recall. Maybe he did when Tristram was very little. He's acting now as if it's nothing unusual, anyway.
John watched his hand where it rested against the off-white material of Sherlock's shirt, which matched his own. 'Bone' was the actual shade, according to Sherlock's tailor. Their suits were 'ash'. John had half-expected him to suggest blood-red ties as their accent colour, but Sherlock had leapt in with the blue, so at least they didn't look entirely like a crime scene.
Here was an alpha man locked in the stocks, his trousers pulled halfway down to accommodate an omega woman - armed with a broad wooden paddle - in maltreating his bared bottom. There a female omega wearing nothing but a thin white shift, her arms held up by ropes suspended from a hook in the ceiling, being beaten by an alpha female wielding a tentacled flogger. And just over the shoulder of another gentleman, I caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a woman - I could not discern whether alpha or omega - draped across a lap and being spanked quite thoroughly with the switch I had heard before.
"Give it a few days."
"Maybe they're waiting for us to finish and go in," Emily suggests.
Sherlock was also, through everything, unable to completely keep John Watson out of his head. It wasn't bad, necessarily. It wasn't as if he couldn't concentrate when he wanted to, but there was always a presence hovering at the edge of things: what would John's face look like when he heard Sherlock play this? Would he try and talk Sherlock out of picking this lock (or would he stand lookout)? Would he be impressed at how quickly Sherlock figured out the passwords? Sherlock found there were things he wanted to share, sights he wanted to point out, theories he wanted to discuss, or at least have a sounding board for. And maybe he also wanted to feel that hand on his back again, or have that strong, capable body - far from a wreck - walking beside him, or listen to that warm tenor voice telling a story, teasing him, laughing.
"There's nothing wrong with it, John. Unless you think there is?" Sherlock turned to look at him. He knew John was comfortable with his sexuality - with the two of them being together - when they were alone, but now Sherlock recalled the way he'd immediately stepped away and wiped his mouth when Lestrade walked in on them and the careful space he'd maintained between them walking out of the park. Sherlock was fairly certain it was due to wanting to avoid trouble rather than any suppressed shame, however. And John's response seemed to confirm that.
"Do you want to do anything?" John asks carefully. "One way or the other?"
"You're not really in a position," Lestrade said mildly. "Look, I don't know, think of it as you mentoring him."
John left the buttons to Sherlock and reached down between them. His hand grasped Sherlock's cock through his pants and stroked him while he nudged under Sherlock's jaw to kiss and suck there, working his way back up to Sherlock's lips.
When John and Molly herded the children over to the street side of the square to meet the parents, Sherlock hung back in a dark corner by the stage. He should really leave. There was no reason to stay. John had said 'just for the play'. He couldn't have made it any clearer.
John waited for the natural follow-up, but when Sherlock didn't deliver, he turned his attention somewhat awkwardly to Gladstone. "Who's this fellow then?" He bent down to offer his hand for the dog to sniff. "Is he yours?"
"The game has almost entirely failed to comply," Sherlock said dryly. John giggled. Giggled! Sherlock's face expanded into a reflexive smile in return. Their eyes caught and held. Something settled warmly into Sherlock's stomach, fluttered hopefully behind his ribcage. John's gaze deepened. Maybe not so tentative and fragile. Maybe things were even stronger and more solid than before. A new direction. Or not so new. The same direction. A kilometre further on. A turning into the woods.
"Who?" John looked out at the group of some twenty children, now arranging themselves in the school yard in what looked like some sort of military formation. "Hold on, is that-"
"You- you didn't. Did you?" John asked tentatively. "I mean, admittedly my current place isn't exactly Mayfair... All right, let me see the list. Or have you already picked one out?" John sounded amused.
Emily turns around and waves at him. "Bye, Tris."
Tristram knows he's supposed to say he doesn't mind it, either. He's supposed to say it doesn't make him uncomfortable when he sees his father touching Doctor Watson, or kissing him. He's supposed to say he's happy that they're friends. He is, too, looked at objectively, but at the same time there are lots of other feelings mixed up with the logical happiness that kind of drown it out. He has to say something, though, so he tells Doctor Watson the same thing he told his father that night in the taxi after their last visit to the Watsons': "It's fine."
"Yes, you are to take it," John says testily. He takes his phone out and jabs at it. He waits for it to connect, but it jumps right to voice mail. "Answer your phone, you fucking arse!" he yells and ends the call.
Sherlock turned halfway, still intending to continue on his way (flee). "I don't really have time, John."
John turns partially toward Sherlock. His shoulder makes contact with Sherlock's chest and his frown quickly gives way to a half grin. "You mean you haven't pissed any of them off yet."
Then Doctor Watson stares hard at Father and finishes in a harsh whisper, "It could have been much worse. Do you even get that?"
"Just say we have a case."
Sherlock slowly relaxes his hold on John. John lets him go. "Sherlock?" he asks uncertainly when Sherlock sits up and crawls over John to get out of bed.
"Sherlock!" John scolded. "No," he said to Saffron, more gently. "No, I don't think they are."
Slice the whole chicken breast quite thinly width wise.
"It doesn't," Emily pipes up. "You're happy when you're with Sherlock. I like it when you laugh."
"I'm talking about what you did tonight, which was unacceptable."
She looks a little surprised. She turns to Doctor Watson. "Are you not the father?" she asks him.
"Good."
"Wasn't planning on it."
Happy, happy, happy.
John retracted his hand and sat back. "Sorry."
Sherlock's reponse was to insert his tongue between her lips without preamble and seek out all the places John had been. It wasn't a kiss. It was more like a thorough cleansing, making sure that he'd found every trace and secured them. God, but he had it bad. She hadn't been entirely certain until this moment.
Tristram glances at Emily. She's wiping her finger through the last of the jammy bean sauce on her plate and doesn't seem to have noticed anything.
Mycroft's assistant took John's request for fizzy drinks for the children and a cup of tea for himself. Sherlock waved her off. He wasn't planning on staying long enough to take tea. Although giving the children something sticky and spillable was perhaps not such a bad idea.
"What the hell are you playing at!" Doctor Watson growls. He sounds genuinely angry. Tristram's stomach twists unpleasantly. He puts down his fork.
"I intend visiting the British Museum later on," I said, watching my friend carefully for any sign of his intentions. "I want to compare some of my sketches of Tibetan mummies with the new Egyptian ones they have on display." I berated myself instantly at Watson's slight flinch. The reference to my three-year sojourn was oblique, to be sure, but I should have been more circumspect. It was still a sore point, and one that went unaddressed for many reasons.
"I've not seen the play, I don't know what's going to happen in a few minutes. But I do know that each and every one of these children is amazing and I'm proud of them and of everyone who came together to make this possible tonight."
"Father!" he cries happily.
"God, I really don't like this."
It might all sound rather dull compared to my London years, but I had diversions enough to keep me occupied, even more so than in my youth, when I used to languish for days complaining of a lack of distractions from my own thoughts. I was not lonely. I had my bees and Mrs Waites, who came to clean twice a week and stopped by daily on top of that, on her way to and from the market. Then there was the postmaster, who was always good for a story or two; Tom Fletcher and his wife, my neighbours down the lane, amiable and generous in the way of country folk and eager to keep me well supplied with blackberry preserves and cordials. (They seem to have had a standing exchange of farm products with the previous owner, which I was only too happy to maintain.) And various other denizens of the town and countryside who brought their little problems for me to solve, my reputation having somehow curiously found its way to this remote corner of the country.
"No, we won't," a little voice said from somewhere behind Sherlock.
"He prefers sleeping on the couch," Tristram tells him.
Tristram and Emily share a gleeful smile.
This went on for a week or two, with sporadic success and Sherlock growing increasingly frustrated - and running out of spurious information to feed John - when the sound of John's feet once again clumping up the stairs had Sherlock reaching for the little glass vial in his pocket. It had been someone's engagement party - one of the minor badges from NSY, Sherlock had been invited as well but honestly, who were they kidding. John paused in the doorway, cheeks and nose showing the three beers and four (really, John?) shots, and if Sherlock didn't know better, he'd have said that was a rather soppy look being aimed in his direction, but it was obviously just the alcohol. John's face broke into a somewhat sheepish smile that he seemed to be having some trouble hiding, but he just sighed, hung his jacket on the hook by the door, and headed for the bathroom.
"Tris is still with Irene, Em," John tells her gently.
"Can Emily come too?" It slips out of him unexpectedly, before he's really thought it through. He realises too late that Irene might not want Emily there - even though she did say she liked her, and that she wanted to be friends.
"I shot a man to save your life! That had nothing to do with any plans any more. That wasn't about a preemptive strike, or revenge for Mary. It was to protect you, nothing else."
"Can we do that with mine too?" Emily pleads.

"Sherlock," John hissed, jerking his head in the direction of Mr Holmes' retreating figure.
"Some coincidence," John remarks.
"Because," he said, leaning forward to brace himself on both arms, which caused the long muscles in his arms to stretch and flex in a way which shouldn't be enticing at all, given his incredibly poor bedside manner, "I'm going to bring you to climax using only my tongue while I lick up every trace of John's semen, and then I'm going to enter you from behind and fuck you until I come, and if you're very cooperative, there might even be another orgasm in it for you."
"Stay back," Doctor Watson says, still sharp. Then he turns to Mrs Hudson. "I'm sorry, would you mind taking them-"
John wasn't stupid. Nor was he unobservant. He hadn't lived and worked with Sherlock Holmes without picking up a few of his methods. He knew Sherlock was coming in here. Obviously, he still kept all of his clothes in here. His disguises and notebooks. His collection of tobacco ash samples. It wasn't that though. Sherlock was coming in here and lying in this bed. He could smell Sherlock's aftershave on the pillowcase. What he didn't know was whether Sherlock was doing it with an ulterior motive. To test John for some reason. Or whether he'd simply wanted to have a few hours of good sleep on a real mattress after so many weeks on the couch. (The mattress was actually too soft for John's liking, didn't support his lower back properly. It was probably moulded to Sherlock's body at this point.) Sherlock could have washed the sheets if he'd wanted to erase any trace of his presence. Although John supposed it would have been even more suspicious to find all the bedding changed.
'It'. This thing between them. By unspoken mutual agreement. They could talk about Sherlock forcing John to watch him jump off a roof. They could talk about John's wife shooting Sherlock in the heart. They could talk about John losing control and beating Sherlock up. They could talk about Sherlock's drug use. But the one thing they couldn't say, that wasn't allowed, was the fact that they loved each other. More than life, more than death. More than anyone or anything. Including, quite likely, his daughter. Although he didn't want to examine that one too closely because it was frankly terrifying.
Emily's started to cry.
"No idea."
"Sweetie, you're going to have to," she says, still kindly, but firmly. "Your dad will meet you at the hospital. We have to get you fixed up, and we can't wait for him."
John barks out a huff of dry laughter. "Oh my God, you self-involved prick! And what was all that with the teeth and the eyes then?"
"Merry Christmas," Sherlock said.
"Very well, if you insist," Sherlock sighed in his most put-upon voice. "Dear brother Mycroft, please will you make a movie out of our Nativity," Sherlock sing-songed. Then he modulated his pitch to mimic Mycroft's more nasal tone: "So sorry, can't spare the time, perhaps next year."
Sitting there watching John - relaxed and purposeful, the skin around his eyes betraying his still restless nights, clasping his firm, capable hand around the cup of coffee Sherlock had brought him, smiling briefly at Sherlock in reaction to something Molly said (he smiled back, not even knowing why) - Sherlock felt a brief, profound peace. It didn't last longer than a few seconds before Sally Donovan came in, speaking in that strident manner Sherlock found so grating, but it was long enough for Sherlock to capture a snapshot of the moment and entrust it to his most secure vault. It wasn't a memory for framing and putting on display; it was one to be tucked carefully between the leaves of an old-fashioned album with an embossed leather cover, and taken out only in quiet moments when he could immerse himself in the emotions it elicited - even if he wasn't sure yet what they were.
"No, okay then. So, what, are you- Jesus, this is hard." John rubs a hand down his face. "Have you ever been attracted to a man before?"
John knew what he hoped Sherlock would pick, but he was also pretty sure what Sherlock wanted, and that was to make things more difficult for himself. He never took the easy way. Never took the low-hanging fruit. And so it was.
Tristram tries to describe the two different kinds of light he saw, and everything else he can recall about the figure. While he's speaking, Father is already typing something into his phone.
John follows the pattern Sherlock started, kneading and stroking in an almost hypnotic rhythm while he runs his other hand slowly over Sherlock's chest and arms. Sherlock's hand has slipped down onto John's knee, which he grips tightly. When Sherlock's body starts to tense up and his breaths become more intense, John leans forward and puts his face against Sherlock's, nudging and kissing until Sherlock surfaces from his internal retreat with a sharp intake of breath and responds with kisses that rapidly become passionate. He tilts his hips toward John, trying to get closer, and grasps John's hips, his back, whatever he can blindly reach. Then, as if suddenly remembering that John is sitting next to him completely exposed, he reaches down and takes him in hand again. It's an awkward angle, though, and he doesn't have much range of motion.
"Nice view," John mentions, glancing out the window at the glittering lights of nighttime London.
Sherlock was no help, merely looking bored by the interaction, impatient to be on his way. John shook hands and wished the band a happy Christmas, feeling slightly discombobulated. As if things were moving too fast, spiralling out of control, and yet if anything, it was only an incremental shift. A change in perspective, an acceptance of the way things really were. An acknowledgment of the status quo, but at the same time an opening of an entirely new frontier, uncharted territory. The family. Their family.
"I did warn you-"
The difference is, John isn't going to throw the food away just to spite Irene.
"Undoubtedly," he agreed and buttoned up his coat the rest of the way. "I'm headed that way, easier to get a taxi-" He nodded toward the side of the square he'd arrived on.
John lets the grin break through. "That's what I thought too. But don't you wonder? Don't you think it might be important? It's a rather massive coincidence that she's here just when we are. And don't tell me Mycroft arranged it."
Finally, Doctor Watson nods. "All right." Everyone lets out their breath. He jerks his head toward Emily. "Come on."
"Nothing gets past you."
Jesus, Greg thought. Think of the kids. He raised his eyebrows and exchanged a look with Wyzoczky. It looked like she was trying valiantly not to laugh. Greg schooled his expression into a frown and asked her pointedly about the fingerprints.
Well, he can breathe better, but he knows he messed up. He shouldn't have pushed Emily. He hurt her.
Holmes closed his eyes, the line between his brows betraying the difficulty that statement posed for him. When he finally opened his eyes again and spoke, it was with a voice that was rough with emotion. "Watson, that you will let me do this for you."
John appears to hesitate over his answer, then comes back and sits on the coffee table next to the couch. He takes a deep breath and folds his hands across his knees. He opens his mouth to say something but stops, and finally comes out with, "I don't know." He gives Emily an apologetic look. "It's not... Sherlock and I haven't talked about it. Everything's just sort of happened so fast, you know? Right now, Sherlock needs us to be here. When Tris is back, though... it's not really practical, is it? We can't have the two of you in that little room upstairs on a permanent basis, and there's no other space. And anyway, I don't know if that's even something Sherlock and Tris would want. What about you? How do you feel about it?"
"You wear it well," he said finally, his voice low. He lifted his eyes from the leather band to my face and smoothed his hands down my shoulders. I was taken aback at the fierce pride mixed with tenderness I saw in him then.
John tilts his head tightly in Tristram's direction, raising his eyebrows at Irene in a gesture that's both challenge and query.
"Come on, I'll show you how to play Mario Kart," she says enthusiastically.
"You have no idea what you've done, do you?" Sherlock could feel the nervous energy building in him. He needed something, his bones were getting too big for his skin. There was a pile of folders near his hand, worksheets waiting to be marked. He swept them off the desk, causing them to scatter satisfyingly all over the floor, then whipped around. Part of it was a genuine release, part of it calculated to impress on John how deeply he had hurt and disappointed Sherlock.
"Possibly. They may be lying to cover themselves."
Sherlock had to admire John for the attempt. He actually believed that Sherlock had a sense of honour to appeal to. It was almost enough to move Sherlock to action, purely in order not to disappoint him. However, the main problem was: "He won't do it."
"She's an idiot."
Behind him, Tristram's father comes in, his keen eyes seeking out Tristram but not saying anything. There is also colour in his cheeks; more, Tristram thinks, than is explicable by the weather. Maybe he and Doctor Watson had words again. Tristram stands where he is uncertainly.
"Yes, you did," Grandmother says with an amused tilt to her mouth. "You were curious. Of course. We would have met at lunch anyway. Speaking of which ... It's probably time to head back, wouldn't you say?"
"Okay, then how about me and my dad can use the bedroom tonight, and tomorrow you and your dad can have it. Is that okay, Dad?" she asks him. "That way it's fair."
John shifted the dildo back and forth, just a couple of centimetres at a time, slowly in and out, not enough to really count as fucking. The vibration transferred to his hand, and he imagined how it felt to Sherlock, sliding repeatedly over his oversensitised entrance, especially after it had been inside him so long. It had now been half an hour since he'd turned it on. John always kept strict track. They'd started out earlier with the blindfold, gag, and cock cage; sensory deprivation sometimes helped to shift Sherlock's gears down, but tonight, it had only forced Sherlock further inside, further into the vortex of his whirling thoughts and self-recriminations, and so John was trying to overwhelm him with the other extreme instead. It seemed to be working so far, keeping Sherlock's focus on his own body and its sensations, drawing out the chase of the elusive climax, which they both knew he would ultimately succeed at. Unlike the hunt for the young woman who had disappeared earlier that week.
"Make the best use of your skills," Sherlock corrects him back.
It wasn't long, however, before we both found ourselves frustrated and ill at ease. That "running around" had a tendency to whip up my blood and excite my temper, delivering me back to my homestead in a state which my dear first wife, Mary, had found pleasantly invigorating and eminently compatible with her omega biology.
Sherlock saw that he never meant to make contact; his body was pulling back practically as soon as he began to move. But John had already reacted, using Moriarty's momentum against him to deflect him to one side, then kicking his feet out from under him. He had Moriarty face-down on the ground with a knee in his kidneys and his arm pulled awkwardly up behind his back before Sherlock could draw a breath to shout a warning.
"What are you talking about? Wait, I just need to pay the cab," he says as he walks ahead.
John was working both fingers deeper inside Sherlock now, and Sherlock wondered briefly why, if he wasn't going to fuck him, and then there was a flash of intense pleasure, almost too sharp. Sherlock's back arched off the bed. John pulled his fingers back, but not out.
"Close enough. Close enough for the message to get across, anyway."
Sherlock turned his head slowly to meet John's eye. "John. I bought - Gladstone - a dog bed. I'm training him not to sleep on the bed anymore. In the bedroom at all, actually. I've put him out in the hallway."
John must have felt much the same, as he said with a note of desperation, "Can you go get it... please..." as he ground his own erection against Sherlock's thigh. "Or we could just... like this, I don't-" He delved into Sherlock's mouth again and increased the pressure of his strokes on Sherlock's cock.
"What? No," he says, as if that's the most ridiculous thing he's ever heard. "I needed to trump their diversion. You see, someone was planning to -"
"But you know what I figured out fairly quickly was, Gents was like that because he didn't care. I mean, yes, he cared about saving patients, but he didn't have any emotional investment. If they died, or were sent home crippled or paralysed or blind, that was just the way things worked out. So while the rest of us would go out and get drunk off our rocks, or pick fights to burn off some of that anger and desperation we'd picked up, Gents would be working another shift to cover our sorry arses when we turned up hung over or with our knuckles too swollen to operate."
"Hey, Tris," John calls out, interrupting them. He comes out of the bedroom, looking a bit red in the face. "Do you know where your passport is?"
"Sherlock, he's having a panic attack," Tristram hears Doctor Watson say, but his voice sounds strange, as if he's speaking from far away. "Emily, come sit down here."
"Anything else I can do?" John asks.
"I wasn't-" But John cut himself off, sighing. "Yeah, you're right. It's my problem, not yours." He straightened up and slapped his hand on his leg. "So, that's my piece said. Sort of the tip of the Watson iceberg, if you will," he finished with a lopsided smile.
Doctor Watson snaps his mobile out of his pocket and flicks it open. "One bar, but maybe it'll be better outside."
skills, Doctor Watson. Whatever are you thinking? Oh look, Sherlock, he blushes," she coos. John's eyes snap to her. There's something dangerous there, but Irene just titters.
Watson was directing the children to move their desks aside, and that was where Sherlock drew the line.
John's first reaction is utter bafflement and a fair amount of sheepishness. Did they have a case? Had Sherlock said something and John was too wrapped up in his own wallowing to hear him?
But then Sherlock drew John's hand down off his shoulder onto his chest. His breaths ragged now too. Under his ribs, John could feel Sherlock's heart pounding. Racing. Calling. Answering. Sherlock's grip was like steel and gossamer. Determined and fragile. John splayed his hand beneath Sherlock's, felt the heat of his blood, the reality of his flesh. A long moment on the precipice. Then words tumbled out as they spoke over each other:
"Greg was already reaching for the phone when I left his office," John said. "Look, you have to understand, I only wanted to ask who Mycroft was. I heard the last bit of your conversation, and I was- I know it was wrong of me. I couldn't really help overhearing, but I should have asked you rather than going behind your back. I'm sorry about that, and I wanted to ask, it's just- I'm aware of my position here. I know you don't want me here, that you see my presence as an intrusion. God, really, you made it all up?" he asked abruptly, as if he still couldn't believe it.
"John, it's all right, you don't need to-" Sherlock tried to interrupt before both of them became even more uncomfortable. It really was fine. Sherlock didn't care one whit about what or whom John had done in the past. He certainly had his own share of ill-thought incidents that he'd undo if he could.
"You did not just say that."
Father doesn't answer for a pretty long time. Tristram thinks he's not going to at all when he hears the faint "Yes."
Knead dough until smooth but not elastic, dusting with flour if it becomes too sticky, 4 minutes. Do not overwork dough.
"You too!" She darts over to him and squeezes him with her puffy arms, and then she and her father are gone.
"Oh, portents and shofarim are beyond year threes, but they have no problem with religious metaphor."
Top and tail, and string the snowpeas. Cut snow peas in half lengthwise and on an angle (like two long triangles). Grate the carrot.
Swiss German, by the way, is actually a language unto itself. It has a different grammar and vocabulary from the standard German (called High German) you might learn in school. It has several dialects that are more or less mutually intelligible, but someone from Germany would have difficulty understanding any of them. Due to the varied dialect situation, generally only High German is used in writing, which Swiss German speakers must learn in school like a foreign language. I don't even get into that in this story, though, just assuming that any Swiss will identify Sherlock as a foreigner on sight and speak to him in High German.
John was acting as if this were a deadly serious business, all the while coming up with sillier and sillier things for the children to do. Sherlock found himself unable to stop himself from chuckling and nodding his head in time with the music.
"John." The word is reproach and plea all at once.
John looks up at Sherlock, trying to gauge whether he's arsing him or not. "Yeah, that's-" He takes in Sherlock's expression, and laughter bubbles up out of his throat. "Yes, it's normal, Christ, we're both completely normal." He smiles and presses one more kiss to Sherlock's lips.
Sherlock's hand tightens around his mobile, but he still doesn't say anything or look at John. When the song ends and a new one starts, though, he reaches out and stabs the off button.
Tristram replies automatically, watching as Doctor Watson disappears into the bathroom and Emily finally goes back to the bedroom to wait for him. Tristram closes his eyes and waits too. He doesn't want to chance being overheard. After a couple of minutes, Tristram hears the sounds of Doctor Watson going into the bedroom, followed by his and Emily's voices. Although Doctor Watson left the door open, their voices are low and indistinct enough that he can't make out what they're saying. That's good, because it means that they probably won't be able to understand what he and Father are saying either. There are things he needs to know, but he can't ask them in front of Emily and he doesn't want to in front of Doctor Watson. Even though Doctor Watson probably - certainly - knows more than Tristram, and would be able to answer Tristram's questions himself.
"Is everything all right?" she asks.
He didn't know when he'd started doing that. Casual touches. Sometime after Rosie was born. After Mary had died. But he couldn't for the life of him say whether it was before or after he'd moved back in. Maybe it had something to do with having become accustomed to being in physical contact with another person, carrying the baby for hours in the kangaroo pack, keeping a hand behind her floppy head. Feeling the weight of her on his shoulder, holding her in the crook of his arm as he read and she slept or listened attentively to his voice. Communicating by touch. Stroking her head or back to soothe her, tickling her tummy to make her laugh. He'd noticed that his arms felt empty when he put her down. Maybe that's when he'd started reaching for Sherlock. He didn't think he meant anything by it. Not conciously. Maybe it meant more that it was unconscious. He let his hand drop back down to the mattress.
"Now this I have to hear," John said with a grin.
He gives it a bit of thought.
*****
No, the longing was deeper and more problematic than that. It was for the ephemeral twosomeness he'd always been excluded from, or at most, stood on the edge of, sneering at it with the self-righteousness of a tourist belittling native customs he didn't understand. He had vehemently never wanted to have any part of it, had based his entire self-image and existence on the supremacy and superiority of his individuality and separateness. The idea of forming a connection with another human being that went beyond the practical or, occasionally, the curiosity-quenching, was anathema. And so the fact that he now found himself wanting to share part of himself - to share large parts of his life, in blatant terms - was not a notion that sat comfortably with him. Not least because the success of such a venture was not something he had much control over. It depended almost entirely on the man beside him, a man he'd already disappointed and hurt, even if unintentionally.
"It doesn't matter anyway. Like I said, if he just wants to be friends, I'm fine with that. Honoured, in fact. I have the feeling most people don't appreciate him."
Emily beams. "Yellow Submarine."
But their plans have nothing to do with kissing, so Tristram asks Emily, "What?"
Sender: Wiggins
"Daddy!" Emily protests, but she's fighting a smile too.
"You know how these things are," Sherlock said, affecting a tone of chummy confidentiality. "Last minute pick-ups for another project. They've sworn they absolutely will make every effort to be there on the night, but that's not what it's about, is it? It's about civic pride, showcasing the future of this city, and putting on a roaring good show!" Sherlock winked broadly at the leather-skinned women and their improbable bust lines. They in turn nodded and gazed expectantly back at the mayor.
"Then we'll set them up on boxes or platforms. We can use the same ones later to build the staircase for the stars. Yes!" John's face lit up. "Look, like this. Come here." John got up onto the stage and held his hand down to Sherlock.
Sherlock's forehead creases ever so slightly, but he doesn't answer.
much looking forward to seeing what you come up with. You and
"Won't happen again." John's voice was clipped and flat.
"Behind me," Tristram tells him. "Up by the shops. He has a gun."
Irene slides gracefully off the table, turning casually toward Moriarty. What looks like a move to adjust her bosom inside her dress turns out to be something else altogether as she ends up with a small pistol gripped in both her hands. It is aimed, quite professionally, at the man behind the desk. She disengages the safety and adjusts her stance so her feet are a bit further apart.
All of a sudden, John realised: "Is that what... the knife. That was because of today."
"Mycroft's coming tomorrow, I'm entitled," Sherlock muttered.
Doctor Watson tosses the pillows onto the bed, not paying attention to where they land. Tristram's thumps down onto his feet, but Emily's bounces off onto the floor. She quietly leans over the side of the bed to pick it up.
John was already there, discussing something with the technicians. He acknowledged Sherlock with a glance and a nod, but didn't come over. Sherlock presumed they were working out the details of the lighting for Mary and Joseph's song, which they were supposed to be running through that afternoon. The switching of the spotlight from one couple to the next had to be timed perfectly with the song. Sherlock took the opportunity to go to the keyboard where John had left the score and switch out the old version of the play's final song with the one he'd written up last night. It really hadn't taken many adjustments. He'd been done with it in half an hour.
Mycroft had thought at the time that John's insistence on privacy was little more than alpha posturing, but now he considered, given recent developments, that there may have been a more prudish reasoning behind it. He hadn't expected it at this late date; they'd lived together for two years previously without anything coming of their blatant if unaddressed affection for each other. But now... perhaps Mycroft should be grateful for John Watson's puritanical upbringing.
An attempt at humour, judging by the facial and vocal cues, but Sherlock was, as usual, at sea. It must be another one of those cultural references Sherlock had never bothered to pick up, or if he had, he'd deleted it as unimportant.
"Just a few small ones," Mrs Hudson says with a faint smile. "Your Emily was down for a while. Such a lovely girl."
John's face folds into an impossible number of creases as he lifts his eyes again. They're not empty, but this is almost worse. "No," John says, his voice almost strangled. "No, God no, it's not you. I'm sorry. It's-" He leans back and pushes his drink away. "I can't. I'm not ready to talk about it."
Fresh ginger (approx half inch piece)
Mr Holmes leaned on his elbow toward John and explained, "She said he'd never have agreed to come so readily if he didn't have some business up this way."
"But bringing them here--"
"Was Scott actually a name from your family?" Mary asks suddenly. The words come out too quickly. She's been saving them up, not sure she wants to hear the answer but unable to hold them back any longer. "A maiden name somewhere? Because he told me it was his grandmother's, but that's not true. I did some research. One of his grandmothers was a Brown and the other was a Mitchell. I even went back to his great-grandparents. Not a Scott among them."
"Someone dropped an eyeball in it," Sherlock points out.
While he was down there, Sherlock took the opportunity to thoroughly acquaint himself with John's cock. It was just a pity there wasn't more light. Still, the lack of visual input only served to heighten the sensitivity of his other senses, and he felt confident, after exploring the smooth, bulbous head, thick, left-leaning shaft, and tight, heavy bollocks with his tongue, lips, and hands that he'd be able to pick them out of any line-up. When a tangy, bitter fluid began to well out of the slit, Sherlock committed that taste to memory as well.
referring to your wedding. Do not presume to lecture me on familial duty, John Watson." He looked down his nose at John, his mouth downturned in disparagement. Then without another word, he turned and walked away, the sound of his polished soles echoing crisply in the tiled corridor.
Doctor Watson looks like he's not quite convinced, but he doesn't press the issue. "Are either of you still hungry? Maybe want to try and find a burger or something?"
As they kissed, Sherlock pressed closer and John pulled him in, until they were reclined against the angle of the sofa with Sherlock stretched awkwardly across him. Sherlock still had his suit jacket on, which annoyingly restricted his range of motion just when he had John spread out underneath him to sample at will. He left off from John's mouth for a moment to push himself up and struggle his way one-armed out of the jacket, John trying to help and then dislodging Sherlock even further so he could take off his own jacket.
He stepped back, straightening his waistcoat and craning his neck as if to test the feel of the leather circlet. "I'm afraid it is a requirement of the club that every alpha guest be accompanied by an omega and vice versa. And forgive me, Watson, but even with the assistance of the most potent chemicals, it would be quite obvious to even the most unobservant stooge that you are an alpha."
Afterwards, with John breathing quietly beside him (it turned out he dropped off immediately after sex regardless of the amount of alcohol in his body), Sherlock caught a glimpse of the moon out his window. It was the barest waning crescent.
John doesn't appear to notice it. Instead, he seems to be pre-occupied with something of his own, as he looks a bit self-conscious. "Here, I erm... got you all something." He lifts his hips up so he can dig something out of the pocket of his trousers. He comes up with some key chains. They all have a plastic square attached with some sort of picture enclosed in the plastic. John hands one key chain to each of them - one for Emily, one for Tristram, and one for Father.
"John..." Sherlock said, not even sure why; his name simply felt good and right on his tongue, and if he maybe meant more than just gaining his attention, well, no one was the wiser.
"Yes, well, there was some concern, you know, about giving him the position: no previous experience, bit of a dodgy profile. But that's all water under the bridge now," Mrs Hudson said in satisfaction.
"Anyway, I've already told you the beginning," Tristram adds. "And the part with the Death Eaters, and you said yourself it was less scary than the other books."
"Sherlock, you're the best man at his wedding. I think that's pretty much a textbook definition of friends."
Sherlock took the phone and copied the number into his own.
"You could still-"
Tristram is huddled on the couch under Mrs Hudson's afghan, which somehow has found its way to the safe house along with the rest of his things from the hospital. Doctor Watson has gone to the kitchen to help Emily with breakfast. It must be morning. It's impossible to tell from the windows, as they are all shuttered and have heavy curtains drawn over them. It's the best feature of the house, in Tristram's opinion.
"Why would someone on their way back from a pub crawl stop right under Tristram's window for a smoke?" Sherlock holds the baggie out to John.
And then they were off. On foot, as everything was apparently 'just down the lane' and it would be 'silly', according to Daisy, to take two cars. Sherlock suspected she just wanted a chance to pump him for information on Lestrade, as she proceeded to do just that, playing the frail old lady card to hold onto his elbow as they strolled into the village. Sherlock rolled his eyes but let her after a sharp glance from John.
It was an opening - a blatant, gaping opening - but Sherlock wasn't going to rush in too fast this time. Still, if he played it right...
. Sherlock kicked the drawer shut. It was just the two of them now. As it should be. John had said yes.
"Someone you'd seen before?"
"I'd say I told you so..."
"I don't believe that for one second." The immediacy of John's answer struck a chord in Sherlock, almost making him doubt himself. Because John was clearly talking about Sherlock, not Mycroft. He was wrong, though: Sherlock couldn't have a heart, he couldn't let himself be drawn in, to care about someone else, to count on someone else.
Normally, when someone talks to Father the way Grandmother just has, you can be sure they will be in for a devastatingly thorough enumeration of their faults, weaknesses, and unhappy secrets. In fact, Tristram has heard Father give Grandmother a dressing-down before, and he expects another one now. He can even see Father's eyes flashing dangerously in Grandmother's direction. But before he can open his mouth to begin speaking, Doctor Watson does.
He leaned against the table, his arms folded. "No. I mean, we..." He exhaled heavily. "He invited me over. We had dinner, but it ... I don't think he's interested. Like that. Which is fine."
And so he asked, 'What about John and Emily?'
Tristram knows - because Uncle Mycroft told him once - that his mother named him Harbinger as a way of getting back at his father because Father had said a baby was a harbinger of all the things he didn't want. Like being part of the rat race and picket fences and minivans. Tristram's not sure about the fences and minivans, but the rat race sounds kind of interesting. Still, Father apparently has negative associations with all of them, and that made Tristram think that a harbinger was always something bad. But here it says that the cuckoo is a harbinger of something good. At least he thinks so. People like springtime, don't they? Tristram likes the thought that he might also have brought good things to his father's life. He's pretty sure they've avoided the rats and pickets so far. He reads on:
"It's not... What you said the other night." Sherlock squeezes his gloves with both hands. "It's not casual for me, either. In fact, I may..." Sherlock takes a deep breath. "I may, quite without noticing, have become involved."
And then there were the things that Sherlock would never say, not to Lestrade, not to anyone. The things he stirred up in Sherlock, the fact that Sherlock actually wanted to see him again. The fact that he couldn't predict what he himself would do if given more access to Watson. No, Sherlock had no doubt what his next move would be: he would speak to Lestrade after school. Sherlock would agree to put in a minimal effort toward the play and present the facts regarding Watson in a clear and logical manner. Lestrade wouldn't have any choice but to capitulate.
"Anticipation of what?" Sherlock scowled. "You've been having sex for eighteen months already. If you count that tryst in the morgue during the case with all the dismembered nuns, even though it only involved --"
"Oh yeah, I'll walk with you, bus stop's over there too."
"Let's think of it as a challenge then, shall we? Lie down." He nodded at the bed.
"Just look at it. He's done that..." Sherlock swirled his fingers around near his own head. "Spiky thing."
"I love you."
Sherlock should want to shake it off, pull his arm away, but there was that unspeakable connection again, that feeling of rightness. He was so unsettled by it that he didn't move.
"You don't know me, John. Don't pretend you do just because we've had a cosy family dinner and I'm letting you help me with this."
"Nothing is going to come at them from the sea," Sherlock says. "They're perfectly content to poke in the mud." He turns his head until his cheek rests against John's temple. He can feel John's respiration increase under his hand and against his chest.
Thanks to all of you readers for being patient through my forays into the Swiss countryside as well as your comments and encouragement.
"They let us hold her after they unhooked her from all the machines. Here's another one, you can see her a bit better." John lifts out a second photograph from the file.
Father appears to take a moment turning that bit of information over, but the connection comes to him quickly: "That morning when you went out..."
Sherlock obliges.
From Sherlock's vantage point, the sentiment was entirely mutual. "John," he said between kisses, repeating it like a mantra, "John." It was hard to maintain a good grip on both of them - and he could really have used some more lubrication - but he discovered that if he held his hand steady and thrust his hips up into it instead, it worked better. John caught on and tried to coordinate his own movements with Sherlock's. He'd been close before, surely it wouldn't take much-
Father's lips form a ghost of a smirk. "No doubt," he says.
The squeal of the water pipes as the shower is turned on punctuates her statement.
Lestrade nodded, as if he'd expected John's answer.
Once John sat down, Gladstone circled a couple times in the remaining space, then flopped down with his head hanging off the cushions.
"Tristram!" his father calls up the stairs.
Mrs Hudson looked up at him from her desk, her face falling. "Oh dear. Didn't anyone tell you?" She stood up (hip still giving her trouble) and came around the desk to stand in front of him, laying a hand on his arm. Sherlock froze as his mind raced ahead: John had had an accident; he was in hospital; he was in a coma; he was dead. Mrs Hudson's next words didn't mitigate the feeling by much: "He called this morning and said he wouldn't be coming in any more," she said, squeezing Sherlock's arm gently.
It was possible that Johnson, for one, knew of Holmes' farce already. Their acquaintance extended back several years, and I did not know whether Holmes had been careful to always apply his perfume and affect his omega qualities on previous occasions. Was that why our host had been so insistent that Holmes and I participate in the night's events? Was he hoping to trap Holmes, or create an opportunity for later blackmail? It was doubly frustrating because I had no chance to draw Holmes aside and share with him my concerns. Yet how many times in the past had I voiced some objection or other, only to discover that Holmes had accounted for and defended against every one, and half a dozen more besides? No, I had to trust that he had prepared for every eventuality, and that we would bear no ill consequences of the night's further course.
"I think you'll be happier not knowing. But John... no matter what you may think of me or what may happen, I'd like you to remember my first priority is Tristram's safety. And I'll do the best I can for you and Emily too."
So it was as I had feared. The loss of his dearest wife, following so closely the deaths of their several infants, had devastated him far more than I had known. Oh, Watson. Would that I had returned to your side sooner. Would that I had never left. Regret is the reward of the fool.
Before Irene can say anything more, John steps forward, holding out a hand like he's going to stick it right in between Irene and Tristram. "All right," he says sternly, "that's enough. There's no need to-"
"Put it back," he tells Emily, whispering so that hopefully Father and Doctor Watson won't hear, although honestly he thinks they're well distracted at the moment. He can hear the murmur of their voices behind the curtain now, but they're too low and indistinct to make out any of the words.
"You'll whip them into shape, dear," Mr Holmes answered placidly, his hands in his pockets. "You always do."
Holmes appeared delighted at the scolding. "Good old Watson!" he exclaimed. "I assure you I was perfectly safe. He has breeding in him, all right. He is a real aristocrat of crime and an excellent antagonist. If there had been even the slightest suggestion of danger, I would have asked you to come along, my dear."
Sherlock pulled a face. "Don't try to psychoanalyse me, John. And that was a terrible analogy."
"I never guess," Sherlock said as he skimmed, then binned, the accumulated memos. He wondered what exactly it would take to make Stamford stop talking to him altogether.
"The imagination often conjures up far worse images than reality," Father interjects. Tristram jerks his head up to look at him. He almost forgot he was sitting there.
Tristram shrugs, but Uncle Mycroft answers smugly, "Practice. And not a little natural talent."
John had arranged for Molly to meet them in the assembly hall while her class took a spelling test (she'd asked Mrs Hudson to cover for her). Sherlock showed Molly how to work the camera, and John played the keyboard while Sherlock conducted. John said they had to do Joseph and Mary's song, as it was the one with the greatest emotional impact. It was also the one that would come over best without dancing or props. Just the words and the music. They had all the boys sing Joseph's part, and all the girls sing Mary's. They still hadn't decided which children would play the parts. They'd already cast the best boy singers as the wise men and Gabriel, and John was clearly pained at having to disappoint the vast majority of the children by choosing only two. If it came down to it, they could simply draw straws; all the children knew the song by heart after those bloody auditions.
"I have to go to work," he said, but the protest was token, and they both knew it.
Irene leans forward across the table, as if to speak confidentially to Emily. "I really do like your father, you know," she says in a loud whisper. "He's so much fun to tease."
Tristram smiles in relief and sits back. He likes it at Grandmother's. They usually only go once a year, in the summer, when the sea is not absolutely freezing and there are wild strawberries all over.
"Does it hurt anywhere?"
"This is more interesting." Sherlock covers John's mouth with his again and brings his other hand up, spanning John's waist and massaging his abdomen and ribs with his thumbs.
"About Princess?" John says, still irritated over their previous exchange.
He wonders if Emily knows what just happened - that she won - but she nods blithely, no trace of triumph, and goes to bring her things into the bedroom.
Lestrade looked down at his pocket as if Sherlock had just deposited the remains of his last experiment there. "I am not going to miss you doing that," he muttered, then whipped around before Sherlock could get away. "What- No, stop, Sherlock. Get back here." He grabbed at Sherlock's arm to hold him in place. "What do you think you're doing? I just had a phone call telling me this was all happening. I cancelled this show and I cannot believe you are-" He had to let go of Sherlock as a herd of angels plowed through between them. "You are sacked!" he shouted over the general furore. "You know you are sacked-"
When it's over, Sherlock is panting and his head is throbbing, every pounding of his heart amplified in his swollen nose. His mouth is full of the tang of metal. It feels like every ounce of energy has been leeched out of him and is now congealing somewhere on the green hexagonal tiles at his feet.
John nods. His eyes are fixed on their joined hands, resting there on Sherlock's leg. "That's ... okay, that's good. Because you." John presses his lips together and swallows. He looks grim. Or possibly petrified. "Are. The great love of my life."
"Anyway, I was married once before. Didn't exactly end well." John gave Daisy a small, self-deprecating smile and took a sip of his mineral water. They were all drinking mineral water. The wines and other beverages would be decided on at a later date, once the food menu was set.
"You are quite healed then?" he inquired, lifting my arm gently to check the skin underneath. It had been a week since our visit to the Inferno Club, which was more than sufficient time for the superficial scratches to disappear.
"I'll be fine."
"And if I say that time is of the essence, and that a woman's life is at stake?"
"I know," John said. He put his hands on Sherlock's knees and squeezed. "And you can. I think you just need a little more. Hm? You need a little more?" He ran his finger up and down Sherlock's cock again, pressing just a little bit harder in the divot of his frenulum.
"Yes, bloody Angelo," his father mutters, retreating back into the kitchen. "I don't recall you complaining, though," he says, a bit louder.
"No, not-" Sherlock stops, frustrated, and tries again. "It's not casual."
"'Invitation' is such a vague term," Sherlock says, already half a floor above him. "I did a favour for the club owner once, and in return he did say he would put my name on the VIP list to attend any match for free."
Behind him, Molly Hooper came in. She dumped her things on the couch by the wall before going over to make herself a cup of tea next to John.
"Where's mine?"
John glared daggers at him, but got up and moved slowly around the room, leaning over to give encouragement and words of explanation. Sherlock, for his part, retreated to his desk and went through the drawers, sorting out anything he might like to take with him.
Because it was all right, wasn't it? It wasn't 'you utter freak'. It wasn't 'get the fuck out of my life'. It was just like before: they'd say good night, go to their own homes for a few hours, and then they'd see each other again tomorrow. Monday at the latest. John would be in a better mood after some food and a rest, and by then Sherlock would have come up with a perfectly reasonable explanation for having directed his browser to John's account login page. Everything was going to be absolutely, perfectly fine. It had to be.
Message: Quick break. You still with Greg?
"Yes," Sherlock said, fretting now because had he really read this so stupendously wrong? Inconceivable. He might not be a genius when it came to relationships, but he damn well knew about sex, and John had definitely been broadcasting on that channel.
"Not negotiable," Father says as he sorts through the contents of the envelope. Tristram sees what looks like a passport, as well as some other papers.
"I need a good wash, for one thing." John nuzzles against Sherlock's head as Sherlock places butterfly kisses on his neck. "Feels like I've tramping up and down the entire country."
Preheat oven to 350F / 175 C.
"I am definitely too old for this. I don't know where Greg finds the reserves."
Tristram would like very much to go to that knife company. Maybe they have other parts he could put into the knife too. He doesn't say anything, though, and John simply thanks the woman for the information and buys the knife without the magnifier. Tristram isn't disappointed. Really. It's a cool knife all the same.
When John enters the bedroom, Sherlock is lying on his back on the bed, fully clothed, his hands pressed palm-to-palm under his chin. The sound of the television wafts in from the other room.
John stayed there teetering for a few seconds, floating on the euphoric sensation of all being right in the world and gently, haphazardly swirling the remainder of his erection around inside Sherlock's mouth as he was licked clean.
John let go of Sherlock's cock, which he was about to protest, but a moment later John was reaching inside Sherlock's pants to wrap his hand around him again, this time hot skin on hot skin. There wasn't any lubrication aside from a bit of sweat, so John couldn't do much more than move the skin up and down over Sherlock's shaft and play with the head and foreskin. At this point, it was more of a tease than a relief.
Sherlock's smile falters. His fingers worry absently at the stick. "She doesn't want to keep him. She's had her bit of fun. You heard her. She sucked the cow dry. It's time for her to flit." He stuffs the memory stick back into his pocket and props his elbow on the window frame, his fist to his mouth.
The point being, however, that Irene really can't be all bad. She's certainly not done anything particularly egregious so far, as far as Tristram's seen. Yet John persists in behaving much the same toward her as Father does toward Uncle Mycroft.
Father said to do whatever she said, so he does. It would actually be easier for him to get out of the closet without holding her hand. He ends up sort of half falling out onto the floor.
It didn't take much to turn the plainsong solo Sherlock had written for the Annunciation into a rollicking gospel song that would involve all the children. Simply shifting the star of Bethlehem song from a minor into a major key and pepping up beat turned it into a foot-tapper. They had the most trouble re-working the song of the three wise men: Sherlock had no qualms arguing that the lyrics John suggested were the worst kind of teenage drivel and hyperbole. He felt he'd compromised more than enough, and was not about to allow his name to be attached to something that said, 'She's blinding me with love, she's my saviour from above'.
In fact, Tristram's father does seem to be fighting an internal battle; possibly regarding how much rudeness he can get away with. After a few moments, he acquiesces: "If you really want to, you can take the car. Perhaps Tristram would like to go as well."
Tristram lifts the lid off his dinner plate and freezes. That is most certainly not chocolate pudding. The teeth he recognises right away, even with the long, curved roots, still bloody. It takes him a bit longer to identify the rectangular strip of greyish material, oozing red everywhere. It's the hairs that finally clue him in. That is a piece of skin. Not the thin, papery flakes that peel off when you get sunburnt, or the dry curls you can pick off around your nails, or even the rubbery, white flaps you can sometimes pull off a blister if you time it right. It's like a slice of turf, thick and layered, with the top side polite and neat and the bottom all full of twisted, dripping things.
"Okay," Tristram agrees.
John steps away from Sherlock to peek around the divider. "Hi Ems, I'll be right there." He goes back to stand behind Sherlock. "He contact you yet?" John puts both hands on Sherlock's shoulders and rubs them a bit as he peers at the screen.
Tristram asks if they can go see what's inside the silver hemispheres, but Father says they're only open at night, when it gets dark and the stars come out. That makes sense, even if it is a bit disappointing.
"Hear, hear!" the mayor chimed in behind him as the applause began.
Father makes a lazy, dismissive gesture. "Not related. Simply the risks of sleeping rough. It was rather nasty, though, I gather. She's in hospital somewhere... I'll find out where this afternoon, then go pay her a visit tonight after you're back."
"Come back."
"Yes, but she just looked wounded and said something about maternal instinct." John's lips twitch, halfway to a grin.
"Fuck, he's looking over here, he's spotted something-" Doctor Watson is already in motion, reaching down toward Emily.
Tristram hears the bathroom door open and Doctor Watson walk into the bedroom. He leaves the door open, as he said he would. There are some soft rustling sounds, and then silence again.
"I'm not backing down," Doctor Watson says defensively. "I just feel that this particular scene is of a particularly sensitive nature and it won't do us any harm to skip over it and continue from there."
hand gives him an unpleasant tingly feeling in his stomach. Can they fix that? What if part of his hand got shot right off and he can't use it anymore?
"Are you actually doing the washing up in there?" Aunt Clara's voice sings out, loudly.
This had been a bad idea. John couldn't follow the movie at all. He was hyper-aware of Sherlock fidgeting in the seat next to him, trying to find a comfortable position for his long limbs. Every so often, his elbow or knee would bump John's. John could have moved away, but the more Sherlock squirmed, the more John held firm. It was becoming something of a game of chicken. John would have said Sherlock was bored with the movie, but every time he snuck a sideways glance, Sherlock's eyes were glued to the screen with an expression of intense concentration.
Doctor Watson's mouth goes flat. "No, I'll just... I'll take Emily and Tris to my sister's if you're not back." He's not speaking as loud now, although his voice is still tense.
"It's not up to me." And even if it were, there couldn't be a show without John. It was unthinkable. Sherlock may have written the music and Molly organised the costumes and the sets along with the parents, but the play was the realisation of John's vision.
"That's jumping the gun a bit," Father answers him. "It may end up not working out. I certainly have no idea what I'm doing. It's more likely I'll do something unforgivably stupid and it will be just the two of us again." Father looks down at Tristram with a wry twist to his mouth.
"I bought Gladstone a dog bed," Sherlock grumbled.
Molly turned toward John and Sherlock and pleaded, "Look, we have to tell him."
Watson blinked, then said, "Yes, right, that's entirely reasonable. But I think they've had enough of sitting. Look at them, they can barely concentrate." He nodded his head toward the children, and indeed, many were either staring out the window or doodling on their paper. One girl was slowly consuming one of her plaits.
Doctor Watson continues to exchange information with the person on the other end, but Tristram doesn't pay much attention after he hears the words 'gunshot wound'. He was shot? Is that what's wrong with his hand? All of a sudden, he wants to see it. Did the bullet go right through? Does he have a hole in his hand that he could look through? He's curious what that might look like, although the fact that it's
"Be outside in five minutes if you want to come." He couldn't be bothered with avoiding the double entendre.
living room. Sherlock's.
At recess, Emily wants more details about Uncle Mycroft: what's his house like? Does he have a butler? Can he get them some plutonium?
"I'll do that," John tells her. It's not an offer. It's a statement of fact, and Tristram is surprised to find how enormously relieved he is to hear that John doesn't want to leave him behind after all. However, it seems he really has missed the salient fact:
Increase the heat of the oil to 190 C / 375 F.
"John?" Sherlock calls once the water turns off in the shared bath between his room and Mycroft's old one.
"Two." Sherlock watched as John doctored the tea, took a sip to taste, and handed it back, making a face himself.
Sherlock swirls the red liquid around in his glass, seemingly mesmerised. "It's also the area in which I'm... the least well-versed."
Sherlock jumped back at the sound of Lestrade's voice, releasing John's hands. John swore under his breath and wiped his mouth.
Which it seems everyone but him knew was just a ruse. Yet another shining example of the Holmes genius knowing far better than John what was good for him.
The only sounds that followed for the next minute or so were the wet
Tristram gives Emily a pair of tweezers, a dental pick, and the jar of owl pellets he hasn't had a chance to pull apart yet. He coaches her through opening up the first one and shares in her excitement at the tiny bone fragments she teases out of the tight, felt-like clump.

Emily pulls excitedly on her father's hand until he crouches down beside her, and starts chattering about crabs and shells and tsunamis, of all things. Tristram's father remains where he is, several paces away. He doesn't say anything, and Tristram doesn't look at him. Tristram pretends to be interested in a hole he's digging. When Emily pauses to take a breath, Doctor Watson asks Tristram what he's found. Tristram just shakes his head and shuffles a couple of meters to the left, mumbling something about everyone scaring the crabs away.
Father slides away and stands up. Emily snuggles up to her father.
Forgotten. I'll bring a camera tomorrow. -SH
"What is it?" Sherlock finally demanded.
"Fuck, Sherlock..." John twisted his head sideways and screwed his eyes shut. His hands clenched and grasped at nothing as he tried to stave off his orgasm for a little bit longer.
Sherlock glances in John's direction without really fixing him. "Yes, thank you. Nice work. Although you did take your time about it."
They hold each other's eye for the space of several heartbeats, both hopeful and wary.
- Mister Tonga, Tristram's heart doesn't fall back into its normal rhythm.
"No." Sherlock's smile is audible in the word. Then he crowds John closer against his body and repeats the answer, more solemn and fierce. "No." He kisses John again, and this time there's more lingering, more depth of meaning. When they part, both are panting slightly.
It's almost pleasant now, with no one prodding at his hand or back anymore. Why isn't he in bed? Something hurts. He thinks it's supposed to be his hand, but he can't feel it, so that must be all right. He shifts a bit and that makes him remember: it's his back. He whimpers and tries to shrug off whatever they put over him, because it's making it worse, but that sends more fire through him, so he holds still again.
Tristram shakes his head. "I don't think so. Listen, Emily," he says, leaning in close so that no one can even read his lips if they're watching, "I think your dad is helping mine with a case."
He did, of course he did. The point was, only very rarely did anyone else acknowledge it. "That's not what people usually say," Sherlock admitted.
"You're a star, Mrs Hudson," Sherlock called back over his shoulder on the way out.
"No. Nope." John shakes his head. "No, Sherlock, you do not get to do this."
Sherlock watched a light reflection bash itself repeatedly against the brick wall on the other side. "The whole thing's wrong, John. There is no movie."
hate them," Uncle Mycroft corrects him.
"You know I never answer calls," Sherlock said disdainfully.
Tristram walks over to her, with Doctor Watson and Emily following. Tristram stops just behind her, and she reaches up to grab his hand. He can feel the way the skin slides loosely over her bones, different from his father's hard, stiff fingers or Doctor Watson's solid, warm fist. He considers starting a new notebook with observations on hands.
"John..." Sherlock's voice is barely more than a whisper, somewhere between a warning and a plea.
"I'm still not comfortable with it. This isn't a war zone."
"And at the end, they all kiss." John grinned, pleased with himself.
John holds Sherlock's gaze for several moments. They can hear raised voices now, accompanied by clattering and thumping. John nods once. "It's right. You got the right password," he says and looks at the screen.
"Not now, Tristram," he says curtly. "Go to sleep."
Sherlock took down two plates and got cutlery from the drawer to lay the table while John cut up the pie.
It stung. John didn't trust him. With reason, absolutely, no question. Sherlock was not to be trusted. He hadn't used, of course, hadn't even thought about using for months. Not with John home, and Sherlock's focus on him, on keeping him occupied, keeping him functional, keeping him from drinking himself into a stupor and walking into the Thames. (John's service revolver had quietly and mysteriously disappeared during Sherlock's time away. They'd never spoken of it, but Sherlock suspected Mycroft.) But the fact that Sherlock hadn't touched any drugs since that mad day of Moriarty's 'return' was beside the point. There was still a risk. How long would it take? What would the next trigger be? Sherlock realised he needed John here as much for his own sanity as for John's. God, the two of them were an utter mess. He washed his hands and checked his expression in the mirror. A little pale. He'd take a glass of the wine too.
"How is that even possible?" Sherlock demanded, tapping his bow on the paper where John was scribbling his lyrics. "You can't actually blind someone with love."
"Fine, but first I forgot to tell you Mycroft is going to bring a date with him tomorrow."
"There it is, come here, you gorgeous thing, you," she said and reached for his half-hard penis as she pushed him onto his back and kissed him. Then she slid down to take his penis in her mouth and coax it into full arousal.
All Tristram hears is something about 'Mycroft' before Father's and Doctor Watson's voices get too low to make anything out. Emily keeps shouting out letters, and it's nearly impossible to hear the whispers from the front seat over hiss of the wet tyres on the macadam road anyway.
"James Moriarty. He's the music director at the Blackwood School. No one important." He shook it off, turned his full focus to John. "Did you find a tree?"
"Do you want me to-" John tentatively caressed Sherlock's penis, which was actually looking rather limp.
John's stomach drops in a familiar way. The whole thing was a set-up. Of course. Who did he think he was kidding? Janine wouldn't have been interested in him otherwise. She probably had a camera set up in her room, a live feed right back to Magnussen, the sick bastard.
Sarah and John had been dating for about six months now. It was all very casual and fun. She'd recognised fairly quickly that Sherlock was the most important person in John's life, even if it wasn't 'like that'. Not for John, anyway, although she'd seen the way Sherlock looked at him, and his possessive behaviour was really more jealous lover than self-centred prick (not to say there wasn't plenty of the latter as well). If Sherlock ever looked at her that way, she wasn't entirely certain she wouldn't overlook the self-centred prick bit, either. He was certainly striking; not just aesthetically but in the way he held himself, the way he moved, and the way he commanded attention and made everyone around him either long for or hide from his laser-sharp focus.
She squeezed his knee briefly, then let go. "Okay. But I think... the reason I offered, and the reason you accepted... that's not going to be fixed by going through with the rest of this. I guess nothing can really fix it, but, you know, sex isn't the only way of expressing love. And I'm not going to come between you. I couldn't. No one could. Believe me."
(See the end of the chapter for
Emily gets both of their suitcases out of the closet and lays Tristram's on the couch so he can put his things in.
Father is now carrying everything of Tristram's; the backpack is also looped over the handle of his suitcase. Tristram feels guilty. Then he catches sight of what his father wrote on his cast: 'Remember our agreement'. Their agreement is that Tristram would get better, and Father would find and punish whoever hurt him. Father has already covered his part of the agreement, by getting the man with the gun arrested. Tristram, however, isn't better yet. That's still going to take several weeks; longer if he pulls open any of his cuts again or bangs his hand on something and dislodges the pins they put in. So really, Father is just helping him hold up his end of the bargain. That makes him feel a tiny bit better, although he knows it isn't fair to put everything onto his father. Still, he says, "Thanks."
"This is madness, Holmes," I muttered as I followed him deeper into the room.
On the other hand, no it wasn't. He was probably sitting in his soundproofed, climate-controlled, perfectly decorated office, laughing into his fist at the mess Sherlock was making of things. He wouldn't lift a finger until Sherlock came to him. And it was looking more and more like that was the only option left. Not that he would help, even if Sherlock did go crawling to him, and not just because Mycroft was spiteful and mean.
"And?" Sherlock asked archly.
"Thought you'd gone home."
The door clicked shut. Sarah jumped up, then sat down again, letting out a long, shaky breath. She should wait a bit, in case he'd forgot something and came back. She looked at her watch. The second hand seemed to be moving at half-speed. Twenty minutes. He might be back even sooner. This was insane. They were going to get caught. She waited exactly one minute, then propelled herself off the bed into a flurry of activity. Trousers on - key card out of her purse - dash into the bathroom and run a brush through the knots in her hair -
Sherlock opened the wine and let it stand on the counter while he went to use the loo. He was unaccountably shaky. In the first moment, John's assumption had appeared fortuitous. But now Sherlock realised the underlying preconception under which John was labouring: that Sherlock was still using. Or at least that it was still a present risk, that all it would take was a single unsupervised afternoon for Sherlock to sneak off and get high.
"I do wish you'd listen to reason on the wisdom of all four of you travelling together," Uncle Mycroft says. "You might as well not bother with false identities at all."
Father stands carefully to one side of Tristram's window and holds the edge of the curtain back so he can look past it.
"Yes, you'd better hurry," he said, sounding completely unconcerned. "He should be back soon." He sat down and started putting on his shoes.
Tristram nods. "I didn't eat any of it this time."

"You come here often, then?" John asked Sherlock.
John glanced up in time to see Sherlock quickly look away, back to the screen. John chuckled, and Sherlock looked back down at him and laughed a little too, embarrassed maybe, or just happy, and John put his hand up and lightly squeezed the back of Sherlock's neck to let him know it was fine. It was good. Very good. Heady. Amazing. He couldn't stop grinning. Sherlock's hand came up to touch John's back, landing somewhere just under his shoulder blade, and they stood there like that for several seconds in an awkward half hug, oblivious to the grainy black-and-white scenes flickering on the screen before them.
Glass! Not knives, but glass, from the window. That's what's stuck in his back.
"That will encompass all of approximately four seconds. There are no best bits."
"Yes, all right, you've made your point," Sherlock said, pushing the rest of the letters back toward John. "They all want to be Mary and Joseph, well done, your plan will make everyone happy."
"Which obviously helped with your leg," Sherlock scoffs.
"I believe it's time to start on your homework," he says sternly, but one side of his mouth is quirked up.
"Is it... Do you want to tell me?" Doctor Watson shifts so he's facing Tristram more directly. His hand is still on Tristram's arm, not moving, not even really holding, just there, not letting Tristram ignore him.
Father flaps at him with the gloves he's still holding in one hand. "Go on. She'll probably be in surgery or something dull all day anyway."
"No, but I'm Tristram's father and I would like you out of his room."
John looks down at their hands. He inhales sharply and nods after a moment. "Yeah, she would have. But there was something else."
"Yes, I do," Tristram insists. His stomach twists unhappily. This is coming out all wrong. He shouldn't have started.

"I have ensured he received proper medical treatment," Father snarls. "Thus your presence. Additionally, however, it may have escaped your narrow field of attention that someone has actually been inside our flat. Someone planted these here, knowing we were out. Conclusion: we are being watched. If there is something in there, rushing out to the hospital is exactly what they expect, thus playing right into their hands. They could come back, remove the evidence while we were gone, the message delivered and received but removing any possibility of gleaning additional information from it."
Tristram's father frowns. "I always do. I'm not the one who-"
The sounds of paper shuffling and chair legs dragging on the floor bring Tristram back to the kitchen. Emily is now writing out sentences for her spelling words, and Doctor Watson pulls his chair round so he's next to Tristram.
The silence only made it worse, though, magnified by the hold Sherlock's eyes had on his. John licked his lips before he could stop himself; a nervous tic, exacerbated by the dry winter air. Sherlock's gaze followed before snapping back to meet John's. A hitch of breath. Sherlock's and John's. Sherlock about to say something. John on the verge of panic.
"No, Sherlock. It's fine." John reaches over and puts his hand on top of where Sherlock's has fallen still on his pants. "Show me."
"Did I? Don't remember. Everything else has a way of turning into background noise when you show up." John leans over to press his mouth to Sherlock's again.
Sherlock made an attempt to sneak off to the side where the other teachers were standing, but Lestrade had a firm grip on his arm and pulled him to the front. A deafening cheer went up from the pupils. Sherlock grimaced and hoped this was all a very bad dream. He still had absolutely no idea what was going on. Was he being given some sort of award? He couldn't for the life of him imagine anyone being daft enough to give him an award of any kind related to his presence at this school. He didn't need to wonder for long, for as Lestrade introduced him and began speaking, it dawned on him in horror what was actually happening.
John gripped the chair tighter. "- All right, I
They both lay there silently for a bit. John heard Sherlock inhale a couple of times, quickly, as if he were about to say something. John's heart thudded wildly, banging against his ribs so hard he'd have been surprised if Sherlock couldn't feel it through the mattress.
Emily shrugs. "Just that he and your dad are going to be out late."
ruth0007 and dioscureantwins really earned their beta-reading stripes with this chapter, and for that they deserve all the cookies. Thank you, darlings!
"Well, of course you did," his father says. "The answer was obvious. He might have made it a little more challenging. But I suppose he geared the game toward his daughter."
Sherlock had no idea why he ended up saying what he did. He should have used something else, like, 'John, I have cancer,' or 'Mrs Hudson's asked us to leave.' He deemed those perhaps a bit too upsetting and likely to involve lengthy followups and discussions, so in the end, he'd settled on, 'Lestrade texted to say he thinks they've caught the idiot who shot at you last month'. Lestrade hadn't, of course, and it was not an event Sherlock recalled with any fondness, so maybe it was that jolt of recalling the fear and panic he'd felt that sent his brain tumbling down such a sentimental path. At any rate, what actually came out was, 'I'm really quite hopelessly in love with you, John Watson,' and to add insult to injury, he found himself leaning down close to the very stunned face of said John Watson, and kissing him carefully on the mouth.
Ollie spoke first, struggling to keep his breathing even. "He said I'd be a rubbish Joseph and I'll never make it in the school play and if I do I'll let the school down." He couldn't raise his eyes higher than the middle of Sherlock's chest.
"I'm pretty sure I saw her life flash in front of my eyes at least twice," Doctor Watson says, but he sounds amused. He drops his coat over the back of one of the chairs and goes over to Father. "Hey," he says more softly and touches Father's elbow. "How'd it go?" Doctor Watson looks over at Tristram when he asks, but Tristram's not sure the question's meant for him.
Doctor Watson is already reaching for his jacket. "I won't be back until after ten. Visiting hours will be over by then."
"Legs up," John told Sherlock, and Sherlock bent his knees again. John once again attached the end of the chain to the bar, giving him a bit more slack this time to account for the detour through the glans ring.
"They'd better have, price I paid," John muttered dryly, and Sherlock was once again acutely grateful to John for having the knack of steering away from emotionally uncomfortable areas.
Tristram is eager to see if it works. He distributes the crumbs strategically in a line leading to his feet, then sits back and stays as still as he can.
"Someone found him in time," Doctor Watson reassures him quickly, "and we were able to save his life, but it turned out he actually did care about all those people he'd treated and not been able to save, or thought he hadn't been able to do enough for. He didn't want to care, but he did. And that hurt him, so much, that he didn't know what to do with all that hurt. Do you..." Doctor Watson shifts a bit in his chair so he's facing Tristram more squarely. "Do you see what I'm trying to say here, Tris?"
"You don't think they're chasing after any bad guys?" Emily asks.
"Sherlock!"
"You look... very smart," John said, laughing a bit to camouflage what Sherlock identified as embarrassment. The compliment caused a flutter in Sherlock's stomach, which was completely ridiculous. "I should have worn a tie," John added sheepishly. In fact, John had also changed his clothes and now had on a neat brown blazer (favourite piece) and a blue-and-white striped shirt (new). He looked perfectly nice, perfectly John.
John looked up at Sherlock blankly. "What?"
is a real person and holds the record cited. All other details are fictional.
John let him breathe for a few seconds before he reached down and switched off the vibrator, shifting a bit until he could pull it out. Sherlock groaned his discomfort.
As soon as Sherlock stepped out of the cab, the entire group with Lestrade lunged across the street toward him.
John laughed. "No, think I got that. Although they weren't half bad. I saw a place a couple streets over, near the park. Speedy's? Sounds awful, I know, but they have what look like some quite nice soups."
Tristram doesn't know what to say to that. It's just Grandmother's house, although admittedly there are rather a lot of rooms, many of them unused, as far as he knows. "We can look around, if you want. Or do you want to go have breakfast?"
Tristram's father smiles at them. "Good. Make sure you stay close to John anyway."
"Is there anything you'd like me to do, Sherlock?" Mrs Hudson asks.
This is an entirely new concept. Tristram knows what a date is, in theory: it's when two people who fancy each other go out and do something together, like have dinner or go to the cinema or go ice skating in Hyde Park. His father never does any of those things on his own (unless it's for a case), much less with someone else. Well, except for eating out; they have meals at Angelo's at least once a month. But he certainly wouldn't call that a date. However, if his father and Doctor Watson went there together and had dinner, then yes, he supposes that would be a date.
Very good.
The drive back was mostly silent, John feeling slightly buzzed from the wine and the looks and the touches, the anticipation of what might happen that night. He still didn't know how much Sherlock was comfortable with; how much he was comfortable with, come to that. Especially with Sherlock's parents just down the hall. And, he realised with a half sinking feeling as they pulled up in front of the house and saw the black town car, Mycroft too. It wasn't that he had a great dislike for Mycroft himself, but there was a constant undercurrent of tension between the brothers that had a way of spilling over into every interaction. As soon as they went inside, John knew, the good mood, the feeling of lightness and happiness that had been buoying them along for the past few hours would start to diminish.
"Off we go then. Let's see what Mr Watson makes of you." He herded the three toward the door. "Not a peep from the rest of you until I get back, or there will be lines," he warned, before stepping out into the hall.
This time, it was John who laid Sherlock out and kissed and touched and elicited gasps. Who stroked and laved and spoke with his skin.
Father snaps his head back to glare at her. "Oh, for God's sake. Pain relief, yes, but go easy on the morphine. Family history. I'll nofity Tristram's uncle. He has joint guardianship." Father holds his hand out to Doctor Watson impatiently, signalling for his phone.
Message: Roger u no where 2 find me.
John lowers himself to sit on the edge of the bed, facing Sherlock. "What do you mean, his organisation? I thought Moran was it, that everything would fall apart without him."
Emily shrugs and hands the strip to him. "It's not in English."
Sherlock had figured out after the second question, based on the response percentages, that there were a total of 9 devices transmitting responses in the pub. Most of them representing teams or couples, although there was one other solitary user seated in a booth by herself, an unassuming white-haired lady with thick-lensed glasses who had been slowly devouring an enormous plate of chips smothered in mayonnaise over the course of the evening. One for each answer she got right. He was all but certain she was 'SassyFox', who was currently holding the lead. Sherlock had missed 'Who preceded Queen Victoria on the British throne?', 'In which American state was Madonna born', and something about Chad Varah which he hadn't been able to see the screen for because a large party had walked past his table just then.
"God, no, I just meant... this. Being together, like this, no pressure and no interruptions."
"Come on," he says, inclining his head toward the door. "I'll buy you a coffee. I'm sure you haven't had dinner yet."
"Yeah." John reached across with the hand that wasn't pinned to his side under Sherlock's weight and took hold of Sherlock's hand that was curled around his shoulder. He tilted his chin down and kissed it. Sherlock nestled in closer, kissed John's hand on top of his. Nudged his face in closer and kissed John on the mouth. Slow and deliberate. John kissed him back, harder, teeth pressed against the inside of his lips, squeezing his hand so tightly it must have hurt. He kissed him until he felt the tightness loosening, until the air flowed back into his lungs. Sherlock's air. Sherlock's breath. He gulped it in when he finally pulled back, but at least his throat was clear and his eyes dry. He gripped the back of Sherlock's neck to hold him there, cheek to cheek, noses nuzzling. Sherlock gave him a couple more pecks, little feathery things, before gently easing back to his own pillow.
They had reached the river walk now. It was quieter here, with only the occasional pedestrian or couple passing by. Sherlock leaned against the railing to look down at the river, tamed here between the brick walls of a man-made canal. The water itself was black, barely visible, but it reflected and refracted the lamps in thousands of white spots that broke against each other and merged and broke apart again. John stood next to him, his elbows propped on top of the railing. The air wasn't quite cold enough to see their breath, but there was a nippiness that made Sherlock's ears and nose tingle.
John stiffened imperceptibly at the suggestion that he and Sherlock were a couple. As he always did. It was tedious, but she supposed he'd lived in the closet for so long it was unconscious.
Sherlock did look at John this time, raising an eyebrow. "You're not."
Sherlock nods slowly, his eyes caught by the sight of their joined hands. "Possible."
"Is this Father Christmas?" John asked.
"There's a reason for social convention, at least in this case."
"Ooh yeah, that was cool!" Saffron squealed. "Maybe we can all dance so Mr Holmes can ask Mr Watson to marry him!"
There is an answering rumble of some sort. Satisfied, Father comes back to the kitchen and puts his tea cup on the sideboard.
Doctor Watson laughs. "No, it isn't candy, and it isn't anything to eat."
"Please."
"Exactly a full turn," Sherlock corrected him.
Either way, the notorious diary was sufficient in the end to convince Violet de Merville to abandon her suitor. Baron Gruner's book was truly a malleus maleficarum. He kept a meticulous journal of all the tortures he had enacted on hapless omegas across the globe. I had but a brief glimpse of the compendium before Sir James arrived to retrieve the evidence and bring it to the Baron's fiancée, yet I am still haunted by the piteous men and women who adorned its pages. Their faces were contorted in pain, fear, and despair, whilst their bodies were subjected to the most horrific and sickening acts. In more than one image, the Baron's initials were visible carved, burnt, or etched into his victims' skin. I did not doubt that Kitty Winter bore similar marks somewhere on her maltreated body, unless they had been obliterated by the vehemence with which he had repeatedly enacted his treatments on her.
"Do you know why she's here? Did she come here to find me?" Tristram asks.
John pulled off and nodded at the lotion sample. "Open that for me, would you?"
"We'll have someone send everything later," Father says. He is clearly impatient to analyse the new evidence.
Jim was smirking, obviously following Sherlock's train of thought.
John doesn't even know what he's doing there. He just had to get away. Too many reminders of what his life has become, what Mary—his wife, she's still his bloody wife for all that—has done. He can't so much as look at Sherlock anymore without seeing the spectre of him collapsing right there on the carpet, going into cardiac arrest in their fucking living r—
"Hey," she says suddenly, her eyes wide. Her voice is a hoarse whisper, as if she doesn't want their fathers to hear her. "My dad said that lady we saw at breakfast was actually your
Janine's watching him, her head cocked to one side. There's something keen and calculating in her eye.
After he's done with the light, Doctor Watson lifts Tristram's hand, pinches his fingers, and takes his pulse. Then he gets out his stethoscope and listens to Tristram's chest and belly. He shakes his head as he presses his fingers carefully into Tristram's abdomen. "You should have called for an ambulance, Sherlock."
Father shifts his focus to Doctor Watson. "You can tell them all that," he says, as if this were something they had agreed on previously and it had slipped Doctor Watson's mind. "I have to stay here and make sure the police don't destroy even more evidence than they already have. I presume I can thank you for calling them," he adds bitterly.
His father looks at Doctor Watson. "You could at least have got them a proper phone," he huffs.
"Yes, and now she's decided the time has come," Father says testily.
Emily's happy to be going back, and Tristram's mood lifts too, the closer they get. It's almost as if the weekend didn't happen. Maybe whatever they had to go to Llanbroc for is done with. Including whatever went on between Father and Doctor Watson. They haven't touched at all this morning - Tristram's been watching closely - and when they speak to each other, it's just for practical things. Doctor Watson hasn't said Father's amazing or brilliant all morning. On the other hand, Father said Tristram should wait for permission before opening doors from now on. So he's not sure.
&&&&&&
John nodded, hummed his permission, and stroked Sherlock's balls, applying just a bit of pressure, and all of a sudden, Sherlock was coming. He jerked forward uncontrollably and his eyes fell shut as he came and came, imagining his semen spouting into John's throat.
"Here?" It sounds like she thinks that's a pretty far-fetched idea. It also sounds as if it hadn't occurred to her before that they might not be safe here, and she doesn't really like the idea.
This takes place sometime after chapter 23 and is in response to a prompt by a-cumberbatch-of-cookies, who wanted smut. :D
Sherlock's eyes snapped up to John's. Had he been tricked? Manoeuvred into that answer to prove John's point? But no, there was no look of triumph there; merely a gentle sadness. It made Sherlock uncomfortable in a way he didn't want to think about.
John got to his feet, stretching his back. "Think I'll hit the hay too," he said, although his mind and body were buzzing. He wouldn't be falling asleep anytime soon. Especially not if Sherlock joined him in the bed. "Are you coming too, or do you want me to leave a light on for you?"
"Pretty impressive," John acknowledges. He hands the baggie back to Sherlock and sits down on the edge of the bed. "It could still have been someone passing through. Maybe they just stopped long enough to light up, then kept going."
John sighs and hangs up his jacket. "Bit early for Father Christmas."
On the other hand, when would an opportunity like this come along again? She was pushing forty, no grey hairs yet but it wouldn't be long, the lines around her mouth and eyes and on her forehead already impossible to overlook. There weren't going to be any more grand adventures or torrid affairs in her life. But right now, there was a dead gorgeous man down the hall waiting to have sex with her. No, there wasn't any love involved, but - and this wasn't really a new revelation - she did care about him, and for him. Being in a relationship with John meant being in one with Sherlock too. This wasn't a pity fuck though. He didn't actually care about sex, she knew that. It was more about inclusion and friendship, and - well, the challenge and the notch on her bedpost, and maybe a teensy, tiny bit about carving a spot for herself in the unit that was John-and-Sherlock. Not as John's addendum, but as the only person in the world who had an intimate link to both men. And maybe that's why Sherlock had agreed to it too; to forge a metaphysical bond with John in lieu of the physical one that would never come to pass. Well, she could rationalise it all tomorrow. Right now, the clock was ticking.
Tristram jerks around at the sound of his father's voice. He's charging across the lawn. He doesn't look best pleased. Tristram stops on the path and waits. He left the bodyguard back in the stable, promising again not to give him away. And the man said he'd be sure and watch out extra hard for Tristram today and make sure nothing happens to him, so Tristram thinks it's a fair deal.
Sherlock finally managed to get his shirt open and peeled the material back, letting him feel the entire expanse of John's torso against his bare skin. He gasped into John's mouth; the multiple sensations of John over him, the contact on his chest and stomach, John's lips and tongue on his face, his lips, his neck, John's firm hand demanding on his cock, were all very nearly too much. And yet he wanted more, he wanted John to cover him and surround him and be part of him.
Sherlock looked at John with a pained expression. "What have you been telling her?"
Sherlock sighed and returned to his stuffed mini peppers. He hoped John had been able to get the recipe. They were quite good.
Both of them look like they're going to start shouting out loud at one point, and there's a bit of shoving over whose hands have control of the keyboard. Father wins and types what must be a whole page, while Doctor Watson's face goes from furious to annoyed to unhappy. Then he puts his hand over Father's, making him stop typing. They turn to look at each other. Tristram thinks they're going to kiss, but they don't. Instead, Doctor Watson puts his hand up on the back of Father's neck and rubs it. They sit there like that for a few moments, watching each other, with Doctor Watson's hand on the back of Father's neck. Tristram wonders whether they are actually able to read each other's minds.
Father still isn't up by the time Doctor Watson's showered and dressed, so the three of them go down to the breakfast room alone. It's busy, with people passing by their table so frequently that Tristram doesn't even notice at first that one of them has stopped beside him. He probably would have continued not noticing if it weren't for the way Doctor Watson suddenly goes all still and alert. The way he did at the airport when he was looking for Mister Tonga.
Once home and ensconced in his chair with his obligatory glass of possibly poisoned water drunk, John would nod and smile and answer yes or no and just generally enjoy being the target of Sherlock's flow of speech. And the cheekbones. He definitely enjoyed the cheekbones. And the mouth. And the curve of his pyjama-clad arse and the fleeing glimpses - when he allowed himself - of the tantalising lumps in the front whose contours were sometimes revealed when Sherlock took a particularly vigorous step.
is going on."
Add oil to a hot pan and heat a little. Add the chicken slices one at a time ensuring the flat side is in the oil. Brown both sides and then transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Sherlock stood next to him, facing the stage, and hummed in response.
When he arrived at the school, there were several unfamiliar vehicles parked outside. One obviously belonged to a photographer, another to a local reporter and a third to a member of the mayor's staff. It was only barely conceivable that the school was receiving an award; more likely some superficial improvement such as a new set of monkey bars, and Lestrade was being made to serve as a prop for a photo op. Inside, rather than finding the halls echoing with the sounds of pupils in their classrooms and the teachers holed up in the lounge until the last possible moment, there was a concentrated drone coming from the direction of the assembly hall and teachers hurrying down the corridor to get there. So, the entire student body was being held hostage to the political maneouvring. Sherlock made a beeline in the opposite direction.
"Good food?" John asks.
"Well, this is a turn-up, wouldn't you say?" the man behind the desk chirps, grinning gleefully at Sherlock and John as they enter. His face is pale and boyish even with the faint shadow above his lip. His dark hair is slicked back from his high forehead, and he's wearing a very neat, dark-grey suit.
Mix the flours; then, using a large metal spoon, fold them into the batter, followed by the milk. Spoon the mix into the tin and bake for 1 hr 20 mins or until well risen and golden – a skewer inserted into the middle should come out clean.
Irene's hand darts out to cover the screen of John's phone so he can't make the call. She drops all pretence, her eyes turning hard and her next words coming out clipped and precise. "You're going to have to. We have a small window - a very small window - to get back on British soil. Whatever small powers of protection you believe Mycroft Holmes might have - they don't reach far across the Channel, and they certainly don't reach outside the EU. You don't know Jim Moriarty, and believe me, you don't want to. Capricious doesn't even begin to cover it. Sherlock's message-" She nods at the phone between their hands. "That says he's bought us some time to get Tristram and Emily to safety. It may not even be 24 hours. You need to stop trying to second-guess me and get your daughter out. Now, on the next plane."
"Will you be in your room?" He feels like a baby, wanting the reassurance, but he would just feel better knowing that his father is two doors away.
"Of course," Jim agreed easily and complied, his hands clasped neatly behind his back.
Of course Mrs Bowen won't hear of Doctor Watson making his own food, and he doesn't want anything elaborate, so they settle on coffee and toast and are soon chatting like they've known each other for years.
But Sherlock scowls. "Obviously not, I can't do anything from here." He throws his arms up in frustration. "I have no signal most of the time, no access to my contacts, no access to
Sherlock wanted to touch John. Constantly. As he sat in the corner drinking his morning coffee and watched John chatting cheerfully with Molly on the other side of the teachers' lounge by the tea things, he feared the sign over his head not only now announced that he and John had shagged, but something a great deal more emotionally compromising.
Sherlock didn't answer. Had he fallen asleep? John opened his eyes and turned his head on the pillow. The curtains were drawn and it was an overcast day, so it was quite dim in the room. Still, he could see Sherlock was watching him, eyes alert despite the dark circles under them. Calculating. Deducing. John straightened his neck and closed his eyes again. It was easier this way.
"I'm sorry," he says rather formally. He really is. Whatever faults Mary may have had, whatever errors she may have made, she did give John something he wanted, some elusive element that Sherlock was never quite able to duplicate. He's not sure now how to proceed.
John takes a deep breath and lets it out again. "She had Down syndrome. We didn't know it then. Mary'd declined to have an amnio done, said she'd want the baby either way, but ..."
That's enough to shake him out of his stupor. What the hell is he doing? Sherlock may be a pillock, but he's still his best friend and John still-- He cares about what happens to him. He cares about him. And John is married! To a woman he doesn't even know, it turns out, but he's married. He made promises. And they're valid, even if he made them to someone else. Right?
"For the rest of the weekend, maybe a couple more days," Emily says. "Isn't that cool?"
to." He met Sherlock's gaze again. Sherlock couldn't look away. Sherlock wasn't just imagining this, was he? John wasn't just interesting. He was interested. He was interested in Sherlock, personally, aside from anything having to do with the school or the play.
It takes John a while to formulate his next thought. There is narrow, dark line of hair leading from Sherlock's navel into the waistband of his pants. "Did you know she was going to be here when you booked this place?"
Tristram lifts his icicle in answer to the challenge and taps it gingerly against hers. The tip of her icicle breaks off anyway. Tristram feels bad and is about to apologise when Emily laughs and taps her icicle against his, rather more forcefully. Another chunk of hers falls off. Tristram gamely hits her icicle again, as he gathers that's the game, and this time his is the one that ends up being shortened. And then it's a wild back and forth of blows exchanged as their icicles get progressively smaller and smaller. Finally, they're both holding little more than stubs and no matter how much they bash them against each other, neither one cracks.
Doctor Watson looks at him sideways, pursing his lips like he's about to laugh. He clears his throat. "Yeah, the erm... the pictures..." He takes Father's pictures from where they are still waiting in the slot of the machine.
Tristram wakes up once during the night, probably from another bad dream, but he doesn't remember it; only a vague feeling of unease remains. The rain is drumming lightly on the windows, and a light in the kitchen is still burning. Tristram can see his father slouched in one of the armchairs, both arms extended across the arm rests. His head is tilted back with his eyes closed and his bare feet are stretched out in front of him, ankles crossed. His mouth is slightly open. Tristram watches him until his eyes drift shut again.
"Shut up," Doctor Watson mutters. "At least my knees aren't jammed up against the dash." Then he turns on the engine, and they are off.
Sherlock has no idea why they're laughing. He only made a factual statement in defense of the frozen horse urine in the ice cube tray. In the past, such exchanges have resulted in outraged shouting and lectures on tedious things like informed consent and public health risks. Sherlock decides it doesn't matter why John thinks it's funny. It occurs to him that perhaps there is something to Molly's secret formula theory, even if the formula remains a mystery to Sherlock as well.
"No, Sherlock, this operation is already bigger than one man can handle, regardless of his physical condition, or how well-trained he is, and I'm not exactly the best specimen on either count."
