John was starting to feel like the weight of the world was on his shoulders, but he had to move forward, didn't he? It was the only choice he had. He just hoped this entire thing didn't end tragically. With all the hard work he put into making himself the strongest Omega he could be, it would be a shame if his father's words to him when he was younger proved themselves true.
Of the three possibilities mentioned here, only two of them have ever been experienced by Mr. John Watson. Was he bitter about them? Absolutely. However, he'd learned early on that acceptance of the inevitable makes life much more bearable for everyone, and it was this undeniable truth that made ridiculous things like heats and knowing your martial arts so you don't get raped by an Alpha nothing more than basic life lessons necessary for surviving what he called the "Omega Ordeal." Unfortunately for John, the moment he suddenly found himself in had him facing a second undeniable truth, one which he was NOT ready to accept . . .
At the blank faces staring back at him, Mycroft sighed as if he were patiently suffering fools. "Am I the only one around here with a brain? Nevermind. Do what you will, but when this whole thing blows up in your face, don't say I didn't warn you. And if you think you're going to come knocking on my door thinking Mycroft is gonna make everything all better then I strongly suggest you put that notion to bed this very instant. I've never been a shoulder to cry on and I don't intend to start now. Well, then. If you'll excuse me, I have some important matters to attend to."
John turned around slowly, taking in Sherlock Holmes in all his Alpha glory. He looked the same as he did the first time John saw him, the only difference being the absence of his scarf and jacket. His cheeks were tinged with pink from the cold, and his breath shown in the light of the day as he watched John with a twinkle of amusement and a hint of something darker that had the Omega fighting to keep his sanity.
"I do," Barnabas said sadly. "I know that, despite finding a mate, both parties need to allow it to happen for the bond to mean anything. An Alpha and an Omega can be destined for each other all they want, but if one doesn't acknowledge the pull they feel toward the other, they're both doomed. I wanted you two to grow up together, but certain circumstances prevented that from happening. I didn't want you or my boy to get hurt, so I was forced to keep you two apart until you were both old enough to fend for yourselves. Now I'm paying the price for it."
The pieces of the puzzle were starting to fall into place, and Greg's motivations and relations to Mycroft became more and more clear with each passing moment, much to John's dismay. Greg came to Mycroft's house for help, knowing that his parents had mysteriously lost everything, and that Mycroft's reputation would ensure that he got what he wanted. Mycroft responds by telling Greg that he'll get him into ABO and help him achieve his goal of following in his father's footsteps, but only for a price: killing Pontius Watson. Why Greg would accept, John wasn't sure, but he knew there was no way in hell Greg would go that far just to become Inspector. Mycroft must have told him about John and Pontius. But how did he know? John had never told anyone about that. Sure, his parents knew, but they were much too embarrassed and worried about the stain a pedophile would leave on the family name to admit the damage he'd inflicted on their only son to anyone. So, once again, how did he know? It just didn't make any sense.
The kid beside him started to breathe heavily, eyes lidded with what appeared to be unwanted desire. Moriarty's eyes didn't leave John's, though the mention of the boy caused a small flash of lust to grace his features. "Sebastian Moran. He's a special boy."
The man in question, standing in the doorway with the kind of posture a statue would envy, seemed completely unaware of the aroma he unconsciously emitted into the atmosphere. His attention was instead riveted on the dead body in front of him, pupils expanding mercilessly to the gruesome sight. John used the Alpha's obliviousness of his Omega to study his physical appearance, trying very hard to hide his displeasure at being ignored.
my family so I'm gonna make this perfectly clear for all of you. I . . . am NOT getting married. I would rather die than give any part of me to an Alpha. I like my independence. I like my freedom. I like being able to do whatever I want without the burden of fear or consequence. In short, I like living the life of an Alpha. I'm not a bitch that needs to be bred or a tool you plan to use for your own dastardly agendas. I am an Omega, and as an Omega, someone who bears the gift of creating life, I deserve a little goddamn respect, so
Turning around, the man-who's name was Irving-nodded emphatically. "Yes, Mr. Watson. We shall continue with the proceedings." Casting one more disapproving glance at the elderly, Irving addressed Ichabod Watson with intent. "I assume both parties have finally agreed to contractual terms?"
Mycroft was denying it. Greg didn't know how or why, but the man opposite him didn't want to think of Greg as his Omega. He didn't know why that stung so much, but the thought of being denied, even by someone he could never see himself with, made his self-worth plummet and fade into nothing. The air suddenly became too thick and he felt like he couldn't breathe. Why did he feel this way? Why did someone who might as well be a complete stranger have this kind of effect on him?
The hope that Mycroft would object was shattered when the Alpha walked out of the room and left John without a lifeline, making the boy feel anger and fear in equal measure.
Mycroft smiled deviously, like he knew something Greg didn't and was proud of it. "The Holmes' and the Watson's go back farther than you could possibly imagine. Their escapades have gotten certain members of both families in some serious trouble. It just so happens that Pontius was dealing with someone whose bad side I'd rather not be on."
John was going to reply, but it was then that something in the air suddenly shifted, leaving him completely immobile. The wind from outside blew through the entire household, bringing with it a familiar scent that lit John's fire. His skin was tingling with arousal, his bottom lip falling uncharacteristically between his teeth. He didn't have to turn around to know who was behind him. Why would he even bother? His hormones told him of the other boy's presence before he could even get a word out.
The Alpha in question, having realized he was probably showing something he desperately wanted to conceal, put a lid on whatever it was his Omega was observing and extinguished the fires of something remarkably akin to gentleness with one drop of icy liquid, leaving behind that familiar coldness John was becoming used to, much to the boy's chagrin.
Mycroft watched the curiosity that flashed through the icy blue orbs with a terrible frown. He had no idea that Sherlock and John were mates before he'd seen them together. After the dinner where Pontius was murdered, there was no denying the incredible effect the little Omega had on Mycroft's brother. While he knew Sherlock didn't want or believe in love, he had a strange feeling the Alpha's obvious attraction to him would prove a problem if the man became entangled in a web Mycroft didn't want him to be in. How was he expected to protect the kid when he wasn't even aware of his own bond? Sherlock didn't know it yet, but his interest in John Watson would turn into something much more dangerous, something he wouldn't be able to contain, no matter how emotionless he believed himself to be.
Something about the way Sherlock uttered those words scared John, like he was about to wed a boy who'd know every thought he'd ever have until the day he died. It was too intimate for his liking, but at this particular moment, he couldn't bring himself to care. Luckily, some of his fire came back long enough for him to speak his mind.
"What more do you want from me, Mycroft?" Greg was whispering, folding his arms across his chest defensively. The anger and hurt on his face wasn't exactly subtle, making John wonder what it was that could have caused such a distressed look to plague his friend's features. "First that shit happened at dinner, then you come into my home and threaten my parents into bringing me here, and now this?"
To say that his Alpha was attractive wouldn't be too far a stretch, though the term "unconventionally handsome" might be a better way of describing what John considered rather odd features. The man's eyes, the first to catch John's own, bore irises of an icy blue hue peppered with flecks of green and gold, each color surrounding a sphere of black that both enlarged as he looked at Pontius, and deflated when he looked away. The shape of them slanted in a way that reminded the Omega of an alien, picture made clearer by the prominent cheekbones protruding and tilting in perfect harmony just below them. His raven locks fell in wavy strands across his scalp, twitching only slightly from the cool October breeze (John couldn't help but wonder if the Alpha's hair was as immovable as he obviously was). A knotted blue scarf covered most of his neck, and the long, black coat he wore made John believe his clothes were cloaking his skin just as the Alpha appeared to cloak his emotions, assuming he had any to begin with, that is. All in all, the man was rather intimidating (not to John, of course), and the way he demanded attention and respect without having to voice it infuriated John more than anything Pontius could have ever done.
Why did he have to have this connection with his Alpha anyway? The man was clearly a robot, if his emotionless tone was anything to go by. What kind of relationship would that be? An Omega who wanted nothing to do with an Alpha and an Alpha who wanted nothing to do with an Omega? How on God's green earth could that ever be possible?
Greg Lestrade couldn't find the right frame of mind to help him justify dining with the brother of Sherlock Holmes. After all, it was no surprise to anyone that Greg was John's best friend. That alone should have been enough to deter him from conversing with any member of the family that's helping put his bloke into a situation he doesn't want to be in. Unfortunately, certain circumstances prevented him from putting his sense of loyalty before his need for self-preservation, and the situation he now found himself in provided him with the opportunity to do what he never thought he'd ever do: keep a secret from someone he cares about.
The ringing of the doorbell disrupted John's thoughts. Glancing once more at the clock, he couldn't help but let a small smile slip when he noticed the brothers were right on time. He didn't expect anything less of them. What did surprise him, though, was the absence of Sherlock when he finally managed to win the fight with his deadbolt.
The fake smile, the raised eyebrows, the carefree attitude . . . it was all supposed to be mocking, and some part of Ichabod must have realized that when his eyes narrowed in suspicion as he looked at his rebellious son, pissed as all hell that he couldn't figure him out anymore than the rest of them could. "I don't know what you're gettin' at, boy, but you will be the one to make this work. The families are on the brink of war. Your marriage could be the key to saving us from certain destruction. I don't give a rat's ass about the Holmes' but they're too much of a threat to ignore. Now, I've invited them all over for dinner, including Barnabas's youngest son, so you'd better make yourself presentable before 9:00 this evening and if you even think about disobeying me, I will fucking destroy you. Have I made myself clear?"
"Why not? It's not that big a deal, is it? You said yourself that John hated Pontius. Why would he care that you're the murderer? I'd have thought he'd be overjoyed."
"Sherlock," Mycroft said from somewhere behind John. "I see you've managed to get here in the freezing cold without your coat."
Smarter. Seems John wasn't as observant as he'd originally thought. Everything that's happened to him so far has made him question everything he'd previously thought about himself. He thought he was strong, yet Moriarty had managed to intimidate him. He thought himself intelligent enough to observe the intentions of others, yet he hadn't noticed anything even remotely off about Mycroft's apparent relationship with his best mate. How in the hell did Greg keep a secret that big from him anyhow? Were the bonds of friendship not as tight as they once were? Was Greg pulling away from John? And just why in the hell was he here anyway?
See, instead of . . . all that, one of the pairing ended up late in coming, leaving everyone else, including John (
John didn't have the mental capacity to wonder what Mycroft meant by that. He was too stunned by his brother's deductions to care about anything other than the intelligent Alpha in front of him. The quickness of his words and the way he'd just dissected both John and his mother without taking a breath did something strange to the Omega's brain, filling it with an admiration that he couldn't quite control.
John turned his attention back to Sherlock, folding his arms over his chest. "Can't wait," he mumbled sarcastically.
Thinking about the two boys filling each other's meaningless lives with purpose was the final nail needed for a coffin of this magnitude. There was no getting around it and there was no use in denying it. Those kids were perfect for one another.
"He's coming," Mycroft said, barging past John. "Mummy kept him busy with something of the utmost importance . . . to her anyway."
"Well, that's just fantastic, isn't it?" Mycroft hissed, annoyed. "God, the things I put up with for the sake of this family."
Mycroft knew this would happen, but that didn't make it any better hearing the truth from Mr. Watson's lips. He'd hoped that this pairing would not only unite the families, but also help his youngest boy know the joys of true love. However, it was apparent that Barnabas Holmes was cursed with two sons who would never know the meaning of sentiment, nor compassion and kindness. They refused to even entertain the possibility that they could be like everyone else. 'Course they wouldn't. They'd rather die by their own hand than let all those pesky feelings get in the way of their superior intellect. They were machines, nothing more, and it was with a heavy heart that Barnabas finally decided that, regardless of whether or not this marriage successfully put aside everyone's disagreements, there would still be a war. The difference is that it would only be between two people instead of a dozen.
A flash of lightning, and rain was pouring off the pavement as if for dramatic effect, lighting up Mycroft's annoyed face. John hated that face, and he couldn't help but wonder if Sherlock had the same reaction to his overbearing older brother that he did. Just that fact alone could be enough to unite the Alpha and Omega, a thought that would have made John smile had he been in the mood for humor. Instead, all he felt was fear and rage.
The next thirty seconds passed by in a blur. John didn't have time to process much, but the next thing he knew, the Alpha was at the front door, poking his head inside to glance briefly at John. "Until next time."
As he watched the Alpha across the room, he noticed that his body had become tense without warning, and it was all he could do not to gasp in surprise when Sherlock's head tilted slightly to the left, matching John's terrified expression with one of his own as he looked at him over his shoulder. The stunned Omega could read the curiosity in the man's eyes, but it was nowhere near as dangerous as the one just behind the intrigue, taunting him with words that clearly screamed
John whipped his head around to peer at Mycroft, sighing loudly. If Alphas had to take a test to see which one of them had the skills to be a ninja, Mycroft would pass with flying colors. "How long have you been here?"
With the trance between them broken by fatality, Sherlock went back to examining the body, much to John's relief. The Omega watched with morbid fascination while his Alpha picked up the cup Pontius drank from and sniffed its contents, glancing back and forth between the tea and the cookies laid out beside the dead man's plate of Salmon. A wide smile graced the Alpha's features.
Hello! This chapter is short, but it starts to get into the complex plot I've been weaving, so it doesn't really carry its usual brand of humor. Maybe it's just me, but there's something darker about the tone for this chapter, compared to the previous ones. I'm not sure how I feel about Mycroft and Lestrade, but knowing how the elder Holmes is feeling gives me a bit of insight into where I might want to go with those two. As always, thank you so much for the reviews. They really mean a lot to me, and I shall return with another chapter, hopefully before this week is up. Love to you all!
John ignored the man's disrespectful attitude and struggled to his feet, the fog in his head slowly fading away as he took in Jim's house in the distance. "So, this is Moriarty's house, yeah? Greg already inside?"
He stands straighter. “Right, well,” he turns to face Mary, who he sees is watching them in a steady, unwavering gaze, “I’m going to stay with Sherlock for a while.”
Sherlock nods once. “Promise.” He casts his eyes back down to his lap, his phone lying forgotten in front of him.
whoever was behind that video, then you can’t stop now. They played their turn. You have a lead. I suggest you take it.”
Sometimes Sherlock feels like he’s trapped in cage, and above him, hanging on the ceiling, there are thousands upon thousands of identical keys, but only one of them is the real one – the one that can get him out of the cage so he can start running, chasing down whoever put him in there in the first place. He feels like he’s in a state of constantly jumping, trying to get a hold of key after key, putting it in the lock and trying to see if it’s the one, but everytime he is let down without fail.
“Sherlock…” Mrs. Hudson suddenly asks, turning around in John’s chair to look at him as he’s binning the food he went out to buy. The Thai crab curry is the first to go. Sherlock already knows that he’s not going to like the question she’s about to ask just by the tone of her voice.
But at the time, John had not realised any of this. He had simply said that it was chilly, that the heating didn’t work properly and that there was no double-glazing, and Mrs. Hudson had said that that was no fit way to raise a child and suddenly he had moved back in with Sherlock.
“Mmm.” Sherlock looked up at him, having been scrolling through a site he definitely did not have legal access to. John smiled at his cleverness. Others thought it was irritating, as did he at times; tonight, however, John found it strangely endearing.
the threat that the shooting in HLV poses. Sherlock can’t emotionally process this yet, so at the very last moment he throws Mary in front of the bullet – because technically, in this shooting, John loses Mary as well. He at least loses the Mary he thought he knew. And so, at the last minute, Sherlock reverts to the superhero Sherlock Holmes story mindset which is devoutly heterosexual and devoutly heroic, and pulls his punch. He refuses to acknowledge the
. I want to home in, though, on Mycroft’s line about Sherlock, that there’s no prison that he could be incarcerated in. This is a bizarre comment, given the events of TFP – it could just be sloppy writing, sure. Or, again, these inconsistencies are pointing to something else, that Sherrinford isn’t a real place and that Sherlock’s death sentence is not a sentence, but self-imposed.
Molly shook her head. “Well, sort of. Just one of those small, desk ones. Fake. But I put little decorations on it. Toby would fight a real one all day.” Sherlock looked at her, uncomprehensive. “My cat.”
poem that will become so important in TAB. Except, this time, John accepts that there’s an east wind coming – he references it repeatedly, actually, as a threat, both here and in TFP. The east wind is the wind of change that comes through the changing years in acd!canon. This seems particularly important here – the social changes between 1895 and 2014 are vital for the next episode, highlighting the idea that the update of the show is a really central part to it. There’s no world war ahead of Holmes (please God @2020) so the wind of change must be referring to something else… I really couldn’t possibly comment as to why the change of time period might be so important!
Despite his surprising insistence on Christmas decorations, John found that Sherlock was far from keen on Father Christmas. Every time John brought him up, Sherlock’s response was simply that he did not exist. John could not reason with him.
And then, on return, Sherlock had sulked. It had been a day, which had not been totally unusual for Sherlock before Rosie, but was now ringing alarm bells in John’s brain. Before Rosie, Sherlock had frequently lapsed into sullen silences lasting several days, but his most antisocial habits had diminished now that he was sharing his home with a father and daughter, something that John suspected had taken considerable effort.
The following scene is an intercut phone conversation between Sherlock, still in Marrakech, and Mycroft in his office – moving back and forth between the two highlights the difference in colour scheme as well as in the angle of grating, which is similar but almost inverted. However, it’s Sherlock talking to brain!Mycroft rather than heart!John – it’s not a row between the two parts of the psyche, but showing that Sherlock has firmly moved over to the other. That won’t be the answer – they will need to integrate for the end of s4– but this is the way towards working out Mary. The split screen effect is helpful here for us to understand both sides not as different, but taking up the same space. This is heightened when Sherlock and Mycroft both walk off, their silhouettes merging into one – they are one and the same. It’s also important that it is from this space that Sherlock makes the ‘amo’ deduction – he could have done so from anywhere in London, but he doesn’t – he needs to be in a heart space.
perspective – and he’s finally realised what it means! The version in which Mary shooting Sherlock means John losing Mary (the Norbury version) is one in which John is sad, goes to therapy, and the world moves on. Now, however, that Sherlock has recognised that John was suicidal, he can also recognise that Mary shooting Sherlock will make John suicidal again – hence why it’s the same shot.
as a John mirror, and just because she is dressed as a man here doesn’t mean we should disregard this. If anything, her ridiculous moustache is as silly as John’s here! Molly, although really a member of the resistance, is able to pass in the world she moves in in 1895, but only by masking her own identity. This is exactly what happens to John in the Victorian era – as a bisexual man married to a woman, he is able to pass, but it is not his true identity. More than that, Molly is a member of the resistance, suggesting not just that John is queer but that he’s aware of it and actively looking for it to change.
Perhaps he would sleep on it, decide it later. After all, despite what Mrs. Hudson might say, the ninth of December was still pretty early.
Note that the red balloon is over the Union Jack cushion, reminding us that this scene is about John in danger (see this post
Sherlock vanishing from the hospital bed, despite being nearly dead, is pretty much medically impossible, and is probably the first impossible thing that we see happen in EMP – but it should be a red flag that that’s where we are. It’s also nice and symbolic of his movement away from that surface level, a level which we see him return to briefly in the hospital scenes in TLD when he realises his place in John’s heart. Touching stuff.
John felt the bottom drop out of his stomach. Next year. Said so casually. He swallowed, took a breath. One Christmas at a time. Sherlock did not seem to notice John’s stumble, and he quickly composed himself. “What else is on? Look, here’s one on the BBC – an old one. 1944. There can’t be anything inappropriate in that.”
The next thing we get is a flashback to Tbilisi, and the ambassador asking ‘who’s they? Seems we put an awful lot of faith in they’. It’s difficult not to read this as a reflection on tjlc and how most of us have been feeling for years now, whether or not this is intentional! She also says that she’s got something ‘they’ would love, if we ever get out of here: ammo. For ammo, we should pretty much always read ‘amo’, the Latin for I love – this will be very important later, but for now there’s a nice little metaphorical resonance here – if we ever get out of where we’re trapped (Tbilisi, or the dreamscape), the great ‘they’ want amo. Maybe.
In the silence of the flat, under the illumination of the ceiling light, Sherlock is struck with how utterly empty the flat is. The dust, still present, is floating in the air, little specks of it highlighted by the minimal light in the room. Apart from the kitchen light, the flat is drenched in darkness. Sherlock feels a cold pang wrap his heart in a vice-like grip. After his return and before Christmas Day, Sherlock had made a habit of turning on all lights in the flat, telling himself that he likes the bright illumination. In the silence and darkness of the flat now, he realizes that he did it to stop feeling lonely.
Some people get a certain twisted pleasure from torment, Sherlock thinks, as he floats in his bed, the high of cocaine coursing through his body. It’s not like the kind of pleasure one gets from sitting down with a nice meal, or even a post-case high.
He glances to the side and sees Sherlock leaning against the car door, typing quickly on his phone, utterly consumed with whatever task he’s doing. Mary sits between them, sequestered in the middle, her baby bump a prominent swell. London passes swiftly as they make their way back to Baker Street.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock finally settles, his head drooping down as he fiddles nervously with his phone. “I…I had no intention of hurting you. I’m sorry,” his throat bobs, “forgive me.”
He hadn’t meant to hurt John. It’s the last thing he ever wants to do, but in that moment he did, and he hurt him badly. He had figured that John would storm off, go somewhere else to cool down a bit like he used to do when Sherlock had annoyed him back when they lived together. He had thought John would give himself some time, stay away for a while. Hell, John had already gone through so much because of Sherlock that Sherlock wouldn’t even have been surprised if John had decided to just leave and not come back. Maybe he would even give him an ultimatum.
John made a move to argue back, but Mary’s face had twisted at the end of her tirade. A sharp grimace graced her heaving red face. She put a hand to her stomach and another to brace herself against the wall. Her breath hitched loudly and she released a low, pained, moan. John’s anger disappeared.
“You don’t really feel like dealing with anything lately ever since that case. You have holed yourself up in here, back on the source. Mrs. Hudson tells me you haven’t left the flat. Look at you, Sherlock. You look ghastly.”
But what’s worse than disappointing John is hurting him. Where disappointment is like a stab in the heart, hurting John is like being frozen in ice, where the cold seeps into your bones, piercing your organs, and your skin feels like it’s being stabbed all over. It’s like being stabbed on your insides and your outsides, but you can’t move, you can’t speak, you can merely sit there and wither as your body becomes frozen all over.
“Oh you can’t be serious. Seriously? Even after all this, even after you know how I feel and how upset I am about this, you’re still choosing
Sherlock smiles solemnly at her before looking over her shoulder into the living room, out into the street beyond, life in London breezing on even though Sherlock’s world is tumbling
“No,” Mycroft replies simply, sitting gently on the edge of Sherlock’s bed. Sherlock watches him take a deep breath. “I’m worried about you, Sherlock.”
And Sherlock is watching, watching, watching, behind a wall of water, trying to claw through, trying to call out, but his voice is muted and dull and oppressed, and he is left to see John’s blood swirl like ink in the pool water. Dead, cold eyes, silver-ash hair stained red.
His limbs, now leaden but feeling light, numb almost, slam back into his chair in a sprawl. Sherlock can feel his hands shaking and a weighty drop in his chest. His legs feel like phantom limbs as his head starts to daze.
It only makes sense that whoever is playing this posthumous game would make callbacks to Moriarty. To the way their whole game started – with a case.
Seeing the plane flying like a bird against the blue sky, getting farther away, meant seeing the distance between him and Sherlock. A distance that John believed would never be closed. And yet he remembers not being able to look away, wanting to drink in the last vestiges of Sherlock he could, even though it wasn’t him John was seeing, knowing that he was on the plane was enough. He remembers thinking that of course,
But then John had said that he would stay. And that he would have done so anyway even though Mycroft had asked, and Sherlock’s heart had skipped a beat before widely thumping inside his chest so fast that he thought his ribs were going to crack under the pressure. He wasn’t going to leave, and he was going to come back that very same day. He didn’t push Sherlock to make a choice. He wasn’t going back home to cool off. He was coming back to
Mary’s eyes are hard and cold, and he knows that the minute they get home they’re going to end up having a blazing row. He should look away from her, but he refuses to be the first one to relent, because even though it sounds stupid, it would feel a little like admitting defeat.
“I’ll see you later, yeah?” Sherlock nods his head in a silent answer. He is fiddling with his phone again. His foot has begun tapping incessantly against the rug. There is a sheen of sweat across his forehead. The withdrawal has started to kick in, John realizes. It makes leaving much harder, but he knows he must lest he wants to incur more of Mary’s anger. Best to get it quick and over with, like a band-aid. John winces at the thought.
He knew Lestrade suspected he was back on the source, but he never confirmed it. He didn’t tell Molly either. He supposes they know anyway, judging by the look on their faces whenever they see him. The way they try to get him to eat, to get him to slow down, to
He feels his face soften despite his resolve to stay cross. “Promise me you aren’t going to use again. Promise me this stops now.”
But the thing is, Sherlock remembers everything about John. The good, the bad. Sherlock had concluded a long time ago that he is unable to delete anything about John. Once, he had reveled in this, in knowing almost everything about this amazing, wonderful man. But now he is filled with such sheer hatred at himself, at his mental faculties, for not being able to delete the image of John dead on the floor. He wants to get rid of it. He doesn’t want to
She must’ve told Lestrade her misgivings, because the next time they met up Lestrade had asked him if he was okay.
Most of the time Sherlock doesn’t reply. How can he? It’s a painful reminder of what he has lost. John leaving empty mugs around stirring his nostalgia, the painful awareness that John is out there somewhere, sitting at home with his pregnant wife, consciously choosing
Lestrade put his hand on the doorknob and pushed it open, and the first thing Sherlock’s senses picked up was the smell of blood. So much of it. There was such a metallic twang in the air that Sherlock could taste it in the back of his throat. It made his eyes and sinuses sting.
Sherlock’s departure would be the one day England would be granted with clear, cloudless, blue skies. Beauty was always the best mask for tragedy. It was only Mycroft’s exclamations that finally brought John out of his reverie.
Sherlock swallows, a pinprick behind his eyes as his mind flashes back to that moment in the warehouse. Except, in his memories, everything is sharp. Whereas the moment itself had been overwhelming, Sherlock’s memory of it is clear and still, like an untouched lake sitting silently under the light of the moon. Almost as if Sherlock’s mind had frozen the moment.
There are days when he feels like he’s floating, his limbs light and airy, as if they don’t exist at all. Then there are days when they are downtrodden, heavy like lead, where every step is a daunting exertion. He heaves like a drowning man whenever he climbs up the seventeen steps to his flat.
Mary texts Sherlock sometimes. And everytime, the fierce longing he feels gets harder and harder to ignore.
He hears a tapping behind him. John. Sherlock can tell that he’s drumming his fingers against the metal lining of the table he’s leaning against. Soft tapping but in an irregular pattern. John is anxiously waiting as well. He can hear Mary’s quieter breaths a bit farther away. But he cannot bear to glance back, to lock eyes with John and seek his support, to glean strength from him, when he knows that despite the relief he will find in John’s eyes, it will be veiled by a disappointment.
Then Lestrade, six weeks after John leaves him, comes to Sherlock with a case that leads him on the road down into Hell.
Sherlock is staring at him, something pained in his eyes. His mouth opens and closes, as if he doesn’t know what to say next. John continues to pin his blazing stare at him.
In a way, it had shocked Sherlock into silence. He remembers very little after laying eyes on the body, and only remembers Lestrade’s voice asking if he was okay, a curse, and then suddenly Sherlock was tucked in his bed. He remembers very little, and perhaps that is for the best. Sherlock does not want to remember any more of that day than he has to.
Without anything to occupy him – be it cleaning or shopping – Sherlock is suddenly hit with pangs of withdrawal. He feels a sudden tiredness take over him, his bones going lax and heavy, and he realizes that his head is aching. There’s a dull noise inside his head, and every sound is punctuated, like a hammer knocking against a gong, reverberating through waves. The light, minimal it may be, suddenly fills his eyes with pure white and makes the throbbing in his head worse. Sherlock swallows dryly, clenching his fists in his lap.
Mycroft leaves after that, and Sherlock watches him enter his sleek black car from the living room window. He turns away when the car disappears into the London traffic, becoming another car among thousands.
Sherlock seldom goes up there for that very reason. It was painful enough seeing John’s empty armchair. Sherlock had only ever sat in it once after he came back – after the wedding. He had gotten home, taken one look at the empty chair, the draft from the upstairs bedroom seemingly pushing him forward, and he had collapsed into it. He curled up in John’s chair, tucking his coat around him like a cocoon, and had stayed there curled up all night. He did not sleep. He got rid of it the morning after.
Sherlock must have fallen asleep, because the next thing he knows is he is startled awake by a voice.
Holmes?!” Mary shouted, her voice rising to a crescendo at Sherlock’s name. Her face was red and she was breathing hard.
John remembers Mary mentioning off-handedly during their honeymoon that she had felt upstaged by Sherlock at their wedding. It was meant to be a joke, but John remembers feeling a little uneasy after she said it. He knows that jokes always have an underlying element of truth woven into their words.
Sherlock blinks up at Mycroft, his eyes wide, woeful, and so very, very sad. “I don’t want to play this game, Mycroft.”
She smiles brightly at him before turning around and getting two mugs from the cupboards. She turns and holds the mugs up.
Sherlock, who John put above Mary. Sherlock, who John put above his baby. Sherlock, who Mary had gotten angry over. Stressed over. Exhausted over.
The words from John’s text have long since jumbled up in Sherlock’s eyes, and the food has long since gone cold. John’s rejection and declaration of leaving (because what else could it possibly mean?) act as a sad and cruel contrast to Sherlock’s phone wallpaper – a picture of John and him from John’s wedding in their suits. Just the two of them, side by side, eyes locked onto the camera. It’s like the world decided to be unkind to Sherlock by placing a message of abandonment over a picture of complete solidarity. Somehow, it makes the pain worse.
John noted the tone her voice took when she said ‘best friends.’ He wasn’t sure what to make of it. “What are you implying Mary,” he recited in a flat voice.
He plucks at his violin, irritating the calluses in his fingertips. The dull ache of his fingers and discordant sound of the violin provides a safe distraction. Something to do with his hands. The music filling his brain. It isn’t a lot, but it should be enough until John gets here.
Mycroft purses his lips as he watches Sherlock’s eyes dart to the syringes on the bedside table, his fingers fluttering against the sheets rumpled on his lap. “Don’t,” he warns hardly. Sherlock moans.
He looks at his landlady, sees her lips pursed in thought, her eyes inquisitive. He entertains for a second to just lie. But he’s so tired.
Now, however, as he sits waiting for his brother to give him his final sentence, he thinks that if someone were to ask him that question again, he would give a different answer. After all, what else could explain the reasons behind his constant evasion of death? His appointments, always, sometimes inexplicably, sometimes impossibly, halted. Is it actually luck? Or is there something he’s meant to do? To accomplish? Something he’s meant to finish, before the universe finally allows him to sink into Death’s clutches? But then, if that were the reason, if he were meant to finish something first, then that would be believing in destiny, and Sherlock would never let himself fall under such a fantasy.
That day was three weeks ago. And ever since then he has been holed up in his flat, not answering any messages or any calls, getting high on drugs day in and day out. He wonders, sadly, how his life had managed to become this.
Sherlock starts to stand to make his way downstairs so he can wait for John outside, but as he unlocks his phone, he finds himself
Sherlock bites his lip as he feels the pain from his chest spread into a stinging behind his eyes. “I need to go, Mrs. Hudson. John’s going to be staying for awhile so I just bought some stuff for the flat.”
“So that’s it, then?” Mary says forcefully, her face back in a sneer, “You’re throwing that in my face. You’re choosing him over your baby? Over your
of being stuck in bed, had readily accepted out of sheer desperation. John and Mary were to see him off, and then they would promptly return to London.
He can’t go back to Baker Street. Not after this. How can he go back and face Sherlock? All he’s going to see whenever he looks at Sherlock’s face is the face of the man who he chose above his daughter, a choice which she paid for with her life. How can he stand to be in the same room as him? He can’t, oh
He dreams, more often than not, of John at the pool. With the vest of Semtex strapped around him, never getting the chance to detonate, because the sniper pulls the trigger first. A shot to the chest, to the heart, and blood is spilling, spilling, spilling.
John remembers finding out Mary’s secret because she had shot Sherlock. He had found out because of Sherlock.
And yet with Sherlock miracles become real. Fantasy becomes reality. The impossible becomes possible. John can barely believe it sometimes, this life that he has managed to attain. This life with this madman, this genius, this detective.
There, right in front of him, lying on top an ocean of spilled blood, was a short and stocky body of a man with silver-ash hair facing away from him.
“As of Christmas Day, Charles Augustus Magnussen was killed by some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger, whose services have since been terminated.”
. He didn’t want to deal with it. His disappointment. Mycroft’s was enough, but Sherlock would never admit to that. He couldn’t deal with
Sherlock knows that John probably wasn’t even aware of the look he was giving, but he resents the looks nonetheless.
to be with him by his side as he swore to do. And most of all, talking to Mary just provides Sherlock with an acute awareness that he is talking to the woman John has chosen to be with, that he is with her every waking moment, that she gets to see him, when he cannot.
before looking up at him and turning the phone around to show the screen to Sherlock. He turns his face away slightly, not wanting to see the message again.
Mrs. Hudson narrows her eyes and hums. “Don’t joke with me, young man. You look like an absolute wreck.”
It shocked him out his daze, and the first thing he could see was red. The dried, crusted blood staining his hands, inside his fingernails, in the crevices of the lines of his palms. Blood, on his shirt, on his jeans, streaked across his forearms.
“I’ve disappointed you,” Sherlock says finally, in an echo of a conversation they had so many years ago.
He starts with the living room, arranging a few papers to make the room look less hazardous. He fluffs a few pillows, putting extra attention into fluffing the Union Jack pillow on John’s chair. He then moves towards the kitchen, where he notices that there’s no food. He resolves to get food from the Thai place that John loves, he’s going to want some comfort food to make him happy after the argument he’s going to have with Mary, Sherlock thinks to himself. His science equipment is already stowed away, probably Mrs. Hudson’s doing. He then goes up to John’s room, and the musty smell is the first thing that hits him. The silence, accentuated by the presence of the dust floating quietly in the air, is a bitter reminder of John’s prolonged absence from the flat.
By the time he gets back to Baker Street, it’s late enough that John should already be back. As he enters he catches Mrs. Hudson hanging up her coat, her hands shaking. He can smell Molly’s perfume on her and the beer that Lestrade likes, so she must’ve met up with them after Moriarty’s broadcast. Sherlock only now realizes that she wasn’t home when John, Mary, and he arrived earlier that day.
He needs to get ahold of himself. He needs to be there for Mary. He needs to do the right thing – he needs to choose his wife.
“Sorry, I’m not doing this,” John threw his hands up, ready to turn away and march upstairs to prepare for his return to Baker Street.
He hadn’t told Mrs. Hudson, Molly, or Lestrade about his exile. Hell, they didn’t even know he had anything to do with Magnussen. As far as they were concerned, Sherlock, John, and Mary had decided to spend a few more weeks with Sherlock’s parents. It was an easy enough story to spin.
At that thought, John’s dam finally breaks. He dry heaves as the tears finally spill over, falling silently down his cheeks. He hides his face in his hands, and cries for a little girl who never got a chance. The pain in John’s chest is so raw and profound, like knives stabbing his heart over and over again with no sign of impending reprieve, that he feels like he’s going to die. His guilt is going to kill him, John is sure of it.
Sherlock shares a look with John. As he turns away, he sees that the screen displaying the D-Notice has turned into a video. He watches as the perfectly doctored footage absolves him of the event that had transpired that fateful Christmas evening. The video switches off. The ploy for his return was obvious.
argument – not the petty things like whose turn it was to do the shopping, has been about Sherlock. Or has tangentially been related to Sherlock in some way.
better. He should have stopped the minute he realized she was getting more riled up than normal. What kind of fucking doctor is he? What kind of selfish, moronic, stupid –
He watched as his wife stared at him for a few beats, looking caught out, almost nervous, as if she had said something she didn’t mean to say. Some inner thought finally, and unwittingly, brought to life. She blanked her face. “Forget it, John,” she finally settled, turning to walk away.
Sherlock, whose position and presence in John’s life had played a part in the loss of his baby. And John let him. Because John
Sherlock swallows after he takes his phone back and places it face down on the armrest. “It’s the only thing that he could possibly mean. If he had planned on coming back he would have said so in the message. But there was nothing, no indication of plans of coming back. There was nothing except that. He knew I would be waiting for him to come back to Baker Street, so he would have mentioned if he was a little delayed or when he was coming so that I would know when to expect him. But he didn’t. So…” Sherlock waved his hand in a gesture of
There’s a part of Sherlock that wonders why he hasn’t gotten back on the source yet, when the very reason he was striving to keep off of it had decided to leave him. He tells himself it’s because if something were to happen, if something were to strike, he needed to be in his best form and his best shape. He couldn’t be bogged down by the weight of the syringe. And yet, here he is, suffering from withdrawal alone in his flat, getting weaker by the day, all because he knows that the real reason why he’s not back on drugs is because he’s holding onto the sliver of hope that John will one day walk through those doors.
They walked until they reached the door to the scene. It was a small warehouse, abandoned, and was probably used as an automobile repair shop in the 70s.
“You said he was a hostage victim?” Sherlock asked as he ducked under the tape, pausing to hold it up while Lestrade walked through.
The jolt back down into armchair sends wakes Sherlock back up from his daze. He finds his phone still grasped in his hand, screen bright, a message open.
now more than ever. And John will stand by her, god knows he will, because he fucking owes her that much.
He was going to help him, stand by his side because he thought Sherlock needed him. Mary had not been too happy about that, but in that moment Sherlock was just so happy that John had decided to stay that he couldn’t find it within himself to care.
Sherlock inhaled and settled back into his chair. He surveyed both Lady Smallwood and Sir Edwin, eyes flickering over them in their quicksilver speed, trying to catch them in a lie.
“Well then,” Lady Smallwood looked at Sherlock, “that’s it. You’re off the hook, Mr. Holmes. You’re home and dry.”
. Their offers of care and companionship have reached a point of becoming almost annoying. But Sherlock can’t find it within himself to get annoyed. One day they asked where John was, and Sherlock had simply said “Gone.” They had shared a look with each other and remained silent, but as he left he could hear them talking about it.
There was a part of him that had hoped John would let his drug use pass. He had tried to wave it off, to will it away nonchalantly, in a hopeful attempt to persuade John to leave the issue behind, that he was
“The cocaine and the morphine help me deal with it. If I take enough, it distracts me from what’s happening. And if I stay in here, then I can forget. I can pretend, until the high wears off and I have to shoot up again, that none of this is happening.”
Mrs. Hudson blinks as if she can’t believe what she’s just heard. Then she scoffs. “You don’t expect me to believe that, do you Sherlock? John loves you, he wouldn’t just leave.”
His fists slowly unclench and he stands up shakily, unpacking the takeaway on the table and moving to put the shopping away in the fridge. He steels himself as he grabs the plates, gripping them tightly as to not drop them due to the shaking of his hands. He deposits them carefully on the table, his eyes lingering slightly on the scratch made by a blade that one time before their case about the Chinese ciphers. He finds himself tracing the score lightly, closing his eyes as he remembers a time before everything had gotten so royally complicated. Sherlock is suddenly hit with how much has changed and how much time has passed. It leaves him slightly breathless. He finds himself reminiscing through his memories, and finds that those with John in them seem to stand out, shining brightly amongst the slightly more dim vestiges of his life.
And suddenly John was pulling him into his arms, into a deep kiss, the most passionate Sherlock had ever experienced. They kissed fiercely and softly, with the ardour of all the lost years and the tenderness of the soft glow of the fire behind them. Sherlock could not have said how long the kiss lasted, for seconds or minutes or longer. When they finally pulled apart, he gazed down into John’s deep brown eyes.
And so they found themselves strolling in the icy December air. Sherlock had been right; a blast of cold wind coupled with the lulling rhythm of Sherlock’s walk and Rosie had slipped into a deep sleep. John had offered to take her on his chest, but Sherlock seemed to feel that it was the least that he could do – this was the most difficult Rosie had been in months, and John had been dealing with it all morning, and John could not help but be grateful. His back was beginning to hurt from carrying that papoose around everywhere; a pram was so cumbersome and could not be easily brought into many places in a city so tightly packed as London, and without a partner to share duties with she was starting to weigh him down. It was times like this that having Sherlock on hand was a godsend.
. If we’re looking for dreams, this episode really goes above and beyond. The premise is that there is an alien species called the dream crab which latches onto your face and dissolves your brain whilst putting you in a dream so that you don’t notice. To make this more confusing, it often places dreams within dreams to confuse you – whilst you’re dying. This episode came out on Christmas Day 2014, so a year after series 3 aired but before TAB, so in Sherlock-time we’ve just entered the mind palace. The title,
Sherlock nodded, and he heard John pad all the way out to his shared room with Rosie before he turned around to the empty sitting room. He had them for a few more months, at least. But suddenly he was all too aware of how soon those months would pass.
We then cut back to Sherlock thinking whilst Lestrade tells him more about the case – what is bizarre here, is that John and Lestrade are clearly visible through what can only be described as a rearview mirror attached to the side of Sherlock’s head. If
He braced himself for the moment. After five long years, he could not believe he was finally saying it. Through those years, the dormancy of these feelings had become the only certainty in his volatile existence. There was a strange nostalgia in letting them go after all this time.
It was not like the following Christmas at Sherlock’s parents, when Mary had been there, barely on speaking terms with John, and he and Sherlock had hardly known what to say to one another.
These lines are delivered so quickly between the two of them that it feels like Sherlock is talking to himself, like Mary isn’t even in the room. The way BC delivers ‘mixed messages’ – it’s as though there’s still a problem, bbc!Mary hasn’t been reconciled to good!Mary yet.
[*I found this on tumblr! And can’t refind it! Which makes me question its veracity – although it seems a really odd thing to make up. If anyone can source this for me, would love them forever – I have trawled my files and I foolishly didn’t save it!]
Fast forward past the face-flicking, and Sherlock shoots Magnussen. This is the culmination of the metafictionality of the episode, and I think it’s really fantastic. The simulation that Sherlock has run to prove that Mary loves John has failed, because the only way to save John is to kill Magnussen and he’s the only one who can do it – so in short, Sherlock becomes the housemaid, not Mary. He takes on the role, and it breaks canon completely. He’s supposed to be above that, disinterested – but instead he becomes the woman who kills out of love for her husband. He is no longer filling the traditional role of Sherlock Holmes in the narrative. He has disproven the point he needed to make – and so, as brain!Mycroft seems to suggest, deeper waters still. The cut to little Louis Moffat screaming in the firing line instead of BC is another hint that this isn’t real – we might just about accept it here as showing Sherlock’s vulnerability, but given that the entirety of series 4 is about childhood trauma coming back up, the resurgence of a screaming child of Sherlock as he recognises his new place in the narrative is brutal. (Yes, Sherlock has a lot of gay trauma – we’ll find out more when we meet Eurus.)
Holmes tricks Moran into incriminating himself by creating a dummy Holmes for Moran to shoot at. It’s true that Mary doesn’t shoot at dummy Sherlock (John) here, but the dummy is set up to incriminate her, and she acknowledges that this is a basic trick, one she should have known before. The links of the empty house and the dummy, both made explicitly familiar in the dialogue, do a lot to link Mary’s character to acdcanon!Moran.
Like a lot of this show, think about those lines for more than a nanosecond and they really don’t make sense. You’ve got to think about them for a lot longer before they start to again. This, I think, is where BBC Sherlock’s self-parody really starts. TAB focuses on parodying, critiquing and rewriting historical adaptations, but it’s easy to see the merging of all of the undeniably
And so, with Mummy’s words bubbling in the back of his brain and John’s in the forefront, he had lashed out at John the previous night, thrown John’s brutal honesty straight back at him, and John had simply walked out. Sherlock had not known what to make of that. They were John’s own words, after all. But after a few hours he had returned, and the evening at Baker Street had been marked by an uneasy silence. John was normally quite direct about personal matters, but he had been silent for so long, uttering only a few brusque and functional words, that Sherlock suspected it was on him to apologise, even though it was John who had wounded him.
“Alright then,” John finally whispered hoarsely. He nodded again, as though unsure of what to say. “Thank you.”
Eurus and Mycroft are parallel oppressive forces in Sherlock’s brain, but they’re oppressive in different ways. Having family members and childhood trauma be the psyche’s symbols for repression is particularly poignant in a queer love story, for obvious reasons. However, I want to take you through my reasoning behind Eurus being the most secret and troubled part of Sherlock’s soul.
; they never name the indiscretion that led the husband in acd canon to kill himself, and given the company that Doyle kept (Wilde, Douglases including Lord Francis Douglas, who was thought to have killed himself shortly after being ennobled – much like the unnamed nobleman - because of his sexuality) it seems reasonable to assume this silence is euphemistic. Let that mirror linger in your thoughts, because it’s important.
. It’s pretty on the nose for a show whose protagonist is idealised in the Victorian age – and sums up Mofftiss’s feelings towards the Vincent Starrett
John bit his lip to try to keep back the retort. Sherlock’s attempts to tell him he was in the wrong were infuriating at the best of times, but this was pushing him to the limit. “I’m doing my best,” he forced out.
Everyone has dug into Mary’s death non stop for the last few years, and I’m not sure I can add too much that is new, but my 2c on how Mary’s death happens is thus. Sherlock has finally come to the point where he can play out Mary shooting him and the impact this has on John, and so Norbury takes the place of Mary in this rerun. Sherlock is, ostensibly, playing himself, but at the very last second he substitutes Mary. Many tjlcers have pointed out that Mary’s leap in front of the bullet contravenes everything Molly Hooper says about gunshots and plays into a movie hero stereotype rather than anything realistic, and I think we’re definitely being pulled into something artificial here. Why does Mary jump in front of Sherlock? Well, let’s think about how trauma!Eurus allows Sherlock to interrogate his feelings for John (and vice versa), both as E and Faith, through a heterosexual lens by being gender swapped. This is a key sign that Sherlock isn’t able to process a queer vision of himself yet. If Norbury had shot Sherlock, which by rights she should have done in this scene, we would have seen John having to come to terms with Sherlock’s death and dealing with it suicidally – which is
Sherlock did not realise that he had stood up and turned away; it was an act of instinct, self-protection. He swallowed down the lump that was rising in his throat, took a few long breaths. John had stopped speaking; he did not want to turn around, to know whether he was just characteristically fumbling for words, or if he had genuinely seen through Sherlock’s callous act.
. To give a brief synopsis (although I would thoroughly recommend this story, not least because it’s incredibly queer) Holmes is engaged by Lady Eva Brackwell (Lady Smallwood in our world) to stop Milverton (Magnussen) from showing her husband some indiscreet letters she wrote to a squire some years ago. Holmes realises he can’t get Milverton under the law, so gets engaged in disguise to Milverton’s housemaid (Janine) in order to break in and burgle him. Watson agrees to come too. When they break in, Milverton is talking to another woman (Mary) who shoots him in revenge for Milverton’s use of information causing her husband’s suicide. She escapes and Holmes and Watson burn all of Milverton’s letters, and then escape. They refuse to help Lestrade solve the murder.
As you can all tell, I'm sure, I still can't add images to ao3, which is entirely my own incompetence. You can contact me for the word doc, or you can find it on my tumblr blog if you want the images too. They don't add much, however, as my own incompetence stopped me finding images for all the moments I wanted to!
. It is a masterpiece that investigates queerness, the canon and the psyche all within an hour and a half. Huge amounts of work has been done on this episode, however, so I’m not going to do a line by line breakdown – that could fill a small book. A great starting point for understanding the myriad of references in TAB is Rebekah’s three part video series on the episode, of which the first instalment can be found here
). Nevertheless, let’s note that this dog is coloured the same as Redbeard, and Mary (a Sherlock mirror in this episode, and in this scene – their clothing matches, and their joining of skillsets to exclude John is the link that has always united them as mirrors) compares John to the dog. We know from the metas linked above that dogs are linked to queerness in the show, but let’s remember that John here is not John – John represents Sherlock’s own heart. It’s going to take longer than this for Sherlock to acknowledge John’s queerness. I don’t think Toby the dog is that important – instead, this is foreshadowing for the more significant dog to come in TFP. The dog also allows for another bit of self-parody in the show – the close-up on the dog running through chemical symbols and the map link directly back to the chase scene in ASiP, but this time everything is different. We have no clue really what Toby is chasing or what the crime that has been committed is – they’re not even running, they’re walking! All we have are cool, if ridiculous, graphics – and, brought down to style without substance, it’s nothing but comic parody. This is important because the opening of TST is so parodic – we’re back to questioning whether the things that people associate with
We then move into Sherlock’s interrogation of Mary behind the facade of the houses. In case we missed the reference, Mofftiss actually have the phrase
TFP and what this might mean, which will help us to understand who she is once we have stripped off the disguises.
. I broadly agree with this analysis; what I’m going to do here, though, is place that analysis within the framework of EMP theory. As a result, as much as it pains me, this chapter won’t give a breakdown of carnation wallpaper or glass houses or any of those quietly woven references – we’re simply going in to how it plays into EMP theory.
, although I could be wrong. It’s marked by the really noticeable scene transition of crackling television static, as though the signal is cutting out. This is possibly a bit of a reach, but there’s one obvious place where we’ve seen a lot of static before.
Both of these are very conscious remodellings of old characters. Much was made of Matt Smith being the youngest Doctor ever (26!), and Cumberbatch’s youth set him apart from the Rathbone/Brett image in everybody’s heads. There’s something young and modern here – but both still dress like they’re slightly ‘out of their time’, which of course they are. Coming to terms with modernity is the central challenge that Sherlock is going to have to face. And then, of course, there’s the hair – instantly recognisable to the character in both cases, yet remarkably similar.
And it is – but it’s brilliantly fucky! Head over to Chapter 7 X if you want to read about Norbury shooting Mary, but TLDR it’s a metaphor for Mary shooting Sherlock as understood from Sherlock’s
He could not believe that that was only a year ago. So much had happened – not only Mary’s death, but this rhythm of life that he, John and Rosie had settled into, neither familiar nor new. And soon it would be over. Perhaps that was why the impulse to get John something important this year was so strong. Not as a vow – he had made enough of those, seen enough of them go wrong – nor as a bargaining chip. Just as a thanks, for everything John had done for him.
And finally, the much discussed ending to this show – death waits for all of us, but can it be avoided – as London turns into the water which drowns out Benedict Cumberbatch’s face. We’re only going deeper.
Sherlock had said it casually, and yet something stopped in John. Rosie could go here. Was that what Sherlock was suggesting? That John live near here – or still live in Baker Street – whilst Rosie went to school? “I…” He found himself quite unable to respond. The catchment area – that was quite possibly something that Sherlock just knew, like he knew dozens of perfumes from one sniff and hundreds of types of tobacco ash. But there was a chance, just a chance, that it wasn’t something that Sherlock just knew. That it was something he had researched, maybe even wanted.
We move into brain!Mycroft’s interrogation of Lady Smallwood. The setting is once again focusing on reflection – the mirror behind Lady Smallwood reflects Mycroft, and of course there is the larger mirror structure of an interrogation room, where a mirror from the inside allows Sherlock to watch what’s going on – an obvious metaphor. Lady Smallwood’s opening lines, that Mycroft can’t accuse her again, are really important – in HLV, right before he went down, Sherlock thought that Mary was Lady Smallwood. He’s playing through this mistake – why did he make it? What stopped him from seeing the obvious about Mary, just as he is missing the obvious about Norbury? Both, after all, have been ‘hiding in plain sight’.
When TAB aired, we were preoccupied with Emelia as a Sherlock mirror, and it’s easy to see why; the visual parallels (curly black hair, pale skin) plus the parallel faked death down to the replacement body, which Mofftiss explicitly acknowledge in the episode. However, I don’t think that this reading is complete; rather, she foreshadows the Eurus that we meet in s4. The theme of ghosts links TAB with s4 very cleanly; TAB is about Emelia, but there is also a suggestion of the ghosts of one’s past with Sir Eustace as well as Sherlock’s own claims (‘the shadows that define our every sunny day’). Compare this to s4 – ‘ghosts from the past’ appears on pretty much every promotional blurb, and the word is used several times in relation to Eurus. If Eurus is the ghost from Sherlock’s past, the repressive part of his psyche that keeps popping back, Emelia is a lovely metaphor for this; she is quite literally the ghost version of Sherlock who won’t die.
Before then, he had begun to kid himself that he perhaps had a chance. The future had seemed hazy; he was no longer foolish enough to imagine a halcyon daydream of love and affection. But a future together, as a kind of family sharing some kind of love; he had hoped for that. It had all seemed possible until John had spoken those words.
He didn’t know what made him do it – the family melodrama playing in front of him, perhaps – but he reached out gently to Sherlock and guided his hand back to Rosie’s hair. She did not stir. Sherlock smiled, wistfully, John thought, as he gazed down at her, hand resting lightly by the side of her head, thumb gently stroking her downy hair. With the arm that wasn’t keeping Rosie in place, John reached over and rested his hand lightly on Sherlock’s. He felt an intake of breath from the other man, but he did not pull away. Neither of them spoke. John did not even dare to look at Sherlock, instead keeping his eyes fixated on the screen, but unable to think of anything except for Sherlock’s warm touch, all his awareness concentrated in that small patch of skin on skin.
A teddy bear, then. Something she could hang onto, remember him by in some way even when she had forgotten him. That would be fine, he told himself, even as his heart sank into his chest.
“I don’t pretend to understand whatever it is that is going on between the pair of you. But you’re the happiest you’ve ever been since he was around – although fewer buildings jumped off and bullet wounds would be nice. But I don’t miss the drugs, the Saturday night A&Es we used to meet at when other families did Sunday lunch – and I’d rather they didn’t return when John leaves.”
more confusing; it’s often cited as one of the most complicated films ever made even just in terms of surface level plot, before getting into anything else, and it certainly took me a huge amount of time on Google before I could approach anything like a resolution on it!
He had consulted Mrs. Hudson, who had foisted a box of decorations on him that she normally put up around both flats whether he asked for them or not. She said that her back was too bad this year, and so could he do it, but he suspected that was not true. Nevertheless, she was nearing eighty; it would have been churlish to refuse.
In case we wanted any more flashing blue light, we see the police sirens flashing in – now as far as I know, police sirens are normally blue and red, but not here. I wonder why. They will be the same, somewhat worryingly, at the end of TFP. Look at how it lights up one half of Sherlock’s face, just like the water did before. Rachel Talalay is really fantastic.
Sherlock appeared in the door to the sitting room. John looked up, about to apologise. To his surprise, Sherlock was dressed in his long coat, scarf tucked in, and winter gloves on. He was holding a papoose.
You were there before me. The fucky skull that glows, almost like a warning that this is too mad. Crucially, in
which at some stage really needs writing, many people have made the point that Sherlock is associated with blindness throughout series 4, and so we should note that the architect of the dream people/flesh avatars is Madame Kovarian, better known (and usually credited) as the Eyepatch Lady. However, there’s one other key message they’re giving us, which comes at the end of the clip linked above – the baby’s not real. Both
You’ll have to tell him. Even thinking those words sent a spasm of anguish through John’s chest. They put a timer on his time at Baker Street, a timer on his friendship with Sherlock. He was not fool enough to believe he could keep lying to Sherlock, besides which, he prized honesty above all things. To continue to live a friendship with Sherlock would be dishonest to Sherlock as well as John himself. It would devalue everything they had. Yet John was painfully aware that in telling Sherlock, it was either the beginning or the end of his time in 221B.
“Hacked into. MI5. Their security is paltry, really. It’s a surprise London doesn’t fall victim to terror attacks more often.”
The other thing I want to lay on the table as foundational to this theory is the fandom’s obsession with TPLoSH [1970 Billy Wilder queer Holmes adaptation, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]. Mofftiss have long stated their love for TPLoSH and even that it is the adaptation that has most inspired them, and I don’t know a single tjlcer who doesn’t have this quotation from Wilder emblazoned onto their memory.
This isn’t just the show trying to remind us of what John was like in ASiP, however. MP!Eurus is the trauma prodding Sherlock’s sexuality – it’s going to be hell to get through it, but he absolutely needs to do it. This is Sherlock’s trauma, not reminding him that John was suicidal, but forcing him to acknowledge it in the first place, something which Sherlock has buried. We know this because of the way the image of John forces its way into Sherlock’s mind – it’s much like the way Moriarty breaks into TAB. His brain is making a connection that he’s not quite capable of making and it’s knocking him. His deduction that Faith!Eurus is suicidal is accompanied by that image of John, and he then re-enacts the food ritual he completed with John the evening John left his cane behind, before throwing Faith!Eurus’s gun into the Thames – proving that it was Sherlock himself who stopped John from taking his own life.
So, his plane comes back to the runway – still in his mind palace, of course, but coming down. TAB – of which more on later – seems to be about the return of Moriarty, and Sherlock puzzling through it, which is jarringly absent from TST and TLD if you’re reading it on a surface level – it takes TAB for Sherlock to puzzle through this and to pull him down from death, as he comes to understand the Moriarty threat. This all sounds pretty vague – the TAB chapter will deal with it in more detail. For now, let’s move on to the other places where the height/heaven metaphor comes into s4.
). As we’ll later discover in a big way, the one thing that is stopping Sherlock from getting a handle on Mary and the threat she represents is that he can’t acknowledge his love for John as playing a part in this – he can’t understand why love is such an enormous threat. He will get there (at least partially) at the end of TST, but not until then. Just like the Sherlock-is-murdered metaphor in TSoT represents his realisation that he is in love with John, Mary’s attack on him here in a church stops him from getting to the bottom of what is going on with Mary.
A dreamscape coincidence takes place behind Ajay in this scene – before we know that he is Ajay, and the A in AGRA, we see the A behind him on the shelf, as though calling it out to us. This world is too interconnected to be real; its whole fabric seems to self-reference.
It's worth pointing out that there are several different versions of EMP theory – I personally subscribe to the idea that this is Sherlock’s mind palace after being shot by Mary, but there are plenty of popular theories on John’s ‘Mind Bungalow’, blog theory, which I don’t want to dismiss out of hand. However, I think the obsession with the figure of Sherlock Holmes and who that might be throughout the fourth series is thematically consistent with it being from Sherlock’s perspective, as is the precedent from TAB.
Moriarty coming back isn’t what’s supposed to happen. It doesn’t happen in the books. We’re telling the wrong story here. (Bear in mind, from previous chapters, that Jim represents Sherlock’s fear that John’s life is in danger.) Just like Jim returning isn’t the right story, but it’s the one that happened, Charlie’s story isn’t the right story but it’s the one that happened – and indeed, Sherlock needing to save John from a dangerous marriage + suicide is
Something that’s interesting here, is that there is a real shift away from the implications of the dummy in acd canon. In acd canon, Moran attempts to murder Holmes, which is a way of catching him in the act and sending him to prison. This is about catching Mary in the act in a similar sense, but it’s about being caught by John. This is interesting, because it shows that Sherlock’s priorities have shifted from acd canon – or, more accurately, we’re seeing the priorities that weren’t reported in the Strand. The emotional impact on John is far more important than the legal ramifications – and this in itself is the shift which the creators have been pretty emphatic about taking from the original stories.
[There’s a fantastic framing of Sherlock here between two portraits, a man and a woman, seemingly ancestral – I would love to know more about these, because if I know Arwel they’re significant, and the way they hang over Sherlock is really metaphorically suggestive. If anyone has any info on that, it looks like a really good avenue to explore.]
The previous day, Sherlock had found excuse after excuse to avoid more than functional conversation with John. John did not blame him. Sherlock had not mentioned the kiss, a fact for which John was grateful.
(please skip to the next paragraph if you haven’t seen this film because it’s fantastic) where the film lets the viewer rest on their laurels and slip into normal, objective viewing patterns when of course it’s a subjective, flashback narrative, which Kevin Spacey is deliberately obscuring to trick an audience. This rug pull can be fantastic, but we don’t have such a rug pull here. Either it’s a poor man’s version, or there’s something else going on. Mug drop.
Mary showing up on a Miss Me? DVD raises the question of how the hell it got there – dream logic, fine. All a bit
Sherlock had met the cat at least five times up to this point, and deduced his existence from the hairs on Molly’s clothing on the daily, but had never managed to remember his name. Toby. He made a mental note to log it, but already knew his brain had given it up as a bad job. Some things just weren’t important.
Hypothesis theory – that Sherlock is running simulations in his MP – is not something I hold with through all of EMP, but I do hold with it to the end of HLV. It’s something that we know Sherlock does in real life because of THoB, both in acd!canon and in bbc!canon – he stages something in order to prove it to himself. In this case, he’s not able to see the war between Mary and Magnussen play out, so he’s running it himself, and we’ve already seen him desperately trying to prove Mary’s innocence, and more than that her love for John. But this trip to Appledore will prove that impossible.
to help him parse it. This doesn’t go away when TAB ends! Moving into TST, one of the striking things is that cases are still repeating!
If we accept that s4 takes place inside Sherlock’s MP, this makes more sense, because all of the characters are manifestations of different parts of Sherlock’s psyche and so he can jump between perspectives. It also means that the terror of being on a crashing plane that Eurus has felt ever since she was a child is not hers – it’s Sherlock’s. If we remember that planes are synonymous with dying in this show, an association that’s reinforced because of the “sleeping” people on the plane, a clear throwback to the dead passengers in ASiB, the climax of S4, when Sherlock is trying to save John and work out his repressed memories, is all fuelled by a child’s nightmare of dying, a terror that has resurfaced.
John nodded. Yes. Of course he did. Still, it was a reminder to him that time was beating on, and he not heeding it.
Sherlock gets off the tarmac suggests that such mixing is still going on, and we shouldn’t trust our senses. In case that point needed hammering any more, however, Steven Moffat gave us
suggest that a lot of the inconsistencies that make HLV onwards quite dreamlike are absolutely deliberate, which has never been explained in the context of the show. In fact, Douglas MacKinnon specifically suggests that the plane could be in Sherlock’s mind, which has no bearing on the superficial plot unless you buy into EMP theory. We’ve also already been shown that the modern day, particularly when it’s fucky, can be in a mind palace illusion in TAB, and we can read that as a kind of rehearsal for the proper fucky mind palace stuff in S4, a clue that everything is not as it seems – much like the Mayfly Man’s murder rehearsal in TSoT.
I’m not going to comment on the bus scene because I have a chapter dedicated to Eurus moments before TFP – jumping straight ahead.
John fumbled to speak further, concerned perhaps that Sherlock was unsure. “It’s just that Rosie – she likes it here. And without a mum – I’m a crap parent, Sherlock. Mine were crap and I’m frightened I’ll be crap. And it really helps having someone else around, so I’m not always second guessing myself, you know? And Rosie adores you – and Mrs. Hudson as well –“
Yet John knew that these were not the questions that were really bothering him. If John’s military training had taught him one thing, it was that he could muddle through pretty much anything. He could make that work. But he could not make it work without Sherlock.
Amy asks the Doctor what is the point of him, and John’s declaration that Sherlock has broken his vow carries similar weight – they were supposed to save them.
The church bells rang out their harsh knell into the bracing December air. Sherlock stood outside the church gates, waiting.
co-stars Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton, an episode which pulls this off marvellously, although with a big cn: for death. In this moment in
The message that Sherlock texts Mary, “The stage is set. The curtain rises.” has been seen before – it’s what he says in TAB before running an entire Victorian fever dream of a simulation (
Sherlock normally stayed up until the early hours, whereas John was more sensible; it was no surprise, then, that he had never noticed this before, those crucial hours being the few he seemed to salvage from each night for sleep. “You should have said.”
The fact that Mary’s real name is not Mary is used to great effect here – it could have just been throwaway, but instead in this scene they actually conceptualise Mary and Rosamund as different people. I read this scene as ‘Mary’ being the name for Watson’s canon wife, and Rosamund being our current Mary – so heart!John saying that he liked Mary is his inability to break with established canon. Simultaneously, however, he says “I used to” – he’s caught in a bind, because that canon breakage is already happening.
I will talk a lot in Chapter 10 X about how MP!Mary is linked to Sherlock’s compulsory heterosexuality; at the end of TST, Sherlock substitutes Mary’s body for his because he cannot conceive of John’s queer grief without breaking himself. This is interesting because the E of Eurus actually stands for Elizabeth in this scene (certainly in the credits, and possibly elsewhere, although I can’t remember Sian Brooke actually saying it). Elizabeth is Mary’s middle name in BBC Sherlock, which looks like another of those shared name links our creators love so well. If so, this begins to justify how Sherlock’s heart is conceiving of its emotions. We will see in TLD that heart!John’s relationship with fem!John in the form of Eurus is aligned with Sherlock’s sexual desire in the form of MP!Irene. Both are hidden and exist only in texts – i.e., they cannot be spoken yet. But they will be.
Rosie was crying. She had been crying, it seemed, for the last hundred years. John had tried feeding her, changing her, anything and everything he could think of, and still she wailed. He heard the door click to Sherlock’s bedroom with a wince. Sherlock had a case, an eight, he had informed John over breakfast, and had shut himself in his room all morning to do research. John had occasionally heard the voices of Scotland Yard personalities he knew through the wall when he went past – video calls, presumably, though what they thought of the screaming baby John did not know. He did not want Sherlock to think he had agreed to domesticity with the Watsons too soon.
Then we have a quick flashback to the canteen scene. A lot of EMP theory has drawn on the canteen scene, and how phenomenally dreamlike the entire situation is. There is no way this can take place in Speedy’s – in terms of the timeline, it can’t even take place in the hospital canteen! However, it seems to draw on a mental image of Speedy’s because of the visual similarities between them (referenced in this meta, although this meta makes the argument for the reality of the scene
“You’ve hurt me, Sherlock. It hurts me to see you this way. It aches watching you do this to yourself. Don’t make me go through this.”
Seeing them again after thinking he was never going to come back was like a punch to the gut. Lestrade’s smiling and jovial face, Molly’s kind eyes – he was overcome with a profound sadness at the thought that he was never going to see them again. He loves them, and Mrs. Hudson too, and when he’s with them they help him forget about John. Except they don’t, not at all. Even when he’s with them, he is so very aware of the empty space by his side, and everytime he is hit with a strong pang of longing so profound that sometimes he feels ready to keel over.
fingertips. The light streaming in from the windows is hurting his eyes and making his head pound. His throat feels scratchy and temptation is starting to broil in the pits of his stomach. He swallows shakily.
After a while (minutes, hours?), Sherlock lets his phone drop from his hands, the object thumping as it lands on the rug underneath his chair. He picks up his violin and plucks at the strings until morning.
At that, Mrs. Hudson chuckles. A soft, dainty sound that warms Sherlock’s heart. He feels his heart do a little flip, and he’s suddenly hit with the fact that he has missed her so much while he was in confinement. The thought of not seeing her again physically pains him. Having her in front of him makes him even more glad that he’s back. Smelling Molly’s perfume and Lestrade’s beer also hits him with a pang of longing for his other two friends.
The cases are providing a distraction, but only just. In the quiet air of the night, he can feel the niggling at the back of his mind inching its way forward, making its presence all the more strong by the second. He copes by biting his nails down to the nub, by plucking his violin strings until his fingers bleed, and sometimes he sleeps. Not often enough to quell his constant fatigue, but he still sleeps. He finds that he can barely keep food down, even though some days he finds himself utterly ravenous. The consequences are reflected back to him every night. Sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, loss of muscle. He’s always been slim but now he’s thin as a stick, even thinner than he had been when he had first met John. His hair has lost its sheen, becoming coarse and thin. He’s lucky it hasn’t started to fall out yet. His lips are chapped and cracked, his nails blood-ridden, and his eyes are framed by dark hollow circles. The shaking in his hands persists, becoming worse by the day. Lestrade looked at him once, his eyes wide and sad, his worry unspoken in the air between them. Sherlock had simply looked away.
moment, feels as if he is just that little boy he once was, hiding in his room, his big brother by his side.
He watches her dazedly as she takes a look around the room, clocking the cold food on the table then the blood stains on Sherlock’s violin where it slipped towards the floor as Sherlock slept before finally resting on Sherlock’s blood-crusted fingertips. She takes a seat in John’s armchair.
Sherlock felt his lips turn downwards. There was something there, niggling at the back of his head that emerged when Lestrade started telling his story. But he didn’t know what. It was like a corn kernel stuck between teeth, you know it’s there, but you can’t get it out.
again. Because Sherlock was wrong, John. You didn’t choose me. You have never chosen me. You have always chosen
“Staying with Sherlock doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten about the baby,” John grinds out. “I made a promise to Mycroft that I would look after Sherlock. I intend to keep that promise.”
John feels like he’s going to be sick. He drops his phone from his hands as if it scalded him, and watches it scatter across the linoleum floor, Sherlock’s text still illuminated on the screen. John can’t bear to look at it. His hands are shaking.
He heard John groan behind him, a sound he is very much well acquainted with. “Sherlock, for Christ’s sake, don’t bloody ques-”
Mycroft feels a pang in his chest. He thinks it may be sorrow. Or maybe it is sadness. “No, I imagine you do not.”
Sherlock leaned forward, narrowing his eyes as he pinned his stare onto Lady Smallwood. “Simplicity is the easiest form of deception. What’s the catch?”
“I said forget it. I just blurted it out, I wasn’t thinking. It’s nothing to concern yourself with. Forget about it. Now, are you staying here, or not?” Mary babbled.
John’s chest tightens with a profound guilt. It feels like he’s choking on air. He shouldn’t have pushed. He shouldn’t have shouted at her and he should’ve known better. She deserves better than a man who helped push her to the edge. He has to make it up to her,
Sherlock is blinking rapidly again, but he nods slowly and looks back down to his lap where his hands are now twiddling together as if he doesn’t know what to do with them. Mary, however –
He watched as Lady Smallwood and Sir Edwin turned to look at Mycroft. A beat passed, and they nodded their heads at his brother.
John had left around 2pm, he should have been here already. Sherlock clenches his fist around his phone, willing his vision to become clearer as he presses his contacts list and scrolls down to John’s name. He presses his name and types out a text message.
“There is no catch, Mr. Holmes,” Sir Edwin responded swiftly. “We need you to take care of this problem, and in payment for your service we have decided to grant you your freedom.”
Mary made a move to move away again, her voice finally reaching a loud, angry rumble as she spat out ‘
“Pressure points, you said John. Magnussen had pressure points. Your pressure point was me. You were Sherlock’s. He knew that if Magnussen were to release his information on me it would affect
“That is not what I said. Don’t you dare twist my words,” John clapped back. He clenches his left hand by his side.
When he had first approached Lestrade after his return, the man had smiled cheerily, if a little anxious, clapping him on the back and expressing his happiness at Sherlock’s return. Molly had gripped his hands inside her own petite ones, smiling softly at him and saying quietly, but resolutely, that she was glad he had abandoned Mycroft’s mission to come back and teasing him slightly that he was England’s knight in shining armour. He had smiled back, because what else could he do, but as he left he saw her soft smile turn into a concerned frown, a slight furrow in her eyebrows that indicated she thought something wasn’t entirely right.
John sniffs, then takes a deep breath. His left hand twitches. He leans his head against the wall. The plastic chair is making his arse and back ache. He doesn’t care. He closes his eyes.
John watches as Sherlock works his jaw, his quicksilver eyes boring into John. The attention makes John’s throat dry.
He turned to look at Mycroft and found his brother staring back at him, his gaze so intense that Sherlock felt Mycroft was trying to burn through his retinas.
“No,” John responded, walking in front of her and stopping her in her tracks. “What were you implying?”
