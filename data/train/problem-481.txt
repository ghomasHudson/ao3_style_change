"William Sherlock Scott Holmes, are you saying that your bride-to-be is not beautiful?" Sherlock rubbed the spot he had been hit.
"I'm being completely sincere. If you don't believe me that's fine, it will heal fine on its own either way. However, you're going to have to help me get you home as I don't have a clue where you live."
Bill was sitting on the ground, eyes widened with panic as he clutched a wound on his thigh. The poor sod had been unfortunate enough to be hit with a bullet to the femoral artery as well as the femur, causing pieces of fractured bone to jut out at odd angles while the artery spurted blood with the same sort of enthusiasm that a lovely park fountain might.
Sherlock's parents greeted her excitedly, well, that is to say Virginia was excited but Wolfson, as was his nature, was smiling gently at her from a few steps away as his wife crushed her daughter-in-law's ribs more effectively than her bodice. And to Wolfson's right was a man and a young lady.
"Thank you, I appreciate that. And I still appreciate you fighting for me." Jane murmured, catching his eye. "It's not your fault that Moriarty is a prick that thinks he owns everything."
"I will take your advice, Dr. Watson." Sherlock murmured, carefully shifting to lay down. His eyes closed and it seemed he was already half asleep, but as if remembering the manners he reserved only for her he mumbled, "Thank you."
"Fine. But this conversation is far from over." Harry narrowed her eyes before turning to look at the ranger. "Is there anything I need to sign?"
"This is Princess Sherlock. I guess she's staying with us until the end of summer." John explained with a very heavy sigh.
“I’m insulted that you would even insinuate such a thing!” he replied through a smile. “Come on, we must find you something ravishing to wear. The engagement party is this evening.”
"He didn't remove my clothes or defile me, if that's what you're worried about." Jane remembered how valued virginity was in this time, and while John technically was not a virgin, curiosity had gotten the better of her at one point and she discovered that she did have an intact maidenhead.
"Wha- Ours is not an arranged marriage, a marriage with an arrangement, yes, but our parents most certainly did not plan this out for us." Sherlock defended, softening after a moment. "I suppose my concern for you arises from you dancing with Moriarty. You seemed... shocked by something."
“Well, you must not come from a place with many decent people.” Molly replied with a sweet smile. “I was just showing you the courtesy of the Christian hospitality I was raised with.”
“Well spoken, dear.” Ms. Adler murmured, moving to stand beside him and take his arm. Sherlock gave Jane a concerned glance which she merely batted away with an affectionate smile. “We look forward to seeing you all at our wedding next week!”
Normally, one would participate in things he might never get a chance to do again when in an unfamiliar town on the border of two nations, but John wasn’t exactly in the mood for tourism or sightseeing. Unfortunately for him, it seemed a young blonde woman in a floor length floral silk dressing gown and a gold turban that looked suspiciously more like a shower cap had different ideas as she hooked her arm around his own.
After a moment or so he started moving his hips, kissing her deeply as he established a pace to build up. He broke their kiss to start fucking her in earnest and she adored it. Soon she was clinging to him, moaning his name in his ear as he thrust into her.
John was going to refuse but he paused. It wasn’t like he was going to use the money… he might as well help this pretty lady earn a living, even if it was a dishonest one. Hesitantly, he nodded and her smile widened impossibly. She dragged him into a store a few meters away.
"Please, Jane. Call me Greg. If I'm going to be using your Christian name, it's only fair you use mine as well." he murmured, helping Molly off the table nimbly. She smiled and gave Jane a hug.
“Quite right. Caroline, Charles, and I arrived early last week to resume our investigations. We left the remainder of our troops in Romania, which, it seems, was for the best. For the first time in months we received a lead.”
“When you went to the kitchen, before we came here. There was a reason for that.”He pursed his lips; it was foolish of him to underestimate the doctor.
“Like hell I am,” Molly said loudly, causing both John and Sherlock to stop moving. She stared John directly in the eyes. “I'm involved now. You're stuck with me. Whatever plan you have, I'm not going to sit back and watch you get yourselves killed.”
Sherlock sighed. “I don't see why it would be any more believable coming from him than it would be from me.”
John stopped the absent swaying he was doing as he spoke and looked and Mycroft in confusion.“Er, no.”
“At that point, Mycroft was nearly gone. I had very little time to give him my own blood, and bring him to his home. As I buried him beneath the floorboards, I did not know whether the other vampire’s blood would turn him, or whether I was fast enough to turn him with my own.” He leaned back. “Now we know.”
“Yes, it was,” John said, walking over the body, which was quickly expelling dark, stagnant blood. He lifted the crossbow from Molly's hands, setting it aside. Before he could say anything else to her, Sherlock was at his side, pulling her away from him, and turning her so she wasn't facing the vampire's body.
“Crawling with tourists - it’s a big spot for ghost hunters,” John said, trying not to roll his eyes.
John finished loading up his coat and clicked his revolver into place, hidden well inside his jacket.
John growled and, as he turned, a flash of white near his mouth was made visible. The two moved even faster, their movements increasingly vicious, and with the clear intent to kill. While little else that had happened so far made absolute sense to the observers of the fight, they knew enough that they were not to step in. Instead, they flinched whenever John deflected the vampire's attacks a moment too late. Thomas managed to throw off John's measured rhythm as he feigned movement towards Mycroft, and wrapped a pale, strong hand around John's throat. As spots appeared in his eyes, he felt himself slip from consciousness, and into a memory – one regarding his army training.
“Fangs,” he said simply, looking directly at John's slightly open mouth. The tips of sharp points were visible within.
Immediately relieved of the need to appear well, Mycroft stumbled to the bed. He found himself barely able to grip the nightstand, and reflected on how weak the daylight so far away was making him. He would have thought further on the curious nature of vampirehood, but found himself unable to as every mental process he had available to him shut down, one by one. Just before he lost control entirely of his mind, he pushed himself away from the nightstand with one hand and landed on the bed. Slowly, his world went dark, and he fell into a world without dreams.
John had always been pleased to work on such a well-equipped, well-protected base. He felt a sense of pride that he was not only trusted enough to take care of it, but to take charge as well. His regiment was not especially well-publicized; certainly, the fact that vampires existed was all but forbidden to speak of outside of the highest echelons of the army. Nevertheless, John and his recruits knew that they were part of something important. Possibly part of one of the most important regiments on earth.
“You’re betting an awful lot of lives on the possibility that the key to these murders is in Britain,” Charles said, doing his best not to step any closer to John.
Mycroft was unsure whether he screamed aloud, or whether the screams were only in his mind. Regardless, the other man – creature – seemed to hear it.
“Be careful,” he said, awkwardly placing a hand on her arm. “These murders aren't stopping and Sherlock isn't close to figuring it out. Take care of yourself.”
Lestrade continued, “Not that I’d ever be able to tell them what I’m doing here. That’s a kick in the bollocks, isn’t it?”
“You were out about twenty minutes,” John answered. “That's about as long as hemlock can be relied on.”
“Quite right,” Sherlock confirmed. “I try to observe and add to my database, not assume I know everything.”
John looked from one man to the other. “Are we being taken off the case?” He asked, crossing his arms and nodding at the folder on Lestrade's desk.
“Sherlock, stake!” He called, and looked to his left. The detective, whose scarf had been torn by the vampire that had run at him, immediately threw a piece of the broken crate towards John. Just as he caught it, the vampire was on him, digging its nails into his neck. Tilting his wrist, John brought the piece of splintered wood up, and in seconds felt the body on top of himself go limp. He pushed it off of himself, scrambled to the side to pick up the knife that had been knocked out of his hands, and got to his feet, just as a tall, blond vampire came towards him, eyes blank and his fangs shining in the light. Leaning back with his left shoulder, John released the blade enough to allow it to fall, catching it again by the tip and throwing it forward with as much force as he could. The vampire's mouth went slack as the knife made contact with its chest, killing him before his knees hit the ground.
Lestrade thought about this, and then pulled out his phone again. “I have tracking enabled on her work mobile,” he said. He pressed a few buttons on his own phone, adding, “God knows if it’ll work now, though.” He put the phone to his ear as it began to ring, walking away from John and Sherlock as he started speaking to one of his officers at Scotland Yard.
to talk to him. Before he could dwell on that thought further, the detective had crawled in, his long limbs entering the flat awkwardly before his head did.
“Not yet,” Sebastian replied, trying to get leverage as John hit him yet again. “You think this is the only plan we had? The only graveyard?” Sebastian was finally able to free one of his arms, and punched John in the side, pushing himself up and landing a kick in John’s ribs.
Greg sighed, but came over to the kitchen table and looked over Sherlock’s shoulder at the computer.
Passing one of the outbuildings on the far reaches of the base, John found himself nearly catching up to her several times, in spite of her advantage as a full vampire. Having recently had blood, however, John was able to catch up, and felt a primal exhilaration deep within himself as he caught up to her and her laughter faded. Feeling more strength run through him than he was even aware he had, John grabbed at her hair and threw her down. Within moments, he was on top of her, and his hands began systematically breaking every bone he could reach. Eventually, his hands wrapped around her throat, pushing up until he heard the tearing sound of brittle skin separating. As she looked at him with panic, John realized that Tom must have sincerely believed he would have let her live, and told her as much. Moments after the head of the vampire separated from her body, her remains rapidly began to decay. John felt both deeply satisfied, and deeply ashamed.
“He never found it though, right?” Greg asked, pondering the amount of overtime he would have to put in to locate a missing book of the dead.
John nodded at Mycroft, hoping he would take the hint to get back to a hotel before dawn. The man slipped the sheet of paper into his breast pocket and began walking towards the car, followed by Molly.
“I left,” he said. “Let the Council know where they could find their assets, and had them fly me out. I saw my opportunity to let that version of myself die, and took it.” After a time, he added, “I couldn’t.” He breathed out heavily, and glanced at his hands in his lap before continuing. “I couldn’t look my remaining men in the eye and still feel I was capable of leading them.”
Interrupting him, George said, “Sherlock, please, I would really rather not see our dear Doctor Watson maimed tonight, without good reason. If you must hate someone, hate me; I turned him.”
“Mycroft could belong to us, or he could belong to the other guys, right?” He waited for Sherlock to nod. “We know George turned Mycroft, but no one else does. If Mycroft were to show up at their home base, seemingly because he felt drawn to it…”
“It seems to go right over your head that this isn't a pleasant experience, Sherlock,” John said, finally looking in Sherlock's general direction.
Very quickly, Sherlock let go of the vampire's neck, and John slipped the chain over where his hand had been. The vampire hissed as the silver burned its skin, and John quickly pulled him backwards, off the table, and towards a metal pipe that ran from the ceiling to the floor. Tying the vampire to it, he stepped back, rubbing his hands on his jeans lightly. While the silver didn't burn John's hands, Sherlock noticed that his palms still looked as though they had been submerged in boiling water.
“About damn time,” John answered, and the pair headed down Holyrood Road towards the nearest cafe. John absently moved onto other topics of conversation - Sherlock’s previous trips to Scotland, brief musings on Lestrade’s progress - but the idea of the vaults persisted. Something about it nagged at him.
Against all advice John would have given him, Lestrade began to fight back against the vampires holding him. John could hear his rapidly beating heart, and assumed he was having a sudden attack of claustrophobia. Keeping him in position, one vampire twisted his left arm back until a crack could be heard; both John and Sherlock cringed away. Still, even screaming, Lestrade managed to free his right arm and landed a punch directly on the vampire in front of him. This punch was returned to him threefold, and by the time the vampire stepped away and his friends could see him, Greg hung limp and bleeding, barely able to keep his head up.
The older vampire sighed, and made a waving gesture at the man to his left. They made eye contact, and the gun was dropped to the ground.
“Aren’t you supposed to be in better shape, as a detective?” Molly asked him in between her own deep breaths.
Sherlock, to his credit, did not immediately panic. He arranged his thoughts, ordering them as he would any of the other passing ideas that floated through his mind. This was difficult, of course, given that every inch of his skin seemed to be tingling and distracting him. John let out a soft moan, finally prompting Sherlock to move back as far as he could. Extricating himself proved more of a challenge than expected; John was sound asleep, dreaming - Sherlock hoped - of more pleasant times.
When the doctor reentered the room, arms laden with granola bars, Sherlock looked up. “Some of these buildings were on the list Jane gave you. What's the connection?”
Sherlock offered a dramatic sigh, which quickly gave way to the smile that always seemed to appear whenever he was about to explain something
Now he stayed outside, chilled by the morning air, and could hear John walking around inside the flat. From the frequency of the steps and the sounds in the kitchen, Sherlock could tell John was making an effort to clean up, clearing up as much of the clutter in the sitting room as he could, in order to make room for the collection of weapons that was gradually making its way downstairs. Sherlock couldn't remember how long he had been sitting there, but realized it was enough time that he should come in shortly, or risk being frowned at by John.
“That's your warning. You get one,” John shouted to the blackness before him. A drop of dark blood fell to the pavement from the tip of one of his knives. “Leave now and I will end this peacefully.”
John opened his phone. “Nothing from the others yet. I’m surprised you haven’t asked about the papers yet.”
“The man of whom I speak, Doctor Watson, is an old acquaintance of our mother's. He seems to have found himself being blackmailed by his wife as well as his mistress. I'm sure that it would be prudent, in the interests of keeping the government running efficiently during such a crucial time in the election season, to deal with it as discreetly as possible. I would go into further detail, but this is, as I'm sure you understand, a very sensitive issue.”
“Mysteries are meant to be solved. All things have a logical end. Murderers always make an error of judgement, and reveal their cards, or reveal themselves.” He paused. “This one has not.”
Absently, John wondered why more vampires wouldn’t use guns. Sure, there was an element of pride - Earth’s most dangerous predator shouldn’t need a human weapon, and whatnot - but it still seemed like a silly cultural standard. Then again, since being made vampire, even John’s mother was reluctant to use technology of any kind to fight her battles. John’s zombie-like progression through the crowd was halted by a hand on his shoulder. He turned, gun drawn immediately, before realizing it was Jane who had grabbed him.
Keen on not dragging the ordeal out, he pushed his furniture back into place, placing his weapons unceremoniously on the top of his desk. By the time he had left the room and made it to the bottom of the stairs he looked, as expected, relatively untouched. As he entered the living room, it occured to him that he could have changed out of his clothes. At least in his present state he and the others looked equally unclean.
“Right, sorry,” he said, apologizing again, and sitting up, ignoring Sherlock's questions. “What time is it?”
“Everyone is over there,” John murmured from his armchair. “Hundreds of the world’s best vampire hunters and we have access to none of them. As far as I know, they’re about to fall into a trap.” John stood and began to walk towards the kitchen, unable to stay seated for long.
Lestrade nodded. “I should have noticed, right? I mean, I spotted a certain glazed-over look now and again, but that’s normal on a string of cases like the murders. Late nights, stress, gore - it takes a certain emotional fortitude to get you through the day, and once it’s gone, so are you.”
“Caroline!” John exclaimed, and finally made out the face of the fourth figure, who stood to George’s right. A tall, morose-looking woman, Caroline simply nodded. Undaunted, John moved forward and captured her in a hug, which she relaxed into, offering a soft smile.
Gabriel considered the meaning of John’s words, then nodded once. “I’ll have guards posted immediately, Captain.”
“What was left of it, anyways,” Jane muttered, and took one last sip of her drink. John shot her a glance that both of the Holmes brothers immediately read as a warning to the vampire. The flash of John's temper was ignored completely by both Lestrade and Molly, who were only just beginning to realize that the woman in front of them had been finishing off a bottle of blood.
Sherlock smirked as continued his slow read down the page. “Quite enjoying some of these labels. Necronomicon - Lovecraft, and Necronomicon - real, functional. Gold ring of Vlad the Impaler. Death shroud of Barnabas the Great and Fearsome - stained.”
“Yes,” John answered. “Parts of it were pieced together from various hunts, but the basic story was still there. I'm telling you this because I think it will be easier for all of you to grasp how long vampires have been living among you, and just how dangerous they are, if you have a basic understanding of how they operate.”
John’s posture remained tense until he sensed all three bodies had exited the building. As soon as the door was shut, John sat back down into his chair and exhaled, the fight going out of him. He closed his eyes and groaned.
“About two hours before dawn on what was supposed to be a normal day, my mum was attacked as she came home from a staff party that ran late. My dad couldn't protect her, not in the second it took for the vampire to drag her down the road and out of sight. By the time my dad found her, she was nearly gone, but the vampire had waited for him to come. He stayed crouched above her until my dad could see his smile, and then he was gone. And my dad knew. The turning process had started, and that was the vampire's plan – to make the wife of one of the most feared hunters a vampire herself, leaving it just long enough that if my father tried to undo it, she would die. As these things happen, in her last spasms of life she had started to give birth to me, and just after dawn broke, she died, and I arrived.”
“What do you mean 'why'?” John replied, swinging his legs around the couch, feeling the last remains of drowsiness run from him.
There was a silence between them for a moment, and only the sound of John shuffling papers around could be heard. John looked at the photographs below him, and decided on an answer that Sherlock may understand.
“Half the battle is looking prepared,” John answered, pushing the door open with his shoulder as he pulled on a pair of gloves. “Your government influence – how fast could it get us a cab?”
“My humour is wasted on you,” Sherlock said, turning back to his work as John moved towards the other side of the table, picking up a file and unclipping a map from where it had been tacked on to a wall. “What are you doing?”
“Coordinates, and the timetable for a bus,” he answered happily, pointing at various numbers on the pages.
John checked the time on his blood-spattered phone. “Tomorrow. All of us are going to need to get as much sleep as we can get. It could be our last chance for a while.”
Sebastian smirked, and Moriarty seemed just as pleased. John was immediately glad he and Sherlock had discussed this on the train ride over - both knew Moriarty’s book wasn’t genuine, but continued to play along.
Charles, the human companion of the vampires who had escorted her to the library, was eager to inform her that he was part of a group of peacekeepers. He seemed sympathetic to the fact that most of the vampires she had met up until that point had tried to kill her, and hoped that it hadn’t prejudiced her against vampires too much. Although she had inferred as much from John, Charles had clearly stated that he was part of the British branch of the Vampire Council, which oversaw the activities of immortals throughout the world. As he brought her to the library, he detailed everything that John hadn’t, particularly the role his father played as head of the Council. Apparently, her friend’s involvement in vampire politics had begun in childhood.
“You seem unusually disturbed,” he said. “This is the kind of behaviour you reserve for serial kidnappings and dead children.”
Mycroft raised a hand, and John stopped speaking. “I realize your request to avoid interrupting was given so recently, but are you speaking about the characters of
“I’m fine too. I think we’re ready.” She shifted the laptop bag at her side, which was rubbing against the gun and holster John had given her.
John laughed in surprise. “Christ, I haven’t seen you in ages. How are you? Is that you, Charlie?” He squinted at another man about his height, who was leaning into the far corner of the room.
John breathed out heavily with something akin to amusement. “More like, they’re going to get hypnotized into filing this case away quickly. The press will get a general answer of ‘vagrant minors, names cannot be released.’ Families of the victims will get the same answer, with the added benefit of one of the Council’s vampire agents hypnotizing them into accepting what happened. The only people getting the short end of the stick will be you and the rest of the Met, who won’t get much in the way of an explanation from anyone.”
“Oh, god,” Sherlock moaned, rolling his eyes and falling back into his chair. He crossed his legs at the ankle and stared at John. “You can't be trusted with sweaters.”
“It’s not fine,” John said, voice choked. Softly, so gently John barely noticed, he felt Sherlock’s hand tenderly graze the back of his neck. Then, the hand fell, and Sherlock’s eyes, still locked on John’s, lost their light. His face relaxed, and John ran a hand along the consulting detective’s jaw. “Sherlock?”
John tensed, his rigid hands and his obviously forced smile the only parts of him that belied his annoyance. “That's really not necessary Sherlock. You and Lestrade were busy doing something here, I'm sure.”
“I've seen plenty of dead bodies,” she said firmly, straightening up instinctively. “Death doesn't bother me. It's the violence – the fact you want me to believe that I was just attacked by a
“Fine, we’re all fine,” the DI answered. “Quick question – how fast can you get back to Baker Street?”
“That's all,” Mycroft answered, gaze lingering on John's neck before he looked away again. “That's all I remember.”
Sherlock nodded. “After you panicked in Baskerville, it seemed remiss for me not to.” With reluctance, he removed his arms from John’s shoulders.
“Are we doing this hotter-colder style, or more like Marco Polo?” John asked, trying to get his bearings. He knew the city well, but not quite as well as London.
“I’ll do what I can,” Greg replied, nodding. “It’s hard to tell them I’m expecting another attack without getting them suspicious. Do you want me to have them back you up, when the time comes?”
John glanced around and shook his head; this one wasn’t a trap. He leaned closer and pressed his ear to the door; with the addition of fresh blood to his body, John’s senses were heightened. Even so, he heard nothing. He pulled back and straightened his shoulders, getting himself into a neutral, solid position. He drew one of his long, sharp daggers, and his companions drew their guns. Sherlock turned off his torch and slipped it back in his coat. “Ahead,” John said, turning his head slightly. Carefully, he pulled open the door.
Backing away from her, John looked at Greg. “How are you? Where’s Molly? Mycroft?” He brought the reunion with his old friends to a close as more pressing matters came to mind.
Apparently finished asking questions, John didn't hear another word from Sherlock for the next half hour, and returned to the kitchen  to drop off his mug in the sink.
Composed, John stood. He had lived this once before. Still stuck in slow motion, he felt himself reach down and pick up the stake he had killed Moriarty with, and slip it into his belt. Then, he walked across the vault, calmly heaving angry vampires out of his way. By the time he reached Sebastian and Arturo, most of the soldiers present realized what was happening and gave him a wide berth. With a quick glance behind him, Arturo stepped away and let John take his place.
George spoke softly to John, and although neither Sherlock nor Lestrade heard what he said, they gathered it was something dismissive.
“Sarah Daniels, twenty-five,” Lestrade said, looking down at the tarp, which Sherlock was currently circling around, analyzing the surrounding area and making his initial observations. “She worked as a secretary at the Bank of England, and her flatmate reported her missing when she didn't come home after work last night.”
Sherlock glanced up from the screen, and pursed his lips. John’s face fell, the anger giving way to worry.
“Am I? Odd.” The DI didn’t even notice the wrong name being used.  “About damn time,” he added, barely audible.
“Okay,” Molly said, crossing her arms and nodding, her eyebrows meeting as she glanced at her shoes. She was expecting more of a fight.
On touching the door itself, however, John immediately stepped back as though slapped. It was like he had landed directly back in that war, and for a moment his senses were assaulted by choking black ash, the smell of his wife’s perfume, and a sense of dread. More than a flashback, the entrance was lined with a sensory tripwire. All at once, the gravity of what John was doing hit him - he was rusty, had minimal backup and, worst of all, was putting his best friends in almost certain danger.
“I was married,” John said in the silence. Regardless of how hard he had tried to forget, he remembered. “That’s where I should start.”
Sherlock detected the faintest hint of uncertainty in his friend’s voice, and then it disappeared. Both Lestrade and himself seemed to understand that this was the first time John had willingly chosen to disregard the wishes of an ancient vampire.
“They're good places to turn humans,” John replied, dumping the food on the desk beside Sherlock's laptop. “Quiet, isolated. None are that good of a location to keep a bunch of vampires, though. Still haven't figured that part out,” he said, trailing off.
The car stopped at an intersection and the pale red light illuminated John's face while he spoke. “These deaths are the sign of a greater problem; the tip of the iceberg. Vampires don't just kill humans for the hell of it anymore,  that's not strictly how they operate these days. They either turn them, or drink from them and leave them alive. It's a survival tactic. You attract less attention to yourself if you aren't murdering your source of food each night.” He looked pointedly at Mycroft.
“Right now...” John surveyed the maps in front of him, and the guns on the table. Everything was in order, and there wasn't much he could do until nightfall. “Nothing, I guess. Rest a bit, maybe.”
With the sirens, John knew an alert had also been sent to the Council. Somewhere, he imagined, his father was preparing to mobilize the next closest army base to serve as backup. John walked towards the large windows that lined two full walls of the room, and tried to put his plans in order. He would have to pull some weapons for himself out of the gun safe in the room across the hall -  that was easy. Next, he would have to triage the battle outside. At present, freeing up the main armory building was his top concern, but if the tide turned he would take over general battle governance. Unless, of course, he could locate Sebastian, who as his second-in-command would shoulder some of his work. Watching as groups moved into position, as trained, John finalized his battle plans.
“Well, I -” He looked to John for help. John found himself suddenly fascinated by the floor tiles. “New body and all, I didn't really have time to call...”
“I guess I do,” John said, and sat on the edge of his bed, facing Sherlock. “You may not like it. Or you will. I don't know. I'm not to keen on the idea, but...”
Sherlock glanced over the figures, who were now illuminated by candlelight, and rolled his eyes. “Of course.”
Before John could speak, Sherlock interrupted. “If we're under attack by vampires, we have until dusk to collect ourselves and plan our strategy for retaliation.”He put a hand behind his head as he leaned back on his chair, and waved with the other hand, adding, “or so I imagine.”
"Mr. Holmes, at the very least, you should call me by my proper surname when we're in public. Everyone else does." Jane murmured, taking the glass and downing half of its contents.
"You use my own foolish words against me?" Sherlock questioned, smiling tenderly. "It may be an abstract social construct, but it doesn't change the fact that it's how I feel about you. I could hardly take my eyes off of you when you danced, surely you noticed?"
"Sherlock?" he murmured quietly, trying not to startle her. It didn't work because she looked up with this surprised, doe-eyed horror on her face, looking like she was about to bolt. "Sorry... I didn't mean to surprise you."
"...Fine... I'll humor you just this once, but at the first sign of any trouble from you, I'm running." Jane warned.
"I will lead." Sherlock assured, offering his arm to her. "The only one likely to judge you for it will be Mycroft and it's been a while since I watched my mother try to beat him with a shoe. It could prove to be fun." Jane reluctantly took Sherlock's arm and followed as he lead her to the ballroom. His touches were light as he gently guided her into the starting stance. Musicians scrambled in through a side door and started to play.
"I'm sure she would enjoy that. I doubt you could, but please don't try to intimidate her. She had a very trying day today."
"With your permission, I would like to approach my parents about our marriage." He suggested hesitantly.
"Thank you, sir. Have a very pleasant day, and I will see you tomorrow, hopefully under better conditions." Jane murmured, making her way back inside and after stripping off her dress and returning to her nightgown, she climbed into bed and slept some more.
They kissed and tugged at each other's clothing until they were both bare, skin pressed against skin. Jane broke the kiss, panting softly as she looked up at him. A smirk appeared on her lips and she rolled them over so Sherlock was on his back with her sitting on top of his thighs. He seemed surprised for a moment but he chuckled, hands sliding up her body to cup her breasts.
“Go. I’ll be more than fine to mingle alone for a few minutes,” she assured with a chuckle and Sherlock gave her cheek a tender kiss before he followed Ms. Adler to a different part of the room.
"I'll have to remember to say things like this to you more often. You're so... what I can only describe as 'wet' down there."
"Not in the slightest." she confirmed and his blush only grew. "But you know she's more likely to notice you if you go and talk to her yourself, right?"
“What?!” Irene raised her voice, giving Sherlock’s arm a harsh squeeze before regaining her composure. “I must apologize, it appears my fiancee has had too much to drink. He’s such a joker when he’s drunk.”
"I apologize... I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable..." Sherlock mumbled shyly, averting his eyes much like a kid who got caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
"I'm going to need some lavender and some cool water." Jane said weakly. Mary, sprung into action, starting to gather cool water and lavender from around the kitchen.
"Mycroft will pull through, the physicians say. Though it will take a miracle for him to keep his leg." He answered sighing softly. "Virginia spends all day fussing over him. I think it's her way of coping with it all."
Most nights, assuming he wasn't too tired, Sherlock would pepper kisses over his wife's shoulders as he held her to him. Jane would offer lazy smiles, occasionally pulling her husband in for a long, tender kiss.
"It's sure to be soon. I doubt your future husband could stand to be away from you long." Molly teased, a smirk playing on her lips.
"So that's what you mean by committed?" Jane questioned and Moriarty blushed brightly. "He looked sort of familiar..."
"Mother, father, may I come in? I have something rather urgent I would like to speak with you about." He cleared his throat, hearing his voice an octave higher than usual due to his nervousness.
"Well, now I know for certain it's a lie." Sherlock stated, and she reached over and pinched his side. "Ow. What was that for?"
It had been nearly two and a half months since the night that Sherlock and Jane had first had sex, and though it had become a surprisingly regular thing Jane couldn't find a single complaint in the matter. She had practically moved into Sherlock's room now and while he would often leave the house during the day, it seemed he couldn't stay away for long because he was always home sometime before, during, or after dinner. Reignited were the happy hobbies of reading together, and Sherlock would always try to share at least one meal a day with her. The world simply felt brighter... Even Moriarty seemed to have a spring in his step....
"There is one thing that you could do. Follow me," he suggested, making his way back up the stairs. Jane followed him as told but halted when he reached the door to his bedroom.
"I've been a little occupied helping my friend, Jane Watson, settle into town. She's living with me, though finances have become a burden." Mary turned her attention to Jane, looking her over with a friendly smile. She offered a hand to shake Jane's before turning back to Molly.
What had he done? He could hardly believe he had lied to Moriarty about something as serious as an engagement, let alone his own. Jane was a headstrong woman and he very much doubted that she would be forgiving of his fib. Jane was admittedly the closest thing he had ever had to a friend outside of his sister and he had probably just lost her due to an instinctive lie to protect her honor.
Sherlock nodded dutifully, his eyes filling with worry. He carefully picked Mrs. Hudson up and took her to the parlor, resting her on the sofa.
“Wait! I can prove it if you just give me the chance!” Jane called, reaching for him despite him being on the complete other side of the room.
"Good morning, Mr. Holmes." Jane said politely. "Yes, it was very refreshing. Thank you for asking." Sherlock simply smirked and turned a page in the book. It was then that she noticed her employer sitting in the armchair across from the silently gloating Mr. Holmes.
"Yes, I can tell you're going to be so much help." The man stated haughtily in a monotone voice, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms. "There's no way you can help me get back to civilization and it's going to take you ages to get back here with someone who could."
"I... am not even sure how to respond to that. You do realize how incredibly lucky you are that there's anyone out here at all?"
"Oh, great. A woman. Not exactly what I was hoping for in a rescuer." The man stated with a disappointed tone.
"How do I look?" she questioned, giving Moriarty a twirl to show off the dress. It was lilac with creme lace. He nodded his approval.
"Not at all, Wolfguard. I'm only too happy to help. I know we didn't plan on introducing the two of them this early, but I can be flexible, especially in light of what has happened." Amanda assured before softening. "How is Virginia?"
The speculation of what went on in this mystical land was far more specific than the vague circumstances of the disappearances. If the person was beautiful, it was likely, to any superstitious dolt, that the fairies snatched the person up with the intention that they service the Fairy King. If they were clever, the locals speculated that they were taken before the Fairy King and challenged to some sort of game of wits. Should the missing person have no redeeming qualities, it was assumed that they must’ve been a tasty feast for the fairies. No matter the person, the fairies of the locals’ imaginations were a group of prats set on the humiliation and suffering of any poor git that ended up as nothing more than a whisper on the wind, a bone-chilling reminder of who they had been and little else.
"It's just after four in the morning." The response he got was another groan. "I suppose I could find another lady to accompany me. Perhaps Ms. Morstan? Oh, or maybe little Ms. Lestrade would be intrigued enough."
"I suppose that could be another word to describe the enigma that is you, Ms. Watson." Affection actually reached his eyes and he straightened out his jacket as he stood. "Please stay in my room for the night. I can sleep in the foyer in an armchair."
"Yeah, but I really don't want Sherlock seeing the base." John muttered, glancing behind him at the zone-out girl.
"I still don't understand... How is Sherlock involved in this? As far as I know, he wants as little to do with me as possible. And this building looks like it's been here a little while." Jane's eyebrows continued to knit together as she looked through the cabinets and drawers and found them neatly stocked with bandages and anything a doctor or surgeon would require from this century.
"Oh, yes. The most wonderful of things!" Molly burst into an almost blinding smile, grabbing Jane's hands and giving them an excited squeeze. "I am engaged!"
"I'd say something changed between you both last night." she said knowingly, starting to pick up and neatly fold the clothes as if acknowledging the presence of the articles cut off any chance Jane had of denying anything.
"Well, I've never seen you so convicted about anything. That Sherlock must be a special guy." John nodded in agreement.
"I suppose I might as well tell you... I wouldn't be fair to keep you in the dark forever... Especially since I plan on trying to go back in a little less than two years."
“I can't say I've ever heard of such a thing, Ms. Watson. The contraption does interest me though. You must tell me more of it at dinner.”
"I didn't say that. I just don't feel particularly productive, and, well, I am a maid." Sherlock set the book down and stared at her with his intense eyes that seemed to shine a thousand different colors. She bit her lip and she gained the courage to continue. "I would invite you to join me in the kitchen but Moriarty can't be bothered to go in there. I doubt you would feel any differently on the subject."
"That's awful. I can't imagine being so sickly that she can't even live like a normal child." Jane admitted, frown only growing.
There were buildings but he didn't recognize them. They looked much newer than they had when he had arrived two nights before, but he supposed that could've easily been his mind playing tricks on him. Still, there seemed to be fewer buildings than he remembered. He shrugged off the confusion with a wave of indifference, trudging down the hill and looking for his gun. After about an hour of searching without any luck, he gave up looking for it. He certainly wasn't about to waste the rest of his short life raking his fingers through dried leaves to find the piece.
"Just this once because I'm in such a great mood myself." Molly agreed, setting the clothes in the laundry basket. Jane raised an eyebrow.
"Can we talk about how shit of a brother I am in the car?" John asked, rolling his eyes and sighing.
"Okay, Joh-" She saw him start to flinch again and paused "... Jane." Harry wrapped her arms around him and hugged him. "Does that make you my sister now?"
After breakfast, Jane went on her way to the forest, resuming her mission of finding that holly tree. Luck, it seemed, was not on her side. She really should’ve paid better attention to the surrounding landscape.
“Ms. Watson…” she greeted through gritted teeth. “How kind of you to come. And wearing my dress for the evening, no less.”
"Um... This is Mr. Sebastian Moran... The man I have chosen as my partner of sorts..." Moriarty gestured to the man. He gave a small bow.
tree. She was certain of it. The tree she had tried to take her life in front of all those months ago. It looked younger now but there was no mistaking it. She would've leapt with joy for finally finding it again had it not been for the fact that her thoughts were interrupted by the sharp, scathing tone of the man who had inadvertently led her here.
"No! He's far from being my type." she shuddered at the thought. Jane had experimented with her sexuality during her old life at uni as John Watson with mixed results. She wasn't opposed to dating men, exactly, but it certainly wasn't an experience she'd go out of her way to repeat again, new genitalia or no.
Finally, they made it to the marketplace. Jane was expecting that Sherlock was going to browse one of the shops or stalls but instead he merely sat on a bench and watched people as they went by. Jane found it peculiar and she sat down next to him, watching the people for a few minutes before her curiosity became too much for her to bare.
"Virginia, dearest, let the man speak. He can't very well explain himself if you don't let him. We all know you worry for him, but he did come with the intention of speaking with us about something he deems important." Mr. Holmes interrupted, looking at his wife with a gleam of amusement in his eyes.
"Sherlock, you can relax." she promised, but Sherlock's shoulders only relaxed slightly. "You're acting like you're not allowed in my bed."
"I doubt you will.” Jane said with a short chuckle. “Thanks, Holmes, for doing this for me. And for checking up on me."
The door opened and Jane looked up from her sewing to find Molly walking in with Mr. Lestrade at her heels. Jane set aside her busywork and stood, smiling.
Jane realized she had no idea what sort of work the man did. The thought had crossed her mind that he was cheating on her, but he didn't seem the type. And even though they were married, Jane didn't really feel she had a claim on Sherlock in any way. They were friends, well, sort of. One has to see a person regularly to maintain a friendship. So perhaps acquaintances on good terms was more accurate.
"Would you consider that a form of opening up? Think what you will but you both learned new things about one another at that party."
"I don't see you getting any other options. And if it helps, I'm... committed, now. You'll get no trouble from me."
"I have spent the duration of the last week with you and Ms. Watson in the kitchen. It would be a shame if I hadn't paid attention." Sherlock said rather dismissively. He glanced back at the door. "May I see her?"
"God willing." He knew that she was inquiring about his ability to return to her home, but his hopes were all too focused on returning to his own time. Maybe with some luck he could reverse whatever this was.
"Traumatic?" he asked, eyebrows arching in curiosity. Amanda brought her hand to her chin as she thought a moment about how best to explain this concept to a seven year old. John was a little young to know about these things... but then again, Sherlock was unfortunately terribly young to experience them.
Abruptly they stopped a moment and it left Jane feeling like she were on a steep cliff, hanging off by the last note. The third woman sang finally, her own set of notes and then the other ladies joined in with their notes again. It sounded more like an argument now, but every once in a while the notes would find their way into harmony before shooting back out into a conflicting discord and chaotic but beautiful nature. Once again they stopped but silence didn't follow. Instead, the sound of a violin sprung the song to life and any stragglers on the dance floor were now fully engaged and Jane had finally managed to find her own groove as the first singer began the first verse of the song.
"I don't know about silly. Just... I believe that everything in myth is based off of some sort of truth." He admitted, though he hadn't always felt that way. But he had changed a lot in the last year and a half. The ranger snorted.
Once he'd pulled the layers of satin and lace off of her, his hands began immediate work on the lace of her bodice, but he kept her close as if he couldn't stand the thought of being more than a few inches away from her. His lips and tongue roamed the entirety of her neck and shoulders as the strings of her stay loosened. As was his custom for the night, he threw whatever fabric he could get off of her on the floor. She pulled off his waistcoat, and it joined her dress.
"Yes, that suits me very much. Thank you, Ms. Morstan." Jane agreed, actually excited at the prospect of being useful. "Thank you so much for your assistance."
Part of the reason that it took me so long to pump out this last chapter is due to the fact that BlanchLemur asked me if she could translate my story into her native language, an exceptionally flattering honor I never expected. I wanted to proofread as much of my fic as possible so that she would have a smoother time translating it. It took me quite a while to proofread everything, tweaking parts I was unsatisfied with in the process. But it took even longer when my computer gave out officially in November. Before that, I had thought it had died in June.
“Did you know that Ms. Adler was going to wear the dress I’m wearing this evening?” Jane asked with a raised brow. She could tell by his expression that he did not.
"The burns hurt?" Sherlock asked, obviously concerned. It was funny, actually. Jane couldn't recall a time that she had seen Sherlock concerned about anything.
"Well, I'm sure as hell not marrying Moriarty." Jane assured, gently rubbing Sherlock's shoulder, far from the wound. "We'll talk about it more after we put you back together."
He hadn't expected that level of maturity from her, even if she was his older sister. Perhaps it was foolish, but for a moment, he believed she might listen to his request, even if it was strange, and maybe she'd even respect it.
She gave a pleased hum, gently removing his hands and settling between his legs. He watched her curiously, propping himself up on his elbows. She turned her attention to his member, gently guiding it to her mouth. Her tongue swept over the head of his cock, causing Sherlock to gasp and throw his head back. She licked stripes up and down his shaft before enveloping her lips around him and bobbing her head.
One day during the week, Sherlock did something unexpected and asked Jane to accompany him to the village market. She had to pick her jaw up off the floor.
Mrs. Hudson nodded, relaxing on the sofa. Jane turned to look at Sherlock with a nervous expression.
"Aren't you?" he wondered, and she could see in his eyes that it was something he had been genuinely concerned about.
When she woke again, the sun was high but making its downward descent. It must've been around two o'clock. She threw on her dressing gown and made her way downstairs once more to find Moriarty in her sitting room.
"Well, it is Christmas." John stated, taking the mug and then a careful sip before setting it on a shelf in the tub.
Jane waited down in the foyer, processing the scene she had accidentally happened upon. Jim came down after about twenty minutes in fresh clothes with a bashful look on his face.
“Don’t say that!” John snapped, guiding Bill’s already weakening arms to the wound on his leg. “Apply pressure to the wound. I’m going to make a tourniquet and get you to the med tent.” He fumbled with his belt as Bill tried his best to do what John had ordered him to do.
John let out a yelp, shaking the little five year old girl off of him and then running off to find his mother with tears in his eyes.
"Jane..." He blinked, digging his nails into his other fist as if to assure himself this wasn't a dream.
They had just been hiking a hill and, although Jane could see better now that night was nearly over and the sun was about to rise, she wasn't quite sure where they were.
"Is that what I am? A puzzle? For a moment there I thought I was a human being but I suppose that was just wishful thinking." Jane replied sarcastically, rolling her eyes. She sighed, shaking her head. "Is there anything I can get for you, Holmes?"
It was purple with gold trim, and Jane speculated that it was the nicest dress she’d ever worn to date. The skirt was flowy and elegant, and though it was a had a higher collar than was usually customary, it still looked more sensual than modest. The ends of the sleeves rested just below her elbows and she took a deep breath as she walked out to get Moriarty’s opinion.
"He couldn't take his eyes off of you. He spent the duration of the party watching you, no one could get him to hold a conversation." Jim stated, amused. "In the meantime, I will see about getting you a career you can be happy with."
"That's true. I haven't heard of him attending a single party that his mother didn't insist he go to." Mary mused. "Still, I hope for your sake, he'll attend. If not, he'll certainly hear about how you stole the attention of everyone present at the party."
Sherlock was laying on the cold, stone floor outside what had been Wolfguard's room during his stay. It was so rare for him to hear her voice that he didn't even realize that it was her until he spotted her there. She was curled around a pillow, tears streaming down her pale cheeks, and John actually felt bad for her. She must've missed her dad, he figured. He knew that if his mother had left him in a strange place by himself, he'd probably be in a similar state. He hesitated a moment, trying to decide if he should just close the door and try and go back to sleep... but something told him it would be a long time before Sherlock stopped crying, and also that it wouldn't be very nice to ignore someone in such a state of distress.
Months had passed, too many and the pain of missing Sherlock never dimmed, and Harry could tell that whatever he'd endured, it had changed him a lot. John rarely showered, opting instead to maintain twenty-first century hygiene by bathing... Which was admittedly unfortunate for Harry because the flat only had one bathroom. But boundaries diminished a little bit after Harry had to seriously pee one time and John let her in while he continued his bath.
With another disapproving shake of his head, John wiped any stray butter from his lips with a napkin. He shoved his hand into his pocket, pulled out a couple pounds, and left them near his empty plate to pay for the meal before limping his way out onto the street.
"Holmes, are you alright? I thought you when you asked me to mediate this duel that you were confident in your victory." The man murmured, coming up to the two of them with a concerned frown.
"It's not like that." Jane defended, playfully pushing Molly's face away. "You are never going to let me live this down, are you?"
"Get off of me." she said sternly, pushing at his chest. Moriarty persisted, pushing rougher against her and grabbing her arse. She let out a yelp and brought her knee up to his groin, pushing him away harder this time. "I do believe, Mr. Moriarty, that I said to get off of me."
"What are you doing now?!" He asked in alarm, trying his best to shy away from her with little success on only two limbs.
"You've obviously got something you want to say." Sherlock muttered, still not looking up from his pages.
It must've been quite a few hours before his return because when he left the shelter of leaves the sun had started it's descent in the sky. He found Molly's house with little trouble; there weren't that many buildings, after all. Once he was inside he found Molly by the fireside, cooking a stew, she turned to look at Jane with a pleasant smile.
He simply wasn’t marriage material. No woman wanted a broken man. Beyond that, one’s health could hardly be considered good when one is contemplating swallowing a bullet within the next twenty-four hours. And while suicide is most certainly a drastic life changing experience, John speculated that wasn’t quite what she had meant.
"Their wedding was just so... them. And while ours was not an accurate depiction of either of us, it doesn't make it any less special." she admitted, glancing over her shoulder to look at him. She had been laying on her stomach with her book laid out on the covers at the foot of the bed while he leaned against the headboard on a pile of pillows. At her comment, he set his own book down on the bedside table, shifting to climb out from under the blankets.
"Yeah. I think it is." Jane mused, pulling him against her lips again. He kissed back fervently, fingers setting on the quest to unlace her bodice. Despite the fact that her stay was getting looser, it felt like it was getting harder and harder for her to breathe. She found herself giving in to the sensations Holmes was pouring over her generously. She'd been with men before in uni as John Watson, but it had never felt like this. She wasn't sure what this was, but she'd never felt anything like it with anyone.
With that, he was gone, once again leaving Jane alone. She spent the day reading but it only reminded her of when she used to read with Sherlock. It was a week since Moriarty had visited her when she finally heard a knock on her door and found Jim outside, looking rather pleased with himself.
The ride passed quickly enough, and soon Jane found herself standing outside a building she did not recognize. It was newer than the surrounding buildings, but a decent amount of foliage had grown around it. It caused her a great deal of confusion.
Somehow, some sort of magic had brought him to this time. His head was spinning as he combed over every strange occurrence in the last day. The man at the inn’s ranting about fairies and blue moons… Obviously it hadn’t been entirely correct, there weren’t any fairies that had whisked him away unless Molly was hiding a pair of wings under her dress, and if her undergarments were anything like the ones she had put on him, he seriously doubted she could hide anything under there.
She forced herself to ignore the nervousness welling up inside her and relaxed, letting out a pleased hum when Sherlock added another finger.
And with that the man trapped in a woman's body departed, finding traversing the quaint village much easier now that he was actually dressed and people weren't staring at him, though the attire was foreign to him in every way. He made his way back through the forest, finding it a bit harder to find the mysterious holly tree now that there were leaves on all of the other trees. There were plenty of hills and he wasn't sure which one had perched the tree that he had leaned on and he hadn't paid attention to what the leaves looked like. Not that he could've predicted his situation, but he was now mentally kicking himself for not paying better attention to his surroundings.
"A Christmas party?" It was Jane's turn to be shocked. She wasn't sure why she was so shocked. Perhaps it was due to the fact that she hadn't really thought Christmas was something that people celebrated in this time period.
"I'm sorry... I didn't mean to soak your shirt in tears..." she apologized, wiping away her tears and taking a shaky breath.
Jane was silent for a moment as she thought through the situation. Sherlock did look genuinely sorry for the lie he had told Moriarty. It wasn't like he did it with bad intentions; he had being trying to defend her honor, however misguided he had been in going about it.
Chapter Warning: Sexual Harassment. If you're easily bothered by it, please skip to the spot past the horizontal line.
"Huh. Who would've thought Sherlock Holmes would care about my honor and my well being." Jane murmured thoughtfully, scooting over and patting the spot on the bed beside her. Sherlock sheepishly took off his shoes and climbed under the covers with her, laying as close to the edge as he could to give her plenty of space.
Molly and Lestrade would certainly have room, but they'd also probably side with Sherlock since he was Lestrade's friend and Jane was the one who disappeared for two years. Ms. Morstan wasn't an option either since she lived with her parents still, assuming she hadn't gotten married at this point.
John knew it was a distraction from his protests with sleeping next to her but he still did as Molly suggested, stripping himself of the drab, brown overdress so she could loosen the laces.
"It's to keep you safe from men like Moriarty." Sherlock murmured blankly. Jane felt her blood boil a bit at that and stood abruptly, turning on heel to head back to the part. Sherlock got up quickly and gently grabbed for her wrist.
They ate in a slightly strained silence, Molly probably trying to piece together the stranger she let into her home and John too focused on his otherworldly situation to pay her much mind. It had been quite possibly the most flavorful stew he’d had in his life and yet every part of him felt too numb to possibly enjoy it.
"Ms. Watson... I don't know what to say... I suppose an expression of my gratitude for seeing me as such an honorable man is in order. Thank you. I will try to be worthy of that vision. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask."
"Just follow my lead, Jane, you'll do fine. It looks like the singers are going to warm up first any how. We'll figure it out together during that." Jane took in a sharp inhale, holding her breath.
The chorus continued on and Jane found herself swirling around with Mr. Lestrade this time, who gave a nod and smile in greeting and in an instant, she was back to skipping and kicking around the same spot. Violin sudden picked up and Jane found herself dancing with the most unpleasant of acquaintances, Moriarty.
"Ms. Watson, this is Mr. Gregory Lestrade." Sherlock murmured faintly, nearly falling over. Jane caught him, cupping his cheek and making him look at her.
Jane sprung into action, her medical instincts kicking in instantly. The first thing she needed to do was get Mrs. Hudson laying on her side and comfortable.
His eyes searched the immediate area and saw that a large holly tree stood in the middle of the hill with its branches stretching out towards the skies proudly. It was autumn so many of the trees had shed their brightly colored leaves in favor of a grimmer look, and yet, this tree stood with all of its bright green leaves like it was a warm summer’s day. It was as if it were defying nature itself.
"Oh. The Huntington Case..." Sherlock carefully pulled out of her, pressing a kiss to her forehead in return as he started to throw clothes on and comb his hair. "Thank you for reminding me."
"Not at all, I mean every word, but you can't blame me for enjoying the reaction they give me." Sherlock mused, licking and gently nipping at the skin on her neck as he added a second finger inside her and started thrusting them in and out of her.
"He's been a perfect gentleman, actually," Jane admitted, slowly looking at him. Well, as much of a gentleman as he was capable of being. Sherlock seemed more vulnerable than before, possibly even drunk.
The ranger continued to talk and ask him questions but John kept his answers to a maximum of seven syllables, not willing to share his experiences with the man. They arrived at the Ranger Office and the man went into the back and gave John some clothes. John went into the small restroom and changed. Staring at his reflection made reality sink in, but the only thing that comforted him was the fact that he had been missing and it wasn't all a dream. The tattered remains of his dress assured that. He stepped out of the bathroom, feeling utterly depressed and out of place. And he was definitely having an identity crisis.
"What makes you think he wants me in his life? He's got a fiancee, I'm certainly not going to ruin that for him." Jane stated flatly.
And that was how the next few days went down. John and Mike would go off and do something, Sherlock would follow at the insistence of Queen Amanda, and then she'd just sit there and stare at nothing while John and Mike did their very best to pretend that the gloomy raincloud of a girl wasn't actually there.
She had asked Mrs. Hudson's advice on what to get everybody since she had been with them the longest out of all of the servants in her house. Jane had been surprised to learn that umbrellas had been a thing in England for almost thirty years and the gift she had been suggested for Mycroft was that. It was nothing like the ones that Jane was used to, this umbrella felt fragile to her. The rods that held it up and together were made of wood and the fabric didn't seem like it would keep the rain out for too terribly long but it had to be better than nothing. It was black in color and it seemed to be very stoic, something that suited him well. He didn't show much of a reaction at first but Jane could see how his eyes lit up when he discovered his gift.
"And you have a less than fortunate one." and with that Jane left the store, heading in the direction of a dress shop across the street.
All of those who want to hear the song that Moriarty sings, here it is, though it doesn't sound anything like the cacophany of noise I describe below, Leck mich im Arsch by Mozart:
“You do realize he’s getting married to that harpy next week, don’t you? You’re running out of time, Jane. If you’re going to do this, you’re going to have to do it soon. I don’t imagine he’d consummate the marriage right away, if at all, but a divorce would leave a stain on his family’s name. I very much doubt his mother would be too pleased with that.”
"Sh-Sherlock!" she could only manage to say his name. They had been fairly predictable for the time period with their sex so far; missionary only. Hell, him eating her out had been a pleasant surprise, but her legs being draped over his shoulders brought on a new angle that made him deeper than usual.
"Ms. Adler, this is Doctor Watson." Sherlock introduced, standing stiffly. "Doctor Watson, this is my fiancee, Ms. Irene Alder."
"Well, I am going to be hosting a party. I'll convince Sherlock to attend and then you can attempt to woo him with your feminine wiles. It would also be an ideal time to make a comeback into society."
The wedding was simple, as was the norm for the time. It took place after the morning session of church and it was in attendance by all of the regular church goers, and consequently, all of Jane's friends. Mary was wearing an all-knowing smirk for most of the ceremony, sitting next to Molly and occasionally squeezing the brunette's hand to support her. Molly was crying. In the six months that she had come to know Jane, Jane had not only become her friend but the sister she never had.
The walk was spent with occasional kisses and giggles. The moment they were upon the door, he kissed her hungrily, pressing her against it with a small moan of her name. She let out a gasp, clinging to him. She carefully wriggled the door handle and let him inside. He swept her up in his arms and carried her upstairs with a giddy grin. The moment he was in her room, he carefully rested her on the bed, lips seeking out hers once more for a passionate kiss.
"She died in childbirth, then?" Jane inferred, raising an eyebrow as she learned more about the man she had come to see at her door so frequently.
"I'm losing my mind, Holmes. I've read half the books in your library twice by now and if I have to read them a third time, you might come home to me throwing them at you." Jane stated matter-of-factly.
"A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Ms. Adler." she offered her hand to shake. "You're a very fortunate woman, indeed."
Once he had her completely undressed, he simply looked at her with awe subtly shimmering in his eyes. Sherlock shook himself out of his trance and started removing the rest of his clothes, laying by her side and kissing her tenderly. Tentatively, his fingers found their way between her legs and he very gently pressed one inside her. Jane's breath hitched as she got used to the unfamiliar sensation, it wasn't unpleasant, not at all, just... new, like the rest of this aspect of their relationship.
"Um... without your help, this will be the third." Sherlock admitted, fiddling with his hands. Jane realized he'd been doing it the entire conversation and had only now noticed. He never really played about with his hands when they spent that first week together. It was a strange thing to pick up on, but it just felt... off.
"I... may have told her that girls aren't allowed in my secret base..." John admitted with a soft sigh.
"I think I would be much happier to be out of that situation if that were the case." John sighed, taking a swig of a beer that Harry had left him fifteen minutes ago.
“I wouldn’t normally say this, but the ‘fun version,’ please.” He requested and the woman nodded, holding out her hands.
"It would be a little silly if I didn't know my husband's full name." she mused, sliding her fingers into his curls and gently stroking his scalp. He let out a sound akin to a purr and it made her giggle.
"I'd be delighted." she agreed. Harriet smirked, wandering off to enjoy other delights that the evening had to offer.
"Was that so hard?" She asked with a smirk, sauntering back to Sherlock and kneeling down to examine the swollen ankle. "Lemme guess. You stumbled among the roots of the tree?"
She closed her eyes and kissed him tenderly and of course he melted into the kiss. He knew that whatever her past, it wasn't something she was ready to share with him yet, no matter how much he wanted to know.
“Hands change.” She stated plainly. “Just as you do. Sure, there are outside forces that can affect one’s destiny, but for the most part we pave our own paths."
“J-... Jane Watson.” John said carefully, wincing at the voice that left his lips that was unfamiliar to him. He was a woman right now apparently, and what woman was named John? He took off his shirt and replaced it with a long white one that went down to his ankles. “It's nice to meet you, Molly... Thank you for letting me borrow your clothes...”
"You said earlier that you receive a lot of attention from Moriarty. Are you perhaps his new favorite maid? He's mentioned you several times throughout our correspondence but never by name."
"Yes, we definitely do." Molly muttered, sitting on the sofa and patting the spot next to her. Jane relented, sitting on the sofa and hiding her face behind her hands.
Molly had fussed over her so much when she returned to their humble home drenched in water and had insisted on sitting Jane by the fire, huddled in all of the blankets in the house while she cooked up some soup in further attempt to warm her friend. It was actually quite sweet the way Molly was shuffling around, asking Jane if she was alright every so often. Jane understood her caution, being soaked for hours on end during this era could be fatal. Pneumonia was no joke and Jane was only too happy to comply with Molly's constant worrying and mothering.
"Don't fret over it, Ms. Morstan, I was considering putting the book down and giving my eyes a rest before you interrupted anyway." Mr. Moriarty said with a smile, standing. He didn't appear to be that much taller than John was when he was in his normal body though in his form, John had determined he was a good three inches shorter.
It was quiet until Jim was completely out of earshot, and then Jane charged over to Holmes and glared. "Are you out of your mind?"
"Holmes?" Jane sat up on her bed, rubbing her eyes but not moving to answer the door. She hadn't been asleep, too shaken by what had happened to do so. But it would be a lie of massive proportions to say that she hadn't wrapped herself in all the blankets in the house once more as she tried to calm herself down. "What are you doing here? You should be resting."
"M...M...M..." Jane's expression fell for a moment as Mrs. Hudson couldn't seem to get out any words, staring out in her direction but not at her.
"Married, no. But I do have someone who means a great deal to me." Moriarty answered, shrugging. "And I do have a guest house on my estate. By my honor, your honor would be safe."
It was an overcast day, not exactly atypical of British or Scottish weather. John couldn’t be sure if he appreciated the reprieve from the sun or not. On one hand it would remind him of the sunny battlefields in Afghanistan, but on the other, it had felt like there was a permanent rain cloud hovering over him since he had come back from foreign shores with a bullet wound and a limp that was all in his head.
“July 6th, 1981, John Hamish Watson was born to Clyde and Amanda Watson. The unremarkable little boy… was me." She paused only for a brief moment and then forced herself to deliver an onslaught of truth in the form of a monologue, knowing that if she didn't get it out all at once, she wouldn't have the courage to. "I was average in my grades at school for a great deal of my childhood. I got into rugby at sixteen and I finally started to apply myself academically. I was rather popular with the ladies, but I was never really great at keeping a girlfriend. Finally, I graduated from university with a masters degree, nowhere near the top of my class and to resolve my tuition debts, I joined the army as a doctor where I was shipped out to Afghanistan to help with the war and conflict there. I spent a year and a half out there before the very unlucky day that I was wounded in action and honorably discharged, sent back to London and given a very meager stipend for my services in the Queen’s Army as Captain of the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers. I had frequent panic attacks and nightmares from the trauma. I had a limp that had nothing to do with my shoulder wound, and I had become useless as a surgeon since I couldn’t get my damned hands to stop shaking no matter what I did. I was a broken man with no hope toward a future, no love of myself, and no reason to live… So I left a note for my sister to find, went to a forest with my handgun, and planned to kill myself. And… when I couldn’t… I hated myself more than I ever had… Then one moment I was in 2010, crying on a forest floor littered with leaves, and the next, I was in 1810 with a set of breasts and other key changes, where I was fortunate enough to meet some of the truest friends I have ever had, and the love of my life. I do love you, Sherlock… more than I’ll ever be able to properly say… And the day where I wasn’t able to tell you that… I was whisked by to my own time and I never stopped trying to get back to you to tell you. I wish I could’ve returned to that moment and given you the reply you deserve instead of vanishing for two years and leaving you to mourn me…”
Jane felt out of place like she no longer belonged among these familiar faces. She shifted but kept her posture confident, swallowing thickly and making her way all the way down the staircase.
“How about tarot cards?” She asked playfully, but by the fact that she had already set the deck on the table, John figured that question was probably rhetorical and he wouldn’t be getting a choice in which method the supposed medium used to tell him his destiny.
"Very well, you may continue reading until you find something more fascinating." Sherlock gave an amused chuckle. Jane turned the page as if to egg him on. A fiery glint appeared in Sherlock's eyes, though Jane could not see it as she focused on her book. She felt his weight come off her legs and she smirked.
The weather, he decided, was now trying its best to appear as depressing as possible without actually raining, though the sky made a show of it with booming thunder and a few flashes of lightning despite the lack of an actual downpour.
“As much as I would like to continue to kiss you for the duration of the evening, I do believe it’s about time I attend to my guests and set matters straight…” Sherlock murmured against her lips, his other hand daring to reach for her stomach with the knowledge that his child was growing beneath his fingertips.
Sherlock seemed to be relieved by the assistance Jane was providing him with, his shoulders relaxing. Still, there was a hint of what looked like worry and confusion in his eyes.
"Thank you, Amanda." Wolfguard murmured, finally stepping out of her embrace. He took in a quaking breath and turned his attention to John, putting on a friendly smile. "And this strapping young lad must be Prince Johnathan Hamish Watson, no doubt."
“Why are you here, Dr. Watson?” he asked coldly, not particularly in the mood to play social games with anyone, let alone the woman who had ripped his heart out. Jane winced at her old name. What would she give to be called Mrs. Holmes by him again? To be called Jane at a time where he wasn’t surprised to see her?
"Technically, it's Duke Lestrade but he prefers to be called Mr. Lestrade." Molly murmured with a small shrug, taking Jane's hand and pulling her up the cobblestone path. They followed the lanterns like moths to a flame until they came to a lovely clearing surrounded by thick greenery on all sides. There were tables set up around the edges and lanterns were hung on strands of rope high above their heads. A feast covered every table and in the center of the clearing, people were dancing. A band played off to the side on a temporary wooden stage and those who weren't dancing were in conversation, milling around the tables or watching and enjoying the merriment of this well hosted festivity.
"Ladies first," Moriarty stated, unlocking and opening the door for her. Jane hesitantly stepped inside, looking around her surroundings curiously.
“No, of course not! What sort of host would I be if I made you sleep on the floor?!” Molly replied, shaking her head fervently. “Let’s get your stay off so you can sleep comfortably.”
"I can never stay away from you for long." Sherlock answered, lifting her hand to his lips before heading out of the room and out the door.
"Fighting for you was my pleasure. The aftermath was not particularly enjoyable, but I would do it again if it meant that you wouldn't have to experience unwanted advances."
"I'm sorry to kick you two out but I'm going to need quiet so that I can do this." Jane explained, pulling out a needle and thread from the pouch on her belt. Greg and Mary nodded, leaving the room and shutting the door.
"Yeah. He said he wanted to see me as soon as possible." Jane said with a smirk, turning on heel towards Moriarty's study. Her hope was that being covered in blood would unsettle him in this age of propriety. She wanted to take her time going the twenty yards from Sherlock's door to Moriarty's study. If she could make it a thirty minute walk, she would've, but she didn't want to leave Sherlock's side for long with the state he was in. She paused when she reached the door, sighing heavily as she stared at the expensive oak that separated her from the most annoying man she had ever encountered.
Sherlock was kind enough to escort her home after dinner, pleading with her to ignore his mother, but honestly Jane felt like she had gotten to learn a new side of him. He often seemed to be incredibly serious as an adult but it was obvious that of all of her children, Virginia was closest to Sherlock because he had actually let her in, unlike her other children. While the events of yesterday still haunted her, Jane felt as if she was allowed to relax a little today. Sherlock seemed to be in thought as well, leaving the carriage silent excluding the sounds of clopping hooves and the occasional command from the coachman.
"You look unwell, Ms. Watson. Are you sure you're not ill?" Molly asked, her hand reaching for Jane's face in a motherly sort of way as she felt for his temperature. "Perhaps it was the shock of your travels?"
You have all been so patient, waiting for me to upload the last chapter of this work; thank you. It took me a long time to determine exactly how I wanted to write the ending to this story, and even now, while writing this note, I'm not sure where my fingers will take me.
"You don't. You'll have to take a chance on me. Or I could just leave if that's what you'd prefer..." Jane said, standing up and dusting off her skirts as she turned on her heel, starting to trek down the hill.
She left the party for a moment or two, exhausted from the prodding questions and conversations she'd been navigating since the moment she left the guest room. She felt a hand on her wrist and was pulled against someone. She was about to let out a scream but the voice that shushed her was one she knew well.
Molly and Lestrade's baby was beautifully healthy little girl. It was easy to see the relief on Greg's face when he learned that both mother and child had made it through the birth perfectly fine. Given his history, Jane could hardly blame him for the groove he had paced in the hardwood floor of their estate during the twelve hours of labor that Molly had endured. She had tried to invite the man to be by his wife's side during the process, but he was so insistent that he didn't want to be in the way that eventually, Jane just let it slide.
"It's a little odd, to be honest, but I think I like it." Jane admitted and Sherlock's shoulders relaxed a bit. He kissed her tenderly, starting to move his fingers in and out of her slowly causing a pleased hum to leave her again.
Or perhaps, it was a way for Molly to familiarize herself with the other woman she’d be sharing her resting place with. It was only natural, after all, to be wary of sharing a bed with a complete stranger, that had been why John had suggested that he sleep on the sofa. But Molly’s home was indeed so humble that it did not boast such a thing, much like John’s lonely flat back in London two hundred years in the future.
“I’ll go get the coachman ready.” he murmured, starting to stride toward the door. He paused with his hand on the knob, glancing over his shoulder. “And, Jane? If anyone can do this right, I have no doubt in my mind that person is you.”
"Oh, Mycroft, you always have been a laugh." She mused amongst her giggles. "Mama had to grab you by the ear and threaten your inheritance. You didn't show any interest until I mentioned Jane. Speaking of which, it's a pleasure to meet you."
"Let me see." she murmured, examining the bitemark on his hand with a raised brow. "Did you provoke her?"
"Was that the only thing you wanted to talk about?" Sherlock looked at Jane with a bewildered expression and then blushed and shook his head.
"As ready as I will ever be." she agreed. "I don't see how you intend to get Mr. Holmes to be here, though."
"Jane! Oh, my goodness!" She rushed over to her side. Jane looked up at Mary and brought her closer.
"No, it's that I see myself as undesirable." Sherlock admitted, kneeling on the ground and giving her hands a little squeeze. Jane's expression softened and she knelt down on the floor too, cupping his cheek and gently forcing him to look her in the eyes. She knew that feeling. She was pretty sure it was something everyone went through at some point in their lives. But she didn't want him to feel unwanted, especially since that wasn't the case.
"Next you're gonna tell me that fairies abducted you." He joked but John's expression remained even as he continued to stare at passing cars.
"Mary, I need you to bring plenty of clean cloths, some alcohol - more like whiskey, not wine- bandages, and a pair of scissors to Mr. Holmes room. Now." Jane instructed, lifting up the first layer of her skirt and ripping off a strip of fabric before rushing her way over to the wounded man. "Are you alright? And by that I mean, besides bleeding from your arm."
I feel like I'm getting repetitive with apologizing in all of my chapter summaries, but I'm sorry for being late once again. I promise I'm working to get caught up. :)
"I have so missed you being at the estate, Jane," she admitted, taking her hand and giving it a tender squeeze while she prepared to leave. "It truly feels different without you, and not in the best sense."
"As brooding as ever. Honestly, he's picked up a fascination with staring at the window pane since you showed up on our doorstep. He won't even drink his tea." Mrs. Hudson continued to ramble about his behaviors for a few moments more before she noticed the sad, longing look on Jane's face. "Don't you worry your pretty little head on it, Jane. I know he's being a right bastard about this now, but he does love you. Perhaps he needs some time and then he'll come running back to like he's starving for your attention."
"Shh, shh, Sherlock... It's alright..." She cooed and he relaxed against her, holding her close to him.
"You actually found me a place to work?" she asked, unable to believe it. She was a little worried that it might be some house of ill-repute, but she was fairly certain that Baskerville boasted no such establishment.
"Then I shall inform her. I'll have you both meet here and then you can pick out whatever shop meets your fancy." Sherlock pressed a kiss to his mother's forehead, shook his father's hand and made his way to his room to contemplate the events of the day.
“Well, it looks like your health line is long and deep, so you can be expecting good health.” John had to actually hold back a snort. Fighting off a year of infections in his shoulder wound hadn’t exactly been supportive of this claim she was making to his health. “Looks like you can be expecting a marriage soon too!”
I know, I'm incredibly late posting this chapter, I'm so sorry. I've been trying to get caught up as well as seriously proofread some of my old works and I've learned that proofreading actually takes more time than writing things, so starting March, I'll probably throw in a day just for proofreading. Without further ado, the chapter you've been waiting for!
child,” Jane added, slowly running a hand over her stomach. Up until this point, she had been trying not to get attached but saying those words unleashed a flood a love for the child growing inside her. How could she not love the baby, knowing how beautifully impossible it was?
"I'm impressed that you stuck through it. I recommend favoring that arm until it's a little more healed." Jane murmured, biting her lip. "Thank you for dueling for me. I appreciate it, even if I'm still going to have to turn down Moriarty's advances. Nobody's ever done anything like that for me before."
"What about what you need, Jane? He certainly can't give you that. He doesn't know the first thing about a woman, or how to pleasure her." He forced his way to her neck and started kissing it roughly.
"Of course, I couldn't let my dear Molly go into financial ruin. And any friend of hers can find equal friendship in me." Mary stated with a smile. "Now, if you excuse me, I have to go dress in some work appropriate attire. My mother would have my head if I were to cook in this dress." and with that she retreated upstairs. In about fifteen minutes she returned downstairs again in a light grey dress.
"I convinced the man to put the building to its intended purpose instead of letting it collect dust. I figured he realized he owed you that much," he explained, pulling her into a comforting hug. "It's no life with him, but it is a good start."
Sherlock stepped into the room, guilt flooding through him as he glanced at the woman lying on his bed. He eyed the bodice laying on the floor and blushed at the sight of her undergarment, swallowing thickly. "This is the second time you've saved me this month, Ms. Watson, I do believe you're making a habit of it." he teased halfheartedly, mind obviously distracted. He was, in truth, very grateful for both times she had saved him.
Sherlock spent the duration of the time Mary took care of Jane pacing back and forth between his bedroom door and the balcony, occasionally stopping at the railing to gaze out over the estate with tense shoulders.
"What are you doing here?" he questioned but Jane knew she had to help Mrs. Hudson quickly. There would be time to answer his questions later.
John sat down hesitantly across from her. She held the deck out to him and he swallowed his skepticism to touch it with the assumption that the cards required his touch to determine his destiny. He pulled his hand back after a moment and raised an eyebrow as if he was throwing the ball in her court.
"Your wish is my command..." he murmured, guiding his cock to her folds and slowly pressing inside her, guiding her legs to rest over his shoulders.
He had to swallow down the terrifying thought that she might still do worse to him and that she was simply waiting until after the duel to possibly repeat her show of strength in the forest. Had that action not also been a form of revenge for all of the stupid narrow minded things he had said to her?
“I was supposed to save your life… not the other way around. Putting the last of your strength into moving your arm against my wound in such a way that it would apply pressure long after you died… I didn’t deserve such a sacrifice, not when I couldn’t do my bloody job as your best friend and get you to the damn med tent like I said I would.” John took a moment to let out a half-strangled noise of remorse. “And I’m sorry, Bill, because I’m letting you down again… you saved my life and here I am moments from throwing it away because I can’t stand what I’ve become…”
"What possessed you to do that?" Sherlock asked, blushing furiously, not sure if it was the pet name or the fact that she had just been so inappropriate with him.
Perhaps it was a test, the door so near, Jane so close to leaving through it, leaving him alone with his self-destructive personality again. How had he become like this? Ever since that night three months ago when he awoke to find himself in Jane’s bed, he’d been trying his best to control his bad habits. He’d never touched alcohol much until the day that Jane vanished, would this day be the catalyst to a dizzying downward spiral that would lead to his demise as he drank and drugged away his misery at the side of a woman he had no inclinations for as he watched from afar as Jane’s own world came crashing down and they would both shatter, like some horrible rendition of Romeo and Juliet. Truly, wouldn’t death be more merciful than to still love this deeply and to realize that love would never be returned, and to live with that fact, could he even bare it?
"You saved my life. I was merely returning the favor. I don't like owing anyone. I much rather prefer when people owe me. But we're even now, so I suppose that's that." Sherlock asked, shaking his head. "Since you have medical experience, is it wrong to assume that you have the ability to read?"
"Well, that course of thought certainly not going to help you find your step." Jim reasoned, gently nudging her shoulder. "You have Ms. Morstan, Mr. Moran, and myself to count among your friends. Mrs. Hudson is no doubt very grateful that you came back when you did, and she probably still adores you. Mrs. and Mr. Lestrade seemed pleased to see you at the party. And your husband is not over you yet, I guarantee it."
"I will do it when I can be more sincere towards you with it. Right now, business detains me." Jane glanced towards in the direction that had changed Moriarty's mood. A tall blonde man was leaning against a wall in the corner looking comically out of place in the tea shop with his bright red uniform and broad, muscular shoulders. He had a cup of tea poised in his hands and it looked alarmingly small in his grip. Something about this man unsettled her and she simply nodded.
And when Jane confessed to Molly that it would only be a few months later that the Holmes estate would have its own baby, the mousy brunette was practically beaming. As it turned out, Molly had a surprise of her own to share. She had talked with her husband and the both of them had agreed that should their baby be a little girl, as it was, her name would also be Jane. Jane had never been so flattered in all of her life.
It was now very late at night, or perhaps it was very early in the morning, and John had found himself awake. The sound that had startled him was a crying sound that must've been outside his bedroom door. He yawned heavily trying to ignore it, but the more empathetic side of him couldn't ignore it for long and soon he pushed himself out of bed and padded over to his bedroom door. He opened it just a crack and peeked out, but couldn't see anything. So he opened it wider and looked down the hall in the direction the sound was coming from.
"No reason to make some poor sod suffer your ghastly manners." she reasoned with a small chuckle at the indignant look on his face. "You're fortunate that I'm the one who came across you."
Until this moment, John had never doubted that he was still on the countryside where England met Scotland. Well, he knew he was. The land hadn't changed drastically. But now he was unsure if someone was playing a vicious prank on him or not. Who the hell would have the money for something like this though? Was it really... magic? What time was he in if it was? He had so many questions and Ms. Hooper would surely laugh at him for each inquiry that crossed his mind.
The mashed potatoes were quite possibly the best he’d ever had, soaked in butter and sprinkled with salt, pepper, a hint of basil, and another flavor he couldn't quite place; the perfect companion for an extraordinary pair of bangers. It was a colorful change for his pallet in comparison to the last ten years of breakfast he had subjected himself to through uni, the army, and the most recent chapter of his life. And even the raving lunatic droning on about fairies proved to be at least good entertainment to go with the meal. If not for the fact that he’d never have the chance to utilize it, he would’ve asked the sweet woman whose inn it was for the recipe for the potatoes. He didn’t dwell on it though. He had very little in the way of talent or skill when it came to cooking and he was certain he couldn’t do the buttery clouds justice if he tried to recreate them, even with instructions.
"Currently, I am seeing if I can decipher what position the baby is in," Jane explained and Molly nodded as if she completely understood while Greg's eyebrows furrowed.
"Good. Don't make any, you're spending the day with me." It was always a surprise to see him tell her to do something, rather than asking her, but then again, she was the only person he actually asked the opinion of from what she knew. She didn't mind, she couldn't imagine a better way to spend any Saturday.
He wasn’t quite ready to believe that fortune telling and ghosts were real, but maybe he could swallow enough of his pride to admit some magic existed in the world, and he had somehow ended up in the middle of a bit of it.
Living on Moriarty's estate proved to be just as the man had promised. The guest home was a decent walk from the main house so Jane was left mostly alone. Eventually, she got bored sitting in the empty house and made her way to the main house in search of Moriarty to see if she could at least help with party preparations.
"That's easy, so we declare a rule where girls aren't allowed." Mike said coolly. John thought about it and nodded. Yes, that did sound like a pretty good plan.
"Wow... You've really thought of everything." Jane paused, raising her eyebrows and looking at him with narrowed eyes. "I have a question for you."
Morning came swiftly enough and Molly had a somewhat vague solution as to what was to be done about the financial riddle.
Sherlock stayed on the estate for twelve hours, if Jane were generous with her estimation of time. And the fifty-five minutes she added to make herself feel less lonely was definitely generous. Most of those hours he spent in any part of the manor that Jane was not in. The thought occurred to her that he was avoiding her.
"Well, Mr. Holmes and I agreed to get married as it mutually benefits us both. I'm sure there's nothing else to it. Moriarty... made a move on me today so it was in self-defense..."
Jane sat at a table on the lawn lightly set for afternoon tea, quill in hand as her children ran about the garden chasing one another. It was a perfect, sunny, springtime afternoon; one reserved for family. Sherlock was sitting across from her, legs stretched out under the table as he indulged the subtle contact of their brushing ankles. He had a book poised in his hands, but curiosity as to whatever his wife was thoughtfully writing would catch him every time he turned a page. He dare not disturb her. It was rare to see her so concentrated. In fact, he mused that the last time he had seen her so narrowly attentive to anything was the day she had stitched his arm up. There was some amusement to be found in the fact that she made the same face during surgery as she did, scribbling away on that piece of parchment.
He hardly slept at all, heading to the spot at staying there. But he couldn't stay awake forever and long before the sun rose, he'd fallen asleep.
She put on a dress, going downstairs and still finding the home empty and her hopes sunk. Sherlock had left, whether it was because of shame or regret, she couldn't be sure. It put a damper on her spirits at the thought but she didn't really have anything else to go off of. Sherlock had been drunk, it was possible he woke and discovered the mistake he had made and left as quickly and quietly as he could.
"Halt! Moriarty wins." The man mediating the duel shouted, rushing between them to stop any further swings that might happen.
"Do you want to leave this dreadful party?" he asked, eyes hooded. Jane nodded, grabbing his hand and guiding him through the back doors to her abode.
"It still means a lot to them." Jane stared at him for a moment before resuming picking up dishes and going into the kitchen and returning.
"I think I'm all set, Holmes, but I appreciate the offer, just make sure that Moriarty knows to keep his distance, and I'll be set."
"What?!" Jim shouted, eyes going dark. "Very well, Holmes. If that's how you want to play it. I'd like to challenge you to a duel. Tomorrow morning. If you win, I'll leave Jane alone, but if I win, I'll ask her if she'd rather marry me."
“I… erm… I wanted to thank you properly for today.” Jane murmured, with a strained smile. “I was in a strange place with no friends and no clothes, and you took me in, clothed me, fed me, and gave me a side of your bed. Thank you, I don’t know anyone who would do that where I’m from.”
"How is Mr. Holmes?" Jane couldn't help her curiosity, ever since the night almost a fortnight ago, her mind had been swimming with what he must have thought of her. Perhaps she had been to forward? Perhaps she didn't play hard to get enough and he lost interest. She couldn't guess what his thoughts were, but Mrs. Hudson tended to him daily, so it stood to reason that if anyone would know, it would be her.
“Well, that’s… enlightening…” John muttered, pulling another few pounds from his pockets and setting them on the table with a heavy sigh.
For sure, she'd be fired, but beyond that she didn't know. She'd probably be sued into bankruptcy. That was something she needed to avoid if at all possible. Molly couldn't afford to support the both of them and things were finally starting to look up for the mousy brunette now that they were both employed, with Jane bringing in most of the income. She'd often treat her friend with a new dress and watch as Molly's eyes lit up with gratitude and she'd throw her arms around her in a joyful hug. Yeah. Molly was definitely the sister she'd always wanted.
He glanced at the alarm clock and it’s red glowing numbers were kind enough to inform him that it was just past three in the morning. He was very aware that meant he would not be falling back to sleep again, as he had never been able to successfully sleep after that recurring nightmare. It was perhaps twenty minutes or so after a sigh of resignation and a long staring competition with the ceiling that something unusual happened.
"You didn't tell me she was so beautiful!" Jane blushed bright pink, brushing her bangs out of her face shyly.
"If you've come to gloat, you can go on your way," she growled, taking the cloth and wiping her face dry.
Mycroft was engulfed in government work. It took up an extraordinary amount of his time, leaving him only time for meals, which he had at his office in London, and sleeping, which he only did at his office for a third of the week. Often any letter Virginia sent in regards to minding his health went ignored. He didn't read them unless they were marked 'urgent' and Virginia was smart enough to know that if she marked every letter as such, none of them would be read. News of Sherlock's marriage was sure to be marked under the one that would guarantee his reading, though Virginia seemed certain that Mycroft Holmes would express disappointment in Sherlock's decision to marry rather than any sort of happiness for him.
“I…” Jane hesitated as she thought about what he meant by that and came to the conclusion that he was most likely asking for her to elaborate without actually asking. “Well, the most common symptoms for early stages of pregnancy are nausea, fatigue, either a loss or increase of appetite, and swollen breasts…”
"Oh, well, that..." Jane blushed the brightest shade of red. "Um... Do we have to talk about this now?"
The halls were painted light blue, with molding across the rim of the ceiling. Potted plants and a sofa sat in a room with a table and a fully-stocked bookshelf. It looked picturesque with the sun peaking through the windows to illuminate the room.
"Truly?" he moaned, pulling her down to kiss him deeply. "I had no idea someone could say a phrase that simultaneously sounded so intelligent and incredibly lewd..."
“I’ll get to that in a bit. Let me tell you the truth about my past first because if I don’t do it now, I’ll be scared to for the rest of my life, watching you and Ms. Adler together from the sidelines with a chest full of regret.”
“That’s my older sister, Harriet,” she answered, continuing to rummage through the satchel for a set of dog tags and the old mobile phone Harry had gifted him with upon his return from Afghanistan.
Sherlock Holmes was very, very different from that man. Sherlock always gave her the opportunity to back down, though it had become a more subtle thing in the last two months, and Sherlock would get his answer from how cheeky Jane's responses were and he was sure she did it to encourage him. There was another thing that Sherlock did that was vastly different from any other partner Jane had ever had: he always made it feel like he was worshiping her. He had never once said 'I love you' and yet it was incredibly easy for Jane to believe that he did, and Sherlock was definitely a romantic, more so than Jane had been.
Together this uncomfortable pair walked a block and a half to a tea shop. Jane watched her cup the entire time until the lady poured some tea for them and she made sure to keep her cup as far away from him as possible in case he had any plans to drug her or something.
"What, indeed?" She waited to see if he would take the bait and reveal whatever motives he had in taking her here. He did not take the bait, much to her chagrin.
"The future queen of this kingdom and her father, John." Amanda answered, gently smoothing down the colic at the base of his neck. He gave a small sigh at her grooming him, not paying much mind to her answer.
"I can hardly blame her... I can't imagine what she's going through right now." she replied solemnly. Wolfguard only nodded in agreement. "And your eldest?"
"I'm sorry I took so long. Moriarty keeps his whiskey under locks. As it is, we should never tell him that we're using this to sanitize Mr. Holmes wound." Mary muttered, setting the supplies on a table next to Jane.
"Thank you, Mr. Holmes. That's incredibly honorable of you... I think you should get some rest. You've had a rough morning, and your body could use a chance to recover."
The bliss to be connected to him like this once more, to be in his arms again after so long... it only added to her pleasure. Ecstasy washed over her once more and she clenched around him, pushing him over the edge as well.
She had spent a lot of time crying heavily, sobs sometimes racking her entire, small body, but his tiredness caught up to him bit by bit until every cry dimmed in the haze of his sleep deprivation and his eyelids grew heavier and heavier. And he couldn't say for certain when he finally drifted off for the rest of the night, there against the wall in the hallway.
"Well, I was just strolling but if you'd like I can offer you something other than the condolences you'll receive from everyone else you meet." he mused, smirking.
"You've helped us find a better way to make Molly endure her pregnancy. That's invaluable to me. If she's happy, so am I." Greg murmured, carefully pouring the coins into Jane's hands and making sure she had a careful grip on them.
"Sherlock... Sherlock Holmes." John said, affection coating his tone as his thumb traced the band around his neck.
"I think you underestimate how much he cares for you." Moriarty countered, nudging her to get her walking. "Dear Sherlock nearly drank himself to death, he was so broken up about your disappearance. He's back to never attending parties and he buries himself in his work. And when anyone does see him in a public venue, he has the most unsettling scowl on his face."
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Prince John." Sherlock said almost mechanically, dipping down into a stiff curtsy. John held back a sigh as he knew he absolutely had to return social graces now.
Mary Morstan had a shift today and was about to leave the estate when she heard the knock. She opened the door and gasped in surprise at the unexpected scene.
The air was heavy with the scent of incense, the walls and floors were covered with rugs and tapestries of all sorts of colors and patterns, and the table in the center had, as one might expect, a crystal ball perched delicately on a thin wire stand. John had to physically hold back a scoff at the appearance of this woman’s shop. He was suddenly far less interested in dating her now.
“What a stroke of luck,” he muttered in amusement and Jane let out an annoyed sigh. Of course, even if he hadn't known he'd find delight in knowing now. “Anyways, if I had to venture a guess as to where your husband is hiding, I would suggest either the study or his bedroom as there have been no guests in either room.” Moriarty murmured, pushing her toward the study. “I wish you luck, Mrs. Holmes.”
Jane handed him one of the fresh pieces of cloth Mary had brought her. Sherlock took it with his free hand sticking it in his mouth as he had been ordered. Jane prepared another cloth to be grabbed quickly and removed her shoddy attempt at a temporary bandage. She put the cloth on his wound and applied pressure.
Business slowly began to pick up after that, and Jane attributed it to Mrs. Hudson spreading the word about what a fine job the good doctor had done in helping her recover from something that would've likely killed her had Jane not arrived when she did. Her suspicions were confirmed by most patients when they mentioned the sweet woman's name and that was when Jane realized it was her way of supporting her in the only way she could.
"Not now, Sherlock. I need some tea with rosemary. I know it's odd, but it will help her." she ordered and he narrowed his eyes before rushing to the kitchen.
she thought, feeling a little sick at the intimacy Moriarty was trying to instill. Still, the man paid her salary and knew that he wouldn't take kindly to putting in place boundaries. "Listen, your workload is going to be a little different for the next week until Sherlock goes back to his own estate. He's requested that you be the one charged with his care since he's most familiar with you out of the entirety of my staff."
“I… I don’t think I’ll make it to the pub with you, C-Captain…” Bill said in a weak voice that could hardly be heard over the gunshots that surrounded them. He was in a great deal of pain to be sure, but shock had already drowned his nerves in a haze, making it easy for him to give John a loopy smile with a hint of regret.
The sun was very low on the horizon when he finally heard the door to his bedroom open behind him and turned on heel to see Mary stepping out into the hall, glancing at him expectantly.
Everyone looked like they were from the Regency era. Normally, they should be the odd ones, but with John so under-dressed, he was definitely the odd one out in this case. His pace increased until he was running, trying to avoid people's cold and judgmental gazes as he escaped the small civilization. He found a stable and hid among the straw, trying to get his bearings. His head was reeling as he tried to make sense of the events this morning.
"I do, actually." Ms. Morstan answered with a smirk. "Mr. Moriarty was kind enough to invite my family to attend so now that you are ready, it's my turn to go prepare. Have fun, tonight, Jane. And I wish you luck with your husband."
“Yes, I can imagine how awful that must sound…” Sherlock agreed with an awkward nod. “You’re welcome to share my ‘solitude’ for a few moments…”
"Yes." Jane lied, knowing she had no place here now. The hurt that had been in Sherlock's voice before Ms. Adler showed up had made sure she knew that she shouldn't be here. "Mrs. Hudson was behaving bizarrely and Mr. Holmes sent for me."
"Oh, yeah. I forgot those aren't things yet." Sherlock stared at her quizzically before stretching his arms in an attempt to loosen his shoulders.
"Well, I was sure no one would take me seriously as a physician. And at the time I was an acquaintance of the cook here, so she recommended me and I got the job. Cleaning is something that anyone can do, but I have a lot of experience with it so it was what I was settled with." she explained as they walked down to the kitchens. Once they were there, she allowed Sherlock to find a place he was relatively comfortable as she started her work on the numerous dishes on the counter. He chose to be relatively close to her, watching as she worked with intrigue.
"He passed away. I'm simply alleviating myself of the responsibilities he left for me to deal with."
"So what happened? You were abducted by some sort of weird underground organization that dresses men in dresses and gives them feminine names?"
"Are you saying that you only say these things to get me excited?" Jane asked, one arm draped over her eyes as she tried to hide her blush.
"If you'll excuse me, I must go see about attaining a drink..." and with that Sherlock left, weaving through the crowd.
"Yes. Would you like me to introduce him to you when we get there?" Jane's expression changed into a more gleeful one as she started to giggle. This served only to annoy him and he sighed. "I don't understand what you find so amusing."
“Thank you…” she murmured sincerely. She moved across the room, carefully bent over and handed him the book he had dropped. “It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other…”
"Jane... Jane... wake up!" It was Sherlock. Jane groaned, opening her eyes to find the room still flooded with darkness. It was Saturday, but the sun probably had at least an hour or two before it was going to rise. She curled back up into the pillow, burying herself under the covers. "Come on, Jane. You agreed to spend the day with me. I have something special prepared."
"I do not need an introduction from him seeing as I know him as my employer." It was obvious that Sherlock had thought she was rearing at the chance to meet Mr. Moriarty as a marriage prospect. It was a common enough practice for ladies to try and marry the wealthiest men they could get their hands on. In the case of Baskerville, the two wealthiest and most eligible gentlemen around were Mr. Moriarty himself, and the mysterious Mr. Holmes. "The attention I receive from him is more than enough, I don't have the need nor the want to bring more to myself."
All chatter in the room stopped completely when they spotted the glamorous, yet revealing red dress, but the moment her face was revealed, the room grew completely silent save a few surprised gasps before the room flooded with murmurs.
What had been most surprising was that instead of some random sound, Sherlock had elected to moan her name. Their fingers laced together and she held tightly to his hands before giving them a gentle and encouraging squeeze.
With a sigh of resignation, he pulled up his trousers and walked to the town, a blush creeping over his features and tinting the edges of his ears. How humiliating!
“There’s the skeptic version where I tell you about yourself based on the lines on your hand.” She explained. “Or there’s the fun version where I tell you what your future could look like.”
Too soon, it was Sherlock's last day at Reichenbach Manor, since he was fully healed, and they were in the kitchen as they usually were in the afternoon. Sherlock was sitting on a stool he had found in the attic reading while Jane attended to the pile of dishes that needed to be washed. Mostly, the reason Sherlock still accompanied her into the kitchens was because she was one of the few people that actually enjoyed his company, and he would be lying if he said the feeling wasn't mutual, but he would also avoid the subject if asked about it.
He clambered over to the piano, sat down, cracked his knuckles, and started playing what one would kindly describe as badly, and in a voice that made nails on a chalkboard seem pleasant, began to sing. It was an excruciating performance but manners bound everyone in the room to pay attention to it.
Moriarty was sprawled across his desk with a man balls deep inside him, covering his mouth to keep from moaning. Jane was unfortunately not lucky enough to not immediately be noticed. Moriarty let out a yelp of surprise, shifting away from the man.
"Mr. Lestrade! He asked me last night after the party had mostly died down. And I couldn't help it, I just said yes!"
"I'm not sure Mr. Holmes would agree with that assessment," Jane admitted, rubbing the tears from her eyes.
It had been a month. Harry had insisted that John get a therapist but he wouldn't really talk about his feelings or anything with the professional. Mostly John poured himself into research on blue moons and fog. Fog wasn't terribly uncommon in the town he'd spent the last fifteen months of his life in. But it was a little daunting to imagine how much luck he'd have to have in order to get both a blue moon and a foggy morning on the same day.
"What I did last night?" He asked but it was obvious that Jane didn't have to answer that question when Sherlock grabbed a pillow and buried his face in it.
“Legend goes that the fairies will steal away anyone on the moor when there’s a blue moon, foggy weather, and a rising or setting sun.” The mad man said in a hoarse voice, pausing to take a long sip of a nearby glass of water that the inn keeper had left for him.  “It just so happens that those very conditions are possible tonight!” He said with a twinkle in his eyes, it was a form of child-like wonder that John never anticipated seeing in a man so old. “So be wary if you go out tonight, you might just end up in the presence of the Fairy King himself!”
"We've been walking for almost two hours..." Jane groaned quietly, yawning as if to prove her point. "Wherever you were planning on taking me, I think we're lost."
"I'm not distressed." Sherlock protested, pausing an reevaluating himself. "Well, at least, I don't believe myself to be. I'm sorry for causing you so much concern, mother. I'll have you know that I was in very capable hands. Mr. Moriarty has under his staff one of the most skilled surgeons I have ever seen."
"Hey, are you alright?" the man asked, raising an eyebrow. He had an American accent and by no fault of his own, his face was not the one John wanted to see. The ranger studied him for a moment. "Hey, you look familiar... Oh, you're John Watson!"
“If you still don’t want to be with me, that’s fine, I understand, the truth is a lot to take in, and if it made you uncomfortable… well, I’m sorry for that… I felt like you deserved to know all of it.” Jane confessed, starting to reach for the door handle. “I’ll return you to your solitude.”
He decided that it was all some strange festival he hadn't been made aware of. Some sort of regency celebration. The one thing he couldn't seem to explain was how he had become a woman. It made no sense, he didn't feel any different. He looked at his shoulder and sure enough the gnarled scar was still there. Then it occurred to him that he had just run through town. Come to think of it, he hadn't used his cane since he sat down next to that holly tree. Where was his cane?
"Holmes, just because I had a bad experience with Moriarty doesn't mean that I'm not willing to marry you still. I know you don't want to marry a boring woman. And I could really use a relationship with a man that doesn't want me for my body, but for a source of intelligible conversation."
"Molly and Mr. Lestrade's wedding made our own feel kind of stuffy in comparison." Jane mused while reading a book in bed next to her husband the following morning.
She started on her way there, but all eyes were still on her. She was certain she’d never make it into the study unnoticed.
The rest of the evening was simplicity itself and went much better than she expected. Sherlock played the perfect gentleman as usual and everybody liked the decorations and simple gifts that Jane had gotten them. Christmas felt weird without the Christmas Crackers she grew up with but she felt a little less lonely than she had. And anything was better than how she felt about life almost a year ago.
It felt strange to refer to herself by that name since she'd been going by Jane for nearly half a year now. She now couldn't say if she preferred the life of Dr. John Watson, or Ms. Jane Watson. On one hand, John's life was over, it had ended the day he marched up to that holly tree and tried to pull the trigger. What more did he have to live for in the future? Jane wasn't treated the greatest but at least she had made friends and none of them treated her like she was broken. Friends. She pondered for a moment whether Sherlock Holmes fell under that category. He had risked his life in an attempt to save her from Moriarty's advances, and somehow she knew that was the most selfless thing he had done in his life. Yes, Sherlock Holmes could be considered a very good friend.
“Does he not deserve to know, Jane?” he asked in return, gently touching her arm as a form of support. “Your reputation will be ruined in a matter of months. It’s already been a month since you found out and soon you’ll show and everyone will assume the worst.”
"You're staying with Moriarty." It wasn't a question, but rather a disappointed observation. Jane relaxed in Sherlock's grip.
"You work for Moriarty?" he asked in shock before recovering his normal air of disinterest. "I didn't realize he required an amateur physician."
"Oh, there are plenty more in my vocabulary. Besides, I'm not a lady, just a maid." Jane shrugged, wincing and rubbing her left shoulder. The scar from her past had been sensitive since she had gotten burnt.
"Not even if it's a place to stay until you can convince your dear husband to take you back?" Moriarty questioned, looking at her expectantly.
"... I..." Sherlock was in a stunned silence for a moment, staring down at the beautiful polished and carved instrument in his hands before finally daring to look at Jane. "Thank you... I'm sorry I didn't get you something..."
“You’re not going to reveal anything out of the ordinary, I very much doubt that anyone will notice. But try it on and we’ll decide.”
"Where's Sherlock? It's rude for the host to not greet his family." She mused, looking to Jane for answers. Jane felt nervousness well up inside her.
"What kind of sister would I be if I let you live in those cruddy army veteran flats?" she smirked. The truth was, after the suicide scare, she was a bit overprotective and John living with her helped her just as much as she hoped it helped him.
"Jane..." Sherlock carefully lifted himself to look her in the eye with an incredibly determined look. "That could never be the case."
“An orphan? I'm very sorry to hear of the tragedies that have befallen you.” Molly said sincerely. “I know that you have no money for a carriage to London. And should you have nowhere to stay, you may stay with me in my room, if you like. My bed is big enough for the two of us. I'd feel terrible letting you go and wander about.”
He kissed her passionately, pouring his seed inside her and still thrusting through his own orgasm as Jane continued to moan his name quietly in his ear. They held onto each other as waves of pleasure washed over them and their vision blurred in and out of focus.
"Just an observation that not everything you see is as it seems." he said grimly, pinching his hand in a last ditch effort to wake from a Sherlock-less nightmare.
“Three months, if I recall correctly.” Sherlock murmured, taking a step away to set the book on a nearby table.
"If I had been more aware of the world around me, the incident could've been avoided altogether. You wouldn't have gotten injured."
"Is a Duke allowed to marry out of his status?" Jane asked seriously, not wanting to be the voice of reason, but knowing that someone had to be in this case.
“I love you too, Sherlock.” Those words, hearing them said so sincerely seemed to breath color and life back into Sherlock’s world. A moment passed as they quietly stared at one another and then Sherlock’s hand found itself cupping her cheek as his lips pressed insistently against her own. Jane’s arms snaked around his neck, fingers tangling into his curls as her back pressed against the door. The kiss seemed to simultaneously last too long and not nearly long enough.
"I don't need to know. Of course I'm curious and of course I want to know more about you, Jane. I may not be a patient man by reputation but I could wait for you to tell me until we're old and gray and our bodies are covered in strange warts and wrinkles. And even if you're still not ready to tell me then, I wouldn't mind."
Sherlock started worshiping her breasts with his mouth but he could tell that she was preoccupied now. He paused, pressing their foreheads together and looking at her with a expression.
"Jane..." He whimpered her name quietly, starting to kiss her tenderly. In this small, short moment she realized that she may have been the first person to make him feel loved. Not to discredit his parents; parental love was a very different breed, one she knew Sherlock was familiar with, but there was a sense of obligation associated with it. Jane had no such obligation and simply took him as he was and it was altering for him to realize this.
John couldn't help but feel like this was the easiest job interview he had ever had though he wasn't sure if it was attributed to the era or the fact that Moriarty was attracted to him, well, her.
Jane let out a small moan, grabbing him by the collar of his jacket and pulling him nearer. He broke the kiss to plant his lips on her neck, hand seeking out the laces at the back of her dress to tug them undone. He held her close, licking over her neck and sucking at her pulse point and she forgot how to breathe for a moment once he started sliding her dress off her.
“Oh, this?” Jane asked, pointing to the scar that had somehow led her to this moment. “No, I’ve had this for quite a while now.”
"The pleasure is all mine, Dr. Watson. I don't believe I've ever heard of a woman becoming a doctor. Surely, you must be more fortunate than I." Ms. Adler reasoned. "Are you here on business?"
Jane could only nod quietly, staring at Sherlock with confusion. She couldn't imagine what he stood to gain from this arrangement, but Mr. Holmes seemed like the kind of man who detested anything that wasn't strictly in his personal interest. "If you have time to do your other chores, that's fine too but if not, I can divide it up among the other girls."
Ms. Adler was on the staircase, with an expression Jane had yet to see on her face until now, pure anger. She made her way down the grand staircase, schooling her features into their usual, friendly countenance.
"If it's about the rumors that I'm on the prowl for an affair, I'm not." Jane answered and Sherlock's face only showed more confusion.
“I do believe you’re insulting me, Mrs. Holmes.” Moriarty bantered back with a chuckle. “I’m glad you two finally came to your senses.”
Molly of course was smirking when she spotted a still slightly disheveled Jane in a nightgown with various pieces of her last night's ensemble strewn about the floor, as well as Sherlock's waistcoat and vest.
"Please. All I did was convince your husband to let you pursue your passion since he's being so stubborn about being with you," he assured, patting her back before pulling away. "Now, I realize that it's rather late to begin working today so let me escort you back to your home and you can start in the morning."
"How romantic." she teased before turning serious. "I was writing to my sister." He quirked an eyebrow in expectation that she'd elaborate. "I know that there's not exactly postage to the future, but I don't know, a part of me hopes that she'll come across it and know that I'm okay. I didn't exactly leave her with the impression that I'd make it back to the time I wanted."
She wasn't sure how she'd survive but she was determined to, though what for, she couldn't begin to guess. She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself.
"Normally it would pose quite the issue, but since Mr. Lestrade inherited his title from his wife, may she rest in peace, he isn't bound by the rules of royalty. It's mostly out of respect that he has the title and land that he keeps, but he does such a good job running our little village that he's able to keep his title and everything that comes with it."
"A well-educated woman who has shown herself to be ambitious, brave, compassionate, and forgiving." Sherlock corrected, raising an eyebrow as he looked at her. She looked back with surprise.
"Amanda, it's a pleasure to see you, thank you for your hospitality. I know this was rather unexpected." The man greeted, he looked very tired to John.
“I… I need to get something from upstairs if I’m going to be honest with him…” Jane murmured, looking toward the stairs though not actually moving toward them.
"You have a great deal of faith in me, Mr. Moriarty." She couldn't say that she was terribly excited at the prospect of facing off against a furious Sherlock, but if he did end up showing, she knew Moriarty wasn't going to give her much of a choice.
The sight that greeted Jane and Molly was awe inspiring. Mr. Lestrade, by judgement of his estate alone appeared to be better off than Moriarty, and quite possibly Jane's own husband. The lawn was covered in beautiful painted paper lanterns that were already lit and welcoming.
They made the ride to the Moriarty estate in relative silence, occasionally Mary would ask a question and John would answer it to the best of his ability. Most of them were about John's or rather Jane's past. In the past month if felt like he had two different lives, and he actually did. There was depressed former army doctor, Captain John Hamish Watson, and there was an orphan of no fortune or skill, Jane Watson. He wasn't sure which he preferred. Both existences seemed just as lonely. Yes, he had Molly here and he had Harry back in his time but friendship didn't seem to fill the void he had. He wasn't sure exactly what would fill that void, if he were at all honest with himself.
“I realize this question may be indelicate, but I was wondering what it was you were doing in my father's stables?” Molly asked, examining the young blonde lady with unabashed curiosity. A flush covered John's face, and he swallowed heavily.
"Still too early to hear the baby's heart." she decided out loud, moving on to check Molly's health as the health of the mother was just as important as the baby's. "Are you eating well, Molly?"
"It's perfectly fine. I would be remiss if I didn't contribute somehow." Sherlock explained, chuckling. "By the way, Mr. Lestrade sent me a letter. He mentioned something about you dragging him into the woods to get a pine tree?"
"I'm not violent. I was merely teaching you to not judge a book by its cover." she corrected with a secretive smile. "And you wouldn't believe me even if I told you."
"Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it." Jane murmured sincerely and he smiled, guiding her back to the carriage.
He took his time getting dressed, familiarizing himself with the unfamiliar fashion that the Regency era boasted. His stay was looser today, most likely from inexperience, but he couldn’t be bothered to complain.
The song seemed to be about lights and dancing and adventure, fitting the theme of the evening rather well, Jane thought. The lighthearted excitement of the singer's performance was contagious, even Jane was feeling her spirit lifting.
"Ah, Mrs. Holmes, good morning." he greeted sincerely. Mrs. Holmes. How come everyone saw her as that except for Mr. Holmes?
Jane stared at him quietly, surprised that he was opening up to her like this. "So you like people, but you feel like you're not one of them?" Sherlock nodded and she merely considered this man for a while. "When I first met you, I thought you were a real prat."
“Are you sure it’s not a little… tight? You do realize that I’m trying to keep this a private matter for now, right?” Jane asked, looking at the thin waistline of the fabric skeptically.
"I've already said too much. I'd spoil the surprise if I told you anything more," he smirked, leaning back against the cushions.
"Just... stitch me up, Dr. Watson." Sherlock murmured, watching her with fascination as she quickly organized the supplies she had requested.
"I believe you've stated that before." Sherlock finally relaxed slightly and chuckled too. "I have to admit, I never thought I would hear you curse like that. I wasn't even aware a lady could know such expletives."
"Don't hesitate to call on us should you ever wish to see us outside of appointments and parties. Your company is always sorely missed, Jane." Molly murmured, smiling brightly. The married couple left and Jane noticed the sun low enough on the horizon to consider going home.
"I suppose it is rather obvious.. isn't it..?" Jane nodded and he sat next to her. "I just... don't want to be a cause for you to think all men are hopeless..."
Of all the questions she'd expected, that hadn't been on the list. When had he noticed? He was never home. She'd always been so careful not to get caught. Apparently not careful enough...
"Ah. I see." Jane was quiet for another minute before another question flowed from her lips. "Observing what, exactly?"
"Yes, John, sweetie, say hello to your new friend." Amanda said, turning to look at John. This happened to be the very last thing on the planet that John wanted to do. If saying hello confirmed this frightening little girl to be his friend, he would rather not. He swallowed nervously and tried to hide behind his mother's skirts. This was unusual for him. John was usually the perfect prince. Her brow furrowed and she stiffly guided him in front of her, holding him by the shoulders since he looked like he was about to bolt for it.
"You're so shy, it's cute." she giggled, climbing out of bed and fetching a dressing gown from her dresser, but not before bending over to show off her arse. Sherlock's face was bright red. "I'm not sure you're allowed to be this shy after being so commandeering last night, Holmes."
"Maybe... I've never heard anyone besides you say my name with as much love as that voice did..." she shrugged, kissing his nose.
"No. I'd still be weeping over his engagement," Jane admitted, looking out the window and sighing. "What am I to do..?"
"Oh, I'm with child," Molly admitted, hand resting on her stomach. Jane felt a twinge of jealousy. What would she give to be able to have a child with Sherlock?
"Oh, John..." Amanda sighed, shaking her head. She brushed his hair out of his face with her fingers. "That wasn't very kind to do."
"You most certainly will dance with me, Mycroft, or I will have someone collect your toes." Euros interrupted her brother's protests, grabbing his arm and dragging him across the polished floor in the direction of the dance floor. Wolfson and Virginia looked at each other, shared a small chuckle and followed the two of them. Sherlock didn't follow after them but rather lingered next to Jane a moment.
"Never, Janey. You've become like a sister to me, and I plan to continue treating you like one, even when you take up Mr. Sherlock Holmes' name." Jane smiled and hugged Molly.
"I'm your lady's maid, I'm supposed to be obsessed with your looks." Molly smirked and Jane felt her face mirror it.
"Was that not the right thing to say?" Jane didn't say anything, instead she shook off his grip and continued walking. "I'm sorry, Jane... Forgive me... I don't know what I said that wronged you but I would take it back in an instant. I... marriage is still incredibly new to me. I've never had an instance where I needed to know the right words to say before, and I can see that one of those instances was now..."
"Oh, no! Of course not. I could never ask that of you." Molly protested, a light blush coming to her cheeks at the question. Embarrassment, John decided. "Actually, I had hoped that you might have an idea as to where Jane could find some work."
Sherlock knocked tentatively on the door to his parents' room, swallowing thickly as he prepared to introduce them to the idea of him getting married. His mother had been urging him to get a bride for what felt like an eternity, however he couldn't be sure that she would be happy or even relieved with his choice, even if he had stated otherwise to Jane already.
"Normally, I'm sure it would be, but as these aren't exactly normal circumstances, no." Sherlock answered, averting his eyes and swallowing thickly.
"I know for a fact that's not true and I have the pictures of baby John and Harry taking a bubble bath together to prove it." Harry retorted, eliciting another sigh from him. "Though, if you were a little girl, I think it's safe to say you've moved on to your angst-riddled teenage years. Come on, John, what's going on with you?"
"Jane is fine, Mr. Lestrade." Jane gave him a sympathetic smile and he nodded after sharing a glance at Molly as if asking permission.
"I accidentally spilled Mr. Moriarty's hot bath water. I'm so sorry. I wasn't paying attention." the maid said pitifully. Sherlock shot her a glare.
“Yes, well, you may have just inspired an invention to block out noise with that performance.” she teased.
“I’ve got a bit of bad news…” Moriarty had returned with a frown. “Apparently, no one has seen Sherlock this evening.”
"I couldn't agree more, Mrs. Holmes." he said softly, straddling her legs and gently grabbing her arse. Jane let out a little gasp of surprise but attempted to bury her attention into her book. "Trying to ignore me?"
"It's just a shirt, Jane. I can put on a new one." Moriarty assured, concern not leaving his face. "I'm sorry I pushed you towards him... I could've saved you some heartache."
“I’m neither joking nor drunk, Ms. Adler, if you would allow me the opportunity to explain myself I’d be ever so grateful.” Sherlock gave her a warning glare and she swallowed thickly, hesitantly releasing his arm. “Now, as I was saying… The fact of the matter is that I am very much still a married man. Many of you know this, but for those of you who do not, my wife returned rather miraculously some months ago, and I, being the blind, heartbroken fool that I was, turned her away.” Sherlock’s eyes found Jane in the crowd and his expression softened. “The truth is that I love Jane Holmes with all my heart. Anyone who has known me for five minutes can see that is the most overt feature about me. The day that she vanished was honestly the worst day of my life. I have spent every waking moment since that day trying to understand why she disappeared from my side but I came to a very important conclusion… it doesn’t matter why she left, what matters, what truly matters is that she spent every hour of every day trying to get back to me, and there are few honors that she could gift me with that compare to that. She, just by being by my side, inspires me to be the man I’ve always wanted to be, the man my mother always hoped I’d become. I used to hold no regard for the world or the people in it, but through her eyes, through her love and compassion, I have tamed. I am no longer the unruly teenager who would bark insults at anyone that so much as looked at me. I’ll admit at times he’s still in there, but old habits are hard to break. So while you were all anxiously anticipating the nuptials between Ms. Adler and myself, I’m only too happy to remind you all that I am married and quite happily at that. Tonight, instead, let us turn this revel into a celebration of my wife’s return!”
