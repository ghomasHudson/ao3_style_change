After they left rehab, he and Hannah kept in touch. And she started coming by the fratway house often.
“Cas,” Dean says. “I was the most miserable son of a bitch on the planet. It’s like … the height of all irony that I showed you what happiness is. Add another line to my résumé. ‘Killed Hitler. Helped defeat God. Taught Cas how to be happy.’” He lays his head back down on Cas’s chest and laughs.
So now Hannah has left and he’s in his small room, trying to collect himself. And trying not to think about Sam and Dean. His family. Moving on without him. It hurts—it hurts so much. And he knows they’ll be here soon (he doesn’t want them to be here
Cas doesn’t even bother to roll his eyes—it’s not worth it. “She stops by to work with Benjamin.” Hannah and Benjamin are spearheading an initiative, a kind of prime directive for other angels who will someday be sent to earth. It’s called Angels for the Ethical Treatment of Vessels.
The parallel occurs to him now as it never did before. He hadn’t asked to be Jack’s parent, hadn’t signed up for that. No, that was Cas’s choice—and a shitty choice at that, Dean had thought at the time. But Cas died just as Jack came into the world, and Dean did everything in his power to get rid of Jack. When that didn’t work, he did everything he could to shirk his responsibilities.
He has to take a piss. He cracks his shoulder and reaches for his robe. Well, okay, Dean’s robe, which he can see just vaguely in the light coming in from the hallway. He starts to get up when he sees the familiar figure sitting at the end of his bed.
“Oh, there you go again,” Cas said one day when he walked into the library, peering over Sam’s shoulder to see what he was doing. “There you go, filling in your little boxes.”
Okay, so he’s found someone. Online. Guy’s name is Federico. And he looks like Cas. At least in his pictures he looks like Cas. And his smile sorta looks like Cas’s smile, and his hair, and his body, from what Dean can see of it …
“Jack’s Enochian is often a little awkward when it comes to the specific inflections. He functions in it pretty well, but he didn’t grow up speaking it.”
He’s not in the backyard with Ambriel for a minute before she gets right to the point: “Are you still in love with Dean Winchester?”
They sit on a bench together. The wind is strong, just as it is on earth. Cas begins to tell the story, that when Metatron cast the angels out of heaven, some of them adapted to earth and didn’t want to go back, Daniel and Adina especially. “They found peace down there. They began to understand free will. They just wanted to be left alone.” He remembers how they were just living off the land, bothering no one. “But other angels considered it a form of rebellion. When one tried to coerce them into going back, they killed him.”
“Maybe it won’t. It might not be enough to disturb the Empty … but maybe it’ll be enough to wake one of us up. Enough of a jolt. So one of us can get the hell out of here. And if my son is still alive, you get to him and the Winchesters and tell them what’s going on.”
He wants to tell Dean that he’s lucky. That even in the ways he’s been extraordinarily unlucky—growing up Winchester, going to hell a few times, being Michael’s bottom bitch, losing Cas—he’s still the luckiest sonofabitch Sam knows. He’s lucky to have known Cas, to have loved him, to have had him for so many years.
But they soon discovered that they couldn’t wake up. Simply knowing about the dream didn’t rouse them from sleep. And Cas knew that the way he got out last time was through Jack—that Jack had been strong enough to wake him.
Sometimes Dean even wandered into Sam’s room in the middle of the night. Sam never asked questions. He just moved over to make room for Dean and made sure he got most of the covers. Just as Dean had done for him when they were kids and he had terrible nightmares—nightmares that turned out not to be nightmares at all, but memories.
“I know, it bites it. But actually …” He produces another flier. “We really do have Enochian classes here. You can come either Mondays and Wednesdays or Tuesdays and Thursdays. Daniel teaches Mondays and Wednesdays, and Adina teaches Tuesdays and Thursdays.” He lowers his voice. “Between you and me, people like Daniel more, but Adina’s the better teacher.”
“I should have known you would take the iPod in the worst way possible. I told Jack, ‘Dean is good at love. Not so good at faith.’ So he set up this meeting.”
soon—their lives are precious to him), but he knows he’ll never be happy here. Among other angels. No matter how hard he tries and tries.
right, and I was wrong, and there was a steep price to pay. But I didn’t break rules just because I felt like breaking them.”
Now, under the lights and beside the animals, next to the woman he loves and the brother he’ll never leave, Sam remembers who they once were, and what they came for.
“I know he’s God now, Cas. But he’s still a kid who needs a dad. Everyone does, you know that as much as we do. And Sam and me? We can’t be there for him, not like that. But you can. And down here? You’d miss him, I know you’d miss him as much as he’d miss you … and … I know what it's like to miss you.” He’s crying, and it’s Cas’s turn to comfort him again.
Miracle is no longer interested in the stick. He’s in the middle of the field, sniffing for something.
He slumps out of the room. Even in this new version of heaven, Metatron is the most annoying celestial being he’s encountered in his three-point-six billion years of being an angel.
He leads Dean to a strand near the edge of town. There you can look out on a large body water; there are boats. A couple people surfing. Dean says he likes this—having lived most of his life in a landlocked state, he appreciates the water.
Dean wants to scoff and tell Sam not to be such a pill-popping drama queen, but … the fact remains that he hasn’t been sleeping well either. So he nods and Sam gives him a small peach-colored pill.
He thinks about sharing his theory that Cas is a slushie machine or a thunderstorm or a Lady Gaga song, but even in death, he knows it’s bonkers.
He remembers now: in the Empty, she was the one to drive a hot steel rod through his head. Every night. An event that never became less excruciating no matter how many times it happened.
He doesn’t remember much. Only getting up to see the other angels in the common room, and then leaving abruptly to go back to his room, and then the ground rushing up to meet him, and—
He pushes back hard against Dean, pulling them together at the waist as Dean had done. Then he hooks one finger to the front of Dean’s jeans, and starts to undo the button. Reaches inside.
. Just as much as I’m your father, if not moreso. He was there when I wasn’t. When I couldn’t be. And yet here you sit, talking about him like—like he’s nothing to you, like he’s expendable—” Cas stands up despite feeling as though he might collapse.
“Maybe it’s a deity?” Dean ventures. Sounds about right. A deity who’s bored off his ass by the Pax Jackana.
John tucks his hands in his jacket pockets, seems to falter a little. “You’re looking for this, um, friend. This Castiel. I know.”
Dean pulled up to the liquor store and parked. Usually Sam went with him, but this time he didn’t even take off his seatbelt. He told Dean he didn’t want anything.
Dean collapses into Cas’s arms again, and they begin kissing, and kissing, and finding each other in the darkened bedroom all at once, and then over and over again.
He shrugged. “I don’t know, Hannah. I’m a soldier. I’ll go where I’m needed most. But in any case,” he says, sitting on the bench overlooking the valley beneath them, “I’m not back to full capacity yet. I wouldn’t be of use to anyone right now.”
Sitting in front of a fountain at the center of a pristine town, Cas learns that Dean is dead. Has died. Is already in heaven.
He is. He’s been allowing Jack’s words to wash over him without really thinking too hard about them.
Dean nodded, his eyes glassy. Sad and red-rimmed from both too much alcohol and stress. “I know, man. I don’t know why I do half the things I do. It’s like, I’m not even me sometimes.”
Thing is, for the first time in his life, he’s absolutely uninterested in getting laid. By anybody. Scarlet Johansson could show up at his room in the bunker totally naked, and he’d undoubtedly just shrug.
“Cut the sanctimony, Castiel,” Bartholomew said. “We’re not getting out of here. Ever. That hope-and-change bullshit might have worked for your human fuckbuddies. But now you’re with us. And the one you gripped tight and raised from perdition? Doesn’t seem interested in returning the favor.”
This wasn’t purgatory or hell—places Dean had been—but someplace he could never imagine. Eternal. He thinks of Jack’s words:
isn’t real,” Jack clarifies, gesturing to the town. “But the hospital, your friends—yes, of course they’re real. No, you’re not still in the Empty.”
“Oh yeah, sure Cas.” Dean pulls back more of the covers so that they can both be under them together. “I didn’t think angels got tired.”
He gets up to go inside, leaving Sam with the pond and the dead log, and Miracle sniffing around the field.
“Vampires, right.” Dean shakes his hand slowly, trying to organize his thoughts. He has too many thoughts. “How are you even—if I saved you, then—”
“Sure. And Metatron is wrong, by the way. You don’t need flowers or an orchestra. Just go to the dude. He’s a chill dude. But … you want me to wing you down there? I’ve recovered enough to do that, and it’ll save you time. You see my wings—almost back to full span, eh? I promise nothing'll go wrong.”
“You two share a history. You wouldn’t have to explain the family business. Or tell her some stupid cover story about hunting trips. And, well, she’s cute as hell. Well—I really thought, you know.” He tilts his head back. “I just don’t want to see you make the same mistakes I did.”
. And therefore, infinitely more fascinating. There’s a sense of perpetual déjà vu, but not in a way that makes you anxious. It’s all very strange and appealing, like walking into a room and not recognizing at first, and then realizing that it’s your childhood bedroom, except the walls are made of flowers.
Metatron still irritates everybody, but it’s clear to Cas that they tolerate him because they know his unpleasantness stems from his deep insecurities—his awareness that he failed as an angel, as God’s scribe, and as God’s replacement. He’s intensely self-hating, and Cas understands that.
Eventually Cas pulls back and then puts his arms around Dean, holding him close. “There is a lot to tell you about, Dean. But I don’t know where to begin. I don’t even know what I know.”
The boy stands, as if sensing he can better explain things if he’s upright. “So you can talk to anyone? Say you want to get outside this part of heaven, talk to a ninth-century Mayan. You can’t do that with English. But if enough people speak Enochian …”
“No, you didn’t. Not like I—I mean, I made you miserable, Cas. I was so sad to hear …” His breath catches. “Sad to hear you weren’t, you know, happy.” The admission breaks him open a little more. Two seconds away from sobbing. “I have that effect on people, you know. Or, I should say,
But Dean seems okay to breeze past it. “Yeah, you know me, man. I mean, I’ve thought about … things … but I spent a lot of my life …” He looks up again, at Cas, and some expression of guilt and longing crosses his face. Then he seems to brighten again. “Well, like I said. What’s past is past.”
He wants to go into Cas’s room and look at the book about birds, which he’s already looked at so many goddamn times. He puts both feet on the floor and gets ready to stand. Laughs quietly. “Gotta hand it to Jack, though. He’s having a bang-up first year as God. I know paradise on earth was a tall order, but wow, way to take things tits up, especially this early in the game.”
After they met on the street that awful morning (how the sun could still be shining while all their people were gone Sam didn’t know, but he thought it spoke volumes about Chuck’s sick sense of humor), they drove aimlessly at first, from one place to another. To the town. To the countryside. They waited for Chuck to return their call, and he took his sweet goddamn time.
Cas straightened. Shrugged. “The joke is somewhat limited in scope. I never thought it would last this long.”
“Just because we can’t intervene in big ways … doesn’t mean we don’t do small things. I sent birds to you. Whatever bird you’d be reading about in my book, I’d make sure it was there the next time you went outside. Even those that migrate south for the winter.” He shakes his head to himself. “I knew that probably wouldn’t work.”
So cold and lifeless. Sam touched his forehead to Dean’s one more time, the heat of his tears meeting the cold flesh of Dean’s face. Had anyone ever been so lonely?
“Oh no,” Jack says. “You definitely weren’t in the veil. I wouldn’t have left you in the veil. Or anywhere else. If you’d been anywhere besides heaven … I would have launched an all-out offensive, Dean.”
The kid leans forward. “And on the down-low? It pisses off the angels when they can’t talk shit about us anymore. That’s what Daniel and Adina told me.”
“He was a remarkable human,” Gadreel says. “He was like no one else. I count myself among the blessed to have been able to work with him. To get to know him.”
It doesn’t take him long to store his belongings, put the books back where they belong, and pack his things. Just after dusk—on “the blue side of evening,” as Steve Earle put it—he coaxes Miracle into the car. They drive.
(Before Sam had gone to college, Dean hadn’t heard of Stanford. Didn’t know what the hell it was. So he went to the library to look it up on the internet. There he discovered that it was being attended by none other than Chelsea Clinton. That’s right.
He misses human emotions. At first he couldn’t understand them—the extremes of anger and sadness and despair. And desire. What an awful way to live! But when he let himself feel those things, he finally understood that the extremes meant something mattered to you. And that it was okay to let things matter, to invest yourself.
Then he sees it underneath the file on Dean’s desk—the last file Dean looked at, the file Sam still can’t bring himself to close and reshelf in the airtight vault. It’s a spiralbound notebook. He nudges it out from under the file. Picks it up, opens it.
But he won’t do this, even if he had the strength. His caretakers are doing their best, after all. They’re the ones who take him daily to the Pools of Light to bathe him and tend to the deeper, less-visible wounds. They’re the ones who procure the healing sands to massage and restructure his muscles, thereby enabling him to regrow his heart.
A little bit later, Cas gets up and Dean gets up with him. He throws on some clothes. And then he does something he’s always wanted to do—he helps Cas get dressed. Puts his suit jacket on him, fixes his tie.
, and Anna explains a lot of the jokes, since she was human for a long time. Gabriel often holds court in the front room, joking and laughing with anyone who’s around. He’s sort of the center of the enterprise, the one you can always find if you feel like chatting. The confident older brother who shows newcomers the ropes.
And it just goes on like that, giving a dumb list of all Cas’s garrisons and the bullshit campaigns they undertook. “This is bullshit,” he says out loud.
Cas doesn’t quite process this. He tries to turn his thoughts back to the Empty, but he has nothing. Only the knowledge that it was terrible and he suffered and was slammed into an abyss with enemies he’d spent a lifetime pissing off.
Dean pretends not to notice that Sam flinches a bit and squints at his computer to cover it up. He misses Jack. He misses Jack like no one’s business, and there’s nothing Dean can do or say to make it better. They lost Jack over and over again but couldn’t have imagined the final turn of events—that they’d lose him to the
He wonders if Cas is fucking with him. Or if this really is just a dream and nothing more. “Dean told me to keep fighting. I promised him I would, Cas.”
Cas assures Dean that he’ll still be there when he wakes up, and Dean trusts this and falls into a restful sleep. Cas is, of course, there when he wakes.
means that he’ll always be part of this world—the celestial realm—and Sam and Dean will always be part of the other. When they arrive, there will be a distance. He won’t know Dean in this world as he knew him in the other. Dean will have had a life. A life without Cas. Better memories. Better times to reflect on. He hopes so, but …
All Jack says is, “We need to go somewhere to talk.” And Cas knows his world is being ripped apart. Again.
“How could you abandon him like this? He needed you to be there, and you just didn’t show up, you looked away, you failed him—”
“Yeah,” Sam says. He knows Dean carries a lot of guilt about Jack—about the things he said in the end. There’s so much they didn’t get to do with Jack.
If presented with the same choices? He’d make the same decisions. But the knowledge doesn’t make him feel any better. He never wanted to cause anyone pain.
He wonders what it’s like, being there. He wonders if Cas is conscious—if he’s fully aware of what’s going on—or if he’s stuck in some terrible dream, like the Ambien dream he had, times ten. Does Cas have a sense of time?
Sam remembers the day they talked about fortune and misfortune, the story Cas told them about the 9/11 widow—about how cruel and unlucky her fate seemed to everyone else, how impossible and improbable the turn of events. That a woman who lost her husband in the World Trade Center would die in a plane crash a few years later seemed like God’s sick idea for a joke. Right on par with something Chuck would do.
“I wasn’t there when you lost a baseball game or had a mean teacher or got mixed up with a bully. I wasn’t there to help you through your first broken heart. I wasn’t there to tell you that the world sucks and that the bad things that happen to you aren’t necessarily your fault. I’m sad about that, Dean. You needed a mother.” She pauses. “You
Dean took a swig of beer and shrugged. “Hopefully on a beer run. But maybe not. Every now and then he pisses off and goes back up to heaven. Just to check in with mission control. Which I think is a shitty idea, don’t get me wrong. Heaven does not have a lot going for it these days.”
In a memory so vivid it hurts, Dean is sitting on the kitchen floor drinking beer. (His fourth? Fifth?) His pictures are in his lap—photographs of Mom and Dad, of Mom and him as a toddler, of Mom and him and Sammy. Poor Sammy: there were so few pictures of him and Mom. And really, if Dean’s being honest, so few pictures of Sammy at all, period. Dad wasn’t exactly a “Kodak dad.” No way. It was just another way they weren’t normal. Throughout the years, he’d been in and out of enough normal people’s houses to see how normal people did things—how they documented the details of their children’s lives. How they kept photos of
“She was ripped away from you when you were just—” He looked away. “Given your age at that time, and what we now know about childhood comprehension … what happened to her—it must have been your first memory.”
The thought was shattering: Cas listened to this song while understanding all too well that for him there’d be no fucking rainbow. No winter sunsets. No music or birds or gardens. Nothing of the world he loved, nothing but darkness and emptiness and endless separation from everything and everyone.
Dean doesn’t know what to say. He’s both grateful to Cas and insanely pissed at him for making such a shit deal. Heartbroken that Cas suffered. Angry with himself for not being able to save Cas, and for allowing their friendship to get to the point where the Empty could weaponize it. Furious with Chuck for the entirety of the whole fucking thing.
. Listen to me. I—I’m billions of years old. I didn’t even know what happiness was until I met you. Only in those last twelve years did I
“Cas,” he says, moving from behind the podium. His face lights up; he smiles broadly. Cas doesn’t remember seeing him smile before. Not like that, like someone purely happy.
“It’s the only way the Empty can keep us occupied—can keep us asleep. It's learned the hard way that individuals can be woken.”
“I was awful to him, Mom. I was such a shit. The things I said to him after you died. I blamed him. I blamed
Time passes and he grows stronger. He gets well enough to venture out of the fratway house to see more of the angels’ side of the celestial realm, which his human-obsessed friends have dubbed Wing Town. It’s meant to be a bit pejorative—to lightly mock the other angels who are, deep down inside, still scared of humanity. Of course, they’d never admit they’re scared—scared of
“The way I always fail him.” He lets go of the jacket so that it rests in his lap. “If only he’d just let Billie take us both. Cas could have found a way back then.”
When Miracle sees both of them together, he seems confused. He heads toward Sam—and then he changes his mind. Goes to Dean instead, and drops the stick in front of him.
. He wasn’t expecting his brethren to care so much, to drop what they’re doing to come to see him at the fratway house. To offer their condolences.
The next day, Sam woke up and wandered into the library. Dean was obviously still sleeping it off, but Cas was in the library sitting at the table, staring into his laptop. Sam could hear the tinny strains of “If I Ever Leave This World Alive,” but when Cas sensed he wasn’t alone, he closed the laptop quickly.
How can Sam possibly know that these are their last days together? That Dean will come home from Akron in a body bag? If he could know this, he would tell him what he really needs to say.
he goes with him. And when he asks Dean, “Are you sure you’re ready for this?” he’s only half joking. Sure, he’s glad to see that Dean has an appetite again. But he also knows Dean well enough to know when he’s using bullshit bravado to hide what’s really going on. And he also knows that the more Dean pretends everything’s okay, the more likely he is to blow up later on.
All the pictures he had of his family were in his lap. They were so scant, so few. The history of his life: a history of scarcity.
Sam knocks on his door a few hours later, rousing him from sleep. “Dean, you okay? Dean, I get you want to be alone, but … just tell me you’re okay.”
“It’s not,” Cas whispers. “Angels don’t cry.” Or, at least they're not supposed to. Cas never used to cry. These days, he can't stop.
He gets up to leave the room and is about to tell Sam to turn the lights and TV off, when something hits his shoulder. “Ow,” he says, looking down. The remote. Sam just threw the remote at him.
“Well, it’s like they say, shit gets real. It gets pure. Boiled down. When you’re jumping from the hundredth floor of a building because your office is on fire, you say what needs to be said. All the rest—none of it matters.” She got up from the steps to get rid of her joint, but then she paused and looked back at him. “But you know? Life rarely gives you those moments anyway. And if you think it will? You’re a kid, or just an idiot. Life just takes people from you, again and again. And maybe it’s better that way. To not get those big ‘goodbye’ moments. Because what would you say, really?”
He has the most bizarre dream of his life. He and Cas are together in the backyard of someone’s house—a house he’s never seen before—and they’re playing bocce ball. The grass turns into a sandpit. And the balls can talk and one of them sounds oddly like … Meg? It’s calling out for Clarence! And then Meg is there but she’s dressed as a clown, which terrifies Dean. But it seems to turn Cas on—though maybe
Sam would wonder how much he prayed, how he begged. How he wanted that portal to open back up, to take him too.
He knows Dean wants him to divulge the story of the Empty, but he’s not there yet. He could tell Dean the ending—that Malachi’s bomb did what they’d hoped, waking Crowley, who was able to connect to Rowena, and once Jack could connect to Cas, the Empty's hours were numbered—but he knows that’s not really what Dean wants him to disclose. He wants to know about those agonizing days and terrifying nights that defy language. He wants Cas to let him share the burden he took on. Cas wants to tell him it's not necessary, but he also knows that Dean just wants to help. Wants them to be as close as possible, no secrets between them.
“I like being with everyone I ever loved. Why would I go back?” He peers at Cas. Smiles. “Oh, come here,” he says, grabbing Cas for a tight embrace.
, they said. So he just tried to comfort Gadreel, whose extreme distress was a result of the suffering inflicted by Abner. Abner, who had once been his best friend. Whom he’d betrayed.
When he and Hannah first got caught up with each other in rehab, she wanted to apologize for that business on earth. With Efram and Jonah. There was no need, he said, wanting to dispel that ugliness. He’d already had a similar conversation with Balthazar and it had pretty much gone the same way. “You got me out of the Empty, so we’re even,” Balthazar said quickly, clearly not in the mood to dwell.
“Cas, I know.” Dean keeps holding Cas’s hand, but he reaches up to smooth down Cas’s suit with his other hand. “You don’t have to explain. I know this shit isn’t Jack’s doing. Sam knows too.”
John’s face betrays the smallest flicker of hurt, but he recovers. “Well let me walk you out, then.”
in this thing he has with Dean. Curious for curiosity’s sake, in the way that angels often are. He knows his housemates will be happy for him, but that they’ll also be artlessly inquisitive about this love thing. He imagines them together, comparing notes, highlighting the similarities between his narrative and that of
If this is the heaven he “deserves,” then he wonders what that says about him. That he doesn’t deserve a heaven with angels? A heaven with Cas? He’s been assured that Cas exists, that he’s no longer in the Empty. Bobby told him as much, but Bobby also said that Jack had been there—and Dean hasn’t seen Jack either.
“It’s more serious than that, Dean. SARS had a ten-percent mortality rate. They’re saying this is SARS but a lot more contagious.”
"So the grieving 9/11 widow just wanted to be reunited with her husband. Yeah, okay. Whatever you say."
She paused, her eyes meeting his. “He’s very devoted to you, Dean. I think—I think you mean a lot to him.”
you by confronting you with your worst regrets. But it didn’t break you, Cas. It didn’t, I promise.”
He didn’t believe anyone could love him, until he found out someone did, someone who was murdered for it, right in front of him. For him.
They don’t like to talk about their time in the Empty. No one does. It’s taken Cas a long time to remember what even
“Bullshit it’s not real,” Bartholomew said. “Tell that to my throat, which gets cut out every night.”
“Fantastic.” He folds the map in half. An unforeseen complication. Enochian reading ability required. “Just my luck.”
Through his tears, Sam focuses on Cas’s eyes. “You need to give yourself permission to believe what he said. When you do that, you’ll find your way back to us.”
He thinks about how much he’d rather be human—a being whose body has a definitive endpoint—than an angel that will live forever and ever, apparently.
“The sigil you got those suicide bombers to carve into their chests. That Gadreel carved into his chest. You’re going to carve it into mine.”
When he visits Sam, it’s in a dream, but in Sam's dream the bunker feels just as Cas remembers it, and Sam’s joy and tears are palpable too. Sam grasps Cas in a hug that feels as solid and real as any they shared when Cas occupied a vessel.
Cas is devastated by Dean’s death—but now he’s also surprised. He’s surprised by other angels’ reaction to the news.
“It's more than that, Dean. I can't explain it now, not in a way that will do it justice. There are things—things on the other side now … and those things had to be Jack's focus.”
He just keeps moving. Heaven is wild and beautiful, combining the most beautiful scenery earth can offer with some weird ethereal twist—sunlight shaded blue. Wind you can taste. One day, he longs for a thunderstorm, and when he turns a bend he sees one on the horizon. He loved storms on earth; here they’re better because he doesn’t have to worry about tornadoes. He decides to pull over and climb into the backseat. There’s even a blanket back there. (Where did that come from?) He rests as sheets of rain pummel the Impala—he always found rain so comforting on earth.
“Oh.” Cas laughs. (It’s so good to hear him laugh.) “Well, my true form is still overwhelming, so when I'm with humans, in this part of heaven, you see me as you remember me, and also as I want to be seen. We sort of meet in the middle.”
no, Cas. You don’t get to do that. You don’t get to put yourself in that category. Not you. Not ever.”
“They get very creative,” Crowley said. “They come up with a new way to kill you, every time. I have to admit, even
He tries to put Dean out of his mind. Dean is back on earth, where he belongs, and Jack probably won’t send Cas for a tour of duty there for another three millennia. That’s probably for the better. In the meantime, he has to figure out how to get along with his fellow angels. Clear his debts. Pay his dues. Ask for forgiveness and hope like hell they can move past all the strife of the last twelve years. After two civil wars and a few failed coups, he knows he’ll never be accepted by them again—not really.
Dean stiffens a little, looks down. Cas regrets bringing it up—reminding Dean of the obvious wrinkle in the course of events, the twist that’s always been there. Human relationship dynamics aren’t intuitive to him, but he knows enough to understand that Dean’s identity has always been wedded to intense ideas about masculinity.
Dean laughs again, this time pulling Cas toward him and clasping him in a tight embrace. “Cas, I’m laughing so hard I’m
Dean pulled up his knees and set his elbows against them and cried into his hands. He cried for a while. Cas sat there with him, on the cold floor, and kept his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“We kept stopping by,” Mirabel says. “You were out of it. You looked terrible. You look better now.”
And he wonders now if Dean didn’t feel the same way. Lucky, on some level, to die in such a routine accident. A year prior he’d been ready to lock himself in watery casket for all eternity; a rebar to the back seemed like a gift in comparison. And when the moment finally came—well, Sam could tell Dean wasn’t sad for himself. He wasn’t crying for himself. He was crying for Sam.
“This place is incredible, Jack,” he says. He thinks about making some crack about bringing down the properly values.
He thought about his long afternoons on the road. Listening to music. Praying at the altar of the Gas-n-Sip. It seems absolutely idiotic that he would have chosen such a thing, but also strangely fitting. Sam’s the sort of person who could roll into heaven and see everyone he ever knew within the first hour. But Dean, evidently, has baggage. Still. What else is new.
Dean flinched—almost imperceptibly. He tightened his grip on the steering wheel and then relaxed. “I told you. We were trapped. Billie was outside the door, and she was getting in come hell or high water. So … Cas summoned the Empty. So that it would take them both.”
“Do you think those stuffy British Men of Letters ever intended their reading room to be used in this way?” Mary asked, the pieces of her rifle spread out on the cloth.
He looked up at her, and her face looked so sad that he wished he could just touch her to take that sadness away. “Hannah.
When Cas first met Dean, he was shocked that Dean didn’t defer to him, or to the authority he represented. Other humans he’d known—well, once they saw his wings, they were terrified. Or worshipful of the God they thought he spoke for.
Cas understands. His son was trying to provide for him the opportunity that he’d never gotten up the courage to provide for himself. “It was human,” he manages to say. “Human, Jack.”
“It all sounds pretty intense,” Dean says. “Like Northern Ireland. Or post-genocide Rwanda. Hope it works out.”
Dean remembers when Sam went to college, tries to ignore the pang. Then he thinks about teaching Jack to drive and do other teenagery things, and how much it meant to him.
Dr. Vallens? It takes a second to sink in. The shape-shifting therapist. “This isn’t Dean, this is, um, his brother. Sam.”
“I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” Daniel says. He turns to Adina. “I don’t understand what he’s talking about.”
Sam is in the field behind the bunker with Miracle, playing fetch. He throws a stick as far as he can, and Miracle races after it. Brings it back.
And Cas. Cas is the friend Dean never deserved either, a friend who sacrificed not just his life for Dean but his very existence—his essence—with no expectation of getting anything in return. And in the moment of truth, he was left with nothing. Dean couldn’t step up, couldn’t give Cas the bare minimum of what he deserved—the affirmation that Cas meant as much to Dean as he did to Cas.
Anna said, “What makes you think that’ll even work? You’re blowing yourself up in a dream, not in reality.”
He remembers the first time he was in heaven—when Cas told him he had to find the road and keep following it. Is that what’s going on this time? Will all roads lead to Cas? Or just some?
of Mom to remember or hold onto. I don’t know how he even managed to …. I mean, look at him now. He’s just—”
He takes a few cases and solves them easily. More run-of-the-mill monsters. But no rebars for him, no unlucky lucky surprises or accidents with sharp objects. He promised Dean he’d keep fighting, so he’s doing that. But the road is empty. He remembers Dean’s favorite Steve Earle song:
Dean squeezes his shoulder harder. “You were such a great dad, though. You and Cas both. Everything Jack became, and everything this whole
Jack doesn’t stop smiling, but he also looks confused. “Dean. You’ve been here for hours. A day and a half, tops.”
“You think it might be a case? For us?” He’s typing into the search engine, scrolling through the results. Who could this be? He runs through the list of usual suspects in his head. Lucifer’s dead. Rowena’s Queen of Hell (and mass influenza just isn’t her style—too gross).
“It’s a long story. But yeah. We were there looking for this—it really isn’t important.” He takes another breath. “Anyway, we got separated, I prayed to him, I apologized. We found each other and got out. But …”
“Okay, okay.” She’s trying to calm him now. “Keep in mind that time moves differently in heaven. I know—it’s hard to get used to at first. It was hard for me at first, too. It went very slowly, and then it went fast. Once I saw Jack—”
Dean was thinking of the time they were in heaven, traveling from one good memory to the next, and none of Sam’s had included Dean or anyone else in their family, and Sam had simply said,
“No, no need for that,” Dean says. Now he does withdraw his hand to wipe away the rest of the tears. Rises to his feet. “I’m on my way out.”
“Just a park.” He pauses. “But there’s a degree of cover here, from other people and angels. It’s more …”
It was a low bar to clear, and Dean failed. He left Cas all alone in the darkest moment of his life. There are no words. Nothing he can say or do, even now.
He sets his hands on his thighs and thinks for a moment. Then he says, “I need to figure out what I’m going to do with the rest of my life.”
Crowley registered similar sentiments every day, with varying degrees of vehemence, but when it came to this pointless fighting, Cas and Crowley were indeed on the same side.
“I’m so sorry, Cas. I should have told you what was going on with them. And I should have gone to him just to tell him you were fine. I had this blinkered notion that … that eventually I could just send
He’d gladly go to the Empty again if it meant guaranteeing their safety, giving them more years to add to their impossibly short human lives. And he wouldn’t trade one day he spent with Dean—even the really bad days, when he and Dean fought, or when Dean lashed out at him and blamed him for things outside his control—for another hundred millennia added to his own existence.
He looks down at his legs still tangled in the sheets, his hands propping himself up from behind. His heart is pounding. “I killed Cas. He’s dead because of me.”
Hannah’s gaze meets his, and it’s a strange moment. Cas can’t decide if she’s devastated or unnerved or just relieved. “Castiel,” she says, and her voice sounds odd and faraway.
“Don’t second-guess yourself. You were right. The way I treated that kid. You think it’s something I don’t think about? All day, every goddamn day? I have to live with it.”
“I’m drinking because I feel like it. Because I drink every night. And tonight the floor just seemed like the place.”
Claire turned to look at him again. “You thought maybe it was the second-to-last time. Because if you’d really known it was the last time? The
It was always so obvious to Sam. Of course Cas loved Dean. Loved him steadfastly, unequivocally. And Dean loved Cas back every bit as much.
angel partner. Male angel would-be lover? In a previous lifetime, he’d have rather walked in on one of his parents masturbating to
“‘For what?’” She gives him a look that’s surprised and amused, a smile at the corner of her mouth, her eyes wet. “For my life, Castiel. What else?”
“You think it’ll last?” Dean says. Then he says: “Sorry. Again, I’m a glass-half-empty guy. The difference between us. You think everyone’s redeemable. I think everybody’s a sack of shit.”
“If I get out by blowing myself up, I’ll find my son. If I don’t make it out or survive the explosion, then whichever one of you manages to wake up will have to go to him yourself. You need to tell him that our minds are entangled here in the Empty. That might be why he can’t find me.”
That all changed the day Dean and Cas got back from Purgatory. After finishing his drink, Dean walked Cas to his room.
He takes another deep breath to continue onward. “Everything went back to normal. Like, as normal as it could be, anyway, with Chuck fucking deleting entire galaxies. We never talked about it.” He catches her eyes. “Until he was dying.”
Part of him wants nothing more than to see Dean, to welcome him into this place. But another part of him—the stubborn part of him—thinks it’s still too soon. And, well, he’s nervous. He thought he’d have more time to prepare for this day, to get himself in order. Now he’s not sure if he’ll ever be in order.
“But now I’m like, oh well. I know you’re Dean Winchester. You died saving my life. Thank you.” He holds out his hand.
Sam falls asleep in Dean’s room that night. Again. And sleeps for hours. When he wakes up, it’s dark and cold and Miracle is nowhere to be found. Poor fucking dog. He didn’t sign up for this.
“I still regret it, Dean. Just as you have your regrets. Even so, we don’t love each other any less. Why do you think things with Cas … would be so different? That he wouldn’t love you as completely as you love him? Or wouldn’t want to see you? Surely you know that’s not true. Just look around at this place. He and Jack made it for you.”
She crosses the room, bends down, and puts her arms around him. Tight. Gives him a quick but resolute kiss on the cheek. “Thank you, Castiel,” she says as she pulls away slightly, looking him in the eyes, her arms still loosely around him.
Sam wouldn’t mind forgetting some things. “I don’t think we have the budget for that kind of thing. I mean, hiring some tech outfit to data-mine ancient Akkadian texts can’t be cheap.”
“It’s a ritual,” Benjamin says.  “Which I never understood, because casseroles don’t cheer anyone up. They’re more than a little disgusting.”
“The Empty wouldn’t take Castiel then. It said it wanted to see him suffer, so it would wait until he was happy. Until he was truly happy. And then it would take everything from Cas.”
Once Daniel disappears, Gabriel turns back to Cas. “They’re weird. They are so fuckin’ weird. Makes you miss the days when we just played harps and smote dragons.”
Dean can’t look at Jack. He shields his face with his left hand. “Lucky for us, you had two other fathers.”
He can still hear those things he said, feel them in his head, and he knows that they weren’t really meant for Jack.
He didn’t say anything. Where to even begin? He misses it all—he misses everything. He misses passing those long nights in the bunker, reading or looking at the internet while he waited for Sam and Dean to wake up so they could begin the day. He misses watching over Dean while he slept, which he did all the time, even though Dean told him not to, said it was “just creepy.” He misses the smell of food cooking, even if he didn’t eat it. He misses the road. He misses driving his
“Some people sleepwalk or sleep-drive, or buy shit online or eat a bunch of food, and have no memory of doing those things.” He pauses. “Others just have … weird dreams.”
He thinks back to all the things he’d said over the years, all the subconscious defense mechanisms and not-so-oblique signals he’d given his best friend to preclude anything from happening between them. How he talked about the women he banged to Cas, even though it made Cas uncomfortable. Dean chalked up that discomfort to Cas’s being a prudish angel … but he’d be lying to say that’s
They make plans to meet at a bar in Hastings, Nebraska, close to where Federico lives. It’s a larger town, with a larger scene. Dean probably won’t see anyone he knows, so … why not. And if he’s not feeling it, he can always leave, right?
Cas had only about 30 songs on his iPod. Maybe that’s because iTunes went out of business? (Didn’t it? Dean wasn’t really keeping track.) Or maybe it was because Cas just wasn’t into music. In either case, most of the songs were uninteresting to Dean—lots of Beyonce, lots of Taylor Swift, some Demi Lovato. A little Selena Gomez. Dean kind of dug the “Same Old Love” song, it was a jam.
been listening. He can’t look him in the face so he focuses on a thread unraveling from the shoulder of his jacket. It’s funny—even in heaven, clothes get tattered and torn. Loved.
. For your death. I blamed him because he said he knew there was something wrong with Jack, but—I told him he was dead to me. I said these terrible things and he just walked out, and I didn’t stop him, and—” He’s nearly hyperventilating now. Christ, he’s a basket-case, even in death.
None of his cellmates bought this. “We’re not meditating our way out of torture,” Metatron said. Outside their cell, the sound of other inmates trying to breach the walls. Again.
After the greetings and laughter and a few embarrassing tears of joy, Dean and Jack sit side by side on the wooden steps to the front porch of his parents’ house. John and Mary have retreated inside, leaving Jack and Dean to get caught up. On everything.
“He’s not coming back,” Dean manages to choke out between sobs. Hyperventilating now. Seconds from a panic attack. “We’re never—we’re never—gonna see him again. Not even—when we die—”
He cries on a few of these excursions. He is, for lack of a better term, homesick. One time, he’s sitting next to the ice rink, watching Jack skate, and he just breaks down without warning, sobbing into one of his gloves. He never cried before, not in all his billions of years of being an angel,
“Hunting accident,” he says, trying to ignore the fact that his chest is seizing up again. “It was very sudden.” He looks through the windshield, toward the greenness of the hills. “But he’s—he’s in a better place now. And I—I was with him. In the end. I got to be with him. He didn’t die alone.”
Now Sam does roll his eyes. Hands in his pockets, he slumps against the molding at the mouth of the alcove. “I’m here because I want to be.”
He didn’t want to broadside Dean with that—especially not now. Their being together has already been a fraught and tortuous journey.
“I just work here. Eliah runs the place.” He looks at Dean. Suppresses a smile. “I’ll get you a good booth.”
Now Cas kept looking at the pictures, smiling as though he were carrying around the secret memory of something good. “Mothers,” he said, as though to himself. “They’re just so … crucial.” He held the picture of Mary with Dean, running his fingertip along the edge. “We angels, we just don’t understand.”
He realizes that Dean misinterpreted his dying words, just as Cas had once misinterpreted what the Empty had told him. He hates how those words must have injured Dean. He’d intended them as salve.
The zoo decorations are what you’d expect—or what Sam would expect, anyway. He’s never been into holiday displays or Christmas cheer. Or even zoos. Zoos just remind him that all the wild animals are dying as they speak, going extinct due to deforestation and poaching and droughts and all else. The giraffes. The lions. The last Sumatran rhino in the wild died last year. Asian tigers are pretty much gone. Polar bears are losing their icebergs, falling straight into the Atlantic with nothing to hold onto.
,” Gadreel says. “That way, we can better understand the situational context in which Castiel finds himself, and properly advise him on what to do next.”
Dean realizes that he has no friends. For a guy over 40, he’s racked up few meaningful connections through the years. Part of it was moving around a lot as a kid. Part of it was the job. And part of it is the fact that his friends tend to die off.
When they finally pull apart again, Dean says, “But I’m gonna need you to do something for me. This is why I need to get you stronger. Back up to full speed.”
at it, just as you didn’t ask the teacher if she forgot to assign homework. No, when you worked at a convenience store, you got high in the backroom and “borrowed” from the cash register. And quit before they could fire you.
He smiles. “Feel free. There are computers in the corners. Old fashioned card catalogs against that wall over there.”
Cas squinted. “My point is that fortune and misfortune are closer than we think. Luck is just luck. Your luck can be good or it can be bad. But the concept of luck itself is indifferent to what we
So when he suggests to Sam that they hit up the Pie Festival in Akron—a two-day drive—Sam goes with him. Of
Gabriel sits next to him on the couch, trying to take the edge off by making jokes. When Anna tells a funny story about her own run-in with Dean—not a story Cas finds funny or really wants to hear—Gabriel says, “And here I thought I was the biggest tart in the fratway house. Thanks for shattering the illusion, Anna!”
Other nights they didn’t say anything at all. Dean would always be gone by morning—back to his own bedroom, or out walking the dog.
Metatron rolled his eyes. “The Kardashians, Einstein. Who do you think? Everyone we put here. And others for good measure. Anyone not feeling the love.”
“Not just them. A couple other angels, too. Some you know, some you don’t. We call it a frat house.” Cas summarizes it briefly for Dean, tells him they practice doing nothing by playing pool and watching Netflix. “But Daniel and Adina are transitioning out. They have jobs. I think they really want to be down here in this part of heaven. Among humans.”
Cas ignored this kind of bluster, the trash-talking his cellmates did about his history with the Winchesters. He knew how he survived each night—each terrifying, torturous night: by retreating to a space in his mind where he could think about Dean. Think about Dean’s laugh. His eyelashes. The bridge of his nose. The times they shared. It didn’t always work, but it was his only defense.
“You could do data mining,” Eileen is saying. “You could make connections between things no one’s ever thought about before.”
But he doesn’t remember the finer details. Doesn’t want to. Doesn’t want to put himself back in that place where he had the realization that the entire thing was a dream—because it’s the same place where angels tore down the walls each night to stab him, flay him, burn him alive.
forgave me. But not just that, Cas.” He paused. “You gave second and third chances to other angels all the time. You enabled Gadreel to redeem himself. You showed Metatron mercy, and he went on to sacrifice himself for Sam and Dean. Trust me, I know these things. They’ve told me. And that’s on top of—” Jack lowered his gaze. “You wouldn’t leave anyone behind in the Empty, Cas. You could have. But you didn’t.”
Dean says he doesn’t want to know the details of Sam’s new life. He trusts that Sam will be fine, that he’ll arrive soon, and that when he does so he’ll have stories from his life—stories that Dean can hear for the first time.
“Jesus. Will you stop blaming yourself for Cas? Cas made that deal, Dean. He did so, knowing full well what the consequences would be.”
he can come back and tell us all about it, spoiler alerts or not. Me especially. As a token of gratitude. And I’ll get to write a book about it.”
He still isn’t strong enough to look in on them, to be able to monitor what they’re doing. Whatever the Empty did to him—well, it was deep. Penetrating. Enervating. Not something he can just get over. “It inflicted psychic damage,” Jack told him, last time they met. “The only cure for that is time and rest.”
Jack’s confusion deepens. “Of course it wasn’t meant to be. Nothing is meant to be.” He looks down at his hands, shakes his head. “Dean made choices, Cas. He continued to hunt. He and Sam. They went out undermanned, without any backup. They continued to take risks.”
“So is drinking your manpain. At least smoking doesn’t make you fat.” She looked at him out of the corner of her eye. “So … what
Jack stared straight at him in that way that was unnerving—both comforting and unsettling. He didn’t blink. His eyes were wet. “Castiel made a deal with it.”
Cas sat back, folded his hands, and looked up at the ceiling. “Sometimes I think about Jimmy Novak. I know he felt blessed when I found him, when I chose him. Like he was winning some cosmic lottery.” He lowered his gaze. “I know he didn’t feel that way later.”
Sam’s hope wanes. So does Dean—literally. He drops weight in the span of a month. Maybe ten pounds. He looks terrible.
. Fucking A. Sammy was going to school with the goddamned president’s daughter. “She graduated before I got there,” Sam explained to him some years later. As if it somehow lessened the achievement.)
Cas grimaces. His head is splitting. He knows he’s on the brink of saying some terrible things, but it’s like he’s in a barrel going over a waterfall and it’s too late to turn back.
He pushes the door open to find Jack sitting on the bed. Jack rises to his feet as soon as he sees Cas. He doesn’t look happy.
He shrugs. “He wasn’t there, you know? He wasn’t there when we fought about Jack, when I said what I said, when Jack overheard us. And I’m guessing you didn’t tell him when he got back. Jack probably didn’t either. None of us really had the time to stand around and say, ‘Oh gee, guess what, Cas. Dean thinks Jack isn’t family. That’s why he was willing to send the kid to the Empty for all eternity, for a shot at living forty more years, max, outside Chuck’s control.’”
“And I realize he didn’t know many people, but—” Dean’s arms are folded over his chest. He draws them tighter.
Sam’s right, he’s a hundred percent right about the way Dean treated Jack. He was indeed monstrous. There are no words.
“It’s all right. Look, Cas.” Jack shifts a little, angling himself toward Cas. “I know this transition has been hard for you. It’s been hard for me, too, I won’t lie. Things all happened very fast. For
Cas never participated. He was always trying to tend to Gadreel, whose suffering was particularly acute. Gadreel’s ordeal seemed to last longer than everyone else’s—after he’d been disemboweled each night, he got put back together slowly. Was nearly catatonic.
They have so many files. Rooms of boxes stacked to the ceiling. Filing cabinets in every room, including the bathroom. And that’s just from the Men of Letters. There’s also the vast archive they themselves have generated throughout the years—the notepads and clippings and crude drawings that make John Winchester’s journal look laconic in comparison. Sam’s been putting things in spreadsheets for years, saving them to an encrypted folder on his laptop, but there’s still no system of organization, so whenever they need information, they have to know already where it’s stored.
Cas held Gadreel’s arms, his shoulders, hoping that someone else’s presence would snap him out of it. He said, “We’re never going to find a way out of here if we don’t start working together on it.”
“We know. We know he’s out there fighting evil every day. We know he is. Still. Sam and me—we just wish we could help him.”
He’s glad his mom is in the living room, sitting in the window seat, reading a book. He needs to talk with her. He also knows that, like him, his mother isn’t one for small-talk or niceties or an offer of tea and cookies. So after they hug hello, he just cuts right to it: “I’m a dick. I mean, I was a dick. When I was alive.”
“We saw Anna on the way,” Daniel says, “and asked if she wanted to come with us, but she said she didn’t want to be a third wheel. But what’s wrong with a third wheel?”
When he opens his eyes again, Cas is still with him. “You didn’t have to say it, Dean. But you did.”
It’s a memory he didn’t revisit until after Cas died, in the long weeks and months afterward, when there were too many hours in a day. He got drunk enough to sleep through half of them, but it still wasn’t enough.
“No regular angel is automatically a killer, Anna. We aren’t built that way. But we can be programmed.”
“I don’t know about that, Cas.” He thinks briefly about his previous experiences with hell. This hell is worse.
we're the most hated, so therefore it seems natural to us that we're suffering at the hands of all the people we've betrayed. Other groups might be going through the same thing, based on their own regrets.”
Of course he knows this. And Eileen knows this. She’s suggested different possibilities. “Yes, I know,” he says, softening his voice a little.
Dean’s grief is always inversely proportionate to what he’s showing you. The worse he’s feeling, the more impassive he becomes. And right now he’s goddamn unreadable—sitting next to them in an outdoor lounge chair, staring straight ahead, a hand wrapped around a beer.
So Dean sets out on his own. But now distance is no issue. Neither is time. Dean’s barely on the road when he finds himself there, at a park bordered on one side by a river. He sees Cas’s small, familiar form on a bench under a tree with branches that reach so high they seem to blend with the sky.
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Cas said, sliding into the chair next to him. “Human beings have near-unlimited memory. You’re capable of knowing almost as much as angels.” He shook his head and looked up at the ceiling. “Literacy was the worst thing you did to yourselves. When you write things down, you give yourself permission to forget them.”
Dean kept his hand on Cas’s shoulder. “Yeah, the reason matters. Averting the apocalypse mattered. It might not matter to her right now, but it will. I know this. Trust me. If me and Sam had that kind of knowledge about our mom—if we’d known she’d given up her body to a being that saved a lot of people? Well.” Now he
He looks down at the grass. They start walking again. “The apocalypse was wrong, so I worked with Sam and Dean to stop it. I felt deeply that the nephil child was special, so I didn’t kill him.” He pauses. “I’d never felt right about killing nephilim to begin with. It felt indecent. I just … didn’t allow myself to acknowledge that until I lived among humans.” He glances back at her. “As for the Empty.” He tips his face toward her. “Well, none of you should have been there. None of
But in the kitchen they find empty cupboards and a refrigerator that’s empty of everything except ketchup and some tuna salad in a bowl covered by plastic wrap. Dean uncovers it. “It’s fresh,” he says. “But … random. Did you put that here?”
“That wasn’t the right thing, Cas. I should have told them you were back from the Empty. It was cruel not to.”
“Thank you, Daniel,” Metatron says. “Thank you for spelling that out for our friend who could somehow figure out what made the Empty tick, and yet can’t see Hannah’s longing for him, which is so huge it’s written in the sky.”
He unfolds it, shows it to Sam—shows him the bloody handprint on the left shoulder. “Cas’s blood. It’s the last part of me he touched before—” He gasps, the tears starting again. “He pushed me aside, onto the ground. Out of the path of the Empty.” He looks down at the jacket, pressing his hand to the handprint. “For weeks now I’ve looked. I have his blood, Sam.
Dean takes Cas's hand in his again immediately. “I don't know much about any of that, Cas. And you don't need to explain."
Sam recovers and makes eye contact with Dean again. “Well, that’s my point, Dean. I mean, I think we should just give ourselves a break. Stop looking for cases. Just … be nice to ourselves, for once. And not do anything we don’t feel like doing.”
with this man. He is the McAdams to your Gosling. And fate or chance or circumstance or … whatever the fuck you want to call it … has dropped Mr. Cheekbones on your doorstep again … and all you do is cry a goddamn river about how you should have been there to save his ass. Again. Which you have already saved eighty times, and with no satisfying resolution to your arc.”
“Of course I’ll come if you want me to,” Sam says as though sensing what Dean is thinking. “Maybe I’ll rope Eileen in as well.”
Sam is standing over him, and the light is on. Miracle is standing at the foot of the bed, barking. Then he quiets down.
“For that shit I said about you and Jack.” He clears his throat. “You didn’t deserve that. Not now. Not after everything you’ve done.”
“Maybe,” Sam says, his mind on Dean—not on the possibility of having to break the spine of every book in that library in order to scan the pages.
He had a feeling he was a massive disappointment to his mother. Or that he would be, once she knew more about him. He didn’t know that for sure; he just sensed it.
Jack continues to stare at him. “I don’t know what to tell you, Dean. It really hasn’t been that long. Definitely not a month. But time in heaven, it moves—”
“No, that’s—that’s not good enough.” He seemed to look past Cas. “It’s like I’m standing outside myself, watching myself say things. And I don’t know who this is. I can’t blame Chuck, either. It’s me.” He catches Cas’s gaze and then says: “I lied to myself. I lied when I said I could lose you again.”
His heart started beating harder. “And I—I betrayed friends.” He glanced at Anna. “I released the leviathan into the world, killed thousands of my own kind. Did I redeem myself? I don’t know. I still don’t know. But I’m not the worst things I’ve ever done. None of us is.”
Cas didn’t say anything, but Dean understood his hesitation: the “other people” Dean talked about? Included Mary. This had been Mary’s room, and Dean had blamed Cas for Mary’s death. (Unfairly, Dean knew. Indeed, Cas had told him something was wrong with Jack, had prodded Dean to see for himself—Dean just hadn’t listened.)
He sleeps. When he half-awakens in his hospital bed, he has a memory that feels like a dream. He remembers one of his last missions with Dean—the mission to recover the Leviathan blossom in purgatory. The mission where they were separated and Dean prayed to Cas, telling him he was sorry. Cas heard every word.
She sighed and sat back on the bench. “I’m sorry. I’m just—I’m terrible at communicating with you, Castiel. It’s never been my strong suit. I have trouble with metaphors.”
As he lies there, he can feel the thoughts of the angels working on him, their opinions—in Enochian, of course—piercing through whatever psychic defenses he has left. He shouldn’t be able to hear them, but he’s too weak to block them out.
Dean offers to let Jack drive Baby to the spot where Cas is going to be, but Jack declines, “I’m taking your dad fishing,” he says. “Or he’s taking me? Well, whatever. I’m busy, Dean.”
“Confirmation bias,” Anna said, catching on faster than anyone else, providing Cas with the vocabulary he didn't have. “We’re reinforcing each other’s belief systems, based on the information Metatron gave us.”
Dean says nothing. He doesn’t move or blink or attempt a smile. He just takes another swig of his beer, and Sam hates himself for having just done that, for alluding so irreverently to the life they’d led in the past year, the life they shared with Jack and Cas. For talking about things so casually, as though Jack and Cas had just slipped outside for a cigarette and could come back inside at any moment to order another beer, and tell another joke.
“It was to keep us all from turning into that!” Bartholomew pointed at Gadreel, who was currently doubled over, whimpering and unresponsive. “You have any idea what centuries—millennia—of fighting and killing do to an angel? Of being forced to commit genocide? To snuff out entire continents of people when the fucking archangels decided they'd had enough? Huh? That messes an angel up.” He paused. “We used to have to euthanize scores of our own kind after each battle, their mental suffering was so great. We couldn’t go on like that. So … someone found a better way.”
Gadreel. A vague memory sprang to mind: Gadreel had been in the Empty too. One of the first angels he’d seen when he arrived.
He’s no longer surprised that he’s come to know the intricacies of his housemates’ lives—or that they enjoy a degree of emotional intimacy. He knows that Gabriel is crestfallen—even depressed—that he hasn’t been able to mend fences with Michael and Raphael; he knows that Anna once dreamed of becoming an architect and a mother in the human world—she wanted to have a family and an important career. He understands that Abner is quietly devastated because Gadreel needs “time apart” and has gone to a separate part of heaven for a “clean slate.”
Sam’s face relaxes, like he could almost smile. “Thanks, Dean. I’m really glad we’re on the same page about this.”
Then he stops laughing. “But I know what you mean. I always thought of myself as an unlucky asshole. But I wasn’t. And I didn’t know that. I didn’t appreciate how lucky I’d been to get you resurrected some eighty-seven and a half times, until that one time when you didn’t come home.” He clutches the arm that Cas has draped over him, runs his thumb along Cas’s elbow. “I really thought you’d show again, and I’m not exactly a glass-half-full kinda guy.”
