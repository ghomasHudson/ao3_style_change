On his way out, after he’d grabbed his bag, he called out to her, “Thanks, Laila. See you, Beth!”
“Not the point. I wanna know what it is. If you make me go I’m not going to tell you,” she threatened.
"So now what?" Sherlock asked. A fissure of fear skated down John's spine. As long as they were talking nobody was getting shot, he didn't want to conclude this little confrontation if it ended with their deaths.
Sherlock sniffed disdainfully. “Mmm, been brown-nosing again, I see.”
John nodded in agreement.
"Oh," Sherlock huffed beside him, "Brava. Moran?"
“Do you have to work tonight?” Sherlock asked.
John should have thanked him but it was too late, unless he wanted to yell out the bloody window.
“You’re what?” John queries.
“Mmm,” he growled back incoherently, hand still in Sherlock’s hair holding him back. He tried casually sliding a hand up and down but John snarled and fell back off the bed. “You will wait!” He snapped. “You said I could have what I want, remember? Get naked.”
“He won’t.”
Sherlock moans, “That was…” but doesn’t finish, too busy melting into the blanket to articulate, but John gets the message. He reaches out for his bottle of Coke to rinse his mouth, and then falls next to Sherlock with a self-satisfied grin, simply waiting patiently for the detective to come back online. He gulps his dark sugar water and thinks the view is well worth the wait.
“I texted him yesterday about a case, he didn’t want in, was being a twat actually but he begged me an hour ago to be let into the investigation. I shouldn’t have said yes but…”
He nodded gently, saying he understood, though he was a bit curious as to the exact meaning. He watched, spellbound as John wrapped a wet hand around his own prick, moaning all the while, and then he lowered himself down. A hand came down to brace himself by Sherlock’s side and then he lay himself flush against Sherlock’s arse and immediately started to roll his hips.
John’s mirth died at that bit of information. Now all he could imagine was a strange, but frightened, little boy being dropped off out front of a terrifying gothic structure with naught but a wave and a too large suitcase at his feet.
have been a burst of earth-shattering love in his abdomen for this man, but John doesn’t let it show outwardly; no matter how honoured Sherlock is, it doesn’t mean he’s ready for John to pledge his undying devotion. He merely lowers his head and kisses him, come breath and all.
“Oh. Where did you go? I didn’t think you had any other family.”
Sherlock flinched further away, tucking in on himself. “But… I didn’t do anything illegal.”
He tugs harder, and this time he sinks down, chasing that ridged outline again. As soon as he finds it Sherlock whinges into John’s mouth and John feels himself flung backward. Sherlock cradles him as best he can but John still lands hard on the floor beneath them. It’s only a momentary shock, over taken by the sensation of a hundred and eighty pounds writhing on top of him like a snake.  He’s got Sherlock trapped between his legs but no amount of pressure can keep him still; not like John would want that if he could.
“Well, obviously.” Sherlock chuckled. “That reminds me, you never let me finish my proposition last night.”
, Sherlock added silently, which sort of disproved the correction in itself.
“What’s going on in there?” He asks, absently. He doesn’t expect a reply.
“Perfect? What was perfect about it?” John felt like he’d picked up by a hurricane, flung to and fro, and set back down on his arse.
She eyed him; a look he hadn’t seen yet. “I’ll pay if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“Would you?” John heard himself ask with no input from his brain.
“All right,” Laila leaned in to mutter conspiratorially, “how do you want to do this?”
"How could I what?! Get married to my fiancée?! Are you listening to yourself? You helped plan the whole thing!"
“Oh, thank god,” she braced one hand on the counter, the other over her heart. “I mean, don’t get me wrong, bisexual guys are hot but a hundred and fifty? That, my friend, is ridiculous.”
“Ummph,” John grunted when Sherlock tugged him down. “Not in the cab, Sherlock.”
, he supposes he could take a page from Sherlock’s book and just have them fetched.
John quickly found himself turned and pulled into an alcove between two parked lorry’s. Sherlock’s breath fell heavy into his ear and John couldn’t help but melt back against him for a moment. The danger of the moment seemed to take a back seat to the feel of Sherlock’s large hand skimming from his lips to his jaw and down his throat to rest against the base of his neck, thumb resting softly in his suprasternal notch. His other came around to rest against John's abdomen, using just the slightest bit of pressure to force John further against his lean frame. Now was not the time, he knew that, but damn if it didn’t feel good to be enveloped in pure, unadulterated want. Just the feel of Sherlock’s silky curls against his face as he ran his nose along John’s cheek was enough to make him sigh in pleasure. It wasn’t until his hand began to creep further down past his belt that John snapped out of his revelry.
“You are terrible,” he scolded Sherlock, after Mrs. Hudson made her way downstairs. “She very well might have a heart attack living downstairs from you.”
“Why do you care?” He had to ask. It wasn’t like Sherlock to ask after the local populace, unless it pertained to a case. Of which, granted, John had only been a part of a few, but it still seemed strange.
Bill wiped a tear away. “Sorry, I had to. I mean, Christ, you acted like it was this great secret. Did you really think I’d give a shit?”
“You won’t regret it, John,” he said as he opened the door. “The Tiger Palace is notorious for their chicken stir-fry. For underground Mahjong tournaments too but I don’t think you’re ready for that.”
John glanced over in shock. “You did?"
“Yes, ma’am,” he crooned mockingly. He could practically feel the narrowed eye on the back of his neck but he ignored her and moved on. Damn the woman. Sherlock meant to impress John, not to get belittled by a woman who carried a nightstick because her Daddy had ignored her during her  formative years.
“Of course not. You’ll need my feet to keep you cool during the summer months. Be serious, John. One of us has to be thinking of the future.”
John could barely breathe at that point. Only Scarlett’s return, her insistent tugging on his sleeve finally pulled John away.
Victor went on, “Don’t deny it. I won’t pretend to get it, why him and not me, but I’m telling you now, I’m done being used. Don’t call me again.”
“John, look!” Scarlett tugged on his sleeve and pointed at the Ferris wheel. “Can we?”
He snarled at the cheap shot, snatched John by his shirt and threw him into the opposite wall. The curio cupboard rattled with the force, and John snarled right back. Sherlock’s infuriating grin sent him over the edge and he ran at him again. This time he anticipated John’s move and simply moved out of the way, damn near tripping John into the doorway. The door hit the wall as John braced himself on it.
Hearing his name like that, breathy and pleading, did something to Sherlock's general ability to stay sane. He snatched John up, wrapped his legs fully around his torso and then walked them to a conveniently placed sofa. John didn't miss a beat, just hooked his ankles and continued snogging until Sherlock threw him down and leapt on top.
"It didn't hurt. It tickled," he snapped, annoyed. He rubbed a hand over his leg as if rubbing the sensation away.
John charged with a cry that would have done his Scottish ancestors proud. They went arse over teakettle over the coffee table, scattering books and an ashtray. John clipped Sherlock on the chin once but his wrists were pinned seconds later. One long leg wrapped around his and spun them into the underside of the table; John in turn bucked up, upending the whole thing, and wrenched away with a snarl. He ignored the way his wrists burned after being twisted out of Sherlock’s grip and went back on the offensive, throwing wild punches and hoping for the best. Mostly he just ended up punching Sherlock’s forearms as he blocked but it still felt good to land a few blows.
Sherlock’s blue-green eyes are trained up at him, his lips stretched wide around him, and damn if he doesn’t look more debauched than he had done when John was doing the same for him. He takes his hand and tilts John forward by his arse, telling him without words that it’s okay to move if he likes.
For some reason he stood in the doorway with his hand on the knob.
Sherlock gasps. “Fancy hairdo! What-” He cuts off when the nerves John’s been holding onto break and he starts laughing hysterically. “And whose side are
“Round about eleven usually.”
He snatched a bottle of grape cough medicine and proceeded to chug the entire contents until it was empty. A shiver wracked his chest but he ignored his instinct to throw up. Warm pride lit him in its place. John could have no complaints against
Christ, he was so deliciously flustered. Sherlock felt his pulse kick up a notch, knowing he had John at a disadvantage. He rose slowly and moved forward. John held his position, only his chin raising as Sherlock neared.
“No. Some other time perhaps,” he said instead.
John’s head turned slightly towards him from where he’d been looking at the framed periodic table on the wall.
“I told you, didn’t I? I said, don’t force me into punishing you, but you just had to push me,” John muttered as he tugged and pushed at Sherlock’s clothes, “you couldn’t just ask for a proper rogering like a normal person, you had to bring bees and stabbing into it.”
“Yes, I see that.” John hears Sherlock set the laptop aside and move on the bed; his hair stands on end, sure that Sherlock is about to stand up behind him. “You’re so busy ignoring the fact that I’m half naked on your bed that you haven’t worked out
“Sherlock! Jesus! You can’t just- Look out!”
It took Sherlock less than a second to process how she’d managed to butcher the equation this time. His arm fell over the side of the chair, the page fell to the floor, and he let his head fall back against the leather cushion. He sighed so hard his fringe trembled.
"No Hamish," Sherlock said softly, running his fingers through his hair. "Your Dads have been talking about potentially adopting a brother or sister for you is all. If you're a good boy Father Christmas may still bring you a puppy."
"Christ..." John turned a new shade of crimson. "Hopefully Mrs. Hudson takes the doors being closed as a hint then..." John grabbed the dry towel he had used the night before and wiped his chest off before wiping Sherlock off as well. "And we both know Mycroft and Greg will be back." He laughed. "I truly imagine that we will end up having sex in all sorts of places, Sherlock." He smiled. "I can already see you trying to convince me to drop my pants in the middle of a crime scene." He teased, knowing full well the likelihood of that was nil. The flat was one thing, cases were another. It was Sherlock's turn to blush then, to which he grabbed a pillow and hid his face.
"Pretending is hard." Marius said with a pout. And it was for him. He'd never truly been able to wrap his mind around make believe, which always led his father to say he was a grown up in a child's body. His mother had disliked it and tried to encourage him to pretend and be a child, but it had always been sort of true.
"Good, then I can tell you." Victor said as he moved to sit on the couch again. He was about to give Sherlock the good news when the genius himself beat him to the punch.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Christ..." John ran his hand over his face, a sudden wave of panic shooting through him. His mind began to race as he tried to come up with a plan of action. Sherlock might still be at the flat. If he could get Sherlock to talk about this he could do something about it. "I should get back; he was home when I left. Maybe..." John jumped up out of his chair and the eyes of the other two men followed him.
"I love him so much," Greg whispered softly to Mycroft.
"We'll build a fort and I'll order us some take away." He promised as the car came to a slow stop. "We're home." He said to Hamish, letting him crawl on top of his shoulders as they got out of the car. "Duck your head." He ordered happily as they stepped through the front door. "Sh, we have to be quiet or we'll wake Nanny Hudson." He added as Hamish giggled. They walked up to the flat door and he opened it. "Duck," He added again as he stepped through the door. "Come on, Monkey. Get down so you can help build the fort." He helped Hamish climb down and he laughed as Hamish began pulling out the couch cushions. "Wait for Papa to get here." He said as Sherlock walked through the door, the case file already open in his hands.
much." He looked away, biting his lip nervously. Sherlock laughed softly, in a gentle way. "You're quickly showing me that I have a whole different side of myself that I didn't know existed..." He blushed a bit more. "Good thing you seem keen to explore it with me..." He met Sherlock's gaze again, but was still a little embarrassed. Though he tried to hide it, in that moment all of the doubt he felt about himself would be visible; how much he worried that Sherlock would get bored, how little he could honestly believe that he was worthy of Sherlock's feeling, and how desperate he was to prove to both of them he was worth the effort. His mask was gone and all that was left was the true side of himself that Sherlock had so easily seen when they'd first met but that he had shoved away time and time again since then to be strong. "You're so beautiful when you get lost in the feelings we share..." He whispered, slowly averting his eyes.
He typed back,
"Are you done?" Mary asked in a bored drawl.
Sherlock thought to himself.
able to visualize was John’s glistening throat as his torso wrapped itself around a willing male partner. He’d seen it enough times, after all, chasing John through club after club, watching him drink his weight in alcohol, before throwing himself at any and all who’d catch him. Which was a seemingly endless line of cheerful club goers. Sherlock had a hell of a time steering safe, clean men in John’s direction; it was almost a full time occupation. His reward was getting to occasional witness John in his element, dancing, touching, seducing or being seduced.
“You’re good boys,” she went on, either oblivious or the greatest actor of all time. “I trust you to stay out of trouble. It’s not every day a boy tur-”
“Did you just slap me?" His left cheek stung, giving evidence to the assault. He shoved her away and glanced around, absently working his tongue around inside his mouth, tasting the fresh welling of blood from John's initial punch. “Where the hell is John?"
“Nothing, dear. Did you decide on an appetizer?” She twirled a strand of hair around her finger innocently and smiled wide.
“I’ll be the judge of that,” John bellowed back, trying for stern but it was more likely he found Sherlock’s tantrum humorous. Seconds later the front door slammed.
“It is your forte after all, bravo, but a willing throat doesn’t need to stick around after I’m done with it.”
The lack of verbal sparring was a dead giveaway but the further into the room he’d walked the real reason Sherlock wasn’t speaking became clear. He continued on, prowling forward until he was nearly toe to toe with Sherlock at the window.
“Thank god for that.” John had opted for the same, knowing he’d need a clear head for the night. Too bad no one else in the pub felt the same, since it was the last night before the spring term started. One last hurrah before going back to the grind.
By the time he’d gathered the courage, John was laying supine on the lower half of the sofa, legs dangling off the end, feet kicking to some song played through his headphones. He toyed with his phone, oblivious to Sherlock’s perusal from the doorway.
“No, apparently not,” John drawled with a side eye. “Unbelievable. I’ll never trust you again.”
was rejecting
“Large Non-Fat Mocha Frappe with a shot of raspberry and a chocolate-chocolate chip scone. Please.”
The roar of an approaching vehicle throws John and Sherlock apart as they scramble to catch sight of the newcomer.
Sherlock grunts, blowing a few curls into John’s face. “Working hypothesis. Since adjusted in light of new evidence,” he mumbles.
Mycroft rolled his eyes as he read the text. He was currently sitting in a parked car, alone, while he waited for Greg who was inside a now empty home. There were four dead bodies inside. Four more deaths to this incredibly annoying case. They hadn't gone on holiday. Greg was so obsessed with the case that they couldn't leave. Mycroft had done everything persuade him but he insisted the case was more important because people were dying. To which Mycroft replied.
"Victor how are you feeling? As in hot or cold, is the room spinning?" He walked over and gently checked Victor's pulses again, monitoring for an adverse reaction to the detox medication.
"Never again," he mumbled. John took the food with a smile.
"Let me go." He mumbled, his tone nowhere near as angry or as loud as before. The sentiment in John's eyes had cracked his anger and he felt it bleed away, along with the blissful nothingness. All sorts of dark thoughts and feelings steamrolled their way through Sherlock's head. As he spoke, he spoke in a quiet and pleading tone. "I'm not fucking going anywhere. Let me go so I can lay on the damn couch John! Or am I not allowed to do that either?" He asked, some bitterness in his voice. He finally slid out of John's grasp and lay down on the couch, curling up and putting his back to John. John let him go, shaking hard as he turned on his heels and stormed into the kitchen. He made an inordinate amount of noise before returning with tea for both of them and then stormed off into his room, returning with a medical kit.
"So do you." He purred into his ear, kissing it softly before he pulled away to lift Marius into his arms. Mycroft tinged just slightly pink but didn't respond, nor did Sherlock whose cheeks were also a bit pink.
"Focus on me, love, not them." John whispered carding his hands through Sherlock's hair very gently.
"Oh God!" He shouted, arching his back. Sherlock let out a loud moan when John's back arched because his hips rose a bit.
"I love you, cousin." Hamish whispered softly. He was comfortable and content snuggled with him. His cocoa long gone and his eyes half closed.
"Oh piss off!" Victor said rolling his eyes. "John I'm very concerned in this new behavior of his. I think Sherly must have hit his head." He tilted his head slightly.
"Yes but Mycroft is watching us too." John said softly. "We will be okay. It's alright, we have help. We can do this Sherlock." He truly believed it too, he kept saying things to reassure him, still holding him tightly. "Don't worry, it's harder for you now because you're still detoxing." He put his hands through Sherlock's hair, desperately trying to reassure him. "We're stronger than him because we're together and we trust each other. It'll be okay." Sherlock gazed into his eyes. John honestly believed that. He wished he could believe it too but all that was coming to his mind were worse case scenarios. And he kept wondering why part of him felt badly for Victor. He shouldn't, but the idea of Victor being on the streets without money made his heart ache. Having an idea, he moved to grab his phone, ignoring John's protest.
"God you're so tight. God Victor... Do you want me?" John begged, kissing both of them in turn.
"I'm alright love." John smiled and he rinsed Sherlock's hair before finding his body wash. "You know this shower is slightly pointless, because I know you are just going to make me make a mess." He blushed but grinned as he leaned in and kissed him hard.
"Later." Sherlock grunted because he had never had much upper body strength. When they entered the bedroom he sat John down on the bed and kissed him passionately. "I love you," He whispered before he turned to Victor. He lifted him up and dropped him onto the bed. "Now, let's figure out a way we can all enjoy this." Sherlock thought for a moment and then he smirked. "John, would you like to be inside, Victor?" He asked as he crawled onto the bed. "While, I'm inside you."  John's brain had short circuited somewhere back in the living room and he simply gaped at Sherlock for a long moment. He turned a few different shades of red and licked his lips with desire before he was finally able to find words again.
"I love you, John. I always will." He whispered, his tongue flicking over his ear lobe. "You taste so amazing." John's eyes fluttered closed and a moan escaped his lips.
"If you can't sleep I'll sedate you." Sherlock said in between kisses. He really wouldn't but he was still trying to stay strong. Trying to keep control of his body, which was spiraling dangerously close to out of his control. "John, do you not remember what we did last night?" He asked with a faint smile. "We had sex to the point of exhaustion. I'm still sort of sore." He chuckled.
"Mrs. Hudson is going to kill us." He whispered, still trying to stop laughing. He held Sherlock tightly to him, his face pressed against his neck, still chuckling softly. "Shall we go to bed before we break anything else?" Maybe if they were lucky Mrs. Hudson wouldn't come up for a few more days and then they'd have time to fix the table. Once Sherlock finally stopped giggling like a child, he pulled his face away and shook his head.
handle it." John whispered and pulled him into a deeper kiss before slowly shuffling into the bathroom. John flipped the shower on and slowly undressed. He stepped into the stream of hot water and let his forehead rest against the wall. He didn't know why but he felt overwhelmed, like too much emotion was caught in his chest. He took slow metered breaths as he tried to keep himself calm. He found himself worrying about the two of them, about Sherlock and about Victor. Meanwhile Sherlock nervously stepped into the living room seeing Victor laying on the couch with his eyes closed.
"We can only try." He whispered. "Check it, see what he said. I don't know what the right answer is Sherlock, but if you feel like you want to help him then we should try. He is your friend. It's what friends do." Sherlock grabbed the phone and read over the message.
"I wish you had." John admitted softly. "Do you want more soup? I didn't make too much because I didn't know if you would keep it down. How is your stomach?"
"Sure, of course, I'm sure we have some peppermints lying around somewhere." He stood walking into the kitchen.
"Beethoven." Sherlock hummed as he entered the room. He watched Victor's eyes open slowly and turn towards him. They looked like they were filled with deep sadness. "From what I recall you used to prefer Bach to Beethoven." Sherlock moved closer, sitting on the arm of the couch and watching Victor carefully. "Beethoven was always one of my favorites. But then again you used to love Fall Out Boy too." Sherlock chuckled, trying to see if he could get his old lover to smile but he wouldn't. Victor just remained tense and distant. "John's in the shower." He explained with a shrug.
"I understand that it is important. However if you want a case to get solved I have told you getting emotional about it is only going to pose a problem. You're too attached." He hissed. Mycroft couldn't help it. How come people got so attached to things? Couldn't they see being attached only made things worse?
." He kissed his cheek before closing his eyes and snuggling up next to him more.
"You did quite well, especially considering how much you've eaten the last few days." He whispered, and it was true Sherlock had eaten almost a third of his dinner. "I'm glad." And so he was.
"You're so sweet, John." Victor said, his cheeks flushing more. He kissed his cheek once more and then gazed into his eyes. "I hope he lets me kiss you." He whispered and almost as if Sherlock had planned it he swept up the stairs and into the door before they even had time to separate.  "Sherlock!" Victor shouted in surprise, quickly trying to move away from John and falling on the floor with a thud as he did. He ended up laughing at the sight Sherlock looking at him as if he had lost his mind. Sherlock however had a small smirk on his face as he looked over the two of them.
"Mummy!" The little boy's voice rang out in terror.
"Out." He lied easily, keeping his eyes hardened. Victor chuckled as he stuffed the money into the front of his hoodie pocket.
Sherlock disappeared into the bedroom, with Mycroft grabbing one of the duffels and heading upstairs to change. John and Greg worked together pulling the tables together and finding enough chairs to accommodate everyone, lapsing into a comfortable silence as they worked. John looked up when there was a knock on the door downstairs and footsteps up to their flat.
"Oh fuck!" Victor moaned, wrapping his arms around John as he felt Sherlock fucking the both of them. "Oh you two are amazing." He panted and then he his mind dropped out as his lips connected with John's again. "Oh... Oh I'm not going to last much longer," He whimpered into his mouth.
"What am I hearing about a uniform?" Victor asked, suddenly very intrigued. He pulled off Sherlock's neck clearly looking John over and fantasizing about said uniform.
"I think your Daddy should go with you and your Uncle John." Mycroft said with purpose. "That way we'll all be back here together once your Uncle Sherlock and I finish our little chores."
"You didn't do anything, John." Victor sighed, rubbing his face before getting up and walking back into the kitchen to get his tea. He used the action more as a way to break free of John's contact than because he truly wanted the tea. "You've been very nice about this and I'm the one who's acting like a dick about it. It's just... It's hard." That was as far as he could explain it. If he went any further into explaining it there was a chance he'd start crying again and he really didn't need to break down in front of John. "I don't want him upset, though. So I need get over it."
"Careful." He whispered before kissing his cheek. "You can go take a shower if you want, I can deal with my brother." He walked into his closet and put some trousers on. When he came back in the room he saw John slipping some clothes on. Of course he wasn't going to let Sherlock do this alone, he couldn't stop the smirk that spread across his face. Ever his battle partner. "I wonder what they think about the state of the kitchen since your uniform, my clothes, and our broken table lay on the floor."
"No, we didn't. Once Sherlock and John became busy with Hamish I couldn't get Sherlock to come look into the case with me. I've had people looking into this but it's just untraceable." Sherlock snorted. "For us. No fingerprints found. No DNA. Nothing."
"No..." Sherlock whispered, pulling back just enough their lips broke. "Not what I need to do. What you need me to do." He looked worried. "This isn't just about me John. You have needs too. I have never been good at meeting them but I am going to try harder. So..." He paused and licked his lips slightly, lowering himself back down so John was in the dominant position. "Right now, in this moment what do you need John Watson-Holmes?" He shook with ragged breath. He desperately wanted whatever touch John wanted. But he wanted to touch him. "Tell me what you need." John felt his heart pound at the change of position and flutter with fear at what should have been a simple question. Why was that so hard to answer? That question should be easy to answer but words were failing him. He hadn't thought about what he needed in such a long time. His needs became whatever Sherlock's were, maybe that was unhealthy but honestly he'd never minded. He ran his hands down Sherlock's chest as he tried to gather what exactly he thought he needed.
"I think it's because he thinks Daddy is lonely." He answered, seeing no point in trying to lie about it. "Do you want to eat in the fort?" He asked with a bright smile, trying to distract him from thinking about Sherlock being upset.
"You brood. All the time. You torture yourself in that head of yours. So I knew one day you'd have I break down. No one keep all those dark thoughts bottled up forever." He finished drying him off and gave him a quick kiss on his cheek. Hamish eventually fell, landing next to Marius giggling like crazy. Mycroft squeezed Greg's hand before getting up and pulling him along.
"Greg would you like to go to the pastry shop by my flat when we are done here?" He asked quietly, not trying to challenge Angelo's dessert menu but more desirous of being alone with his partner. Sherlock shot a glare at his brother, believing he was obviously trying to one up him.
"You know how to build a fort, darling?" Greg asked, not being able to hide the surprise in his tone.
"God I want to. I want to feel you so tight around me." He groaned, bucking his hips slightly. "I'm so hard for you."
"'Cause you and Uncle 'Lock go afder the bad guys, dats what 'Mish told me... Dat you and Uncle 'Lock stop the bad people." He said with pride and Greg ran his fingers through his hair.
"God you're so bloody desperate." He whispered against his lips, sweat forming on his brow. "You're mine. You always have been. I'm going to break you!" He shouted but in a whisper, grunting and arching back up as the delicious sensations rolled through him. "Oh God you're clenching me so hard!" John was an utter mess, shivering and gripping the sheets tightly. He had lost the ability to speak so he just moaned and whimpered, not able to control it. At the promise of being broken, he did break. He shattered into a million pieces as Sherlock spilled inside him. He came with a loud moan of his husband's name and then his breath was stolen from him. It felt like his breath was gone for so long he worried he would never start breathing again but finally, it was over and he could catch his breath. He panted and released his grip on the sheets.
"I want to be carried," Victor said with a chuckle as he started to walk toward Sherlock and John's bedroom, the lube in hand.
"Yes, Sir." Without any warning he pulled down John's pants and gasped at the sight how hard John was. This may have been the hardest he had ever seen him. Jesus it did horrible things to Sherlock's ego again. Knowing how much he could turn this man on, how much this man wanted him was driving him crazy. "Oh, John." He took him into his mouth without any hesitation, sucking him deep into his throat while his hands gripped his arse.
"Are they good pancakes, love?" Sherlock asked softly, his eyes still the only thing betraying his enjoyment of John's resistance.
"I'm okay." Sherlock said sort of hollowly, but he normalized slightly as John’s presence gave him something to focus on. "You should be in bed, go back to bed and rest now." He ordered, his brow furrowed. "I'm going to shower quickly to clean up. Hamish, my love, the tree looks beautiful." He forced a smile. Hamish giggled, but his look betrayed that he knew Sherlock was upset. Greg still held Marius close, lingering on the landing for a long moment. He was terribly nervous. He didn't know why, it wasn't like Mycroft would make him give up the boy... No, he'd never do something like that, but Greg feared that Mycroft wouldn't think adopting him was a good idea. He stepped into view, slowly revealing himself and Marius to everyone in the room. He smiled sheepishly at John's puzzled look. Hamish's eyes were huge as he walked closer to his Uncle, the hope on his little face at a potential new family member was startlingly clear. Greg looked up as Mycroft glanced over at him and his jaw tightened.
So here it is, the last full chapter! This chapter includes smut and m/m/m action just so you're warned.
"Prude." He retorted with a laugh. "But he does know all those lovely little things you did when you couldn't pay me, right? He has to know about that." Sherlock glared at him.
"That will be nice." Hamish said dreamily. He drifted off into whatever day dream he was having, snuggled against his father's shoulder as the two brothers' gazes met.
"I'm kissing you there because you like it." He replied, his voice humming softly in Sherlock's ear. "Because I am going to prove to you that every single touch I give you is better than anything a drug can give you. That I'm the one you've been waiting for." His ego returned full force as he spoke, trailing kisses down his neck and gently sucking on it. "Because I love you and I want to
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean make you to wake all the way up." John said softly, a hint of sadness in his voice. "I'm fine." He lied flatly. "Victor is alright I think, but he's in a lot of pain. He's in the living room listening to some music." He softly let his hand flutter over Sherlock's forehead checking his temperature. "I just wanted to let you know that I'm freezing so I am going to go take a shower. I didn't want you to worry." He ended with a coughing fit and without intending to let his weight sink down on the bed to stay standing.
Oh no, we're so close to being done with this fic. It's almost over. But don't worry, we have a Christmas themed sequel in the works called 'All He Wants For Christmas.' -Cay
"We worked together actually." Mycroft said firmly, laughing as she almost missed her chair in surprise.
"That's the way it will always be too." John blushed more, his gaze on the two of them. His heart pounding rapidly in his chest. "If you two ever need time alone together just tell me. Otherwise I'll assume any time the two of you are pleasantly engaged with each other I am welcome to join in." He grinned before chuckling. "We're mad, all of us. But it's far better to be mad together." He kissed both of them in turn, claiming both of their mouths with deeply tender, loving kisses and holding them both a bit tighter. "Same goes for you Sherlock, if you ever become unhappy just say so. I promise I will too." Sherlock smiled at the both of them. He loved them both. Not equally but he loved them both. They were his boys.
"Of course. You two are my best friends. I can't just stop coming to see you. I mean I am going to be Sherlock's best man. I hoped that would mean I would get to be the God father of any little ones you do have." John looked at him like he'd lost his mind. There was no way Sherlock Holmes wanted a child. Let alone multiple. At the look on John's face Victor rolled his eyes. "Oh come on, he secretly loves kids. He's never told
"Fuck, stop!" John moaned, grabbing Sherlock's hand and forcing it away from his length. "No, no, I want to make this last for as long as possible. If you do that I won't last long." He moved his hands up to Sherlock's shoulders and griped them tightly as he continued to move on top of him. "You want to be used? You like being used? I think you're starting to like being submissive, Sherlock. Took you a while but I think you enjoy it more than I do." He teased and when he felt Sherlock dig his nails into his hips he gasped and let out a laugh. "Don't take it out on me, it's not my fault you like it so much." He grinned down at Sherlock, knowing how much the teasing was bothering him.
"We'll take care of him..." Sherlock said suddenly.
"Give me a moment, and I will, Sweetheart.” John said with a giggle as he walked down the hall into the bedroom and then the bathroom. He was honestly quite happy at the moment. They were all together at home. It was Christmas time and despite the pain coming from his wound, this is all he could ever ask for.  After taking a quick shower he slipped on one of Sherlock's t-shirts and his own pajama bottoms before walking into the living room to find Hamish on top of Sherlock's back, riding him like he was a horse. "Good Lord, I leave you two alone for five minutes and Papa has become a horse."
"I-I can't ask him to do that," John said wiping his tears away. He felt like that was too much, they were making a fuss over nothing. "We've been away from Hamish too long and I don't want to go off somewhere without him. He gets lonely too, Victor." John pulled away from Victor to lean on the car and take a deep breath. "I'm sorry." He whispered, he had finally broken. He had just snapped even though he promised himself nothing like this would happen again. "I...I just don't know how to speak up for myself. I've never really had to. I've always been busy sticking up for other people and looking out for other people, even when I was a kid."
"I actually think that was our 'caretakers.'" Sherlock said meaning Mycroft and Greg. "Wasn't really anywhere to sit with that thing in the way," He chuckled. Sherlock hated getting dressed but he knew he should, so he settled for just putting on some pajama bottoms. Yes, that would be good enough. "Are you sure you want to rebuild it? We can just lay down in the bed if you're too tired." Sherlock offered.
"Da weal one!" He said happily, still jumping with excitement.
"Yea, I remember him telling you to give me all the hugs he never had." Victor sighed a tear falling. "Sherlock never liked holding me. He likes to be the focus of attention, to be the one being held - whenever he finally decides that's okay. Every time I tried to get him to hold me he'd get bored after a few minutes." Victor chuckled, "Which is fine, he wouldn't be him if he didn't get bored." He continued to run his fingers through John's hair, his lips moving to his cheek once again. "I love being held by you." He confessed, fearing that saying that was too much to admit. "I really do John and I have no idea how I am going to go on without it."  John sighed softly, biting his lip. Victor watched the motion closely, his eyes focused on John's face.
"Hmph." Mycroft more huffed air out than made a noise. "Desk, yes..." It was clear, though he tried to hide it that, that thought had in fact crossed his mind and more than once. "A student/teacher scenario? That implies you wish to be punished or have power over you abused." He deduced softly, watching Greg as he spoke. He tried to keep his voice even, the blush deepening on his cheeks. Greg's enjoyment doubled. Mycroft only resorted to deductions when he was impossibly flustered. "Is that what you want? Me to use my power over you?" It was Greg's turn to blush, his breath a tad uneven as he nodded slowly.
"This, of course, means war, brother mine." Mycroft narrowed his eyes but the laughter continued to overtake their sternness, leaving them almost breathless. "Don't make me sit on you again, that was unpleasant for all involved. Eat or else." Mycroft wiped the cream off his face nonchalantly as Sherlock sighed and consented to begin eating. Mycroft resumed his seat and began eating his own food, the two of them acting as if nothing had happened. Mrs. Hudson was giggling softly into her napkin as she watched the four shock faces of the adults and the two glowing faces of enraptured children.
"You don't look fine, Sherlock. You look exhausted and ill, in fact you both kind of do." Greg said and Sherlock rolled his eyes. "John, I'll go make you something. Stay here with him." Greg headed for the kitchen but before he got fully in the room he turned to Mycroft with a smile, "Settle down, Mycroft. This is the most relaxed I have seen Sherlock when he's detoxing. Whatever he and John are doing it's working for him." When Greg was gone Sherlock looked up at his brother with a smirk.
John's breath caught in his lungs and he shook hard, his eyes burning into Sherlock's. That had to have been one of the most powerfully romantic things anyone had ever said to him. It reminded him of the darkness that threatened to devour him whole and yet it proved to him that it was worth it, because Sherlock had come home, he'd come home to
"You lied. You said you would come tomorrow."
"Oh yes." Sherlock growled, not being able to stop himself from giving a few thrust into the mattress. He wanted so badly to ravage this man, to claim him and his perfectly astounding and beautiful soul. "Oh you are absolutely beautiful, John. Such strong and sexy body. Smooth skin. Gorgeous battle scars. You're perfect." He practically moaned and he couldn't hold back any longer. He had to know more of John, to taste him. He took John's aching length deep into his mouth, all in one go. Showing John the benefit of having a partner with no gag reflex. He felt John's minute reaction, how he held himself back from bucking into Sherlock's mouth and both of them groaned at the shout that tore from John's throat. John cursed loudly, it had never felt
The words wanted to be screamed, but he wouldn't let them. He wouldn't admit it if Sherlock wasn't willing to try something other than drugs. If he wasn't going to even try to rely on John to help.
Sherlock. One hint of his doing anything dangerous and I will make sure it's the last." Mycroft was serious. John ate a bit of food with shaking hands. He was sort of out of it for the moment, which Greg was watching with concern. He was clearly utterly exhausted and fighting it. John focused on the motions of eating, letting everything else fall away.
"I m famished, I haven't been this hungry since we finished our last case." Sherlock said quietly.
"Alright, alright! You two stop. This isn't about one upping each other. Christ, why are siblings so difficult." John was flustered and finished his wine rather hastily. Greg was smirking, this entire dinner was proving to be rather hilarious.
"Oh," Greg suddenly seemed to understand what exactly 'the game' was. He felt like an idiot for not catching on sooner and he actually blushed just slightly. "Sorry," He added with a nervous laugh.
"Is that so? Hm... So you want both. To be powerless and to sometimes be in control." He leaned his head to the side. "Perhaps I shall let you do that."
"I think we ought to be on our way then." Mycroft said and stood.
"It snowed on my pancakes!" Hamish said again, humming happily.
"So, does that mean you don't want to try something different?"
"What on earth did you say to her make her want to do that?" John asked curiously but it was obvious that he was jealous. "Oh you're not going to answer me? You're just going to smirk and walk away?" He asked with a laugh as Sherlock just turned away. "You cheeky...  Monkey." John said, wishing he could say bastard but he wouldn't dare in front of Hamish. He followed after Sherlock and then there stood the tree in front of him. The girl smiled and showed Sherlock something specific on the bark and he nodded. "Oh it's beautiful!" John said and it looked like Hamish agreed since he was hitting the top of his head like it was drum and screaming.
"That sounds lovely." John breathed, his tears easing a bit. "I promise I'll tell you more often but right now I am telling you. I need to be with you. Just you. Just for a little while. I feel stressed and my migraine is starting to come back." He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "I'll be okay as soon as we can get away, I promise. When we come home I'll be relaxed again." Sherlock just held John close, stroking his back gently.
“You’re late, Watson,” Professor Gregson droned when John shuffled in.
“Yes.” He snorts. “She thinks they’re swallows,” he mumbles and continues to text her.
Once class dismissed, John shuffled forward toward the man’s desk, where he silently packed his satchel with papers from the beginning of class.
"Estonian hit. Body was there before they broke ground. Unrelated."
“Don’t talk to her that way,” John growled. Sherlock attempted to pull his arm away but John didn’t let go. He’d have his apology.
“Right.” She pursed her lips at him. “You know, it’s a good thing I’m the best girlfriend on the planet-”
“I’m not aware-“
“Too bad,” John mutters, eyeing the untouchable as Sherlock goes.
John laughed outright at that. His face fell into the pillow as he imagined Sherlock texting from the couch. It wouldn’t be the first time in the last four weeks Sherlock had lied to get John to rush over for something inane.
“You think I should have kicked out their knees, snatched a gun and blown all their brains out.”
Hate.
“It’s to be enjoyed by itself, savoured without dilution. Come, sit back down.”
“Now, let’s conclude the business of the day, shall we?”
Sherlock made a study of looking as innocent as possible. John needn’t worry on that score; he radiated
“Are you in town for long?”
“All right, Holmes. You’re free to go.” His hand comes up to point at Miller. “You shut your fucking mouth.”
"How is them not pulling their heads out of their arses end up being your fault though?" Greg wondered.
"Anyway I can get you," he answered truthfully.
Try as he might, John couldn’t get the memory of Sherlock’s surprise out of his mind and he wasn’t sure how to combat the hope that lifted his heart up to eye level and forced him look. He could tell himself all day and night that it wasn’t like that for Sherlock but he remembered that first night, couldn’t forget it no matter how hard he tried, and to see that kind of blatant amazement on Sherlock’s face again…
“John,” Laila hedged cautiously.
we come,” he informed Sherlock quietly. He then sat back and continued. “As I was saying, she was a photographer, and she had this one show she did, where she took these gorgeous black and white nudes. I didn’t really like it at the time, I was young, insecure, but looking back, they were really something.”
“Right,” Sherlock agreed. “Off to hospital then?”
“All right. Can I ask you another question?”
Sherlock held up a hand. “I never said you did, but it stands to reason. You, as well as everyone else, believes me to be a danger to myself. Your moving in would be nothing but logical. You would have the security of knowing my whereabouts and activities, not to mention your own space. I would gain more independence from Mrs. Hudson and my idiotic brother with your supervision.”
the bed bugs have taken over and she can’t verbally let me know without alerting them. Guess we’ll find out soon enough.”
John smirks and plants a kiss on the top of Sherlock’s head. “Not at all. I’m sure you had your reasons. Kinda makes me curious though.”
“Sherlock, we drank all the booze already,” John pointed out wisely.
The angle changes and suddenly Sherlock is going deeper, practically licking the back of John’s mouth, and it’s so good. It is
John pinched the bridge of his nose. This wasn’t Sherlock. This was Sherlock on sex hormones; completely mad like some rabid thing. “I’ve created a monster.”
“That’s a handy skill to have,” he notes. “You got any more handy skills? Cause as far as I can tell, we’re still trapped.”
“Apparently not, no."
he understood. And so he retaliated.
Molly stepped in. "Look, mister, I know how to count, catalog, and remove vital organs," Molly growled. "If you know what's good for you, you'll give Mrs. Hudson that bottle of Talisker or I'll put your kidney where your spleen used to be. You'll live just long enough to wish you hadn't."
Without fully thinking it through, he left his post in the bushes and made his way forward toward the building. He punched in the key code, long since cracked, and slipped into the lobby quickly, ignoring the students loitering in the adjacent rooms playing billiards and socializing. He knew John wouldn’t be among them.
"Fine, but you owe me about nine new jumpers, probably a hundred mugs, and an indefinite amount of socks."
“Oh my god,” Sherlock agreed wholeheartedly. He’d just gotten off but his spent prick took full notice of the action.
“She did not.” Sherlock hiccuped.
"That dreaded curse known as boredom. Mary's out with the girls, so I thought I'd pop in for a visit. What are you up to?"
“Wardrobe,” he muttered. “Top shelf.”
John looked caught between anger and a begrudging smile. “And you intervened, did you?”
“John!” She snapped. “Trust me. One last time. Please.”
"On it," Donovan chirped and dove into the car to type it into the system. She came back a minute later with an address.
When Sherlock walked in, John was down on one knee where Ms. McCurdy was handcuffed to the drain pipe of the sink, trying his best to soothe her. The light from the torch, dropped to the floor when John had moved to help her, illuminated her stricken face, showing a ghastly black eye and dried tear tracks. John looked up when she gasped behind the rag shoved in her mouth. Her eyes were huge as she looked up at Sherlock in terror; rightfully so, Sherlock supposed. He
The tube was relatively empty when he stepped on, and the quiet afforded him another brief moment to collect his thoughts on Sherlock. He didn’t want to fight, he knew that, not anything serious anyway. Their teasing banter was actually one of the things he liked best about being friends with Sherlock, and he’d never consciously do anything to ruin that.
He cleared his throat and answered, “Yes?”
“What?” He sat up straight, affronted.
“Don’t ask,” he answered with a grimace.
They weren’t bad, objectively. Accurate at the very least. It was the softness of Sherlock’s portrayal of John, the obvious love he’d suffused the images with, that had given him away. Any artist worth their salt could tell he’d caressed the shaded areas of John’s face with his fingertips much longer than necessary.
"You can ask if you want," he tells her dryly. "I won't be mad."
John let a slow breath out before responding.  He cursed Sherlock seven times over and he knew his face conveyed this fact clearly. All he received was a smirk.
“Thanks,” he said and met Scarlett by the road as she tried to hail a cab.
“You’re like a blank fucking canvas,” John muttered against his flesh. “I could mark you anywhere.”
“Oh. I’ll just have it picked up tomorrow. I believe there’s a rental service not far.”
John, on some level, could hear the guests, their questions, concerns, but John only had ears for one man.
Victor stuck out his hand and finished the lame attempt with, “An old friend from Uni. It’s an honor to meet you, John.”
Sherlock gave a sigh and sat up straight in his seat. “I investigate crimes at a much deeper level than any Private Investigator ever could. With the police and sometimes private matters.
“Just hear me out-”
“Hey,” Miller steps forward, “I could blow those smart brains out right now, Lillian be damned, is that what you want? It’ll ruin that fancy hairdo for sure.”
“Why? Aren’t dogs supposed to be man’s best friend? What’s your problem with dogs?” He snatched the joint back, sending lit ash onto the pavement.
Sherlock popped back up, reminiscent of a prairie dog. “Rather pedestrian, isn’t it?”
“Oh, so they’re dating again?”
The decision to sit was taken out of his hands when Sherlock brought the tea tray in and motioned for Victor to take John’s chair. The sight put John off the entire idea of staying to gather information in its entirety. So much for rising curiosity. This wasn’t like the horror show that was Janine as ‘The Girlfriend’. That had been wrong from the very beginning. This was different, it was Sherlock’s past come to the present, making John the outsider, the true interloper.
Sherlock snorts. "Never bothered you before."
“Go on,” Victor snapped suddenly, “I know you can see it. Tell me about how my engagement fell apart when my company did. How he left as soon as the bank account hit six zeros instead of seven. Go on.”
“What’s wrong?” She asked when they were inside. It was clear she hadn’t heard anything yet or she wouldn’t need to ask.
“Your eyes look like mine,” Sherlock whispered to the lead actor on the DVD case. “That might’ve come in handy.”
“Thanks, mate,” he said jovially, popped another swift kiss on John’s lips and then exited the stall.
"Oh." She's trying to hide her disappointment. She glances over at her friend. "Yeah, I said you weren't. Bea was the one who...she's the one who thought, not me." She starts blinking rapidly and John thinks if she starts crying he's not going to have a clue what to do. "It's just that, I remember that night. You were so...angry and scared and you seemed so worried about Mr. Holmes that I thought..." She's wringing her hands now. "I thought you must be, and I had never seen that before and you were so nice to me, I never forgot how nice you were and then I found the blog and you were always saying how great he was, even when you were mad at him...how can you not...I don't understand-"
“That would be… helpful,” Sherlock responded lamely, mentally flagellating himself. “Though, if you could find a place of employment that would allow for a flexible schedule to work around my own, that would be best.”
of John’s hand, which he thought was weird.  The man glanced up, with his arctic blue piercing eyes, and stated, “Doctor.”
“Now, what brings you to my table?” The man asked congenially, fingers steepled and held against his lips.
“Lovely,” John grumbles. He sets the lot of it back down on the bed and instead reaches for the telly remote.
John looked pointed down at the bag of peas and back up, expecting an excuse about the unpredictable nature of ice, but none came.
John pinched his nose and said his goodbyes. He knew she meant well, had never stopped believing John was arse-over-teakettle for Sherlock, not that he could blame her, but he had asked repeatedly for her to drop it. It was painful, not to mention embarrassingly pathetic, and god forbid Sherlock should catch wind of it. John had been turned down four times now…
“Agh!” The man tossed the oak table away as if it were nothing but paper mache. “I’m gonna break your legs!”
“What does it say?” He asked between giggles.
“Never,” Sherlock answered. “Not even once. Not even close.”
“Why not?” John quipped with a grin, happy to distract her with something that wouldn’t break the bank.
“Huh?” The idiot responds. John sighs. Having a weapon had been nice while it had lasted.
He had to turn away. His hands shook, micro-tremors causing small cramps he couldn’t seem to stop.
He rolled his eyes. “How could he have? You’ve been with him since you found out. When would he have found time to let me in on it?”
Scarlett and the vendor both gaped at him as he set the rifle down.
“Thought you didn’t do this sort of thing,” he mumbled into Sherlock’s collarbone. He was enjoying this turn of events too much not to tease.
Mrs. Hudson continued to grin.
John wouldn’t look at him, possibly nervous, possibly even dreading Sherlock’s answer. “No. Girlfriends… not really my area.”
“Promise me you'll let me finish, without interrupting." John obviously didn't want to agree, in fact he opened his mouth to argue but Sherlock cut him off. “Please, I can't properly explain if you fight me at every turn."
Sherlock growls low, his cock giving a half-hearted twitch on John’s abdomen, before he rises up and kisses John hard.  They snog for another indefinite amount of time before John pulls away to breathe.
Six weeks later, John found, despite his motivation to go Pre-Med and show Mary how wrong she was, he was failing Biology and his professors had started noticing his drinking. He’d already been reprimanded once that week for coming to class hung over and had his priorities questioned.
The command was so cryptic John floundered enough to ask, “Don’t do what?”
was he looking at Sherlock like that?
By all rights he should have felt the wind on his face. That was what should have happened, since he was finally falling. He’d spent months crawling up a mountain of these moments; these stumbling blocks of body parts in the fridge, inappropriate smiles at crime scenes, rolling over each other to avoid bullets. Higher and higher he’d climbed to avoid the avalanche that was Sherlock Holmes. And now he stood at this precipice of moments, big and small, and it was this- spilled sugar on a weary Sunday late afternoon- and he finally fell.  There was no wind, no real rush of adrenaline; just a familiar warmth in his chest that spread outward in all directions. The only difference between this moment and all the rest was the acknowledgment of said moment.
He received a slight giggle at that. “Doodling,” John mimicked, unbelieving.
Sherlock knew it wasn’t the case, but just then it was like the entire pub had heard and had gone silent. One would think he'd already reached the lowest point in his already low experience with John's vehement denial, but never let it be said that John wasn't willing to get creative with his whips and lances.
"Because you're pissed and if you're gonna get sick on yourself we'd rather you not do it in front of the guests."
“Why do you say that?”
“What? What is it, Sherlock? Please.”
Here's a fun idea: Got a friend who said that hat was a bad idea even though it was so not a bad idea and what do they know? Rec this fic to them. That'll teach them to be unsupportive.
“Yes, it really is. You’re not the first kinesthetic I’ve tutored, John. This technique is quite effective, trust me.”
John let out an abrupt chuckle. “My god, you can’t think it wasn’t!”
. Well, it gets, about four seconds or so of solid contact, before Sherlock grabs John by the shoulder and shoves.
He already knew the hinges were well oiled and wouldn’t squeak, so he pushed it open slowly until it was wide enough to fit his head through. John was in bed, his back to the door, curled up on his side, with only his head visible above the blanket. The magenta, yellow, and cyan flickers from the telly painted John’s dark blond head in multi-colored hues, and Sherlock’s stomach flipped to see him look so small and vulnerable. The previous night Sherlock had dared the same, the night he’d come for his coat, John had fallen asleep sprawled atop his blankets like a starfish, remote control in hand and mouth open on a light snore.  He hadn’t looked nearly so dejected, or so it had seemed... not compared to this.
“Tell me more about your dad,” John suggested as a safe filler. “I mean, how’d he end up with a mathematician for a wife?”
Sherlock did smile at that. “She’s down at the pub on Carlton Vale. A client paid me to prove she’d been selling hand jobs to teens and, when confronted, she admitted to it quite readily. I even received an offer for one on the house for my silence. I declined, in case you were wondering. But I did ask to have use of her tent. Seemed a less boring way to spend my night; people in and out, asking to be deduced and not even knowing it. Ingenious, really.”
“Nothing. She fancies me, I simply exploit that fact.”
John's colour returned, and he glanced at everything but Sherlock. He hadn't been sure John had. . . expressed interest in that, but now it was obvious he had. So they had both enjoyed it; that was good to know, for future reference. If there was a future to explore. He had better move on.
The dresser drawer closed upstairs and Sherlock tried, and quite spectacularly failed, not to picture John undressing. An attempt to distract from John’s imagined nude form by guessing his wardrobe choices only lasted around fifteen seconds before he mentally undressed him again.
John nearly called him out on the lie, but then he remembered the poster that hung above his bed, a Nile crocodile jumping out of the water, the silly cartoon croc bobble head his sister had bought him when he graduated, the complete first season of The Crocodile Hunter on DVD on his shelf. Had Sherlock snooped in his room? Or did he remember from that first night, when he’d come for his coat? If so, why hadn’t he deleted it? He would've had to, or else he’d have wondered why John had his coat to begin with, and as John could already attest, Sherlock was nothing if not dogged with a mystery.
“Oh fuck." He jumped up, almost fell, righted himself, and ran for the door. “Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck."
Sherlock pouted. "I don't see why you're still denying me my basic right to penetrative sex in this relationship. I'm not asking you to put on a costume and let me ride on your back around the flat."
“Ugh. It was Jeremy Norway.”
The kettle had just beeped when Sherlock snapped, “Prove it.”
John looked up at him in mild surprise but Sherlock was too busy blinking away the spots in front of his eyes to be embarrassed.
The man snorts. “No, I simply observed. It is fairly simple, more people should try it.”
John shook his head. “I’ll never make it.”
"What do you mean-" Sherlock started to ask, clearly offended, until John made quick work of his zip and tugged Sherlock's cock free. "Agghhhhh."
“Yes. Oh, please. Oh, please,” he begged, louder and louder.
“I wasn’t here,” Sherlock ended up explaining after a beat.
“I heard you were dangerous,” Sherlock gives a gallic shrug, “and yet you were taken out by a middle aged man with a limp. I guess we’re both disappointed.”
Sherlock was actually having fun for a minute, until John caught him soundly on the cheek with a left hook and he cried out in shock.
"A bit. Not as much as you."
"It’s the first case post in over two years," he mumbles after a beat, hand to her waist. "I just wanted it to be good, you know? If you think it's too...flourishing...I can still edit."
"That's it," John snarled before he rose up and snatched Sherlock by his jacket and marched him out of the room. Drug him was perhaps more apt. Sherlock was certainly unbalanced, arms out, note cards flying, his legs tripping to stay upward mobile as John yanked him toward the first room they came to.
“I was offering you a job, John. Or I was going to. You offered a more pleasant distraction from that attempt.”
?” He snarled aloud to the night sky. It had been nearly an hour, what could he possibly be getting up to? Perhaps he’d been spotted and John had given him the slip, gone out a side door? Impossible. And yet…
“What happened?”
to win, so Sherlock would give up the idea that he needed to train him. That way lay madness. Daily sparring matches? He’d never survive.
John glanced at Scarlett but she just shrugged. He took her by the shoulder and steered her inside. She seemed to get a kick out of that, like John was scared to go in first, which, he wouldn’t lie to himself, he kind of was. Maybe not scared, apprehensive .
“It’s not a conscious effort, I assure you.”
John stares at the idiot, unsure if he’s serious or not. “Depends.”
Sherlock pointed his chin at the stranger’s cigarette and quipped, “Filthy habit.”
“Yeah?”
“You're so strange,” John noted aloud. The kid nodded in agreement as if this were common knowledge. John decided then, “I like you.”
Sherlock stopped on his way to the coffee table and half turned. If he was going to respond John never found out because Mrs. Hudson yelled up that breakfast was done.
“Nope. I’m ignoring you.”
“Building muscle mass by ingesting large quantities of protein,” he explains and then disappears under the blanket.
John went above and beyond the call of duty when he swiftly knocked the owner to the ground with a shove to his sternum, and then off they went.
“Platypus,” John decided, finding this both ingenious and hilarious.
. A case worth pursuing. It had been months since his last, one worthy of John’s attention anyway. Sherlock had been waiting for something good, something to sink his teeth into and tear at, something that wouldn’t net John another girlfriend like the first damned case he’d taken his partner on. He couldn’t wait to meet the individual in question, this ‘better class of criminal’ that had ensnared Irene Adler of all people.
“Johnny?” Harry answered, sounding understandably confused. He hadn’t called her on an occasion that wasn’t a holiday in years.
He merely groaned in response.
Sherlock swiped the bottle from her grasp before Mrs. Hudson could even tip any into Mary's glass. He ripped the pour spout out of the top and chugged straight from the neck. And then promptly coughed most of it out onto his waistcoat.
Molly and Mrs. Hudson immediately looked over at Sherlock, and then at each other, neither having to say a word, both knowing all too well what Greg meant.
When John is sent to Baker Street needing help with his Biology, one would assume an Anatomy lesson would be had instead, but this is Sherlock and John we're talking about...navigating their feelings is not their forte.
, John thinks.
John could be seen in his peripheral vision, shuffling. “I’ve been thinking. Lately. I need to, uh, see about getting a job.”
"Would you rather be dead?" Mary asked dryly.
John looked away from Victor’s hands. “Hmm?”
That would never happen.
Lestrade grimaced but nodded. “Yeah. If there’s something to it, you’ll see it.”
"Yes, dear," Mrs. Hudson chimed in, toward Greg, "I'd like to help, but it's too late."
"Yes, it is."
“No, looks like a Coke.”
Sherlock gasped and flung John off his chest as he scrambled to search the top drawer. "Where are they?" He snarled. "John! This isn't funny, where are they?"
“C’mon, John, you can do it. You’re ahead of the curve after all.” She grinned, knowing her wide smile was half the appeal of her beauty. It wasn’t fair.
That hateful bell. John didn’t know how much longer he could take it. Laila and the rest of the crew at Kafé Kerouac swore that eventually he’d learn to tune it out but it had been a week and a half and he was still cringing every time it went off. A real bell he might have handled but the cacophony of electronic dings and whistles together was hell on his ears. He thought about splashing hot coffee on his face about once every seven minutes.
“Sounds like fun. What’s the wife done?”
Her head comes up, her eyes open wide in shock. "No, I wasn't going to!" Followed by a grimace. "I mean, I don't know what you mean."
Sherlock groaned.
“I do nothing of the kind. If my actions had any affect on John Watson, I would know.”
“I had Aaron. You had John.”
“Oh,” John breathed, eyes wide. “It’s you.”
“She did! She said, ‘And if you don’t like it, you can lick my hairy twat!’  Left her girlfriend standing there in the hall and just ran out like it wasn’t negative five outside. I had to go get her and drag her back, the crazy bitch.”
“Sorry,” he mumbled back. “Won’t happen again.”
“To eat. I’m starving. Haven’t had anything solid in my stomach in a full day.”
Mycroft gave his patented smirk, knowing Sherlock well enough to know that belittling Mycroft’s weight meant he was uncomfortable. Sherlock didn’t allow his shoulders to hitch in the slightest, lest Mycroft read into that as well.
It's currently complete but deep in the revision stage. Chapter 1 has been edited and revised and is now reposted for your enjoyment.
"Fettuccine Alfredo, noted." Mycroft smiled, but his gaze had returned to watching John with interest.
"Oh, I can't stop. Even If I wanted to, I can't. That's how far gone I am." He groaned. John kept a very firm grip on Sherlock's arms, grinning down at him. "This is what you do to me. This is what being without you for so long makes me want to do." He was moving his hips even faster now. He had broken out into a sweat and his whole body was a flushed. "Fuck," He moaned as he lowered his head for one moment. His dominate need slipped and he groaned because he was starting to wear out. His moans were starting to sound like whines and whimpers but he kept moving his hips furiously on Sherlock. His grip relaxed as his eyes fluttered closed and he whimpered again. "Sherlock," He panted, hoping that Sherlock would understand he needed his husband to move, to take over. He really didn't feel like asking, or begging, or commanding anymore he just simply needed this.  Sherlock groaned and gripped John's hips a bit harder, pushing up into him.
"Oh, you're such a perfect, Pet." Sherlock gave him a nice, slow, tormenting kiss before he turned the water off. The rush of control already flooding his system and focusing his mind on one thing: the experiment of finding out how much John liked pain. "Follow me, love." He ordered grabbing John by the hair and tugging on it gently as he got him out of the shower. He grabbed the towel and tossed it at John. "Dry off some, don't want you getting cold." He smirked and dried his own hair off before he walked into the bedroom. He walked over to his closet to find his riding crop, digging through a few boxes as he did. "Aha," he said happily once he dug two of them out from a box. He paused a moment surveying the two of them and then looked at a colored band on the handle, he tossed one of them aside that one was for experiments with corpses. This one... Well he'd been saving this one. He stepped back into the actual bedroom, smirking broadly and his grin only widened when he found John standing at the foot of the bed. John was standing in a position that clearly said
"We're not here enough. Either of us. Can you remember the last time we got to have a night in like this? I do... It was almost a month ago. We're not doing enough for him. Only one of us is with him half of the time. It's never the both of us. He's going to start to think we don't like to be around each other if only one of us is with him." He rambled.
"I'll never get rid of you." John whispered softly, meeting his eyes. "I want you here always. I want to wake up next to you every morning, go to sleep next to you each night." He clenched his hand over Sherlock's heart. "I've tried to be okay about this. I'm sorry I'm falling apart. This isn't what you need..." John tried again to shove his emotion away but Sherlock wasn't having it.
"Apologize to Daddy for hitting him in the head." He grinned and the woman took the money from him.  "And you can have it delivered today?"
person." He let his fingers trace the lines of Sherlock's face as if memorizing it again for the first time. "But the things you do to me don't allow me to hold anything back and I want you to know how important to me you are."
"You don't have any ingredients to cook with, Sherlock." Greg pointed out with a laugh before nodded at Mycroft. "I'd love too but you're picking everything we get. Last time you let me pick I got sweets that were too strong for my taste. I don't want to waste anything."
"Daddy, I wanna check on 'Mish." He insisted impatiently. Greg crouched down in front of the fort and shook his head.
"I know, hopefully we'll be in the shower tomorrow until the hot water is gone." He said with a giggle before he tried his best to relax against his husband. He could relax. He needed to relax or he'd never get any rest. "I love you." He whispered, smiling when he felt Mycroft's lips on his cheek. He felt how firm Mycroft was against him, his skin electrified.
"Thank you, Sherlock." He said, sincerely as he moved to stand but Sherlock kept him in place.
"You two eat. My turn to get this grime off." He kissed the top of Hamish's head and gave John a kiss before heading off. Once the water started Hamish looked at John.
"Get off me." He whispered, trying his best to stay calm. "Victor, if you love me like you say you do, you'll get off me."
"Let it go Mycroft. If something happens and Sherlock slips up we will figure out something else. For now he is here and he is relaxed. So stop." There was an anger behind John's voice. sort of possessiveness. Sherlock was his, Victor could go to hell. Mycroft tensed again but Greg sipped his wine and then stepped in to try to break up the tension.
. Right now I want you to myself." Victor whispered, his hands in John's hair again. "Don't you remember? On the couch, we wanted to do this. We wanted to be alone." Victor brushed their lips together gently and Sherlock rolled his eyes. His head was still sore. If it wasn't he would try to gain control back, he growled softly as he watched them. Well, maybe he didn't need to. Maybe he could have John do it for him. He knew no matter how much John had fantasized about this moment he would stop in an instant if he asked him to.
John pulls back far enough to give him a look. Sherlock blinks back up, bemused but pleasantly flushed. It’s a good look. There’s a particularly enticing bit of Sherlock’s throat that John wants to latch onto and not let go of, so he does, thinking it’s better to show Sherlock he’s not disappointing than to tell him. It seems to work, Sherlock rolls his hips up at John again with a heady moan. John can feel the way it rumbles against his lips, his tongue, and the sensation seems to dart down his spine straight into his cock.
John frowned. “How did he get here?”
“Oi, what the hell was that?” John called out behind him. Sherlock could hear John’s steps as he ran but he ignored them as he trudged forward against the bitter wind. “I’m talking to you! Stop, dammit.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John smirked. "Liar. We've tried that, remember?" He cocked his head to the side, enjoying the view of Sherlock's long torso and legs stretched out. The scene deserved a few languid strokes of his cock in appreciation and he gave into the idea easily enough. It was hard work, keeping up the different rhythm with both hands, but he managed.
“Hmm, if I ever heard it I must have deleted it.”
“I thought… Did I fall asleep on you?”
“Hey,” he tugs but Sherlock refuses to budge. “Sherlock,” he tries again, softer, suddenly frightened that he’s done something wrong, something irreparable.
John flinches. "What?"
"No, you've got Mary to notice things like that," Sherlock throws back.
Sherlock's mouth fell open but before either of them could discuss the issue further someone pounded on the door and demanded entrance.
John tried not to smile and failed. "You are ridiculous."
“Um hmm,” John testily hummed. His voice rose up suddenly as he belted out, “Does anybody here remember Gwendolynn?”
“If you didn’t want to come over that’s all you had to say!” Sherlock snapped and then hung up on him.
“Nothing wrong with a classic,” she responded. “There’s something to be said for a good, old fashioned,
John rolls his eyes but explains without comment, “I forgot my clothes. Can you bring my bag?”
“I occupy a small position, yes.” He twisted his umbrella jovially, smug in his new position as MI6’s youngest Assistant Director of Foreign Affairs.
“As if those things matter in the long run. If I want to tell the world about how sexy you look with a gun in your hand I will.”
“Not technically inaccurate.” Sherlock runs his foot up John’s calf. “I was once kissed by a girl in primary school, before I had opened my mouth to inform her of her parents imminent divorce.”
John pulled the seat out for her to sit, while the man seated across removed his long legs from atop the table. John rested his cane against the edge and lowered himself carefully down in his own chair.
“Fine! Get out!”
“Why she assumes I’m going to immediately get caught in the opium den is beyond me. No evidence gathering, no due process, just straight to prison.”
Just before John fell asleep it occurred to him that he hadn't done a bit of studying.
“You don’t find that off putting?”
had sucked a hundred and fifty cocks I’d have been burnt at the stake.”
John looked up then. Sherlock had never seen what he’d heard described as a twinkle in some ones eye before but the look John gave looked suspiciously like it might be that.
“It’s not far,” he appealed. “Two blocks, I swear. We’ll be back before you know it.”
“Quit making tea! This is serious!” Sherlock stomped his foot.
"No! It's great!" She practically yells and then realizes her casual facade has cracked and reels it back in. "I mean I liked it a lot. I think you've gotten better since...since..."
“Get him up, get him up! Back of the squad, steady on.”
“Tell me,
“I’m serious. I have to piss and unless you want me doing it here I suggest you stop digging your heel into my bladder.”
“Unlikely, you finding a place where my body wouldn’t be found. The native scavengers would have my bones picked clean in a matter of days, even if you buried me deep. Think about it.”
"No," he clears his throat of the hitch, "I was just wondering if you'd seen the new post. On my blog."
John tried to imagine that and failed. Well, he
"Christ, Sherlock, you have to know. You're one of the smartest men in the world, how can you not know?"
“You know what I mean,” John snaps, and then takes a steadying breath. “You’re trying to help me, and I believe you really are after a drug lord, so… It just makes sense to help you.” He finishes with a decisive nod. Belatedly, John remembers the bullets in his palm, remembers he’s meant to be counting them. “Twelve,” he announces, thumbing them back into the clip.
“I... Yeah, I suppose. Why?"
On instinct, John snatched him by his wrist. It turned out to be quite fragile under his layers. “I’m afraid I can’t let you do that.”
, when you decide to run away, ask for Shezza, they’ll steer you in my direction. I’ll see that you get the help you need.”
“If I’d’ve known you wanted this,” John whispered between wet kisses and nips, “I would have started in the first night.”
John’s fingers clench, so he hides them under the table. If Sherlock were paying attention, he would have seen it.
John perked up at that, though he felt sort of bad about allowing her to feed them. She was forever reminding them that she wasn’t the housekeeper but then usually following it up with something a housekeeper
“That thing you think of when you first wake up in the morning and again just before bed.”
a teenager.”
“I thought before… Or if I was too late, perhaps now.”
“That’s all right. Little weed never hurt anybody.” He glanced down at the swollen evidence to the contrary and chuckled. “Well, almost nobody.”
“C’mon, I’ve got you,” John mumbled needlessly. “Let go, I’ve got you.” He ran his fist over Sherlock’s sensitive head, lightly brushing the crown with every upstroke the way he liked, and when he started clenching, John squeezed harder.
And then almost chucked it into the air when from behind him Laila yelled at the customers, “We’re closing in ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen. Wrap it up.”
“Give it!”
“Stop this,” John begged, no longer caring how pathetic he sounded.
He flexed his toes on the carpet and pursed his lips at the smart arse, but sat back down to pull his shoes on. “Stupid git,” John mumbled to himself. “What would you know? Wanting to be warm isn’t a crime. It’s my basic human right not to get pelted with frozen rain. Not to mention arrested for possession.”
John chuckles. “Really? Why?”
“Why?” John turned towards him, wrath and alcohol making him mean. “You want a go after David’s done?”
He glanced up. “It's-”
“Can I come in?” John asked, already cracking the door.
It was a testament to the manufacturer's ingenuity that John’s phone didn’t shatter in his hand as he waited for Sherlock to answer. When none was forthcoming he very nearly launched it into traffic. He wanted to scream, to rend, to tear into Sherlock.
“Fuck, oh, fuck,” he breathed out harshly. He was practically strangling the end of his cock as he came, bent double, arse against the wall. “Ah, dammit.”
John frowned up at him in disbelief and, again just because he could, pressed his thumb into the lump. Not hard, just enough to remind Sherlock of the pain.
John rolled his eyes and popped back up from the sofa. Fine, let them both be cryptic and dismissive. John was just getting his appetite back and the kitchen called.
John knew he looked smug, couldn’t help it really. It was nice to be better at something than Sherlock for once.
John finally reached the top of the stairs and called out as quietly as he could, “Sorry, it was heavier than I-"
Bill’s arms went wide, shower caddy swinging. “Am I not hot enough? I’ve had offers before, you know.”
Like the coward John had never thought he was, he turned and left without saying a word. He rationalized this by reminding himself that David was a chunky hooker and John was a three quarter full back.  He could be counted on to be cool under pressure and aim true without fail; not so much the tackling and pummeling. And rugby rules did not apply when doling out pain to cuckolded fools such as himself. It was a strategic retreat.
John laughed. “You don’t even know about that.”
"I worry about you sometimes."
Which brings him to the next pressing issue - normally he’d use the time in the loo to… take care of the urgent situation at hand, but with Sherlock feet from him, with only paper mache between them, there’s no way he’ll get away with taking himself in hand. How the hell is he supposed to relieve himself? Because there’s no doubt he’s going to sport this wide on for the foreseeable future. Sherlock’s nearly nude appearance just now has seen to that, mint drool and frizzy hair included.
“Sherlock,” John drawled, confused and becoming distraught. “Is this… Should we talk-”
“Yes,” Sherlock readily agreed, nearly catatonic with pleasure.
The words came so soft John wasn’t sure he’d heard them. He wasn’t even sure what Sherlock was thanking him for, but he turned and gave another smile. He found Sherlock looking back at him with that same look of wonder he’d worn before. Was he even aware he was doing it?
“I suppose. Why?”
Mycroft gave a slight shake of his head, to John’s great relief, without looking, still preoccupied with staring down the hall. “No,” he answered back softly, only just glancing at John. “You were right though, we did find him in Camden. Thank you again.”
“Mmm, it wasn’t hard, really. Sort of a ballad actually. The band sounded familiar but I couldn’t tell you the name. I don’t know anyone who listens to that kind of music.”
Sherlock nods in contemplation. "Been busy with experiments since last night."
“Royal Army Medical Corp,” John explained, though Sherlock already knew that as well.
“No, we’re not finished. It wasn’t just us falling asleep, Sherlock. You- Christ, you were doodling pictures of me while I slept, and then we had a damn cuddle together and now you’ve basically admitted I’ve been missing the obvious since day one, so, yeah, I’d say we’ve got a lot to talk about.”
“Very pretty,” she agreed, snuggling close.
“Why?” Sherlock drawled, feigning nonchalance.
Sherlock went into deduction mode right away, his long legs ate up the floor as he made his way around the dingy flat. John couldn't help but watch in awe as he mumbled out deductions, observations, and critiques about Lestrade's men as it pertained to his work, or the hindrance thereof.  He stopped on a dime and flung his coat off, as the pace he'd worked himself into seemed to affect him temperature. A near unknown phenomenon in John's experience, but damned if he took it for the clue it was.  He flitted back and forth from the kitchen, opening cupboards and drawers, to the sitting room, where he flipped through books on the mantle and coffee table. A triumphant exclamation upon finding an ounce of cocaine inside one and a roll of pounds in another and then a scowl when Greg quickly reached out and snagged both from Sherlock's grasp. Greg tossed them to the C.S.I. on duty who quickly bagged them. John nodded in thanks when Greg turned his way with an eyeroll.
“Oh, well, good-”
"You had a bad experience during your formative years. Male involved, most likely caught by his parent and threatened violently."
“Lestrade?” John asks. If Sherlock is willing to overlook the tiff then so is John.
Victor, instead of looking sheepish, slid a dark look at Sherlock, as if it were all his fault for not warning him beforehand. ‘Of course you set me up for that’, the look said. John fumed at the idea that he knew Sherlock well enough to be sharing looks.
John, for his part, saved what he could and saw that it was filed in an actual system of physical recovery, the filing cabinet, but his actions went unnoticed. Sherlock had his own filing system after all.
He glances up to comment but Sherlock is glaring over John's shoulder. He turns to see and spots a pair of teenage girls, who upon being spotted glance away quickly.
Everyone turned to find a small statured ex-soldier, with a cane gripped long ways in his fist, standing in the doorway with a look of such ferocity they all froze in the face of it.
Something in him snapped. Christ, here John was, letting him off the hook, and all he could think was - why? It was obvious. It had to be, Mrs. Hudson had spelled it out for him as plain as day, and yet, John, in his infinite capacity for burying the obvious when it came to Sherlock’s motivations, was going to brush it off like it meant nothing. How long could they do this, this ridiculous dance, wasn’t John as exhausted as he was?
“Fuck,” John shuffles further back, “Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock.”
It wasn't ideal; too angry, vengeful, accusatory. But it was perfect. Because John kissed him back.
John’s squeak of, “Murder!” was over-shadowed by Mrs. Hudson’s, “Have fun then.”
She huffed. "Who do you think let Jim in on your feelings for each other? Me, that's who. Who do you think told him how to burn the heart out of you?" She asked Sherlock.
“I can’t believe you thought I could just do a one off with you. And you think
Mycroft- "You're being obvious, little brother."
John stares in silent wonder as Sherlock jogs over to the trunk and pulls his bag out. He grabs a few other bits and bobs from the front of the car but then returns to throw the lot in the backseat. John must have had a look on his face.
John’s eyes flew open at nine am on the dot. His mobile screamed at him from the nightstand and he knew without looking that the text was from Sherlock.
John scrunches his nose. “Yeah, no, I know, just making conversation. It was lovely. You should’ve seen it. There’s this little path, dammit,” he tugs uselessly at the cuff again, “through the desert. They mark all the native plants. Very informative.”
He nearly got angry at that but guilt stayed his tongue. “Just find him, please.”
He rushes John, backing him into the far wall, near the entrance, but John easily reverses their positions, ramming him right back. Curls shake as John rattles him, and he notes absently how completely incongruous they are with the rest of him. Long lines, sharp angles, snarls and scowls, but then those riotous, soft-looking ringlets edging his face. Ridiculous.
, you bloody psychopath. Don’t think one offer of tutelage is going to make me forget.”
“Uh, yeah, actually. It doesn’t seem as bad but… yeah. Huh.” He glances out the window before it occurs to him that he’s left his cane in the rest stop… along with everything in his possession in his rental. “Shit.”
add ice.”
"Hold still!"
“No,” John drawled, “I’m pretty sure you just told me to shut up.”
were the rude one.
As soon as the train stopped he was off again, racing south toward the bustling club district. It was good Sherlock had the forethought to have bribed the bouncers so generously in the past, as it afforded him the luxury of bypassing the line out front, straight into the club without pause.
“Sherlock!” John yelped as the man’s legs went wonky for a long second and then fell hard on his arse. John dropped their dinner to rush to his side, where Sherlock groaned on the pavement.
He was glad for the extra bit of light but didn’t say so. Instead, he slid Sherlock’s trouser up until it bunched around his calf and went about feeling the bone and tissue.
“Mycroft?” John shook his head to clear it, confused by the sudden topic change. “He’s Sherlock’s brother. Works in the Government.”
So, John wasn’t angry, hadn’t run screaming from the flat as soon as Sherlock was away. It didn’t mean they’d go on as before. He couldn’t envision any scenario in which John looked at him as before, didn’t imbue every word with ‘Sorry but I don’t feel the same, no hard feelings?’ He’d already looked at his phone, John hadn’t left any texts, not even a voicemail, merely let the phone ring a handful of times before giving up, so he had to assume John had waited patiently for Sherlock to return so they could talk. Of course, he’d felt the need to fortify himself with liquor before he could do it.
John’s blatant refusal to see Sherlock’s pain had his skin itching, like it was wrapped too tightly around his bones, near splitting. He thought about it, he really did, doing the very thing he’d sworn to John just two days prior to never do again. Because the pain could be assuaged, he knew it could, it could be swept aside with a rush of liquid opiates or a powdered gram of amphetamines.  John would be in classes until four o’clock, then onto his date until late, if last night’s success was any indicator.  Sherlock could score his chosen poison and be sober again before John ever noticed anything amiss.
"That's amazing, Hamish." He said utterly astonished with the boy. "You'll be as good as your Papa if he's teaching you so young." Marius stood up and ran to the door, quietly opening to see who was in the hall, giggling when he saw Victor and Alex kissing. He closed the door and ran back inside.
"He'd find us." Sherlock mumbled. "Victor can be very... Persistent once he gets like this."  Yes, there were a few times where Victor had threatened him and acted obsessive.  But Victor never committed to his threat, although, that was mostly because Sherlock would give in before he could. "I bet he's watching us. Or he has paid someone to watch us. He knows how to use my network."
Sherlock finally comes clean about the entirety of his history with Victor after Victor comes to collect what he is owed.
"Oh if you all want me to." She blushed, flushed with pleasure as the brothers both turned to encourage her presence.
"Good boy," Greg said, still wearing the smirk as he walked toward the door.
"Perhaps it is time they were?" He countered softly and both of them turned back to their activities, their faces tight from not showing some emotion.
"Wait, just wait a minute... This isn't going to turn into some sort of competition about which of you is a better kisser is it? Because I might have to lock myself in the bathroom for safety." He giggled but blushed again.
"I'm okay." Victor assured him with a smile. "Let me see that wallet." He said snatching it from Sherlock to see who it belonged to. "Aw, Sherlock you nicked this off a seventeen year old girl name Katy." He laughed and put the wallet on the counter. "Poor girl."  Sherlock rolled his eyes.
"Oh I don't know about that. I don't know how Sherlock feels about children. It's not really something we've discussed at this point." John tried to say it dismissively but there was clear disappointment in his voice. He looked down. "You'll still come visit, right?" He nervously looked back up. Victor swallowed hard and looked away, his cheeks still flushing red. John told himself to breathe, this emotion was unbecoming of someone who was looking toward marriage. It wasn't that he was unhappy with Sherlock because he wasn't - but Sherlock didn't cuddle. Sherlock didn't offer a hug when John was drenched to the bone because he'd followed him straight into a rain storm. Those were Sherlock things...
Master. I promise to be a good pet for you. For Christmas I'll get a collar and a leash so you can train me." He offered, hoping the bargaining would allow him to have Mycroft faster.
"Sounds, brilliant I'm quite tired as well. Let's go." John said eagerly, as he pulled on Sherlock's good arm. "Come on," He pleaded, when Sherlock stood perfectly still, staring at his brother. John hated to pull the sickness card but he feared the Holmes brothers would go on all night if he didn't do something to intervene. "Sherlock, my head is hurting again." He said with a whine as if it really did hurt, which it didn't of course but he wanted his husband to come to bed.
"Well I suppose we do have two rooms and we could try to get him off the drugs..." He looked mildly confused at the words coming out of his own mouth, but he spoke them firmly. His phone buzzed and he knew it was Mycroft, he didn't even look. "If you want." He forced out, meeting Sherlock's eyes, it was a completely insane idea - one of the worst he'd had in weeks. But if Victor was someone who could affect Sherlock like this then John would do everything he could to be sure that Sherlock was able to be happy and help him. Sherlock looked confused and John couldn't tell if it was because he didn't expect John to offer or he didn't understand what John was offering. "Erm," He sighed and stood. "What I'm trying to say is that I know he's really important to you, a friend and I know that you want to help him get clean. So if you think he would even try to get clean then I... God love you, I'll help you. But if he's going to stay on the drugs you can't help him Sherlock because it'll just pull you right back in..." Sherlock knew how hard it was for John to say that. He knew how Victor affected John as well but still John was willing to let him come stay at Baker Street. To become Victor's doctor and help him with the medications and withdrawals just like he was... Well not just like he was helping Sherlock. Yes, it was possibly the worst idea either of them have ever had but he didn't care. He was utterly overwhelmed by the kindness of John Watson. Sherlock leaned over and kissed him gently, his hand coming to rest on the back of his neck.
Sherlock and Greg race to the scene of the case where the outcome means things take a drastic turn for both of the Holmes families.
"My love, when Uncle Vic leaves, I will be a little sad. But Papa and I are going away on a holiday soon to cheer me up and when we come back everyone will be happy. You'll be happy, Papa and I will be happy, and Marius will be happy because he'll get to stay with us while your Uncles take a holiday together."
"You'll be brilliant my little detective." He hummed with appreciation.
