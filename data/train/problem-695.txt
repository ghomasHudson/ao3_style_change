I close my eyes and in my entire body all I feel is his lips pressed to me.  It feels as if the sun is shining down on me, warming me.  I lift my smiling face toward it to receive the life it gives.  I wonder if John will imbue me with Vitamin D, just as the sun does.
The last two men still in the yard, doing their best to shield themselves from the rain pouring down on them, shared a plastic poncho as they slowly made their way to the prison wing entrance.
“He did leave after a bit, said he was to meet someone. And yes, he did try to ask more about you. I remember kicking Aldus under the table when he started to explain who you were; I did not think twas right. How were we to know if he had anything to do with the men who tried to kill you at the river? He didn’t need to know where you were.”
Seeing as how I no longer seem to be helping him, John finishes undressing and crawls into bed with me, his hand now caressing an oh-so-slow-to-respond penis.
“But, anniversary or not, I want to tell you because it is true.”  Because I just discovered a private part of you that sends thrills down my spine and I want to visit it again and again and it makes me love you all the more.
His dishes clatter as he places them into the sink and I cannot clearly hear what he says over the noise. I think I must have misunderstood him.  He cannot have said it.  He would not do that to me; he is too good a man.
John didn’t have to be asked twice, fumbling in the sheets for the tube that eluded him for what seemed like an eternity.  Finally grabbing ahold of it he unscrewed the top with his teeth and releasing his hold on Sherlock’s cock, he started to squirt some in his hand.
Aldus’s head jerked up from where it hung almost to his chest.  He blinked several times as if having woken.  “Hm? Huh?”  And he turned to Colin.  “What?”
Sherlock looked up from his food to John.  Regarding the features that had become so beloved, he fought to quell his overwhelming need to touch him.  To press himself as tightly to him as humanly possible.  To breathe him in.  To taste him.  In truth, to keep from kissing John be like telling himself not to breathe - twas nearly impossible to do.
“Mmmm hmmm,” I mumble, trying to wake up at least a little bit so I can stop and check on John John.  Looking down at the baby, his fist tucked at his mouth, I make sure his blanket isn’t wrapped too tightly around him.
“I love you, Sherlock, you are a part of me.  But I need to know you’re in this relationship with me, every day, every minute.  I know it has to be as scary as hell to feel things you’ve never felt, and don’t lie to me, I know you do.  But being in a relationship that will last is not about being there just when it feels good or when it’s easy; it’s about making the choice to be fully involved even when you’re angry.  Or when you’re scared.
“Come now, do not be sad, an old man I be.  I have been graced with more years on this earth than most, and a good life it has been.  But, tis something I need you to do for me.  When the time comes…” William waited until she raised her eyes to meet his.  “When the time comes, call Gareth home.  If by now he has not returned with Sherlock, tis likely he never will.  We know not if Sherlock even be alive, it has been such a long time.”
Weary of speaking about such serious matters, John’s thoughts drifted to what had occupied them when Colin had so inconveniently interrupted them.  “Thou said we should do what pleases
John stirred beside him, pressing his palm to Sherlock’s, curling his fingers around the larger hand.
He remembered something his granny, a woman who had been married to his grandad for sixty-odd years, once said: “The early years of marriage are like being a toddler again. You’re full of energy, excited for the new world. And as you make your way through it, you’ll fall on your bum more times than you can count. But as long as you remember there’s someone there to help you back up and dust you off, you’ll be fine. Just fine. Learning to walk takes two. Same thing with marriage.”
“Know what?” Sherlock asked before he had the good sense not to, mentally kicking himself for being so easily entrapped.
One day, after weeks of this new, yet not unwelcome, routine, John came to the startling realization that Sherlock had been talking in his sleep, for the words he heard nearly caused him apoplexy.
John returned the smile and tucked them, clanking lightly, into his jacket pocket.  Yes, they would be needing them again soon.  Very soon, indeed.
Watching, waiting, for more words to clear the mystery, John took the opportunity to look, really look at Sherlock’s face.  The smooth, pale skin, the dark lashes that stood out against it. The cheekbones that belonged to only the finest of Britons.  The pronounced lips that, god forbid, seemed to have ‘kiss me’ written across them.
His scrotum cupped and squeezed with a firm, insistent hand that brought him to the precipice he so desired, John tried to free himself from the mouth that enslaved him. He pushed at Sherlock’s head, desirous to save himself the further shame of spilling his seed inside that beautiful opening. But instead of letting go, Sherlock clasped a buttock in each hand, pulling his John’s hips closer, the dark head moving up and down with swift, unyielding precision.
Picking up a sheet corner, he dabs at my face.  When he’s done, I shimmy down from my sitting position to join him, my hand reaching for his face, my thumb stroking the contours of his face.  I kiss his soft lips once, twice, and a third time, lingering, wanting never to leave them.  But I do.  I am overwhelmed by his eloquent words, by the depth of his emotions and his willingness to share them without hesitation.  I can’t help but wonder what other depths will be revealed in the years to come, anxiously waiting to share every moment.
His eyes remained on John as he slowly unbuttoned his coat and hung it on the rack.  Not quite sure what to do next, he decided to do what John would; he went into the kitchen and turned on the kettle, readying the cups whilst the water boiled.
“Sherlock.  I can’t go through every little thing that could possibly irritate you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is and we’ll shave off a few hours of whatever argument I’m sure we’re going to have.”
John is standing by the bed, pulling a trouser leg on.  My eyes shift back and forth between him and the bed, and back again.
“If I may sound like a doctor here, forgetting little things is absolutely natural as you age.  I forget things all the time…and before you say anything, I know, I’m ordinary to start with, but it’s never anything important and it doesn’t disrupt my life.  I know you’ll find this hard to believe, but you
“Would you get the key and set my hands free.”  Gone was the demanding voice, replaced by a gentle appeal.
“Ahh, quite right. Not only can I not eat or sleep, but I rarely talk, not even to my best friend. And when I do, I can be quite peevish.” John’s last words to him had been something to the effect of sending Sherlock, roped to a very large anchor, to the bottom of the Thames. Clearly not the sentiment of someone who still considered Sherlock “the best and wisest man.”
had had a child.  It is an impractical thought, one far too late to act upon, but I like to believe that in some ways we did raise a child together…
“Mad he is, like a diseased dog; nothing he does need be rational.  Remember what he said to the men who tried to drown him.  But tis more than that.  He has airs.  You see it, tis obvious.  Shrewd he was, horning himself into our group, into a friendship with you.  He wants to get rid us squires so he can have you for himself.”
John searches the suite for some other “lost” item.  I imagine it is his dress shirt.  Or his slacks.  Neither of which he has yet put on, and we are set to leave in minutes. He
Twas for good reason John liked Laila.  Not only had she birthed the man who brought him such happiness, but she always saw the best in people despite the difficulties she had had to overcome.  She be a rare woman.
“Yes, John. I know.” A storm passed quickly over Sherlock’s face. “But if I don’t say it now, I might regret it the rest of my life.”
John leaned down and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s, lightly so as not to wake him.  ‘What the fuck am I doing,’ he thought to himself, but he couldn’t stop.  The lips below him parted slightly and he dipped his tongue in between them, just a little.  A little bit wouldn’t hurt; there was nothing more he needed right then than to taste Sherlock Holmes.  He closed his eyes, savoring every nanosecond of the experience, knowing he would never again have a chance like this one.
will be dead, too.  Mark my words.  We must stay together, make sure neither one of us is alone with him, tis the only way to stay safe.  And we must protect Sir John, too.”
“John!”   I throw my arms around him, hugging him to me, burying my face in the crook of his neck. “John…John…”
, you would clearly see John authored all the books himself; no one else would indulge in such an appalling proliferation of semi-colons (“So sorry, John.”).  And frankly, he could use an editor who does not appear to have learned the English language in a barrio in South America as he does not have the wherewithal to correct his split infinitives or prevent him from ending his sentences in prepositions.  But you…”
“No, no, it’s uh, it’s actually bigger than that, honey.”  John eyes shifted between me and his food, obviously tempted to sneak in another bite.  I picked up his fork and scooping up some casserole, lifted it towards his mouth.  But instead of opening it, he glared at me.  “For Christ’s sake, Sherlock, you don’t need to feed me, too!”
He had said at John and Mary’s wedding reception there would only be one vow in his life.  But he was wrong once again and glad to be so, for he would make one more vow.  The only one that now mattered, or ever would.
“What about Moriarty’s killer?  You said you would wait until you found him.  And by the way, I don’t understand why you’re so concerned.  It’s not as if you, or any one you know, are in danger.  Moriarty is dead.  He’s no longer a threat; you’re safe now.”
“Whoever stabbed you hit you on the head. You will have a headache, but your wound be a minor one.  You will be up and about by morn.”  Sherlock did not know if this be true, but he needed John to believe it.
To test his supposition, Sherlock first looked at the screen and away, focusing on the movements of his eyes in relation to his head and neck, and then he mimicked what he had seen James do. He was right. Normally, the eyes and head move independently of each other, but James’s hadn’t, making her motions feel inhuman. Robotic.
I am certain the page in front of me contains words as has, very reliably, every page I have ever read in my life, but they are a blur as my eyes flick back and forth between the file and John.  John and the file.  I have now been sitting here in my chair for hours, waiting for a window of opportunity to make my escape.
He had only himself to blame for how enticing Sherlock be.  True, after being in London a day and having made no progress in their search for Cedric, it had been a joint decision to go to Cedric’s aunt’s house.  And yes, it had been Sherlock who had said he should be the one to go; better he be at observing small things that others overlook.  And
‘He’s going to break my son’s heart.’  Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut to rid himself of the distraction.  Not now, Mum.
I blush. While I often tell myself I am brilliant, which undoubtedly I am, it sounds so much more flattering coming from him.
His fingers still on the statue, his chest heaved slightly as he realized he was touching the embodiment of Sherlock.  And it felt…good.  Too caught up in the ethereal quality of the statue to feel embarrassment, John closed his eyes and allowed his fingers to continue exploring the marble.  He knew that at times he had realized Sherlock was beautiful, but he would never have thought that to be this close, without self-consciousness, to touch him without reserve, would be so intoxicating.  He settled his palm on the thigh, the thigh that felt almost alive under his skin.   Sherlock.
John swallowed the bitterness that rose from his stomach.  What he told Sherlock be more than a lie; it be a betrayal of his own soul.  Little be more important than if Sherlock lived or died.  It took all of John’s strength to keep from taking Sherlock in his arms, holding him as if he would never let go.  From telling him he did not mean it, not a word.  Through pure will, John did none of those things, instead, meeting Sherlock’s gaze, sure and steady.
He had to speak to John’s back, which was fine, because it was so new that he’d need practice to say it to John’s face. But with barely enough air to breathe, Sherlock said, “I do need you, John. Not for a case, and not because you fetch the milk and put up with heads in the fridge. I need you because you make my life better. You make
“Living with you it must have rubbed off on me.”  He shakes his head, disagreeing with himself.  “Yeh, right.”
I cannot say it displeased me when only a few months after Katie moved out John came to visit.  And did not leave.  He said he did not like living alone.  Besides, he said, he understood the charm I saw in country life.
“Uh...” His lips pressed together, John looked to struggle with what to say. “You didn’t have to, uh, take care of me …”
Sherlock leaned into John, bringing their bodies flush, their chests heaving against one other.  Hands groped, exploring warm, firm flesh.  And the world around John disappeared, everything save for this man who thrilled him as nothing and no one else had ever done.  A man who-
“I be stabbed, too.  Look.”  Cedric walked over to Sherlock and, twisting his body, showed him his arm.
Sherlock be not deterred by the blacksmith’s reserve.  “What alehouse does he frequent when he be here in the city?  Tailor?  Bootsmith? Chur-”
I tuck the moment into my mind palace, placing it in the room which now occupies the most space…in the room specially cordoned off for matters of the heart.
I’m afraid to wake Sherlock, he must be exhausted to be sleeping at this time of day, but I scoot close enough to feel the firmness of his body against mine; I so desperately need to touch him.  Whilst I never doubt his love for me, it never fails to make my heart swell when I hear him say so.  Whichever version, “I love you” or “idiot”.
Two days ago, he’d lost his head and run in front of a bus (so he’d been told, and so the videos on the interwebs said).
He tightened the duvet under his chin, determined to enjoy at least a few minutes of this unexpected reprieve from life’s dark realities, but the fragrance of freshly cooked …
Mycroft’s sharp tone gave Sherlock pause.  Nothing was more important right at that moment than getting to his room so he could be alone to think, but clearly Mycroft felt whatever he needed to say took precedence.
What would I do with a cottage outside Cardiff? I wondered. But in the months’ time I lived there I developed a fondness for the rolling hills the sweeping vistas, the gentle (and sometimes not so gentle!) breezes. I found a vast array of botanicals I could only have dreamed to find in London; I developed a fascination for them I did not want to cut short. It lulled my into a lifestyle I never envisioned for myself. And even more surprising, a life that did not include John just a shout away.
cautiously I remove my arm from where it drapes over him.  He does not move; he continues to sleep.  I slink down the length of him, the sheet covering my head as I dip lower.  Lower.  Lower until my face is just in front of the concave in his back that has caused me so much consternation since I first touched it.  I gingerly pull his t-shirt from his body and press my mouth lightly to his skin.  He still does not stir.
The second time he heard his name, John’s vision cleared enough to see Colin be immobile, his hands at his sides.
Their attempt to themselves free Sherlock would have been laughable had either had the spirit to laugh.  As Colin had said, the gaol, and Sherlock, had been well guarded.  Each time they had neared it, five guards loaded with weaponry barred their advance.
Sherlock sucked in a lung full of air and breathed it back out slowly, as winded as if he’d run a mile at breakneck speed, but it must have been that in those brief moments it took to get and send the picture he had forgotten to breath.
Colin reached for her hand, and she set the shirt aside to hold his hand between hers.  His hands were so very much like hers, rough from work, graced with long, slender fingers.  Strong hands that laboured to bring food to their table, put a roof over their head.  But he did not have knobby joints, swollen and painful from age as did she.  Oh, to be young again.
“I’ve got a taser in here. I’ll use it,” she said, unclasping the flap on the bag and putting her hand inside.
He hesitated before finally walking over and sitting down on the sofa, reclining to let John pull the covers over him.  This really wasn’t
On the other side of the doors they entered an enormous room, easily the same expanse of the house.   It was a room filled with odd artifacts…and rows and rows of large gunmetal gray filing cabinets; there must have been at least a hundred of them.  Cabinets filled with thick files, all meticulously labeled with the names of, presumably, victims Magnussen had blackmailed over the years.  The files held pages of data ranging from financial histories to known associates, to the names of the pets they had had as children.  There were thousands of files, including one labeled ‘Mary Morstan’.
He felt a chill run through his body that matched the sudden coldness he felt in his heart.  He would not allow himself to be fooled.  Not again.
Colin’s gaze flitted to the fire. Smoke curled around the edges of the oil cloth covering it, disappearing into the misty rain.
Taking several snaps up close and one with a broader view, Sherlock glided in an arc around the body, securing multiple angles.
His frustration growing at not joining Andi and Sherlock, John bounced his fist on his thigh, waiting for Sherlock to respond. In a desolate, dodgy part of the city with a mad man on the loose, Sherlock (
I am not quite sure what I am getting myself into, but if it is good enough for John, it may be relatively so for me.  And since it is clearly not life-threatening, then it would not hurt for me to know what it was I put John through.  I have little doubt it will not be nearly as interesting on the receiving end as it was for me to do.
“Where is he?” Looking around once again, Sherlock turned slowly in an effort to keep the thrumming in his head to a dull roar.  No John in sight.
“It was only a minute ago, Sherlock, of course I do.”  John held his breath, waiting for the ceiling to cave in on him.
He lies there for some time without answering, his eyes once again closed, and I wonder if he has fallen back asleep.
John’s mother?  Alive all this time? He has never mentioned her; I assumed she passed before we met and I never felt the need to bring the subject up.
Sherlock awoke with a start, blurrily reading that his watch said 1:38 p.m. Blinking the sleep from his eyes, he pushed himself up in the chair and looked in John’s direction, relief hitting him as he saw John say a few words to the nurse.
“Señores!  Disculpame. Disclupame.  Lo ciento,” she apologises over and over as she backs out of the door, somehow having the presence of mind to grab the Do Not Disturb placard and take it with her.
“I’d be nervous, too,” Ella said, her gaze direct and unwavering, “if I were fabricating a story in an attempt to obtain information I legally have no right to.” After a long pause as she waited for Sherlock to respond, when he did not, she asked, “Are you in love with Dr. Watson?”
“You will pay for this, Norman.  You will not know when.  It may be today; it may be tomorrow.  It may be a year from now.  But I vow to you, as I live and breathe, you will pay for this.”
to be dangerous.  Why think you Sherlock killed Eduard?  Sir John says tis because you be shocked.  You need someone to blame.”
I am exhausted from all the praise I give him.  I had best be careful; I do not want to give him a big head.
“As far as I am able to determine, I have never felt lust.  When I come across media or overhear conversations discussing this irresistible physical urge for another person, I have no clue what they are talking about.  I know when I think about touching you or kissing you, I have a sense of anticipation, a longing for you, but I cannot say it is lust.  This is most embarrassing to say to you, but I think it more possible for me to swoon than to…reach for your genitals.”
Outside one more time, Sherlock sucked the smoke deep into his lungs, waiting for the pleasurable pain it would bring him.  Waiting for the smoke to swirl out his nostrils, wondering why he ever gave up the habit.  Nothing calmed him, swept the cobwebs from his brain, quite like a good dose of nicotine.  He didn’t care if it
Three seconds later he rapped again.  This time harder.  No response.  He looked up and down the hallway, not knowing what he was looking for, but seeing no one, he dropped his arm and headed toward the exit.
Reeling, John’s hand flopped down beside him on the bed. If he’d had the energy, he’d punch the mattress.
Nika realized that Mr. Holmes hadn’t said what services he required from her. Had there been another accident? Did Dr. Watson need her care? But neither of those required discretion tighter than—
“I be showing him how to hold himself,” Aldus whinged. “All I did was position his arms.  I have no idea why he be so angry.”
When I look down I feel myself grow pale at the sight of the knife sticking out of his sandal, millimeters from his toe.  Perhaps in my enthusiasm my calculations were slightly off.  Perhaps.
“I’ve gotta go.”  He lets go of my hand, tugging on the lapel of my coat and patting it back into place.
To anyone else there would be nothing distinctive about it. A plain, off-white, business-size envelope, the crease on the corner flattened by the heft of the book it lay under for nearly a year.  Never sealed, there had been no need to tear it open, leaving it in almost perfect condition.
Holding it by its ends, Sherlock recalled the information on Mary’s memory stick, pondering the implications of the chosen weapon with dread.
“I know this sounds silly coming from someone my age, but it just kind of…happened.  After you left the cottage a few weeks ago, Sherlock and I started talking about getting older and what things we hadn’t done in life that we regretted not having done, and your Uncle Sherlock said he regretted never having kissed me…”
“I turned on one of your memories before showing it to you, and,” Sherlock opened his laptop. “When I clicked on it, it wasn’t yours, it was a memory from the cabbie who took me to Hackney. I had him wait for me because you can never get a ride that time of night, especially in the less savory boroughs. It was the perfect opportunity to not only implant me but also to implant someone else who would be connected to me for a period of time. Simon seems to be particularly fascinated by me, a condition I can appreciate, though the lengths to which he goes to stay in contact are quite unusual.”
“It feels like our home.  The castle would be fine, but we both think tis an austerity to it that does not suit us.  I mean no offence.”
A quaver in his voice, Colin tried again.  “Sher-” But this time twas not Sherlock’s words which cut him off, twas the look on his face.  Though Colin could not see it clearly, he saw enough to know that twas not the time to talk, let alone to divulge a secret about which Sherlock would likely not be happy.  He did not seem the type to endure the attachments of a family.
Following John up the ladder, I do not rue one particular change in my life since first kissing him, my reduced capacity to focus.  Ever since our first kiss I find I have difficulty concentrating on anything.  Anything but John, that is.  And as we climb the ladder, though we could be in mortal danger, for a few moments there is little I can think of but the arse in front of me.  Oh how I enjoy being married!
But what he saw looked all too real. Fantastical, but real. Mike Stamford stood at the end of his bed. Beaming at Sherlock as if he’d been invited to the queen’s tea. Draped in a billowing white nightdress, night cap—with pompom—hanging to his shoulder, and a Victorian candlestick—candle lit, Stamford looked to have escaped from one of those cloyingly sentimental holiday movies John insisted Sherlock watch with him.
“I remember because every “little” thing you say is important.  So what would you like to do? We could find a small flat near Katie and Paul and then we can see little Jo-, I mean, hmmm, John John, anytime you like.”
So quickly do I stop I almost fall over.  Did I hear him right?  I twist to look at him.  The set of John’s face tells me he is not joking.
Gently Sherlock asked, “Have you seen John?”  He took another tissue and stretched his arm out, handing it to her in preparation for another possible bout of tears.
“My family and I have been estranged for years,” Sherlock added in an attempt to curb that line of questioning.
“Does thou truly think thou be a Prince or the son of a nobleman?”  As much as John wanted Sherlock’s illusions to be true for his sake, in John’s mind the likelihood was as slim as finding a fabled unicorn.
My soon-to-be husband, more handsome than any man has a right to be, is dressed in a deep blue suit with matching waistcoat, white shirt, and baby blue tie.  I am dressed the same, but on him the suit looks regal; on me it looks like I’m set to give a speech at a medical conference on birthing methods.
I look around where he lies; I see no live wires dangling about.  Perhaps he has already hidden it under the covers.
His eyes still locked on Sherlock’s, John breathed heavily through his nostrils for several moments, steadying himself.  Nodding curtly, “All right, then, let’s take a look at the possibility he
And where were his gloves?  The last he could remember they had still been on his hands.  Pulling the square out of Mycroft’s breast pocket, he wiped his hand as clean as he could, tossing the sullied kerchief onto the patio.
Footsteps outside the door, the handle creaking as it turned, startled them into taking quick steps away from each other to conceal the damning evidence of their affections.
He remained seated, watching the clock on the wall, ignoring the chaos that resulted from the mysterious boom.  Ten, nine, eight… he counted slowly until he reached ‘one’.  The facility alarm went off, alerting those present of imminent danger.  A little late for that, Sherlock thought wryly.  More importantly, the alarm signaled that the locks on the prison doors were now deactivated.  Looking over to where John milled with several others in apparent confusion about what to do, he caught his eye and tilted his head toward the door.
Walking into the Sculpture Gallery, John was overwhelmed by the plethora of sculptures.  Most museums he had ever visited spaced their pieces well away  each other in order to give each piece the opportunity to be viewed and experienced individually, as if they each had lives of their own.  But not at Liverpool’s Walker Gallery.
“Surely she isn’t destitute if she lives in one of those homes. They must be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.”
Unable to contain the bubble of happiness that’s been riding under the surface all day, I grin.  “Yeh, you know, I think maybe you’re right.”
Sherlock asserted that yes, indeed John needed to go.  “Tracy Williams is a very private individual and it’s almost impossible to catch her in public.  Arranging to meet her in private is doubly so.  I need you to do this, John.  You know I am unable go, one of us has to get up to Cornwall and you are the one who has a way with the women…or so you tell me.  You are the obvious one to try to get sensitive information out of her. ”
Despite being uncomfortable with such sentiments and even more uncomfortable with expressing them, John knew he couldn’t leave it there.  Couldn’t let Sherlock think that though his love would never be similarly returned, that he was not necessary to John.
He could hear Sherlock’s voice in his head~ “As much as you’d like to think of yourself as essential, John, you would be delusional to think your presence is necessary.  I am well-trained in the martial arts; your unease is misplaced.”
discussion.  Not now.   Her tactic couldn’t have been better planned; had she pushed him he would have left.  Had she played the affronted spouse the response would have been the same.  As long as he was living in the same flat with her she had hope that he might come around.  John understood that and allowed her to wonder, getting the smallest amount of satisfaction in letting her do so.
Andi fixated on her own copy of the photograph, interpreting Dr. Juma’s “trust” as an implied threat. “Do you think it’s time we release the photo? It wouldn’t be necessary to divulge the actual reason we’re looking for him; we could use a benign explanation, say he’s a missing person. Which wouldn’t be a lie. Put it on social media, say it’s his mum or a partner looking for him.” The way she phrased it was so lame, but the idea was sound.
About to ask how Sherlock’s father, and Gareth’s connection to his father, fit into his plan, John decided against it.  Sherlock would talk when he be ready.  If John be not wrong, Sherlock was putting together a plan in that extraordinary brain of his, devising a way to find out who waited for Gareth’s return and how to find them.
“I do apologize; I hadn’t realized you’re hearing-impaired,” he said, projecting his already resonant voice.
He comes into the bedroom carrying the largest present from under the tree.  It has no tag, but I know it is for me.  As much as I love presents, I am quite content and have no need for anything more, but my lovely husband persists.
John!  John!  There she is! Go to her now so I do not have to dry up into a useless pile of flesh whilst I wait for you to tell her.  I need to
The edges of John’s vision went fuzzy, and he drew a deep breath; his headache must be worse than he thought. But that was the wrong thing to do; when he inhaled, he caught the scent of cologne, Tom Ford, to be exact.
I did not like the way he looked; only one other time did I remember seeing John so angry…when I came back from being ‘dead’ after those two long years.  Then,
“Nope, you did it all by yourself.  You added it last night…well, I should say this morning.”  John reddened, remembering the vigorous activities that stretched our wedding night well into the morning.  “I told you to go to sleep; you were barely coherent enough to make it to the loo and back.  But you said ‘No-o-o, it is imperative I see your pail list and add whatever I missed to mine.'  I admit I was surprised you included Las Vegas, but I’ve never pretended to understand how your mind works.”
important to him is me; no amount of money or fame is worth missing out on even a moment with me.  (No, you may
Sucking in much needed air, John’s chest heaved.  And shaking the pain out of his hand, he strained to see Sherlock.  To let him know that they had Cedric.  But his elation shifted to horror at what he saw.
Alternately googling on his mobile and staring sightless at the wall while he processed in his head the data he had found, Sherlock suddenly became aware that it had gotten quiet.  That there were now 17 pairs of eyes looking his way.  16 pairs of eyes that ranged from curious to apathetic to impatient.  And one pair of amiable eyes that looked at him with no expectation, no sense of urgency, just kind invitation. John Watson’s.
“So then, what is it Sherlock?  Why do you have trouble settling in with me?  With us?”  There is no judgment in his tone.  He truly wants to know and is willing to let me explain myself in the fashion I need to do it.
I stretch up and kiss his cheek.  I nudge my fingers through his hair where it is beginning to curl at the base of his skull, the shiny grey hair mixed in with the darker grey fascinating.  He looks peaceful; I do not think I have ever seen him look so beautiful.
Yes, what John had said that morning did hurt Sherlock, but too, it hurt Sherlock to act as if he did not care, for he did, very much.  Such emotions did not disappear with a wisp of the wind.  But as a practical matter, he must appear indifferent.  Were he to show John where his heart lay, John might be too skittish to fall into his trap.
Sherlock dipped his head low to where John could hear him and said, “no more hiding, I want everyone to know you’re mine.”  He stopped dancing and locked eyes with  John.  “
In the subsequent backrubs I have given him, the urge to recreate the incident has been almost overpowering.  I would rub my hands along his offending muscles, he would purr, and just when I thought he was about to fall asleep, giving me the opportunity to reach down and seek my answer, he would roll over and smile at me as if I have just performed a miracle.  A beatific smile that made my stomach tie up in little knots and made me feel as if I
Sherlock fled toward the stairs—the lift would take too long—taking them three at a time. He heard Andi run after him, her shorter legs causing her to lag behind.
“No, Sir, no.  I would never blame you.  If anyone be to blame, tis me.  I knew he did not like Sherlock.  But never would I have thought-”
Mary!  Shite. So caught up was he in the jolt of seeing Sherlock, he’d managed to momentarily forget his wife.
“Christ, Sherlock.” John pulled up his breeches, his legs still aquiver. His voice just as unstable.
John.  John.  John.  My mind hums. My chest hums.  I sag further and John guides me to lie down on the bed, tapping lightly at my leg to indicate I should bring them up onto the bed with the rest of me.  I am so helplessly languid I feel as if I am one of the wet noodles John fed us for dinner the other night, spineless, lying limply in whatever position I fall into without giving thought to dignity.
Pulling back the curtain that afforded little privacy, he saw a man in a beige trench coat standing near the bed, texting awkwardly on his mobile, a worried frown on his face.  His hair was mussed as if in a poor attempt at the latest style, but most likely it came from running his hand through his hair in nervousness.  Father?  John took a look at the unconscious man on the bed.  No, too young.  Boyfriend?  Though the age difference appeared to be at least 10 years, John knew he was in no position to judge the relationship between an older man and a much younger partner.  Not that it mattered, but he found that it helped to know who he was dealing with.
But this?!  Sherlock didn’t have a lover.  Or did he?  As far as John knew there were no romantic interests in the detective’s life, let alone a prospective
you don’t know if, now that it’s been removed, John will remember any of his life since WHO. KNOWS. WHEN? Have I got that straight, Mycroft? Have I?”
I stumble over to the pirate, swiping clumsy fingers through the small stream of dark red fluid flowing down his neck.  I touch a finger to my tongue.  Blood.
My ear buds plugged into my laptop, I listen to Dvorak’s Cello Concerto in B minor.  John reads The Hobbit.  How he can enjoy children’s books, I have no idea.  He says it is because he pictures himself in the role of the protagonist, going on adventures and battling dragons.  I roll my eyes at the whimsy; he is ever the romantic.
Calmer now, I finally look at Sherlock and instead of recrimination, which is my due, or looking as if he wants to bolt, which would also be my due, he questions what he did to earn those words.   But there also seems to be…acceptance there.  As if he has already forgiven me.
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, and laid his head on his chest.  Listening to the reassuring cadence of John's heart as it lulled him back to sleep, he murmured, “Only when thou be with me. Only then.”
Sherlock’s eyes drifted to John’s face as he awaited his answer. John had said he would accompany him to the old woman’s home. He would not change his mind, would he?
did you knock my mug away?  Did you forget to wash out the poison you were holding in it?”  On his way to the kitchen to get a towel, he says this half-jokingly, knowing all too well it is something I am quite capable of.
“And that be?”  John had asked, Sherlock’s expression telling him the price be a steep one.   But whatever price Sherlock required, twould be worth it to see him safe.
Adjusting the brim of his cap against the drizzling rain, Spencer obediently left the cab and headed toward the boot.
pack because I never packed; everything is still in my room.  Well, except for the few things you saw me cart off from the sitting room.”
With a pen poised in one hand and a notebook crooked in the other, Andi glanced at her notes. “We’ll have to wait a couple of hours. We’ll transfer Dr. Watson from here to a removal van that is scheduled to arrive at the Rudnikov’s at 7 a.m. to load their belongs. As we speak, he is being moved temporarily to a limited access area of the building; it’s an old bomb shelter. Of course, there are details still to be hammered out, but does this plan meet with your approval?” Andi looked up for a response.
Just at that moment, the alarm on Sherlock’s mobile set off.  A small scowl passed over his face and pulling it out of his pocket, he turned the alarm off.
I lie here and think about the last two days, two days in which more has changed than in the last two decades.
My craving for John bordering on desperation, no matter how deeply we kiss, no matter how tight I hold him, I cannot get enough of him.  I need more.  More John.
“Though now I be not so sure I want us to find Cedric ourselves; likely to murder him, I be.  And I have no desire to be executed for ridding the Earth of such worthlessness.  Christ, how could I be so blind?”
The medics had just brought in a 29 year-old Caucasian male, possible overdose, and transferred him to a bed in a corner.  They had already established a saline solution drip and masked him for oxygen.
And so he had sold a small part of his soul and gone to Mycroft for answers.  Had asked his lover’s brother what had happened to Sherlock.  Hearing the story told to him he had
Not wanting to go back to an empty bed, I light a fire and sit down in my chair.  I will just read for a bit…
He held up his hand.  “No, I know, you just told me.”  How it still ever surprised him Sherlock would so casually invade his privacy, he didn’t know.  If he was honest with himself, he knew it stopped bothering him long ago.
“Let me finish.  We would say we be brothers and would be housed together, work together.  With our skills, we would be valued.  And when we have secured enough money we would find a cottage somewhere and would not have to worry-”
Still resting in John’s lap after their coupling, it annoyed Sherlock that he had roused him.  He felt contented in John’s strong arms and did not want to move.
I hear the concern in his voice, and I cannot look at him again for fear my eyes will betray me.  Surely my acting talents have withered from lack of use; since retiring from active cases I find there has been little use for them.
As Sherlock’s lips began to move against his, John’s eyes flew open.  Staring back at him were a pair of vibrant blue ones. Neither surprised or accusing, they simply watched John, waiting to see what he would do next.
Sherlock looked at his mum, the keenness of her mind shining through her eyes even though she was in her seventies; he still feared the astuteness as much as when he was a boy.  Even though he had always resented her ability to understand him, he almost always at some point acknowledged she was right.  His mind shrunk from the possibility she was right this time.
Taking the tube with him John returned to straddling Sherlock’s legs.  A generous dollop on his middle fingers of his left hand and he sought out Sherlock’s rim, first circling it with his fuck-you finger, then dipping it in slowly, watching Sherlock’s face, getting almost as much pleasure giving as was the taker. His own cock grew hard as he watched Sherlock’s breathing start to get heavier, saw eyes flickering beneath closed lids, felt Sherlock clenching around his finger, then two, as he probed inside.  His own hips started to rock back and forth as he subconsciously primed himself.
“Here,” I say, “have some tea.  No, wait, I have not yet done the study and you need to watch your intake.  A biscuit perhaps?  No, sugar will make you hyper, or at least more agitated.  Here, smell this rose.”  I take a rose from the vase and hand it to him.  “Aromatherapy, it is quite the rage now.”
Sherlock nodded his assent. Hands rested on him, at first tentative as they smoothed along his skin, growing bolder until fingers gently prodded him, kneading the meat around his bones. His upper body undulated under the strong hands; he could not remember the last time he felt so comfortable, so at ease with himself. Or with anyone else. His body slumped as he nodded into sleep, only to jerk himself upright.
I briefly debate the pros and cons.  Truthfully, I should say I debate the pros, because hard as I try, I cannot think of any cons.
Sherlock came to a dead stop in the middle of the pavement, the mobile’s screen the center of his universe as he waited for the words that would tell him how to fix John.
Sherlock pondered the worthless folder on his legs, and drawing his hands up, he steepled them at his lips. He had work to do.
Alight with excitement, Sherlock’s interest was dashed in the next moment when he read that this James Alderman had not only been male but had died in 1929. Several search pages in, he found banker James Alderman. The ordinary one. Alderman had been a back office lender who negotiated legal documents, according to her bank’s website. (How Sherlock loathed the current predilection of adding personal information on a professional website—“James enjoys spending her Saturdays hunting bargains at open air markets.” Blah, blah, blah.)
Why does he look so nervous?  His tongue peeks out between his lips, takes a quick lick, and dashes back inside.  Snogging?
My throat constricted, I nod, hoping she sees in my eyes how very much I feel the same.  How grateful I am she is here; I cannot do this alone.
Sherlock opened his mouth, but before he could speak, his mobile chirped an alert. He whipped it from his pocket. And reading the message, the whole of him tensed, from the tightening of his expression to the gathering of his limbs.
Tearing off the paper gown and cap, he crumpled them into a ball and threw them onto the floor. Glancing into Recovery one more time before hastening after Mycroft.
Unclenching his fist, John reached for Sherlock’s upraised wrists, his fingers wrapping lightly around them.  He held Sherlock as if he be precious and fragile, as if he might break if he gripped him too tight.  Transfixed by the sight of skin on skin, with his thumb he slowly stroked the soft skin along the inside of Sherlock’s left wrist.
Oh no oh no oh no oh no.  I grunt.  “I am so sorry, John!”  With effort I loosen my grip; it is almost as if rigor mortis has set in, so difficult is it to release my fingers from him.
John reached for her arm, helping her up. “Please, arise. There be no cause to dirty yourself on my account. I am but a humble servant.”
Looking through the eye hole, he saw no one. And opening the door to investigate, he was puzzled to see not a person but a dog. A big yellow dog with a smile on its face and a tail wagging in greeting.
“He did.” Cedric stood up, looking at the floor as had Sherlock, avoiding the blood covered man on the bed.   “Tis not here?”
There had been a vault after all.  Open and ready for when Sherlock and John had come to meet with Magnussen.
“What are you talking about?”  Sherlock stands just inside the door, a grocery bag hanging from his hand, looking as innocent as you please.  That’s right, mister, pretend you didn’t ignore me.
a computer chip, isn’t it?” She realized she hadn’t said it aloud. Maybe Jax had seen something different. Maybe she was overly fatigued from spending long days wrapping up her practice and readying a household to move thousands of miles away. But the look on his face told her that she hadn’t gotten it wrong.
“Tis no minor breach.  What if he tells someone?”  John paced the room.  If the subject be broached, how did they explain away what Colin saw?  Sitting down on the closest bed, he looked up at Sherlock; all the joy that had been on John’s face moments before, gone.
She paused, her face pinched as she wondered out loud why the body occupied space in her morgue.  “This is odd, how quickly they brought him here.  It usually takes at least 24 hours before they release a body.  Especially if it’s a John Doe they want to wait for a family to claim them.”
My brain as sluggish as the rest of me, it takes a few moments to understand what he says.  So immersed am I in my idyllic state, I do not realise I lie fully atop him, smashing him into the mattress, until he tries unsuccessfully to budge out from under me.
“Com’on, don’t be so modest.  It’s not everyday someone gets to save the same life twice.  Though if you were around Sherlock any amount of time it’d probably be more often than that; I’ve never known anyone who can get in as many scrapes as he can.  Always seems to come out smelling like a rose, though.”  Lestrade chuckled.
Much to his fascination, Sherlock had stumbled on a solution, a way out of the ordinariness that he felt his life had become.  A solution to sharpen his deductive edge during this unprecedented slump.
Trembling, John freed a hand, slicked it, and filled it with Sherlock’s penis. Thicker than his own, twas not unlike the rest of Sherlock.  Tall and proud, with a sensuous exterior. His own member twitched in response to a pleasure unlike any he had ever known.
I let flow the tears I have been holding back for too long and, leaning toward my husband, I kiss his lips.  Lips that will never again move against mine.  Lips that will never again release warm breath that gives me life.
John wanted to laugh; Sherlock looked so affronted at the idea of being called Ily again.  Instead, his hand at Sherlock’s nape, he brought him down for another kiss.  And, too soon, with a regretful groan, he released him.  “We had best be off.  We have much work to do.  Packing up camp, finding Cedric…”
He takes our dishes to the kitchen, whistling.  Whistling!  I should be glad to know I am making him so happy, isn’t that what one does for someone they love?  But I am not.
“Do you think it’s a good idea for me to do this to Mark?”  Two fingers touch me mid-thigh; I shiver as they press against me, making contact with my skin through the light fabric of my trousers. Trailing up my crotch, as he outlines my scrotum.  My awakening penis. Until he reaches my zipper tab.
John mumbles something but I cannot understand him.  I push him back just far enough so his mouth is no longer buried in my chest and he can speak.
For a brief moment, Sherlock looked uncertain, and then the side of his mouth quirked up. “Join me?”
On his way to his room, Sherlock stopped at John’s door and tapped.  More unsettled by John’s silence during the drive ‘home’ than he would care to admit, he needed to check on the doctor.   Since he met John he had seen him angry more times than he could count.  But never had he seen John so quiet; it unnerved him in a way that little did.
Sir John was not surprised Sherlock fainted by the time they reached camp. Torture, blood loss, exhaustion. These would be enough to bring down even the hardiest man.
John slides his hand into mine, entwining our fingers, leaving enough space between our palms so he has room to brush his thumb along my palm.
When I open my eyes I am at first disoriented; we are not in our bed at the cottage.  At least, I pray not.  Posters of effeminate young males hang on the walls and my eyes rebel at the startling amount of purple and pink in the room.  Aaah, I remember.  We stay in Greg’s granddaughter’s room.   Gemma visits but a few times a year from where her family live in Scotland, but Mycroft’s and Greg’s home has enough space with which to provide her her own room.
“Let.  Go.  I command you!”  The Naked One bellowed, this time his shout stirring a flock of blackbirds from the treetops, their flight dark against the already gloomy sky.
“Because of me?  What did I do?”  My eyes shift about as I try to figure out what I have done to elicit such…such
things.  Things he couldn’t know weren’t he evil.”  He eyed Sherlock warily, as if the man he had just tried to drown were about to cast a spell, dropping him dead on the spot.
Dread filled her abdomen. In the brief time they’d been in America, Oleg’s drinking had escalated. She hadn’t seen him sober, when she saw him at all, since he spent most of his waking hours at an establishment around the corner, falling onto the sofa when he got to the flat. She had hoped that the change would give him a reason to cut back, if not stop. Instead, the move had had the opposite effect. She would have to tell him she was leaving for a few days, and she wondered which Oleg would respond. Loud, belligerent Oleg who knew to hit her where it didn’t show? (Not the hands. Never the hands. They were their ticket to a better life.) Or would it be the quiet, sullen Oleg who could sit for hours watching a wall, his only sign of life lifting a glass to his mouth or ordering another?
don’t know who implanted it into John?! Or when or why?!” With each accusation, Sherlock’s decibels rose. “
I find it hard to breathe, but not in a good way; not in the ‘this-is-so-wonderful-I-think-I am-about-to-expire-because-I-cannot-breathe’ way.
“Perhaps it was a warning for the British unit to stay away; when they retreat they’ll release John.  Maybe he’ll be injured, but able to come home.”  Any other possibility was incomprehensible to Sherlock.
I step behind Sherlock and reach tippy-toe over his shoulders to collect his coat, around each side to collect his gloves. And as I do, he makes no move to deter me, for his entire focus is on Dr. Watson, telling him, in hushed tones, the story of the Jordan case. Telling Dr. Watson that Marcus Jordan did not accidentally drown in the jacuzzi, that he was not murdered. No, Marcus Jordan died by pure will, stilling his own beating heart because he could no longer endure being alone, unable to tell the man he loved…
I suspect there will be another big gap until the next chapter.  I doubt I'll get one out before my 3 week trip I start next week; I'm not very good about writing while I'm gone.  :-(
John moved to the side of the room and keyed in Mary’s number; he had never figured out how to work the ‘favorites’ feature.  Touching the last number and waiting for the other end to ring, his eyes followed as an attendant wheeled a sheet-covered corpse into the morgue.
“And just why did they leave you here?”  John challenged Sherlock, knowing there was more to the story; Scotland Yard would not be so irresponsible as to leave a helpless man in a deserted home just on a whim.  “
After about 15 minutes, during which Lestrade questioned the distraught wife further about her evening activities and oversaw Anderson’s investigation, Sherlock strode back into the house carrying long plastic tubing about 3 inches in diameter.  His face was flushed from the brisk early summer air and the excitement in his eyes told Lestrade this was an item of importance.
“I promise, John.  I…what?”  My brain catches up with his words; it is unlike me to be so slowwitted.  I pity ordinary people.  “You want me to
“I’m surprised it hasn’t happened already, but it seems the police are putting a trace on it. While the authorities do not suspect you were involved with Dr. Watson’s escape, they are well aware of your close relationship and will be monitoring to see if he contacts you.  May I presume he has not called you?”  His hand didn’t move from where it reached out to his brother.
“Like I said, dad, I’m just surprised; I never knew you were gay.  And besides, I would have been surprised were it
find him and he won’t be touching anyone again.”  The threat in his voice returned; I had had no doubt John would have hunted the man down and killed him should I have given the word.
Cuddling Scotti, Mrs. Hudson smiled at her and headed toward her flat, “Let’s go find you a biscuit.”
“A gift from Simon, the person I believe is responsible for your chip. If you recall the sock puppet the other day, that was his doing, as well. He’s leaving me clues, but to what end, I have yet to determine. Do you know what this is?”
Lestrade pursed his lips.  He really did detest getting into the middle of these things, but he also didn’t want to see his friend abuse himself any further than he already had.  Sherlock could protest as much as he wanted, but he clearly did
One more time, Sherlock started the clip from the beginning. Earbuds in—it was the closest he could get to John.
In attendance at the wedding of one of John’s Army mates, Sherlock and John sat at their table, watching the crowd around them dance.  Sherlock’s shoe tapped in time with the lively music, the fingers of one hand dancing on his knee, his other hand holding John’s beneath the cloth covered table.  John’s free hand drummed the table top as his eyes followed the wedding guests, the longing he felt to join them badly concealed.
The pontage paid by John, horse hooves resounded on the bridge’s planked surface as they crossed the bridge into Leith. A town of about 700 souls, Leith would likely double in size in the next day, market day, but as it was early yet, the town was not crowded. The stench of the latrines they had passed outside the town gate still hung heavily in the air under his hood, stifling him. Sherlock would wait until they passed into town to throw it off. He need to
John lifted his eyebrows to ask ‘what?’, and Sherlock nodded his head toward the frolicking crowd.  How in God’s name did Sherlock do that, always know what he be thinking?
Reluctantly taking his hand from Sherlock’s, he smoothed his thumb along a sharp cheekbone, reminded of when he first saw Sherlock on the hospital gurney so long ago.  Back then he hadn’t known the man that had been near death, had not known that he would fall in love with him.  Had not known that to be without him would be more painful than any injury that could be inflicted upon his body.
“Yes, Laila be the mother to both of us.  She did not tell me until two days before I met you and Sherlock that he be my brother.  Tis why I followed you.  I be ashamed that I was too much of a coward to tell him.  I—I wish—“
.  Closing his eyes, he stroked his length.  He pictured Sherlock’s heaving chest, his nipples straining through his blouse.  Pictured thighs he knew to be strong and sinewy.
“Yes, stabbed with a knife or dagger he was.  But whose? What if it wasn’t Eduard’s?  Think, John.  Most knives are engraved with a family crest or its design is so specific twould be no doubt as to which family it belongs.  If we find the knife we may not know who killed Eduard, but we will have narrowed it down to a group of people.  One with a man named Gareth.”
Stopping mid-chew, Sherlock looked quizzically at John, over at his mother, and back again at John.  Swallowing the food in his mouth he answered, “All of us are.  But if you’re concerned about aberrations I suppose Dad is the one you would be talking about; he is the only one who seems resigned to an ordinary life.”
“What the f—” John sucked in air and blew it out slowly. Now wasn’t the time to fight with Sherlock. “Why not have one of Lestrade’s people do it?”
Sherlock couldn’t imagine why, with Mycroft’s connections, it took him three days to return with information.  Three days that he paced the flat and talked to the skull and walked the streets of London deep in the night.  Three days that he ignored Lestrade’s phone calls and didn’t once call anyone an ‘idiot’.
Cedric squinted in Sir John’s direction. Though he had never known the Knight to be violent outside of the confines of his profession save for the need to protect an innocent life, it was not his place to override a command.  He would do as instructed.  Cedric drew his sword, raising his arms to swing its razor-sharp blade at the neck of man whose only response to a second death threat in one day was to roll his eyes.
“I have been well aware for some time that your wife did not fully disclose her past to you and I felt compelled, for reasons I do not care to divulge, to move things along.  Before you became incarcerated I instructed Anthea to mail the letters and, frankly, during the commotion of the murder and the events that transpired afterwards, they escaped my memory until it they were already in the post.”
“Are you okay, dear?  You aren’t having some kind of episode are you?  My friend Millie, well, just the other day…”
“Well, done,” I say, muffling an exuberant cry of victory, debating whether I am more delighted that Mr. Holmes will pursue his object of desire (I am already jealous of that most fortunate person), or that I am the one who will have the immense pleasure of helping him learn how. I think we know the answer to that question.
Tied up.  Ha.  Probably some euphemism for running hair-brained after the source of a rare strain of Asian tobacco.  While intriguing to Sherlock, the importance of it would be incomprehensible to the rest of mankind.
Sipping his wine, John sat alone, watching as Sherlock and Laila finished their dance and sat back down at her table.  Sherlock looked over at him.  Twas not for the first time he had done so since John had left him and Laila alone, though the gaps between had lengthened, and Sherlock held himself in an increasingly relaxed manner.
I have texted him, telling him I miss him, to please, please text me back.  Tell me he is alright.  But my mobile has remained silent, dark.  I worry.  Is he is safe?  What if his back hurts in the night; who will be there to massage it for him?  What if he cannot read some small print; who will read it for him?   Who is there to tell him he is loved, and hug him until he pushes them away because he cannot breathe? (But then he will smile and pull me back into his arms and smother me with little kisses until I giggle.  Sigh.  I miss you, John.)
With no response forthcoming, Lestrade took a last look around the flat that looked as disheveled and uncared for as the man before him.  He turned and walked out the door, closing it behind him with a decided click.
“John?”  Slowing, Sherlock, looked back to where John lagged behind him, the annoyance marring Sherlock’s features prompting John to catch up.
Swifter than John had ever before seen Sherlock move, and that be swift, Sherlock snaked his arm around John’s middle and pinned him to the bed.
”Are you alright?”  Sherlock asked the computer.  “Despite the tan you have from being in the sun so much, you look oddly peaked.”  He looked confused by what he was seeing.
Sherlock picks up my hand and places it over his heart.  “Like you, I am already married...here.  The rest is just a formality.”
To hold this man in his arms who had seen the world and led men into battles, who at that very moment trembled and moaned from his kisses, the humility of it made his knees weak.  Curious.  Sherlock could assure anyone twas not one humble bone to be found in his body.
Sherlock lifted his brows and shrugged, seeming to have nothing more to say.  But in a tone so quiet Sir John almost didn’t hear him, Sherlock said, “It’s a pity about the boy.”
I press my palms to him, concentrating on keeping my fingers from stabbing him.  Concentrating until…
Readied for bed, Laila knelt beside it.  Twas later than usual, but sleep would elude her for most of the night.
That’s what Sherlock did, used people against themselves. John didn’t want to see the beautiful face, that had so recently been etched with what looked like real emotion, revert to the façade of someone who took painstaking care to pretend nothing mattered.
The grin I offer him is not forced.  It is easy to smile when I am around John, especially now that I am In Love.
Sherlock rolled his hips into John.  Nipping along his jaw, Sherlock paused to explore the cleft of John’s chin, and sucked a trail of open-mouthed kisses down John’s neck, arched in feverish delectation.
“Take his other arm.”  Sherlock stooped to hook an arm under the cleft of Gareth’s shoulder, and indicated John do the same.
The hand Sherlock raised to light his second cigarette fell to his side. “Then how did it get implanted into John?”
His racing heart slowing, John said, “Often he arises at night but does not remember what he does.  Tis best you leave now, dawn will soon be here.” John put his hands on Sherlock’s chest, just as unable to push him away as moments before.  Too tempting it was to linger.  A little more time together could not hurt…
“Yes, John.  I trust you with my life.  I trust you to make good decisions.  And whilst I may have trouble believing that I am suitable for you, that I remotely deserve you, I trust you to know better than me if that is true.
After twenty-five years of thinking of this, just over nine thousand times, when he really did kiss me I was so beside myself from want that I almost lost consciousness. A perfectly natural reaction.  Not a single whit embarrassing.
His finger poised on the gun’s trigger, the blow hit him as he fired, jerking his aim from its intended target.
what you’re doing in the middle of the night when you say you can’t sleep, when you say you’re getting up to work on your experiments?  You’re meeting
Compassion was an emotion with which Sherlock was unfamiliar. He had had, on occasion, kindnesses bestowed upon him. These he counted on one hand. But this man, this knight, had twice in one day saved his life. Bewildering. Why would such a man have been bothered? And it twould have been far easier to let Merek and Henry drown him, pretending he had not heard Sherlock’s cries, riding on. He had not needed to intercede, to hand him money and a weapon.
Sherlock looked at it, uncertain, wanting nothing more than to touch John. To feel the warmth of him. His strength.
“Have you an available room?  As you can see, my friend be unfit to walk anywhere.”  Sherlock produced a coin, showing her twas not a frivolous request.
“What was her name, Father?  Sherlock’s mother?” Millicent asked, enraptured by his memories.  She was not jealous of his love for Sherlock’s mother.  Though her mother and father’s love had not been a demonstrative one, it had been a strong love, based on mutual respect and understanding.  He had been beside himself when she died.
His thumbs tantalizing the sensitive flesh of my abdomen, I have been only marginally aware John has been kissing a lazy path down my chest to my stomach and is now on his way back up.  Up to tease a nipple into his mouth, first flicking it with his tongue and then drawing it into the firm circle of his lips to suck at it.
‘ok’.  I miss you, John.  You are right here and I cannot even touch you.  I cannot fold my fingers into yours, letting you shield me from all these, these,
), and the camera went dark for a moment. When the camera turned back on, Bayers pulled away, on his face a look of confusion, then…what? Anger? Excitement? Whatever emotion it was, Sherlock saw only a flash of it before Bayer took off running, and the camera ran after him, bouncing as if attached to someone who also ran.  They ran along the pathway in Regent’s Park. The camera panned the park.
Remembering that this was video, he rewound it, pausing to take a photo with his mobile as evidence should he in the future disbelieve his memory. He left the video paused as he tried to make sense of the admission John had made to himself, unable to reconcile the convictions on the page with the behavior of the man who had never expressed anything more intimate than the occasional “mate.”
He looked slightly flushed, but that could certainly have come from his Olympic sprints up and down the stairs, and Sherlock didn’t
Todd chuckled lightly, amused by his lover’s predicament.  “Well, if you’re late, just tell them you got tied up,” the mischievous smile on his face failing to show any sympathy whatsoever.
Sherlock tapped lightly on John’s door and hearing no response, turned the knob and walked into the bedroom.  Moving to the bed, he hesitantly reached out to wake John, his arm stopping halfway.  John looked younger than he did when in prison; gone were the extra years those few days in lock-up put on his face.
John groaned at the sight of Sir Norman riding toward him. Christ, he did not have the time or the patience for that pompous arse.
Emerging from the loo, John and Sherlock rejoined Lestrade and his crew. Seeing Donovan staring at them, Sherlock gave her a withering glare as she obligingly looked away, a poorly disguised look of disgust on her face.
John’s back to Sherlock, he flexed his jaw from side to side, shoring up his strength to turn around.
I flop onto the bed beside John.  The party is over and we are back in our hotel room, just me and him, the way it should be. I am exhausted; a rarity for me, but interacting with people in a social environment is far harder than any case I have ever been involved with.  I can barely move, so I think.  Think about John.  Think about him asking me to marry him.
At every turn, he was getting the brush off. Every doctor who had anything to do with his case avoided—quite clumsily, in John’s view—the subject of his memory loss. If it wasn’t malpractice, it bordered on it.
My breathing is labored, as if I’ve been running.  Dear God, I just swore at the man I love more than life itself, something I have never done before, though I can’t say there hasn’t been a time or two he’s deserved it.  This time he did not.  Filled with guilt, I can’t look at him.  No matter the reason, there is nothing to excuse what I just said.
“John!  John!  A pirate! A real pirate.”  I come to an abrupt halt and John bumps into the back of me, nearly knocking me off my unstable legs.  “Look!  He must have gotten separated from his mates on the ship!  I used to want to be a pirate,” I add sadly as I look at the pirate slumped against a palm tree trunk.
He didn’t know for sure.  All he knew was that for months now, more than half the time when he woke up he was either post-orgasm or his rock hard cock was accompanied by a need for his flatmate that affected every part of his body.
I nod my head up and down.  Yes, John.  You are so beautiful and I missed you so much and please, please do not listen to me if I ever say something so stupid again.  I love you, John.
Breathlessness hit him again, as if all the air had been sucked from the room and, desperate to escape, Sherlock grabbed his Belstaff, swinging it around his body and sliding into it. He needed to move. He needed to breathe fresh air.
“I am sorry, John.  You kept pressing and anyway, it does not matter.  It is ancient history.  Can we just get on with our afternoon now?”  I try to sound annoyed; the truth is I am scared.  What if this impulsive confession changes a friendship that has been so comfortable for so long?  What if, after all these years, I have finally driven John away?  I cannot think about that now.  What is done is done; I cannot unsay the words.
Was he in love?  He really didn’t know, but he thought he might be.  Besides, romantic love was overrated.  Compatibility was the key to a long relationship, that’s what his mum had always said.  And she and Dad had been married for 32 years before Dad died.  They had seemed happy enough.
“He’s not dead; he’s just taking a break.  He’s probably from the ship we passed at the last hotel.  It has to be hard work being out in this heat all day and night.”  John takes a closer look at the man sitting at the foot of the palm tree.  “He looks like Captain Jack Sparrow.”
Laying here on the sofa for two long days, his words come back to me.  Telling me that nothing will be solved by brooding, that I need to just get up and get on with it.  Thirteen years ago it would not have undone my mistake.  Today, it will not bring John home; the house will be empty whether he is here or not and I do not want him to come home and find me this way.  I do not want to disappoint John.
Opening the back door of the cottage, Sherlock casually entered as though he belonged there, walking through the kitchen to plant a kiss on the cheek of the old woman standing by the sink, giving her a warm hug.  “Hello, Mum.”
“Yes?”  He is watching me apprehensively.  Of what he is afraid I do not know.  I can only hope he is not afraid of
“I think I may know, or at least we may have a way to find out,” Laila had said, kinder than he had deserved after disturbing her sleep.  She had told Colin of the friend Sherlock had been with when he called at their house asking for the ointment.  “Sir John, he said his name be.  A gracious man.”  Her face had glowed in fond remembrance of the man who had handled Sherlock’s prickliness with such ease.
“Nope.” John leisurely turned the page of his newspaper, brushing away the note waggling in front of his nose.
The build and movements of the person in the video suggested a male, likely in the 25-to-40-year-old range. He wore a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and trainers—in other words, the uniform for half the population of London. And the footage was in black and white, so that was of no help.
Another text popped up, with only a link this time, and Sherlock clicked on it. It took him to a video. In the video was the face of a man—Tom Bayers. Sherlock turned his mobile sideways to enlarge the viewing area, and he saw Bayers’ lips moving, as if he were speaking. What was he saying?
I scoff.   Yes, his hair is now totally grey, the lines around his eyes are a little deeper, and he has developed a small paunch at his middle, but I cannot say he looks much older than the day we met.  He is every bit as handsome now as he was then.
“No.” Sherlock waved a dismissive hand at him.  “Aldus will tend to Sir John. You have failed your knight once, and I would be a fool to give you the opportunity to do so again.”
“Be grateful. It could be a deerstalker,” Sherlock said, donning a blue and green tartan flat cap, but John only looked at him blankly.
A prison never really goes to sleep.  The lights never fully dim, for total darkness gives those inclined to carry on the deeds that brought them there in the first place too much cover to hide.  Too much privacy to protect a man from unwanted sexual advances that those in polite society would call rape.  Give the mentally unstable too much blank space on which to write an alternate reality, to see things that weren’t really there.
,” he emphasized as he cupped John’s face gently in his hands and kissed him with a passion that no one around them would ever misinterpret as anything other than one man being head over heels in love with the other.
John groped the immediate area around his bed, looking for the emesis basin, anything that could serve as a receptacle.
Closets were wonderful places to bury things better left unseen.  Seemingly innocuous rows of boxes lined the shelves above the hangers. Opening box after box Sherlock meticulously searched through every item they contained, not once taking for granted that anything was as it seemed.  Books were ruffled for pictures or documents lodged between pages.  Shirts were unfolded for something hidden in a sleeve.  Small bottles constructed of green glass were uncapped to sample the scent and taste of the liquid, to check if they contained anything out of the ordinary.
He now knew with total clarity he could not continue living with a woman who lived another life behind his back.  A woman whose past he knew nothing about.  A woman he could not trust and could no longer identify any love for anywhere inside himself.  He had been willing to stay in a loveless marriage for his daughter’s sake; he had seen too many broken homes, the emotional damage they inflicted upon the children.  But with Mary continuing to involve herself with assassins, that was just…too much.
an interesting situation, ahem, arising. And with only the 600 thread count sheet between his hand and the object of his desire, he wrapped that silky fabric around it and stroked, giving Sherlock an idea of what he'd like to be doing to him once they got home. Sherlock's agreeable cock gave John its rapt attention, becoming engorged at an alarming rate.  And when a particular individual who held a minor position in the government, walked into the room, John found he needed to share some of the ample sheet
, the only reason I stayed up with JJ was because I knew if John did not get sufficient rest he would be unbearable to live with, ruining my day.” This last is not true, either.  The only things I could not bear were to see my grandson in misery, and to see my husband agitated due to lack of sleep.  I would, I will, suffer any unpleasantness to see to my husband’s happiness.
Aldus laughed.  “Such weaklings you be.  Just watch.  When I be well again, I will pick it up with Sir John
He hovered nearby as the arriving medics picked her up and set her gently onto the gurney, rolling it to the awaiting ambulance after checking her vital signs.  Her arm stretched out to Leonid, beseeching him to stay with her.  He hesitated, unsure what to do.  He wasn’t her husband, he wasn’t her…anything.  Would it somehow complicate her life if he arrived at hospital with her?  Would the baby’s father be summoned, waiting for her?
He shrugs.  “I was curious to see how far you’d go.  And to be honest, it was thrilling watching you; it’s been a long time since you’ve gotten to play a role.  Every moment was fascinating.  Everything about you fascinates me.  Always has.”
The mood of the crowd had shifted. Some people still chanted: “Hang him!  Hang him!” But many others, their brows furrowed as they cast puzzled glances in the direction of the quarrel, became angry at the interruption: “What be ya waitin’ for?  On with it!”
“We’re losing you, Sherlock,” he said to the unconscious man as the medics used all of their training, all of their compassion to save the life of a man they had never met.  John stayed out of their way as they worked, but he desperately wished he could reach his friend. “Take my hand,” echoed through John’s brain, bringing a sorrowful half-smile to his face.  He had to make do with resting his hand on a nearby ankle, placated by the fact that he could have even the merest of physical contact.
?” His eyes widening in outraged disbelief, John narrowed them, wishing he had the power to slay Sir Norman with but a look.  “You dishonorable piece of worthless scum.  You must go at once and retract your lies!”
Sherlock did as told, spying an app with a yellow rose icon that hadn’t been there when he first found the mobile at the pub. Opening the app, all he saw was what looked to be a scaled-back messaging app with only text capabilities. And seeing that he couldn’t text Simon from there—there was no designated space for a name or phone number—he closed it.
Looking at Sherlock, Lestrade’s anger dissolved into pity.  He had expected the worst, but his imagination had not gone far enough.  In just the few weeks since he’d seen him, the detective’s skin had gone sallow, his hair, dull.  Christ, he even looked like he had lost about 15 kilos.  15 kilos more than he could afford to lose.
“Sherlock, then.”   She shakes his hand, holding onto it a few seconds too long.  “You must be very proud of John; he has an amazing gift for fiction; I wouldn’t be surprised to see the book become a bestseller. The level of detail is unbelievable; it’s almost as if he lived the stories.”
Standing there catching his breath, still holding onto Sherlock’s wrist, John looked at Sherlock.  Looked at him looking at him.  Felt his racing pulse, noticing that the consulting detective, too, had become slightly breathless.  Why that was he didn’t really know.
In the flat, voices barked commands that Sherlock willed into a jumble of unintelligible sounds. He had no desire to understand what was being said. No desire to have a distinct memory of those last moments of John’s being. John was dead, and that wasn’t how Sherlock wanted to remember him.
I look around the room, ignoring the chatter, every so often seeing out of the corner of my eye that John is trying to engage me in the conversation, but nothing captures my attention until I hear…’Murder’.  Did someone say ‘murder’?!  Now
“It’s a sock puppet,” John said, taking the pieces from Sherlock. And pulling the sock onto his arm, he balanced the eyes and hair on his fist before they fell off. He added sheepishly, “My sister made them when we were kids.”
John shakes his head, amused.  “I know you, Sherlock; I’ve loved you for more than thirty years and have been married to you for eight.  As much as you like to think so, there’s not much you can get past me.  And I know that as much as you don’t want to admit it, you want to be with family,
For the first time, Sherlock noticed that viewing John’s memories was dissimilar to viewing video on his computer or a show on television; with the latter two, the resolution was uniform. This video mimicked real life. In it, Sherlock could see a distinct focal point with a higher resolution than the hazier peripheral vision.
“I’ll call our driver.”  Mycroft takes his mobile from the table and tapping it a few times, gives instructions to the man on the other end.  I nod my head in thanks.
all that clamoring?” Mrs. Hudson tried to peer past him into the flat, but Sherlock bobbed this way and that in the doorframe, blocking her view. “Don’t you ruin my flat with one of your experiments, dear,” she said, waggling a finger. “Besides, you want to keep it tidy for when John comes home. When is he coming home? I get so worried; he must feel terribly alone, being in hospital all this time.”
“I love you, John,” I whisper to his sleeping form.  Despite my resolve not to wake him, I am unable to resist touching him.  Unable to resist lightly drifting down the length of his arm, his soft hairs brushing against my fingertips, down to the strong hand that brings me such exquisite pleasure; it lies on his stomach, rising and falling with each breath.  I trace the outline of each digit, niggling the wrinkles bunched on his knuckles, raking the pad of my finger on his nails, smoothing along the pronounced veins on the back of his hand, the veins through which flow his life.   My life.  Slotting my fingers in between his, carefully so as not to disturb him, I lie back down beside him, resting my head on his shoulder where his soft breaths warm my cheek.
While he had been talking, John had managed to get me undressed and into the Jacuzzi we had had installed on the veranda.  Such a resourceful man.
?   His groin grew warm with the gentle sway of the horse rocking him, awakening his manhood.  How would John’s mouth feel, hot and wet-
“Because I, well, I thought if it was a useful experience for you then perhaps I should experience it as well.”
I hope John never has to defend his life in hand-to-hand combat.  We are only talking and he is already exhausted, his mouth floundering wordlessly and his shoulders slumping in defeat.  I am relieved to see he has the energy to shake his head.   Perhaps instead of a fight to the death he could offer the option of a head-shaking contest; my John would win.  I beam proudly at his cleverness.
“Keep your voice down,” Sherlock fumed under his breath, taking the knife from Cedric.  He turned it over in his hands, looking for distinct markings.  His finger found the almost illegible “E” scratched into the handle before his eyes did; twas worn down from use.
He is silent and does not contradict me; his hold on me remains firm.  For that I am grateful; it gives me strength to continue.  Introspection is not something I am accustomed to practicing.  In fact, I did not start to become familiar with it until after John and I first kissed.  I toyed with it, trying to figure out the cause of my turmoil, but not until today did I find myself in a situation where I needed to place myself under a microscope.  I did not like what I saw, at least not as a partner to John.
“I am fine John, just sitting here a bit.  I will join you soon.”  He says he’s fine, but if I’m not wrong, I heard him stifle a shiver.
John lied there and tried to figure out some way to keep Sherlock from knowing the real reason.  Some way to put the bloody man off the scent.  The more he tried to come up with a reason that would satisfy Sherlock, the more frustrated he became when he couldn’t find one.
Mycroft’s stridency dissipated as he said, “Despite what you think of me, Sherlock, I am no monster; I have no desire to see you unhappy.  If Dr. Watson is important to you, then he is important to me.”
“Ahhh, what a handsome woman Sherlock’s mother was; she shined, like a pearl amongst swine.  With long ebony hair, she had skin so pale she looked almost to be an apparition.   Not a malicious one, but as a heavenly being who bestowed upon us her goodness, making us mere mortals feel clumsy and unworthy.  Why she fell in love with me, I do not know, but I was wise enough to marry her before she discovered her error.  And quick?  Oh, my.  Never had I known any to be so bright, whether they be man or woman.  Well, at least until Sherlock came along.”  A soft chuckle escaped William as he reminisced about the willful child who had brought him such joy.  And yes, consternation, too.  But mostly joy.
He eyes move down my body as if he had never seen a nude male before, his mouth agape, his brows knitted.
Affronted, Sir John opened his mouth to object to being spoken to in such a way, when he saw the quirk at Sherlock's mouth reappear. Brazen bastard, he thought, unable to stifle a mirroring smile.
“Are you planning on leaving me, John?”  I do not think I want to hear the answer, but I must be brave.  If I am to build a new life on my own, it is best we acknowledge it so I can start right away.  Perhaps I will try to find a new roommate, someone with John’s particular skills.  Housekeeping will be at the top of the list.  I will condition the rental agreement on their promise we stay in our respective bedrooms; I can imagine no better kisser than John.
Sherlock sped after him in long strides, ripping the strap from his neck and letting the camera fall to the ground with a clatter.
I groan.  Not the ‘do it for me’ ploy.  Again.   The light in my brain turns on.  Ahhh, he is clever enough to hide his cleverness.  How very...  well, you know.  Now that I am on to him, I will not underestimate him again.  But this time I will comply with what he asks.
So good that it caused me to want to beg for more? To, in my delight and anticipation, squirm, and…ahhh.  I understand.
“You are right, I do not.  But you, John, you are the exception.  To every rule I have ever known,” I tell him, kissing his crown and resting my cheek on it.
“I know you said Sherlock is a girl’s name, but I couldn’t wrap my head around that one, so I named her Scotti.”  John briefly looked away, chuckling awkwardly.
On the way home it’s quiet in the car, the radio set to a classical station that keeps losing reception, so Sherlock turned it off.
A look of amusement replaces the melancholy on his face and he laughs.  The sound of his laugh never fails to send a surge of happiness coursing through me.
The door creaks as John opens it.  (How would I know why we close the door when we are the only two people who live here!  Now shush.  We are busy!)
John licks his lips nervously, but he answers her question of how long we have been a couple, more or less.  More like less.  Skipping the ‘insignificant’ fact that he’s been in love with me for years.
Colin be wrong.  Deeming the meat cool enough to eat, he took a bite, and then another.  They tasted heavenly for the brief moments they spent in his mouth before they went down, but when they hit his stomach, they felt as if he had eaten boulders, heavy and hard.  Weighing him down.
I loosen my hold, about to let him go.  “I am sorry.  So, so, so sorry!”  The words rush out of my mouth in a torrent of apology.
On the screen, I pull my vows out of my pocket, written down so I wouldn’t fumble them. But the problem was I couldn’t read them.  I remember it wasn’t because of the tears in my eyes, but because I hadn’t used large enough print.  Sherlock pulls a small pair of reading glasses from the inside breast pocket of his suit and hands them to me.
I stare into his eyes.  I love you, Dr. Watson.  You are good and kind and wise and smarter than anyone I have ever known, except for me.  I cannot think of anything else but you.  There is nothing else I want to think about.
When I lean my ear down, he puts his mouth close to it; his warm breath overpowers my senses.  But not more than his words.
I never thought I could love him more than I did even a few weeks ago, which was a hell of a lot, quite frankly, but I was wrong.  For Christ’s sake, he’s 2 metres away from me, and I miss him.  How much more pathetic can I be?
He’d done far too little of it lately.  Wasn’t there a case he had been working on, about a, a Violet…something or another?  It didn’t matter if he couldn’t remember her name right now, he’d be back to his usual dynamic self soon enough.  He had no doubt.
He felt ashamed at what he told Sherlock minutes earlier, that the detective was ‘very important’ to him.  Whilst true, it had to have sounded as if a slap to the face.  How more patronizing could he have been?  But what else could he have said when he himself was only just now realizing what Sherlock meant to him?
“Aldus, we be leaving.”  Colin’s words clipped, he hurried over to Aldus.  Pulling out a clean blouse for Aldus, he started dressing him.  “Here, put on something fresh.  I think you be well enough now to go to the blacksmith with me.  You can sit and watch whilst I work.”
Unbeknownst to John, he heard just as much about Sherlock’s cases and observations – ‘the murder weapon we are looking for is a 6.35 centimeter serrated Smith and Wesson knife’; ‘the sack boy at Tesco was kidnapped at age 5 and never returned to his parents’- while he was asleep as when he was awake.  Not once did Sherlock ask for John’s input, so John was just as content to go about his own business, relegating Sherlock’s mutterings to background noise.
When the colleague stopped by the desk, and James looked up, her movement felt mechanical—James’s vision seemed to move in perfect sync with the movement of her head.
“No, tis not that about which I worry, though that still is not right.”  John turned away from Sherlock, withdrawing his hand from the one that still held it.  “This.  Us.  Tis not right.  We must stop this.”
In front of me are eyes filled with such gentleness I feel as if I could drown in them.  A mouth whose ends slant up into an impish smile, the tip of a rosy tongue teasing its entrance.  Gone is the pallor, the deep wrinkles, the skeletal-like physique.  This is not the John I last saw, the John who died.  This is the John I saw the day we met.  The day I have long known is the day we fell in love.  While I do not care what age he appears, to me his face is always the very definition of beauty, I am glad not to be reminded of the moments so heartbreaking there are no words to describe them.
Retrieving a pair of keys from her handbag, she handed them to the woman who had joined her.  One key belonged to the Land Rover in the driveway, the other to the desk drawer which now held a loaded revolver.
“That is what I said.”  Really, John, perhaps we should enroll you in a vocabulary class if you have such difficulty with the English language.  How you graduated medical school and lived all these years without being aware masturbation is sex, I have no idea.
John had no need to say a word, for the exhilaration on his face told Sherlock everything he needed to know.
Sherlock clenched his glutes as he watched John’s face, clenching first one, then the other, then back and forth again.  Watched as John was unable to keep from laughing.
It was the beginning of our first marital fight, John’s suggestion that the vouchers Mycroft bought us as a wedding present, the ones which would take us
so much?  Telling me how glad you be to finally have a brother.  You be as cowardly and traitorous as that woman sitting beside you.   If this be what you call a family, I want no part of it.”
Sherlock’s mobile rang, and he was able to answer before it rang again. With a glance at John, assuring himself he hadn’t woken, Sherlock stepped into the night to take the call from Molly.
“I love you, John,” I say, words he so rarely hears leave my mouth.  Aha!  He will be himself in no time; he can never resist a well-timed romantic gesture.
Sherlock watched intently, first hearing a deep groan and then seeing an arm and hand come into view and sweeping past John’s face. Movements suggesting that John was rubbing his neck.
“Must I repeat everything I say?”  I look at John over my shoulder and instantly regret my tone.  He is confused, and I do not blame him.
Sherlock cannot think.  Has he been brainwashed?  What other explanation could there be for only being able to think of John Watson?
He felt more then saw the blue eyes on him as Sherlock considered his response.  What the hell was taking him so long?  It really wasn’t that complicated…
