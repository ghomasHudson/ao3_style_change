!" the blue-eyed man parted his legs more, when he teased a lubed finger on his balls. Dean smiled softly and gave him a peck, he then chuckled when Cas wrapped his arms and legs around his body pulling him impossibly closer.
not the werewolf thing but the Dean thing and how he apparently had found his soulmate. He can't even imagine what his life would be now, is Dean?--
Castiel crawls over Dean's lap, setting each leg over Dean's meaty thighs, arms wrapping around his neck as he ground his ass on Dean's rock hard cock, rubbing it between his cheeks. Dean doesn't lose time to kiss him though, hotly and growling hungrily dipping his fingers between Castiel's ass, rubbing a finger over his hole.
Dean growled as his eyes fell on the ugly mutant bastards in front of him, as they said, they were on time. The closest crossroad was half an hour-long, he ran exactly at the right speed to be 3 minutes earlier.
They stayed some moments tangled, Castiel nuzzling Dean's jaw and Dean nosing his now almost dry hair. It was comfortable if you exclude the chilly sand of course
Dean, his best friend for almost 15 years, the man he is in love with for almost 15 years is now getting married to a woman he knows only a year.
The taller man's jaw is clenched as he continued, "I might made you believe that I didn't care, but I do, and it fucking hurts...I never felt like this before,
Dean pulled him once again into his chest and Cas melted as he inhaled Dean's heady aftershave. Wrapping his arms around the slightly bigger man Cas buried his face into Dean's neck whispering a broken
After calling Sam, Cas sat next to him, he was silent and looked down on his lap, Dean couldn’t get his eyes off him, he knew he was safe, Cas’ aura was calm and nervous at the same time.
Dean turns around, tears brimming in his eyes. What the fuck? He never cried before…not even when his old man died.
Also, his life has some adventure now, if it wasn’t threatening him or his close ones hell he’ll kinda be happy.
When Dean hit his spot Cas choked and let his hands chase Dean's body, grabbing the other man and pulling him in him even more, Cas hugged Dean nuzzling into his beard. "Please more,
"Dean what the hell is going on-" Carmen exclaimed angrily as she grabbed the green-eyed man's arm from behind. Dean turned and jerked his arm from hers.
Letting out a loud sigh, Castiel once again felt that empty feeling coming back to his whole body making him shiver.
The tall man had sandy hair and a matching beard, his eyes were the greenest he ever saw, his toned chest and thick biceps were wet and tanned. Cas trailed his eyes down and blushed immediately.
He laced their fingers together, making Castiel relax a little, the tension falling off from his shoulders.
Cas should be here next to him and Sam, as he waits for...Carmen. Dean tried to ignore the ugly feeling that wrapped around him when he thought about his fiance in the past few weeks.
Dean pressed a feather kiss to his neck right over his pounding pulse point. He licked his lips and groaned out a warm puff of air that made Castiel shiver, then sharp fangs plunged into Castiel's skin.
was apparently all Castiel could manage to let out as he almost moaned when Dean ran his fingers on his hips.
Cas smiled as he remembered him and Gabe almost starting a fire in the oven once, as they forgot to take out the wrapping paper of the already prepared pie doe.
Then out of nowhere, just a few minutes before he was about to enjoy his night, perform in front of Manchester, his whole world collapsed. Castiel tried to reach Dean but the bastard didn't return his calls.
Then his chin was on top of Dean’s head, Cas tightened his grip around him bring him closer, melting into him.
Cas turned around and ran as fast as he could, marking the edge with an arrow of pinecones so he could find the wolf again even if it had fallen silent.
There was nothing there to help him or the other wolf. He could drive the hell away from here, but he couldn’t leave the animal,
Cas." Dean then said growling possessively as he lifted the smaller man into his arms, Castiel immediately wrapped his legs around Dean's waist and then around his shoulders having a huge grin as he let the bigger man slip wet kisses on his neck.
Sitting there in the silent woods, Cas sighed once again. It was hard being alone, but he managed. It was
Dean reached out to fiddle with the mess of hair he had, "I feel what you feel...Our bond is fresh, we're emotionally connected, If anything happens to you--"
After the kids went to the playground with Hazel, he and Cas sat on the bench. Dean dug out the cold beers and offered one to Cas, who gratefully took it. "And for us, beer..."
“I’m here sweetheart…” tears start rolling into his cheeks as Dean stares at him with a surprised frown drawn in his face.
Castiel felt really shitty right now, not only he put himself in danger but Dean was hurt and worried for him because of
It hurt so much, the man he loved with all his heart disappearing in front of him, getting somewhere he doesn't deserve. Dean is so much more than just a man. He is everything everybody dreams of. This horrible woman is so lucky to have him, even though she doesn't love him for what he truly is.
He said moaning when Dean started thrusting deep and slow. Minutes later he was fucking into him fast and hard.
After some hunters put the mutt bodies in a bunch, the set it on fire, Castiel felt a satisfaction, those creatures are down, they will never hurt anyone now.
Dean would have been dead too, but when Castiel led his eyes on him, he changed his mind. Those bulky biceps and that handsome face made him change his mind.
“Ah, s-shit, Dean I-I’m c-close,” Castiel’s cock was licking between their stomachs, he still couldn’t believe Dean could make him come untouched.
Without thinking Castiel grabbed the metal fork and knife from the diner’s bag he got on lunch for tonight, he hated eating with plastics, so he always carried his own cutlery.
They both smiled at each other softly before kissing again, this time slower. The applause and cheers once again erupted like crazy. Both best friends, now
"I'm Castiel, by the way...Since now I'm your new master. You're mine forever Dean of Winchester," he announced with a proud seductive grin, his hands still on Dean.
." suddenly Dean lifted his hips up, spreading Cas' legs wider, his wolf's heavy cock resting on his, Then Dean got between his thighs giving him one last loving/hungry glance before lifting his legs even higher. His ass in full view of his hungry wolf.
"H-Hello Dean." He blurted, cheeks suddenly warming and his whole world stopping. Dean looked even hotter now, and god so, so handsome. Soft freckles dusting on his cheeks and those plush cupid bow lips.
Dean smiled warmly and leaned to kiss Castiel’s cheek, the blue-eyed Hufflepuff smiled closing his eyes, feeling those gorgeous lips over his skin, cheeks burning.
Dean froze dreadfully when he turned around and met with Cas’ surprised flushed face. A hint of a smile was curling into his red bitten lips.
She smirked knowingly, winking at him as she wrapped her arms around his neck swaying seductively at the music.
He looks at Dean confused and angry, lips parted, begging him to shove his tongue inside. God, he needs to kiss Cas now, he needs to take him and show him who he belongs to.
"I'll be alright..." Cas said automatically, he still didn't understand much, he knew though, that his heart belonged to Dean, and anyone could say whatever they want, but the dark-haired man recognizes what he feels. There's still a lot to know about his mate, but from what his heart is sensing, Dean seems the perfect one.
The crowd went wild when he jumped on stage with a huge smile, the lights were blinding and they were some fireworks welcoming him that went with the beat of the song. Castiel glanced at his band and smiled again, putting an act that obviously no one would notice.
depressing but he feels a part of his heart died that day, sometimes he wishes it was him instead, that
"I don't usually date guys, but when I saw you, man...I had instantly a crush on you..." Dean chuckled too. Castiel felt fluttered and his cheeks heated.
“I want to come too!” Castiel blurted immediately, he needed to help some way, he knew it was hilarious for him to play a hero, 3 days earlier he ate ice cream with Alfie watching Gilmore Girls.
His eyes were closing, he felt the energy of the wolf inside him trying to fight it, but the poisonous DNA made a contrast complication towards his human DNA and his animalistic one.
And don't let me start about Ms. Barnes, she called at least 23 times and you never called her back, which means..."
Castiel’s heart was beating in a supernatural beat, his body trembling intensely as he dares to open his eyes.
His brother was shivering, he understood why he was clinging to Sam, wolfs were so warm, Sam blushed when he met Castiel’s eyes.
“Glad you made it boy.” He says as he pats his back, Bobby gave him a small smile, but he could see the red eyes the older man had.
That is too odd, Tomas should be inside. Castiel shoves the bad feeling on the back of his mind and shakes his head, this is ridiculous, the man probably went to grab something to eat.
He slid his mouth down over Dean's cock and he heard him hissing, smiling with a mouth full of cock, he started giving slow and long sucks, hollowing his cheeks and lapping at the fat head. Then licking the underside of his cock, he felt Dean's hips stutter.
She pulled him into a bear hug, almost lifting him from the ground, she was always stronger than him and she was so little.
Seconds later it was on top of him, throwing itself to him, Castiel grabbed the neck, pushing it away from his face with all his strength as the animal tried to rip him apart with its sharp teeth.
The blue-eyed man frowned in confusion, he followed the noise stepping carefully not to scare the possible animal that might attack him.
Dean Winchester was finally making his move and started walking towards Cas and Balth, the blue-eyed man's heart started pacing and his best friend smirked knowingly.
, Castiel a not important cook from Austin. A boring and awkward person who everybody thinks is weird.
"The wedding is off. I'm sorry Carmen..." Dean got in front of Cas protectively and the blue-eyed man wrapped his arm around Dean's.
working. They can’t figure out anything, Dean needs to go alone, fuck the trap, an innocent life was in danger,
Charlie frowned at him, her eyes searching for him to say something else, she knew, she knew his feelings about Cas. But what she didn’t understand was Cas didn’t feel the same.
Castiel was stunned, those dark shiny red rings were breathtaking—but Dean’s natural green was so much prettier.
He crosses the hallway in a quick step and then his eyes fell to the people outside Dean’s room. His breath hitches when Castiel recognizes Benny, Dean’s best friend.
The king got up in a sexy elegant way, walking slowly and coming closer to Dean's way, he then only noticed he was unchained and only wore a satin short tunic around his hips. At close, the king was even more breathtaking, his dark hair was short and fell down on his forehead, small rocks of sapphire graced his ears and his broad shoulders were glistering.
“Really now?” Castiel whimpered when his eyes fell on another pair of light brown wolfs, smaller with gold bright eyes.
"...I told myself, I might as well take the risk because it's the only remedy I know of that could let loose this feeling I've been keeping inside me all this time." Cas stopped for a second, gulping hard, his throat dry and croaked.
The hall was incredibly quiet, everybody stared in Awe, Cas could swear he heard some sniffs and small sobs. It felt unreal that he finally let out everything he been holding for almost 15 years.
"You gonna do fine old man..." Claire said as she buried herself inside the Winchesters' arms hugging him too. Dean then chuckled even more, his nervousness leaving his body. He gave kisses at both of his kids' heads and got up.
After Cas got up and turned to greet them, he smiled at them with his plump gorgeous lips. Today he was wearing an AC/DC t-shirt and jeans. Dean almost had heart-eyes at the sight.
“I was always a wolf, Winchesters have it in their blood for generations. In the sixteenth year of our life we start formation, meaning we’re ready for our first transformation to a quadrupedal animal.”
"Oh fuck," Cas said, pulling him closer, groaning as that made Dean shift deeper. His voice was breathless when he murmured, "
Dean instantly lifted his head up, tears were around his gorgeous green eyes, Castiel almost turned away, he couldn't look at Dean, especially like this, Dean never cried, even in his father's funeral he didn't let out a single tear.
“You think I ain’t going with 270 miles per hour already, boy?” Bobby hissed, “We’ll be lucky if we don’t get a fucking ticket too!”
Poor Sam, the teenager sounded scared, Dean is the only one he has, and being like this is an understatement. The blue-eyed man shut his eyes, Sammy needed help, he couldn't leave him like that...
Castiel's smile was wicked, eyes the literal Egyptian blue. Dean then couldn't move, it was like he was a statue,
The wolf looked more relaxed almost instantly, his breathing settling out and his eyes shut. Cas sat on the stool and watched the wolf sleep.
Sam’s voice is quiet and nervous on the other line as he waits for Castiel to answer—and God he can feel the hurt in his shaky breaths, he imagines Sam’s happy and soft face being sad and devastated with watery hazel eyes.
Sam frowned sighing, he nodded understandingly, the younger wolf made a motion to follow him, Castiel immediately did, following Sam like a lost puppy.
Cas reached up, brushing his fingers through Dean's sandy hair, then stopped at the back of his head to hold him close while their tongues danced and tangled, Dean opened his mouth, accepting Cas' curious tongue with so much hunger, he growled like an animal.
Dean grabbed his hand and put it in his chest, holding it tight. He leaned closer, his pale handsome face hurt.
After he took his phone and his trench coat to cover Dean, that was thrown on the back seats, Castiel returned and knelt next to Dean covering him softly, still having a shocked frown.
The older man looked at him puzzled and then chuckled darkly when Castiel took his position and pushed him into the bed, he didn't lose time to drag Dean's jeans and boxer briefs in a smooth pull.
Some chicks already eyed him hungrily and Dean smirked, yeah, alright he may get laid tonight—forget about a certain
The wolf's paw twitched. This wolf was huge and it must have weighed over two hundred pounds. It was going to be a challenge to lift it up and then place it on the back of his truck.
Moments later, cool, spit slick fingers brushed over Cas' hole. One finger breached the tight ring of muscle and pressed inside.
"I'd love to Dean, I really wanna meet your family...then maybe...you could come and live with me in Toronto...we can visit them any time you want."
Dean shot one more questioning look at Castiel, who gave him a little nod, "Uh, we'll have number 23, try to put as much bacon as you can," he winked and Jo almost rolled her eyes. They were close probably, Castiel could feel a playfulness between them.
“Please take me to a room and fuck me…with this costume on.” Cas said breathlessly pressing his erection to Dean’s and the green-eyed man thought he was in heaven.
More members came, including Sam with an Asian kid and a blond one. They both were at least 18-19-year-olds, Castiel never saw either of them before.
“Everyone’s probably wondering where you are…” Castiel whispered as he realized both of them were all night in Dean’s bedroom. The blue-eyed man didn’t even have the chance to meet the other members of his Alpha’s pack except Bobby, well and Sam but he doesn’t count. He didn’t even have the chance to check the bunker they were in, they hurried immediately into Dean’s room. Bobby giving him some painkillers and an antidote injection. It is big and underground, that’s for sure.
Today Cas was wearing a light blue button-up which made him sexy as hell, his grey suit pants making his ass looking like a fucking desert.
He took Deans cock and started jerking him off licking the head like a fucking lollipop, god he was so horny.
But Castiel couldn’t think straight, his brother was in danger, his Wolf boyfriend went to sacrifice himself without even thinking about anyone else and yeah, he’ll probably spill his guts out from the anxiety.
Dean felt his neck loosen up, like his bones were melting and before he could let his head fell back Cas got a hold on him and brought him closer to him into his chest.
Cas waited frozen, heart pounding, but the cry didn't come again. He took another step, continuing on his path but a soft grunt caught his ear this time, and he couldn't ignore it.
Music was blasting and neon lights were shining here and there. Everyone was dressed in a Halloween costume and a lot of folks were already drunk.
-- that opened across his brother's bar a few months ago. At least it was good for business, they never had so many clients before. The Club was a big factor as it didn't serve human food.
After taking a breath, he felt Cas’ hand caressing his cheek softly, he didn’t even realize it, but he could see his eyes still shining red from the reflection of Cas’ ocean blue eyes.
Dean kissed his way around Cas' chest. He circled Cas' hole with the pad of one finger, and Cas tensed and whined eagerly.
The hazel-eyed wolf took out some keys in his pocket, Castiel watched curiously as Sam unlocked the door in quick easy moves. The chain fell with a heavy thud.
Cas fiddled with his sleeves as he smiled slyly over, and Dean noted that he was wearing again the big, black trench coat even though the weather had taken a definite turn towards spring-proper and the sun was shining.
“How the bloody hell that even happened?” Gabe exclaimed. “Weren’t they supposed to be hitting the players?”
Dean's face twisted with pleasure, and Cas forced his own eyes to stay open, fixed on his wolf, before they both knew it Cas came, hot and thick on his chest. The seed flowing between them in what felt like slow motion.
"Yeah, sure." He started to panic, he didn't dance, he might have fooled around with Balth at some stupid pop songs at parties but he didn't know how to dance to the songs that played here.
“Cas, you’re so hot…uh…f-fuck.” Dean reached Castiel’s cock and started stroking it fast as his thrusts.
It was a few gentle drives forward before Cas'body opened fully to welcome him in, but when Dean felt those muscles relax around him, he set a pace that had them both moaning and gasping.
Groaning a breathless moan at the touch, Castiel palmed Dean's half-hard uncut cock. The young king was very satisfied,
Back at the cabin, Cas cleared a spot on the front porch that was well lit and would stay lit until the early afternoon.
Dean rested his forehead against Cas'. Their noses pressed together, his lips brushed Cas' as he spoke. "you're so perfect,
Sometimes he couldn't help but look at Dean and steal some glances when they went out with their mutual friends (he avoided going out with the couple alone.)
"I love you too, assbutt, I can't believe you did all this..." Cas chuckled softly as he started buttoning Dean's shirt up. Dean then blissfully buried his face in Cas' shoulder holding him tight.
This kiss, even though it was messy, was the most gorgeous sensation they both experienced with each other, they both could feel the love radiating from them. Castiel felt like heaven.
Why the hell he is here? After what he did, After the way he ruined Castiel's heart, taking decisions by himself and not returning Castiel's pleas.
Castiel knew he scared the hell out of Dean, and that was the last thing he wanted. But that fucking false text broke his heart, yet the only thing he regrets is how stupidly and dangerously he dealt with it. He hoped whoever did him dirty had been at least arrested.
"Okay, here's the deal, you will not come to our wedding tomorrow, call sick or whatever I don't know...if you do, I'll tell him you assaulted me, or, oh! You're in love with him! Bet you'll hate how he would react, you keeping this secret..."
"Your men are alive if you're wondering... I found myself very forgiving, so I send them somewhere away from here..." The young royal palmed his pec, "
“I can’t believe you held a gun, you’re like a virgin in danger…guess you already lost it today.” His brother didn’t look shocked at all and Castiel couldn’t believe how quickly he accepted everything. The blue-eyed man rolled his eyes, before closing the car door.
“I was so angry at you…I can’t believe you left without saying anything…” Castiel murmured against his wolf’s warm neck, running his fingers through his soft fur.
"Dean relax, it's just Cas..." Sam grins looking at his nervous brother, Dean takes a deep breath and stares at his family and friends who had gathered for one of the most important--
He tries to keep his eyes steady to the road as he got closer to the hospital. He fights the tears that are threatening to roll down his cheeks.
Castiel wiped a tear with his thumb and continued to look at Dean. He opened his mouth, lips slightly trembling.
Castiel only then realized Dean's rock-hard cock was poking his ass. Biting a moan, he slipped off Dean who was stunned and dizzy, looking at him with an adoring look. Dean's bow legs were spread the best way possible, his heavy cock bobbing so fucking big.
His boy loved the park, maybe they'll see Kelly and her son Jack, he and Ben were good buds, and Kelly seemed a nice woman. Better than Naomi and her snob twins Michael and Lucifer--
…again?” Dean asks, burying his face against Castiel's neck. His voice is small but deep and closes his eyes once again.
"No, no," Dean reassured him, giving him a gorgeous smile, " You haven't mentioned the miniature thing though, that is nice...I love to build things too. My things are just a bit different, but, same. Love cars, made my 'baby' all by myself. Took some years but she's here and she's gorgeous."
"How do you know my name?" horror surrendered him as he stepped even further behind. He let a shaky breath when his back hit the wooden wall.
Gasps and whispers were heard all around the hall, however, Cas ignored every single one as he started walking towards the aisle to stand in the middle.
Before he could turn around and grab his car keys, Cas heard a noise coming from the bathroom. He froze
His eyes fell on the Alpha, who was weakly receiving sharp bites, its eyes looked defeated as it tried to rip apart the smaller one’s throat.
but that doesn't change the way I feel about you..." Dean said almost sober, wrapping his arms around Cas' waist.
"What you want Cas?" Dean whispers, as his finger circle Cas' dry little pucker. Cas groans louder and rests his head on Dean's neck breathlessly.
When they fell on Dean's huge bed, Cas on top of him their lips met once again, he runs his hands all over Cas' gorgeous tan body, he settles on his perky ass, palming the flesh, having Cas moan in his mouth.
Every time he hung out with Dean, cause he did (Lord bless Fridays), and enjoyed it so much, even though they had very little time with each other before Lorna? came, he was always smiling, and his heart was racing, ready to get out of his chest. Do not even let him start how his dick reacted when the music was too loud at the parties and Dean had to lean closer to talk to him in his ear, hot breath hitting his heated skin.
“That night…” Dean started; throat tight with emotion, “You didn’t do anything wrong; don’t you ever blame yourself—I—I’m sorry for making you believe that…”
Both smaller wolfs growled and pounced right over the bigger one, these ones seemed not to care about the loud Alpha growl.
Castiel yelped falling back on his ass, as the Alpha pushed him at least 3 meters away to attack the other animals.
Putting his now cold hands in his pockets, Castiel continued walking, passing the nightclub and the hungry stares from the vamps that followed every move of his with their cold eyes.
Pushing the silk fabric from his shoulders, Castiel walks slowly and --by the way Dean's eyes darken with lust and his lips part--with erotism, he feels his cock twitch as the other man gazes at him.
Castiel found the music classroom, which was empty and locked himself in. Today he was supposed to be confident and relaxed. He wore his favorite outfit and fixed his hair, all for Dean! Charlie and Gabe said he looked good. (Obviously they've said it!
Cas avoided looking at him, blue eyes focusing on his bed like it was the most interesting thing ever.
When Castiel was coming down the stairs, he was already whipping his head around, looking for Dean. Then he noticed him. Dean was leaning back against his black muscle car, dressed in a black henley, an olive green flannel which hugged his broad shoulders amazingly, and some black jeans. His sandy hair swooped up and framed up attractively, his stubble was perfectly trimmed.
As Cas continued to decorate Dean's neck and shoulder with bruises, the green-eyed man ripped his belt off and then pushed his slacks and boxers in a smooth pull. It interrupted Cas' kiss task but it felt amazing.
When they all got out, Sam, Bobby, and Benny walked fast, and he was left behind like a lost puppy. He couldn’t let the other hunters see that he didn’t belong. Castiel followed in determining step so he could be right next to Benny. The hunters turned to them; eyes suspicious as well as his friends were. A woman with a pixie cut, wearing a plaid shirt and a green jacket stepped confidently in front of Sam and Bobby, she was probably the leader or the head of their hunter group.
A couple of seconds later Cas lifted his eyes and met Dean's handsome face, he was frowning but his eyes were soft.
“Cas…” Dean moaned out before slumping down onto Castiel’s back, his hot breath making Castiel feel even sweatier and heated.
Turning the kettle, Cas waited for it to boil so he could have a cup of his favorite 'Earl Grey' tea. It was quiet, only the sound of the boiler whistling could be heard around the silent late evening.
Cas just shrugged like he didn't want to talk about it, Dean noticed that he almost started avoiding looking at him.
. Anyways, Cas always was shy, but now he was confident enough to ask Dean out. The green-eyed jock always smiled at him and waved at him almost every time he saw Cas. That's a sign. Right? Right? If Dean says no, or laughs and humiliates Castiel, he isn't sure he'll ever ask anyone ever again.
At first, Dean started at a slow pace, so Cas could adjust, grabbing his knees and thrusting deep and slow, Cas moaned, rolling his eyes into his brain, his ass felt full with Dean's cock. The green-eyed man kissed his calf as his speed quickened.
"Fuck." Dean moaned resting his head on Castiel's shoulder, his own cock already painfully hard pressing against Dean's hip.
When Castiel finds them, he literally ran out of the apartment not caring about the unlocked door or the elevator. His heart is beating fast and he can feel every beat louder and louder in his whole body.
Dean moved closer pulling a blanket over them and then him closer to his chest. His arms wrapping around Castiel’s waist,
Castiel took a deep breath, sinking into the pillows and his husband's warmth. "Dean. What on earth would I do without you?"
“The pack I have here is like family to me, every single one of them trusts me and will die for me…But out there, those sons of bitches are still lurking,
Dean shoots a fake smile at them and transforms again into the carefree and confident man he tries to be, offering his hand to Cas' date. Cas appears to understand this and his face hardens, blue eyes furious.
He heard a loud bang right behind his car, it sounded like he hit something. Confused he stopped abruptly, worried for a second. There was no way it was another car or an animal.
"Nervous dad?" Claire asked and his heart melted, Claire has been so difficult to call him dad, she didn't like the idea of him replacing her mother or Cas having to share them both. Yet, she left it behind it as Dean grew in her.
Benny huffed and Castiel saw the poisonous mutt grinning as it laid down on the grown. Benny got him. Castiel frowned and guilt flashed in him. He once again set the gun and shot the almost dead mutt, it would not do anything cause it was already dead, but he thought he at least owned this to Benny.
“I didn’t save him for this shit…” he said wrapping his arm around Castiel’s waist, he and Charlie laughed.
Castiel melts even more onto Dean, he felt like the green-eyed bartender was fully determined to make him
“Ah, f-fuck…” Castiel’s hands scramble desperately over Dean’s chest, pulling the tank top off his body.
Castiel looked the come stains in his stomach and sighed dramatically, he could join Dean in the shower, but he knows they won’t do the
Castiel watched as the smaller animals ran away, disappearing from the scenery, the one limping slightly and the other blindly moving its head here and there.
"Mmm...please..." he choked as he was loving the sensation, Castiel pecked Dean's jaw hungrily while Dean continued his massage on his balls, it didn't take long before those fingers grazed on his hole.
… Castiel’s shocked expression turns into concern when he sees the big bloody bruise on Dean’s ribcage.
"Your hair is not that styled today, you always spend at least 15 minutes on your hair, right now they look like you just run your fingers in it. Which means you didn't get late on purpose but didn't sleep well last night.
He left Castiel to go and played it off like he didn't care at all, even though he's in love with him since that night 7 years ago when he met him and it fucking kills him, THE Castiel, the snarky and clever cute secretary (or what Cas likes to remind him to call his position
Castiel smirked once again, winking at her proudly. Dean not only let go of Lindsay—or whatever her name was, but he also started walking towards them, green eyes darker than ever, fuck, he looked so good with his black Led-Zeppelin tank top which was showing his bulky biceps.
The way Dean touched him, licked his blood-stained lips, sucked his pale flesh. It felt like he was born again. How he whispered small nothings in his ear as he took him to climax. Dean's cold body. Rough fingers.
When night fell, Cas grabbed his extra coat and another woolen blanket and sat there, watching the cute predator, he couldn't leave him alone.
Dean moaned and lifted his head up so Cas could have more access to his neck, fingers still massaging Cas' scalp, the other wrapped inside the blue-eyed man's henley tightly on his exposed and warm waist.
The wolf was tired, Castiel gasped in dread when the other smaller wolf bitted, sinking its teeth on the Alpha’s leg.
"He's fine, I think he made a new friend..." Dean grinned when he glanced at Ben showing the blonde girl his car very proudly,
He nodded smiling and slid into the sheets next to Dean who immediately pulled him into his chest and kissed him on the nose. Cas melted into him and closed his eyes breathing Dean's heady sweaty skin.
He snaps his head to look at Dean, when their eyes meet, Castiel’s heart stops and then starts beating even faster.
“Room 404, he just got out the ER, he’s stable.” The nurse confirms and gives him a small polite smile.
A couple of moments later, Dean slid his bag on his shoulder and glanced at Castiel, his gorgeous lips were curled into a smile.
They went downstairs, into a dark booth, Castiel guessed this is the so-called ground basement, but it was no basement or a garage, it was like a secret exit hallway with doors hell knows who lead.
Cas' face falls hearing the slur this woman used, he never heard her say that, but he is not surprised, Carmen is a straight hetero bitch.
Then it hits Castiel, his phone! Maybe Gabe left him a message, his little brother always updates him for his visits. The only problem is he wasn’t supposed to be in Kansas at least until the next weekend.
A tingling intense sensation ran through his spine, his heart felt heavy, but not with fear this time. It was like the creature was calming him down.
The blue-eyed man tilts his head to the side confusingly and some red decorates his cheeks as his eyes widen.
But Dean, that son of a bitch, with those gold-green eyes and that fucking smile, started acting like a boyfriend to Castiel, buying him drinks on the bar he worked and always having his arm around his shoulders, pulling him close when they were out with their squad.
The accountant met the big green-eyed wolf, and relaxed immediately, heart fluttering and a weight leaving his shoulders.
Maybe it wasn't so bad. No one saw him, he didn't ask Dean anything. He could definitely pass it out.
Dean had an arm around protectively like he was afraid Castiel will leave if he let go. They talked about everything and nothing, the accountant updating about his shitty job and the Alpha telling stories about his latest hunts with Sam.
Before he could say something, Claire and Ben hopped up and down and whined, "Can we play with Hazel?"
The thing was though, that his location was quite far from the road and the town. Few people knew his cabin. His grandfather build it after the WW2. The property was private.
He knew things were a little off lately but they always found ways to get through this. They always found each other, they were in love.
Before Dean could grab 2 bottles of beer from the kitchen counter, a redhead—Anna. She’s Cas’ cousin—who was checking him out a lot lately, now bats her eyelashes at him. She’s probably dressed as a slutty Ariel, her red lips smirking at him,
Holding each other tight, they continued fucking, hot and slow, Castiel riding the hot thick flesh moaning hard into Dean's open mouth who started stroking his own cock fast and messy. He wouldn't last long, especially while Dean jacked him so sloppily amazing.
Kissing once again his hair, Castiel, feels Dean drift into sleep, as his breathing starts getting slow.
The green-eyed man rocked gently into him for a moment, riding it out, then stilled and pulled out and slipped off the condom throwing it on the floor.
"Man, I love this song." He said wrapping a hand around Cas' waist, the blue-eyed man squeaked as he placed his hands on Dean's shoulders.
“Tonight, I was coming to find you, to take you back…” Dean said sheepishly, uncertainty lacing his voice.
"Listen here, take my car keys, and go to my apartment, the key is under the doormat. There's food on the fridge and you can sleep on my bed...Okay?" Castiel leans and whispers to Sam, his eyes full of protectiveness.
“You’re here…” Dean smiles as he breaks the silence and Castiel’s heart melts and clenches at the same time.
Dean melted into him and started crying, painful sobs burying in Castiel's neck. The green-eyed man tightened his hold on him.
"If there is anyone in attendance who has cause to believe that this couple should not be joined in marriage..."
Dean's hands clenched on his cheeks as he worked his mouth down Dean's cock, slicking his skin with his wet tongue. Castiel rocked back and forth, taking another inch with every swallow until his nose touched Dean's balls, his cock stretching his throat.
“Dean…” Sam touched gently his shoulder; his brother’s voice filled with worry. Dean knew what the younger wolf was thinking.
“Cas, you sure you want to come with us?” Benny asked turning on his seat so he could see the blue-eyed man. His expression was filled with rage, Benny seemed to hate the plan, but he stayed calm for Dean’s sake.
"Wanna go somewhere private?" Cas asked then seductively, feeling adventurous, lips brushing Dean's ear, he felt the blonde man gripping his waist tighter. He really needed to feel those lips on his.
“You’re so fucking perfect…” Dean rasps before pulling him onto his chest. He places Castiel on his lap and presses his mouth on his.
Castiel got close to the counter, his hands in fists clenching hard as he waited patiently for the woman to tell him the information to where to go.
Dean, wasn't he supposed to be somewhere else? Why was he here? It pained him so much to see his husband like this though.
Castiel sighed and pushed his chair closer to the bed, after a small fight with himself to touch Dean he carefully brushed his long fingers on the green-eyed man’s cheek gently, feeling the rough stubble.
he hissed, pressing down again as his whole body tensed impossibly tight and then released. Castiel shot a seemingly endless stream of come between their bodies, making them once again groan and moan in unison.
Well, not for long, if Cas was quick enough, he could talk to the jock before his other friends came and ruin his chance.
Jody gave him a smirk, but it wasn’t dark, just playful, then after some silence, Sam cleared his throat.
Dean gets cut when Castiel pulls him into him and wraps his arms around the bigger man's waist, before anyone could say anything the blue-eyed man presses softly his lips to Dean's avoiding the bloody cut.
"Sometimes he is, sometimes he's not..." his best friend returned the flirty grin, smiling softly with a dose of sexiness, which made Dean weak on the knees.
Castiel leaned in and licked the head of Dean's cock that was peeking out the foreskin. Dean released a breathy growl at the feeling making the king grin satisfied.
There was something about him that drove him crazy, If someone else would have done this to him, Dean would have cut their hands off. In this case, he was powerless and weak opposing the young emperor.
The couple decided to take some time off, Castiel finally ending his worldwide tour and Dean finishing his filming for the next Supernatural saga movie. They
Cas' eyes widened and he blushed harder. Did Charlie told Dean about him crushing the jock super hard?
After going to the bar and drinking his ass off, trying to forget a certain someone Dean returned to his loft. He wasn't drunk but tipsy, and those blue eyes were still curved in his damn brain. It felt deja-vu, last night was similar to tonight, don't let him start about every time Cas goes on a date.
Dean almost bit his tongue not to blurt how hot he was, sure bros complement each other, but bros also don’t want to take their bro and push him against a wall and
Placing himself between Castiel's legs, Dean started biting and nipping at his neck which had Castiel moaning loudly and wrapping his arms around his neck. He rocked his cock with Dean's own and he could come at any second.
Taking off his cell from the back pocket of his jeans Castiel chokes out a hiccup when he sees the caller.
"Y-You too..." he gasped pulling away from Dean so he could take his pants already. Cas needed to see his cock.
Dean nuzzled the surface over Castiel's collarbone. Arousal flushing all over the blue-eyed man's core.
As Cas ran as fast as he could, jumping two steps at a time, the sound of the preacher's voice was coming closer and closer, his anxiety clouding more by the time he was met with the open Gates of the holy temple that was about to unite his best friend and that horrible woman.
"Yet, you're quite a charmer, I always had a thing for barbaric strong men," The king slid his fingers under his belly button and then went below it, brushing his fingers on the patch of golden hair that disappeared under his satin tunic. Dean couldn't help the throaty groan that escaped his damn mouth.
Sam told on the phone that Dean had an accident. A very serious accident with the impala, someone had run all over him without looking and crashed into Dean’s car.
“I accidentally threw the Bludger ball to you, I don’t even know how it happened…I feel horrible by the way!” the green-eyed lad blushed embarrassed too.
Not that he and Cas minded, he suggested for them to get married in the roadhouse, and Cas had chuckled lovingly and said that he'll marry Dean anywhere. He knew it was true but still, he wanted to be something
"Why do you think I stayed? I could have left when you pulled the bullet, Cas...when I felt your touch, my wolf knew you were the one, he felt your kindness, your pure soul, and how...
Later Hazel flopped at Cas' feet, exhausted, and the kids came over and shoved their way up on the bench, announcing they were hungry. Dean took the sandwiches he had packed and gave everyone one, they all ate silently but he couldn't help his grin when Cas moaned silently at the taste of his cheese mayo pork deliciousness.
“God, you’re an asshole.” Cas shakes his head biting down on his bottom lip to refrain from anger, and damn it, Cas is really trying to hold it in, Dean can just see it.
Starting the engine, Castiel pulled back slowly, even though there were no cars around him to hit accidentally.
, the white roses looked out of a freaking romance novel garden. He still, couldn't believe how Balthazar arranged all this.
“Sam and Jess are waiting for us…” like Charlie knew what he was thinking she grabbed her girlfriend and started walking a couple of steps forward, him and Cas being left out in the back.
Everyone was sitting now, and he realized it was time, Sam took his place beside him and Gabriel was on his right where Cas could join soon.
"Who was that? Your boyfriend?" Dean pushed his face inside the crook of Cas' neck, the blue-eyed man almost moaned when he felt Dean's tongue trailing on his soft skin. He closed his eyes and breathed in Dean's scent as the green-eyed man traced up his neck with nips and bites.
“Hi, how are you? How are the classes? Sick costume by the way.” she smiled unbothered and friendly. Dean started to feel some type of tension between him and Cas.
"I have a lot of enemies Cas, when we were together, Gordon, the vampire who almost killed you, wanted revenge, I killed him. But I needed to present to the Vampire Authority, It's a criminal offense to kill your own kind. I was punished... And I will do it again for you..."
Castiel heard some voices from the speaker, a loud distant sob making its way into his ear and then Sam's annoyed curses. The blue-eyed man froze when he heard Sam exclaiming frustrated a '
Castiel sat down the chair Sam was seconds ago; he bites down on his lips to refrain himself from crying again.
Lust was wrapped all over his body, blood running through his cock as he felt it fattening inside his short tunic.
Cas gripped harder the chair in front of him, his knuckles turning white, every emotion he has inside his chest about to explode.
" he moaned between hot kisses. They stumbled inside his loft closing the door, lips never separating. Dean was in heaven. He touched Cas everywhere, his big hands tracing every inch of Cas' beautiful back and ass. He saw white when his best friend shoved his face in the crook of his neck and started kissing his neck.
After a tense moment where Cas wasn't sure if the wolf was going to try and stand or not, he finally slumped back down on the rags with a plaintive whine, sounding far too much like a dog. Cas stroked it lovingly once, pleased that it didn't react, then peeled his fur aside to examine the wound.
A few moments passed as they both panted breathlessly to each other's mouths before Dean rolled them into the mattress, Castiel winced a bit when the hot softening cock left his puffy rim.
He was tired as hell after all. Michael was once again a pain in the ass, thank God, his parents left him a good amount of patrimony after their death.
The sun was hot and bright, and the air smelled like saltwater and fresh fish. Castiel tipped his chin up to the sky and breathed in sea air. Behind him, Dean hummed quietly as he read a draft of the latest major picture he'll be starring in.
"I love you guys so much..." Cas said looking at them, bliss in his crystal eyes, he kissed Ben's cheek lovingly, then Claire's, and finally his lips met Dean's.
Images of the man Castiel loved (loves) more than anything haunted his mind, his beautiful smile and those breathtaking green eyes he adored sparkling every time they looked at him.
"Hey, it's okay, I'm gonna take care of you..." The blue-eyed man ran his fingers through the golden-grey fur.
Sammy burst into silent laughs, and Dean wanted to slap his stupid floppy hair. Then he watched Benny and Charlie entering the conversation of Cas and that sonovabitch Noah.
Charlie sighed, still looking at him with pity, it was like she knew something. Castiel’s eyes widened.
Charlie, looked at him stunned but she was nodding her head, standing with him, already processing what they would do.
Dean licked into his mouth, sucking his bottom lip, groaning softly, God, how he loved those gorgeous pink lips his wolf had. Castiel is a lucky guy.
Sucking a shaky breath, Cas felt a sob close in his throat. He needed to leave and never turn back, Dean couldn't even look at him anymore. That hurt the most, his favorite person wouldn't be able to look at him anymore without knowing his true feelings.
"Good, now let's go, I'm starving..." the green-eyed man gestured him to get in the passenger's seat.
When Castiel ran inside the LMH Health center, he found a nurse on the reception, her eyes met his and she smiled sympathetically after looking the condition Castiel was.
Dean felt his cheeks getting warmer, this is a ‘couples’ costume. Charlie knew that, so why she insisted for them to be Joker and Harley…
Cas blushed, he probably sounded like a pervert. Dean, then smiled, it was a gorgeous smile and a soft one at the same time.
"Hello, Barbar..." he heard a voice behind him, the sound of it was deep and rich. Turning around Dean's eyes fell on top of a young man. The long aisle was decorated in a deep blue and gold carpet, clay vessels with hieroglyphics, and designs in bronze and sun colors were displayed on each side of the throne. The fire that got out of them was bright and it viewed almost colorful.
Gulping the last drop of his strong drink, Dean exits the office closing the glass door behind him. Cas was already wearing his grey matching suit jacket and grabbing his leather Prada messenger bag, which Dean gifted him last year.
“I-I love you…” Castiel whispered before taking Dean’s hand, kissing the rough knuckles and lying his head down to his side, closing his eyes and hearing his soft breathing and the monitor’s beeping.
breathed and pulled Cas impossibly closer. He buried his face in the blue-eyed man's hair and breathed in deeply.
Today is sunny as yesterday was and the park is packed even more. Dean gets out of the driver's seat and goes to get Ben out of the toddler seat, when both Winchester's are walking towards their usual spot, the green-eyed man locates Cas fixing Claire's hair into a ponytail, their golden retriever sitting patiently next to them.
He closes his eyes for a second and then parks his car in his company’s garage, waving at Tomas, the security guard.
Cas wrapped a towel around the base of the bloody wound, pressed down hard, then tugged. The bullet didn't want to come out, and he had to pull harder, twisting a little. He felt it rip through skin and muscle and the wolf started to struggle as he cried out.
“Wow,” Castiel said as they parked on the crossroad, the hunters were waiting for them, they were at least 20 of them, all holding some sharp blade—probably silver or a gun with obviously silver bullets.
A loud cry of pain made him stop dead in his tracks.  Castiel’s heart was about to rip off his chest. His ears ringed and hands were trembling.
“So beautiful…” Dean whispered, tracing his thumb along Castiel’s bottom lip and he closed his eyes literally purring.
Dean smiled and felt both sober and drunk, he still couldn't believe what the hell he did. Cas was kissing him back though so that was
Then it was kind of hard to sleep with anyone, woman or man. The green-eyed lawyer rarely picked guys, but when his blue-eyed
A few moments later Castiel slid off Dean satisfied at the hickey he gave to his husband. Dean winked at him and they took each other's hands before swimming towards the cave. They splashed here and there playfully and then raced each other, Castiel obviously won, he had stronger legs, yet, Dean had the bulkiest biceps and the broader shoulders.
“So,” Dean pecks Castiel’s nose, “are we,” another peck on his eye, “good?” the last was on his lips.
It hurts not to have them, but it's been 2 years now, since the accident. Balthazar was right for him to get away from the big city in a while. In the beginning, it was painful to come here, usually spending Christmas and New Year's in his small flat.
‘Don’t worry, the boy will be fine…’ a voice came through his mind and Dean is not that dumb to believe that son of a bitch, the piece of shit obviously was lying.
He crawled to lean by the stoned wall, melting at it as the strong pain in his head was getting more and more unpleasant. Sighing he closed his eyes, whoever captured him and/or his men, wanted something with him/them. Maybe a vengeance plan or a sacrifice ritual.  Here in Egyp, the folk was doing shit like that all the time.
love you..." he said seriously still buzzy, but feeling and meaning every word, "I was so jealous of that Noah guy, I thought 68 ways to kill him..."
Every bite was delicious, and their conversation was completely derailed by Castiel failing to hold back hums of pleasure with each new bite. As they ate, Dean made some jokes and told him stories about how once he had got so drunk he sang karaoke.
“I missed you little guy!” she pulled away, setting him to the ground, her hands still on his shoulders.
Castiel moaned, Dean's lips were soft and hot against his own,  he kissed so hungrily yet so sweetly which made Cas see blissful white.
Groaning, Dean softly wiped the wet stained tears from Castiel's cheeks and started peppering kisses all over the blue-eyed man's face.
The green-eyed wolf he so much loved was now running towards the half-destroyed Toyota his little brother was.
Dean untangles their laced fingers and once again and tries to sit up on the bed, wincing once again from the pain.
Dean left before he got more into the twisted strategies of Crowly. After all, he still had dignity and justice was a holy subject to Dean.
Castiel gave him a small peck at the corner of his lips. Dean unwillingly almost chased the blue-eyed man's mouth.
"Bye Dean," Chris waves at him before they get inside the elevator, Cas avoiding his eyes and pressing the button to the ground floor.
Castiel pushed himself to get up and sit into a sitting position, the man in front of him whispered a croaked
So, there were two versions here. 1) Dean hadn’t come out yet, and 2) he was bi and didn’t feel the connection with
Castiel drops his head, looking at his lap like a child failing their parents. Well, what a coincidence he indeed failed his boyfriend.
He was about to turn and leave to go to the library and study for Professor Singer’s ‘Defense Against the Dark Arts’ test they’ll be having tomorrow, but before the blue-eyed student could start walking he felt something heavy hitting him against his back, Castiel yelped as he lost his balance and fell on the ground, the other students avoiding to catch him.
“Jeez, Cas calm down, I can feel your aura, and believe me it makes me depressed…Dean is gonna be alright, he’s the strongest wolf. And your brother is safe, our Alpha is going to get him.”
Dean returned the smile adoringly and captured Cas' lips into another kiss, biting softly his bottom lip and licking into his mouth.
"Nevertheless," he paused for a second, meeting Dean's green orbs, "You may be one of the deadliest men alive, but to me, you are a useless animal..."
"You are pissed or sad about something and don't want to think about it." The blue-eyed man completed, still searching for Dean's eyes, which he avoided like it burned.
“Ah, shit. I have to go, my shift starts in 15’, Pamela’s gonna beat my ass if I’m late again.” He chuckles pulling his black AC/DC t-shirt Castiel so much loved.
Castiel worked his way down Dean's length, sliding back to let his spit ease his path, then pushing forward another inch. The green-eyed's cock pushed his lips wide, and he had to take a breath and urge his jaw to relax to allow him to take more of Dean in. When his cock hit the back of his throat, he swallowed hard.
"Com'ere..." Dean picked up Claire and Cas picked Ben holding the one in one hip and the other on the other. The kids wrapped their arms around their daddies' necks. Dean tightening his grip on Claire kissing her hair, his other hand occupied holding Cas.
Falling on his back into the soft mattress Cas almost whined from the loss of Dean's heated skin and body. The other man grabbed his pants and took out a condom, ripping off the plastic packaging. Cas smirked and spread his legs wider palming himself lazily.
Britney Spears’ “If U Seek Amy” was blasting from the speakers and Castiel was a sucker for Britney and seducing a taken hot guy.
maybe he's a bit overdramatic, nevertheless, it was mean. Whoever did it, didn't know the backstory and how literally he took things seriously.
Then again when he started working for Bobby he took Cas with him again, it took a lot to convince both Cas and Bobby but after all of that, Cas agreed to work again for him with the promise to forget that night and start all over again. Bobby's negative thoughts were that as the bylaws said, ' associates don't entitle to have an assistant. Yet he made an exception for him. And now that Dean is Name Partner after all of his hard work and being the best closer in the whole New York, the only thing that didn't change was his relationship with Cas. They became best friend's and as hard as it is, he's happy they at least are like that.
"Thanks, Cas...for everything..." the giant 17-year old teen gave him a bear hug. Castiel squished him and pulled away, pushing Sam out.
, Cas and his date had to leave the hell out of his damn mind and thinking point or this day will go to trash and he'll snap to the wrong person.
" Cas couldn't help himself but blurt out the last sentence, maybe this was the man that shot the wild animal and left it there to die...
"Okay, talk to you later Balth..." Cas hung up and almost choked as his heart quickened in 100 extra beats.
"Ben, please be careful buddy..." Dean sighed when he saw his son playing with rocks. This kid could literally play with anything--
When they pull away from each other Cas gives him a toothy smile to hide the pain that circles his whole body. Everything he hoped, vanished away, every little desire he had and wished flew out of the window.
Panting, Castiel grinned and brushed his fingers on Dean's come-stained chest, swiping his thumb at the warm seed and offering it to Dean who opened his mouth like a hungry bitch. Lapping at his thumb, Dean sucked his fingers cleaning them like a good boy.
Moaning, Castiel shut his eyes as Dean smeared some lube on his fingers before his hand disappeared into the heat of Castiel's ass again.
, he couldn't believe how fate actually worked, the way they met each other was so random yet so destinated. Dean made Cas forget every little dark thought he ever had. The thing was, how this all will work?
Castiel shuffled on Dean's lap and relaxed even more, his eyes falling on the script Dean held in front of them. They were sitting on a large folding beach chair, Castiel's back was pressed on Dean's bare warm chest, his hands resting on his husband's spread thighs which he was inside. The beautiful view of Mykonos island in front of them, everything blue and foreign in the best way possible.
The kids vibrated in place, huge grins splitting their faces, saying their goodbyes, and giggling at what they'll do tomorrow.
Shaking his head, Castiel took a deep breath, he needed to think Sam, the younger man was practically family, like Dean was, even though they fucked, he cared for both of them like his people.
Seconds later Dean sat on the bed, fully dressed, his eyes met once again those blue orbs he so much missed. Cas had dark shadows under his eyes and looked thinner than the Alpha remembered.
Dean got up and pulled him with him, Castiel squicked but then giggled when Dean grabbed his hand and started running towards the blue sea water. Their toes almost burning at the hot sand.
He pulled him into his chest, wrapping his strong arms around the shaking accountant. Castiel sobbed collapsing to Dean.
Castiel smiled tiredly but as happy as ever, he pulled Dean into his mouth and gave him a slow passionate kiss, running his fingers through the spiky hair, and caressing his face.
The lawyer ignores him as the blonde man seems not to realize the tension between them. He smiles dumbly and accepts Dean's hand.
They layed like this for a while, Dean on top of him, breathing hard, his cock still inside of him. Castiel closed his eyes, praying Dean would stay tonight with him. He knew Dean didn’t cuddle but his warm solid weight in his bed could just make him happy as well.
He also noticed that Dean's friends didn't find the wedding so appealing, Charlie is still shocked and Benny's still tries to not sound mean when he speaks with Carmen.
Cas could feel his whole body shaking as he stared at Dean's back, he seemed tense and nervous, Carmen, on the other hand, was smiling and looked like a pageant queen, behind her, her bridesmaids were wearing gowns shaped like a pastry.
“What the fuck did you do again?” Benny asks not surprised at all. It makes Castiel think that Dean always does dangerous shit that no one is impressed anymore.
“Stop playing with my feelings!” his voice comes so darkly and pained, Dean’s eyes widen in confusion.
, approaching the green-eyed man, Castiel traced the towel slowly onto Dean's chest, wiping the droplets from his toned pecs, which were covered in his Tribe's tattoos.
"I'm very sorry..." his eyes were wide as he looked at Dean, then his lips parted as he checked Dean from the bottom to the top, realizing he's starring too long, the dark-haired guy turned his attention to the dog.
Dean shut his eyes, regret, and humiliation making his knees weak, even though he couldn't feel them.
His prayer crushed down when he felt Dean getting up, his warm skin leaving Castiel’s body. Dean sat on the bed and took out the condom full of his come, tight it into a knot and threw it to the trash basket next to Castiel’s nightstand.
Castiel wrapped a hand around the cock and sucked even faster and stroke what didn't fit, his spit running all over the angry red cock,
"How was that?" Dean asked, kissing his way up Cas' chest. The soft scratch of his beard was almost divine on the blue-eyed man's oversensitive skin. His already rock-hard cock leaked against his stomach, throbbing desperately with every moment he wasn't being touched.
A part of him always believed in something bigger. Dean will never hurt him, the blue-eyed man trusted him, he never stopped loving Castiel. Things might be crazy right now; he might be in danger, but at the moment he needs to feel the man he so much loved, needs to touch him, show him what he means to him.
Dean’s heart starts beating very fast, the world around him blurs out for a moment, the music of the party distancing slowly. He sets his eyes once again across the room, where Cas and that British son of a bitch.
, don’t you dare think like that…” Dean stopped them in the middle of the hallway. The Alpha grabbed his face by each side pulling him into his broad chest.
When Dean slipped the cloth and threw it somewhere, he didn’t even catch Castiel pushing him to sit on the bed.
The night they slept together, Dean didn't believe he would have that again, it was hard to compare or find someone better than Cas.
Suddenly Castiel saw the face he so much loved, his handsome features now hard as he bend down to Castiel, his big palms hugging his face.
Cas’ eyes widen at the confession and before he can answer to him, Dean closes the gap between them, pressing his lips into Cas’ plump ones.
"...to be my w-wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for b-better, for worse... for richer...f-for poorer, in sickness and in health... to lo-ve... and to c-cherish, till dea-th... us... d-do part..." Every word came hard for his best friend to say, it was like,
When he pulled his dick out of his hole, Castiel winced and turned around so he was laying on his back. A moment later Dean did the same.
When they ate, Ben met Jack and a blonde girl, which had nerf guns in each arm, she looked scary but adorable, almost reminded himself, the three of them ran and played at the slides, Dean breathed relieved, everything went easily and it was a nice Saturday afternoon.
Generally, the place wasn't packed but it wasn't empty either, it was early though, especially for a bar, it will crowd later at what he could guess.
"You want my fingers baby?" he asked breathlessly as he pushed one hand in Castiel's cock and stroked his rough palm on his balls brushing slowly his sac.
Before they could even touch their lips together, Cas' phone started ringing. Even being in the middle of the woods, the signal was good, which made Cas' friends call him daily.
To say Dean isn’t surprised will be an understatement, but it was the only way they wouldn’t hurt the Novak kid.
.." the words come before he can stop them, Castiel sighs dreadfully when Dean sniffs and lifts his head up, suddenly the sigh of green bloodshot eyes was too much. The older man's expression is surprised and so gorgeous, even with a split lip he looked
Dean cupped his face and then Castiel saw the next memory, the one which had his heart dropping. Dean's eyes were dark and so intense, pain radiated from him.
“I was planning to get laid tonight and not think about your beautiful ass in these shorts.” Dean said hoarsely, his hands getting lower in Cas’ ass.
Cas hugged Dean's body and ran his fingers on his back, nails slightly scratching the skin. He pressed his lips on Dean's neck and started to suck. Dean was a sobbing mess on top of him as Cas spread his legs wider so the other man could fit between them better, their still clothed cocks rubbing for friction.
