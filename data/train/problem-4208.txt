The little sister he never wanted but loved all the same.
“I just… Cas… Buddy… I’ve never…”
Dean turned off the stove and headed towards the table with another plate of bacon.
Jack wondered if other kids had this many parents looking forward to their first day.
“That he’d… you know… see us… see me as his dad, too.”
Castiel patted his shoulder again before they both turned back to the laptop. As he watched Jack read through all the information, excitement emanating from him, Castiel felt at peace. He knew he was right exactly where he was supposed to be.
So, when Dean caught him lingering outside of his bedroom and asked him ridiculous questions on whether he was pregnant or not and if he was proposing, Sam just blurted it out. And it felt freeing, finally saying it. It had been at the tip of his tongue for months. But, then, the daunting set in.
“Dean, are you mad that I… died?”
He. Can. Feel.
With Castiel happily clutching the bag of their purchase next to him, they made their way to the clothing store where Jack and Sam had gone to. They found his brother sitting on a chair outside the fitting rooms, looking at his phone. He looked up as they approached.
“I’m fine, Dean,” replied the angel, looking at him over his shoulder with a soft smile. “Go mingle.”
Sam felt his brows raise. “You don’t know if you feel the same way.”
A haunted look passed her eyes but it disappeared just as quickly before Castiel could offer any word of comfort.
“I… I’m sorry to hear that, Jack,” was all Sam could manage. “But... you know… things are still new. They’re probably still getting used to it. They’ll come around, I’m sure.”
“What about the angels?” Raphael spoke up, in a low voice. “Are we keeping this a secret from them?”
With a happy grin, Dean helped put the rest of the groceries away. He didn’t need to start cooking until after lunch.
Shoving more cereal into his mouth, Dean couldn’t meet Sam’s eyes but he just knew his brother was judging him.
Jack looked annoyed now. “It’s a nice suit but it’s too…” He seemed to struggle to look for the right word. “Tan,” he decided.
“Yeah.”
“Dean, no!” Sam pushes him back down and Dean realizes that he’s laid on his stomach.
Meanwhile, Dean gets his bandages changed and his back poked and prodded by doctors and nurses. He gets physical therapy and regains control of his arms and legs again.
Sam didn’t hear a response but Dean walked past him, heading quickly for the car. Sam followed after him.
Dean’s lip twitched but he chose not to comment, focused on chopping the celery.
“Sam, shut your cakehole or I swear-.”
Castiel filled a new cup quickly returned to his side. “Where’s Miss Johnson?” he asked, handing the cup over.
There are only the voices.
“You’re our guests,” Dean replied, frowning. “You can just go back out there and relax. Cas, can you bring the beer and soda out? There’s chips too if anyone’s hungry and wanna pre-game.”
Sam rolled his eyes, fondly. “Really, Dean? Can’t go more than 5 hours without talking to Cas?”
Dean blinked. “Uh, yeah.”
Tearing his eyes away from the dog, Sam scanned the grass. He found his brother yelling instructions at Jack, who had a baseball glove in one hand and a ball in the other. Dean, too, was wearing a glove. Sam watched as Jack threw the ball. It fell on the grass, a few inches from Dean, who picked it up.
Dean would have laughed if he didn’t feel offended about the implication to his casserole.
“Is there… something going on… between you and Cas?”
Dean blinked. “Hunting?” he asked, like he didn’t have a clue as to what Castiel was talking about.
“Let me change the question, then,” was out of Dean’s mouth before he could stop himself.
That makes sense, he was stabbed in the back, after all.
“We don’t have to make any big decisions like this now,” she signed to him. “Let’s just focus on finding a place for us, first, okay?” A look of doubt crossed her face. “Do you still want to move in together?”
Both Claire and Kaia froze, mouths open, spoons hanging right by their lips.
Dean didn't know why that simple thing made him so happy. Though, he didn't envy Jack. A history test? No, thanks.
“Then you said all those things about me…”
“Thanks,” Dean replied, proudly. “So, hurry up with everything else if you wanna dig into this bad boy soon.”
Fairy tales often depict step-mothers as evil. But, if Dean became his step-father, Jack wouldn’t really mind. He wasn’t lying when he told Dean that he didn’t think the man would want to be his father. So, calling him his uncle had been the next best thing. But, sometimes, in Jack’s own imagination and fantasies, Dean would be his father. Sam, too. They raised him, after all. It wasn’t a perfect relationship and they had a rocky start. But, Jack loved them both as much as he loved Castiel and his mother. They were his dads, too.
“It wasn’t a big deal, okay?” Dean mumbled, fighting a blush as he shoved another spoon into his mouth and chewed aggressively.
The boy seemed to think about this, his hand still busy scratching Miracle’s head.
Meanwhile, the girls and Jack created their pizzas into masterpieces, courtesy of Claire who proposed the idea. Jack made an angel, its body made up of pepperoni, his wings from peppers, and sausage for a halo. Claire made a wolf, making it mostly out of pepperoni and adding a moon made of sausage. And Kaia’s pizza was a flower, with petals made from mushrooms, leaves from peppers, and some sausage for the center.
So, he grabbed himself a bowl from a cabinet and a spoon from a drawer before sitting across from Jack. He pointed at the cereal box.
Casey opened her mouth to answer and shut it again, looking bewildered at herself. “Honestly, I have no idea. I don’t do sports. I’m actually surprised you’re a jock.”
Because they did. They truly did. They could have it all if they wanted. And Sam wanted it all. He wanted a life with Eileen with a promise of a future. He wanted to go back to school and finish a degree, any degree, just so he could finish what he started so long ago.
Jack beamed at the compliment.
They watched as Jack finally reached the girl and began to talk. The girl looked surprised but not hostile. They couldn’t hear the two teens’ conversation but it must be going well as the girl broke into an amused smile. Jack pointed at the dance floor and she nodded. They didn’t hold hands but Jack led the way and brought her near where Zayn and Casey were dancing together. It looked like some introduction was happening. Zayn and Casey looked nervous upon meeting the girl but, soon enough, all four teenagers began to dance.
Thankfully, Dean came to his rescue. “Actually, I forgot to make the fries. Cas, wanna peel some potatoes for me? Jack, we’ll call you when dinner’s ready.”
“Just grab another, Cas. Mozarella. I’ll go line up.”
Fingers gently caressing his arm.
“Hello, Dean. Dolphins are such fascinating creatures. This one is swimming upside down to mimic-.”
Castiel should say, “no.” It was much too soon. He could wait. Dean was still confused. Perhaps, he was simply caught up in the emotions of the day. He didn’t truly mean it… did he?
Okay, so it was definitely heavier than he anticipated. Dean didn’t really look at the weight, just grabbed the biggest bird he saw in the store’s fridge. But, nothing he couldn’t handle!
“What if they get mad at me?” he asked, afraid.
Dean chuckled and shook his head. “Ask your friends, you won’t survive high school otherwise.”
He walked into the kitchen to see Castiel and Claire amicably chatting about “Lord of the Rings”, the books not the movies. Apparently, despite her cool demeanor and no BS attitude, Claire was a closet nerd.
“…octor says….. blood….”
“Oh!” As if he just remembered that they were there, he gestured to both Castiel and Dean. “Guys, these are Cas and Dean." Then, he gestured to the teens. "These are Zayn and Casey.”
He snorts, forcing himself to look away and seem nonchalant. “If you’re that mad about me dying too soon, fine.” He smirks. “Gotta play nice with God’s dad, right?”
Jody looked annoyed at that but Dean could see the fondness and humor in her eyes.
With that, Castiel wraps his arms around him and Dean closes his eyes and doesn’t hesitate to return the hug. When he feels lips press to the side of his head, soft and affectionate, his heart swells with joy.
He took a deep breath, released it, and rolled his shoulders back. Then, he entered the frenzy.
For some reason, that sentence sent a pang to Dean’s chest. Somehow, he managed to keep his voice steady as he answered, “Well, you’d have gotten there in less than 5 seconds flat. Not suspicious at all, Cas. Besides, the school called me ‘cause you weren’t answering. I’m already worried so I might as well show up.”
“Goodbye-.”
“What would you like to result from this confession of yours, Dean?”
“And I think we could all use a day out,” continued Sam with a wide grin. “It’s the weekend! Anything can happen on a weekend!”
“Dean!” Sam interrupted, flashing him a glare. “Can you stop the interrogation for five seconds?” Without waiting for an answer, he turned back to Jack. “How long are you staying for?”
“I don’t need to sleep.”
His brother glared at him. “Fine. He…” Dean swallowed. “Cas told me that he loved me.”
“Yep! Abby! Finally asked her out! We’re going to the movies tomorrow!”
“You can have all the toppings you want, kid,” Dean proposed. “Come on, let’s get out of here.”
“Yes.”
He’s not sure if he’ll survive if it’s not real.
“Don’t use his voice to trick us, you bastard! I’ll rip your throat out!”
She didn’t finish her sentence, looking off in the distance with a contemplative look.
And it wasn’t about a ghost or a ghoul or the next apocalypse. It was just a history test.
He thought Dean would say “no” instantly. He had always been the ultra-macho brother who wasn’t in touch with his feelings while Sam had no issue touching on his feminine side every now and then. Stanford had done wonders for his toxic masculinity.
Jack’s lips quivered in shame. “I’m sorry.”
“Hear, hear!” Garth hooted.
“Dean! I heard your alarm! You better not still be in bed! We have plenty to do today!”
Dean continued, “Back when Billie was coming after us, you said that the Empty will take you once you’ve experienced true happiness.”
“Doesn’t matter! They’re all going in the same pot! And these are bigger! Come on, Cas!”
“Great, we’ve got time then,” Dean interjected. “You need to explain. Now.”
“Yes.”
Castiel sighed and nodded.
The sun was bright and high in the sky but there were a couple of clouds hanging around. For a summer day, it wasn’t uncomfortable. And, it seemed like they weren’t the only ones who had the bright idea of spending the day at the park. There were kids running around. Dogs were being walked by their owners and a couple of them hung around on the grass. Miracle was having the time of his life playing with these other dogs and chasing squirrels together.
“Forget it, Cas.”
So, when he appeared at the beach, she had given him a hug in greeting, which he eagerly returned, missing the warmth of her affection.
Hanging up, he took a deep breath to try and calm himself. There was no reason to panic. Sure, his grandparents were looking for his mother and his last conversation with them didn’t exactly go well and they believed she had something to do with her disappearance (well, he technically did but not in the way they were thinking)… but there was no need to panic.
True to his word, Castiel arrived by lunchtime. They heard the distinct flapping of his wings and he appeared in the Dean Cave, where they were all having ham and cheese sandwiches for lunch and watching an old re-run of “The Price Is Right.”
All the pain… All the loss… All the sacrifice… All the heartbreak… it wasn’t an easy journey nor was it all pretty… but right now, being held in Dean’s arms while surrounded by empty dishes, their happy and satisfied family and friends just steps away… it was all worth it.
Sam deserved this. He had a woman he loved, a job he was passionate about, and now a kid on the way. There was no doubt that he was going to be an amazing father. And Dean and Castiel would definitely be the favorite uncles.
Castiel looked up. Jack was biting his lip again, looking worried and guilty.
So what the fuck was that?!
Castiel cracked a small amused smile. “Something like that.”
At least that brought a smile to Jack’s face and he finally looked up at Castiel. “I miss her, too. And my Uncles.”
Castiel’s lips twitched, a smile threatening to show itself. But, then, he schooled his face back to inquisitive and approached Dean, taking the seat beside him.
Sighing, Castiel made his way to the head of the table and sat down. “There’s… a complication.”
Dean stopped, his jaw tightening.
“Sit,” he commanded.
“I was thinking mac and cheese,” Dean replied as he folded up the grocery bags to be re-used for later.
The next time he wakes up, he’s less confused. Still a little suspicious. But upon seeing Castiel the moment he opens his eyes, he allows himself to hope that it’s all true.
Ouch, okay. Dean would be proud at the sass if it wasn’t directed at him. But, then again, Castiel was adorable when he was annoyed.
Castiel nodded.
She was wearing a dark yellow sundress, a wide-brimmed straw hat, and black flip-flops. The beach was one of her favorite heavens. Jack often found himself here when he visited her and preferred this one the most. The spa ones were always awkward so he would either ask if she could please switch them to another location or offered to just come back when she wasn’t in the tub. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case today.
Jack looked away from the picture to smile at Zayn. “Hey. How was your day?”
Another one of Dean’s regrets. He wished he had been a better brother to Adam. But, part of him knew it was too little too late. It didn’t mean he had to stop caring. Adam was still family. Maybe one of these days, he and Sam would visit him.
Dean didn’t say anything at that, simply taking a deep breath and opening his eyes. “And this is what you want?”
When the car was parked, Dean wasted no time getting out and grabbing his duffle bag from the back and slinging it over his shoulder. Together, he and Sam made their way inside.
He smiled at his friend. “I’m sure Kelly will do a wonderful job.”
Jack’s head shot up, his eyes wide in disbelief. “R-Really?”
Was he really content with just this for the rest of his life? Hunting, drinking, and hooking up? Living in the bunker? Alone? He didn’t want to be alone. Not anymore.
Sam had to pause for a second to contemplate.
Dean raised an eyebrow. So, this was the girl Jack helped out.
“What? He did the right thing!”
Dean laughed, softly. “Yeah, well, it only took five years and the news that I’m gonna be an Uncle. So, don’t get used to this, Cas.”
“Be gentle.” Her tone and the twinkle in her eyes were teasing.
He took the few steps towards his partner, who was putting the meat in the freezer, and pecked his cheek in appreciation.
“What? No!”
Uncle. Dean was an uncle.
He looked at Dean and realized he loved him?! How?!
“Sure!” said Stevie, picking up a hand turkey, decorated in pink and blue glitter. “Wow, I haven’t made one of these in forever! Yours are pretty cool, Jack. I like the colors.”
“You know that I love you, right, Dean?”
“Nope.”
Dean shook his head. “Look, it doesn’t matter, okay? I care about Cas and I care about his feelings. I’m not going to do anything to hurt him.”
“Sometimes, I wish I had never sped up my growth, that I had been born an infant instead of… of this!”
“You’re not gonna start dressing like a goth, are ya?” Dean asked, partly joking and partly dreading the thought.
A spark of hope appeared in the woman’s eyes. “You know about our Kelly?”
She finally broke into a small fond smile. “Yeah… Yeah, I know.”
Study.
Despite the long drive, Dean was giddy.
It felt like a horse had kicked Dean in the chest. Everything suddenly hurt.
Dean hummed but said no more.
Castiel beamed. “Good night, Dean.”
From his seat, Jack giggled and Dean resisted the urge to glare at the kid. He thought he must have done it anyway because Jack immediately looked away and concentrated on the rest of his cone.
On Jack’s first day of school, Castiel paced. A lot.
Sam wrinkled his nose. “What? No!”
Right now, he just wanted to enjoy his time with Castiel.
Jack didn’t move. In fact, he continued to stare at Dean with that sad puppy dog face that made the parental instincts in him rear its head.
“Shut up. I’m just glad to be back, okay?”
Dean had to make things right.
Did Castiel change his mind? Is it because Dean didn’t try to get him out of The Empty? Is he angry? Did Dean mess things up before they even started?
Castiel nodded and picked up a jar to examine it. “Are these ethically produced?” he asked, seriously.
The two women flashed each other looks, communicating with their eyes. It was a bit fascinating to watch. Dean and Castiel often did the same and so did Sam and Eileen.
Sam rolled his eyes. Why was his brother so freakin’ stubborn?!
“Thanks, Cas.”
Jack beamed. “I’m happy to meet you, too, Claire!”
Castiel met Dean’s hopeful gaze. “So…?”
“Um… library?”
Good-naturedly, Zayn simply ruffled her hair and slapped Jack on the back before wishing them both a good weekend and heading off to practice.
Dean kept his gaze on the sky as Castiel left.
“Robotics club?” Jack questioned, his head cocked to the side. “You made robots?”
But, something was niggling at his brain, not leaving him alone in peace. He couldn’t help it. After their visit to the Klines, seeing them get the closure they so needed from the loss of their daughter and grandchild, it made him think.
Even if he didn't do it, it still felt like Jack had used his powers to send him careening towards the wall anyway because the impact of those last words hurt Castiel more than any of his deaths combined.
The hunter was a friend of Jody’s, completely new to the profession but eager to be part of it after almost losing his sister to a vampire. Jody and the girls had assisted and, ever since, he couldn’t help but be drawn to the life. Dean understood. It was difficult to turn a blind eye to the supernatural once you’ve seen some horror shit. When the hunter got stuck on figuring out what was wrong, Jody had sent him the Winchester’s way and Dean was only too happy to help, just for a bit of a distraction from this whole Jack situation.
It took a couple of minutes and another press before they heard a, “Coming!” from a soft feminine voice. Then, the door opened, revealing an older woman with graying hair and kind but confused brown eyes. She looked just like Kelly.
Less than a week later, Dean found himself outside of Jack’s school, wearing one of his nicer FBI suits, sans the tie.
“Are you still angry, Dean?”
But, it’s more time than he ever hoped to have.
Dean snorted. “Great. Now, tell me the real reason.”
“And, these other ones are a dollar cheaper!”
And Sam... Sam...
But, this chapter has some special guests so I hope I made up for it, somehow?
“Nothing’s up,” Jack finally answered, though he couldn’t look them in the eye. “Can’t I just come for a social visit?”
“Hey!” He waved at the screen.
Dean focuses on Castiel.
“So… you and Cas?”
“I… you’re welcome, Dean,” replied the angel, tugging a bit at the hem of his t-shirt.
“Damn, Cas.” He didn’t even think of that. “I… I guess that could work.”
The weather was definitely hot but it was also pleasant. And, since it was the middle of a school day, there weren’t a lot of people out and about.
Castiel resisted the urge to sigh loudly as he finished placing all their items in bags.
“Oh, yeah!” Jody began folding her sleeves up to her elbows. “Where do you need us?”
He spotted Jack sitting on the bench they agreed on, Miracle being doted on by some kids. While the dog was enjoying the pats, Jack had his gaze on a far-off direction, looking contemplative. His brows were all scrunched up. Near him, there was a group of teenagers, talking loudly and excitedly about their upcoming Senior Year. (Sam caught the words "prom", "graduation", and "college applications.")
Amara seemed to ponder on this before giving him an answer. “I can’t guarantee that they won’t have strong feelings about this. But, I know that they love you, just as I love you. We want you to be happy. And, if this is what you need, then I don’t see why they could deny you.” She let out a sigh. “Sometimes, I wish…”
Castiel did, feeling his stomach flip-flopping with what he perceived to be anxiety.
For the first time since he arrived at the bunker, Castiel realized that he hadn’t paid Sam any attention or acknowledgment. It was quite rude and he felt embarrassed by his actions towards his friend.
“And a few inches more and I would have lost you! Do you know what that would have done to me?! I’d never forgive myself.”
After the incident with Dylan the bully last week, they had become “official friends”, to quote Casey. She even accompanied him to detention those three days. The teacher watching them was the school librarian and she was fond of Casey, so she let the teen hang around. Jack didn’t understand why detention was a punishment, though. He was able to finish his homework and study for his History test in relative quiet.
“Dean?”
“I could… de-age myself,” Jack said, at last.
His tone indicated his mood as “pissed off.”
Dean flashed him an exasperated yet fond look. “Yeah, well, I think, having all of us here, together, sharing a meal and celebrating Thanksgiving, is kind of a miracle, itself. You know, we consider all of you family and… um…”
Castiel pressed his lips together, unsure. “Do you mind?”
“It’s okay,” signed Eileen, with a smile. “I understand. And we’re not in a rush. We have all the time in the world, now, Sam.”
Dean might not be saying much about it but Sam knew he was worried. His brother kept shooting Jack these long, contemplative looks and asking him if he was sure almost every hour. Sam, himself, was a little apprehensive about what they were about to do. It could either go without a hitch or end up with very drastic results.
So, when Dean woke up gasping from another nightmare, his hand reached out to his bedside table for a bottle of beer or gin or whatever he managed to get his hands on that day. His fingers only met air and when Dean turned his head to look, he loudly groaned in disappointment to find nothing there. His bedside clock, however, boasted in bright red colors that it was only 4:15am. Yet, he was feeling wide awake.
Castiel nodded again. “Thank you, Dean. You’re a good father.”
Metatron may have given vast knowledge on all things pop culture but Castiel found that he preferred to enjoy them through first-hand experience.
“I… I know I have plenty to explain.”
The angel furrowed his brow. “What about your suit?”
“I know, but-.”
“Hello, Sam,” he said, reaching up to wrap his arms around the taller Winchester.
And they’re getting louder now.
Without a word, Dean stood up and walked off to look for ties. He found a rack of neckties nearby and, going through them quickly, he picked out a couple of slim black ones – plain, dotted, and striped. He walked back to the fitting rooms and found Jack still standing there, waiting.
Castiel always made good points.
“Yeah… yeah, that’s fine.”
She beamed right back at him, full of trust and gratitude.
“Hey, I’ll talk to him, don’t worry. We’ve been planning for months and I’m not backing out or changing my mind, okay?”
He was determined to make this a good day for all of them. He just wished Castiel would return by the time they had to leave, but he wasn’t holding his breath. As long as the angel came back, Dean was gonna wait for him.
“He’s our friend, he’s always welcomed to visit.”
Dean let out a breath. “I know… I know… I was an idiot, I get it. But, I really am trying.”
It made Castiel happy, too, judging from the beam he sent Dean’s way.
Jack seemed to take Sam’s observation seriously as he bit his lip and stared down at the table. They let him contemplate, continuing to eat and discuss what high school was like for them. Eileen shared that she was homeschooled by Lillian until the woman’s death. Since then, she borrowed books at the library and got her GED. Dean high-fived her, as they were GED buddies.
“Hmm? Yeah, I guess it’s okay.”
The principal sighed. “Jack hit another student.”
Castiel managed to maintain a neutral front even as his stomach lurched unpleasantly. Were teachers even allowed to make such advances on parents? It seemed so inappropriate.
“Alrighty.”
“And it smells fantastic!” Stevie piped, sniffing the air.
“You okay?” Sam asked, gently as he turned around to look at him.
Back before Dean and Sam and his turning away from Heaven, Castiel took flying for granted. After all, it was something that was natural for angels as breathing is for humans. Losing his wings felt like losing a part of himself that made him…
“Yeah, they’re out there playing with Jack and the dog. Thanks a lot for that, by the way. Now Claire and Kaia won’t stop pestering me about getting a dog! And Patience and Alex are on their side!”
Jack waved goodbye to him, feeling lighter and a little less nervous. He felt more emboldened now that he possibly made a friend. He hoped Zayn would be his friend, he was nice.
Castiel finally tore his gaze away from Dean to look at Jack, who hung his head.
Dean paused. “Why not wear your FBI suit? It’s a formal event, right? I think I put it with the rest of your stuff.”
“You can drop off your stuff in your room. Cas labeled which ones yours.”
“Oh.” Jack seemed surprised at that query. “Yeah, I guess? Is it okay if I call you that?”
“I’m done!” he said, proudly raising the shopping bag and handing Dean his credit card back. “Where’s Cas?”
And that was how Dean found himself back in the kitchen making stuffing and being assisted by, of all people, Bobby. Even though he wasn’t their Bobby, cooking with him took Dean back.
Jack appeared to not hear. Instead, he looked in the direction of the kitchen, subtly sniffing the air.
“I’m Miss Johnson. Clara. English teacher.”
“Nothing, Sammy.”
“Is something going on with you and Cas?” Sam asked.
Hunting would always be in his blood.
“We shouldn’t have left them, Sammy! We should have-.”
“Did you say ‘yes’?” he asked and immediately felt silly.
When dinner was over, Castiel and Jack did the dishes while Sam and Eileen loaded his things into her car. Then, the happy couple said their goodbyes and were off.
Now that he knew how they felt against his, knew about the pleasant way his body could burn without killing him, Castiel realized that he may have found one more thing to love about Dean.
“Hey, guys!” He got to his feet. “Jack’s trying some stuff on but I have to call Eileen.”
“It’s partly my fault too, Cas.” Dean looked genuinely haunted by the notion. “I wasn’t good to him, at first. And every time something happened, I blamed him. Him and you. Cas, I… I never…”
Quietly, the older Winchester stood up, headed for the kitchen counters, and snagged two knives. Sam followed behind him, taking the second knife Dean wordlessly offered.
For months, he had all these doubts running through his head. He had read that God was supposed to be all-knowing and all-seeing. But, Jack was clueless and awkward and easily distracted. Was he even the right person for this job?
The front of the building donned a banner that said “John Adams High School Fall Dance 2021.”
“We’re alright. I drove Jack to school this morning and I’m waiting until his dismissal.”
“Our family,” Castiel agreed.
They all looked up as Castiel entered and closed the door.
The hunter didn’t answer but the sound of running water ceased. Castiel paid it no mind, his concentration focused on making sure no cranberry sauce spilled out of the sides of the container. Seeing the sauce brought the memory of baby Castiel and baby Sam at dinner, having a taste of the cranberry sauce and getting it all over their faces. It was rather adorable. They both were. Castiel wondered if Jack would have been just as adorable as a baby.
The angel laughs. “Me? I’ll wait. Like I always do. It appears that I’m quite good at waiting when it comes to you.”
“It’s… a long story.”
“Nah. I’ll make sure he knows I’m tired of his ugly mug.”
Once they made it to the end of their usual route, Dean gently tugged on her leash, signaling that it was time to return home.
“I feel like ice cream. You?”
Jack’s excited face fell, immediately, replaced by disappointment. “Only a year?” he asked, softly.
Dean liked cooking. And, don’t tell Sam, but he especially liked cooking for his brother. At the end of the day, Dean was still a big brother who wanted to take care of his baby brother, no matter how old they both were now. (But, even if he had a gun pointed at his head or was back at Hell’s gates, he would never confess to it.)
“I... I ran away!”
He was getting even more tired now. This was why feelings and chick flick moments were a no-go for him. He always felt exhausted after them. Why other people loved talking about their feelings, he would never understand the appeal.
“I just want you to be happy.”
He responded with a kiss to her head before pulling back a little so she could see his face.
He pushed the laptop towards Jack, who carefully received it with a frown. “How do I know what’s a good fit for me?”
“But, what about Heaven?” Raphael asked, sounding defeated. “What about us?”
The rest of the drive was quiet. They briefly stopped at a motel, just outside of Montana, for the night. The next day, they were off again. And, maybe Dean called Castiel about ten more times, just to check in. Who knew how long this was gonna take? There was nothing wrong with checking in on your friend, your kid, and your dog!
“No, thank you.”
“Dean.” Castiel was scolding but it was in a fond tone.
“For real?!”
“Oh. I see.” He paused, thinking. “So… you’re not angry at me, anymore.”
Once they were both ready, Sam grabbed the duffle bag of things Castiel had packed and followed Dean and Jack to the Impala. The drive to the Kline residence was silent, almost like everyone was holding their breath.
“I… yes.” Castiel looked resigned now, like Dean had just yelled “Off with your head!” at him.
He’s still on his stomach and he struggles to move himself to a more comfortable position. He’s hooked to an I.V. and a few other wires, which is really annoying.
He’d rather die again.
“Jack stayed up all night making them,” said Eileen, proudly.
His chest felt lighter and he felt like skipping down the hall to his room. He couldn’t wait to tell Eileen everything.
You could hear a pin drop with how loud the silence that enveloped them was. Somewhere in the bunker, Sam and Jack were probably wondering what was taking them so long. And Dean hoped that Sam had the sense to not look for them. Because right now, Castiel wasn’t saying anything. And he couldn’t help but worry that he was too late. If he waited too long and Castiel no longer wanted anything to do with him.
“How did you…”
“Yes, you did,” Sam laughed.
Yet, Dean has never felt such peace.
Bobby shrugged. “Nowhere. Just wonderin’.”
She grinned at him. Dean felt his lip quirk. He should be annoyed at the “old man” comment. But, he did remember that day. It was one of those rare times when he actually had fun. Plus, he bonded with Claire, just when he thought she would never forgive him. It was a cherished memory.
The principal cleared her throat and they turned her attention back to her. Them supporting Jack was definitely not a reaction she expected. Dean could see the disapproval in her eyes.
Jack’s eyes were shining and he was finally,
The three of them spun the dough into mini pizzas, competitively aiming the create the most perfect circle. Castiel won but it didn’t matter because it was time to slap on the sauce, cheese, and toppings.
“Agents,” he greeted, extending a hand to them to shake. “Is it true? You found our Kelly?”
“They’re happy, Dean.”
However, Dean had the sudden nagging feeling that he was forgetting something.
Still in a daze, Dean continued to lay in bed, blinking at the ceiling as he tried to hold on to the last vestiges of his dream.
As he walked down the hall to his room, he spotted Castiel, Claire, and Kaia standing outside Jack’s room, wishing him a good night. Castiel leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Jack’s head. Kaia hugged him and Claire slapped his arm. Then, the boy entered his room and shut the door behind him.
“Right back at ya.” Dean leaned back on his chair. “How are you doing, man?”
“Dean, you know I didn’t have a choice. I needed to save you.”
Castiel’s arms tightened around him. “I’m sure Jack has turned heaven into a wonderful place again. But, promise me, Dean, that you won’t go there yet. Not until your hair turns gray and your skin turns wrinkly.”
Dean took the cup. “I think she went to ask the baseball coach for a dance.”
There was a twinge in Dean’s chest but he couldn’t tell what it was. It was unfamiliar. Or, perhaps, he just didn’t want to dwell on it too much.
Stevie simply offered him a fist bump, not much of a huggy person like Charlie was, before handing him a large gift bag. Dean looked inside to find two bottles of wine.
Dean looked up at the door, daring it to open. It didn’t but another series of bangs shook the walls.
“In the meantime, Jack’s duties will be divided among the three of us-.”
Seeming to have forgotten their conversation, Jack ambled after the angel. And, unfortunately, it was never brought up again because Sam had returned from his phone call. Then, they went to get Jack new dress shoes at a Payless store. And, after that, they went for ice cream.
Besides, Dean was more of a man of action, anyway.
Did he really have to do this? People were staring.
So, he stood there, waiting for several more minutes.
A high school dance was most definitely different from the movies yet still profoundly the same. There are children in all manners of formal dress. Teachers and parents in every corner, watching them interact like hawks watching their prey. The food provided were simple finger treats, not really conducive to a healthy diet for growing bodies. And the music was whatever was popular on the radio, based on Dean’s disgusted reaction to the current song playing. It was rap and Castiel had to strain his ears to understand the lyrics. He didn’t see the words worthy of repeating out loud.
“We can do this the easy way or the holy fire way. Take your pick, Cas.”
“I did. I asked for his name and checked the records, myself. He’s not in Heaven. So, I got in touch with Rowena and she confirmed it for me… he’s there.”
It was the first time since he arrived that he mentioned Kelly. Of course, they knew that the kid had reunited with his mother in Heaven but to hear about it first hand was… quite touching.
“I’m sorry for saying that!” the boy interjected, distressed. “I didn’t mean it. You’re a good father, Castiel. I was just… frustrated.”
Finally, Castiel and Claire broke their hug. The angel smiled at his surrogate daughter and then at Kaia. He said something to the latter, who blushed in response and nodded. Claire took her hand, squeezing it in hers, looking every bit in love and enamored by the shorter girl.
Sam snorts as he turns the key to start the engine.
“Hello, may I help you?” she asked, polite but wary.
To his further confusion, Dean chuckled. “Ahhh, forgot you’ve got an innocent mind, kid. Your head’s not in the gutter yet like all the other kids.”
“So, what’s bothering you?”
Dean scoffed. “Touché.”
. They had started buying it after Jack pointed it out at the store a couple of years ago, delighted by bear on the box and alliteration of the name. Sam only agreed to buy it if Jack promised to eat it in moderation.
Subtly, Dean reached out and squeezed the angel’s wrist since his hands were full with a 6-pack case of beer in one hand and a liter of Coke and a bag of potato chips in the other.
“I… can’t believe we forgot about Sam,” said Castiel.
Dean, too, seemed better. Lighter. Happier. As if a giant weight had been lifted from his shoulders. And Sam didn’t find him passed out surrounded by beer bottles that morning. It was a big win.
“Hi, Dean. The food smells great! I’m starving!”
“Hey, there, girl! You missed me? I missed you! Has Sammy been taking good care of you? I bet he doesn’t let you eat off the pans, does he? Don’t worry, things are gonna be back to normal now.”
Castiel suddenly felt restless, shifting a bit on his feet as the woman got closer and closer. And, suddenly, she was there in front of them, smiling shyly at Dean.
He hummed. “She gave me her number,” he stated before folding it.
The cashier flashed Castiel a quick, professional smile before going back to her task of checking out… and continuing to flirt with Dean.
“Like what?”
“But, I think my dream got it wrong,” he continued. “That wasn’t heaven. Not to me. My heaven is down here. With Sam. Eileen. Miracle. And everyone we found along the way.” He turned his head, meeting Castiel’s pretty blue eyes. “And, you, of course. There’s no heaven without you, Cas.”
“Next time, we’ll go to a batting cage and I’ll teach you how to bat,” Dean had promised Jack in the car.
Dean hung up and dialed again.
“Great.” Dean shuffled his feet. “Uh, it’s getting pretty late.”
Damn, he was getting old.
“You sure?” Gabriel asked, brow furrowing. “It’s a lot of work and I don’t know if you-.”
“Hold on just a second there, hot wings. You ain’t leaving 'til you explain everything.”
Miracle began to whine and tug on her leash so Dean said his goodbyes and went on his way.
Perhaps, Jack was overthinking? Being in high school not only expanded his education on humanity but also opened his eyes to the world of hormones, attraction, and flirtation. He still didn’t understand it most of the time but it was fascinating to watch the way relationships unfolded in front of his very eyes.
Enjoy!
“I don’t want to.”
Castiel met his eyes, his gaze soft, affectionate, and loving as it had always been.
The hunter looked up from the plate of mini hotdogs he was stuffing his face with. “Mmm?”
“I should head to bed,” the boy announced as he began to exit the room.
“Yes, definitely,” Sam replied, quickly. “I’ll talk to Dean soon.”
Jack blinked. “Freshie?”
“Are we good?”
Dean, too, went back to peeling potatoes.
“But I couldn’t do it,” he continued. “We were right there, outside her house, and I couldn’t do it. Do you know why?”
“About?”
It took Jack a few seconds to give him an answer. “Just curious.”
She snorted. “Nah, I’m over it. Just…” She pressed her lips into a thin line. “I don’t know. Jack is Cas’ kid now, right? He’s his priority, not…”
“What should we have for lunch?” he asked, snuggling to his side.
“I will return, Dean. I promise.”
It seemed like that thought didn’t occur to Sam. He looked worried now.
“I mean, unless you want the full high school experience, you wouldn’t miss out on much,” said Kaia. “You probably like the learning part more.”
Sure, Dean still had trouble expressing his feelings (thanks for that, Dad). He rarely even said the words that Castiel freely expressed. But, the advantage of them having their so-called profound bond was that he didn’t need to really say anything for his partner to know how he truly felt about him.
Castiel looked up, flashed the hunter a weak smile, and nodded.
Dean cleared his throat. “We just got back.”
Zayn turned his attention back to his locker, putting notebooks in.
He was okay. He wasn't dead. He was alive. Living. Breathing. Blood running through his veins.
“I mean… it was high school. There were hierarchies and peer pressure. It was hard to make friends when you were always the new kid. But, I liked learning. History and science were my favorite subjects. I even went to college and was gonna go to Law School but… well… things happened.”
“It just got to be too much.”
Sam forced himself to continue. “There was an accident… we’re sorry but… Kelly died.”
“Yes, we had a good time catching up,” he replied.
Dean picked out two rolls of pepperoni and placed them in the cart.
He needed it today. Sam and Eileen were coming over tonight and there was a lot to get done around the house.
Miracle is running towards him, barking her head off. Laughing, Dean crouches down, carefully, and opens his arms to hold her.
Jack’s eyes widened when Castiel responded by blushing.
“Alrighty, Sammy, let’s set the table!”
Sam didn’t mean to have it all spilling out. He didn’t want to worry Jack any more than he needed to be. But, he rarely expressed how deep his worry and concern for Dean really was. Sometimes, he would talk to Jody about it but she already had four of her own to worry about, he didn’t want to add one more. He could talk to Bobby but, no matter how hard he tried, he just wasn’t the same as their Bobby.
“All parental.”
“Saving people, hunting things, that’s the family business, right?”
Once he was sure that Jack wouldn’t send him flying against the wall at any point, Castiel moved closer and placed a gentle hand on the boy’s arm.
“I was thinking… You know, if Eileen and I get to the point in our life when we get married and have a kid, I might need something to fall back on aside from hunting. It doesn’t exactly have a stable salary.”
“Hey.” He wants to lift a hand to nudge the angel but his limbs feel too heavy so he just grins. “I’m alive. By some miracle, apparently.”
Jack looked confused. “I… won’t?”
“I’m willing to try.”
Oh, was that what she was worried about?
Interesting.
“I love you, too. Night.”
Jack hummed in response.
He could smell the eggs and bacon before he even made it to the bottom of the stairs. So, at least Dean had gotten up on time. Sam could even hear him cooing at Miracle, telling the dog what a good boy he was.
“What’s up, Sammy?”
Some of the kids called out their own greetings, dropping off their papers at the desk.
She looked at him, questions clearly in her eyes. “Um… I was scrolling through Facebook and found this.” She turned her phone around to show him. “Isn’t that… your mom?”
The crooked smile flashed at him struck him dumb on the spot, unable to move or think coherently. “Hello, Dean.”
She waved a hand in dismissal before removing her flip-flops and plopping on the sand. She patted the space next to her and he, too, sat and removed his sneakers and socks. The sand was warm under his feet and the sand tickled between his toes. It was nice.
And, just like that, Dean sped out of the kitchen, muttering something incomprehensible under his breath.
“How are you, Dean?” he managed to ask.
The butterflies in Jack’s stomach intensified but he stepped out anyway. He barely registered the Impala’s doors closing as excited voices reached his ears. He watched the other students leave their respective parents’ cars. Some were running to meet their friends with hugs. Some had their heads down as they walked to the building. There was a group taking a selfie. It was a chaotic mess. Jack was excited to join it.
“Cas, I… I don’t know how I feel, exactly.” His palms felt all sweaty as his throat tightened. “All I know is that you’re important to me and I need you to know that I see you in whatever life is in store for me in the future. And I can’t imagine it otherwise. Cas, please…”
The kid looked hopefully at his surrogate father. He was practically bouncing on his feet – from nerves or excitement, Dean wasn’t sure. But, looking at Castiel’s face, the angel seemed to hesitate, unsure of the importance of this request.
“I was worried.”
“Nah. Go ahead, buddy.”
At the shop, he went with a cup of regular froyo and topped it with chocolate sprinkles, nougat, and, for Sam’s peace of mind, strawberries. Claire and Kaia both filled theirs with a lot of rainbow sprinkles, chocolate chips, and coconut shavings. Then, they found an empty table under an umbrella outside and settled in to eat their treat.
“So, what were you two talking about?”
By the time Dean was ready to fall asleep in his seat, Jack made his final choices.
“Would you have gotten involved with her then? If she wasn’t Jack’s teacher?” Castiel cursed his curiosity, sometimes. “Say, if you met her somewhere else? Like a bar or… a park.”
“What are their names?” Castiel asked, gingerly picking up the child at his feet, as if the baby would break like glass in his arms if he wasn’t careful.
“He makes a good point,” Sam said as he sat down next to Jack with a bowl of cubed fruit. “I remember my first Dance. I wore Dean’s hand-me-downs. It was two sizes big on me. So, yeah, we can take you, Jack.
“It’s charging, it had run out of battery. I didn’t know the school would call.”
By the time he was finished cleaning up and getting dressed, noises downstairs and a cooing of Miracle’s name indicated that Castiel was back from the store.
Dean frowned. “You hit someone?”
Dean was already running to the garage doors to look for Castiel.
Jack nodded, eagerly. “Thank you, Dean!”
Dean closed his eyes, feeling a headache coming along.
“You asked me that question many times today,” replied the angel, sounding amused.
“Oh, I assist Jack. He creates the plans, I ensure that they’re taken care of. He also decided to break down the barriers that created individual heavens and has placed me in charge of the rebuilding.”
“So, enough about me,” Claire said. “Any cute girls at that school? Or guys?”
“Give me a few more minutes.”
The forks clanged against the plates accompanied by the sounds of chewing. Every now and then, Miracle would whine, hoping to get a piece of bacon. (Dean snuck her a few when Castiel went to refill his coffee mug.)
“A what?!” Casey began frantically running her fingers through her hair, wanting to shake off the non-existent spider.
“Then how else did he suddenly start thinking about leaving and going to high school?” Kelly snapped at Castiel.
“Your first time spending Thanksgiving like this, right?”
“Story of our lives, Sammy.”
To his surprise, Dean’s cheeks darkened and he coughed.
As if just realizing that there was a reason Castiel hadn’t entered yet, Sam shuffled off to, presumably, take care of the wards. Unfortunately, this left him at an awkward standoff with Dean, who was still glaring at him. Castiel guiltily shuffled on his feet.
Coffee prepared, Sam made his way to the table and pushed one mug to Eileen before filling his plate with turkey bacon and, reluctantly, the eggs.
Lowering his eyes with shame, Gabriel shook his head. “He’s not dad,” he said, with less vitriol this time. “He won’t leave us just like that. Not the way he did.”
Sam hummed. "We talked about moving out of the bunker and getting a house and everything. Maybe get married, officially.” Sam took another sip of beer. “But, cases don’t end just ‘cause a hunter takes a break, right?”
Castiel’s eyes practically sparkled at the suggestion of his favorite food in the entire world.
Beside Dean, Castiel chuckled. “You go on ahead and meet with your friends, Jack.”
Castiel’s chest felt warm. “I’m thankful as well, Dean. For today. And for all those years ago when my garrison received the call to rescue you. That day changed my life, my entire existence.”
Castiel felt one of his eyebrows fly up, astonished and impressed.
The rest of the drive to school was silent but comfortable. Dean resumed humming with the song playing and Jack looked out the window, thinking about his schedule for the day. He knew that Castiel had packed him some extra nougat to share with Casey and Zayn as well as some cut-up fruit. He had an English report to present and a Math quiz to take.
Because Dean didn’t say anything for a long time, his face blank and his jaw tight.
“Of course!” She stepped aside and politely let them in.
The three still looked skeptical, flashing each other looks in that way they always did when they were having silent conversations.
A/N: Thank you for being patient but here's a brand new chapter! Lots of feelings here, people!
The angel turned to the T.V., frowning. “We missed most of the movie.”
Within seconds, Sam comes into view. He looks awful. The mop that he calls hair looks like it hasn’t been brushed in days. The dark circles under his eyes are even darker like he’s some kind of giant raccoon. And his clothes are the same ones he wore during their hunt.
Jack chuckled as he handed Dean’s card over. “At least working with your family brings you good things,” he said.
“… but my vessel is male. Angels… We don’t have a gender. Although, I’ve taken a female vessel before…”
Dean thinks.
Castiel hummed in agreement. He couldn’t think of a proper response, either, his mind still reeling as his lips tingled with the need to know how Dean tasted.
“Trust me. I’m God.” He winked for good measure.
“So, kid, not that we’re not happy to see you,” Dean began. “But... uh... why are you back here?”
“But… what about you?”
“Yeah, buddy?” The car paused at a red light.
Jack bit his lip, thinking about how to phrase his words that wouldn't startle the man. He had learned a lot about social cues and propriety in school, especially from Casey and Zayn, who were so patient and understanding about his “homeschooling” upbringing. So, now, Jack knew that being direct and shocking people wasn’t always the way to go. He had to ease into topics, sometimes, especially because Dean was so easily startled when caught off-guard.
“You got this, Jack,” he whispered to himself. “You’re just a regular kid right now. You can do this.”
Castiel chuckled. “Yes, I suppose I am. You should go to bed, too, Dean.”
“Oh,” Dean heard Castiel whisper.
“Um… Dunno… Your call.”
“When did you guys get back?” Dean asked, passing the basket of dinner rolls to Castiel.
Castiel turned around and spotted Dean, who finally decided to approach. Castiel met him halfway.
He stared down at all the plates arranged on the table. There were scrambled eggs, bacon, waffles, and chocolate chip pancakes.
Dean closed his eyes, emptying his mind of any thoughts – past, present, or future. Especially the past.
“Yeah, you too.”
They continued to be silent as the song continued. Dean’s brows were furrowed as if he was concentrating very hard on something. When the song ended, Dean excused himself to get more food and refreshment. It was right then that Jack popped into Castiel’s line of vision and before he knew what was happening, Jack and his friends had pulled him onto the dance floor.
He was sure the food was as delicious as Dean claimed. After all, Dean took food, seriously. Besides, Sam, Jack, and even Mary back when she was still here all loved Dean’s cooking.
They stood in silence for a moment, just watching the three sitting at the table. Kaia was asking Sam questions now and Dean’s little brother was all too happy to answer.
“Until you’re well enough to leave the hospital.”
“Yes, I would like to be there, even if it’s just in the car.”
Jack sent a frustrated-looking Angie an encouraging look before heading down to the seats. Casey was there, going through her phone. She wasn’t part of the play but was bored and didn’t want to go home, yet. So, she was here for moral support… and the free snacks.
“Why would I be angry, Cas?”
He’s here. He’s still alive. And Castiel has returned to them. To him.
“What, Heaven doesn’t give you PTOs or something?”
“Yeah…”
Other kids and their parents were stopping in their tracks to watch him now. Some pointed at Jack. He could feel his cheeks and ears reddening in embarrassment and turmoil. The movies and T.V. shows never went over this!
Okay, it wasn’t like they all sat down at dinner and placed labels on what Dean and Sam were to Jack. Castiel had always had the label of “father”, even if Jack rarely called him “dad”, so that one was a given. But Dean and Sam partially raised Jack. It may have started off rocky but they considered Jack their kid. It wasn’t like Dean was itching for Jack to call him “dad” but… well… he thought that maybe Jack would have seen him like a dad. Dean may not have made it easy for him, at first, but he thought he had made up for it… right?
“So… you meant it.”
“Dean…” Sam looked like he was about to start crying.
“I can stay here?”
When he was done, she was frowning at him, confused. “Um… what are you doing?” she asked.
Dean made a humming sound, his lip twitching. “So? What do you think of your first high school dance?”
“So… you don’t want to date because you’re actually with Cas?” Sam guessed.
Dean smiled. “Okay.”
“You sound happy,” said the angel. “Why? Jack got in trouble.”
Jack’s voice was so low that Sam almost missed it. He finished up his text to Eileen and sent it out before giving Jack his full attention.
The locker door dislodged and opened, showing Jack the empty space. He turned his head to see a tall, dark-haired boy, wearing a bulky jacket with the letters “JAHS” stitched on one side and “Wallace” on the other.
Aside from Jack’s quietness, Castiel was glad that everything seemed to be back to normal now. After their earlier talk, he had been frightened and worried that things would change between him and Dean. But, on the contrary, they had fallen back into old habits and routines. He had avoided telling Dean the reason why he didn’t come to see them after Jack brought him back from The Empty. And, to his relief, Dean hadn’t pushed him further.
For the first two years, Dean and Castiel continued to live at the bunker with Sam and Eileen, helping the couple with finding, researching, and solving cases.
So, he cleared his throat and clapped his hand. “Let’s do something fun today! Sammy, check the weather. If it’s sunny out, there’s no use staying in.”
He can feel the familiar sting of tears but refuses to let them fall. “Will you hear my prayers?”
Without wasting any more time, Dean slipped into comfy slippers and made his way down the stairs to the kitchen.
Jack now turned to the older Winchester, definitely interested. “What about you, Dean?”
“I’ll see you later.”
The drive was mostly silent. The radio wasn’t even on. Dean was too antsy to turn it on, his brain primly stuck on the fact that they were being called into Jack’s school and it was only the second week. Jack wasn’t a troublemaker so he must have gotten hurt or… something. Did all it took to bring down a new God was by sending him to high school?!
His eyes were beginning to sting so he looked to Sam with a silent plea for help.
Well, Sam didn’t really expect to bring this up tonight, too. He hadn’t even told Eileen, yet. In fact, he hadn’t told anyone. It was a recent development.
“Yes, yes, of course!”
“Hello, Dean. I apologize for not answering when you called.”
Dean swallowed.
“Do what?”
“He was brought back along with everyone else on Earth. But, with Michael in the Empty at the time, there was no use for him as a vessel anymore. Last we checked, he had settled in his hometown in Minnesota. Built a new life for himself.”
Jack smiled in gratitude. “I’ll see you after school, then.”
Jack was seated on the sofa between Dean and Sam, a bowl of popcorn on his lap, and his eyes glued to the television. Beside him, Dean was talking, pointing things out about the movie, which Castiel could see involved a man in a red robot suit. Meanwhile, Sam was trying to hush his brother, seemingly irritated but his gaze displayed fondness. At Dean’s feet, Miracle was dozing.
Just then, Casey came bounding up to them. “You bitches ready for the weekend?!”
“Who’s that?” Sam walked up to him, carrying plastic bags.
“What did they say?” Jack asked, apprehensively yet also buzzing with unmistakable excitement.
It smelt amazing! Not bad for a random recipe he found online. He just hoped that it tasted just as good. Maybe next Thanksgiving, he could experiment with his own flavors.
“Dean. Come on, man. Talk to me.”
Sam shook his head, a smile creeping to his lips. “Can’t promise but we’ll try.”
He was still in that mood by the time they arrived home. Jack took Castiel’s arm and dragged the angel to his room, wanting to try on the clothes again. Dean watched them leave, his chest twinging with something he couldn’t describe. (Longing. It was longing.)
Dean took the bar and made for the driver’s seat. He could feel Sam’s stare burning at the side of his head but he ignored him, getting the car in gear and heading off. He ripped the side of the wrapper with his teeth and took a first bite of the granola – the taste of nuts and berries invaded his tongue and he resisted the urge to moan in delight. He didn’t realize how hungry he was.
Castiel was making breakfast.
They sat on a table outside, shielded by an umbrella from the afternoon sun. Jack happily licked his ice cream, his current adolescent face making him look almost like his actual age of four years old. Sometimes, Dean wondered how their lives would have gone if Jack had been born the normal way as a baby.
Eileen’s face fell but she tried to cover it up with a small smile. Sam hated it when Eileen was upset.
Then, some shuffling and a loud groan announced Dean’s arrival in the kitchen. He was already dressed to drive Jack to school but his squinty eyes deemed his consciousness to still be in Dream World.
“Need help with that?” his brother asked while Dean moved the turkey from the pan to a large silver dish, garnished with some lemon, cucumbers, and kale.
“So, you’ve been having all these plans and just, what? Not tell me?”
“Wendigo,” Eileen answered, pausing in cutting her chicken to sign. “In Iowa. It was luring kids from a small village to the forest. Took us three days.”
The angel must have determined something in his tone as he called out to Jack and asked him to bring the food to the kitchen and get Sam so they could eat. Obediently, Jack took the food and headed off. Miracle was at his heels, immediately.
“Yeah, I’ll take care of it. We’ll be right there. Thank you.”
Castiel held a hand out and the dog padded over to sniff at it before licking his palm. The angel smiled, grateful for the gift of trust from the animal and offered him some gentle pets.
“See you later, Cas.”
Castiel’s eyes widened in shock before his gaze turned soft and smiled at the baby. He looked touched at the revelation. Meanwhile, baby Castiel decided to explore the face of his brand new friend, little hands patting the stubbled chin, cheeks, and nose.
The kid, already dressed in casual clothes and was seated on one of the beds as he waited for them to finish getting ready, nodded with surety.
“Shut up, Sammy!”
“That’s if the archangels and his mother agree, Dean.” Castiel sighed. “I should go.”
Just as Castiel was about to take his first steps to the door, the rumbling of an approaching vehicle reached his ears. He turned around.
It was nice here. Picturesque. Peaceful. It looked so real.
The kid startled, looking guilty at being caught. “Um… I was hungry.”
Sam felt a spike of irritation. He just bought that case two days ago. At this rate, his brother’s water weight would be 90% beer and 10% water. He knew that the last year hadn’t been easy for Dean but it wasn’t easy for Sam, either. But, you don’t see him drowning his sorrows in cheap alcohol.
And, suddenly, he can
Oh, he had room to joke while Dean was freaking out? Unbelievable!
“What are you now? Hedwig?” Dean snapped from his place.
“Well, what’s stopping you?”
It was less plain and dreary than it was before Jack took on the mantle of God. There were paintings on the walls now and the occasional pops of color. There were even full walls of just glass windows that gave the angels a breathtaking view of the vast meadows, forests, mountains, and beaches that made up the new Heaven. Through the windows, they could even glimpse the souls wandering about, happy and content to exist as if they were still alive.
Sam’s resting bitch face had magnified tenfold as he shook his head in disapproval at Dean.
And as they mixed ingredients and molded the patties, Dean couldn’t help but feel content. He hadn’t felt this relaxed all year.
“But, don’t come up too soon. I mean it, Dean.”
Sam’s head jerked towards him in surprise. “Really?”
“Oh.”
Surely, Castiel and Jack couldn’t have left them, right? He just spoke to Castiel last night, letting him know that they would be home today!
“If ya retire, no one’s gonna hold it against ya.”
Dean’s lips thinned. “But, you’re old.”
Then, he thought about the “Missing” post.
Dean’s heart skips a beat.
“Yeah.”
Dean’s phone rang. Castiel’s name flashed on the screen and quick as lighting, he answered it.
“So, are you going to college, too? I never got to go.” She looked wistful at that.
“If I had just stuck to being born normally, then maybe everyone will remember that I’m just a child! That I’m four years old! Then maybe no one will expect me to just take on such a huge responsibility! Without even asking me if I wanted to do it! And maybe... Maybe Dean wouldn’t have hated me so much for causing your death and for Mary being trapped in that other world! And maybe... Maybe you would have tried harder to actually act like my father and not just
Jack was quiet in the car (they took the Thunderbird) on the way to the grocery store. Sam couldn’t help but flash him worried looks every now and then. In the back, Miracle laid down on the seat, calm and behaved.
And, then, Eileen mentioned some hunter friends of hers getting married in Las Vegas for a case. It got this little thought lingering in the back of Sam’s mind pushing its way forward.
It made Dean chuckle, though. “Yeah, Cas, I’m totally dancing with her right this second. What do you think, you weirdo?”
“Yes, this is he.”
“As you know, we have a non-violence policy in this school-.”
He flinched at the skepticism in Adam’s voice. Not that Dean could blame him.
Finding Jack with the Winchesters. Jack’s refusal to return to Heaven. His apology to his mother. His grievances for being picked as the new God. And his desire to stay on Earth and go to school.
Their dog, Miracle, raised her head from her own breakfast to bounce up to him with a happy bark. He ran a hand through her fur, fondly scratching her favorite spots. Her tail wagged even faster in delight. She was getting on in years but was still the same beautiful and affectionate dog she was when Dean first found her.
“I’m afraid.”
“But, they’re not as red.”
Fortunately, the woman didn’t hear him, too busy talking to Castiel about flowers and hives and beekeeping. It made the edge of Dean’s lips twitch, threatening to break into a smile. He rarely got to see Castiel looking excited and his guard completely down. He was like a kid at a candy shop.
“Then what?! Dean, you can talk to me! I’m your brother! You can trust me!”
Sam and Dean looked at each other, neither feeling happy about the news they’re about to break.
Dean took his hand and squeezed it. “I’m fine, Cas,” he replied with a grin. “How’s the food?”
Meanwhile, Sam was absent. He had gone on a hunt with Eileen so that left Dean and Castiel to chaperone. Jack had asked them to, practically begged. Apparently, a couple of parents bailed at the last minute and they needed new volunteers to replace them. So Jack volunteered them.
“He got in trouble for helping out another kid. I’m proud as hell.”
But, Castiel still wouldn’t talk.
But, an angel in love with someone like him? It sounded like the plot of a badly written T.V. show.
“Oh… I thought it was just a suggestion.” Jack scuffed his sneakers against the floor, like a berated child. “I don’t really want to go out right now.”
Castiel’s lip twitched as he stared at Dean.
“Oh.” Dean shifted. “You know this is a love song, right?”
Visibly swallowing, Jack nodded. “I don’t want to go back to Heaven,” he repeated.
Castiel placed a tentative hand over his and, to Dean’s surprise, he didn’t mind the touch. Castiel was a warm furnace against his freezing cold skin.
Jack nodded. “Okay, Sam.” To the dog, he said, “Come on, boy. Maybe there are some cats over there for you to chase… I apologize, I wasn’t aware that that’s a harmful stereotype. Of course, if you’re friends with the cat, I don’t expect you to chase them.”
The angel looked down at the table, avoiding Dean’s gaze again. “I’m sorry, Dean. I… Jack had given a select group of angels the task to receive prayers and fulfill them if needed. I can no longer hear prayers… not even yours.”
Tears flowed down Mrs. Kline’s cheeks as she listened. Mr. Kline looked more reserved but his tight hold of his wife’s hand was enough to show his own despair of the situation.
There were a lot of revelations tonight. And Sam thought he had the biggest news.
“I don’t know. I only have a year.”
Castiel continues to smile but there’s now a hint of sadness to it. “Live. Please. No matter how tempting it may be to die, just live. I want you to live.”
The kids showering affection on Miracle all paused as a woman’s voice called out to them. They said their goodbyes to the dog, thanked Jack for the permission to pet his dog, and then ran off.
Figuring it couldn’t hurt, they let him go, telling him that they would wait for him by the front doors. Then, he and Castiel watched as Jack bounded off with his friends, talking a mile a minute.
Dean chuckled. “Yeah, he can.”
“Jack, are you okay? What did they say? You’re not in trouble, are you?” the girl asked, practically bouncing on her toes.
“As will I.”
“The children were dancing.”
His hand itched to grab the whiskey bottle and pour himself another glass but he couldn’t, he wanted to at least be partially sober to hear the rest of this.
Castiel chuckled. “He looks like he needs help.”
Dean was clearly in distress mode now. He had jumped up from the bed and started pacing.
Finally, Sam looked up, meeting his eyes. There was apprehension there, some fear, and a little hope.
The younger Winchester stayed in the bar for another half hour, ordering himself a few things from the appetizer menu before paying the tab. Dean had taken the keys to the Impala so Sam had to walk back to the motel. Fortunately, the drizzle had died down so he was fairly dry as he navigated the dark streets. He didn't mind it too much.
They continued to watch the movie in silence and no more questions from Castiel. That was, until they got to the scene of Vice Principal Vernon’s verbal spat with Bender in the janitor's closet.
Dean muttered something incoherent before bringing the mug to his lips. It had the desired effect as the hunter’s roughened face softened and he let out a sigh. Then, he flashed one of the most affectionate smiles Jack had ever seen at Castiel.
Dean flicked the last of the water away before wiping his hands on a rag. “Okay. I’ll walk Miracle while you’re out.”
Dean felt a stab of guilt at the gentle reprimand.
While Charlie bounded off into the bunker, Dean returned to the kitchen where he left some half-peeled potatoes lying on the counter. He had gotten Jody’s mashed potatoes recipe and hoped that he could make it just as well as she could.
“I know that the way I feel about Sam is the same way I feel about Eileen and Bobby and Jody and Donna. The way I feel about Jack is the same way I feel about Claire. But, the way I feel for you… it’s different. It’s… warmer… More powerful. More heartbreaking…”
After the delicious Thanksgiving dinner (Castiel assumed since most of the food was practically devoured) and dessert consisting of two kinds of pie (apple and pumpkin), almost everyone retreated to the Dean Cave (he finally got used to calling it that) to watch a movie.
“I can’t decide between the white and red,” the kid announced as he exited the fitting room, dressed in his own clothes. In his arms were the black blazer, the plain black tie, the black jeans, and the two shirts.
How could he tell Dean that he didn’t come to see him because he was embarrassed and afraid of how Dean would react to his return, considering Castiel had confessed his feelings with the belief that they would never see each other again. He was afraid that their friendship would change, that Dean would want nothing to do with him anymore.
“Cas?”
For one, he no longer had to go on a long drive and break speeding laws in order to get to a gate in a children’s playground. There were only so many times he could keep appearing there without piquing the concerns of parents.
Jack told her everything that happened since then – her brother’s betrayal and lies, the erasure of humanity, and the Winchesters risking it all to save the world one last time. And when he told her that he now had Chuck's powers, she had been surprised yet pleased. She told him that even though she loved her brother, it was finally time for him to get knocked off his pedestal.
“My son is just a kid,” Kelly intervened this time. “He wasn’t supposed to be born older than his actual age. I know he did it for me. But, at the end of the day, he’s only four years old, Raphael. He should be discovering the world for the first time, taking it in and learning about it, not ruling it. I wasn’t opposed, at first, because he insisted that he was needed to do this. He wanted to do this. But, now, he’s not happy anymore. I’m his mother and I want him to be happy.”
“Yes, Cas. I promise. I’m sorry.”
“You two go on ahead!” Dean called to Jack and Sam. “Cas wants to look at the honey.”
“Hello, Dean. There was a sale on pie so I got you two.” He gestured to the kitchen table where two boxes sat.
Castiel could pinpoint the exact moment the thread snapped and the carefully stitched Jack unraveled right in front of his very eyes. It was on the word “responsibility.”
He didn’t dream, not really. He didn’t even need sleep anymore but he liked doing it. He remembered the early days of his birth, how much he liked lazing around in bed in the morning and how comfortable and warm it always made him feel. He had thought back then that that must have been what the warmth of a mother's hug would feel like. And, just like back then, he missed her now.
He had looked so distraught that Dean ended up giving in and leaving the tree alone.)
The archangels and Kelly listened with rapt attention and Castiel secretly observed their faces for any sort of negative reaction. It was subtle but it was there.
But, when the figure showed itself in full, Sam felt his mouth fall open in shock.
The third day, too, was the same.
Dean got to his feet and stretched. “Get them both,” he said, casually taking out his wallet and tossing one of his credit cards at him (he caught it, good kid!).
“Dean, please, I’d prefer to talk to all three of you.”
Jack looked more or less the same as they saw him last, a year ago. Same tousled dark blonde hair, same white jacket and light blue jeans that Sam remembered getting for him at Walmart, and the same shy, innocent smile that reminded everyone about how young he actually was despite his physical appearance.
Sometimes, Dean watched the scene from the outside looking in, watching his dream self break down on the dungeon floor. Other times, he was in that moment, tongue-tied and unable to do anything or stop the inevitable.
Dean’s head snapped to Jody, who was grinning at him as she mashed. Beside her, Charlie had a hand over her mouth, trying not to laugh.
“Just… Why me, man?” was what he ended up saying, looking away again. “I’m so fucked up.”
They paused at the gate. The sun shone brightly down on them as it always did. It was never nighttime in Heaven.
“Yeah, I guess. I mean, I went to a couple back in the day. Didn’t really do much, ya know, since we moved around a lot. It was a way to pass the time. And make out with dateless girls.”
An hour later, the bunker doors squeaked open.
“Right, right. Well, I’m Dean. This is Cas.”
With a fake ID in hand, Dean helped him get a library card under the name “Castiel Kline”, the same name he used when they enrolled Jack. Less confusion that way. And his first library book haul, as Sam had called it, was made up of all of J.R.R. Tolkien’s works. Dean wanted to show him the movies but Castiel wanted to read the books first so he could make comparisons.
Castiel shook his head as he sat down on Jack’s empty place next to Dean. “I’m alright, thank you. I will wait until everyone finishes.”
“So… what about you? What’s your new job?”
Miracle barked, looking up at him with excited puppy dog eyes. She was anxious to get out and walk and chase squirrels and get the occasional pets from excited kids.
Even if he knew that Castiel couldn’t technically taste anything, Dean still appreciated the angel’s compliments. It made him all warm and tingly inside.
With an anxious heart but doing his best not to show it, Castiel relayed everything that happened since he left.
“Alright. Come out when you’re ready.”
For a moment, they were silent, simply listening to the night sounds and enjoying the warmth in their stomachs brought by the beer.
Even though Jack was in control of his powers now, that piercing gaze alone could still smite Castiel where he stood.
“It was alright,” Zayn answered as he opened his own locker and getting his things together. “Wish I didn’t have practice today, I just wanna go home and chill. You got plans?”
“Well, technically, you said ‘kinda wanna kiss you’, which is grammatically-.”
A girl with curly brown hair and wearing a simple pink dress. She was leaning against the wall, watching the crowd of her peers with a bored expression. She didn’t even notice the boy just on the other end of the wall, gazing at her.
Dean’s eye twitched. “What?” he seethed.
“I can take yours,” Jack said to Casey who was frantically packing her things, itching to get out.
Sam rolled his eyes as he sat down at the table. “I’m fine, Dean.”
The principal was still looking at Castiel weirdly but, nonetheless, nodded. “Yes, just sign him out at the front desk with Miss Picoult. Mr. Kline, Mr. Campbell, please ensure that this doesn’t happen again with Jack.”
Castiel had learned to control his thoughts around Dean over the years but ever since his confession, it was getting harder and harder. He hoped Dean wouldn’t be offended.
“Can I have some?”
So, he looks away again, focusing his gaze on the foot of his bed.
He opened his palms at them. “What do you think?” he asked.
“Dean? Are you okay?” Castiel placed a hand over his knee under the table, flashing him a worried look. “Do you not like the food? But, that’s impossible, you cooked it.”
The baby looked thrilled at being addressed and squealed, wrapping his short little toddler hands as much as they could around the angel’s neck and burying his face into the turtleneck sweater Castiel was wearing.
Eileen nodded, looking amused.
“Did you even hear my prayers?” Dean’s voice cracked but he couldn’t find it in himself to care, too lost in the memories of the past year.
He arrived in the long empty corridors of the office-like structure that served as Heaven’s headquarters.
Jack’s nougat. Dean’s Lucky Charms. Meat. Some fruits and vegetables. Dog food for Miracle. Sam was almost out of organic yogurt so he grabbed a tub of it. There was a sale on pasta, too, so he grabbed a couple of boxes.
Castiel settles on the empty chair, pulling it closer to Dean’s bed.
He didn’t want Jack and Castiel to go somewhere else. He wanted them right here where he could see them. He had lost them too many times to let them go now.
Oh yeah, because he was a repressed piece of work in more ways than one. Thanks a lot, Dad.
“I do.”
“Oh,” was all he could manage.
Castiel frowned. Was that a compliment?
“I’m sorry.”
Castiel was confused. “School?”
The hunter sighed in relief. “Okay. Okay, good.”
“What about Dad? Is he… up there?”
“Dean, please, I’m not an idiot.” Sam fixed a glare on his brother who looked away from him. “The last year wasn’t easy for you. We almost lost everyone again. We lost Cas and Jack was gone. You weren’t coping, Dean. And whenever I tried to talk to you, you would deflect or change the subject. You were always drinking. You almost died at that barn, remember?”
Now, Jack was no stranger to the looks Dean and Castiel often sent each other, the silent conversations they had with their eyes, and the strange electricity he could feel in the air when the two were in the same room. Those were normal. But, after that talk, it seemed like everything was amplified all of a sudden.
“Yeah?”
Dean shrugged. “You guys were kinda loud so…”
“But, I was never as attached to Elizabeth as I was with Jimmy. I released her as soon as my mission was done and returned to heaven. After Jimmy died…”
“Eileen and I… we’re getting pretty serious.”
“Jack, would you like to tell your Uncle what happened today?” she said, firmly.
“And another thing,” the kid continued. “I think I need new clothes. For the Dance.”
Dean hummed. “I guess, yeah.”
He repeated his words in signs to her. “He was gone for only two hours. I know Dean isn’t the type to stay for breakfast but even that was too fast for him.”
On the other line, someone took a sharp intake of breath but didn’t say a word.
Of course, Jack did. He’s a good kid. Better than all of them.
“Dean? Are you okay?” Kaia’s voice broke through his thoughts.
Not much in terms of romance in this chapter but it's definitely a lot of emotions.
Dean’s glare intensified. “Peachy,” he spat.
His breakfast prepared, Sam made his way to the table with his bowl and cup of coffee and sat down beside Jack.
Sensible shoes. Pressed black slacks. A crisp white button-down. Professional blue tie. Matching black suit jacket. Ugly beige trench coat. Tousled black hair. Brilliant blue eyes. All topped by an uncertain look.
“The one you’re holding is Castiel,” Garth replied, grinning.
Dean was never the best with words, often leaving sentences unfinished. But, after thirteen years, Castiel knew him enough to know how those sentences often ended. Okay, maybe not always, especially if they were pop culture references that he was unfamiliar with. But, he found that he was often close enough.
Dinner was a loud affair. Everyone talked and had something to say. Jack couldn’t stop talking about the schools Sam had researched for him and the latter would chime in with some additional info or fun fact. Dean, once in a while would interrupt with a teasing comment about them being nerds. This went on for a while until Sam decided to remind him of Robotics Club again.
“In the library, you were.”
“Well, the movie just ended. We can pick up dinner and head home.”
“It felt like cheating on you.”
This confused the principal. “Excuse me?”
“Well, we know Sam has questionable tastes.”
Jack came back right then, wearing a jacket and a golden-haired dog followed at his heels.
Castiel tilted his head to the side, confused by the request but agreeing to it, anyway.
Soon, he fell into a dreamless sleep and worried no more.
For what was probably the first time all day, Jack smiled. “I’m fine, Casey. They’re sending me home for the day and I have detention for the rest of the week.”
So, he simply grabbed his phone and his lunchbox. He detoured to the kitchen, first, to drop it off, and thankfully, it was empty. He threw out the rest of the water in his water bottle (it was fountain water, anyway. It tasted kind of disgusting if you asked him so he was considering doing a little miracle work to make the water taste better for his peers) before rinsing it out.
Jack was about to thank him again when a third voice joined them.
The Men of Letters had a vast collection of books on almost every subject – math, science, history, philosophy, mythology, religion, the supernatural, etc. Anything you could think of to increase your knowledge. But, what they did lack was enjoyable fiction.
“Well, I wanted to be a doctor before... you know... but I don’t think med school is possible now. Nursing is the next best thing.”
He held out his beer bottle again.
“Are you going to call her, then?” he couldn’t help but ask.
But, it wasn’t ridiculous. It was very… sweet. And kind of romantic, if Sam said so himself.
Jack and Jody’s girls were on the floor, a game of “Apples to Apples” spread out. Little Gertie had found a spot between Alex and Claire, holding her own cards as they re-started the game to include her.
“This is nice,” she said after a while.
Kaia shook her head but, otherwise, didn’t contradict Claire. “Well, aside from that, you sound pretty happy, Jack.”
Is this his special brand of hell? Boredom? It’s pretty effective.
The pain of the wound on his back.
Castiel looked about ready to scold him but decided against it, shaking his head.
Jack stood perfectly still, used to Dean, Sam, or Castiel tying his tie for him. They should really teach him how to do it himself, at some point.
The kid sighed, loudly and defeated. Sam sympathetically patted him on the shoulder before pointing at the notebook, bringing his attention back to it.
Dean blinked. “Yeah, yeah, I’m fine.” He sat up a little straighter. “Just thinking. Um… you didn’t burn anything then?”
Now that Sam thought about it, were there even enough angels left to help Jack with things?
“No matter Jack’s intentions, we can’t let this slide, Mr. Kline,” she said. “Jack still needs to be punished. However…” This time, she appeared to soften. “Since he did try to help another student and it’s his first offense, we’re simply suspending him for the day and he will have detention for the rest of the week.”
“Um… sure.”
“Dean wasn’t sure what you’d like,” Castiel said.
Sam cleared his throat, followed by the distinct sound of chairs moving back. “So, uh, you two go over that list and Eileen and I will… uh…”
Dean pretended not to hear him.
“Cas! This is Miracle!”
“Who else that we know is back?”
Back in their room, Sam changed into his pajamas, brushed his teeth, and then settled on top of the covers to Skype with Eileen. He told her about the case and she told him about one she had finished just days before. Then, she asked him to open his e-mail because she had sent him more listings.
“Cas?”
Less dramatic than he thought but, at least, for once, he wasn’t saved by some outside power he had no control over. Just by human beings. That’s fine.
Meanwhile, Principal Chan appeared to be gritting her teeth, trying to be polite. “Mr. Prescott is currently in the nurse’s office getting his nose reset and will probably need to be taken to the hospital.”
At first, everything looks blurry. He blinks a few times until things come to focus.
“Well, that kinda sucks,” Claire finally said, sounding a little sympathetic. “You’d miss prom and graduation. Not that I went to my prom, it wasn’t my thing. But, you know, it’s the principle of the thing or whatever. I did go to my graduation though. Jody insisted. Then, we salted a ghost afterwards.”
Jack sniffed against his shoulder. “I don’t want to do this anymore, Cas.”
“Well, it matters to me!” Dean snapped. “Okay? And I am happy. I got Sam and Jack and you. I couldn’t ask for anything else. Except, maybe a million bucks so we can finally take that beach vacation.”
Jack followed his lead, not sure exactly if he was doing it right, but he made sure to have three of his new notebooks in his backpack, along with pens and paper. He was told that he would be getting textbooks in his classes so he needed to be sure he had room in the bag. He hesitated at the bottle of SPF lotion Dean had placed in there but decided to just leave it in the bag. Lastly, he took out the bottle of water from his lunchbox and put it in his backpack then hung his lunchbox on the little hook on the side.
He was in the war room, looking up the history of a town in Wisconsin for a hunter who was doing a salt and burn of a ghost wreaking havoc in an old convent. They’ve been doing that more lately – providing information and posing as government heads for hunters all over the country. (Sam was thinking about setting up a network, but he was still working on the details.)
“So… God approves of… this?”
“I heard you... Dean.” The angel finally makes eye contact. “You called for me and I heard you.”
“Wait, hold up. The archangels? They’re back?” Sam asked, eyes wide. “All of them?”
By the time they were done planning and delegating, Castiel had a long scroll of paper tucked into the pocket of his trenchcoat. It was to be given to Jack when Castiel returned to his side.
“I never expected you to. You’re your own person, Charlie. I think she’d have liked you.”
Dean hid a slight wince. “I was just hangry.”
“But, Jack, we can’t tell them the exact circumstance of how your mother died,” said Castiel, gently.
“I mean,” Sam finally spoke up. “I guess I wouldn’t mind it if Jack saw me as his dad, too, but I don’t think it’s a big deal.” He looked at Dean then smirked. “Do you want to be his dad too because you like his dad?”
“We’re not in a chick flick, Sammy.”
But, maybe… just maybe…
“Besides, I don’t really have the time to date right now.”
Sam was waiting for him there. His brother looked strangely nervous, shuffling on his feet and wringing his hands. He seemed to be doing that around Dean, lately.
“Goddamnit, Cas! Why won’t you just give me a straight answer?!”
“Since Eileen is pregnant, we’re probably gonna take a break from hunting.”
Dean’s mind took him back to that moment. Those last five minutes when the Empty’s black goo covered Castiel and took him away, effectively saving Dean from Billie but losing his life in the process. The moment that prompted that black goo to appear in the first place.
His hand reached out to tap the ‘snooze’ button, silencing the buzzing for at least another ten minutes.
With the exception of Sam, the rest of them picked up the remaining food as well as the tray of cheap plastic wine glasses they bought at Walmart the other day.
Honestly, it was better than Castiel expected. He thought he would have to fight tooth and wing for Jacks’ desires to stay on Earth and go to school.
Dean pointed to their bowls. “Eating breakfast. Want some?”
“Was the drive okay?” he asked.
“Not all the time,” teased Castiel, turning around in Dean’s arms to look at him. “But, you’re welcome.”
The teacher was gone and Dean was alone again.
“What’s with all the questions?”
Soon enough, the distinct sound of footsteps announced the arrival of Dean and Jack.
Castiel’s lips twitched into a smile. “It’s a hot day,” he stated with a nod. “Ice cream sounds nice.”
He can’t see him but he can imagine his brother rolling his eyes.
“Then what is?”
Jack beamed before turning back to his ice cream, happily nibbling on the cone.
As he closed in on the gates, he sent out a message on Angel Radio to the archangels, calling for an emergency meeting along with Kelly. If she was involved, they would know it was about Jack.
“Jack…”
“Goodbye for now, Dean.”
So, instead, he forced his longings away and focused on the task at hand.
“Look, I appreciate the concern, Sammy, but I don’t need a relationship. I get it, you and Eileen are happy and that’s great! In fact, go ahead and marry her and have thirty kids. I’m fine.”
“We’ll be fine, don’t worry, Dean.”
“I do,” Sam answered, quickly, fully aware of the warmth blooming in his chest. “I’d like to. And… maybe… a family?” He hesitated, suddenly apprehensive. “Kids?”
“If you’re worried about what Jack would think, I’m sure he’ll be fine with it.”
Maybe it was all the close calls with death. Living to see another sunrise is a blessing to every hunter, but apparently, for a Winchester, it was practically a miracle.
It made Dean chuckle and nudge his shoulder. “Trust me, Cas, nothing in the world can prepare you for teenagers, hormones, and possibly spiked punch.”
Why didn’t he tell them he was alive?
“Are you happy?”
“Damn right it’s not!”
As Dean moved closer, he could hear their conversation.
“You sure about this, kid? Last call,” asked Dean, turning around in his seat to look at Jack.
“We need to commemorate this! Smile, Jack!”
“Um… so… I’ve been trying to tell you for some time now.”
His brother’s sleeping form twitched, followed by a soft pained groan.
Kaia looked behind him and nodded in understanding.
He wanted it all. So much.
Jack felt his eyes stinging but he held back the tears threatening to show themselves. He rarely let himself cry these days. After all, God was supposed to be a strong powerful being, right? He didn’t cry, right?
The next couple of hours were a bit of a blur as Dean got into the zone of cooking.
Dean helped himself to some cereal and Castiel took his place across from them. They ate breakfast in silence, Jack and Dean munching on cookie pieces and Castiel sipping his coffee. Jack subtly watched the hunter and angel from the corner of his eye. Aside from the brief flirtation, they were acting fairly normal for the most part.
Their conversation turned to lighter topics. Well, as light as talking about vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and wendigoes could be. But, it was nice. Talking to Charlie about everyday hunter things like they were discussing the weather. Dean, somehow, found himself talking about Jack, how he was doing in school, his friends, and his after-school activities (baseball, Drama Club, and, yes, Robotics – the kid was all over the place).
“Well, there’s Balthazar… Hannah… Samandriel… Rachel… Anna… Hael… Gadreel… And many others that we knew Jack could trust.”
Again, Dean didn’t answer for a long time. He refused to look at Sam but his jaw was tight and his grip on his mattress practically made his knuckles white.
changed.
ask Cas.”
“Well, I assumed you and Sam were waiting until Jack was more adjusted.”
“No, not you, Cas. I meant Sam.” He glared at his brother.
His brother continued to frown, looking annoyed and, for lack of a better word, really pissed off.
“I suppose I should be glad you’re not attempting to make your own cheese.”
“You sure?” Dean asked. “I could stay.”
So, Castiel had to laugh at his own silliness too. “Right. Apologies. So, why did you decline? She was a lovely woman.”
“Cut! Angie, the line is
The innocent curiosity when something confused him. The strong determination when he was in battle. The love, affection, and protectiveness when it came to Dean, Sam, Jack, Claire, and all those he cared about. Castiel would go far and beyond to help, even at the cost of his own life – Dean both admired and hated that.
“You’re not still mad at him, are you?”
“Good,” he answered, as Dean turned the car on and pulled out of the curb.
(Castiel wasn’t with them on this trip, it was time for his monthly report to Heaven. Miracle had been left behind at a Doggy Day Care.)
“I know, Jack, I know.” Castiel rubbed his back, hoping he was giving Jack the type of comfort he needed. He pulled back, gently, so he could look at him. “Why didn’t you tell me you were feeling this way?”
Dean didn’t say anything so Sam continued.
Dean kept his ear out for the two cosmic beings, not wanting them to hear this very chick flick conversation.
His mouth tugged up to a grin. “Kaia!” he called out, running towards her.
Rubbing his eyes, Dean pushed the sheets away from his body. He slipped his feet into slippers, grabbed his robe from the foot of his bed, and ambled out of his room in search of alcohol. He made it close to the kitchen doors when he realized that the lights were on inside and crunching sounds echoed from within.
“Brother, everything will be alright,” Michael reassured him. “We’ve run Heaven by ourselves before. We can do it again. And, this time, we have help.”
The angel shrugged. “I don’t know when it began. I’ve always found your soul beautiful. From the moment I found you in Hell, its brightness never failed to amaze me. But, one day, somewhere down the line, I looked at you and the first thought that appeared in my mind was that I loved you.”
“Hi, Sam!” Eileen waved back.
He could do without Math, though. He knew it was important but the numbers combined with letters often confused him.
As promised, Castiel took care of the leftover pizza, wrapping them in foil and putting them in the refrigerator. Then, he turned out all the lights in the empty rooms before heading to his own. He picked up “The Fellowship of the Ring” from where it sat on his bedside table and proceeded to spend the next several hours reading.
Dean hummed. “Not difficult since you guys left the door open and were practically shouting.”
“What? It’s a legitimate question!”
“Then why didn’t he tell me that he was alive?”
Eileen blew him a kiss and waved before hanging up.
“That’s good to know.” She pursed her lips. “But, try not to change the subject. You know I’ll keep asking.”
“Aren’t you going to bed?” Dean asked as he approached.
Casey, oblivious to the tension, waved to both girls. “Nice to meet you! Wow, Jack, didn’t know you had college friends. You’re officially the coolest kid I know. And not just ‘cause you’re about to join the ranks of jocks.”
“It reminds me of us,” said Castiel.
“Okay!” Jack piped and Castiel nodded.
“Not yet,” Jack replied. “I can tell him about it when he gets back.”
The hunter stood there, dumbstruck, wondering what the hell just happened. He would have stood there for hours like that if Sam hadn't come in, a box in one hand and a suitcase in the other.
“Didn’t Sam send you out with Miracle?”
Between them, the kid nodded. “I promise it won’t, Principal Chan. I’m sorry.”
Sam hummed. “Okay, Dean.”
“Eileen and I agreed to wait until Jack and Cas leave. And, well, you’ll have time to think about yourself, too.”
Dean felt like he was in trouble. Meanwhile, Castiel appeared nonplussed, simply thanking the first woman and entering the Principal’s Office. Dean had to resist the sudden urge to reach out and cling to the hem of his trench coat.
“Not very clearly,” Jack admitted. “But, you were loud. Really loud.”
Unable to help himself, Sam pulled her back in for another hug. Once more, he thanked whatever being was listening that Eileen came into his life. There were days when they both wondered how things would have gone if Chuck hadn’t intervened in their reunion.
He and Jody successfully made the mashed potatoes while Charlie assisted them in whatever they needed. Castiel popped in every now and then to drop off bottles and grab more drinks. Sam, at some point, wandered in to try and steal a few bites of whatever food they had out but Dean managed to wrangle him in to help with the turkey. By then, Dean had finally managed to kick Jody out of his kitchen while Charlie had decided her help was no longer needed and had gone back out to the War Room with everyone (apparently, the girls had brought board games and were playing with Jack).
He found himself unable to look away as Castiel lifted a forkful of mashed potatoes to his lips. The angel chewed, swallowed, and beamed in satisfaction.
“What for?”
And please feel free to give me constructive feedback on anything! If you think I'm starting to go out of character or if the plot makes sense. I'm welcome to constructive criticism!
His brother looked up from his computer, surprised. Dean couldn’t blame him. He hadn’t taken a case in months. Not since Jack started school.
He felt a hand ghost over his.
Seated on one of the three chairs on one side of a glass desk, across from an official-looking woman, was Jack. His head was bowed and his fingers interlocked on his lap. His backpack sat on the floor by his feet.
“Cas-.”
“Shall we go inside?”
Slowing down to a walk, Sam kept his gaze on the rising sun over the horizon and began to pray. He didn’t know if anyone up there was still listening but it didn’t hurt to try.
“So why didn’t you tell me you were alive?!”
Dean smiled, shaking his head before sitting up and stretching. He could feel his muscles popping, his back twinging in that familiar ache.
Sam and Eileen retreated immediately to the library to research a case for some hunters who called them the day before.
“You wouldn’t mention me if it’s nothing, Dean. We’re trying to be more honest with each other, remember?”
Dean took Miracle out on a walk.
“That will be difficult to find later,” he stated, confused.
“So…”
Sam chuckled. “Jerk.”
“Hope to see you soon,” she said to him, batting her lashes again.
“Besides,” added Eileen. “We like you the way you are. Other kids will, too, I’m sure.”
Castiel steps closer, his eyes focusing on Dean’s face. Dean, too, memorizes the angel's face. Takes a picture of it and saves it in his memory.
“I just… want to be normal.”
Sam laughed, shaking his head. “Come on. Have breakfast with us. You can tell us what’s been up with you in the past year.”
He was reluctant to leave Dean alone. But, then again, Dean wasn’t alone. Jack was there. And maybe Castiel would be back soon. Right? And it had been a while. And he missed Eileen so much.
He pushed the bowl of cereal to the side. “Hey… I’m sorry.”
Dean’s voice broke at the end of his explanation. It seemed that the incident had left a lasting impression and not a very good one. Sam kind of felt bad now for pushing.
“Hey, we’ve all done some shitty things in this family. We’ve backstabbed each other more times than we can count. Sometimes, literally! Did you know I stabbed Cas the first time we met?”
“I like this song,” he commented to Dean.
“Right, uh, let’s go get the food.”
Eyes wide and his heart picking up pace, Jack shakingly took the phone from her.
Dean’s brother never truly left the hunting life. Sam was good at it and loved it more than Dean ever did. Besides, he had Eileen as a partner, this time, in more ways than one. They worked together like a well-oiled machine, Dean was loathed to admit. But, Sam was happy and Eileen took good care of him and always had his back – that was enough for the older Winchester.
Castiel chuckled and kissed his cheek before pulling away. “Come inside, Dean.”
“Not any time soon, got it.” He squeezes Castiel’s hand. “I promise.”
“What’s wrong?” Jack asked, concerned.
“And I’m sorry for that stupid, stupid plan of you taking Chuck’s powers.”
But, when he looked over at him, the angel seemed to be in better spirits as he chopped the tomatoes, chattering about how it came to be and its evolution over the years. (Apparently, it was called Nighshade in pre-historic days? Weird.)
“I… I don’t know. But, I just want… something… We don’t have to label it or anything. I just… want… something.”
He lifted his head and managed a smile at them. It was devoid of joy.
Castiel tilted his head to the side in that way of his, fond smile gracing his lips. “How do you know what you do and don’t deserve?”
Castiel silently took over the bagging so Dean scooted over to stand in front of the card reader and took his wallet out.
“Pshh, he deserved it,” said the girl, Casey. “Asshole’s been picking on me since middle school. He got it coming!”
“Hello.”
He looked smaller. Like a child.
But, Jack didn’t laugh. His smile disappeared and was replaced by a guilty grimace. “Zayn, I didn’t mean to.”
“Look, Cas isn’t… he doesn’t have the best role model with dads, okay? And, frankly, neither do I. But, we’re doing our best.” He pinned her with a serious gaze. “
Jack was looking out the window as they approached. The boy looked tired and his cheeks stained with tears. His gaze passed them and focused on the house. A flash of longing that was quickly replaced by resignation.
Sam pressed his lips together, thinking. “So… does that mean you don’t feel the same way for Cas?”
Castiel’s eyes widened in surprise. “Dean, I…” The angel was clearly at a loss for words.
The rest of the driver was silent aside from the song playing on the radio – some new song by Taylor Swift about cowboys. Sam kind of wished Dean was in the car so he could tease him about being a secret fan. Maybe that would cut some of the tension hanging above them.
So, they had the whole team back. Cool, cool. So, now, the question was, were they going to bother him and Sam again?
At that, Castiel chuckled. “I did miss your burgers,” he admitted, shyly.
Dean’s voice interrupted Castiel’s musings, making him look up from his half-eaten burger.
Zayn shut his locker door and flashed Jack a strange smile, his eyebrows wiggling. “You know… she has a little sister who’s a freshie and-.”
Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough food left to send home with everyone but at least Jack would have a filling lunch next week, if he didn’t mind turkey sandwiches for a couple of days straight.
Dean was looking at him with a soft and fond expression. “I just wanna say… I’m proud of you, kid. You’re doing great in school, you’re making friends, and you’re figuring yourself out. And, I know your first couple of years, you may have felt like you can’t be anything other than what we tell you to be. You’re a Nephilim and then, suddenly, you’re God. But, things are different now. You can be anything you want to be, got that? That’s what Free Will is about. You can be… selfish, if you want. Choose yourself and all that.”
“Cas,” he squeaked, looking down at his feet again. “I’m sorry.”
And Castiel paced.
“Hey, Dean-o! Charlie, good to see you!”
Since there were so many of them, dinner was held in the War Room. They chatted over slices. Claire snuck Jack a sip of her beer and Dean pretended not to notice. (He figured, let the kid have fun tonight, they rarely had company over.) Then, Castiel brought out the pies, brownies, and more beer. So, suffice to say, dinner went a little longer than usual.
Dean knew that she would. “We’re figuring things out,” he admitted. “He… likes me. And I… I need him.”
Was that all Dean could say? Castiel had bared his heart to him yet he couldn’t even offer words of comfort.
“You’re all forgetting that before I got pregnant with Jack, I was the secretary to the President of the United States and, no, I did not get there by sleeping my way to the top.” She paused and her eyes dared them to contradict her. “And before that, I was a congressional aide. I was also the P.A. of a senator. Trust me, I know my way around politics.”
But, Dean wasn’t just alright. He was fantastic! His kid had friends!
Almost at once, he could see the shock and anxiety flash in Dean’s face. The man’s hands tightened around the steering wheel as he cleared his throat.
“You can’t hide here forever.”
He can be at peace now.
“We missed so much,” he stated, lovingly stroking the image. “She should have been here with us. She should have been home. She should have raised our grandson here, with us.”
“You don’t understand! Hell, even I don’t understand! Something’s going on with me, lately, Cas and it’s driving me nuts. But, there’s one thing that I know I want. And that’s…” Dean swallowed. “That’s you.”
“Just thinking,” Dean repeated his answer. “Just… did you ever think we’d be this happy, Sam?”
“Dean, you don’t need to-.”
Dean watched with a smile as Jack abandoned the hand turkeys he was sticking along the edge of the map table (which was now covered with an orange table cloth) to greet their guests. Charlie and Stevie wrapped the boy in hugs, commenting on his teen look, before turning their attention to the rest of them. Eileen had been helping Jack decorate and was the closest so she got the next hugs first.
Castiel cleared his throat. “Jack, who are your friends?”
If angels could get migraines, he was sure he’d be having one now. Instead, he was simply feeling a mere annoying and inconvenient throbbing in his temple. He had a strange urge to grab one of Dean’s fancy crystal glasses and a bottle of whiskey.
“Right… but… high school… you liked it?”
“And where the hell is the other kid?” Dean interrupted, steeling his gaze at the principal. “He was bullying another student and Jack tried to help but he’s the one in trouble?”
Then, Dean plopped onto the other bed with a loud sigh.
The school bell was almost deafening, especially for those of them who liked to sit in the back of the classroom. If Jack were a normal human, the sound would probably pierce his hearing.
Dean almost fell off his chair. “Wait, really?”
“Jack, you are one of the most powerful celestial beings with cosmic powers beyond any human’s comprehension. You rule Heaven and have dominion over Earth. Why would you want to go to high school?”
Eileen hummed. “Where is Dean, anyway?”
Jack made an announcement at breakfast one morning.
“You two…” he began.
He tossed the phone to the side and went back to his computer. His e-mail was open and there was one from Eileen with the subject line: “For your eyes only.”
The kid finally nodded, looking defeated. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
Dean chuckled again. “Yeah, with Jack there? I doubt that.”
He could picture his mother running her hand through his hair, giving him a loving smile and telling him that she was proud of him.
By the time they all decided it was time for bed, no one could move. Nonetheless, they all managed to push themselves up from their seats to help clean up. Jack did the dishes while Claire dried. Kaia and Castiel wiped the tables. And Sam and Dean gathered the trash.
“Are you proposing?!”
Dean frowned. “This sounds serious. Is someone sick?”
“Never mind, you’re back in the family.”
Sam had been surprised that Dean even knew about the sports equipment tucked away in the bunker’s storage room. Just hours earlier, his brother had emerged from the basement with a box filled to the brim with baseball gloves, bats, and balls. He had taken the gloves and the balls with them to the park so he could teach Jack how to play catch.
Once he had chosen a school, Sam forged all his necessary documents and he and Castiel went and got Jack enrolled. He met the Vice Principal and answered a few questions for her about his schooling and upbringing. (According to the story Dean and Sam concocted for him, he was homeschooled by his mother until her death and his custody was given to Castiel, his paternal uncle.)
“I’ll be there in a second.”
Right across from Dean, Sam settled in. On his brother’s right sat Eileen. Next to her was Garth and on Garth’s right was Bess. Between Sam and Garth was baby Sam and between Garth and Bess was baby Cas. Next to Bess was Patience, then Charlie, then Stevie, then Bobby.
Castiel marched right up to her desk. “Hello, we received a call. I’m Jack’s guardian.”
Well... he's got one regret.
needed to do this. For his mom and for his grandparents. And for himself.
“Do you forgive me, Jack? Will you let me make it up to you?”
Dean chuckled. “Okay, so what has you all antsy?”
Dean cradled his coffee close to his chest. “Park sounds good. It’s still pretty early so we’ll head out in a few hours. Gotta wait for Miracle to wake up and feed him, too.”
“I…” Castiel’s hands were linked together, white-knuckled and tight on top of his lap. “I knew that if I told you, you would worry. And, at the time, we just got Jack back. And we had Michael to worry about. I… I knew you would try to help. And, then, you would ask what my happiness was. I… I didn’t want to say it… to tell you how I feel because… I didn’t think it would happen, anyway. You were already dealing with so much, I… I didn’t want to burden you, Dean.”
The angel wondered if Dean was always this polite with a potential lover. Not that he was Dean’s lover or anything. They hadn’t even placed a label on what they had. Granted, it had only been days ago that Dean confessed and agreed to give Castiel time to think about whether he wanted this to go further.
Not exactly what he expected to hear. But, then again, he knew by now that John and Mary’s marriage wasn’t as perfect as John's memories made them out to be. John made mistakes and so did Mary. Perhaps, it was for the best. Hey, at least he and Sam didn’t have to go through the mess of watching their parents get divorced.
And, normally, Dean would push. He was tired of secrets and surprises. He wished Jack would just tell them why the hell he left Heaven all of a sudden. If he wasn’t being abused up there and there wasn’t a great flood coming to wipe them and all of humanity away, why was he here?
“Alright. I’ll tell you everything.”
The blaring in his ear was a piercing sound that was not to be ignored. Groaning softly, Jack reached out with an arm to turn it off. He laid in bed for a minute or two, just blinking up at his bedroom's plain ceiling.
It was quick and subtle but the fear in Dean’s eyes was apparent as he looked away from Sam again. Hiding.
So, he didn’t know why he was so surprised when Dean got to his feet, announced that he and his new friend were leaving, sent Sam a wink, and disappeared out the door with the woman under his arm.
“That’s good to hear,” Amara replied, smiling at him. “I’m very proud of what you’ve accomplished so far, Jack.” She leaned back against the sand. “So, what’s next?”
Castiel doesn’t hesitate to answer. “Always.”
“You guys didn’t ask.”
“Cas,” Dean interrupts, happy to hear that Castiel likes his dog but there are important things he needs to say. “Did Sam call you?”
Sam rolled his eyes. “Jack, don’t eat more than one bowl, okay?”
“I mean… I guess I was just wondering… you know… what my parents would think about me…” Claire entwined her fingers with Kaia’s, holding on tight. “Us…”
.. Castiel felt himself release a breath as Jack chattered on and on during the ride back to the bunker.
“It wasn’t stupid,” Jack protested, shaking his head. “It was needed. I would have done anything to save the world.”
Castiel blinked. “I beg your pardon?”
“Hey, Sam.”
Sam spluttered in response but Dean barely heard. He checked the kitchen, the Dean Cave, the bedrooms, and even the bathroom. The place was empty. Where were Castiel and Jack?!
Raphael was openly frowning, his eyes hardened. Michael had his stoic mask on but his lips were pressed into thin line. Gabriel looked calm but his fist on top of the table opened and closed in various intervals. And, Kelly was clearly worried, her hand occasionally jumping to her lips to bite at her nails.
Castiel picked up his own burger and took a bite. As expected… molecules. He could never taste anything. Yet, Dean always seemed to forget. Or chose to ignore it as he would pile Castiel with food, especially if he made it. But, although he wasn’t able to taste the food, Castiel always made sure to show his enthusiasm for it because it boosted Dean’s morale and confidence and Castiel liked seeing him happy.
“I see,” Amara finally said as she sat up. “Why?”
Kelly smiled but the concern in her eyes was clear. “Where’s Jack?” she asked, immediately, looking behind him, as if expecting her son to appear.
He made his way to the kitchen, Castiel’s bag of honey and apple butter in his hand. He had snagged it from the angel’s hold when Jack dragged him away. Sam ambled after him.
Whoa, he really sounded like a dad. Something stirred in Dean’s stomach and he wondered if his lactose intolerance was back.
The younger Winchester didn’t seem to register that he had company, at first. He just sleepily ambled over to the coffee machine and mechanically filled it.
“Michael wants me to give you these,” he explained when Jack rifled through them. “They’re reports on the progress of the renovations and a few small issues that are already resolved. He wants you to be aware of them, even while you’re gone.”
Dean smiled. “Hey, kid.”
“Y-You…” Dean tries but his voice refuses to cooperate.
So, you’d think that when the doctor gives him the green light to go home, he’d be happy. And, he is, really. He can’t wait to leave.
He imagined that he was lighter, like a leaf being carried by the wind to his next destination: himself. He traveled deep into his mind, a sliver of light in a sea of darkness. He was surrounded by nothing but he wasn’t alone. No. Ever since he took on the powers and responsibility of God, he was never ever alone.
He remembered everything that happened in the months following Chuck’s defeat.
“Dean, Jack loves you. You know that, right? Even if he doesn’t see you as his dad.”
That settled it.
“Jack…” Sam chose his next words, carefully. “You know that Dean and I care about you, right? You’re our kid and we want you to be happy. So, if you need to talk about anything that’s bothering you, you can talk to us.”
related).
Dean remembered and laughed.
“Charlie! Stevie! You’re here!”
“Welcome home, Dean.” He could practically see the smile accompanying the angel’s words.
Slowly, he uses all his strength to peel his eyes open. To finally see.
He and Castiel couldn’t read each other’s minds in the same way Dean and Castiel seemed to often do. He didn’t feel like the world had fallen down whenever Castiel died (although, of course, he did mourn him), not in the same way Dean did. And, especially, he didn’t spend the last year drinking himself to oblivion, mourning every day, like Dean did. Their bond has always been much stronger and much deeper.
Jack furrowed his brow. Both Castiel and Sam had their phones out, too.
“And I bet Dean wants to hear it, first. It’s fine, man. You can tell me when we get back, alright? You and Dean… it seems like there’s something unresolved there.”
“Jack, just tell us, please,” Sam pleaded.
After his third glass, Dean pushed it away and caught Castiel’s gaze. The angel found that he couldn't look away.
Jack nodded, eagerly. “I capiche.”
He hung up and called Jack, instead. Dean’s heart was palpitating and if he didn’t know how it felt, he would have thought he was getting a heart attack.
His thoughts returned to earlier, when he was waiting for Sam to come out of the grocery store. He didn’t mean to eavesdrop but his powers gave him very good hearing.
That thought stirred a prickle of guilt in Dean.
But, he couldn’t help but worry about Dean, too. Right now, his brother didn’t have a partner. And, he didn’t seem interested in having one, either. Dean hadn’t hooked up or flirted with anyone in ages. And Sam didn’t want to be one of those younger brothers that were all up in their older brother’s business. Maybe Dean preferred to be single. But, Sam didn’t want him to be alone.
Castiel was still confused. “Why?”
“Why don’t you go to bed?”
“Hang in there,” Sam whispered. “Remember, we’re doing this for Jack.”
Slowly, Jack opened his eyes, wary of how his great-aunt was going to react.
He was silent for a few moments, contemplating. He got his thinking face on so Dean let him be.
“Oh, did he now? What else has he said about me?”
“Right, yeah. We’ll see you two at dinner.”
“Dean!”
He wasn’t certain but was that an application? What for?
Dean wasn’t deterred, though. He kept pinning Castiel down with steely green eyes. They often reminded the angel of fresh grass in the morning, when the blades sparkled with dew. He could get lost in them forever, but now was not the time.
Then, he tossed the paper behind his shoulder and it landed somewhere in the back seat. Mouth falling open a little in surprise, Castiel’s brow furrowed as he watched Dean start the car and begin to drive.
“I know… but I still want it.” He looked down, avoiding Castiel’s gaze. "I want to be selfish about this one thing. I’ve never asked for anything before.”
Sam placed a placating hand on Dean’s arm before addressing the boy. “Jack, when you say you ran away… you left Heaven? Without permission?”
Which brought them back here. To this high school dance. Side-by-side with Castiel. For their kid.
With that, Sam headed out.
“How do you know?”
The kids part of that skit got to their feet and made their way to the stage.
On a normal day, Dean usually got around four hours of sleep. If he was lucky, six. If he was
This kiss was nothing like those. For one, it was chaste. So innocently chaste. And Castiel had witnessed many of Dean’s kisses with others – he was always hard and passionate, almost desperate. So, he never knew that Dean could kiss so gently, so hesitantly, and so carefully.
The couple’s hopeful looks fell, immediately replaced with dread. They held hands, tightly.
“You ran away,” repeated Dean.
"But, I've had it before."
Dean vaguely remembers thinking about Castiel before he fell unconscious. How he hoped that they would meet wherever he ended up. He knew, even back then, that it was a long shot.
“Dean.”
“What?”
“No need.” Castiel stood up to put his plate in the sink. “I’m going to get dressed so I'll get it. Where did you put it?”
I also want to give a shoutout to my new friends and beta readers over at The Profound Bond discord!
It was little things, at first.
Dean anxiously ran a hand through his hair. What he really wanted was another drink but he didn’t want to be too far gone. Not with Castiel here. Not when they’re finally talking about this.
“What?” his brother barked.
Dean nods. “Okay.” He means it.
The countless hours of going through every single book and scroll in the Men of Letters library for any information on the Empty. There was zero.
“I don’t understand why we can’t just order the pizza instead of you making it,” he commented.
Dean sighed. “Fine, you can mix the cornbread.”
“Alrighty, I’ll be here earlier, then.”
TW: Brief mentions of drug use, nothing too major.
Dean made a face. “What? No! Dude, she was like, half my age! I know time has been good to me and all but I’m in my 40’s man!”
“So, you’re moving out? Pretty big step, Sammy. You sure you’re ready?”
“Good.”
Dean turned his head, caught sight of the pies, and perked up even more as he smiled at Castiel. “Thanks, Cas.”
This angel who saved him. This angel who taught him to believe and have faith. This angel who loves him despite his faults and mistakes.
It was a relief to hear that his family and friends were fine. They were happy and at peace. That was all he and Sam ever wanted for them. Now, he was rest assured that someday, hopefully a very long time in the future and not anytime soon, they would both get to join them.
“That sounds… wonderful,” Jack said, almost reverently. “What did you do while you were in school, Sam?”
“I know.” Dean got up and headed for the fridge. He needed a drink. “Juice?”
His brow furrowed. “What?”
“Dean, come on, tell me. What’s going on? You’ve kept things about you and Cas from me, long enough.”
Jack flinched at that. “Did you know that they hated me, at first? The angels.”
“Kid, if there’s something up, we need to know about it,” Dean said, serious for the first time all morning. “No more secrets and no more surprises, got it? We need to know what we’re up against.”
“It will be okay. He may be angry, but he did miss you.”
The thought leaves him as his eyes finally close and his mind blanks.
Jody smiled her motherly smile at them. In her arms was a large covered bowl, which she placed on the dining table.
Dean didn’t seem concerned about Sam’s question. He just popped into Eileen’s line of vision to wave "hello" before heading into the bathroom and shutting the door behind him. The sound of a faucet opening followed.
“It’s not a high price, Dean. In fact, it’s quite reasonable.”
Dean snorted. “What do you mean?”
“Coolio! Meet you in the kitchen!”
The angel nodded and gestured with his hand, a silent invitation for Dean to lead the way.
“I’m going to the store after breakfast,” Castiel finally spoke up as he cleared his plate. “Do you have the list of things you need for dinner?”
“Really?”
That, Eileen apparently found hilarious and she started laughing as she picked up baby Sam.
From the corner of his eye, Sam could see the boy looking guilty for spilling the beans. But, Sam was glad to be aware of the reason.
Feeling braver, Dean leaned in and wrapped his arms around Castiel. For a moment or two, the angel didn't seem to know what to do with his arms. But, eventually, he returned the hug, wrapping Dean in warmth and comfort. He smelled the way he always smelled: like sunshine and freshwater. Dean realized that this was their first hug ever since Castiel returned to them. Why did he wait so long?
Dean blinked.
“Oh, shit,” Dean repeated Sam’s curse and even though Castiel stayed silent, his jaw was tight and his gaze pained as he looked at the image.
“Not right now,” he amended, smiling in reassurance. “I just mean… in the future, you know. But, only if you want.”
Dean thought his head was pretty? Or was that a metaphor? A pop culture reference?
Immediately, she tiptoed to meet his lips and just like that, Sam was home. All the tension in his body dissipated and his worries were, for a moment, buried in the back of his mind. All he could feel was the press of her slightly chapped lips against his and the warmth of her body. Eileen ran her hands through his hair, playfully ruffling it.
If Jack was here, then who was running Heaven?
Dean felt like all the breath had been knocked out of him, followed by twinges of guilt and remorse. He was aware of his own self-loathing, he knew he was fucked up, and he knew he had issues. He just never realized that Castiel, an Angel of Lord, could ever feel that way. Could feel so insecure that he thought he was a burden.
“It’s very delicious, Dean. You should have some before it gets cold.”
They got their work cut out for them.
Dean moved his face closer. “Can I?” he asked.
Well, that was mildly comforting. Dean didn’t really hold up any hope that Adam would call. He might not want anything to do with Dean or Sam. If there was anything Winchester-like about Adam, it was probably holding grudges. Sam was more optimistic when Dean told him about it but he wasn't gonna hold his breath on it.
And, he remembered the frustration, the anger, the feelings of failure, and the constant desire to be numb from everything as he drowned himself in beer and whiskey.
Castiel responded with an exasperated look. “I’ve been cooking for months now, Dean. Are you saying you’re that bad of a teacher?”
And an ugly trench coat that never looks good on anyone but Cas always manages to pull off.
“You’re nothing like Chuck.”
“Do you still feel guilty? About everything?” Sam asked, softly behind him.
Sam’s chest practically bloomed with warmth as he heard and watched those words form. They had said it to each other for the first time around a year ago, when Sam went to see her after the whole debacle with Chuck. They had been ending their phone calls and texts with those words ever since. And Sam never got tired of it.
Kaia tugged at Claire’s hand. “I told you,” she said to her.
Hope sparkled in her eyes, now. Castiel felt like he was intruding in a moment between the two so he excused himself and headed for the refreshments table. The chaperones were all told to check the punch every now and to ensure that the students hadn’t added alcohol to the concoction so Castiel did just that. He ladled some punch into a plastic cup and took a sip. Even if he could only taste the molecules, Castiel could tell that the flavor of punch was bland but it lacked any alcohol content so he deemed it safe for the children. He finished the cup and threw it away before turning back to check on Dean and Miss Johnson.
“You okay?”
“That’s good to hear,” Dean replied, pulling away and slapping the other’s shoulder. “We figured, you know, no apocalypses… no big bad out to destroy us for once… why not, right?”
So, he spent the fourth day browsing the Men of Letters library for something to read. He always enjoyed reading but he rarely ever got the chance to do it for pleasure rather than necessity. He had an infinite amount of knowledge about anything and everything about the universe but humans still tended to surprise him with their creativity.
“So… the archangels, huh?”
The feeling of warmth was spreading all over his body, from the tips of his toes to his reddening cheeks and ears. His heart was pumping hard and fast against his chest, as if it wanted to jump out and dance all over the table like kids from “The Breakfast Club.”
Dean’s chest was feeling a little warm, something he could only describe as pride. That was right, he had a pretty good-looking kid! All the ladies were gonna love him!
“I promise.” He stepped forward to kiss her forehead, affectionately.
Dean was staring intently at him. His green eyes met Castiel’s own blue and dragged down to his nose… his lips. His gaze stayed on Castiel’s lips, brow scrunching in deep thought.
“Of course she would have! She’s me!”
Thank you for being patient!
“I don’t think I’ve been selfish before. I think this is the most selfish thing I’ve ever done.”
“I’m moving out of the bunker.”
“I can do this,” he told himself. “I can tell Castiel what I want.”
Blinding light momentarily forces him to close his eyes again.
What did it say about Dean when he realized he was so used to Garth’s affections that he barely flinched? (Werewolves, man!)
“Husbands, am I right?” said a woman in the next aisle over.
Suffice to say, he was overwhelmed.
Dean bit his lip. “Say anything?”
“I’m just spending time with Miracle. We’re watching a movie called ‘Air Bud.’ He seems to be enjoying it. It has other dogs in it. Would you like to speak to him?”
And, sometimes, even Jack popped in to say “hello.” Castiel always kept a box of Cookie Crunch cereal for him in the pantry.)
“I know I said I’ll talk to Dean soon about me moving out but… I just can’t. Not right now.”
“Dude, come on.”
“That’s not how you pronounce-”
As if realizing that they weren’t gathered in the library for a social call, Jack settled down. He chose a seat next to Castiel, who was standing at the head of the table. Beside Jack was Dean and across from them were Eileen and Sam. It was almost like a replica of Castiel’s own meeting with the archangels and Kelly. Since when was he the type of angel that headed meetings?
“Wassup, bitches?!”
“These are reasonably-priced,” he stated, showing his hoard. “May I borrow your credit card, Dean?”
Who on Earth was Miracle?
“You know?” Jack replied, his brow furrowed in confusion. “And, yes, please.”
“It’s fine, Jack. Okay? Just… go do something else.”
“Four of us,” Kelly interrupted. “Jack’s duties will be divided among the four of us.”
Curiously, Dean turned red. “We were just talking!” he seemed to defend.
This was a trick. It had to be a trick. It had been a year. He was dead.
“Well… yeah. It’s our life, right? And Eileen doesn’t want to stop, either. At least, for now. But… um…”
Mrs. Kline led them into the living room and gestured to the couch before hurrying out of the room, calling out, “Jack! Jack! There’s news about Kelly!”
“What was the case?” Castiel asked as he tore into his roll.
Dean hummed and resumed his task.
Dean really hates it when Castiel is upset. He’s like a puppy who got kicked. And who kicks puppies? Monsters, that’s who.
The angel let out a soft chuckle. “You know I don’t say things that I don’t mean, Dean.”
“I know I can’t replace her, Dean.”
“Dean, I want you to be happy, too.”
“No!... Not yet…”
“That you left again,” he admitted. “I was worried that you left and I might never see you again.”
There was no use in putting off this conversation any longer.
“I want to go to school,” he confessed. “I want to learn things. About the world around me. About myself. I want to make friends. I want… I want to be just a kid.”
And Castiel did think about it.
Castiel’s head tilted to the side as he squinted at her amused face. He didn’t know what gave the impression that he and Dean were married. He wasn’t even wearing a ring. But, the woman didn’t seem to mean anything malicious by it. So, he simply nodded and walked away to find the cheese. Along the way, he also found a bag of those little wheels of cheese that would make a perfect school snack for Jack – a much healthier alternative to nougat. He did promise Kelly that he would watch the boy’s sugar intake. He also passed by a shelf filled with boxes of pie. He deliberated for a second before grabbing one blueberry and one apple.
What about Sam?
“Oh, you’re early.”
“Dean?”
“Well, you should pay attention!”
“As I’ve told you once before Dean, you don’t have to say anything or reciprocate.” Castiel managed a small smile. “I know how wonderful but complicated attraction can be. I was once human, I felt it.”
Well, Dean figured it was no use grabbing beer now and just going back to bed. Might as well keep the kid company.
Castiel must have seen his face because he shakes his head, smiling again.
What did the kids say these days? Things were ‘woke.’
And to Castiel’s disbelief, Jack yanked his arm away from his hold and his eyes glowed golden. The angel took an involuntary step back. He could feel the energy surging from the Nephilim. It prickled his skin and he was sure the Winchesters could feel it too. From where he was hidden, Miracle whined in distress.
“Is there anything we can help you with, Dean?” Castiel asked, already taking out the groceries and arranging them neatly on the counter.
He cleared his throat again that it was starting to actually feel scratchy. He wished he had water in reach because he didn’t want to leave Castiel alone just go to the kitchen for some. Instead, he just filled his glass with whiskey again and tossed that back. Hydrate the throat and get that extra bout of nerve.
They all turned to her, the sole human soul among them. In the past year, while getting to know their new God’s mother, everyone saw how formidable of a woman Kelly Kline was. Lucifer may not have realized it when he impulsively chose her to bear his child but she was one of the reasons why Jack was the kind and gentle soul he was. He also had a bit of that fire and stubbornness Kelly was displaying to them now. She was not to be left behind when it came to helping her son.
“Dean? We’re here.”
“Good. That’s good, Cas.”
When the farmhouse was ready and livable, Dean and Castiel officially moved out of the bunker and into their new home.
Jack nodded eagerly while Zayn sighed and shook his head.
She nodded. “Nice to meet you. Please, have a seat.”
Then, Castiel’s demeanor saddens. “You gave up so soon, Dean. We almost lost you.”
Sam jumped, knocking over the packet of coffee grounds, spilling them on the floor. “Son of a… Dean!”
The man smirked at him and slapped his back. “Come on, I’ll help ya out.”
“You want so many things but I don’t know how possible they are.”
“It’s okay, you can go back to sleep,” Sam says, managing to smile at him.
As if answering his query, his phone rang. Taking it out, he saw Sam’s name flash on the screen. He answered and put it on speakerphone.
“They’re giving you a year, Jack,” he said, solemnly handing over the scroll that listed everything the archangels and Kelly agreed upon.
The time for Castiel’s monthly report to Heaven had arrived. He left the night before and wasn’t back, yet, but he reassured them that he would be back by lunchtime. Every ticking minute that passed made Dean a little antsy but he kept a calm exterior. Sam had already asked him if he was okay last night and this morning so, frankly, it was getting annoying.
So, when the four of them later returned to the bunker, Castiel paced.
He cleared his throat. “Yeah? That sounds great. Sam and I would be happy to have you over.”
Dean was brought back to the present. “What?”
“About what?”
Heartbreaking? What did that even mean? Did he break Castiel’s heart and not even know it?!
“I suppose I should be glad you didn’t use your… abilities,” Castiel continued.
“You could have gotten the ready-made,” Castiel pointed out.
“Everyone who has been resurrected… their next death is their final death. No more resurrections. No more cheating. If I die tomorrow, Jack can’t make deals to bring me back nor can he use his powers. I would belong to the Empty, forever.”
“Okay, Jack, time to de-age,” said Sam, smiling at him in encouragement.
He knew Sam wanted to say something. Could practically feel his brother’s stare again at the side of his head but Dean refused to look at him.
Eileen waved before the screen went dark.
So, Sam clicked on the e-mail.
As a soldier for many centuries, Castiel knew when a battle lost and it was time to retreat. So, he nodded.
He’s here.
Nonetheless, Castiel sighed and returned his chosen tomatoes to their box.
Luckily, Sam came to the rescue. “It’s fine, Cas, we can spare him a new set of clothes. And it’ll be fun! We can look for some new things for you, too.”
Dean took a deep breath and released it. “Four years ago, Kelly Kline witnessed a high-profile crime. She was placed under witness protection until we could apprehend the criminal. The young man you met, he was an asset. Kelly sent him to let you know that she was alright so you wouldn’t worry but he couldn’t reveal details as the case is classified. He was new so the second time he showed up, he was a little overeager and panicked when you started questions. He sends his apologies for his unprofessionalism.”
At that, the couple finally burst into laughter. The heaviness of their conversation was finally lifted with that one joke and Jack felt pretty proud of himself. A bond had been formed between the three of them.
“I’m… sorry, Dean. And thank you.”
The angel’s lip twitched. “As I was saying, Jack and Rowena made a deal with the Empty. Hell, as it turns out, was having its own issues. Rowena didn’t have enough demons to run her… soirees.” Castiel made a face at that. “And she couldn’t ensure the complete loyalty of the ones remaining, seeing as she’s friends with the Winchesters and… well… you did kill many of their kind and their leaders so they still held a grudge. And Heaven, as I mentioned, didn’t have enough angels.”
They all turned back to their ice creams. No other words were exchanged except for the occasional comment about the ice cream and the weather. It really was a nice day and the ice cream was sweet and delicious.
“My stomach has never forgotten, Cas.”
“What the hell-.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, of course, I’ll help!” Jody insisted, already making her way to the counter next to Charlie. She looked down at the potatoes. “You’re making my mashed potatoes, aren’t you? Then, you mix the spices and I’ll take care of the mashing.”
“It’s yours anyway,” said the boy as he watched him pour cereal into the bowl, followed by the milk. “Sam doesn’t eat this stuff.”
However, a few days later, after their Christmas festivities at Jody’s had concluded and they were back at the bunker, Dean’s phone rang while he was researching some cheap real estate in the area on his computer in the library (didn’t hurt to have options, right?). An unfamiliar number flashed on the screen.
“We’re not a thing! But that doesn’t mean that I should just go out and take women home and get into a relationship! How would Cas feel? I don’t wanna hurt the dude!”
Sam rolled his eyes and let out a soft chuckle as he buttoned up a new clean shirt.
Before Castiel could tell him that they needed to return to Heaven soon or the archangels themselves might try to come and drag him back, Dean had jumped in with movie titles. And it made the angel pause, watching the two interact. For the first time since Castiel arrived at the bunker, Jack was finally looking like, himself. Twinkling eyes and vibrating with excitement.
Sam is down at the lobby, getting paperwork done so they can check out. He and Castiel had already said their goodbyes, giving each other tight hugs before parting.
“Because it felt like… it felt like…”
When they finally burned and salted the bones, Sam released a breath of relief. The end of each case always brought about a sense of accomplishment and this was no different. He took a peek at Dean beside him, who was watching the flames with a stoic look. This was their first case together since Jack and Castiel returned so Sam was a little concerned that Dean would be distracted. Throughout their entire drive there, he kept calling Castiel and Jack every couple of hours. But, once they started, his brother was all focus (aside from the few calls to Castiel in the evening, updating him on their status). And, besides, no case was without its bumps.
“You should name it after me, Sammy!”
Nothing was stopping them from giving Jack the life he clearly wanted. And wherever Jack was, Castiel would be there too.
On the T.V., all the kids were dancing like maniacs now while Karla DeVito sang in the background.
Jack laughed and shook his head. “I’m alright. Thank you.”
It was a fascinating conversation and while Jack had listened eagerly, that familiar desire stirred inside him and he remembered Eliot, Max, and Stacey. He wondered how they were, if Stacy had passed her SATs, and if they went to the same school as those teenagers he was watching. He wondered if it was too late to apologize for his mistakes and be friends again. Ever since he met them, he had begun to want something he knew he couldn’t ask for.
“No, I wasn’t.”
The youngest archangel hung his head, looking guilty. “Of course not.”
From the corner of his eye, he could see Casey still struggling with the last couple of problems. He wanted to help but their teacher, Mr. Shay, told them they weren’t allowed to help each other. Jack would have broken the rules for his friend but he didn’t want to get in trouble again. (Though, he did subtly turn his paper in Casey’s direction. If she decided to peek and see his answers, he would just look out the window.)
Out of the four archangels, Gabriel was the one who spent the most time living amongst humans. He had empathy for them. Thus, from the moment he was resurrected, he was always “Jack’s number one uncle” (his words).
Dean mumbled something that sounded like, “Leave me alone, Sammy” before turning on to his stomach. He was snoring again in seconds.
Sam felt a stab of guilt. “Yes, ma’am. May we come in?”
If this is Hell’s way of torturing him… showing him his brother and Castiel and making him believe he’s alive only to take them all away again… damn them all.
“Yes, and I wish to go. But, I have nothing to wear. Can we go shopping?”
Castiel laughs, genuinely. “We’ll do our best.”
“He got waylaid talking to the girls. Do you need him?”
“Let it go, Cas. It’s no big deal. We’re here to chaperone, not hit on teachers.”
He hung up and met Sam’s stare. “What?”
“Oh, you know I would.”
“Oh.” So
. So, when he got his wings back and was able to fly again, he cherished every single moment of it.
“It’s done,” Dean announced when the doors closed.
Instantly, Dean felt his blood freeze. “What happened to Jack? Is he okay?”
But, if Sam continued sending him that smirk every time he said, “Hey, Cas,” Dean was gonna chop his hair off while he slept.
“Will do, Jack,” promised Sam.
“Nice!” Dean signed. “Those bastards don’t stand a chance against Sam Winchester and Eileen Leahy!”
“Are you angry?”
Bobby’s gruff voice broke him out of his reverie.
“At the park. Dean wanted to take Jack out for the day and the weather was good so… here we are!”
Charlie let out a happy squeak. “I knew it!”
Taking a deep breath, Jack placed a hand over Casey’s head. “Thank you.”
A couple of days then. Maybe a week. Dean’s not sure. He should have asked Sam.
Sad sat down at the table so Dean knew he wasn’t leaving until he got him to talk. In the past, Dean would just continue to ignore him until Sam got frustrated and would leave the room. He wanted, desperately, to do that now.
“Do you think if I died, Baby would have come with me?”
Neither of the brothers looked happy to be excluded from the conversation. Nonetheless, Dean whistled for Miracle as he and Sam made to leave the room.
“What the hell is that?!” his brother gasped, gun already in hand.
A flash of hurt crossed Jack’s eyes, making Castiel regret his choice of words.
“She’s still a car.”
Jack preened at the compliment and began talking a mile a minute about his creative decisions.
“Cas.”
“It’s not that I don’t want to, Dean. It’s just… I don’t want you to feel forced.”
The couple beamed while Dean almost choked on his wine.
How long has it been?
But, Jack knew they needed to do this.
Looking puzzled, Sam took the phone and looked at the screen. It didn’t take long for his eyes to widen in shock and an “Oh, shit” leave his lips.
he was his best friend.
“No, not Lucifer,” Castiel replied. “It’s a long story but-.”
Dean must have felt his presence as he looked up and gestured for him to enter. He pointed at the empty recliner next to him with an eager smile.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” Castiel asked, tilting his head to the side.
, his nose scrunched up in disgust. “I didn’t know we still had that. Did you know a bowl of that has more sugar than
He was in bed. At home. Lying on soft sheets and pillows. The sun streaming in from the curtained windows.
“You sure?”
Jack stared at his ice cream, almost gone by now, and sighed.
It was a peaceful night. The cicadas were loud, as always. An owl hooted from somewhere. Above, the clear evening sky was littered with bright stars, as if the heavens, too, were celebrating the addition of another Winchester in this world. Maybe they were. Jack would be aware of the news by now. Dean hoped he would come to visit soon. It had been a while and Castiel missed the kid. (Dean did, too, but don’t quote him on that.)
That familiar, gravelly, pleading voice.
“What are you doing out here?”
Before Jack could ask her what she was thinking, Castiel’s echoing voice broke through his subconscious.
“Yesterday,” Sam answered, helping himself to a generous amount of salad. “We were pretty beat so we ended up sleeping until noon.”
Jack began wringing his hands, probably really nervous. Dean hadn’t seen him this nervous since he broke the news that he ran away from Heaven.
Just like their life, their relationship was simple. Mundane, sometimes. But, if Dean was honest, he wouldn’t have it any other way. Gone were the days of one night stands and denials of how he felt. He was getting too old for all that. He had gone through hell and back (quite literally) plus purgatory. He deserved this, damnit.
Sam didn’t want to say it but knew he had to. “He was with Kelly during the accident. He’s gone. We’re so sorry.”
Out in the hall, the two students earlier were still there, even though the hallways were now empty. They perked up when they saw Jack who, in turn, looked surprised to see them.
Dean swallowed, keeping his gaze on the table. “Adam.”
Sam must have told her, then. At least Castiel wouldn’t have to repeat himself.
Dean flinched. “Bullshit, Sam. Whatever. You ready? Let’s go?”
“That’s awesome. Is Jack doing okay?”
ready for today to be over!” Casey whined softly from next to him, her body slumped over her desk as she tried to keep her eyes open.
“This is my fault.”
Castiel simply chuckled in response.
It was a silly notion, of course, because no matter what he had done in the past, despite all the bumps and many, many, many trials that came along their way and tested their bond, Dean always came through for him in the end.
“Jack? Dinner’s ready.”
“But, that’s not fair! Dylan should have been the one in trouble, not you!” said the boy in the varsity jacket.
She had called Dean around lunchtime that day and told him that she and Kaia were in the area and wanted to stop by for the night. Castiel had been so thrilled that he waited by the door in anticipation. He was the first to hug her “hello” when she arrived and although she scoffed at how silly he was being, he could feel that she, too, was happy to see him – she had hugged him back rather tightly.
With an overjoyed laugh, Sam pulled Jack into a hug. The kid returned it, gripping Sam, tightly.
“You know that’s not true, Claire. Cas loves you.”
He was able to hold it together in the morning during breakfast and all throughout the drive to the high school. But, as soon as Jack entered the doors of the yellow brick building and disappeared from their sights, he had slumped against Dean’s side, feeling like his legs had given out underneath him. His worries were magnified and he couldn't help but think of those movies and shows with the high school kids that included bullying and drugs and everything he wanted to protect his actually-4-year-old-son from. He wished he could accompany Jack as he navigated those halls.
Eileen hummed as she rubbed his arms in comfort.
So, he nodded. “Yeah, I’m down.”
With some classic rock playing from the Spotify app Sam had installed on his phone, Dean resumed peeling potatoes. Soon enough, Charlie joined him. She sidled up next to Dean, who instructed her on how to make the cornbread mix.
“It’s chill, kid. We’re locker buddies, we might as well get along!”
“Glad to hear it.”
And another thing about this weird state of nothingness is that he can’t feel anything. Not his hands and feet. He can’t even wiggle his toes or twitch his nose. He can’t smell anything, either. He can't talk.
When his head was all good and clear, he continued on his way, furiously chewing the bacon still in his mouth. Now that they had another mouth to feed, he would have to do an inventory on their supplies. And get a box of nougat the next time they head out. They were fresh out.
“Oh, Jack Kline! Yes, he’s in my 9
It had been five years since Castiel returned to the Winchesters from the Empty, graceless and human. Even if he was technically God now, Jack still had to make a deal – and the cost was Castiel’s grace. Castiel was no longer an angel and never would be again, even if he stole another angel’s grace. He was fully human, would live a mortal life, and would return to heaven as a human soul when he died.
Sam looks like he’s aged ten years as he sighs and occupies the empty chair next to the bed. “Can you not... do that again, please? I really can’t…”
Dean grinned. “Wanna check it out, Cas?”
From the corner of his eye, he could see Castiel still glaring at him.
“I’m sorry, Cas. Dean.” Jack finally looked up at them, his eyes shining with unshed tears. “I couldn’t control my strength. I didn’t mean to break his nose.”
“Cas.”
“It’s really me. Please open the door. I’m looking for Jack.”
Thinking about Dean’s possible reaction to his plan brought about its own set of worries.
“Just… thinking.”
Meanwhile, Claire’s cold steely gaze was back. She examined him close, as if he was a specimen under a microscope. (They had to do that for Biology class this week.)
Not her.
The boy’s innocence made Sam chuckle. God or not, at the end of the day, Jack was still just a child.
“Yeah. Spent it at work. I volunteer at a clinic while I’m getting my nursing degree.”
Jack beamed at the sight of him, immediately rushing forward to hug him. Then, noticing Eileen, he gave her a hug, too, rapidly signing to tell her how happy he was to see her again.
He was cut off by Jack moving forward to hug him tight. “Thank you, Cas.”
A beeping.
Dean grabbed the jug of
What the fuck?!
“Cas… what if… you can…?” Dean swallows the lump in his throat but forces his voice out. “Have it… I mean… You know…”
Castiel sighed. “Alright, yes, you did the right thing, Jack. But, you drew attention to yourself. You need to keep a low profile.”
“What my brother can’t get himself to say is… thank you. Everyone. We wouldn’t be here without all of you. Without your sacrifice. Those of you who managed to make it here. Those who couldn’t. Those who… didn’t have the chance.”
“Speak up,” Dean growled, his patience clearly wearing thin.
(See the end of the chapter for
Jack’s eyes widened.
“It’s fine, Cas, just… come back home.”
“Okay. Yeah." Dean felt the urge to wrap the angel in a hug too but, instead, he gave his shoulder a few light slaps. "Um, good night then.”
The atmosphere tensed, almost immediately. Even Gabriel’s grin disappeared and his demeanor turned serious and professional.
When Castiel entered the entertainment room, he had to pause at the door to behold the sight.
“Yeah. Hold on, I’ll show you.” Sam tapped the camera’s icon to turn it around so he could point the phone at Dean and Jack. “Hey, guys! Say ‘hi’ to Eileen!”
Sam then opened the laptop in front of him and began to type. “I actually looked up some high schools in the area and made a list for you. How far they are from the bunker. The classes and programs they offer. Sports teams. Any scandals. That sort of thing. You can take a look and see which one is a good fit for you.”
Dean’s blood went cold.
Castiel had told him the story of Jimmy and Claire before. The story was tragic in many different ways and it made Jack’s heart hurt hearing it. Once, he visited the Novaks’ Heaven. He didn’t speak with them but he could see that they were good people with pure souls.
The bangs continued as Dean finally made it to the door.
Staying up all night, bleary-eyed as he clicked and scrolled all over the internet. He made it to the very last page of the search results and still got nothing.
Castiel sat up. “You heard…”
Sam startled at that. Dean wanted to melt into the floor to avoid the rest of this conversation. Instead, he got up and walked back to the counter where he left the pasta. He opened the box before scavenging around the cabinets for a pot.
“He’s out with some woman he met.”
“You’re still angry about that.”
He pressed on the rewind button and forced his eyes to stay on the screen, trying not to think about every single piece of information he had gotten tonight. There had been so much to take in but he didn’t know what to do with them. But, the conversation was as good as done. He doubted he could bring it up again without Castiel closing off, completely.
Biology was also interesting. There was something so special about every single cell that existed in the world. His grandfather was a genius – such creativity! A shame it was wasted on him who didn’t appreciate what he created. How could one get bored with the Earth when there was so much beauty in it?
“They’re at the store,” answered Jack. “Dean needed more stuff for dinner.” He then gestured to the hand turkeys. “Do you guys want to help us put these up? I made these myself! I learned how in school!”
Sam scoffed at the phone as Dean hung up on him.
Jack hummed in response.
“So… you saved me.”
“We got a visit a couple of years from someone who said he knew Kelly,” said Mrs. Kline as she sat. “At first, we thought he was sincere but we found out that no one knew he was. Kelly’s work said she disappeared and might be dead. That’s not true, right, agents?”
Sam’s silent raise of an eyebrow told him all he needed to know so, clearing his throat, he got to his feet.
Castiel took a tentative sip of his own drink – whiskey, he realized – not really tasting it but he always humored Dean when he wanted to drink together. Right now, though, it seemed like Dean was determined to fill himself up with alcohol before having a conversation with him.
“Don’t talk,” his brother says, coming to his side.
Dean simply flashed him a look, lightly patted Jack on the shoulder, and followed his brother out, Miracle at his heels.
The hunter scoffed. “Clearly, it’s still bugging the kid. He’s all sad and insecure and thinks I still hate him… Goddamnit, I never wanted that.”
But, he had sworn to Kelly that he would raise and protect her baby. He vowed to become the baby’s father. Yet, he died. And, even when he returned, he kept making mistakes with Jack. Over and over and over again.
Now, Claire’s familiar blue eyes being familiar to him made sense. They were Jimmy Novak’s eyes. And Castiel’s eyes.
Beside Dean, Jack bit on his lip. “Dean, I…”
Chuckling, Sam got to his feet and stretched, feeling his muscles uncoiling. “Fine. It’s late anyway.” He pinned Dean with a serious gaze. “So, you’re okay with me moving out? And school?”
“Thinking of going back to school. Yeah. That’s… yeah.”
“Better now than later.”
And Dean, himself, had changed. He didn’t flinch when men touched him anymore. He no longer minded the occasional flirty looks and winks thrown his way. In fact, he was quite flattered to be considered attractive enough to both sexes. And if Dean were to have a male partner, why not Castiel? He understood Dean in the deepest and most intimate ways. They made a good team in everything they did. And Castiel was his best friend.
Then, there were the photographs they had taken from Kelly’s old computer (that Jack now owned). Kelly was a sentimental woman and had taken various photos of herself when she was pregnant with Jack as well as photos of the nursery she made for him. With these, Sam did his best Photoshop work and manufactured photos of a baby Jack (really just a photo of the baby he grabbed off Google and manipulated to have Jack’s features).
Thus, the first week with Jack in school passed and they celebrated the end of it with pizza and game night in the War room. Castiel discovered that he, Sam, and Eileen were rather good at “Clue” while Dean was the worst (and a sore loser, unfortunately). Jack was just happy to play.
“I could but I didn’t get one.”
“My ex never tried to cook for me,” she said with exaggerated sadness.
His mom. Dad, too. And, Adam, why the hell not?
I struggled with the vessels part here but “Supernatural” keeps changing their own lore anyway so... might as well roll with it.
Dean placed a glass on the table in front of Castiel and filled it. Then, he took the seat across and filled his own glass. Without saying another word, he drained the glass, slammed it on the table, and filled it again.
So, he just nodded, feeling the weight on his shoulders lift.
“Let’s try this one,” Dean said, taking the plain black tie and handing the rest to Castiel.
“Cool.”
He’s not stupid enough to waste it.
Castiel blinked. “What do you mean?”
At that, Mrs. Kline lifted her head. “J-Jack? Is that… what she named our grandson?”
“Why not?”
“You didn’t know it would make me God, Dean.”
“A couple might be a little over our budget but I really liked how they look and they could be worth it in the long run,” she explained as Sam opened the links. “But, if you don’t like them, let me know, okay?”
Still… he figured he was entitled to some apprehension. After all, he had never been in love before. Truly in love. Not just fascination or infatuation or fondness. True and profound love.
“My uncle,” Jack said. “He’s here with me and my dad.”
“Yeah, they were a bitch to find. We really need to organize that room, you know. Maybe throw some stuff out we don’t need? I swear, those Men of Letters were hoarders. They’re even worse than you, Dean.”
When Sam woke up precisely at 5:30 that morning, he expected another routine day. He got up, stretched, check his phone and other phone for messages, got dressed in sweatpants and a hoodie, and made his way down the hall, stretching his arms up as high as they could go along the way. As he passed by Dean’s room, he noticed the door slightly ajar. Unable to help himself, he peeked in.
Well, Dean had always liked Castiel’s eyes – or, to be more accurate, Jimmy Novak’s eyes. They were a pretty blue that reminded him of a clear night sky. But, the way they sparkled was different when Jimmy back in control of himself. Not that Jimmy wasn’t a handsome man ‘cause Dean could now admit that he was. But, when it was Castiel, things were different. The eyes held so much more.
The kid hung his head, his silence confirming his answer.
“We tried to bring you back, you know,” Dean whispered so low that he wondered if Castiel could even hear him.
Castiel felt his own brow furrow and his head tilt to the side. “Don’t you want to go home? Your mother has been worried, Jack.”
“Okay,” Jack responded but he didn’t sound like he believed Castiel, at all. “But, I’m selfish, aren’t I? For asking this?”
“Dean.”
Sam slowed down and watched in amusement as Jack continued to talk to the dog as they walked ahead of him. Seeing that they were okay and Miracle wasn’t breaking away from his leash to chase a cat, he ducked into the grocery store.
“Okay.”
Sam flashes him a look when they reach the car, his hand held out.
“Jack saved me,” Castiel answers. “He got me out. Took me to heaven.”
Dean huffed. “Yeah. Pathetic. I know.”
The nearest park to the bunker had the best view of the sunrise and sunset. So, naturally, Sam picked that as the place to be whenever he was out running.
“Morning, Cas,” he greeted, settling himself at the table where a mug of coffee already waited.
grade. That way, you can go to prom and graduation.”
Jack smiled. “I like it. Dean thought I might have a hard time, he worries a lot about me. But, I think I’m doing okay.” He paused for a second, contemplating if he should tell them. “Actually, last week, I got detention. I punched someone.”
Jack forced a smile on, said “thank you”, and immediately left the kitchen. Behind him, he could hear the padded footsteps of Miracle following him out. He stopped to wait for him and, unfortunately, caught the start of a conversation in the kitchen.
If the outside of the school was chaotic and crowded, the inside was even more so. Jack had taken a tour of the school with Sam and Castiel when they enrolled him but the building had been empty then. Now, he could barely recognize the halls.
“And that, Sammy, is why I’m her favorite.”
“I guess it was about time.”
The looks exchanged lasted much longer and the silent conversations got even deeper. Dean smiled at Castiel more and the angel returned them, still looking shy but definitely happier. And Dean touched Castiel more – little brushes against his arm when he passed the angel, pats on the back, and, one time, Jack could swear he saw Dean attempting to hold Castiel’s hand when he thought no one was watching.
Sometimes, his brother’s actions really confused him. Sam just hoped he didn’t regret this.
Still... he couldn't help but wish that Jack did see him as a father. Because Dean certainly saw him as a son.
“Casey has seen this post?” Castiel inquired.
“Hey, Red,” he greeted. “Thanks for coming. You, too, Stevie.”
“Mmhmm. Gonna be re-watching the first season of ‘Attack on Titan.’ Wanna come over?”
“I’m just thankful,” Dean decided.
“Promise not to play with the knives?”
So, Sam simply waited. He checked his phone for the time. Only forty-five minutes had passed since they left. They should probably stay out a little longer, give the two back at the bunker more time. They could stop by the bakery and pick up dessert for dinner. Something that would put Dean in better spirits. So, a pie, obviously. And Eileen had texted him while he was at the store – she had just finished a rugarou case and was on her way home. He began to text her back.
There was a poltergeist wreaking havoc at a church in Montana. A priest had died and several others were injured when several statues in the church exploded on its parishioners during an evening mass.
“I was! I just…” Jack hesitated again, as if he wasn’t sure exactly what to say.
Dean didn’t know what to say to that but Bobby didn’t need an answer. He finished chopping the last of onions, his eyes dry and unaffected, and dropped them on the plate.
He raised his glass in a toast and everyone responded by raising theirs, as well.
It was denial, anger, bargaining, back to anger, back to bargaining, back to anger, over and over and over again until depression hit… he never even made it to acceptance.
Dean never thought he would be one of those dramatic parents that burst into tears when their kid achieved something. But, right now, he felt like he needed to sit down and take it all in.
“How?”
Jack beamed in gratitude and nodded. “Thank you so much, Zayn. I’ve never been to school before so I’m not quite sure about the etiquette involved.”
“It is plenty of time. To my knowledge, humans spend at most ten months in school per year. Jack has an extra two months. That’s more than sufficient for him to experience how it is to be a human child.” To this, Gabriel’s gaze softened with sympathy. “We can’t be without God for too long, Castiel. You know this.”
“Nothing happened, Sammy,” said Dean in a soft tone Sam rarely ever heard him use. Only when he was really hung up on something and even that was a rare occurrence. “I drove to her place. She got out of the car. And I… I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t go in with her. She was hot and sexy and willing and I hadn’t been laid in ages but… I didn’t want to go in with her. I… I ended up pretending I got a call… Said some bullshit about an emergency with you and hightailed it out of there. Wasn’t even there for five minutes. Then, I just… drove around to clear my head.”
“The hunting life caught up, I guess. Dad went missing, Dean needed help, we worked on a case, my girlfriend was murdered… a lot happened.”
Almost a whisper against his skin, if he even has any.
Castiel squinted. “You haven’t thought about hunting?”
“Maybe they’re in the dungeons,” Sam suggested, jokingly.
Dean paused, his eyes widening. “You would do that?”
He knew the angel was right. Accepting help was still tricky for him, sometimes, but he knew he had a lot of cooking to do with the number of guests they were having. He wanted this to be a good Thanksgiving for everyone.
“Thank you, Sam.” Castiel truly appreciated it.
That made Castiel frown. “Dean doesn’t hate you. He’s made mistakes in the past and I’m sure he’s sorry for them. But, he doesn’t hate you.”
Castiel shakes his head. “No, he didn’t.”
Castiel was silent for a moment, contemplative. Dean picked up a gun and began to take it apart. The motions were second nature, at this point, so he barely thought about it.
Sam coughed. “Uh… I kinda do. We heard you last night.”
Defiantly, Dean stuck a spoonful of cereal into his mouth, making sure to maintain eye contact with his brother.
Jack looked down at his feet, wiggling his toes against the grains of sand. Luckily, this was all in his subconscious so he didn’t have to clean up when he left it. He wondered if he had time to make a sandcastle.
Dean clears his throat. “About… the last time I saw you…”
The hunter swallowed the uncomfortable lump in his throat. “C-Cas…”
They ended up watching “The Breakfast Club.” Castiel wanted a movie that could help him better understand the dynamics of high school and teenagers. Though it probably didn’t help now since the movie took place in the ’80s and it was 2021 but Dean couldn’t think of another movie involving teenagers. With all the hullabaloo with Lucifer and Michael and Chuck, they didn’t exactly have the time to go to the theater. Anything on Netflix, Hulu, and their meager selection of DVDs was often enough to entertain them.
They left the door open. Castiel was about to shut it with his grace when Jack talked.
Dean, who had left the kitchen to meet them after getting their text, soon found himself with a mouthful of red hair and slim arms tight around his middle.
Dean pulled back. “I’ll send her a text later. The girls with you?”
should have tried harder, Jack.”
That question seemed to catch the angel off-guard. He was staring at Dean like he’d grown three heads or something.
The red light turned green and the car moved again.
Dean cleared his throat. “Now that that’s done, let’s just enjoy the afternoon, okay?”
