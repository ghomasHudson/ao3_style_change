"Dean. " Castiel cupped Dean's face, "You know I can totally hear Crowley and you talking in the bathroom."
"Dean, is it the mark that makes you a demon?" Castiel selectively ignored the other man's question, frowning tightly and sitting up slightly, "We'll figure it out, I'll talk to Sam now-"
The handsome demon smiled, and there was no doubt that Castiel would not mistake this soul he had touched with his own hands, even if it was tarnished beyond recognition at the moment. His few remaining graces did not allow him to fully see the demon's face, he could feel the circle of evil restlessness wrapped around the soul of the righteous, Dean Winchester and the demon before him shared the same face, but very different from one another. The demon's hand touched Castiel's face and he looked like he was lamenting something with a fake exaggerated sigh, "Cas, my angel, you're about to die, aren't you?"
"Where are we going?" Castiel decided not to bring up any of his discomforts, "If the destination is far, I get tired too easily now and will probably fall asleep in the car."
He returned his attention to the task of giving Dean a blowjob. He didn't enjoy the sensation, but perhaps that was the magic of sex, as Dean was pleasured by it, Castiel's belly felt warm, and he was hard and aching, but could only occasionally rub himself against Dean's leg for comfort. He didn't notice he was squirming around, and when Dean suddenly pointed that out, he gave the demon a somewhat surprised look.
He lifted the hem of his robe and brushed his fingers gently up the inside of Castiel's leg, finally stopping at the entrance where Castiel could feel Dean's thick, strong fingers swirling in a circle, occasionally poking in gently, but only shallowly, teasing and then pulling out. Castiel's thighs tensed and his breath caught. He clenched up a bit on the next tentative reach of Dean's finger, unwilling to let the demon's hand withdraw so quickly. Amused by his reaction, the demon patted Castiel's leg, "Easy, little one, you'll get what you want."
When the lips parted, Dean still held his face, the demon's look quite tender; in fact, Castiel couldn't remember if he'd ever seen such a look on the original Dean's face.
"Daniel, why did you just leave on your own?" The face I knew too well to be more familiar came into view, her eyebrows raised high, mean and critical as ever. My dear sister met me with her sharp eyes, and despite her pursed lips, I assumed she was glad to see me alive.
“Why Cas, I think your romantic side is showing.” Kissing him again quickly, Dean continued, “…which is fine by me, but still I would like to take you out do this properly. You know, dinner, movie, meet the friends and family eventually…”
His voice had faded off leaving the room in dead silence. Dean’s heart was beating so loud he was sure the others could hear it. “What…so like the Genie? Are you going to grant us three wishes? Does that make me Aladdin?”
But Dean also knew he was lying to himself. Not like he wanted Eileen for himself. No, she was actually rather perfect for his dorky little brother. No, Dean wanted Cas….as hard as that was to admit to himself.
Cas stumbled back and slammed himself against the wall next to his window. He had to look away since he couldn’t believe what he saw. There, plain as day, on Deans TV were two very good looking muscly men…and no women in sight. Cas groaned. That couldn’t be what he saw. It had to have been his tired eyes and wishful thinking. But nonetheless, he turned and slowly pulled the curtain open slightly so he could see if it was true.
With his free hand Cas grabbed the lube, deftly opening it and managing to get just enough on his fingers and a fair amount on the bed while he was at it. Dean was so distracted by his mouth that Cas had no problem sneaking a hand between his legs. He slowly and with care breached him with one finger, while keeping up his ministrations on his cock. As expected, he let out a shuddering gasp and pushed down onto his finger, impatience winning out.
I only have a few more chapters left to post that are all written/beta'd already so posting may slow down a bit soon. I am continuously writing and trying to stay ahead of posting though. Just FYI. Thanks for continuing to read! :)
When it looked like his mother wasn’t going to say anything Cas just sighed. “I love you and thank you for everything you have done to raise me, but it’s time for me to go. Please give my best to Dad. Goodbye Mother.” She didn’t stop them as they walked out the front door, down the steps and to his car. After throwing their bags into the backseat with the rest, Cas spun Dean around and pinned him to the side of his car.
He looked over to Dean after he made his little impromptu speech. There was nothing but pride and love shinning from his eyes. He wanted to kiss him so bad right now but he knew that would be taking it a little too far in front of his mother.
“Ooohhh fuuuuck…” Cas had leaned forward and engulfed Dean’s cock, swallowing it almost whole with no warning. It took everything Dean had to not blow it all right then and there. Slowly, Cas pulled his mouth up and then slowly back down his dick as he started a slow tortuous rhythm.
“Yes Dean, I agree.” Dean put the last plate down to dry as Cas spoke again, “Shall we pick up that TV show again and continue our marathon.”
Cas, who was silent through this whole speech, stepped forward. “I do think she is telling the truth. Perhaps she was brought back by the Jinn? He did say that he grants wishes…” With a heavy look over at Sam, Dean finally understood. He knew that Sam had had a crush on Eileen before her passing. Hell, he had even thought there was a damn good chance of them getting together if his brother would’ve just pulled his head out of his ass. Was this what that genie character meant? He could see that Sam wanted Eileen back- so he just brought her back? He thought Sam’s greatest desire would have been to get mom back. But it made some sense.
“Dean!” He felt himself shiver. His voice was deeper than he remembered, and all he could think was how much he liked the sound of his name coming out of that mouth. He seemed to be as surprised as Dean was to seem him.
Dean couldn’t drag his eyes away from the TV. That was until he saw movement out of the corner of his eye. Cas wasn’t watching the screen anymore. No, he had turned to watch Dean, to see his reaction to the obviously gay, hot as fuck, sex currently playing loud as hell on the TV.
“Condoms…” he bucked his hips forward to match his rhythm, “…and…ohhh…lube are in the bedroom…” Dean ran his hands up Cas’ back and pulled him flush against him, stopping his movements completely, “And I don’t feel like coming in my pants like a horny teen right now…” he dragged his hand around the front of Cas, grabbing ahold of his cock and stroking it as best he could through his jeans, “…not when I could have this inside me instead.”
“No Dean, that’s why there are so many people here today.” Charlie gulped down a good half of her coffee and continued. “He doesn’t do interviews or book tours.”
“You’ll be in the doghouse if you don’t start talking! Dammit Dean. You played stupid over all of this and all along you knew him?!”
“I would love that Dean. Truly.” He paused. “To meet your family, your friends. I want to know whatever you are willing to tell me and get to know the real you. I mean, that is…well…if you want.”
“Look, see – there are no cars in the driveway.” He pulled along the curb in his normal spot. “We should be fine. This will be quick since I don’t plan on taking any of the furniture. We’ll just hurry.” Cas was painfully aware of how cold and unfeeling this house felt as they entered. He had never spared it much thought in the past, but as they walked through the beige entry, up the simple stairs and down the plain hallway, Cas was struck by how impersonal the house felt, especially compared to Deans parents’ house which was bursting with life and Charlies eclectic house. There were very few family pictures in the house, his mother choosing instead to put up black and white photos of landscapes.
“And last, but not least – Dean Winchester.” He heard his brother yell out ‘woohoo’ in the crowd as he bounded up the steps. He smiled and shook the principles’ hand as he whispered a “Good job son, I’m proud of you.” Dean just laughed a bit because that could change in a moment.
“You don’t want to hear that.” Dean answered her quickly, deflecting. Cas was getting better at reading him after months of seeing each other almost daily. It was like, once they met, they didn’t want to not see the other. It was a whirlwind, more sparks and more feeling than Cas had had in any of his previous relationships, combined. But in this case, Cas knew Dean was a little shy and embarrassed about their first initial meeting.
“More like incorrigible.” He sighed and looked at his half eaten eggs. “I’ll make you a deal.” Bal perked up at that. “If, and I mean a huge if at that, if he so much as puts on gay porn – I’ll talk to him. But otherwise, this is just going to go down as a ridiculous fascination with my hot new neighbor. I’ll buy blinds instead of flimsy curtains and keep them closed at all times to resist the temptation to look.”
Dean caught his arm to stop him before heading out his bedroom door. “I want you to know that whatever happens down there, whether we run into her or not, I support you and any decision you make. You want to come out to her officially or not at all – I am there. You just want to walk out and never talk to her again, you got it. I’m following you Cas, to the ends of the earth if needed.”
But it was the front section of this little “museum” that kept Cas coming back. Here you could find art for sale from some of the local talented artists. Of course, there were always several pieces that made Cas question how subjective art actually was. Sometimes he had those really disrespectful thoughts of
He continued gently biting and kissing at his neck as Cas rumbled an answer. “….I…uh…I wanted to know if they’re everywhere and not just across your face…”
Dean was confused on how an author could be so popular and stay so firmly out of the limelight. “What is he, Mafioso?”
“Yup. Dean was shitfaced at that strip club and was paying more attention to his phone, ie YOU, rather than the stage. I snapped his phone off the table when he went to the bathroom. I was just joking around, but I realize now that that was a mistake. It’s obvious how much Dean loves you and I didn’t mean to fuck that up. I am sorry. I will be apologizing to Dean too. It wasn’t until we got back and Dean was so upset because suddenly you were avoiding him at home that I had to come clean.”
Cas nodded along. He had met John, once. He was what you would call “old school”. He was very much a believer that women belonged in the kitchen, men only married women, and men went to work while the women raised the children. It was very 1950s of him and Cas still couldn’t believe how well-adjusted Dean and Sam seemed while being raised with John as a dad. To be fair, Mary was a sweetheart and more often than not, overruled John.
Thankfully, Charlie and Jo waited until they reached his car before they pounced on him. Obviously they knew that whatever association that “Jimmy” had with Dean was something he didn’t want all the fans surrounding them, listening intently, to know.
A face, Cas suddenly realized, that was looking at the piece of artwork in front of him with no little amount of discernable distaste. For a moment he hadn’t even noticed the painting, the attractive stranger held all of the appeal, so he turned his attention towards the apparently offending artwork. It was much like other pieces by this artist. Muted colors in browns, tans, greens and yellows. It was several moments of putting the fragments together in the giant picture to realize it was an abstract man. This was the first time that the artist had rendered something that was living. At least as far as Cas noticed. Most of the paintings until that moment had been scenery as much as he could tell.
Dean was brought back to the present as the row of people in front of him were now standing and heading to the stage. He had apparently zoned out for more than half the graduation process. That suited him just fine because it made this time go by faster. Before he knew it, he was standing on the steps at the side of the stage, waiting as the kid in front of him, Gadreel Weston, shook the hand of the principle and then received his diploma, handed to him by Cas.
Cas was beyond relieved once he received that last couple emails. He didn’t think he could handle developing feelings for a guy that has been one of his past tormentors. And he was. He was developing feelings that went beyond friendship with this guy. And now he knew some things that could ID him. He was a senior, jock but not one of bullying ones, which seriously narrowed it down, with a younger brother that was taller than him. That younger brother was probably in middle school, maybe a freshman, but that didn’t help much.
Their luck didn’t last. His mom came into view around the corner of the stairs just as they reached the bottom.
“I’ll put it this way – either go over there and profess to him how much you would like to help him with his nightly relaxation or write him into a book like you did me.”
Dean laughed; there was a touch of madness to the sound of it as he threw the book on his front seat and slammed the door.
They both moaned as Dean pushed his hips forward letting Cas know that he was obviously hard and totally on board with that idea. It didn’t matter that the backseat of his car was packed near to the ceiling with his stuff. With the way Cas was currently feeling – he’d fuck Dean across the hood of his car on the football field if he had to.
He didn’t even realize that they made it to nearly the front of the line until he heard Charlie whisper loudly, “Oh my gosh, they were all right. Look at his eyes.”
“Then you would have!” Cas interrupted them. “I couldn’t just let you walk into your potential deaths. I could handle it!”
“Yes, Your Majesty,” he sarcastically replied, while doing a bow. A few people in the row watching snickered. Dean was pretty sure that if Charlie had had anything in her hands she could throw at him, she would have.
Cas ushered everyone inside the bunker, Sam trailing along mutely, still unbelieving, and Dean was wondering if good things did sometimes happen to Winchesters. Within minutes, Dean was giving Eileen the all clear and suddenly she found herself with Sam wrapped around her. She couldn’t have held back her tears if she tried.
Cas laughed. “That’s different Bal, we’re friends. I put your characteristics in the book because I hadn’t ever met anyone like you before I moved into my last place and it was great for my story ideas.”
But he felt like he was a teen sitting next to crush watching sex. Which wasn’t too far from the truth. But it wasn’t even some vanilla sex – it was straight up every variation of, and hell, let’s throw in an orgy too while we’re at it, type sex.
“Where’s the lube Dean?” Cas muttered against his neck while he reached down, stroking Dean much the same way he had seen Dean do many times before.
“Very smart, Angel.” The creature snapped his fingers and they all felt the pressure of their bindings release. Shuffling quickly to his feet, Dean reached out his hand to help Cas up, turning in time to see Sam already standing warily next to him. Dean didn’t even realize that he had yet to release Cas’ hand when the Jinn started to speak again. “You will go from here, and live your lives. I mean you no harm. And if reality comes to pass and your wish-” He paused and let an almost sarcastic grin cross his face. “If your wish does comes true, than I will be quite pleased.”
Dean was shaking his head no, pulling out his phone and texting before he was even done saying no. “Dude, no, seriously. My mom would love it. She so rarely gets to meet the people who see her work or interact with them. She would definitely not think it was an imposition.”
“Well…you kind of look like shit Cas…” Charlie was leaning on her door frame as he approached, clearly, she had seen him pull up to her place.
Or this text was honestly sent to the wrong person and Cas was working himself up into a panic for nothing. But by the time his lunch rolled around, he had drafted and discarded dozens of responses to Charlies text. He finally settled on the most logical choice.
"A place with no name." Dean replied, pulling his burger out of the paper bag, handing one to Castiel and taking one for himself, humming a song under his breath, not one of the ones Castiel often heard Dean play in the car, so he wasn't familiar with it. But Dean looked so happy; so happy, in fact, that it seemed like the time they had both been kicked out of a brothel years ago.
I turned my head and met the man's green eyes. He looked no more than thirty or forty years old, and the fine lines at the corners of his eyes when he smiled did not detract from his charm. He was dressed in rather old-fashioned clothing, his sleeves pulled up to reveal a lean, sturdy arm, and was bending down to throw two more sections of wood into the fire, I swallowed nervously, however much the man before me looked like a normal man, I thought basic courtesy and respect was still necessary, "Hello, honourable Father of Heaven."
Castiel came first. His cock spurted out quite a lot, but not only down there, his chest also thoroughly wet Dean's hand at the moment of his climax, translucent white cream dripped from between Dean's fingers, and Dean only had time to catch a small amount, which he took a sip of before kissing Castiel in an awkward position, sharing the contents of his mouth with his angel.
The blue-eyed man moaned in discontent, but finally, he wrapped his arms around the other man's neck and leaned in to kiss the other man, every kiss passionate and wet at the corner of his eyes to his lips, "Honey, please - let me cum first, and I promise I'll be at your service all night. Please, Dean."
Castiel's eyes couldn't focus as he felt Dean's free hand snap his face over and his fingers went to his mouth, "Lick it, Cas."
His eyes were on Dean for a moment, and his other hand reached down to where Dean usually kept his change, and after fumbling around for some time, he finally found a one-dollar coin. Dean walked a little, just behind the shelf, Castiel exhaled, immediately opened the car door, quickly walked to the phone booth, fortunately, he knew Sam's number by heart.
I heard a small tinkling sound as the curtain with the beaded shards hanging from it was lifted and a man, who also looked to be in his middle age, was carrying two steaming drinks on a tray and looking gently towards us. His belly was slightly bulging, and the man's face glowed a pale orange in the firelight, the streams of light lining those blue eyes even more watery.
For the angel, he'd been fucked many times, but this was the first time he'd done anything like this. He looked down in confusion and Dean knew he could see the pink head of his cock squeezing out from between his legs, and because of that thought, he was even more excited and almost painfully hard.
From the first week when his grace declined to a dangerous level, Castiel clearly felt that he was slowly dying. Unlike every death he had ever experienced (and frankly, the number was a bit too much), this one was slow, almost could be poetically described as lingering. Every death in the past had left him with the impression of swift pain and ensuing darkness, as if he had been torn into some empty place where nothing existed, not even himself. But this death was different - he was losing his strength bit by bit; at first, he was losing his ability to heal others - there was nothing he could do to help Sam about his unfortunate broken hand - and secondly, he began to need sleep. Lots and lots of sleep, almost endless sleep. He had trouble staying awake for long periods of time, as if his body had automatically selected for him the option that would burn the longest. He ate whatever he had brought back from his last trip to the supermarket, in place of his grace - someone else's grace - to provide his body with some energy. Further back, getting up had become too daunting a task for him, so he spent the entire day in bed, his life is simple and pure: sleep, eat, stay awake, with the sole purpose of living, for as long as possible.
To my surprise, the other man just rolled his eyes, "Oh come on, call me Dean, that name gives me goosebumps."
"It's not." Castiel took a drink, and then he put the cup on the bedside table, "I didn't fall from heaven for you because of the spell, and I didn't stay because of the spell."
It's true that I've never had one of these before, and I can't say that I like it very much or hate it. But the cup did a good job of keeping the other two out of sight, and I think that was enough for me to like it.
He began to work his way upward, the demon was far more energetic than his now weak, humanoid body, all Castiel could do under his tug was raise his head and expose his vulnerable throat, like the way an animal displays submission. Dean intruded closely, Castiel thought driftingly, he had witnessed countless lives mating and reproducing, but just like his dreams, it was only when he actually experienced it that he knew that watching and practicing were so different. While he was still an immortal warrior of God, he could not understand the reproduction of life - even though the angels did not all reject the sexual act, he had never felt his need to participate in it. He found sexual things repetitive and uninteresting, and he observed them, but in the same way as he would observe a flower blooming or a buffalo wagging its tail in a field. Plants pollinated by the coming and going of bees, humans caress and explore each other's bodies, to him these two are but one and the same thing. From the point of view of a life form that has existed for billions of years, he cannot understand how not only the competition for reproduction, but simply sex can cause war for humans. When he first felt human sex under the deception of a reaper, he realized that this particular pleasure did have reason to be fascinating - when you are surrounded by so many strange and painful feelings, the sensual stimulation of exploring your body can make you temporarily forget those things for a few hours. But he was also a little disappointed: he was expecting more. Maybe there was something he wasn't getting.
The next day was a beautiful, sunny day. Castiel sat on the Impala, the sunlight bathing him all over, but he was so weak that his hands and feet still felt cold, and he shrank into a ball and shivered, trying to wrap himself tightly in his trench coat.
I have to preface this by saying that I don't understand a word of whatever they're saying, but that doesn't stop me from giving them both an odd stare. Soon a vial of clear blood was handed to me, and Castiel gently grabbed Dean's hand and kissed his dripping palm, which immediately healed.
"I want to fuck you, angel. I thought I'd made that clear?" His hand moved down a few more inches and stroked along Castiel's tight thighs, a body that wasn't exactly robust, but every bit of muscle had grown just right, a combination of strength and beauty, so to speak. When the thin calloused hand of the demon's knuckled hand slid to the inner thigh, Castiel took a deep breath and caught Dean's hand in turn for the first time.
"Go to sleep." Dean hugged Castiel tightly from behind, the big spoon wrapped around the little one, "Don't think about anything."
"No time?" Crowley asked rhetorically in his irritatingly sarcastic tone, his index finger tapping rhythmically on the table, "Someone just got out of bed. You two - how many hotels have you fucked around in? Or is it your grand plan to hit every motel in town?"
Cas hummed around him and pulled off with an exaggerated pop, “Would you like me to stop? You seem to be having a hard time making up your mind tonight.” He paused; Dean had a smattering of freckles on his hip. He dropped a quick kiss to them before engulfing him again.
Disappointed and bored with his last look at Dean, Crowley's figure simply disappeared into thin air, the midnight without the noisy visitors from Hell, silence and shadows as companions, clutching every traveller who wandered in the night. The man who remained in place did not leave immediately, he stared at the clock hanging on the wall behind the empty reception, the hour hand exactly pointed to three o'clock, and finally smiled silently and turned towards the room he had rented.
"...Is not fried chicken." Castiel said softly, Dean realized the seriousness in his tone and he turned his head to meet the angel eye to eye, "Never because of anything else."
Then he didn't last long, because for the love of Jack (no, Jack, don't look at this, close your eyes), Dean was sure no one could resist Castiel's mouth. It was a sinful mouth, and Dean had failed countless times at its vast skills. It seemed that after teaching a pupil the teacher had to pay a price. Milky white cum splattered across Castiel's face and chest, and even some stuck to his eyelashes, pulling out long, thin silver strands as he blinked. He looked like a mess, yet innocent as he straddled Dean holding his stomach, tossing his pyjamas aside and exposing his body naked to Dean. Dean probed Castiel's lower body with his hand - he was wet.
"Oh, I'm glad you remembered you're wanted." She said coldly, dropping her eyes. I coughed unnaturally, sensing the hidden impatience in her words (and the implied subtext that you're dead if you come back), deciding to stop in time before the volcano erupted, and hastened to apologise to her in a low tone. It was my lucky day, I guess, and Sophia smiled at me for the first time and spared me. The woman's figure in the projection faltered for a few seconds because of the poor signal, and then I saw her tap on the electronic screen beside her and send over a drawing that looked quite old.
It wasn't exactly a lie, at least at the beginning of that week. Castiel sat warily in his room, no longer expecting to be able to inform Sam under Dean's nose, so all he could do at the moment was stare at the uninvited demon who hummed a little while he covered his sandwich in a thick layer of jam.
He had Castiel's back pressed against his chest, riding on his lap, Castiel's ass, too plump for a male torso, pressed against Dean's lower back. The angel rubbed up sensibly, rubbing through the fabric of Dean's pants, even swinging in circles, almost swallowing the erect cock with the cloth attached. But Dean didn't give him that chance - he pulled down his zipper and struggled to pull down his underwear, finally allowing his imprisoned cock to breathe, then he used his hands to force Castiel to clench his legs together and deliberately, bit by bit, shoved his cock between Castiel's legs. Castiel had legs that were born to be fucked, and an incredibly bouncy ass. Whatever this meant to others, in Dean's eyes, there was no way he was going to pass up the opportunity to try his hand at leg fucking.
Even better, the reception here is terrible (the benefit of dealing with supernatural beings is that you're always isolated when you need to contact someone).
They look like the angelic blade that belonged to Metatron, stained and dripping with blood. Castiel was trapped in his seat, unable to move, and could only watch as the other man proudly displayed the dagger. Then Metatron's figure dissolved into smoke in front of Castiel, the dagger falling to the floor, his eyes firmly glued to it, and immediately afterwards, when he looked up, he saw Dean. A lifeless, cold Dean lying on the ground, the same Dean that Sam had seen that night. Castiel was still strapped to his seat, and Dean was lying two meters in front of him, not far from him, but just out of his reach. In the dream, his emotions were a monster, despair roaring in his heart, anger - at Metatron and also at his own impotence - licking him and burning him to the core. The worst of it all was always his remorse. Endless remorse, remorse for his folly, his gullibility, his arrogance and insignificance.
They moved impatiently. Perhaps because he had already experienced it the first time, even though Dean's movements were rougher this time, Castiel wasn't nearly as close to death as he had been last time. Each of Dean's thrusts was just right for him, and the itch that had been waiting all day was finally satisfied, even as Castiel took it upon himself to urge Dean to go faster, wanting to be fucked out of his mind by the demon, to forget his name. Dean's movement almost made him hit the car door, and in order not to really hit his head, Castiel had to put his hands against himself, he just felt like a bird rolled into the eye of a typhoon at this moment, even though his wings were shattered and broken, nature carried him for one last flight. He flew too high, too far, he spun and saw the snow-capped mountains and sunrise in the distance, then fell heavily and fell into a blood-red mass in the snow. His climax arrived unannounced, Dean did not have the slightest intention of cumming, Castiel was already curled up in a ball beneath him, skin glistening from sex, shivering and wrapping his arms around the man's neck. The thin lace panties were moist and clinging to Castiel's crotch, more uncomfortable than before, and he wished Dean could help take them off.
Now, Dean is huffing over the damn thing, trying to decipher why it won’t start. Everyone else, including El, the only person that could actually help him, is inside trying to keep Jack distracted while Dean preps the boat.
Jack’s obsession was pushed even further when their elderly neighbor had offered to take him fishing on his boat. From that moment on, boats became all the rage in the Winchester home. Books about boats moved in next to the lake books on Jack’s bookshelf, his cowboy themed bed sheets were swapped for a set adorned with tiny sailboats. Dean and Cas had to practically restrain him from pestering their neighbor for a boat ride everyday.
He can hear Rowena’s laughter filling the room before he even steps over the threshold. She’s standing to the side of the living room, deep in conversation with Jody and Donna. Jack is on the floor with Alex, talking animatedly while he secures one of her braids with a bright pink hair tie. Jack’s wearing a red cowboy hat with a t-shirt that says
Everyone files out the backdoor and into the yard behind the house. Dean and Cas each take one of Jack’s hands in their own, leading him toward the dock.
The boat won’t start, because that’s just Dean’s luck. His son is inside, celebrating his 4th birthday, and his surprise gift is malfunctioning right before the big reveal.
El laughs, adjusting his trucker cap and turning to face Dean with a serious look. “Boy, you think this boat not running would have ruined the day?”
El promises to keep watch of the boat while Dean jogs back up to the house. He pulls open the backdoor and immediately bumps into Kaia, who is looking at him guilty with her hands tight around Claire’s waist.
Ever since Dean, Cas, and Jack moved out of the bunker and into their cottage-style lake house, Jack had been obsessed with the water. He was enthralled by the lake, spending hours on the dock watching the fish swim by or dipping his feet in on warm days. Cas fueled his interest by purchasing every book and guide about lake-dwelling creatures and plants.
Jack stands there slack-jawed and in awe for a moment, clearly overwhelmed by the sight in front of him. “A boat?” He asks more than states.
Jack pulls away and places his small hands on the sides of Dean’s face before leaning in and pressing a sloppy kiss to his cheek. “I love you daddy.”
That’s how Dean found himself purchasing a repaired boat from some guy in southwest Minnesota. He had made the drive to pick up the boat a few weeks ago, it was relatively affordable, not a luxury speedboat or ridiculous pontoon, but perfect for about 6 people to climb on board for a day of fishing or relaxing on the water. Dean had made a plan with El, their elderly neighbor, to keep the boat stored in his garage until Jack’s birthday. El was happy to help, even took apart the motor to make sure everything was working and got it in the water that morning to surprise Jack.
Dean cocks his head to the side slightly, a mannerism he’s picked up from Cas after all these years. “Would have been a bummer if Jack’s surprise tanked.”
“Okay buddy,” Cas says once the three of them reach the rocky shoreline, the rest of their family gathered behind them. “You ready?”
Dean huffs a wet laugh, looking over Jack’s shoulder to see his family watching with eyes as shiny as his own.
“I love you more, Jack.” He says, smacking an equally sloppy kiss to his forehead. “Now, how ‘bout we take it for a spin?”
After they get Jack secured in his life vest, he takes his spot at the front of the boat, kneeling on the seat and leaning precariously over the edge to watch the boat carve through the water. Cas is seated next to him, one hand looped tightly in the back of his life vest, and Dean is at the wheel. The sun is setting over the horizon, reflecting off the lake and painting them in a picture-perfect orange glow.
Cas smiles excitedly as Dean sticks his hands under Jack’s armpits and pulls him to his feet. He reaches into his back pocket and retrieves a bandana that he begins to fasten over Jack’s eyes.
“Really? This is a birthday party for a 4 year old.” Dean attempts to scold, but there’s no real heat to it.
Cas is perched on the sofa, watching Jack and Alex with a fond look in his eyes. Dean slides his hand across Cas’ shoulders and bends down to plant a sweet kiss against his lips. “It’s go time.”
Jack looks back at Dean, his blonde hair curling slightly from the spray of the boat, his gap-toothed smile is wide and unapologetic. Cas is looking at him, too, affection and love spilling over every feature, his mouth turned up in a lopsided grin.
“Looks like you could use some help.” Says a gravelly voice Dean instantly recognizes as belonging to El.
“You coulda given that kid an old thing with a couple of paddles and he woulda been ecstatic.” El smiles, clapping his shoulder affectionately. “All he really wants is something to share with you.”
“Okay, I respect that. But just so you know….” he paused and looked Dean right in the eye, “If I am right and Angel is who I am pretty sure he is… well… I might not be gay but even I can admit that he’s attractive. I have had more than one girl friend admit that they think he has dreamy eyes.”
“Hold up…” Dean started but Sam cut him off. Cas tightened his fingers around Deans hand, stopping him from doing anything rash. Dean quickly dropped his hand and glared at him.
“Okay, Charlie, okay, you’ve made your point! I’m sorry. Next time this guy comes to town, I promise I will let you drag my ass out of bed at 6 in the morning.”
Dean knew that Cas was indifferent to sexual orientation and hell, it’s not like Cas didn’t take a few walks through Dean’s dreams before, so who knew what he had seen and when. But Dean hadn’t ever told him that stuff like the shit currently streaming on the TV was a huge turn on. But of course, Dean didn’t think he would have to verbally tell him that now either. A fucking hard-on spoke enough volumes on its own, and Cas was openly staring right at his.
Castiel let himself stare at the passing scenery, really looking at them, getting lost in them. The car's speed was slow, and Castiel missed his wings so much at the beginning of the journey. It was as if he could still feel them growing on his back at times, and there were times when he found himself standing on the side of the road, eyes closed, hoping in the breeze that his wings would take him where he wanted to go. He always opened his eyes in disappointment and frustration, feeling like a butterfly with its wings plucked off. The rest of him was just a caterpillar. The time he became human, so much pain, cold, hunger, a world so strange and terrible, and he couldn't even hide behind his own wings. He fell out of the cocoon that protected him and wondered why other humans could keep smiling under such difficult restrictions. But now he's coming to realize that perhaps the purpose of a human's life is not to be efficient. Ironically, where once he had a nearly infinite lifespan, now he is almost on the verge of death, instead it is the latter that allows him to understand how he should enjoy his life.
Castiel rolled over, and he lazily exposed his naked chest and stomach to Dean, who swept over the pretty curves very quickly and withdrew his wandering eyes. He looked innocently sexy in a way, his eyes gazing adoringly at Dean, "Don't go too long."
"Dean! " Castiel shouted, somewhat breathlessly. With that, his face was cupped and Dean's face was close enough to exchange breaths. He kissed him, an imprinted, dry kiss on the lips, it was long and gentle, involving no tongue and teeth, no exchange of bodily fluids. An almost reverent kiss.
"Other than staying away from your pet dog, what else is there that I need to know?" Crowley looked at him with a smirk, "If there's nothing else you want, does that mean you're willing to work with me on Hell matters starting tomorrow?"
They pulled over and Dean planned to go to the convenience store down the street to get something, Castiel was left in the car, looking away from the passenger side at Dean's figure. Suddenly, a grey shadow caught his attention: there was a public phone booth next to their car, it was within reach, and Dean couldn't get back for a while - he looked disturbed by a phone call, too, and whoever it was that was calling him - Castiel swallowed nervously, his palms heating up, knowing full well that this might be his only chance.
"It's hard to believe you remember the location of the steakhouse you ate at ten years ago, and you don't even remember what you did last week." Castiel turned the music down a bit and said to Dean somewhat derisively, trying to distract himself.
" You don't get to break the rules as you please, Cas." The brunette's ass was slapped, "Be a good boy."
"It's like a cat. Your hair is all messy and you're wagging your tail." The demon scratched Castiel's chin, "You're a very horny little pussy cat, aren't you?"
"You don't want me to recall just how many we spawned." Dean wailed in pain, "We've used up three stacks of naming books, I just hope it's not twins again this time."
Dean bit into one deep and light tooth mark after another on the back of Castiel's shoulder, "You know what? You're really going to turn out to be the death of me."
The demon raised an eyebrow as his broad palm rested on Castiel's belly, squeezing slightly harder as if to feel the sizeable cock in Castiel's stomach while forcing Castiel to feel his possession.
They stopped in the hotel lobby. In the dim light, the shadows made Dean's features look deeper and more shaded, his dark green eyes like a grey wolf. The King of Hell stood face to face with the demon, his body was considerably shorter than Dean's, and at the moment he could only look up at the other man, so he couldn't help but look underpowered, "So, what are you considering?"
The night was getting darker. With his shirt still open, Castiel felt a little cold and shrank in Dean's direction, but the demon clearly had other ideas as he picked Castiel up and tugged Castiel by the hips, heading in the direction of the small black car. Castiel fell into the back seat, and Dean removed his shoes and pants for him, tossing them casually somewhere inside the car. Impala's back seat was obviously not designed for two six-foot-tall adult men to have sex, but at the moment they couldn't care less, and Castiel's legs were actively and eagerly clamped around Dean's waist, while the cat's tail inside his ass was finally pulled out by Dean, as unaccounted for as his clothes, and the only fabric left on Castiel's body was the thong. The lack of filler left his body a little empty, and thankfully, Dean's little Dean soon took the place of the anal plug, easily pushing himself into the small hole that had been expanding all day.
"Are you used to talking about other people when you're in bed with someone?" He asked teasingly in return.
"Dean," the demon was extremely good at teasing and Castiel's breathing became disturbed in no time, "what do you want?"
"Don't be silly, this is what is written inside the ancient texts, of course there can't be a way of recording it other than on paper. In fact, I've already located it after double checking the comparisons and taking into account the changes in the continent over tens of thousands of years, I've finished setting up your route for you and booked the nearest hovercar, in theory you should be able to reach your destination without any problems, the rest of the work is up to you." No sooner had she said that and tossed her hair in a dashing fashion than my bracelet vibrated gently and a car rental notification popped up. "This paper map is just double insurance - you know, things always go wrong."
Dean looked up into Castiel's eyes. The corners of the angel's lips always had a smile on them, but this moment he was a slight frown, gazing at him with unusual seriousness. Since swallowing that special grace, Dean had a hard time understanding Castiel's thoughts; although he didn't fully understand before this either. Perhaps once Castiel was a bad-tempered panther; now he was nothing but a house cat, lying meekly and voluntarily on your lap, yet when you groomed him, a flicker of unexplained sadness seemed to pass through his narrowed eyes.
He walked up to Dean naked, wrapped his arms around Dean's waist, rested his chin on the man's shoulder and quickly kissed Dean's cheek, "I missed you."
Crowley was still cautiously sizing up the man across from him, that scrutinizing gaze that seemed like he was looking at something interesting, and Dean could almost hear the gears precisely turning in the other man's head, "And beyond that?"
"One more time?" He looked at Dean expectantly. Dean glanced at the clock; it was two o'clock in the middle of the night, but he thought that the little late-night store next door might still have freshly made lasagna. And he wanted a few pieces so badly right now - although Castiel was also a delicious dessert, it wouldn't satisfy his appetite, after all - that he shook his head, "Later. I'll go get something. Baby, what do you want to eat?"
"Look up, Cass." He heard Dean say that, and he patted Cas on the shoulder, and Castiel obediently looked up, his eyes gazing longingly above, and then, oh, he guessed he understood why Dean had wanted to bring him here.
Miraculously, Dean gradually stopped again. He became aware of the demon's hand gently caressing his back, some soft kisses landing on his shoulder blades again, the demon half straddling him, one hand holding Castiel's cock and skilfully stroking it. Instead of showing weakness in the cruel treatment, he squeezed out a sticky moan from the unexpected tenderness.
"Suit yourself. I don't care what you and your angel pet do in private, but what we agreed to in the first place wasn't for you to spend your days indulging, not answering my calls, eating some pizza and lasagna, sipping beer, and letting that TV older than you play soap operas all day." Crowley leaned in closer and he lowered his voice, "Think about it, Dean, a whole damn hell! A whole hell is ours, you have the Mark of Cain, the First Blade, and now with the help of that angel friend of yours -"
Castiel turned his head to look at Dean. The demon lying beside him looked even more beautiful than before, with a slight flush from the exertion of the sexual affair, his loose brown hair stuck to his forehead by sweat, and his pupils, dilated by desire, appeared deeper and deeper, shimmering ghostly. They were close together, the scent belonging to Dean wrapped reassuringly around Castiel's nostrils, and he almost drifted off to sleep quickly.
If you want to learn more about the dubious consent in this fic, you can take a look at the notes at the end of this chapter :)
"Miss me or miss my dick?" Dean teased. Castiel instantly pressed closer, his breath blowing on the outline of Dean's ear, his hand around Dean's waist tentatively moving down to stroke over little Dean, "I miss both. Maybe I miss it more."
Dean kicked away the hand that was in his way and walked straight to the bathroom. In the mist that twisted around him, he saw the empty glass bottle that lay on the sink - the bottle that had once held the glory of another angel. Now, not a drop of that stuff was not flowing through Castiel's body. Dean smiled at the idea, almost apologetic for his distrust when Crowley had proposed the plan: indeed, as the cunning demon had assured him, a small spell cast on the grace,  one hundred per cent worked, totally reliable. His private angel. His.
As Dean went to pick up his food, Castiel took the opportunity to glance at the payphone resting just a short distance away in the fast-food restaurant. He eyed it hesitantly for a long time, but he was equally aware that Dean was too close for him to be unseen. Just then, the demon waiting behind the counter next to the cashier suddenly turned back to Castiel and smiled, a cool chill of a secret plan caught creeping up on the latter's back.
"I'm giving you permission." That was all he had time to say before his cock gave a jerk and a stream of semen was injected into the belly of the man on top. He removed his hand, and in that instant, Castiel came, making a mess of the bed, but his dazed expression looked worse than the state of the sheets. He looked at Dean dumbfounded, as if the orgasm had burned out his sanity and he couldn't even assemble a complete sentence.
Cas felt Deans whole body tense up as he nearly bellowed, “oh fuck fuck fuck” and came all over his stomach, smearing Cas at the same time. It only took a few more quick thrusts for Cas to follow. Moving gently to Deans side, he tossed the condom in the trash by the bed and rolled on to his back next to him. Both of them were panting fiercely and covered in a sheen of sweat. “Jesus Christ.” Dean panted.
Dean surged forward, lips colliding with Cas’ as he poured all his pent up emotion out of him that has been building over the last several years. Pulling away, Cas leaned forward, gently laying his forehead against Dean’s. In barely more than a whisper Cas spoke, “You must know, I love you, and if you would have me, I will be with you until the end of the world, and then follow you around afterwards too.”
“Yeah. Apparently they weren’t expecting this big of a turn out today so they decided to hand out some tickets to the first people here in order for them to come back in a few hours to listen to Jimmy Novak read.”
The attention of most of the immediate crowd was on them. He felt his face redden as he tried to figure out what to say. “I… uh… that is… well… I… kind of… I think…” He was stammering. He hadn’t done that since the day he came out to his dad.
Today’s latest adventure wasn’t anything to write home about yet. They were in an incredibly long line just to get into a bookshop in the next town over. Charlie and Jo were a little obsessed with this book series, and apparently the author was going to be at this particular bookshop today to sign autographs and read an excerpt from his novel.
“What is it? What’s wrong?” Dean turned his chair to face Sam full on. “You’re making me nervous with that face. Last time you made that face you told me that you kicked that kid Franky in the shin in first grade and got in trouble, but were too scared to tell mom.”
The reaction in the auditorium was mixed. There were obvious people who were not impressed and angered by the display – thankfully they all elected to just stay quiet. There were wolf whistles and applause – clearly lead by Gabe and Sam, along with several of their classmates and friends. But there was also a bunch of laughter, like people thought it was just a joke. Which, Dean thought later, could have been worse - at least there were no yelled obscenities. With a quick last peck on Cas’ lips, Dean finally took the diploma from his hands, turned smiled at the crowd. Fuck them all if they didn’t like it. He was leaving soon and their opinions no longer matter, if they ever did.
“I don’t…Charlie…I don’t have a boyfriend. I know you are gay as hell. You went with Dean and Sam to Vegas and you met up with two of your friends from high school there didn’t you? That was Jo and…Ruby?” She just nodded her head yes as she shifted in her seat. “Ok then you are making absolutely zero sense to me and I am tired, I want to go home, so can you just be straight forward with me?”
It was with a lot of false bravado that Dean invited his hot new neighbor over to join him after catching his voyeuristic ass - but what if he didn't show?
And this is the end! Thank you all for reading! I enjoyed writing this one. I do have some ideas for future timestamps, so keep an eye out for those :)
Cas found Dean while he was in the kitchen, cleaning up from dinner. “I have found nothing of use in that last book.” He slumped into a seat as Dean finished rinsing a plate.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have been eavesdropping. To be fair though, you weren’t exactly having a conversation when I walked up.”
"Ok fine, you can pick his brain." Charlie took in a large breathe getting ready to launch into what Dean was sure was a million questions. He stopped her before she could start. "But perhaps you could quiz him another time? I think I have some of my own questions for him. Preferably to be answered alone."
Cas stumbled over his words as he tried to find the right thing to say. “I….I….know I shouldn’t have…what I mean to say is….I’m so sorry…I never…”
Dean lived with him. Moved in a little over a year before when he put an ad online about needing a roommate asap. His moving in was both a blessing and a curse. Blessing because Dean introduced Cas to a multitude of new people so his social circle, that was serious lacking before, was suddenly full. A curse because Cas fell head over heels in love with Dean within the first week of living together. He had thought he had managed to hide his crush pretty well, but now with this text from Charlie…she must have seen right through him.
Now, after living in his new dream home for a month, his world got flipped completely on its end. Cas put his book down, stretching lightly, realizing he was getting too old to stay in one position reading anymore. Switching off the lights he made his way over to the window, grabbing the curtain to pull them closed quickly and he briefly glanced across the way to Deans living room. He froze. There, playing clear as day was porn on Deans TV. His big, at least 50 inch, TV. And Dean….Dean was not only watching it – with his blinds still half open – but was apparently enjoying himself greatly while doing so. Cas sucked in an unsteady breath as he found himself pulling the curtains closed enough that he could hide behind them and still watch.
Really, Sam was just looking forward to being back home. They still hadn’t been able to figure out a way to get their mom back from the other world. And he knew Cas was starting to get antsy about Jack being stuck there as well. With the recent problems with Lucifer, even Sam felt like time was running out to get to them before he, or the alternative Michael, started causing serious problems. He wanted to get back and throw himself into research, hoping he could find something, anything to change this situation.
Cas huffed. “Who even watches porn on their TV anymore? Why not watch it on your phone or tablet in the privacy of your bedroom like the norm? Although I can agree that his tastes have been quite varied...” he mused, he had seen vanilla straight porn, girl on girl, dom and sub and a couple variations on threesomes and orgy scenes, “…none have been direct guy on guy and that doesn’t bode well for me. He is not gay and highly unlikely that he is bi either.”
For the next 45 minutes, the line slowly snaked forward. It seemed as though this author liked to have little chats with all of his readers. Dean was bored. He listened to all the varying conversations around him. Charlie and Jo seem to have found members in their Moondoor group that they hadn’t met yet and had stuck up a conversation with them. Dean played a game on his phone until his battery was at 20%, but he was getting impatient to get this over and done with. It’s not like he even had a book to have signed. He was literally along for the ride. Jo ended up giving him her phone to play a game on to keep him occupied until they were done. To be honest, it felt like he was a kid along for the day with his two mommies, and they were just placating him with their phones and the promise of a burger afterwards. At this point, he didn’t even care anymore. He just wanted to be done so he could go home and hope to see a light on at the condo across from him.
“No seriously, do you believe this shit, Sam?” Dean struggled against the invisible ties that bound his arms together. This was beginning to be too much now. “We’re hunters, we know how this ends. Just kill us and get it over with.”
He heard a whistle behind him as he entered his room and Dean followed. “Wow Cas…” A few years ago his parents finally budged and let him and Gabe paint their bedrooms. They had been bugging their parents to let them do that since they were little kids because the whole house was just several shades of beige and white with black accent pieces. Gabe always complained about how boring it was. So Gabe quickly painted his bedroom in a garish display of every bright color imaginable with no rhyme or reason. It took two days after he moved out before his mother painted it back to white. But Cas had painted the walls in his room like a sunset with it ending with his ceiling as a night sky. He had spent weeks on perfecting it, and Gabe was surprisingly helpful in making his room turn out so good. He helped him paint it too after school since his parents basically refused to help besides purchasing the paint. He hoped his mother wouldn’t paint over it because he was actually going to miss it. But he figured once everything came out, she would erase it much like she would him.
Cas dropped him off at home right after school so they could get ready for their graduation. Both had to quickly change into their formal clothes that they were required to wear under their robes and then get back to the school an hour before graduation was supposed to start. Cas also had the dreaded task off giving his valedictorian speech, which Dean knew he was nervous about. He had spent the last weekend with Charlie being the trial audience for Cas’ speech. It was really good.
Sam took a deep breath, rubbing his hands together trying to work up his nerve. “Soooo… I think I know who Angel is.”
“Oh god. This is the worst painting I’ve ever seen.” The attractive stranger just became a little less attractive in his eyes. Cas had liked all of this artists work, even including this one. It was different yet still within their style. It was nice to see this artist branching out and growing with their art.
Dean froze. He could suddenly hear the sound of his heart beating loudly in his ears. Angel. Sam knew who Angel was. “Howwww….?”
He felt like every nerve of his body was on fire, acutely aware of every breath, every shift, every atom, in the room.
Two nights later, Cas couldn’t sleep. It was one in the morning and he was sitting in front of his laptop hopelessly trying to get through this road block on his new novel. He couldn’t figure out how to transition out of this one scene and into the next. And although the next scene didn’t fit well in the overall layout of where he was in this book, he had to have it in there. There was just something about the way it flowed together, one paragraph that combined everything he wanted to tie up in the first half of his novel, which would then set up the second half perfectly.
Dean sat up, stunned to be hearing the words out of his mouth, not quite believing it. “But… that’s not… no, I’ve done too many things… made bad decisions...”
. “I remember you telling me about a certain fantasy of yours…” Cas quickly stowed his phone in his back pocket as Deans arms came sliding around his waist, pulling him tight against his hard body. “You. Me. This room. That bed. These lips of mine…” Dean was nibbling at his neck as he whispered these tantalizing words into his neck. It was making him weak and he was so very tempted to take him up on his offer. With everything going on lately, they hadn’t had a chance to get a moment alone for longer than a few minutes.
