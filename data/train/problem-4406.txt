After a moment, Izzy stood up carefully, minding not to scrape her chair across the floor. “So anyways, I better get back to work then.”
Ivy didn’t respond, instead grabbing for her sanitary bag and rushing into the bathroom. For a bathroom shared by 6 other housemates, it was blissfully empty for Ivy to speed through her morning routine, which was finished in 7 and a half minutes. Ivy looked at the time she spent and whistled out her approval before scampering back to her room (with style) to grab her water bottle and keys before dashing to the museum.
Now Izzy had already returned all of her attention back to the container of kettle corn on the table. Not looking back up, she said, “She always gives me the chills,” Ivy frowned a little, but the other girl continued, “not to be mean, but there’s something really peculiar about her. I heard she went through some nasty stuff when she was super young, but Dean adopted her right after that.”
“It was a house fire,” Dean said in a quiet voice. “Bad electrics, or a cheap nightlight in Sammy’s room. Something like that. I woke up coughing. Dad had Sammy in a blanket, he came out of nowhere and carried me like a football onto our front yard. Gave Sammy to me, told me to watch him, then turned to go back in the house to get Mom. Something caught, and there was a big fireball. Dad never made it back in … and Mom never made it out.”
She let go of Claire and walked away, and Claire felt numb, like she had once again screwed up and she wasn’t quite sure how.
He seemed to be in a great mood, driving along, the windows down and the tape deck blaring. Dean crooned along, his singing voice just as perfect as his driving, his metalwork abilities, his talent for drawing. Castiel was on his guard so that he didn’t pounce on Dean across the seat, ravishing the man who had only reluctantly agreed to a date. They were on their way to a creek that Dean knew, and Castiel hoped that Dean had packed swimming trunks for the both of them, or else they wouldn’t really be able to do it. But they could maybe talk with their ankles in the water, he supposed.
He spoke tenderly as he caught her chin in his hand, and tilted her face gently so they were looking into each other's eyes.
'Really? Pancakes?' Dax interrupted, eyes gleaming. He turned to Faith excitedly. 'Faith, real breakfast!'
“Is that the only reason you chose me?” Castiel teased him gently. “You thought I would be good at sex?”
“After the show.” Castiel confirmed. Dean made a noise of assent around his food. It surprised Castiel that Dean priced his work so low, he would happily pay fifty times the amount for the work. He didn’t want to insult Dean by mentioning that fact, however. And maybe Dean knew that he was worth more, but didn’t charge larger amounts out of some kind of integrity. Castiel was hoping that was more likely the case. He decided that it was now or never. Dean was pacified by his food, and this sculpture was as good as his. And his confidence in Dean’s presence couldn’t last forever, sooner or later it was going to get to him and he would embarrass himself horribly in front of the one person whose approval meant the most.
At the mention of Castiel, Cassidy's eyes flicked up with a hatred even Faith hadn't managed, her face almost warping as it twisted. Sam seemed oblivious to her marred features.
“But that’s the thing,” Claire turned to face him properly. He watched her with that tilt to his head that meant he was listening intently to even the words not said. “I don’t think I’ve made a big decision. I care about Alex, and she’s still my best friend, but I couldn’t cope with the physical stuff between me and her. That doesn’t mean you can’t touch Dean in front of me. It just means I’ve learned something about myself. I’m still good with hugs.”
“Cheeseburgers and no adults making out? You’re making a good sell.” Claire nodded. Castiel looked between them, just as the bell rang again and a few women walked in, chattering between themselves. The conversation stilted as the women settled into the cushy seats Castiel had in the centre of the store, and they realised that they couldn’t carry on. Castiel finally answered them, being careful of their new audience.
'God thinks you should be more of a dad.' She muttered it, hoping Gabriel didn't pick up on their conversation with his enhanced hearing.
Castiel hadn’t even thought about confronting Meg, but he knew that Michael was correct, it had to happen. He felt sick just contemplating it. What could they even say to each other? Would she accuse him of deserving it because he wasn’t physical with each other? It was certainly a possibility.
He kissed her forehead and got up from the sofa, walking downstairs and into the bookstore. She curled up under the blanket and stared ahead at the television screen. She knew she should check her cell, but she just couldn’t work up the courage to do it. She wasn’t ready for what Alex had to say, good or bad. Not yet.
The whispering increased, and the crowd broke up as Mr Singer limped through the crowd towards Claire, and Alex who remained at her side.
Is it too much to hope he’ll kiss me? Is it too much to hope that somehow protects us? I know he’ll protect us. He’s protected me since we met in Hell.
“It’s not going to get any easier,” Claire shrugged. “If you’re breaking up with me, can you do it like a band-aid?”
'Cas, Cas you bastard … where are you? Why aren't you here? Why don't you love me any more, Cas? Cas you son of a bitch, I need you, okay? I don't need you to save my ass or solve my problems, I need you because I need you. I need you Cas. I lost her, you dick, why'd I have to lose you too? Or are you just being a douchebag because I'm so fucking pathetic, huh? Is that it? You only liked me when I could be bothered to hunt? When I was just broken enough to function, right? What are you waiting for, you son of a bitch? Do you want me to kill myself, huh? Is she there? Is she dealt into this, too? Are you holding out on me? CAS YOU SON OF A FUCKING BITCH, ARE YOU HOLDING OUT ON ME?'
'Are you okay, kid?' Sam asked as Dax sucked in the air from the inhaler. Dax nodded, waiting for the air to kick in so he could reply. Sam and Krissy waited patiently for his breathing to slow down.
“Horses.” Dean corrected, and then he saw movement. A thick black blur on the edge of their valley, growing closer and closer. Coming from the north. He and Castiel seemed to realise together what it was.
He didn’t press it, and Castiel reappeared before long, taking the lounger next to the one they were sharing still.
'He's the best.' Faith decided. Gabriel snorted with laughter, which he fought to hide. 'Oh, shut up, Gabe.'
“She calls Dean and me pure-bloods as well.” Sam nodded at Eileen. “You’ll get used to us, don’t worry.”
“Oh, they still are. Apparently Dean had to look pissed off with you to save face and you gave him oral in his office before he sent you home.”
Jack laughed, and Claire smiled too. She didn’t know what Sam would talk about in his speech, but it couldn’t be that bad when they were both professionals. It would be Dean who was more likely to embarrass Sam than the other way around.
He looked around the room as the room began to get lighter in the early morning, making out the sketches that littered the walls, the few items that Dean owned that didn’t relate to artwork like an old leather journal, photographs of a small boy with a pretty blonde lady that Castiel realised was his mother.
“I know you’re ace and all, Claire, but love is love. If you find it, shouldn’t you protect it? It’s fragile. Look at your parents, they get it. And for what it’s worth? He’d rather be dancing with you right now. He looks at you the way you look at him.”
“Are you kidding? If you hadn’t in the bar, that first parent-principal meeting would have had him breaking up with that guy so he could have you.”
Dax’s delivery was all wrong. There was no caution in his hesitation. It was more like he was saying what he thought she would want to hear. The words were delivered in a monotone. Faith forced herself not to overreact. Obviously Dax was going to be pissy with her when they had spent the last few months apart.
“Gabriel’s keeping watch. Sam insisted Junior take the sofa, he and Garth are both on the floor. There doesn’t seem to be any sign of danger.”
“Well, that would explain a lot,” the guy between Dean and Castiel muttered, looking at Dean who half-ran down the last few steps. He seemed dazed as well, as if the prospect of what they were doing were just now taking its toll on him.
It had been a while since Dean had had anyone - definitely since Lydia had shown up one day and demanded that Dean take responsibility for the results of their one night stand and left Emma with him - and he had never really been fussed whether he hooked up with guys or girls before that.
“He keeps talking about marriage, about being a family. He and Claire have a routine for it. I just wanted one night to be sure it wasn’t going too fast, I didn’t want this.”
It was true enough. Dean had everything, he was the one doing the silent treatment. He didn’t get to play the victim the way he was trying to.
“Why do you think I’m going to leave you?” Dean asked eventually. Castiel frowned, not trusting the question. Surely Dean remembered?
They debated flavours until the waitress came back, taking their order and leaving a carafe of coffee on the table. Jack poured himself and Castiel a mug each, and they both sipped their coffee as Claire turned to watch people going by out of the window, half listening as her father and cousin started to discuss what they would be doing for the day. Castiel was dead set on the pottery painting, but after that, he wasn’t giving anything away.
'I'll call him, see if he'll come pick us up, that'll save some time, right? And that'll be good for Junior.' She made herself stand up and step away from the crowd, so she didn't have to look at Junior's motionless body any longer, and so she could have some privacy to make the call.
Dean fell quiet again, unsure how he even felt at this revelation. He had wrestled with his feelings for so long, for Castiel, for fatherhood, and then losing them both for so long, and now this? But getting angry at Castiel, yelling at him, causing an argument when they were finally back together … it all seemed so petty. And it would upset Faith, when she was finally happy despite being pregnant herself.
Edith wouldn’t have forgotten who nominated who. His interest was piqued though, because if she was asking, that meant she was hinting … had Dean won? Was Castiel responsible for changing his life?
Alex grabbed something out of her school bag, and Claire realised she had gone home first and brought half of her make up with her.
“They’re talking in their heads again,” Sam informed Becky as he caught his brother’s expression. “We’d better hurry it up.”
'I'm the rape child of a demon. I've spent my entire life in the care system. No one likes me at school, my grades suck, and when I can't keep my powers in, I get called a freak and punished for it. I'm sick of it. You're going to kill me anyway, what does it matter?'
“I’m a nephilim, having an angel baby despite still carrying my V card, my Mom is a guy and my Dad is a Hunter. My ex-boyfriend was a Man of Letters who invented some potion that guaranteed the next best thing to immortal life and the guy I like is a werewolf. I spent most of my life relying on the state and my Mom is currently hunting an old friend who, it turns out, is an antichrist. Do you really think I can’t deal with complicated? My whole life has been complicated. You try being eight years old and not cheating on tests by reading your teacher’s mind.”
'My name's Charlie. I don't know how much the hunting circle gossips about the old days, but two hunters sent me to Oz about twenty years ago. I loved those guys, especially when they helped me live out a dream, you know?'
“Um, so like Sam said, we had a deal where I did the rings and he gave a speech. But I think I want to say something about my dad and Dean, if that’s okay?”
“I need the break, Alex. Dean’s got me all set up for home school, and it’s going okay. It’s nothing to do with what happened at school, not really. But I lost my mom, Alex, and then I had to learn to be with my dad again, and then Dean, and all that junk, and Jack coming here. I wouldn’t get rid of any of it, but I just need some time to go a little slower. Time away from school drama will help.”
Dean sighed, and told Sam everything about Castiel, about the world he was in now. Sam’s eyes grew wide as he talked, and Dean knew he was trying to imagine Castiel, and Mount Olympus, and the other gods.
“Looks like it matters.” Dean pointed out. Castiel rolled over on the floor and opened his eyes to look at Dean. Dean who absolutely didn’t have to hear that Luke thought of him as irrelevant.
“Do we have to do Jägerbombs? I don’t want to wake up in the middle of the desert tomorrow with a buzzard picking out my insides.”
Castiel kissed her forehead, and disappeared into his bedroom. He returned a few minutes later with a large box, which he held the same way he held with his letters to Claire.
“I’d like that.” Mary spared her eldest son a smile, before eyeing Castiel apprehensively again. What was it he was meant to have done?
Castiel returned late in the evening, when all the posters had been made, and the girls had set up camp around the sofas and armchairs. Dean remained in the kitchen most of the night, texting on his phone and pretty much giving the girls their space. He came into the apartment alone, looking exhausted. Claire watched as Dean started to fuss over him, but Castiel held a hand up to stop him.
'Leave it, Faith.' Dean sounded like he was trying to mask the hurt she'd accidentally caused. 'I got it.'
Dean and the other soldiers eyed each other with dislike. He waited for them to agree with their captain, to leave, because he wasn’t going to be the first to back down. They didn’t either.
The whispering stopped, and Claire turned in her seat, seeking out her father, hoping he was okay with what Dean had just said. Castiel stood up, a few rows behind his daughter, his gaze focused on his boyfriend. Dean looked at him immediately, and Claire turned her head, back and forth, watching the two of them make those eye-sex gazes at each other.
'We could go talk in there, Dad's avoiding it still.' She whispered. Gabriel nodded, and walked in, stopping short of the doorway and turning to grin at Faith.
All too soon, it was time for Dean and Castiel to return to Olympus. They hugged Sam and Gabriel tightly, before Castiel placed a hand on Dean’s arm and used his powers to take them back to their grove. They laid down in their pavilion, Castiel opening up the conversation.
“Gabe? Who are you talking to?” Sam’s voice carried from the small house. And a moment later, “Dean?”
Castiel zoned out as his two eldest brothers began arguing again. And despite Luke’s joke, he couldn’t help his imagination running wild. What if he looked up Dean’s studio? What if he worked up the courage to go there, and finally speak to him, and ask him out? He had the time to practice what to say, Michael had given him just over a month to get it together. It was possible. And then he could find out where Benny fit in, whether Dean could be interested in him, what it would feel like to be pressed up against his firm chest, how those hard-working hands would feel tracing his skin …
“I did,” Dean confessed quietly. “Sometimes, when I looked at you, there was this … it was like a sweet breeze was passing through or something.”
Claire rubbed her eyes for far too long, wishing she could put this off. It was one thing to read herself in the book, but to explain it to someone like Alex who was so confident in herself? She couldn’t imagine scraping the words together.
'Okay,' Stevie exhaled noisily. 'You can stay. Rest up while you can, we're leaving early. And on the way, you can fill me in on everything you know about the Winchesters.'
Dax didn't know what to do. She had her wings out, it was hard to convince Stevie that it was some misunderstanding. But he knew the worst thing he could do would be to tell Stevie the truth. Some old, annoying loyalty to his girlfriend made him scramble for a realistic cover.
Castiel was in a major meltdown. He had no idea how he had ended up standing at an altar waiting for his bride, Lucifer beside him holding the rings. He’d been on autopilot since he’d been stopped from running after Dean.
“What I don’t understand, however,” Michael pressed. “Is why you stopped talking with Dean, why you agreed to marry Meg?”
“Thanks, fake dad,” Claire whisper-shouted. They grinned at each other, and Castiel reached out for his daughter. She left the seat beside Chuck to tuck into her father’s arm, and tried to shut out the crowd. Dean patted her arm, and looked between Michael and Chuck.
Dean kissed his temple, and Castiel took a measured risk, turning the pages of the notebook. Dean didn’t stop him, watching the fire as Castiel took his time looking through the pictures. After that first image of Castiel, he found several more; in a tuxedo, their hands woven together, Castiel laughing, Castiel looking away into the distance with a somewhat dreamy expression. And then a picture of them kissing, Dean’s hands inside his pants. He gasped, realising that Balthazar had been correct. And pretty reserved in his explanation, because the pictures started to get more and more graphic. There were hand jobs, blow jobs, anal sex in different positions, all interspersed with pictures of tyre treads, or moments Castiel remembered from their dates … he put the sketchbook onto the bench gently, then grabbed the front of Dean’s shirt and pulled him into a frantic kiss, where they stayed until an acrid smell filled the air, and Dean untangled himself to save their meal. As they began to eat, Castiel resumed the conversation from the sitting.
Castiel continued staring at Dean's firm chest, his muscular arms. It was easier than meeting his eyes, easier than letting himself think all the things he wanted to think that he didn't want Dean reacting to. He pictured himself tucked in Dean's embrace, safely surrounded by those arms, fully loved by the man he adored. Dean chuckled.
“And you’re wrong too. I don’t love synchronised robot dancing and yelling bad rhymes. I liked cheerleading because it was the first time in ages that I fit somewhere. But I fit somewhere better now.”
“It’s quiet without all the birds.” Sam mused, and poured himself some cereal, with one of the pints of milk. “Want some omelette?” He gestured to the eggs.
Claire wanted to run. She didn’t want to stick around to hear her father go on and on about how awful she was, or suggest she have frequent school counsellor sessions - barf - and she definitely didn’t want to see them continually undress each other with their eyes - again, barf - but leaving would mean that they would probably get more candid without her to buffer them.
Castiel looked thoughtfully up at the tree by the front door, surrounded by French hens, turtle doves, calling birds and a partridge. Dean snorted softly.
Dean nodded, and slowly told his story, beginning with Michael. He got to the siege, and Sam interrupted.
“I like Charlie,” Michael interrupted. “She helped me figure out a lot of what’s gone on with Luke. She’s very bright.”
'Well, you know, Cassie becomes God's favourite angel, gets to rule Heaven for Daddio, he gets to pull certain strings. Like mine. And the only trade off is keeping these two out of the trouble they constantly find themselves in.'
All the soldiers lifted their spears and roared in response, then followed the chariots that led the way. The marched with perfect synchronicity, though they weren’t silent. Someone started singing an old song based on the Iliad, of Agememnon and Menelaus, the dispute with Achilles, and the fall of Hector. When they came to the part about Patroclus sacrificing himself for Achilles, everyone joined in, even Dean and Castiel. It was perhaps unsurprising that they would all identify with that part of the epic story, of putting their own lives on the line for the man they were closest to.
“Actually, some other twins I went to high school with. But not the point. No more questions about my dad’s novels, no asking him about his novels, no telling him your mom watches the movie adaptations alone in her room when she thinks you’re all asleep and can’t hear the vibrator.”
“Don’t let those other soldiers get to you. I’m sure Sam and his erastes had their reasons for running away.”
'What would you do, Dax, if I said those stories were true? Based on cases my brother and I worked on?'
'Michigan,' they answered together. Dean sighed. Maybe not then, Michigan was hardly around the corner.
“Can you please talk to your boyfriend about this? Because I can’t keep taking birds to the sanctuary. And by day twelve, do you know how many birds there’s going to be in here? Christmas Day with one hundred and sixty-four birds!”
“That’s nothing like it,” Dean chuckled. He still seemed to be in a good mood, and Castiel wanted to keep that going. He figured that, maybe if they carried on getting to know each other better, he might stand more of a chance at getting back in Dean’s good books.
“Whatever.” She dropped her hand and pulled her bag strap further up her arm. “I have to get to class.”
“Like intuition?” Becky asked as a hand drifted down to her stomach. Sam carried on putting away groceries.
'And Cassandra is?' Faith turned to Dean, glad the moment she might have to choke out an apology had passed.
“Admittedly, it’s harder now when we’re able to share thoughts, but you’re right, we do. Dean doesn’t know I was coming here.”
She knew Castiel was seeing Dean that night. Beyond overhearing their phone call, Castiel had told her when she got home from school on Monday, trying to prepare her for a night alone. He had suggested asking Charlie to stick around and Claire’s bad mood returned. Just because she needed a babysitter the last time he had seen her didn’t mean she did now. The idea of being babysat at fifteen, almost sixteen, was humiliating just on its own. So she had low expectations for whoever was at the door.
'You have no idea, Dean.' Sam said back over his shoulder, before focusing back on Dax. 'You're lucky you're not strung up already.'
They had stopped in the middle of the street, staring at each other. Castiel felt uncomfortable around Meg for the first time ever. She had never liked his partners, but she had never made him feel six inches tall about any of them. With Fergus she was adamant he was worth more, with April she told him over and over he was being used and he needed to open his eyes, but asking what he could give a potential partner? That was a new low.
Dean wasn’t annoyed with Benny, or angry at the lack of fighting, despite what they communicated in public. And Benny wasn’t as disproving of him. They had realised some years before, when Dean was inducted into the band and claimed by Benny that praise made him fumble. Likewise, Dean admiring Benny out loud left the older man flustered and ruined his concentration. Some of the other couples worked well with praise, Dean and Benny worked best by pushing each other’s buttons and striving to do even better.
“I promise not to make any advances, I promise that there will be highly influential people there who would pay for your artwork. Even if they would use terms like ‘a commentary of our times’. I just … I have the feeling you won’t allow me to get stressed while I’m there. I like your sense of humour.”
“I was saying,” Michael repeated smoothly. “You have to start coming to more functions. You’re a Novak, you have to make more of an effort. I’m putting my foot down, Castiel. Upon my return from my conference in Seattle, you’re attending like every other member of this family.”
He stood up and grabbed Castiel's hand roughly, ignoring the snigger that erupted from Gabriel as he marched with Castiel through the bunker, looking for any sign of Faith. They eventually found her curled up under Dean's blankets, fast asleep, cuddling his pillow tightly. They looked at each other, silently communicating whether or not they should wake her up and throw more issues her way.
She felt the bed dip where Castiel perched on the edge of the mattress. He rubbed her shoulder gently.
Castiel felt nauseated. They were around their dining table, dinner in front of them. Despite the pomp of the room, and the fact that they had employees attending to their every whim, the food was relatively understated. He still couldn’t bring himself to eat, not in the face of what Michael was saying to him.
“Fine. You can sleep in my bed tonight, and tomorrow you’ll take me on a freebie date. And I’ll decide after that.”
They walked together when it was their turn, approaching the elder who was binding them in front of the statue of Dionysus, their hands still gripping tight. They faced each other, and Dean felt that sensation again. That a soft breeze was passing by, with a honey-sweet scent lingering. Castiel’s unusual eyes were wide open, his expression serious, and there was a burning sensation in Dean’s chest. He wondered if his new beloved was experiencing the same thing in the brief moment where everything else seemed to have stopped.
“There’s no one else around here who’s remotely gay. If there’s any girls up there, give them my picture, okay?”
It didn’t make Claire feel any less nauseated. Everything Castiel had said had been true, her mother had kept them apart. And Amelia had lied. She had been so horrible to Castiel when she moved in with him, not understanding just what he’d put up with, what he’d tried to protect her from. She put the letters back in the box and wandered towards the store. She stopped when she heard voices and ducked into a small alcove.
“That was on Dad’s watch,” Dean pointed out. Bobby levelled him with a glare. “You know what I mean.”
“Can you believe Mr Winchester lives in a place like this?” Alex gestured behind her. Claire didn’t want to make stupid small talk.
“I do,” Alex grinned. “And I want to stay your girlfriend, so if we take our time we take our time. If it never happens then that’s okay. But I am going to have to sort myself out after kisses like that.”
The game ended, with their high school team narrowly winning the game. Several players ran off the pitch and straight into the arms of their cheerleader girlfriends. A few other girls drifted into the crowds, and Claire watched as Alex stepped back from the fray, clutching her elbow with one hand and watching the team celebrate. She looked to her dad, and Dean, who both seemed to understand what she was thinking, and stepped back to allow her out of the row, getting suckered into a conversation with some students behind them about some of the plays. And Claire walked self-consciously down the bleachers, feeling like she was having another out of body experience. The steps down seemed further away than normal and Claire had to make some deliberate steps to stop herself from tumbling. She reached the railings that separated the crowds from the players, and leaned across. Alex was maybe six feet in front of her. She made herself take a measured breath, and then spoke clearly.
“Hey,” she mouthed at him as she reached the altar. Castiel couldn’t react, could barely move. She reached over and grabbed his hand, that smug look all over her face. But there was no comfort from her touch, not when the ghost of Dean’s hand was still on the back of his neck, the memory of his lips still tracing Castiel’s. How was he even going to get through this?
he had informed Castiel smugly after smiting the moment they made contact with the demon. It had been posing as a postal worker, and hadn’t had the chance to do much more than stare in horror at Dean’s new angelic visage before Dean’s hand was on its forehead, and the demon got roasted.
“Cassie! You didn’t get lost in the desert then?” The man came over and bounced on the foot of the bed.
Claire climbed back in under the covers, and Alex took her mug of coffee from her, sipping it and wincing.
“Castiel, I’ve been looking at your recent transactions, and I’m disturbed.” His accountant said the moment he sat down, after the pleasantries were exchanged. “You’ve always been so prudent with your money, and this recent splurging and transferring cash was already out of character. So I dug a little and,” he didn’t finish the sentence, but passed a wad of papers across his desk. Castiel peered at it, and then froze. He had spent out for the wedding, and obviously for Dean, but that would have made a small dent in his fortune. The numbers at the bottom of the paperwork his account was giving him was different. Millions had been spent, even more transferred to several ambiguous shell companies he had never heard of. He dropped the cluster of documents, feeling nauseated. He had never seen so few numbers associated with his name. He couldn’t see anything else, and the numbers were all blurring together and he couldn’t breath and he wasn’t sure where all the light in the room was going and-
Jack had asked her if she was sure, if she wasn’t selling herself short at fifteen, and she had tried to explain it to him the best she could.
“Uh-huh.” Alex pulled her hair back from her face, and Claire watched in fascination before making herself focus. “So what were you being an asshole about?”
He hung up, and Claire turned back to sorting through her clothes. Castiel didn’t come into her room however, not until she had crawled into bed and was heading off to sleep.
She looked up at him, and her eyes seemed to glow an eerie blue. Sam looked at Castiel apprehensively, worried what it might mean, but Castiel was hardly paying attention. He looked as though he was listening intently to something.
“I’m awake,” he grunted. There was movement, the bedsprings creaking as the mattress shifted, the covers tugging as Castiel got into the bed. “How’s everything out there?”
"Already seen it, Gabe," Dean joined them. He looked down at Faith with a neutral expression. "Is he feeling any better? Because we should head off as soon as we can."
Kaia and Alex swapped a meaningful look. Claire wasn’t sure what it was about, and she was desperate for a subject change. She didn’t get the chance to try for one, because her friends were on fire as they set up the sleepover.
She had no choice but to follow Dean to her own bedroom. He shut the door softly after them, and she settled on her bed. He pulled her desk chair out, and sat on it backwards, folding his arm across the back of the chair.
“I guess I am. I mean, I was never interested in dating or whatever. Mom used to take me to loads of classes, and I never wanted to miss out to hang out with boys. And then she got sick and I just wanted to be with her in my free time, you know? And then I got here and that first school sucked, and you sucked, and then I moved schools again and it got better. But I didn’t want a date at all.”
The difficulty with that thought was, Faith knew, that by having this baby, going through with the birth, she was already promised to the angels. And she hadn't had the choice.
“Well, there you go. My fiancé wants me here. So you can either say what you want to say or you can run along.”
“Come on, you can’t be late for my little girl. Luke!” He signalled to Castiel’s brother, who had appeared in the hall in front of them. “Can you help Castiel finish getting ready? I need to get back to Meg.”
Dax was still feeling out of sorts about the whole Faith-found-her-parents situation. As much as he wanted to be supportive of his girlfriend, he felt an increasing chasm between them. She had turned to her parents over him for comfort, her guy-mom seemed to know what was bothering her without needing to have it spelled out, and no one seemed to think he needed to know anything. At least, he reflected as he walked into the meeting room and over to a bookcase, Faith had asked for him. She was still trying to talk to him, and she was still sort-of listening to him. He took a couple of books from the shelves, and sank into a comfortable seat in a well hidden nook, flipping through the pages slowly, trying to take in the words so he didn't have to dwell on the huge changes going on in their lives. He found himself reading about Chupacabra, which he had never heard of before.
'For you, maybe. And Dean and I, we'll do anything to make it easier for you, as much as we can. But I promise you, Faith, we're your parents.'
Castiel drifted to the empty spot beside Dean, who took his hand silently. Claire watched, and wondered if anyone would comment. But apparently, Castiel calling Dean ‘the guy’ was enough explanation for everyone.
Dean nodded, biting his smile back once more, and Claire ran down the stairs, and into the bookstore. Castiel was just serving a coffee to a customer clutching their new purchase, and Claire slid behind the till. She caught her father’s eye and once the customer was settled in the seating area to read their new book, he came up to her.
“Unless you make them afterwards,” Castiel pointed out, gesturing to one of the sketches he had seen that first day in the studio. “You’re incredibly talented, Dean.”
“But surely you can understand that, to the both of us, it looks exactly like you’re isolating Claire to continue punishing her?”
“Whoa there. Come on, up you get.” Dean pulled him upright, and secured an arm around his waist. “So … Castiel?”
“Uh, yeah. He moved into Becky’s house when they got married.” Dean shrugged one shoulder, as Mary continued to look at Castiel, who was still being inundated with images of himself with Dean in various positions. How long had Gabriel been watching them? “We’ll go visit them soon.”
“Well, if you were paying attention in class, Mr Singer assigned us as partners. And I didn’t see you the rest of school, and you weren’t at cheer practice, and someone said you lived at this bookstore. So, we can watch this episode and get to work on our assignment.”
'Yeah, somewhere, I'll dig them out.' Dean said stiffly. Castiel slowly approached Faith, standing behind her and looking down at her. She felt his eyes burning into the back of her head, and turned around to glare at him, forcing herself not to wince as her wings flexed during the motion.
“Everything’s fine,” The guy beside Claire grinned, putting his arms around her and Patience. Patience held her hands up in protest and Claire shoved him off.
“Castiel,” Emmanuel sounded more serious than usual, if that were even possible. “What’s going to happen with Dean?”
Dean chuckled, and loosened his grip. Castiel wanted to protest, but then Dean was pressing kisses against his neck and his cheek. He turned his head and met Dean’s lips with his own, sinking into them and sinking further into his arms.
Their general began making a speech, one Dean had heard several times in the past few years, and it was as this speech continued that he realised what was happening. Benny’s service in the army was over, he was leaving him.
“I didn’t do anything!” Her latest cushion caught a lamp, which fell to the floor with the sound of glass breaking.
“Uh, sure. Um,” she took a deep breath in, and tried to steel herself. “My mom died, it’s how I live with my dad now. How I ended up at this school. And Mr Winchester has been pretty cool talking about it, because he lost his mom young too. He gave me a ride to school one time to make sure I was okay, because my dad was working and they’re friends. I wanted to say thank you but I couldn’t say it without sounding like a dork so I hugged him. That’s what started all this stupid stuff, someone saw that hug and thought it meant something it didn’t.”
“Look, if we go out, we take it slowly, okay? I need to get my head around it. But there’s no one else I would want to date.”
He pulled his boxer briefs and undershirt back on, and left the bathroom, just wanting to sleep for a hundred years, but there was one complication that he had forgotten in his inner turmoil. Meg.
“He didn’t mean right this second,” she stopped Kevin from standing up. “Eat, we’ll hang out for a bit. I would personally give you the day off and arrange to meet back at the house afterwards, but I’m not a dick.”
Dean’s vulnerability was glaringly obvious at that moment, and Castiel hated that he’d done that to the man he loved.
Castiel wasn’t sure how to answer that. He had forgotten that Dean had neither seen his true form nor heard his true voice. But Dean could hear him thinking, as though the blood connection that Gabriel had forged had rendered a connection that left nowhere to hide.
“What happened, Claire? Do you not want to do this? You don’t have to go out with me to spare my feelings, you know.”
“How’s it going?” Edith sidled up to him, looking glamorous in a svelte black dress that belied her age. She knew that Castiel hated being singled out as a Novak, and did her best not to use his name in front of other people. It was part of the reason he respected her so much.
Faith sat at a picnic table, two carry out coffee cups in front of her, the steam curling out of the small vents in the lids. She had been there for a few minutes, arriving early to make sure everyone else could hide. They were all out of sight, and Faith had to hope that they would be well hidden from Stevie. Gabriel was using his powers to try to mask them all, but if Stevie became aware of them too early, then the plan was going to fail.
She nodded, and he caressed her cheek until he could hold her chin gently between two pinched fingers.
Faith knew Castiel could hear all her doubts and her distaste as she reacted, but he pushed on anyway. Eventually though, she pulled away, hugging the cushion tightly and scowling at the floor.
“Yes, and I knew it was an accident. And I know you lost Amelia. But you still have a parent who is alive and trying to reach out to you Claire. I have missed you more than you know, and I’ve tried harder to be your dad than you can imagine. This is something I’m putting my foot down on. We’re spending time together.”
“Dean, Dean, Dean. You know I’m practically God right now, surely?” Gabriel turned his attention to Castiel, his expression slightly more tender. “What’s wrong, Cassie? Now you don’t have to do all that boring plant research you were begrudging earlier. You can snap your fingers, and your dress will fit perfectly.”
She took her time walking into school, as Dean hurried off for an early morning meeting, and walked by Alex’s locker. Her girlfriend was already there, putting her books away. Claire leaned against the locker bank casually.
“You do look like Amelia, but that’s not a bad thing. She was a beautiful woman.” He gave her a squeeze. “I knew I was a lucky man when I was with her.”
When Claire walked back into the house, she could see her fathers and Jack sitting in the front room waiting for her, all three of them twisted on the sofa where they’d been watching from the window. She felt wrung out and drained from the break up, and thankfully no one wanted to rehash it. Castiel held his arms out for her, and she crossed the room and cuddled into him, letting him pull her onto her lap like when she was a little girl. Dean and Jack cuddled into them, so her entire hodge-podge family were in a big ball of affection.
Castiel knew she was just trying to protect him, to defend him from heartbreak, but it still hurt. She knew it was Dean, she knew how Castiel felt, she knew this was Dean’s show too. Antonia interrupted, clearly wanting the attention back on herself.
Lucifer wasn’t done, of course. He was the one to encourage Castiel to go out and meet a guy and stop stalking Dean. Dating Dean wasn’t stalking him, was it? And yet, Lucifer didn’t appear appeased in the slightest as he continued his digs, giving Dean a very obvious look up-and-down. Twice.
She dashed back into her bedroom, and threw herself on the bed, leaning against the wall. Alex settled next to her.
There was no mistaking the chill in the atmosphere after Claire’s words, and her grandmother spoke in clipped tones.
Cas led the way into the main function room, where they ran into Lucifer almost straight away. Lucifer was already annoyed that Castiel had overridden him on Kevin’s appointment, and sided with Michael over hiring new drivers, and it was evident in the snarky tone he adopted.
Claire took a deep breath in through her nose, enjoying the way it barely hurt now. Her mask had just come off, and her skin felt oddly doughy, and had a weird smell to it that she was intending to wash off when she got the chance.
"Me too," Junior whispered, as Faith moved closer, and kissed him this time. She felt a surge of lust shoot through her as they made contact, something that had never happened with Dax, and she sprang away once again.
'I meant me, and Dax. Not you, and Mom, and uncle Sam. And even Garth and Junior aren't so bad. I guess I just … Daddy, I need Dax back.'
“Um, no, Kaia’s got a point. Sharing a bed might be a bit much for me. Your dress is done.” Alex stepped away, and Claire nodded to the bed her father had slept in the night before, since she had slept more in that bed than the other. Kaia jumped on it, as Claire retrieved her own pyjamas, and Alex headed to the bed Patience perched on. Once Claire changed, Kaia started taking her hair out of the elaborate updo that she had put in that morning. Claire sat as still as possible, wiping off her make up.
“Good,” Castiel swallowed loudly. “Dean’s comic book idea has brought in a lot of new customers. He’s got a few more ideas too, things I never considered. And speaking of Dean, I wanted to talk to you both.”
“I don’t know. But what I do know is that everyone in our little group of misfits understands how important this baby is. We’ll all do our best to help you, to protect you both, and to kill Stevie, okay?”
Dax's face turned pale, and he buried the book in the small slot in the driver's side door before coughing slightly.
He peeled himself off Dean slowly, and Dean ran as soon as they came unstuck, heading up to the bathroom before him.
Claire looked at Jack as her father called that out, expecting a peck on the cheek, but no, Jack kissed her earnestly, and she kissed back as her dads cheered them on. Then everything seemed to melt away, and it was just Claire and Jack, in a tux and a white dress, kissing in the middle of a garden with no one else around, Jack pulling her closer, Claire kissing him deeper.
“Yes, she is. She’s the one who put her feelings out there, and realised that maybe she read the situation wrong. I suppose she’s second-guessing everything the two of you say to each other. Give it time. You might work out how you feel too.”
'This isn't going to be like you forcing my wings out, is it?' She stepped back slowly. 'Because I sure as hell won't let you touch me if it is.'
“You’re the erastes, you’re meant to be inside me,” Castiel spoke softly. Dean turned his head and grinned.
“I mean, there’d be some ground rules. Absolutely, on no account, will you smite the sex God ruling Heaven,” Gabriel pointed to himself. “I realise that there might be a teensy bit of tension there which in your world translates to revenge, but we’ll make this a contract of sorts.”
“I mean, I did wonder why you were asking about that stupid rumour when I thought you knew … is that what’s bugging you?”
'And how many angels would be covering your tracks?' Sam's voice was low, challenging, and Faith stormed the length of the room, jerking the door open and stomping out. Dax watched her go, then sank in her seat.
Claire didn’t need to open her eyes to know what the expression was on Castiel’s face. That doey-eyed, head cocked, pouty mouthed expression that meant Dean had hit right in the heart. However long the argument had gone on for before Claire woke up, it was now over. The lip smacking sound signalling their kiss that followed a moment later confirmed it.
'I get it, kid. You know, your mom's going to have to leave soon, sort out those anti-christ kids. Think you know one of them, Stevie?'
She made herself smile at her father, though it slid off her face as soon as he closed the door behind him. A whole day of just Jack and Castiel was going to be torture. But she couldn’t refuse to go, it was going to make her dad so happy, and Dean had already left on his bachelor’s. She shrugged into her jeans and a tee, and jogged down the stairs for breakfast. Castiel was already dressed, and clearly in Dean’s clothes because Claire was pretty sure her father still didn’t own a pair of jeans. He smiled at her as she started to put her sneakers on.
Adam sketched a small wave, and then went back to the porch of the house. He was almost immediately replaced by Ben.
'I'll bet. Dax, it'll be fine, stop worrying. I know you're used to it just being the two of you, but now you've got a lot of resources behind you. You're not alone. Isn't that a good thing?'
It was disorienting, waking up with someone in your bed when you weren’t used to it. And yet, Claire had been aware of Alex on some level all night, sleeping lightly and not moving as much as normal. She was still tired when she woke up, and slipped out of bed, leaving Alex still dozing.
After a few hours of studying and listening to music, she felt a hand on her shoulder and jumped in her seat, turning and finding her father standing there, holding out a take out bag. She removed her headphones.
Faith nodded slowly, and moved forward clumsily, trying to balance the tea and work around the bump to get closer to Junior. He watched, his hazel eyes wide open, clearly curious about this change of mood, and she pressed closer, kissing him gently on the mouth again. It didn’t last long, neither of them wanting to break what there was between them, but it was enough. As Faith settled back against the headboard, Junior smiled at her shyly.
“Great.” Alex looked away from her phone for a moment, and then looked back. “I have to go, Jody needs some help with some kids that turned up last night. Enjoy Pontiac!”
Castiel was clearly very averse. “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea, Dean.” His body language was closed off and uneasy.
I tipped my head back against the pillow I was propped up on with a frustrated exhale. A single tear slipped down my cheek. I was so goddamn sick of the tears. I couldn’t believe I had any left at this point. I squeezed my eyes shut, wiped away the moisture, then just stared at the ceiling. The view from my window wasn’t too bad. It overlooked a park that was quite lovely. But right now, “quite lovely” didn’t exactly appeal.
Dean was getting hard already. Dean didn’t know what this would entail, exactly, but he knew Castiel. He had a curious mind, and patience to rival a saint. Whatever Cas was thinking, it would probably be nothing short of blissful.
Dean nodded. “Five-thirty. Great! Awesome. Yeah…” He rambled on as he backed away toward his disappearing group.
“Uh, not really, I was just saying it was probably telepathic signals with the, you know, antennae.”
“Yes, I know. But I have little confidence in this area, and I will, as you say, “puss out” if I get discouraged. Besides, the idea of having Dean Winchester speechless...well. Let's just say I have my fantasies too.”
Dean smiled to himself. He wasn’t actually bemoaning his loyal clientele. He actually couldn’t be happier about it. It did get tedious sometimes, especially on busy weeks like this one. His last client today would be someone he had never met though, so that might be interesting. It was too bad he didn’t have more energy to enjoy it.
I remember tears filling my eyes and yelling. I remember anger and frustration and hopelessness. It was too much, too quickly. It was crushing down on me like an avalanche that just wouldn’t stop. Nurses and orderlies tried to help Dr. Sweet contain my outburst. After a while, I wore myself out. The staff left and I fell asleep.
The question was both a shock and totally expected. How could I not notice the way he had been looking at me? Ogling, really. I didn’t actually expect him to act on it though. I didn’t see any harm in accepting. He was attractive and seemed nice. He had to be a good guy if he was chaperoning kids in his free time. That or a pedophile. Okay, that’s not funny.
“It’s not like I can tattle on you without mom and dad around. Besides, I’d never play a prank on you now!”
I read somewhere that your heart uses enough energy in your life time to fuel a semi-truck twice the distance the earth is from the moon. Maybe that’s where that expression comes from: I love you to the moon and back. It’s as if it means you literally love a person with every beat of your heart for your whole life, from the day you were born.
Cas sucked a wet, desperate kiss below Dean’s ear, then lifted himself back up to speak filth into Dean’s ear again, while one hand roamed the expanse of Dean’s chest and everywhere he could reach.
Abandoning Dean’s arms, for now, Cas moved on to his torso, where he used his palms just to feel the expanse of his chest. Dean sighed with contentment. It was like getting a very strange massage. It was less pressure, and more petting.
How is this okay?!” I waved at my legs furiously. “I may never walk again! I’m barely twenty and my life is
Dean put his full attention on Castiel’s comfort. He hardly gave a thought to which places might elicit belly laughs or sweet giggles. It was a passing thought he couldn’t help, but with the contented smile on Castiel’s lips, it was easy enough to put all that aside. Dean was happy with this, and so the massage was a total success. When he was finished, Castiel practically looked like he was high.
Because they were close friends, Dean turned his back and began cleaning up for Castiel’s appointment while Meg changed behind him.
Don't get used to updates this fast! I'm not that speedy. But I had some backlogged, and was excited to release the next chapter. See you all again soon!
The subtle change in Castiel’s expression told Dean his intimidation worked. Dean greedily enjoyed the sight of Castiel stretching.
The audience of about fifteen second-graders looked to each other ponderously or just stared back at me with expectation. One girl raised her hand and tentatively answered “Don’t they buzz at each other?”
“I love feeling your laughter against my lips, under my palms. I could soak it up all day, like beautiful sunlight. Your smile is so beautiful, you know that?”
“Hey, it’s the release year of Zeppelin’s first album. Plus it’s clearly the sexiest number. I thought you were an old-ass angel who wouldn’t get the reference.”
If that wasn’t a compliment, Dean didn’t know what was. “Come as often as you like. You’re fun to work with.”
Gabriel stayed with me for the rest of the day. I complained, but deep down I was glad he was there. He convinced me to call our parents before I went to bed. There were too many tears on both ends for my taste, but they promised to come and visit as soon as they could catch a flight. The next morning Gabriel started talking about the logistics of my condition. I had an incomplete spinal cord injury at the L1-L2 level, which is basically just above the highest point of my pelvis, according to Dr. Sweet. The good news was that I’d still have control of my core for the most part. It would make getting around a million times better than if I didn’t have that control. The bad news was… well a lot of things, but probably the grossest was the incontinence.
True to form, Castiel had Dean cracking up in the first few minutes. He seems scandalized that someone would ask for Dean’s hand in marriage because he is a talented masseur. Then, the bashful way he couldn’t quite admit that he came back just because he wanted to was adorable. And flattering. On top of that, Castiel’s willingness to try new things was just what he was hoping for. He didn’t know Castiel well yet, but it seemed out of character for him to embrace change. It made Dean feel excited and special, even if he was just misreading.
“Awesome. What are your thoughts on the clothes? I can do it with clothes on if you like. I’ll wash my hands really well, I promise.”
Not five minutes into the massage, Dean was noticing Castiel’s softer muscle tone; probably a result of his office job. He could feel the easy give of his muscle under the stone. But he wasn’t fat– not in the slightest. In fact, he seemed a little thin for his height. He began to wonder if Castiel was eating well. Did he not have time to exercise, or was it not really his thing? Was he too busy at work to worry about his health? That would not be good.
“Ah. Hah, that’s good. I enjoyed your presentation. You really know how to talk to the kids. Not down to them.”
“Okay, take the robe off your shoulders so I can get to your back and lay on your front, please.” Amazingly, his voice sounded totally under control. Point to Winchester.
Castiel was sitting there, ready to go, and Dean got that same excited thrill as the first time he saw him.
“I love your smell. Sometimes, all it takes is you walking by and all I can think about the rest of the day is getting into bed with you. One whiff and I’m picturing you taking advantage of me in the middle of the grocery store or out in the park. Maybe at a restaurant, where you’ll reach over and start stroking me through my pants under the table,” Cas reaches down to mimic his words with his actions, finally taking Dean into his hand. “You’ll go slow and light, make it last as long as possible, while I struggle to contain my cries of pleasure. I love it when you sneak up behind me and wrap me in your arms. You kiss all along my neck and shoulders and I feel tingles, running up my scalp and down my spine, like this,” Cas temporarily removes his hand from Dean’s dick to scratch and tickle at the back of his head. A violent shiver rocks his body and Dean gasps. “Whatever I’m doing, I have to stop because you’re touching me all over. Eventually, you reach your hand down my pants and were it not for your strength behind me, I would fall to my knees. I go weak when you take me. Any way you take me. Your hand, your mouth, fucking me into the bed. And it’s all the more pleasurable because I know you are taking your pleasure in me. You could have anyone but you chose me. I want you so bad it hurts. Can you feel how hard I am for you, Dean?”
“Wha-wh-what?” One word was all Dean could manage, gasping under the weight of Cas’ sensual presence.
“Oh, that. Well…” Dean sat up just enough to look Cas in the eyes and continued, “every time you guess wrong, it’ll get a little harder to think, a little harder to speak.”
“Shit!” Sam’s team just lost the skirmish and the screen switched to the stat screen. “Are we still talking about this Castiel guy?” Sam asked, finally looking at Dean.
Castiel was clearly surprised, but Dean wasn’t quite sure why. It didn’t really matter. Castiel did agree to some water.
Gabriel barged in loudly, door slamming the wall behind it. An orderly leaned in through the doorway, apologizing and explaining that she tried to stop him. Gabriel just strode up to the side of the bed, ignoring her completely.
“What would you like to do now?” Dean asked. “Do you feel comfortable with me moving onto your torso? And legs?”
“Yes,” Cas sighed against his cheek. “Then I shall give us both what we need.” Taking Dean’s jaw in his hand again, Cas yanked him into a furious kiss. He took them both in one hand and used their combined pre-cum to slick the way as he jerked them off. Tears of pleasure rolled down Dean’s face as he took what Cas gave him. It only took a few moments ‘til Dean saw nothing but white, the brightness spreading through him, voice cracking on an aborted scream. His mouth was still agape when he felt Cas flop half on top of him, his head pillowed on Dean’s bicep. Many moments passed as both of them laid there, gasping for breath. Dean never wanted to move again.
This was important. Dean had to do this to prove to himself that he had enough restraint. Each movement was calculated and careful. He really did want this to be good for Castiel. He knew what to do; all he had to do was convince Castiel of that too.
Gabriel made a face, probably picturing our mother the same way I was, hovering and consoling and babying me day after day. Eugh.
He laughed, finding the reaction both funny and thrilling. “Sorry, that was an accident.” He can’t lose Castiel’s trust now, or he’d never see him again. Castiel was ticklish. He would have to bury this little tidbit forever if he wanted to keep him coming back. New as it was, Dean didn’t want to lose this connection so soon.
Cas’ face was stoic as ever, except for a twitch in one eyebrow and the flush of his neck, spreading up into his cheeks giving him away. Dean’s eyes glinted with satisfaction at riling Cas up. But Cas had something to say, and he would say it. “No, Dean, that is the problem. You are always taking the lead, and pulling me to pieces…”
I waved him off, not wanting to hear his pity. My whole life was going to be built around this. The doctors wanted me to take a break from school to focus on recovery. The best news of all was that with a partial severance, there’s a chance some of my movement and sensation could come back. I didn’t want to stop school, but who knew if I’d even be able to pursue my original degree? Plus, the sooner I got to physical therapy, the more likely I was to recover something. The other big change was that I couldn’t live on my own anymore, not until the doctors were certain I was independent.
Oh, that was just precious. Under the circumstances, he supposed it wouldn’t be so bad to refund the money since Castiel was practically coerced into coming. But Dean really wanted to work his magic on this guy and, probably not unlike his brother, he could see Castiel needed it. “I think in the spirit of your brother’s good intentions, I’ll have to ask you to at least give it a try. Give me half an hour.”
A fresh wave of tears flowed on the swell of emotion from Gabriel’s words. It wasn’t self-pity, but gratefulness I felt now. I was thankful for the tears too because it meant I didn’t have to speak. I didn’t know what I would say if I could. I was still devastated and lost, but at least I wasn’t alone.
Castiel sure knew how to flatter a guy. It just made him want to work even harder for him. “Hm-hm! You bet.”
Dean felt a true smile burst onto his face. “I’m not sure that’s how you use that expression. Aren’t you an editor?”
Suddenly, Dean’s stomach sank to the floor. Now that he thought about it, maybe it would be best if he transferred Castiel to Benny if he wanted to continue getting massages. Sam was right, it wasn’t appropriate to be feeling this way about a client. Switching him to someone else would be the ethical thing to do. Benny is just as talented and friendly, Dean was certain Castiel would be just as happy with him.
They took the MRI the next day. The look on Dr. Sweet’s face told me everything I needed to know about the results when he came to deliver them. I let him speak anyway and nodded once to indicate I understood. I was totally numb– at least in my heart. The physical pain was worse today. After so much trauma in the last few days, I think my brain just couldn’t handle any more emotion. I stared blankly at my sheet-covered, useless lap for a long time. They brought food at some point. I think I ate some. Definitely had some water. The afternoon brought a visitor.
Castiel finally met his gaze. He must have seen something trustworthy. “I… okay. But if I don’t like it–”
Dean could tell Castiel really liked having his thighs massaged. This was great because Dean really liked massaging them. They were soft, especially the inner surfaces and satisfyingly thick. But when Dean moved on to his back and shoulders, he knew that’s where Castiel needed it most. Dean worked the area hard and earned Castiel’s beautiful groans in return. If he didn’t know Castiel was embarrassed about making the sounds to begin with, he’d think he was faking it. The fact that they were genuine made it so much more rewarding. It struck him that Castiel was very much like a skittish cat. He might have been frightened at first, but give him a couple of good scratches behind the ears and he’d be purring in no time. He chuckled at his own metaphor.
Castiel felt a hot blush rush to his cheeks. He couldn’t decide whether he felt embarrassed or turned on.
“When I am so lost I can barely speak, and all I know in the whole universe is you, you say things. Filthy things. You tell me what you’ll do to me, ask me questions that you know I can’t answer because my mind is a fog of pleasure, just so you can answer them for me. You talk to me, just like this, and sometimes touch…” Cas ran a single finger behind the curve of Deans ear, all the way down his neck, blazing a fire beneath his skin, “…You touch me and tease me with your words. Sometimes I think I can’t take it a moment longer, and others I think I never want you to stop.”
Inexplicably, I snorted. Of course, that’s what would finally capture Gabriel’s attention. I broke down in helpless hysterical giggles. Gabriel stared with concern but smirked a little. Tears of laughter spilled down my cheeks until suddenly they weren’t happy tears anymore. The laughter turned into wracking sobs, shaking me so hard I thought I might fall off the bed. I fell forward onto my hands and wept. Gabriel murmured soothingly, rubbing my back. It was embarrassing, crying so openly in front of my brother for the first time since I was a child, but I just couldn’t seem to get control of myself. I really was broken. I couldn’t even tell the difference between laughing and crying anymore.
Dean brought his hands back to Cas’ tummy, clawing with them both and leaned down to blow a wet raspberry on his neck. Cas
“What does this have to do with singing poorly to popular songs, Dean? And that’s a lie, I know for a fact you love-”
Dean watched Castiel’s back under the towel rise and fall gently with his slow breaths. Castiel was enough of a fan to recognize an orchestral cover of Pink Floyd. Oh, Dean’s poor heart. “I hear ya, buddy, but I gotta make sure everyone’s happy.”
Castiel’s feet were relatively soft– another symptom of office work. His soles were smooth and healthy. Dean felt privileged to be handling someone who was clearly so rarely handled. Now if only Castiel would sit back and enjoy it.
Castiel gave and his languid movements were all Dean needed to know he’d done a good job. If Castiel didn’t come back after this, nothing would convince him. It didn’t surprise him that Gabriel Novak would sign up his ‘anti-massage’ brother to get a massage. Although, he didn’t know whether he intended it as a prank to make Castiel suffer or to give him an experience he would never seek on his own. Knowing Gabe, he probably would have been happy with either outcome. In any case, Dean was glad he had orchestrated this. Only one question remained.
“I told you you’d like it. People with sensitive feet tend to enjoy these massages the most. The masseuse has to know what he or she’s doing though.”
Cas looked up from his sumptuous feast, his lips plump and shiny. Cas’ dark eyes locked with Dean’s, and he pressed himself up from the bed. He crawled over Dean to straddle his waist again, leaning into his face. Dean began to lift up to finally claim Cas’ mouth, but without saying a word, Cas caught Dean by the chest and pressed him back down to the bed, panting hard. Then, he took Dean by the jaw and turned his face to the side, squeezing slightly once to indicate that Dean should not move.
With that thought in mind, he decided to go all in. He wasn’t going to hold back anymore, and he wanted to give Castiel the best goddamn experience yet.
“Done.” She said when she was finished. They walked to the lobby together and flirtatiously said goodbye.
Once Dean couldn’t see Castiel’s face anymore, he came over and started rubbing the lotion into his skin. He used this time to convince himself that this was any other customer. Just another day, just another guy. It didn’t work all that well.
Dean breathed a deep breath so he wouldn’t say something stupid or unprofessional to his brand new client, emphasis on
Dean not-so-subtly grazed Castiel’s side with his fingertips and Cas knew exactly what he was in for.
“Well, I do!” I shouted angrily. “I know, Gabriel. I know that I’m never going to get anything better than a tourist shot. If I can’t go the places no one else can go, I’ll never see the things no one else sees.”
Dean filled with warmth. “Already thinking about a next time, huh? I must be doing something right.”
Cas lifted himself away from where he’d leaned over Dean to scope out his next conquest. He crawled backward, all the way down so he knelt between Dean’s shins, and started slowly petting his legs.
“Does this mean you’ll come see me again?” Ugh, he sounded like a teen-aged girl asking for a second date.
As Dean spoke, the fingers on his tummy gained just a little more speed and began to roam in an unpredictable pattern, from side to side and up to his bottom ribs. The hand at his scalp also began to venture to the sensitive spots behind his ears, causing him to bite his bottom lip on a gasp and tip his head to the side to try and squash the tickling fingers.
Dean instantly brightened, impressed with Castiel’s ear. “You noticed! It’s actually the London Philharmonic Orchestra playing a cover of
“No don’t you see? It’s irony. The expression is typically used when someone has done you wrong, but we are paying each other back with kindness. It’s funny.”
someone to get interested in. “That’s great to hear. Would you like a quick drink of water or anything? It’s been about twenty minutes.”
From the back of the small crowd, one of the chaperones unintentionally caught my attention. He was making a boy’s shoulders shake with stifled laughter by wiggling his fingers above his head.
To me, that seems a little fanciful at best, impossible at worst. It means you’re responsible for every moment of your life. Your devotion can’t falter for a single beat, because each one is promised to your destined loved one even before you’ve taken your first breath. Just the concept of a soul mate is preposterous. Strings of fate tying certain people together, the inevitability of it all… it doesn’t even sound desirable to me. The universe has decided that I would jive the best with a single person, and I have no say in it? What’s the point of anything if it’s all just decided by destiny; if we were always going to end up here?
The man immediately straightened up, like he’d been caught sneaking cookies. He was very handsome with a square jaw and broad shoulders.
The tumult of rain splashing down around me was broken by the blare of a car horn. My misty vision sharpened for an instant before a shredding pain tore through my right leg and side as the world spun sideways.
Castiel was keeping it casual, but being complimented for something other than his skill felt so good. “Thanks, Cas. You may have just made my day.”
Dean had picked this treatment especially for Castiel, so for him to accept it was gratifying. “I think you’ll really like it. The heat helps to loosen deep muscle tissue and the hardness of the stones helps to dig deeper than I can with my hands.”
The warmth filled Dean’s chest again, a mixture of pride in a job well done, the elation of a budding friendship, and fascination with this intriguing, witty man.
“Would you like me to tell you more about the things you do to me?” Cas punctuated his question with a swivel of his hips into the same place on Dean’s abs.
Sam was not convinced in the slightest. “He’s not a toy, Dean. You know it’s a bad idea to get involved with a client.”
Gabriel looked sadly at his hands. It was so out of character to see him like that, it only made things worse. Everyone was going to censor themselves and tread carefully around me now. I wondered how long this feeling would invade every conversation. Would people always treat me like I was fragile, always afraid to offend?
Castiel relaxed again immediately, which Dean wasn’t expecting. “It’s okay,” Castiel mumbled cutely.
Dean felt a rueful sort of humor. “Everyone just wants to use me for my skills. They don’t really want to marry me. They want free massages.”
say that. What do you think that would do to mom and dad? To me? I know this is… I don’t even have a good word for it. It’s terrible–”
Castiel’s childish stubbornness entertained Dean to no end.  “You are my last customer today, you could probably stay the night. However, I don’t think this table is a good substitute for a bed.”
“Yeah, it’s terrible. I’ll never stand. I can’t feel anything. Zero. I’ll never be independent again. I can’t even take a shit on my own! I was going to see the world! My life was great. I was getting my degree–”
“Now then, I could give you a list of all the options, and then you can pick whichever sounds the best. Or, I could make a suggestion.”
Dean’s eyes squinted as he chuckled and leaned back into Cas’ side pressing a kiss to the corner of his lips and giving a quick squeeze to his side. Cas jumped already regretting his choice. For now, Dean remained with his right hand in Cas’ hair gently scritching at his scalp, sending shivers jumping all over Cas’ skin. It felt rather pleasant, to be honest. His left hand returned to his belly, where it resumed its gentle swirling.
Thank God Saturdays were short days. Dean was beat, and he was grateful he only had one booking left today. It was a long session though. Why did he have to be so damn popular?
I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even tell if I should be moving. The world was dull and blurred around me. My ears rang. I couldn’t make sense of anything. There was white light shining from somewhere and the world looked like it was zooming past me. It was like I was still traveling through space but gravity was in the wrong place. I shut my eyes against it, nausea rising in me. Then all of a sudden I noticed the pain. I might have screamed. I wanted to scream. My leg felt like it was on fire. My whole body felt like it had been used in a game of hacky sack by a group of muay thai boxers. I tried to move my arm just to see if I could and a thousand knives flayed my nerves.
Dean knew Castiel was ticklish. Thinking of acting on that knowledge nearly made him salivate. It would be hell trying to resist. If he could get through this and not tickle him, that would prove that he can do anything, and Castiel would be safe in his hands.
“Just so we’re clear, you’re going to need someone to help you take a shit? Like not just get to the toilet, actually… get it out. Every day.”
My heart sank. I could feel the expression on my face melt into a bland mask. Of course. My brother would never play a prank on a cripple.
“Yeah, Cas, shut up and get to the point. What do you mean, different?” Dean rolled the rest of the way out and stood, brushing himself off as he talked.
Dean squirmed down further, not wanting to give Cas the satisfaction of seeing his excited, toothy smile, wide as can be.
“You mean when you would play horrible pranks on me and blame me for anything that we got caught doing?” I smirked.
Gabriel just gazed at me with pity. I had a feeling I would be getting that a lot from now on. I loathed it. I shook my head. “You know what the cherry on top is?” I paused, squinting with disdain. “I can’t even have sex anymore.”
“Well, when you put it that way...” The laughter came out helplessly. In that moment, Dean knew he couldn’t let Castiel see anyone else, ethics be damned. Dean could be an adult and shove this attraction away. He would learn to deal with it because Dean truly liked Castiel as a person. He was sharp, a bit odd, and so openly expressive. Dean couldn’t give this up willingly and let this new feeling disappear.
Dean nodded once and shut his lips, kissing the finger lying there. Cas smiled sweetly and turned his attention back to discovering Dean’s body. To say this was not what Dean expected would be an understatement. While it was sexy, this wasn’t about sex at all. He couldn’t quite wrap his head around the experience, but it was definitely about connection, Dean thought. Even though Cas was the one doing the poking around, Dean felt like he was discovering Cas in equal measure. Regardless of what it was or wasn’t, Dean liked this. He liked it a lot.
I wasn’t that shocked. It felt like I’d been asleep for weeks based on how murky my body felt. At least my mind felt relatively sharp. “Okay, so what are we looking at here?”
Dean laughed in delight giving Castiel’s belly a couple pats. “Don’t worry buddy, I think you’ve had enough for now.”
When I awakened for the third time, it was a little less awful. A few seconds after waking, I remembered I was in a hospital. It was the crinkly pillow and the smell that gave it away. I was still in pain, but I didn’t feel the need to writhe or whine about it anymore. At least not at the moment. It was daytime, but who knew when exactly. I wondered how long I had been sleeping and what happened. I couldn’t quite remember.
Dean was glad that Castiel couldn’t see his face. He imagined giving up Castiel to Benny’s care, and it just made him angry. That was ridiculous. Benny was his best friend and he had no right to be jealous over a client in any situation, let alone one he had seen only two times.
I never really considered myself a romantic. Commitment and long-term relationships were not very high on my priority list. Not with school and all my plans for travel and world exploration. But now, the thought seemed laughable; impossible even. Who would ever be interested in someone with this level of dysfunction? Nobody sees a guy in a wheelchair and thinks
Dean flailed his wrench, in an effort to halt Cas’ rambling. “Alright, Alright! No problem, buddy, lay it on me.”
“Be there in a sec!” Dean held up a hand but kept looking at Castiel. “I gotta go. How do I contact you?”
Dean nodded eagerly and Cas climbed onto the bed, naked himself except for a pair of bright navy blue boxer-briefs. He looked nervous again; like he didn’t really know what to do. But Dean promised he wouldn’t say anything, so he closed his eyes and relaxed, trying to put off an air of peace. Breathing steadily and focusing on the warmth of the dimly lit, cozy little bedroom, Dean waited. He listened to Cas’ breathing too, trying to gauge his mood. Eventually, Cas’ breathing seemed to calm too, and he began to shift on the bed. Dean opened his eyes again when Cas swung his leg over to straddle Dean’s abdomen. Cas scanned Dean with his eyes, steady and thorough; everywhere from the tips of his fingers, to the lines in his forehead to the dip of his navel. Cas wasn’t hard, and Dean was only partially there just from being naked and tied to the bed by Cas. And yet this suddenly felt startlingly intimate.
Dean didn’t know why, but the way Cas said that made him shiver and get hot all over. He peered at Cas through his eyelashes in time to see Cas smile and chuckle mischievously. He was clearly gaining confidence in his actions, and Dean was glad. He couldn’t help but react honestly when he was resigned to Cas’ control like this. Cas was right to tie him down, because if he hadn’t, Dean would have lost his resolve just then and thrown Cas down to ravish him silly. Instead, Dean squirmed and whimpered a bit with the effort it took to not say anything.
“What do you mean? You out of wheelchairs or something?” I said sarcastically, dreading whatever the doctor had to say that made him so somber.
Relief and joy washed through him. “Awesome.” He gave Castiel some parting advice to get the most out of his treatment, just like he would for any other client.
“Do you know what one of my favorite things you do is, Dean? When we are in the heat of passion, do you know what I like most?” Cas growled, low and tingly, into Dean’s ear. He could hardly stand to sit still. “You may answer me, Dean.”
“It looks like you’ve stabilized well. Your vitals are good. Do you feel up to talking to the doctor?”
“Hmmm…” Dean smiled as he thought, still buried in Cas’ shoulder. “Okay, I’ll think of a number between 1 and 100. All you gotta do is guess it.”
Even if Dean were allowed to speak he probably wouldn’t have. Cas had begun to caress his calf, all the way up to his knee, which turned out to be surprisingly pleasant. No one had ever paid this much attention to his calves before; who would think to? But when Cas massaged the muscle and added his lips into the mix again, brushing delicately over his leg hair and pressing into the soft skin to the side his knee, Dean could do nothing but hum in pleasure. Gentle fingers were playing at the back of his knee, which filled his belly with sunshine, making him want to laugh again. He didn’t quite laugh, but he did wriggle his shoulders in delight and press deeper into the mattress. Cas spent a good deal of time here as well, smiling into his kisses when Dean called his name occasionally.
Five minutes later, the kids were being shuffled to the next attraction by the female chaperone after some truly impressive Waggle Dancing. The attractive man came up to me, hands in his pockets, charming smile front and center.
“Yeah, hey,” the man, Dean, took a step away but leaned toward me like he didn’t want to go. “I know this is completely out of nowhere and not really a good time, but…” He trailed off, looking a little flustered.
Just as she sent another group of kids followed by their parents (much more enthusiastic and warmer too, though anyone was nicer than that lady), she spotted from her peripheral view that there was a girl by her table, and instead of tapping her on the shoulder, she stood there, silently waiting for her attention.
Ivy glanced quickly at her watch. Woah, there’s only one hour to go. She shot Izzy a grateful grin, “Thanks, I had no idea how much time passed. Are we going to the office? I heard they had killer snacks.”
The kids crowded the table, hands hovering above the stacks of paper indecisively. Though it took a while, they eventually stood beaming at Ivy, waving the sheets that they’ve chosen in the air, “Miss, miss! Is this okay?”
Then she was assigned to the scavenger hunt table, the table nearest to the door and the kiosk. Ivy never really minded about kids, in fact, she actually prided herself on her great kids-skills. “Remember to remind them that after they’re done they need to bring back the pencil—” Ms. Beckman points at the box of sharp pencils, “—and the clipboard—” points at the box of clipboards, “okay?”
The girl grins at Ivy, flashing her rounded and white teeth. “I mainly watch YouTube videos, Dad wouldn’t let me play it because he said I’m still too small. I’m Nancy by the way.”
Ivy smiles, “I like the games enough, but they’re a bit creepy for me though. You must be really brave playing it.”
The kids looked at Ivy in a uniform manner and chirped “Yah!” loudly. The mother, however seemed unimpressed.
Setting up for the entire thing was a giant blur of meeting volunteers who actually knew what they were doing, helping Gabe carry large fossils up to the ground floor for the Fossil Touch Table, and helping Ms. Beckman add clips to the newly made name cards (which were still comfortably warm and fresh from the printer).
Ivy looked at her watch, six minutes until the museum doors open. There were more volunteers now, Izzy was talking to her boyfriend who was dressed in a neon orange shirt that said “Volunteer” on the back.
Ivy knew Izzy; the two girls had met during one of the many events the museum hosts. Izzy was a student of the Advanced Studies Paleontology course, and Ivy would be lying if she said she wouldn’t want to take that course in the future. Ivy nodded again and tried to smile reassuringly to the elder woman. Ms. Beckman returned the smile before quickly walking away towards the Fossil Touch Table where Chelsea was struggling with the sign that refused to stay upright.
Three minutes. She’s still not here yet. When her roommate said she’s going to be late for this, Ivy didn’t take her seriously. Where is she?
Ivy nodded her head fiercely, and Ms. Beckman continued, “Also, tell the kids that after they finish, they could go to Izzy at the kiosk to get a plastic dinosaur.”
“She always bugged us to go to a comic con involving Five Nights at Freddy’s.” A voice popped the small bubble made from happiness seeing a cute kid that Ivy had just created around her; she startled.
Ivy turned in her seat, taking in the peculiar girl. The girl had dark caramel hair that framed her chubby pale cheeks. She was about seven years old, judging by her tubby form. Ivy’s eyes couldn’t help but stare down at the girl’s t-shirt, where Freddy the bear was staring straight at her with a feral grin on his animatronic face. The white and bolded words “Five Nights at Freddy’s” looped around the bear, standing out due to the pale blue background of the shirt.
There was an obnoxiously loud noise somewhere near her; she could hear her roommate groaning for her to “Turn it off, damn it”. Ivy was greeted blearily at the off-white ceiling of her shared room with her roommate. The alarm clock that she had set the night before was blaring out the bland marimba tone. Ivy mockingly imitated to the tone for several times until her roommate called from the other side of the room, angrier this time, that “If you don’t turn it off this instant, I will help you do just that or so God help me”.
Later, when Ivy and Izzy finished helping to clean up the museum and walked outside the door, they saw a black car that was parked at the foot of the steps. Two people were hugging and talking in low tones while Nancy sat in the back seats with her feet dangling out of the car door. When the couple broke apart, Ivy recognized the silhouette of Dean standing in front of a person; only tufts of black hair was visible above Dean’s shoulders.
Ms. Beckman sidestepped to let Ivy pass, in the same time to reveal a barely-smiling Joan. Ivy had feared Joan despised her at first, because what’s not to hate if you were determined you didn’t like someone? But Joan just didn’t smile as wide as everyone else would; you would have to earn the small smirk that plays on the corner of her mouth, or the amusement dancing in her eyes. Both women clearly were relieved that someone had come early to help them set up.
“Of course!” Ivy hands the child a clipboard and a pencil, before repeating the well-practiced rules. “Which one would you like?”
Ivy blinked, wasn’t Dean just a normal parent bringing his daughter to the museum for Discovery Day? “I didn’t know he was so into paleontology.”
“Don’t forget to give the clipboards and pencils back!” Ivy called after them, “You also get a plastic dinosaur if you exchange your finished sheet with Izzy at the kiosk!”
The affirming reply was very distant, and Ivy almost didn’t catch it. But it made Ivy smile, nonetheless.
“Huh,” Ivy mused, not knowing what to say in place of that. The office returned to silence, excluding Ms. Beckman’s intermittent typing in the background.
She had promised Gabe that she would be there to volunteer for Fossil Day, and she sure as heck wasn’t about to miss it. She stopped halfway to grab her usual at Liz’s burger joint and wolfing the contents down before resuming her trip.
The man tapered off a bit, seeming flustered with one hand in his sandy hair. “I was just saying…uh…how Nancy loves the games you know? She wouldn’t stop talking about the games at the table and would prefer the entire family huddled in front of one computer watching a YouTuber playing the games than playing with her classmates.”
Luckily, she arrived at the front steps of the museum with 15 minutes to spare. Gingerly, she tried opening the front metal doors. It creaked open, giving way to a dark void that is the insides of the museum. Ivy could hear Ms. Beckman and Joan talking in the office, so she stumbled through the museum until she could see the infinitesimal of light peeking from the crack of the office door.
In front of her, where Nancy was there a minute ago, stood a man clad in black leather from head to toe. Some of the terror must have shown on her face, however, since the man started flailing a bit, making himself seem younger than he probably is. “I’m sorry! Did I sneak up on you? I totally know how creeped out you could get! Cass…”
Ivy nodded, trying to look as unconfused and professional as possible. She had been in this museum before—God knows she loves fossils—but she has no idea what the plan for the setup would be. They’re off to a great start.
The moment the kids got handed both objects, they sped away almost instantly in a cloud of laughter and footsteps, with the mother following at their heels without paying Ivy more attention, and Ivy was strangely cool with it.
Izzy just looks amused now. “He wasn’t all that savvy, until he started dating Mr. Goody-two-shoes, that is.”
“Like Connor. Dean loves talking to him because of that band they like.” Izzy makes a face, “And Gabe, they talk about the newest paleontology event in town and stuff.”
When he’d gone into a brief period of remission they’d gone back to dating until they settled back together as a couple. Dean was no longer managing the garage, it had nearly killed him to do it, but, well… Balthazar turned out to be a great manager and Dean could go back to being a great Mechanic. The business was thriving, Dean and Cas were happy again for the first time in forever, but of course it couldn’t last.
“I’ll be fine Gabriel. As the doctor said, its 2 months then I’ll have the rest of my life… or what’s left of it anyway.” Cas hung his head sadly.
Deans’ shoulders dropped instantly, his jaw tensing remarkably. “Yes.” Dean said gruffly. Technically that was still true and the girl clearly didn’t know what had happened so it didn’t make sense to take it out on her.
“I know its hard Cas, I can’t imagine what this is like for you and I’m not trying to put you under any pressure, but I just want you to understand that this is time critical. And its horrible to think about, but you do need to get tested in case any of them…”
“It’s under your name, but we both know how much money Castiel put into that place and the fact is, he has paid most of the mortgage payments. You might be forced to sell the business and split the money.”
“The books are a shambles, quite frankly we’re open to investigation for tax fraud with how he’s moving money around. I’ll sort it out until you can hire someone else.”
“I think Dean has seen you at your worst as well Cassie. He loves you and as much as I hate to say it…” Gabriel sighed. “He’s a good guy Cassie.”
Gabriel sighed and brushed a tear from his brother’s cheek. “Now Cas, while you were in surgery… some stuff happened.”
Cas frowned when he saw Eileen on the sofa waiting, staring at him and he twigged. “Why does this look an awful lot like an intervention?” He said. “What I have done?”
“I know you’re worried he’s going to do something stupid, but he’s been doing better, he’s not a mess like he was in college, he’s strong Gabe.” Sam realised, eyes widening.
This time when Cas woke up he was warm. He knew he was safe. The feeling of something heavy wrapped around him should have been a cause for panic, but it wasn’t. He didn’t know why, until he did, and the familiar smell of home met his tired addled brain. That smell was Dean.
“You idiot Cas. You absolute damn idiot.” Here it was Cas thought, but then he realised Dean was crying. Why was Dean crying?
“I’m not calm Dean, I hate this too, I just don’t deal with things the same way you do.” Sam sighed. “And it can take a couple of hours Dean, they have to be thorough.”
“Don’t say it Sam. I can’t…” Dean choked and leant heavily into his brother’s shoulder. “It’s my own fault anyway. I should never have bought the damn garage. Everything was perfect before then.”
Gabriel and Sam sat in the corridor outside Cas’ room waiting for their turn to see him. Jody and Dean were in there with him right now and as much as Gabriel was itching to be in there, he knew he wasn’t what his little brother needed right now.
“So, when will the next course start, do we need to continue with dialysis?” The unusually organised Gabriel started firing off the questions.
“Sure.” Cas said, but there was nothing genuine about his tone. He sounded defeated and sad every time he talked about Dean and that was the complete opposite of what Gabriel usually expected from his brother. Cas could wax lyrical on the tiniest things that Dean had done whenever Gabriel asked, but now he brushed aside talking about his ‘soulmate’ every time his name was brought up.
“You know what,” Dean took Cas by the shoulders. “Husband.” He breathed, emphasising the word. Jade eyes locked with bright blue orbs and Dean took a breath, savouring every inch of his partners face. “When we have enough money to buy a house, I will
Those damn blue eyes. You couldn’t say no them and she had to tred carefully or Cas would dig his heels in.
“Yeah I know. I’m sorry to crash on you and Eileen. Once the apartment contract is up at the end of the month I’ll find my own place.”
“I don’t deserve you.” Cas startled when he realised he wasn’t alone. He startled again when he realised who was in the room.
“There’s something else I want to talk to you about, something that I think would help us both...” Dean started.
“Dean you can’t survive with no kidneys.” Cas rolled his eyes. “And I can’t survive without you.” He said fondly.
Dean stood up suddenly. “Cas, you home?” He asked nervously. When there was no answer he moved towards the bedroom, just to discover the bed was empty and made. The bathroom was clear too and the kitchen.
“Good.” The doctor smiled. “As planned we removed the worst affected kidney and the operation was a success. Scans have shown the Chemo is working, the cancer on your remaining kidney has shrunk significantly but we’re not there yet unfortunately. To save your other kidney we will have to continue chemo, but I’m very optimistic.”
“Dean, we’ve already rung round everyone he knows… no one’s seen him and, he’s not at the house, Gabriel’s just been there...” Sam explained.
“We are not sure what could have caused it in someone so young. You don’t drink or smoke? Do drugs.”
“I’m afraid Mr. Novak, it’s not the flu that caused you to pass out, nor your alarmingly low blood sugar level.”
“What’s going on with Cas is the love of his life, aka that scum of the earth brother of yours, is divorcing him.”
“Dean, I’m back.” Sam walked into the apartment. Eileen would still be at work, but Dean should be back by now.
“Dean’s working, taking on Singer’s place, the debt… Cas’ working two jobs, he’s just worn out. The business is raking it in though, so it won’t be long before things go back to normal.”
“Jesus Christ, Cas!” Jake hopped over the desk and knelt down by Castiel. “Castiel!” Cas was grey and a little yellowish, unmoving and breathing heavily, skin sheened in sweat.
“Oh Cas Honey…” Jody started, but as she got closer to her friend she realised something was off. Jody frowned. Yes, Cas smelt of alcohol but looking at his eyes, the usual blue was engulfed but the black of his blown pupils and the way he could not focus on her made her stomach dropped.
It was a miracle they’d been able to buy the business. Poor Bobby Singer had been desperate to sell. He was suffering from heart disease and wanted to spend his last years living life to the full. He was a great Boss and Cas knew Dean considered him a friend. That’s why when Dean came up with the crackpot idea of taking over Bobby had cancelled the deal with the developers and reduced the price as much as he could.
“I never cheated on you Cas.” Dean blurted out desperately, fresh tears pricking his eyes. “I could never… what you said about me being it for you, is exactly how I feel. You’re it for me too Cas. You’re all I want, you’re all I will ever want. I need you like I need air t breathe.”
“Well Cassie, breaking news I am worried. And I’m going to be worried until you’re better. So, stop worrying about me, worrying about you. Neither of us need the stress.”
It was 10am by the time Dean had breakfast ready for Cas. As he trotted back up the stairs wearily there was no sign of Gabriel waking up. If the older Novak’s sleeping pattern was anything to go by, then he wouldn’t arise for maybe another 2 hours.
“Gabriel please… I don’t know for sure he’s cheating and even if I’m right I still love him. Even if he doesn’t love me back, I will always love him.”
“Castiel, the doctors are really worried about you. You’re still losing weight, you need your strength if you are going to beat this.”
“You two sorted yourselves out then?” Gabriel said seriously, with a raised eyebrow, despite the fact that he’d evidently heard the entire conversation.
“Oh God. Castiel… We’re getting you to the hospital now. I’m calling Dean.” She bit back the tears and scrambled for her phone.
Sam sighed and looked over at Dean who was now stirring on the sofa. Sam pushed Gabriel back into the street and closed the door behind himself.
He soon started running better than ever and with 2 weeks to go till the Olympic selection he could see his dream coming into place. And then the car hit him on a training run, going 20 over the speed limit. It was a miracle he had survived.
“Dean, stop shouting, you are upsetting my brother, he’s not very well and he’s staying with me until he’s better.”
Cas took a breath and then did so. “I rang up and they said he wasn’t there. That he wasn’t supposed to be working. Actually, they said that for a while now he’s been able to work regular hours, but most nights he doesn’t come home, and I never see him. I have no idea what he has been doing for weeks. When he does come home at night, he’s usually gone before I wake up and he slept as far away from me as he could. He’s never been like that, he’s usually a really clingy sleeper. He used to wake me up with a kiss every morning or sometimes…”
“Ermm… I can give her a run for her money, but she’s a specialist divorce lawyer Dean. One of the best.”
So that’s what he’d been doing. Instead of going home to Cas, he went down the garage. His old friends, the smell’s and the sounds, it made him happy again. Made him able to get through the day. He didn’t think about Cas at all.
Cas hung up. So, he hadn’t seen Dean for week, despite the fact he was on normal hours. And if he wasn’t working today then where the hell was he?
Cas had broken down, then surrounded by his friends he had told them everything, from his family to the fact he was gay. Cas would have loved to have said that it had made everything better, but it hadn’t. His friends had been amazing, but eyes had been on him all the time making sure he ate, making sure he slept and took days off training. He’d felt just as trapped as he’d always had, that was when Dean wasn’t visiting him.
In February Cas had started throwing up, in his typical manner he’d passed it off as a stomach bug, until he couldn’t. Dean had rushed him straight to the hospital and the cancer was back, with a vengeance apparently. More Chemo, more hospital hours, more of his husband putting on a brave face…
The doctor’s office was horrendously busy, and the noise was making Cas’ headache worse and worse. Sam checked him in and sat down next to him as they waited. Cas was looking very fragile and up close he could see just how much weight he’d lost. It was frightening, and Sam was beyond worried, but they were here now, they’d get it sorted.
His stomach ached. But he felt… better somehow. That feeling of sickness, the unbearable and constant nausea was gone, well, not gone, but it was like a weight had been lifted. He wearily forced his eyes to open, fighting against the cloud of sleep.
His life back then had been miserable, the only thing he looked forward to was seeing his friends at school. Dean, Sam, Charlie and Kevin had made his life bearable without even knowing it. The only freedom his parents allowed him was in his running, so he spent every spare minute training. By the time he, Sam and Kevin reached college Castiel was a scholarship athlete with a very real shot at the Olympics. Marathon had become his specialism. Dean was a mechanic, staying behind as the rest of them went to Stanford.
Cas had sustained fractures to his T2 and L13, 4 and 5 vertebrae. It was a miracle he could walk. The doctors said his recovery was thanks to how fit he was before the accident, it had saved his life, but he would never run again. The loss of functionality in his hips and legs made it difficult to walk, he could manage short distances and even years later he was still improving. Getting a little further each trip, but 2 years later and his back ached all the time, and apparently it always would. What annoyed Dean most was Cas’ refusal to take the painkillers the doctor had prescribed, but Cas didn’t see the point. If this was going to be the rest of his life he might as well get used to it.
“I can see you have a lot of questions and I am very happy to answer them.” He continued. “But it would appear your brother needs some time for this to sink in. I will come back in half an hour to discuss options with you both.”
“Any bars I can get to for 5 bucks.” Cas smiled weakly, riffling through his pockets and discovering he as usual had very little money in his wallet.
“I had the flu last week.” Cas started. “I just must have gone back too early, I felt a bit faint and dizzy then I woke up here.”
“I’m so sorry Gabriel. You can count on my discretion, attorney-client’s brother privilege after all.”
Cas looked up at their new home in awe. It was, in a word, perfect. It had a little bit of both of them in the layout; the modern, airy, open plan that Cas loved with just enough rustic to make Dean feel at home.
“It’s not shit Dean, it’s my religion. And I’m not a sheep, I don’t believe because my parents told me too.”
“No.” Cas sighed. “I’m worried about what will happen if it goes to trial, I’m worried about having to testify… I don’t think I could do that Sam, I don’t think I could go through that.” Cas' composure tailed off rapidly as he spoke, so much so that Sam feared he might have a panic attack.
Dean didn’t come home that night either. Nor did he reply. Cas lay alone in bed and shivered with cold and fever, thinking of Dean.
Sam opened his mouth to protest, but changed his mind. If his brother was admitting he needed to get away, he wasn’t going to stop him.
“But I can’t promise you that I will get better. Nothing is certain even at this stage, but the doctors, they are now optimistic.” Cas put his hand in Dean’s as his husband moved his chair closer to the bed. “I have kidney failure Dean, probably for months before the Cancer started.”
“Anyway, I have to get back to work.” Sam announced and headed towards the door. “You look after our Castiel, Dean. Or else.”
Dean had been pacing the entire time Cas was in there. He understood Cas didn’t want him in there, Sam had calmed him down and explained the reasons why Cas might not want Dean to see him like this and it wasn’t that Dean wanted to see Cas like this, he never wanted to see his lover hurt, but he wanted to be there for him. And it kind of hurt that Cas didn’t want him there. But he couldn’t be mad, this wasn’t about him, it wasn’t a rejection, it was about Cas and what he needed.
“I’ve never seen you so organised.” Cas chuckled slipping the tubes of his nasal cannula over his ears. He had to admit the extra oxygen made him feel better. The chemo had made his red blood cell count drop and as a result, his blood oxygen was rather low.
“Sir, I’m afraid we are closed, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.” The guy swore and kicked something as he left, but frankly Jake didn’t care.
Dean didn’t even try to stop it. He climbed into Cas’ arms and let the tears flow until they were soaking Cas’ skin through his hospital gown. Cas just stroked his hair softly, shushing him gently and his own tears wetting the side of Dean’s face.
“Honestly Dean, there is not point wishing or dwelling on what happened. It happened. I can’t change it, you can’t change it. I’m happy now, I’m happy with you isn’t that enough?”
“Ok.” Gabriel didn’t argue further. Now wasn’t the time. He just held his brother tightly and tried not to let the tears flow down his cheeks.
I hope that ending did it for you all. I hate writing endings... I'm rubbish at it, hence the time it took to get this out to you. But I hope this was worth the wait.
“So…” Cas smiled as Dean opened the door and walked into their little apartment. Dean smiled back at his newly-wed husband. Dean wasn’t really the marrying type, but he knew deep down it had mattered to Cas. Cas never told Dean what he wanted so Dean had, had to get good at reading his partner in life. Cas was so selfless it was beyond belief he always put himself last, which could be difficult at times, but Dean had got better at noticing when his lover was neglecting himself, or holding something back.
“Dean, you never lost me. I was always yours. Always.” Cas held out his arms tentatively. “Come here husband.”
“Yes, I know. You’re waiting for us to get married like a good little Christian.” Dean practically spat and Cas felt his own heckles raise in anger.
Jody frowned, she really didn’t want to leave but, at this stage, she might as well go all in. “Ok call me if you need me and don’t be a stranger.”
Dean had, had a good day. The business was running well and now he reckoned he could work regular hours even including those extra he put in in the garage. Ok, more than a few more hours in the garage, but he’d missed it so much and it had really brought his head back into a good place. Now he felt better and he missed Cas so much.
“It doesn’t make me sad anymore.” Cas admitted. “I mean I miss it, of course I do, but I can look out the window and imagine running in the park and its just a way of keeping it with me.”
Cas nodded and scooted carefully towards Dean, mindful of the pain in his back. That was one thing Dean was really glad of, Cas wasn’t scared of Dean, or any of the family touching him, in fact it was the opposite. He seemed to take great comfort in being held and Dean was grateful for it. That didn’t mean he took it for granted, Cas had still been through a trauma, he wanted him to feel in control, so he always asked, always.
“The list for transplants is very long. It could be years until we find a kidney for your brother and this treatment course, you are looking at 2 months in hospital, but the kidney is salvageable. You’ll be returning to a healthy, normal life if treatment is successful. Believe me saving you original kidney is much preferable than spending the rest of your life on antirejection drugs.”
There was a beat of silence on the end of the line. “So, this is all one big misunderstanding?” Sam asked, confused.
Cas had expected it to be bad… humiliating, violating… and that it certainly was, but it was worse. At least the rape he barely remembered, the drugs had clouded his mind enough that he there were only dribs and drabs clear to him. This on the other hand was very clear, he felt every clinical touch, every violation and it seemed to last forever.
“Bit early in the day. Can I buy you a drink?” A smarmy English man asked as he slipped onto the stool behind him.
“Hold me, please?” He asked, as if he were afraid of being rejected. Dean didn’t need any further invitation. He squeezed onto the edge of the tiny hospital bed and gently wrapped himself around Castiel. Now he could feel that his Angel was trembling. A hand fisted into his shirt, but Cas’ eyes were still glassy.
“Oh Christ, he looks…” Balthazar couldn’t finish that sentence. He looked like death. He was Cas’ best friend since they were kids, the one who’d convinced Cas to run away and start his own life. They’d lived together for years as roommates. Balthazar three years older looked after Cas while he was at Stanford. When Cas had met Dean, Balthazar had moved to LA, but the two had never grown apart.
“It wasn’t my fault.” The words came easier this time and he was rewarded by a warm kiss pressed to his forehead.
“Do you need a kidney transplant? You can have mine, you can have both of mine.” Den said, getting up and moving close to his husband, warping him in strong arms.
“… I have to go away this weekend… It’s a compulsory training thing.” Cas said, but Dean could see it. Even if he hadn’t heard the phone call earlier he knew when Cas was lying.
“Castiel. You cannot put a price on your life. You know money is not an issue to me and I can ask Balthazar…”
So, he just kept walking as the rain started falling, as it soaked through his clothes and into his skin. And as he turned from cold, to freezing, to numb he didn’t make a move to address it. He walked until his legs gave out and his back was screaming, then settled under a tree and stared into the rain as the clouds above darkened.
“You’ll have to get in line Dean.” Cas chuckled. “I think that Doctor will be experiencing a similar fate to the man murdered on the orient express.” Dean chuckled at that. “And regards yourself, there is also a line forming to throttle you, but I won’t let them.”
“I’m sorry to jump you like this, I think our brother’s kind of set it up. I wouldn’t have come if I’d had known they’d not told you I was coming.” Dean sighed. “I’ll go if you want me to.”
In all honesty he’d just come home for a 20minute lie down. He’d spent all morning at work feeling like crap. The extra hours and juggling two jobs was taking its toll, but they needed the money. It wasn’t forever, he told himself.
“I’m sure he’s fine, just working some crazy shifts, like me. Keeping on top of this mortgage sucks.”
“You blame yourself I know you do." Cas continued. "And I know you’re angry and upset and tired because I keep waking you up in the night...”
“Yes, but only a little on one kidney, the other is fairly severe. They are looking to remove the bad one, and hopefully chemo will have taken care of the cancer in the good one.”
“You want me to stay?” Sam asked. Cas had been looking worse and worse since they’d got him to fess up. He’d probably stopped bothering to hide it from the tall lawyer, but Sam was more than a little worried, especially when he found Dean still wasn’t there to look after him.
“Dean, I think you’re underestimating how hard running a business is going to be. You can’t take a second job on. And now you’re the manager of a business, I expect you to be paying yourself a much bigger salary than mine.” Cas reassured. “And yes, it does make a difference. This job will be the difference between us having electricity or not.”
“No. Gabriel said Cas doesn’t want you to find out. So, I imagine that means nobody else knows either.” Dean looked at Sam like a kicked Puppy as the Moose of a man stood up and got out his phone. “Right, let me call Gabriel and let’s see if I can’t sort out this crap.”
“Dean, I need for us to put this behind us, I can’t stand it when you are hurting and your capacity to blame and punish yourself is unprecedented. I’m going to say this once and I need you to accept it and believe it.” Cas said, forcing Dean to look hi in the eye. “I forgive you Dean and I want you to forgive yourself. We need to put these last few months behind us and move on. You need to move on Dean, because I need you right now. I really need you.”
“Nope not leaving you. Even for that. You’ll have to get used to it.” Dean huffed, and Cas chuckled again.
“Yeah, really good. The best. They caught them Sam… well some of them anyway. The DNA evidence helped them track down 3 guys who they think were involved in… in what happened to Cas and they’re in custody.” Dean said excitedly.
“I’ll make it work.” Dean chuckled, pressing his lips against Cas’ tenderly and the moment they did it was like a fire ignited. It had been so long and there had been so much pain. Cas didn’t hesitate in opening his mouth for Dean and demanding entrance with his own tongue. Dean wanted to keep it gentle, he as worried about his fragile husband, but Cas clearly had no intention of this kiss being chaste. Dean opened his mouth willingly and ran his fingers up the back of Cas’ shoulders, massaging tight and tender muscles as Cas’ fingers roamed his chest and teased the hem of his shirt. Dean moaned when Cas nipped Dean’s lip with his teeth, which made Cas smile into the kiss.
Cas grabbed the phone and put his hand over the receiver to block out the noise. “Gabriel, don’t you dare say anything.”
“Babe, what difference of about what, $150 a week going to make? You don’t need to, your salary is already double mine. If anyone should be getting a second job its me.”
“You spoke to Cas?” Dean asked curiously. “How is he?” Dean realised he hadn’t actually seen in husband face to face in a few weeks and he felt a pang of guilt that he had no idea how his partner was getting on.
The they’d asked him for permission to take photos. He’d said yes, he felt he had to… I mean what would be the point in agreeing to all this so far and then saying no? But with every click of the camera shutter he felt like he was going to be sick.
“I came to check on Cas, he’s been texting me every day, but haven’t heard from him all day. He’s not answering his phone and I was worried sick.”
“Let me finish please. The fact that you ever thought I could have cheated on you, it hurts me Dean. You are my absolute world and I thought you knew me better than that. You’re right I didn’t want to see you, even after Gabriel told me this might all be some huge misunderstanding, but I… Gabriel was right. I thought if I heard it from you, that you had cheated on me, I wouldn’t be able to cope, but the not knowing is hurting me far more. I want to hear your side Dean, but before you start I need you to know that I can’t take you lying to me. I need the truth Dean, all of it, and if you did… If there was someone else then…” Cas sighed. “Then maybe there’s still a way we could go forward.”
Sam and Eileen were silent at the moment. They’d known things were hard for them both, but this was a bit shocking. He wanted to push things, but Cas was so tired he was trembling a little with exhaustion. Eileen’s heart melted at the sight of their friend in such a vulnerable state. She crossed the room and pulled the now quite small framed man into a hug.
Sam glanced across at Cas who was signing something to Eileen. He loved how Cas, the linguist had picked up sign language the instant Sam had started dating Eileen. He’d actually taught Sam most of what he knew. The T-shirt was hanging off him loosely and suddenly Sam twigged.
Dean was different. He drove over every weekend to look after his best friend, but it didn’t feel like that. He took him out to eat, or cooked, but didn’t hover over him checking he ate everything and never said a word if he didn’t finish the plate. There was no pressure, it was easy and he felt safe.
He undid his shoes to ease the ache in his feet and ankles. He rubbed them curiously, they felt numb and a little swollen, but he’d been on his feet all day. Traipsing round the offices of senior agents dealing with their shit, he’d barely touched his on stack of work and knew he’d be working late tonight to catch up. He swung his feet up on the couch, laying back into the pillows and setting his alarm for 20minutes time.
Slowly but surely the realisation hit. Cas had been drugged and dragged out the bar into the alley, his clothes were dishevelled, and his belt wasn’t properly done like he’d tried to put things right but hadn’t been able to. Cas had been raped.
“Then how did you get these?” He pointed to the injuries. Bruises on one arm and an angry cut on his head.
Sam had caught the one side of Dean’s phone conversation as he waited just out the room before he made himself known. Dean was stressed and tired. He could see the worry, the sorrow and the guilt in Dean's eyes and knew it was going to be hard to get him to part with it. It had been nearly 3 weeks since Cas had come home from hospital and although in Sam’s mind the man was doing remarkably well, but it was tearing Dean apart to see his fiancé go through it.
“Mr. Novak.” Cas had kept his own name after the marriage. A mutual decision between himself and Dean.
“We really need to work on our communication.” Dean huffed and Cas chuckled lightly. “I’ll try a lot harder to listen and not jump to conclusions and you’re going to try to express yourself better and not predetermine what I’m going to think or feel. We both need to talk about our feelings a lot more, Capisce?”
Dean clapped over his face in pain and disbelief. He’d never thought Cas would ever be capable of something like that… it was Cas! How could he? He could hardly believe it even though he’d just heard from the mouth of the man in question. It was just like Lisa all over again. Dean knew he was far from perfect, but was he really so bad that every person he ever loved felt the need to cheat on him?
“Right here baby brother.” Gabriel answered, sitting on the other side bed and putting a hand on his little brother’s shoulder. “And I’m not going anywhere.”
Dean point blank refused to leave once visiting hours where over. Cas was comfily curled into him, holding him in a vice like grip even though he’d finally fallen into a drug induced sleep. And Dean was sure as hell not going to disturb him. In fact, none of them ended up leaving, Jody had, had to step in to prevent things getting confrontational, but Sam Gabe and Dean had all spent the night in Cas’ room. It had been largely uneventful apart from the time when a nurse had come in and tried to top up Cas’ sedative, which nearly resulted in Gabriel biting the hand of said nurse off before Sam had held him back.
ill. Very ill. But you already know that much.” Gabriel said with a sigh. “Me and Balthazar are looking after him. The DOD training weekend
10 long years had passed, and a lot had changed. But a lot had stayed the same. Dean and Cas still lived in the house they’d bought in Washington. Dean’s business was thriving, Balthazar was still annoying, Cas still worked too hard, although Dean kept a much closer eye on things these days. There had been no sign of the cancer in 10 long years, so the Doctor’s had told Cas he was cured.
He was interrupted by a knock on the door. If that was Cas he’d swear to God, he was going to punch that…
“How do you want me?” Dean asked and Cas position Deans arm around the back of his shoulders, so he could rest his face into Dean’s chest. Cas sighed contently and let his eyes fluttered closed.
“Well that settles it. I’ll be there.” Cas smiled. “You might want to swing round and ask Dean yourself though. He’s doesn’t pick up the phone at work and our shifts don’t coincide for the next few days so I won’t see him to talk to him.”
“Mr. Novak.” The doctor addressed Gabriel this time, firmly. He knew the relatives often took control while the patient crumbled and that is exactly what was happening now. Castiel wasn’t in the room, not really. His head was somewhere else entirely and by the shocked and gaunt look on his face the doctor knew, he needed time and not to be bombarded with information.
They didn’t say anything else as they ate in silence. Cas made the phone call to his best friend, it had been emotional and now he on the next flight to Atlanta. Then looked at Dean’s name in the contacts list. He had to let the love of his life go if he was going to move on. He deleted the number.
Dean smiled at the memory. “Fair enough. But as soon as business picks up you quit, right. I don’t want you working yourself into the ground.”
“Oh, thank God it’s Cas.” He picked up. “God, Cas I’ve been so worried, where are you? I’m at yours now with Dean, but you aren’t?”
“No, I can’t stress him right now.” Gabriel said firmly. Sam’s heart dropped. This was bad, whatever Cas was going through, it was very bad.
“No way.” Dean scoffed, pouring pancake batter into the pan. "I'll go with Cas, but I ain't seeing no shrink."
Cas blushed before he continued. “He finally told me he could work regular hours when I came home from hospital. Told me, that I could quit at the gas and sip and He even asked me to dinner this weekend. It made me think that maybe I was wrong, maybe he did still love me, but then he got mad at me when I said I had DOD training this weekend and left. He didn’t come home again after that. He must be with him… or her. Probably her.”
“You can stay as long as you need.” Dean opened his eyes to see Eileen had arrived home and had been reading his lips. “But if you leave your dirty socks on the table one more time I’m not cooking for you again.”
“Home?” Cas stepped out the car when Dean opened the door and looked up at the house in confusion. There was a for sale sign with a big Sold sticker covering it. Did that mean. “Dean…”
“What am I doing here?” Jody scoffed. “I got a call of a disturbance in the bar, what the hell are you doing at O’Malley’s, this place is full of the scum of the Earth.”
“Thank God!” Gabriel huffed. “I thought you two were going to start going at it.” Gabriel sighed, stepping in from where Cas knew he’d been hovering just outside the door. His brother was the definition of overprotective and if Dean had put a foot wrong Cas knew Gabriel would have been in there like a flash to save his little brother.
“Cassie, I’m your big brother. I can tell when something’s wrong.” He examined the bruises on Castiel’s arms and the cut on his head. “Is he hurting you?” He glowered.
“Just spit it out Doc, we’ve been in that waiting room for 3 hours and if you keep us waiting any longer, I’m going to have a damn heart attack!”
“Ok leaving!” Sam held his hands up and the pair retreated quickly through the front door, closing it swiftly behind them.
Castiel sighed. “I suppose I better ring Charlie and Kevin. They’ll probably not want much to do with me after the divorce, they were always Dean’s friends not mine.”
Dean’s heart shattered. Into a thousand pieces. All of this, was for nothing. He’d hurt Castiel for nothing, because he’d been rash and jumped to conclusions. Why hadn’t he just asked him?
She could almost see in his eyes the moment in which the memories came flooding back and his face filled with barely concealed emotions.
“I know.” Gabriel sighed. “So, this weekend I booked you in at the clinic. What time should I get you?”
Cas just stood there staring through teary eyes at a spot on the wall. His whole world had shattered, any scrap of strength he had been holding onto left him in that moment. Because Dean was right, and Jody was wrong. Why would Dean ever have wanted him after this?
“I know, but Dean I want to get married. And by that I mean, I want to start planning an actual wedding.”
“I didn’t call to argue about all of this Gabriel. We were at the Gas and sip that Cas used to work at and they told us he’d resigned because he was ‘seriously ill’. What is going on? Dean is worried sick. I’m worried sick because I’ve seen how much weight Cas had lost. I really don’t care what’s happened between him and Dean at this point, because at the end of the day Cas was… is our friend and we care about him.”
He closed his eyes and shivered as the sun began to set and the chill of the night drew in like a blanket and it somehow offered him comfort. He was tired, cold and his back burned like it had been set alight. He doubted anything could give him the strength to stand right now, his legs were numb and unyielding. Despite all this he felt at peace, he rested his weight heavily into the tree and sighed, wondering whether or not he would get to see the sunrise.
Cas sat in the back seat of Jody’s car without prompting. Its like he was trying to stay as far away from her as possible, but she knew it wasn’t personal, not after what he had just been through. He spent the whole car journey looking terrified, not saying a word and frankly breaking Jody’s heart.
“Anyway, the reason I know about Cas’ case, is because, well, its my case now. Cas asked me to be his lawyer and I promise you both Dean, I’m going to do everything in my power to make these bastards pay.” Sam said solemnly.
Cas suddenly felt a burning anger. Had Dean even checked this guys’ references? He gripped his nose tight and stood up in frustration. His head suddenly started to feel very fuzzy and the room tilted violently as his head spun and vision pixelated. He gripped hard onto the table and puffed a few deep breaths. He’d been getting dizzy a lot lately, but that’s the worse it had been. He was just tired.
“I’m sorry Mr. Winchester, Castiel… I won’t keep you in suspense. Congratulations Castiel, you’re cancer free.”
“We are the official owners and managers of Singer’s Autos!” Dean said, waving a folder of paperwork in the air.
“How did you know that?” Dean asked with a frown. The Sherriff had only just called him, so how could Sam already know? Cas didn’t even know yet.
“I can very much appreciate that Gabriel; however, I really must discuss this with the man himself.”
Gabriel thought for a minute. They only reason they’d both been certain Dean was cheating was that he’d served the divorce papers. If that had been because he thought Cas had been cheating… was this just the biggest cock up he’d ever witnessed?
“I’m not sure I will allow that. The whole reason I am doing this on my brother’s behalf is that he cannot deal with the stress right now.”
“Oh, Cas no he won’t.” Jody stroked his hair instinctively and Cas flinched away violently, his eyes wide and terrified. “I’m sorry.” She backed away. Cas was too out of it to think straight, but he needed help.
“Then we can finally buy a place.” Dean smiled and pecked him on the cheek. “Get somewhere with bigger windows.”
This wasn’t his house. It was Dean’s. He couldn’t stay here, it was wrong to stay in a place he didn’t belong. He had nowhere to go, no phone or money… his rapists had taken the valuables. Before he knew what he was doing he was stood outside the front door, rain tumbling off the porch and running in rivers down the asphalt. Putting the key under the doormat where they always did, he took one last look at the place that would have been his home, forever.
And Cas just let it happen. They told him it was for the best. And he believed them, he knew what he was, was wrong and shameful, so much so that he hadn’t told another living soul. Not his friends, nor his brothers. Michael, Raphael and Lucifer certainly would not understand, but he had been close to Balthazar and Gabriel, he was tempted to tell them, but never did. They were all much older than him and had left home long ago, so Castiel was alone in his misery.
“Thank you. And you will you stop trying to hide your bloody tissues in the trash, the doctor told me you were coughing up blood.”
“Nothing, I’ll tell him I’m DOD training this weekend and well, there is training but it’s for field agents not techies.”
“It was partly me Cas and you can admit that.” Dean sniffed as Cas stroked through his hair, tears streamed down both their faces. “I’m glad I’m your reason to live Cas, but its not ok that I’m your only reason to live. That needs to change.”
“No Dean I understand.” Cas turned swiftly, already having his hand on the door handle before Dean could react.
“I’m going to murder who did this, I swear to God…” He cut off as the doors to Cas’ room opened and the medical staff poured out.
So, sedative free or not Cas was exhausted. Usually an early riser he slept well into the morning before Dean felt him start shifting.
“It just doesn’t really. Yes I want them in prison so they can’t ever do this again, but their incarceration does not change the fact that what happened, happened and it happened to me. I still have to live with it. I don't care what happens to them.”
suggest that of me!” Cas yelled back, unseen tears brimming in his eyes, is that what Dean really thought?
“I’ll go pull Baby around.” Dean said with a smiled, planting a soft kiss to Cas’ forehead. “Will you be good without me for a few minutes?”
“I want the ring back.” Dean demanded, and Cas nodded. He said nothing as he slipped the simple metal band from his finger and placed it in Dean’s waiting hand. Cas backed out of the room crippled with despair and when Dean slammed the front door and as the impala screeched away down the street Cas wanted to crumble to the ground. But somehow, he kept standing. After a moment staring dumbfounded his brain started to kick into gear.
We are getting close to the end of this one now, but I have extended the chapter count a little as I need to bring this to a more satisfying ending.
Sorry its a bit of a filler, but I'd rather post something than wait to give you a super long chapter and this will take off some of the suspense.
“Ok, I’m sorry, just two seconds. Everything’s fine.” Cas said and then put the phone back to his ear.
After 3 months Cas realised he hadn’t actually spoken to his husband for anything more than a sleepy grunt in 3 weeks. He was lonely, stressed and tired, but he knew that in a few more weeks everything would start getting better.
“Yes.” Cas smiled rubbing his nose against Dean’s cheek with a smile, while Dean looked at Gabriel a little sheepishly.
“Look, how about you come to mine, and I’ll take care of you, sleep it off and we’ll see how you feel later, ok?”
Dean hated Doctors before all this. He hated them even more now. He hated hospitals, and doctor’s surgeries and medical speak. If they weren’t so damn good at saving people Dean would want to punch them all in the face.
Cas sighed. His fiancé was as almost as troubled and self-loathing as he had been when they’d first met. Dean had helped Cas move away from most of his own self-worth issues, but not for lack of trying Cas had been unsuccessful in helping Dean to move past his. “Dean we’ve been through this, it’s not because I don’t love you…” Cas knew he had to be patient with Dean and his insecurities, but today was not a good day for him. The pain was worse than normal and it was grating on his nerves.
He wished Dean had never saved him, then he would never have to have hurt Dean like that. Castiel always ended up hurting the ones he loved. It was his curse. It was why he had to stop now.
“Dean we’ll find him” Sam put a hand on his brother’s shoulder and glanced back at Gabriel who was glaring at the older Winchester like he could physically smite him out of existence. “We will find him.”
Sorry to keep you waiting on this... and sorry about the excessive amount of dialogue, but hopefully this is the point you've all been waiting for. Time for our boys to use their words.
“Cas, what happened to you, does not make you disgusting.” Dean said firmly. “They are the only ones who are disgusting. You are not ruined and as for you saving yourself… Sex should be about making love Cas, what happened to you was not making love, so the way I look at it those guys haven’t taken that from you, they never could. And unless your God is a colossal asshole…”
Cas was curled on his side tightly gripping the blankets, skin pale and eyes glassy. Dean frowned as crouched by the bed and Cas looked right through him as if he couldn’t see.
She waited about 30 seconds after Dean pulled Cas in the door, looking incredibly worried and relieved to see his fiancé before she pulled away. Yeah. Dean would look after him.
Dean was still reeling from what he’d overheard. But maybe there was a good explanation. There had to be a good explanation. Please God, let there be a good explanation.
Cas nodded tearfully but didn’t say a word. She tried to help him to his feet, but Cas was barely able to take his own weight. His legs were shaking badly and that made her stomach drop again.
“I called, but you didn’t answer.” Cas said, hostility creeping into his voice that made Dean reel a little. Shit. Cas called him all the time and he didn’t answer. He checked his missed calls. Cas hadn’t actually called him in over a week. He’d given up calling.
Sorry for the late update here. Got exams coming so no guarantees when I will get the last chapter up, but it will come eventually, you have my word. I don't abandon fics.
“Well then it sounds very much like a genetic causation. Because it is such a late stage I have referred you to a specialist, they suggest you start chemotherapy almost immediately. We have a space at a clinic in Atlanta next weekend which I would very strongly suggest you take up. Time is of the essence and they will be able assess whether surgery will help.”
Quite frankly, he hated it. He hated his new job. All he wanted was to go back downstairs and tinker with the cars, talk to customers and Cas’ constant call’s and texts were grating on him to the point he just stopped answering them. He was trying to work and Cas couldn’t stop distracting him.
“We got an endorsement, so money should be fine. You can quit at the gas station… And I thought, maybe we could go out for diner this weekend.” Dean probed, praying he wasn’t going to get the response he thought he was about to.
His parents had seen their Son’s talent as a way of redeeming their family in God’s eyes from the shame of their son’s sexuality. They had taken control of everything, made him train every day, sleep early, never go out and controlled his meals to the point where he was starving. If he had a bad race, they would refuse him that day’s meals. Of course that only made things worse.
“The money doesn’t matter Dean; the garage doesn’t matter. I of all people know that sometimes you think you know what you want, but when you get it, it wasn’t what you wanted at all. It doesn’t matter, money doesn’t matter Dean. Happiness is more important than anything. I am not disappointed in you for not being happy being a manager, its not who you are, and I can see that now. I’m only disappointed that you didn’t feel you could tell me and that you felt like pulling away was a better idea that talking to me.”
“I was talking to Sam and Jody this morning. Sam’s going to take up your case as you asked him to and Jody caught three of them yesterday, they’re in prison Cas.”
“I know.” He smiled sadly. “Let’s get you back home and then maybe Deano can make you some of his infamous burgers.”
“It’s ok, I’m just… I don’t want to think about those things again, not today, I just want to go home.”
“We did 3 miles one day, he wanted to get to his favourite spot in the woods, but we barely made it. I had to carry him back to the road and then call us a cab to get back.”
“I’ve not been feeling well recently.” Cas admitted. Sam raised his eyebrow asking for more information. “Nausea, fatigue, feeling a bit dizzy. I just thought I was tired you know. I am tired. But eating just makes me feel sick, so I haven’t really been eating much.”
“Well, I’m not sure to be honest. I’ll ask him when he’s a little better. If it was up to me I’d take that cheating arsehole for everything he was worth.”
Cas grasped the letter nervously. Opening it slowly and reading it twice before putting it away again. His face was blank and his shoulders sagged, a tear tracked down his cheek.
“Sammy, nice to see you and all, but let’s start from the beginning. Why are you here? I haven’t seen you for months.”
“Don’t start that Gabriel. Dean overheard Cas on the phone planning a weekend away with a lover, he knows Cas lied about the DOD training weekend and Balthazar picked up Cas’ phone the other day. It doesn’t take a genius to figure it out.”
“I really don’t care Sam, what I care is that no one has seen him since and his phone is going straight to voicemail. Where would he go?”
Cas was silent for a long time, solemn and eyes downcast and Dean worried at his bottom lip hoping he hadn’t crossed a line.
“Yes, things have finally settled down at the shop, I should be back to regular hours.” Dean said, trying not to let his voice break with the emotions that were boiling inside him.
“You really need to go to hospital Cas.” She tried to make him see sense, but all that seemed to be flashing through his eyes was pain and panic.
When Cas woke up he couldn’t place where he was. The lights were bright and the room seemed incredibly white. There was a familiar voice breaking through the buzzing in his ears, as well as a soft beeping sound.
“And I’m going to stay to make sure you don’t smother my damn future brother in law.” Sam wake back in. “Don’t worry Cas, I’ll rescue you from these two. Just a few things to sign and we’re all good to go.”
Jody was getting increasingly worried, but she had to keep her head, there were enough people breaking down around her without her joining them.
“I’m not going to tell anyone until you want me to.” Gabriel cut him off. “You heard what the doctor said. It’s all going to be fine. We’re going to get you through this. It’s all going to be fine.”
IF you want to see these tell me in the comments and also subscribe, because when they are done I will post a new chapter n here to notify anyone who's interested. I will be finishing all my other fics before I even attempt this project, so expect quite a wait.
The phone ping was a bust. It lead them to a dumpster in the town centre, which Dean routed through, praying that all he would find was the phone and not the body of his fiancée along with it. He didn’t find a body, but he did find Cas’ wallet and his phone. So, his rapists had taken them and now they were at another dead end and it was getting dark and raining heavily.
“That’s not enough.” Cas smiled seriously as Dean heard the sound of sirens from the main road and sighed in relief. “They’re so beautiful Dean, so green and they shine. Its like the light that shimmers through the leaves in a forest, or like sunlight dances on the water… that’s why this is my favourite place Dean, it reminds me of you.” Cas sighed, and tears streaked down Dean’s face.
Gabriel had moved into the city to be closer to his baby brother. Sam and Eileen had started a family, just a few months ago she’d given birth to twins, a boy and a girl. Dean was over the moon to be an Uncle as well as a father… and yeah there was that.
His parents had ingrained the importance of him succeeding in his sport so much so that when he went to college he continued. He barely ate, trained harder than he ever had. He failed more often due to his impossible tiredness, and this meant more days when he did not eat. To Sam, Charlie and Kevin, the change in his weight had been too gradual to notice. But when he had gone to Charlie’s for dinner and Dean had seen him from the first time in months, he’d practically dragged Cas out of the room and confronted him then and there. Dean knew the difference between lean and anorexic and Cas looked ill.
Dean looked horrified and opened the fridge. “Why is there so little meat?” He protested. Then his voice dropped an octave. “Why is there so much veg?” finally he turned around eyes wide. “Where’s the pie!”
“It’s ok Cas.” Sam moved in quickly but carefully, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder. “With the evidence we have, I’m hoping your statement will be enough, and if it isn’t there are a thousand ways for you to testify without having to be in the room or deal with cross examination. Leave it to me ok, you don’t need to worry. Go enjoy yourself.”
“Gabe, go take a breather he’ll be in surgery for a few more hours yet. There’s nothing you can do here. I’ll call you if anything happens… which means I won’t be calling you, because everything is going to be fine.”
They’d had to take things slowly, even more slowly considering Cas’ recovery. They’d kept him in the hospital for nearly a month until the cancer was under better control. Then it was home to Gabriel’s and Dean had only been able to visit for a while. The Chemo eventually did cause Cas to lose his hair, but it hardly seemed to bother him.
Sam nodded, giving Dean a worried and pitiful look. The tear that slide down the freckled man’s cheek had not gone unnoticed.
“I’m saying I’ll happily go into battle for you Dean, you know I would. Every time. I will always have your back.”
“Yeah, he’s in a lot of pain. His back was bad last night and its no better this morning. He says he wants to stay in bed, but I think its something more than that, its like… His back never stopped him before, you know how stubborn he is, but honestly this morning it’s like he doesn’t want to face the world.”
“Is he ok? I mean… none of us had heard from him since he collapsed on his shift. Did the Doctors tell you what’s wrong? I don’t mean to pry but we all miss him and…”
“Cas, you mean you would live with him, even knowing he’s cheating on you?” Gabriel asked astounded.
“Then I don’t understand Dean, why haven’t I seen you for months, where have you been?” Cas asked, practically shaking with emotion, tears of relief streaming down his face.
The guy looked wrecked. He was in his usual suit, but without the coat and jacket. His dress shirt was crumpled and half unbuttoned, his tie deliberately loosened and his already untameable black hair was sticking up at all angles.
“Dean…” Cas closed his eyes and sighed, so many emotions flooded across his face and he buried his face in his hands. “Dean if you hate it you should have told me. I never want you to be unhappy Dean. I did all this, so you could be happy.”
Sam helped Cas to his feet and Eileen fetched his coat, draping it carefully over his shivering frame. They arrived at Cas and Dean’s apartment just after midnight and Sam made sure he got in safely.
“Yeah, he’s been doing better because of Dean and It wouldn’t be the first time he’s tried to...” Gabriel grunted bitterly, stopping himself
Sorry! You'll have to wait a little bit because I really have to update my other 3 stories else my followers will lynch me. Thanks for reading. Remember comments make me write faster.
It had been two weeks since Dean had proposed to him. Two weeks since he’d got in the Impala with his boyfriend and asked where they were going, to be told that it was a surprise. And it had been quite a surprise.
“There are so many ways we could fix this. We could sell to someone we trust, employ a manager and let you go back to being a mechanic…”
Cas chuckled and shook his head. “Meat is expensive, Veg is cheap and you ate the pie this morning for breakfast, which was gross by the way.”
“That’s great.” Cas smiled weakly, there was genuine happiness in his eyes. “I’ve missed you.” He said, but he didn’t move any closer. There was no intimacy between them, in fact despite his happiness at the news Cas looked a little hostile, like he was deliberately avoiding Dean.
Dean stepped awkwardly through the door with Cas in his arms and then put him down with a grunt a little heavily.
“I know, and I deserve it.” Dean nodded solemnly, and Cas took his hand. “And if I have to spend the rest of my life earning the right to love your little brother I will.” He said, looking Gabriel in the eye.
“You mentioned you would talk to him when he was better. Is there something I should know regarding your brother’s health? It is a dirty tactic to use in court, but it can prove rather effective in gaining the judges sympathy.”
“What happened was not your fault, but don’t you ever do that to us again. No matter what happens Cas, no matter what you think we think of you what you did is not ok. If anything happened to you it would kill me, it would kill all of us, do you understand?”
Ahhh, I know. The boys are being so damn stupid right now, but don't worry. This story will have a happy ending.
“Are you ok Cas?” Sam asked, sliding a hand on his brother in law’s shoulder. He’d notice Cas pull himself away from the ‘party’ if you could call it that. In reality it was a just a small gathering of their closest friends and he has been as surprised and overjoyed as the rest of them when Cas had announced he and Dean would marry next August. Gabriel was currently giving Dean the ‘you hurt my brother again and I’ll feed you your own balls fried’ speech and Dean did right to look intimidated by the 5 ft 8 ball of righteous fury. Short or not, Gabriel was scary and Sam had no doubt he would follow through on his promise. Neither did Dean judging by the sudden pale tinge to his face.
“He has another round of chemo tomorrow and then they are going to assess if surgery will be successful.”
Cas had never even had a drink, but Dean always drank, he said it helped him forget. So, Cas decided that’s what he’d do. He flagged down a cab and climbed inside.
“I’ll take your word for it.” Gabriel smirked. Balthazar was so wild he made the trickster look tame sometimes. Secretly he wondered if Castiel and Balthazar hadn’t been swapped at birth. It would make more sense if Gabriel and Balthazar were related.
“Any reason the accountant’s salary is $200 a month higher than we agreed?” Cas was too tired and now too grumpy for small talk. His pounding headache really not helping.
“We’re in Atlanta. Dean and Cas need to sort this out between themselves. Hopefully I’ll have convinced him to talk to Dean by the time you get here, if not, well, ambush it is.”
“All ours Baby.” Dean smiled at the speechless Cas, suddenly grabbing him and sweeping him off his feet.
“Cas, you hear me?” Dean tried, but there was no response. Cas’ pupils were too blown for the harsh light of the room.
“Well, it sounds to me like you’ve just run yourself into the ground and got yourself a case of the flu.” He gave Cas a thermometer. “Wait till it beeps.”
“I need to know what your brother wants from this settlement, so I can start planning for the trial.”
“What’s up with Castiel?” She asked quietly, following him to the kitchen. “He looks miserable. Where is Dean?”
But Dean just kept coming home later and later. Dinner was now in the fridge waiting, because Cas was too tired to stay up any more. Then Dean started leaving before even Cas woke up on weekdays. They still phoned each other every time Cas was on a break, but the calls became less frequent, twice a day, then just at lunch. Then the calls were just texts. ‘working late, back at 10.’ It was always midnight though before he crawled into bed beside Cas. ‘Don’t wait up.’
“He’s struggling too, there’s no point worrying him with it and we haven’t actually seen each other face to face for a few weeks. I go to bed before he gets home and one of us always leaves before the other wakes up…”
I have always intended to potentially write a prequel t this back in the college days showing how Dean and Cas got together and more about Cas' background and the injury etc. Is that something you guys want to see.
Dean backed away from the door where he’d been listening. Cas was smiling more brightly and broadly than he’d seen him since they’d first met after he’d hung up.
Jess had, had to go to work. Sam had taken the day off to stay with Dean and Jess had wanted to do the same, but he’d convinced her he’d be alright. He wasn’t sure he would though, how was he supposed to help Dean?
“Yuh n’argument.” Cas slurred. “I’m too much of a burden for him. I don’t blame him for getting angry.” Maybe that explained why Cas was at a bar. She knew he didn’t drink, but everyone had their trigger and Dean could be particularly cruel sometimes when he was angry.
“He begged me not to take him to the hospital, so I let him sleep it off at mine and then took him home in the morning, I thought Dean would look after him, convince him to go to the hospital, but well, I doubt Cas expressed himself very well and Dean assumed Cas had cheated and think you can guess the rest.”
“You two are the biggest pair of idiots I have ever met. All of this because you didn’t talk to each other!” Sam thwacked Dean round the back of the head and his older brother didn’t protest.
“You know you said if you were him…” Dean started, pulling his coat tighter around him in the cold air.
“Dean what’s going on?” Cas asked, feeling a little uneasy, but then Dean just pressed a kiss to his lips.
“Cas where the hell where you? I was so worried.” Dean opened the door and immediately pulled Cas into their flat and straight into a hug. “Thank God you’re ok. I’m so, so sorry about yesterday I was such an ass… what I said wasn’t how I meant it at all.” Dean sighed, praying that Cas would forgive him. “I just really struggle to understand you sometimes baby and I don’t always understand how you can be happy with screw up like me.”
“Shut up Balthy.” Cas chuckled, and he heard then both laughing back. “So, am I still dying?” Cas asked tiredly.
“Sam are you at home?” It had taken 2 hours to make the 3-hour journey to Sam’s house. It was a damn good Job Dean hadn’t seen a cop car., though at this stage he would hardly mind spending his night in a cell. He also knew for a fact that Sam and Jess weren’t home. He was sat outside their house, which was completely dark and lifeless as thunder cracked in the air and the rain fell.
“I’m not going to lie and say that its Ok Dean. Getting that letter… it was crushing. I nearly gave up there and then and if it wasn’t for Gabriel I wouldn’t have even bothered getting treatment.”
Just a short update this chapter, but leaving this up with only one chapter doesn't feel right, so here's a little more.
“Thank you.” Cas smiled, putting his head on Dean’s shoulder happily and dean stroked his fingers through his still re-growing hair.
“I’m so sorry, I just… I wasn’t thinking straight. All I couldn’t think about was… I felt… I feel…” Cas sighed, and Dean just pulled him closer offering a squeeze of comfort and encouragement.
“Look Cas, I’m not comfortable leaving you alone right now, will you come back to ours?” Sam asked as they arrived back at the apartment.
“No thanks. I better get back.” Cas stood up and the room span violently. Somehow, he managed to keep his feet. “Thank you for the drinks.” His voice came out slurred.
A customer soon came and snapped Cas out of his boredom, but the room was starting to spin and his head went fuzzy and he realised he’d been missing what the customer was saying to him.
“We’re all his family Gabriel. Its not just on you, its on all of us. And there’s nothing you could have done to stop it. He’s here with us now and he’s safe. We can’t change the past.”
“We’re just overworked that’s all. It’ll get better soon.” Cas said sadly. It had nearly been half a year. They’d been saying soon for a long time.
Cas had walked as far as his legs would carry him and then a little further still. Dean hated him. His brother and his friends would too. By now they would all know of his disgusting and vile behaviour. They would all hate him and even if they didn’t, he had no right to their forgiveness, no right to be in their lives. Most like likely, they wouldn’t want him there anyway.
Cas walked into the apartment and tossed his keys in the bowl. It was lunch hour, but he wasn’t hungry. The nausea and dizziness had only been getting worse, so much so he’d stopped making lunch for himself. Thinking about it, he hadn’t eaten in 3 days now, just the odd protein shake, which was about all he could stomach.
Cas nodded his understanding, but his eyes didn’t move from the spot on the wall. It was over. He’d ruined everything, lost everything. It was all his fault and worst of all he’d hurt Dean.
“I’m sorry Cas, I just didn’t think.” Dean said, mortified at his own inconsiderateness. “I’ll make sure you can see me at all times and I’ll, I won’t hold you like that…”
Cas was desperate to get home to bed. It was 11:30 and he was up 3:30 for work. But Sam obviously needed something, his face was sincere and laced with concern and he never let his friend down.
“He said it was up to you to decided what I know.” Dean bit his lip. “Just please tell me you’re not dying, just please tell me that after all of this I’m not going to lose you again.” Dean begged, trembling.
Dean had driven him to a small house for sale and told him that he’d bought it. It was beautiful, perfect, Cas couldn’t quite believe it. It took Dean 20 minutes to convince him it wasn’t a dream and then he’d got down on one knee and everything in Cas’ life had fallen into place.
“Dean, please don’t get defensive, honestly I am so proud of the way you are handling this. I know you are not a words guy and hate your chick flick moments but you are you are as amazing a fiancée as you were to me as a Dad and big brother. You are incredible Dean, I only hope one day I can be half as good as you are if Jess and I ever have kids. ”
“Yes, the garage.” Dean sighed. “I just, being the manager, it’s not what I thought it would be at all and… I hate it Cas. I hate the hours I hate the paperwork and the taxes and the dealing with customers. I missed the garage, I missed the cars, I missed Benny and the guys, so when I finished my shift and I was stressed and mad and in no fit state emotionally to come home to you I went down there, and I tinkered. Then maybe we’d go out for a few beers and it would get late and I didn’t want to come home tipsy and wake you up when I knew you were working so hard… so I stayed on Benny’s couch some nights, or just slept in the impala, or just stayed out.”
“I know.” Gabriel whispered, sadly. His gaze drifting over his little brother laid on the sofa under a blanket, the dialysis machine whirring in the background.
Cas shouldn’t have let himself sleep so long. Turns out getting 8 hours sleep in one night, when you’ve only had double that per week is a massive shock to the system. It took every ounce of will power he had to drag himself out of bed, he’d felt far, far less tired before.
“The pair of them are just the biggest idiots I have ever met. Long story short he wasn’t cheating either, just being a colossal moron.”
“Yes.” Cas sniffled. “I rang the office up one day to talk to Dean… when I found out I had the flu which well, wasn’t flu as we now know…”
Dinner. With a shift the next morning. And food. Cas didn’t feel it was a good idea, but he loved spending time with the two of them.
“I understand Cas, I do. I just hate that you’re hurt, and I hate that it is at least partially my fault.”
“Hear me out.” Dean chuckled at the mortification on Castiel’s face. “Unless God is a total asshole, which you don’t believe he is and neither do I, then that’s exactly the way he’ll see it too. It never bothered me if you were pure or not Cas, you know that. Hell, you know I’m the biggest man whore around, but I know it matters to you, so it won’t be easy, but I want you to try and believe that for me. Those people didn’t take anything from you, because it wasn’t love and you didn’t give it willingly. Your real first time, if you are ever ready for that, will be with me and I’ll make love to you Cas and then you’ll see what it should be like, how wonderful it can be. That will be your real first time, ok?”
