“I have a lot going on right now, including Peter and Synergy…I can’t really act the way I did when I saw you last…” Tony had to prevent himself from looking downward. He glanced at Steve who looked both worn and serious.
Tony groaned as he placed his hands on his hips. “I told Happy I was picking up Peter today and I totally forgot because I’m too damned stressed about this fucking project. I can’t leave this sequencing unattended though.”
Tony scrunched up his face. “Yeah, okay, dude.” He looked over at Peter again before returning to his food.
Bruce, Natasha, and Thor huddled together before walking down the hallway. Tony was left standing awkwardly next to Steve. He glanced upward at Steve with a sheepish grin.
Lupho handed Whoberis a tablet before crossing her arms. “It’s a deal. But we’ll need to get started on this soon.” Lupho responded.
“Okay, let’s get this data recorded so we can get out of here early, shall we?” Tony stayed put at his console while Steve did the same.
“Uh…are you asking me to go to this thing with you before the wedding…?” Tony finally answered back.
Steve smiled as he walked toward Tony. “I don’t mind really…they’re staying here for a couple more days before Shuri and Sam leave for their honeymoon, so I can always come back…” He offered quietly.
As it became clear that the conversation had reached a logical conclusion, everyone began to murmur to one another. Tony, still standing, looked downward at Steve before sighing heavily to himself. He glanced around the room once more before rushing out of the conference room without speaking another word.
Tony smiled at him before leaning backward. To Tony, Steve looked like the hottest mess mixed with the most innocent reticence.
Forget losing control of the original Synergy project; this impending crisis was now becoming the nightmare Tony had been dreading the most and there seemed to be no clear path ahead of him. Needless to say, as Tony quickly came up with a feasible game plan, there was too much on the line to make a snap decision in the heat of the moment.
Steve took one last look at himself before walking out of the restroom which was not too far away from the space he share with Tony at Stark Enterprises. He approached the entrance, feeling awkward about wearing the suit out in the open like that, before entering the space.
His will power was at its absolute limit; there was no way Steve would be able to keep a straight face while thinking that everyone assumed he was sleeping with Tony.
Tony then hurried out of the lab, mentally filing through which friends to bother in order to spend some time exploring his crush.
“Yeah?” Bruce stopped, “What was I talking about just now?” He dipped his eyeglasses downward, patiently waited for Tony to answer.
Steve straightened up to yank off his shirt before he went back to rubbing Tony’s crotch with one hand as the other kept feeling Tony’s chest. Steve moaned quietly as he slid a hand into Tony’s briefs, feeling around before tilting his chin up to kiss Tony.
Steve looked down at Tony’s hand before looking up, shooting Tony his own sly grin. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Tony.”
Bruce adjusted his eyeglasses. “I remember reading in the Synergy archive that there was a possibility that the device could be compromised based on some issues related to its original design. The failsafe was only used to protect against that.”
“I, uh, should have Fury send S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to Stark Tower in the offices and labs at Stark Industries…and of course at May’s…” Tony’s voice cracked as he thought about trying to keep Peter safe from all of this.
Steve looked around. He saw a woman, probably near his age, wearing all black. Steve commented to himself how strikingly red her hair was. Next to her was a man who appeared to be a bit older. He fidgeted uncomfortably; he constantly readjusted his eyeglasses and peered around the room as if to make note of the closest means of escape. The red-haired woman next to him noticed before whispering something to him in another language. Steve thought it sounded like Russian.
“No, he doesn’t talk about it because he’s taking himself too seriously. Although you refuse to get a smartphone, I’m not surprise you’re already a star player, Cap.”
As soon as Tony reached his intended destination, he stopped to glare at Steve who was now sitting up in the middle of the bed.
“…we need to use Synergy to stop whatever this weapon is capable of…the only thing is if we push the device beyond its current limits to combat whatever Thanos is cooking up, it could make the device unstable even with the vibranium core…”
“Hey, uh, Peter’s still here if you would like to say goodnight, Rogers…he’s inside with May, probably in my office…”
Tony’s answer barely satisfied the team as Fury then began explaining possible next steps. Both Tony and Steve remained silent as the rest of the team discussed the options. As soon as the conversation ended, Tony marched out of the conference room without saying a word, and Steve quickly followed him. Despite whatever personal conflict they were having, Steve knew he needed to apologize to Tony for arguing over Synergy in front of the team.
Tony’s smile widened a little, but then he shook his head. “No, your buddy just got married. You should really hang out here, Rogers.”
Tony sighed. “Steve…this…it can’t…I don’t think…” His breath hitched before he could continue, looking up at Steve to try to express solemnity as much as possible, but he knew his external expression would betray him.
Steve hobbled down the hallway and into the kitchen. As he approached the opening, he found Peter and one of his friends playing a game on the floor. Steve smiled at them as he entered.
He felt Strange place a hand on his shoulder. “Do we ever know what we’re doing? Every new event in life forces us to start over. No one is ever really good at anything unless they try.”
Tony looked at Steve intently. “I supposed that could be a possibility. I wouldn’t put it past Obie to work with someone so shady.”
The two men walked through an empty hallway that was attached to the foyer; it looked as if the rowhouse had been subdivided to fit a subdued bar-like atmosphere. As they continued, the dimmed lighting increased with intensity; they heard some instrumental music playing in the background, beginning softly before reaching a comfortable level for people to chat over.
They walked to the restaurant which wasn’t too far away from the subway stop, chatting about nothing really until they arrived. Tony had never been so nervous before about having dinner with someone, and it wasn’t like it was a date. Well, he wasn’t sure anyway; they still hadn’t verbally agreed on it. Yet, it did feel more than just two friends sharing a meal, so Tony took it as it was.
“The device is generating the detonator!” Tony shouted as he and the rest of the group ran up to the helicopter; its propellers already whirling, “we need to get off this island now!”
Steve stayed on the edge, twirling his phone around. He reminded himself to be patient with Tony when it came to their relationship and that he needed to give him some more time.
Steve laughed again as he sat up in the tub, watching Tony run back over. As soon as Tony was within reach, Steve grabbed him by the waist, positioning him on top of his body. Tony held onto Steve as his body went under water, his top half out of the water against Steve’s. Tony wrapped both arms around Steve’s shoulders and both gasped as their bodies rubbed up against each other. Tony attacked Steve with a flurry of kisses as he humped Steve’s body. He gripped onto Steve harder than usual from how intense the feeling was but Steve barely noticed as he held onto Tony tighter, using both hands to squeeze Tony’s ass and guide it along his body.
Tony bit Steve’s bottom lip before moving his head away somewhat. “I’m going to sound so juvenile and silly saying this, but I really enjoy making out with you…” He grinned, still holding onto Steve’s face.
How could they possibly work together? Tony was right that Steve would stop at nothing to save Synergy but that was before they grew distant.
Steve rode in the passenger seat, listening to Tony, as they drove to the house in the Hamptons. Steve had never been to this part of Long Island before; he marveled at the rolling landscape as they drove along. And although Tony appeared calm, ever since they dropped Peter off earlier that day, Steve could tell that he was not at ease.
Peter began rattling off potential dishes he had seen Tony eat a few times as Steve drove off toward the Tower.
“We’re not friends, or even beyond that,” Steve angrily cut Tony off, “we’re barely work colleagues, okay? I’m here because of the team and Synergy,
“Look, Tony…” Bucky hung his head as he sighed to himself, “ever since Steve broke up with his ex-girlfriend, I’ve been maybe a little more than over protective of his feelings…uh...Steve is usually
“We talk from time to time. She even called to congratulate me on getting into Synergy…” Steve sighed.
Tony nodded but then he groaned loudly, remembering the same advice Pepper had given him a while back.
“No, it’s okay, Steve.” Pepper responded with a smile, squeezing Tony’s shoulder before walking up to Steve.
. Tony thought to himself as he tried to return the smile which ended up being a lot more difficult than he had expected.
Rhodey clasped Fury’s shoulder. “I don’t think it could have gone any better.” He looked over at Pepper who was smiling.
Steve opened his eyes and observed an unrestrained Tony, doubled over clenching his sides. Steve stared, incredulous, as he waited for Tony to regain control over himself. Eventually, Tony slapped his hands on the table in front of him as if the table were holding him up from the uproarious bout of laughter.
He walked up quickly to the console, producing an instrument he usually used to hack codes. He looked behind himself again, accidentally dropping the instrument on the floor, swearing loudly. He looked behind himself once more, waiting a moment before continuing to break into the device.
Steve grinned the silliest grin; although it was a straightforward note, something about it felt quite personal and intimate. He slumped downward into the bed still holding the hand-written note. He read it over a few more times before exhaling happy, ready to fully embrace the day.
Natasha smiled as she reached out to rub his shoulder. “Clint, I’m sorry to ask you this,” she then sat backward in her chair, “but do you remember anything from that night?” Her facial expression had turned grim.
“There’s no slowing down in the real world, Rogers.” Tony was now hovering in his space, trying to take over control of the device. He nearly shoved Steve to the side.
Tony patted Pepper on the shoulder as she handed him the microphone. Tony took a moment before flashing a smile at the crowd as a projection showing a series of a diverse set of faces filled the space.
Also, if he confessed to Steve that he loved him, would Steve even say it back? There was no way Tony was going to put himself in that position especially after the huge fight they just had. No, he would just wait; everything was just as fine as it was.
Tony hugged Steve close to his body as he placed a hand at the base of his spine. He took Steve’s hand before they started swirling around with the other couples. After a few moves with Tony leading, Steve immediately picked up on the dance which then transferred into him taking the lead.
Bruce looked around nervously as he hung back with Tony behind the group before walking to the elevator.
Steve couldn’t help smiling back at his friend as he did his best to clink their plastic glasses together.
"S-Steve's…" Tony couldn't finish his counter statement. Of course, Steve was his boyfriend but the mocking tone in Obadiah's voice made him feel awful for even thinking that he and Steve had a chance.
Steve sighed agonizingly to himself as he saw Tony already working in the lab as he approached. He looked downward at his wristwatch, taking note that the time was earlier than usual for Tony. Steve paused for a moment, standing at the entrance of the lab before entering.
Tony chuckled. “Peter’s been talking about asking you to be in this thing for a while now.” The comment made Peter’s face turn beet red.
“Every single person I meet who knew my dad always tells me how much of a father figure he was to them. I used to lie when I was younger…reminiscing about my time with him as if we
“Are you going to be okay, baby?” Tony asked Steve, with a cheeky smile, trying to force himself to remember that they were pretending to be married.
Tony returned to his phone which was now facing down again on his desk. He flipped it over and swiped once until the message from Pepper appeared. Tony sighed before he typed out an affirmative reply. He really needed Pepper when it came to dealing with Obadiah and he figured he owed her dinner and an update on Peter.
Earlier that day, Tony had been doing damage control with Pepper and Fury: signing off on press releases and the necessary paperwork and phoning anxious investors. It would take several months, maybe a year or two to close out the team’s correspondences.
Peter tapped a few times on a tablet. The robot emitted a humming noise before straightening up after a few seconds. Peter flashed a smile over at Steve who looked concerned based on past experiences. Tony clapped his hands as he stepped toward the robot.
Rhodey chuckled as he patted Steve on the shoulder before leaving the circle. Tony watched Rhodey leave before turning to face Steve.
Strange held out a clipboard to read Tony’s medical chart. “We had to do some extensive reconstructive surgery on your arm which had been severely injured in the blast…” he took a moment as he read down the chart, “everything else is fine, but I suggest taking it easy for about a month.”
Steve stayed on the bed, looking straight up at the ceiling, wondering to himself how he was going to get through this trip.
“Another loss. When did you get so smart?” Tony hugged Peter as the latter bounced around in his lap.
“Okay!” Peter jogged out of the kitchen to his room, leaving Tony alone, sulking over Steve and Peter missing each other.
Tony could feel his face growing hot; so hot that he had to keep one hand on the armrest of his chair to steady himself.
The room went noticeably quiet as Shuri then tapped on the tracker again, slowly and carefully, to find the weapon’s precise location.
Steve laughed as he watched Tony walk into the bathroom. He tried sitting up again, but then fell back down on the bed, groaning loudly from the pain shooting up his body.
“Please set yourself up over there. And don’t touch anything.” Tony pointed toward a console near a table, ignoring his lab mate’s bewilderment. Steve winced as he walked over toward the console and set his things down on a nearby table. The table was disorganized, but Steve figure he could clean it up after Tony felt comfortable enough for him to contribute.
Steve’s seemingly unwillingness to come clean about everything up until that point made Tony tilt his head backward as he scrunched up his face.
, not the other way around.” Tony pointed back at Steve before turning around to walk away from him. He exhaled before placing his hands on his hips. By this time, the rest of the team remained absolutely still.
He walked over to one of the dressers, opening the top drawer before continuing. “If he asks, just tell him I went with the plan.” He chuckled as he turned around with a huge sheet of paper.
“Oh, and…” Tony snapped back to attention, “let’s try not to blow ourselves up or get arrested before Shuri’s epic wedding, okay?”
After some time, they finished eating. Tony announced that he needed to shower before resuming unpacking, so Steve followed him back to their room.
Tony sighed before mustering up a genial expression he usually saved for fans. He turned around to face whomever had addressed him.
Tony laughed quietly before answering. “…okay, yes. I agree with you…” He shrugged with another laugh before pulling Steve back on top of him, “…I’m your boyfriend, Rogers.” He teased, but managed to convey his sincerity.
The female board member acknowledged Obadiah with a curt nod, but Pepper ignored him as she turned to face Tony who appeared to be on the verge of bursting through the seams with anger.
“So,” Tony began, “we have today and a good deal of tomorrow. Today, let’s finish in the living room and the dining room, then we can start on my old room and the basement. Sound good?”
Tony shook his head as he scooted against Steve to pull him down into the bed. “No, it’s more than all right, Rogers.”
“It’s morning, Tony.” Steve answered, not really hiding underneath the blankets but he had them drawn up to his neck.
Steve smiled shyly at him. “I didn’t want to assume, but thank you, Tony. I think I have cake for dessert back at my place.”
Tony held his hands up in halting position. “Sorry, everyone. I’m not here to give a speech. But,” he pointed to the exits, “I do need everyone to calmly walk out of the space. We have reason to believe that this place is rigged with a highly unstable explosive…”
Steve followed Tony all the way to his office, stopping the door from slamming in his face with his foot. He pushed the door open to find Tony standing in the middle of the office with his arms crossed.
“Hey, Stark!” Clint appeared behind Tony, slapping him on the back as he entered the space, “thanks for getting the team back together.”
Tony stood in place, now waiting for anyone to add to the conversation, but it appeared, after a moment of complete silence, that the conversation had ended. One of the women’s associates walked up to Tony, motioning for him to exit the room. Tony continued to smile before spinning around to exit the room. As soon as he was out in the hallway, the door slammed shut behind him, nearly knocking him off balance.
The night before had been amazing, there was no denying that. Tony had never felt so close to someone before. However, based on his own actions since they started speaking again, Tony was beginning to think he wasn’t right for Steve. Something about Steve made him feel exposed, more exposed than he had ever been with anyone, but Tony couldn’t seem to handle that vulnerability gracefully as he tried to get back some semblance of a relationship with Steve.
“Rogers, I understand why you’re nervous, but I really don’t think we’re in any danger…” He stepped in front of Steve, sliding his hands up and down the latter’s arms.
About a week ago, while working late with Tony, Steve realized there was something more to his relationship with his lab mate, maybe something beyond a friendship. What that entirely meant, he wasn’t sure. He hadn’t told anyone how he was feeling, not even Sam or Bucky. He had always been this cautious; he wanted to explore where this was going first before jumping the gun.
“I…was in an ad…thing once for the military.” Steve answered reluctantly, hoping that would satisfy Tony.
“How many planets are in the solar system?” Peter looked at Tony as he carefully finished his question.
Tony nodded as he waited for Steve to finally get to door. Steve fumbled a bit as he tried to open it as if that was the first time he had ever unlocked their apartment door.
Tony gasped loudly. Steve thought it sounded like someone had hit him from behind. “You’re not use to smartphones or tablets and
“Sir, may I remind you that Mr. Rogers has advised against any possible dangerous work.” J.A.R.V.I.S. responded.
Thanos kept grinning as he interlaced his fingers. “Just long enough until he delivers us the device. Then we’ll cut him loose.”
Steve groaned, confused about what to do. He had trouble trying to reconcile his feelings toward Tony while also seeing Sharon. And it didn’t help that Tony appeared to be angry with him, although he had been the one to call things off between the two of them.
“It’s strange that nothing’s come across Pepper’s desk since Malibu. But it’s good to stay alert, especially with this press thing.”
Although a little late, Tony fulfilled his promise in picking up Peter who was more than excited to see him earlier than expected. As Tony drove, he kept playing over and over how he would bring up the subject of having Steve over for dinner, mindful of sounding as causal as possible.
“Maybe I’ll eat lunch with you two when you get back.” Tony offered, trying to sound as calm as possible.
Nebula looked down at her sister’s hand on her arm before yanking away. “Don’t let father hear you say that. He’ll get rid of you before Stane.” She answered sharply.
Steve stopped short before addressing Tony. He thought back to the framed photograph of his teammate in Obadiah’s office.
Steve nodded as they walked briskly toward their lab. “Right. I’ll coax my way into trying to get some more details about Loki.”
Steve accepted it. He turned the mug around in his hand until he met the handle, shyly smiling back at Tony.
Tony’s eyes lit up. Something about Steve telling him this piece of personal information felt like he was making a breakthrough.
“Yes, of course, Mr. Stark.” The staffer quickly motioned for everyone to follow her until they found the aforementioned conference room.
“This is really great so far.” Bruce had unintentionally let out, immediately regretting it and hoping he didn’t sound desperate.
As it appeared that Pepper was there to stay, Obadiah looked at her before holding up a finger at the press pool, shielding the microphone with one hand.
Nebula spun around as she marched down the hallway away from Gamora who was left standing alone, mentally fighting with herself over the current state of their father’s mission to build a super weapon that would destroy and kill millions…
Silence enveloped them both as Steve could feel the tension rise between himself and Tony again. He shuffled on the bed with a cough, waiting for Tony to respond.
“That’s wonderful, Tony. What time do you need me to come over?” Pepper added before he could ramble on about dinner any further. She sounded sincerely happy for him.
“Tony,” Bruce started, “we need to be careful. The energy from Thanos’s weapon can trip the device’s reactionary blast, which will then cause it to self-destruct.”
Steve’s eyes grew wider. Also, for some annoying reason, once Tony mentioned his undisclosed warehouse in Queens, Steve’s brain triggered the memory of the two of them dancing at the mansion in Malibu before they met with those buyers on the black market. Steve shook his head, telling himself to focus.
Tony gently maneuvered his body so that he was now lying halfway on top of Steve. “Yeah, but even more so since I got to know you better…” He smiled sweetly down at Steve who reciprocated the expression.
Tony shrugged. “I’m always fine with pizza.” The comment caused Peter to nod emphatically in agreement.
T’Challa waved at everyone, smiling, clearly happy to be giving his sister away. They walked up to Sam who was standing next to a Wakandan minister at the altar. T’Challa gave both Sam and Shuri a hug before sitting down next to his mother.
As soon as Tony walked into the main space of Stark Enterprises, he saw Steve chatting with Thor next to a cluster of consoles. Tony clammed up at the entrance, forgetting all that encouragement he had given himself earlier. He stood paralyzed, staring at Steve for some time.
However, everyone else just stared at him as if he were an alien from outer space. Obadiah returned the stare before clapping his hands together, cracking a huge fake smile.
Steve only nodded but remained silent; he wasn’t sure what to say without sounding like a total idiot. Now he felt extremely silly and was sure he wasn’t hiding it well, but either Tony wasn’t aware or chose to ignore it.
Steve breathed heavily as he pushed downward harder into Tony. Tony fought the urge to touch himself; he wanted to come by just grinding against Steve while holding him. Steve pulled on Tony’s neck as he inhaled then exhaled. Tony felt his body shake; he knew Steve was close, but he didn’t want to rush him.
Tony moaned again as he felt Steve’s hand travel underneath his shirt, rubbing the top half of his body before Steve began yanking the shirt off. Tony sat up to let Steve tug his shirt off, now basically straddling Steve’s lap. Steve wrapped one hand around Tony to lie him back down on the bed on his back. Tony pushed upward into his body with both legs drawn up against Steve’s sides.
It was the afternoon before the investor event that evening, and Tony was on his way to meet Obadiah and Pepper in one of the smaller conference rooms in Stark Tower. He took the private express elevator from the penthouse to the designated floor, dreading the meeting but thankful that Pepper would be there to facilitate a buffer between himself and Obadiah.
He used two fingers to zoom in, too focused on what he was doing. His other hand accidentally bumped a folder that contained some of his older photos, automatically displaying the photo he had taken of himself and Steve at Steve’s law school graduation.
Shuri patted Tony on the shoulder before walking over to her table. Tony watched her before turning to the console, now thinking about how to resolve things with Steve before the latter arrived at Stark Enterprises later that day. He thought maybe he should tell Steve that he wanted to be friends, but he wasn’t sure how to convey that without sounding desperate. Tony mulled over possible entry points of conversation as he went back to work.
dating. They still needed to discuss their relationship. However, it felt like this dinner with Peter would either make or break whatever their relationship status currently was.
Tony remained on his forearms before getting up to sit down in his chair, opposite from Steve. He thought about teasing him more but decided against it considering that it was obvious Steve hadn’t appreciated him using an untested device on his face.
For the board event, the company had rented out a nice lounge located in an old historic fraternity lodge in midtown. The board usually held these events to placate investors and woo new ones, but Tony hoped the event would also boost morale amongst his team. The board had also taken the opportunity to invite other companies in the tech industry, much to Tony’s chagrin; he had the feeling he would have an unfortunate run-in, but with whom, he wasn’t sure.
“No worries, Mr. Rogers. Nice to see you again.” Mr. Beck stood up out of his chair to shake Steve’s hand.
A bit later, Tony found himself alone in the kitchen with Pepper, chatting about everything besides work.
Gamora waited as Nebula rejoined her by the fireplace. “My father wanted us to thank you for your help. Despite all the setbacks, he wouldn’t have gotten to where he was without your…assistance.” Nebula smiled at Obadiah who looked too shocked to respond.
Tony moaned loudly as Steve held onto his body, pushing hard inside of him, moaning with every single push.
Steve smiled up at Tony as he rested his hands on his hips before moving one upward to bring Tony down closer to his face.
Steve nodded as he kissed Tony once more before Tony led them to his bedroom. As they entered the room, Tony kissed Steve, dragging him to the bed. The force of the pull caused Steve to fall on top of him, but they hardly missed a beat as they continued to make out, the energy between the two of them becoming more passionate with every move.
Tony groaned as he put his head into his hands with his elbows on top the table. He felt a hand caress his arm.
well, Rogers. On the outside, you ooze innocence, bravery, patriotism, whatever,” Tony was waving one of his arms about as he proceeded to give a physiological run down of Steve, “but…” he then turned around slightly before placing on hand on Steve’s thigh, “on the inside, you’re
Tony took a deep breath, realizing that he might have made a bigger deal about the museum visit than he should have earlier that morning.
Tony made a face before looking down at his shoes. It was true that if he hadn’t stopped them, they probably would have slept together that night. But it wasn’t as if Tony had forgotten that crucial piece; he was more fixated on being open finally with someone about his dad.
As Tony read off the figures, Steve could sense that his lab mate was trying to be careful not to trip him up while also reading as fast as possible. Steve quickly typed in the data; he was amazed with how efficient he had become with the machine hardware.
, this is probably more on Steve than you. Maybe he was embarrassed? I don’t know him that well, but my conversation with him at Thor’s party suggested that he wasn’t the type to take things too casually.”
“Project Synergy.” The title flashed across a projection on the wall behind Fury. A diverse group of faces looped in the background as the title continued to fly about. The images moved from the center of the room to the side walls as scenes of various types of natural disasters, human ailments, and catastrophes filtered throughout the room.
Although Steve’s face flushed even more from the offer, he could feel a tingly sensation in his body as he mulled over the idea. Sex with Tony was great, but the thought of having more than one orgasm right after the other with Tony was something he couldn’t possibly pass up. Also, Steve knew that Tony would take his time with him like he usually did and would stop if there were any sign that he was uncomfortable.
Pepper stopped before continuing. Tony heard her take a deep breath. “…you were caring and attentive at first, Tony, but it became clear as our relationship progressed that…you didn’t love me the way that I loved you. In retrospect—from our third date, remember? You told me we would probably get married, but I don’t think you were ever serious…”
“…Peter asks about him all the time…he was so upset when I told him Steve and I broke up…and I didn’t realize how much I cared—care about Steve until it was too late…but I think I can get him back…something about seeing him again makes me feel like maybe I have a chance, you know?”
Tony repositioned his body to lie halfway on top of Steve, pushing downward slightly to rub up against his leg. They remained like this: Steve moving his hands up along Tony’s body and Tony using one hand to cradle the back of Steve’s head while the other was rubbing against the inside of his hip. Steve bucked upward into Tony as he scooted up the bed, drawing his legs up against Tony’s sides as he placed his hands on Tony’s face.
Bruce walked up to Steve and shook his hand before stepping to the side to let Shuri hug him, even though she had seen Steve once or twice when Bucky and Sam came to visit him.
Tony slowly withdrew his hand from the back of Steve’s chair before accepting the map. Steve mentally exhaled with relief.
Tony busied himself as J.A.R.V.I.S. began playing one of Tony’s favorite playlists on moderate volume throughout the lab, complete with Robin S’ “Show Me Love” at the start.
“I…uh…I…” Steve stammered a bit until their waiter came over, unaware that he had, once again, saved them both from another bout of tensed humiliation.
“Fine,” he hung his head, “but I’m counting on you guys to keep this under control before Ned gets here,” Steve pointed directly at Tony, “I’m holding
Tony moaned quietly into Steve’s mouth as their kiss moved slowly. Tony’s hand that had been placed on Steve’s back was now on his waist before he slid it downward to rub Steve’s hip. Steve pulled Tony even closer, which caused Tony to rub a little against his leg. The kiss deepened between them before Tony broke away, somewhat surprised by the intensity.
“Oh yeah, that’s the best part, Steve.” Bruce dipped his eyeglasses downward to look at Steve. He noticed that the older man appeared to be studying him.
“I’m aware, Nebula. However, whatever caution you exude often gets trampled by your penchant for anger.” Gamora scoffed at her sister.
Tony could feel his chest restricting with pain again; he told himself to cool it, breathing deeply until he heard the elevator arrive.
Tony walked through the lab as J.A.R.V.I.S. ran a list of items that hadn’t been irreparably damaged from the explosion. He walked around for a few minutes before he spotted something J.A.R.V.I.S. had missed, seeing something poking out from the debris.
Tony stared down at Steve’s hand, not entirely sure what to do. But after a moment, he finally reached out, taking a hold of Steve’s hand. They held hands for some time before their waiter appeared with their food.
Natasha was standing in the entrance to Dr. Selvig’s lab. The scientist was working at a console with his back turned toward her, but he didn’t budge.
what you’re capable of. Thanos has been using you to evade detection this entire time. How can we take your word that you’re no longer working for him?”
Both Tony and Steve raced each other to the private express elevator. As soon as Tony scanned his fingerprints for access, Steve pushed him up against the back wall of the elevator shaft. They made out as the elevator flew past the floors before reaching Tony’s penthouse.
Tony took a moment before answering. “I would love to go. Thank you for inviting me.” He grinned as the band finished the song. They stopped dancing but lingered before pulling apart.
Tony rolled his eyes before he looked at Steve. “Rogers, I’m not the one who said we were barely work colleagues.”
Tony inhaled as Steve kissed him, moving their bodies back to their positions from before. Steve held onto Tony’s legs as he let Tony rub his cock. He gasped as he felt himself getting hard, rocking forward into Tony’s hand.
Tony locked eyes with Fury, his face becoming flush with anger. “Obie.” He responded sharply before marching out of the space with Steve quickly following him.
Steve groaned as he leaned forward to place his head in his hands again. Sam reached over to pat him on his back.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Okay, I’ll do it first. Just relax, you big baby.” He smirked at Steve before holding the device underneath his chin, taking a huge deep, dramatic breath.
“Hey! I’m home!” Tony shouted, dropping his work bag on the floor as soon as the elevator doors opened into the penthouse.
Tony nodded as he reached for his coffee, still not sure what he wanted. “Thanks for the advice, Rhodes…”
Steve watched his lab partner manipulate the image just like Bruce had done, but Tony was quicker with the controls. He hummed to himself as he studied the data on the screen, flipping through hardware and software specs with ease.
Steve watched Obadiah watch Tony cross the balcony. The older man sneered before turning toward Steve again. Steve felt like leaving too, but he didn’t want to make a huge scene.
Thor coughed a few times which caused both Steve and Tony to twist around and visibly direct their wrath toward him.
“Fury,” Tony barged back onto the helm, “it’s the tech expo thing on Roosevelt Island. Thanos had Obie take the weapon there.”
Steve struggled to wake up as the sunlight from outside pierced through the bedroom curtains. He sat up in the bed with a yawn before he noticed that Tony was missing.
He held out a tablet, tapping on it a few times. “J.A.R.V.I.S., scan this area. See if there’s anything I can salvage.”
haven’t you managed to find out for me, Obadiah? Hopefully, this meeting will be more productive than the last.”
Tony dusted off his phone before glaring at Bruce; he knew he was right. Although he was sure Loki was withholding information that would implicate Obadiah, he never explicitly said so which might backfire on Tony in the future.
Bruce laughed quietly. “I was trying to convey the seriousness of the situation without giving away too much. But like I said, I think it helped.”
Steve swallowed; he knew Tony was referring to the guy he had been in a terrible relationship with when he was younger. Steve slowly turned around on his other side to face Tony.
Steve rocked forward for a second or so before taking a hold of his cock to enter Tony. Tony inhaled sharply as Steve entered; he nearly fell over on top of Tony from the feeling.
“Well, if it’ll make you feel any better. I’ve been in quite a few relationships and as you can see, none of them worked out.” He teased again as he kept his hand on Steve’s waist, now rubbing more firmly.
Pepper and Tony looked at each other again as Natasha walked further into the office. She perched herself against one of the bookshelves, holding a manila envelope in one hand.
With a frustrated groan, Tony turned over onto his side to face the side of the bed where Steve usually slept. He hated it whenever they were apart, especially at night. Tony groaned again as he turned over onto his back to stare up at the ceiling.
Tony smiled. “Well, I was only doing to you what I would like done to me…” he looked downward at himself before looking back at Steve.
Rhodey nodded with a yawn. “It was a little tiring. I almost missed my flight in from D.C., but Pepper and I managed to get in with some time to spare.”
“Someone at your party…” Steve looked downward at his shoes, “…well…basically…in a conversation during the party…ugh—someone, who was at the party, thinks we’re sleeping together.”
“…imagine the possibilities…” Tony waited for the faces to change again, “medical, military, perhaps cosmetic?” Tony winked at the crowd which earned him a spate of laughter.
Both friends were leaning up against the railing. Bucky was holding a half-empty bottle of beer, while Steve was drinking a glass of water. After hanging out at the informal graduation party at the bar with Tony, the three friends went back to the apartment in Brooklyn to capitalize on Bucky’s visit before he left in the morning to finish the rest of his tour.
“And, Tony!” T’Challa greeted as soon as Tony came up to him, “so wonderful to have you here before the wedding.”
Tony chuckled, kissing Steve before propping himself up again. “Okay, wait. Let me do it right.” He sat up, holding the box out toward Steve.
Tony laughed. “Hey! It’s a compliment. Your massages are so good it feels like I’m on the brink of an orgasm.” He held up his hands to side with a shrug as if that were commonplace language.
The lobby was empty save for the security guard at the front desk. On the way over, Steve scolded himself for not calling first. He knew he should have called, but he didn’t want to run the risk of Tony not answering. He thought that if maybe Tony saw him in the lobby, he would see that Steve was truly sincere about making amends.
“But,” Gamora pushed herself away from the fireplace as she walked up to Obadiah, “I’m afraid your tenure with us has come to an end.” She then pointed her silencer to the middle of his forehead.
“Is this why you were avoiding me the rest of the night?” Tony asked casually, turning to face a projection above the console.
“I can get you what you need. I have to pick up Peter from May’s anyway.” He said as he reached out a hand to help Steve into the chair.
At this moment, the hired orchestra for that night’s evening began playing a version of “3 Pièces pour orchestre”. Tony placed his drink on the counter behind them before walking forward. He turned around, reaching his hand out toward Steve who looked puzzled.
Tony nodded as he joined Steve at the console. “Well, it was definitely easier after the last time we had to rebuild it.”
Tony nodded. “After you, Rogers.” He waited for Steve to walk ahead of him further before following, ascending the stairs before entering the cabin.
Steve nodded as he kissed Tony’s neck. “I love you, too, Tony.” He rubbed Tony’s body as he moved his head to kiss Tony on the lips.
“We have way too many people on the board who would also resign if we pushed him out. We can’t risk that, especially after having started this new project.”
After a meeting at S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony was in the lab with Steve working on some sequences to run on the device before locking it down for the time being unless there was an urgent emergency.
Tony sighed, hanging his head as he attempted to pull Steve toward his body. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it that way…it’s more like…well…”
Steve waited to say his lines as images depicting scenarios the device could be used in projected onto screen behind them.
It was the day of Steve’s graduation and Tony had spent the entire morning trying to figure out what to wear to look like he hadn’t spent the entire morning figuring out what to wear. As he shuffled through outfit to outfit, he kept replaying his chat with Steve from the beginning of week. Something about it bothered him; was it so bad to think people possibly thought that they were sleeping together? Tony intellectually knew why Steve was concerned, but emotionally he felt hurt.
“I can’t believe we’re getting to see the Synergy device in action...” The intern had loudly whispered to the nurse, earning a grimace considering how grave the situation was.
After giving the presentation a few times over the past couple weeks, Steve and Tony had figured out a narrative that had a solid structure but could be easily rifted upon. And Steve, quite surprised with how comfortable he was beginning to feel, found himself improvising more than usual.
Yet, Tony was still incredibly terrified of fucking up his parental responsibilities. The day of the interview, however, he had forgotten that he needed to be at Peter’s school later in the day for a parent-teacher meeting, so his attention was divided while the others took control of the law student’s interview. Tony had felt somewhat terrible about not fully participating, but it sounded like the student knew what he was talking about and he seemed reserved and a willing team player. If only he had remembered where Steve attended law school…
“Steve…” Tony hung his head as Steve joined him at the railing, but stayed at a distance, “…I’m not really sure what we’re both trying to get out of this…”
Having Loki arrested was supposed to be a distraction. However, somehow the agents at S.H.I.E.L.D. managed to figure out that Dr. Selvig had also been involved.
“Didn’t know I was that popular.” Steve answered, but Tony could sense that he was genuinely surprised by the comment.
After waiting a second to let J.A.R.V.I.S. create a sequence, Tony walked Steve through the algorithm. Steve did his best to comprehend as much as possible, jotting down every word that sounded unfamiliar to him so he could study it later. At points Tony slowed down to explain something further which Steve appreciated. After a while, however, he could tell that his lab mate was getting a little antsy about having to move so slowly, yet Tony remained mostly calm.
“Who came up with the idea?” As soon as Bruce finished his question, Tony nearly choked on his drink, spilling some of the cocktail on his shirt. Bruce made a noise as he hopped out of the way.
Tony lifted the fingerprint scanner in the elevator to take him to the penthouse. He could feel his heart sink as the elevator carried him floor by floor.
Steve glanced at Bucky with an apprehensive expression before hanging his head low. “I’m so bad at dating…”
Tony sat up bit before answering. “The time in car—,” his eyes widened as it became clear that he had realized what Steve was referring to.
“Uh, my apologies.” Obadiah took a handkerchief out of his breast pocket to wipe the beads of sweat off his forehead, “I’ve seemed to forgotten that our esteemed CEO, Virginia Potts, has a few words to say…”
“So…” Steve began as he regained control over himself, telling himself to remain as calm as possible, “how can I help you?”
Tony waited before sighing. “Remember when I took Rogers with me to the west coast for that tech conference a while back?”
Natasha stared at him for a moment or so before it became obvious that he was unwilling to cooperate.
Memories of working with Tony and spending time together with Peter filtered in through Steve’s thoughts. He closed his eyes shut, telling himself that it was over, and he needed to move on.
Tony inhaled then exhaled deeply. He felt so stupid for even bringing it up. Tony had spent his entire weekend replaying the night over and over, reassessing his moves, wishing he had stopped them both in the elevator.
“Yeah, okay, Rogers. I get that you’re cute and sweet even when inebriated.” Tony smirked, running a hand through Steve’s hair. The move had been initially innocent on Tony’s part, yet a grab at Tony’s wrist by Steve made it more suggestive.
Tony exhaled with relief, but just enough to himself to not cause a scene. “Thanks, Banner. I really appreciate it.”
Yet, this was the moment he had been fantasizing about: finally seeing Tony again. And just in that one moment, Steve was experiencing so many emotions and feelings. He cared about Synergy and the team. He also cared about Tony, no matter what happened between them. When they worked well together, they were great. And even though they had their rough moments, they also found a way to work through their differences together.
This was the first time they had seen each other in person since the night Tony had made a move on Steve. Serendipitously, Tony had gotten caught up at Stark Industries with a few projects that needed to roll out before leaving for the wedding, and Steve also needed to finish some prep work for a few cases before they left, so neither had been at Stark Enterprises for some time.
“Okay, let’s try standing up straight, shall we?” Tony chuckled as he held onto Steve before his lab partner toppled over. He gently pinned Steve up against one of the inside walls of the private express elevator in Stark Tower, resting a hand on the small of his back. Steve giggled; the usually moderate drinker was reeling from the number the Jörmungandr had done on his constitution.
Tony sighed as he turned a few degrees to look at Bruce before turning to face Fury again. “It’s only been built once. Could have been a problem with the circuity.”
“Jesus, Banner,” Tony slapped a hand to his forehead, “I was having sex with Steve. We were fucking, not eating. You’re so nosy.”
Tony was sitting in a chair at a desk in his lab, hunched over a tablet. He figured he could try to get in a few more minutes of work before turning in for the evening to eat dinner with Peter.
Steve let his body grind against the mattress and bunches of sheets for a bit, until he realized that this mattress smelled
Tony sighed as he patted Steve on the arm. “Oh my god, chill, Cap. I’m trying to alleviate an already tensed situation.” He responded with an eye roll, not really sure with himself whether he was referring to the situation with Loki or Bucky moving in with Steve.
“Rogers, you’re with me. I’m going to use this presentation on the face thing to calmly alert everyone about what’s happening.” Steve nodded as followed Tony out of the conference room.
The whispering set Tony off who then pushed upward sharply against Steve. His thrusts quickened with Steve’s as both men pressed against each other until both bodies began trembling. They continued like this for a moment or so before Tony could feel his body succumbing. He held onto Steve as tightly as possible without hurting him.
Tony leered at Bruce, chuckling to himself before changing the topic of conversation much to Bruce’s relief.
Bruce hung his head low before looking back up at Tony. “I’m so sorry, Tony, but I had promised a colleague of mine that I would attend a conference this weekend. I thought it was next weekend.”
“Let’s try to go about this as quietly as possible, okay? We don’t want to draw any more attention to ourselves than we have to.”
“I thought maybe you needed another journal for your lab notes.” Steve explained as Tony fanned the empty pages.
Tony smirked before rising from the couch. He walked over to Steve to retrieve the charger. Steve held the charger out, continuing to smile, and Tony nearly forgot what a smartphone was.
me. Would you like to grab a drink with me?” Tony had heard Bruce finish. He had to prevent himself from turning around and shaking confidence into his friend.
Steve stared at Tony before looking back at his tablet, trying not to become more frustrated with Tony bringing up Sharon.
Steve winced. “Sorry…” He knew Tony was joking but he didn’t want him to think he wasn’t taking the situation seriously.
“Sorry it took me so long. I had to run the sequences again…” Tony continued to shout, thinking Steve and Peter could hear him from wherever they were in the penthouse. He shed his jacket before walking toward the kitchen.
The Parkers had been on their way home late after working on a project deadline before a semitruck slammed into their car on the freeway. Tony wasn’t sure if he could take care of
The three of them stared at the projection for some time before Tony walked up to the console. He swiped away the image of the core to display Thanos’s weapon and the list of sequences.
“Hey, Tony.” Buck offered quietly as he crossed his arms, leaning against the doorframe, “Steve isn’t here by the way.”
Several moments passed as the bathroom was filled with the sounds of splashing water and Steve and Tony moaning in unison. Steve smacked Tony’s ass, which stunned Tony but only for a moment. Tony grinned as he humped Steve who squeezed his body with both hands.
Tony looked at Steve. Something about his tone was super sexy, but Tony reminded himself not to get hung up on it. He desperately wanted to take a hold of Steve’s hand, but decided against it.
Tony sighed. He knew he was going to have to really work for it. He could tell that Sam had already picked up on his real question. He felt so juvenile for even asking about Steve and Bucky’s relationship, but he couldn’t ask Steve. Asking Bucky seemed more puerile than asking Steve, so that was also out of the question. Sam was the only one of Steve’s closest friends who seem to be the most neutral and Tony felt the most comfortable asking, even though he felt like he was in high school—
To anyone witnessing the exchange, it would have seemed as if being on a plane with each other for under an hour appeared to cure their dissipating camaraderie brought on from earlier in the week.
"Please don't tell me this is some homophobic bullshit or something about our age differences, which, I may emphasize, you can't really tell when you look at the two of us separately."
Peter nodded emphatically as he glanced at Steve before looking back at Tony. “If I win, could I also stay up an extra ten minutes?”
Steve scrunched up his face, trying not to look so shocked. “Uh…what do you mean?” He asked slowly, his hand now sliding away from Tony. Based on the interaction from earlier that night, Steve knew he needed to choose his words carefully, but he wasn’t sure what to say.
Natasha was standing over a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, looking through reels and reels of security footage from Stark Industries from the last few weeks. Standing behind her were Agents Hill and Coulson.
“You know what,” Steve sighed before looking away from Tony, “you got a lot of nerve giving me a hard time when you still see Pepper, Tony.”
Steve sat up straight as he looked determinedly off into the distance before squeezing the handle clutch. He told himself to go with the flow.
Steve smiled back as best as he good, laughing a bit before continuing. “Uh…no longer can we rely on traditional methods to protect and sustain ourselves and our fellow people…this calls for alternative means…” He managed to vocalize.
“Um, meet me here tomorrow at 11.” Tony began, a little caught off guard by Steve’s otherwise seemingly innocent statement.
Tony chuckled, but stopped quickly as Steve continued to glare. “It’s because you’re old-fashioned for someone your age and
Obadiah barely said goodbye to the guard before walking to the elevator bank to access the employee express elevator. He looked down at his wristwatch again, noting the time to himself.
Steve frowned at Tony, clearly concerned for his physical and mental wellbeing. “The key? Tony, why don’t you relax for a bit so I can figure out how to get you out of here…”
Tony took in a deep breath; being with Steve was definitely what he wanted, but he wanted to take things slower than he was apt to do.
Finally after Pepper made sure to remind Tony that he needed to mingle with some investors, Tony was able to free himself from his friends, making a beeline for one of the bar counters that was less frequented. He asked the bartender for a glass of water before leaning against the counter, trying not to look like he was about to have a heart attack.
Tony let out a sigh. “That and everything else bugging the shit out of me.” He glanced quickly as Steve with a feeble smile.
Sam smirked at Steve who just sighed with grief. “Most of my friends still call me ‘Cap’ even though I don’t go by captain formally.” Steve felt a little self-conscious; not only had the conversation shifted directly onto him, Tony was now aware of his friends’ nickname for him.
Tony turned around to perch himself against a counter facing the island and Steve, taking another moment; he knew he needed to stop stalling and get to the point.
A goofy smile attempted to assert itself across Tony’s face. He used walking over to a console and pretending to study some data on a tablet to steady himself before asking Steve about dinner.
Steve watched Bruce sigh heavily as he removed his glasses before leaning up against a table. Steve could tell that Bruce was uncomfortable with the conversation which made him feel exceedingly uncomfortable.
Tony let out an excruciating groan, which caused Steve to hold him close to his chest. Tony sighed again before reaching out an arm to half hug Steve.
Steve sprinted out of the room, following Loki to the middle of the main area. Loki looked around, trying to get through the crowds of people. Steve managed to catch up with him, yanking on his collar to hold him still.
Steve managed to smile back, realizing that he was probably talking himself too seriously, per usual.
Steve smiled as he handed Tony a plate. Lacking any semblance of grace, Tony ineptly took it with a fork before sitting down on the opposite side of the couch from Steve. They ate in silence before Tony finally thought of something to say.
He heard Tony sigh heavily, signally he had realized he had given Steve some incorrect sequences. Tony took a moment to review his solutions before reading the rest of the figures.
They hugged each other for a minute or so, both gasping for air, before Tony let go to sink down on the other side of the tub. Both Steve and Tony looked at each other: Tony’s hair was damp and messed up in a way that made Steve smile uncontrollably.
The ambassador was lying in a bed, hooked up to various machines. He was breathing deeply with the assistance of a mechanical ventilator. One of the nurses passed Steve and Tony with a small tub full of bloody bandages as he walked out of the room. It became terribly clear that if they didn’t do something quickly, the man would die.
Tony nodded back, trying to smile. “Why don’t you change out of your pajamas? We’re supposed to go to the park later with May, right?”
Steve flinched as Tony made a sleep noise, shaking the bed a little as he turned over some more. Steve propped himself up on his elbow to look back at Tony, but then settled back down on his side.
Steve took his time approaching Tony, glancing toward the glass façade to make sure no one was walking past. As soon as he reached Tony, Steve rubbed his arms.
Even though Steve tried his best to be as open as possible with Tony, they never really discussed the state of their evolving, intimate relationship. Tony hadn’t attempted any other additional move beyond an occasional kiss or intense cuddling. Also, Steve wasn’t sure if he should make the first move; although he ultimately discovered some newfound courage to pursue whatever was going on between himself and Tony, Steve found himself reverting to his old dating habits. As mentioned before, Steve’s sexual experiences were also lacking, to put it mildly; he had only been with two other people before meeting Tony.
“Let’s start with handling the vibranium, shall we?” Tony effortlessly shifted the tone in the conversation as he pulled up the specs of both the vibranium core and the Synergy device. Steve intently scrutinized the holographic images.
“You know, I can already tell I’m going to enjoy working with you.” Tony offered as he crossed his arms. He stared at Steve for a second longer before spinning around to face the console.
He could sense Bruce was unwilling to give up on the whole Steve thing, especially since Tony gave him such a hard time about Natasha last night.
He felt Tony hug him even tighter before sighing. “…my friends are more my family than my actual family…” Tony let out, visibly uneasy.
“Yeah, he’s great.” Steve managed to answer without sighing heavily. He held onto Sam until they finally arrived back at their apartment.
Steve laughed again as he kissed Tony back. “I don’t know why everyone thinks I’ll fall apart at any moment. I’m fine.”
As he listened, Steve figured he could call Tony later that night, that way he would have composed himself by then to calmly explain out loud what he had expressed in the letter.
Tony laughed heartily as he patted Peter on the back. “Remember when we used to make these all the time?”
Tony closed the door before slumping down to the floor. He wasn’t sure if his nightmare had been about the night his parents died or the night he had learned about Peter’s. After a while, the details of the two nights had merged together. He could only imagine how Peter felt when he had learned about his parents’ deaths.
“Shuri’s brother is shelling out a shit ton of money to finance this thing, so let’s take every advantage of this opportunity.” Tony managed to wink at Shuri and avoid Steve at the same time.
Peter nodded as Tony paused. “…Steve told me he misses you…” He shrugged, not really sure how Peter would take that bit of information.
Tony barely answered as he turned away from Steve but allowed him to hug his body against his own. He had trouble trying to formulate a sentence as the feeling in his chest started to make his eyes water unexpectedly.
of his presents.” Everyone collectively groaned at Tony’s comment, causing Tony to laugh as he held his hands up.
“Obie. How may I help you?” He motioned half-heartedly for Obadiah to take a seat in front of his desk.
“They’re in, but…” Tony looked behind himself before turning more into Steve’s embrace, “…I think you might have been right.”
Steve laughed quietly. “No, there’s going to be food…I just thought maybe we could have some alone time…”
“So, how are things going with Steve?” Pepper asked causally, obviously unaware that Tony and Steve hadn’t spoken to each other in days.
“…uh…” Tony started up again, looking away from Steve toward the bathroom, “…uh—sorry.” Tony squiggled underneath Steve who looked confused by Tony’s reaction. Tony finally feed himself before jumping off the bed and racing to the bathroom, slamming the door shut behind him.
Tony smiled back, nearly blushing from how close Steve was, as he considered the idea. “Okay, thanks, Cap. That’s really helpful.” The grateful sounding tone in Tony’s voice made Steve chuckle.
Bucky rolled his eyes as he swatted Steve’s arm away. “It’s nothing, Cap. I was just making a joke. Lighten up.”
Steve nodded. “I think we’re better at conversation than that, Tony.” Tony laughed as he let Steve walk ahead of him into the café.
Tony chuckled as he helped Steve sit up in the bed so he could mend the scratch on Steve’s face from the fall. Steve held still for Tony, watching him closely as Tony took his time cleaning the scratch before applying a liquid band-aid.
“…Hi, yep, it’s me,” Tony laughed, “…no, not today. I’m calling to add a name to Peter’s pickup list…” he waited a bit before continuing, shyly smiling back at Steve before turning around to face away from him, “…Steve Rogers…uh, yes…same one…” Tony’s voice lowered, trying not to make it obvious that he had been telling the office people at his kid’s school about the person he’s been seeing.
Steve took his time approaching the console near Tony. It perplexed him to hear Tony talk about something personal considering how he had reacted when Steve asked him about Howard Stark yesterday. But Steve figured it was more a comment reflecting Tony’s efforts in trying to ease him into their working relationship than anything else.
“This is legit! And there’s already food out!” He continued, waving an arm around at his friends before spinning around to head inside the plane.
Tony chuckled to himself. Of course, he wasn’t going to send such a direct non sequitur that basically constituted sexual harassment. Although, now he couldn’t stop thinking about how hot Steve was.
Tony sighed again before crossing his arms. “I’ve got a lot on my mind. But like I said, you did a great job. You handled yourself and everything worked out fine.”
“Obie, there’s nothing new to see yet. We’re trying to figure out the full capability of the device. Once that happens, I’m
Tony scooted up the bed, hugging Steve against his body. “Besides the fact that I couldn’t really tell, it doesn’t matter, if you think I’ll be weird about it.”
“I’m here if you want to talk about it…” Steve let out quietly, however the hesitancy in his tone was evident.
Steve believed in Tony’s capabilities and that the team should press forward with the project, but he was still struggling with keeping everyone safe. He had taken his conversation with Tony about a possible suspension of the project to heart, and now believed they needed to make the team’s safety a top priority. In addition, it was important to Steve to show that they were working as a cohesive unit, especially between himself and Tony.
weekend, Tone?” Rhodey was serving Tony the hardest grin as the latter walked into his Stark Industries office. Tony grimaced at Rhodey before sitting down at his desk.
Tony grinned as he shook Steve’s hand, aware of how flirtatious his gestures could be in front of Bucky.
Steve looked up at Tony, feeling weird that he had picked up on his anxiety. “Uh…are you sure?” He asked quietly, too shocked to mentally parse through Tony’s proposal.
Suddenly, a deafening bang coupled with shouts and screaming erupted outside the lab. Tony’s ears rang as he immediately rushed to the entrance of the lab to see people running down the hallway, shouting for help. He looked around, confused by the commotion, seeing small pieces of debris flying around.
Steve turned his back so he could focus, trying to remain calm. But as he finally settled, Tony interrupted his solitude again. He appeared next to Steve, slightly behind him.
Steve groaned to himself; there was no way he could go on keeping this away from Tony. They had promised that they would be open with each other and Steve was going back on his word. So, he then decided that he would just tell Tony the next day what he found and hoped Tony would understand why he held onto the diary.
Tony, as he turned his head at the sound of Steve’s voice, looked startled before relaxing. “Oh, Rogers…sorry. Can’t sleep…”
At that point, Steve had looked over at Tony, both looking at the other as Shuri finished. Something about the way Steve was looking at him choked Tony up, so much so that he had to physically turn in his seat to look away from Steve.
Steve sighed as he slowly looked up at his friends. “I don’t think Tony wants the same thing. We got into a huge fight this morning…I tried telling him that I wanted to be friends—”
Steve motioned for Tony to follow him to the table in the kitchen space. Tony waited for Steve to take a seat before sitting down, shaking his head at Steve's comment. Steve smiled at him as he waited and Tony felt even more horrible for what he was about to do.
Steve, unamused, expressed his dissatisfaction with the insinuation. “Why would you even think about that, Tony? Does Peter know about this?”
Steve walked up to the boys, trying to crouch down on the floor, but his face contorted, feeling every sore muscle on the way down. As soon as he made himself somewhat comfortable, half kneeling, half standing, he stuck out his hand to introduce himself to Peter’s friend.
Tony sighed; he really didn’t feel like talking about Steve, especially with Pepper. It just reminded him of his many failed past relationships.
“Vibranium? More of it? How?” Thor questioned. He was rubbing his chin as he posed in the most thoughtful looking stance.
At one point, Steve took a break to stand off to the side of the group. Tony could see him from where he was sitting on the other side of the space. Sam got the band to start playing a version of Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On”, waving for Bucky and Steve to dance. Tony watched Bucky trying to get Steve to join everyone, but Steve was shaking his head. He looked over in Tony’s direction, his expression becoming too much for Tony to handle…
Tony shook his head, too overjoyed that Steve was awake to focus. “Steve…uh…there…uh…was an accident…”
Tony squeezed himself in between Steve and Sam before wrapping an arm around Steve’s waist, pulling him tight. He led them through the foyer, through a giant kitchen until they were outside on an equally large balcony where most of the party took place. Steve glanced around: he saw Clint and Natasha talking to Thor and Fury along with some other people; Bruce speaking to Pepper and another man he didn’t recognize; and Obadiah chatting with a group of people who looked to be members of the Stark Industries board. Tony waved toward Bruce as he let go of Steve.
“It would make sense that he would take you…or Colonel Rhodes even if he were here…I have to remind myself that we haven’t known each other that long…” Steve tried to rationalize Tony’s behavior out loud, but he struggled trying to come to terms with it.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Just figure out the event shit with Pepper and only include me when needed.” He picked up his bag before brushing past Obadiah to exit the office. He opened the door before motioning for Obadiah to leave.
The rest of the ceremony proceeded naturally with the minister ending to allow Sam and Shuri to cement their union with a kiss. Sam took a hold of Shuri, dipping her as he kissed her, making her laugh while receiving joyous cheers coupled with clapping from the guests. The bridal party then filed into a line before walking out. T’Challa stayed behind to instruct everyone to gather at a nearby canopied area for the reception.
Sam sighed as he looked at Steve. “Steve, I really like Tony and I think you guys were great…and you’re entitled to do what you want to do…”
Rhodey turned to glare at Tony. “Speaking as your closest friend, you can’t keep pulling this shit, Tone.”
Steve’s eyes widened as the light from the candle flickered. He opened his mouth a few times to speak, but never really answered. Tony, still holding onto Steve’s hands, sensed that maybe he did make a mistake; he wasn’t sure how to read Steve’s expression.
Tony leaned into Steve’s embrace, but he looked away from him so he could stop himself from rolling his eyes, trying to find another excuse not to attend the event. Yet, Tony knew he couldn’t let his team down, even in the worst moments. The team had put so much work into the project that it would be more of a blow to morale if Tony opted out of the event than selling Synergy to a weapons contractor.
Tony waved his hand before crossing his arms again. “I trust Bruce, but I know you’ll know when to use the chip when the time comes.” Steve must have expressed that he was confused by the decision because Tony rolled his eyes before grinning to ease his concern.
Tony barely answered back as he flinched, becoming hyper away that he had been staring at Steve since he entered.
Steve nodded once more. “Everything’s fine, well except for Roosevelt Island. Peter’s been with May since we brought you to the hospital.”
Steve laughed to himself. “Bucky and Sam keep trying to hook me up with someone whenever we go out, but I’m so awful at dating.”
not, Obie? Steve's a military vet, a law school grad, he's tall and handsome…," Tony made a show of counting out each of Steve's character traits with his fingers, "and you seemed to be over eager with having him be the 'face' of Synergy, if memory serves me correctly."
Tony laughed back before looking at Steve again who looked amused by the back and forth, but his expression short-circuited Tony’s thought process.
Steve nodded wearingly, but he managed to smile at Bucky’s encouragement. Bucky patted him on the back once more before rising to walk back to the kitchen, now talking about their plans for that early evening with Sam.
And it was true: after the working with Tony to help save the visiting diplomat, Steve could tell that their working relationship had been more than repaired; it seemed like they could work perfectly together in the future if they just communicated openly. Also, Steve found himself enjoying spending more time with Tony which eased a good deal of the friction between the two of them.
“Uh, no,” Tony counted to ten in his head, “I don’t think you ever mentioned it.” He attempted through gritted teeth, trying to keep his expression soft, but he was sure he was grimacing instead.
“Who knew…” Tony started, “…it would only take getting you into bed to hear you swear?” He exhaled, trying to sound cool but he was too amazed with how he felt as he continued to cup Steve’s ass.
“Jesus. That was a wild night.” Tony sounded harsh and weary, but Steve could tell that he was probably also grinning. He closed his eyes to steady himself before turning around.
Steve searched around as he lifted his ass to look underneath. He sighed as he laid back down in the bed. “I’m sorry…I thought I—”
Steve kissed Tony back. “Sorry, we had meant to have dinner ready by the time you were done, but we worked on homework first so we can take the rest of the night off.” He smiled over at Peter who nodded enthusiastically.
Clint and Tony seemed to tolerate each other, but it didn’t appear as if there were any hard feelings between the two. But Steve could sense that Fury was definitely putting up with Tony and vice versa. Natasha seemed to also tolerate Tony, but at times Tony appeared to tease her just to get a rise out of her. Yet, Natasha didn’t seem to take it personally, so Steve figured that she also knew Tony well or well enough not to take him too seriously.
After settling at a table that was in the quieter part of the restaurant, Steve and Tony remained silent for some time. The atmosphere had changed, making the space between them more intimate. Tony wasn’t sure how to start the conversation back up without saying the wrong thing. He was afraid he would bring up everything that had happened after Thor’s party.
Mr. Beck lingered as he shook Tony’s hand. “Same, Mr. Stark,” he answered quietly, eying Tony before facing Peter and Ned again.
Tony laughed even louder than the last time, now doubling over from Steve’s reaction. “Of course, he does, Rogers. I didn’t get too graphic, so don’t worry. He thinks it’s a game.”
“…may I…take this off…?” Steve asked quietly, his voice hesitant yet completely caught up in the moment.
Bucky sipped from his mug again. “The resort staff forgot to change the living arrangements at the last minute and put Tony and Steve in a couple suite.”
“You manage to get hard quick again after doing it. Quicker than I’ve ever seen.” Tony ended with a grin.
“Of course. Nice chatting with you.” Steve reached out his hand toward Obadiah who shook it firmly, but before letting go, Obadiah leaned in closer toward Steve, lowering his voice to a full whisper.
Last year, Stark Industries had launched a collaborative project that stretched across disciplines. The program had been billed as the ultimate interdisciplinary venture, seeking brilliant minds from various professions to assist with the company’s newest tech. Just beginning his last year in law school, Steve had applied, even though he knew it was a long shot. The details of the full project hadn’t been made public, but during the first round of interviews it was revealed that the project would consist of helping those in need. Steve, as he progressed further through the interview stage, couldn’t miss a chance like this. He had applied to law school for this exact reason; he wanted to help people wherever and whenever he could.
Something about the way Bucky looked and his particular phrasing puzzled Steve, but he only nodded back instead of dwelling on the moment.
Tony turned to rise from the bed, but Steve managed to take a hold of his arm before he walked away.
Tony’s face immediately transformed from jovial to quite solemn, so solemn that Steve feared he might have said the wrong thing.
“Uh, yeah.” Tony finally focused his attention on Rhodey who was trying to direct him in the direction of the temporarily built stage for the presentation. Tony let Rhodey guide him toward the stage, all the while he was becoming nervous that Steve was there.
Tony then looked away from Steve, sighing loudly, before turning somewhat to look at him again. “…just because you make me come every night we’re together, Rogers, doesn’t mean I need your stamp of approval on everything I do.” He poked Steve in the chest a few times before backing away to stand in the middle of the office once again. Steve stared at him, not entirely sure how to respond.
Steve watched Tony stare at the box for a second or so before slowly opening it. He delicately moved some pieces around before handing the box back to Steve with a smile, although his expression was weary.
“Sir, Mr. Rogers is in the lobby.” J.A.R.V.I.S.’s voice suddenly appeared, causing Tony to yelp dramatically, realizing he had lost track of time.
Sam shrugged. “So? Where have you been sleeping?” The question provoked Bucky to laugh even louder than before.
The two settled, waiting through absolute, increasingly awkward silence. Steve was waiting for Tony to explain why he was there without any prior notice along with hopefully explaining why he hadn’t heard from him after all his messages and calls.
Steve rarely lost his cool, but the environment and Tony’s behavior was bugging the crap out of him.
It was finally time for the wedding ceremony and Steve and Tony had managed to avoid each other until the guests gathered at the venue. The ceremony was outside on a verdant patch close to the water. Everyone in the bridal party was wearing their whitest whites while the guests wore less formal attire to match the beachy scene.
Steve chose not to follow him; he wasn’t sure what to say. He had thought that last night had meant something more, but it appeared that Tony thought it meant something else. Also, Steve’s own intentions confused him; he wanted Tony in his life, and he cared about him so much. He wasn’t sure why he had told Tony he wanted to be friends.
Tony nodded back, crossing his arms with a sigh. “Okay, well I don’t need to remind everyone that that doesn’t give us much time before he decides to use this thing, “he turned to face Shuri, “I know you and Banner said you need a few more weeks, but is there any way we can use the device in the meantime if necessary?”
He hopped into the elevator car, pressing the button multiple times to close the door. The doors closed and he bounced around anxiously as he rode the elevator down to the lobby. As soon as the elevator arrived at the lobby, Steve stepped out into the space to find no sign of Bucky or Sam. He ran up to the desk to locate their suite floor before spinning, inputting the security code to get to his friend’s suite before jumping right back into the elevator. Steve continued to bounce around anxiously as he rode the elevator up to Sam and Bucky’s floor, running out of the elevator as soon as it opened again. He found Bucky in the foyer of the suite picking up a bag.
“What? What are you talking about, Tony?”  Of course, Steve sounded confused, but Tony could think of no better way to express his feelings.
It was a late evening at Stark Industries and two security officers were hauling a squirming Loki to escort him out of the building. Obadiah was standing in the lobby, chatting with some other officers as the two carting Loki appeared from one of the employee elevators. As soon as Loki spotted Obadiah, he winked. Obadiah scoffed, crossing his arms, glaring at Loki as he passed with the guards.
Tony’s eyes lit up. This was more than he was hoping for. “Really? I mean, uh…you mean because of Synergy, right?”
“Steve!” Peter interrupted, tugging on Steve’s pants, “we brought a salad!” Peter pointed to the dish Tony was holding.
“Ugh, I need this coffee to focus on some work I need to finish before the week starts…” Tony groaned as he settled in his seat.
Tony sighed as he hung his head. “I should have called you, Steve…I’m so sorry…” he then slowly lifted his head to look at Steve whose expression looked heartfelt.
“Mr. Stark!” One staffer greeted as soon as it was safe to approach the helicopter, “we’re so glad you could make it to our event!”
the one who installed the access codes. And you need a high-level security pass to get in here, last time I checked.”
Tony stopped Steve short before they entered. “Just follow my lead, okay?” He smiled before walking ahead of Steve who nodded timidly.
As soon as Tony entered the room, he saw Steve standing off to the side close to Thor and Shuri. Tony avoided eye contact with him as he walked to the front of the room to stand next to Fury and Pepper. Bruce was sitting at the conference table with Clint, and Natasha was standing on the other side of the room.
Tony was in the process of tucking Peter into his bed, still feeling woozy from finally having Steve over to meet his son. He couldn’t believe how well the dinner went and he even managed not to have a panic attack.
Yet, their seemingly conflicting temperaments still meshed nicely in this environment. Steve’s consistent cool headedness outweighed Tony’s dogged hotheadedness, while Tony’s affinity for thinking outside the box encouraged Steve to open up more and embrace the unknown.
Steve smiled before shaking his hand. “Nice see you too, Mr. Beck.” Steve continued to smile, unaware of the awkward situation that had occurred only seconds before his arrival.
The doctor looked at the pieces than back at Tony and Steve before looking back at the pieces again. She appeared extremely baffled. “How does this even work?”
“You know…” He started, turning back to kiss Tony, “I still need to pay you back for…the time…in the car...” he finished quietly.
Tony laughed, although he felt awkward. He turned around to face Steve. “I go to tech conferences, you’re my teammate. No harm, no foul, Rogers.” He patted Steve on the shoulder before returning to studying the information on his console.
Steve shook his head as he walked toward Tony again. “Tony, please, I don’t know why you keep saying that.”
Steve nodded back slowly as he then followed Bucky back into the elevator, riding it back up to Bucky and Sam’s suite.
Steve nodded as he walked to the fridge, he looked around inside without picking anything before slumping into a chair at the kitchen table. He could feel Sam staring at him.
Tony sensed that his lab mate wasn’t planning to let up on him, considering how terribly obvious it had been during the simulation that something was bothering him.
Also, again, was he so sure that Bruce had been serious? He wouldn’t put it past is friend to tease him insistently about Steve, given that Tony did the same with Bruce’s attraction to Natasha. No, Bruce would be more sincere about this because, well, Tony’s track record with relationships is…poor, to say the least.
Tony chuckled, but it didn’t sound as jovial as usual. He glanced quickly at Steve before returning to his work.
A rumbling cloud from the island erupted, rocking the helicopter as plumes of smoke and flames shot out from the campus.
Tony chuckled. “Uh, they were dancing to this one night…I only remember because my mother said it was one of her favorites…”
“This place is a fucking mess,” Tony began with a sigh, “it looks like the owner hasn’t been inside in a while.” He was now standing in the kitchen, searching through some boxes.
Fury glanced around the room once more before exiting swiftly. “I need to smooth this over with the board,” he concluded on his way out.
“Uh, sure…yeah. That sounds nice.” Tony smiled meekly, stumbling a little. He shuffled around himself. To Steve it appeared as if Tony had forgotten something; Tony was actually trying to hide his excitement.
“You know I’m going to need to see the full specs for the Synergy device. Sooner rather than later.” Tony watched Obadiah drum his fingers on the arm of his chair, waiting patiently for Tony to respond.
During their last day at the house in the Hamptons, Tony thought about giving the ring away; he didn’t want it. Last night, however, after Steve left, Tony convinced himself that maybe he could give it to him because ever since they left the house, all Tony could think about was asking Steve to—
Tony was standing with Rhodey, Pepper, and some board members. He could see Steve on the other side of the lounge speaking with Fury, Natasha, and some other people.
“…we should get some sleep. We have to leave early tomorrow to get back to the lab, right?” He asked softly.
” Tony reminded himself as he walked into the café, seeing Steve already seated at a table near the back.
Steve sighed heavily as Tony finally let go of him before clapping his hands together with a huge smile.
Steve’s expression hardened, instantly feeling himself losing control over his emotions. “Of course, I do, Tony.” He answered sternly.
Bruce nodded with a reserved smile as Tony perched himself against a console. “So,” Tony began, crossing his arms, “when are you taking Romanov out?”
Bucky grinned as he finally accepted Tony’s handshake. It was a bit on the too firm side, but Tony didn’t let it show.
“Does anyone else think I’m sleeping with Tony?” Steve questioned, sounding more anxious than he had intended.
Steve heard Tony coo next to him then laugh before turning toward another console. Steve smiled; it was becoming clear that whatever tension that had existed between the two of them had loosened a little.
The staffer motioned for Obadiah to follow him. “Could you follow me this way, please, Mr. Stane?" He repeated with a genuine smile.
“Hey, Pep. May I speak with you for a quick second?” Tony motioned for Pepper to join him at the front of the room as everyone else made their way out. Obadiah glanced back at them, lingering a bit before engaging in a conversation with a reluctant-looking Fury.
“I forgot; I’m having dinner with Pepper this weekend…” To Steve, Tony looked apprehensive again, “…but we can do something during the day, and I suppose I’ll see you after dinner.” He concluded with a grin.
Steve nodded, holding Tony’s arm before turning to leave the lobby. He waved at Tony as soon as he exited, watching Tony wave back.
“Oh my god! Tony!” Steve quickly turned over onto his back, nearly shoving Tony to the side of the bed.
Tony sighed as he shook his head. He accidentally glanced at Steve before addressing Bruce. “I hear you, Banner, but perhaps we can build something else from this,” he motioned toward Shuri, “we already have more talent on our team which means anything else we construct after this will only get better. Besides, I rather break the device down than let it fall into the wrong hands—”
Bruce tapped on the tracker a few times, but his facial expression hardened as he worked through the controls.
As soon as they approached the bottom of the stairs, Sam turned to face Steve. “I can’t take you guys
Steve watched Tony turned slightly to look at him out of the corner of his eye. “Uh, yeah, I think that’ll be okay…” he laughed quietly before looking back at the projection, “you don’t have weekend plans with Sharon?”
“J.A.R.V.I.S., show us the specs to the Synergy device—one of my best friends is in the military. Your mannerisms remind me of him, Rogers.” Tony explained as the specs to the device appeared above the console. To Steve it sounded as if there was a hint of tentativeness in Tony’s statement.
Steve nodded slowly, feeling a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, however he knew it was no use trying to force Tony into something he didn’t want.
Once the elevator stopped on the level where the Synergy labs were located, Tony bolted out into the corridor, jogging toward Bruce’s lab.
Steve shook his head. “No, I’ve definitely moved on.” He looked up at Tony and smiled. To Tony, something about it seized his heart.
Youthful laughter finally woke Steve up. He opened his eyes, groaning; he had just fallen asleep about an hour ago. He sat up in the bed, finding Tony and Peter no longer in it. He yawned, hearing the laughter again, before taking his time getting out of the bed.
She nodded at both Steve and Tony, “Nice to meet you, Mr. Rogers.” She then waved her hand to have them follow her inside. “This way, please.”
Tony tapped on a tablet. “Okay, I have the equations for the S.H.I.E.L.D. tracker,” he turned to face Steve, “let me figure this out and I’ll send it to you, Rogers.”
Bruce took his time removing his eyeglasses to squint at his friend before crossing his arms. It was obvious that Tony was specifically referring to his breakup with Pepper.
Tony laughed loudly. “Don’t worry about it, Rogers. It was hot.” Tony closed his eyes as he moved in closer for another kiss. Steve let him kiss his bottom lip before he kissed Tony back.
Tony slammed a pillow against his face and silently screamed. It had been a while since he had the nightmares. Maybe seeing Pepper had triggered them again.
As Bruce explained, Steve increasingly felt sick to his stomach to the point that he thought he was close to throwing up from the feeling. He thought he had made progress with Tony, especially after the argument over Bucky; they shared everything and had become more than physically close. It confused him as to why Tony wouldn’t even mention the trip.
“It’s got soul.” Tony tried to add smoothly, but it was clear that his excitement and the Jörmungandr had over ran his composure. He sunk down into the couch before stretching out his arm to point at Bruce.
“A great friend of mine owns a place not too far away from here. Let’s celebrate there!” Thor exclaimed, practically hugging Steve.
Tony swallowed, taking a chance. “If the two of you were living in the same city, would you try to make it work?” He asked, almost annoyed with himself that he had. He hoped he didn’t sound desperate.
“…we should go about our days as if we don’t know about the list of sequences or how potentially dangerous Thanos’s weapon is becoming. Thanos will no doubt get suspicious and do something drastic if he thinks we’re onto him…until the device is finish, that may be our best bet.”
Tony told himself that looking through wayward emails would probably be the best way to take his mind off the upcoming weekend. He faced his desktop as he scrolled through newly received messages before looking through messages he had flagged “important” to read later. After answering one email to a company investor, a new email popped into his inbox; it was addressed from Justin Hammer.
Steve shifted back and forth on his feet as he crossed his arms. “I can go back with you, Tony, if you want.”
Steve craned his neck to look out through the open bedroom door to ensure that Tony was out of sight. He then flung the covers off his body, taking his time turning himself so that his legs could hang off the edge of the bed. Steve glanced at the door once more before steadying himself, wincing as he anticipated the inevitable onslaught of pain.
“Okay,” Tony fished a tablet out of his work bag, tapping a few times until he found the stolen files, “there are two buyers Obie’s been in contact with that we’ll meet at the event. I sent them a message after we took off to tell them to meet us there.”
Steve couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He watched Tony stare at him, almost as if he were silently pleading with Steve to just accept everything that had happened between the last time they saw each other and now.
Steve sat up in the bed before answering. “I meant to tell you this in the car, but one of the board members at the event thought Bucky and I were dating.” He continued to laugh.
And Steve. Tony groaned; Steve was so understanding but Tony knew he was too much of a mess to handle.
“Tony, slow down. I’m still working on the second set.” He nearly raised his voice from frustration.
Tony waited for J.A.R.V.I.S. to save the sequence before exiting the lab, holding the door to the lab open for a moment, before leaving.
“Ha, it appears that the details of the project are still under wraps, yet we can tell you that it looks like we’ll be hearing more about the Synergy device in the future.”
Tony sat up in the bed, laughing loudly. He hopped off it before walking to the bathroom. “I’m going to wash off, wanna join me?” He asked, smirking at Steve.
“…I really appreciate that, Rogers…” Tony finally offered with a sincere smile, although it was a little weak.
Pepper looked at Tony, making it obvious that she could tell he wasn't okay, but Tony shook his head as he tried to focus on the meeting's agenda so he could get out of the room as quickly as possible. Obadiah ignored them as he immediately began discussing some important items.
“Oh and, if you’re interested,” Tony began, walking up to the table to join Bruce, “there’s a place here at Stark Industries for you. We could use someone like you on Project Synergy, Shuri.”
Tony nodded slowly as Steve started rubbing his back again. “We should try to get back to sleep…” Steve offered softly.
“…well…ugh…actually he could probably be better…” Tony laughed lightly as he rubbed the back of his head, “you’ll get to see him at the party…I’ll make sure before he leaves with May…he’s staying over at her place this weekend…”
Tony face Steve, taken aback by the comment. “Are you serious? I mean besides the fact that you’re extremely good looking and way too polite…well,” he paused, “I guess maybe not…I mean I don’t have the best track record, well besides maybe Pepper…”
Fury had debriefed the team at S.H.I.E.L.D.’s headquarters. He had reassured the team that their good work with the Synergy device would be highlighted against the lab explosion, and that they were required to surrender their company materials and sensitive project information.
Tony laughed. “Why would I turn down the possibility of sex from someone like you, Rogers?” The statement sounded incredibly awkward, but for some reason the entire situation felt just as, if not more painfully awkward.
Tony scooted out from underneath the robot to walk to a table to retrieve some tools. He turned slightly to leer at Steve before choosing the instrument he needed.
Tony walked up to the console projecting the information on Thanos’s weapon before turning to face the group again.
Steve shook his head. “I know I’m not an expert when it comes to dating but that’s what this sounds like.” At this point, Steve was close to the middle of the bed. Tony had scooted closer toward him, albeit cautiously.
kidding me, Steve?” Tony instantly became angry as he marched toward Steve, snatching the diary out of his hands, “I told you to get rid of this!”
Steve turned around to look at Tony who was now moving around the kitchen grabbing items without hearing what was for dinner. Steve rolled his eyes as he helplessly watched Tony whirl around the kitchen.
“Seriously? Aren’t you all supposed to be some of the best that Tony Stark could come up with??” The clearly irritated scientist then wedged himself into one of his colleague’s personal spaces.
Tony settled as soon as his body made contact with the railing. He looked out beyond the balcony, wallowing yet again in his misery.
Steve looked around, waiting for Tony to walk him further into the penthouse, but Tony just looked past him expecting to see Sharon waiting in the elevator.
“Stop stalling!” He now had his hands cupped around his mouth to project his voice, “Sam said we gotta get ready to go!”
“Steve!” Tony exclaimed in terror, “the weapon! Roosevelt Island! Thanos!” He tried to get out of bed, but he was still hooked up to the machines that were keeping him stable.
Tony looked around the room: The Synergy device was sitting on top of what was left of the conference room table. Debris flew around the space as Tony craned his neck to see the spot where Thanos’s weapon had been hidden. The briefcase had been blown away but the weapon was still intact.
Tony coughed before answering. “Yeah, it used to belong to my mother’s father…been in the family for years…”
Tony moved his head to the side as Steve continued to kiss him, now moving to Tony’s neck then the underside of his chin.
Tony coughed before looking briefly back at Fury, who remained still, but calm. Tony then turned to face the board.
Steve moved his head to the side as Tony continued to kiss him. He closed his eyes shut as he thought about asking Tony what had been on his mind the past week or so.
Steve nodded before a few minutes of awkward silence fell between them. Tony told himself to just get it over with. He reached out for Steve’s hand, holding it tightly. There was no way to ease the pain he felt and the pain he would undoubtedly inflict upon someone he truly cared for, but knew there was no future with.
Steve smiled. “I wouldn’t have let you go to this thing, or at least put up an effort, if I thought this was too dangerous. Also…I can keep track of you, Tony.”
“I was out of line. You wouldn’t have said what you said if I hadn’t spoken to you that way…” Steve looked downward at Tony, smiling, but his expression was pained.
He stared at the letter before whisking himself and his dinner plate to his home office to finish working. Later that evening, he passed one of the openings to the kitchen to get to the master bedroom. He stopped to look at the letter which was still sitting on top of the island.
Tony could see Steve smiling at him out of the corner of his eye. Although he was trying to get off the campus as quickly as possible to celebrate with Steve, Tony couldn’t pass up such a polite request.
