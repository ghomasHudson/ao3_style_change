Comfortable silence, fire and warmth made him give in to exhaustion. He did not even have the strength to take pleasure in the way Holmes touched him. The hot skin welcomed the touches of the cool material. Even when Holmes untied the first buttons on his shirt, his eyelids were already too heavy to lift them. The muscles in his body relaxed, and the breathing became shallower. After a while, he lost touch with reality.
He could not believe he was capable of such behavior. Who would have thought that an ordinary doctor could scold delegates from around the world just because he could not erase the vision of hungry Mycroft out of his head? He fell into an armchair and waited for the coming minutes. He felt Francesca's presence all this time. She was holding his hand with a small smile. It wasn't even five minutes when he heard Mycroft's voice.
He turned his head away. Arian was holding a bowl with something steaming inside. The smell was not very tempting, but John took the soup from his hand gratefully. He knew that he had to use every opportunity to eat something warm and gain strength before a journey. Sherlock probably had the same assumption, because he took the bowl from Lucy's hands. John was surprised that he did it so willingly, but he did not hide his satisfaction. The thing that caught his attention was something weird and white on Sherlock's gloves. He saw it when his friend reached for the bowl. It intrigued him so much that he put away everything he held and grabbed Sherlock's hand. He saw that Sherlock's thick glove was wiped on the inside. He saw some white material. Probably a bandage. The other glove was in the same condition. So that was his problem. Sherlock must have forgotten his protectors when he was sliding off the rope. John was angry at himself that he had not warned him about this possibility. Sherlock must have suffered if his hands were hurt at that moment. John put his foot over the bough they were sitting on. He didn't have to look for the first aid kit. Lucy left it next to the stump. He put Sherlock's hand on his thigh and began to remove bandages, hydrogen peroxide, and some ointments from a small box. He was too involved with the new task to notice Sherlock's interested stare. Fortunately, others didn't pay much attention to them. They were busy discussing something.
"Mr. Holmes shuns social life, but he knows the conventions and human weaknesses. What would it look like if a woman interfered in the marriage of her boss and spent more time with him than his partner? This is part of the game so that people could not suspect anyone for cheating, and you know how exuberant human imagination can be. They see bread in wheat grain and see a secret lover in a loyal assistant. Mr. Holmes prefers to play it safe, but that does not mean he neglects his duties. "
John frowned, not quite understanding what Mycroft wanted to say. He blinked several times before taking a glass of orange juice. An awkward silence fell between them. John tried to focus on what he heard. That was weird. This type of care did not suit to Mycroft and John had the impression that he was the object of his game. Although, on the other hand, he felt an incomprehensible warmth in his heart when he thought that maybe Mycroft's behavior was not artificial and that he was not as a thick-skinned man as he wanted to be. Sherlock and Mycroft were similar, and for a strange reason, John could get along with each of them.
"I'm terrified," he answered without hesitating. The glass in his hand became strangely warm, which did not stop him from enjoying the tart taste of wine. "But as you said, what happens in Venice stays in Venice." The smile on his face became less and less visible. All because he once again looked at his brother's best friend. For the reason that the last two weeks had been an emotional roller coaster for him. "If it was only that easy." His soft voice caught Sherlock's attention. He wasn't going to show that he was going through a mood swirl that he couldn't understand at the moment. He smiled quickly, raised his glass, and touched it against the bottom of Sherlock's glass. "To our water castles". He didn't get the answer. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the consternation on his brother's face, but he pretended that everything was all right. "It means that our plans have little chance of success."
"Why did you join the investigation? How did it happen?" he asked as he slowly passed several rows of exhibitions. He heard his own footsteps on the creaking floor.
"Silwan Shalom is a very stubborn man," Francesca said, pointing to a bald man with glasses who in silence sat next to Stoner.
Sherlock's mind was clear and fast. It was his moment. He was thinking about something very important. John was happy about it because he missed it over the past week, so he gladly joined Sherlock. They were going to the lobby.
"We agreed we will not talk about Mycroft, Sherlock," he said. He lowered his eyes and ran his fingers over the edges of the oyster shell. Sherlock fell silent and did not mention his brother again. He talked to John about the results of the last experiment and how Mrs. Hudson made his life difficult when he was alone with her. John did not even have to try to forget about recent events, because his friend helped him to relax. At first, he was afraid of his reaction and did not know if they would be able to look at each other without pointing out the events of previous days, but now everything was slowly coming back to normal. None of them complained and they behaved as they did during all the years of their friendship. The only problem for John was to avoid staring at Sherlock's lips for a long time. John supposed that Sherlock knew about his weakness, so he did not wipe his lips intentionally, but only licked them slowly. His fight with himself continued until the end of dinner because when they decided to return to the hotel, the only thing that caught their eye was the beautiful sunset. He walked slowly beside Sherlock and took advantage of the moment when there was no tension between them. For a split second, thoughts of the previous night came to his mind, but he quickly threw them out of his memory.
"Forgive me, I wasn't going to interrupt your sleep," Mycroft said, turning sideways and closing the door behind him. He had a shirt hanging on his shoulder. He folded it and put it carefully into a half-packed suitcase next to the wardrobe.
"And, you. Why do you stare at me like that, huh?" she gave Sherlock a suspicious look under her raised an eyebrow. "Have you never seen a lass before?".
"When I see that cold look of his, I even don't want to offer him my tea," Mrs Hudson bustled around the room, piling the scattered books.
The younger genius crossed his legs. "Then it's a shame you didn't make more effort and you didn't deduce where I took my friend," he leaned the back of the head against the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. "As I see, being around John makes you lazy."
Holmes nodded. "Yes, she is one of the prostitutes working in this district. What I'm asking you, is what her corpse can say about the murderer."
Mycroft finally focused his eyes on him. "There's no need, John. You have reserved this evening for my brother after all." He stared at the doctor, walking slowly toward the bedroom.
The detective looked at his pocket watch again. "Let's get to work, Watson. The lectures will be over in forty minutes."
"I give her time to forget about the potential danger. I want to surprise her and see the terror in her eyes. I'm waiting. I am slowly getting ready to attack. I look forward to the opportunity and finally my fingers tighten on her mouth and nose while my other hand rests the back of her head."
"Let's go" Sebastian's firm voice echoed quietly in the ravine, drowned out only by the whistling of the wind and the trees rustling in the distance.
"Look at these arc patterns. Now take a look at this. See these swirls? They're completely different," the detective continued.
They looked at her and then at the red cat. The cat rubbed against her leg with a happy face and tail raised high. The cat bent and flexed, and finally jumped on Molly's lap and purred, thrusting claws into her thighs.
It was the truth. John realized that he would not be able to influence many things, and what he packs into a backpack can be useful or completely unnecessary. He wanted to ask Lucy about staying at home and whether it was hard for her to leave their loved ones. However, he abandoned this idea. What she did on her last trip was her business and he wasn't going to ask her. Most importantly, she had the opportunity to talk to and spend time with her family before leaving for the mission. He and Sherlock also had the option of returning to Baker Street but decided to stay there. The sight of Mrs. Hudson and the awareness that they might see her for the last time was a reason for John to resign from returning home for several days. He preferred to save himself and his beloved hostess difficult times.
He did not understand what was happening or why there was so much resentment between her and Holmes. Why did they address each other with such hostility and prejudice? Especially Dr Hooper. What was the reason for their behaviour? Was it dictated by the nature of the detective, or maybe something more? Either way, it was clear that the reasons for their tense relationship had different causes. "The victim's face shows traces of struggle," he interjected before Lestrade could do it first. "She didn't give up easily. The murderer cut her throat," he leaned over and examined the body. "Right to left. She must have died late after midnight." Looking up, he noticed Holmes' smirk and his provocative gaze directed at Dr Hooper.
"I wouldn't mind. Maybe he would stop singing those dirty songs that sound like he composed them with his friends under a beer booth. But you're right. The more you understand and know, the better your situation is." She put down the dictionary and took a Beretta from John's palms. A heavy pistol that could barely fit into their hands. "And this? Don't you have enough of the weapons? What do you need it for?" she asked, turning the gun in each direction and aiming straight ahead.
"Stop with this show and go back to your queen, make her cup of tea or something" growled younger genius, but his words did not have any influence on his brother. Mycroft didn't even look at him.
Sherlock shook his head. He dreamed again. He thought too much about how John would react if he knew. Every time his thoughts came back to reality were absorbed by a dark wave of resignation and doubt. He was so close to achieving his goal and yet so far away. How could he be sure John would accept his feelings? What if he was wrong? What if John decided that he couldn't return his love and that being friends was the only thing he could offer him? It would break his heart. A heart he had never opened before. Maybe Mycroft was right? Maybe he shouldn't get involved? Well ... It was too late for that. A few years too late. John has ruled his feelings for a long time and Sherlock knew this would not change. The problem was that he didn't know if he should tell him or stay with him for the rest of his life as a friend. It was a good option, but if he could have John and his love ... he would take this chance without hesitation.
"John, tell me please if you heard the phone ringing, why didn't you wake me up?" he said in his normal proud tone. However, John heard reproach and irritation in his voice.
Aaron sat speechlessly and stared at John's flush. He wasn't red because of the heat, but the emotions that took control over him. John's blue eyes, his commitment in pointing out his mistakes and cowardice were too appealing. Stoner didn't wait long, still staring at the other man, raised John's hand and brought it closer to his lips. John was probably too distracted because he didn't even try to break free. Fortunately, someone interrupted them at the last moment. He was a tall black man sitting at the next table, who, seeing the whole situation, decided to act. He stood next to John and Aaron, forcing the latter to look up.
Meanwhile, Holmes stood over the dead body. "Let's look, what we have here and what that thing might tell us about the murderer."
Even that turned out to be too much for him. The news of not one, but two murdered women completely took away his appetite. Each bite carried a sense of guilt, self-loathing. He ate, breathed while innocent women died at night in the dirty streets of Whitechapel. He was so close. So close to catching the Ripper... His fingers tightened on the silver knife. The currant marmalade ran down the blade looking like blood, and the steaming tea warmed his skin like a murderer's breath. The previous night, filled with disgust, frustration and anger, had left a permanent mark on his memory. There was only one way to overcome the rage that was building within him. He should bring the murderer to justice. When Holmes informed him that they should leave, he followed him without a word, leaving his breakfast almost untouched. He barely noticed the creaking stairs, the buzzing of people, the tilting carriage and the smell of horses' hair.
Mycroft paused, gritting his teeth. "I'm trying to reason with you," he replied in a calmer but still cold voice.
"What is it ... my love? This is what I should do, right? I should behave like a loving husband, so why should I not take this opportunity?"
"I came here to assure you that I will stay away from him." These words surprised Sherlock. He saw it in his eyes. "I have allowed you to take the lead many times. I agreed to your choices, although I doubted about its rightness many times. I let you do all these things because you have always needed independence. Everything I did, I did for you. If John decides he would like to be with you, I will be happy to support you. " He paused for a moment to gather his thoughts. Suddenly, for some reason, all his thoughts vanished from his mind. He didn't plan the conversation with his brother, but since he started it, he had to finish it too. "I will not persuade him to do anything else," he added after a long silence. He looked up at his brother. "Do you understand that you can't force another person to have specific feelings? We don't have the power to force someone into the behavior and emotions we expect from them."
"That was my goal. You were supposed to live with my brother, after all." Mycroft's face was lit by the warm afternoon sun, which, combined with his calm voice, gave the impression that he was a completely different person than he had been a dozen minutes before.
Mycroft remembered about this proposal only now, but he did not show it. He looked at John and saw he showed no sign of regret what had happened several hours earlier. As if this situation did not happen. Mycroft was interested in his behavior and could not understand him at all. Staring into blue eyes, he stepped aside and let John walk toward the door.
"I know you feel hurt and I also know you won't accept any explanation at the moment ..." Mycroft tried to sound patient to calm his brother a bit. He tried to remember how to talk to him, but he knew the situation was hopeless and no argument made sense when Sherlock was so furious.
The silence in the room continued. Mycroft kept his eyes on Aaron, who was smiling. Stoner calmly sipped alcohol until he knew that further war on glances with Mycroft made no sense. He slowly got up from the chair. He put his hand in his pocket and stood silent for a moment.
The murderer's hand was moving tighter and more greedily over his body, and yet he could not even see his face. All he could see was a long wall that sank a few feet away in dense darkness. The attacker was clutching his thigh and a moment later massaging his groin. His movements were greedy but somewhat distracted. It was as if the situation had caught the attacker by surprise and his rationality overshadowed by lust.
"The cat had two owners, Sherlock" Mycroft corrected him. He didn't seem interested in a cat or anyone else. He focused on the wine he enjoyed that evening. He wasn't sure exactly why, but he didn't complain about it.
Mycroft let out an uncontrollable moan. John aggressively sucked his lips and held him in a tight embrace, crushing him with his weight. Hot breath made his face sweat. He felt that delicate scent again. He felt a hand that caressed his neck. At that moment John bit Mycroft's lip. The man jerked and made a surprised sound. John licked the blood that leaked from a small wound on the lower lip of the older man, then turned around and laid on his part of the bed and covered himself with bedding. He could hear Mycroft's loud breaths behind him.
Mycroft got up from the couch as sluggishly and slowly as John had done it a few moments earlier. He looked better. Much better than the doctor expected after such a short rest and a small amount of water. If John did not look at him so closely, he would be able to believe that he was in perfect condition. But he was betrayed by the red skin on his neck and a slightly tangled lock of hair on his forehead. A small vein pulsed at Mycroft's temple, which was destroying the perfect effect of the refined head of government. "John, your enthusiasm is contagious but unnecessary." He took a few steps toward the open window. "I have my people to do such things."
"Exactly", the detective straightened and walked around the table. "For this reason, right after breakfast, we will go to the morgue to examine the two freshest bodies and their personal belongings."
John's face became serious. He turned in his chair, put his hand on the backrest, and fixed eyes on the older man.
Holmes saw the change in his attitude, which made him smile even wider. "Our murderer is well educated and wealthy. People respect him. He is of average height, with a friendly face. Murdering is his passion, but playing games with the police is his greatest reward, so he leaves clues and false traces. The proof of this is the various ways he makes the cuts. The conclusion is we're looking for only one person, Lestrade, "he added, looking with sympathy at the inspector who continued to ignore him.
He raised an eyebrow at the sudden question. "I decided to change something. Do you think this look does not suit me?" he asked as he followed his friend.
The interior was exactly as John imagined. The elegant, old-fashioned decor gave a sense of comfort and security. If John were to imagine Mycroft's house, it would be in this style. Somehow it suited his character and manners.
"John!" Sherlock's voice spread around the area, not allowing Mycroft to answer. His voice was somewhere on the side of the crime scene. He shouted above the heads of the onlookers. He ignored Inspector Lestrade, who followed him all the time. "Hurry up, you have to see this!" he waved his hand and returned to the place where the body was found.
However it was, John did not comment on Molly's words. But he was more and more tired of the thought that both brothers always did what they wanted and treated other people as they wanted, regardless of their feelings. Both Sherlock and Mycroft used other people. They manipulated their emotions and feelings to reach their goals. Maybe it was easy with Molly. She was awkward and easy to manipulate. But John wasn't going to let them treat him that way. He was not a clumsy fool. He managed to learn how both brothers worked. He decided not to change his mind and see what effects it would bring.
He sat down as usual. Elegantly, without a rush. He involuntarily brushed a small crumb off the armrest, which should not be there. When he looked up, he saw Sherlock's intense gaze. They both knew why he came, so there was no point in prolonging this silence.
And just like that, he was here, next to Mycroft. They walked quickly along the waterfront of the city. John saw the Hotel Monaco & Grand Canal. This was the place. A place for a special meeting. Usually, Mycroft used water transport even when the road was short, but this time he didn't even look at the passing gondolas or other boats. Maybe the distance between the hotels was not very big, but John was surprised that the older man was not disturbed by the presence of so many people passing by. He concluded that his husband had used this time to think through many things and to prepare for the upcoming meeting.
"Let's go inside, John. It will be better for your health if we do not stand in this wind," he said calmly and took the doctor's hand. This gesture seemed so innocent to Mycroft now that he didn't even think what he had done. He pulled John toward a huge, decorated door. John noticed out of the corner of his eye that the mysterious figure was still standing in the window.
A strange feeling pulled him out of his thoughts. He tensed his body, ready to defend himself. He clenched his hand on the wooden handle of the umbrella, he hung on an elegant armchair. Before he realized that the burglar had the advantage of time, he managed to look around the room. He never turned on the light when he came home. A figure standing near the window caught his attention. Unfortunately, the moon glowed on the other side of the sky, so the shapes of this person were blurred. He was angry at his nonchalant behavior. He never had problems with people who could try to break into his house before, but he was always careful. Instead of thinking of John, he should focus his attention on the slightly twisted rug in the hall. He could tell someone was at home when he noticed the glasses strangely set on the table next to the fireplace. He could finally smell the strange scent that was in the air and trust his intuition when he thought of someone else's presence. But before he turned his body toward the mysterious person and before he prepared the tip of the umbrella for his defense, he heard a familiar voice.
"That's very kind. Thank you. Unfortunately, he didn't mention you even once. Perhaps, he thought it wasn't worth doing it," he murmured strongly but coldly to Aaron. The man was surprised and did not know how to react. Finally, he giggled.
John followed Stoner and focused on what surrounded them. Otherwise, he would fly into a rage in the middle of the street and embarrass himself and all the people around him.
Sherlock gently took the envelope from John's hand and looked at it closely. Where did he see a similar letter? It had to be trivial enough that he couldn't remember, and so important that he remembered a similar situation. He was sure of one thing - it had to be something important. The person who prepared the letter expected to catch their attention. He was also sure that the person wanted to impress them. This person was a professional in a high position, and as a result, the inside of the envelope had to be important for that person. The smell didn't reveal anything either. The envelope smelled ... it didn't actually smell at all. Sherlock could only smell the fresh paper. The easiest way would be to open and see what was inside, but it would be too easy. Besides, he liked it when John looked at him with admiration, so he insisted that he would find out who the recipient of this letter, and only then open the envelope. He looked at the letter for a long time. He was so absorbed in the task that he didn't care about the conversation between John and Mrs. Hudson. He could not hear what they were discussing, but he still felt the pleasure of the sound of his best friend's voice. "Who sent you?" he muttered under his breath.
"Ah ..." John's voice penetrated the body of an older man. His voice sounded like someone was torturing him, but he enjoyed it anyway. As if in the last moments of his life he was trying to find pleasure in even the smallest thing.
It was his first time when he saw Mycroft was doing something other than admonishing his brother, clicking on a laptop or driving around the city and pulling people into the car. Mycroft Holmes was working. And that meant, of course, that he completely forgot about other important things. For example, he forgot to eat. The talks continued for several hours, but Mycroft's dish lay untouched on the table. This would be a completely understandable behavior in Sherlock's case, but John realized that Mycroft was more mysterious and inaccessible.
"Well educated and wealthy? With friendly face?" he asked, having no idea where this supposition had come from.
"I'm afraid, John, that Mycroft meant a direct mission," Sherlock sighed. "He knows that you will not leave me alone and I will not agree to let you go on a dangerous mission. It seems that my brother ..." he gave Mycroft an unpleasant look, "decided to send us together to an unknown area and he hopes that we'll do the job. "
Sebastian pulled out one of the knives hidden in the shoe and without warning drove it firmly into the base of the rock. He turned it twice and lifted it, causing the whole rock with Arian to fall. Josh jumped back in time. In the cloud of dust and falling stones, they could only hear Arian's soft moaning, which Moran did not gently lift by the collar. John was relieved to see the few scratches on his face and the fact that he slightly squeezed his leg. He was afraid that the fall would affect his health more. To the extent that they would have to make an unplanned stop at the very beginning of the mission. However, the sprained ankle and superficial wounds did not cause panic. He was angry with Sebastian. Really angry.
Mycroft gave him a merciful look and smile, or rather a parody of a smile. His lips were pressed tightly, forming a straight line. "As I can see, not only Sherlock loves dramatic scenes. He also has a skilled student," he said calmly.
"If you will let me help, Holmes ... If you find me useful ...", he searched for words that would express all his determination and willingness to bring justice. "I'll do whatever I need to get the killer to stop murdering women."
John smiled at her but shook his head. "Thank you. I'm not hungry anymore. I really want it to end soon."
After a while, one of the waitresses put a bottle of wine and glasses in front of them. Mycroft poured red wine and looked at his husband without guilt. "I just wanted to apologize to you for being so rough."
Sherlock looked at him incredulously. "Are you going with us?". He didn't get an answer. He was surprised by his brother's decision, but he guessed what was the reason. He would have preferred to spend the evening alone with John, but since Molly had to join them anyway, Mycroft's forced presence did not change much in his plans. He was even a little excited about the possibility of high-level competition, which was guaranteed by his brother. He took the stairs to the porter's lodge with them.
He pressed his body to John more and more, crushing him completely against the wall. They were so close for the first time, of course, apart from the short demonstrations of their strength, when John was wrestling with a friend or spontaneous and quick embrace. They stood face to face. Sherlock's eyes flickered slightly in the rising sun. His lips seemed so tempting now. They were as rosy as his cheeks. Sherlock leaned closer and closer. His full lips looked different from his brother's narrow lips. The way Mycroft touched him and his kisses were ...
He shook his head. He pulled out a few more shillings and handed them over to the pleased boy. "Speak."
John stopped. He looked at Mycroft. He stood, as usual, in elegant pants, a shirt, and a vest. A white towel was hung around his neck and he was holding an electric razor on his face. He learned, he should only use this kind of shaver when he was near John. Using an ordinary hand razor ended up cutting his skin too often.
He took the item from Holmes's hand and leaned over the body. He understood his mistake immediately because it was Holmes who was kneeling closer to the victim's head, which made the distance between their faces uncomfortably small at the moment. Nevertheless, he chose to keep a straight face. "I can see her swollen tongue, bruises on her cheeks, and two cuts made with a long, sharp knife. A cut from left to right," he announced, slowly returning to his position. He couldn't help but glance at the detective whose face was inches from him.
He left the bedroom quietly and saw Mycroft - his terrible husband, who was soon to be a divorcee. He was sitting in his chair by the open laptop and talking to someone on the phone. He was busy, so John had no idea if his presence was noticed at all. He stood for a moment by the open door, but there was no reaction from the older man.
He was leaning over the mirror on the wall and checking his tie when the apartment door opened and he saw Mycroft. John looked at him in the mirror reflection. Mycroft walked inside hesitantly, closed the door behind him and stood still, not looking at John. He dared to look at him after a few long seconds, only when he noted John was wearing an elegant vest and black trousers. He blinked several times and cleared his throat.
He straightened up in his chair, sighed quietly, but took the plate from John's hand. "Thank you". The plate was cold, as was the slice of pizza, but the place John was holding between his fingers burned with fire. Of course, in Mycroft's opinion. He told himself that these were hallucinations caused by alcohol. He avoided the doctor's eyes. The pizza was cold on the sides, yet crispy. He didn't mind that he had filled his stomach with something other than alcohol. All this time he was not aware of Sherlock's eyesight, who stopped paying attention to Molly and focused completely on him.
Something he had been waiting for had happened. Finally, the man moved. He watched the stranger shift his position. The man took his leg off his knee and reached for something in the bag lying on the seat. All this was happening in the dark part of the carriage, but he could hear the soft click and then the noise of glass objects.
"Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute, John. This building, which can be seen from the hotel windows," she said, pointing a finger straight ahead at the open windows. John followed her gesture, but Sherlock caught his eye. He sat opposite Molly and read the menu card. The sight of his indifferent face or even ignorance made John feel the unpleasant feeling of stinging in his stomach he felt earlier this morning.
"I will do that," Mrs. Hudson said smiling, ignoring malicious comments. "I also need some rest. You two always come back so happy with the trips."
"Everything is going well for now. But... why is it so stiff here? Why is nobody dancing?" John asked. Mycroft came over to him and put his hand on the table behind John's back. He leaned over to whisper something in his ear.
"The main cause of death is a neck wound," she continued. "Cut left to right. Poor Catherine has been gutted," she tossed the bloody cloth away, revealing the victim's mutilated torso. "The murderer threw the intestines over her shoulder and cut out the left kidney. He cut off the tip of her nose, he did almost the same to the ears. He cut her face and eyelids. And in this case, he had time to leave his signature." She tossed the cut skirt aside in one move. On the groin next to the pubic mound was a long mark carved with a sharp knife. It was deceptively similar to the letter 'J'. "And he did it all in complete darkness."
"You can be sure that I will not mention this conversation to anyone. Think about what I said and let John make his own decision," he said, grasping the door handle in his stress-glacial hand. "Please remember that I care about you. Just like your friend does."
Mycroft looked like he didn't quite understand John's words. "I didn't forget, John ..." he said slowly.
Everything seemed to indicate that Mycroft was getting ready to sleep, but work still occupied a more important place in his life. John tilted his head and looked at the older man. Mycroft leaned back in the chair and rubbed his tired eyes. He must have known he was being watched because he finally turned his head and looked at John.
Sherlock's face relaxed. The uncertainty that appeared for the moment in his eyes vanished. Negative emotions were replaced by a mixture of shame and something John couldn't name at the moment. He was silent, giving John meaningful looks.
The inspector frowned. He didn't understand what that answer meant, although lately, he hadn't been keeping up with what was happening on Baker Street anyway. "You know, Molly came back completely different from that trip," he changed the subject, "She's so much happier as if she found a new part of herself there. She surprised me when she called and said she wanted to meet."
His first problems started during the conventions, where he was sent as a delegate. He had the opportunity to meet people who worked for their country. These people changed their positions every year. Some left or were replaced by others, but the most important of them still held their positions. Nothing has changed for years. He met people who were intelligent, naive, fighting for good, ambitious and lazy people, good-natured, and sometimes those who did not even know how they got there. The most pleasant experience for him were acquaintances that matched his intelligence. Some people did get on his nerves, but he had at least some entertainment and pleasure in showing them their place in long and demanding discussions. Of course, almost every time he had to explain the absence of his partner at the congress. It was tiring, but he could always find a fine excuse to satisfy their curiosity. But that was about to change. He met Aaron Stoner at one of the conventions. He immediately seemed extremely intelligent, somewhat crazy, spontaneous and ... irritating to him. There were only two things they shared. An open mind and sexual preferences. Mycroft did not hide his orientation, and Stoner didn't care what sex his lover was. Holmes shook his head every time he heard about his partners. But he had no choice. He considered acquaintance with him as a necessity rather than pleasure, but he had to admit that discussions, banter, and competition tightly filled his time on prolonged trips. He also had to admit that competing with him gave him a lot of satisfaction because he loved to show his superiority especially over people who got on his nerves. The only time he felt defeated and sick to his stomach was when they started talking about his wedding ring and another absence of his spouse's at the congress. Usually, simple explanations like he is sick, he visits his family, he didn't feel like joining, was enough, but not for Stoner. Each time he gave him strange looks and smiles. He was so annoying that Mycroft felt sick at the thought of the next congress. This situation lasted for several years, during which he began to sincerely regret his lie and naivety when he thought that his lie would never be exposed.
"I see the sun was warming you up. You are tanned," Greg said cheerfully with a white smile and glistening eyes. With his right hand, he slowly reached into his jacket pocket. "How was Venice?" he asked and pulled out a small notebook.
"Relax, Watson. The police know about this. I got a telegram from Lestrade," he said, picking up and waving a small piece of paper.
"What places?" John tried to occupy his mind with something different than deduction. He stepped away from Mycroft and invisibly straightened his shirt, which tilted him during the kiss.
"Oh mio Dio! Where is my manners! I am Francesca Coletti. My husband is a friend of your husband! We are family!" she said almost laughing. John immediately loved her joyful nature and was not disturbed by her accent or misleading words. He went by her side down the stairs and listened to the passionate stories.
"So I'm just a thing for you?" he asked without taking his eyes off the mask. He didn't see the consternation on his friend's face when he asked the question, yet he felt Sherlock tense and froze without a word. "I mean ... one of the things Mycroft can take away from you. You said so yourself this morning." John looked at his friend only now. His eyes must have been filled with sadness or pain because Sherlock blinked quickly and immediately looked away. He wondered how he should answer, but John spoke first.
Mycroft did not even try to hide his amusement. John was sure he had to be pretty good entertainment for him. Because he, John Watson, an ordinary man accustomed to normal and not very elegant food, was now revealing a total lack of familiarity and habits in the high class. He felt like a small child who got an expensive toy for the first time and did not know what to do with it.
"Go and return Mycroft a wedding ring," Sherlock interrupted him, nodding at the gold object at his friend's finger.
"Trust, John. Trust is the keyword in this situation. You are a friend of Sherlock, there is no better candidate" Mycroft said with a quiet tone. It was obvious that he was already tired of the whole situation.
"Sherlock," Mycroft muttered warningly, looking back, "John and I need to talk ..." he said quietly "... alone".
"What would you say, John?" she asked, turning around in the chair with a smile. She was looking at John, who turned his head toward her. He saw sparkles of happiness in her eyes and blushes on her cheeks. In the end, she could go for a walk with her unrequited love and it was obvious that she wasn't going to hide her happiness.
Holmes did not even flinch. He was standing on the sidewalk, pulling gloves over his hands. He was smiling broadly with undisguised enjoyment.
"I didn't do it for you, Mycroft," said John. He put his hand on the table and pressed fingers to his eyes. He didn't know that Sherlock could react that way. However, he did not want to back down. He was convinced that his friend would calm down, and in addition, he would have the opportunity to have some fun. John felt movement beside him. When he looked at Mycroft, he was standing right next to his chair with something on his face that looked like a smile.
Two marriages sat at a small table, with a lovely view of the main canal. The sun was slowly hiding behind horizon, and warm air mixed with a light breeze. Delicious food and a large number of lamps created a very charming atmosphere.
Sherlock moaned behind him and pressed his whole palms against John’s stomach. There already wasn’t very much give, and John shivered. Sherlock cupped John’s new belly in his hands. “You’re already so big today,” he whispered.
Sherlock cried out as his orgasm suddenly exploded from his body, coating his stomach and hand with his semen. He lost all control, mind racing and pulsing at the thought of coming with his erection pressed to the man’s belly, with the huge, heaving weight of it between his hands as he grabbed it to rub, as he sucked at the bursting navel and felt the taut, full skin struggling to breathe beneath his lips.
"He has proof, we pretend this marriage from the very beginning. I saw his smirk and I'm sure he is up to something. He didn't tell me anything specific, but he made it clear, he has a plan. But what bothers me the most is your attitude. You pretend there is no problem, although you know very well if something will happen... "
More bullets hit the target. They were more accurate, but John knew that he could have done it better. He could aim better, but he needed something to get him to the edge. He needed stress to keep his hand stiff and his eye perfectly focused on the target. And the coming weeks were to give him these feelings because the mission he was preparing for seemed to him more and more dangerous and extreme every day. At first, he was not convinced that his body was still suitable for this type of task. He was not young anymore, and his muscles had long forgotten about the training he had undergone in the army. So he was surprised when it turned out that he not only did quite well but also eagerly forced his body to effort. After a few days, he realized that he was in better form than he thought. He realized that running with Sherlock on the streets of London proved to be useful. His muscles and joints were proof of intense training. He felt pain and exhaustion but he could count on specialists. Their task was to make him usable. He trained and attended meetings every day so as not to think about some people. For example, about Sebastian.
"Just plain misinformation to mislead potential terrorists. This congress doesn't happen often, John. Many important people will take part in it, and this is the perfect opportunity to attack. We've given the media the wrong information to be able to talk quietly elsewhere."
Practice makes perfect. He knew it all too well. The slight mockery in Holmes's voice puzzled him when he mentioned the police's attention. Did he condemn or admire the murderer's actions? Or maybe both? He immediately rejected this possibility. He had known the detective too briefly to draw any conclusions. He let himself be carried away by the flow of events but had to keep a clear mind. This sudden whirlwind of unexpected coincidences and the feeling of danger were dangerous but very, very attractive.
"Mycroft, it's time," the older man interrupted him. He appeared in the doorway. He was waiting for Holmes and hurried him with a wave of his hand. Mycroft bowed slightly and returned to the meeting.
"I did not comes because of Mycroft, my dear. I have an offer for you and your husband," she said cheerfully. Her friendly attitude greatly affected John. Despite her older age, she was a very beautiful woman and she treated him as a friend.
He looked up. The place where the detective's voice was coming from was empty. It took a few seconds for him to notice his shadow sliding along one of the walls, but oddly enough he heard no footsteps. "What are you saying? That Jack the Ripper killed women for six months, but only now did the police become interested in him?"
"Mr. Stoner" Mycroft's voice was steady and cold as always. "I guess you are not as big ignorant as you claim to be and you realize how difficult this problem is. Could you focus on the current situation for a moment instead of acting like a fool in front of all these people? If you have at least a bit of decency then you will leave this irresponsible behavior of yours for a moment and focus on the reason why you are here. Otherwise, I will personally make sure that your ministry is bypassed at the next congress and vote. Your superiors will not be satisfied with this fact, right? "
John almost jumped when he heard a cheerful female voice behind him. He saw a tiny woman. She smiled at him and raised her hands in welcome. Her red and close-fitting dress emphasized feminine charms, and despite her older age, John had to admit that she was a very attractive woman. A smile appeared involuntarily on his face. He approached and kissed the top of her hand that she offered to him.
They were both silents until they finally stood at the door of the great WildnerHotel. John was a little surprised. It was an ordinary and unremarkable building with a small cafe in front of the entrance. How did it deserve to gather so many important people? John had no idea ... Until he came in.
It was one of the few warm days in London that surprised even the fussiest citizens of the capital. The air was really warm, the blue sky contrasted with the intense green of the trees, and the wind was pleasantly blowing in the hair instead of freezing faces. John wandered around the city for a long time, wondering how to talk to Mycroft. Where should he start and how to behave. He did not feel comfortable in such situations, but he had no choice. He had to meet him and discuss a few things with him. He gathered enough courage after two hours of aimless wandering around the streets. He got into the taxi and a dozen or so minutes later he was standing under a tall, white building elegantly decorated with columns. He expected that it would be difficult for him to communicate in sign language with the man sitting in the corridor, but the elderly gentleman unexpectedly got up from behind the counter and showed him the stairs down the corridor. John nodded and obediently headed for the room he had visited several times before. He tried to move quietly, though he didn't care much about the other people sitting in the hall he passed. They didn't even react to his presence. They were completely wasting their time in complete silence. They read, wrote, and some even slept in comfortable armchairs.
Holmes sat motionless with the same cryptic expression on his slightly tilted face. "Even if it's risky?" he muttered, not hiding his surprise. "What are you willing to sacrifice to catch the murderer?" he asked with curiosity in his voice.
He noticed that Lestrade turned pale, but before he could speak, another unfamiliar man in an elegant coat and a with a top hat on his head appeared on the stairs. Several policemen made a sound of dissatisfaction and left the yard. Something in the man's face caught his attention. He couldn't pinpoint what, but there was something attractive, menacing, and strangely exciting about him. His bright eyes scanned every inch of his surroundings, from the wet tuft of grass in the corner of the yard to the walls of surrounded buildings. With slow movements, he was pulling his black gloves. He stood without a word, watching his surroundings.
Mycroft stood beside the armchair. His chest rose quickly and irregularly. His cheeks were red and his clothes were completely disheveled. The jacket was in place, but the two buttons on the vest were already open. The hem of his shirt was sticking out of his elegant trousers. And his penis was trying to break through the material between his legs.
"... I give her a few more minutes," Sherlock said, but before he could add anything else, he heard a loud smack. He turned his head and looked at the couple. The girl stood furious, and the man sat huddled in a chair. She screamed something in Italian and struck him with an open hand on his back and head. People looked at them with the same surprise as John and Sherlock. But genius knew that sooner or later the girl's patience would end. They watched how enraged woman snatched the phone from the man's hand and throw on at the ground, then left and yelled some curses.
"You are so cute, my love, leaving me alone with this gross stalker. But don't worry. I somehow managed to get away from him... Thank you, Mycroft." John walked around the living room and clenched his hands nervously.
His phone vibrated. Aaron picked it up and read the message. He chuckled and shook his head slightly. "She wrote 'I understand'. If I knew your name was affecting her that way, I'd have changed my strategy long ago." He straightened up and put the phone back in place. "See, that's one problem less."
At one point, one of the band members played a melody that revived Molly. "I know this song," she said, straightening up in a chair. "This was my dad's favorite" her words were not heard or ignored by the Holmes brothers because none responded. They had a discussion with John on a topic related to Scotland Yard.
itself. However, newspapers, in their habit, had to give a catchy title to attract sensation-hungry people and make money. The word
Sherlock has heard that already. He would have liked to have turned to his brother who was standing quietly behind the sofa. He wanted to ask if everyone involved in the case had learned this type of answer by heart. Instead, he focused on analyzing the next participant. He looked the least matching their company. He had a young boy's face and shiny eyes. Hands of music and philanthropist. He was a ladies' man. Women were his sense of life. His behavior, perfumes, impeccable hairstyle, and glances he gave the archer testified to the fact that he considered every woman on her way a goddess and treated her as well. His ability was his fluent knowledge of languages. He also owned an excellent memory. He left the mysterious man at the end. He wanted to know everything about him. He was the only one who has not spoken a word yet. While others asked questions and took part in the discussion, the mysterious man was silent. The only thing he did was watch John. He was not disturbed by the significant grunts of the leader or the quiet admonitions of the other men who gave up after a few minutes at the beginning of the meeting. Sherlock was so absorbed in the deduction that he didn't notice the silence in the room. He looked around. Everyone sat in silence and the meeting leader waited for some reaction. He realized that the time had now come to declare their participation in the mission.
He looked down between swallows at Sherlock’s hands cupping his belly. They rubbed the sides of his stretching skin, and disappeared underneath John’s gut to hold the heavy weight of it, and dipped into his sensitive navel before tracing up towards the top of his growing bulge. Sherlock’s hands seemed like they were everywhere at once, rubbing and caressing this solid growing mass that felt like it wasn’t even a part of John’s body anymore.
He stayed there for a moment with his head tipped back, still hidden by the pulled-down hat, and then he slowly, for the first time, rubbed his hand over the whole swell of his growing stomach through his shirt.
John was restless. He paced from the living room into the kitchen, then back towards the sofa, then back into the kitchen. His body felt off, and his gut felt tired from holding in his stomach all day. He stopped in front of the kitchen sink and filled up a glass of water, then stood there holding it in his hand.
Sherlock ran his fingers over the tightly held-in skin around John’s middle, feeling the places where it wanted to bulge outward. “Is it one of those nights?” he asked.
John’s belly started to ache as he drank the water slowly, letting each swallow settle before tipping his head back for more. He let himself completely relax against Sherlock, curving his back and pushing his belly forward in front of him into the room as it swelled. Completely exposed and cresting away from his body in a round, growing curve.
The air in the room was changing into something enticing and warm. John thought one last time about how insane this was – how weird or inappropriate or sick. Then he shook his head against his thoughts as Sherlock pinched the soft skin of his tummy, and with a sigh he let the tight muscles in his stomach go lax. His stomach surged out ahead of him, bulging into Sherlock’s hands and rounding out full.
And John knew, as he held himself, and felt the full curve of his body covered in his own release, that he would be doing the exact same thing three months from now.
It ached. He paused after around a third of the bottle and clapped a hand to the hot skin of his belly, groaning loudly. His belly creaked under the weight of the food and liquid he’d packed into it, and he felt lightheaded as he tried to breathe against the heavy strain of the alien belly hanging off his front.
Now Sherlock reached out and drew John towards him by the hips. John let himself be led as he brought the glass to his lips and started to take long, slow gulps. He felt Sherlock push up the fabric of his jumper again to rest on the top of his stomach, and then Sherlock pulled him close enough that his bare stomach touched the front of Sherlock’s white button up shirt. He could feel the cold buttons on his exposed skin, slowly pushing harder against him as he drank.
John kept his eyes averted from the mirror, without knowing why, as he set the cola and mentos on the bed. Then, with shaky hands, he reached down to push his jeans and pants off his hips. He moaned once as he reached around the fullness of his belly, pulling down heavily on his spine as he bent forward to pull off the jeans. He clapped a hand to his belly to hold it still as he finally he stepped out of the clothes pooled around his ankles. He could feel his half-erect cock jutting out a bit from his body, but when he looked down to see it, it was hidden from view, covered by the swell of his belly.
Finally, after another third of the bottle went down, John stopped and gasped for breath, setting it down on the bedside table.
He cut off his last words with a cry as he suddenly came in Sherlock’s hand, pleasure and aching pain rolling through his body as his orgasm pulled on his cramping stomach. The dual sensations drew his orgasm out so long John thought he might not be able to breathe. When it finally started to fade from his body he grabbed his belly weakly with both hands and sighed, rubbing thickly at his aching weight.
He turned up the volume, one click at a time, and then let his palm cup the length of his hardening erection.
He normally got a bit of a dark thrill at the knowledge people had watched him – more at the mere existence of the comments themselves than what they really said. These ones, though, made him suddenly look over his shoulder. He felt like he’d given a piece of himself away. Like that perfect, full moment looking down at his body while he warmly ached in his groin had now been taken from him, and changed into something that belonged to everyone else. As if the comments saying they wanted to fuck his belly, or stuff him until he burst, or rub his skin, were suddenly about
But it wasn’t really gone, though, was it? He did still have it – that perfect moment. He still had the video . . .
Suddenly the only sound in Sherlock’s ears was the steady gulp of the man’s swallows. Sherlock held his breath as the man placed his hand which was closer to the camera on the bottom of his stomach, which was slowly, ever so slowly, starting to round out beneath his shirt. The fabric started to cling to the curve of his skin, pushing outward against the cloth and slightly straining at the sides. He paused every few swallows to take a deep, slow breath in through his nose, letting his stomach loosen every time he breathed out, and then simply continued, gulping down more in steady swallows, punctuated every few seconds by a soft sigh in the back of his throat.
He didn’t really have any need for it, not really. There was absolutely no reason why he would need to watch another similar video by a completely different user. He’d already watched the few seconds of the main video he needed – confirming that the flat he’d been in earlier that day did, indeed, belong to his suspect for his case.
Sherlock scanned through the twelve videos the man had posted, all of them with a similar thumbnail – the white wall, the jeans, the camouflage cap, the white shirt.
Sherlock’s lips were on his in an instant, kissing him deeply as his hands joined John’s. Sherlock groaned into his mouth as he suddenly dipped his finger deep into John’s navel, making John flinch with the ache. His belly was stretched too taut to suck it in, and he surrendered hopelessly as Sherlock poked and rubbed into his aching navel while attacking his mouth with his lips and tongue.
He fed him the warm pasta bite by bite, and John left his hands to gently rub down around the lowest curve of his belly as he chewed and swallowed. He could feel the curve of his stomach against his forearms, and when he looked down his packed upper stomach came to a point below his chest. The food joined the water already swelling his stomach and started to gradually settle lower in his gut, pushing out the bottom of his belly further and further into his waiting hands. The only sounds in the room were the quiet noises of his chewing, and the slight moans and gasps for breath John made as each bite of food forced itself into his already packed stomach.
“Fuck,” the man moaned under his breath. He finished the last swallow, wincing and gasping for breath, then dropped the empty carton to the floor and clutched his belly with both hands. He arched his back as far as it could go, looking down at his huge stomach held between his palms. “Fuck, fuck,” he whispered again while he rubbed his round sides.
Sherlock’s eyes quickly traced the hard line of the man’s jaw – took in grainy hints of stubble through the poor video quality, and the strong line of a sturdy neck attached to broad shoulders. The back of his hair, the part that peaked out below the cap, was cropped military short, and his top vertebra created a small knob beneath his shirt, connecting to the rest of the compact curve of his spine.
He refused to stop and think of how ludicrous this all was as he closed his laptop and walked into the kitchen. He was waddling, he knew. He could feel the way his belly was hanging heavily off his front, making him have to lean back just to stay standing, and his hand rubbed the bottom of his stomach to try and fend off the cramping as he opened random cupboards, looking for something, anything.
John reached down over his rounding stomach and pulled up his jumper from the bottom, slowly dragging the fabric up over his stretching skin until it rested on the crest of his belly, leaving his skin bare. The hairs on his stomach stood on end and shivered underneath Sherlock’s hands. He wanted to watch himself grow huge and tight, bursting and full until his body couldn’t swell anymore. Until Sherlock couldn’t reach the tip of his belly from behind.
Sherlock realized, all at once, that his own hand was down inside his trousers. That he had somehow unzipped himself and was now stroking his bare cock with his palm. His heart was racing, blood rushing through his ears. He held his cock in his fingers, rock hard and hot, and he wondered if the man’s bloated belly felt just as hard. If it would be stretched taut under his fingers, and warm as it stretched and swelled.
He tried not to burp, desperate to hold in the tight ball of pressure high in his chest. When he was halfway through the cola, he nearly dropped it to the floor. He couldn’t bend over. Could barely even move. He bent his knees, moaning out in pain, until the cola hit the ground, before he clutched his belly with both hands and straightened back up. He hadn’t turned towards the mirror. Not yet.
John watched himself reach down beneath his belly to grab his cock. It was rock hard in his palm, and he gasped at the sudden pressure on his sensitive erection. He was dripping clear liquid from the tip. He watched it fall to the ground in the mirror.
“You can barely stand, can’t you?” Sherlock moaned. “Can’t even leave the flat. You’re too full. People would think you’re pregnant. Your belly will bump into things as you try to walk, won’t it? Hang low over your pants, press against the counter when you cook. You won’t even be able to see over it, will you? Just see how huge you are.”
John sighed and leaned back against the headboard after Sherlock came. The feeling he hated was starting to creep in – where after his orgasm was over, and the pleasurable endorphins were starting to fade, and all he felt was fat and slow and dirty.
In the video, John watched himself stroke his arm and take deep breaths, his chest expanding beneath his t-shirt. His stomach flat.
Sherlock’s hand flew over his cock. The clock of the video was like a countdown to his orgasm – to the moment that he himself would finally burst.
He looked back up in the mirror, at his swollen, bloated form, stretched to his limit, and he took his hand covered in his semen and placed it in the center of his stomach. He sighed as he rubbed his semen over the tight skin of his belly, covering himself with his own release, until the stretched skin started to shine. He rubbed himself, the sensation covering him in pleasure, curling his toes, and let his tight stomach gradually relax into his palm, starting to loosen as he let his muscles ease and relax.
Sherlock held John’s hips and started to turn him gently from side to side, so that John’s hanging belly brushed back and forth across Sherlock’s shirt. The fabric and buttons tingled against his sensitive skin, and John could feel the water sloshing through him as he moved, pushing his skin out tighter as it settled. He looked down at his stomach cresting away from him into a point and groaned at the sight of himself, bare and exposed against Sherlock’s flat, clothed stomach. It sent a strange heat up his spine – one he still wasn’t used to, even after all this time.
“Look at what you did to yourself,” Sherlock said. “Made yourself stretched full. So round.” Sherlock reached around until his fingertips barely met at the farthest crest of John’s belly. “Christ, John. Look at you.”
John cupped his belly in both hands, looking down at it helplessly as it stretched and heaved with his breathing. He held it like he would burst, shivering at the slow heat of Sherlock’s hand on his cock.
John drained the last swallow of the second mug and grimaced as the milk slowly forced its way into his aching belly. Suddenly he remembered the mirror, and he looked up, desperate to see himself. His belly was stretched tightly forward, pushing underneath his skin and more round along the bottom than John had ever seen it before. He felt swollen and ripe, and Sherlock’s hands continued to rub over his pale, exposed skin.
His stomach looked beautiful, stretched and full, round and shining. It was him, his body, making himself feel perfect and filled and good.
Sherlock’s face was pressed into John’s hair, and neither of them touched anywhere near John’s still full to bursting belly. “I love you,” Sherlock whispered, and John bit his lip with emotion. “Love you too.”
He scrolled idly through the incoming YouTube comments while he sat back and lightly scratched the skin of his belly. He’d long since taken off the pulled-down baseball cap and run his fingers through his hair. His tan fingers roamed idly over the curved pale skin of his stomach, lazily circling his navel, which was slowly sinking back in after he’d popped it out while stuffing. It was the first time that that had ever happened to him during a session, and the sensation of it, the thrumming, pulsing bursts that had shot out from his stomach as his finger flicked at the nub, had almost made him come right then in his pants.
With a cry, John suddenly came into his hand, longer and harder than any stuffing orgasm he’d ever had before. He watched himself come over his fingers, spewing down onto the floor. He clutched his belly with his other hand as it clenched and ached, painfully stretched with cramps as his orgasm shot up his spine.
Sherlock rubbed over the small curve with his thumbs. “It’s not good to hold it in,” he said gently. “Let it out for me.” The air in the room was changing. “Please,” he added.
he uploaded them hundreds of times, and the only answer he could ever come up with had been that other people did it, so why not him? After all, it was only due to stumbling across another person’s similar video that John realized this was even a thing, and then went out that same evening to guilty buy his first liter of soda from the corner store. Something about the risk of it, the shameful thrill . . . Something to make him feel physically alive after months staring blankly at his own white walls.
Sherlock was at the kitchen table with two steaming mugs of tea, pouring over case notes from the day before. He smiled, and John tried to do the same as he took his mug and went to stand by the windows. John stood there drinking, trying to find the best way to move his muscles so that his stomach was sucked in close to flat, when Sherlock came up suddenly behind him, wrapping his arms around John’s chest and taking the mug of tea from his hands.
He paused and looked to the side. He was perfectly round. Sherlock’s hands dipped below the lowest curve of his belly and held some of his weight. John looked down and only saw a vast expanse of white skin. He touched his stretched side with trembling fingers and groaned at the feeling of himself, taut and hot and aching. He kept his hand there and continued to drink, feeling his belly stretch beneath his hand with every swallow.
He’d never walked around his small flat before after a stuffing, and certainly not with his shirt still off. He felt dangerous and obscene. He knew, obviously, that no one could actually see what he was doing. He was completely alone in his set of rooms, with all the blinds shut, and yet the thought still remained - that he was waddling around, stuffed, looking pregnant with a rounded belly, walking around his flat in the light of day, away from the safety of the one white bathroom wall where he’d always restricted his stuffing sessions to before.
Focusing hard, Sherlock could see the tiniest nub in the center of the man’s belly from his navel, pushing out against the thin fabric. The man brushed his thumb over it once, twice, then paused from his swallowing to gasp out loud, letting out a little moan as his thumb rubbed over the sensitive bump. He looked down again at his belly, his back now curved to press his stomach forward to try and get more room. His legs were spread where they stood planted on the floor, and his belly started to hang heavily in the space between his hips. Again, he watched his own hand stroke over the curve, rubbing the heavy underside of his belly before holding the side and breathing so that his belly stretched into his palm. His arm was starting to have to reach forward to touch the farthest tip of his growing stomach, and Sherlock suddenly desperately wanted to know what that stomach looked like from above – what the man himself saw when he looked down at his huge, ballooning body.
John was stroking his thickening cock again with his hand through his pants. The tip of it pressed up against the underside of his belly, trapped beneath the weight. The video was going to end soon, he knew.
The man nodded and disappeared somewhere in the back room, so John rubbed his face. It was midday and he felt as exhausted as if he had spent one of those tiring days in Afghanistan. He met the so-called 'energy vampires' several times in his life, but he had to admit that no one could match Stoner. It was literally a few moments in his company, and John felt depressed, tired and gloomy. He felt that Aaron took all his strength, and he couldn't help it. It didn't help that Stoner strove for his attention and company.
He slowed down only to pick up Mrs. Hudson's phone, lying on the ground, and almost pressed into a crack under the closed door of the living room. He entered the room, flushed and sweaty and gasping for breath. His sudden entrance focused the eyes of the Holmes brothers. They looked surprised until they noticed the condition he was in and the two phones in his hands. Mycroft understood right away. Sherlock needed two seconds more. They fell silent, waiting for what he would say and how he would react.
"Who will hesitate" Moran straightened up and turned to the others, "can already look for a way back. If you can't keep up and you lag, that's your problem. We won't wait," he announced in a calm but imperious tone. He passed the silent Lucy and stepped forward. "And if you try to undermine my decisions," he added without turning back, "it's better if you have a good reason to do so. Let's go."
"All right, Mycroft. Now, tell me what this is all about," he asked calmly. He hoped it would help relieve the tension. He came closer to Mycroft.
After a few minutes, Mr. and Mrs. Coletti left after a small nod. Passing through the room, John met more new people. He knew some of them from television and newspapers and he still couldn't get over Mycroft. Holmes knew them by name, but it looked as if they felt honor looking at Mycroft. John felt he was the object of their interest too. They finally got the opportunity to meet Mycroft's husband. The mysterious husband Mycroft tried to hide for so many years. Some people approached them with smiles, others watched them from distant.
"I take your word for it," he said seriously as if the little flower he had forgotten had the highest value for him. Maybe it really was. "Then, show me what you learned from these videos," he said seductively, among the sounds of an approaching storm.
They looked at each other for a long time. None of them wanted to give up, although it was clear that Sherlock was more determined to achieve his goal. Mycroft looked discreetly from side to side. "We have a problem with our mutual friend," he said and knew that Sherlock immediately understood who he was talking about. "Apparently, he was far more organized than we could have imagined. You were sure that you were able to destroy his organization, but our spies have learned that some places are still functioning and are doing good. So good that further procrastination may end badly. We need to find these hiding places and end Moriarty's story for good. "
Molly just stared at him in reproach. "No. I spent the night with Aaron ... he wanted to thank me ..." she added full of anger at her own naivety. "Sherlock returned to the room a few hours later. I thought everything would work out, but Aaron didn't answer my calls and he avoided me since then. I didn't know what was going on, but then Sherlock started to behave so strangely ... I was sad, John and I didn't want to be alone. I used Sherlock's kindness, and now he doesn't speak to me. I don't know what to do anymore ... "she said covering her face.
"To tell the truth, Mrs. Coletti suggested that I finally make up my mind and ask someone trusted for help." He put an empty glass under the bottle that Franco Coletti was holding, completely uninterested in the revelation he had heard. The silence was broken by the sound of pouring wine. He finally looked at the surprised doctor and smiled uncertainly. "Forgive me, John. I was thinking about telling you, but at the same time, I wanted you not to leave your role. Besides, Francesca was in control of everything." He was prepared for an outburst of John's anger, or at least for his grievances and reproaches. To his surprise, the doctor sank heavily into a chair and covered his eyes with his hand, but he didn't seem annoyed or grumpy.
He was too surprised at Holmes's words to pay attention to Lestrade, who was angry at himself for not saving him from the detective's attention.
He walked the rest of the way with his head bowed. His eyes were slowly becoming cloudy and wet. As he sat up in bed, the sad melody played by Sherlock and the hopelessness of the situation made him let his tears trace a path across his cheeks. Finally, he let his emotions take control of him. He cupped his face in his hands as the tears fell one by one onto the floor next to his feet. He was crying but was not sure why exactly. Because he buried his chance to live with Sherlock? Or was he crying because he had lost the possibility of being happy? Were these his last moments when he was so close to Mycroft? How could he look himself in the eye knowing that he had hurt them? He was so sure earlier that his decision was the right one, and now he was starting to regret it. The sudden sound of the interrupted melody caught his attention. He heard as Sherlock was walking across the room. Then his footsteps on the stairs and the slam of the front door.
"Mrs. Hudson?" Another silence. Only muffled voices. This time John decided to listen closely. He pressed the phone to one ear and his hand to the other one. He closed his eyes for better effect. It was a long time before he was able to concentrate on the conversation he heard instead of the children screaming around, their distracted parents, and teenagers listening to the music without any shame.
"Ah... Right. You tell me later about it," he said, tucking his leather wallet into his inside coat pocket.
The surprise John saw on the faces of the others couldn't be different from what he felt at the moment. He seemed to realize that Moran was taking his opinion into account, but they had not been in contact for so long that he almost forgot how it felt. He did not have time to think long, because the group with relief started to prepare the area for a camp. Lucy cleared the place among the trees with kicks, getting rid of branches and small stones. Sebastian and Josh brought wide boughs for everyone to sit on, and Arian pulled out food cans and a few bottles of water. Sherlock decided that the others did not need his help. He sat under the tree and took the pose of a thinker, combining his fingers and putting them under his chin.
Another call irritated John. He went to the table, grabbed the cell phone with a swing and rejected the call again. For some unbelievable reason, Mycroft's phone didn't have a lock screen password, so John sniffed his chance. He chose the message option and wrote the message as soon as he could.
"What do you mean?" Molly asked. She was confused, but before she could ask anything else, John reacted even faster.
John was pressed against the door in an instant. He was completely surprised by Mycroft's sudden move. He grabbed John's throat roughly, pressed his body against the door and attacked him with a kiss. He put his tongue in his mouth. John let out a groan and tried to push the older man away first, but after a while he grabbed him by the front of his clothes and pulled him closer, making the kiss almost painful. Mycroft's hands held his head in one place, dug his fingers into his temple and massaged his blond hair. It was a kiss full of roughness, desperation, and lust. John felt the man's breath, hot cheeks, and trembling body. Mycroft completely lost control. His trembling hands tried to stop John. He didn't want to let him think more about all the things he had shouted a few moments earlier. He kissed him with his eyes closed tightly as if he were afraid to see his reaction.
"Look who is talking ..." Sherlock muttered through gritted teeth. Mycroft looked at him and fell silent for a long time, knowing what he meant by that.
It was too warm and muggy. There was no point in forcing his body to sleep any longer, so John gently and carefully got out of bed. He did not want to wake up his husband because he knew that the last days on the couch were very difficult for him and now he finally had a chance to sleep well. As he stood up, he watched the other man's reaction, but he slept soundly. John left the bedroom and silently closed the door behind him. He was able to take a deep breath now.
"And for you, sir?" the man turned to Mycroft. Holmes was sitting hesitantly for a moment, but when his eyes fell on John, he raised a corner of his mouth with an artificial smile and looked at the owner. "Tea with milk, please".
"What just happened, Mycroft?" John asked after a long, tense moment. He walked alongside his husband, who led him through the narrow streets. Mycroft said nothing but pushed forward with clenched teeth. John couldn't stand it and grabbed his elbow, then turned him around. It was only now that the older man sighed heavily and looked down.
"And the chance that we all will come back home?" This time ladies' man spoke. His voice did not hide his fears but he wanted to know.
"See, John? If you were to live with Mycroft, he would know how to behave from the start. He would pretend to be someone he is not. You wouldn't know about his true nature. My brother and I are very different."
"Too bad it's the end. This is my first time and I think I will always envy Mycroft..." he said, sipping champagne.
"John ..." Aroner touched tenderly doctor's cheek with his lips. "... save this evening for me, please."
"God, John ... I'm so sorry. I'm so stupid that I let him convince me and I betrayed your trust. But he urged me!"
The delicate material slid down Mycroft's neck. He stood upright, composed, cool. A shiver pierced his body at the sight of John's face so close to his own. The moment he felt the touch of silk on his neck and saw John's blue eyes, his body reacted. Their eyes met. John froze and Mycroft's lips moved forward. He leaned quickly, but not fast enough to catch John's lips between his. The doctor who had stood on his toes, now unexpectedly sank to his feet, moving away from Mycroft's face. Genius, however, did not let him do more. He quickly bowed his head and finally kissed him. Deep, with no rush. He enjoyed the gentle touch of his lips. He knew they had longed for it for a long time, though their pride and stubbornness prevented them from admitting it. The kiss deepened with every move. Mycroft sucked John's lower lip. For stability and to show that he would not let him pull away, he held his wrist in his hand, and pressed him firmly against his body with his free arm.
Walking down the street without shoes, he felt every little fold, every crack between stone walkways. They were warm and smooth but irregular. John had to look under his feet because every rub against the pointed surface wounded his already sensitive feet. He missed the times when, as a small child, he did not care about the condition of his legs and did not feel pain when he walked on rough or even sharp stones.
He smiled to himself. Sherlock has always believed in their abilities and that they both can do the impossible. He straightened up and, holding a small pile of medical stuff in his hand, turned to the genius. "Maybe it won't be that bad eventually," he said with slight amusement. "Josh will make time for us with his guitar. Lucy with her comments about life and Arian's curses will help us not to fall into depression." He put the things he was holding in the bag. "But when we get back, we have to think about how to show Mycroft our dissatisfaction with this decision," he said with a raised corner of his mouth.
"Of course, most people do not have such problems. Their skin under the ring does not change. However, people with this condition do not suffer from it for a long time. This kind of wrinkled skin effect lasts less than two months. And you and Mycroft have been married for a few years already, am I right? So you shouldn't have any marks on your skin... "he added with a smile. He kept talking but never took his eyes away from John's tense face. Only now, when he was holding his removed ring in his grip, he looked down at John's fingers with a visible movement of his eyes. John did the same. At that moment, John's hand grew cold and Stoner smiled even wider.
"My meeting with the inspector was pure coincidence. So was the opportunity to see the corpse. Lestrade needed my help because he couldn't contact Phillips. That's all."
"I can't let you walk around the city by yourself, John. I'd go crazy with worrying if you got there safe and sound ..." he said near his ear. Not too loud, but John understood him despite the loud noise surrounding them. John frowned because he didn't like the context of the conversation. He walked forward and didn't care about Aaron, who never stepped away from his side and mumbled something next to his head. John didn't know if he was lost in his thoughts or focused on the goal, but before he knew it, he was already standing in front of the building where Mycroft was waiting for him. He breathed a sigh of relief and stepped inside the hotel without waiting for Aaron's reaction.
Her smile faded slowly as she looked at him and realized her words were not reaching his thoughts. She gave up. She felt embarrassed that she was so visibly ignored, though it wasn't new to her. She looked out the window again and decided to remain silent until the end of the journey.
Dr Hooper found it difficult to assume her earlier attitude, though she tried. She straightened up, lifted her chin and crossed her arms only to lower them a moment later with a heavy sigh. The spark of defiance faded from her eyes gave way to despondency. "I got used to it. I also understand that he is doing this to catch the Ripper."
"By the way, Sherlock ..." he said with audible tiredness. He could barely keep up with his friend's long legs. "What kind of videos have you watched so passionately on your old phone? Molly mentioned she couldn't sleep because of that. These noises woke me up once too."
He trembled for a long time, simultaneously clenching his teeth on John's shoulder, who lay in place and breathed deeply, trying to recover from the spectacular and very pleasant experience. They lay sweaty, tired and relaxed in their embrace because they found each other after many years of searching. They became one body. Their love, though a bit strange and marked by many obstacles, turned out to be real and lasting. They were proof of their love. Despite the difficult moments, they could always rely on each other, they always came back to each other. No matter what they were most important to each other. It was for Sherlock that John came face to face with the greatest fear and anxiety. Fear of rejection. He fought his fears because he loved him just the way he was. Sherlock would not have let him go. He loved the sound of a beating heart and the touch of warm loving fingers that soothingly caressed his hair.
They were closer to Baker Street with each step. They were happy and ready to show their love at any moment. They were in a hurry on Baker Street because the awareness of what they were doing was beginning to engulf their entire bodies. Despite the rush and crowds of thoughts, something was wrong in Sherlock's opinion. He wanted to feel John's skin as quickly as possible. He gently released John's hand. He wanted to wipe the surprise away from his face as soon as possible, so he roughly ripped the glove off his hand and folded his fingers with his friend's fingers.
"I'm sorry, John. I had more things to do than I thought I would have," he said. "This is Aaron Stoner. New Zealand's Minister of Internal Affairs. Mr. Stoner, this is..."
John leaned his back of the head against the back of the seat. "As usual," he sighed. "When I want to know what's going on, you both remain silent. You ignore me and my questions. When I want to help you, you pretend I don't exist," he fell silent and gave Holmes a look full of something that Mycroft couldn't define. "You don't need me," he added quietly.
Of course. Sherlock always knew which room to choose. Of course, he was aware that it was the only free apartment in the hotel, but the fact that his brother would spend the next few days just behind the wall was frustrating for him. He thanked the man and walked to the door. He had to take a few deep breaths before entering the living room without knocking.
"What did my brother do?" he asked when he learned everything. John wanted to shake his head because he still didn't know how Sherlock and Mycroft did it. He sighed and walked to the bedroom door.
Aaron didn't look offended. He sat and stared at John with a funny expression. John could have sworn the man was barely able to restrain from laughing. After a moment, Stoner grinned and looked at John's body. He kept his eyes on his hard gaze and chuckled. The sound was annoying to John, though Aaron's voice was always pleasant and kind. It was one of the few things John liked in Stoner.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow and quietly tapped the umbrella on the pavement. "Are you suggesting I specifically gave the order to drop a corpse just to give Sherlock a job and distract his thoughts from you and what you were doing at night?" he smirked as he watched the area.
John sighed loudly and chuckled. He knew Sherlock liked to annoy his brother. He was convinced Sherlock did it on purpose, but John didn't care. Defending one or the other brother started to tire him, so he gave up and closed his eyes with a smile. He fell asleep for the second time listening to the friend's quiet breaths and strange noises coming from his phone.
Sherlock looked at him. "I don't have any interesting investigations right now, so I decided to take some rest. Besides, Mrs. Hudson whined, she would like some souvenir from Venice, and you will probably forget to bring her something. I also thought to reserve a gondola to see this historic city," he said, folding his hands behind him and straightening proudly.
However, John was a doctor and saw the condition of the older man who was unlikely to be used to discomfort. Mycroft's spine was not in good condition. It hurt him more and more every day and because of this, he was sleepy and irritated. John felt guilty, but he didn't even offer him to share the bedroom. Mycroft was too proud and secretive to reveal his human behavior, even if it was as trivial thing as sleep or rest.
John looked down helplessly at the heaving mass of his belly below him. Quivering and taut and full to bursting beneath Sherlock’s gentle touch as he caressed it lovingly in his hands. John laid his hands slowly on either side of his aching, bloated body, feeling how huge and heavy he’d made himself. Feeling what he’d done to his body.
Sherlock’s hands were on his shoulders, guiding him back with a grunt until he was once again leaning back against the headboard with his stomach resting hot and heavy on his thighs. John whimpered when Sherlock reached around the swollen curve of his belly and below the waistband of his sweatpants, grasping his half-hard cock in his hand and pumping it quickly back to hardness.
John moaned and finally let out his stomach, groaning as it ballooned under his shirt and expanded beneath Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock watched his belly grow from over John’s shoulder and let out his own soft moan, rubbing slowly over John’s heavy, low curve.
“Don’t you want to be full again?” he whispered. He dipped his hands up under John’s shirts, rubbing over his bare skin. “You want to be full and tight again,” he said. “I know you do. You want to be so round.”
He looked down at himself and held his stomach in his hands. “Christ, look what I’ve done,” he whispered. His own voice sounded too loud in the room. The thought of it, the thought of his shameful secret, bursting himself, filled his cock even more. It bobbed as he tried to breathe, weighted down by his hanging belly.
Deep down, Sherlock knew, more intimately than he’d ever known a solution to a case, exactly what he would now be doing every three months.
And he also knew, better than he’d known anything for a long time, that he wouldn’t be posting any more videos to his channel. That he wouldn't be anxiously filming, or editing, or covering his face.
Sherlock knew what to do. Before John could ask for it Sherlock was raising his hands to slide on a large t-shirt over his expanded frame, then helping John settle with a grunt onto his side, covering him with the heavy duvet. He ducked into the bathroom for a few minutes, getting ready for bed and changing into his own t-shirt and pants, before crawling in across from John. John buried his face in the pillow and tried to fight it off, willing himself to feel hidden and safe in the circle of Sherlock’s arms. He tried to forget about the giant curve of his belly resting in between them, rising with his breathing and pushing out against the stretched fabric of the t-shirt Sherlock had given him.
John rubbed along the swollen bottom of his belly as Sherlock fed him smaller bites by hand, fingers brushing slowly across his lips as he chewed and swallowed. He felt bloated and slow, unable to do anything more except lean back and feel himself grow beneath his hands. He let Sherlock gently press bite after bite of pasta and red sauce between his lips. He looked down and moaned at the sight of his belly, packed full and covered in stretched white skin, pushing out further from his body than he’d ever seen it before. Each breath shot pain through his tight upper belly as his lungs strained against the extra weight. The food was starting to churn hot and lethargically, increasing the heavy pressure behind his stretched navel.
John grinned when he finally spotted it – a remnant from a couple years back when he’d wanted to give it a try. He hadn’t been big enough, then, to be able to stretch enough to handle it – the fizzing and the expansion. It had been too painful too quickly, and his YouTube post for that time had had to be cut a few planned minutes short, since the swelling in his belly had been too painful and snuffed out the pleasure with pain.
His deft fingers were suddenly on his belt, arms reaching around below the huge curve of his belly. He looked up at the ceiling as his belt slid out of the buckle, then he reached up with one hand and held it to the front of his belly, arm nearly fully extended so he could reach the farthest point. He moaned and pressed hard against his swollen stomach, holding it in while his other hand frantically tore at the button and zipper on his jeans. He held his stomach in for another breathless second after his jeans were undone, groaning under his breath, then in one huge gasp of air he let it all out. His stomach nearly doubled in size, surging out ahead of him into the new space. It caused the t-shirt hem to roll up over the huge curve of his belly, resting just above his navel where it pressed into his tight skin.
He moaned, deep in his chest, and forced down one more painful swallow before he dropped the now empty bottle to the ground. He was finished.
He was bloated, huge, obscenely stuffed until his pregnant belly looked like it would burst beneath his hands. It dwarfed the rest of his compact body, hung painfully between his hips and down from his chest. It looked like it was swelling beyond his control, as the cola continued to fizz and swell inside of him, pressing out against his completely full skin, pushing behind his stretched navel.
John knew he would have to go into the bathroom soon for a piss and a shower, but before then, he slowly walked away from the mirror and crawled onto his bed. The cool sheets caressed his hot, naked skin. He rolled onto his side, slowly so the liquid in his belly wouldn’t cramp, and he cradled the curve of his full belly in his hands. It rested warmly against his thighs as it spilled before him onto the mattress. The skin expanded as he breathed.
“God, yeah,” the man breathed, so quietly Sherlock barely noticed he even made a sound. The man rolled his head back on his neck as he kept rubbing his stomach, slowly, as if he had all the time in the world. Finally, he looked back down and gave the top of his stomach a small pat, right over the tight curve which jutted out to the roundest swell of his belly. He placed his palm on the curve and rubbed his thumb once where his navel would be under his shirt, then he reached forward again, grabbed another full gallon that had been hiding off camera, and, without any fanfare at all, brought the new one to his lips.
Sherlock’s hands felt incredible rubbing his belly. They soothed the skin that had been stretched the night before, and calmed the churning in his gut as he continued to digest the mass he’d consumed. John looked down at the mass of his belly cresting away from his body under his shirt and moaned as Sherlock’s hands continued to caress it. He nodded against Sherlock’s chest. “Yes.”
“So big,” he moaned, rubbing over his stretched stomach. He closed his eyes and focused on the feel of his hands tracing his over-sensitive skin. “I’m too full,” he breathed. He pressed hard against the tight skin, feeling no give. “Stuffed myself too full, too huge . . .”
Suddenly Sherlock noticed that the man himself was erect in his jeans. He couldn’t believe he hadn’t noticed before how the man’s full cock was straining within the denim, now even more obvious that his zipper was pulled down. It bobbed as he waddled forward for a step to arch his back more, pressing his stomach out before him.
John grunted and threw his t-shirt back down to cover himself, then pulled on another large jumper before walking out into the living room, making sure his steps weren’t too heavy so his belly wouldn’t move.
He clicked it, and he put his earbuds back into his ears with shaking fingers. He looked quickly left and right, even though he was sitting alone in his flat in the middle of the night. Just as the seven-minute video finally loaded, he sat back against the hard wood of the kitchen chair, silently loosened the belt in his trousers, then gently placed his hand between his legs over the expensive wool cloth. He told himself he was simply sitting with his hand in his lap.
“Why are you holding it in?” Sherlock whispered. He rested his hands along the lowest part of John’s belly, the part of his stomach that he couldn’t suck in flat no matter how hard he tried. It bulged underneath Sherlock’s hands, puffing out his two layers of shirts.
He was just about to either sink to the floor or try to haul himself to the sink, when, instead, a sudden idea made John stop in his tracks.
“I feel huge,” he said. John caught sight of the flaming heat in Sherlock’s eyes and said something he never thought he’d have the courage to say. He groaned and pushed his belly out farther into the room, holding it up from below with one hand while the other hand rubbed back and forth over the top, caressing himself like he was pregnant. “Look at how full I am,” he said with heavy lidded eyes. “Look at this huge belly hanging off me. Look how full –”
John forced down the last swallow of milk and threw back his head, groaning at the sharp pain as his belly continued to bloat. He looked sideways at himself and gasped.
Finally John pressed a last kiss to Sherlock’s lips and stepped back. Sherlock reached for John’s jumper lying on the couch to hand to him, but John waved it away. Instead he turned and walked towards the kitchen, letting his belly hang full and heavy ahead of him as he loosened his muscles, feeling the delicious way it waddled as it led the way into the room. He moaned for full effect as he moved, then turned to the side and rubbed along his full belly for Sherlock to see.
John shivered. They never did this. Usually months went by in between nights like last night, and they had never ever done it during the day. Sherlock continued to cup the bottom of his belly in his hands. “Please, John,” he whispered. “Just let yourself be.”
The man moved from his navel to rubbing huge, round circles over the full skin of his belly, caressing every part of it in his hands as he took in a deep breath and pushed it out even more, moaning hard at the new stretch.
And now Sherlock’s mouse was somehow hovering over that ridiculous video to watch it. The video with a title which was simply the date it was taken – just three days before. It had over five thousand views.
Sherlock’s spine shivered as he suddenly wondered what noise it would make for those tanned palms to run over the smooth skin of that pale stomach. If they would rasp against the hairs. If this man would also moan.
He forced himself not to look away. He rubbed his hands over his belly, watching himself, then he arched his back and moaned. “Look at it,” he breathed. He pressed his belly farther into his hands, watching himself touch his skin. “You’re too stuffed to move. . .” he whispered, holding his gaze in the mirror. “Can’t even walk. Can’t even breathe. . .”
He felt huge and exposed, the way his bare belly pressed forward into the kitchen as he huffed for breath, and his face burned at the knowledge that he was searching for something to stuff it even more, make it tighter, make his belly even heavier so he could barely walk.
He was completely helpless, barely able to move, weighted down with the bloated belly he’d made. The one he was holding in his hands, rubbing to try and soothe. He watched his arms reach forward to try and hold it up, the way it ballooned out from his body farther than he’d ever even though possible. More massive and round than any belly he’d ever seen in other videos online.
And yet . . . he was still hard. Harder, almost, than he had even been while doing the original stuffing in the first place. Something about it. . . it felt good. New. To be enjoying his body just for himself, in his own privacy, as if it was something he could do for
The man stood there for another moment looking down at his feet. His toned arms flexed, revealing hard lines of muscle under suntanned skin. He ran one of his palms slowly up his other forearm, trailing over the soft bed of blonde hair, and he took a deep breath through his nose which lasted a few seconds before letting it out in a long exhale. Sherlock couldn’t see his eyes beneath the shadow from the cap, but he knew without a doubt that they were softly closed.
And as his belly swelled, and his skin stretched to cover what he’d done to his body, the man simply held himself with both hands, tipped his head up to the ceiling, and moaned, “Yes . . . fuck . . .
John was just finishing his third glass when he felt Sherlock’s hands start to rub at his straining sides, rubbing along the length of his jutting out stomach which felt warm and heavy with water. His belly pushed harder against Sherlock’s each time he drew in a breath, and the top curve of his stomach felt tight and packed as the water slowly worked its way down further into his body.
Sherlock couldn’t believe the stillness in the man’s body – the way his spine stood ramrod straight and yet soft. The way his legs planted him firmly into the earth where he stood in a three-quarter view to the camera. The way he didn’t flinch away, or curl into himself. The way he radiated calm.
He would be sitting there, in his empty flat, refreshing this man’s page, with his own trousers unzipped, and tissues at hand.
Wildly, Sherlock wiped off his sullied hand on his trousers, not caring about the stain, and clicked on the man’s username to see the rest of the videos. The other users’ videos suggested on the side all had ridiculous usernames, all about stuffing or bloating with some random combination of numbers.
He let his hand fall away from his over-sensitive cock as the pleasure started to fade from his limbs. He was panting, leaning back against the wall for all his support, pulled downward by the heavy weight of his heaving belly.
John dipped his finger into the dip of his navel and groaned at the pressure. He needed this. Badly. He nodded yes leaning back against Sherlock, and Sherlock leaned down to kiss him on his cheek with a grin. “Excellent.”
John shivered, a full-body shiver, then unwrapped the first packet of mentos. He could feel his belly heaving with each deep breath, with barely any room to expand. The thought of being stretched even fuller, to grow heavier, to his absolute limit, made his cock thicken even more, until John could feel the blood pool in the bottom of his gut and swell his cock to a full erection. It pressed lightly against his belly, and John leaned back against his bedroom wall, bare skin against the plain white, as he closed his eyes and arched his back, causing his erection to drag along the stretched skin of his stomach.
Sherlock’s fingers started to trace his erection through no will of his own, pressing against the hard skin through his trousers. He could already feel himself leaking as the sounds of the man’s swallows and soft grunts filled his ears – the quick breaths through his nose, and the sighs in the back of his throat.
He drained the glass, and Sherlock quickly refilled it. John could see as he drank that Sherlock was looking down at both of their stomachs, watching as John’s slowly filled out more against his. Sherlock pulled him gently closer by his hips, close enough that John’s stomach started to pang a little as it pressed inwards from the pressure.
And he realized, in retrospect, that the bump under his shirt just beneath his shoulder on his chest – the little detail his mind had noticed while he was busy masturbating like an idiot – must have been a raised scar, likely from some sort of trauma.
Everyone was focused on the last few seconds of the video, the part where John let himself moan freely and stroke his erection through his jeans. John blushed reading the filthy words appearing on his screen – asking him to smear his semen over his belly, telling him he looked pregnant, ripe and ready to burst, telling him they’d get themselves off rutting against his tight stomach. And those were only the ones that he could get through reading without looking away.
Sherlock realized, all at once, that he was half-hard beneath his own palm. He froze, unable to decide whether to move his hand away, or press down to rub friction over his swelling cock. Whether to slam his laptop shut or turn up the volume of the man’s breaths.
“Christ, John, look at you,” Sherlock whispered from over his shoulder. John felt Sherlock’s growing erection firm and warm in the dip of his lower back. Sherlock covered John’s hands with his own and pressed, groaning when John’s skin didn’t have much give. “Think of how full you want to be,” he said. “How full and huge and heavy you can grow.”
Sherlock’s hands slowly rubbed him, and John watched mesmerized between sips as Sherlock’s fingers caressed his pale, growing skin. He moved on to the second mug, taking a moment to breathe deeply and willing his stomach to settle. Sherlock suddenly grabbed his belly and shook it once hard, and John groaned when his belly didn’t have much room to jiggle. It moved as a single tight mass. It felt perfect.
this. He didn’t keep himself stuffed full for so long after he orgasmed and shut the camera off, and he didn’t go on drinking even more water while he sat there editing and uploading the video afterwards, and he sure as hell didn’t go back and re-watch his own bloody videos, getting off at the sight of his own body ballooning under his hands, whimpering at the pain he could still feel dully aching through his packed gut.
The video began on just the plain white wall. Sherlock held his breath, waiting for the man to appear. When he did, he walked slowly into frame with his shirt pulled down, looking down at his feet so the hat brim shielded his face. His stomach was nearly flat beneath the shirt – just a tiny, soft bulge that barely revealed itself. Nothing that would indicate that what Sherlock had seen in the video’s thumbnail was about to happen. Nothing at all.
"I had no idea that he would be in this hotel. I found out he lived on the other side of town and I have absolutely no idea why he was here. Although I have my suspicions..."
He turned his head to make sure his friend was there. Sherlock stood a few feet away behind the soundproof window. He watched the training and talked to Mycroft. Actually he listened to his brother's monologue with a serious expression. When his eyes met John's, he straightened up, raised his head, and gave him a barely visible smile. John didn't know what made his friend take this attitude every time he felt his eyes on him. He did not know many other things and was irritated by it. Sherlock hasn't spoken much since they came to this secret place. He was silent and he watched closely all members of the group. But for some reason, John felt that he was under his closest observation. He saw a strange determination in his behavior and a desire to be in his company, yet he spoke rarely. Also, these stares ... For some time he realized that it was not ordinary, friendly looks. There was something strange in Sherlock's eyes. He looked at him differently. The stares were sometimes furtive, which made him even more curious because from the beginning of their acquaintance Sherlock did not feel embarrassed to look at something that interested him. This time, however, it was different. Genius looked down every time John wanted to force him to a confrontation. He looked ashamed of something. John blamed it on stress and preparation for the mission. He couldn't find another more sensible justification of why his friend was looking at him with the expression of a depressed man.
"Sherlock! Sherlock! Dear Lord. What happened here?" Mrs. Hudson entered the room. Red cheeks stood out from her pale face. She was panting. "Are you all right?"
Francesca tactfully and respectfully continued to express her thoughts aloud. "But I see it is a good choice. You are happy. I see it. You fit together and I don't see other people than John next to you. You feel good in your partnership."
"... You are looking for a person who will provide you with security and understanding, and on the other hand someone who will not threaten you with boredom", the stranger's voice was slightly haughty. Assessors. He sat motionless, hidden from the moonlight. "But at the moment you are most likely looking for a murderer."
This time, he wasn’t sure at all why he’d left in those last few seconds of touching himself. He decided he couldn’t even really be bothered to care what the reason was. He’d just trimmed off the end of the video like usual, then, for some reason, moved the editing bar just a few centimeters to the right, burning up the back of his neck as he watched the soundless thumbnail footage showing his hand reach down between his legs.
John handed the empty glass back to Sherlock and cupped his groaning belly in his hands, feeling how much rounder it was beneath his palms. His skin was tight and hot. He resisted the urge to lean forward and suck it in and instead took a deep breath and loosened his muscles even more, watching his belly stretch even further as it pushed forward.
And Sherlock had been just about to wipe his internet history, shut his laptop, and take a long, cold shower, when his eyes suddenly landed on one of the suggested videos to the right. It was just a tiny thumbnail of a man standing in front of a plain white wall. He had a camouflage ballcap pulled down low to cover his face, and a pair of faded, old jeans, and a plain white t-shirt.
Sherlock whispered in his ear. “I want to see you like this all day,” he said. “So huge and round. I want you to waddle with your belly when you walk.” John whimpered and continued to drink. Sherlock swirled around his navel, causing pleasure and pain to spike in John’s groin.
Sherlock’s breathing was loud and raspy. John’s stomach was stretched unbelievably full, jutting out and tight against Sherlock’s palms. The pressure under his skin was immense, making him feel almost unable to move as every inch of his belly filled and expanded, swelling until his stretched thin skin couldn’t grow any tighter or rounder.
Finally Sherlock pulled back. “Fucking drink this,” he said, thrusting the liter of soda water into John’s hands.
John took Sherlock’s hand and followed him into the bedroom. He slowed down and gasped when he caught sight of himself in a mirror, huge and waddling with his belly swaying heavily out in front of him. He wrapped one arm gently around his stomach and held it as he walked, wincing slightly as his stretched skin ached under the unfamiliar strain. It moved as a solid mass in front of him, not jiggling like his normal soft tummy but instead stretched taut and round. The sight of himself – bare and indulgent and bursting – made him want to simultaneously cover himself and also caress his full belly with his hands. Feel what he’d done to himself under his palms.
Sherlock sat across from him and held a brimming over plate of leftover pasta in his hand, fork poised halfway to John’s mouth. John took a deep breath, letting his stomach rest, and then he nodded. Sherlock grinned.
And for some reason, more than anything, he thought once more of the strong line of the man’s jaw. The quiet confidence in his spine and hands. The desperate, quiet sounds of his sighs when he first began to drink.
His hand was still slowly rubbing his belly as he drank, and Sherlock’s eyes watched it swell and tighten with each swallow, pushing out with each breath. The man traced leisurely circles over his body, from his hips to his chest over the round, growing curve, cupping his palm around the tightening skin. The t-shirt was straining even more at the sides, and the hem of it cut into his belly where it swelled.
And then, before he could stop himself, John waddled to the side, leaning back against the wall for support, and he opened his eyes.
“Gonna burst –” he groaned again, then the beginnings of a wild whine left his throat, and he tipped his head back, pure bliss on his shadowed face, as the hand between his legs suddenly rubbed once along his erection.
The man tipped his head back even more to catch the last drips of liquid, which caused his rounding stomach to push out into his palm, forming a round curve that started from just under his chest and swelled above his hips. It stretched further out into his hand with each slow inhale as he breathed.
Sherlock silently handed him the first mug, and John slowly began to drink. They flipped on the telly, watching whatever random show Sherlock found. John was halfway through the first mug when he could feel his stomach start to protest. It churned and lurched a bit in front of him, and the top of his belly started to round out again. The milk felt warm and heavy as it settled in his still-packed stomach. He arched his back and pushed out his belly, trying to make more room.
The t-shirt looked like it was ready to rip. The man’s navel was fully extended now, bursting out against the tight fabric which was cutting into his skin. His jeans were slung low across his hips, and his belly was starting to spill over the front, bursting out for more space.
Sherlock longed to see his face without the shadow of the cap. How he would be looking down at himself in shock and awe. Pure pleasure and pain. He could just make out, in the shadows on the man’s face, that he licked his lips.
John shook his head, leaning back against Sherlock and pulling in his stomach as best he could, trying to breathe normally.
He lazily wrapped his other arm around the bottom of his belly and pushed it up, rounding it out even more as he filled himself with more long swallows of milk. Sherlock’s breathing quickened behind him. He began to whisper in John’s ear with a deep voice. “Think of how heavy you are,” he said, clutching John’s heaving belly as he drank. “You’ve never gotten so huge in your life. Never been so full for so long.”
Sherlock snorted in disbelief. John, on the other hand, felt compassion for older Holmes. He saw the desperation in his behavior and how much effort it had to cost him.
John realized he was standing motionless when Mycroft pulled him gently into the room. They were passed by many other pairs. People bowed slightly and smiled as they looked at them. John and Mycroft had to stop to say hello to some, but after a while, Mycroft led John to the other end of the room again. At some point, they heard a familiar voice.
He put a hand on Sherlock's neck. He met his eyes and pulled slowly downward, bringing his lips together in a gentle kiss. They rubbed their lips, pecking lightly and sucking the skin unobtrusively. John was patient, slow. He allowed Sherlock to enjoy their kiss for the first time and learn what he desired. He allowed him to deepen and control the kiss. He had to admit that his friend was a quick learner.
Holmes saw a nod. He lifted the corner of his mouth and turned to the door. "And I recommend you to choose another doctor for your investigations. The Police Department will benefit from this decision".
"Thanks to this, we will get to the crime scene without any obstacles ..." He tied the handkerchief through the horse curb and returned to his seat.
When Mycroft's next request met with no response, John decided to act. He threw off the sheets in one move and walked over to shocked Sherlock. He was embarrassed by his nakedness and later - after returning home - he admitted that it was one of the bolder things he did. However, now he had to stop this very cheerful scene, so he put down his pride and shame. He stood naked in front of his closest friend and pushed him out of the room. It was not a very difficult task, because the man was too shocked and probably a little embarrassed. When he slammed the door behind Sherlock, he leaned his forearm against the doorframe and lowered his head.
"... Grazie, signora," he added and looked at Stoner again. Aaron never took his eyes off him, just watched him with that gleam in his eyes and an insolent smile on his face. "Francesca and I have been here recently. She is a wonderful woman and I am not surprised even Mycroft likes her," he said, then reached for one of the glasses.
John looked into his eyes for a moment. They stood in silence and the atmosphere between them became more intimate. Finally, John nodded slightly and walked alongside his pretend husband to the building.
"A few streets away is a shop with more appropriate souvenirs." John tried to gently let her know that a more expensive gift would both last longer and looks better. He did not mean that she would spend a lot of money, he could even pay extra if she did not have so much cash. He just wanted her not to regret her decision later. It is true that he sincerely doubted that Greg would not like anything he would get from Molly. However, he preferred to spend money on the right gift and believed that the girl thought the same.
"I didn't mean to force you to come," the older man added finally. John just smiled under his breath, squeezing his hand more tightly.
John was a heavy sleeper. When he was tired he could only be woken by the sound of a pager at work or strange smells coming from the kitchen, where Sherlock experimented with various substances. However, this time he woke up when he heard soft tapping and very quiet noises from the phone. It sounded like somebody's moaning. He opened his eyes and it took him a moment to figure out where he was. He was still in the same position, but he wasn't alone. His friend lay next to him and was looking at something on his phone. John couldn't see what Sherlock was watching but he wasn't actually interested. He focused completely on his friend's face.
The gondolier was unlucky that night. Each of his rides ended early enough that he could not add an extra fee for each subsequent ten-minute trip. As soon as customers found out what the next minute would cost, they quickly gave up and decided to reach their destination on foot. He was now flowing calmly through a narrow channel. He quietly hoped that he eventually would find a specific customer who decided to take a longer ride. He paddled slowly towards the main harbor. Dark passages put him in a gloomy mood, which is why, he decided to whistle his favorite tune to improve his mood as usual in such situations. He took a deep breath, closed his mouth and was about to blow the first note of the song when something suddenly flickered above his head. He straightened up, raised his eyes and froze in place. A few feet above him, he saw three figures leaping between balconies. One of them had a long dress pulled up almost to the middle of her thighs. He focused all his attention on her. He stopped the gondola, raised the visor of the cap with his finger and leaned on the paddle.
Only now a slight relaxation broke into the corners of his mouth. He looked like he was smiling. "Watson ..." he said softly, leaving even more fog on the glass. "One thing is to correctly name the murderer and another to prove him his murder and gather compelling evidence of his guilt. Unfortunately, our law frees criminals too easily, so to catch him, we need something that will unquestionably connect him to the crime scene and murder".
John was not born yesterday. He knew what was in the purple wrapper. Even Sherlock's quick reaction, who immediately covered the wrapper with his shoe didn't help. His move was desperate. He froze and did not look up. John had every reason to believe his supposition was true. He sat without a word, staring at the empty glass on the table, not even knowing about Sherlock's terrified look. It was time to go home.
John noticed that Mycroft had been sitting quietly for some time and tried not to look at the last pieces of pizza. The dish he ordered, he ate long ago and only drank wine that marked his influence on his face more and more. Sherlock discussed something unimportant with Molly and paid no attention to anything. John studied Mycroft. He wanted to shake his head, but instead, he leaned over the table, took a piece of pizza and put it on the plate of an older genius. Mycroft frowned but said nothing. John noticed and liked the fact that he never commented on the strange behavior of someone in the company of others. He accepted without a word what was happening around with unchanged expression and calmness. He let things be put on his documents and laptop. He didn't react when someone moved it or treated it like air. That's why John wasn't surprised when Mycroft didn't react to his gesture. He had to put his plate under his nose to provoke some reaction.
