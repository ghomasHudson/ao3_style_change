Cas blinked fast and closed his eyes, focusing. He exhaled and when he opened his eyes they were back to their normal blue.
“No, no you’re good. It’s Sam who have a dirty mind” Dean answered, looking at his brother, chuckling.
“I-I found…what you...” Cas came even closer, Dean swallowed “On the computer…”
“It’ll be okay Sammy. I’ll be fine.”
He sat back down, drinking and waking up slowly. “I’m sorry I’m not more present Cas.”
He looked at his hands, strong and softer than they used to be, less calloused than before when he used to hunt and work on his car all the time. He still worked on her of course, but she was less high-maintenance than before. He always found excuses to go for a ride, groceries, walking Miracle around, they would be out of beers or pie…
appeared out of nowhere. She sat on it, resting her hands on either side, her legs crossed in an elegant manner. Sam couldn’t help but be amused by his favourite Scottish witch. “Go on lad, do explain what is troubling you.”
Y O U
“I’m peachy!” He said, half a chuckle in his voice, making an “okay” sign with his hand. Sam could see his worry but kept quiet.
“I told you. There are some things I don’t know. It’s hard to rebuild something when you don’t have the full picture.”
He smiled back humbly, and left the room with Castiel and Dean, leaving her with Sam.
“Okay boys. Yes, keep me posted.
Eileen came at some point to give Dean some coffee. He thanked her but didn’t even drink it. He was simply unable to let go of Castiel’s hand. Not again. Not ever.
He walked out of the room, heading to Jack’s room. The kid didn’t amass anything of much during his life here. He flicked on the light, looking at the place. Everything was neatly stored and nothing out of order. Jack had cleaned everything before leaving to Heaven. He had left the room impeccable. Dean approached his nightstand. Nothing stood out, and when he opened the drawer, he found nothing but a small wooden box. He sat on the bed and opened it carefully. There were some photographs, candies and amulets. Souvenirs. Memory of passed times. Happiest ones. And underneath all the trinkets, a piece of parchment, folded in half. Only one word inscribed on it.
“It ain’t just Heaven, Dean.” he said, looking fondly at Dean like a father would. “It’s the Heaven you deserve.”
“Morning” Sam said, continuing to cook his eggs.
“Hmm…Cas these were top notch sandwiches.” He licked his fingers and sipped his beer.
“You found my research?” Cas’ eyebrows were raised. His hand had closed on the hunter’s flannel, tugging at it.
“We’re going to bring him back. And when we do, you’ll get to tell him.”
“How did I know, what? If I loved her?”
“It’s alright Sam. I understand. You were hurting.”
“Because, your eyes shine more brightly in the sunlight, you’re even more beautiful.” He said factually, picking up a card.
“I’m gonna head out guys, I’m pretty beat. You mind?” Bobby asked the boys.
Cas broken body, bent at impossible angles, smiling and dying, repeating the words “
Dean then listed all the songs on the tape. Beginning by Stairway to Heaven and ending by…
“Castiel.” Jack eyes met the angel’s “I would do it, if this is your wish.” He smiled softly “I would do anything for you, you’re my father.”
“Yes, and beers if you want.”
Sure enough, when he arrived, Sam was there. Listening to the radio, cooking scrambled eggs and waiting for toasts to be done. When Sam saw Dean enter, he grabbed a mug and poured coffee in it, black, no sugar and no cream. He set the mug on the table behind him for his brother to drink.
“In his room, stupid. It’s the only place with the warding.” Sam rolled his eyes. “But you
“Dean…” he looked away.
“I’ll take the week with Eileen then.” He said, while getting up and leaving his fork and plate in the sink. He left the kitchen and the dishes for Dean to wash and clean, very passive-aggressive of him, Dean thought.
“Please Cas…Please” Sam cried, hopeless “Please…” He turned around and Dean could see the motive of his distress laying behind him. It was Eileen, her stomach was bleeding or had been bleeding heavily and she had tears of blood rolling down her face. She seemed to be unconscious.
“You call me, son. If you need anything. Anything.” Bobby had kept repeating to Dean over and over.
He answered back, continuing after a pause.
“Do you?” Dean asked, looking him in the eyes. “Then why did you think I didn’t feel the same? Why did you think it was enough for me
It was the seventh day of research and everyone was completely beat. Groups of hunters had shifted around the bunker, just for a change in scenery or simply to compare notes and review the different piles of ‘most promising’ leads stacked up everywhere.
Dean heard him but couldn’t process it. Maybe it was Heaven…but why didn’t he
The angel’s eyes opened drowsily, then closed again. Dean stopped breathing. He opened them again a few times, looking around at the walls and ceiling covered in warding. For a moment it seemed like he panicked, his pupils dilatating. Once his eyes found Dean’s he stopped moving. He seemed shocked and confused. Completely lost. Dean marvelled at him and at the blue shades of his irises. He was in shock but still beautiful, still Cas.
“Yes, I should be able to cure her cecity and her madness.”
“Yes, we’re bringing him back girl.” He said, falling knees in the mud, not a care in the world, hugging Miracle. “we’re bringing Cas back”.
“Come on, get your shirt off.” Sam said to Dean. He executed the order, taking his shirt off and putting it aside, next to the feather. He sat on a chair close by, Sam sitting in front of him. He needed to draw symbols on Dean’s chest and back with lamb’s blood mixed with burned stinging nettle. He dipped a paintbrush in the mixture and started copying Rowena’s drawing he had on a piece of paper. Dean stood still while his brother worked.
“You don’t have to help…” Dean was cut half-sentence by his brother, “You’re not. That’s not negotiable.” Sam looked into his brother’s eyes, and Dean could see he had just as much intent in helping him that Dean had in finding a way to break into the Empty.
“I can’t reach Jack. Or Heaven.”
Castiel looked into his eyes “I thought you’d like it.” he rolled over and combed Dean’s hair backwards.
At first, Dean was shocked to realise that so many people dropped everything to help him in his search. Even the ones he didn’t even know, hell, the ones he never even
Dean came back in the room suddenly, looking at the angel. “Cas?” he said worried
Dean had dozed off and woke up because he felt suddenly cold. He frowned when he didn’t see Castiel next to him, or in the room for that matter. He looked around; his boots were still there. He got up to get dressed, stepping into his pair of jeans and slipping on a tee and blue flannel. He had only slept for an hour. He felt like maybe Cas was somewhere in the bunker, probably playing with Miracle. He headed to the kitchen to make himself a cup of coffee, he felt kind of tired.
The Empty could have taken him now for all he cared. This was what true happiness felt like. Having loved and being loved.
“What?” Dean said, a finger on the latch.
He said nothing and simply looked at her, wiping a damp cloth on the old coffee maker.
Dean kept the letter in his hands. Reading the words all over again. He couldn’t look away.
Castiel frowned and sighed, clenching his teeth. “Dean. We bring her to my room, maybe the warding will be enough.”
“Why would he do that?”
“Let’s go to work.” Dean repeated for the others, and for himself.
Dean was standing in a clearing, birds singing around him, green hills in the distance. He thought to himself “well, at least I made it to Heaven…”. He thought about it for a second and was surprised to see that he was peaceful with the idea of being dead. He should have been pissed, surely. He died when he thought he was starting a new life. Free at last. And he died on a fucking nail. Yet somehow, he was…peaceful. Maybe it was an effect of Heaven on him. Still him, but less angry and conflicted.
“Where is the…” Castiel said to himself, looking for the flour. He checked the cupboards and finally found it after some time. “That’s not so complicated.” he squinted at the computer screen, analysing the recipe.
Cas walked by his side, Dean leading the way.
“Dean…are you scared?”
Dean woke up at the smell of coffee invading his nostrils. He opened his eyes, hearing voices. What time was it? What happened?
“That kid of yours, ‘fore he went…wherever, made some changes here. Busted my ass out.”
“Who are you texting?”
“No! Of course not!” Cas stopped him “Jack. It’s not about
“I should have known…” Cas breathed.
Sam walked in Dean’s bedroom. Sighing at the sad sight of his brother lying in bed. Again. He placed a cup of black coffee on Dean’s nightstand and carefully put Castiel’s photograph up against the lamp, safe away from the liquid. He went out without a word, grabbing Miracle’s leash on his way out. Dean rolled on his side, looking at the mug. He sat on his bed, put on his headphones and hit “play” on his tape player and
Castiel cleared his throat. So, this was the time then.
“Cas? Why do you smell so good?” Dean breathed out, meeting the angel’s eyes.
Before Dean got back to Cas’ room, he stopped by his bedroom to change since his shirt was completely ruined with coffee stains and he needed to get dressed anyway. He put on a black shirt and green flannel; the one Eileen told him made ‘his eyes sparkle’ whatever that meant… but he thought he looked good in it. He slipped on a pair of jeans and headed to Cas’ room. He was feeling fine today, energetic even.
Dean left them, and went back to the library to work on more books, in English and not in Enochian or Hebrew hopefully. Charlie was there with Stevie. They were both perusing old books, scribbling notes on pieces of paper when they found something worth getting more into. Stevie was scanning a book to translate it later. Dean said nothing and randomly picked another book to study. This one was in English. It dealt with other dimensions and rifts through time and space. Not sure if it would help, but worth a try.
“It ain’t nothing, son.” He said, accepting a call from another hunter.
Jack narrowed his eyes, tilting his head. “I guess I can take a break tonight. See you then.” He said before disappearing. Dean was left alone with Miracle, only the wind and the lapping of the water deranging the silence.
Dean nodded and Jack was gone, evaporating into thin air.
Of course, Dean could feel the angel’s gaze on him but said nothing. Castiel had stopped reading his mind after the first day, stating that Dean only needed telling him what he was comfortable with. Dean looked back at moments, almost catching the angel staring back, but never quite. He smiled softly without him knowing, looking at his blue eyes and confused look who always seem to be on his face. Yes, he was not human. He was an angel. But he was
“You can’t control everything, Dean. She’s suffering and I can help her.”
“Heaven ain’t just reliving your golden oldies anymore, it’s what it always should have been” Bobby continued, looking peacefully in the distance. “Everyone happy, everyone together.”
“Not this time Sammy. I can’t ignore it this time.” Dean said sniffling. “And I’m tired of crying … man I don’t recognise myself.”
“Yeah? When? Because all I see is no progress. Nothing! And Cas is still rotting in there!” He shouted, waving the list in the air. “He’s there and we’re here, and it’s not fair Sammy! He sacrificed himself for me and I can’t even bring him back!” He had looked at Rowena, furious. He couldn’t control himself these last few weeks and he had been drinking again. “I can’t even do that for him! All this is useless that’s what it is!” He threw away the list, letting it land on the floor.
“And I’ll do it again.” he stared at the angel, licking his lips. How could he look so good? Damn… it wasn’t fair.
“Interco- Cas!” Dean chuckled “I think you’ve killed the mood anyway.” truth was, the angel could have taking him right here on the table. He shook his head. He wanted everything to be perfect, to be good between us. He didn’t need to rush things. He settled for something else “I’m very tired. I think I’ll probably go to bed.” It was getting late anyway and he was pretty beat.
Sam heard a knock on the door but didn’t move.
. He couldn’t even say or
“You…
“Dean… It’s okay” looking back at his brother. “The ingredients are in there, and I need the warding to call her.”
“It’s alright. Actually… Cas left me something else before he left. I was supposed to give it to you when…”
Dean chuckled; Cas was always so literal. “No… I mean, I’m here in bed with you, crying. I’m telling you I love you, you’re the only one for me. You changed me, Cas. I’m not the same person you rescued in Hell.”
“Well, you need to rest.” Cas met his eyes. “I don’t want you hurt.” he stroked his face lovingly making Dean’s heart melt like he didn’t think possible.
to. I owe him that. And more. I have to.” And Sam could see that Dean was not backing down. He did not know all about the intricacies that linked his brother to the angel but the bound was profound and strong. Unbreakable. He didn’t know what happened in the last moments between them, but he knew Dean was hiding something from him. Still, he loved his brother and would do anything to help or support him.
Tears rolled off of Dean’s face, uncontrollably. Castiel had written a letter to Jack. His vision blurred and his throat hurt like hell. His shoulders shook from the agonizing waves of pain burning through him. This was the reason why Jack wasn’t answering any of his prayers. He was listening to Cas, remodelling Heaven. But why didn’t Jack take the letter with him like Cas instructed him to? And what was the words Jack needed to remember?
Heaven?” Dean said waving his hands in the air, incredulous.
“Coffee is not enough, Sam.”
“It’s me.” Dean said again, catching Castiel in his arms, holding him close. “It’s me.” he hugged him tight and whispered “You’re safe. We’re safe.” And he felt Cas’ arms hugged him back. “We’re safe.”
“You’re ticklish.” Castiel stated, registering the info for later. “I love you, Dean.” He felt Dean’s hand combing through his hair absently, upwards and backwards, relaxing him.
After Bobby left, it was only Dean and Sam in the room, finishing to pick up the last bottles laying around the table. At some point Dean stopped to look at his brother. His baby brother who had sacrificed more than once for him, and for whom Dean had also sacrificed.
“What?” Sam looked at him “No. It’s too dangerous.”
“Jody, Donna. You are…something else.”
“Yes. It will.” Dean cupped his face with his other hand, making the angel look at him. He knew he couldn’t resist his eyes. They were one of Castiel’s weakness, evidently. “But it’ll be a good change. I’ll make it good for you. I want all of you, Cas. If you want me too.”
“Well? Did you do it?” Dean gestured at his chest “Are you all warded up?”
A note laid on top of the hollow shaft, wrapped around fuzzy charcoal feathers. This time it was Dean’s name written on it.
should open it.” Jack said, repeating Castiel’s words. “It was…personal.”
“I-I think…yes I could.”
“Drink this, Jack” Sam had suddenly turned back and ushered Jack to drink. He gulped the potion in one big swallow and grimaced at the taste. Rowena put the last ingredient in the bowl, a piece of Castiel’s feather and recited an Enochian chant. A rift opened in the room, cold air seeping out of it. Jack passed through it, not looking back. He needed to act fast. Or Dean would not make it.
“Can you do it now?” Castiel looked at Amara and Dean swore he could see a spark of jealousy in his eyes. He would be lying if he said he didn’t’ like it. He smirked inside.
“I can’t just look at her, waiting for her to…go mad and die.” Castiel’s eyebrows were furrowed in frustration.
“Jack, I know you can hear me. I know what you’re doing up in Heaven. I…found Castiel’s letter. But I need you too. I need to see you. Please. Jack, please.” he had closed his eyes half-prayer. When he opened them, nothing had changed. He sighed. He was ready to leave and get back to Baby when he felt something. A presence.
“No! Jack don’t go now!” Dean cried back. He thought fast and blurted out “come tonight, we’ll eat pie with Sam and Eileen. Do it for me Jack. Please. Just tonight.”
“Cas…I don’t know if you can hear me…” Dean had said softly… almost whispering. Dean smiled, the ache in his chest turning into hot bliss, “I’m sorry I didn’t say it back.” He brushed off a tear out of his eye. “I was so stupid.” another tear rolled down his cheek “I didn’t know angels could love like that. I didn’t know
“I think you already find your purpose, Cas. And you’re here. You’re already helping.” Sam put his cup higher in the air. Castiel rolled his eyes.
“But…you won’t be. Old and wrinkly.” Dean said, with a faraway look in his eyes.
Dean sighed heavily and laid back on the headboard. He closed his eyes for a moment, his head was spinning. When he opened them again a few seconds after, Castiel was at his side, sitting in the armchair. He looked at Dean without saying anything, diving into his green eyes. And Dean thought it was more than a gaze. Like if Cas was seeing the real him for the first time, and him the real angel beneath the shades of blue. They stared at each other in silence for minutes it seemed. Devouring every detail of the other. Finally, Cas broke the silence.
“Is it really
He grabbed the plate and rested it on them, balancing him on their legs, he guided her hand towards the sandwiches and she grabbed one of them. He kissed her on the temple and turned towards Cas and Dean.
“Yeah? Good. ‘Cause it’s weird, painting you half-naked with lamb’s blood.” Sam laughed “Don’t laugh! I can’t mess up Dean!”
“Are her stiches okay? Do we need to change her dressings?”
“Dean!” Sam tried to put his brother back into his bed. “DEAN!” Sam’s voice resonated in the room. “Would you stop!” He pushed him back on the bed.
“So, Dean. Can you tell us what we’re here for?” She asked him. Dean looked at her, then Sam.
“Hmm…” she said pondering. “And where is this book, exactly?”
The angel met his eyes “I’m making you cry. I’m sorry.” he brushed off a tear rolling on Dean’s cheek.
“Yes. He wanted you to have it in Heaven, when you… well, when you would die.”
“Well…maybe we can ask Anja to send it?” Sam turned to Dean
“Dean! It’s not Rowena’s fault! Come on, we’ll find a way.” Sam shouted back.
He started praying, again.
“Is that so?” He looked at Cas “How come you didn’t tell me?”
When he got there, he found the furry animal balled up on his bed, peaceful. He thought he’ll wait for her to wake up. He didn’t want to perturb her rest. He sat carefully on the bed, resting his head on the wall behind him. He picked up the photograph that Claire had give him earlier during the week. He brushed it fondly, looking at
“Cas…” he pleaded against his lips, mouth open, tugging his fingers in the angel’s hair.
“Well, I need the blood of a woman too.”
He got up, putting the letter carefully in his back pocket. He headed for the kitchen, poured water into the tank and put the coffee machine on. He sat down at the table, rubbing his tired eyes. They were puffy again, from crying. He was so tired. Exhausted from the pain. The letter had hurt him just as much as it had soothed him. It was a piece of Cas he had not seen before but it was also a reminder that he was gone. He sighed and pawed his hand over his face, trying to rub the fatigue away.
Next chapter should come next saturday, I'm thinking of cutting the story in different parts. There should be around 10 or 11 chapters in the first part.
“Cas…your eyes.” Dean breathed, brushing his fingers on the angel’s stubble. “They’re glowing.”
“Dean?” Sam was standing in the doorframe, holding something in his hand. It must have been around 5 am and Dean still sat at the angel’s side. He didn’t answer but looked back at his brother. Sam came closer and sat in the chair next to Dean.
“I’m telling you I’m
“Dean?” Cas called
“It’s alright. It’s something to work on.” Dean answered, waving away her apologies.
His mind was confused, had it all been a dream? The last thing he remembered was holding Cas in his arms.
“It’s okay. I already cleaned them, earlier. Before…” Sam looked at Castiel.
“You won’t.” Dean put a hand on his brother. “Look…Cas tried to call Jack, he tried Heaven but…no one’s answering.”
“Would you stop?!” Dean yelled at him “No, you won’t!”
“Cas?” and Castiel looked at him “Would you…come closer? With me?” he moved back slightly on the bed, making room for the angel.
“Before her hallucinations.” Castiel finished the sentence. “It’s getting worse.” He looked at Dean “It’s the Miniwashitu’s curse, blinding and making his victims go mad after.”
“And the last one,
doing this by yourself.”
“Known what?” Dean asked between two kisses.
“If you stop hunting, I…I’m scared that you’ll drown yourself in whisky and despair Dean, I don’t want to see you like this” Sam continued, unbothered and determined to make his voice heard.
“Not now, Dean.” Castiel warned him. “She’s the priority. I put her in a deep sleep for now.”
“Oh, wow…” looking in awe at the bottle. “This tastes like the first drink I ever shared with my dad” he said, smiling a little.
Dean was dumbfounded and must have looked like a complete idiot, mouth opened, looking at everyone and no one in particular, scanning the faces around him. Back to Eileen.
“It’s okay, what brings you here? Do you have news for Cas?” he poured himself another cup and sat back down.
He barged into the infirmary, heart racing. Sam was arguing with Castiel and both of them had blood smeared over their clothes. Dean’s eyes frowned, trying to grasp what was happening.
. Not even one
was gone, and he absolutely couldn’t even allow himself to think about how he
“You don’t know?” Dean said shaking his head, “You don’t know, and you came anyway?” He added, truly flabbergasted.
“Dean. Even if I ‘look good’ I can’t have… intercourse with you! You’re not well enough! And with my grace, it’s dangerous!”
“Only…me?” Dean said in a hushed voice, starting to reach for the engraved case.
“Well, we don’t! You need to find another way!” Dean had started shouting, pounding on the table, making Sam startled. Dean was really on edge now, he had more and more trouble accepting the wait and the failures.
“Where is he? Where is he?!” Dean said urgently, starting to get up.
He was soon moaning as he came, pleasure coming in waves and cum sticking between them. Cas kissed his neck and mouth lovingly after, smiling. He didn’t even realize he was this close, Castiel really did a number on him.
“I’m going to bring him back.” He said, and realised maybe this wasn’t clear enough. He glanced at Sam who was staring at him, waiting. He cleared his throat, preparing himself. “I’m going to bring
Sam turned towards his brother, face all wet from crying “It’s Eileen, she didn’t hear it coming…” Sam stuttered “I-I-I wasn’t fast enough” He shook his head “I don’t get it, we did everything.” His hands were on his head, pressing on either side. “It should have been dead.”
“Cas…Just get some rest. And if you’re feeling better after, I’ll take you on a ride outside. It’s beautiful today.”
“To one hell of a hunt.” He said, clinking the bottles. Dean simply answered by nodding. Dean swallowed a large gulp of beer, and even for him, it was a long one.
Castiel. We need something of his angel self. His pure celestial form.” She explained to him.
It was one day before Dean’s birthday. He didn’t want to celebrate. What was there to celebrate? He laid in bed, motionless. He heard Miracle coming out of the room, surely running somewhere to find Sam and ask for her walk.
“I’m not going to die.” Cas reassured him. “I’m going to make you happy, every day, for as long as you’ll want me.”
“Cas…oh my god Cas…” he was not shutting up now. Cas looked at him amused.
. He kissed Dean’s side, making him inhale sharply.
And as he was looking at his computer, Dean felt something behind him…a presence.
“Well, damn the angels, we need you here, now!”
“I’ve got nothing, squat.” Dean sighed “What they did…it should have worked.”
“I love you too, Cas.” Dean voice was low. Cas felt a slight tremor in Dean’s chest, making him worried. He quickly sat up to look at Dean. He was crying.
There were sunsets in Heaven, he realised after driving for what seems like hours. Hours? Minutes? Time passed differently here. It was…fluid.
“You will. Maybe not now. But in time, you will.” She took a step back, still one hand on his shoulder. “You should talk to Sam about it, Dean. I think you’d be surprised by what you’ll find.”
“I…okay, I won’t.” Jack closed his eyes for a few seconds. “It’s done. I can’t read your mind anymore.”
“We can, and we will.” Sam looked at his brother, heartbroken. “This is what she wants.”
They were driving in the Impala, Castiel had felt better after just a few hours, the time for his grace to cicatrize his body slowly. The angel was in the passenger seat, looking outside, peaceful. Miracle was in the back seat, looking at the landscape go by. Dean was driving, rock was playing on the speakers. After a little than an hour’s drive Dean parked close to a lake. The sun still shone brightly in the sky; this golden glow you get only little of everyday if you’re lucky.
He put his headphones aside.
As the evening drew closer, someone thought of ordering pizza at the local Italian restaurant. Turns out it was Jules and Spencer. They had been working in a bedroom all day, crammed on a desk, books piling all around. They had thought that people deserved to get together to celebrate at the end of the day. And everyone agreed.
“Cas. We can’t leave her like that. She won’t survive it.”
He had not seen Bobby, sitting on a porch. Was it the Roadhouse? Bobby?! What memory was it? He couldn’t remember the place or time.
“I don’t think so…it’s too close to the description and Sam would not have missed it.” Cas sat next to him, “He’s too experienced a hunter.”
For a while, nothing happened.
“You don’t know that.”
“Dean!” Cas called but the hunter had made up his mind.
about it, about
“You smell like mint too. Why?”
“Yeah, I know.” Dean’s eyebrows raise. “So? No one can reach him.”
Jack had not answer any of their prayers yet and Dean was starting to get restless. The afternoon was well on its way and he was starting to wonder if Jack would come at all.
“I can’t… can’t do it anymore.” he whispered, slowly falling to his knees and onto the cold floor without even realising. Shaking. Tears rolling on his cheeks. A burning ache in his chest and throat. Sam said nothing and just stayed there, closing off the fridge door and holding his brother in his arms. Soothing him, taking a bit of his brother’s grief in his arms.
“Shh… Cas. Nothing will happen to me. And nothing will happen to Jack. He’s too strong.”
He exhaled and put his other hand pressed on hers, crying even more. He managed to trace something in her hand.
. Nothing to remember him by except his memories. Miracle was looking funnily at Dean, tilting her head. Dean almost laughed at the sight. He went to her, kneeling next to the bed and petting the dog on the head. He just needed to say it at loud.
“Okay. What do you want to talk about?” Dean came closer, serious.
As the day passed, Dean started wandering aimlessly around the bunker, tape recorder in his pocket. Sam and Eileen were out of the bunker it seemed. Eileen had left a sandwich in the fridge for Dean with a note on it.
Dean chuckled ‘Hello Dean’ would never get old. Not Castiel’s ‘hello Dean’. He had a way of saying it…like he was the most important person it would ever say hello to.
“It’s not translating!” he signed, looked at her and specified, talking and facing her so that she could read his lips “I keep trying, but it fails. Every damn time.” Eileen could see he was frustrated. She looked over to the screen, frowning. Sam twitched in his chair, looking at them.
“Where is he now?”
“Damn it, kid! A little warning maybe?” he said, trying uselessly to absorb the coffee with a towel.
“And we’ve been waiting for you.” Bobby said.
Dean was too reckless… this vampire had almost thrown him into an ass-long piece of rebar stuck in a wooden beam behind him. He realised right after that this giant nail could very well hold a vamp in place because it was as an angle… Only a second for this thought to cross his mind and he threw the vamp with all the strength he had into the metal bar, impaling him clean in the process.
“Jenny? Dude… I completely forgot about her.” Sam was amazed that Dean had remembered. He held his machete down, and the blood was slowly leaking onto the barn’s floor.
“This I know.”
“You don’t know how the laundry machine works” He chuckled. And Castiel rolled his eyes, making Dean smile. “I’m sorry. I know it’s not my decision.” He rubbed his eyes “It’s just..”
Eileen looked a bit longer and inhale suddenly, as if coming with a revelation. She tapped excitedly on Sam’s shoulder to get his attention and signed “It’s a code! It’s a code! I heard of witches enchanting books so that no one can read them but them.”
“We can what?” Dean really didn’t get the clue.
“It’s not your burden to bear alone Dean.” Castiel looked at him. “Sometimes you just have to let go.”
“Dean, are you alright? You seem…tense.”
! These are promising leads! We’ve got one especially
He composed himself, nodding. “Thanks for the help. We-I really need it.”
“Will it work?”
Dean was washing the dishes in the kitchen sink and was going to go back to Castiel when he noticed his computer still open on the table. Several tabs were open, Cas was not the best computer user in the world…he always left everything opened on display. He began to close the tabs one by one when he noticed something…a pattern in the last opened tabs.
Dean closed the gap between them. His lips were soft on the angel’s, he kissed him softly, tasting him. He grabbed his hair and held him even closer to him. Cas slightly opened his mouth, soft noises seeping out of him, touching delicately Dean’s tongue, revelling in his kiss. Cas ran a hand on Dean’s chest, moving towards his neck, caressing him. They were locked into each other’s embrace.
“Cas. Can you heal her?” He asked the angel.
Dean drank his coffee while walking towards the garage when he heard noise coming from the infirmary. Voices screaming. He ran towards it, leaving his mug somewhere on the way.
“Thank you, Jack.” He hugged his son tight before letting him go, disappearing to Heaven.
“Now boys, you let me get to work.” She said, opening the book and hovering her hands above the dusty parchment. Just as they were leaving, Rowena called back “Oh, and Samuel? Would you be so kind as to bring me a glass of whisky? I’m utterly parched.”
He whistled Miracle and headed back to the bunker when he realised he had been gone longer than expected, he was hoping the kitchen would still be in one piece.
“Tomorrow we go to war Miracle.” he said before falling asleep, weirdly peaceful for the first time in weeks.
Castiel closed the book in front of him. The amulet, the plants, the silver. Everything was right. What did they miss? He sighed. If only he could use his grace. He felt useless knowing he could help Eileen.
“Sammy…I’m sorry.”
“Of course, I am! It’s going to be a bitch not having you here, but this can’t go on like that!”
“Yes… I’m sorry I read it. It wasn’t meant for me.” Dean said apologetically.
‘Cause it’s the only way I could tell you.” He grinned at the angel.
“Because you’re cute.”
He opened it and read.
“Well, it’s not like I’m really going to stay dead… this-” he gestured at the blood mixture “this is going to prevent me from dying.”
Then after what seemed like an eternity, Dean felt something twitching in his hand. Castiel’s fingers, slightly moving. Lights flickered in the room. He could see Castiel’s eyes move under his eyelids.
“Eileen’s not well, she’s dying.” Castiel clarified. He looked at Dean, sighing. Being smooth was not his forte sometimes. Dean eyebrows raised as if he was innocent. “She’s in the infirmary.” The angel continued.
“So?” Eileen asked again, signing this time. Dean picked that up, he was not as good at Sam at signing but he was getting there. He looked at everyone, they must have been a dozen around him. A part of them strangers. And they were all here to help him. And didn’t even know why. People did care. More than he ever realised. And this time, Dean would accept help from the people around him. This time, he would accept to be cared for. Because
He brushed Cas’ skin with his thumb, caressing his hair with his other hand. It was an innocent touch but it felt like he couldn’t live without it. A tear rolled off his face. He was still worried about his angel, but at least he was here with him now. At least now he could watch over him. He would find a way to wake him. Maybe he needed more time.
Cas started getting the clothes off of Dean, he stripped his own clothes shoving them in a corner of the room. He grabbed Dean with ease and laid him on the bed with a thud, making him grunt.
Castiel stood up and followed Dean outside the infirmary. Dean was standing arms crossed on his chest, lips pinched.
“Hmm? What? Yes, I’m with you.” He blinked and tried to focus.
Cas appeared at the door, squinting his eyes at Dean, who was facing him, the computer closed behind him. “Are you alright?”
“It’s about Heaven, I’m rebuilding it with Amara, and I’ve created new angels with her help, but… none of them know how Heaven really works. And the few angels left are not inclined to help me… because I’m the son of Lucifer.”
Castiel turned to the fridge and got on with the making of Dean’s sandwiches. He left the kitchen with two sandwiches and two beers. He liked to drink casually with Dean, even if all he tasted were molecules. Maybe one day they would taste different.
When he arrived there, Sam and Bobby were comparing thoughts with dozens of hunters on videocall, exchanging hypotheses and ideas. They had managed to combine hundreds of books on lore from all around the world. At least a quarter of them came from Garth’s contact, Anja from Germany. She had really come forward with the ancient texts and even began to translate some chapters. Dean sat down at the table, sipping his coffee and reviewed one of her books on Eileen’s computer, she was next to him, scanning some other pages with her phone. She smiled at him and resumed her work. The two of them realised they were quite the research team during the week and Dean got to train more at signing, communicating more easily with her. Sam was thrilled to see his brother getting along so well with her. And as organised as he was, even Sam had to recognise that since Dean imposed Donna and Jody’s colour code to everyone, the research had been more productive.
“What? Call who?”
Claire picked up a book that was set on the very top of the pile. It was a dark brown leather book with ancient symbols and sigils inscribed on the cover.
“What? Yes! I’m Alright, I’m perfect! Why wouldn’t I be?” Dean couldn’t stop talking and Castiel’s kept squinting his eyes at him. He knew him too well.
“I want to go out in the sun with you.”
He thought about the letter, still in his pocket.
“I do. Eileen will be here too. You can buy you pie or somethi-“
“Dean?” Cas looked at him for a moment, his eyes wide and confused. “Is that really you?” and Dean could see he was scared.
“Why are you asking me that Cas? Are you afraid about the Empty finding you?” Jack asked, worried.
And the rest, he would figure it out later. He whistled at Miracle and together they walked back to the bunker, as if marching into battle.
“You’re alright Dean?”
, you need to talk to me.” he said, slowly getting up and resting his hand on his brother’s shoulder. Dean was silent and felt the warmth of his brother holding him.
Dean was fighting those vampires with everything he had, Sam was doing just the same, but the vamps were more than they had anticipated. Nevertheless, they were determined to kill those sons of bitches,
“Well, I did live in an apocalypse world so… I know a thing or two about tough times.” She laughed. “What is it really about? Something happened?” Charlie asked, serious again. She could see he was on the verge of collapsing underneath his pain, anyone with two functioning eyes could have seen it. “Is it about Cas?”
“I see you have found my lake” Cas said.
“Come on, get your legs up” Sam said to Dean as he eased him on the bed. Dean laid himself on the bed with a wince.
“I love you. Ever since I touched your soul. Ever since I saw the real you, hidden underneath.” He touched Dean’s chest, laying his hand on him, causing the human to inhale, surprised at the gentle touch. “I never stopped. At first, I was confused. An angel is not supposed to feel this way.” He smiled and shook his head. “But I did. I felt… for you.” his eyes were blissful. “When I realised it was love I felt…nothing could have changed, I was done for.” He gazed at Dean’s eyes, soft and loving “I was yours, then and forever.” He had said the last words in a hushed voice. Almost like a secret, between the two of them.
“Hello Dean.” He simply said.
______________________________
“I’ll be alright in a few hours.” Castiel murmured back. “I just need to adjust.” He winced again. “I’ll never get used to this pain…”
Dean looked at Jack without knowing what to say. He did hear weirder things in his life and he knew Chuck had absorbed Amara before being devoid of his powers, he just thought she was stowed away, trapped inside. But Jack was not Chuck. Of course, Jack had reached out to her, of course she was her friend now. Because Jack was just good like that.
“Your eyes are beautiful too.” Dean said and Cas chuckle repercussed in his body. “Do you want to stay a bit longer? Or should we…get back?” Dean wasn’t sure how to say what he wanted to say, but Cas seemed to understand anyway.
“Yeah, don’t worry about me Dean. Go make me some coffee.”
“You are very tender with me Dean.” Cas smiled softly “What did I do to deserve you?” And Dean was shocked to think he didn’t think he deserved him. Maybe seeing Amara had tripped something within Castiel he didn’t know existed before.
He stayed like this for what seemed like hours.
Dean went to bed, waiting. Cas sat close to him in the armchair.
“Hey man! Good to see you!” Dean couldn’t stop himself from smiling at his friend.
He looked up at some point to rest his eyes and marvelled at the sight of Charlie and Stevie, sitting side by side. You could see their love, clear as day. Even if they were not looking at each other or touching. It was just…there. Radiating. He wondered then, had anyone seen Castiel’s love? Why didn’t he see it sooner? And did he feel the same for the angel? He cared deeply… but did he
“That’s…” Dean tried to say the words. But couldn’t. He wanted to tell Sam that those were the last words
As Samuel was talking to Anja on the phone somewhere in the bunker, Dean walked around Claire and Kaia who were, it seemed, quite impressed with the Queen of Hell. He posted himself in front of her, arms crossed on his chest. He looked back at the girls “Could you give us a moment, please?” he asked softly. They nodded and got out of the room, bringing their respective cups of coffee with them.
Their peace is interrupted by a horrible accident, Castiel and Dean can’t seem to see eye to eye on what to do about it. In a last-ditch attempt, they try desperately to find Jack who’s unreachable again.
Cas fell silent, looking at Dean with the bluest eyes, patiently. And Dean continued:
“Yeah? Well, that’s more motivation on my part then.”
The sun was shining high in the sky and there were few clouds, it was a beautiful day. Dean wore his coat to protect him from the cold, Miracle was by his side, jumping in the mud. He sighed at the sight, he’d have to wash her, again. Maybe he should consider going to one of those dog groomers, her hair was getting out of control and he was a poor groomer. The thought alone made him chuckle, Dean Winchester bringing his dog to a groomer…what had happened to Dean Winchester the monster hunter? His life had changed since he stopped hunting, but even more so since Castiel came back from the Empty. Since then, his life had been almost…normal. Dean Winchester the normal guy. It sounded weirdly good.
Eileen was asleep and peaceful for now. Sam had not sleep in two days and was dozing off slowly in his chair. His eyes jerked open suddenly, he rubbed his eyes, yawning.
“Then I’ll get the warding.” Cas smiled, very proud of himself and reassured. “I love seeing you like this.” he whispered, leaving kisses on Dean’s neck “So vulnerable. So beautiful.” He let go of him, he was starting to feel his grace growing ever stronger within him.
“Well…It’s this really old book you’ve send us. We…can’t translate it. It like it’s written in code or something.”
“And you are my son.” Castiel smiled “You know that.” Castiel came closer, “But you’re also Dean’s and Sam’s, they’re your family. And mine.”
“No. I want to do it. If I need to get back in there to bring Cas back…that’s what I’ll do.” Dean took a step closer to Sam, putting his hand on the doorknob. “Plus…it would be good to see Rowena again.” And opened the door.
Eileen who stopped feeling Sam’s fingers tracing in her hands, pulled on his arm. She turned his palm and began tracing inside.
“Dean…are you aroused?” Cas asked looking down at Dean, making his face turn red.
He mixed the ingredients and worked the pastry on the table. He smiled at the dough; it was pretty close to the one on the computer. He filmed it and put it to rest in the fridge.
Miracle barked at his feet, turning around herself, trying to catch her tail. She looked happy too, as if she knew something had shifted in him.
. Dean stayed like that, motionless, sitting in the Impala. He slowly got up and out of the car, intending to go get that beer after all. He was not sure about the celebrating yet.
“Let me do something for you. Something good.” He said in a gravely voice.
“Well, then we can have intercourse.” Cas blurted out, taking Dean by surprise.
“Well, Amara told me that since Castiel is here on Earth, inside a vessel… we could ‘ward’ his vessel.”
“Maybe it reminds him of happy memories.” Jack sighed. “I can’t do anything more. I’ll check on him later. I need to get back to Heaven now. Pray to me if he wakes up.”
“Cas…I’m cl-close.” He managed to breathe, panting. He groaned as Castiel went faster in him, squeezing his cock, he was so close too. The lights started to flicker around the room. He managed to hold it for a few more thrusts and then came hard and strong, mouth open, unable to emit any sound. His heart was pounding in his head, his body jerked with pleasure. Cas came in him right after, emitting a long moan of pleasure, his head rested on Dean’s chest. This time the lights didn’t explode in the room.
Dean stayed longer in the car, hands on the wheel, just looking in front of him and at nothing in particular. Yes, it had been his final hunt. He had done everything he could, he had kept fighting. For how long? He didn’t even know when it started exactly. Maybe after the fire when he was just a boy, maybe later… but he felt like he had only known hunting all his life. It was time for
“Cas!”
“Will you have me now, Cas?” He asked.
“I already told him. He knows.”
Dean was pacing around the library, waiting on Jack. Sam and Rowena were getting ready on their part, gathered around the table. Dean kept looking at the feather, still in its wooden carved box, laid on a side table. He needed to make sure it was not going to suddenly disappear on him. Eileen was picking up the last plants needed to perform the spell.
“Mortal? Cut out your grace?”
“All of you.” Dean paused, gazing into his eyes “So get this warding, so I can show just how much I love you.” Dean’s lips trembled slightly “Cause I’m starting to think, I won’t be able to wait much longer.” His hand was on the back of Cas’ neck, caressing his hair softly. He could feel the angel’s breath on his skin and the scent of mint and honey, mesmerizingly intoxicating.
Dean woke up the next morning with the will to get up, it had not happened since… well since a long time. He got up, put on sweatpants that were laying around and headed to the kitchen. He was sure to find Sam there, coming from a run and fixing breakfast.
“What source does it come from?” Sam asked, putting an end on the silence that had begun to set between the trio, and shaking Dean out of his thoughts.
“You’ve got a score of hunters searching for a way to break into the Empty for an angel who happened to be someone you consider like family, but you’re good.”
“The Empty!” She had repeated, her Scottish accent thick with surprise.
He was so close to the rift, and the closer he got to it, the more power he gained back. He pulled on Castiel’s trench coat and slid them off into the rift, leaving blackness behind them. He faintly heard Rowena recite another chant, closing the rift behind him.
“The native amulet should have worked then.”
“Hmm?” Dean’s face was looking back at the angel and he had not seen him move his hand. “Cas…” he gasped when he felt the angel’s fingers gently stroking him.
“I can do it by myself, or Claire and Kaia can help me, they’re in there.” Sam added in seriousness.
He had left the library punching a wall on his way, splitting his knuckles, leaving blood behind him. Sam was left to deal with Rowena alone. The little brother picked up the list and read it once again, the last ingredients burned on his retinas.
“Well, we don’t either. But we need you to unlock a spell book. A very old one.”
“What is it?”
“Cas…” Dean said after taking a breath. He looked into the angel’s eyes. So blue. So beautiful. He brushed his cheek, fingers rubbing on his stubble. “I love you too.” He kissed him again, fiercely. Nothing in the world would have been able to stop the hunter. He was lost in the angel’s touch. His exhaustion flying away. The burning ache in his chest replaced by bliss and desire. He breathed and kissed him again, unable to stop. Cas kissed him back, more confident than before, gently pulling Dean’s hair in the process, savouring the taste of his lips and tongue. He pushed Dean back into the bed forcefully, lost in his passion, making him wince. He stopped at once, wide-eyed.
Dean gazed into his eyes “I’m yours, and you’re mine.” he laid his head back, breathing. Castiel closed his eyes for a second and they were all cleaned up. He snuggled close to Dean, resting his head on him, listening to his heartbeat, his leg placed on Dean’s. The human’s heat radiated under his fingers. So… tangible.
He had almost reached the angel when something made him trip. A hand made of black goo grabbing his foot. His eyes glowed golden and the hand disappeared, causing the ground to tremble. He got himself back up and running. He heard a voice, screaming.
“Yes that’s the point. Could you do it?”
Dean stopped and turned around, squinting.
Castiel was reading a book in his room when Jack appeared at the door. He had sensed his presence earlier in the bunker.
Eileen kept eating her sandwich, Sam holding her close. He looked at her, eyes filled with worry.
Dean let go of Cas’s hand in order to remove the headphones to make the angle more comfortable. He rested them on the nightstand, next to Cas’s trench coat.
“Anyway, I don’t know how long we’ll be gone. I’ll call to check up on you.” Sam turned towards Castiel in another chair “On both of you.”
“Dean! I’m sorry!” Cas said, frantic “I hurt you!”
“Well, there must be an explanation. Don’t worry.” But Dean’s voice was filled with worry too. Cas saw it in his eyes. “C’mon, let’s bring those sandwiches downstairs, you need a break too.”
“I told her to except you. Please don’t scare her.” He warned Rowena.
“I want to. I want you.” He answered “but I want it to be perfect. And you’re still fragile, Dean.” Dean kissed him again, making him moan.
He sat at the desk. Gliding his hands on the wood. He opened the drawer and looked around, to see if something could bring
He glanced at Dean sometimes, when they were sorting through dried leaves and flowers, without him knowing. He picked up on every detail, his freckles, his laughing lines sliding around his eyes, his lips slightly parted when he was concentrating, the green pools in his eyes.
“Cas! No, you didn’t!” Dean smiled, sitting back up “I’m just…completely beat.” he reassured the angel “You’re tougher than I am, that’s all.” And though he had winced he had also quite enjoyed it, more than he cared to admit at the moment.

Even if it’s the hardest thing to do.
“You’re gonna get your clothes all dirty.”
“If you like the smell of mint, my grace can…replicate the smells you like most.” Cas blushed.
to rest.”
back.
“And we will be. But in the meantime, I want to enjoy my life on Earth.” Castiel rested his hand on Jack’s shoulder “So, will you do it?”
As the new moon approaches, the boys and Eileen get all the ingredients ready to perform the spell with Rowena. If everything goes according to plan, Jack will enter the Empty and bring back Castiel with him, safe and sound in the bunker.
“I know but still, I’m sorry.”
“Here.” Dean handed it to him, opening a jar of holy oil, their last one.
“What? Is it not the term? Are you not aroused?” He was confused “Did I hurt you then?”
, I want to
“Would you like to do it again sometimes?”
“I meant support, Cas.” Sam smiled.
“Easy…Dean you should rest. You died!” Sam pleaded.
“It’s no trouble. Anything for you, man. Listen, I’ve got to go take care of the boys, but I’ll keep y’all in the loop.” You could hear children crying in the background.
“Heya, Dean!” Donna smiled “We’ve got some good leads for ‘ya” she gestured at the ‘most promising’ pile on her left.
“You’re picking up Eileen today, that’s your week off. Use it. And if I find nothing after, then I’ll let you help.” Dean answered and quickly added “That’s not negotiable.” Sam looked a bit pissed but said nothing more to bother or anger Dean.
lake, from
“Do I have to do something…?” Cas tried to ask in a raspy voice.
Sam chuckled, turning her hand over to answer.
“As ye wish, Samuel.” She said rolling her eyes and sitting more comfortably in her velvety throne.
Jack closed his eyes. When he opened them, they were completely jet black.
“I… I will leave you.” Jack started to get up but Dean stopped him with his hand.
“Thanks, good luck to you too, bye!” Sam ended the call. He explained the situation to Eileen quickly and looked at his brother who seemed pensive.
“It’s okay…It’s gonna be alright…” he said to her, close enough that she could feel his breath on her and his throat vibrating close to her. She held him tight, grabbing at his shirt, trying to find balance. He would have given everything to be in the bed instead of her. She was shaking. He moved her to the side of the bed and got on the bed next to her, holding her close, brushing her hair softly. Talking close to her soothingly. He needed to make her feel loved, not alone. He brushed off her tears slowly, rocking her until she calmed down in his arms. He looked up at the ceiling praying to Jack in silence.
“I don’t want to celebrate Sam.”
“Alright then. Samuel?” Rowena’s arm reached for Sam’s and they linked hands together. Sam looked at Dean, nodding. And in this nod, there was all the love he felt for his brother, Dean knew it and felt it too. He looked up at Rowena and started chanting in Latin. As the chant continued, everything dulled around Dean, the sounds were stuffed, his vision blackened, and suddenly, nothing.
“No, Sammy, I’m sure. I’m done. Stop worrying.” Dean answered, sitting down and sipping his beer.
Cas paused to think, looking up for a moment, pondering.
“Yes…at first, she was pretty silent but she’s more vocal now, it’s like she’s always here with me.” Jack smiled. “She reminds me of my mother sometimes, she’s very…caring in her own way.”
“I’ll help you, come on.” Sam said when he came back, grabbing his brother and putting one of his arms around his shoulders to hold him steady while they headed to Castiel’s room. Dean said nothing and greeted his teeth. His body was aching all over from stress and exhaustion. He steadied himself on his brother. When they arrived to Cas’ room, the angel was waiting in the armchair, looking at Jack’s souvenir box. He rapidly put it back in the drawer when he saw the brothers in the doorframe.
A knock on the door shook him out of his thoughts.
He looked around, watching the water lapping on the lake edge, the wind rustling around in the trees. He even noticed bald eagles nesting up in them. Miracle’s head was resting on his lap.
“You’re not Dean. Dean is on Earth. You’re the Empty. You’re using me.” He answered confused, closing his eyes and putting his hands on his ears, mumbling to himself. No…not mumbling…singing.
Cas opened his eyes, and Dean swore he seemed…saddened?
“Because I’m here, I’m blocking you, see?” Cas tried explaining but Dean didn’t understand. He wasn’t really trying, truth be told, he loved to see Cas’ brows frowned in reflexion, tilting his head, counting the possibilities in his mind. He lost every game but didn’t care. Castiel didn’t want to upset Dean physically so he restrained himself from kissing him more, for he knew if he did, he wouldn’t be able to stop.
“She’s a distant cousin of Bess, the name’s Anja, she’s in Germany.”
“Thank you” she mouthed.
He loved the song. He had put it on the mix tape for Cas many years ago. He knew the angel had listened to it. Even if neither of them acknowledged it. He never made tapes, for anyone. But he had wanted to share something more than hunting with Cas, he wanted to say more to him. But he was too insecure to talk about his feelings. About love. So, he had made him a mixtape as a coping mechanism.
won’t survive it.”
“I know, he told me.”
“Well, it’s not
“I flew them here.” Cas answered. “Sam prayed to me.”
“Maybe? Maybe?!” Dean shook his head “Maybe’s not good enough for me, Cas.”
“Look at me.” he simply said, in a hoarse voice. And Cas turned his head, eyes gleaming with tears. He held onto Dean’s hand. “I’m sorry Cas.” he whispered, barely brushing his face. Dean wanted to touch him more but he was still afraid of contact, of doing the wrong thing. Cas was not used to this, he knew that. He was not used to it either to tell the truth. Dean had never been violent in intimacy but he never had to be this gentle either. He wanted the angel to feel loved.
“And then he, well he… set some things right.” Bobby said, looking at Dean. “Tore down all the walls up here…”.
“No…It would require too much of my grace.” Castiel looked away.
for the first time.
“Dean, are you okay? You seem… a little out of it.” Sam said, looking worried. “Talk to me.”
“I’m ready.”
Castiel nodded his head, sighing. “Good.”
Castiel kissed him, grabbing his hair and continuing grazing his burning skin underneath his shirt.
After finally confessing their love to each other, Dean and Castiel are closer than ever. That doesn’t mean Dean is completely sure about what he’s doing with the angel about these feelings. As he takes time to think about what it could really mean for his life and his future, Castiel tries to conduct his life in the bunker as human as possible, without the help of his grace.
“Well, what good is the spell if we can’t perform it?” He had almost yelled. “We’ve got nothing of him! Nothing!”
“Sam! wait where are you goi-“ Dean stopped himself, frozen in the hallway. Sam looked at him, confused. Sam stood in front of the dungeon’s door. Sam followed his brother’s gaze, looking at the door which still held the marks of Billie’s scythe on it.
“Aye, I know ye do.” Her eyes were fixed on Dean again, and he darted his away. “I know how much he means to ye.” She glanced back at Sam “I don’t know how to break into the Empty, Samuel.”
Dean pushed him on the bed, carefully placing himself on top of him, their skin grazing against each other. He paused to look at him, silent. He grazed his eyebrows and kissed Cas slowly, a hand on his member, circling the tip, making him moan even louder than before.
And as he was driving, his thoughts started to settle. Now he could go see his parents. He could see his mom again, he would have to explain about Jack of course, that he forgave him and that she should too. But he thought that she already did. Jack surely had gone and see Mary personally to ask for her forgiveness. She wasn’t like him that way, she was more understanding. He’ll also have to explain why he was here, so soon. Maybe his parents would be sad for a moment, but he could wait with them, for Sam. When the time would come.
“Thanks, Dean.” Jack tilted his head “But I don’t feel like I’m…sacrificing. I have been working in Heaven, keeping busy.”
“I could use my gra-“ Castiel tried to offer but got cut by Dean.
As Dean read, he seemed to get more and more confused, he frowned and kept on hitting different keys on the computer, mumbling and swearing.
“What happened Jack?” Castiel asked.
“Amara can do it, yes. But…Castiel wouldn’t be able to use his grace fully yet. Maybe with both warding in a room
“Sure Rowena.” Sam smiled and went out of the room with his brother.
“So…you smell like mint because I love the smell? You did that involuntarily?”
Dean inhaled and shook his head, arms crossed on his chest. He didn’t want to say anything but this was proof that Cas as an angel was invaluable. As a human, he could never had done it. The angel looked at Dean, understanding what he was thinking about.
Castiel looked at Dean, beautifully surprised. He never expected him to expose his feelings, his wants. Yet, he was doing just this. He was opening up to him.
Dean opened his eyes, looking at the angel. He exhaled and got up, passing some sweatpants on but leaving his chest bare. He started salivating at the sight of the sandwiches. He took a bite out of it, reveling in it. Castiel watched him, marveling at him. He always seemed so happy when he was eating. This was something he couldn’t share with him, yet. Dean felt the angel’s stare on him.
. And when he looked at him it was painfully obvious that he was looking at his future.
“Yeah, but you did, stupid.” Sam continued “He did first, then you. But you were both too stubborn to accept it, and you… Dean you refuse love when it comes to you.”
“In the guest room. The warding is holding. He’s safe.”
“I…brought you this.” he handed the record player to Dean “I don’t know where you put your headphones, but I can get them if you want me to.”
“Cas?” he said when they were playing poker, Dean clearly winning.
“What is this?” Dean had asked, looking at the ever-growing ingredients listed by Rowena “A pure essence of self” He asked, confused “What the hell does that even mean?”
“And for hexes…this could be dark magic for all we know” Dean added.
“Yeah. Do it.” Dean took a deep breath and focused his eyes on the light above him.
They were heading back to clean up the room where they had performed the spell when Castiel interjected Jack.
“Hello boys. Always a pleasure to see you. Especially you Samuel.” She smiled and winked at him. “What may I assist you with today? Be sure to make it quick, I’m quite busy at the moment.”
The day passed quite fast, with the reading and the variant exchanges between the different groups, sharing their findings, studying the possibilities. And with every page turned in the bunker, Dean felt a bit closer to
“No. No one does. I think it’s heavily encoded in magic.” Anja continued “I send it because it’s so old…there must be something about celestial entities inside. And witches are well-known for breaking the rules.”
“Dean?”
could love like that.” Dean exhaled. “I wish you were awake so I could tell you.” He continued “Please Cas. Please. You have to wake up.” he paused and whispered “Please come back to me. Come back to me”.
“I’m always hungry.”
“And what do you think?” Castiel cared very deeply about what Jack’s opinion.
“I know.” Cas answered, smiling down at the human. “I’m sorry too.” a tear rolled off his face, caught by Dean’s fingers.
“With Sam? I don’t talk about stuff like that with him.” he said, wiping his face with a hand.
“Jack!” Castiel stepped closer to the Nephilim, squeezing him. “You’re alright.”
“I promised you an outing anyway.” Dean closed his eyes, still recovering from Cas’ fierce kissing session. They were holding onto each other, unable to part. “I think you should call Jack now.”
.”, accentuating on the last word.
Now it was Cas’ turn to be dumbstruck. He didn’t think Dean would come around to it. But he had. And he was…
“I don’t rememb-“
“He told me you should open it alone, by yourself.” Jack specified. “I’ll go now.”
Dean uttered between gritted teeth, holding the fridge door tightly, turning his knuckles white.
Castiel’s eyes widened, turning towards Dean grabbing his arm “Dean! Of course!”
“No. You’re not using your grace.” Dean looked at him serious. “I got this.” He left the room and Castiel could hear him calling the dog.
be here? But he let none of his thoughts transpire, as usual. He stayed still on his chair while Bobby handed him a beer out of a cooler. He took it, reflexively. Without thinking, he didn’t know what to think. He needed to know more.
Eileen eyes’ started watering, she still shook her head.
“Dean, before anything…I want to do something.”
“Do you know someone who can translate it?” He signed back. But she didn’t.
“I can’t Sam! All I can do is stop it from getting worse!” Dean’s heart spiked as Castiel’s voice answered back.
As he threw a stick far away for Miracle to run to, he thought about Cas back at the bunker. He had discovered this cooking channel and wanted to make him a homemade apple pie. Since it was his first time cooking, Dean was kind of worried but Castiel has assured him it would be alright. Dean sat on a rock by the path, peacefully watching Miracle run around in the mud. She was going to be a nightmare to clean.
The next day, Dean wandered after his morning coffee, saying hi to everyone. People were having breakfast everywhere in the bunker, some in the kitchen, others in the library, some even in the archive room, but Dean avoided this room. He couldn’t go back there after Cas. If he were to set a foot in there, if he were to see the dungeon… he would see
Dean grabbed a second coffee maker out of a cupboard. He rested it on the kitchen counter with a grunt. It was an oldie, this coffee maker, bit dusty too. But it worked. He started cleaning it while Charlie prepared the first pot on the other machine.
“Dean, are you sure you’re okay with it?”
They needed to draw sigils and symbols to secure the zone. In case the Empty followed Jack back. As Dean was drawing sigils on the walls, Eileen was drawing intricate ones around the table. Soon, more than a dozen symbols painted out of lamb’s blood covered the space around the table.
Dean didn’t even want to get up today. He didn’t even care. He could die. He had no will to get up. He wasn’t hungry. He had no needs. Only one. Only seeing him again. He thought he could hold on better than that, but the first momentum he had gain during the week of research was long gone. Sam was getting very worried for his brother and spend his days with Eileen, looking for other ways.
“Dean…Dean wait.” Cas whimpered. Dean looked up, eyes filled with lust and lips swollen.
“You found Castiel’s letter.” He cut him.
“I sorry I was a jerk to you sometimes.” Dean inhaled “I loved you, and all my li-life, I believed it wa-was wrong…”
“Thanks Sammy.” He clasped his brother arm and let him go. Sam nodded, saying something to Castiel before leaving the room. The angel glanced at Dean before answering Sam, concern in his eyes.
can’t come close, it’s impossible, you can’t do it, Dean.” Sam shook his head, at loss for more words.
Dean washed off the blood on his hands in a basin. Eileen did the same right after, as she was wiping her hands, Dean got startled.
“It’s done.” Amara looked at them “You should be able to fly and use your grace outside but only in very, very small amounts. Otherwise, you could use it here quite safely, it’s nicely warded.” She looked around the room. “Still, you should be careful.”
“Yes. I made it from memory.” He replied and sat on the bench next to him, glancing at Dean.
Dean went out of the Bunker to walk Miracle. Both because she needed a walk and just to get out of the bunker. It was a sunny day but it was still chilly outside, so he had put on a light coat. He walked for twenty minutes, throwing sticks for Miracle to pick up. When he came back to the bunker, he had mud all over his boots. He entered by the garage as to not get dirt everywhere and removed them. He went to his room to hung his coat, grabbed a coffee and headed for the war room where Sam, Bobby and Eileen were.
“I don’t know… I never found a witch powerful enough to break the encoding spell, no one in my family ever did. But nothing happened to us either. It might not be dark magic at all.”
“I want to make you feel good too.”
“I’ve brought you this. Don’t be mad… I take these quite often when people aren’t looking.” she handed him a photograph. He took it and was stunned to see him, looking down at his phone and Cas, looking fondly at him.
Sam was softly crying, trying to brush his tears away. Eileen moved her hand in his direction, fumbling around. He bit his lip, catching her hand. She reached her other hand close to his face, brushing the tears off his face, smiling. “Sam, don’t worry.”
“It’s a very old and powerful spell book, It’s the oldest in my collection” she explained, “It’s been in my family for generations, and even though we tried, we never managed to translate it.”
“I always want to kiss you. Your lips are very soft. And when I kiss you…”
“We wasted so much time, Cas, so much.” he hiccupped “I should ha-have told you sooner.” He exhaled sharply.
Sam? But he was gone at a 9-hours-drive at least, he didn’t tell Dean he was coming back so soon.
He let his hands slide slowly off the wheel and rested them on his lap. He had one last hunt to finish really. Not a monster hunt. A hunt that would hurt like hell, that would be long and tenuous, whisky-filled all-nighters and sleepless nights. But he already got the last part covered anyway. He knew he should stop drinking himself to sleep, talk about it. But he couldn’t. He couldn’t talk about
“Sometimes? Yes...every time.” Dean chuckled “Next time…it’s your turn.” He sighed “I never thought I would be the one to…” He took a breath “You’re amazing.” He snuggled closer to the angel. “Castiel.” He whispered, like a holy word.
Dean looked at him intensely, as if awake for the first time in years.
“What do you need Jack?”
If he couldn’t reach Jack in the next few days, he would have to use his grace to heal Eileen. She had started having hallucinations and soon she would lose her mind completely, and potentially die. He couldn’t let this happen. This would put him in danger but he couldn’t stand by knowing he could save her. His eyes studied every detail on Dean. His freckles, soft on his skin, he liked to kiss them so much when they were in bed together. Dean had been so tired these past few days and their sexual drive had been seriously lowered in their worry for Eileen, Sam and Jack. Plus, they didn’t really spend time in bed since Dean wasn’t really sleeping. Still, Castiel appreciated the few hours Dean fell asleep accidently. He looked peaceful during those moments. At times his eyes frowned funnily, as if he was fighting an imaginary enemy. He wondered how it felt like to sleep and dream like that. What would he dream about? If he were human?
“Dean?” Cas stopped their kissing, breathing hard. “I sense strong…feelings emanating from you. It’s hard to ignore.”
Dean closed the tabs rapidly “Erm…yes give me a minute!” He fumbled on the computer, snapping it shut a bit too violently.
Dean finally went to shower. He had not realised he was this tired. He decided he was going to make a plan tomorrow. But first, he needed sleep, if he could get any. He went back to bed, Miracle sleeping at his feet. The lights in the corridor turned off by Sam, surely, who came to check on his brother before turning in. He thought he was discreet but Dean knew about his night rounds.
“Do you want to kiss me?” Cas asked, out of the blue.
We? Who’s we? Dean’s mind raced,
“No Bobby, don’t worry. Go get some rest.” Dean answered and Sam nodded in agreement.
Dean chuckled at the joke. “Well, you
“Sure”
“No, you don’t understand, I can’t reach Heaven, at all.” Castiel said concern in his voice “It’s like I’m…alone.”
“Do you need help?” Castiel asked, concerned. Jack glanced at Dean then back at Castiel.
“But Jack… I can’t leave.” Castiel answered with sad eyes. “I want to help you, but I can’t leave Dean.” He fumbled with his hands “I can’t leave him alone. He’s not going to survive it, not again.”
But Dean suddenly thought about Sam. Who was alone on Earth. Was there Eileen with him?
“About you and Dean?” Jack said tilting his head. “I don’t think I want to know the details of-“
“When I’m done with the incantation, only then, you pour the oil in the mixture.” Castiel eyes were very serious.
“Nine hours?” Dean was shocked, he usually slept four of five hours, on good nights. “I didn’t have you close to me, before.” he continued, making Cas smile even more. God, he loved his smile. His lips. “Did you…wait well?” What else could he asked… the situation was so right but also very new and awkward.
Dean closed the gap between them, resuming his strokes on Cas, a tear falling involuntarily from his eyes. The way Cas made him feel… it was just so good. He led the angel to the bed, Cas kissed him on the neck, softly sucking. Pulling Dean’s lower waist closer.
Dean shook his head, coming closer to the angel, pouring himself a cup of coffee. He leaned over to kiss him, the hot beverage in his hands. His lips were soft and warm. “Thanks.”
“It’s alright. Keep reading, I’ll go help Sam with his spell.” Claire said, moving towards the devil’s trap and Sam’s spell preparation. Kaia showed another Hebrew-translated chapter to Dean.
Sam had come up too late, shooting at the beast, shouting her name hopelessly.
“It’s perfect Samuel. I do think we are ready for the big part.” She raised her eyebrows and smiled, as much as the spell terrified Sam it made her quite joyful. She did love the thrill of a dangerous spell. “Are we having fun, yet?” She chuckled at Dean.
“When I kiss you, I feel very…human.” He finally said. “In a good way. I feel pleasure coursing through me.” He glanced at Dean who was devouring him with his eyes. “Do you…feel the same?”
“Are you?” Jack was hopeful.
“DO SOMETHING!”
“Dean? Can I ask you a question?” She chanced while putting the ground coffee in the filter.
“Jack…thanks.” He started opening the box
“He’s probably very busy. He’ll come.” Castiel had tried to explain.
“Dean…what I said before the Empty took me.” Cas inhaled, even though he didn’t need to. “I meant every word. Every last one of them.”
Second chapter in the "Have you ever seen the rain?" series
“Dean…” Cas said softly, laying a hand on Dean’s, trying to soothe him. And Dean gripped it tight. He kept on talking. He couldn’t stop now. He didn’t want to stop.
“Dean? Are you alright?”
Four since Sam had found out that Dean could very well be the key to break the angel free in one of Donna and Jody’s.
“Sure thing ma’m” He chuckled at the order and followed Charlie to the kitchen.
“It ain’t you idjit” Bobby said, laughing.
“Well, yes Dean. I could always see it. He could see it too, I think. It’s ye, who were harder to convince. As evident as it was.”
“Dean… always soft and innocent when it comes to feelings. Never truly seeing them.” She smiled “I think ye know why I looked at ye.”
“Oh.”
The morning passed as people read books of all forms and horizons. Books on celestial entities. Books about death. Books on witchcraft. Books on anything. Piles were forming. Unfortunately, it seemed the “most promising” piles were not as high as the “least promising” piles. Dean took a break to walk around, get some blood moving in his legs. Sam and Bobby were talking with hunters and contacts from everywhere. Dean passed them by and stopped to see who they were talking to. He smiled when he saw Garth’s face on the screen.
