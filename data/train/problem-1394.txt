Molly, putting one gloved hand up to cover her mouth in horror, steps back from the grate. Sherlock doesn’t blame her.
At any other time, John might have found it strange—this softness in Sherlock, this longing for touch, but somehow, in this moment, it felt perfectly natural, and it corresponded with a similar need that had surfaced in John.
“Oh god!” He gasped and fought to keep his eyes open. “That is… I think we should…”
“You did make me feel better. I felt like… what you said,” Sherlock drops his eyes, his self-consciousness returning as he attempts to say the words. “
“This? Two petty criminals making fools of themselves? No, this has nothing to do with me. It’s so easy to predict where the two of you will be—playing heroes on the party boat. I’m just here for the show.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But even the sight of all those faces watching him doesn’t bother Sherlock now. He’s too deep in the music; he’s no longer sitting on the deck, instead he’s floating somewhere above himself while his fingers fly over the strings, barely noticing the sweat creeping into his eyes, the sting of the sun as it burns his cheeks.
John cries out sharply, fingers tightening in Sherlock’s curls.
The light beats rapidly in and out, makes patterns
The other sailors are slapping each other on the back, telling stories, swapping jokes. There is a sense of comradeship between them that is evident even from where Sherlock is standing. They clearly talk to each other, relate to each other; enjoy one another’s company.
The rolling motion of the boat makes his head swim and he clenches his eyes shut against the motion, feeling desperately ill, dizzy, feverish. He feels as sick as he did when the ship first left port but sicker. His body is aching, and despite the heat in his head, he is shivering, his limbs shuddery and weak.
Molly smiles gratefully up at him, excusing herself from the company of her aunt with a promise that she’ll come and find her as soon as she has returned from her walk with Sherlock.
“I’m so sorry,” Miss Hooper says. “Please don’t go.” And then she says, in a much quieter voice that he suspects he isn’t meant to hear. “I’m ever so desperate for a friend.”
“Well, if I am a siren, it seems I’ve failed in my duties…”
“Don’t…” Sherlock arched against him. “Don’t bother preparing me, John. Just fuck me. I can’t stand it.”
It takes a long time for his eyes to adjust to the dim light down below and as a result, Sherlock is more than a little caught off guard when a slight figure, hurrying down the corridor, runs directly into him.
“Only when I tell you,” John says, his voice a tendril of heat uncurling between them as his hand begins to speed up again. “You beautiful, beautiful thing.”
all the containers (which is frankly impossible what with the lack of proper light and the manner in which things are stored), there’s no way for him to actually ascertain what’s in half of them, since he lacks the proper tools to get them open.
“John,” he murmurs, pulling the material of John’s trousers down his thighs, the same reverence in his tone that was in John’s look moments ago. “Oh,
“I mean does he work for Parliament?”
He slides an inquiring hand along the underside of the desk just to be sure but finds no trace of a key. No surprise there. A man as paranoid as the captain would keep his keys on his person at all times
There were times when Sherlock Holmes did something wrong and afterward remained blissfully unaware that he had been the cause of any wrongdoing whatsoever. Most of the time, in fact, he didn’t spare a thought for the negative repercussions of his actions. He simply acted and dealt with the consequences later.
The cool night air feels good on Sherlock’s face and it is a relief to get the stink of overdone-stew, the smell of warm whiskey, and the closeness of the other passengers out of his lungs. Sherlock drinks it in, in large grateful gulps.
He wants so many things—he wants to pull the soft blue shirt from John’s torso, to feel John’s belly against his own, to watch the muscles flexing in John’s lean stomach as he moves—he wants to lick the salt from John’s temples, to feel the softness of John’s hair against his mouth—he wants John’s cock hard and naked in his hand—in his mouth. He wants all of these things but he is so overcome from his yearning for John all day, and John’s hand against him feels
Sherlock does not need any more encouragement. He lets himself go, thrusting up as deeply as he can into the welcome wet heat of John’s mouth. The resulting sensation is so intense Sherlock feels the pleasure in him cresting like a wave.
His panic is swelling now, making it difficult to breathe. He thrusts it down; repeats the process again, his mouth over John’s mouth, watching John’s chest lift with his breath.
“Shit.” He broke away from Sherlock’s mouth, gasping. “Could you do that again?”
“I was just going to shoot you, but you’ve proved so aggravating I think you deserve a more unpleasant death. Tell me, Dr. Watson, are you a strong swimmer?”
who has really been suffering.
He decides to postpone his quest to speak with the Lieutenant until the captain has left the quarterdeck, and Sherlock heads back toward the staircase leading below decks, careful to keep his head down all the while, and never once let his gaze stray toward the helm of the ship.
Don’t worry, John will get to come in the next chapter. Thanks to his status as golden sailor god of sex he's got great stamina, so he won’t suffer too much.
At the thought of John, Sherlock’s heart gives a painful lurch, and he drops his head into his hands, fingers pulling at his hair.
Sherlock stopped licking to look up at John through heavy lashes. Even his eyelashes were dusted white with powdered sugar. His eyes still held that dreamy expression, his irises a pale ice blue.
“To be perfectly honest with you… I’ve never tried teaching anyone to play anything before.” Then, seeing the crest-fallen look on Billy’s face, he hurries on to say, “But given the opportunity, you know I could certainly try.”
Sherlock shuts his eyes.
He wants to be the best for John,
Through the blur of his tears, Sherlock is aware that John has stopped walking beside him. He stops walking too, overwhelmed all of a sudden by the noise and chaos of the street around them. He wipes savagely at his eyes with his sleeve, seared by embarrassment.
With all three men standing in the room, it’s more evident than it’s ever been before just how small the space is. There’s barely room for the four of them to all stand without touching.
John was shaking so hard now his teeth had started to chatter. “L-let go of me.”
He hears John laugh behind him.
“God, yes, perfect—don’t—don’t stop.”
In a voice so soft it can only be for Sherlock, John begins to sing in a language Sherlock has never heard.
at the Vienna State Opera that evening and John and Sherlock would be in attendance as well. At the close of the curtain they would make their arrest.
“I’m glad,” John says, his voice full of a kind of tentative wonder. “I’m so glad you think that I managed to do that.”
Sherlock pulls at the chain around his neck, lifting the locket out into the light. “Mary’s necklace that you still wear!”
“And here’s Fionn coming with his drum!”
He pulls out his pen and ink, almost spilling it in his haste to wet the nib, and begins scratching out notes to write new ones in.
, he tells himself.
Sherlock rubs his hands back over his face.
Sherlock recognizes his hateful neighbor Amesbury, along with several of the other wealthier passengers whose names Sherlock does not care to remember, but who all occupy rooms in the expensive roundhouse cabins at the back of the ship.
He is making a mess of the floor, but Sherlock reasons the floor is just as filthy as he has been and could do with a bit of a wash anyway.
Sherlock’s hands, still cradling his head, reached for him, trying to pull him back to his feet.
When he does, he sees, much to his surprise that John appears to be in conversation with someone walking just behind him up the steps, someone who is making him laugh in that absolutely devastating way he has of throwing his head back and laughing with his whole body, joy pouring out of him like light from a flame.
He breathes shallowly through his nostrils for several seconds, concentrating on the swinging spots of lantern light sliding over the wooden floor of the deck until the feeling passes.
Even the fact that they are standing here now and talking within plain sight of everyone on deck is dangerous, far too dangerous for John to be kept in ignorance.
“Sherlock, you’re going to be fine.” But something in John’s chest flipped unpleasantly at the desperation in Sherlock’s voice. “I’ll see you at the hospital. We’ll be right behind.”
“It tastes like champagne!”
“God…” Sherlock dragged his nose along John’s hairline, inhaling deeply. “The things I’ve wanted to do you all week.”
John gently arches one eyebrow in amusement, but he says nothing as he reaches for the bottle and empties it into the cup.
“I was not
“Here.” Sherlock took John’s pants and knelt between his knees. “Let me.”
John was about to refuse but the American was already lifting two crystal flutes from the tray, and pressing one into John’s hand.
he asks for he but he cannot answer and then John’s voice is melting away too, despite how Sherlock tries to reach for it, to hold onto it in the burning darkness.
he told himself, as he reached for the soap.
Hearing this question, Sherlock realizes that he is not alone in his anxiety over Lieutenant Lestrade’s wellbeing. It’s difficult to believe, after the display they all witnessed earlier, that the captain would suddenly concede to Lestrade’s plea. It doesn’t make sense.
He held his hips still as much as he wanted to keep moving. His voice was tight. “Okay so far?”
Sherlock’s curiosity gets the better of him.
“BRING SHIP TO ANCHOR! All hands to their stations!”
“There’s food if you’re hungry.”
He doesn’t need to say anything to John; he’s already off the bed and gathering his clothing in his arms. He doesn’t pause to dress. He crosses the room to the foot of the bed and is lowering himself to his knees when Sherlock grabs him by the arm.
, until Sherlock was eye-level with him again and he was looking directly into Sherlock’s bleeding, devastated face.
And so they wait, looking at one another in silence as the sounds of the ship coming to life around them creep in through the thin walls.
John shifted in his seat, suddenly all too aware of the memory of just how those fingers felt when they were curled inside him.
“The point is…” It takes a great deal of effort for Sherlock to lift his head and find John’s eyes again, to swallow down his shame and remember why it is he needs to say this. “You have made a difference, John. You’ve made all the difference. And I don’t know how I will ever repay you.”
Sherlock recognizes Old Leroy, playing a tune on his mouth organ to the evident delight of several men around him, who are clapping their hands and stomping their feet—and there is Billy, sitting at Old Leroy’s knee, his mouth stretched wide with laughter. Sherlock recognizes Matthews and Stapleton, Banana Bill and Lean Jack, MacTavish and Patterson, Stewarts and Half Pint Lee. He didn’t even realize how many of their names he knew until now, and seeing them, spitting, laughing and carrying on, Sherlock feels a wave of something like fondness overtake him. He feels far more at home here than he ever does up above.
What good is a piece of music that he cannot play?
John refuses at first, but Sherlock insists.
John felt the torn flesh on his arm stretch with the movement and gritted his teeth.
“So you’re saying you think we should just… wait until he poisons someone else?”
“Get him on his feet.”
John’s own mouth fell open at the sensation of the slick, wet heat of Sherlock enveloping him. His eyes flickered back up to Sherlock’s to find Sherlock still holding his gaze, and at the look in Sherlock’s eyes John made a guttural sound, his hips jerking under Sherlock’s hands.
Moriarty tilted his head as his fingers tightened.
(See the end of the chapter for
to distract himself from the fever in his brain, the longing that is devouring him from the inside out.
Sherlock rounded on Lestrade, his voice a snarl. “So what are you waiting for? Why are we all still standing here when there’s a serial killer currently
The next day, Sherlock is up with the sun.
The hot blue brilliance of the day seems to have affected the energy of the crew in a similar fashion to that of the passengers—there is little noticeable activity on the deck. A group of sailors sits at the foot of the mainmast, sewing sails and talking in low voices; a group of midshipmen are finishing their calculations on the quarterdeck in silence; and the lieutenants gathered near them are as quiet as the helmsman at the wheel.
It wasn’t real. It wasn’t real. It wasn’t real.
Sherlock was also not particularly loquacious when it came to the subject of interpersonal relationships and John found that having sex with Sherlock didn’t make him any easier to read.
Sherlock shifted slightly to reach for the sponge he had dropped. He poured fresh soap onto it with shaking fingers and John leaned back slightly to watch him, his breathing fast and shallow.
Sherlock is just considering stepping out of his hiding place and appealing to the older sailor. He does not know what to do and he is so desperate for any kind of advice or help that he almost breaks his prohibition not to talk to any of them, further endangering their livelihood, but just before he does, a sound from further down the deck draws Sherlock’s head up like a hare at the sound of a snapping twig.
“There’s been another one,” he said, maneuvering his long limbs out from under John’s body with surprising grace and disappearing into his bedroom before John could ask what he meant.
Sherlock made an assenting sound and spread his legs to bring his cock into direct contact with John’s. John gasped, his hands fisting in the material of Sherlock’s shirt.
Sherlock turns to wet his brush but something in John’s silence prompts him to look up again. John’s expression is complicated—part awe, part distress—and in that moment Sherlock remembers all over again how different are the worlds that he and John come from.
“I’m sorry. I’ve upset you,” Miss Hooper says at once, her voice full of anguish. “Please, please don’t misunderstand my intentions. I didn’t mean to laugh at you.”
want you. Please, John—”
he was to initiate that.
He was chewing gum. Spearmint. He was chewing loudly, like a parody of a teenage girl, his jaw splayed open to reveal the backs of his molars while he looked at John. His eyes were all pupil. “He’s like me. We don’t want what you little people want. We aren’t at the mercy of those
And then all of a sudden, John’s hips are moving again, pushing their cocks together in a rhythm that makes Sherlock cry out with pleasure, his own hips rocking up to meet John’s on every thrust, his hands sliding down to grip John by the arse.
“There! Now you’ve got a black eye. Not only does it help disguise your face, but now people will think twice before starting anything with you.”
Sherlock can feel the tremor in John’s thighs against him, and he knows it’s time to finally give John some relief.
Sherlock looks down at their hands, not trusting his expression not to betray his unhappiness.
The captain seems to look directly at John, and Sherlock feels his heart stop.
“That’s right, seven years and you’re still fumbling through simple astrological readings? You better shape up, Anderson, if you want to remain in this fleet. The Navy’s got no time for stupid, lazy sailors, much less officers. You’re on deck duty for the rest of the afternoon.”
Ferguson straightens up as he finishes speaking, having finished his pipe. The openness of his manner seems to dissolve as quickly as the vanishing smoke in the air around them.
“Sherlock, wait—”
John gasps above him, one hand coming instinctively up to grasp at Sherlock’s hair, his back arching to press himself closer.
Sherlock reached up and pulled John’s hands from off of his face. He kissed the spilt skin on his knuckles where he had fallen on the ice, before kissing each finger. “I want to see you.”
“Easy, easy, easy.” John’s voice is a sigh, gentle enough to accompany the soft movement of his hands, as they start to ease the material down Sherlock’s hips.
Sherlock doesn’t answer. Instead, he lets his fingers slide down John’s torso, over the sun-warmed grooves of his ribs. His thumbs linger in the hollow of John’s belly, brushing oh so softly at the swell of John’s hips. Sherlock watches with fascination the change that comes over John’s face at his touch. His eyelids look suddenly heavy.
John’s hands were still covering his face; he gasped quietly into them as Sherlock’s expert fingers began to stroke.
John shuts his eyes, his fists clenching tighter.
He felt Sherlock’s free hand settle in the dip at the base of his spine and pull him one step closer, bringing their bodies fully into alignment. John felt his heart stutter in his chest.
John sipped his tea, contemplating. It hadn’t even been a week since the incident with Moriarty and he was embarrassed to admit that he felt slightly apprehensive about taking on another case. He knew that the odds of having another bomb strapped to his chest with a serial killer purring in his ear were slim to none, but he couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that hovered around him like a bad odor.
John opens his eyes.
And with a final searing glare, Knott turns and retreats down the corridor.
“But John—!”
Turning his face, John opened his mouth and slid it down Sherlock’s torso, lingering over every beautiful bone, finally, finally tasting his ribs, the swell of his hip, inhaling the musk at the juncture of his thigh and pelvis.
But much as he wants to believe this is true, Sherlock’s encounter with John earlier tells him otherwise.
“How—how are you so good at this?”
John bends to press a kiss to Sherlock’s hip, and this time, Sherlock cannot stop his hips from jerking in response, a low whimper issuing from his throat.
“You didn’t—” John hesitated and then let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. “You don’t remember anything?”
Supper is a dull affair, but to Sherlock’s profound relief, he hears no news of further incidents onboard the ship. All the talk that evening is of the banking crisis back in London that erupted when the ship left England’s shores. They have of course had no news on further developments since the ship left Portsmouth so all the talk is nothing more than speculation.
John gave a low moan at the feeling of being stretched further open, hitching himself higher up on his elbows, spreading his thighs to take Sherlock deeper.
“Of course, my love.”
He pressed the letter into Sherlock’s hand, and Sherlock gave the boy a coin for his trouble and turned his attention to the note. However the boy remained standing where he was.
“Good morning,” Sherlock calls out, in what he hopes is a pleasantly neutral tone as he approaches.
“Hello, Billy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
After so many hours trudging through the tropical afternoon heat in all of their clothing—after months and months of the stagnant, oppressive heat on board the ship, surrounded always by the enticing blue ocean but unable to gain any relief from it—now, to be wearing nothing at all and feel the cool water meet his thighs and then envelop his hips—the sensation is pure heaven.
John fought for some semblance of control, even as he felt himself slipping, sliding down so easily into the darkness of his own pleasure.
He couldn’t even bring himself to type that out for fear that if he did Sherlock would somehow be able to read the deleted material via the fingerprints on his keyboard. The blinking cursor flashed at him, as if mocking his indecision.
He flipped Sherlock onto his front, and pulled his arm up tight under Sherlock’s throat. “Don’t. Fucking. Push me, Sherlock. Don’t do it.”
“It isn’t your fault,” he says, pressing a kiss into Sherlock’s hair. “None of it, do you hear me? There’s no reason for you to feel guilty.”
"How can I respect your decision when it's not even what you want yourself?"
Sherlock is filled suddenly with a horrible, insidious doubt.
They drag Anderson off, and Sherlock staggers blindly to his feet and out the door, angry tears burning at the corners of his eyes as he races up the stairs to the upper deck.
Sherlock watches them, breathless, feeling the music filling him up, making his chest tight with emotion. Listening to this strange, wonderful music, watching the dancers move across the floor, he feels as he sometimes does when he is with John, as if his body cannot contain all that he is feeling, and all of a sudden, it’s unbearable to him that he does not have his fiddle, that he cannot stride up to the other three musicians and simply begin playing. He’s certain that they wouldn’t mind—what’s more, he wouldn’t care if they did.
It only takes one word.
All he wants is one look at John up in the foretop to assure him that everything’s all right.
“God, if I could have you in a proper bed… no banged elbows, no scratchy threadbare blankets… no need to keep quiet. Think of it. Just think of it.”
“That or a whole different range of unspeakable acts,” McKinley adds with a dark look before refilling his glass. “If you get my meaning.”
Sherlock is not quite sure what to make of any of it, but it occurs to him that Burns’ comment may have been for his benefit.
For a moment, John was afraid he was going to come right then.
“How’s… how’s that?” Sherlock’s question was a stream of heat against John’s open mouth.
Without a word to any of them, Sherlock places a hand on Molly’s arm and leans forward to whisper in her ear. “Come with me, I have something to show you.”
First, unlock handcuffs; second, realign shoulder. It’s a simply matter of bending the elbow and rotating the arm and shoulder inward towards the chest and then outward, pushing until the shoulder fits back into the shoulder joint.
The room was the same as John remembered with one major difference: all around the instruments of torture were stacked the corpses of Moriarty’s victims. They lay in messy piles, naked, limbs disfigured, pale eyes staring at nothing, their bare and ruined bodies overlapping obscenely. Many of them were unfamiliar to John, but one or two, he recognized—the couple they’d found in the dumpster, the man from the butcher shop, the woman dressed in pink from the very first case he and Sherlock had solved together.
The men laugh in response to this.
“You could never hurt me,” Sherlock says, moving his hands from John’s cock back around to grab him by the arse, not really conscious of what he’s saying, distracted by the feeling of the twin curves of muscle under his hands. God, it makes him
He holds out the empty cup, trying not to look desperate. “More, please.”
He was young—six, maybe seven years old when Mycroft had taken him to London for the first time, on an errand to purchase new clothes for school. He had been thrumming with excitement. He could not wait to see it, the city he’d read so much about in books it had taken on a mythic significance in his mind. He remembered pressing his face to the window of the carriage for most of the journey, fogging up the glass, Mycroft continually tugging on the back of his collar to make him sit down properly.
Sherlock is careful not to disguise the disdain in his voice. “What is it you want?”
Sherlock lay down on his side, with his back to the door.
Catching his eye, John follows the direction of Sherlock’s gaze and seems to guess the nature of his thoughts. He watches John’s expression darken.
“Oh! Well for me grog, me jolly, jolly grog!”
What started out as an emotional need has now transformed into a physical ache, a vibrating force humming over the surface of his body, so that when his palm slides in against John’s, the shock of contact between them makes him gasp softly.
John went into the kitchen and peered into the fridge, and then the freezer. He returned to the doorway of the living room. Sherlock hadn’t moved.
None the less, Sherlock cannot shake the feeling that the man was watching him for a reason.
Sherlock knows it’s the wine talking—that it’s gone slightly to his head, but it’s also John. John makes him feel as though Sherlock is a boat pulled loose from its moorings, cast helplessly out to sea. He always has that effect on Sherlock; it’s only that the wine takes down the barrier between these thoughts and the world outside Sherlock’s head, so Sherlock feels no hesitation voicing them out loud.
He loves to make John sound like this—John, who’s seen so much of the world, who’s done so much, who
“No, no, no. We can’t, Sherlock—we can’t. Not after last night. Not here.” He shakes his head at Sherlock through the dark. “It’s too risky.”
Anderson is in his element; his chair is tipped back from the table with casual arrogance, balancing on two legs, and his triumphant smile is so broad it looks as though it will split his sneering face.
Perhaps they will live on an island that is theirs alone, and John will teach him how to open coconuts and drink their milk, how to clean the fish they catch and cook them over an open fire. At night, Sherlock will play his violin for John and watch his face, lit by the warmth of the dying flames, grow more and more tender.
“No, I w-wouldn’t,” he gasped. “I don’t want that.” His hips lifted up against Sherlock of their own accord, desperate for more friction.
“Help me Bob, I’m Bully in the Alley.”
Sherlock’s head rolls forward on his neck as John’s mouth finds his ear, murmuring against it.
The crew is another matter. They are fascinating to him, but for a different reason entirely they also keep well out of his way. To them, he might as well be another species—a strange dark bird hovering around them as they do their work, harmless, but not to be engaged with.
If he cannot provide John with a pleasant space to be in during his brief window of freedom, at least he can make himself as appealing as possible.
“So… you like it?”
It is the type of call and response song that Sherlock has heard the sailors sing while they are working—similar to the songs they sang when Sherlock helped them paint the deck—one man leads the song calling out the verses, and the rest of the men join in on the chorus.
Sherlock tips his head back, his own hands stilling on John’s chest. The sensation of John breathing him in, as though he is trying to somehow pull Sherlock deep inside his lungs, is so affecting, he can feel all the heat in his body drawn in a single heartbeat, down between his legs.
John falls on Sherlock’s upturned mouth, plunging his tongue between Sherlock’s parted lips and stroking the length of Sherlock’s tongue, hands pulling gently all the while at Sherlock’s curls.
As reluctant as Deverall and Dimmock may be to conduct this search, if they do actually
Until then, I am sending you all lots of sea and summery love! <3
Although his voice may be uncertain, the look in John’s eyes communicates everything Sherlock needs to know about how he will answer.
When John and Sherlock emerge back on deck, the late afternoon sun is blazing low and hot in the sky, basking everything in honey-colored light.
“I should hope not. What do you have to report?”
“Nope, not with what I have in mind. You will emerge from the experience as cool as the corpses in St. Bart’s.”
He thinks abruptly of John and his throat seizes up.
Sherlock urges Molly forward.
Sherlock barely has time to suck in a breath before John’s lips are covering his and moving over Sherlock’s, soft and slow and wet. Sherlock pushes up into the lovely heat of John’s mouth, parting his lips, inviting him in, his fingers tightening around John’s where they lie against his belly.
John fired.
“I am in possession of some information that I think you would be interested in hearing. If you remove Anderson from his position… I’ll tell you what I know.”
As soon as the word is out of his mouth, he knows he’s made a mistake. He feels John stiffen under his hands and in that instant knows that John will wake up.
“It’s like… you’re lit up, and even though I can’t see the source of that light, when you play, Sherlock, everyone can see it too. It’s breathtaking, Sherlock. You’re breathtaking.”
Sherlock nods, still feeling the ache in his throat at the implications of John’s words.
“I can take a lot. I’ve a high tolerance for unpleasantness of all kinds, and normally it doesn’t get to me. Petty simpletons like Anderson trying to drag other people down to their level—it’s easy to rise above people who stoop that low, who spend all their time down in the muck. But when people like that—” John’s throat closes up. Sherlock can hear the effort it takes him to continue speaking; hears the thin exhalation of his breath before he goes on. “When people like that try and keep me from you…”
Sherlock closes his eyes.
’s midshipmen. I believed Marcus might feel more comfortable spending his shore leave with shipmates of his own station.”
Somebody passes his flask down the line to offer John a congratulatory swig.
“God, John, you’re beautiful…”
But for that very reason they are awfully… restrictive, and between his erection and the heat of the tropical morning, the relief he feels at finally being free of them is profound.
John felt tears burn the corners of his eyes and his self-hatred was complete.
“HUZZAH!”
“He didn’t take me up on my offer.”
“What could be fun? No, Sherlock, get OFF!”
When Sherlock reaches the top step, he cannot help but pause a moment to drink in a deep lungful of the evening air—it isn’t necessarily cool, and it’s still thick and muggy, but it is a hundred times better than the stuffy air below decks.
Sherlock almost drops the bottle.
But the futility of this plan makes itself known before Sherlock can even finish the thought. He’s now been told to stay out of trouble by nearly half the population of the ship, if he goes looking for Billy he’s bound to run into some of them.
John leaned all the way in until his cheek was pressed to Sherlock’s chest. He sighed softly. He was still holding his gun in his left hand. Sherlock held himself absolutely still.
Sherlock is so lost in the feeling of John’s fingers that when John finally speaks his quiet voice startles Sherlock out of his trance.
John scrubs a bandaged hand down his face as if he’s trying to draw himself back from the edge. There’s sweat shining at his temples. When he looks back up, Sherlock can see that the blue in his irises has receded to the slenderest rings around his pupils.
At the sight of him, Sherlock feels his throat close up with dread, but before his panic can eclipse his last rational thought, Lestrade says, “There’s two more coming.”
John shifted his lower body closer, sliding one of his legs in between Sherlock’s tensed thighs, so that his hips were tucked in next to Sherlock’s, his own fingers brushing the outline of his own cock as he stroked.
“Let me light the lamp. I can’t see you.”
Taking advantage of the silence created by the boy’s remark, Sherlock clears his throat. He raises his voice, gathering his courage to himself like a blanket. “Are all members of the crew invited?”
This time the command in his tone was unmistakable. “Move.”
John places two gentle fingers under Sherlock’s chin and tilts his head to lift his gaze to John’s. John’s eyes are fathomless.
John squeezed some of the clear, cold gel onto his shaking fingers—he was almost as far gone as Sherlock by now—and breathed against it in a futile effort to warm it.
John sniffs and blinks the last of his tears away.
The case had been cold for several months. Lestrade had been otherwise occupied and John and Sherlock had been busy with cases from the blog, but early this morning they’d received a phone call from Lestrade that the ringleader’s whereabouts had finally been ascertained.
Sherlock, on the other hand, hated the heat. He languished. It made his dark curls go limp and cling to his neck, and his sharp cheekbones flush with color. Somehow he was capable of acquiring a sunburn mere minutes after stepping outside. He became more violent and irritable than ever (which was saying something). He had no patience for his body’s need to slow down in order to cope, and he grew steadily more enraged at what he regarded as its inability to function properly.
Sherlock’s lips slid over John’s, panting into his mouth as he pushed a hand between them to wrap both of their cocks in his fist. John cried out at the feeling and Sherlock ground his hips down into him, tightening his fist as he did so, biting at John’s lips.
“OYE LADS! Look who’s gone and got his fiddle!”
Sherlock wants to say something, wants to do something by way of offering comfort but he has no experience with this. He doesn’t know what to do, what to say, to ease the weight of John’s suffering. His own feelings are a maelstrom of agonized confusion. He feels sorrow for John’s loss but he cannot ignore the deep throb of jealousy over this past love that seems to tug at his heart.
John smoothes them away with his thumbs. “Oh god, Sherlock, please don’t cry. It isn’t—it’s just—” John’s voice is agonized. “You’ve got to stop doing this. It isn’t your fault, all right? There’s something wrong with him. I don’t know why he’s taking it out on you—he’s jealous of you, I think, insecure. But it isn’t
Sherlock turns at the sound of the voice, and sees Stevens standing just a few paces away, an empty paint bucket in his hand, presumably on his way to refill it. His scowling face is badly sunburned.
“You shouldn’t say that to me.”
He squares his shoulders, lifting his chin in an unconscious attempt to make himself feel less intimidated, and steps into the room.
John’s fingers rub slow circles against the sharp ridges of Sherlock’s hips through the fabric of his shirt. Sherlock stops breathing entirely.
“That was good,” Sherlock says, “You should do it again, but kiss me while you’re—”
The absence of an answer to this question opens up like a void inside of Sherlock.
feeling helpless, feeling weak. He’s spent half his life feeling this way, but never has he felt more stripped of all agency than with Stevens’ fist wrapped around his throat.
Sherlock goes rigid against him.
Sherlock looks over at John and even though it’s only been
And I know at this point, my promises are probably meaningless to you, but I swear, THE KISS IS COMING, and so much more. Hang in there, gentle readers! YOU WILL BE REWARDED FOR YOUR PATIENCE MULTIPLE TIMES OVER.
Sherlock pushes the thought aside and refocuses on John’s voice.
Sherlock’s mind is already worrying over the next set of questions that have arisen as a result of this new information. Why on earth would the captain have cause to poison Mr. Knott? And what does that have to do, if anything, with the proposition put to him by Mr. Ferguson?
Sherlock uses the slickness now coating his palm to ease the friction of his fingers as they stroke down the blood-bright heat of John. He is rewarded with another low groan from John, followed by a string of curses.
John’s face brightens as he finds whatever he was searching for.
The sounds of the party have faded above them, replaced by the familiar sloshing sound of water rushing against the sides of the ship, the creaking of the beams overhead, and Sherlock is suddenly grateful for the persistent darkness below deck because it means that no one can see them now, no more eyes following them, whispering, watching—Sherlock feels the blissful anonymity of it cloak them like a blanket.
Sherlock stands, fully aware that the next move is the captain’s to make.
Something dark and complicated flashes through John’s eyes.
Either way, he tries as hard as possible to banish the issue from his mind and concentrate instead on getting well.
“The way you’re touching me…”
One of the sailors sitting and watching the exchange calls out in alarm. “Stevens!”
The thought that he is naked save for the silver chain around his throat, the intricate locket lying heavy against his chest, warmed by the flush of his skin, while John is bending half-clothed above him makes a thrill of arousal move through him so sharp and all-encompassing he feels slightly dizzy in the aftermath.
It’s absurd; it’s an absurd promise to make, impossible to carry out. As strong as John may be, as determined as he is, he is only one man. The ship is staffed by dozens of men. If even half of them put their minds to subduing John, they would win. There is no question about it. Simply by sheer force of numbers, they would win. But something in John’s voice, in his demeanor, inspires absolute belief in Sherlock, makes a chill run down his spine, makes the hair stand up on the back of his neck.
Sherlock’s eyes flutter open—the look on his face like someone coming out of a trance.
And yet the fear still runs like a dark current through his heart. It is there, always, beating in his blood, shadowing his every thought.
For this reason, Sherlock vows silently to pay attention whenever the captain’s name comes up in conversation. More knowledge in this matter can only be helpful at this point, to avoid falling victim to the cruel man’s whims.
Knott stops walking abruptly.
“Do you know…” John says into his ear, his voice soft and low, only for Sherlock. A shiver of pleasure goes down Sherlock’s spine at the feeling. “… there’s a song that goes with this tune?”
“What’s more, I happen to know that his affections lie elsewhere.”
John has no idea about the renewed risk that’s involved in their meeting.
“Ahh.”
John’s voice is gentle now, even if his eyes are still full of flame. Sherlock can see John’s eyes scouring his face for any sign of a mark.
Sherlock’s mind is reeling—everything is happening too quickly—he cannot keep up with the words coming out of John’s mouth.
, Sherlock wryly thinks.
“Very good, ladies. Shall we say… four o’clock then?”
But the humor is all gone from Sherlock’s voice now, his breath sharpening as John slides his hands around until they settle low on Sherlock’s back.
Sherlock doesn’t answer but he tightens his arms around John’s waist, and John chuckles, the sound low and pleasantly rough.
Sherlock ducked his head, a small, pleased smile beginning to pull at his lips. “When you were sleeping.”
As they stood in the glittering lobby, waiting for the doors to open, Sherlock was the very picture of casual elegance. His ability to blend seamlessly in with his surroundings was more evident here than ever—the slightly bored expression on his face gave no hint of the intense concentration with which he was scrutinizing the expanse of the room. Only John recognized it because he knew Sherlock so well, knew that the muted glimmer in Sherlock’s eyes signaled a deadly threat.
“Oh god, you brilliant thing.”
He crossed the room and pulled the curtains shut, turning back around to face his bed.
John steps with haste into the room and Sherlock lunges behind him to pull the door shut, plunging them into total darkness.
John hissed at the sight of it. “Christ, Sherlock.”
John’s hands lock around Sherlock’s neck, and he laughs suddenly, low and breathless.
“Ah, it looks as though there’s to be some dancing.”
Gradually their cries of ‘Witchcraft! He used witchcraft, that’s how! He got his faerie friends to help him!’ roused the attention of one of the gardeners who chased the children away and untied Sherlock. The kind old man was one of the only allies Sherlock had on the grounds of the house. He used to scold Sherlock for picking things from the gardens that he wasn’t meant to, but gradually he began to take pity on the boy and left him to his own devices.
He sighs moodily as he finishes drying himself, thinking about how
He jerked his entire body once more, trying to buck his opponent off.
“Luckily for her I think she’s very hard of hearing.”
He slips his tongue into John’s mouth, his hands sliding up to cradle John’s face, making his intentions clear with the deliberate pressure of his tongue against John’s.
At the thought of this—John biting at the tender skin of his neck while he thrusts against him—Sherlock rolls over onto his stomach, burying his face in the crook of his arm to smother his moans, thrusting into the circle of his fist once, twice, three times—and then he is spending himself into the sheets, hips bucking, the line of his body gone taut as he comes and comes in a dizzying rush of release, so hard and fast that he wonders for a moment if he actually loses consciousness.
He still has a long way to go but Sherlock can feel the difference his ability to concentrate has made and he is quietly pleased.
Sherlock cries out, head tipping further back in the sand, his fingers clenching in the skin of John’s back.
Her voice is a squeak of barely suppressed excitement. “Oh! I haven’t met John yet—not formally anyway. I’ve seen him around the ship of course, but I’ve never been properly introduced.”
“Because you know things that I don’t know. And you understand… you understand.”
” Sherlock’s whole body stiffened against him and he rolled his hips again. “Oh
“I… he had a copy of the ship’s manifest. I heard him arguing with another passenger last week, and I suspected it had something to do with Lestrade’s poisoning, so I—I went to talk to him, and when I did, I saw it in his room, and I took it. I thought maybe the reason the captain has been so eager to get to port is because he’s smuggling, I thought maybe I could use the manifest to prove it...”
His own voice comes out harsh and rusty, and Sherlock realizes in that moment just how many days it’s been since he’s spoken.
John stared back at Sherlock, startled. “What about it?”
When he comes to, the first thing he notices is the smell of rot—a putrid stench like old flesh decomposing—and the sound of water rushing very close by.
The movement of Sherlock sliding an arm under his shoulders is enough to make the world heave around him. The colors of the island flicker into darkness. John shuts his eyes.
Wrapping a sheet around his torso, Sherlock crosses to the door and is surprised when he opens it to find, in place of the usual sullen, scowling face of Jameson, the passenger steward, the bright and eager face of Billy, looking up at him
climates—not if we don’t have to.”
John couldn’t look Sherlock in the eye. He let his head drop, but that didn’t stop him from hearing the horror in Sherlock’s voice.
He sits up on his knees, feeling his arousal increase as he pulls the stopper free and coats his fingers—thinking of John as he does so, John’s hand on his guiding his hand down between John’s legs.
by anyone, but still.
“Much better. Goodness, you are obedient. I’d forgotten. So good at following orders. Must be all that time in the army.”
The ship is markedly quiet this morning. After so many hours filled with the sounds of music, drunken laughter and carrying voices, it seems strange to hear nothing but the usual groaning protests of the
He wipes his face with the back of his hand and rises to pour himself a glass of water, hoping it will wash the taste of dread from his mouth.
He knew—he
“I don’t know what made her finally change her mind but it certainly wasn’t me. It may have been Mycroft,” Sherlock admitted grudgingly. John could hear the unyielding resentment in Sherlock’s voice, despite what was probably the truth of that statement. “It was the year he went away to school and I think he felt badly, leaving me alone. I was always trailing after him. He was probably relieved to get rid of me, but I was seven that year and lonelier than ever. He came home for holidays and who knows? Maybe he realized how miserable I was. At any rate, they relented. It was meant to be both my and Mycroft’s dog, a shared responsibility, but as I said, Mycroft was away at school at that point, and my parents didn’t care for him one way or the other, so really he was my dog. I always thought so anyway.”
His tone was different. It had lost its edge of desperation and now sounded… curious, inquisitive.
But John’s arm is around him—he can feel the solid weight of it against him, and every point at which John’s body leans in to meet his own is a confirmation to him—finally—that this is no dream. He can trust the feeling of John’s body against his because this, he knows, he could not dream up.
“Just what the doctor ordered…”
“How did the man find you?”
“I’m afraid I do not know,” Sherlock manages at long last.
He grabs for Billy’s arm, his voice rigid with sudden fear. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
Sherlock can feel himself physically shrinking with shame.
It does not take long for John to kiss Sherlock’s frowning lips apart, until he is licking into Sherlock’s mouth, his hand reaching down between them to coax Sherlock’s erection back to life, cupping his bullocks in his hand, and massaging them lightly, making Sherlock gasp and part his thighs to give John better access.
It felt strange, seeing Sherlock so vulnerable, but it made John instinctively want to protect him. He brought his arms up around Sherlock’s shoulders and squeezed.
“You’re worrying aren’t you?”
“Give this man a hearty portion, Mr. Stamford, don’t skimp now! He’s earned it!”
Time seems to stand still for several lurching heartbeats in the wake of the captain’s departure.
Sherlock was utterly still for a count of five of John’s rapid heartbeats and then he was a swirl of movement again, scrambling to his feet and seizing one of the knives from the nearby table, reaching for John’s wrists.
He froze with one hand on the railing, overcome at the memory. And then a panicked thought gripped him.
“Please,” Sherlock says, wondering just how many times he will be forced to say the words this evening. “Call me Sherlock.”
God, he’d been so naïve.
“What for?” Sherlock had sneered. “No one’s going to read it.”
Sherlock nods again, and he must look as miserable as John because without another word John turns to reach for the door handle.
Sherlock nods, and Deverall whistles long and low, shaking his head.
He licks his lips, gone impossibly dry.
He reached for his bottle of discount shampoo but Sherlock made a disapproving noise and swatted his hand away. “Let me.”
He tried once more to no avail. John let out a yell of rage.
Sherlock’s knees jerk upward in response. His breath is a low hiss of need.
He pushes his finger in, drawing an astonished breath at how easily John’s body takes him in with the help of the oil. Encouraged, he slides the tip of his middle finger around the rim, relishing the sound of John’s sharply drawn breath in response.
What would they do to John if they caught him sending messages to Sherlock?
He hasn’t dressed for the weather. Rain is running down the back of John’s neck and he’s reminded sharply of the feeling of sweat on his skin from his dream of the island. He suddenly feels hot in spite of his soaking jacket.
John parted his thighs as wide as they would go, felt the heavy heat of his cock fall against his hip, his balls tight beneath it.
But he does not know where to look next. Where do they take sailors to punish them below decks?
“And as you’ll soon discover, it feels fucking
Sherlock studies the ceiling, swallowing hard.
John must be up there, crawling among the ropes, clinging to the mast like a tick to the back of a wild dog, holding on for dear life as the storm tries to tear him off and throw him to his death in the churning chaos of the sea.
Sherlock nods, his voice warm and resonant and low; in his eyes, he hopes, the promise of all that tomorrow will bring.
Sherlock looks over at John, startled. “She was?”
“Disciplinary action, you say?” The Colonel lowers his voice as he steps closer. “Not the poor lad who was late to his shift this morning?”
He smiles at her, and Sherlock can practically feel Molly swooning beside him.
He staggers outside, thinking he will go after her and call her back, but when he reaches the corridor there is no sign of Molly, only Colonel Jackson, walking slowly in the opposite direction with a case in his hand.
“Better hurry along now! I’m sure he’s waiting for you!”
“Billy,” Sherlock says with sudden renewed urgency. “Tell Mr. Stamford that it’s for me—John’s friend—Sherlock Holmes. Tell him it’s a special favor for me, and if he can spare it, tell him I’ll pay him back in triple—when I can. Will you tell him that?”
John recognized this response. It was often what happened when he and Sherlock found themselves in situations of extreme danger. His body had converted entirely to combat-mode. His heart was beating very fast.
When John found it—his clever fingers so adept at braiding and sewing and climbing equally adroit at finding the precise way to bring Sherlock pleasure—Sherlock would not be able to stop himself from crying out against John’s mouth, a whine building low and desperate in the base of his throat, and John would kiss him harder, the hand on Sherlock’s hip coming up to hold Sherlock so gently by the place where his jaw meets his ear, and that is the gesture that will push Sherlock over the edge—that tender placement of John’s fingers on his jaw line, dragging the orgasm out of him in a burst of light.
Sherlock is so deep in his sudden fit of melancholy that he completely forgets he is with Miss Hooper, and it takes him a moment to realize that she has grown quiet beside him.
Again, when the chorus of men’s voices reaches the end of the song, Sherlock and the other two musicians play on long after the singing is done. When they finally come to a stop to the furious delight of the crowd, the drummer leans over to Sherlock.
“See you at dinner?”
An unexpected giddiness is rising up in Sherlock. It must be all the stress of the last twenty-four hours—the fact that their fate has been flipping back and forth like a fish flopping out of a boiling kettle and then back in again.
He heard the smile in Sherlock’s voice. “Exactly.”
Perhaps John does sense his unease, because he’s lowering his mouth to Sherlock’s ear again. “What do you think?”
It was several moments before John opened his eyes again, before he noticed that Sherlock still had not moved beside him.
His voice is so deep it’s almost unrecognizable.
He scrubs a bandaged hand down over his face and Sherlock sees the weariness return to his posture all at once. It makes him want to lunge forward and take hold of John, to chase it out of him again, with words, with kisses—anything to make that exhausted, worn-down quality go away.
Oh, how it aches.
The depth of the sound is due to the different shape of the body—the fact that it’s bigger, longer, more square than a violin—and the richness comes from the extra sympathetic strings. But, Sherlock realizes, listening, that he can also
John pulled Sherlock up to his mouth, feeling utterly boneless, barely conscious, his body humming with the aftermath of his orgasm, gasping softly as Sherlock’s tongue met his, overwhelmed for a moment at the taste of himself on Sherlock’s lips.
“Why would you think that?”
With no John to go looking for, now there is truly no reason to leave his cabin.
“My blue shirt?” John asks quietly, grinning, his tongue coming out to trace one corner of his smiling mouth. “Do you like it?”
John makes it look so easy. It clearly comes naturally to him, talking to other people,
John could feel the warm weight of Sherlock’s very erect cock pressing down against his, could feel the shape of it against Sherlock’s expensive trousers, and he whimpered into Sherlock’s mouth, rolling his hips to cause friction.
Sherlock nods cautiously, his eyes trained on the two officers on watch standing by the helm. “As long as we keep our voices down and our eyes alert for any unwanted participants, I don’t see why not.”
Sherlock does not need to be asked twice.
He suddenly remembers his bleeding hand, and his agitation with himself and his own stupidity is severe, as he must waste precious seconds tearing off a length of his now ruined shirt to wrap around his palm. The cut is shallow and scarcely bleeding anymore, but Sherlock binds it just to be sure he does not spill a drop of blood onto the triangle of paper.
He pulls at his neck cloth as he climbs the stairs to the upper decks, desperate for a bit of fresh air, even if it means also welcoming the brutal intensity of the tropical sun.
Sherlock’s eyes found John’s and they were shining turquoise, bright with sorrow. John’s eyes raked Sherlock’s, his mind struggling to follow the logic of Sherlock’s words. He felt like he was in shock.
John sat back on Sherlock’s legs, grinning. “God, you could really come just from this, couldn’t you?”
“Ho there, Johnny Boy!” Burns takes the needle out of his mouth and nods first at John, then at Sherlock in greeting. Sherlock is certain he sees something glimmer in the older man’s eyes as his gaze falls on Sherlock, but just as quickly, his eyes slide back to John. “Did you manage to get that nap you were so desperate for?”
To his profound relief, Stevens does not follow him, but Sherlock hears the sound of his voice calling after Sherlock.
Sherlock feels distaste uncurl sharply within him; of all the passengers he dislikes on board this ship (and there are many) McKinley is by far his least favorite.
John was halfway through his second plate, and more able to spare his attention now that his immediate hunger had been satisfied.
The darkness was thicker on the next floor and when he reached the landing he saw that all the doors along the hallway were shut. He walked past them without a second glance and continued onward to the next flight of stairs.
John had already eaten his way through almost the entirety of the contents on the cart and was just tucking into his second plate of pastries, happily spilling crumbs all over the sheet and the newspaper in his lap, when the mound of eiderdowns beside him stirred.
John added a second finger slowly wiggling them both once the second finger was as deep as the first.
Following the sounds of the scuffle, Sherlock looks down the deck to see Molly, at last, hunched in her uniform, the collar of her jacket raised to hide her face, tripping over her own feet in her eagerness to get out of the way of the sailor unloading cargo on the opposite side of the deck from where the longboats are being lowered into the water.
The heat and the texture of the sensitive skin of Sherlock’s glans, the slippery salt taste of him, the moisture already gathered at the tip—all of the sensory details combined to drive home to John the intimacy of the act he was performing, and he moaned low and needy in the back of his throat as he closed his mouth fully around his length.
It really didn’t get better than John Watson, and John Watson was all
Sherlock nods, his throat tight.
When John begins speaking again his voice is slow and measured, his tone deliberate, as though he’s given every word a great deal of thought. He keeps his eyes on Sherlock’s fingers while he talks.
“Did the steward stay long after he had delivered the drinks? Did each man take a glass?”
The question made him furious but he realized he couldn’t actually stand right now, not without help. He nodded anyway, and felt Sherlock shift his grip so that he was holding John just under the elbows.
Sherlock’s heart is pounding so loudly he can hear the blood roaring in his ears.
Sherlock nods again, having forgotten completely that the taking of meals onboard the ship is of course something that will continue even while the ship is at anchor.
John let out a guttural moan at the image that sent into his head.
“I’m fine,” he gasps out, reaching up to pull the lapels of his coat out of John’s hands. “Just—hot. Too hot. I’ll be fine in a minute. Like you said, I just need to…sit.”
“Good,” John says, his dark eyes lingering on Sherlock’s mouth. “That’s very, very good.”
He stuffs the paper into the front of his jacket and returns to where he was standing, just as Ferguson re-appears again, now with a clay pipe in hand.
John clenched the hand that wasn’t clutching Sherlock’s into a fist at his side. He could feel the heat from Sherlock’s breath all along its length; felt his cock twitch in anticipation.
He slides his fingers down over the muscles in John’s arms, distracted. “I want—to touch you while you’re touching me—”
John took a deep breath and turned to Lestrade. “Fancy giving me a ride?”
The darkness is deeper than it was when he fell asleep and the voices and the footsteps of the other passengers are noticeably absent. Sherlock reasons it must be sometime before midnight.
That John can do this for them, that he can give this to them when they are suffering—now that Sherlock knows more intimately than ever the unceasing misery of their lives—he finally understands just how powerful that is.
“I’m sorry. I’ll leave you. Please forgive me again for intruding.”
John lifts his arms above him to help Sherlock in his efforts, and Sherlock is careful when pulling at John’s sleeves not to let the fabric touch his hands.
He runs through his morning exercises, spends two hours perfecting the final movement in his composition (the arpeggio for the second violin, it turns out, was exactly what was missing), and then ascends to the upper decks with a newfound levity to his movements, eager as always for his first glimpse of John.
He glanced back up the staircase they had just come down and saw smoke beginning to stream out along the ceiling. Fear settled like a cold weight in the pit of his stomach.
“You know you’re going to have to move the pillow to drink this.”
Lestrade’s eyes are unfocused but he manages to sit up with John’s help, slumped over on his shoulder.
The man gives a curt nod of acknowledgment. “If you’d ever like a tour of the ship, I’d be happy to show you around.”
Sherlock’s cheeks are burning.
“Tell me you know,” John insists, rising again, gathering Sherlock in his arms, drawing Sherlock’s body close to him until both their chests are pressed together, until the pounding of their hearts seem to speak in tandem.
“How could you have known?” Sherlock’s voice is fierce. He will not let John take any of the blame for
It doesn’t take long for Sherlock to lose himself completely in the task at hand. He is concentrating so hard on getting it right that the rest of the world recedes to a pleasant blur behind him. He can hear the voices of the men around him as they begin another song, John’s voice clearer than all the others, steady and rich at his side.
“John, you’ve got to give up on me. I’m not coming back.”
If John wants to know the details, let him ask.
He doesn’t even realize he has seized the shaving glass beside his bed until he hears the sound of its shattering upon impact with the flimsy cabin wall.
John saw relief wash over Sherlock’s face. He couldn’t stop himself from chuckling.
“I have a letter to post,” Sherlock says, dropping his eyes, hating himself for adopting an obsequious posture in his sudden fear.
Sherlock is grateful that the audience was too caught up in John’s performance to notice or remember that he was supposed to be playing along. Everyone’s attention is firmly fixed on John, who seems to be waiting patiently for the applause to die down, but it only gets louder as he stands there, grinning, until he’s forced to duck his head and bow, which only makes the cheers grow louder.
The opening scene of this chapter has some mild violence (nothing worse than you have seen so far), and some early-19th century homophobic slurs. If that is potentially difficult for you, please proceed with caution. <3
He opens his mouth to apologize to John for directing him into such a dark and horrible hiding place, but before he can say anything, John is rising up on his knees and gripping him by the upper arms, his blue eyes wide with concern.
It is in the midst of these dark thoughts that Sherlock succumbs to his exhaustion, falling asleep with his knees pulled up against his chest, hands still clenched between his knees.
“Yes, my love, yes. Let me hear you…”
Sherlock’s anxious train of thought is interrupted by the presence of someone’s hand cuffing him good-naturedly (and rather forcefully) on the shoulder.
How foolish, how foolish Sherlock was to think that John would rather not come see him if he could, that John would rather drink with this friends then come to Sherlock’s bed—Sherlock shivers even as he thinks the words, and falls, hard, into the chair beside his desk, legs as weak as water. He thinks of the sorrow so plain in John’s voice and feels the ache of his regret still sharp within him.
“He was on the last longboat to shore with me and John. Deverall tried to convince him to come in when we arrived but he said he had business he needed to attend to first. I heard him promise he’d be back though. And he doesn’t strike me as someone who wouldn’t keep his word.”
Sherlock is suddenly immensely grateful for John’s request. The longing in John’s eyes, in the pitch of his voice alone would be enough to make Sherlock want to touch himself, but to know that John wants this, John wants to
“I’ve come to discuss the behavior of one of your midshipman—Phillip Anderson is his name. It is my belief that he is ill-suited for duty and should be removed from his position at once.”
He looks down at John’s threadbare trousers, sees for the first time the seams that are evidence of where they’ve been mended over and over. He looks at John’s jacket, where it’s folded neatly at his feet, sees where the collar is ringed with salt stains and sweat, the material thin at the elbows, and remembers suddenly with what reverence John folded his scarf and waistcoat the night of the party, how he tried to set them so carefully on Sherlock’s desk, and something hot and painful fills Sherlock’s chest that feels an awful lot like shame.
He thinks of Burns handing him the paintbrush earlier today, realizes how much that gesture really meant, and his shame is suddenly so intense he fears that he will drown in it.
“If you value your life, I suggest you step away from John Watson.
He can’t bear it. He can’t go through this again.
“I wasn’t asleep when you came over.” John reaches his hand out to where Sherlock’s fingers are clenched in his lap, callused palm turned upwards. Tentatively, Sherlock slides his fingers into John’s. “I mean I was earlier, but when I heard your footsteps, I was just lying there, letting my thoughts take me where they might.”
“That's easy—a man that ill and that badly wounded wouldn't have chosen to stay at sea for so long if he had a family at home.”
be completed before you will be allowed to leave the ship. There will be
“I don’t—it wasn’t—”
It’s finally enough friction.
Something about the phrasing of John’s words makes a dark shudder move through Sherlock.
“Don’t touch me, Sherlock!”
He can feel the soaked and filthy sheets beneath him, can see the faint beams of light filtering in through the cracks in the door from the passageway beyond, can feel the lank mass of his unkempt hair against his neck.
“My John.” Sherlock’s voice was low and breathless, deeper than it had any right to be; the feel of it against John’s skin went straight to his groin. “Do you know how beautiful you are?”
“Surely that’s… better than being married off to some brute?”
He hears John turn back around to face him, and at the soft intake of his breath, Sherlock cannot help himself—he finally opens his eyes to look.
The day is hot—it may be the hottest day they’ve seen so far—and when Sherlock emerges from the shadows into the sunlight of the ship’s waist, stepping into it its glare is like walking into an oven.
Sherlock pushed John gently until his back was against the bathroom counter and he was positioned directly in front of Sherlock. Then, dipping his fingers into the container, he began combing the hair back from John’s forehead with expert fingers.
“I tried to go back to sleep like you said but when I turned over—the pillow, it smelled like you and I…”
, Banana Bill looks up from the other end of the table to say, “My old mate Charlie was a foretopman on the
He feels John run his calloused palms up his sides, and the gesture makes a thrill of pleasure run through Sherlock, causing him to shift his hips infinitesimally forward.
John presses a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead before rising to his feet.
they won’t have a choice but to turn him in.
Sherlock keeps his voice low so that it will not be overheard. Lestrade and Deverall are walking just a few paces behind them.
John breaks away, breathing hard, Sherlock’s hands holding his hips.
All of his breath leaves him in relief at the sight of John’s sun-browned face beaming at him through the dimness of the corridor.
is a link if you missed the first one.
He should have realized that Deverall was going to come into this tavern based on the conversation he shared with Lieutenant Lestrade outside, but Sherlock had been hopeful that there was another place just around the corner, specifically for officers and higher-ranking members of the ship that the lieutenants would have gravitated towards.
John didn’t look up from his paper. “Shall I fetch your smelling salts, Lady Gwendolyn?”
He watches John’s eyes alight on what must be the emerging bruises left by Anderson’s fingers at his throat.
Sherlock, who had been sleeping soundly as evidenced by the gentle rise and fall of his back against John’s chest, made a small, barely distinguishable sound of displeasure when John rolled away.
He ignores the jolt that moves through his body in response to being so close to John. He can feel something in John’s body too, like a barely detectable hum of energy rising to the surface as Sherlock draws closer, like a flame bending in the air from a draft.
“There’s no point repeating it. Unpleasant things.” John ran a hand through his hair and was embarrassed to note that he was shaking, his body wracked with fine tremors. He didn’t want Sherlock to see him like this. He was ashamed by how much it was affecting him, by how much five minutes with a madman had made him come undone. John had always assumed he was made of stronger stuff. “I’m fine now. You don’t have to…” He stopped himself before he said ‘worry.’ Somehow, that didn’t seem like the right thing to say to Sherlock.
The only dent in Sherlock’s pleasure comes from the knowledge that two men down the line, on the other side of Ironsides Jake, looms the dark and unsettling presence of the scowling sailor with the bruise on his face, the one Sherlock is certain felt the effects of John’s fists the other night after talking about Sherlock.
“Mmm,” John hums his acknowledgment, reaching to brush the curls back off Sherlock’s forehead, his voice teasing. “But I was thinking the very same thing about you.”
John felt Sherlock’s fingers twitch on his arm. “I really wouldn’t if I were you.”
The rain had become a deluge, the drops hitting with such force they stung where they struck John’s skin. He was grateful for the sensation. It helped to numb him.
“Lovely evening!” John proclaimed, unable to help himself. “Did you come from the opera as well? What a production!”
Every creak of the ship around him, every footfall in the corridor outside transforms in his mind to someone bringing news of John, bringing word that the plan fell through, that Anderson found him and strung him up by his wrists, had him beaten until he lost consciousness.
Of course, he knows he must bear it; he
“I will, sir.”
“Where’s Jameson this morning?”
“The suspect lives here?”
Luck was with him.
John lets out a long, shuddery breath, his eyes returning to their hands. “I’m sorry for reacting like this. Please don’t take it the wrong way.” His eyes flicker back up to Sherlock’s, beseeching. “It was just… a lot to take after what I’ve been through. I didn’t know it would affect me so… I would have warned you had I known but… I didn’t realize.”
But they only laugh at him and then swim away. “Too late, Sherlock Holmes, too late, too late. You’ve lost your chance.”
Sherlock looks down at it in shock, realizing too late that he was so caught up in watching John that he neglected to hide himself sufficiently from view. “But I—”
Sherlock can’t actually imagine it. He never would have survived past the point of thinking John was dead.
“You’ve been acting strange recently. Something’s different. What’s the matter?”
Sherlock took it, and showed John how to walk through water.
“Jesus, you’re burning up.” The voice sharp suddenly with concern. “Jesus, Sherlock.”
“Feel better?”
“What? Finally getting what you want? Me knowing? What? What is it? Tell me, John! Tell me, otherwise, how do you expect me to understand?” He could hear the edge of sheer frustration in Sherlock’s voice. “You seemed to like the sex, so I really don’t see what the problem is!”
The pain in Sherlock’s chest is real; it’s difficult to breathe around it.
Sherlock hears laughter followed by the sounds of a brief scuffle.
Sherlock’s blush accordingly, deepens.
Billy nods. “That’s right.”
“We want tongue!”
Sherlock opens his eyes at this question because he can hear—underneath the bravado—what sounds like a trace of real sorrow in John’s voice.
“My god, Sherlock, I can’t—the way you look right now… I wish you could see yourself. It—”
Sherlock is so lost in his own musings that he almost walks directly into Colonel Jackson who is making his way down the corridor towards Sherlock.
Moriarty looked down at John. “Such a pity we have to cut this short. I had so many treats in store for you. Oh well. ” He reached down and took hold of John’s jaw, fingers tracing the cut on John’s cheek. “I think I made my
When John speaks again, his voice is so quiet Sherlock almost doesn’t hear him. “I see the way they treat you.”
John breaks off with a gasp as Sherlock’s finger finally locates the place he’s been searching for inside John, his head arching back in the sand, his knees coming up on either side of Sherlock, fingers tightening in Sherlock’s curls.
John watched his sinewy retreat, his weight back on his hands, his eyes on the lithe movement of Sherlock’s narrow hips until he disappeared into the darkness of the hallway, feeling slightly stunned.
Sherlock watches his mouth fall open in a soundless cry, the muscles in his abdomen flexing as he pushes up into Sherlock’s hand, hands reaching out blindly to clench in the sheets.
He dresses quickly and perfunctorily, sparing only the briefest of minutes to splash his face with water from his pewter basin. It’s so hot today, he will be sweating again in minutes he has no doubt; so a more thorough wash hardly seems necessary.
John pressed his chest closer against Sherlock’s hands with a gasp.
So the kennel master got to shoot him after all.
Even though he drops his voice, Sherlock can still make out his words.
His skin was burning up. He felt like he could still feel the heat of the flames, and he wondered wildly for a moment if he had a fever, but as he forced himself to lie still and take deep breaths, he realized the heat was all in his head.
Thanks for sticking with this story- I appreciate your support more than you know. You guys keep me going. <33
He opened his eyes.
“Break
do something about it. They’ve no right to be horrible to me.”
Sherlock’s eyes lifted to his and John tried to fill his gaze with gentleness.
“I better get back below,” she says with reluctance in her voice. “My aunt will be looking for me.”
He rises from the bed with a start. Maybe it’s not too late. Maybe Molly’s still in the hallway.
“I was wondering if you might consider doing a private concert for us in the Indies. What’s your final destination in the colonies? Bombay? In any case, it will be easy to arrange a visit. You must come stay with us at our estate in Calcutta. My wife would be happy to have you. Tell me, did you—?”
“Well, do consider my invitation. I’m going to be airing out those pistols up on deck just before luncheon if you care to join!”
He cannot stop vomiting, long after there is nothing left inside him to come up, he is still coughing, clinging to the edge of his bed, his cheeks running with sweat, throat burning with the taste of bile.
And that’s all he manages because Sherlock has found that particular spot again, and has begun massaging it lightly. It’s easy to reach with Sherlock’s long middle finger—and John’s hips buck in response, his mouth falling open in a silent exclamation of pleasure before a long moan slips out.
“Care for a go, lad? I’m going to be firing these off the back of the ship!”
As the song comes to a close, Sherlock leans over to John, eager to distract himself from the brooding sailor’s presence. “John. That last song—the one you sang before—what does it mean—‘bully in the alley’?”
With an incline of his head, Lestrade gestures for Sherlock to follow him.
He glances down at himself for a sign that any of it was real, as if his body would bear some mark to confirm that Sherlock’s hands, his mouth had been there. Certain details he remembers so vividly—Sherlock’s breath at his ear, his fingers holding John’s shoulders hard enough to bruise, the burning sand under him before Sherlock lifted him up.
“I wish I could go back in time and rip the throats out of everyone who’s ever said an unkind word to you, tear the eyes out of anyone who’s ever given you an unkind look…” John shakes his head, his gaze slipping away from Sherlock’s as he seems to look at something only he can see. “Fucking cowards the lot of them. Do you know why people have given you a hard time, Sherlock?”
When John speaks, his voice is cool as ice. “Say that again, Stevens.”
It’s difficult to feel anxious for very long, with his whole body singing from the taste, the feel of John; the sound of his gasps of pleasure still lingering in Sherlock’s ears.
They could steal a longboat—row to shore—climb up those dense mountains covered in greenery—escape into the jungle and never look back. But even thinking it, Sherlock knows how impossible it would be—even getting off the ship unnoticed would be more than they could manage.
Sherlock’s heart is pounding in his chest. His tongue feels dry, too thick for his mouth. He’s afraid to ask but too curious not to do so.
Sherlock shook his head, his eyes still on the glass in his hand. “It’s difficult for me—that. I never—” He drew a sharp breath. The sound of it hurt John’s lungs. “I never let myself. But I… I needed it. I needed that.”
“Don’t you dare.”
“Sherlock—”
“You know what I wanted,” he breathed into Sherlock’s neck, speeding up the movement of his hand on Sherlock’s cock, knowing that Sherlock needed it hard right now, needed it quick, however badly he wanted to slow it down and savor every moment of Sherlock trembling in his hand, completely exposed and at his mercy.
Sherlock feels John’s hands squeeze his shoulders hard to reassure him.
To Sherlock’s great relief, the members of John’s mess are now preoccupied with receiving their own rations and he has momentarily ceased to be the focus of their attention.
“In fact,” John breathed against the base of Sherlock’s spine, “I’m going to give you something even better.”
“Please, John—!”
“See you around, Mr. Holmes!”
Returning now to the reality of all these shouting, cheering people—so many eyes fixed on him—is overwhelming to say the least.
John licked dry lips. “What did you say to me just a moment ago?”
Sherlock turned his attention to John’s other nipple and John’s breath was one long hiss of pleasure as Sherlock sucked, his long fingers skimming the hem of John’s t-shirt, dragging it up to expose his belly to the warmth of the firelight.
John felt Sherlock tense at the name, and he dropped his hand lower, smoothing small circles into Sherlock’s lower back. Sherlock let his head rest against John’s shoulder.
“What will it take to
John could feel the presence of Sherlock’s body all around him, his arm still above John’s head in a possessive gesture, his lips on John’s throat. The smell of him—god, just the smell of him all around John would be enough to make him come.
John made a sound of protest as Sherlock twisted sideways, upsetting the perfection of his natural pillow.
“Do you know who it was meant for?”
His rage was quickly turning back to fear and he fought against it now as much as he struggled to free himself from Sherlock’s grasp. He had to get away before it swallowed him whole. He could feel it overtaking him. He couldn’t see; he couldn’t breathe. He needed to get away, he needed—
“No! It’s not going to end like this!” Sherlock’s voice was suddenly a snarl. “I won’t give him the satisfaction.”
John’s hand shifts from Sherlock’s lower back to reach between their bodies, and Sherlock jerks violently as he feels John’s fingers slide in against him.
Sherlock’s voice was muffled in the skin of John’s shoulder. “Is it always like this?”
Lestrade’s grimace confirms Sherlock’s suspicions about the man’s incompetence.
“Rest,” John says, stooping down to press a kiss to Sherlock’s brow. “We’ll talk when you’re well again.”
Sherlock shivers at John’s touch, curious. He stretches his thighs further apart to give John’s inquisitive finger more room, emboldened by the suggestion. He sits up slightly on his elbows to look at John.
“Oh Sherlock,” John says, his voice resonant with sorrow, and then John is reaching for him, his arm going around Sherlock’s shoulders, pulling Sherlock in against his side. “God, if there’s anyone who should be sorry it’s me.”
This encounter is by far the worse of the two.
Sherlock didn’t say anything. He was considering the best way to broach the subject.
, Sherlock thinks.
Sherlock pushed back against him and John felt his erection slipping down into the crease of Sherlock’s thighs.
“Oh, John…”
“Don’t forget what I told you, Johnny Boy.”
He can see the evidence of Lestrade’s relief in the relaxing line of his shoulders. “Good. I think it’s better for all of us if the whole matter is forgotten as quickly as possible. Let us not speak of it again.”
At the sight of him, Sherlock feels his stomach drop once more.
Sherlock does not see the captain, but he does catch sight of Lestrade standing briefly at the railing of the quarter deck and he does not look improved from what Sherlock saw this morning.
It occurs to Sherlock that perhaps the captain didn’t want to deal with the man’s lackey, perhaps he wanted to speak with the harbormaster directly, but that theory also doesn’t make sense. It isn’t that the captain saw who had been sent and decided to head for shore—he didn’t even look at the other man. His only interest in him was in his boat as a faster means of getting to shore.
The feeling of John’s chest against his is so good, so
Sherlock has never seen John look so angry; not even when he almost broke Stevens’ face that day after painting the deck.
“I don’t know,” John murmured, lowering Sherlock’s fingers to lean in and find his sugarcoated mouth. “That bathtub in there is almost large enough to be considered a body of water.”
“So you’re saying… it was the captain who poisoned Knott’s associate?”
His mouth traveled up and in towards the heat between Sherlock’s legs but he pulled back at the last second and moved his mouth to Sherlock’s other thigh.
Sherlock nods, breathless, before he remembers John can’t see him and then gasps, “On the stand beside the bed, there are matches.”
John’s knee is pressing hard into Sherlock’s inner thigh and Sherlock realizes if John’s knee just moved slightly further inward it would be rubbing against the part of Sherlock that currently needs the most attention.
John moved to pull Sherlock against his chest, but Sherlock held him at arm’s length, his hands tight on John’s shoulders, his expression intent.
It takes all his strength to hang on, and he holds so tightly, he imagines he will still be clinging to this piece of wood when the ship sinks, his rigid corpse still holding on, even in death.
“I’m a doctor, Sherlock. I’ll be fine. I know how to look after a strained shoulder and a few cuts and bruises.”
In the low lights of the theater, Sherlock’s face was half bathed in shadow, the normally sharp edges of his cheek and jaw-line softened by the gentle golden light, the glow drawing out the shine in his dark hair.
He opened his mouth to tell Sherlock but a long moan came out instead as Sherlock adjusted the angle, bending low over him again.
In which Sherlock gets a little drunk, and tries his hand at poetry.
Amidst the chaos of all this new construction are vendors selling their wares, soldiers patrolling the streets, clergymen standing together in conversation, aristocrats picking their way delicately around the piles of rubbish and stray dogs, their servants hurrying behind them, navigating the maze of beggars and street urchins, pigs and goats, and everywhere, people working who Sherlock realizes with a sudden sick shock are not servants at all, but slaves.
“People need to know,” Sherlock shouted again, springing to his feet. “JOHN WATSON SAVED ALL YOUR LIVES!”
He could feel that the fabric that was stretched taut against the head of his cock was already soaking wet.
He kept his fingers moving in slow circles through Sherlock’s hair, his lips soft against Sherlock’s part, murmuring meaningless soothing things, aware that the gesture was calming him as much as it was Sherlock. He felt fragile, tremulous, like a sheet of gold leaf that had been beaten too thin.
He's so aroused he finds the head already slick with moisture and the relief he feels at the touch of his own hot and fumbling fingers is enough to make him groan low and guttural, sending a shudder of pleasure through John that Sherlock actually
“This is nothing. You should have seen the bash she threw on New Year’s Eve. When I heard she was going under I knew we’d be in for a treat. Tilly knows how to pull out all the stops.”
“John…” he begins. His voice is the size of a dewdrop on a blade of grass.
Sherlock looks up at John through his lashes, a smirk pulling at the corner of his mouth.
Blood. There is blood on the pavement spreading too fast; blood in Sherlock’s hair, on his coat, his scarf, blood still flowing from his temples; blood on John’s knees as he reaches out to take Sherlock’s wrist, fighting against the arms of strangers to find a sign of life; and then the shock of disbelief at the stillness there—no pulse—and the silence in John’s mind is like a roar of sound.
In fact, looking around at the bustling deck, it appears that Sherlock is the only passenger still up above.
John looks at her, stunned.
Sherlock sighs, and then tilts his head, as he studies the young man before him.
Sherlock’s heart is pounding so hard in his throat he is certain it will burst.
“I can’t believe it. I really can’t believe it.”
He does not even know if it truly
Sherlock lets him take it, his heartbeat accelerating suddenly, as John raises his eyes to his, a question in them that Sherlock already knows the answer to even if he thinks, in the same instant, of a dozen reasons why they can’t.
He flashes her the ghost of a smile. “I’m fine. Just had a bit of a fever last night.”
“Is Mycroft your only brother?”
“Mmm, it’s a shame I don’t have access to more of you,” Sherlock said, his voice a low sigh of reluctance, as if he could read John’s thoughts, the hand not occupied with John’s cock reaching up to pluck longingly at the buttons on John’s waistcoat.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. His brother’s dramatics were apparently only increasing as he climbed his way up through the ranks of the government.
Sherlock smiles back every time, beaming with pride at John’s praise, but Sherlock knows there is a grave difference between knowing the words for things and knowing how to do what John does every day—how to manipulate such a complicated system of ropes and rigging to steer the massive wooden structure through the water. The more Sherlock learns about the intricate workings of the ship, the more impressed he is by John’s abilities until it feels as though Sherlock’s awe of John is as vast, as unending as the ocean they are sailing over.
Once again, Sherlock is overcome by the lengths John’s men are willing to go to bring him some measure of happiness. The fact that they are not only supportive of John breaking Anderson’s interdiction, but that they are offering to
At one point he sees them all looking over at him and he drops his own gaze to the floor, feeling incredibly self-conscious.
“Walk her round, me brave boys and roll down!”
Sherlock bit softly at the back of his neck and John arched back into him with a sigh.
“Fine. I’ll do whatever you want. Just let me get up.”
John is holding Sherlock lightly by the shoulders, studying his face.
He opens his mouth to tell John how sorry he is but before he can speak John has placed a finger on his lips.
“What do people usually say?”
Sherlock wonders if any members of John’s family are still alive. He knows his mother is no longer living but what about his father? His sisters? Brothers? How many siblings does John have? Sherlock wants to ask him, but he doesn’t know how to do so without sounding insensitive. Part of him wants to tell John about Redbeard, but he doesn’t know where to begin.
John hesitates and Sherlock is certain he knows what John is about to say; is certain John hesitates because he’s aware that Sherlock already knows.
Sherlock would fill his pockets during dinner, with Redbeard lying at his feet. Afterward, when the gentlemen had gone through to smoke, the ladies to their cards, Sherlock would drop from his chair and lie under the table with his head on Redbeard’s belly while the servants did the clearing up, feeding him scraps of bread and mutton that he had hoarded from his own plate. He would laugh when Redbeard’s warm rough tongue licked his face, and bury his face in Redbeard’s soft and pungent smelling fur until one of the servants discovered him there and dragged Sherlock out to box his ears, sending him back to the nursery to await his thrashing.
“I couldn’t believe it when they told me about the bed. I thought the fellow was having me on—but I figured it didn’t matter either way. All that mattered to me was that it was on this beach—and that it would provide us with some shelter for the night. I could hardly believe it when I saw it with my own eyes. Still can’t really believe it, to tell you the truth.”
idea; he did not properly think that through.
“There’s just one thing.”
“Good evening, gentlemen. I’m so sorry to disturb your revelry—only I was wondering if you knew where I might be able to find Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock begins pacing the narrow space.
“Y-yes, John,” Sherlock pants.
There were maybe half a dozen sailors present when Stevens dragged Sherlock out of his hiding place—how many of them would be willing to tell Anderson what they had seen? Or even if they don’t tell the midshipman directly, Sherlock knows sailors and their love of gossip—word will have gotten around the whole ship by now that Sherlock Holmes was caught creeping on the gun deck and was knocked around by Stevens like a mouse discovered by a cat.
John didn’t bother to turn on the lights in their suite. He slouched gratefully into one of the high-backed armchairs set up before the window and gazed out at the glittering expanse of the city stretched out beneath him.
It makes the same warm feeling from before flare to life again inside him. He drops his eyes, feeling suddenly self-conscious.
John’s hand strokes down Sherlock’s neck before coming to rest at the place where his neck meets his shoulder, his thumb brushing Sherlock’s collarbone.
It was only the matter of one shuffled slide forward before Sherlock had inserted himself between John’s spread knees.
He flashes Sherlock a nervous grin, and Sherlock does his best to look reassuringly back at him.
Sherlock has to bite his lip again to stop his cry of protest, but his disapproval is short-lived as John takes hold of Sherlock now with both hands, one hand grasping the root of his cock and stroking roughly, the palm of his other hand swirling over the leaking tip.
“My god, Sherlock—” John broke away to gasp into Sherlock’s mouth. He pushed his forehead in against Sherlock’s to study his face up close. He still had powdered sugar in his eyelashes.
While he’s grateful that she’s clearly an ally they can rely on if they need to in future, Sherlock is stricken with the realization that if she heard enough to know John was hiding under her bed, then she probably could hear
All at once, Sherlock is filled with the desire to make John see this, to convey in some way his sorrow that this happened, but also, to take away his suffering in any way he can.
“Did you see me win my bet?”
There is no response, only the sound of his heartbeat roaring in his ears.
Sherlock kissed him back, open-mouthed, licking the inside of John’s mouth for several long seconds before John broke away to keep speaking.
“I was also asked to stay below,” Burns chimes in from where’s seated at the table just behind them. “Are you implying that Deverall has it in for me too, Patterson?”
“He’s this way, in his cabin—”
John puts his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders, his eyes simmering with barely-suppressed excitement.
Sherlock lets his glance move over the deck in front of them and then, there—he spots it—a bucket of tar, left unattended.
But somehow, it does nothing to diminish the intensity of his arousal, and as soon as the voices pass, the sound of footfalls fading from the stairs, his fingers tighten on John’s arms, and like a statue returning to life, John moves again, his chest animated by the sudden exhalation of his breath, his palm circling once more over the head of Sherlock’s cock.
“He got… confused. He was hallucinating, trying to breathe underwater. I had to pull him out of the tub and get him dry. I stayed with him until the effects wore off. He’s all right now. Even if he feels like death today.” Sherlock rubs his face. “I can’t go back, Molly. I can’t do that to him again.”
His playing changes suddenly, shifts from the complicated finger-picking of a moment before to a simpler tune, and it’s clear from the movement that goes through the listening crowd that he is playing the prelude to some well-known song.
be tempted to make John come like this. It would be very good for John—of that much he is certain.
“So you can see there’s hardly anything useful there.”
Sherlock feels his heartbeat accelerate at the feeling of John’s palm sliding in against his, those calloused fingers entangling with his own.
“I can’t believe I get to see you like this. How lucky am I? How lucky how lucky…”
“If I am not making myself understood, I would be happy to flog each member of Mr. Baynes’ mess in turn, until you get the message.”
“Oh my god, your fingers feel so good.”
Sherlock regards him with interest.
“Naww, didn’t you hear? It’s Anderson in charge of Watson’s mess now. He made some kind of prohibition against ‘im—said if he caught the lad talking to any of the sailors they’d get the strap.”
Sherlock closes his hand around the neck of the broken violin, squeezes.
“I’m not sure yet as to the nature of the offense, so please don’t say anything to anyone. Our discretion is imperative at this point until we have more information.”
Everyone seems to be in too good of a mood to bother much with details.
“Fucking incredible.”
This, however, was one of those times when Sherlock knew the consequences were going to be bad. This time, he had a feeling he might be in over his head. And if he reflected seriously on what had happened, he would have to concede that it was mostly almost all his fault.
“On what?” asks Bailey, the young man who is just a few years older than Sherlock and has the unfortunate habit of always putting his foot in his mouth.
Sherlock’s hands slid down John’s arms to grasp him by the wrists, pinning his hands at his sides, his tongue pushing deep into John’s mouth to stroke his tongue with palpable force, establishing a rhythm that pulled noises out of the depths of John’s throat he hadn’t even known he was possible of making.
From up on deck, Sherlock hears the sound of the ship’s bell ringing out the hour.
The crease between Sherlock’s brows deepened, as if he was irritated that John would ask him a question he so clearly knew the answer to. “Of course not.”
Luckily it seems the food and alcohol have somewhat fortified him. He walks as quickly as he can across the tavern, dragging Molly by the hand one breathless step behind him, until he comes to a halt in front of Lieutenant Lestrade.
Sherlock has no idea how long they will spend in the South American port but he imagines it will be a day or two at least—enough time to reload supplies, and perhaps even trade some of the cargo onboard.
Sherlock doesn’t answer. Instead, he shuts his eyes, and lets himself drift happily, savoring the feeling of John bending over him, his small hand so warm on Sherlock’s forehead.
“Badly, Molly! Not well at all.”
"Soon."
Sherlock tries to answer, but he cannot breathe—he’s still falling downward into himself, into the choking black swamp of his own guilt.
“Spare me your excuses, Lieutenant. I don’t have to tell you that this is a shocking breach of etiquette. I expected better from you.”
“Oh, yes. Please. Sit.”
Half the fragments probably ended up on the floor of the coach and have long since been swept away, dissolved into meaningless pulp in the mud of that stinking harbor town.
And then Sherlock was on him like a hurricane, his hands clutching John’s face, kissing him with such force that John fell back a step in surprise.
He went into the kitchen to unpack his shopping bags and then strode into the living room. He stood in the center of the room for a moment waiting for his eyes to adjust to the darkness and made out a pair of long legs sticking out from under the desk between the windows.
John’s entire body felt like one long flame of wanting. He was so overcome he couldn’t answer. He licked his lips, raised his eyes to Sherlock’s.
Sherlock made a grating, desperate sound—clearly struggling with his desire and his fear that he was overwhelming John, his fingers sliding helplessly over the material of the couch, looking for something to grab onto, to keep himself from thrusting into John’s mouth.
“We’ve only just arrived. You might change your mind.”
She is small, delicate; her body looks so slender under John's strong arm. The sleeve of his shirt is rolled up to reveal the bronze skin of his forearm and Sherlock can see the muscles standing out in his arm, the fine hairs on it that are gold from the sun, even from where he stands.
“Are you sure?”
Billy’s expression sobers as Sherlock pushes open the door. “If I don’t make it back to the galley before the dinner rush, it might not be possible. But I’ll do my best.”
Sherlock thinks back to the feeling of the captain’s eyes, heavy and cold, on the back of his neck the morning after the party when he’d gone up to try and speak with the Lieutenant. There was no mistake, he had been looking
“Oh god, oh Sherlock…”
He remembered that there were helicopters and police boats and a rope ladder that he somehow made it up or down (he couldn’t remember which), and he remembered sitting in the back of an ambulance, a woman with a gentle face shining a flashlight in his eyes, checking his nose and throat for permanent damage, giving him oxygen. They tried to make Sherlock undergo the same run of tests but he wouldn’t sit still long enough for them to perform any of them; he was too busy shouting at Lestrade.
him how—
“That’s not what people usually say.”
The doctor’s eyes were cold. “As I said before, he was resistant to the first dose. We had no choice but to administer a second.”
John shook his head against Sherlock’s. His whole body
Thank you for reading!
But it seems once Sherlock has shared his first dark, troubling preoccupation, he cannot stop himself from telling John the rest.
Deverall nods then, his irritation visibly lessening as the courier takes the letter from Sherlock.
Sherlock took a bite of toast, his expression impassive.
There is so much meaning in the life of a sailor that Sherlock doesn’t understand.
His reaction is so visceral he does not stop to think.
“Thought I saw somebody at the bottom of the stairs.”
Of course, Sherlock knows they cannot really be the same woods, that the Holmes estate is nowhere near the sea, but Sherlock does not question it as he strides forward into the trees.
“It was my pleasure. All of it. Especially that last bit.”
Getting dressed is a painful endeavor.
“No—I just love it.”
The soothing murmur of John’s voice is like a balm to the aches of Sherlock’s misery. He wishes John would just go on talking all night—about anything—about halyards and jibsheets, bowlines and topgallant studding—things Sherlock doesn’t understand but that are made all the more interesting in the warm embrace of John’s sturdy voice.
“You’re all right,” Sherlock gasped, his mouth still trembling when he pressed it to John’s ear.
The three musicians look up at Sherlock expectantly. He bows his head. “I… I’d love to play with you. If you’ll have me.”
Sherlock does not know which of them moves first—it seems to be a mutual effort, an eerily synchronized coming together, both of them surging forward until their hands find some part of the other to grasp, their mouths meeting almost seamlessly, Sherlock bending his body down to bring himself closer to John, one of John’s hands still on his shoulder, the other sliding in around his waist, fingers fisting in the material of Sherlock’s waistcoat.
“I’m very well now, thank you,” he says happily into the side of John’s neck. “Thanks to you.”
“No,” John growls, smiling as he captures Sherlock’s mouth with his.
“Sherlock,” Sherlock mumbles, careful to keep his eyes on the frayed tangle of cords between his fingers.
“Alright,” Sherlock replies, his voice just barely above a whisper.
Sherlock shuts his eyes.
John fell back against the pillows with an arm thrown over his face, trying not to dissolve into hysterical giggles at the sight of Sherlock’s stricken face.
He stepped aside to let Sherlock stride past him as soon as he opened the door, in an attempt to avoid the inevitable door-slam, but Sherlock whirled around behind him to grab the knob, and slammed it with such force that John saw dust shake loose from the ceiling as it crashed closed.
John still won’t meet his gaze. Sherlock can see the water beaded on the lashes of his downcast eyes; Sherlock wants to kiss them dry.
Sherlock is almost afraid to say yes.
“Would you like to choose the next song, lad? Anything you like—you start and we’ll follow.”
“Apparently, he was involved in some kind of brawl down below. He’d taken a swing at a fellow crewmate, and his opponent must have given as good as he got, for this man’s face was positively covered in blood.”
John’s sigh of dismay sounds genuine, the hand holding Sherlock’s moving to grasp him around the waist.
Sherlock is flushed suddenly with a burst of rare confidence prompted by John’s last remark.
Sherlock waits until Deverall has had sufficient time to descend the ladder to the boat below, and then, with one last longing look at the forehatch, that fails to produce John through Sherlock’s sheer force of will, Sherlock relents and climbs over the side of the ship.
John gestured toward Sherlock’s coat pocket. “You off to St. Bart’s then?”
Here is someone who’s worked his way up from little-to-nothing, has been relatively successful so far in doing so, and then for whatever reason, his law firm decides to send him to the Far East. It could well be, as Ferguson insists, that they believe he is the right man for a difficult job, but it may also be, that, similar to Sherlock’s own reason for being here, they simply wanted to be rid of him.
John was on his third popsicle when he heard the sound of footsteps in the hall and saw Sherlock's silhouette appear in the doorway.
Somehow, Sherlock survives the long, slow crawl of hours until the evening meal.
There is a chance he may have overdone it this time.
“Coming!” He went down the stairs, nervously flattening his hair as he went. He’d never felt comfortable in formal wear and the rented tux was probably the fanciest thing he’d ever worn. But Sherlock had insisted that they look the part, and as he’d said, Tilly Briggs was a fan of ostentation. In order to not be conspicuous it was imperative that they blend in.
There was a moment of silence and John felt the cold air from the window bring with it a spray of rain. He had started to shake again, minutely.
His body craves contact with every piece of John that he can reach and the sensation of finally being near to him again, of finally having John under his hands—it makes him dizzy and maybe he lurches just a little bit to the side because John is breaking their kiss, his hands coming up again to grip Sherlock by the shoulders, pressing his forehead in against Sherlock’s chin as he struggles to draw deep breaths.
“Harder,” he gasped, and then Sherlock was reaching down to drag his leg up over Sherlock’s shoulder, changing the angle again, fucking him deeper than John would have thought possible.
Billy has already stooped to pick up his buckets again. “Sorry, sir—I’ve got to get these to Miss Sommerset otherwise she’ll be havin a right fit.”
He’s so happy to be playing again that he feels none of the anxiety that he felt the last time—and maybe it’s the alcohol in his blood calming his nerves, or maybe it’s the fact that he’s done this before, he knows these musicians, this crowd of cheering sailors gathered around—but whatever the reason, Sherlock feels almost immediately that same transcendent feeling overtake him—that warm, vibrant sensation in his chest quickening and spreading down through his limbs into the tips of his fingers until he feels that there’s no separation between him and his instrument, between himself and the music that’s pouring out of him.
“Why are you always so sad?”
“Yes, my love?”
But whether or not it is, Sherlock will take John’s voice any day over that of his smug and domineering older brother. If only Sherlock could hear nothing but John’s voice in his head and banish Mycroft’s forever, what a miracle that would be.
“What is that… the writing?” Lestrade pointed to the forehead of the dark-haired corpse. “It’s German, I know. But what does it mean?”
“Do you carry that with you all the time?”
Sherlock watches him for several moments, unable to believe the man is actually doing what he’s doing—it’s so unbelievably bald-faced and stupid. But the longer Sherlock watches, the more obvious it becomes that he’s doing
He glances down with an almost self-conscious smile.
He refrains. Instead, he picks up the buckets and hands them to Billy, offering him what might be the first genuine smile he’s managed in days.
Sherlock ignores the question, rises to his feet.
Sherlock looks up at the note of urgency in John’s voice, and sees John looking at him with deadly seriousness.
John looks down at their hands as though considering.
“Don’t… whatever it is you’re doing—don’t stop,” John slurs, his voice thick with pleasure, his grip on Sherlock’s arms slackening momentarily as Sherlock readjusts his grip.
“Well, since you asked so nicely…”
“Now.” His voice sounded raw. Sherlock pulled his fingers out. “Jesus, Sherlock—
In which the main brace continues to be spliced; Molly Hooper has her moment, and Sherlock is an extremely aroused and belligerently drunk gay baby.
At first, John could see nothing but the grey outlines of shuttered windows in the room within, the darkness too penetrating to provide him with any hint of what the room contained, but as he took a step forward into the dim interior, his senses were assaulted in a different fashion altogether by a rank familiar smell.
“He wanted to know the name of the sailor I was trying to protect.”
There was cold sweat on his forehead, and for a moment, he wondered why Sherlock hadn’t come running at his shouts, but then he remembered. Sherlock was probably still at St. Bart’s.
He let his palms stroke down Sherlock’s torso to his hips, feeling the curve of each rib under his fingertips as his hands slid down. He pressed a kiss to the flushed skin of Sherlock’s neck, keeping his lips there as he spoke. “I do have other plans.”
Looking at John like this, feeling him now, under his hand, Sherlock can hear the movement that he wrote for John as clearly as though he were playing it—but there is a new addition, a complicated sequence of notes that burns through Sherlock like a light.
Sherlock stands aside to let the boy into his room but Billy shakes his head.
John’s hands were starting to feel the bite of the wind. He tucked them in under his armpits as he waited for Sherlock to explain.
The men are so tired they scarcely respond. Most of them have already begun moving toward the hatch with the kind of numb weariness that only comes from the most intense physical labor.
John tastes like sweat and darkness—fury and pain.
John pulls Sherlock down against his side, and Sherlock can’t help but gasp as his hips settle in against John’s thigh. His cock is still achingly hard and even that brush of contact is enough to make his whole body stiffen in response.
“At least I know I can count on you, Marcus, even if I can’t trust this lot. Keep an eye on your old friend for me—make sure he doesn’t get into too much trouble, eh?”
John tilted Sherlock’s face to get at a bit of blood that had smeared along the plane of his cheek.
Even if he wished to conduct an exchange of goods without the harbormaster’s knowledge—perhaps with some smuggling contact on shore—why would he leave the ship before any of the unloading had even begun? If there were some kind of contraband cargo that he wanted to sell, surely he would want to stay with the ship to ensure its safe delivery?
and watch you suffering because you need time to work up to turning me down?"
John smiles, separating the remaining slices and handing half to Sherlock.
It isn’t so much the sting of his cut lip, or the ache of his bruised ribs that makes him upset, but the shame that a greasy, weasely good-for-nothing of a man like Anderson can bring him to his knees in a fight.
John pulls away after another minute or so, settling his forehead against Sherlock’s just like Sherlock did. His voice is low and heavy, his hand warm on Sherlock’s jaw line. “Do you know which part of you I missed the most?”
The first-aid kit was still beside the sink where they had left it, and John wondered fleetingly with another inappropriate burst of humor that he managed to suppress just how many times they had stitched themselves back together with this kit, and then wondered, just as suddenly, with a flip-flopping sensation in his stomach, how many more times they would use it in future.
Sherlock thinks, as John’s tongue comes forward to meet his own, John’s hands sliding from his hair to cup his face.
Over the sound of the boatswain’s orders, Sherlock can hear an argument taking place up on the quarterdeck.
“Get off me!” He was one second away from flipping the person over his shoulder. Whoever it was must have sensed his desperation because they let go of his arm.
“Yes, yes, more than all right,” Sherlock gasps, clutching in desperation at John’s sleeves to tug John back against him.
. Midshipmen shouldn’t be flogged for showing up late to their shift. Or even if they are, it’s six strokes not—”
John seized the opportunity to pull Sherlock down against him, and then locking his legs around Sherlock’s back, he flipped their positions and rolled off of Sherlock. He crawled several paces away and rose to his knees, where he looked at Sherlock with a challenge in his eyes.
“More John, more!” Sherlock rocked his hips and John hissed as the movement pulled his finger deeper.
Burns thrusts a paintbrush into Sherlock’s hand.
“John!” he gasps, pausing briefly in his strokes. “You—you can hold onto me if you like… where you did before.”
The chiming of the bells brings reality into focus around them again, and Sherlock is suddenly very conscious of the fact that he’s standing with his trousers unfastened, his half-hard cock hidden between them, in an alleyway off of a busy thoroughfare thronged with people.
Of course, it had crossed his mind that John might be just the candidate for this sort of road test, but he hadn’t actually
Stevens’ eyes flicker back and forth between Sherlock’s own before crawling down the length of his body in a decidedly proprietary way.
John felt the hard, tight feeling in his stomach unclench slightly as Sherlock burrowed deeper into his side. He sighed and John felt his eyelashes flutter against his throat as Sherlock shut his eyes.
Sherlock settled himself behind John, keeping just enough distance between them that he could easily reach John’s hair, but not so close that he was actually touching. John was grateful for the chance to try and get his body under control.
he can make out the mischievous lilt in John’s voice—can almost see the quirk of his mouth as he smiles, when he sings about courting every girl—and Sherlock’s heart drops into his knees at the promise in John’s voice, the sheer bravado.
Sherlock was silent as he considered carefully how best to convey this information.
Deverall bows his head in acknowledgment, lingering just a moment, an uncertain look on his face, before turning away without saying anything more, Dimmock following in his wake.
John threw his head back with a shout as he felt Sherlock’s cock brush his prostate.
There was no cut on John’s face this morning when he left Sherlock’s room.
John’s chest is heaving from the exercise, his cheeks flushed dark with color.
But as much as John infuses the song with playfulness and levity, there is an equal amount of melancholy—no, Sherlock corrects himself. It isn’t simply melancholy. It’s that quality that John has, that sincerity, that depth of feeling in his eyes, in his voice, that radiates from his whole being when he tells Sherlock that he loves him, that he will do anything to keep him safe.
He dreams of the safe house where he stayed outside St. Petersburg, except it's all wrong. Instead of a dilapidated house at the end of a row of dingy flats, it's a cottage on a beach. The walls are white washed stone, the roof—grey slate. All around it is a sea of waving grass, as high as Sherlock's waist, higher in some places where the dunes swell upwards.
Sherlock turned into his embrace, face still burrowing into the skin of John’s neck.
“Smell,” he says, and Sherlock does, closing his eyes and inhaling deeply.
Sherlock tightens his grip on John’s hands. “I know,” he says, leaning in. “I know it’s dangerous but whatever the captain is plotting is likely more dangerous. All of our lives could very well already be at stake.”
Sherlock hissed at the touch of his hands, and gaining confidence, John’s fingers settled on the zipper of Sherlock’s trousers and pulled.
There’s a shout near the main gangway and John’s eyes dart toward the sound.
“What?” Sherlock asks through numb lips, still too frightened by his outburst to really focus on what John is saying.
