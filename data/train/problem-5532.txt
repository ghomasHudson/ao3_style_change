For once she didn’t complain, enjoying the quick and silent ride. She thanked him when he pulled up to stop, getting up and staring in awe at the Stark Tower.
“Hey Joey, you with us?” the God asked with an incredibly sexy Australian accent.
Steve sent a thank you to whoever was listening before telling Tony’s loved ones the good news. And as Steve sat with Harley in his arms, watching Howard and Maria walk away to meet their grandpup, the Alpha took that opportunity to update his brother and parents on all the good news.
“And if you want to keep seeing them I suggest you go to sleep with me.” Tony huffed in response, probably pouting but Steve couldn’t see his beautiful face.
Steve didn’t have to wait long for her to fall asleep, paying attention to her slow even breaths. When he was sure she was asleep and safe in his arms, he allowed himself to drift as well.
And he was kind and forgiving and didn’t run away when he saw Tony had a six year old with him. Or when he apparently understood French and heard Rhodey making fun of Tony for talking about the Alpha’s cock size.
“Two times, and this isn’t a normal party. This is a Stark Party. Shit gets cray and I don’t trust the cheerleading horde not to date rape you.” The blonde had a horrified look on his face. “I’m kidding...mostly. But just to be safe do you think you should be DD?” he tried, smiling at his oldest friend who saw right through his act.
Tony pulled away first, smiling at the blonde before resting his head on his shoulder. Steve smiled as he hugged his husband – who he realized must be on his tippy toes to rest up there. He squatted a little to put his hands on the back of Tony’s upper thighs, gripping his ass as he quickly pulled him up off the ground.
“I took maybe fifteen minutes.”
His big arms wrapped around her, making her feel safe and loved as she drifted off to sleep.
“No, not them. I lo-like. I like them. I mean before them,” Leo said with an adorable blush.
“Yeah, I wanted to apologize about that.” Tony would blame it on the soap, but he slipped into the sink from that statement. Which his husband wisely kept silent about, though a smile was apparent on his face. “I was actually upset that Bucky has started ditching his kid. I took it out on you and I’m sorry about that. In a lifetime, fifteen minutes isn’t that big of a deal.”
Sometimes, when she was having trouble falling asleep, she’d imagined what it would be like to have Clint as her other parent. She’d picture Clint and her father together and the three of them being a family. Sometimes she’d even find herself waking up with a smile.
Which in this case…might be the worst thing she could’ve possibly done. Like, he’d probably prefer her shoplifting or something.
“The worst of them,” Steve confirmed aloud, smiling when she gave a small smile in return. “Just, promise me Joey. Especially right now, you’ll lie under the radar and you know…behave?” he added with a wink to soften it. It seemed to work, as the teen rolled her eyes fondly at the man.
“Oh, what an interesting turn of events,” Steve said with a smile as he looked thru his mom’s old recipe book.
Needless to say, the other players groaned but let them be, just walking around the two as they made their exit.
"Wait, Emerson can I ask you something?" She turned around with a smile as she waited for Miles to ask.
“She said they’re staying with us for a few days to help with Peter! And Nanny said he’d teach me how to make his chocolate chip cookies while they’re here!”
Tony kept the squeal to himself but did do a little dance, she can’t see him over the ancient phone.
“How did you even hear about that Jo?” Tony asked, still amazed.
“Stevie, this is Tony
"They'll be in Brazil for a week, then they have a whole adventure day planned with you when they get back. The new wolf cubs at the zoo should be out for you to see." She smiled and settled against him, so incredibly happy with her family.
That afternoon the small family of four had lunch together to sign all the necessary documents, Emerson glad for the moment with just them. She was a little quieter than normal, smiling as her new family shared various laughable stories amongst each other. Maybe she did deserve some of this, she thought to herself smiling. After everything was signed and a courier was sent to take care of the rest, the family started decorating for the dinner that evening.
“Unca T’or too loud!” the toddler cried, covering his ears with his hands.
Peter’s mind slammed back to the present when he was jostled on the couch, a solid body colliding with his to sit next to him.
Now she wishes she had joined him for the distraction.
“And...the pup?” he asked even though Howard had explained to him the chances of the premature pup surviving. Tony was only about seven and a half months along.
“The best,” Peter agreed, both seeing a smile spread across Steve’s handsome face.
“I kind of love these,” Tony said with a smile.
“Yes...I’m still not getting your point?”
to this Captain?” the older Omega hissed at him, catching Tony off guard.
“Uh yeah, sounds like fun. I’ll have to rock paper scissors with Bucky to see who’s DD,” he said with a laugh, glad to see a smile from Tony as well. “I’ll see you tonight,” Steve said with a smile.
EMERSON
“I’m sorry Joey, please continue. We both lost Buck…” he said fondly.
"You will not murder me -"
“Hey,” the blonde said back.
“Come back to me in one piece,” Tony growled at his husband before Steve nodded back at him with a smile before following the others.
"Yeah! I still have it," Miles responded with a smile.
“What?” Tony snapped, putting a smile on Steve’s face at his husband’s aversion to the vegetable. “You’ve been drugging me and putting kale in my food?!”
“Daddy!” Peter cried as he calmed down enough to gently crawl up to kiss and smother the man’s face.
“Ei sunt familia mea,” she said back, snuggling into her father’s side and enjoying the moment of peace before Morgan woke up screaming. {
“I don’t know!” the five year old sighed in exasperation.
She knows better than to turn around, but does so anyway and isn’t surprised to find her arch nemesis walking towards her.
He made Steve promise to give him and Jo some privacy when she got home from school the next day. The blonde didn’t like the idea, but relented in favor of going to the gym floor with Sam to distract himself.
“I think it has to be funny, to be considered a joke,” Sam offered as he finally stood up and stretched to go home.
"Alright, well as always Thor we love when you stop by unexpected," Steve said sarcastically as he stood to wish them farewell.
“Miles, I won’t tell dads...but I don’t think I can train you.”
“GIVE LITTLE GIRL HEAD START,” Hulk rumbled, huffing at Steve in retaliation.
“Yeah, just needed some fresh air.”
“What’s with all the questions? Huh? What, me and your Uncle Steve aren’t enough for ya?” he teased as he continued his assault. She squealed in laughter and continued trying to get away from his torturous hands.
They had several hours to kill; and since it seemed like neither could sleep anyway, might as well reminisce about their Bucky.
“Tony?” he asked again as he walked towards the sound of his voice, still unable to see him. The brunette wheeled out from under one of his many old cars, smiling at the blonde while covered in motor oil.
“Don’t you dare text her,” he said as brought the pair of earrings she picked out to the register.
The zen-like state stayed even as the Alpha's furious scent filled the room, Ty posturing and reposturing as if his tiny mind was trying to calculate a rebuttal.
EMERSON
Wade suggested taking Emerson out for the time being to get to know his sister better, knowing they’ve only spoken a few times.
“Wow. You’ve really matured Buck. It’s kind of weirding me out,” Steve teased, laughing when his best friend playfully shoved him.
“Suzanne!” Bucky exclaimed, setting the toddler on the ground and stomping to the little girl. Clint selfishly wondered if there was any cake left when the little boy crawled over before grabbing the blonde’s leg.
“Right,” Clint nodded in agreement, shutting his eyes tightly closed as he heard James shift in front of him.
Clint was...fuck...Clint was
“Drop me off? Why can’t you guys just wait outside for me?” he asked as Tony helped Joey to her feet, leaving the bottle on the ground and walking her back to the car.
And vowed not to tell her dads about seeing Carolyn…just yet.
“But, Steve would let me meet my father. Right Steve?” Harley asked, turning to the Alpha who looked absolutely heartbroken but put on a smile regardless.
“Okay, well. What about beating me with your belt?” the expression morphed from scared to sad as he replied, “no, I would never-“
“Wait...you’re serious?” Nat asked, coming over to lean over the couch near Sam while nursing her beer.
“I thought for a second maybe you…” she trailed off, looking down as he pulled her into his embrace.
"Every damn cabinet."
“He’s going easy on you, he’s keeps giving me the plus fours,” Sam said bitterly.
And it was. Her jaw started to ache with how much she tried to shove in her mouth at once. They laughed and passed snacks around until they heard a familiar truck pull up.
“Seriously?” Joey asked the brunette before turning to the blonde. “Control your husband!”
Her door was open, which had Bucky momentarily freeze before pulling his gun out of his pocket, raising it up and slowly entering the apartment. It looked like there had been a struggle with the broken glass and strewn furniture but he started to wonder how much of this was staged.
“Woah,” she said with her hands out, smiling when he came to a gentle stop. “We can play if you want but we gotta go to the gym floor. It’s okay to break things down there.” The green giant actually pouted in response.
"House arrest would mean he would stay back in your house. This is, actually the opposite of house arrest," Emerson spoke up as she continued flexing her hands in her lap, ignoring her darker haired father's poke to get her to stop. The super soldier noted the god of mischief had trouble holding his laugh at his daughter's point.
“Em?” he asked quietly, waiting for her to turn her attention fully to him.
“Which is part of my point!” his husband interrupted. “I’m old!”
“Pan. As in pansexual. As in I’m attracted to people for who they are, not what parts they have.” Peter was still speechless and couldn’t control his mouth gaping like a fish out of water.
“He made me promise him,” he said reluctantly, smiling when his girl just laughed at that.
“Well,” the man choked out, “guess I’m glad I put you in time-out…” Steve laughed loudly at that, only able to agree.
something new with people she trusted?
“Thank you for doing this,” he said instead of an apology, because the Winter Soldier was a coward at heart.
“Steve,” Tony began, unsure of what was happening but noticing his husband’s anger.
She waited a beat before answering, “I told you guys I didn’t want to talk about her, it feels like you guys don’t listen and just keep…poking into my past. I want to forget it, all of it. I don’t know why you guys find it amusing to continuously bring it up.”
“Yup. Drink and drive and I’ll tan your behind as well.” Tony jabbed the man with his elbow, because
“Apparently I’m one fertile motherfucker,” Tony said as he plopped down on a chair near Bruce’s work table.
“And…” she tried, finding it difficult to answer questions when her
Which were barely holding up the ceiling.
"Yes," Shuri responded with a small smile and shrug. "I couldn't say anything at your party because of our age difference," continuing when Emerson raised a brow in question. "When we met, you were fifteen and I was eighteen. It is not appropriate in either of our cultures for an "adult" to date a "child"," air quoting the words to emphasize the technicalities.
“Yeah well, they’d tease whether I took your name or not, I just didn’t…” she trailed off, deciding she should finally tell him the truth. “I already told you when I was drugged up that it wasn’t cause of my Dad. It was…it was once again about Steve,” she said with a smile. He laughed fondly at that, sitting closer to her to listen.
“Yes clothes! Unless you just want to stay here…”
She was so excited that her dads had decided to adopt Miles. They were going to skip past fostering and straight up adopt her little brother! She remembers sitting in when her parents told her older brother, who only congratulated them.
“I’ll count you guys down!” Peter offered as Daci stretched her limbs out. Hulk was practically bouncing in excitement, but had a smirk on his face.
"No I meant like, cause of the serum." Steve suddenly turned to face him directly.
“Look Pete,” Steve began, “like I said before, there really isn’t anything we can do right now. But your father and I can talk more about it if it’ll make you feel better, okay?” He walked over to his son, placing a kiss on his temple, surprised by the quick hug his sixteen year old caught him in. “You’re doing a lot just by being her friend Peter,” his Dad added, “like your Pop said, we’ll talk more about it and keep an eye on her, okay?” Peter nodded, letting his Pops go and giving them both a small smile.
“He seemed sad this morning.”
fate.
“Where’s Joey?” he asked.
She couldn’t care less how the new high school was, as long as no one went digging up her past.
part of this family.
“No, but like, one thing that she does that makes you mad? Like, when Steve leaves me at four in the morning to run, taking away my heat source like a selfish jerk. Can you say one bad thing about Vivienne?”
Daci didn’t hear the rest, quickly making her way to the elevator with Wolf in tow. The knots in her stomach tightened - now with anger instead of guilt - as she hugged Wolf close, getting off the elevator on Clint’s floor and hoping the archer won’t mind her company.
After he kissed his boy several times goodnight, he smiled as Steve carried their son to bed while the genius stayed behind to do dishes. It didn’t bother him that Peter often asked for Steve to put him to bed, sometimes Tony slipped in to hear him read the stories the way he does.
And his beautiful, incredible husband nodded gleefully before reaching around for the covers frantically.
older brother, though Miles' cheeks were the only ones turning pink.
“You do?” she asked astonishingly after pulling away to look up at him.
“We want to know how to help you, Joey, because whatever you’re struggling with inside…we’re here for you,” he reiterated, gently squeezing her hip.
The genius still had heavy bedhead, dressed in his signature tank top and sweatpants and was glaring at the blonde as he approached him.
The blonde figured he’d held off as long as he could, gently grabbing the brunette by his hips and bringing him closer. When he was close enough, Steve moved his hands to gently grab the calloused yet still soft hands of his husband. Tony gave a squeeze of his own, looking into Steve’s eyes as a smile slowly spread across his face.
When she woke, the first thing she recognized was that she wasn’t in bed. She was sideways on the couch, head lying on a pillow on someone’s lap. Blinking eyes helped her recognize Steve’s legs, the blonde moving his hand to card through her hair after she made her consciousness known.
“Oh, that’s...cool Pete. What about you Daci?”
“M-Mr. Stark…”
"Pete...did...did you just say your first word?" Tony asked in amazement, staring in disbelief at his youngest.
His Alpha was right, they should focus on the here and now. And the fact that they now had two pups. Two healthy, strong, loving and beautiful baby boys.
“Yes please,” Bucky answered for him, reaching both hands for the new cup with glee before taking a hefty gulp. “Oh, that is still taking some getting used to,” Bucky murmured as he clutched the mug with his metal hand.
Tony only chuckled some more, feeling a very excited super soldier press against him.
After a moment, he noticed her eyes widen in shock, frantically feeling around before looking terrified at the blonde.
Tony blinked back into consciousness, frowning when he saw he was alone. In a hospital bed.
“Woah, dude, just chill,” Clint said, helping him to a better sitting position. He heard footsteps approaching as his uncle said, “well well well, if it isn’t the red condom.” Peter looked up at that, seeing the masked man in red carrying his unconscious sister over to Clint.
, is another thing
“Alright, I’ll cover for you. Go get your pup.” Steve tried to smile at the words, but mostly he was insecure and too angry to cherish them. So he marched on, out to his car and maybe speeding a little for the ten minutes it normally took...maybe making it in six.
Emerson muttered under her breath and felt someone poke her in the back. "I mean, of course, sorry. Um, long flight."
It wasn’t that Pete didn’t want any more kids. He did. It just feels so soon after adopting the twins to adopt one like Leo.
is not crude but
“Yeah?” he asked playfully. “Well I’d rather have you hate me while you are safe and alive than ‘like’ me and die young…”
“Your boy will probably win homecoming king,” Nat said next to him, smoothing out her long skirt.
Wearing dark jeans and a tight shirt, he joined Bucky and Clint in the living room, where the pair gave him thumbs up in approval. Steve just rolled his eyes again.
"Good. Now come on, Jarvis' flight should land soon and I promised him we'd pick him up from the airport."
Except right now, when said brunette with a prosthetic arm was bugging him about joining them for drinks. Steve was perfectly content sitting on the couch snuggling up with Lucky, but apparently his brother had other ideas.
“I’ll be up whenever I finish,” the grumpy genius replied, not even looking up as Steve left the lab.
“Now, force yourself to lower your breath intake. Your body is going into “fight or flight” mode due to the buildup of carbon dioxide in your lungs. Breathe slowly in and out – excellent work Miss” he added bringing a small smile from the girl. She took deep exaggerated breaths after his next suggestion, unable to stop the continuation of tears.
“I’m sure he would be. Well, I’ll see you guys tomorrow morning. Bye kids,” Happy said as he opened the door after parking in front of the Tower. They raced again to the elevator and this time Daci let Peter win. Even though he was gloated about it on the way up.
The two got up to go reassure their kid.
“I just mean to say,” Bucky said loudly before the brothers could start bickering, “maybe since you’re home now you guys could start looking for a two bedroom apartment?”
, you could have them help you steal cookies!” Tony said in excitement as he walked to two over to the cookie jar.
Swat after swat of what she was starting to wonder if
He looked up, expecting Tony to maybe have changed his mind, only to see his daughter standing there with tears in her eyes. He quickly sat up and beckoned her over, catching her when she threw herself onto him.
“No I think I can handle-” Tony said before Wade interrupted with a loud and wet fart, laughing like a hyena. It prompted the genius to immediately hand the baby back to his laughing Papa, only frowning when he heard the rest of the room laugh as well.
Harley’s eyes were red from crying, bottom lip quivering as he curled in on himself.
“You’re not so bad yourself, hot stuff,” the genius replied, lazily watching his husband. The blonde had thrown the towel haphazardly and was currently raking the brunette’s body with his eyes. “Um, not sure I have any energy to go for round three…”
“Did you just come here to murder a baby?” James asked over the sounds of the baby’s laughter. Suzie giggled in the corner, reminding the blonde she was still here.
They moved to follow, but then a siren went off as the same time that their phones alerted them of an Avenger's emergency.
“What uh…what are you doing here?”
“Can you tell me more about your dad, if that’s okay I mean.”
He watched them watch him, sitting next to her and stealing a glance at Tony. The brunette brought his coffee to his lips as he watched Steve put the box on the table next to the donuts, both of them waiting for him to talk.
“I can only think of violent ways,” she said with a smile of her own.
He bent down and kissed his scar along his ribs – from a lab incident – taking his time before moving to the small tattoo on his hip bone.
Despite the circumstances, he found himself laughing a little. He would argue about driving, but he hadn’t slept well since they’d named a date for Rumlow’s trial. He knew Joey hadn’t slept great since
And Joey was stuck home alone because of it.
“You’re not an intruder, Jo…”
“Yesiphine?”
There weren’t any cars parked so he was most likely home alone.
"-Emerson, why would you think we would even keep you from
He held her on his lap after he moved to sit on the couch, opting to deal with all of this sitting down. It was like six in the morning…ungodly time to be awake and have to manage calming his hysterical husband down. They called her neurologist and left her a voicemail, then called the emergency nurse hotline to determine if they should take her to the hospital.
The warm feeling came back, so Steve stopped the two to pull his love in for a kiss before answering him.
She paused, thinking it over, “it probably wouldn’t hurt. Maybe even make it stop hurting.”
“Everything okay, honey? If this is about what that horrid woman said…you shouldn’t listen to her. She’s obviously miserable about her sad and pathetic life and absolutely full of it and one of those
“But you’ll still outlive me!”
The genius only rolled his eyes at his AI’s response, not worried about anything other than perfecting this idea of nano-technology. So far he’s been able to make a pulsar glove out of a wristwatch, which he considered a successful start.
“Are those…?” his handsome man stuttered out, a genuine look of surprise on his face. Steve easily smiled at the question, and how cute his face was.
“That’s it,” Dr. Carmichael reassured with a smile. “Bodies get used to medicines over time, we just have to up the dosage and you’ll be right as rain.” Tony turned to his husband who shared a look of relief with him.
“Do you have what Jose has?”
“Can we go?” he heard her ask quietly, he could feel her shaking as she inched closer to him, hands still clenched in his shirt.
He took the thermometer out when it beeped and checked - one o' two point one. Okay so sick but not hospital worthy. Whose he kidding, he'd just make Uncle Bruce come fix them if it got to that point. And depending on their behavior...he may keep that info in the back of his mind anyway.
“I didn’t use my powers,” she said in her defense, leaning against the man who already said it was fine. When an arm wrapped around her, a smile broke across her face. When she looked up and saw her Tati squinting at her Daddy, her smile got bigger.
“Well,” he heard his husband say, “did her forgiveness help?”
am not a bastard,” Helen said nonchalantly as Joey felt her brain short circuit.
“Nat I-”
Clint knew he liked dudes since he was nine, but he was in a different foster family than Barney at that time. And the memory wasn’t exactly a good one, when he had kissed a boy that walked him home and his foster father beat him with a belt for it.
CLINT
“Thanks May, you’re a lifesaver,” Steve said sincerely, laughing along with her when Peter started singing about cake.
,” Romanoff said softly, reaching her hand out for the child to take. Which she did, apprehensively and even going so far as to throw her father a dirty look before the two left the room. {
He made sure to etch the drool currently pooling on his brother's chest from his baby, smiling and wondering if he should also try to catch some z's before she woke up again. But drawing always put him in such a tranquil mood, he felt at peace as he sketched the duo. One hand was protectively placed on her back as Bucky's head shifted a little in his sleep, causing the younger man to momentarily pause in his drawing.
She was frustrated with herself.
"Also your sister's girlfriend," the brunette teased as Emerson turned to glare at her father.
“Hey Barney, so you’ll be taking Clint’s bed, yeah?” Barney stopped walking, looking skeptically back and forth between the two teens.
A week went by and she didn’t grow to like Vivienne any more. In fact...she was really starting to dislike her. Like when she spent the night with them. Daci had a nightmare and went to her father’s room, where Vivienne intercepted her and made her go back to her own bed. The woman had made sure she had Wolf and offered her a smile, but Daci felt something cold behind her eyes.
“Do you wanna try and catch me? I’m pretty fast,” she offered, feeling more confident around him. She had been lazing with the others watching movies all day - she could probably use this too.
“Pete you wanna put Simba back so you don’t lose him?” Tony suggested.
“Then tell me why you did it,” he snarled back at her. She swallowed thickly before breaking eye contact with him.
“It’s the same recipe, Buck. Except I also have whipped cream, marshmallows, and chocolate shavings.” He turned around when Bucky had the audacity to scoff at him. “What?”
He definitely could use the distraction.
“Are you sure this isn’t a bad time?” he asked just as the shorter teen began to panic.
"-I do!" Clint interrupted surprising himself. He had spent the last several Christmases with Nat after she hung out with her aunt and uncle. He couldn't remember the last time he'd been invited to actually celebrate the holiday.
"Still can't believe your ugly mug made something that cute," Steve teased as he saw Joey smile at him. He reached over to gently caress her cheek, smiling when she let out a sleepy giggle at that. Kept smiling as she reached her tiny hand out to grasp his finger.
“Ooh chocolate chip pancakes?!?” Tony exclaimed suddenly, peering around the super soldier to confirm his suspicions.
“Yeah, he’s a little older than Steve in this pic. I remember when he told us he was joining the army, we were so proud. Our oldest of three boys. The first time he came back from leave, he met Sarah. They were only nineteen but boy oh boy did my son ever fall head over heels for her. Told us after their first date he was going to marry her. Not sure where this is from, though. Where was this, Sarah?” Helen asked as she handed the other woman the photo.
“Oh, no you’re right,” she said, too pissed to stop herself. “The word ASS is wayyy worse than homophobia. My sincerest apologies,” she said with her normal teenage attitude currently in overdrive.
Fuck Steve was so damn handsome.
He could not believe his baby boy was going to prom. Wasn’t it just yesterday when they were teaching their Bambi how to ride a bike? When he would sneak into their bed late at night after having a nightmare? Insisting the two dress up for Halloween along with him? And now here Tony sat on the couch next to Emerson, watching Steve help Peter – who was mere inches shorter than the super soldier – with his bowtie.
“Well technically not that specific design,” Tony said with an adorable blush before rubbing the back of his neck. “You should call me sometime and I’ll upgrade you to the newest model,” the generous man said before reaching into his back pocket and pulling out a business card to hand to Bucky. It gave Steve the opportunity to check out the man’s delicious bubble butt.
Clint couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Bruce interested in anything other than a science book...and now he was blushing around the Greek-God foreign exchange student?
“Fuck you!”
She hadn’t even thought of that, she really hadn’t been thinking period. She saw her friend in trouble and acted. What if...what if they had to leave and she was the reason why?
“Emerson has a mild concussion and some lacerations on her legs, Peter – hasn’t sustained any injuries, mentally though – they
“Officer,” she tried to manage from the backseat. “I’m not drunk,” she slurred out, humphing in frustration at herself.
And facing his paternal demons.
Her soft brown eyes were washed in concern as Joey realized she was waiting for an answer, which meant she had asked her a question.
“Shit,” the brunette muttered as the sinking feeling of dread encompassed him.
“She’s a girl from my school,” Joey explained.
“I...I don’t know. But uh...my parents are still downstairs,” Steve growled out, glaring at the brunette as he gently shoved him off. Tony just laughed as he did, making sure the drawings didn’t get smushed under his weight.
“Jarvis? Isn’t that his old butler?” Steve asked curiously as he watched Rhodey start pacing back and forth.
“Daddy he hasn’t even seen Jurassic World!” Harley said, offense in his voice and a pout on his face.
“Hurry up Steve, you know she’s itching to start walking,” Bucky said as his baby babbled and tried again to crawl away from him. She was only in a diaper, since the nine and a half month old was going through a no-clothes phase. Since birth.
He had just finished deep cleaning –
“I love you too,” Clint purred as he climbed onto Bucky’s lap, straddling his hips and wrapping his arms around the brunette’s neck. Buck ran his hands up and down Clint’s back, settling down on his hips and bringing their bodies smashed against each other. The blonde’s arms moved until he was cupping Bucky’s face, leaning over to whisper “I’m going to take such good care of you.”
“You wanna know why?” Steve asked sharply, revealing to her he’d known about this all along.
“It’s good though, right? You know you can tell Tony if you need any updates,” Steve replied, smiling at both his friend's comfort and his husband's genius.
"Fuck, Clint," Bucky laughed out, not fully believing this was not some sort of dream.
“…what did your uncle tell you?” Joey’s own eyes narrowed at that question; Carolyn’s gaze not leaving hers as she continued.
"Open mine first, Joey!" Peter piped in while he helped his mom pass out party hats. Clint took over camera duties from Happy so he could help Pepper and Natasha with the food and candle placing.
“Yeah, he did,” she said in between chuckles. He rolled his eyes fondly, reconsidering how sneaky he thought he was at hiding it the first thirty years.
“Oh Steven, that was definitely not the case…” Tony purred as the two smiled warmly at each other. Steve opened his mouth to ask him out when they were interrupted by Tony’s son approaching them.
Tony looked at his mother, going back and forth in his head whether or not to lie to her, but ultimately knowing she’d pick up on his bullshit.
He looked at the set up tables before turning back to James, glad to finally see a smile on his handsome face.
No of course not, because Sunset demanded his attention as she began openly and disgustingly flirting with him.
“She’s definitely your kid,” Steve said with a chuckle as he rested his hands and the camera on his hips at the sight. When she made it to Steve, she looked happy again to see him. She threw her tiny hands up at him, making grabby hands as she whined to be picked up.
He pulled the finger out of his mouth with a ‘pop,’ smiling down at his handsome man.
“And, anyway, I heard the padres getting into a fight in the living room. So I immediately went back to bed and spent the night wondering if one of them is dying because I have attachment issues and an overactive imagination.”
“Okay, first of all you ridiculous child, Xavier loves you and has been texting me about all of this
“Lucky for you, you can’t make that stupid decision,” she heard Sam snap.
The rest of the day had been fun, he couldn't deny that. They met W'Kabi and even got to ride his rhinos, swam in the beautiful and clear waterfalls and were finishing their day by shopping in the city.
“You sure you don’t wanna meet her in your office? You know, home turf and all that.”
His incredibly lucky life he would be eternally grateful for.
“Jesus she looks like she’s in her 20s.”
“I knew it!” she cheered, immediately quieting when Steve flapped his arms in panic. “I freaking knew it,” she whispered in triumph – Steve unable to hide his smile in the shared excitement.
“I abandoned you? What, by not placidly agreeing to every opinion you have?”
“I thought you said ‘boyfren,’ Daddy?” he asked with a confused expression, getting a chuckle from the blonde.
Clint froze,
“Both Dads drank at my age,” she pointed out with a sly smile.
Steve felt his eyes get misty as he watched Tony grip the wheel.
“Shit, Tony I’m sorry I wasn’t trying to imply anything…”
“So,” Tony began quietly, not wanting to wake the now sleeping puppy. “Since when would Harley want to sit on your lap, Alpha?” The question got an adorable blush from the blonde, who squirmed a little in his seat.
"You do?" the boy's tiny voice asked as Emerson felt her Dad shift to grab Miles and pull him fully onto the genius' lap.
“Hey baby,” he said quietly. “Honey you are so strong and I’m so proud of you for what you did out there. I’m still furious at our son – a laughed slipped his lips – but we’re all safe and alive. I love you so much…come back to me, okay?” He closed his eyes as he brought his hand to his lips again to kiss some more.
When Joey was four and after their mother had passed, Steve temporarily moved in to Bucky’s two-bedroom apartment. He was still pretty devastated after losing Ma, not really leaving the couch he had crashed on.
“Absolutely honey, whatever you need. Do you uh…need anything for your back?”
And, as it turned out, Tony Stark was kind of a dork. He didn’t come across as the ‘spoiled brat’ Sam had painted him to be. He was even creative, like way more creative than Steve thought possible.
He was jealous to admit it, but they got along well together. Which could prove to be a terrible thing, knowing his Dad.
“That’s his name…I think…why? You getting a crush Petey?” she teased.
They sat huddled on the couch for…well Tony lost track of time. They held her as she cried and cried and cried. His husband was the first to speak.
"I'm happy you're happy, cub," he said to his girl before placing a kiss on her head. Clint did the same and Bucky still felt like he was dreaming, because how could he have predicted he'd get to have this? A click sound caught his attention as he turned as saw Natasha had taken a picture of the group, smiling at the redhead who nodded back before making her exit.
“Not okay,” Joey said, causing the parents to look back at her in confusion.
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Jo rambled as Xavier walked over to pinch her shoulder.
“Fuck you asshole! I can still hear you you know!”
“Night-night Peter! Love you!” the blonde said as he stood still and watched with a smile as his husband carried their son back to bed...also checking out his backside because he could.
brains? You really are too good to be true.”
saved
“You guys have a great relationship,” Bucky deadpanned.
“Don’t worry doll, you are the prettiest Omega in here,” Bucky said before planting a wet kiss on the blonde’s cheek.
“Must be why Harley loves them so much,” Clint teased, getting a laugh out of Daci. Especially since said child was mimicking the silly monkeys.
I can promise you.” She glared back at him for a moment before responding.
“Now, Miss Smith, I understand the desire behind living with rich superheroes,” began the DHS official, “but you must understand our hesitation given your…history with men.”
“Ladies,” Ms. Lang said seriously as they were passing her to get back to class, “next time let’s refrain from burning the freshman publically, shall we?” she said with a wink.
"So you came down here to warn me about double trouble and gawk at my ass?" he asked with a smile as he took a step closer to his husband. The shorter man had a wicked smile on his face that the blonde was tempted to kiss off, but thought of a better alternative. He leaned forward, smiling as his husband did the same, except he moved to kiss his forehead. The genius glared at him as the blonde walked backwards away from the man.
Currently, he could hear his parents arguing about whether or not his Dad was well enough to work in his lab. His sister was next to them loudly siding with their Pop.
“Baby, trust me, that is not what that man is after. He doesn’t want to kill me, he wants to control me. If you want to be worried about anything, worry about your Pop going to prison for assault. He’s going to beat his ass when he sees him…”
"Which. Is?" his Pop asked with some anger voice, making Peter gulp again before answering.
“I know,” she said, cutting him off from saying anything else. She reached one hand back, feeling around until she could grab one of Tony’s hands in additional comfort. She heard them both chuckle at her, and she could care less how childish and clingy she was being right now.
“Yes you do, doll. Will you please say it out loud though? For me?” James asked so sweetly, Clint decided to oblige him...but still snuggled up so his voice was muffled.
She hated seeing her brother like this. He didn’t leave his room for two days, barely dragging himself to school after their Uncle Thor had “insisted.” (
Tony had promised that if Sarah and Steve ever died in some freak accident, he would marry his Pop to comfort the man.
“Yes baby, Steve and I...we have some news for you. You know how Steve and I are bonded and he moved in with us? Well...it turns out that we’ll be adding more to our family…”
“You’re okay?” he asked, pulling his head up to look at the men. Tony found himself easily carding his fingers through the boy’s brown curls, smiling and nodding back at his son.
He placed his face in his hands, taking a few deep breaths.
“Now’s my chance,” Tony said getting off the couch, confusing Steve.
“Come on baby, we can’t start without you! You have the most important job as the ring bearer, remember?” Steve tried again.
“Baby, I don’t want to do this anymore than you do. But I love you, and I
After washing his hands he made his way back to the group, stopping at seeing Natasha with her arm around a short brunette. His friends appeared to be laughing at whatever the unknown man had said.
Before suddenly realizing what an absolute lie that was.
“Frances, she said they’d call her Frankie,” his uncle said with a smile.
“Depends on what you’re having,” she countered with a smile.
don't want a brainwashed assassin with more baggage than an airport then I understand..."
That sneaky son of a bitch he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with.
“Seriously? You just had to ruin it, didn’t you?” Steve added.
“It’s Pepper,” the blonde said walking the two in the direction of the closest guest room. “I wouldn’t be surprised if she put lube in there, knowing us. Oh that reminds me,” he walked back to the table. He then balanced Tony’s weight on one arm, squatting down to pick up his gym bag. The brunette wiggled his eyebrows at his love, laughing as they went to make up for lost time.
“Alright everyone, take it easy on Tony,” Bruce said next to Emerson. “He’s still recovering from a building falling on him. No need to point out he was saved by teenagers.” Everyone – even Emerson – was laughing at that.
“As I was saying, I expect you to behave yourself. You will be attending one of the greatest high schools New York has to offer. And I had better not get another complaint or I’ll send your ass to juvy, capish?” She gave him a fake smile, knowing he’d make her life and even deeper level of hell if she back-talked him again.
“Is this the fuckface??” she demanded as she walked past Tony to stand directly in front of the unsuspecting man. “You sick son of a bitch. How
EMERSON
Steve smiled at his old friend. “Thought you didn’t like the terrorist?” he said teasingly, moving to stand beside Sam as he plated the burgers, most had melting cheese.
“I haven’t missed any meds,” she said aloud, mostly to convince herself.
“Jarvis, is my hubby back from his run?”
“And you think your dad would’ve let today slide?” he asked. She shrunk in on herself, looking a lot younger than sixteen, eventually shaking her head ‘no’ in response. They sat in silence until Steve pulled up to their home.
“I can’t decide if you’re a knight in shining armor or an angel from heaven,” the brunette with a well cut goatee said as he stared dreamily at the blonde.
It had happened to Tony once before when he was eight, but he had to suffer coming back to himself on his own cause his father was in a different country on business. Only your Prime Alpha - who was either your father or your bondmate - could snap you out of the zombie-like trance it put you in.
"Were you just in your lab?"
“We’re trying to figure out which princess everyone will be,” Emerson said as she kept her focus on the tablet, Steve just now noticing she had a pen and paper pad in hand.
“You...we’re...holy shit Tony we’re soulmates?”
He and his sister ate their cereal in silence, still working on waking up and processing the last twenty-four hours. Two words were on loop in his head, now that he didn’t have his whole family to distract them. He wanted to ask Emerson about it, but wasn’t sure if it was even worth asking. He was probably just making all of it up in his head anyway.
Using his height to her advantage, she weaved throughout the course, laughing at his frustrated noises when she kept just out of reach.
, the rational side of her brain added,
“It’s alright Bambi, your heart is still recovering. We’ll give you some leeway for now,” his Dad said with a wink.
His father took a deep breath in and out before turning to fully address Tony.
She’d be lying if she said she wasn’t somewhat thankful. She wasn’t the reason her last family “didn’t work out.” She didn’t shove her tongue down her foster brother’s throat. But to be fair, she also hadn’t calmly defended herself when his biological mother – her new foster mother – confronted her about unwanted advances and “tainting” her son. So here she was, glad to be out of that house even if it meant a lecture from Mr. Simon Hoggs, aka the social worker who immediately believed the mother without so much as asking her what happened.
“May?”
“It’s cliche to just say I love him...but, well...I love him. And...Mama we found out...we’re soul mates,” Tony said quietly, taking a moment before looking up into his mother’s eyes. She looked like she didn’t believe him before her face softened.
Didn’t mean he would never strangle anyone with his bare hands again, though.
crushing her.
She hesitated at the door, second guessing sneaking out and showing up at Clint’s doorstep when said door suddenly flew open.
“They’re...dead to me,” she said carefully as Bucky’s face scrunched up in confusion. “My mother and step-father are alive and live in Canada. I haven’t talked to them since I was eighteen and swore any child of mine would never meet them.” She clearly was beginning her story, Bucky curious where she was going with this but remaining quiet nonetheless.
“You’re not in trouble, Joey. Buck, why don’t you go fix them a snack?” he suggested as he walked over to squat down and hug the poor kid.
“-Sweetheart, focus. What specifically did I say?”
?!” he asked before covering his face with his hands and crying in anguish.
“Uh oh, what’s the bad news?”
“Holy shit, Tony, that was so fucking hot,” Steve said before kissing him again, getting Tony to chuckle against his perfect lips.
Her fathers' wedding was the most fun she'd ever had, but after eating so much cake she was pretty tired. She went to sit next to her Uncle Steve, who was holding a sleeping Morgan in his arms.
Fuck it was such bullshit. Her smiling face is what’s kept him going this last year.
Steve almost cut his hand slicing a tomato, surprised that that was what was bothering the child.
“You know what’d be an even better apology? A gift from your billionaire boyfriend, you’ve seen how old my car is right?” Steve threw his head back in laughter, smiling at his friend who had joined him, wondering momentarily if he was teasing or not.
“Don’t worry cub. Vi took care of everything. And, she’s coming over for dinner and we’re going to watch a movie together. Just the three of us.” She was glad her face was hidden in his chest so he couldn’t see her grimace at the news.
"Makes sure it looks good Miss Kori, she's got a princess to impress," Steve joked and smiled when Em's cheek turned pink in embarrassment. She smiled even as Pat teased an "ooh" at her in jest.
He held off as long as he could, making sure Joey had Steve in the room before quickly escaping to absolutely murder him. And that’s when his so called ‘besties’ caught him before he could bring justice to this situation.
Steve shook his head no, realizing he hadn’t answered his question as he continued staring at what was in his lap.
“No, it didn’t surprise anyone. Except for Harley, who heard his father say he was only here for the money and wanted nothing to do with his son.”
“Petey?” Tony whispered back.
“Emerson. I want to make something perfectly clear, okay?” he waited for her nod before continuing, “you are welcome to stay with us as long as you want. What has been done to you is beyond repulsive and you can be damn sure Steve and I are taking care of this tomorrow. But for right now, tonight? – Was that a tremor in his voice? – Please understand that you are safe here, okay?”
Prepared to do whatever it took to save their girl.
It didn’t get a laugh from the pup, but he did look up wide eyed at the Alpha. Steve was tired of making excuses for that man. He was glad he was out of their lives for good.
“Hey!” her father barked out again, gripping her arm and yanking her to the side, away from the small crowd that had gathered. “What the hell just happened? Did you use your powers in public?” She nodded, unable to lie to him and starting to feel a little afraid at how angry he was.
And it wasn’t Natasha’s.
“I…what are you talking about?” Pepper asked with a smile.
"Emerson, you know I was joking right? I am not actually upset, I am beyond excited to see you again." Emerson felt her heart burst in her chest, pleasantly surprised to find all her hypotheticals were wrong. However, she still hadn't said anything and felt her face burn red when her Dad continued snickering behind her. She saw Peter out of the corner of her eye join their Dad behind her - bastard joining in to laugh at her expense.
“Food doesn’t have taste anymore,” she grumbled as her Pop groaned and turned off the stove before he sharply turned to her again.
“Yeah well,” she said finally looking at him, “it’s not exactly something you brag about.”
“Um...I just came to check on you guys...Tony, honey, why are you lying on the floor?” Steve asked, leaning against the doorway.
Steve laughed warmly at that, adding, “me too, shell head.” He gave his husband a quick peck on the cheek before moving to exit the vehicle. He smiled to see his husband follow, hands joining in the elevator. He squeezed the hand of his love one more time before they broke apart – walking along the medical wing to where their kids were.
“I asked if you wanted to get out of here,” Tony said in a lower octave that had Steve glad he was already sitting down.
“Leo,” Wade said quietly, still squatting down as he gently grabbed the boy’s hand. “This is my very sweet husband, Peter.” The arachnid took that opportunity to squat down as well, accepting the hug from his girl as he offered the boy a small wave.
“When what, honey?” Tony asked putting his hand on her shoulder, encouraging her to continue.
“What kind of classes would you take?” she asked in curiosity. He smiled, stopped drawing entirely and even threw the pad and pencil on the side table to turn to her.
“Come on Rumlow, let’s go find Ashley and Staci,” Ryan said as Rumlow stood staring at Clint.
They talked until closing time, Steve feeling his heart grow as they chatted easily into the late hours of the evening. He could probably draw Tony from memory, the somehow round and chiseled jaw line, the long eyelashes shielding the dark chocolate eyes, or the way they crinkle when he laughs, and those plump pink lips, which Steve didn’t notice he was practically gawking at until Tony pointedly licked said lips and smiled when he again made eye contact with him.
“Here I am?” she asked as she slowly made her way to join them at the table they had moved to. Steve frowned at her movement, because it looked an awful lot like she was in pain.
Tony was supple and pliant below him, making the absolute best sounds Steve had ever heard. They both came at the same time, the blonde feeling himself continue to cum as the Omega practically vibrated below him. When he eventually pulled out, he excused himself to grab some tissues before coming back and cleaning the Omega off. Tony purred as he finished up, grabbing Steve’s hand when he finished and yanking him back down on the bed.
why she went directly to her room instead of greeting us, eh?” the brunette said as he stole a piece of the garlic bread Steve had just finished slicing. He swatted the man’s thigh, though that only always enticed the man.
“–no I mean, I don’t believe this,” he said as he showed Tony the pictures. “Look, her eyes are slightly open in this picture and you can see she’s drenched in sweat. I…I don’t think she drank, Tony. I think she had a seizure…” Tony looked incredulously back and forth from the picture and the genuine look on Steve’s face.
They were huge. Bigger than her even.
“Petey-pie! Oh I missed you so much, little monkey!” he said as he swung the toddler in the air, relishing the laughter it produced.
“Of course you can, anytime man,” Sam said after he sent Steve a glare.
Not that Tony was necessarily complaining.
“My Daddy!” the five year old cried painfully. The three adults quickly approached them, Pepper closest and trying to reassure the five year old with quiet whispers.
“You must be really bored now that you’re retired, old man,” she said as she began copying his movements. Even though the man was technically over a hundred, he still only looked to be in his early forties – minus a few grays that recently became visible. Compared to her Dad, who had ‘salty sideburns’ and constantly threatened to dye it. Her Pop gave her a look that snapped her out of her thoughts.
“Never met him, but I like the kid,” Wade said with a smirk before turning back to the stove.
This was all his fault.
Tony chuckled and wrapped his arms around the Alpha, feeling the same way.
Peter, having worked up the courage, finally asked Wade, “why did you say yes?”
The one Tony was apparently most insecure about. He looked up at his husband as he kissed the surgery scar on his chest, smiling when the man blushed back at him.
Steve let Harley and Morgan wander the gym floor after having JARVIS shut down the parts with weapons and weights. It left the gymnastics and jungle gym open, which were super child-proof with excess padding. Clint had taken it upon himself to show off his tumbling skills, which prompted all four kids to attempt to copy him.
It always seemed to come in handy to the genius.
“So…you’re really going to be fine?” she asked hesitantly.
“Why would you buy this?” he asked as Tony settled on his lap, the blonde bringing the thing in front of them so they both could see it. In all it’s ridiculousness.
“Maybe I could…start by spending the night? I snuck out anyway, if they knew…”
He gently closed the door behind them, returning the hug Emerson had quickly wrapped him in. He looked over her hair at his husband, whose arms were crossed as he offered a small smile to the two.
“You done milking it?” Rhodey asked after coming to a halt by the bed, eyes scanning for any real injuries.
“Yes!” they both said in unison.
” she pleaded quietly as she couldn’t help the kick that followed. He paused for a moment, presumably shaking his hand out by the sounds in the air, before asking her
Why were Steve’s nerves suddenly setting in?
“- Wait I...I hurt Clint!” Daci suddenly cried in horror, twisting around to try and look at the archer. But since he was still unconscious and had dried blood on his cheeks, Bucky kept her from seeing that.
“What? I want chocolate! Daci let me help,” Peter said, suddenly up off the ground and grabbing empty mugs. Tony just laughed as he sat on the couch, balancing both babies on his lap while Daci finished collecting all the dirty napkins and empty plates. “I can take those if you want,” Peter said, suddenly appearing by her side and genuinely startling her.
“Right, well whatever Josephine has been telling you, I can assure you I treat all my students equally–”
“I just…I don’t like that no one told me about her. Even if she is a bad person.” She saw him look away, presumably at Steve, neither speaking for a moment.
“I get what you’re saying Tony, but
She pulled away from them with a laugh, turning when she saw Wade and Peter approaching them; pulling her into a much less crushing embrace then her fathers.
He listened for a few minutes before going where the pup directed him, telling him to change his answer to the velociraptor as they stopped in front of the skeleton. Steve just smiled, all anger gone as the pup trailed off, a happy scent wafting off him.
He nodded and smiled at that.
“Alright, I think that’s enough drinking for you,” Clint said as he took the beer from Bucky’s hand and gave it to Natasha.
When it came to his brother, he always found himself being more lenient – remembering he’d thrown a punch or two for Bucky back in the day.
getting some sleep. And without him having to physically drag him, no less. He pulled the covers back and climbed in next to him, reaching over to grab his husband’s waist and pulling him back to the center so they could spoon.
He found himself humming in approval, smiling more as he heard Steve chuckle behind him – absolutely loving that sound. The blonde started kissing his neck, laughing more when Tony stretched out to give him more access.
“Pop!” she shouted, halting to a stop next to the father as she looked at the man behind him. Her eyes stayed glued to Wade, glaring daggers at him as she moved past Steve to the other man. Steve stole a glance at Peter who looked surprised at Emerson, before turning back to Emerson just as she swung her right arm to punch Wade directly in the face.
," Clint whispered back, tears in his beautiful blue eyes as they pulled away for a moment to smile at each other.
“This is a bad time, my family is in the middle of dinner-”
“Steve you mind watching the kid while I go to SHIELD for my evaluation?” Buck asked as Peter encouraged Daci to try the chocolate donut with sprinkles.
“Come on, you can think bigger than that!” Tony suggested as he suddenly joined them in the living room. He was in his standard tank and sweats, oil smudge on his face from being in his lab.
Steve grabbed his hand as they walked down the sidewalk, gripping it when they got to his car.
this, Barnes."
"Yeah, me neither. But we should both try to get some sleep cause it's late and we're already in bed," he said with his eyes closed.
Speaking of, Clint got an archery scholarship and was also rumored to be an Olympic candidate.
No matter how much of an asshole he actually was.
Wade still wouldn't talk about it and wouldn't allow the name of his alter ego to even be spoken around the boy. He didn't want to push it, since Wade would only insist that it was fine and got angry a few times when Peter tried to talk about it.
"J is Bruce in his lab?" he asked as he looked up at the ceiling.
Whatever, she was clothed and not screaming her normal demands to ‘be nakey!’
“Jo,” Tony said gently, causing her to look up at him; blinking as tears spilled down her cheek. She sat forward only slightly, Steve a little jealous of her actually listening to Tony.
They had spent the day at a carnival a few cities away, glad for the lack of recognition the two fathers usually got. That night, Steve left Tony to do some additional work in his lab, curling up to sleep in their bed. He hadn’t meant to stay up that late, glancing at the clock reading 1:04AM, but he and Tony had stayed up a little talking about the upcoming meeting about the accords. His eyes shut; he was just starting to feel himself on the brink of sleep when his super hearing picked up the small sound of his door opening.
“So, I don’t remember seeing anyone new on the news. Who’s the mystery guy? A mutant?” Rhodey asked with his arms crossed and leaning back against the counter.
Bucky watched in satisfaction the look of panic on Strucker’s face before he flew a few feet in the air, eyes bleeding quickly as the life was choked out of him. It was a quicker death than the man deserved, but he was more concerned about getting his kid back home than anything.
“Did...did you experience bad homes?” he asked shyly. She took a deep breath before answering his question, not wanting to lie to the boy.
"Hey Em, want your Pop and I to stick around or would that not be helpful?" he asked as she eyed the two fathers for a moment, before her eyes settled on Steve's chest.
“Nope, not a problem,” the blonde replied looking into his eyes before leaning down to kiss him some more. They stayed like that for a few moments until they both heard a crash. The two sat up together, listening for additional noise when they heard Peter scream.
“You…you’re…” she sputtered.
“She had a nightmare, apparently you
Opening the door quietly, he couldn’t help but smile at seeing his slumbering husband already in bed. Normally Tony would’ve been in his lab, or reading something on his tablet but the Doombot fight plus putting Petey to bed must’ve knocked him out. He was even on the far side of the bed, facing the wall and not hogging the covers or snuggled up in the middle.
"You're the reason I have that kid, Clint. You're the reason for a lot of things. If
"Excuse me, is that your son?" the wife asked, sporting a cross necklace.
“It was Tony, okay? But I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t genuinely want to do that! You are…an amazing and hilarious young woman and I would absolutely love to spoil you.” The embarrassment Joey felt quickly subsided in favor of the love she felt in her chest.
"Yeah, I'll need a minute to get everything ready if you'll go empty your bladder one more time," Bruce said as Steve helped her off the counter. The fathers decided to follow her to double check she wanted them to stick around, the brunette taking the opportunity to grope his husband while they waited. The taller man brushed him off when the bathroom door opened, the blonde crossing his arms as he stepped away from his husband.
“It’s just painting with your fingers. I got ingredients to make it edible so it’ll be safe when Harley and Morgan and probably Tony put their fingers in their mouths.” She couldn’t help smiling at the image.
“Well, no…”
“It’s better than seeing him so upset,” Steve said with a shrug before he shoved his brother playfully.
He held her for a few moments before he said anything. He needed to ground himself back to earth and currently holding his safe and uninjured daughter while petting her hair was doing the trick. She didn’t seem to mind the silence as she gently moved her head along with his hand – even pushing into it at times.
So he leaned over to kiss the crap out of his lovely, absurd, dumbass of a ridiculous man of his.
She checked her watch, noting that her Dad shouldn’t be home for another couple of hours.
"-And how this whole life you made for yourself - that was all you baby," her Dad said as he kissed her cheek.
“I wasn’t even sure you’d like him,” Tony said honestly, walking over to sit in his Dad’s chair.
“Right, sorry that’s what I meant, girlfriend. You think he needs a girlfriend?” Steve reiterated as he finished up the last of the sandwiches and started cutting some fruit.
“Does yours have anything to do with hitting our child?” Steve closed his eyes in frustration,
“I didn’t say you were, just that it’s not a bad thing that one of People’s “Sexiest Men Alive” said you were attractive,” Sam said as he led the way into the station.
“Come on, love. Let’s go get massages,” Steve said, wrapping his hand around the Omega’s waist and placing a kiss against his temple. But Tony wasn’t satisfied with that after seeing his baby walk away, so he turned to his Alpha and pulled him into a heated kiss.
"Thanks, I like the long hair," he said fondly back at his oldest friend.
"What do you mean?" Steve asked sincerely, "you'd be a great dad."
“Dad, we’re trying to get him
“Yeah, sorry. I was trying to be polite,” Steve said with smile, pulling Tony closer to him as the scientist wondered if he could possibly physically contain this amount of happiness. If she stayed there much longer, Tony would be inclined to kiss Steve to further rub it in.
Clint took the bag as he squinted at him, halfway teasing and halfway bringing his walls up, before he stepped back to let the older teen inside. As he watched him step inside, he brought a breadstick out to chew.
"Morning Papa!" Miles shouted through giggles as Steve carefully placed the boy on his hip, kissing his cheek.
That’s when he heard a scream.
“Petey she already had a Momma, remember? But she died when Jo was little…”
"So proud of you baby girl," the blonde said before joining her other father in tears.
Tony, being the little shit he was, quickly rolled off Steve and briskly walked to the bathroom, turning to offer a grin to the angry looking man. He internally squealed when the blonde ripped the blankets away and marched over to him.
“Peter,” Tony answered with a matching grin. “Do you wanna see a picture?”
Again.
“Hey I don’t know about you guys, but I’m so hungry I could eat a giraffe,” Clint said loudly while rubbing his stomach.
“We adopted him about two weeks after he first came to stay with us,” Steve added.
Steve got the call while he was working at his grandfather’s gym, a frantic Tony who said Tiberius was supposed to pick Harley up from school an hour ago but had flaked at the last second. Stone hadn’t even called Tony himself, he’d had his secretary do the dirty work.
“Harry we talked about this…” Miles trailed off. Harry had some physical problems. He was asthmatic, had scoliosis as a kid and was short and skinny in stature. While Miles understood the appeal of being a superhero, he was skeptical of letting a kid do this.
,” the last name said with obvious sarcasm. She only glared back at him, the bastard knowing her last name was still Barnes.
She and her Pops shared a smile before making their way to the living room, but not before she gave the man a quick side hug in thanks.
“She also has to wait until she’s eighteen,” Steve returned, again rolling his eyes as the three children grumbled in protest.
“Miss, if you’d like I could grab Master Peter for comfort –”
So he figured since he was off tomorrow anyway – he’d give his husband space and time to tell him, while also bribing him.
“Stone stopped by, asking to speak to Tony in private. Turns out he was only back to try and merge companies, since he went bankrupt flaunting around Europe and has no idea how to run his dead father’s company.”
Did...did Bucky remind Clint too much of Rumlow? I mean...they’re both white brunettes...but other than that he liked to think he was everything that asshole wasn’t.
“You know you can tell me anything, right?” Steve asked quietly as Tony waited for him at the door. She looked at those blue eyes, only nodding in response – knowing if she opened her mouth she’d be completely honest with him – before she quickly looked away and lied back on her bed. She ignored the sigh she heard from Steve, but did smile a little as he tucked the blankets back around her.
“Xavier doesn’t smoke weed,” Tony said carefully, also suddenly curious. “Who was the one Sam told us abandoned you once the medics showed up?”
It was close to ten o’clock at night when they finally made it back home. JARVIS had reassured the two on the way back that nothing had set fire and everyone had been fed and put to bed.
“Alright, introductions have been made! Why don’t we -”
“Front entrance, I didn’t feel like letting her inside,” Sam said with a smile. Steve returned it, grateful for his friend as he moved to face the woman he’s never even officially met.
He thought about his oldest friend for a while along his run, until he could smell a nearby bakery and decided to grab some treats for breakfast. After tipping heavily and taking a picture with the cashier, he walked the rest of the way home, bags in hand.
“Wait...what? Buck...you’ve never made me feel like that?” Clint said quietly, face scrunched up in confusion. The sad look coming from his boyfriend - fuck it felt good to think that again - had him reaching a hand out to rest on his shoulder.
Everyone laughed, knowing he wasn’t being serious. Anyone within a hundred mile radius could tell Peter was loved by his dads.
Who was smiling back at him, hugging their daughter.
“Please don’t kill Jackson,” James said, interrupting his thoughts. “I don’t want to have to explain that to my dad.” Clint gently put the boy on his hip, pouting at the brunette who had raised a brow back at the blonde.
’ as Joey had so delicately named it. He and Tony had had many talks about this.
The officer that had her roughly pulled her out of the car and shoved her behind none other than Staci in the line of teenagers. Before she could say anything to that bitch, she heard the person behind her snickering.
The elevators dinged open, shaking him out of his thoughts as he walked into the living room. It was empty, Steve checking his watch to see it was a little after nine. So Peter was in bed…but where was his husband and daughter? He walked into the kitchen, finding no one in there either. His brows furrowed as he decided to check his husband’s lab.
both just kids…”
And his abs were one of Tony’s favorite spots.
He sent a quick prayer upstairs that the therapy would work. And maybe he should suggest sparring with his youngest…
time. So instead he dropped Harley off at Rhodey’s so they could go back to Tony’s after dinner. Steve chose an Italian restaurant and ended up with some marinara sauce on his chin that Tony restrained himself from licking off.
“Yeah, I wouldn’t recommend giving that to the kids. Even if it might actually calm Suzie down for once,” Bucky teased with a laugh as he played tug of war with Lucky. Clint couldn’t help staring at the brunette, thinking all this time that he hated the drug and would therefore hate Clint for smoking it.
“DUM-E, come out of timeout for a second,” Tony grumbled, still looking at Steve. The blonde’s eyebrows somehow furrowed even more until a robot with a large claw-arm of some kind rolled over to them, chirping the whole way. Then his brows shot up in amazement.
“I’M AN ADULT!” he tried to reason as he also attempted to wiggle away. Steve simply threw the adult over his shoulder and continued tickling him – though he’ll admit Peter’s length was making it a bit of a challenge.
“When we first met, you said...you said an Avenger vouched for me and you didn’t want to piss him off…” The last thing he expected out of Fury was a laugh, which actually startled the super soldier.
His fear of rejection was squashed when the archer silently nodded his head yes.
He took this opportunity to scoot closer to Tony, smiling when his love’s face blushed at the words.
She felt bad for even thinking it, but she’d always wanted a mom.
“Sonny, would you say bye to Cher already?” Joey groaned, though it didn’t sound nearly as sharp as it could’ve been.
“Thanks Sam,” he said, not caring that his voice choked a little.
“Loved your picture on Insta. I think it’s trending,” some girl she’d never spoken too sneered at Joey as she focused on standing up straight.
“Aren’t you the...shut up,” the archer said with a pout and shifted on the couch to scoot away from the two, wincing when his ankle shifted as well.
“-so after invading my privacy you decided to dictate my workout?” she snaps in disbelief, a small voice in her head saying her anger shouldn’t be directed at him.
to sleep, it was that every time he tried images from his past flooded his mind. Clearly, he was just a weak person.
“Jo you are in enough trouble as it is, you sure you want to dig yourself further?” he asked after folding his arms across his chest. She rolled her eyes and shook her head no in response.
It was only later when Daci stirred that he was able to focus on the here and now.
“Because we can,” came the unexpected reply from Steve. She looked up into the fiercest blue eyes she’d ever seen. “Because without knowing your past, it’s obvious you deserve better. And we think – he stole a glance with his husband, making a silent agreement with each other – that we can help you with that. Not because we feel obligated or because you’ve become Peter’s friend or anything like that. We want you here, granted you also want to stay here, because we care about you and want to help.”
Steve didn’t think it was funny.
And they were thrilled to hear from their old drinking buddy! Win win.
“Simple question Steve-o, did you or did you not like when Peter called you Papa?”
“Well well well, look at you!” Bucky said with a chuckle at the sight of his ridiculously dressed toddler.
Lacy, who was always kind to Steve, told him about his mom giving the ‘verbal ass-kicking of a lifetime’ to that woman. That would’ve been the only other contact he’d had with her, other than calling her the day her granddaughter was born and her daughter died.
He felt his love kiss his temple, just as exhausted as the genius. He pulled away enough to look at his husband, leaning in to kiss his lips.
“Tony, your children are mocking me with a reference I don’t understand,” he added a pouty lip while he crossed his arms. Tony, the scoundrel, responded first by addressing the two teenagers trying and failing to hold giggles.
“Oh Steve,” Tony breathed out, “This is so fucking beautiful. Thank you,” he said before looking back at his love. Steve’s face was adorably pink, which it normally was when he showed him his artwork…
“That’s...holy fuck Tony. That’s not just awesome that’s...
to me. Honey, I’ve been pining for you for fourteen years. You think I’m going to find anyone else like you out there? Someone who’s a bigger troll? Who tells such horrible jokes?” Tony teased, which had Steve reflexively put the book to the side in order to tickle the smaller teen. He brought the man into straddle his lap, letting up on him when he continued.
“I don’t remember saying that…”
“Not as often as I’d like,” he admitted sadly, taking another moment to look at his more recent photos before putting his phone away. The device immediately vibrated in his pocket, Tony pulling it out to see May calling him.
“Tony,” the man greeted with a smile.
And a thousand times harsher.
“He did?” Jo asked after pulling a little away from her Nana. The woman brushed some of the flour off her face with a smile before responding.
"Of course Mr. Miles, if you all would follow me," the King said; his smile grew as Miles quickly grabbed his hand to follow. She was thankful for the distraction as an idea popped into her head.
“Sweetheart, I knew you were lying about those things,” Steve said, smiling when his husband’s face immediately frowned at that, “I just let you get away with them cause I wanted to be surprised, I like seeing your face when you pout and I was well aware how my ass looked, I just like teasing you.” This only caused the genius to pout, which made the super soldier take a step closer to hug the man.
She opted to remain quiet.
“You didn’t hear what he said! JARVIS-”
“We made vows Tony, vows neither of us plan on breaking, right?” he asked, arms loosening as he felt Tony shift around until he was facing him – the blonde tightening his arms around him once he settled. His love smiled at him, nodding his head in silent agreement.
“How are you feeling?” Tony asked her again.
She couldn’t help but be a little sad, since she was having so much fun with Clint. But she also missed her Tati and wanted to know how his test went.
She stood, turning to her Pop who whispered, “I’ll be right here until you’re done,” before smiling in reassurance. She nodded before turning back to the nice looking woman. She followed her down the hallway and into her office.
“It’s alright, I’ve told her before she can call me Susie,” the older woman tried to intercede.
EMERSON
But before he could register that anything was happening, her brunette father quickly shoved him into the bath with her. She shrieked with laughter and wiped some of the new bubbles from her face. She has never laughed this hard in her life, watching her Daddy sputter up out of the water - fully clothed.
Her words were on repeat in the super soldier’s head. He had hoped running would clear his mind, but it only made the thoughts worse. He was mostly to blame, knowing he was pushing her to talk about her mother. He was just trying to help, remembering how Tony felt guilty for his past and how they had worked through it together.
“Clint’s already got that taken care of, thanks though,” Bucky sneered, keeping his eyes on the other two who looked like they were waiting for Brock’s orders. He watched as Rumlow brought his arm back, looking like he was going to punch him - when something hit his chest and he fell back on the ground.
“Why not?” she asked as she drew some flowers.
to rangle those toddlers,” the other brunette said sincerely. “You’re a great dad, Petey-pie.”
After winning a gold medal in archery - yeah, apparently he had told the truth about the Olympics - the blonde went on to become a gymnastics teacher and foster parent with his husband.
Tony had graciously decided to be part of the conversation, making sure Steve ‘behaved himself.’ Which only slightly infuriated the blonde.
“You don’t think you’re good enough for me? Baby you’re
“I’m especially serious about how old you are…don’t think that just because you’re almost eighteen–”
“He was literally born yesterday, so he still looks like an alien,” he explained as he handed her his phone to scroll thru.
She was about ninety nine percent sure she had a bladder infection, evident by the incredible pain whenever she peed and the subsequent cramping. Unfortunately with her past, she was well aware of the symptoms from a urinary tract infection. She'd had them frequently growing up and knew cranberry juice would help. Her birth parents were against hospitals, since they could easily find more evidence of her abuse, so she only knew of that gross juice to help.
“Oh my god you diva, you’re fine,” her Pops said with a groan, causing her and her brother to share a laugh.
“We’ll be good,” Clint muttered as he brought the baby down, which had the toddler copy him.
“Steven,” she said dripping with sass, obviously buzzed as she defiantly downed the rest of her drink.
“Who is ‘everyone’?” he asked in sudden curiosity.
“Sure,” she said with a smile and a shrug of her shoulder.
“Congrats,” Wade added.
“Well…I didn’t do it alone. I had your Papa who refused to give up on me. He’s why I’m still alive today, why I’m blessed enough to have you and your brother now.  Coming to terms with your past to live your future isn’t something you can do alone.” She nodded into his chest, settling down as he rubbed circles into her back. They sat there for a few minutes, the genius having said what he wanted to and just enjoyed holding his troubled kid. She spoke again after another beat, only whispering.
“I overheard Robert on the phone with a man from the Philippines. He owed a debt and was going to send that innocent sweet baby angel away like a fucking worthless
“Asgard is fine, young Peter. We had just been celebrating the victory over a democratic resolution when Heimdall informed me my presence was requested back on Earth.”
He looked back at her dumbfounded.
If you're wondering why her last name changes - it's because I honestly don't know how hyphenated last names work. So Rogers is her middle name.
“No” Tony said at the same time Steve said “yes.”
"Mr. Loki?" Miles asked from his Dad's lap.
“Don’t worry,” the blonde said between attacking his face with kisses, “I’ll make it up to you,” he said as he squeezed Tony’s ass again.
The baby he thought he had lost, small and calm
“DADS! You promised this wouldn’t happen
,” she finished quietly. He blinked a few times, wondering if he had heard her right.
"You...wait...you like me?" she asked, biting her bottom lip as hot, unwanted tears dripped down her face. Dark chocolate eyes looked back up at her green ones, growing watery as she nodded her head in response.
“Joey, we talked about this,” his husband said gently. “You’re not in trouble anymore, but one of us has to tell your Dad what happened,” he finished sadly.
“Looks okay, I can change the bandages in a bit if you’d like,” he offered gently giving her hand back. She simply made herself more comfortable, not wanting to move from the spot. He started petting her head again as she noticed Tony wasn’t with them. Then she realized this should’ve been a school day, also realizing Steve must’ve called in to stay with her.
“Do you have any extra sunglasses?” Joey asked before he shut the car door. Peter’s face lit up at the prospect, even though it wasn’t a particularly sunny day. He held a finger up at the two, reaching into the backseat where Pepper insisted he keep ‘emergency bags’ and yup! Sure enough, another pair of Tony’s Ray Bans and one of Peter’s adorable child-size ones. He pulled them out and handed them to the two, smiling when Joey’s jaw-dropped at the Ray Bans.
“Oh I already have a restraining order against the paps for both of you, effective until you’re 18,” he said as he pulled into the carnival parking lot – glad to see several nice cars in the lot. When he parked he glanced back over at the teen just staring at him.
Not that he was necessarily complaining, of course.
“I’m glad,” his boyfriend said with his face scrunched up adorably, causing Steve to steal another kiss from the man he planned on kissing forever.
“I’m not a mind reader, Steve-”
Alright, Tony deserved a little bit of that since he’d been snippy with Steve, but it was also kind of proving the theory that the brunette had developed in his head.
He was second guessing his wardrobe for that evening for the eighth time when he heard his husband shout for him. Instincts taking over from the worried voice, he dropped the two suits he was comparing and ran into the living room. Steve had his phone in his hand as he paced around, eyes darting back and forth.
Tony thought it was all a little ridiculous. But he sat dutifully in the bleachers with his friends, dressed in a simple blue button up, black jacket and slacks. Doing his best to ignore his teasing friends as they waited for the game to start.
"Come on, Dad! It's paintball, you'll have fun!" she whined right back to him.
“Rogers,” Fury said a little more calmly. Steve turned to him, confused but fairly aware of what went down. “After I’m done with Rumlow, I’d like to speak with you in my office.” The blonde nodded in response, face burning a little with the humiliation of the situation. He had seen the coffee table at this point, a tabloid with a more recent picture of the two – making it hard to deny it was anyone but Steve Rogers dating Tony Stark.
“She broke her arm trying to win a bet,” she said with a brow raised. She continued talking when Joey still stared skeptically at her.
Add that to the physical pain of this punishment, she has never felt this horrible.
going back to the Tower,” her Tati snapped before grabbing her arm and pulling her away from the archer.
So Steve sprawled himself out on top of the covers, drawing pad in front of him as he smiled at her getting over her embarrassment to hang out with him.  As she walked over to join him, he saw her peak at the picture in curiosity. It was just Tony’s profile, but he smiled when he heard her scoff fondly at that.
“Bitch you ain’t my daddy!” she said in offense.
. “You know what? Tony was just leaving, right Tony? Okay bye Tony I’ll see you tomorrow pick you up at seven okay text me okay goodbye!” Steve floundered as he pushed his way inside, past his laughing mom who waved at Tony while Steve quickly shut the door. Tony stood there laughing another moment, listening in on Steve try and fail to chastise his mom.
“Please, Tony and Steve are fine,” his Pop said while opening up the menu in front of him.
“We’re here for Tony, miss,” he heard his godfather say kindly, though his eyes were still trained on his father who was glowering right back at him.
“Alright alright, spill you two.” Giving them a fake glare and placing his hands on his hips.
“Yes your Papa told me,” she answered around a bite.
“Wait,” he said quietly as he pulled his own phone out - the one Tony gave him that had once belonged to Tony. He scrolled through the contacts list, wondering why neither Tony nor himself had deleted them, when sure enough - Jarvis was listed under J.
"Who's up for Toy Story?" Emerson asked, interrupting their impending squabble in favor of being selfish. "J? A little help?" she asked the ceiling as her parents took the hint and sat back in silence.
“Nuh uh,” Steve said in disagreement. “Your Daddy will be fine, toys coming to life and being mean is
“Of course not, cub. Lean your head back and I’ll rinse your hair.” She closed her eyes and enjoyed the water until her Tati was finished.
child." Both she and Peter loudly whined in protest, knowing where this was going as the once-chameleon quickly popped out of the cushions.
“I’m holding you to Disney world, old man,” she said with a smile before getting up to take her stuff to her room.
“She has epilepsy; diagnosed when she was 10. She’s been great about taking her meds, I don’t think I’ve seen her have a seizure in almost 2 years…” he said in confusion as he wiped some of the sweat from her face.
“Is self-defense suddenly a crime? They were probably trying to make sure they didn’t get any…
“There you go, now you’re a shark-monster,” Bucky said with a smile.
Around lunchtime is when Natasha joined them, taking Morgan from Clint's lap as Steve heard his stomach rumble.
“So? Have you guys decided who’s going to be who?” he asked as he moved around to pick up his grandson and sit him on his lap next to his husband.
…redeeming qualities. Including having the money to use the best lawyers to help. And as for Joey, just…tell her the situation and give her other avenues for teenage rebellion that won’t ruin your career.” Steve found himself smiling again.
“Don’t bother with Stevie, he’s a wet blanket,” her favorite blonde quipped.
“Um,” Steve said, face scrunched up and looking like he’d rather be anywhere but here. “Why don’t you come in?” he asked, much to Tony’s surprise as the brunette followed him in to the apartment. He wasn’t necessarily sure he wanted to see what made that noise, but the fact that Steve was leading him to the kitchen made him all the more curious.
“Thanks Pop,” she said with a blush before quickly enveloping him in a hug.
“He’s going to be fine, surgery went well. Just needs some R&R and he’ll be back to his old self,” she assured.
“Sir… I have reason to believe Mr. Stark is hurting Tony…”
"What? No, it's my birthday, which makes me queen, which means it's cake time now!" she said with a smile, turning to her parents with an open-mouthed smile.
He’s talking to Stone. And a woman who is dangerously close to his Omega.
The room was gorgeous, just like everything else in this country. She ran to the curtains, opening them up as she gawked at the view; partially she could see the city, but mostly the beautiful landscape surrounding it. She smiled to herself as she figured out how to not completely block the view while also making it dark enough to catch some z's in. The bed was of course like sleeping in a damn cloud, smiling as she slowly drifted off -
“You don’t know that!” Tony countered as he made his way to sit by her. She checked to make sure he had washed his hands before freely wrapping her arms around him.
“I didn’t,” she said as she slowly extracted herself from the comfy bed. “It just…didn’t work out with them. So I came back and found Tony passed out.” She started walking towards the door, stopping to say what she needed to to Steve, who was now fully clothed near the bed and had a scowl on his face.
“They looked at me and saw…me. And they treat me like a fu–messed up fifteen year old should be treated, with kindness and respect,” she ended her little statement shooting a smile to the three, failing at hiding their amusement, sitting off to the side. Peter noticed his dads had grabbed each other’s hands.
He shook himself from his thoughts as he remembered what they were really here to talk about; the man Tony never even mentioned before yesterday.
He was a fast learner, however, as Tony was gently placed down in the already hot running shower – gawking at the man who immediately fell to his knees and proceeded to give Tony one of his top five favorite blowjobs of all time.
After Steve’s knot deflated and he pulled himself free, the two laid next to each other, staring at the ceiling and still catching their breath.
“ – He probably added you know, descriptors to it, etc” – it was at this point Peter gave her a playful shove, the light bulb going off on in Steve’s head that she was referencing something he didn’t know – “like, oh, I don’t know, Big Papa?”
And she hasn’t even started the homework.
Stone Inc dropped in the stock market so much that Stone sold it.
“Making sure you don’t break your neck, care to join me in my office?”
"Hey guys," Peter greets as he walks over to put the gifts on the couch between him and his dads. The two sat up in interest, though his Dad was unfortunately still in his Pop's lap before making grabby hands.
“Oh, well…you’re right,” Steve said teasingly. “I
?” Steve asked in confusion.
"No," Peter said immediately, smiling at his boyfriend's offended face.
So it wasn’t entirely surprising when they’d paid for Ty to bow out and leave the country.
He watched his son walk away before turning to look at the man who wasn’t even twenty years old yet. The fake mustache didn’t help him look any older, having the opposite effect. He heard footsteps and turned to see Emerson round the corner, running past Peter to him.
scariest monster, Buck,” Steve said pointedly. His brother just rolled his eyes at him and turned back to smile at his daughter.
“Maybe, if you wanted to I mean. I kind of like the idea of seeing your name whenever I want.” Tony found himself smiling again, kissing his husband’s cheek as they finally saw the villa down the beach.
“Okay,” the blonde said with a shy smile, taking a breath before going into his closet. Tony kicked his legs and waited as Steve came back and sat next to him on the bed. “It’s not my best work, but…”
He bent down, almost kissing his lips before whispering to the man.
He looked up at his love whose face changed to pure glee.
He messaged Wade the change of plans before stopping by their apartment to grab a few things. He got a text that he checked before driving to the Tower - Wade offering to make soup and bring it when he had a chance.
“It’s an autopsy report,” Kimberly said. “I found it a few months ago. It’s how I finally had the balls to track you down. You didn’t kill her Emerson, you spared her.” Emerson’s eyes tried to read the medical jargon on the page, but her anxiety was in overdrive and she couldn’t focus. She looked wildly back up at the woman.
“See?” Steve said as he sat up to straddle his man. “Every single inch,” he said as he grabbed his husband’s left hand, one final scar to focus on. Tony rolled his eyes fondly below him until the blonde stuck the man’s entire ring finger in his mouth, tongue caressing the silver band covering the tattoo. It might have been a little narcissistic, since it was Steve’s name and all, but he was guessing by the hardening member poking him it wasn’t a bad idea.
"Probably not, considering she's the only one I talked to about proposing..." That stopped Clint in his tracks, which had Bucky grinding to a halt next to him with a chuckle.
Steve’s mind is brought back to the present when they heard an exasperated toddler join them once again.
Arms were crushing his ribs before he could blink, moving his arms to return the hug from her. “I love you too, Papa. Very much,” she said with tears.
Steve didn’t reply for a moment, a soft smile on his face as he leaned down to place a gentle kiss on Tony’s lips. “Not proposing, just admiring the man I love.” He kissed Tony again. “I’m so lucky to have you.”
“How familiar are you with soulmate bonds?” the doctor asked after a moment. Tony sat frozen, not sure what to make of that question as the Beta continued. “They’re incredibly rare but they exist. There have been about less than a hundred recorded soulmate bonds in history, but there are documented cases. They’re said to even contain various powers. Like healing each other through the bond...and conquering infertility.”
“Sweet. And Daci can stay here too right?”
“Oh, you are so smart,” Tony purred with wiggly brows, squeezing the blonde’s knee playfully before starting his mustang and driving over the speed limit to the nearest least/expensive hotel.
“Hey, you know what’s fun though? Aunty Pepper is coming by later to hang out with you while Papa and I go to a boring party,” Tony said as he walked over to hug the boy. “And I think she said something about pizza and ice cream for dinner?”
Which Tony would still be a part of if the teen could handle a few inappropriate jokes along with Tony’s slightly erratic and nervous behavior.
“See, what I don’t need right now, are fucking excuses. I don’t care how, I just want that fucker gone,” Tony growled at his eight well paid lawyers. He had called them into the conference room, as well as Pepper and his new assistant, Marcus, who were sitting off to the side.
"Always."
He turned to look at his son, wondering if he even looked passed his own hurt to see Wade’s. He waited until the door closed behind him to gently let his daughter go.
“Thanks, Pops. Night dads,” he smiled at the two who smiled back before turning back to talk about his secret alter ego.
“Do you wanna get some fresh air?” Steve asked him quietly, grabbing his hand when Tony nodded and led the two outside. They disposed their cups on their way out, ignoring the stares as Steve led them around the corner of the gym.
EMERSON
He definitely must’ve zoned out if enough time had passed that Steve had read several stories and kissed their son goodnight. Steve always told him he’d tried to limit it to two…but those puppy eyes got him every time.
“Oh no, oh hell no,” Tony muttered as Daci found herself shrinking back from his glare.
“What nonviolent way do you want to handle this, Jo?” he asked the teen as Steve moved to rest his head on top of Tony’s; practically pulling the man onto his lap in order to do so. He smiled when Steve hummed in approval at the question, the vibrations tickling the brunette’s head.
“Ty I think it’s time for you to leave, for good,” Steve said calmly, contemplating whether or not to let his father-in-law just go at him. Ty looked at Steve for a long moment, eyeing the other Alpha up and down before posturing. Even though Steve had a good inch and fifteen pounds of muscle on the guy.
“Daddy,” Tony corrected him, smiling when his father turned towards him with a quirked brow. “I’m going by Daddy. I figured I could pick my name if I’m doing both jobs,” he finished with a shrug before walking over to the two.
“No no,” she interrupted. “There’s a group. Your seven o’clock. I recognize them, they run a drug and trafficking ring. And they look shady as fuck right now exchanging something with the doorman at the bar across the street.”
…while I explain in detail to you two what firing looks like and what having a scorching reputation will do so early in your career…” she felt scolded even though her aunt’s ire wasn’t directed at her. She was that good. Tweedlee quickly did her one job and Emerson was already running down the hallway to find her stupid family.
“- you’ve seen her every night for the past two weeks, I think she can manage one night without you. Tony and I are going on a date night and you’ll stay here and watch the bunch.”
“Jumping off rooftops in spandex…on the other hand,” she teased before turning back to the window. He smiled at her back before grabbing a towel and spray to help.
She takes off her jacket and backpack, finishing with her shoes before she walked towards the sounds of her parents talking in the kitchen.
“I’m also Tony’s ex,” the needy bitch added, trying to sit up and somehow look smug even as Tony and Steve held hands. The waiter saved her from Tony blurting something inappropriate in response, taking their orders as an uncomfortable silence fell over the table.
“I’ll get it, just stay here…before your disease spreads to my kids,” she muttered as she walked away from them, Trevor looking like he wanted to punch the blonde.
When she became conscious again, she was in the backseat of an ambulance with an Adonis paramedic sitting next to her.
," he promised.
"Well, Pop, I um, came here to tell you guys...I decided to postpone college. For now." His sister and Pop's eyes practically bulged from their sockets as his Dad simply looked sad back at Peter. "I'll go in a few years, but right now I want to spend more time, doing what I love..."
“Is that what you want, Stark? For me to bend you over and punish you accordingly?” Steve whispered harshly while his hands roamed roughly over the smaller man he pinned down. Tony pushed his ass out, inviting whatever plans the super soldier concocted. “Wait,” he heard Steve’s unsure voice again, “do they sit on this table?”
“Let’s put your shoes on, hot stuff,” the blonde said before grabbing his hand and dragging them back to the bedroom.
“These are your drawings?” Tony asked quietly, gently taking the notebook in his hands as his beautiful boyfriend smiled and blushed.
Steve internally kicked himself, feeling guilty for being so insensitive; guilt not easing even when his husband sweetly kissed his cheek in comfort.
“Starks are good people, too,” she said with a blush that warmed the genius’ heart. He smiled at her another moment before addressing the ceiling.
“...okay so turn invisible,” he said with a deeper glare, staring at his still very visible still very stupid little brother. Miles glared at him before closing his eyes. Peter stared at him another moment before sighing heavily. “Miles…”
“-Replace you? Tony, what-?”
Also, dichotomy thinking for those that don't know - is 'black or white'/'all or nothing' thinking
“You’re a welder?” Tony asked suddenly very interested.
Em chose that moment to roll over and accidentally kick the super soldier. Her green eyes cracked open at him, mumbling a quick apology before rolling back to bury her head in the pillows. Not half a second later, she sat upright, realization clicking in her brain.
“Yeah well, next time don’t let a building drop on you and we won’t be so worried,” she said as she rubbed her eyes free of tears. She heard her Dad scoff fondly.
Steve ran his hands through his hair in frustration.
“Hey…Em?” he asked as she began cleaning the closest window.
And a lot worse than almost giving your old man a heart attack," she laughed a little at that, glad to see him smile in return before addressing her again.
So the small act of Tony staying here with her…well fuck it brought tears to her eyes.
“Tell Jarvis if you need us,” Steve said with a smile before carrying his chuckling husband in the direction of their bedroom.
Hey Pop, I got assigned a partner for my final in art class, is it cool if I bring her home to work on it?
“I did not say Brad Pit was hotter than you!” she heard her Dad say in protest, almost making her back track her steps to avoid whatever that was about. She continued on her journey anyway, knowing it was futile to avoid them.
Tony, the bastard, snorted aloud at that.
“Oh, I don’t know, Steven. Cause I
have a crush agreed to go out with some jock bro.
She wishes now she could go back in time. Wished she’d been nicer to Wendy, even if to her credit she couldn’t predict the drunk driver that one week later took her life. She was the first adult who actively gave a damn about her. One of the few, one of the only.
“Yeah, Dad told me that before,” he said fondly.
The super soldier stood up before reaching down to grab his husband's hand, pulling him to stand up alongside him. The blonde then gently pushed the brunette in the general direction of their bedroom until their youngest added, "don't be too hard on him Papa!" The two fathers practically keeled over in laughter before continuing on their way.
“And what the hell is that supposed to mean?” he asked as he buckled his seat belt.
“Hey,” the blonde said quietly, only continuing when Tony looked at him again, “I love you, Omega.”
“You gotta put clothes on, baby,” he said as she started wobbling her bottom lip. “What if you pick out what you’re wearing, how about that?” he suggested as he began walking them in the direction of her dresser.
Twenty four hours ago he was manipulated into thinking he was in love, not caring of the impact it had on anyone else. Now...he recognized a deeper love than he probably even deserved. One he would never give up on.
“You got that right,” Peter said with a harsh laugh.
“Well well, looks like Jackie still loves me, not that the rest of you do,” Steve teased as he picked the boy up, Bucky realizing his other siblings must be behind him. Sure enough, his four year old sister and seven year old brother were giggling as they approached the two.
“Only if you take someone with you; I don’t need to worry about anyone else right now,” he said with an eyebrow raised.
Tony gently opened to the first page, already excited for the rest as he gazed down at the art.
“Yes Tony. I did. I…I choose you.” The billionaire laughed loudly at that, earning a small smile from the super soldier.
“Your surgery went really well, Dr. Strange did an amazing job – just like you thought he would. But last night…” the blonde paused to sigh heavily and look at the teen on the genius’ chest.
“Please” she quickly said between crying gasps.
“What about her mom? What happened to her?” Tony asked as Steve cast his eyes downward at the question.
“I’m helping, Steve! Do you have any idea how strong of a scent I’d have to ingest to make me cheat on you??”
She was stopped when she heard a different voice call her name.
.” Tony paused to clench and unclench his fists a few times in anger. Steve stayed silent, arms practically twitching from the desire to wrap his arms around his love. It was especially difficult when the man slowly walked towards the blonde.
“You don’t get to decide who I date, Daciana. You have no say in my love life,” the man growled out, barely stamping down the fury boiling up inside telling him to attack to get
“–No, sorry May of course, thank you for calling with the update,” he said with as little ire as he could muster.
Her face scrunched up before she answered, “my dad was for a few weeks.” When she finished she refused to look at him, which was fair because he was gawking at her.
“Am I wearing whatever is in here or..?”
“I can think of a better way for the two of us to...sober up…” Tony purred as Steve felt his pants tighten. He froze for a moment when the Omega leaned up to kiss him, but quickly snapped out of it and brought the brunette up into his arms. Steve carried the two to his bedroom and preened at the feeling of Tony laughing at his antics.
“Sure this is a fun game,” Clint said before he pretended to eat Morgan’s fingers, getting a giggle from both girls. She watched with a smile as Clint tickled the baby further, getting more laughs out of Morgan.
“You’ve never shown Harley the Wizard of Oz?” Steve asked the Omega, shooing him away when he tried to snag a piece of bread that Steve brought.
He shook his head, unable to hide the grin or the eye roll. He could hear her laughing at her small victory as he walked away.
“Oh?” Bucky asked as he handed him a glass. “You can have one of my siblings, if you want. And I still have an older sister I’m willing to negotiate for.”
"He wasn't a good guy," Miles said a little sadly.
And praying for patience along the way.
“So...what do we do now?” Steve asked after placing a few more sweet kisses against Tony’s neck.
will be handling this, everyone," Pop said before drawing his hand back in protest - Emerson laughing at the realization that her father immaturely licked the super soldier's hand. The blonde rubbed his hand into the brunette's face, his goatee disgustingly glistening with the saliva as the group joined in amused laughter.
He had experienced similar torture.
Emerson wasn’t at school the next day. Or the next. His dads had noticed the absence that evening and asked Peter about it. Shrugging, Peter offered no explanation and was quiet for the rest of dinner until his phone buzzed. He pulled the device from his pocket to check the message, ignoring his Pop’s reminder no phones at the dinner table.  “It’s Emerson,” he said looking up at them, “she’s asking if she can come over tomorrow to finish the project. She said she was out sick the last two days.” He didn’t sound entirely convinced as he relayed the message.
“Yeah, why are you sober?”
“Daci!” Bucky cried out before finally moving his feet to chase after her. She began fighting Steve, who was blocking her moves but struggling not to fight back. As soon as Bucky got close enough, Daci spotted him, moved around and stomped her foot at the two of them. They flew back in unison and demolished the wall behind them.
FLASHBACK
But her heart that had basically loved this girl from second grade let that slide for now. It wouldn’t hurt to text her dads…they’d probably say no anyway. She pulls out her phone as her excitement grew, doing her best to keep her poker face in front of Cara.
“So my mommas have what Joey has?” Jose asked with an adorably scrunched up face. Steve nodded again in response, wondering if he should cut them off from asking anything else.
“Ah, excellent point, Em,” Peter added, “follow up question; do you realize that you two act more like teenagers than your actual teenage children?”
The blonde looked back at his teen, wondering how she was practically an adult and still able to pull off those damn puppy eyes. He signed in defeat, not particularly loving her reaction of cheering in triumph. So he made sure to raise a brow at that, glad to see her compose herself.
She gulped as she grabbed her stuff and walked quickly past them, praying he wouldn’t swat her in front of them. She sighed in relief when he didn’t and absolutely hauled ass to get out of there and back home. She knew if she wasn’t in her room, he’d be even angrier, grabbing a quick glass of water for her cotton mouth and slipping into her room as swiftly as possible.
are the one who makes me happy, cub.
PETER
“I can’t believe I didn’t see this. Why didn’t you guys show me the footage earlier?” he asked the room, not looking up from his lap as traitorous tears prickled his eyes.
“Next week?” she asked, unaware of that part. “Why is it being done so urgently if it’s minor?”
She slept peacefully that night and the next few nights.
Especially from his boyfriend’s mouth.
"Yes and I don't believe he is doing anything of importance," the AI responded.
“That so?” Steve asked as he squeezed Tony’s ass again. He found himself closing his eyes in pleasure as his hips involuntarily grinded down on the man, smiling to himself as he felt the sudden hardening of his love.
“No…you didn’t,” she groaned in complaint.
“Where is my kid?”
“HEy! Hey. Hey. Don’t make me call, securritee!” Emerson was not sure how she had any liquids left in her body, any more of this crying – whether from sadness or laughter – was going to give her a headache. She suddenly felt sleepy. Content. So so glad in this moment that those dorks were in her life. On her side. And most importantly, alive. She grabbed the phone as she went to fill up her glass of water on her bedside, interrupting the two children quoting the video back and forth after drinking a little.
After thanking the woman profusely, promising a million favors and an official apology from a sober teen, he dragged the quiet – but somehow fuming – daughter of his up their elevator.
“Wait...Harley gave you the shovel talk?” the Omega asked, pouting as the Alpha chuckled again before they heard a voice from down the hall.
“The doctor said you can’t rush these things, Sarah,” Joe said in concern. It was actually kind of cute how worried the man had been, especially since it made his wife crazy.
The next day Emerson still wasn’t at school, but was waiting for Peter outside with her backpack when the final bell rang. Peter, surprised to see her, ran up to her.
“You sure baby? I could sit next to you while you play,” Tony said before turning to Bucky and Clint, who they’d met before. “Hey guys, good to see you too.”
She stepped out of the elevator and walked into the living room to find Peter and Steve drawing on the couch together. They both looked up and smiled at her, turning their attention to her to greet the teen.
His husband was drenched in sweat, soaking his tank top and plastering his sweaty blonde hair back. His basketball shorts hugged his hips as he rested his hand near them, stopping a few feet away from the brunette. Normally Tony would love the chance to jump his husband’s bones, but he was sweaty and Tony was still wearing his expensive work clothes.
He was taller than Steve by at least an inch, obviously toned even under his expensive looking clothes and sporting an impressive beard. Dirty blonde hair and light brown eyes, guessing he was probably late thirties.
He was looking over some paperwork in the living room when his phone buzzed, a message from Peter.
The genius moaned loudly when his husband grabbed his ass and collided their pelvises together. Tony felt his heartbeat accelerate when, even behind clothing, the two could feel the other party was clearly excited. He let out a whine when Steve pulled back again, holding them apart with his hands grasping Tony’s shoulders.
"Why don't you guys go play some video games before dinner, huh?" Dad asked after the group had settled down from the giggle fest. "The adoption paperwork won't be here until later anyway."
She rolled her eyes as she continued checking the kitchen, anger rising as she thought of how manipulative that woman was. Is. She hadn't seen or spoken to her in months, even if a voice deep inside hoped she was doing okay. Her thoughts were interrupted as a cramp punched her gut.
“I just did,” Tony said defensively. Steve’s chest rumbled with laughter, increasing when the sexy man on top of him joined in.
And as his favorite redhead plopped down next to him, and idea suddenly came to mind.
“Doll?” Okay, that cheesy endearment could probably be attributed to his insecure brain, as he only responded by wrapping his arms around his husband and hugging him tightly. Steve quickly returned the hug, maneuvering the two so they were on their sides facing each other, still intertwined. “What’s wrong? I know you’ve been keeping something from me these last few weeks…” Tony only hid his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, hating and loving his husband for seeing right through him.
"Oh damn she is gorgeous. She just screams regal. Okay, yeah...but you are still on her level and if you don't think so then you will by the end of my magic, okay?" she said with a smile as she parted off parts of Emerson's hair to donate to Locks of Love.
It was a short walk to the store, but by the time she was finally dressed and had also insisted on walking most of the way, they found Buck with a mostly full basket of groceries.
ridiculous,” the man countered with wiggly eyebrows. And honestly? Fuck everything else right now, because this
“I was at recess...and...and now I’m here?” Harley answered with a sleepy voice, adorably snuggling up closer to Steve.
"Amazing, thanks for asking," she said kindly. "Bruce is really an incredible mentor. What's for dinner Steve?"
“If you insist,” he sassed back before obliging his husband.
“I mean…” the brunette interrupted quietly, “by definition it kinda is…” Steve opened his eyes, swallowing some of his anger at seeing his husband.
“Dad –” Peter began.
“Uh…Cap?” Sam asked at the entrance to the break area. Steve and Natasha were sitting on the couch together while Clint and Thor had gone out to get the food.
It wasn’t until Natasha looked up and made eye contact that Bucky finally looked away from the scene.
“Before you get mad…” she started, interrupted by her Pop.
"How stupid is he to pass up on the opportunity to raise such a wonderful pup? The best thing he ever did for you was sign his rights away. You won't have to worry about him anymore." Steve kissed the top of his pup's head, sitting in silence for a moment before a thought popped into his head.
“He’s small,” Harley said quietly, leaning over to get a better look at him.
at the forefront of his mind. “Someone ratted me and Vi out to Fury and she got fired. And I think I know exactly who fucking did it,” he answered before continuing on his journey. He normally tried not to cuss in front of her, but again, he was preoccupied.
He shook his head from those thoughts, focusing on the burgers instead of going down that road. Sam had returned from “grabbing more seasoning” and Steve was thankful for the interruption.
“Why don’t you tell your daughter what you did this morning?” Steve said smugly.
“How about I take Lucky for a walk? Huh good boy you wanna go for a walk?” Barney asked as he grabbed the leash and led the pup out the door, away from the angry atmosphere.
"Finish your sentence, what was I doing just last night?" the blonde said with a smirk. The genius returned the smile as he glared a little at his husband.
All of the warm fuzzy feelings he was having, including when his husband grabbed his hand to hold in the elevator – went out the window when JARVIS made an announcement.
mission?” she asked, suddenly scared of what this all meant. She was happy that he was happy, even if it was scary that he could get hurt. He gently pulled her out of his embrace before sitting her on the kitchen counter, big arms bracketing her sides and bringing his face to her eye level. .
“Love you too Dad.” Tony kissed her temple twice before eventually releasing her. He ran his thumb across her cheek to wipe some tears away, smiling at this amazing girl.
He of course assumed the worst about this man.
Clint still complained about a ‘cheap shot’ from Nat while she drove the three to the mansion. The red head scoffed without verbally responding, throwing a look the man’s way as he poked the bruise on his ribs.
“Like I would ever do anything like that, jeez Pops – “
“Yeah?”
“Should we head back inside?” Steve asked after licking his lips, making it hard for Tony to function enough to reply.
“I’m sorry! Please…ah Daddy…I’m sorry!” she cried. He continued for another moment before pausing to ask her the question again.
Steve tried his best to conceal his laughter but was unable to when his husband's stomach rumbled from his own cackling.
“Maybe you guys should go without-”
“Well, regardless, I think you might’ve effectively gotten rid of our pest problem,” Tony said with a smile as he released the teen.
“Um, no…” Daci said, because technically no one got
“We’d like to thank everyone for coming to this special dinner. As you all know this is in honor of the newest member of our family” – a chorus of “here here” was said – “and Steve and I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you all for making her feel so welcome. And – as I am often reminded – I tend to ramble and turn speeches back to me” (this of course earned a few laughs from the dinner guests) “so I will keep this short and sweet. Here’s to my daughter, Emerson Rogers-Stark, god help her for ending up in this dysfunctional family.”
She immediately pouted at him and smacked him with a pillow in disapproval.
And Tony...well Tony was living his best life. He had the perfect mate, two amazing sons, the job he’d worked his whole life for and friends who were basically family.
He’d have to stock up on extra pop tarts in gratitude.
“Ugh, Pop NO ONE says
“Yeah, kinda. He’s all I got,” Clint said more quietly.
Currently, the superhero was sitting on a bench watching his boyfriend and little brother race each other to the swings. His earlier skepticism was silenced by the adorable sight before him as he grabbed his phone to snap a few pics. Wade will make such a great dad one day. Not in the near future...but definitely in the not-too-distant future they'd adopt some or maybe hire a surrogate.
She took a moment before answering, “yeah…I was just wondering something…” Before Steve could ask again, she turned to Peter bluntly asking, “so Steve is Pop and Tony is Dad, huh?”
“She’s your handler, Bucky! You’re not even supposed to be legally dating her! She’s a goddamn SHIELD agent taking advantage of you-”
“What is it love?” Clint asked gently, beautiful face so open and trusting it gave Bucky the confidence to return the favor.
“You think I can’t handle Rogers’ ‘
"You know that for sure?" he asked quietly, beautiful blue eyes shining with tears.
“Tony, you remember that wine you received from Dr. Strange for your thirtieth anniversary? Well it appears Emerson and Peter drank it last night…” Bruce said as he handed the brunette the empty bottle.
apparently, by Asgardian standards, is simply carrying the individual to their destination) Their dads were still away on mission and she felt completely helpless to comfort him. He had locked himself in his room the minute they got home from school for three days, not even coming out for dinner.
Which meant Steve would’ve somehow acquired two mirrors to get it…
“Yeah well you were taking too long,” she muttered back to him in a childish way, making Tony think maybe she was younger than he thought.
“Try?” Bucky asked with amusement, scooting back to lean against the headboard.
“I was just taking these to the kitchen, I’m not busy. What do you need help with sweetheart?” Steve asked as he gathered the rest of the dishes to take to the kitchen.
Leaving his cup in the kitchen, he walked directly to her room to make sure she was okay. Both his and (one of) Tony’s cars were parked outside, and she always greeted them or at the very least grabbed a snack when she got home.
So, it seemed like they were on the same page. He hung out with Harry after school and in his lab. Miles had made copies of Peter’s notes, omitting any indicators that would reveal Pete’s identity.
“Ack!” she squealed beneath him on the bed, which suddenly shifted as another weight was added on top of her.
“You were the one who fell from the gym ceiling, you dumb fu-”
“You still wanna do this bambino?” Tony asked, secretly wishing for a different answer. But his stubborn pup nodded before grabbing his Daddy’s hand and leading the three inside the mall.
Bucky and Clint were going too, which maybe their teasing was why something sat wrong in his stomach. His younger sister Becca was probably going to throw some snide remarks as well, but he was pretty used to the sixteen year old’s sass.
, his mind supplied by the sweet scent coming from the brown eyed beauty. Curly brown hair, doe eyes and smelling of coffee and honeysuckle, Steve couldn’t help but stare.
“I expect you to try your best,” Steve added after taking a step closer to his girl. “For me?” She rolled her eyes again before agreeing with a ‘fine.’ The blonde leaned down to kiss her temple before standing up and walking to the door.
MALE, LATE 30s, INTOXICATED, SUFFERED BURNS FROM A 'FLAME THROWER' AND CUTS FROM BROKEN GLASS
"Not living here he isn't," his Pop spoke up, but Peter stood his ground.
They were about to resume their conversation when they heard multiple footsteps approaching. Howard and Steve joined them, neither looking injured or particularly upset. He looked at his Alpha who offered Tony a smile.
“You’ve been holding this for a long time, Emerson,” she said quietly, as if she didn’t know. “Thank you for telling me. I’m…I’m so sorry.” She looked up at that, staring at the woman in disbelief.
She pulled away at that, frowning at him even when he smiled back at her.
Steve dated girls. They didn’t last long…but he was a teenager. And he was too busy to date anyone for very long, anyway. Doesn’t mean he’s gay.
“Hell no, you didn’t do anything wrong. Except, again, choosing Stark…”
But finally,
“Your phone’s been blowing up,” the brunette said after a yawn, reaching over to grab the phone on his bedside table to hand to Steve. He saw him glance at the screen, cheeks turning pink when he noticed Steve noticing him.
They could barely keep their hands off each other on the way back, starting to undress in Tony’s living room and finishing in his bedroom. There were three rounds total, each one as mind blowing as the last. Tony lay there panting after the third, sighing when the knot deflated enough for Steve to pull out.
“Shit,” he muttered to himself, holding the phone to his ear to listen to the voicemails. His phone beeped to indicate low power, Steve cursing under his breath again with frustration.
“Now that Barney’s back, where do you sleep?” Clint couldn’t help blinking for a few seconds at the teen’s ability to switch from sexy talk to mundane topics so quickly.
“Not important right now, Peter,” his husband interrupted sending his son a
They sat in silence a moment longer before her Pop spoke up again.
“Liar liar, plants for hire.”
“Me too,” Steve said smiling.
the AI replied as Steve stood up as well.
“I love you too, Joey,” he said before quickly enveloping her in a hug. She chuckled when he squeezed her tighter, feeling his kiss her temple before releasing her.
squeeze up in his chest again, the pain of seeing her in pain hurting the man. He wrapped his arms around her protectively and squeezed her close to his chest as she stayed curled around herself.
“Twenty minutes?” he asked, hoping it wasn’t too soon.
“No, I’m serious. You think I’m actually attracted to this?” he said, pulling away and pointing dramatically at Steve – who was now glaring at the man.
"Aunt Tasha??" they asked incredulously, getting the youngest to gasp as well in realization.
,” she said condescendingly, “left lunch in such a hurry last week she forgot her scarf. I was hoping you could give it back.” She reached into her purse and thrust a purple scarf that he’d definitely seen Jo wearing into his arms.
“Remember when I was so sick I was firing from both ends?” He immediately grimaced, hands going up to his face as he groaned at the memory. She didn’t stop the laughter this time, enjoying the way he pouted at her for it.
His face didn’t read pity or anger...the beautiful man was just smiling back at him.
“Yes, thank you for the wonderful food,” Thor said sincerely with a beautiful smile, taking his plate to join Sam on the couch.
“But first you should also finish your drink, cause shit’s about to get real,” she said with a smile, the teen unable to hold back a genuine laugh at that. She nodded with a smile as she easily obliged the request. She let out a small burp after, smiling when May nodded with an impressive look on her face.
“I’m not defending her-”
“I brought some stuff for him, I’ll be right back,” James said with a shy smile before leaving the apartment. Clint took that time to pick the puppy up again, holding Lucky close to his chest as he tried to convince himself this was still real. It wasn’t some dream he’d have to wake up from.
Not that they were rare, he just always enjoyed kissing his love.
"Yeah! 'cept they didn't really look like tigers, Poppy."
“No,” she cried again, sitting up and pouting at the man.
“It was a celebratory kiss, Rogers! Quit being such a prude,” Clint spoke up.
…there may have been an incident where she and Steve were out…and he didn’t want to fight her anymore so he let her just wear a diaper to the farmers market. And she took it off. And ran away from Steve. And it was surprisingly difficult to convince a police officer that the naked toddler screaming bloody murder about wanting to stay naked – was in fact the teenager’s niece – and also he wasn’t some pervert.
CLINT
The first time he felt pain through the bond, it was the worst pain he had ever experienced. Steve had been shot in war, watched his brother’s arm get blown off, but it didn’t compare to the pain that came through his bond.
“Uh huh, why else?”
“Of breast cancer,” she whispered out. A heavy weight suddenly crushed his chest, because goddamit
“Oh, bear,” Steve cooed. “You were only mean to me cause you were protective of your Daddy. And of yourself. I don’t blame you for that, Harley. And lately you’ve been nothing but nice to me and the world’s best big brother to Peter.”
. You know their brain’s were the size of peanuts, right?” Harley asked, momentarily distracted as he proceeded to tell the Alpha just how wrong he was.
“Alright, which one was it?”
A crowd had formed, the other tables pausing to watch the game.
“Hm, your Daddy and I haven’t agreed on a name yet. Any ideas?” Steve asked the pup in his arms, who looked like he was deep in thought.
Maybe her dad never said anything to him.
A flood of relief washed over him like a gentle wave.
“It was a hard fought battle, but we claimed victory in the end!” the voice boomed, suddenly reminding both her and her father who it was. They shared a look of relief before they continued walking, turning with a smile to see Thor standing in the middle of the room. She had almost forgotten him, as he had flown back to Asgard after he helped rescue her father.
“But you’re chicken shit if you don’t call him,” Sam whispered under his breath.
“We have a problem,” his husband said seriously, greeting him at the door. It was a little before noon on Halloween and the super soldier just remembered that fact as he stood at the entrance panting and noticed a jack-o-lantern sitting outside.
“No, no no no” Steve reassured her as he quickly wrapped his arms around her middle and brought her back into his lap.
Which meant...it was an experience the six year old has had before.
Clint made her confident and made her Tati so, so happy. Like the happy she had always wished for him. Even when they were kind of gross and kissed everywhere, she didn’t mind. They were happy.
“You’re sure you're alright though, Tony?” Joe asked apprehensively as he approached the two, concern in his voice that put a big smile on Tony’s face.
“But…” Harley said, confusion on his face as he looked back up at Steve before realization dawned on his face. “You mean...you?”
“Okay guys, I should probably get back to my kids. And yes I’m including my husband,” Peter said with a smile as he turned back to his dads. The two stopped arguing in favor of pulling the grown man into a group hug.
“- Tony, baby stop. You are an amazing Daddy and Harley is a great pup. We won’t know what’s got him all upset until we talk to him. Well...maybe not me, since he thinks it's my fault,” Steve said with a chuckle, somehow genuinely calm right now. Unless he was somehow masking his scent…
“No no up up! Again!” Jackson protested, wiggling his body and tiny arms up.
Bucky couldn’t help but scoff at that, thinking of what being an Avenger had gotten him so far.
May looked hurt at that confession, but quickly snapped out of it to answer.
…which meant the scream had actually come from the adult man, since both kids just looked confused but calm at the adults.
“Alright, I’m going to go shower and when I come back I’ll make us some hot chocolate,” Steve said before walking towards his bedroom, not waiting for the man’s response as he made his way to clean himself up. There weren’t any loud objections, so he decided to take a quick shower, wondering when Tony would be done talking to Peter before the boy fell asleep.
“Tati,” she groaned, wiggling her arm free when it really started to hurt. He let her go immediately and momentarily looked guilty before he steeled his face again. She watched as he reached into his pocket and pulled his phone out, pressing some buttons as a yellow taxi cab pulled up in front of them. They were both quiet as they silently got in, Daci deciding not to apologize until they were back at the Tower.
