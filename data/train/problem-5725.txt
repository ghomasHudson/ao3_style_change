“Maybe it’s time you marry as well.” Hela noted before walking away and Nertha went after her to inquire forward on the matter.
He was frantic as he gave birth. The room was hectic, and Tony screamed in agony at each contraction. There was a scare when Tony’s heart had stopped for a few but very crucial seconds. The babies were suffocating, and the doctors had to work fast. They put an oxygen mask over Tony and proceeded with the removal of the babies. When the first baby was pulled out Tony was already breathing on his own again.
"It's not your fault. People are so evil." Steve informed him. Tony was a good man. Kind, honest, caring. Just a good person and Steve wanted to make him happy.
“I’m sure.” Tony stated and Anna released Stephen who held onto his bleeding neck as he walked away. Tony and Anna watched with satisfaction. Steve wasn’t oblivious to their expressions of joy, but they weren’t killers. Strange didn’t deserve to die.
After ending the call with Tony, Pepper got to packing containers of food and then Amelia walked in. She’d seen this scene before. There was only ever one reason her mother would be packing food.
“I don’t think it will ever be like that until they forgive each other. But I get why your mother never could. It’s almost unforgivable. And if he does, who’s to say he won’t do it again?”
“Mr. Rogers’ Medical Records.” Tate explained to the room. “Mr. Rogers has been on a countless number of drugs for mental illness. Some doctors may even say this much, must be addictive.”
Steve nodded in agreement. Morgan released her father from the hug and kept her head rested on his shoulder for comfort. Steve soon noticed Peter hadn’t said a word even though this information wasn’t new to him. His voice which was filled of concern broke through Peter’s thoughts. “You okay Pete?”
Pepper brings Morgan and Nicky to see Tony twice a month. She and Steve drive together but Steve stays in the car. He doesn’t want to see Tony. He doesn’t want to see the man that caused him so much pain all those years ago. He doesn’t want to see the man that tried to take his son away from him. And Pepper understands that so she doesn’t mind bringing little Nicky along with her to their visits to Tony. Steve's mind is at ease too because he’s just outside in the car. Nicky is with someone he trusts. Tony is a room full of people and multiple guards watching him.
The girls accepted that. They knew this was expected of Torunn as future Queen and she was no rule-breaker.
“I’m going to see my doctor tomorrow.” Peter began and Wade hummed. “I think I’m going to get the shot.” He’d just have to be consistent with his appointments and they wouldn’t have to worry about pregnancy for a while especially since Peter still had another year left in high school.
Steve got down to his level, trying to help him up and calm him. He shot daggers at Nat. He had asked her not to mention anything to Tony. They could have avoided this. He didn’t want to be held responsible if anything happened to the twins. Now wasn’t the right time. This couldn’t be good for the twins.
“Amelia’s acting so odd, lately.” Pepper supplied. They were seated on the rug-covered floor of her living room, their backs against the feet of Pepper’s sofa and an assortment of chocolate displayed between them, with half-drank wine glasses resting on the coffee table.
“Because even though she hurt me just as much, she wasn’t the person that took vows with me and swore before God and all our family to love and be faithful to me.” He shouldn’t blame
"But he still has some unresolved feelings. He has a lot of anger still." Steve noted, wiping his eyes with the tissues he was offered.
“I intended to take this secret to my grave, but Remy LeBeau found out and he –” Natasha explained, sighing.
Harley looked appalled and burst out into a laugh. “Dad, I assure you, that wasn’t her first time. I mean –”
“So, are we going to talk about you being pregnant?” He spoke, staring up at Tony with curious eyes. Of course, Steve knew. How long though, Tony was left wondering for only a minute.
“You can control it though, to some degree. I know.” It wasn’t a question. Xavier had said she could. She knew she could too.
He worked on her clit before slipping a finger into her core. Torunn groaned and Harley paused but she insisted he proceed. Then he slipped in another finger, curling them hoping to get her off. She came around his fingers, arching her back.
“Yeah.” She responded, glancing back down on the sketch before her and back at him when she heard Harley groan. “You okay?”
Steve only became aware of Tony’s presence when his name had been spoken. A smile spread across his face as he registered the voice in his head. He couldn’t be happier holding his new-born and having the person he loved most here for him. His ecstatic blue eyes met Tony’s gloomy brown ones and Steve’s joy shattered, seeing the pained expression and unmissable wounds on his face. It was mostly bruised; only one particularly deep wound stood out on the side of his face and his eyes were red. It was clear to Steve that Tony had also been crying.
“Hey.” Jaime spoke out, pulling Morgan from thoughts. She blinked a few times, focusing on the source of the voice, realizing her phone was in still in her hand. “You okay?” The 17-year-old asked, rubbing one hand in his red mane of hair – Romanov red. Only Aunt Natasha, her sister and her children had that red colour. And his blue eyes filled with concern.
He left, sparing a glance at an angry Morgan, a shocked Peter and a sympathetic Tony. It was like nothing to him now.
Honestly, Wade just needed Peter to be 18. He couldn't bring himself to do it before that but somehow, kissing was okay? While Peter just wanted to do it for the first time and move on.
“I can’t make it to the project launch tomorrow. I’m sorry.” Their long-awaited project was finally being put in effective tomorrow.
“Huh?” Tony ceased his movements. He was almost out of his pants now and ready to curl up under his bed covers, alone.
“We can’t make any promises.”  Bucky informed her, giving her a serious look, and she nodded to let her papa know she was listening and that she understood. He and Sam had been trying for years but there wasn’t any right way to tell a 10-year-old their parents stopped trying for a baby after so many years of failing.
Peter took Wade’s hands in his. He was silent for a while and Wade was starting to regret what he’d said. Then Peter released his hands and wrapped his arms around Wade’s waist. “I love you too.” He whispered and Wade embraced him.
“I never intended to ever talk about this with anyone but your mother or your Uncle Bucky for the rest of my life.” He declared, observing everyone’s expressions. Morgan had a hand over her mouth, trying to conceal her shock. Harley was gaping at him in disbelief while Peter visibly shivered from hearing the actual words. “But when Peter overheard me and your mother discussing this at Peggy’s funeral, I figured I should let you all know. And yes, it was Peggy. She took advantage of me and I didn’t know any better.”
“But not on Quill. Father says he’s an idiot. And he’s like 40. He’s our parents age.” Torunn reminded her.
Sam broke his train of thoughts. “Look man, I mean this in the nicest way possible but maybe it’s time you move on from Tony. He seems genuinely happy with Strange.”
“It’s confirmed.” Pepper swallowed a lump in her throat when she thought of the explosion incident again. “He thinks they share the same powers, which is rare apparently.” Carol hung on to each word. She always enjoyed talk of super-enhanced abilities. “He also thinks she might have more.”
“You’re so good Steve.” Tony remarked. It was breath-taking how accurate it was. Steve’s arms came wrapping around him, settling on his bump and his chin hooked in the sink of his shoulder.
“You look ravishing.” Stephen complimented Tony, giving him a kiss on the cheek. Tony led him in and over to the grand Christmas tree in the corner so he could add his present to all the others surrounding the tree. Everyone was asked to bring a gift for at least one other person on the guest list. They would be opening gifts together in the morning.
“Are you, serious right now?” his eyebrows raised but his voice stayed level. Steve knew Tony was the angriest whenever he was the calmest, as he should be. He had every right to be. He’d broken his trust.
“Really?” He watched her expressions change. “You’re not attracted to him, are you?” He had to ask, fearing that this might not go over well if one of his best friends had somehow fallen for the man who was dating – he gagged at the thought again – his murderous daughter. So murderous that she had intended to kill him and Steve without battling an eyelash.
Tony placed one leg over the other and leaned back in his seat, arms folded behind his head. “Never better.”
In typical Asgardian fashion she was at that young age where she could start looking for a potential husband. Torunn wanted nothing to do with that. But tradition was tradition. Not even Asgard’s King could change that. “I can say I am not too excited about that.”
“You look familiar…” he trailed off. Stephen stayed quiet. “Yeah. You look like um…Dr Strange. Yeah!” Justin put so much enthusiasm in his voice.
“Uncle. Please talk to father. Let him see reason. Does he really want Harley Stark Rogers sitting by my side as I rule Asgard? Grandfather Odin would roll over in his grave.” Torunn cried. Her uncle had only a moment prior appeared in her room at the Stark Mansion per her request.
“Does that mean you want to try?” He whispered. “Or if you need time, you know I’ll wait for you Tones.” For as long as it would take. There was no way he was giving up now.
“But you are.” Harley countered, pulling back a bit but reaching out to caress her cheeks. “And this is your home. You’re Asgard’s future Queen –”
A smile spread across Anna’s face. It would mean the world to her if she got to see her friends again so soon. “That’s so sweet of Mom.” The word sounded foreign on her tongue. She was better off sticking to calling her parents by their first names for a while longer – until she grew used to it.
“Not yet.” Wade explained and Harley shook his head. He was only joking. “Just waiting on Peter to turn 18.” Which was tomorrow.
Anna stayed at Stark Mansion. It was her home now, no matter the circumstances and Peter was still there too. She couldn’t abandon her twin who she’d developed a close bond with. Anna formed a good relationship with Morgan as well so meeting up and spending time together was common.
Peter was starting to think he’d done something wrong or Wade wasn’t that into him any more for whatever reason. He didn’t know. Naturally he asked why.
“No. They’re not.” So much of his body had changed following his pregnancies - his breasts, his belly, his thighs. They were never the same, but Steve loved to tell him how much he loved them all.
Wanda then invited them into her home. She directed them to place their gifts on the coffee table and Steve and Clint got their chance to hold William too. Vision served food and Wanda took pictures of everyone meeting William. She was making a scrapbook of memories for him so he could look back on his early years with his new parents.
Steve didn’t know why he was letting him speak this long, uninterrupted but then Tony’s voice came ringing in his head.
“You know. You’re right. Very Captain America-esque. Should have guessed.” Tony agreed, sending a pic of the banner to Pepper. She oversaw all this fun stuff. Peter was quiet. Tony spoke up. “So you’re talking to me again?” He stared at his son; arms folded over his chest.
“Why wouldn’t I be here?” his voice stayed level, but his jaw tensed. “Tony’s the mother of my children.”
Loki was genuinely appalled. His eyes widened at the news. “Oh dear.” He began. “I never would have guessed Natasha could do such a thing.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Harley James Stark Rogers, if you were here, I’d smack you upside the head.” Getting up from his seat and finally saving the model to the folder with all his work. “I have to go and get ready for a date,” Tony said proudly.
“Really?” Morgan didn’t expect an acceptance of her apology so quickly. She was disrespectfully towards her and no matter the situation, she should have never intruded in her parents’ business. It wasn’t her place. It had nothing to do with her. Now finding out the truth, she realized how much she had overstepped.
“I didn’t think you cared.” Stephen said honestly but his words were a little slurred. He was still recovering.
“Oops. I thought I was talking to Steve.” Tony jeered. He withdrew from Stephen’s hold on him and sat up again focusing on the model.
“But the kids – our kids – deserved to know. I know.” Steve finished and Tony was smiling at him. “Sorry about dinner.” Because he hadn’t apologized for that yet. “Good night Tony.” And there was way too much compassion in those words.
When they came into view, Anna ran over to meet them, taking her baby brother into her arms, to give him kisses and cuddles. Upon further observation of the room, the couple made a note of everyone present - Tony's mother, Sam, Bucky, Winter, and their four eldest children and their significant others: Harley and his wife, Torunn, Morgan and her boyfriend Nathan, Anna and her boyfriend Remy, and Peter and
And I don't really know what happens medically when people get strangled. Luckily this is all fiction.
And Tony releases him, scanning the area for bystanders before speaking, “Is this a joke, Steve?” Because it’s really not funny.
“Mom’s the nicer parent.” Peter added. They rode the elevator down to the home theatre and were greeted by their group of friends. Everyone was so welcoming to Anna. She felt right at home.
Torunn’s stomach rumbled at the sight of the food. It smelled wonderful too. Harley set the plate before her and grabbed her a bottle of water from the kitchen counter and a glass of juice from the fridge. She said her thanks and they ate together mostly in silence.
She stuttered for a moment. “Um. Yeah. Sure.” And he could see a hint of red, gracing her usually pale cheeks. She was blushing. Nertha Heladottir was blushing.
“I went to see my lawyer. I’m trying to get a day with Ellie. I want to be in her life.” He confessed. Peter knew the unfortunate situation Wade was in with his daughter, Eleanor. Her mother made it hard for him to be in Ellie’s life. She said Wade was too dangerous, too destructive. It was bad for Ellie; which Peter could understand but had to go against. Wade was harmless when it came to him. He had no doubt he would be just the same or even more protective when it came to his daughter. Carmelita Camacho had no trust or faith in Wade and so as of right now, she had full custody of Ellie.
T’challa had invited Bucky and his family to join him in Wakanda for the summer holidays. Winter was indifferent about the entire thing; she’d never been to another country before. Sam was ecstatic. He’d been to Wakanda once before and he loved everything about it. He was also anticipating the royal treatment he was confident they would be receiving on account of Winter being betrothed to Prince Azari, Wakanda’s future King.
Steve did feel as if he owed Sharon some sort of apology. He hadn’t been fair to Sharon even though she did trick and use him. He was starting to think he deserved it; his karma in the end. He sighed, running a hand through his hair. He needed to focus on Tony right now.
Goll-Eee. My ideas always start off so good and then they turn to do-do (shit). Do your worst in the comments but I'm already aware of how bad this fic is...
Steve found himself playing with his fingers awkwardly as Tony circled his living room some more before settling down on his sofa. He noticed the baby book Steve was reading prior to him arriving. Tony patted the spot beside him and Steve all too willing obliged, moving to sit with him.
Theirs was easily one of the greatest love stories ever told. A love like that was rare. Steve chuckled, holding Tony close once more after his tears had subsided. “So who’s officiating?” Tony wondered.
“To you Dr Strange.” Justin jested, slapping a hand on his shoulder. Stephen drank the entire thing in one go after which he placed the glass on the bar. He made to leave, when Justin wished him a good night.
The judge asked for order and Tate took the opportunity to close his opening argument. “As you can see,” he addressed the court room. “Mr. Rogers is clearly unstable. That is all your honor.” He straightens his tie and takes his seat by Tony again. Steve finds Tony smirking at him. Tony was positive he had this case in the bag. And Steve could guess from their interactions that they were sleeping together.
“It’s been a long night.” He continued, closing his eyes and getting even more comfortable in bed. “I just want to rest right now.”
“I’m trying to talk some sense into him. I really am.” Pepper explained. “But you can take him to court you know that.” She held Steve’s hands as she spoke. “You can’t force him to be a part of the baby’s life but you can get financial support. He has to take care of the baby.”
“Slow.” Tony repeated. Well, he was going to at least try to take things slow. They were left smiling stupidly at each other when a thought resurfaced in Tony’s mind. “By the way, we need to talk to Anna.” He added and Steve gave him a knowing look.
“Really? Are you okay?” Steve had to ask. He was supposedly happy just a few days ago. He didn’t know things would change so quickly for them. Steve was actually surprised Stephen gave him up, when he would stake his claim on Tony so often.
Visitation was 30 minutes. Tony was given visitation privileges once a week, but Pepper nor Steve wanted to see Tony that often a month. Pepper had been inside for 32minutes now and Steve was worrying, because God forbid something went wrong. Steve got out the car and waltzed right up to the front door. He provided his ID and signed the visitors’ book before he was directed to the visitors area. His eyes met Tony’s first. He smiled that damn smile at him. He hadn’t seen him in two years.
He glanced up to the bartender that was in on his little rouse. “Kids are a piece of work. You got kids?” he questioned, the bartender.
Thor disregarded her words, engaging further into conversations with Steve and Tony. “How did you come to know of Harley and I?” she wondered.
“Hey.” Sam sang out, making room between them so Winter could sit. “What’s up sweetie?” he questioned, staring down at her as she cuddled up into her papa’s metal arm which was expectedly warm from the built-in heaters.
“No one else is in the building, since Mr. Rhodes left earlier Sir. Your mother, Peter and Torunn are the only other people here.” Friday answered. Good. So no intruders had gotten in but it still didn’t explain why Morgan was bleeding.
“I won’t.” Wade promised, taking both of his hands in his. “I can’t take watching you from a far anymore. Not again.” He confessed.
“I ran into Rhodey almost 5 hours ago.” He added to make things clear. “Where were you?” That was five hours unaccounted for and Tony blinked up at him, wondering how much Stephen really knew about Hammer’s deeds. But Stephen’s face appeared more concerned than infuriated. He’d heard about the fight and for the next five hours, his boyfriend was unreachable. That warranted some worry.
“Yes. She said she was working on an invention. She swore me to secrecy so I wouldn’t tell Uncle Tony.” Torunn provided. Anna hadn't said anything about not telling Harley.
“But it works Tony. It works. And now I understand why you were sleeping around so much when you were younger.” Rhodey carried on, trying to justify it all. Tony was only half-listening when a buzzing sound caught his attention.
"Dad." Peter finally spoke up, the younger of his two sons. "Are you sure about this? Harley said you said the same thing about my pops." Harley was only 6 at the time but he remembered meeting Peter's pops when he was already pregnant with him.
A pink flame appeared in the palm of her right hand. Morgan grinned at her. “I’d say it’s going pretty good.”
Bucky almost lost it. “As he fucking should! He tried to kill you.” Buck sat beside him now, looking Steve dead in the eyes. “He was going to kill you.” He whispered and that was the sad truth.
Then there was Morgan who was itching for the day Nathan would propose while she ran Stark Industries along with Harley and Pepper in their mother’s name. Nathan wasn’t oblivious however. He had every intention to propose to his long-time girlfriend in the coming months.
“Only have eyes for you.” Steve added. Tony was confident of that as he went back to his breakfast and a thought came to Steve. “Hey.” He said to get Tony’s attention on him again. “When are we going to tell the kids about us?” He questioned.
“Yeah. Huge.” He humoured her. “I hope you like it sweetie.” He really hoped she did. He hoped it wasn’t too overwhelming. She still wasn’t fully back to her old self yet. He hoped this didn’t stunt her recovery.
“Do my parents know you’re here?” He asked, cautiously after greeting Maria, who just so happened to answer for Wade.
Steve was at a loss for words. He never expected to see Tony ever again. Especially not here and now, holding their son hostage. Steve tried not to make any sudden moves because Tony was capable of anything at this point if he’d already shoved him a lake, tried to strangled him to death and snuck into his hospital room, most of which were while he was pregnant.
Tony had been staying at Pepper’s for an entire month now. He’d just turned 28 a few days ago. He buried himself into work as much as possible and distracted himself with caring for Harley and Morgan. Harley handled the separation better than Morgan did. He would, on occasion, ask where his father was but Morgan had spent most days chanting ‘dada’. Tony’s solution to the problem was usually some ‘mommy and me’ time or some ‘Morgan and Amelia’ time. The two toddlers were inseparable, and Tony was thankful for her and for Pepper for letting him stay in her home. He didn’t want to stay in his home without Steve. He did, however, intend to move out once he got closer to his due date. His mother had offered to stay with him and aid for as long as he would need her. And Pepper reminded him, she and Amelia were only a short drive away.
Today Tony was off from work. He was taking a nap while Amelia and Morgan played together, and Jacob and Harley used Harley’s tablet. Carol and Rhodey had stopped by. It was no question that they’d discussed the whole situation. Carol was so ticked off by it all that she’d almost gone out of her way to find Nat with the intent of hurting her. Pepper and Rhodey who were just as protective of Tony, weren’t as short tempered as Carol, thankfully. She did however get a few hits in on Steve after they had a one and one. Rhodey stopped it right before things escalated out of proportion. Pepper stayed out of it.
“I want a baby too.” To fill the gap, his children leaving home, was creating in his heart. He wanted a baby too but definitely not Stephen’s. And they ended the conversation with a kiss.
On one of the balconies overlooking the room, Sif oversaw everything. She manged to spare a glance at the wedding invitations resting on the table next to her.
“No. We still love each other.” Carol stressed, truthfully. They didn’t fall out of love. She just happened to develop feelings for someone else, as well.
They had devised a plan to make Anna the sole heir of S.I. by any means possible as compensation for the abandonment of Steve and Tony so she and Remy would always be financially stable. Steve and Tony caught on sooner, rather than later, thankfully and stopped them from ever putting their plans into effect. The couple had intended to kill anyone who got in their way as they did with Justin Hammer.
“Sure Ellie. That will be fun.” Wade agreed. Peter adored their conversations. There was so much love and adoration in each word that was said. It was beautiful. He wanted kids one day especially if they turned out like Ellie. Wade loved to argue that she was all her mother, but Peter wasn’t oblivious to the little things about her that he saw right of the bat that were clearly a reflection of Wade.
“This is crazy.” Hope exclaimed. “I hope they find them soon because Tony and Steve have been through enough.” They really couldn’t catch a break.
your powers from contact if you have any.” She scanned the room after she’d spoken, gauging everyone’s reactions. No one seemed bothered by it.
After dinner, everyone disappeared to their respective rooms. Thor helped Sif to bed and then he went in search of Valkyrie. He found her returning from Earth upon arriving at the bifrost. Thor greeted Heimdall, briefly.
“What’s going on?” Stephen advanced towards him, leaning on a nearby wall as he finished with his shoes. It was clear he was heading out and Stephen was curious after Tony had been home and mostly in bed for the last 48 hours.
“Will you answer?” She dared, smiling at him. He nodded in hopes of assuring her. He’d answer any questions she had, if it helped ease her mind. He admired Pepper. He could see she was good woman.
So, it turned out that Tony’s last-minute Mother’s Day Brunch was just a small gathering for “mothers”. He invited all the mothers he knew but unfortunately, some of their children and the fathers also tagged along. Tony wasn’t annoyed at first until fathers like Sam Wilson came along.
Stephen reached out to kiss him and Tony stopped him. “I’m not kissing you. You aggravated me and –” Tony cut himself off when he saw Stephen shaking uncontrollably.
“Your royal highness.” The minister gave Torunn a bow and she in turn acknowledged him. Harley and Torunn then joined hands before the minister and the congregation once the ceremony commenced. As the minister spoke, they stared into each other’s eyes, falling deeper into love, clearly and Harley couldn’t stop himself from remarking how lovely his bride looked. Torunn’s cheeks redden with happiness and she reciprocated, returning the compliment.
“The better question is, ‘who was that?’ because it sounds like he’s totally into you.” Michelle remarked.
It’s just that he and Peter had always had a good relationship being his last baby and he needed someone to tell him he was right. And it couldn’t be Steve because he hadn’t mentioned any of this to him. It wouldn’t go over well with Steve and besides, he had handled it already. The situation was non-existent at this point.
“You can’t change the past.” Wade whispered. The wisest words Wade had ever said to him. “What’s done is done, Petey and it wasn’t your decision to make.”
“Speaking of powers…” Morgan continued on the topic, darting her eyes at Amelia who sat directly across from her. The girls were sitting in a circle. Lila’s empty spot was on Morgan’s left, followed by Torunn, then Michelle, Amelia and then Cassie on Morgan’s right to complete the circle. “How has it been going, working on your powers?”
“Guys, I think I’m going to head home now before my dad realizes I’m not in my room and calls my mom.” Peter responded, swinging off to his father’s house. Ned and Michelle said their goodbyes and Peter hung up. On his way home he spoke to Karen. She was now built into his suit all thanks to himself and he asked her to get all the information there was on Deadpool.
Torunn led him up to the highest tower in the palace. At the very top, one had the perfect view of Asgard in its entirety. “This is my favourite place in the entire palace.” Torunn explained, leaning over the balcony slightly. “Is it not magnificent?” She got no responses from Harley. “Surely even you must be able to acknowledge true beauty when you see it.”
“We should visit them this summer.” Nat suggested. “All of us.” Because last summer, it had just been Nathan while she and Bruce stayed home and had some alone time. It was great being alone with Bruce, she wouldn’t mind doing that again. But she was thinking it would be wonderful to see her sister and her family again. To stay on their farm, do farm work, camp out in the woods and take some time away from the real world.
His red eyes peered into hers and Amelia started to question the things her mother had told her on account of Remy’s inconspicuous powers of persuasion.
After a moment, he got up and helped her with the bags. “You scared me half to death!” Justin took the bags to the kitchen and Sharon followed with what she had left. She began putting things away and Justin leant on her kitchen counter watching her do so.
Tony unfolded his arms. “You don’t owe me an apology. We’ve both moved on.” They needed to keep reminding each other. “You’re free to be with whoever you want, date whoever you want. As am I.” Tony added that last part in for good measure. Steve could sense there was a but coming and he finished Tony’s train of thought.
“And Wakandians, Bartons, Banners, Wilson-Barnes…” Pepper trailed off. There was always some kind of inevitable drama at Tony’s parties and no matter what she did, she could never prevent it because their very large family was absolutely crazy and according to Tony everyone was family. Everyone.
Morgan’s head shot up the moment Steve was standing directly over them. It was like she could feel whenever her dad was near. She called out for her father. Her voice and movements as Steve picked her up, woke Tony. Harley still slept peacefully.
Tony spoke next. “I love you honey.” He kissed Harley’s cheek, and glanced over at Torunn. “Both of you.” He stated, reaching out to hold each of their hands. He looked away for a moment, trying to blink away tears. That was another child he was losing. He sniffled a bit and Steve rubbed his arm soothingly.
“But you love when people suck up to you.” Tony teased, scratching his salt and pepper coloured beard. He’d shaved recently per Tony’s request. His facial hair tended to irritate his thighs whenever he was between them. He never had this problem with Steve. He stayed mostly beardless and when he didn’t, it was never a bother because Steve’s hair was so soft. It tickled instead. Tony knew he wasn’t supposed to compare the two, but he couldn’t help it. Now Stephen’s beard was growing back but he did enjoy playing with the stubble.
“I don't want to hear it Peter. I want to meet this guy.” Tony repeated. “You’re lucky I don’t tell your Dad.” Yeah. He really was. Steve would flip out 10 times more than Tony just did.
It was close to the truth but still a lie – a lie Steve didn’t have to tell Morgan and Peter and eventually Harley, but he did anyways. He’d watch them squirm a little longer. He knew they weren’t actually over it. They did want to keep that secret between the parties involved though, like so many others that Steve and Tony had buried but secrets always had a way of coming out.
“Hey!” Carol answered. Her voice was vibrant, loud and perky. Everything seemed good on her end. Maybe he should have called his dad first. Unlike his mom, his dad wasn’t very good at hiding his emotions.
Suddenly, a flash of light filled the room and Thor and Loki appeared before them. Tony groaned as Thor had successfully ruined his floors with that entrance. Torunn rose from her seat first but Tony spoke up first. She noticed her father’s facial expression wasn’t particularly a happy one.
Stephen gave him the once over, scoffed and turned his attention to Tony –completely ignoring Steve’s words. “Tony.” He breathed out and Steve’s face hardened. “Can we talk?” He went on, glancing up at Steve as he said the next word. “Privately?”
When Steve was gone, Tony made his way into the dining area where his mother had started cleaning. “Honey. You should have known not to ever have those two in the same room.” Maria advised. And Tony knew she was right. Maria offered to finish up and Tony ventured to find his kids. They were the most important thing in his life, not any boyfriend or his kids’ father; only his kids mattered.
Nat couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She never had any intentions to hurt Steve and Tony. Never. “No.” Her voice didn’t falter and if she was lying, no one could sense it.
Tony looked and sounded grouchy as his eyes focused on Steve. He sat up, rubbing the left side of his belly. “Baby. What happened?” There was worry and concern laced in his voice. He’d called and texted Steve so many times last night. He promised he’d be back earlier, and Morgan was waiting for him.
She was covering her mouth, trying to hide a smile when Amelia looked her way again. “Ew.” Amelia finished, making to change the topic immediately.
She took the elevator down to the lab and tried to enter the lab with Harley’s emergency passcode but was denied. Friday only let members of the Stark-Rogers family in otherwise. That was their usual way of access, through literal identification.
Wade didn’t want to have sex with Peter. Peter was sure of it and he couldn’t understand why. They loved each other. They’d talked about being intimate with each other – going all the way, many times before but when Peter became legal at 17, Wade still denied him. He had said he’d never been with another guy before and it was all new to him. He had said he needed time to be ready for it, but Peter figured a few months would be more than enough. In fact, Peter was turning 18 in three months. He thought they’d be ready by now.
“Okay. Talk to you later.” He responded, after which the screen before him disappeared and he found Steve standing a few feet away.
“Harder than I thought.” The process was tedious but also exciting. Morgan elaborated in detail. Choosing the right home was becoming impossible. She and Nathan would have to just settle on something and work on making renovations as time progressed.
“I’m starting to think Nathan isn’t thinking for himself anymore.” Bruce chimed in. Following the revelation, Nathan had had a hard time being around Natasha. He felt like he was fraternizing with the enemy because Morgan was his girlfriend and she wasn’t on good terms with Nat. For the duration of his summer vacation in Russia, which he couldn’t back out of, he’d spent most of his time with Nat’s nephews Jaime and Levi instead.
“You look so happy.” Pepper noted, handing him a salad. Tony took it happily, while they sat on her sofa. “You might even be glowing.”
“I’m not looking to try for a baby anymore…” Tony confessed because though it wasn’t the main reason. It sure was part of it. His baby-making days were long gone. He just wanted to be happy with Steve and grow old together. He would settle with grandkids coming for a visit one day and Tony knew that might be sooner rather than later with all his children partner-up.
Tony’s lips parted as he took a breath. Steve felt his hold on him loosen and he pulled back before slamming into his husband. Tony whimpered and Steve leaned down to kiss him. His hands stayed in his blonde locks. Steve groaned at the assault to his head, feeling Tony’s nails scratch his scalp, then on his shoulders and upper back. His legs wrapped around his waist, using his heels to force Steve as deep into him as possible, making it harder for Steve to roll his hips. They found a rhythm, however. Steve was able to hit his sweet spot with each brutal thrust he made. Tony screamed out with each one. Steve could feel his husband’s erection pressing against his belly and he reached down between their bodies to stroke him until he released, clenching his hole even tighter around Steve’s cock.
Nat and Bruce had stopped by the Barton’s one weekend in September. Clint and Laura were possibly the only two people who weren’t against Nat after learning about her and Steve’s past. They let her tell her side of the story and tried to understand it all. And if Tony had forgiven her, they didn’t see why they should hold a grudge on his behalf. The four of them were seated out on the porch of Clint and Laura’s home. They could see Nathan, Lila, Cooper and Nathaniel out in the front yard while they had snacks and lemonade. School had been open for a couple weeks now and Laura who was a housewife welcomed the thought of being child-free again.
Steve also knew Hammer was due to give a statement soon, that he was preparing to give up his accomplice. Steve was then able to put things together as Tony voiced, Fury’s certainty that the person in question had to be the killer. If they found that person, they’d know who Hammer’s accomplice was or is, if they were still working to bring any harm to them.
she thought. The memory always frightened her. She was afraid of ever trying for a baby and going through the same thing again. She didn’t want to confront that pain – physically and emotionally, ever again. “We’re okay.” Morgan decided. That was the past. They were okay now. He admired her, mumbling loving words into her skin as he kissed her neck. “Something else is on your mind.” She noted.
Harley almost choked on his drink. “A date?” He sat up straight and eyed his mother suspiciously as he walked around his lab putting stuff away and asking Friday to shut down his other computers. “With who?”
“Just how exactly did you meet my son, Wade?” Tony questioned, speaking Wade’s name with so much disgust. Tony kept his eyes on Wade as did Peter, wondering what he was going to come up with. He couldn’t possibly say they met up on a roof one night when they were “superhero-ing”.
“Us.” Peter informed him. Tony rolled their eyes and Maria joined in on the laughter her grandchildren were sharing.
“So, your mom’s gay huh?” Then Harley was talking again before Jacob could respond. “That’s hot.” Harley burst out into fits of laughter, but Jacob knew Harley. He knew he was serious. Jacob was in the middle of getting himself a drink when Harley’s phone went off and put a pause on his laughter. Harley opened the text that had popped up and hurried to his feet.
“Wow. Okay but maybe later. You don’t want to be late for school.” Tony stood up. Peter followed suit and Tony practically shoved him out his room because Steve’s cum was running down his leg and it was making him uncomfortable. “Love you honey.” He finished.
though he had worded it differently. What Anna was, wasn’t something she had learned. It was written in her DNA and Tony had never noticed it before now.
The movie finished, Ned suggested another and Morgan used the opportunity to call out to her little brother. “What’s got you smiling over there Peter?”
And then Peter uttered the words that no parent ever wanted to hear. “I hate you.” Tony’s heart broke and Peter disappeared into his room.
“Yeah Harls. And would it kill you to clean up after yourself sometimes?” Tony was in complete mom-mode now.
When Harley pulled his fingers out, she winced as he started to properly undress. He was completely naked when Torunn gathered herself. She bit her lip at the sight of him and without a second thought, she took control again, flipping him over. She hovered, using his shoulders for support while she sunk down slowly onto his erection and tore her hymen in the process. Torunn cried out in pain. Harley could see a hint of blood on his cock when he looked down at where their bodies joined.
Tony was staring at him and remaining quiet. Steve only realized, when he focused on Tony’s eyes and his favourite orbs of brown were glistening…with tears. “Oh babe.” He whispered and Tony sniffled.
Sam reached out to kiss Bucky when he found him in the kitchen, but he retreated. Before he could ask what was wrong, Bucky let him know.
Harley didn’t respond. Torunn could guess what it was but Harley hadn’t wanted to talk about it for weeks.
Steve spoke up once they were alone. “Tony?” He couldn’t understand why Tony would suddenly have a change of heart. He thought they were on the same page.
Peter was content living in the main house though with Wade for now. They would hope to find a place of their own in a year or so where they could have their full privacy and room for Ellie to visit and maybe for their own kids one day.
“Love?” he tested out the word. “That’s for old people Rhodes. Like my Mom and Dad or your Mom and Dad.”
Harley sighed and eventually got dressed. Steve questioned him immediately after. “What do you think of your mother’s new boyfriend?”
Steve had told him time and time again that he never wanted anymore kids after Peter even though he wanted more but a couple years later and he would knock Sharon Carter up, no problem. It didn’t matter anymore though, right? They weren’t together anymore. He had Stephen. He was happy.
And Thor second guessed himself for only a minute before the newlyweds left the altar and walked down the aisle, white rose petals raining on them. Harley was officially royalty.
“She’s here for you.” Bruce informed her. Morgan nodded. “I’ll leave you two to it.” He kissed Nat’s cheek before exiting the room.
“And welcome to ours.” Sif chimed in, joining the group from the right. Thor was close behind and they all turned to greet each other. Torunn had to remark, how lucky she had become. She knew she had a good husband by her side and incredible in-laws in the family she’d been living with for the past 6 years. Everything was going to be great. She could feel it.
Tony snatched them from Stephen. “It’s really none of your business.” That was harsh. Tony knew it but he didn’t need Stephen Strange making him feel even more like shit right now. So, he walked away but Stephen followed.
Anna chuckled, hugged his chest. “You’d have to marry me first, lover.” She didn’t want to be just a live-in girlfriend. If he loved her just as much as he claimed he did, why not just marry her?
“Well, she asked me about SHIELD the day before Hammer died. That can’t be a coincidence.” Morgan explained, looking over at her brothers for support.
She awaited his advice, but all Loki could provide was, “This sounds like a conversation for your mother. The only person I’ve ever truly loved was my mother, your grandmother, Frigga.” Loki had no experience in the romantic feelings department.
“Yeah you are.” They got to Morgan’s room. She was standing in her crib, her dark hair getting in her face, her eyes red and nose running from crying. She saw her father and instantly lit up. “Dada!” she screamed, making grabby hands at him. Steve scooped her up easily with Harley still in his other hand. She rested her head in the crook of his neck and Harley was rubbing her arm in the attempts of soothing her. He’d seen his mom and dad do it on numerous occasions to comfort Morgan. Steve noticed it. Harley was such a smart kid and now Morgan was content. She had an unwavering connection with her father.
“Mom.” Peter’s voice poured into the room though the overhead speakers. “Do you have a minute to talk?” Tony halted his movements and stared in the direction of the door. Steve decided to take over, jolting up and bringing Tony’s attention back to him.
At that very moment they heard 2-year-old Harley at the door. Steve thanked God they’d locked the door, or their son would have been scarred for life. “Mommy? Daddy?” he called out. “Morgie crying.”
“You’re not my Queen.” Carol reminded her and Sif was sure she was going in for the kill. She wanted her to try it. But Valkyrie came just in time and interrupted their little cat fight.
“Yes. Even better than our wedding party.” Sif had to admit, and it left her with thoughts of their engagement. They were lucky enough to have known each other prior. Not many arranged marriages started that way. Most people were complete strangers to each other. Their daughter and future son-in-law were another rare case. Though not their ideas, Sif and Thor wanted to believe there was some attraction and/or feelings involved that sprouted their night together after Torunn’s 18
He managed to injure Steve far more than Nat because he drew even closer when Tony had fallen to the floor on his knees, screaming and howling. “If you didn’t want me anymore all you had to do was tell me.”
Morgan, Torunn and Peter had just gotten home from school. Morgan and Torunn disappeared to their rooms and Peter lingered in the kitchen. He unconsciously twisted the “W” on his necklace while rummaging around the kitchen to find a bite to eat.
“I don’t think you two have formally met.” Peggy began, pulling Tony to her side. “Captain Rogers.” Steve scoffed at the formality. “This is Howard’s son, Anthony Stark.”
They pulled apart and Morgan was there to hug him next. “Morning mom,” she began. He was just missing one kid; Harley, who was following in his footsteps, off at MIT and studying engineering.
Gamora and Sif followed with laughter. “Do you and Scott intend to have more of your own one day?” Sif wondered.
“But it’s a good idea Winnie.” Sam assured him and her focus was now on him. Before he scooped up his little girl and put her on Bucky’s lap so they could all be closer.
“Tony, need some help here.” Rhodey cried out, breaking Tony’s thoughts. He was struggling with preventing the giant armour from crushing him with one of its metal feet. Tony channelled all his anger into defeating the giants once Friday had located the source of their power. He flew past the armours easily infiltrating Justin’s power source and destroying it. The armours all collapsed leaving a frustrated Justin in the middle of it all.
Tony stood before him. He was dressed in a light blue long-sleeved dress shirt with a vest over it that matched his dress pants. Steve was surprised to see him, and he couldn’t ignore how good Tony looked. He was caught staring when Tony spoke up, letting himself into Steve’s apartment.
Steve put the book down for a second, he was scaring himself. He almost jumped out of his skin when he heard his doorbell ring. He remembered Bucky’s phone. Maybe Bucky had come back to get it. He threw the blanket off him and struggled to get to his feet, pulling his shirt that had ridden up to expose his belly, back down.
Steve gave him a look of resentment and Tony was annoyed by it because Steve had a girlfriend, a pregnant girlfriend for that matter so he really shouldn’t be concerned with what was going on in his love life and Tony voiced this. “Don’t you have a pregnant girlfriend you need to get home to?”
“Always Jake.” Amelia answered. Harley kept his attention on the suit before him while a chuckle escaped his lips. Jacob chose to ignore it.
“I don’t know what I was thinking.” Tony said truthfully. He didn’t know what was going through his head in the moment, why he was thinking what he did. Why he was all for Anna killing Stephen in cold blood, knowing well enough that she would be getting away with it, no problem. Like all her other murders.
“It’s okay. That guy was a menace you know. He killed people for a living.” Tony informed him. Of course, Peter knew.
Peter opened his door slightly, peering out at his mother. “It’s okay mom. We’re used to it.” He explained. And that wasn’t a very comforting thought. He hated to think his kids were going to turn out like him; a product of dysfunctional home. “Good night, mom,” Peter finished, closing his door before Tony could reply.
Tony shook his head. It appeared as if he wasn't able to find the words but after a moment, he finally spoke up. "Alex. He was 19 and I guess I jumped into things too quickly with him."
He and Lila were talking about Volgograd. Nathan always enjoyed his time there. Nat’s family was always kind and he was great friends with her nephews and niece. Jaime would be taking his first trip to the United States in December and Nathan thought he and Lila might enjoy each other’s company, so he asked her to be his guide for the duration of his trip.
“Anna’s sleeping with Remy.” Peter blurted out, because this was the only piece of information that tied Anna to Remy and though he’d promised to not repeat this to anyone, Peter was starting to doubt his twin’s intentions. “And it’s a proper relationship.” He let the information be processed by his siblings. Anna had mentioned she and Remy were serious about each other, stating that they’d starting dating after running into each other at the Christmas party last year.
They stared at each other for a long moment. Tony's eyes seemed lost, his vision blurred with tears of joy until he focused on Steve’s erection, jutting out to the side in his pants. He really wanted to return the favour. Instead, he pulled his pants and underwear back up – he had to get dressed to ride the elevator up to his room. They weren’t home alone after all. In fact, that blowjob was already quite the risk.
“Grandma’s in the kitchen. Dad’s running late and Mom and Anna were just in here.” Peter informed her, as he looked around and focused on the sounds around him. They could both hear voices coming from a few rooms away. They glanced at each other making sure the other had heard and they headed towards source.
Cassie broke the silence that followed. “That was a little unexpected and forward even for me guys.” She resonated with such affairs because she was openly bisexual as well.
“Dr Stephen Strange, Mrs. Stark.” He stated and shook her hand. Steve wanted so desperately to get Maria as far away from him as possible. “Tony and I are dating.”
“Thank you, your honor. Miss Potts, I understand that you were an active part of Mr. Rogers pregnancy.” Pepper confirms this. “And what was Mr. Stark’s part in the pregnancy?”
At Harley’s 21st birthday celebration on Asgard, Thor finally addressed the issue of Torunn wanting to give up her crown. He wouldn’t have it. Sif agreed with her husband and Nertha was all for it if anyone asked her opinion. It would make her
Tony was fixing himself a plate when Morgan and Peter entered the kitchen, that Saturday morning. “Morning guys.”
At the Christmas party, Clint, his wife Laura and Natasha were busy talking when Vision and Wanda joined them. The couple had just flown in to New York, from Scotland after many connecting flights.
Tony gave him a look of sympathy. “Don’t you get tired of all these exams, Cap?” Steve nodded. “Exactly. Let me sneak you out now.” Tony grabbed his hand and led him out the exam room through a secret hallway. Steve was amazed. He hadn’t known that existed but then he supposed it wouldn't be much of a secret if he knew. Tony tried pulling him along again, but he stood frozen, unsure of these plans.
Wade was smiling at him and for the third time that morning, he was blushing again. It wouldn’t be such a bad thing to sleep over at Wade’s and Ellie would be there. They wouldn’t do anything with Ellie a door away. They just had less than a month to go – Peter would be 17 soon and it would be perfectly legal for them to…do the deed.
Peter paused his washing, his hands still in the soapy water and gazed at Wade who was busy rinsing in the other sink. “Really?”
And just like that Tony’s family grew exponentially. Even more so when Sam, Wanda, Pietro, T’challa, Vision and everyone else joined the team. That progressed for the next 10 years.  Naturally, there were hiccups, during that period. One of the most infamous ones being that incident in which Tony and Steve almost destroyed an airport hamper from fighting because Tony had caught Steve in a moment with Sharon Carter and the world dubbed it, Civil War. Sharon had come on to him, but he never did anything with her. Tony didn’t believe him of course because once a cheater, always a cheater. Besides such occurrences the team did what they did best.
Torunn was staring at her father, a silent gasp leaving her lips. She blinked a few times before refocusing. “Father.” She breathed, her tone mimicking a plea. “Why would you suggest such a thing?”
"At least get a flipping prenup Dad so this one doesn't leave u high and dry!" Harley shouted, before storming out the room.
“Your new place?” Steve asked. Morgan nodded. “You need help with anything you let me know.” Tony would be there too if she needed help. The only thing he’d want to change if he could, was the fact that Morgan wasn’t going to college. She was going to start as the new COO of Stark Industries very soon as far as he knew, and then eventually co-CEO. That was pretty good for just being 19 years old and Tony wouldn’t let anyone call it nepotism. S.I. was simply her birth right and she was more than capable of running it.
“Hmm.” Bucky had hummed for a response, patting her shoulder to let her know he was done with her hair. She got up and turned to face her Papa. Bucky shifted her braids over her shoulder, admiring his handiwork – her hair and his gorgeous little girl.
. “Mother, you do remember I’m almost 46 years old with four children, right?” Just 3 weeks off. He hoped she did because she was getter older and he worried she might be forgetting things.
Peter was feeling guilty. He was in so deep with Wade now that they already planned their future together; marriage, kids, a house. Wade was the person Peter wanted to be with forever, but he knew that would not go over well with his parents. Then Steve was asking, “Who’s Wade?” But before Tony could explain for Peter, Sharon also appeared around the corner a hand cradling her bump. She did that every chance she got; proudly displaying her unborn child like she’d won at life.
” Steve assured him, taking the hand Tony offered and disappearing down the hall with him. It was crazy to think how much changed after that day and neither one of them had any idea that they’d just met their soulmate.
Those who weren’t aware of the relationship, were shocked by the union. They couldn’t see that coming even from a mile away but like Hope had told Scott, they were adults, no one had jurisdiction over whoever they chose to date.
“Just waiting on you, brother.” Hela explained after which Torunn approached the trio. She stayed by her mother’s side as they made their entrance on the grand balcony. Nertha, Loki and Hela followed suit. The crowd roared and cheered when the royals came into view and Thor introduced his son, Magni, Prince of Asgard and God of Strength. He favoured Sif more in looks especially with his head of dark hair that was identical to Sif’s.
“And to think I asked Payton,” Her assistant. “To send out so many reminders because I knew you would forget, and you still did.” Tony gave her an apologetic smile.
“I was thinking…” She began, her tone, sounding very professional which made both her parents laugh. “I would like a sibling, please.” She placed great emphasis on the last word and Bucky noted how polite she was being with such a request.
“Dad. I really don’t like what you did to mom. I never did but finding out who it was with really upset me.” Morgan lectured.
Eventually she left the basement and found Harley in the kitchen having breakfast. He kissed her cheek when he saw her. “Hey. Where were you?” Harley asked, brushing her hair back and kissing her cheek again.
“It’s not?” Morgan asked in disbelief, looking up at him from the first time since she sat by him. She watched him pull out his ID for confirmation.
Pepper left Remy with Amelia when they found her. He would see himself out of the party after he’d spoken with Amelia. Remy passed on his gift and shared a hug with her. He spotted Natasha from a distance and the sight of her intrigued him.
“I should mention,” Sif added. “I am almost certain Thor loses portions of his intelligence when he is in the presence of Quill.”
“Sam,” T’challa spoke and their eyes met, finally. “I do not know the nature of your issues with James,” Of course he wouldn’t. Bucky wasn’t one to go around airing out their martial problems. Steve was the only exception. “But I know how much love you two share for each other.” The King continued. “And the child created from that love.” Sam thought of
He'd thought about asking Lydia or one of the other girls to help him buy make up but he didn't want to subject himself to that kind of judgment. He was self-conscious enough as it was, no need to kill whatever confidence he had been building.
Before his despair crept up too close, the door to his quarters opened with a clank and a bang. The tall brunette filled the doorway, a bucket and a set of folded clothes in his hands. With wary eyes that never left his prisoner, he placed both near the heater and backed away. Next came the short blond with a tray. There was a bowl of hot broth, a torn chunk of crusty bread and a cup of weak, hot tea. The tray was placed carefully on a storage unit before he too disappeared.
Stiles drained the last of his third beer and burped loudly, the sound echoing into the quiet of the night around him. His feet shifted, sneakers squeaking on the hood of his jeep as he tossed the empty unto the grass to join the others strewn around. He’d pick them up later, probably, whatever.
He loved how Rodney gave everything, holding nothing back as he arched up into the thrusts, panting open mouthed and making little noises that should really be illegal in several galaxies.
The huge iron wrought gate was ancient and curled with thick vines, obscuring the lawn beyond. In the distance of the vast estate, the huge house stood, shrouded in a thick white mist that curled along the old world spires and carved gothic stone work. The setting sun had lit the mist a pale orange that looked like a distant fire, in complete opposite to the mid-afternoon chill.
“Hey…” Derek tugged at his hand sharply, “We’re too fucking old for that shit. We’ve seen too fucking much… well, figuratively speaking off course.”
As Peter liked to tease her as he gently braided her frizzy hair for school, trying to build up both their spirits to face another day in the hell that was high school. "You always gotta look out for the quiet ones. They are always the bigger threat. Still waters run pretty deep."
Thankfully, the floor was smooth under the thin soles of his boots. He pulled the thick coat closer, eyes taking in every detail as they made their way down the long steps.
He glanced over to the rest of the ship and walked over to the overlook. People were looking to him and he would be the leader they needed.
“It’s not what you think.” He pleaded, staring into those warm and wary brown eyes. “HammerTech has been running a testing program for their bionic prosthesis and I need to get someone unto the program.”
Ringed grey horns curled delicately from beneath the hood, studded with delicate gold filigree jewelry that could not have possibly been made by human hands.
They’d just cleared the step and craggy mountains when the attack came, blue light erupting from below to burst through the air around him. He swerved sharply, deftly navigating through the barrage of artillery as legionnaires were destroyed en masse around him.
With enough patience and belief, he would take to the skies for the first time on the samhain night, with his long black cloak and his crooked hat; flying above the tree tops with the owls and other night birds as was a Witch's Rite of Passage.
Reaper snorted, shaking his head as he shrugged out of his shoulder holster. “Nah. I’m thinking more about connecting at a more instinctual level.”
He met the Doctor's solemn gaze and gave him the full brunt and weight of his royal glare. The man flinched and shrunk back, looking past Anthony's shoulder as if seeking aide.
But Thor wasn’t in any mood to be considerate, not when the source of his distress continued to sit on a chair in the common room for days on end staring blankly out of the window.
He’d been purse holder, clothing rack and impartial judge to some truly varied and scandalous fashion shows and had fought down many a raging boner for his trouble. He’d come away learning much more about women’s undergarments than he ever would have learned on the internet though.
He felt both blessed and cursed, his duty as the Iron King both saving him and damning his broken and bitter heart and soul. Taking a deep breath, he pushed all of his disappointment and pain deep down and held his head high.
Unfortunately, they had the opposite effect on Spencer. He paled and swallowed heavily, plastering on a polite smile to the people who basically hijacked his entire existence and forcing back the tremor in his voice at the idea of spending the next forty five days trapped in this place.
He plucked another beer from the cooler beside him and twisted it open, looking up at the vast beauty of the night sky. He’d discovered this spot on the preserve some months ago, during a flight for his life from one of the latest oogly booglies that had turned up seeking the power of the nemeton. Between researching like crazy, trying to wrangle both Scott and Derek, knocking his head against the stone wall that was Deaton, and trying to keep his dad safely ignorant; he’d barely had time to appreciate the stunning view of the preserve from the sharp cliff lookout.
Talia looked like she'd just eaten something both slimy and bitter and his lips twitched behind his mask. She took a few seconds to slow her breathing, he could actually hear her teeth grinding from across the clearing.
The captain looked at Anthony in shock, his beautiful face hardening with fury. He stalked the few steps between them and loomed over Anthony like some dark behemoth.
The Unlit Mountains loomed in the dark horizon, the bright warmth of the Citadel falling further and further away as each second ticked by. Lush fields of green and crystal blue lakes gave way arid and rocky land, the clear azure skies clouding over and turning dark.
Anthony felt oddly bereft as he passed out of sight, turning back to face the dark maw that opened before him. The strange blue lights that seemed to indicate power in almost everything ran along the walls at eye level, illuminating the tunnel just enough to make out the roughly hewn walls and sloping steps.
Now, with his Wonder Woman socks and thick pile carpeting, he could indulge in a bit of nonsensical behavior. Thankfully, his rings quickly dissipated the negative charge harmlessly before they could build up and give him a static shock.
They ate the snacks and drank the sweet mulled wine that the Athosians made, soft fleece blankets and furs wrapped around their naked shoulders.
With all of them suitably protected from the sun, they waded into the cool waters with varying expressions of pleasure and joy. The sea was calm and so clear he could see the detail of his toe nails. John whooped and dove, swimming along the seabed until he came up on their other side.
The store in question was a Victoria’s Secret and they’d cleared out the small store quickly, dispatching the poor undead manager and dumping her body two streets over. Other than that, the store was relatively clean, had an ensuite bathroom with working toilet and didn’t smell like wet garbage so Xander considered it a win.
"That is wonderful, my friend. I am so happy for you both." Teyla's face brightened with joy. "It would be my honour to stand with you. John had told me about the many rules dictating partnership and mating on earth and I hope that one day we may stand in Rodney's homeland and witness your union there as well."
It was ingenious. He’d seen evidence of the blue lights piped along the carved stone corridors, providing both light and heat to the deep ground tunnels. It didn’t seem to require oxygen or give off smoke, keeping the precious air quality level. There must be some other means of recycling the air, Tony mused. He hadn’t felt a breeze since they’d entered the caves and the air was stale and processed. But it clear and breathing was easier than he’d expected.
It was a man, thin as a rake with drawn cheeks and huge dark eyes and pale, sallow skin. He was taking off the chains, which clanked noisily together as he pulled them around and around through the wrought iron bars. One side of the huge gate creaked open, it's hinges screaming at the movement. It grated awfully on the ears and they all flinched back.
His mouth was open, he was sure. He was also sure that he couldn’t care less if he looked like a complete derp. This was an event the likes of which he would never see again in his lifetime. Maybe even in humanities lifetime. He barely registered when Derek’s arm slipped around him, tugging him close against that firm, warm body.
He'd ended up hurt and bleeding while Scott had been sheepishly sorry. Derek had bitten the inside of his mouth to bleeding to keep from roaring at the witless wolf.
Sencer kept quiet, accustomed to Doms talking about him as if he wasn't there. There was no use defending or explaining his lack of collar. That was no one's business but his own.
Stiles tried to shrug but the weight of the body on his shoulder made it awkward. "I bribed him with Elderberry wine. A whole bottle."
"I don't know, maybe it is from a movie, maybe it's not. All I know is that my gut is telling me that this could be important to the case."
PT was hell and she'd had to run a hellish version of Boot Camp with other soldiers like herself, fitted with all manner of replacement limbs. She'd been beaten down, tossed aside, crawled through mud and clawed her way up from a recovering cripple to a hardened soldier and citizen capable of handling herself as well as, and in some cases, better than her all natural counterparts.
The remaining legionnaire proved stubborn, refusing to leave his side. It was too damaged to lift him out over the mountains to escape and didn’t have enough power to connect to the hive mind.
He glanced out unto the main common area, the skies beyond the floor to ceiling windows were dark grey and roiling, thunder booming in the distance. The weather had been shit for days, dark and oppressive over the city until both the mayor of New York City as well as the governor of the state had reached out to the tower to ask the resident god of thunder to give them all a fucking break pretty please and thank you.
It took them an hour to reach one of the old ceremonial pyres, deep in the thick woods and overlooked by the King's decree that all of the old temples and holy sites be destroyed.
A deep sadness washed over him and he had to swallow down bile. He wouldn’t want to throw up the booze he’d have to shell out a thousand dollars of their ‘miracle money’ for now would he. Especially on the kind beautiful man who looked so at home among the rich, hoi-pilloi.
The legionnaire flagged after a while, switching out its solar battery for a new one. Anthony frowned at the sight. They’d relied so much on solar energy, the legion charging and recharging themselves from Sol’s light. No one had ever thought about how long they would last away from that resource. Even the cold of space was within Sol’s loving gaze.
He wanted to see the man puttering around the lab in one of his old army jerseys or bare chested with Steve’s dog tags around his neck, bright against his darker skin.
He let out a deep breath, happier that it didn’t sound as much as a sigh as before. His mind calmed, his body going boneless as tender fingers combed through his dark hair.
Derek nosed his way up his lover's spine before tucking himself along the younger man's back. He took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. His mind ran on the scene earlier today when Stiles had gone left instead of right, trying to protect Scott.
She slipped on those cheap foldable five dollar flats and pulled the legs and the sleeves of the leotard down passed her heels and knuckles. The latex gloves went on and the hairnet was pulled up to cover her hair.
By the next spring, people were accustomed to dealing with him and he'd already visited several homesteads to diagnose and treat several ailments. One farmer had thanked him as the Witch of the Woods as he was making his leave and from then on the title had landed on his shoulders just like that.
He'd ranted and raved at Tony both at the crime scene and in the bull pen, blaming him for the FBI moving in on their jurisdiction. Seeley had been livid on Tony's behalf, both at Gibbs and at everyone who'd stood around doing jack shit.
Ronon woke groggily, a sure sign that he'd been given the good drugs. He normally forwent pain medication on the city, not wanting his body to get accustomed to the comfort it provided. He need to be able to push through the pain as he did when he was still a runner. Life on Atlantis may be a good one, but he was Pegasus born and until every wraith was dead and their bodies left to rot on poisonous worlds, he would let himself go soft.
Anthony quirked a skeptical brow at the word 'guest' but tentatively took the fabric and shrugged it on. It was thick and heavy and kept the cold from him from his chin straight down to brush against his feet. It felt a bit like donning his armor and that gave him an odd sense of comfort.
They called it Messenger and pundits and pastors screamed that it was doom laid upon mankind by a vengeful god. The rich retreated to their tricked out bunkers if they had them and partied like it was 1999 if they didn’t. People punched their v-card in droves and gave the finger to their bosses/ exes/ families etc. Cults made suicide pacts and churches and temples had marathon prayer sessions.
Ronon wasn't a scholar back on Seteda but he wasn’t open about his level of education either. It helped people underestimate him. It let them speak in front of him without censoring themselves, thinking him no smarter than the wall he was leaning against.
They are half way out of the catacombs when Scott asked, "How did you get Lahey to let us in without raising the alarm anyway? That guy is so intense."
The silence was comfortable between them as he hung up his leathers and pulled off his heavy boots, leaving him in his socked feet. It was strange, like it hadn’t been more than five years since they’d last been face to face. Like they both each hadn’t been changed so profoundly since then.
The night was warm and the air heavy and sweet. The thick material of his Beacon Hills High hoodie was pooled around his waist. The glass of the jeep was warm against his back through the thin jersey and his jeans were old raged ones that gone soft from years of washing.
He nodded, his sheepish smile turning to a frown, placing his flesh hand over hers. "I'm sorry for not visiting you in person. I wanted to but…"
Ronon had been helpless to resist, nodding jerkily as he came hard. Then it was Rondey's turn to be smug for a month, though he agreed to keep his lover's secret. It was Ronon's choice to slot himself into the simple warrior's role but that didn't stop him from ranting to his lover in the privacy of their rooms without having to dumb things down.
There was also Longbottom with his beautiful blue Long Tail Skipper and Granger with her Giant Tiger Moth and its dappled wings. Weasley the younger had bonded with a stunning Madagascar Moon while Weasley the older had ended up with an insanely furry orange Jewel Dalceridae.
It was a small room, cold and dark. There was a small light in the corner and he gravitated towards it. He’d never been anywhere this dark before. Never been so far from Sol’s gaze. He suppressed a shiver, struggling to keep himself calm. He was in the hands of his enemies, far away from home and safety. He walked straight into a trap and had seen his last ally lost because of it.
God, how was he going to do succeed now? Their funds were already so low. They’d all scraped and scrounged and tightened their belts for this one chance and he’d frittered away a part of it so foolishly.
All except the glowing green heart stone that was left behind. His father's stone was a vibrant emerald green, speaking to a patient and restful soul. It matched the beautiful blue that his mother had possessed, although Stiles had never seen it.
Stiles smiled, brittle and painfully honest, and his gut did a little flip when the werewolf responded with a fragile little smile of his own. With a sigh, Stiles tucked his face into the other man’s neck once more, settling in more comfortably; humming contentedly when Derek’s arms came up to hold him close.
He curled to his side, away from the heat that seemed to surround him. He'd accidentally crashed into one of the burning buildings. Karen's voice rang in his ear as he pushed himself to his knees, urging him to get up and out and reporting that one of the rafters he'd stuck his web too had been rusted through and had given away under his weight.
He’d failed. Yet again he’d failed. He ducked his head away from the light as he tried his distress show on his face, his heart beating like a rabbit behind his ribs. Taking several deep and slow breaths, he stood just under the single dim light and tried to concentrate on how he was going to get out of this.
The car rocked as the other man settled next to him, his shoulder warm and firm against Stiles as he leaned back unto the glass next to him. Derek shook his head at the offer of a beer and stared up at the sky in quiet companionship.
"I love you." Rodney whispered against Ronon's skin as he came, "I love you so fucking much. You don't even know."
He’d had different plans for tonight, with the world coming to an end and all. One final movie night full of food, family and a hilariously tasteless marathon of movies like Deep Impact, Night of the Comet and Armageddon. There would be Melissa’s overstuffed empanadas, pizza and greasy burgers for his dad, extra bacon; and one of those huge, body sized bag of Cheetos for Scotty because his bestie loved the stuff with a werewolf passion.
ok... it's getting a little angsty here but i promise it will get better. Poor Tony. i'm  sucker for happy endings and i'm trying really hard not to get too sad with this.
They'd fucked everywhere after that, Naru letting Kiba rub his scent all over him whenever he wanted, pulling out and spilling his seed all over that perfect tanned skin. Kiba was hungry for the man and Naruto loved being desired.  The blond would sling himself over Kiba's shoulders when they talked or curl up in his lap, rubbing his scarred cheeks against bare skin.
Naruto placed one hand on Kiba's thigh, his other hand threaded through with Shika's as he swallowed heavily around the cock in his mouth while clenching around the one in his ass. Kiba growled, utterly enthralled by the sight of those round ass cheeks jumping at every thrust, Naruto's thick red cock bobbing and leaking against his taut stomach.
"Mourn your dead. Celebrate them. But do not seek to join the so quickly." He looked among them , catching their eyes as they sat up straighter, stronger, less broken. "Ours was never an easy life. The Deep Forest was as nurturing as it was deadly. It may have been our home but it is not who we are as a people."
The forest seemed like a great shadow as it grew further and further away, the terrifying golden glow growing behind it seemed to be mocking the sunrise. But the sun didn't rise from the west. And the sun didn't seek to devour all before it.
He could hear the weeping of his people behind him. The  very young and the very old, the weak and infirm. Those who had not been able to pick up a weapon and fight the scourge that had been slowly encroaching.
Stiles let out a huge sigh, yanking the ski mask from his face and letting his head fall back to breathe in the night air. After taking a a couple of sweet lungfuls, he turned his head towards a smirking Heather. "What's the deal with the ooglie boogie that got all our flea bags up in a tizzy? That all wrapped up as yet?"
At that abrupt dismissal, Spencer let himself be escorted out of the room and  down a hall to where a brightly dressed Penelope Garcia stood waiting with a sunny smile and clapping hands. Her Sub, Emily Prentiss, was serene at her side in a wine red pants suit, her gun metal grey collar gleaming from the open collar of the shirt.
"She said that her grandfather, Kind Gerard, gets more and more crazy every day and that her dad has been taking more and more of the royal duties.  She also said that he's been stepping up her training in weapons and matters of state. That's good right?"
The man's eyebrow quirked infinitesimally though his expression didn't change. "She also said that you could be trusted."
She just shrugged at his look of surprise. "I' m not sure how he did it either. But I'm glad he did. We lost the ancient outpost when the shield eventually gave way and it flooded but since Rodney doesn't seem to broken up about it, none of the other scientists are complaining either."
“We will find them and burn them all the way to their blackened hearts.”  He gave the council a solemn nod before standing, his soul mark pulsing under his armor.  “I will not fail you again.”
As Penelope tucked her arm around Emily's waist and led them all further down the corridor, talking excitedly about Spencer's stay at the mansion; the true magnitude of the situation finally hit him.
He was just about to respond to her verbally, coughing against the smoke when a burning pain lanced along his shoulders. A long heavy beam had fallen and was pinning him down. He gave a strangled yell, unable to get his hands under him to push up against the weight.  He heard both Karen's and Tony's voices over the comm but couldn't get in enough breath to reply. He coughed harder, the smoke in the room was getting thicker, ash covering the floor and what of his uniform he could see,
His personal finances would take a big hit and he already had JARVIS liquefying a few of his superfluous assets. It's not like he hadn't taken losses before. He was more than just his bank account.
“My spies are being discovered far too soon for them for them to provide suitable data.” Rhodes growled, “Those penumbra scoundrels may just have some luck on their side. They are getting better at slipping away from our grasp. It doesn’t make sense. They’ve always been a rag tag group, hardly able to come together enough for a decent skirmish. It makes no sense for them to be so…”
He gestured to himself and his two fox kin. "I got jacked and made into a meat puppet by an ancient evil fox spirit and almost sent the world to hell in a hand basket. After that we all agreed that the Nemeton and you Canis Lycaons are no touchy for the good of everyone involved."
“The poet in me would kiss you breathless, making sure you never want or need to leave my arms.” Spike’s teeth scrapped against the soft skin of his neck and Xander shuddered with shocked pleasure. “The demon in me would thow you down right here and claim you, pushing that little slip of cloth to one side and fucking that sweet ass deep until you screamed my name. You’d be mine and mine alone and I’d never fucking let you go.”
Shika shifted, guiding his cock to the blond's open and panting mouth. Naruto was too happy to suck on the engorged organ, licking the leaking and swollen mushroom head before taking more of the veined shaft. Kiba let his hands roam, petting and stoking that sun gold skin as both men worked their cocks deeper. He pulled Shika close and claimed his mouth, making them both moan as they rocked into the blond from both ends.
Thankfully they'd had more than a month's warning from the city, when what seemed to be meteorological labs had powered up all by themselves. Seeing that the city hadn't done that kind of thing before, Rodney had made it a top priority and set a crack team of scientists on it immediately.
He kissed around the fresh bandage stuck along Stiles' flank, tentative fingertips gliding along the edge of the rough gauze. He whined a little at the scent of blood and Stiles grunted and ran fingers through Derek's hair comfortingly.
He kept the cottage tidy. Took care of the cats as he learned learned their moods. He harvested from the overgrown gardens and took gifts of milk, sweet honey, fresh flowers and juicy, fat grubs to the creatures of the great forest. Renewing old truces with the beings that lived in the mist and the magic of such old growth.
His eyes stung as he seriously thought about scrapping the entire night. They ladies at the Jungle would understand right?
And just like that Steve’s balloon wilted. Tony must have seen the devastated look on his face because he reached forward and grabbed his arms.
He wanted to…. Sol, he wanted to feel the man against him. He wanted to taste him and touch him everywhere. He wanted to feel his weight against him, their bodies slick with sweat and heated together against the cold. He shook off the very thought of it. It was too painful to contemplate.
They looked out unto city for a while, its tall spires of gold and glass gleaming in the eternal gaze of the Sun God Sol. Sol was waning, reaching its lowest zenith in the east. It would never truly set for Sol never removed his gaze from the Sunlight Kingdom, but sometimes he would slide low enough to form antumbra shadows in the west.
The voice was asking his permission to touch him and he managed to nod shakily. He was pulled from the car gently and made to sit on the curb, his head tucked between his knees as a the gently hand gently rubbed his back.
Anthony kept his gaze on the man before him, clenching his jaw and refusing to be the one to look away first. He said nothing, letting his silence speak for him. He would give them nothing. The Iron King did not parley with rebel scum. The Iron King crushed them under his boot.
The hand on his elbow jerked but stayed where it was, though the touch was a little more tentative. “Uh… Hammer? Really?” the voice sounded a little choked. “I can’t really see it. You and Justin hammer?”
"Sanctimonious bitch." he growled as he ran the preserve, feet swift and silent amongst the yellow red carpet of fallen leaves. "Sending along a fucking summons like a king on her throne. Too fucking high and mighty to just call me herself."
Duo liked the solitary life though. yeah, he enjoyed talking and socializing as much as the other guy but for the past few years, he'd appreciated the long silences of space. He made sure to keep in contact and put in for his down time though, whenever the quiet got too stifling or the nightmares too real.
"That boy is so pussy blind I swear." Stiles rolled his eyes. "I guess I can't fault him too much, if I liked pussy as much as I like cock, I might still be following Lydia around in a besotted daze."
"Very well then…" Rodney's eyes were as blue and the waters around them, pink dusting his cheeks. "Race you to Teyla. Loser has to carry whatever stones I pick up later to study."
He could not even bury her properly. Give her the old rites as all the old chieftains had done. He would never be able to see her off to the underworld with fresh fruit and meat, feathers, soft furs and jeweled stones as was befitting of her stature and grace.
Her soft step swished against the thick rugs that lined the cold marble floors. She smelled like citrus, her flame red hair falling loose around her shoulders. It had been quite a scandal amongst the court as she was happily bonded, her mate Hogan too smitten with his wife to care that she didn’t curl and pin it like other bonded ladies of good repute. She set the tray laden with his meal at his elbow, nudging a few of his little mechanical trinkets out of the way carefully.
The genius' eyes had gone wide when Ronon had presented it to him as a courting gift, torn between racing to the labs to compare it to the database and jumping Ronon's bones right then and there. Thankfully for Ronon, sex won out and they'd tumbled into bed for a night of enthusiastic sex.
He carefully set down his cup and traded looks with his mother across the table, both mentally shoring themselves up for the fireworks that were sure to happen when his father eventually found out. Leave it to Potter to claim a legendary steed before Choosing Day had even begun. Now they were never going to hear the end of it.
He threw the empty bottle unto the grass, hearing it clink against another. The forest was quiet around him and he could hear the blood rushing in his hears. The show would be starting soon. The very comet that had threatened to destroy them all would be passing overhead in a few minutes and he had one of the best seats in the house.
The elevator door's opened and she stepped out confidently. The tall blonde sitting on a nearby pile of gear looked up with a sneer then did a double take, almost tumbling out of the careless sprawl he'd been effecting.
He looked away, staring unseeing out into the night. “It’s Bucky you see, he’s my best friend. My brother. He lost his arm out there. A few seconds later and he’d have lost so much more. I’d have brought him home in a body bag.”
After two months of making time for each other, Lamar finally invited Tony up to his small apartment. Tony felt honoured, touched to be welcome into such an intimate space. Everything in small apartment said something about the man, laying him open in a way that Tony was certain few had ever seen.
She didn’t reply, only laid her hand on his shoulder in silent support. He gradually relaxed his hunched shoulders, feeling the warm of her palm through the thin material of his night shirt. It had been a while since he’d been touched so casually, most of his time spent amongst his people in full armor.
The shadow leadership would die, the Captain, his inner circle. Those responsible for the burning of the forge at North Pass. The Penumbra horde would be left leaderless, scattering like the roaches they were before the blazing wrath of Sol.
He gestured with his hands, eyes growing bright as he continued to speak. “Of course I’m going to have to test this stuff out so I’m going to need Bucky’s help and any other vets you know to come help me out. It won’t be free of course.”
it had been a hard, messy and miserable job and he'd had to drag the half dead jounin back to Kohona with Hinata limping along side, all of them utterly exhausted and disgusted. He'd been the only capable of briefing the Hokage, with both his teammates having been sent off to the hospital. Tsunade had been stoned faced during the meeting but at least the job had been successful.
Thankfully, Teyla managed to distract both men before things got too 'rumble in the jungle', keeping them both occupied until they emerged from the thick tree line unto a breathtaking sight.
"Indeed. This one has balls." Hotchner's lip gave a small curl, his eyes glinting with interest. "Makes me wonder why some opportunistic Dom hasn't put a collar on him yet."
They both looked after her as she strode from the room before turning back to each other. Riddick grinned, shrugging so that his shackles clanked.
They discussed the evidence, which turned out to be discarded egg casings from a beetle that wasn't at all native to the state. Tony made quick notes on his phone to follow up and then set the device aside. Conversation was easy after that, Lamar was so passionate about his vocation and even though Tony could take or leave most creepy crawlies, he was fascinated by the other man's wealth on knowledge on the subject.
"Oh my little Duckling, this Is going to be so amazing." The happy blonde squealed, pulling Spencer into a tight hug."I knew that when I recommended you that you and Hotch were going to hit it off right away."
"Didn’t Carson brief either of you on this?" Rodney gave her a disbelieving look. At both Teyla's and Ronon's confused expressions, he turned and gave a helpless look at their team leader. "John."
His heart twisted when his mate didn't respond, still unconscious as the waters crept higher. Rodney took a breath and looked around, taking in every crack, crevasse, nook and cranny for something that would change their dire circumstance.
After that, it was quick work to get the drop on the rest of the crew and they too, were secured and stowed in the back of the large cab. The sight of the legionnaire surprised them, the captives drawing back from it whenever it went near them.
He kept his hands on the were wolf, cupping his cheeks. Derek was hot to the touch, his skin prickly where his ever present five o clock shadow grew. He looked so perfect, kneeling there, with the ears and the collar. Stiles could just kiss him.
Sirius Black, Steed Master and husband of Master Trainer Repus Lupin, strode toward the hopefuls and gave a short, curt speech. Gone was the usually gregarious and laughing man they usually knew. In his place was the Master of the Choosing and one would decide their fate today.
Wufei wasn't one for interior design, function over all else was what mattered. He had a kitchen for cooking, a bed for sleeping and a not so hideous formica dining table to spread out his laptop and load of course work.  He'd unpacked his luggage the first day, having little more than a few boxes of personal items. The rest of the week was dedicated to getting all of his paper work completed pre-registration and unpacking the crates of books he couldn't leave behind.
The brunet smiled wide and squeezed his elbow. “He won’t need it because I’m going to build him a much better one.”
"It's Sedanwe, a pre cursor to Setedan language. It's been dead long ages but we still used certain words and phrases In modern times."
The day he'd swaggered back into school, baldly talking about "Penis Parker" getting what he'd deserved, the plan had been birthed in her mind. After that it was simple cause and effect. Turn the tables and let the universe take care of the rest.
He turned to face Rhodes, allowing a slight frown form on his face. “The attacks on the Solar Forges are becoming a concern. They may not be strong enough for overwhelm the fortress ramparts but one of them may get lucky. To lose a forge to sabotage would weaken the others.”
She'd died in childbirth and she'd been one of the last to be burned in the old ways until the King had chased away the dragons and stricken all Ancient Lore and Rituals from the Archives in a fit of grief stricken rage.
The stranger blinked at him in confusion before his face morphed into disbelief. “You don’t recognize me do you?, gorgeous.”
"No." Derek growled low, willing the red from his eyes and he tucked his face into Stile's neck. His lover scoffed. He knew him way too well.
It seemed to be based on a chemical reaction and Tony dropped to his knees before the bulbous looking metal contraption, his sharp and eager eyes taking in every weld and rivet. His placed his hands close, delighting in the delicious warmth being pushed from the welcoming light.
“I’ve often wondered what it would be like to come after you. Your reputation precedes you.” The hunter bit his lip, shifting his hips. “But then again so does mine.”
“Yeah I guess…” Stiles nodded sagely. “It would be more like Acute Sensory Perception since you’re still within the five senses. Man, I wonder….”
Two hours into getting ready, he'd gotten a text from Scott, begging off their plans because Allison wanted to go to Jackson's epic Monster Mash Bash. Lydia had invited them, sans Stiles, and Allison really wanted to go.
Private Isabel "Dizzy" Flores checked her appearance in the reflection of the elevator doors one more time. Her uniform was pressed and perfect, her Mobile Infantry black beret perched neatly on her head.
His soul sang, his heart rejoiced, his mind went blissfully silent.  He grasped desperately at those broad shoulders, digging dull fingernails into the blond’s back as he tried to crawl inside him. Muscular arms held him close, lifting him easily and depositing him unto the bed. They broke the kiss, staring at each other as they panted for breath.
It took a while for him to come back to himself, wiping at his soggy face with the sleeve of his hoodie. When he felt put together enough, he looked up into the face of a dark and handsome stranger.
He gave a soft "aha" as he found the crypt he was looking for. His father's bindings were much paler than the others nearby, the cloth wrapped tighter.
Rodney ground out a terse few words the tossed his comm unit across the room with s snarl. His tablet got flung unto the thin padded frame of Ronon's bunk and he walked straight into his lover's arms without breaking stride. Ronon grunted as he braced for impact, wrapping his arms around the other man as Rodney smushed his face into Ronon's massive pecks.
The liquid was cool against his skin and he rubbed until the white streaks disappeared. Then Rodney's hands were on his back, warm and strong as they tried to cover all of his broad shoulders down to just above the crack of his ass.
“I mean like who wouldn’t notice a totally hot guy turning into a complete derp whenever they’re together. Dalton practically has heart eyes whenever he sees Max. I’m sure everyone else in the pack has noticed it.”
Riddick chewed on that for a long second, taking in the sight and feel of a willing lover in his lap. Someone not afraid of him or in awe of him. Someone who wanted to scratch that deep itch that people who lived their kinds of lives didn’t get to do very often. And if it came to it, someone he could face and fight and scratch another itch.
He only cared that his beloved Queen and Princess were gone and that the Dragon's hadn't saved them. Thus he'd ordered the Pass collapsed and formed the Dragon Lance Corps with their huge iron fitted crossbows to deal with any Dragon that dared poked its head beyond the steep cliffs.
“We still have some time yet.” Reaper responded, baring his teeth in a wide grin. “Not every day we get to meet The Riddick face to face.”
Ronon was a patient man. He would wait until they were in a more private place before approaching the man about sharing blankets. The genius was a practically man, often talking about missing sex and Ronon knew that the other man had taken several partners on Atlantis.
“The point is, we were both in a really fucked up place. We couldn’t even take care of ourselves much less see about other people. Thank God for Cora and Melissa or we’d both probably be dead by now.”
He’d seen the way Tony donned his sharp and expensive, custom tailored suits, strutting as confidently as he would in his gold titanium alloy armor. How Bucky wore the latest trends, his closet filled with weird, one of a kind pieces that were more avant garde than pret-e-porter; bold and fearless in his desire to distance himself from the bleak, black horror that were his years under HYDRA.
Anthony repeated the mantra to himself as the mark high on his inner thigh gave a tingle. It did that now and then, too often for something that supposedly didn’t exist. He shifted minutely in his armor, pressing his mark against the inner workings of the suit and kept all expression off his face.
Derek pursed his lips. “Sight’s gone completely, even when I try to activate my wolf sight.” His irises turned a vibrant blue, the rings thin around the pearlescent pupils. “But it was gradual so my other senses grew stronger to compensate.”
A quick cold shower, he was geared up and walking into the hanger. Rodney was a lone at the jumper, nervous and flushed when Ronon crooked an eyebrow.
"How about no thank you. I say we take pictures from here, then turn around and go back to the comfy little bed and breakfast in town. I, for one, don't need old man Hugh Crain and his gaggle of  ghostly kids dragging my soul to hell before my final year."
He teased his lover's nipples, sucking and biting gently on the pebbled nubs as his hand gripped the base of the blond's leaking cock. His kissed the other man hard, working his fist on the throbbing member as Shika curled his long fingers just so. Naruto came with a wail, his body all but leaving the ground as he came over Kiba's hand and his own stomach.
They were currently a week into the two week time frame and people were starting to go stir crazy. Hieghtmeyer had instigated a schedule of swapping people out for those at the alpha site as the steady downpour of rain falling from dark grey clouds had proven relentless and oppressive for some and they needed some time under clear blue skies.
Ever since he’d learned of the things that went bump in the night, he’d expected the demon apocalypse, the vampire apocalypse or even the magic gone wrong apocalypse. He’d braced himself for the end whenever the next big bad rolled into town and wanted to turn the world inside out, making his piece with the world before wading into battle once more.
Ronon knew a lot of gate address by heart. He'd had to as a runner. He'd had to know which planets he could seek shelter on, which planets to lose his wraith pursuers on, which ones to find food on.
He sprawled bonelessly against the sheets as Steve eased out of him, gasping, bereft at the empty feeling. He clenched his ass weakly, whimpering as Steve left his side only for a moment. The blond soon returned, speaking soft words of comfort as he wiped Tony down with a warm cloth.
With nothing left to lose, he'd walked into the forest with a jug of fresh milk and hand full of dried gladiolus, looking to either get entranced by the fae, lured to shadow by the goblin men or eaten by wolves.
Riddick adjusted his goggles against the dust kicked up by the drop ship’s lift off.  There was a small settlement a few miles away where he could catch a ride off this back water planet. At least they left him a canteen of water and a knife. Downright generous of them. Hunters who kept their word... who knew.
The blond licked a hot stripe up the brunet’s neck, sucking on his pulse point as it raced under the pink flushed skin.
Competent and good looking bar tenders flitted confidently from customer to customer, pouring and mixing a myriad of drinks for the very rich, very demanding crowd. It was all so surreal and so fucking terrifying at the same time.
His orgasm flowed over him seamlessly, ecstasy  washing over him in deep waves as his vision slowly went white. He could feel Steve shuddering against him, that familiar heat spreading deep within his as his lover came with a stuttering grunt.
It sounded just as poorly as his current situation. He was alone and cold in the darkness, the dim blue light straining to reach the furthermost corners of the room and leaving deep dark shadows to loom above him. He felt so lonely here. In this place so foreign and full of strange faces.
He rested his hand against his father's chest and bowed his head, grief welling up inside him until it took his breath away. The warmth of Scott's hand on his shoulder allowed him to push the emotion down enough to get the job done.
"It's good to have you back." she said softly, fussing with his blanket. "Rodney's fine. He's sleeping on the next bed over. He's not injured, just a few scrapes and bruises. Do you remember what happened?"
Things came to a head when a cup of tea tipped over unto his school work, ruining two days of work. As he screamed incoherently, he thought that he could hear a soft giggle coming from the corner. That was the last straw. No one messed with his education. It's was time for desperate measures.
"Sex now, food later" Ronon growled, effectively stripping his mate's clothes off as he explored the exposed skin with his hands and tongue.
Severus, he whispered to the wind.  The wolf boy smiled and kissed him on the mouth, taking him by the hand and tugging him into the deep shadow of the great forest.
Ronon laughed loud and care fee before claiming his mate's mouth with a filthy kiss that left the genius flushed and panting.
Tony was still trembling when Steve tucked him against his side, pulling up the sheets to cover them both. He felt tears pool in the dip in Steve's collar bone, the feeling of being utterly loved and cared for bowling him over completely.
It was only when the doors began opening with a loud cranking sound did Anthony curse his own stupidity. He’d done it again, he’d underestimated the rebels. The navigator had offered no code, no password. He hadn’t even looked at the radio once, even when it was being hacked by the legionnaire.
King Argent had been so angry that the famed 'immortality' promised by the Dragon's had not helped his dying wife and daughter when they'd developed the fire pox. He'd cared not that their souls would sing together forever with the dragons.  He cared not that his heart stone would one day join theirs.
The droid had been taken apart expertly and laid out in a parody of resting peacefully, it's innards extracted and laid in a gruesome web of wires and nodes. The data processing unit has been scooped out of the split open cranium and was on suspension grid, electrode needles stuck into various parts of the gelatinous neural net and connecting via glowing wires to some kind of computer terminal.
He huffed weakly gave her a discerning look. "You just like it because of Voldemort don't you? You're so morbid, Chelle."
“No.” Derek rolled his eyes. The move looked weird. “My hearing and smell just got sharpened. My sense of touch went a bit wonky for a while. I can feel when things are near me. It took some getting used to, for sure.”
"We are our storytellers and our warriors, we are our innocence of youth and wisdom of the elderly. We are the saplings we saved of the forest that we will plant anew in our new home."
She'd had a lot of time to think when she'd been adjusting to her new circumstances and had come to some conclusions. She may have secretly joined the Mobile Infantry to be with Johnny but she'd stayed for herself.
They asked him why he didn't stay with his friends and he had a hell of a time explaining why a stupid gut feeling had made him turn back. He told them of his ride with Mr. Dudley and they went round to the couple's in town residence, guided through the thinning mist by the warm yellow street lights.
He quirked a peirced eyebrow. "Tell your druid to get off his lazy, sketchy ass and solve his own problems."
She tucked into a left roll, coming to her feet at a run only to feel a sharp and agonizing pain in her right arm, leg and side. She'd screamed, tumbling to the tarmac as the pain cut away abruptly, leaving her breathless and numb; bug screams and gunfire above her.
He trusted Steve to take care of him. He trusted the man to catch him if he fell. Breathless endearments and promises of love spilled from his kiss swollen lips as he clung to his lover, their heated, sweaty skin pressed close.
Suddenly there was a presence at his side, the car door opening and letting in the fresh air. There was a voice speaking to him, calmly and clearly and he latched on to it, using it as an anchor so that he didn't drift apart.
Tony bit back on his almost automatic correction of the Isreali's idioms, instead setting aside the camera and pocketing the phone. Pulling out a a small evidence bag, he shifted further into the closet, carefully collecting some of the tiny, brittle, egg shaped things that lined the floor of the closet.
"A whole bottle? Where did you get a whole bottle of that stuff? Only Dragon Lancers get entire bottles."
Erik had learned from the mean streets when he was a child, the brilliant and ruthless halls of MIT and the blistering deserts of Afghanistan. He'd come back hardened and disillusioned, hurt and angry at the world.
He licked his lips, the taste of other man still lingering on his tongue. Still felt the touch of calloused hands on his skin. as a matter of fact, he felt rode hard and put up wet. And fuck if he hadn’t enjoyed every minute of it. He shook out his leg, all that time spent in those shackles had left him with strained muscles and lingering cramps.
Steady hands caught his elbow and the next thing he knew he was out on the hotel balcony, leaning against the railing as he struggled to breathe. He heard a couple buttons pop on the shirt as it ripped the collar over and mourned his next meager salary check. Loki was going to kill them both dead for sure.
“Damn…” Stiles whispered hoarsely, threading his fingers with the other man’s for much needed comfort. “Blunt much, Mean wolf.”
Soon enough, they came across some activity and quickly sought cover so that they could observe unseen. A small group of scavengers were digging in some kind of pit. Above the pit, some kind of ground vehicle was parked. A rigged array of the same blue light from the weaponry shone down upon the diggers.
"Good. As long as we get our usual cut" Stiles thinned his lips, looking into the forest where the wolves had disappeared. He shook his head once again in disgust. "Self righteous fuckers."
He wasn't sure that he was that far gone yet. Still, he loved his little ship and the freedom it granted him. in fact, he'd heard stories about the terraforming being done on Mars and if it weren't for the few bonds he still had to earth and her colonies, he might have signed up for a ten year stint on the red planet. That was a thought to turn over in his mind for a later date though. now was the time for seeing what little treasures the L5 graveyard still held for a sweeper like him.
"Doesn't matter." he cut her off again, his voice flat and unforgiving. "Your pet druid isn't stepping a foot into our territory or did you forget what happened the last time you neglected your pack's sworn duty to the land."
The man was gorgeous. With the eyes as blue as cloudless skies, lips as full and red as sweet, ripe apples and hair as gold at the citadel’s highest peak. In the light of Sol he would be glorious to behold.
It took everything in him not to react. He had to scream his mantra in the maelstrom of his mind so that his body did not do something stupid, like throw itself at his soul mate and cling desperately to him.
Luckily, they were making great strides in cybernetics and she would be fitted and wired up with two brand spanking new prosthetics and be back out into the battlefield in no time.
And on his collar bone, half covered by the wool of his shirt; sat a soul mark that looked identical to the one now burning high on Tony’s inner thigh.
Later that night when they are sitting together, a wooly afghan tucked around their legs and Carey Grant smiling on the screen, the kisses are as sweet and hot as Tony had hoped they'd be. He let himself be tugged to the bedroom and into bed, glutting his senses on the man who'd slipped into his heart so deftly.
They made a love a few more times, Ronon working his mate's body until the man was weeping and begging for release. Kisses were sweet and sticky of pineapple and the jam filled pastries and Ronon smiled and licked along the row of hickeys he'd sucked along Rodney's inner thighs.
Shikamaru huffed and tugged gently on Kiba's wild hair. "I also happen to have a couple of days off. Tsunade kicked me out of the tower and told me not to come back until next week. How utterly strange and coincidental."
He looked back at the burning forest, the orange glow looked sinister as it seeped through the trees. He could faintly hear the crackling of the ancient logs splitting over the waves of the ocean and his heart mourned deeply.
Thankfully, another of the wolf pups, Erica, had been smart enough to yank her away into the ladies' room and away from Stiles' path. At least one or two of the wolves seemed to have a good head on their shoulders. he'd often thought that Reyes would make a good fox but she'd been offered the bite first from Talia at Cora's behest.
Steve grinned, the taste of thousand dollar a glass scotch on his tongue, the soft feel of a suit that probably cost more than his yearly salary under his fingertips, the smell of exclusive men’s cologne in his nose.
He was less than a block from the shop when he spotted the old Junker that he and T'Challa had both learned to drive on, rolling to a sputtering stop halfway up the curb.
a day late. i was swamped at work yesterday and exhausted when i cam home so i wrote this early this morning. will still try to get in another by the end of today.
Steve was sitting against the bedhead, snug in a ratty t-shirt and rumpled boxers. His hair was an utterly adorable mess and he had a thick, most likely non-fiction, biography opened in his lap. His eyes were a summer sky blue when he looked up and his gentle mile felt like the warmth in his chest after a cup of Clint’s really good hot chocolate.
"Don't need too. Answer's still no. your little tree fucker's not setting a foot across our borders. Period. End of discussion."
"Mr. Rossi, Good afternoon." Spencer stood sharply, deftly tugging on the fitted bone and grey corset vest; smoothing the material flat before reaching out a hand.  "I appreciate the call."
The jersey was comfortable and smelled good just like the coat did. Pressing the cuff of the sleeve against his mouth, he took in a deep breath, savouring the smell and grateful for the absence of pain or rattling in his scarred lungs.
The smaller man shrugged gently. "He needs to learn that she can take care of herself. He leapt to her rescue today even though we all knew that she could handle it. He put us all at risk because he can't help but focus on her before anything else."
Candy gave an indignant shriek. "Oh for fuck's sake. Let the big baby out. This is getting fucking ridiculous."
She stopped herself from running a hand over her shaved head, the blonde buzz cut so different from the curls she'd once sported. She would grow them back eventually but they'd shaved her bald during recovery and she'd kept it short for convenience since then. She'd been too busy learning to walk and fight again after losing an arm and most of her leg.
Well, most of the time. Rodney was still light years ahead of Ronon and spoke in such terms that sounded like music to the man's ears but made no sense whatsoever.
The genius looked glorious, laid out so perfectly for him on the blanket, his pale skin glowing from the colours of the nebula all around them. The whole world was beauty and colour and he lost himself to the hazy pleasure of sex with his mate.
"The cave system the locals told us about collapsed and you took the brunt of the fall. You and Rodney were trapped while John and I went back to the gate for help because the heavy rains started, causing flash floods. We had to comeback with Puddle jumpers and  two more teams to get you out before the cave you were in filled with water and drowned you both."
Over that when the pretty green sweater dress that she'd gotten for her birthday. It fell to her knees and looked lovely with the matching tartan scarf. She shoved her feet into the clunky boots she wasn't often seen without, much to her fashion forward family's frustration.
Anthony blinked, unsure of what to make of the comment. He kept silent as the Captain chuckled to himself, turning towards the table behind him. He had the Legionnaire’s head in his hands when he turned back around, half of its face plating stripped away. Tony clenched his jaw at the sight of the odd tech cobbled together at the back of its’ half hollow skull.
The whine of Rhodes’ thrusters drew closer, the gleam of his armor tarnished by soot and ash. “They got in through one of the intake valves, the godless scum. Tore right through the reinforced titanium.” He held a piece of melted slag in one hand. “Some kind of thermobaric ordinance. Used at the base of the main solar array. It didn’t do much damage to the machine itself but the fuel-oxygen combustion of the bomb ruptured the photovaltic tanks and set off a chain reaction.”
"Before we discuss the hows and whys of me losing my virginity to hot and sexy brood master Derek Hale, you need to tell me exactly who you know that his middle name is Sebastian?"
“We can’t.” he pleaded as the blond pressed against his back, hands coming to rest on his hips. Blood rushed in his veins as his heart raced in his chest. He tried to shift away, hopping off the stool but the blond was quicker and he was soon pinned against the table, face to face.
Ewan huffed, "Jake watches too many horror movies. I'm forced to as well cause I'm his roommate and our apartment is the size of a fucking postage stamp."
They were all staring at him, eyes cold and hands on their weapons. They were right to do so. To have an unknown like him so close to their leader was taunting danger and the three seemed to be well aware of it, despite the Captain's relaxed demeanor. Rhodes would have never let an enemy within a hundred feet of him and then only through thick sheets of  lucent glass and a squadron of the Legion.
Steve swiped at his eyes with the tie, sniffing as he tried not to break down completely. “There was a bomb. He saved me. Dragged my ass out of there when I wouldn’t leave my men. the army booted us back stateside with a pat on the back and a box full of medals. It took us a while to pull each other back from that hellish nightmare. A long fucking time to get our shit together.”
His musing was broken when Tony snorted softly and curled upon on his side, fast asleep on the weird ergonomic chair he was sitting in. The chair rolled a bit as the man tried to get comfortable and Steve dove forward to brace it before it tipped over.
“I’m glad that you appreciate my work.” the man who Anthony had never dreamed of meeting in real life smiled, and by Sol he was beautiful. “You can call me the Captain.”
“No one gives a fuck about vets these days. His HMO won’t cover a prosthetic. The VA gave this shitty plastic thing which hurts his arm all the fucking time. And he doesn’t even complain. He just grins and bears it because he’s the strong one you know? Even when he can’t keep down a job and we both have to live on his benefits and my shitty part time. Even when we had to go hungry for days in order to raise the money for this chance. He’s always been the strong one. Ever since we was kids….”
Anthony knew the look in the other man’s eyes. That crazed denial, that utter disbelief. He knew that if he refused again, that the man would make good on his promise. He stood, carefully pulling off his shirt and setting it aside. Next came his pants and he swallowed his shame at his own nakedness. This was beneath his dignity as king but he was no longer king. He was a prisoner of war and would act as such as to preserve his life for as long as he could.
X2857 H2 was first discovered while it was only three days away from the planet, coming out of a section of space previously thought to be empty as fuck. It took the great minds of the world another day to determine that the sneaky burning space rock was making a beeline straight toward the third rock from the sun.
