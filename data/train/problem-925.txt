Before he could rectify his mistake, Mike blustered in.
“Hey, John! Where are you going?”
“Okay. John?”
“I do, and I’m glad. It means you’re a worthy... adversary.”
John was standing in the foyer of the house, looking at the crowd of boys in dungarees. He could feel the prickling of the adrenaline in the air on his skin. Someone was playing some sort of dance track on their phone, and Lestrade was standing on the stairs, trying to count the moving heads. John knew he would come up one short.
John was inflating an air mattress with a foot pump, softly singing something to himself about cardiac bruising. He had changed into his own familiar pyjamas, a fragment of the tableau of school looking irrationally out of place in such a homely environment.
“And did you reciprocate?”
“I’ll take your word for it,” John interrupted. “In that case, the only other option is that she’s genuinely just… forgotten.”
, said the caption, overlaid with crying-laughing emojis, and John’s heart sank at the same time as his blood boiled.
Sherlock shot him a grin and stood up. “Mud! Thank you, John.” He moved back over to the marks on the floor. “If someone had to drag Muhammad, it would have taken some force. The aggressor would have needed some traction.” He knelt down and pointed to a chunk of mud smeared on the floor. “Mud from the bottom of the attacker’s shoe.” He stood, barely keeping the self-satisfaction off his face. “I can analyse it and find out whereabouts the aggressor has been recently, or I can have someone else do it while I attend to other areas of the investigation. You know, at first I was going to tell you to stop overreacting, decline the case, but that ring… ”
Night fell and John’s mother came home. In that order.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, unable to speak as his chin was otherwise occupied.
Sherlock swallowed. “Mm.”
, Sherlock wanted to mock him,
John ignored him. “Sofa or bed?”
“You sure are devoted,” Anderson commented, when the family had retired to another part of the house and the three living had retired with the three dead.
“I know that,” Kitty dismissed. “I’m just curious about him. Hmm,” she mused, turning to look at him, stopping in her tracks, “you’ve just sparked an idea. Considering you know him so well, how about you and I collaborate on the piece?” John opened his mouth, but Kitty pressed on. “You’d be able to get a real insider scoop - inside the mind of the boy detective, yes, I can see it now. Of course there’s no mysteries to report on, not since Mr Bradstreet’s pets - unless…?” she prompted, looking at John with that penetrating look again, and John folded his arms.
“So, what’s your name?”
“Sit on the bed,” John instructed, and Sherlock did so. John knelt behind him.
Natural, but also a little nerve-wracking.
, two, three,
He was on all fours in the street, shaking. He muttered something reassuring and staggered to his feet, refusing the hand that the stranger was offering and keeping his eyes down. He’d already attracted enough attention, he didn’t want to create even more of a scene by letting on that he was –
“Bye,” John called, watching Sherlock walk across the road to his brother. Mycroft raised a hand to John in farewell, then ducked back into the car. John waved as Sherlock shut the boot of the car and rounded to the back seat, the door of which was being held open by the chauffeur. Sherlock raised a hand in return.
“Mum?” John called. “Harry?”
. Did he say that?
Lestrade raised an eyebrow and glanced up at John. “Any excuse?”
“They’re Sarah’s,” John said suddenly. “She was wearing them the last time we met up.”
“Uh,” John faltered, “yeah, from the san. Listen,” he lowered his voice, “I know it was you on Sunday in the - ” he gestured at his ear, before catching Sherlock’s gaze. The boy had just caught up to them and was standing behind Richie. He shook his head at John.
“Because I’m a sociopath, John,” Sherlock said, back still to him, like an animal that doesn’t trust enough to bare its soft belly.
The boy had finally turned around. His shirt was muddy and ripped across the front; he had a bruise forming on his cheek and a split lip. He looked as if he had been in some sort of pub brawl; he had cuts everywhere, and one particularly worrying one horribly close to his left eye.
“Hmm,” Sherlock pondered. “Nine point five.”
“Okay. C’mere, Louis, let me have a look at you.” John took the boy’s hands gently, guiding them away from his face so he could look him in the eyes. “Where does it hurt?”
“Okay,” John said, unnerved by the currents of emotion Angelo’s voice was trying to hide. He turned to Sherlock and cocked his head, saying
He climbed silently up the old oak tree and slipped through the open window of room twenty one. He shut it steadily behind him. It was quiet, John’s breathing slow and even; as his eyes adjusted to the muffled dark of the room, Sherlock could see that his roommate was lying curled up on his side, facing the wall. He unrolled his towel and laid it on the radiator to dry, then moved to his desk and flicked on his lamp. By its sickly-yellow, energy-inefficient bulb, he checked his timetable for the next day. Biology, free period, double Latin, chemistry, another free period. He had an unfinished Latin translation open on his bed, only the title having been scrawled before he’d been distracted by something, he couldn’t remember what.
Sherlock paused, hands stilling in a midair gesture. “Yes?”
His feet took him to the gate of the graveyard. He fumbled with the latch, cursing himself.
“Yes.”
. John couldn’t tell if Sherlock had understood, but he gave his arm a squeeze as punctuation and dropped it, resigning himself to torturing himself with regret until he could get Sherlock alone again.
“Why did you say there had been a murder, Percy?” Sherlock asked. “You specifically said murder, but you didn’t know whether it was natural or not, did you?”
John felt himself frown. He turned to Sherlock. “They were… on fire?”
“How old is she?”
“I don’t know. We don’t discuss them.”
“What now?” John asked, that ‘
It was humid and stuffy inside the swimming pool hall. John had arrived a little late due to Mike having been asleep when John had come to find him so they could walk down together. After having woken him up and half-jogged down to the sports facilities, John was already sweating a little when he opened the door onto a wall of noise and heat.
“What?”
He was jealous. It was scary, possessive, threatening jealousy, but he was jealous. It was plain as day. Jealous that Sherlock had a friend – he’d used that word,
The screen was unlocked, a plain blue background staring questioningly back at him –
“Dan was alright. It was the rest of them.” Harry said quietly.
“Oi!” he called up. “Damn him and his legs,” he muttered when he got no response, bounding up the stairs two at a time to catch up with his wayward roommate.
“They’re just kids themselves, mum,” John said quietly, willing himself to stay calm, feeling Harry’s eyes on his face. “They couldn’t help what they did before.”
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock yawned.
“I should hope so,” Sherlock said, going to her and retrieving the small plastic box from his pocket. “I need you to text me what chemical compounds you find in this mud.” He handed her the container, looking directly into her eyes. “Now, please.”
“John?”
“What?” John let go of Sarah and the irritation was replaced by worry.
Sherlock knew he was being childish, storming off like he had, knew that John had just worded his thoughts badly. But he also couldn’t look him in the eye.
“Got to use up the film somehow. Will you get a tea-light from that cupboard?” he asked, pointing.
“Why don’t you give us a tour?” Mrs Watson suggested.
“My pleasure, dear. Now get inside, Sherlock’ll be in a right state.” She nodded at the house, and John picked up his backpack and the flowers and opened the car door.
Sherlock nodded, then abruptly resumed walking up the stairs.
John was leaning against a wall just outside of the exit of the Tube station nearest to his house, sipping at the drink in his had that had only just cooled down enough to do so, scanning the crowd. He managed to support both cups with one hand while he pulled out his phone to check for texts, but nothing new had come from Sherlock since about an hour previously.
Sherlock felt as if he’d been winded.
“A sample of Janine’s spit,” mumbled Sherlock absently.
“Anytime,” Sherlock replied, and the air felt warm.
“When did
that. He’s my best friend, and if I’ve told you once, I’ve – ”
Never mind; it didn’t matter – John’s face split into a wide grin and all gravity was lost. “Watch.”
Sherlock adjusted the microscope slightly. “You hadn’t told them?”
“I don’t believe it for a second.” John dismissed as he took the second package, wrapped in the same paper as the first. It felt much the same as Harry’s did, but firmer and heavier.
“Fine, whatever you say,”
“Harry was in the place of my father in my dream that night.”
She looked at him, jutting her chin out slightly, defensive.
It wasn’t fair - he was only trying to help! All the adults thought he was useless because he was ‘only five’, but in fact he was nearly six and a lot cleverer than most of them anyway. But when mummy looked at him like that, his will to be mean went away, so he went back to bed. But he did make sure to pout and stomp so that she knew he wasn’t happy about it.
His hand was still resting on the cool stone of the windowsill and he retracted it quickly. He stood for a moment, breathing slowly.
Eventually she did, saying nothing more. The line of light thinned until it was gone, and John was alone again.
, John corrected himself.
Sherlock leapt nimbly into the room, his long coat swirling around him like a storm. John quickly shut the window again, so as to keep the warmth in. Sherlock brought in with him the intoxicating scent of the chill of the night, of wind, of open spaces, of fields and woods and a promise of rain. His curls were even more unkempt than usual, looking as if a hurricane had been at them. The boy turned and fixed John with those eyes of his - bright, wild, feral.
“Doesn’t vodka taste worse?”
“We don’t
But when Sherlock’s silence remained expectant, he elaborated somewhat reluctantly. “I don’t like the thought of fourteen year old you and illicit substances and someone older than you. Creeps me out.”
One of the upper sixth started up a chant, and John couldn’t help joining in, having to work quite hard to keep up with the pace of the group. Sherlock was having no trouble, however, as he strode silently beside him.
“Oh, trust you to show me up,” John berated him, trying to sing the words he could remember as Sherlock continued.
“Four fifty,” Sherlock said. “I need to get home.”
“There is quite literally nothing I like about you,” Sherlock said, trying to restrain himself from saying much more. Victor liked to get him angry, took some kind of twisted pleasure in it. He hadn’t quite been able to work out why, but Victor’s slimy smile made Sherlock want to punch it.
At eight thirty, the whole house joined the rest of the school in the main hall. It was a big, draughty building, with a stage at one end. Assembly was deathly boring. The head master spoke in a droning voice that couldn’t have been more lacking in interest if he tried and John was glad to see the back of the entire affair. Leaving the hall, John quickly caught up with his roommate.
“Okay,” John said, watching Sherlock as he spun, faster and faster - and John reached out to stay him. He held him by the arms. “Sherlock, stop.”
“Oi!“
Sherlock seemed to be taking this in. Then, “Come on.” And he was off again, leading John down the passage, and for a moment John thought he was going to show him his parents’ room, but he marched straight past. “More bedrooms…” he said, waving his hand at the doors as they passed.
Sherlock nodded once. Turned away, back to the buffet on Lestrade’s kitchen counters. John realised too late that that had been the wrong answer.
“Well,” Mycroft said. “I was going to ask if Sherlock wanted any help with packing, but it appears that John has somehow beaten me to it. I’ll wait downstairs. Don’t be late, brother dearest.” He gave John one last, tight smile, and walked out, the woman –
“It’s human,” John responded, stopping Sherlock mid-sentence.
John looked at his watch. Two forty. Five minutes to go.
He found himself in the dim foyer. It smelt not unpleasantly of clean laundry, old wood and dust. The walls were covered with notice boards, upon which were pinned pieces of paper bearing words such as 'DINNER TIMES - AUTUMN TERM', 'EXEAT WEEKEND RULES' and 'OPPOSITE SEX NOT PERMITTED BEYOND COMMON AREAS ON GROUND FLOOR'. Directly in front of him was a staircase that wound upwards to, presumably, bedrooms -
“I think it’s Frank Sinatra, but slowed down an obscene amount,” Sherlock replied, and John laughed at the acidity in his tone.
There was a pause. “Something about it doesn’t add up. He was one of the best swimmers in our squad, healthy, strong… and his shoes…”
John had sent Sherlock to the ward, the term used to describe a dusty room lined with hospital beds where the nurses put students too sick to go to their lessons. Sherlock remembered it well.
“Her hair’s blonde, naturally.”
Sherlock began to protest, but John shushed him. “You don’t get a say in the matter. See you in a bit.”
He stood up. He was on the roof of the house, a flat part, and for a split second he forgot why he was there as his breath was taken away how high up he was. Sherlock was sitting a few metres away, his legs drawn up to his chest, swathed in his coat. John felt his chest loosen. He exhaled.
“John, we have to go.”
“They’re not huge rivals, but – ” Mike was saying, interrupted by the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps behind him. They both turned around to see Sherlock striding up to them, his hair mysteriously wet. “Hey, Sherlock, where’ve you been?”
“Oh, god, Mike, you’re like some sort of gossip-hungry agony aunt,” John grumbled. This did not earn anything more than a look from Mike, so John elaborated. “We’re not even properly seeing each other, we just text a bit.”
,” Eric cooed, making fun of him. “Was she your
She nodded. “I was feeling fine at dinner, but just as I was about to go to bed… I thought it was maybe just my period but I’ve never even had cramps before.”
They left the attic door and the washing basket as they were, and as soon as they got onto the stairs, John leaned over the banister and shouted to the assembled below, “Got him!”
“I understand,” Angelo said. “It must be tough, seeing as homos can’t grow facial hair.”
“Er…” John cocked his head, bobbing it as he searched the sky. He leaned into Sherlock, positioning his head so as to follow the line of Sherlock’s arm better. Sherlock swallowed. “Oh! Yeah, I think I’ve got it. Those three, right?” John said, pointing.
Sherlock carefully shifted so he could see the end of his bed, and, true enough, there was John. He was lying on his back in the space to the right of Sherlock’s legs, with his own draped over the bars at the end of the bed. At the sight of him, Sherlock couldn’t help but smile a little – despite everything, John was still there.
Sherlock watched as the ball flew on wings unseen toward the H.
The exam was hard. John was still writing when the head invigilator called for the students to put their pens down.
Saturday dawned sluggishly. The last day of term.
Every muscled in his body was screaming at him, but
He turned to leave, but Sherlock caught his arm. John turned around.
, but held himself back. Sherlock could do as he pleased; John had no right to lecture or condemn or feel as crushed as he did. John knew it wasn’t about the substances, anyway. It was about Sherlock finding comfort in something - someone - other than John.
Sherlock thought for a moment. Could he trust John with dressing himself appropriately?
“Not today,” was the response. John released the arm and stepped back. Sherlock washed his face, once, twice, three times, and towelled himself dry.
had changed between that conversation and this one. They were saying almost the same thing, but not quite. And it was the
John smiled to the empty room and sipped at his hot chocolate.
John laughed again, and Sherlock grumbled, and the future was immaterial and far-off and out of sight.
Sherlock felt John’s laughter in his own throat, felt it bubble. “That’s a little more difficult. If you look – ” Sherlock began, but was interrupted by a violent buzzing in his pocket. The laughter was extinguished instantly. He sighed and took out his phone. It was Mycroft. He answered the call and put the phone to his ear. “Yes?”
“No, go on,” John insisted, feeling his core warming unpleasantly under his jumper.
; he corrected himself. He knew why. He didn’t like to think about it.
At that moment, a teacher appeared and called for silence, and then they were filing into the exam hall and Sherlock split off from John to find his seat and he was gone. John held his pen in the same hand he had held Sherlock’s wrist. He wished he could have felt the heat of his skin through the fabric of his blazer. Just to know he was alive.
“And you, and you,” David said. “Oh, call me Dave, by the way, your sister does.”
His friends avoided his gaze, and John knew he’d got his message across. The last part of the story was the part he really didn’t want to tell, but he had to now. So he decided to get it over with.
“Viola just caught my eye.” At John’s lack of response, he elaborated. “I’ve been trying to avoid her since the guests arrived so she can’t nag me. And now she knows where I am. And she knows I know that she’s seen me. We’d better go over.”
Darkness fell as he read, but only when he began to struggle to read the words on the page did he realise and turn some lights on. When he had finished that journal, he immediately reached for another.
“Oh,” John said, frowning. “He was just… he brought up my dad and my sister and this boy, my next door neighbour, I used to be close with him. I don’t know.”
Sherlock didn’t speak again until he’d finished John’s crisps and was licking his fingers to get the salt and grease off.
“Eh, I had it covered,” John joked, and Mike rolled his eyes.
John laughed uneasily. “That’s a bit creepy,”
“But there’s my roommate, and Mike, and Ollie’s pretty nice, and Molly, and Sarah, and all the guys in my house are pretty friendly, really.”
“I almost didn’t want him to explain, because it is always such a personal thing when you find out someone’s big secret. Everyone has one, I think, but they’re always huge when it’s a person who goes to therapy. And I felt like I’d pressured him into explaining. But I was so curious, so I didn’t stop him.
John narrowed his eyes. “Thanks.”
“What house is Angelica in?”
Sherlock nodded.
His mind had flitted around the subject of John’s Christmas present over the past few days, but nothing perfect had come to mind. And it has to be perfect, Sherlock thought. It has to say everything I can’t, everything I feel when he’s with me, because language is fallible and tongues stutter and voices falter. Then he had tried to pinpoint exactly what he felt when he was with John, but that had felt like looking over the edge of a cliff; vertigo. So he had stopped and put it to the back of his mind.
“Half empty or half full?”
John watched the boy out of the corner of his eye as he entered him on the database. He had both hands resting on the desktop, which was about chest height for him. The sleeves of his blazer, even with his hands raised, brushed the first knuckles of his thumbs. He turned his head and suddenly John thought he’d seen him before, but couldn’t put his finger on where. It was like he was a ghost, a face glimpsed in a crowd while looking for someone else, a broken chord of a song heard through a wall.
It wasn’t cold in their room, but as he pulled the t-shirt over his head, he had to fight the urge to shiver.
John moved in front of Sherlock.
“Well, I heard you two fighting and – ”
John thought of his father's grave.
“John! Cheeky!” reprimanded his mum.
“Do you remember me getting into bed with you last night?” He asked.
[in which Sherlock sings and we learn what John did over the summer]
“No, wait, Mycroft - ”
“I don’t know. You seemed off when I mentioned the army.”
Which was why he had no idea someone had entered the room until he felt the brush of lips against the back of his neck.
John could not move for a moment. It took Sherlock poking him in the leg for him to gather his senses and get up. He would not remember, later, receiving the small envelope containing his prize of iTunes vouchers, nor shaking the headmaster’s hand, but his mother would say that he had been smiling as if he was expecting someone to burst out from behind one of the large floral displays and tell him he had been pranked.
“Nobody moved for a long time. We stared as Sherlock walked down the dorm, and he stared right back - looked each one of us in the eye as he passed our beds. And then he was gone. We didn’t see him in the dorm again.”
John was unnerved by how calm Sherlock was. “Who is he?”
“Oh my god – ” Sherlock spluttered after taking a sip. “This is disgusting,”
John smiled and gave into the temptation and sat beside him, the pew creaking in the dusty silence.
“Hi, Sherlock,” piped up a small voice, and its owner leaned into view from behind Irene. “Hey, John,”
But this girl… nothing. This was not
Mike paused, and, looking up from twisting the now-bare ice cream stick in his hands, saw the expression on John’s face.
His brother’s old mantra, his only piece of advice when Sherlock had left home for Bart’s at thirteen, with too much hair and not enough people to care about.
“Was cocaine a factor in your father’s death?”
His hand was still gripped tightly around John’s arm, and now he gently pushed a little.
“If you make me eat that foie gras again, I will regurgitate it upon your shoes.” Sherlock replied.
“I’m worried,” Angelo started, “about God.”
The warmth of Doyle felt heavenly on John’s exposed arms as the house piled inside.
“Tell mum I love her and that I’ll call tomorrow.” John said, his voice a little hoarse from the couple of hours of disuse. Harry nodded, then gave him a quick hug. “If you don’t cause too much trouble, I’ll see what I can do about those stilettos.” he smirked. Harry grinned.
Anderson turned bright red, and his friends stopped snickering. Sherlock turned back to John with a smug grin on his face.
“Where’ve you been?” Harry called accusingly from the sofa as John walked past the living room door and up the stairs. “Rugby finished, like, an hour ago,”
, he reminded himself - in front of them, they turned as one with a great commotion, and at another shout, moved off, limbs swinging like pendulums, perfectly in unison. Sherlock could see why John was attracted to the CCF; there had been so much chaos in his life, and the armed forces were the polar opposite - by their very nature ordered, practical, uniformity and conformity in the extreme, the perfect counterbalance.
“Why?”
His hair was standing up in all directions, eyes still half-closed. He stood next to John, who could feel the heat radiating off his rommate's skin, still warm from bed.
He heard Sherlock begin to protest wearily under his breath, but soon left him far behind, only hearing now his own pounding footsteps.
“Good, good,” she said absently, still scribbling. “Do you still miss your father?”
“So where is he?”
John’s phone vibrated again.
“Did the Queen let you off your lead for good behaviour? Or were you just annoying her too much?”
“Hey, John,” Kitty called brightly as they neared each other. “Hey, Sarah. What’s - ”
The secretary was told he was “in no state to be around the other students”. That his conduct was “inappropriate” and “deliberately provocative”.
“It’s probably cocaine,” Mycroft sighed. “Listen to me, John. You need to find his… stash, and you need to dispose of it. Indefinitely. But you can’t tell anyone, understand?”
Next up was Golding – they took their places on a dark stage, but John knew a lot of the finer details of their act, as Jamie Lancaster had complained about it in the last san session they had worked together. A spotlight was on a small boy with a trumpet sitting on the front of the stage. He raised it to his lips and began. There was a shout of “
“Perhaps.” Sherlock moved into the room. “Though I don’t think she’ll notice.”
“So, you heard all of that game, then?” he asked.
“Breathe, John, come on,” Sherlock urged. “Breathe, now –“ he exaggerated his own breathing to illustrate. “- In through the nose, come on, out through the mouth, come on, now, John,”
“Sir, I have to go home,” Sherlock said to the teacher supervising the detention. The eyes of the other students turned on them, a mixture of confusion and annoyance.
“Do you know what song they’ve picked?” Sherlock interrupted.
John glanced at his friend through his blurred vision, and Sherlock caught his eye, laughing with him, despite the tears that threatened to overflow.
“Say something.”
John held his breath, waiting for Sherlock to turn his sharp tongue on him once again, but Sherlock didn’t respond at all.
“The bits I can remember.”
The only sound was the clicking and humming of the pool pumps and the gentle lapping of the water against the sides. John tilted his head upwards, towards the roof that was more glass than tile. He could see the moon through it, silent up there amongst the barely-visible stars.
John could feel the sarcasm, and laughed.
The silence of the pool hall would have been deemed eerie by some, the water lapping at the quiet, the humming of the machines trying to push the quiescence away. For some time he watched the surface of the pool undulating with the ripples his body etched into it.
“Mm?” Sherlock replied, not looking up from the text.
Greg saw Sherlock’s eyes flick up to rest on John’s face, saw the blink, saw the slow, small smile. Saw his eyes drop as John’s moved back to his.
,” Mike said, somewhat to John’s relief. “I just assumed you were bi.”
“Watching someone while they sleep is usually considered rude,” Sherlock mumbled, and John felt his heart stop.
“Harry!”
“I worked out what it should look like,” John started, traces of laughter distorting his speech.
His question was met with a stony silence.
Sherlock retrieved a small clear plastic box from another pocket and carefully placed a chunk of the floorboard he had cut away inside it, before leaping to his feet, an almost frantic energy in his eyes.
John was fine, the concussion having basically faded within the next hour. He was a little put out that he couldn’t finish his rugby practise, but other than that –
John had his bag packed by nine that evening.
He knew from experience.
John thought.
A vague memory of the evening air being diced by rotor blades, the heavy chunks of it falling accusingly onto the gathered crowd in the garden watching the air ambulance fleeing from the rooftop, and Eddie understood.
He turned around, took one look at Sherlock, and laughed.
“We’ll be at a seven within the next six minutes,” Sherlock said by way of greeting once John had levelled with him.
John was taken aback. He had thought Sherlock had deleted that. Or had pushed it into the farthest corner of the attic of his mind palace at least.
“Nicked it off Victor before he went away,” Sherlock said, pushing the door open. “Made a copy and put it back before he even noticed. Come on.”
match,
“Shh!” Victor hissed, closing the door. “So when am I going to get something back?”
Muhammad folded his arms and frowned harder. “I don’t - he was my best friend, John, you think I’d be friends with someone who - ?”
Sherlock felt himself smile. “Yeah.”
“But you would, though! You got all that dirt on Sherlock, and you’ve been our contact with the page. Why wouldn’t it be you?”
The two didn’t speak until they had taken their seats, kitted out in lab coats and safety goggles, both looking at the bloody heart sitting on the desk between them.
Nothing. He needed to salvage this. “We’re having bets at home, me and my mum, on when she’s going to ask her best friend out.” Another lie, but never mind. “I say by Christmas, she says New Year’s,”
Sherlock interrupted him with a groan. “I remember all the material, can’t I just take the exams?”
Sherlock laughed. “No more detentions,” he promised. “And none for you, either.”
“John?”
Sherlock said nothing, watching the police at work.
John winced. “Okay. Okay, okay. So M came and took them away as soon as you left to come and get me.” Sherlock said nothing. “Sherlock.” Sherlock remained silent, but John felt him squirm in his grip as if he was trying to get away, and that made John panic. He slid his hands down Sherlock’s arms and grabbed his hands, probably too hard, and pulled him back into him. “I believe you.”
“Come
“Bullshit.”
“Oh, yes, I should think so,” Mrs Watson agreed, refining her own accent to a shoddy impersonation of Sherlock’s, and Harry could feel her cheeks burning in pre-emptive embarrassment, but Sherlock smiled a little. “How polite of you to offer.”
“No, it’s – ” Sherlock heard footsteps, gradually getting louder, coming towards the office he was in. “I have to go, see you in biology,” he said hastily, and, without waiting for a reply, ended the call.
“Sumptuous,” Sherlock returned, taking a huge bite and maintaining eye contact with John while he chewed.
“You okay?” John said.
John joined him a moment later, swinging his backpack onto his back.
John reached into another cupboard and handed Sherlock a purple cardboard container of powder.
“What do you mean?” asked John.
Sooner than John would have expected, they launched into the first chorus, and his arms seemed to move of their own accord as the choreography seemed more muscle memory that anything else by then, and he was surprised to find the grin plastered on his face was not false in the slightest.
Glen took a breath, and John realised he was leaning forward slightly in anticipation. “Never… have I ever had sex.”
the cigarettes?” asked John.
Neither boy said anything more, but each knew they would go together or not at all.
“Shh!” chided John. “Just take it easy.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Hey, you’ve got to remember that most of us haven’t done this already, yeah?” Sherlock huffed and strode back over to his bench, lab coat flapping out behind him. John felt sorry for Robbie.
Less than ten metres to go. Sherlock gritted his teeth and kicked harder.
“I thought it was compulsory?”
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock looked genuinely pleased, and John didn’t really mind playing along, as long as it kept him from sinking into one of his moods. He didn’t really have the energy to deal with that today.
“In exchange for what?”
“That was so awkward, oh my god,” he said, folding his hands on his stomach.
He played the first note and John felt as if the world had fallen out from underneath his feet.
“They’re very rare, nothing to worry about, but I have to give you the list, it’s a legal thing. So.” He pulled out a sheet of paper and began to read, so quickly that the words blurred into one another. “Lethargy, fever, nausea, insomnia, vivid dreams, depression, panic attacks, and involuntary recurrent memories. As I said, nothing to worry about.”
“Cheers,” John said, clinking his mug to Sherlock’s and taking a sip of the wine.
“No, I suppose not,” John conceded. Then, after a moment, “I think it’s the non-brainy side of him, his violin.”
” he mumbled.
“Oh, upstairs, sleeping. Sleepy Clara,” Harry said. “Whoa,” she swayed on her feet, and clutched the countertop. “I don’t feel too good…”
“And your point is...?”
“No. Could be withdrawal.”
“It’s an experiment, Sherlock,” John said. “I thought you’d appreciate that.”
“You mean because I play rugby you think I can only use my body for brute force.”
The next day, John walked Sherlock to the Tube station, as usual. Their parting conversation was less of a farewell and more of a ‘see you soon’, neither mentioning New Year’s Eve nor pretending it wasn’t going to happen.
He and Claus had a brief staring match before the other boy gave in and angrily took all the cards that had accumulated from the middle of the circle.
“For what? I didn’t know the boy.”
“Did I now?” teased Sherlock, and before John knew what was happening, he found his own pillow slamming into his chest, accompanied by a strange sound John hadn’t heard before.
Harry thought to herself.
different, though.
– endearing), were a contrast to John’s fluorescent patterned ones.
“Oh, well, in that case, I will have to give you the classic treatment,” John declared, standing up and indicating for Sherlock to do the same.
John’s gaze caught on one man, a father, sitting by himself. He was watching his daughter do handstands on the grass. He was smiling. But then he turned his head and John realised his face was a little too tanned for his blond hair.
John had left him reluctantly that bright Monday morning. He had wanted to stay with him in their room, to watch over him as he paced, or scribbled down notes, or researched. But Mike had come to get him, and the door had closed behind him and Sherlock was gone, out of John’s sight.
Sherlock had twitched. “Thirty seven,” he’d muttered. “I have thirty seven plans.”

“What?” Sherlock spat.
There was a pause in which Sherlock felt he ought to do something, say something, but he couldn’t work out what. Felt he ought to take his hands out of his pockets, but what to do with them? John was smiling at him, chest heaving from his exertion, and Sherlock wanted to do something, but he didn’t know what, felt suddenly clumsy and stupid.
John was laughing at him. “I told you,”
John frowned. Thought. Then – “Oh! Like – ” he lowered his voice. “Like the thing that killed Mr Bradstreet’s pets?”
Sherlock’s hands retreated back to the rooftop. John felt his eyes searching his. “What’s wrong?”
“It’s fine, don’t worry.”
“Medicine, though,” John countered. “Competitive.”
“So way above my pay grade, then,” John assumed. “Couldn’t you just get Mycroft to get them for you for your birthday or something? Avoid paying for them yourself?”
“It was her idea,” John pointed out. “She just… I think she thought I wasn’t willing to put as much effort in as she was.”
John lethargically got down from his bed and stood in front of the window, abandoning the sketchpad on the mattress. The rays of the setting sun warmed his face as he looked out. There was a tree an arm’s reach from the house, one branch winding across John’s view. He could see across the road to a playing field, and beyond that, a wood. Summer was coming to an end, and everything was glowing in the early September evening light
by Dexy’s Midnight Runners. My God. There isn’t even a violin part.”
“After my brief sojourn in hospital last year. Said if I came back for sixth form, he’d get me access to some low-level cases, keep me occupied.”
, high and sweet. John knew it was Sherlock playing, but it was something he’d never heard him play before. And it took a moment for the idea to plant itself, but once it did, John’s breath caught.
“Only you,” John said. “Only you would think public slander is fun.”
“They’re yours, actually,” Sherlock said.
“Why do you do it, Sherlock?” John asked, and there was genuine curiosity on his features.
“One thirty will do,” John said. “I’m afraid our shitty microwave isn’t accurate enough for your standards.”
“Bacon sarnie it is.” John shuffled forward in the queue while rummaging in his pockets for the cash, Sherlock trailing reluctantly behind.
Sherlock didn’t answer, so John glared at him until he did, somewhat reluctantly.
“Oh, of course,” Anderson said. “Yeah, Angelo and him – you know Angelo, right? De Luca, he – ”
“You can think in our room.” Sherlock looked at him. Wide eyes, unblinking. John held a neutral expression. “You don’t want to be found on a roof with pupils like those. Come on.”
A great roar from the side street shattered their momentary peace, and they immediately took off.
“Hmm,” he said, opening his wardrobe and looking in the mirror. “I like the way it fits. It feels nice.” He turned to Sherlock, who was frowning. “What?”
John was struggling to keep a straight face. His mouth twisted and his skin crinkled at the corners of his eyes, and the sight made Sherlock warm in his stomach and all of a sudden he thought he might be sick – but Dr Hope glared daggers at them from the front of the classroom, so they both lowered their heads and focussed intently on the paper in front of them. Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock could see John convulsing silently with laughter, and Sherlock’s stomach was still turning but he felt the very opposite of ill.
The comments swirled around his mind -
They both stood for a moment, looking out of the window at the setting sun.
“This is for a case.”
“Mhm.”
John, for lack of anything helpful to do, made them both tea, and when he returned to room twenty one, when he stretched out his arm, when he offered the mug to him, his roommate looked up at him from his seat on the floor like he didn’t recognise him at all. It was just for a moment, but in that moment, in those eyes, John saw that Sherlock had opened all the windows and doors of his mind palace, the curtains fluttering in the biting breeze, all the lights off, and he stood on the porch with a box of matches in his fingers.
They ground the ‘nitre’ and ‘incense’ using a mortar and pestle, adding a stick of bubble gum John had found in his backpack.
“It’s a little café in the village. They do the best hot chocolate there,”
“Why would it be cruel?”
“You’re going to be fine,” John said. “More than fine, you’re going to be amazing.”
“Hi, sir,” John greeted him as he and Sherlock wandered into the common room.
“If you are interested in taking part in this programme, please come and collect this leaflet from me, then off you go to your lessons, and don’t dawdle!”
Sherlock felt very small, then.
“What do you think?” he asked, donning the thing and peering at himself in his mother’s mirror.
“Orthostatic hypotension,” Sherlock mumbled.
The first boys to race – backstroke – gripped the bars of the starting blocks.
“Never have I ever slapped a sibling.” John and Mike both clapped.
“No, sir. I don’t.” Sherlock insisted, revelling at the way the two teachers shifted.
“Fucking year tens,” John said as he walked in. “I was happily showering away when I hear all these little feet like a stampede of baby elephants and then, like, three hundred of them flooded into the bathroom.”
Respiration, all that combustion, just to keep the boy beside him walking.
John came up behind him. “What are you drooling at?”
“I’m going out.”
, John tried to say with his eyes.
No, he wasn’t telling the whole truth. Not at all.
Sherlock opened his mouth, evidently about to unravel the whole spiel of his deduction, so John interrupted, for all their sakes. “He just knows things. Like I said.”
Sherlock, having taken up his favourite spot in front of the window again, turned to him, mouth twisting into the beginning of a smile, before turning back to the view.
“There would be absolutely no point whatsoever, John. It would not accomplish a thing. God knows I’ve tried."
“What did you mean about withdrawal earlier?” John asked, sketching.
“Sherlock, I want to – ”
His gaze caught on the fingers of Sherlock’s left hand as they gripped the neck of the violin, pressing down on the individual strings with precision as his other hand drew the bow smoothly across them. John rarely saw his roommate play with his eyes closed – he usually only did it when he was thinking extremely deeply. There was a small crease between his eyebrows, and occasionally his mouth would twitch as if anticipating replying to someone.
He watched as his friend calmly crossed the room. “Taken care of,” he said vaguely and sat on the bed next to the boy. And sat there.
Only when John was standing outside Frank did he realise that he was in his pyjama bottoms - not the best attire to wear to barge into a girls’ house. Before he could get very far into his debate over whether to stay or go, Sarah opened the door.
Or not.
Sherlock scowled. “Thinking,” he said shortly. “About Angelica. If we are dealing with some substance – of which there are many, I’ve checked – that makes people forget things, then if must have been put into her bloodstream without her knowing.”
“…Doyle, with
There were large photographs of the winning pieces, with short interviews with their creators – Sherlock wanted to read Kate’s, but John turned over the page and to reveal all of the runners-up. And there was a photograph of John’s piece; it was difficult to appreciate it fully in such a small image of it, but Sherlock was again struck by his friend’s skill.
, rang Mike’s words from earlier.
Sherlock fumbled, and John watched him totter, but he regained his balance and tried again, with a little more success. “Who made you the font of all ice skating knowledge?”
“By ‘we’ you mean you and your uncle?”
Anderson looked at him, evidently not liking being interrupted. “But,” he continued. “Yesterday, she rang me in a total fit, yelling down the phone, saying she’d had enough of my bullshit, and I was like, what bullshit? And she said something about me forgetting her birthday yesterday, but I didn’t! I bought her chocolate and everything, I spent, like, three hours with her, even – ” he lowered his voice, “Even fingered-”
John wasn’t really sure what had just been negotiated in front of him, but Sherlock was striding off out of the room and Mycroft was following, so he followed suit.
Jamie reached out to pick up a bottle, but Smith slammed the door shut, nearly chopping off the boy’s hand and making Molly jump.
Sherlock straightened up, trying to hide his exertion, turning to John. “What are you doing?”
“Did you say Anderson?” he asked, voice low.
“Sherlock, you do realise that you just left three dead animals on someone’s kitchen floor with absolutely no explanation of your plan, if you do actually have one?” John was saying to his friend as they walked.
He looked tired. Beyond tired. Beyond exhausted. Worn to thinness, worn to the edge of his limits. But then all of that disappeared.
John followed the sound of Sherlock’s footsteps, finding the staircase and taking it two steps at a time. By the time he got to Sherlock’s bedroom, Sherlock had his blazer and tie off and was trying to unbutton his shirt with trembling fingers.
“Sherlock.”
His thoughts were interrupted by Anderson joining the queue behind Sherlock, a couple of his friends behind him, sniggering. John immediately tensed up, but Sherlock seemed to not have noticed his arrival.
“What are you examining today, then?” John asked, seeing that that topic was going nowhere.
After dinner, Dave and Mrs Watson retired to the sofa, wine glasses in hand. Harry and Clara went to sit on the back step, watching the cloudless night. So, after a moment, John went up to his room, and it didn’t even cross his mind to feel left out.
John laughed. “And what’s wrong with that? These sweet hips have won me many a romantic conquest.”
“Well. Couldn’t look like a mushroom for such an important event,” he reasoned.
“I asked him if he knew any other songs,” Angelica explained, grinning.
“Anthea.” She went back to typing.
“Like what?”
“Get set,” and they tightened their biceps, rising out of the water.
“The other day, I was thinking about Nadia and Muhammad and their little code thing,” John said, the suddenness of his voice in the soft quiet making Sherlock open his eyes.
Sherlock and John stood on the edge of the pitch, watching the practise.
, Sherlock had said. “You said I must love her a lot. I don’t. I hate her. I wished her dead. But she isn’t. She’s brilliant, more brilliant than Mycroft and I combined. She drowned Redbeard. She told me she was going to do it. I didn’t believe her until my parents were taking his body away.”
“I think Dave’s coming over for dinner,” he said to his friend. “I told him about you,”
“You heard it,” Sherlock said, “did it sound fake to you? You said you heard him crying, or trying not to. You said you heard his fear. Do you think that’s something a computer can imitate? I don’t think so.” Sherlock looked over at John. He was looking at the floor, brow furrowed, breathing fast. Sherlock felt something move in his chest. He bit his lip. “I’m… sorry. I forgot that… It must really have been utterly…”
“July the sixth,” Sherlock replied, shoving his hands into his pockets, seemingly done admiring his gloves.
‘Manned the desk’ was a relative term; John spent more time pushing himself around the ward in the wheeled chair from behind said desk, which was what he was doing while Sherlock played.
John breathed a sigh of relief. “Muhammad?” he said. “Muhammad, wake up for me.”
“Are those my earrings?” Nadia said disbelievingly, picking them up and inspecting them. At this, John saw Sherlock still, and he slowly turned around.
John and Angelo had somehow edged towards each other so they were now inches apart. John was well aware Angelo hit six feet easily and John was… under that, but the anger that had been building for over a fortnight was broiling in his veins and all logic in his head had taken leave for the time being. John knew he couldn’t fight Angelo – he was bigger and stronger than him, and he and Sherlock were far outnumbered. But he could punch and run. He could kick and run. Knee and run. In the balls, attack his masculinity. That would be fitting.
There was a small thud as Sherlock rested his head against the glass.
Doyle’s chants had dissolved into intelligible screams of encouragement now, and the boys lining up for the next race were shouting from the poolside.
“Then, about one in the morning, he came storming in; banging the door open and letting it slam behind him, stomping down the entire length of the dorm to his bed and turning on his desk lamp, waking us all up. Glen’s bed was right opposite his, so he told Sherlock to shut up.”
As he dragged his suitcase down the corridor, the hubbub of voices coming from the ground floor grew louder. He bumped it down the stairs, the foyer beneath him swarming with boys and their parents, the floor barely visible beneath a layer of bags. He checked his watch – the cab was supposed to be arriving any minute.
, John thought to himself,
“I swear that, like, half their house is in the choir, though,” Mike grumbled as the head of Tolkein went to collect their award. John shrugged.
[in which there is a bright yellow disposable camera]
Time passed in long bursts of short races, and John looked at the clock and the gala had been going on for forty five minutes already.
“On the way to wha- hey!” Sherlock yanked a jacket off its hanger and thrust it at John.
“After that, I told him why I went, obviously. Secrets are an exchange. Then we parted and I saw him again the week after, as usual. At some point I gave him my number, and we started texting.”
A tremendous roar erupted from those spectating on the sofas, and John looked up to see Freckles’ character crossing the finish line in second place, with Mike’s following in seventh. John laughed at the strange situation of a bunch of teenage boys being so competitive over a crappy Wii game - most of the other houses John had visited had Xboxes, but Lestrade had obviously spent the house funds on something else – his divorce, according to Sherlock.
It was a brief reprise of the peace in each other’s arms with the chaos of the rugby pitch swirling around them, and it was over when John’s mum shouted at him from the taxi.
What came out was, “What if we just ran away?”
“You’re not from ‘round here, if I’m correct..?”
Sherlock opened both eyes and brought his hands to his chin. “A boyfriend?”
At this, there was an explosion of high-pitched screaming from the back of the hall, presumably from Rowling. Their head walked to the front and collected a small trophy, the rest of the school clapping obediently.
Harry yawned.
Sherlock made a noise of frustration. “He’s the nephew of a teacher, for god’s sake, I think he’s fine.”
There was a small gathering of boys crowding the head of house’s doorway. He chatted with a couple of year tens while he waited, who were delighted to tell him more of the previous year’s debauchery. By the time John reached the front of the queue, his mind was made up. Sherlock was going if he had to drag him there by the earlobe.
“Don’t lie to me again.”
“How many people have signed up so far?” John asked as Eddie finished writing.
A storm was moving in from the North Sea, he’d heard it on the news that morning. Sherlock had been with him, and John swore to Mike later that his roommate’s eyes had lit up. Sherlock would be the type to be excited by such news, and John wondered if he was sitting in his anthropology lesson listening intently to the wind that was just beginning to pick up outside.
John raced through vague memories of mandatory drama classes of his youth, mainly spent astutely not paying attention, as he let his own face fall into something resembling the carefree look on his roommate’s.
Sherlock had finished his hot chocolate, and in equal parts had hated it and wanted another. But he couldn’t move from the spot he was standing in.
Sherlock could feel himself grinning back. He was always astounded by John’s ability to make him smile. He wasn’t entirely comfortable with it. It was disarming.
Sherlock, having been shown around the technicians’ rooms and all the cupboards (which wasn’t necessary because he’d broken into nearly all of them many times before, but he neglected to mention that), and had been left to stack some left over things from a lesson earlier that day.
, she wrote on her pad. Reading upside down was a skill John had found it very useful to acquire while in therapy.
Sherlock nodded, straightening up and wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his jumper.
“Hi,” John flashed his most winning grin. “Yeah, do you know where the sports hall is?”
“No, no, no,” Sherlock said, getting up and pushing John out of the way. “You’ve messed up the index.”
“W… what?”
“John, I’m dying,” Sherlock moaned thickly when he could speak again.
“Sulky? I’m not sulky.”
Those therapist sessions were always the same. The same supposedly innocent questions, the same unfailingly accurate inferences from his answers. Trust issues. Duty. Guilt. Introversion. Afraid. Having trouble moving on. Psychosomatic. PTSD. All jabs with sharp needles at his life, each one hitting the veins anew each time.
“See you then.” Without waiting for a reply, Mycroft ended the call.
but John didn’t give it time to gestate, as Sherlock gave John’s arm a light squeeze –
John turned the tap off and wiped his hands on his jeans. “So. Bond?”
“Do you want a break?”
John sighed, and said, “By that he means that it was our pleasure. Well, not pleasure, but you know. You're welcome.”
Next to Sherlock, John always felt underdressed, even when they were both in their pyjamas.
Sherlock was suddenly enveloped in John’s arms. It was a little bit of an awkward angle, seeing as Sherlock was sitting cross-legged and John was kneeling next to him, but John had his arms tight around Sherlock’s neck and he was warm and Sherlock could feel him breathing, laughing, feel his chest move against his own, and it was the first time Sherlock had been embraced like this by someone other than his mother.
Sherlock gestured at his experiment. “Busy.”
Lestrade was standing on the bottom step in the foyer. “Dress rehearsal in the assembly hall in fifteen, boys, don’t forget.”
He stumbled back to the sinks and threw the bags down.
“It’s like you were trying to fricking galvanise my face or something,” John called from the bathroom. Sherlock was sitting on John’s bed in his pyjamas, pulling on a pair of his roommate’s socks – it was beginning to become something of a tradition.
Mrs Watson slapped John on the arm. “Oi, be grateful.”
John had made the mistake of asking Sherlock what he wanted to do next, and so found himself getting off the Tube at St James’s Park and walking in the spitting rain to Victoria Street. And walking in the spitting rain down Victoria Street. And standing in the spitting rain outside New Scotland Yard.
“Christ’s sakes.” Smith got up. “Still causing me grief in death, this little bugger is. Give me the file. I’ll do it if you’re so morally opposed to it.”
John looked back at Sherlock, waiting for him to do something. He supposed he was going to have to. John probably thought it to be important, for whatever reason, and Sherlock
“What is it? What’s happened?”
“Now.”
“You know I can’t stand tardiness. I expect better.” Gregson looked suspiciously at John. “And who’s this?”
He made his way to the deep end of the pool, stepping up onto the ridge from which he had dived in the house swimming competition. He looked around, eyes searching in the low light for something, anything out of place.
“Alright, Scrooge, but we’re here now, so shut up and help me find cheap jewellery.”
John handed Sherlock his drink and knelt down next to the boy – Louis, he remembered now. “What happened, buddy?”
“I think you mean essential scientific apparatus,” Sherlock interjected, getting up and moving out of frame.
“Uh,” faltered John. “Right,”
There was a chink in the curtains that let a stripe of orange light from a street lamp outside fall across John’s cheek.
“Potassium,” John said.
“What do you think of Viola?” Sherlock asked once they were a safe distance away.
Sherlock groaned again.
John couldn’t help giggling.
“Not hungry.”
In the end, John decided on his embarrassing Christmas jumper that he’d worn on the twenty-fifth. After having dressed and eaten, his feet took him to his front door.
Sherlock looked back at Molly and pursed his lips, but there was a gentleness in his eyes that said he understood. He seemed to deliberate for a moment, before leaning in and placing a soft kiss on her cheek. “Thank you, Molly.”
Sherlock lined up with Doyle’s other three senior competitors, gnawing at the strap of his goggles. John could feel his nerves from where he was standing.
“No, why since school broke up?”
“We have about ten minutes, maximum,” Sherlock said quietly, as he turned them off the road and down a hill, across a field and into the woods, their running slowing to a more comfortable jog when they were under the cover of the trees.
Sherlock looked at him, and John couldn’t read his expression under all of that fatigue. “Tomato and basil,” he corrected after a moment, and took the cup and bread John held out to him.
“You what?” John replied, incredulous.
“Hmm… do people… like me?”
John held eye contact for a moment but the weight of the sadness in Sherlock’s eyes was too much, and he looked away. “You must love them a lot,” he said, tears making his voice stick in his throat. He coughed them away.
John was quite pleased with himself. Sure, he wasn’t going to challenge the notorious Holmes any time soon, but he still felt clever.
“We’re playing
“We should go,” Sherlock said, breaking the quiet.
“Consulting detective, mum.”
John returned his gaze to their feet. Sherlock’s socks, as deep a purple as his shirt (that was, John noticed, a little untucked, which was almost –
“Mum, can we have a horse?”
John realised very suddenly what was ailing the girl when she stopped speaking halfway through telling him her name and put a hand to her mouth. John scrambled behind the desk for the bin and handed it to her, rushing around the side of the desk to hold back her hair as she vomited.
Two pairs of eyes watched her go, and then John sighed, turning to Sherlock.
“He nearly did.” Mike answered. “Because it was only the first time he’d been caught with both the smoking and the drugs, he was only supposed to get suspended for ages, not expelled. But because this all happened just a few months before our GCSEs, that couldn’t happen without affecting his grades. There was a big fight about it between all the important teachers. Most of them said that even if he was suspended, he was clever enough get all A-stars anyway, even without the last few months of preparations. Lestrade, and maybe two others, said the opposite, and it took some doing, but finally, they managed to win the others over. If he ever does it again, though, the cocaine or the smoking, or anything else for that matter, he will get expelled on the spot. And probably arrested.”
The first house up and began to assemble on the stage, a collective confused mumbling spread through the hall – it seemed only half of the Dickens boys were there, and they were all in what looked like basketball uniforms.
Sherlock pushed open Mycroft’s door. His older brother was sitting at his desk, working.
“Oh,” Sherlock stood up and straightened his shirt. “Right.”
“I – uh,” John took a breath and tried to steady himself, but to no avail.
“What?” John asked, but Sherlock doubled back and took the bottle from John, finishing it in one go. John took the empty bottle back off him and followed Sherlock into the drawing room. Mycroft was already seated at the piano, and a small crowd had gathered. Word had spread.
Charlie opened his mouth, but was blocked from saying anything by John’s fist colliding with it. John heard Kitty and Sarah gasp, Sarah saying his name, but John was advancing on Charlie, and then they were tussling, and then Charlie was on the ground and John was on top of him, kneeling on his arms, fist raised - but a pair of hands latched onto it and Sarah was shouting at him to
“And? Why are you calling me at three fucking AM?”
Sherlock was sitting there, leaning back in his chair, a test in front of him.
Sherlock looked at him and narrowed his eyes. “Mmmm, no it’s not,” he put the mirror down. “At least, you don’t think so.”
Anderson hesitated before replying. “Yeah,” he said finally. “We’ve been kind of… on and off for a while. But recently we’ve been on, and I thought everything was fine – ”
generous,
“San duty,” John explained as Sherlock freed a chunk of muscle, placing it delicately on a square of tissue. “
He had previously thought that rugby was a mindless game, for thugs and brutes with more muscles than sense, but watching John play, seeing so much of his friend in those calculated movements, the dodges, the quick flicks of the hands making the ball spin so precisely, the shouts of encouragement – he was beginning to rethink.

“Where?” her brother replied, turning around and frowning. Once he spotted them, he got up and moved closer to inspect. “What the hell?” she heard him curse. “Sherlock, where did you get these?”
“Any time.” Sherlock nodded. “I’m serious,” John added. Sherlock nodded again, a little slower. “And reply to your bloody texts, don’t just ignore me for five days straight this time, yeah?”
“What about me?” Sherlock replied suspiciously.
The common room seemed very small, stuffed with restless teenage boys as it was. Someone had hauled a drum kit into the corner from somewhere, and many of the younger years were fawning over it in awe. John stood with Mike and the others, while Sherlock had been beckoned over to the rest of the musicians. John watched him – he kept clenching and unclenching his free hand and flexing his fingers. He didn’t seem to be aware he was doing it. Definitely uneasy about something.
“There’s some extra components, I think they’re optional – the frankincense and sal-ammoniac might be a bit hard to come by, but you kindly provided us with some rose leaves yesterd- ”
“Apologies,” he said. “It is a stupid name, though.”
John nodded once, expression sombre. “The syringe.”
John supposed he was right. Before he could answer, his phone vibrated with a text. It was his mother, discussing her and Harry’s travel plans for Saturday. John put his head in his hands.
“No problem.”
John spent the next twenty minutes in a disgruntled silence, as the girls grilled Sherlock for more and more daring deductions, and gasping at each one. Sherlock loved the attention at first – the limelight was more of a home to him than the fabled Holmes manor John had heard so little about. But after a little while, John could see that his friend was getting tired, the usual pleasure he took in making deductions fading and being replaced with irritation and weariness.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah.”
The baker nodded. “Well, welcome to the best bakery in Hertfordshire, John!”
When the congregation stood for the entrance of the headmaster, John looked between the bodies in front of him to where he knew the year eights would be standing. He scanned for a small head of dark hair, but all too soon they sat again.
“No problem,” Sherlock replied, in the same tone. Then, “There was a man who hung upside down for three days in 2008.”
He and his brother appeared to be negotiating something, and then Sherlock stood up. Mycroft did the same, and announced to the assembled what they were going to play, and it only then struck John that he had had no prior knowledge of Mycroft’s apparent piano abilities, but had accepted it anyway.
The table fell silent.
Lestrade had slipped away at some point in the last few minutes as well, so then it was just Sherlock, Mrs Watson and Harry.
It was cold and lumpy. It slid through his hair and down his face, but he could feel himself laughing despite himself. A rational voice in the back of his mind told him it would have been interesting to make a graph with units of alcohol on the Y axis and amount of time spent giggling on the X, but Sherlock barely heard it, as he was more preoccupied with chasing John around the kitchen, trying to wipe the concoction off his face and transfer it to John’s somehow.
“Oh my god,” John gasped. “Let’s have an Ovid pamper night!”
“Really? Oh. Well, she’s called Ella. Thompson. Ella Thompson.”
“This is a waltz,” John said to nobody in particular.
The competition took up a double-page spread, headed by the words:
“I thought I smelt you skulking around,” Sherlock said, trying to keep as still as possible to conceal his discomfort at her proximity.
He smiled to himself and wondered how long it would take them.
John pushed his maths to one side. Sherlock was still muttering to himself and it was intensely and acutely annoying.
“Oh, don’t be alarmed, John. There’ll be no need for that. I’m not going to kidnap you, although it is well within my power to do so.” The man had a voice like silk, expensive silk, and suits and fountain pens and debit cards and hired assassins. “No, I just want a chat. Take a seat.” He ambled over to John, twirling his umbrella.
“Yes.” Sherlock interrupted. “You’ve been writing that email for seven minutes and have backspaced about twelve times more than you have pressed the space bar. You’re not concentrating on it. Distracted.”
In answer, Sherlock opened the door and got out, rounding the back of the car and waiting for John on the pavement.
“Anderson and his Neanderthals.”
Forty minutes later, John was still sitting on the thin carpet, twisting the remote wildly in his hands, more focused than he would have liked to admit. Against all odds, he had beaten Charlie, and Sally’s friend Nat, but was now in the process of losing to Seb, who had tipped up at the invitation of Eric, who had also joined the noisy, whooping crowd on the sofas.
“Yes, those three. That’s Orion’s belt.”
There was silence for a moment. Then, movement to his right caught John’s eye and he saw Glen rummaging around in his pocket. He drew out a five pound note and slipped it, in a manner he probably thought was stealthy, to Claus, who looked smug. John’s mouth fell open.
“You should have thought of this earlier,” Sherlock grumbled. John had been struck by an idea on the walk back to Doyle from the san and had dragged Sherlock into the art block with him while he found some charcoal. Once had had got back to their room, he had put his headphones in and not spoken for forty minutes as he went over certain areas of his piece for the house art competition, which he was still not allowing Sherlock to see. And now he needed to set it, and for that he needed to go back to the art block for setting spray.
The man began by congratulating and thanking the houses for their ‘lively’ performances, and he seemed to be making his introduction as long as he possibly could – John heard someone in front of him mutter, “Come on, man…”
“Are you all right?” he asked, heart in his throat.
Some time later, John admitted defeat. He was lost. Again.
Standing was a little difficult; his leg was unsteady and beginning to ache. He didn’t want to leave Sherlock alone, but he had to. Had to.
“Let me come with you.”
“John, this is incredibly, uh, sexual.”
He couldn’t settle on a song, kept skipping through every one that his shuffle played, so in the end, he decided not to play anything at all, but he kept the earphones in.
“That you had to see it, that your gala was spoilt, I don’t know.”
“Here?”
Eddie blinked. “Who the hell is Barnaby?”
“Who is it?” asked his mum, turning down the radio a little.
John leaned back against Sherlock’s bedframe, feeling the room move with him. “So, Sherlock. First time being actually drunk. Rating out of ten, if you please.”
The singing that ensued wasn’t much like singing at all – more like a slightly tuneful football chant, but Sherlock’s violin rang out clear into the air, a singular cry like an owl’s in the night.
“You’re saying it’s from Lottie’s mum’s necklace? Mrs Turner the homophobe’s necklace?” John tried not to sound too disbelieving.
“This boy I knew,” John replied.
Sherlock straightened up. John took a step back. “Let’s go in.” Sherlock sighed.
“You ruined my drawing, you know. You made me jump.”
“All right, just asking,” muttered John under his breath as Clara pushed past him. He heard the door shut downstairs and then turned back to Harry.
“I think so,”
John felt the urge to shift closer, to wrap his arms around this soft, sleeping boy, to slip back into the realm of dreams, like he felt the urge to breathe. Innate.
“You have a younger brother. You didn’t used to get on with him when you were little, I presume; brothers rarely do. You didn’t really mind leaving your old school, as is shown by your lack of desire to keep in touch with your friends from back home, or your family, come to think of it. Your phone has flashed multiple times with incoming texts; Harry Watson, Mum Watson. You organise your contacts by surname, you're making it easy for me. An unsaved number - you mustn't care very much about that person, am I right? One interesting thing - nothing from your father. Suggests he's absent, doesn't care all that much about you - or dead, of course."
John woke the next morning to a bleary vision of Sherlock’s face two inches from the bars that stopped him rolling out of bed in the night.
“Is he?” John asked again.
She made him promise, as she did every time, that he would make an effort to see her more. And John felt, as he did every time, a wave of guilt that threatened to drown him.
This saddened John somewhat. “We can be your family for the day, then. We will cheer for you when you inevitably win the chemistry award.”
Sherlock smiled, caught John’s eye briefly. “It’s the details that make or break a man, John.”
“He tests all of his new pieces on me, dear. He didn’t tell me who it was for, but I see the way he looks at you.”
He must have made the floorboard squeak, because Sherlock halted, mid-note. The boy set down his violin on the windowsill. “Good evening John,” he said. “Have fun with Gregson?”
Sherlock pushed him backwards a little and John went to protest, but then the angle became just right for the sun streaming in through the windows to reveal a sloppy circle drawn in something greasy.
Sherlock felt heat rise to his cheeks. He opened his mouth and took a step back down the stairs, before taking a deep breath in. He closed his eyes and remembered John sitting on these same stairs not a week ago, reminded himself that John was waiting for him.
, it said– and he wanted to spit something scathing at them both but couldn’t be bothered.
“I’ll help,” he said hurriedly and followed Harry into the tiny kitchen.
“I’m thinking of being an army doctor, actually,” John replied. Instantly, he felt Sherlock still at his side. He fielded the group's questions - yes, he would actually have to go into conflict if he was called to; no, it wasn’t
“In your right mind?”
“Stop apologising,” she pushed him playfully. “Do you want to stay for a bit, or go for a walk, or…?”
Sherlock, on hearing John’s question, tried to wrestle the phone off him. John easily held him off by using his free hand to hold both of Sherlock’s thin wrists together. Sherlock was strong, but John was stronger.
John could feel Bill’s presence on the other side of the aisle in his English Literature classroom. He could feel his restless energy. The boy was buzzing.
“Why does it annoy you?” Sherlock asked as he and John made their way down the main street.
“…But I will do so this once, in order to prevent confusion in the future,” continued Sherlock, finally sensing John’s annoyance. “You must know that I have exceptional observational skills; I could deduce nearly everything about you before you had said three words to me, if you remember.”
John looked at his roommate, and it was impossible to read his expression in the blue-black dark.
started up on the stage.
“Oi, oi, shut up,” Lestrade stepped forward again from where he had been leaning against the counter. “This is one of, if not,
“What do you think, then, eh?” John said, and Sherlock turned around.
in the middle of an experiment – "
A hand on his head, fingers through his curls.
John smiled. “
“You like the hallucinogens, though.”
“Please?”
thought John.
His roommate had caught up with him, and was now walking beside him, a little breathless. Doyle wasn’t far now. Would just have to get to their room without John seeing him – and then what? Lock their door? How? With what? Barricade it?
Sherlock hummed in affirmation, then went back to surveying the room intently.
As John walked down the lower sixth corridor after his lesson, a great cacophony of sneezes could be heard from room twenty one.
“Not a word.”
’s story.
“Because your brother is your brother, not your servant,” John said, then paused. “Do you have servants?”
, Sherlock,” John replied as the boys on stage stepped forward and began to sing.
“That means it wasn’t Angelo,” John whispered to his friend.
and there was the science block.
“There could have been a delayed-action murder, though,” Sherlock replied. “Some sort of method that doesn’t kill the victim until possibly hours later.”
“Harry!” John screeched. “Fuck off!”
“God fucking damn it, man,” John exclaimed once he was inside and was getting his breath back. Sherlock took off his soaked coat and put it over the radiator. “Do you ever walk at a normal pace?”
- check out
, Sherlock could have said.
All of a sudden, the St Bart’s players put their arms around one another, shouted something, and broke up. John had the exact same expression on his face as Harry, and Sherlock felt his stomach twist in sympathy.
“I almost understood that.”
, John. Surely you should have realised that. I wasn’t intending on eating them.”
“Good, thanks. Although, I nearly got fucking kidnapped by a friend of yours on the way back.”
They went back to studying the pumpkin.
Sherlock tried to think back to that night, but everything was a little hazy and it took him a couple of seconds to see through the fog and remind himself of the details. He’d made a comment about them, he recalled –
Claus huffed. “Well, that’s boring.”
Dan was telling him about people John had almost forgotten about entirely. So-and-so is with so-and-so now, would you believe it? And so-and-so nearly flunked out of college, and, oh my god, such-and-such is pregnant but the dad doesn’t want them to keep the kid, and this and that and this and that…

There was a pause.
He stepped away from the bed and went to leave the room, but turned back. “At least take your tie off and get under the covers, yeah?”
, much like the one on Lestrade’s door in Doyle.
“And then, if that wasn’t enough, you know what they did? Guess what those little bastards did.”
“Composing,” Sherlock explained shortly, putting down his violin as his phone lit up with an incoming text.
The school buildings loomed ahead, their windows bright squares of light in the darkness. Two figures were walking across the grass ahead, facing away from him. One female, one male, joined at the hands. One of them was John. Even from this distance, Sherlock recognised his gait. The female figure was Sarah. Her gait was familiar too, but not as much.
John sighed. He tried to get an image of a jittery Sherlock sitting alone in some dusty Latin classroom out of his head.
“No, he was pretty tired last night.”
“I don’t know why I’m surprised, to be honest,” he sighed. “What for?”
“She’s gone out to the shops,” his sister’s voice replied from upstairs.
“Bye, John,” he heard Clara reply uncomfortably, Harry staying silent. John and Sherlock walked down the corridor in silence, but John could feel a laughing fit gripping him, so he sped up, hearing Sherlock do the same. He clamped his jaws shut and took the stairs two at a time, and was nigh-on jogging by the time he made it to his room, ushering Sherlock in behind him and closing the door.
And then his eyes snapped open again with the realisation that he had technically come out to Mike that afternoon. His initial reaction was something akin to mild panic. Was he not supposed to be feeling freed, unburdened? Why did he feel so… exposed? And then his mind fled down a well-trodden path:
“J… fuck. John?” Anderson called after him, and something in his tone of voice made John stop and turn around.
didn’t you tell me? You’ve got a lot of explaining to do, my boy.”
“Why should I?”
John heard Sherlock laugh. “You’re welcome,” he said. “I am also feeling a lot of thank you. Yours were far from shoddy. Was that the original version?”
“Well, not in as many words, but he might as well have done,” Mrs Watson replied. “You ought to read it, Sherlock, it’s interesting.”
“Right, on to the drawing room,” Sherlock said, leading John out of the library and back into the corridor that they’d come through. The next door down was open onto a room larger than the library, but just as stuffed with furniture. There was an impressive fireplace set into the wall on their left, above which was mounted a large television screen, the only modern feature John had seen in the house so far. Arranged around the fireplace were various sofas, and behind them was a grand piano, polished to a shine. The room seemed to run behind and underneath the staircase, and one of its longest walls was mainly comprised of huge French windows that opened onto a terrace. John couldn’t see much beyond the terrace, but it had steps which led down to the garden. The moon was just visible behind a tree, bright in the night sky. There was some music coming from speakers that John couldn’t see, quiet and classical.
“I’m sorry.”
“So, what’s your roommate like?” The un-asked question hung in the air above their heads, blatantly obvious.
Those blue eyes, bluer than usual under the stolen light, watched him so solemnly, and, yea, he felt he was swimming in still waters – but that was wrong, too. Surely.
Sherlock leapt up from his chair and began to pace. “We’re not stuck,” he said, “I’m certain we are only missing a couple of puzzle pieces, we’re so close, I can feel it,”
“What? Just tell me why you – ” A click as the line went dead. “Fucking hell…” John said to himself.
Anderson looked down at John for a moment, then shook his head to himself and disappeared from sight. A few seconds later, another boy appeared in his place.
“John - ” Sherlock had turned towards him bodily, eyes boring holes in John’s, but John couldn’t meet his gaze.
John was restless. He didn’t entirely know what to do with himself for the three hours until Sherlock was due to step off the Tube. He couldn’t hear any movement in his house; his mother had an early shift that morning and would already be at work. Harry would be comatose until midday, knowing her, and David hadn’t stayed over the previous night. So John got up.
“Well, not necessarily, I mean – ”
“I will not. It won’t help. Besides, it sounds as if you’re more than competent to take care of my injuries, Dr Watson.” John couldn’t help smiling at that.
One night midway through the week, John woke up when Sherlock returned to the room. It was around two in the morning, and Sherlock had wet hair.
“God,” he groaned, sitting up.
The dinner table was laid with candles and tall wine glasses, the roast sitting like a sculpture in the centre of it all.
“Do you think this and the Turner thing are connected?”
He checked his watch: just under five minutes until he could leave.
“Leave me alone, Mycroft,” Sherlock snapped, and hung up.
“Poor thing,” Mrs Hudson said, rubbing his back as he leant forward, shaking the last of the memory from his head. “And he has to do that every day?”
“John, phone away.”
Edit as of 06.05.2020 - I deleted the 'placeholder' chapter that followed this one in order to make way for the actual chapter 33. Unfortunately, that means all of your beautiful comments got deleted too - but I read and replied to every single one. I cannot express enough how much your continued support means to me. A long (but also incredibly short) year has passed since I posted that placeholder and I finally have a new chapter ready for you. See you in a few days.
He took a great gulp of air, and –
“No, he isn’t.” John corrected firmly, shooting daggers at Harry, which earnt him daggers right back. “A friend from school.”
“What a beautiful story,” John said. “Downstairs.”
“Long… story…” Sherlock said slowly, focused on his phone. “God knows I don’t
“Down here!”
“What?” John turned around to find that while he had been digging around in his emotional entrails, Sherlock had finished undressing and redressing. He was opening the door.
John’s first AS exam was held on the first Monday of the two-week exam period. He sat still in the heavy silence of the sports hall at his tiny desk as the invigilators waited for the clock to strike the hour, but his mind was in room twenty-one.
They watched as a paramedic checked over the man on the utility room floor. When John caught himself mentally taking notes, he asked quietly, “What did you do to him?”
“Hm. You don’t seem as stupid as the rest of them.” Sherlock said. “You might actually do quite well.”
, John realised as the game moved on, Claus putting down what he claimed to be two sixes.
“No, I – ” John turned his shower off. “I actually had a hunch that you didn’t think whatever she would find was important. I was just hoping you didn’t do it because you wanted her out of the way or something,”
He hopped down off the counter and opened the window, and the radio presenter’s rapid babbling was muffled beneath the drumming rain that had started up again.
“I thought you were with someone?” Harry queried. “You texted me about a Jeannette…?”
All too soon, Mrs Hudson was slowing down, and the car came to a stop in front of the path leading to the front door. John turned to her.
After the ensemble had played through the song a couple of times, John slipped out of the room with the laptop. Once they were back in room twenty-one, he set the machine down on his desk again and settled in front of it.
Sherlock instructed, “Step towards me with your right leg.” John froze. “I will move to accommodate. Step towards me.” John looked down at their feet. “John. If you lead, I will follow. You must move first, but I will follow.”
“And I still miss dad,” Harry whispered, barely audible. She felt John stiffen against her, and worried that she shouldn’t have said that.
John placed the fallen items on the desk, and picked up Sherlock’s coat. It was very heavy, heavier than he’d thought it would be. He laid it on the back of Sherlock’s chair. He was about to change into his pyjamas – not that he thought he was going to be able to sleep – when there was a knock on the door.
“Phase two,” John said. “I will go and find a shitty comedy.”
“How did you even do that?” John asked. “That was you, wasn’t it?”
“Which is why you mustn’t be confused if I forget something inconsequential, like who the Prime Minister is – ”
He lowered his hand.
More rustling, then the first note, and then it seemed the piece was over too quickly. So he played it again, and before he knew it, it was half an hour later and Harry was asking him what he wanted to do for lunch.
John rolled his eyes. “Ah, yes,” He went back to buttering the toast. “How could I forget. So what do you think this means?”
The voice cleared his throat. “John has just suffered a panic attack, but don’t –“
“This is just unfair, Sherlock.”
“Because I know those things make you uncomfortable,” he answered quietly after a moment of thought.
Angelo was slapping John’s face, and Sherlock felt himself about to run onto the pitch, to shout, to do something, but then he saw John’s eyelids flicker.
The clatter of John dropping something in the shower broke his train of thought. Now was not the time. He stepped over to his wardrobe.
“Probably,” Sherlock agreed.
There was a pause, and John debated telling Mike about the incident just days previous. He knew Sherlock wouldn't want him to, so held his tongue. They walked in silence for a bit, each absorbed in their own thoughts, John running what Mike had said through his mind again.
“Obviously,” John said, pulling the door shut behind him and treading carefully down the path. “But never like this. Never so… perfect.”
“No, sir; it is rather unusual, which is why we ask you to be sympathetic with his punishment, as this situation is rather an exceptional case,” Sherlock interjected slickly, and John had to admire him for his boldness.
Sherlock blinked. He was underneath something soft, a duvet, his shoes had been removed.
where God was. John felt himself shaking with adrenaline, and then he was in Angelo’s space and his hand was in Angelo’s hair and he yanked, making Angelo cry out in pain and stumble backwards, following where John was leading him away from the wardrobe by his hair. Once Sherlock had had a chance to step away, John let go of Angelo. He looked at Sherlock. “You okay?”
His suspicions were confirmed when, as hand collided with blazer, there was an unmistakable squishing sound. Anderson’s friends erupted into guffaws again, as Anderson removed his hand to reveal a squashed tomato now stuck to the fabric, seeds and juice dripping pitifully down Sherlock’s back.
Sherlock realised he was going to miss him. When they broke up for the winter and went back to their own homes, to their own bedrooms, to their own beds. Sherlock thought that his bedroom would be very, very quiet without the sound of John’s breathing.
“I feel the same,” John agreed, reaching for his jumper.
Snow. The first of the winter, and on Christmas Eve. He immediately took out his phone and texted Sherlock, before yelling to his family.
“Hello, Mr Rahman, Miss Bailey,” he said. “It’s wonderful to see you again,”
Henry muttered something in vindictive - “
After a moment, he reached for the cotton wool pads and make-up remover.
“Come down for dinner!” Mrs Hudson’s voice replied.
His pupils dilated, letting in light that wasn’t there, not really. Moonlight. What a fraud. A mere copyright scandal.
Sherlock said something to him that sounded scathing but John couldn’t get even a glimmer of meaning from it, which set him off again, feeling tears of laughter forming.
was soft and almost bittersweet, and it could have been the come-down after hours of nervousness, but by the second chorus, John could feel himself slowing down in the approach to sleep.
John watched Sherlock leave for his last exam in the morning. It felt like a part of him was being ripped away.
, Beyoncé crooned, and John put his face in his hands.
“Nah, it’s not that,” John explained. “Sherlock just got chased across a field by a farmer and he’s hiding in a bush,”
She wasn’t convinced. She got up and walked towards him, almost leisurely, and
Sherlock started for the door, but turned back. “John, I need my syringe from house, can I trust you to maintain the crime scene in my absence?”
The two made their way downstairs to find Mrs Hudson making herself a cup of tea in the kitchen.
“Can I go here?”
Baynes, his coach, a huge man that looked like he had been moulded out of permanently wet clay, had his back to him, shouting at someone.
John didn’t laugh at him. Not maliciously, anyway. He laughed at him like he thought Sherlock was amusing. John didn’t mock him – not maliciously. He mocked him like he was joking. Like he meant the opposite of what he was saying. He mocked him with a gentleness that Sherlock had only observed from afar.
Sherlock looked right at home in the low-ceilinged boutique, wearing –
Anderson cleared his throat. “Sir, I don’t mean to be insensitive, but would you mind if we, well, shaved your pets?”
“That colour doesn’t suit her at all,” Sherlock said in his ear, as if he knew exactly what John was thinking. Which he probably did, John reminded himself.
“Painted over,” Sherlock corrected. “That paint would have been too difficult to clean off in the ten minutes we were absent.” He inhaled and shoved his hands into his pockets.
“I what now?”
“Was I?”
“I’m Josh, this is Henry,” the one whose mouth wasn’t full of tiny pastries replied.
John was temporarily speechless. He glanced at Viola, who was looking at him levelly. “I’d – that would be awesome, Mrs Hudson. Thank you,” he replied. “If it’s not an inconvenience, I don’t want to overst– ”
“Uh,” John stammered. “I don’t - ”
Sherlock watched him sit heavily in the plastic chair, shoving his bag under the desk. He looked a little too old to be in year ten, Sherlock thought, shoulders a little too broad, face a little too defined. He adjusted his tie, his shirt, pushed up his sleeves to the crooks of his elbows.
“I thought I told you not to go looking for trouble,” Harry’s mother reprimanded.
“Shut up,” John said. He took a breath and, ready to continue walking, stood up. “Oh,” he said.
Somehow John ended up with Sarah leaning against him, her head resting on his shoulder. He had one arm around her, and he didn’t think he’d been more comfortable in his life. He could feel her ribcage moving as she breathed, and somebody else’s weight on his own was something that he realised, with a little surprise, he had missed. He hadn’t held anyone like that in a very long time – he hadn’t realised quite how long until that night. Sure, sexual frustration was a problem at Bart’s (the lack of privacy had forced him to become very good at quashing his libido somewhat), but romantic frustration was something else. Especially with a lifestyle that was becoming, as had been pointed out to him many times by many people, increasingly dictated by his roommate, it was difficult to find time to be involved with anyone. And that meant going without…
, Sherlock,” John repeated, quieter, softer, trying to make him understand, trying to make him feel what – “I thought my best friend was dying and I was doing a timed essay that determines my grade for this half term, Sherlock, you can’t just expect to say sorry and be forgiven,”
“I see.” John let go of Sherlock’s wrists.
“Mum, I don’t…”
“Not until I have to.”
“Do you get paid?”
John had to keep himself from snickering each time it was said. “Lestrade’s back, finally. Oh. He’s just found out about his wife’s affair and… yes; she’s moved out and they will be getting a divorce within the month. How dull.”
“You’re gonna miss finding out who’s head of house.”
When John flipped off the last remaining light, his customary “Night, Sherlock,” was greeted with silence, except for a quiet, sleepy snuffle, and John smiled to himself.
Sherlock wasn’t wrong. “Sure. Why not,” John agreed, aiming his tone at casual, hoping he hit the mark despite the terror that had begun to flood through him, but he knew that if he looked closer, he would see that it wasn’t actually terror. Not quite.
“Oh, just that I’d heard he’d beat someone up before,” said John carefully.
“Alibi, case – what?”
Sherlock sighed. “It seems there is nothing to talk about.”
John passed through an archway into the quadrangle, and braced himself against the biting wind that felt like sandpaper on his exposed neck and face. The floods of students pouring out from their classrooms gave no protection from the elements, and John was struck by the rather bizarre desire to be a penguin.
The black eye was obviously the result of a punch, which was obviously the result of something the girl didn’t want to admit, or possibly even acknowledge. How all of this was linked to the necklace he did not know, but Sherlock was coming to think of it as less and less relevant. The topic of John and Charlotte’s conversation ran through his synapses again. He himself had never officially revealed the nature of his own sexuality to his family; he didn’t think it was necessary to do so or any of their business. It was not as if it was going to be acted upon at any point – he had seen what that did to people. It was messy, mind-blunting and ultimately redundant. No. It was better to remain alone, with complete self-sufficiency and control. Too many variables otherwise.
“You’d better not be, Sherlock Holmes,” Lestrade returned, moving into his doorway. “Else I will find you.”
) diagrams there, as John was. “What are you so excited about?”
“Oh, god,”
“Yeah,” John replied. Upon seeing his friend’s blank expression, he elaborated, “It’s Sunday, Sherlock, so there’s a trip into town, like every other Sunday.”
“Never have I ever… I don’t know… never have I ever kissed a boy.”
– a smart shirt tucked into his high-quality jeans, and, of course, that bloody coat of his. John, on the other hand, with his worn shoes and unzipped hoodie – which he had just noticed a ketchup stain on – regretted following Sherlock in the moment he stepped over the threshold.

“And leave my poor hands exposed over the harsh winter? I don’t think so.”
She did not seem much placated by John’s meagre assurance, and held up the offending jewellery. “These were given to me by my grandmother,” she said. “If you’ve damaged them – ”

kitchen…”
“Oh. Hi, John,” he greeted him. “What’s up?”
John snorted. “What did you do today, Sherlock? Oh, not much, but I found a new gay dad on the train,”
“Come on, Green!” an anonymous voice shouted into the silence. A few people laughed, and an answering voice from the other side yelled,
“I’m going to go and put this upstairs,” Sherlock said, indicating his violin.
Sarah was leaning against the counter, arms folded across her chest.
John didn’t know how to respond. First and only.
“I forgive you because I found something I actually know.”
Eddie’s mouth twisted into a bemused grin. “Sure.”
And they were standing in the middle of the lower sixth corridor, and the walls were cream and there was laughter coming from the rooms around them, and it was only break time on a Tuesday and nothing felt as if the world was putting itself back together but it was and nobody seemed to be noticing.
“Oh! Yeah, I remember now.” John returned his attention to his washing, separating the colours from the whites. “What about it?”
“Yeah, shut up, Claus,” Mike said, then looked at him encouragingly, and John wanted to hug him.
I also know that Sherlock Holmes' birthday is widely believed to be the sixth of January, not July, but this works better for me, more of an age gap, as there is an age gap in the show and in the canon.
Sherlock laughed. “And why would I do that?”
“Now?”
“A cube of myrrh,” Sherlock pondered.
The first team had gathered in the changing rooms nearly half an hour ago exactly, and John felt like he was going to vomit.
John turned to look at him as if he’d just suggested they both sleep on broken glass. “You know you’re my guest, right? And guests get to pick everything?”
“His kids’ names all begin with J as well,” Sherlock replied.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, so John grabbed his arms and swung them back and forth until Sherlock did it himself.
“No,” John said, putting down his sketchpad, “we have to find Richie. He could be in danger.”
“That was appalling, John,” a familiar baritone tutted, making everyone jump. John turned around and was presented with the sight of a rain-drenched Sherlock standing in the doorway, his hair stuck to his forehead and dripping onto the already water-logged shoulders of his coat.
“Is that what you do? Rise above it?” Anderson asked. “You think you’re so superior, John, but just wait until he turns on you. He might not have yet, but he is a genuinely bad person. You’re too blinded by… by something, that’s for sure. Or maybe you do see it, but the sex is too good to make you leave.”
“Mum got me a new coat for my birthday, the one I’m wearing right now, and Harry got me a lab coat, and you won’t believe this, but she’s sewn
“Where are you going? It's getting good,” John whispered.
Sherlock almost chuckled at that. John was really quite oblivious – or pretended to be, at least.
“Hey,” John whispered to Sherlock. “You still going to – ?”
That was a little surprising, but Sherlock replied as if he’d been expecting it.
“Unlikely,” he said. John raised his eyebrows. They had talked about this. “But thank you. And you.” Better.
“I’m only playing.” John said. “I’d love to stay for lunch.”
“I’m going to miss the train,” John said, and he stepped in and wrapped his arms around his neck. Sherlock had the brief thought that he should probably not be surprised anymore when John did this, because it seemed John thought it to be normal – expected, even.
“I don’t have a mother.” He blurted. John stopped rustling about below for a moment.
John did as he was told, and watched Sherlock scrutinise him. Sherlock told him to turn around, so he did, and then turned back. His hands found themselves behind his back and he let Sherlock eye his torso. The weight of Sherlock’s eyes on his body was… something else. He almost felt nervous, almost self-conscious.
“Alright, give me a minute,” John replied. He exhaled slowly, and ducked his head under the window, not liking where his centre of gravity was pulling him.
“Yeah, that’s all,” John confirmed, but as he got out his wallet, his mind caught on something. “Actually, could I have two?”
“So…” John began.
The street was mostly deserted. John took in as many details of this small town as he could – the corner shop, the slush piled up by the sides of the roads, the traffic lights.
“Why are you asking me this? No.”
are going to pack, and if needs be, I will help. Come on.”
“Mm?”
“Do what you will,” Sherlock said, almost contentedly. “You’ll be wrong, but I’m sure the pursuit will be excellent practise for… for something or other.”
“Those,” Sherlock said, indicating a pair of leather gloves on the delicately-posed mannequin in the window display. “Mycroft dropped my old ones in the lake a few months ago and I haven’t been able to find a suitable pair since.”
John, Sherlock, Harry, and John’s mother wandered the long route back to Doyle under the pretence of showing John’s family more of the school - the rigid beauty of the quadrangle, the main cricket pitch where the first team were squaring up to face a team of alumni, the long driveway lined with chestnut trees that had been John’s first view of St. Bart’s. John’s ulterior motive was to give his mother more time to dote on Sherlock in the way he knew Sherlock liked but would never admit to liking, congratulating him on his award, chatting to him about exams, and sometimes saying
He did, of course he did – but Sherlock didn’t know how to put it. So he went with humour.
John felt as if he’d just swam with Sherlock. He loosened his grip on the rail and watched the mess of bodies in Doyle’s lane. Sherlock looked confused by his team’s celebrations, but he was laughing, and John grinned.
Sherlock, John and the girl, whose name turned out to be Nadia, stood in the doorway of the Year Nines’ dormitory in Tolkien house.
has changed because our education system is highly politicised; this is not the system followed by today's school kids. However, this is the system Sherlock and John are following in this story. pages:
“Remember, it won’t last, Sherlock,” Victor called after them. “See you soon.”
“Sherlock, I’m just going to reiterate: what the fuck are we doing?” John said, a little quieter this time.
He had tried so hard.
John stepped to the side to block Sherlock’s attempted exit from the conversation. “Sherlock. I said I wouldn’t lie to you.” This made Sherlock still, his eyes catching John’s. He seemed to deflate as he understood the implication of John’s words.
She was known for wearing a pair of heavy and immaculately polished army boots, and that day was no different. She had her hair up in such a way that would have looked pretentious on anybody else. Her smile of greeting made him feel sick.
“What do you mean?”
“Indeed,” Mycroft replied. “God knows why, he never seems to return the favour.”
“Uh, I don’t really know,” John replied. “Your sister is waiting for you at school, don’t worry about her.” He was interrupted by a small scuffing sound on the stairs and he turned, expecting to see his roommate. “Sherlock, he’s woken – ”
