“I noticed you're only working part time? Are you easing your way back into the work force? That's what I had to do too, initially.”
He spent the day in her hiding place, feeling more and more like himself the more rest he got. It struck him how incredibly lucky he was that he was given a chance to recover at all. And Molly did whatever she could to help, even if most of the time that was just hanging around to talk, usually in quiet voices just in case there were other tributes nearby.
can go fuck yourself. I'm used to your jabs and insults. Try harder.” He cut his eyes away from his father to his phone, which flashed with a new message. He picked it up, lighting up the screen, never having been more relieved to see Sherlock's name. The message was nothing out of the ordinary, just more of their casual day-to-day conversation, but it felt like redemption in that moment.
My phone chimed from my bedside table. A request for help from Lestrade, as was always the case nowadays.
“Then by your own definition, you were never in a relationship with Mary.” John paused, struck by the remark. “And by your own definition, many of the people who are getting married and having children or whatever it is people do aren't in relationships either. They're merely following a script. Better to be unconventional than hollow. Stop worrying about it.” Sherlock looked back down at his slides.
A mischievous light seemed to turn on behind Sherlock's eyes, and a smile spread across his face. He brushed his lips against John's cheek, and said in a low whisper. "Well,
"So, that's more or less the same conversation I had with Cathy. And I realized that I'd been having some version of that conversation with every woman I've gone out with, and they've all been right. None of them are ever going to compare."
He had only gone into Sherlock's room once after he died. Before, it had actually been a surprisingly common occurrence, usually for the sake of dragging him out of bed, or forcing him to get in it. Sherlock's sleeping patterns were notoriously inconsistent, given that he would work for days on end like an obsessive, and then would fall into long periods of physical lassitude when not otherwise occupied. There had been countless times that John had had to force him to sleep, physically pushing him down the hall telling him to go to bed. Sherlock always protested of course, claiming he was perfectly rested, and would always, without fail, be unconscious within minutes of his head hitting the pillow.
When John tried to sleep that night, Sherlock didn't leave, didn't go outside to keep watch. He stayed, leaning against the cave wall beside John. After a while of trying to get comfortable on the rock, John sat up, rolling his shoulders to work out the kinks, and sat back against the wall as well.
“Tragedy has stricken down one of London's most beloved citizens today. While investigating threats made against several museums and galleries in Italy, detective Sherlock Holmes was killed, gunned down in the Piazza della Minerva in Rome. Police reports state that the bullets were of military quality, likely shot from a long-distance sniper-style rifle. The shooting is quickly becoming the most talked about and questioned shooting since Kennedy. Many have speculated on who the shooter could be, comprising lists of all sorts, from James Moriarty's private army to an inside job organized by Holmes' own brother. Moriarty himself was also found dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The bullet in Moriarty, however, did not match those found in Sherlock Holmes.
John hesitated, hating his hands for being empty, for having nothing to fidget with. “You compared me to a dog the first day I met you.”
“Let me know when you're in town,” Clara said. John held the phone above his face, staring at the screen, the light emanating from it the harshest thing in the room. Aside from himself.
A man burst out of the trees. Sherlock remembered him. Henry, a tribute from one of the richer districts. Even in the dim light, Sherlock could see the blood. The man was raving, on the verge of screaming but never making a sound. He was hyperventilating, bleeding profusely from multiple places, and when he raised his arms out in front of him toward them, there was a bloody stump where his hand should have been. He was crying, desperately trying to get the words out.
Sherlock's eyes became animalistic then, violent and enraged. He took one step toward them – Moriarty standing calmly at the end of the sofa – and the red spots of sniper sights bloomed across his chest in a dizzying spray.
John stayed for a while longer, resting his head on Sherlock's shoulder. Sherlock would talk if and when he wanted to, even if it wasn't tonight. They were both too tired to do much more than lean into one another, bookended together on the sofa. John began to fall in and out of a light sleep, jerking himself awake every time he felt himself nodding off. Sherlock was always still beside him, wide awake, and apparently, deep in thought.
The music stopped, rather abruptly. "Use your brain, John. As always, you see but you do not observe." Sherlock realized instantly what he had said, and shut his eyes briefly, mad at himself.
Middle of the night, and a room that felt like an oven from the open balcony doors. John hadn't even tried to sleep, really, and none of his usual distractions were worth much in the heat and the glow of city lights. Sherlock had given up getting what he wanted from his phone, and had been reduced to smoking while pacing the balcony. John had chided him at first,
Sherlock didn't startle at his voice. In all likelihood, he'd known John was there since the second he walked in the room. He answered without looking at him. “I have never been one for long nights of sleep. They are a waste of valuable time.”
John followed him upstairs – slowly with the way his leg had been today – and Sherlock led him into the flat. It was a homey place, felt like a place Mrs. Hudson would own. It was certainly a step up from the bleak industrial strength beige of his current rooms. Better location too. He was so distracted thinking about moving that he didn't notice at first that Sherlock was standing by the window, staring at him like a science project.
Things settled into something like stability over the following days. Mary made frequent appearances, much to John's chagrin, and she always made such a clear effort to be pleasant that it sometimes made John want to shout at her to make her leave. But he still didn't know what to say, and wasn't entirely sure that telling her the truth would keep her from coming round to see them, anyway.
The sound of tires on gravel grew fainter behind him as the cab drove away. Sherlock had come up on a pair of officers whose backs were to John. He spoke with them, his lips moving rapidly and his face wearing the expression it always did when he felt intellectually superior, a sort of condescending tilt of the head that most people found insufferable. It only made John smile.
Sherlock stared down at the pavement beneath his feet as they crossed the street. “Running jokes require multiple encounters.”
“I'll explain it all soon, I promise. There isn't time right now. Have you ever had a reason to doubt me?”
John stopped in front of a large black and gold piece attached to one of the columns, deliberately warped in its carving to look like cloth. The effect was something like a Dali painting, a memorial that could melt off the column like the candles melted down till they extinguished themselves.
“Because I left the scene. You know how the police have interviewed everyone who was there and survived? Trying to piece things together? I left. I got out through a back door when they were busy defusing the second bomb. And I couldn't imagine sitting down to talk to the police about the explosion. I didn't want anything to do with it. None of them know I was even there. And I'd like it to stay that way. I just don't want to be dragged back into all of that, Sherlock. It was bad enough the first time. I'd really like to avoid reliving it for the sake of a police report.”
There were tourists wandering around just like them, most of them bubbly and laughing, completely unburdened by the things that seemed to follow John and Sherlock wherever they went. But even Sherlock seemed oddly at ease here, tolerating John's slow pace, enduring his enchantment with a city that he had probably seen a hundred times, mostly in silence.
The Hickman was one of the smaller galleries in London, certainly not as famous or as popular as the National Gallery or even the Royal Academy of Arts. It could never afford very prestigious pieces, so its acquisition of a piece of art as important and valuable as a lost Vermeer made the news for weeks during the buildup to the opening of the exhibit. John knew little about Vermeer, an artist who he hadn't seen much of compared to others, but as always, he couldn't keep himself away from the temperature-controlled, hermetic feel of the galleries.
“Yes, and I remember where you said you put your mobile number should a catastrophe arise in your absence. Goodnight, Dr. Watson.”
“Yeah. Most kids here spend their lives trying to sneak in,” he said with a smirk. “Very few are successful.”
Sherlock shrugged. “We are all incapable of escaping certain nostalgic aspects of our youths.” He paused, on the verge of saying something more, but no words came.
Sherlock stood in front of him, inches between their faces, resting his hand on John's cheek. He looked at him with a soft expression, eyes half-open again. John stared back at him, his laughter fading as he met the blue eyes.
“I'm a slow mover, Mary.” At least that was true. He now believed it was part of why he kept Sherlock at arm's length for so long.
I saw so much of their fundamental wrongness as a child. I watched my parents argue with each other, watched my father try to compensate for his indiscretions with flashy gifts. Mycroft tried to hide me from the fighting. He failed miserably.
They walked to the theater, mostly in silence. John never minded silence with Sherlock. When he was with any member of his procession of girlfriends, he always felt like the silence needed to be filled, that the absence of conversation was just making the tension build between them. But with Sherlock, every silence was comfortable. There was no malice in it. Sherlock of all people knew how unnecessary empty talking was. It was a trait that had initially thrown John off guard. He was not accustomed to peace and quiet in his life. And then he'd moved in with someone who could literally go the entire day without uttering a word. And he'd discovered he enjoyed it.
“What is this thing, Dr. Watson? How do they put entire worlds inside this box?” Sherlock walked closer to the television, his finger reaching out for the “on” button. John reached out and grabbed his arm.
"We sent a team up to the roof," he said, dropping his things on the desk. "There was a body up there. Richard Brook, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head."
So many nights, he spoke to a skull on his mantel, because there was no one else to regale with his motivations and back stories.
"Yes, Sherlock." John led him a few more blocks and turned into a small restaurant. It was the sort of place they always loved to go to. Tonight there were only a few other people there. On any other day, it probably would have been filled to the brim. John took a seat at a table by the window. Sherlock sat opposite him, against the wall. He always preferred his back against the wall, literally and figuratively. He stared out the window as the waiter passed their table.
Maybe the obsession with the night was just another of the supposedly universal human experiences that he didn't understand – and likely never would. It was honestly the least troubling answer. But now and then it would be nice, to understand the things everyone else did. The things he understood the general public didn't care about. No one wants to chat about iambic tetrameter or idioms in ancient Greek over dinner. They want to talk about their husbands and wives and children and what television show they're watching this week and how romantic their date was.
"You had me bloody worried, you know that! You weren't answering your damn phone! Did you not go to the hospital? We're going."
Sherlock wanted to turn and run the other way, but the fog was the other way. He was frozen in his place, watching John go in and out like the other tributes had, reappearing a little bit closer every time.
“What on earth did she want from you of all people? Usually it's the other way around, people always kidnapping and threatening you to get to me.”
"Jesus Christ, Sherlock!" The tone was both concerned and admonishing. "Where have you been? What the hell happened?"
Sherlock groaned as London stopped. It was happening more and more often of late. He had determined that there
“I have no illusions that I'm victor material. But I'm not going to do anymore damage than I have to. I've just been hiding. It's my only chance, hiding and hoping everyone else gets killed first. No offense.”
It was a slow few weeks, a marathon rather than a sprint toward recovery. Sherlock was a little foggy from the pain pills and generally seemed content to stay home rather than chase after criminals for a change. And thankfully, Sherlock didn't argue with John about hardly anything, actually listening when John would tell him to eat something or go to sleep.
If he was going to develop an addiction to cope with the way his life had turned out, then he thought that Sherlock Holmes was a pretty good one to have.
Of course there was a logical reason behind his choice. Wasn't there always? Even if it was self-serving, Sherlock Holmes always had a reason.
Sherlock was not one to grow sentimental, but he had woken up that morning with a terrible sense of solitude and found himself in one of his blacker moods. What was the point of doing and creating extraordinary things if no one was there to bear witness to the creative process? In a fit of annoyance with himself and the world, Sherlock drew someone he considered to be the ideal audience.
Later that night there was a knock at the door. John thought about ignoring it, even though Mrs. Hudson wasn't back yet to answer it for him. He even considered opening the door to whomever it was and telling them to kindly go the hell away. He was beyond not in the mood to interact with other people. But thankfully, the person didn't knock again. John sank deeper into his chair, relieved.
Throughout the day, Sherlock kept his distance. He hadn't spoken at all at dinner the night before, and had slammed his bedroom door without even a passing glance to anyone else. The parade had seemed to exhaust him more than any amount of physical activity would have. And all day, John had watched him go from station to station. He split his time evenly between all of them, not giving anyone any indication what his strengths or weaknesses were. John wasn't sure that it was a calculated move, or if Sherlock genuinely felt he needed practice in all areas. If so, John hoped he had a steep learning curve.
I thought I had gotten away with it, that he would let it slide, until, nearly an hour later, he spoke again.
Sherlock led John back away from the falls' edge, his hand on his back. He still had the gun in his other hand, and he almost dropped it in the water when he realized.
Sherlock ignored the comment. Mike was always convinced he'd get along with one person or another. He hadn't been right yet. Although that was more Sherlock's fault than Mike's. There had been Sebastian, a literary agent who worked primarily with young adult fiction who appeared to be in a state of suspended adolescence himself. There had been Greg Lestrade, who wrote true crime books, but whose writing was so basic and his choice of cases so banal that Sherlock couldn't stand discussing crimes with him at all. He had gotten along half-decently with Molly Hooper, who wrote science textbooks, but she had been so clearly infatuated with him that it was physically painful. Oddly enough, the one he had gotten along with the most was Martha Hudson, his landlady, who wrote little domestic columns and articles for women's magazines. But generally, Sherlock dreaded any introduction of Mike's. He managed to find the strangest people. He also couldn't believe that Mike knew this novelist well enough to know how they'd get on.
Sherlock was grateful when he saw the slow even breathing that told him John was asleep again. He sighed in relief. It was getting harder to remain detached in all this. He was glad John couldn't see his face. He couldn't guarantee that his eyes wouldn't betray him. He was supposed to be a sociopath, not someone who practically moved into a hospital room to keep someone from having to wake up alone.
“If that was true, you wouldn't spend so much of your free time in here while I rehearse the shows.”
Normally, he would avoid drinking after work, given his sister's history, but there were some days that were so long and so awful that any sane person would reach for a bottle.
“Look,” he said, setting his silverware down, “can you please just, not mention to anyone that I was there that night?”
Once the fire burned strongly enough to his satisfaction, he moved to the bookcases. All he was missing was a glass of whiskey, he thought.
“What do you mean?” Sherlock sat back from his microscope, removing the slide and replacing it with a new one.
A change came over the man's face, something like awe. “Oh my god. I know who you are.” John waited for the inevitable association with Sherlock. He had grown used to his name being tacked on in all the stories about Sherlock's victories, and though it didn't happen every day, there were always people who read the news stories closely enough that they had heard of him. “James has talked about you a lot. He speaks so highly of you. Christ, I owe you one.”
"Thank god," Sherlock mumbled, using his free hand to pull John's face those last few inches closer, sinking into a kiss. They could feel the breath pass between them. John sighed, and he felt the curve of Sherlock's lips against his as the detective smiled. "The Christmas gift sufficed, then?"
Sherlock didn't answer right away, but did fall silent for a few seconds, a grin at the edge of his lips. He smiled more when he was drunk, John noticed. Or at least, he wore more of those unpracticed, uncontrolled smiles that were always such a rare occurrence on any given day. When Sherlock spoke, he did so with a dismissive little shake of his head. “Just an old song I used to hear when I was a child.”
What if the police started really trying to account for all the art? For the status of the lost Vermeer? What if instead of assuming it had been destroyed they believed it was stolen? What if they had a call line and what if this man remembered John, remembered him walking away with the painting. What if the man saw it as an opportunity to make cash from reward money? But surely he wouldn't remember John, right? It was busy and dark and crowded. People get distracted during disasters. What were the chances of some random bystander remembering him?
“Anyone you want to say hello to while you're up here, Sherlock? Girlfriend or boyfriend?” Lestrade gave him a teasing grin.
Lestrade sidled up next to Sherlock, another drink in his hand. He had been going at it steadily all evening, high on his successful interactions with Molly. He smiled at her from across the room while Sherlock looked in the opposite direction. John, talking to Mary.
Sherlock refused to let John leave, despite his comment about needing to get home. Finally, John gave up, accepting Sherlock's offer of one of the guest bedrooms. “Just in case,” Sherlock said. “Just in case there are delayed effects.”
Sherlock held the book above his head, the cover displayed for all the eyes that had turned to him. “Harry?”
John wasn't sure what Sherlock was expecting. Shock? Horror? Disgust? But it was clear he hadn't anticipated calm. John walked up to him slowly as if he were an easily startled animal. He reached out and took hold of Sherlock's arm, layers of shirt and coat sleeves between them so their skin wouldn't touch. Sherlock let himself be led back to the house, watching John warily for the entire walk.
instead, when there was adventure and heartache and redemption and art come to life and all his wildest dreams realized at last in reality.
Mary blinked back a few stubborn tears and shook her head. “I wish I believed that.” She knew that if there were women or children from the other Districts left in the arena with him that he would sooner kill himself than them.
Even though his body was gone, Sherlock could almost see an imprint of him like a ghost, still standing by John holding a knife to his neck.
“To do something like this over a fight with a girlfriend. Anytime you argue with anyone you usually just brood for a few minutes and change the subject. If you're really angry, you might walk away for five or ten minutes to get some air, but you don't take a train ride out of the city over a fight with your girlfriend.”
Sherlock glanced at John's vacant chair. Why did it feel like he was somewhere much farther away than any New Year's Eve party?
He didn't say so, but the remark relieved him. There was something to be said for always having at least one person you could count on to want your company, someone happy to see you at the end of the day, to share that morning coffee with.
“Big day's finally here,” Mrs. Hudson said, setting the tray down. She'd been excited about the wedding for weeks, though Sherlock couldn't possibly imagine why. “I think it's nice that you're bringing John.”
One night, John walked with Sherlock around the grounds of the estate. The gardens became even stranger at night, with the patches of shadowy barberry shrubs creating dark, threatening spaces throughout, contrasting sharply with the occasional hibiscus plants. Moonlight gave an eerie sort of feeling to the greenhouses, which although they were by no means abandoned or unused, certainly looked that way in the dim light.
Sherlock's mother came for him, and after many thanks, she led him out of the house. As the door fell shut behind them, he heard the boy say, “Can I go to sleep for a while?”
“Who did you get it for?” John asked from behind him. Sherlock turned to find John glancing around the room, taking in even the strangest aspects of his décor with cool detachment. At least one of them was succeeding at nonchalance.
He took the cloth and clean water, grateful she had thought of such a small detail, and washed away the blood and dirt. He could see the wound more clearly after that. It wasn't quite a puncture or a tear, but it was a nasty wound either way, and all he could hope for was that it didn't get infected. He took a liberal amount of the cream and smeared it over the wound, trying to work it into the cuts as best as he could. He could almost feel it take effect. Whatever Irene had managed to get for him wasn't just to heal the wound, but to numb the pain a little as well. It seemed to have some type of anesthetic properties. John gave a relieved laugh, resting his head against the rock behind him, the desperation he had felt all day fading some.
John waited for the inevitable, the explosion that always followed. In these dreams, it was always him, always appearing in Baker Street or a museum, or even on the streets. It was always him, in the same dark coat with the same small smile on his face, always looking like a better work of art than any man could create. And it would always be destroyed in the flash of an instant, taken away in a brief, miserable fire that would set of the sounds of cannons in John's head and leave alone in his bed, awake and shaking and holding his head in his hands. Sometimes he would try to resist looking at him, but he rarely could. Even if it wasn't real, it was still seeing him again.
Moran was an imposing man, fairly new to the office. He was tall and tan with sandy hair that he had slicked back neatly across his head. He had a sculpted square jaw and cold eyes. Whenever he smiled, even Sherlock, with all his limited insight into the subtleties of human expression, could tell it was insincere.
What year is it?” The man stood up, his coat billowing around him. He began pacing around the room, occasionally inspecting things that caught his interest. John watched him, his mouth hanging open.
He shook his head. "Nothing. Come on. You look like a mess." He gently took me by the arm and walked me to the toilet, sitting me down on the edge of the tub and rummaging around for the first aid kit. Holding it out like a display, he said, "You know, I never had cause to keep one of these around till you came along." He set it to the side and looked down at me. "Coat off. I can't work around it."
John laughed. "No. I can't imagine there being a woman who would understand. And I can't blame them, I suppose. But it's not your fault."
They went back to Rome without telling anyone, without giving any warning besides a cursory explanation to Mrs. Hudson on their way out the door.
Sherlock glared at the dairy section of the Tesco. He was quickly growing frustrated by the ludicrous amount of milk.
They went upstairs, Sherlock throwing his coat over one of the chairs at the kitchen table rather than hanging it up neatly like he usually did. He was still drunk enough to not care. John reached for the only bottle they had in the flat, grabbing two glasses. He filled them, and handed one to Sherlock, who drank it without question or pause as he walked into the living room.
Henry had run into a bedroom and hid under the bed, and John thought to himself that if this bastard dared to hurt that fucking dog that he would end him himself.
“It led you to Sherlock. Sherlock, he always pretended to be happy being alone, but I always thought that underneath all that bluster he was actually an incredibly lonely man. And even with his reputation, you know, aloof, no feeling, I still didn't quite believe that was really who he was. I've known Sherlock for a long time, John. He's been hurt so frequently, and finally he's happy.” She smiled, that warm expression that John associated solely with well-meaning grandmothers. “We owe you for that. For staying, for being responsible for him finally being so happy.”
Within days, new evidence was uncovered, evidence more or less exonerating Sherlock of the worst of the crimes people had begun to accuse him of. Everyone walked around pretending that they hadn't believed it, even for a moment, not wanting to be the person who doubted a martyr. The press turned as quickly as it had the first time. Now he was a hero, an innocent wrapped up in a madman's scheme.
Sherlock carefully got out of bed, doing everything he could to not wake John. He gathered his own clothes and dressed before quietly opening his bedroom door and stepping outside.
He set his glass down. “When I came back to England, a few months after the fact when my name wasn't in the papers all the time anymore, you know I dated this nice person for a while.”
Sherlock smiled, a little laugh. “I think it's well known that the only reason this building hasn't burned to the ground, the only reason the money is handled properly, the only reason that the kitchen isn't a toxic wasteland, is you. You keep this fortress from falling apart.”
“I'm not sure where my phone is, exactly, now that you mention it. I haven't picked it up for days.”
“I know what you meant. However I don't know why you felt the need to break into my house to tell me that.”
The thing about Baker Street was that it only felt like it really existed if Sherlock Holmes was in it. Sure, it was home even in the terrible interim, but it could have been any flat, anywhere. But his return, heavenly and surreal, brought the light back to the building.
"This is why I don't speak figuratively. No one ever seems to pick up on it," he said, voice trailing off toward the end of the sentence. John tried to work through his brain fog. Of course. Sherlock meant his own. Moriarty had said that he'd burn out Sherlock's heart, and had implied that that meant John. And now Sherlock was his eyes, until further notice. Were they really so close that their very bodies were interchangeable?
He got down on one knee, bracing himself as he aimed, the dusty, metallic target of the mine taunting him. One chance. One shot, and then run.
John shook his head, and didn't say what he wanted to, that he had trouble seeing his life far into the future. He always got like that when bad things happened. It seemed arrogant to presume he would survive very long, that to imagine himself being alive at sixty or even fifty seemed preposterous. So he kept things short term, fairly certain he could survive smaller intervals, even if the idea of surviving for longer than that was absurd. After Afghanistan he had lived only imagining a few weeks into the future. After the Hickman, a few days. Since Sherlock had been killed, he only allowed himself to see his life a few hours ahead. It was all just about getting through the next few hours, and then the next, and then the next.
So many of the night blooming flowers were white, and looked like stars that had been dropped from the sky to try and shine through the overgrown grass. Night gladiolas, lilies, and the distinct bell shape of the moonflowers. Sherlock pointed out all of these, naming those that John didn't know:
“Oh my God.” Her eyes scanned his face. “I'm so sorry, you have the advantage, I don't remember seeing you anyplace after the fact, you know, ambulances and police interviews? Most of the people in our room who lived were all sort of kept together when they were triaging us. There weren't many either, just a handful of people from the Vermeer room who survived.”
John could only find it endearing, and smiled at him, all the while running a hand across his cheek, his other reaching blindly for Sherlock's hand, any shred of open skin. He never wanted to take his hands away.
He stood over it for a while, hands in his pockets, staring at the bloom, at the way the harsh and bare greenhouse light cut at the soft shade of purple. It was a shame, really.
When she'd said, “I have something to tell you,” to their parents – John had long since figured out what her secret was – their father immediately laughed and said:
John only gave him a small nod, incapable of further speech. He went outside to wait for the cab in the fresh air. It was as sunny as one could expect from rural England, but natural light had never been as satisfying to him as artificial. He felt the book in his pocket, a talisman against evil, somehow, new to his life as it was.
John had said something to that effect to Mary, and when she insisted that the only solution would just be to go to Sherlock and actually
to speak. He stared at the rug under his feet and took a deep breath. “If you aren't comfortable with pursuing this case, I'll gladly tell Mycroft to go to hell.”
It wasn't an ugly painting either, and would have looked nice on the wall, even if he was the only one who ever saw it. But the jittery feeling in him still had horrible thoughts about police breaking down his door and arresting him for having it. So he knew that within hours he would banish it back to its suitcase in the back of the closet.
They froze, their gaze turning downriver where Jim Moriarty stood holding a bow, its arrow pointed at John. He was backed by the distant roar of the falls behind him, an elaborate backdrop in the masquerade.
“You have wings. Why do you have wings? Are you a ghost? Or were you always one? Are you an angel? Or is this part of a near death experience?” He spoke quickly, his words coming out tense and manic. John grabbed Sherlock's wrist and felt no pulse. He began to feel sick. Why was there still no pulse if he was standing right here?!
secrets he had. What if they encountered him somewhere, and he was exposed? What would he say? How could he ever explain any of this to a man who had never known the slightest bit of fear?
I mirrored him, my hand finding the base of his neck, and pulled him closer to me. His own hand dropped from its place, sliding to a halt on my arm. Again he said, "I'm sorry," and a few inches closer, he said only my name, but in such a way that his entire heart was in that one word. I responded in the only way I could.
John wanted desperately to know who the second person was. He wondered where they were, what type of person they were. He wondered if they used this ability for good things or not. And most of all, the longer he had the ability himself, he wondered what it would be like to be in this still world with someone else beside him, instead of alone.
Of course, there were still days made up of darkness and fear, days where he couldn't sleep because the painting would haunt him, but they grew fewer with each passing week. Besides, even people who had been through nothing but the trials of an average human life had dark days where all their demons caught up with them.
He was over the worst of it. All that was left was to play this damn waltz and get the hell out. Everything ached, a horrible feeling in the pit of his stomach.
John had thought about going out somewhere, or getting some things crossed off his to do list, but after standing in the kitchen doorway for a while, he decided to just sit and listen to Sherlock play. He could be ridiculous and baffling, but he was still intriguing.
Initially he thought his ears were playing tricks on him, somehow modulating someone else's voice, turning it into the voice he wanted to hear. But no, there he was, standing in the back behind all the seated audience members, the same cocky smile on his face that had so infuriated John the night they met.
John crossed the room and sat beside Sherlock on the sofa. He felt a twinge of pain in his leg as he walked the last few feet. Probably the beginning of all the aches and pains he would have now that the adrenaline was gone. Everything would hurt.
“I've been thinking. And I realized something. It's always been you. From day one, from that stupid car ride.”
The growls surrounded them as they crashed through the forest, a trick of the way the sound carried, making it sound like there were hundreds of hounds at their heels. They stumbled through the woods, trying to find their way, but really just running blind. More than once they had to grab on to each other to stabilize themselves.
John waited for him to elaborate, and when he didn't, Sherlock nervously glanced around the street. No cars to jump in front of, no reason to enter any of the stores and restaurants. He hadn't thought this through.
He wasn't looking at John, but at the Monet on the opposite wall, hands in his pockets, his face blank. It was rare for him to do that. Usually, John's subconscious could at least concoct a scenario where Sherlock would actually see him for a change. But maybe this was just another sign that even this small reprieve was fading, and would soon leave him entirely alone.
"Glad you like it," John murmured, distracted. He laid a hand on Sherlock's shoulder as he leaned closer to get a better look at the article Sherlock was reading. "I guess I was lucky Ms. Hudson was on holiday. Had she been here, you never would have been desperate enough to end up at Tesco. For a genius, you looked positively clueless that day."
John was sitting reading the paper when I stumbled in, and upon seeing me, his eyes widened in that sudden protective instinct he always assumed when I was injured. He crossed the room in a flash, arm instantly around me, supporting me and guiding me to the sofa.
“What's wrong?” he asked, coming to stand by John, looking over his shoulder at the photo, Mycroft's folder in his hand.
The alcohol affected John differently. Harry was used to it running through her blood, but her brother wasn't. It made him sullen and angry. But he was beginning to come out of it. It was nearing ten at night, and he had slowed himself down considerably, perhaps taking into account that he would have to get himself home eventually. She knew he'd never stay here for the night.
. But then when he asked himself why he still had it, all logical answers about arrests aside, his most frequent thought was:
John tried to get up. He had to get to his medical kit to try and help the other soldiers. But he could barely move. He could feel the blood soaking through his clothes, and he realized that one of the groans he was hearing was his own. He started growing dizzy, and knew he wouldn't maintain consciousness for much longer.
Sherlock stared back at the tabletop. “What am I going to do if there are delayed effects?” He spoke more to himself than to John.
“Hopefully.” He shook himself out of whatever dark corner he'd been in all evening. “I'm thinking Henry.”
It had felt like ages since he'd looked at the painting. It had become harder for the Vermeer to haunt him in the wake of Sherlock's return, now that Moriarty was dead as well. But Sherlock's words
,” John said, a little too loudly. A few of the nearby patrons cut their eyes to him. He sighed and lowered his voice. “Look, it's really not that complicated. We like the same things, we know the same people. She's smart and she's beautiful.”
When he came to, his hands were cuffed behind him and his legs and torso tied to the chair he was seated in. His head ached, and the cuffs were digging into the skin of his wrists. There was a man in front of him in a tailored suit, grinning maliciously. As the fog cleared from John's brain, he recognized the man from Bart's.
John was standing at the end of the bench, his arms crossed, staring at the floor. He nervously shifted on his feet.
“Can you imagine that conversation? Sorry our relationship isn't what it should be, Mary, it's just that I'm in love with my dead best friend still. Christ, maybe I'll luck out and she'll just break up with me.”
John stood and crossed the room without thinking, leaning one open hand on the arm rest of Sherlock's chair. He stared down at him, at his questioning face, and was filled with a sudden, irrepressible joy that there was no longer a need to stay safely on the other side of the gallery.
He walked over to her, kneeling beside her. She didn't cringe away from him; he wasn't even sure she could. Her blue eyes stared up blindly for a few seconds, the filtered slants of light coming through the trees making her squint, before they shifted just a little bit, to watch John. He had never seen such hopelessness. Her hand pressed against her stomach, trying either to futilely stop the bleeding or trying to somehow dull the pain.
John laughed a little, smiling at Sherlock. “Well thank god now I won't look like a complete moron at least.”
People were often described as being like drugs, but knowing John Watson made the comparison even more confusing to him than it already was. Drugs led to addiction, addiction led to pain, pain led to resentment, and on and on and on. But how else could people convey the sense of
"Sherlock had only been a child when it happened, his mother skirting around the word “hanged” like it was poison on her lips."
They were staging an intervention, all of them. They had had to do this once or twice in the past with Harry, and it usually guaranteed them a few good years where Harry kept her shit together, but the process itself was always arduous and usually involved at least three good shouting matches. He loved his family, as much as one can, anyway, but being around them never seemed to go well. Any interactions he had with his father were especially malicious, and at family events in recent years, John had grown very talented at avoiding speaking to his father while still maintaining something like a loving relationship with the rest of them. John would never forgive him for the way he reacted when Harry had first come out as a teenager. It had stripped all the trust from their relationship, and frankly, John wondered why Harry had any fondness for their father at all after that. Perhaps it was just a case of proximity; they all lived within the same few miles they had grown up in. That life had never been enough for John.
Sherlock looked up from the floor tiles, almost confused. He wasn't used to people worrying about what happened to him. People usually assumed that since he kept to himself so much that he needed nothing from anyone. More than once, he'd been convinced that he was only a brain to the Met, a hired hand for Mycroft. Not really a person. Being worried about, not for the sake of his skill, but for the sake of himself, was an earth-shattering notion.
The Vermeer was hanging on the wall. Plain sight. Staring him down. There was an instant panic rising in his throat. Found out when he was actually planning on coming clean about it. But his panics never could last very long in Sherlock's presence, and so he only sighed and said with resignation, “How long have you known?”
John sat in the cafe with Mycroft, eyeing the evidence bag on the table between them. He had always been suspicious of Sherlock's older brother, and this was not improving his opinion of the man.
“Why are they all fawning over him though? It's not like he's a Pulitzer winner.” Mike said nothing. Anytime the answer to a question should have been common knowledge, he wouldn't answer.
When the front door opened a few days later, John thought at first that it was Harry before he remembered she'd long since passed out in her room upstairs. Her methods of getting through the day were sounding more and more appealing.
“I'm at the Laurelwood shop for a reading and signing, and instead of preparing myself for it I'm becoming an accomplice in your literary homicides.”
“Yeah, Sherlock. The human heart wasn't exactly your most subtle move. Or the idiomatic use of 'struck by lightning.' ”
, James. Neither of us are used to that. It's strange, being around someone who is living life with so much enthusiasm. But it's nice.”
It took him far too long to realize that the shuddering explosion that coursed through the gallery wasn't a flashback.
Suddenly John felt like there was a palpable tension hovering in the air in the space between him and the corner. After too long a pause, Sherlock said, "Well at the very least, you will have a very interesting story to tell on your blog."
John looked up at him. He almost spoke, almost tried to come up with some sort of answer, but nothing would come. Finally, he just shook his head.
It was one of the child tributes, a little girl of maybe nine or ten years old. She had been stabbed in the stomach, a wound that would cause a slow bleed, a long death. Whoever had done it could have put her out of her misery, but had decided instead to let her linger, to let pain etch years into her young face before she died. John looked around, almost hoping that the other tribute was still nearby, that John had only interrupted their killing. But there was no sign of anyone. Just the little girl, in too much pain even for tears, her tiny body soaked in blood.
Mycroft looked back at him. “He has a point. People have been murdered for twenty pounds. People have been murdered for fun. It's not that great a stretch of imagination to think that a megalomaniac is bombing art galleries and stealing his favorite pieces. I've heard stranger things.”
But the man who opened the door didn't look a thing like any cook, driver, or maid that John had ever seen. In fact, he looked like any salt-of-the-earth type that one could find in well-meaning small towns all over the country, dark hair and bright eyes and an ease of motion that made him seem fluid and soothing.
Sherlock dragged a microscope across the tabletop, reaching blindly for mortar and pestle, for slides. He spent far too long examining the petals of the flower under the microscope, comparing the slides to others from previous generations, trying to find the difference, the thing that had allowed this single rose immunity to all his poison. Even the regular garden roses he had created that crawled across the grounds killed the bugs that landed on them.
“I think part of me is hoping she'll leave me and never look back, instead of trying to help and sticking around.”
Sherlock rubbed his finger across the paper, fixing a shadow on the man's cheek, like someone putting a darker shade on a lamp to soften the light. This man could never appear too harsh. He was not a creature of sharp angles like Sherlock.
He scanned his eyes over the room, looking at his weapon options. He had debated what to show them, and thought it best to play it safe, maybe show them some hunting, hitting moving targets with a bow or thrown knives. He had access to any weapon he could want. Part of him looked at the different racks of items trying to deduce what Sherlock had shown them, but there was no way to tell.
The room had almost as little furniture as John's, but it didn't feel so temporary. It felt comfortable, homey, like the rest of the flat. All over were little details that made the place so distinctly Sherlock's, like the periodic table on the wall. This room was
Sherlock looked back up at him, turning his whole body finally, genuine confusion on his face. “No. I thought that if you wanted to beat the hell out of me that badly that you would do it no matter the location. I picked this place because these museums were always stress free environments for you when other places might not have been.” He shrugged one shoulder, not grasping the gravity of his own consideration. “By all means, punch the lights out of me if it will help, because I don't really know what
“The entirety of the literary world,” he said quietly, more to himself than to her. The dark planetarium floor's carpet seemed more relevant than the supernovas. It was still, and silent, and empty. He had to force his eyes away from it. He stood to leave, but paused next to Cairns' podium, looking up at the simulated supernova on the ceiling, an artist's reconstruction in icy blue. “So what is that?”
saying, that he was successfully reading in between the lines. Just as Felix had never once explicitly said, “I am in a relationship with James Sholto,” John had never once explicitly said, “The love of my life came back from the dead.” But neither of them had needed to.
"Great. Just great." John couldn't help but feel a little annoyed that he was lying in a hospital bed for nothing. "How much longer will I be stuck in here?"
He was stranded in a crowd of people who were pretending to be his audience, when he knew that not a single one of them really understood his methods. They all fawned over the end result and congratulated him on his skills. He became less tactful as the night dragged on, and Mycroft chided him more than once.
“Don't you think it's odd?” He refilled his glass. “Two random people having a joint income, like we essentially do?”
“That's the general idea, I suppose.” Sherlock said nothing else, and John was beginning to think that he had had all he could take of conversation for the night. He was considering going back inside, maybe trying to lie down at least. Sherlock wasn't even looking in his direction anymore. He was staring off at the lit Acropolis. But finally he asked, “Was that the worst day of your life? That incident with Harry and your parents?”
– echoed so loudly in his mind that a sort of paranoia rose up in him until he saw that the painting was in fact still where he had left it. He hadn't realized just how fast his heart had pounded until he held the Vermeer in his own hands. It was safe. Of course it was.
“Absolutely. A writer such as yourself knows how to treat a book. I trust you've found it good reading?”
John cleared his throat and stepped away from Sherlock, letting go of his hand. Sherlock put his hands in his pockets, seemingly unfazed by the landlady's presence.
What could he really say to her? That he'd been broken so many times, and was finally beginning to feel whole again when everything was taken away? That Rome was harder for him to live with than the Hickman and Afghanistan combined? That his frequent solitary trips to art galleries were the only ways he could find anything remotely close to silence in a world that seemed to never shut up? That he had somehow fallen in love with the most extraordinary person on the planet, and that even more remarkably, the person had likely loved him back?
John slept fitfully that night, despite being on the most comfortable bed he'd ever known inside the darkest, calmest bedroom ever built. Even the slight motion from the train couldn't lull him into a restful sleep. He just lay awake staring into the dark, thinking about how less than a day ago, he'd been sitting at home with Harry, eating their meager dinner and planning the next hunt.
When he looked at John, he almost wished that he had been right in the first place. Being friends seemed to cause nothing but problems.
Even as he said it, the doors opened again and a woman in a long bathrobe came in and took a seat across from John and Sherlock at the table. She had a great mass of dark hair hanging loose around her and was wearing a self-satisfied smirk on her face. John had heard stories about Irene Adler. She was considered wild and uncontrollable back in the District. But she had at some point had enough of a handle on life to win the Games, at least. John could remember the year she was chosen. She had been fourteen at the time and had gone into it with all the confidence and vitality of a Career. John didn't watch the footage, but he had seen her after she came back. She spent her life as a victor drowning in debauchery and drug use. He'd seen her around the District with her “friend” Kate and her collection of syringes. But John was sure that was her way of coping with what she must have seen in the arena, so he couldn't really fault her.
The hands were so easy to finish. Sherlock felt like he knew them better than anything. Some nights he was sure he knew exactly what those hands felt like, so warm and strong, that he grew frustrated that the marble hands were cold and still.
“My mother studied mathematics, of course, and she taught it wherever we went. My father worked in foreign embassies, so we traveled a great deal. We never stayed in one place for more than a year, generally. I'm convinced that this upbringing is what initially led Mycroft to seek employment in the government.”
It was one thing when John operated under the belief that no one could place him at the Hickman that night. But the very thought of a single man out there possibly holding the key to his hypothetical arrest was staggering.
He nodded, his throat feeling tight, waiting for the news he had convinced himself he would have to receive.
I glanced at the blue scarf on top of the dresser. It really was not cold enough outside to justify it. But it seemed the best option.
At one point, they crossed through a piazza, and John laughed before he could stop himself, at the strange statue of an elephant with an obelisk rising up out of his back.
With her free hand, she reached out and pushed a small cup toward him without saying a word. When he picked it up, he saw it was water. She had dry ration food nearby as well, tucked into an open backpack. Cornucopia bounty, no doubt. He drank, not even knowing how parched he was until the water hit his throat. It almost hurt. Once Molly watched him drain the entire cup, she finally resumed her spot next to him, sitting comfortably rather than crouching in preparation of fight. He held the cup out to her, and she took it with her free hand, setting it down on the dirt and refilling it before handing it back.
Both of their heads turned to the hole above them, their eyes tracking the sound as it got closer to the ground outside. Sherlock's hands fell to his sides. They looked back at one another, and Sherlock opened his mouth to speak.
When Sherlock looked up at him, he smiled, such a loving turn of expression that John could never understand how anyone ever believed that Sherlock was anything but human. Perfectly, beautifully human.
“I didn't. They killed themselves. Those kids from the good districts, they think they're so much better than everyone else. Think they're smarter, stronger, better trained. They may be a couple of those things, but they aren't smarter.
It was a cold, clear night in London, and the two of them were out walking through the city. Mycroft had called earlier in the day, wanting Sherlock to come meet him to discuss a case, so naturally, Sherlock had put it off for as long as he could, and walked right past Mycroft's hired car to kill some more time. Mycroft had texted him, annoyed that he was so obviously indifferent to the case. Sherlock knew what the case was about, but he hadn't mentioned it to John, which wasn't unusual, since he had a great habit of dragging John off with him and explaining why after the fact. Whatever it was probably didn't involve multiple homicides, since he seemed to want nothing to do with it. John tried to narrow down possibilities in his head – fraud, protecting someone from the upper class, government issues, international crime.
His first few weeks with Sherlock had been such a whirlwind that it took him longer than planned to get truly settled in Baker Street. When he'd left his old rooms, he had done so quickly, throwing most of his things into various bags and suitcases with little thought. The only thing he had packed carefully was the painting, still cushioned by clothing in its suitcase. After meeting Sherlock, he had spent only a single night in his old rooms before leaving entirely, and as soon as that place was behind him, he felt that maybe, even if only in some very small way, the Hickman was behind him too.
Whenever the hovercraft would come to retrieve bodies, they would take whatever weapons were lodged in them as well. And Sherlock decided that the old man's sponsor should have to suffer the loss of his stash. After all, his player had lost the game.
John was just approaching his front door when Sherlock opened it, and, without a word, grabbed John by the shoulder and turned him around, forcing him down their front steps back onto the pavement.
"You know, Sherlock, Victor was your friend. You continue this way, you won't have any friends left."
And all this wasn't even taking into account the fact that John was trying his hardest not to mention The Man.
There were few things that could shock Sherlock Holmes, but he felt his jaw drop as he watched the healer push his way through to his sister. Harry began sobbing and shaking her head, trying to get him to take it back, but he wouldn't, and eventually one of the Peacekeepers grabbed her by the arms while the other led John up the rest of the way to the stage. Harry went into hysterics as she was being pulled away.
"Sure, whatever you say. Just try not to scream when there's a knock at the door. We don't want to scare the kids."
All he said in return was, “Of course.” There was no sense in him shooting the whole thing dead this early in the distancing stage. Even if this was the first of many harbingers, there was still some joy left to be had here, for however long the world allowed him to have it. That should have still brought him a certain amount of sadness. But any days he had left with John Watson were worth it.
“Okay. But you didn't die. You're here again. So now what?” Sherlock always had a plan, always knew what the next step was, accounted for every possible outcome. So what had been on his list on the off chance he survived?
“You said Harry was your sister. The inscription led me to believe Clara was a brother's past romantic attachment.”
John did not realize at first what he had done. He had heard the sound every soldier dreads, the sound of incoming projectiles. There had been gunshots and then the whirring of what he could only assume was a bomb. He had thrown himself to the ground, covering his head and bracing for the explosion, and begging it not to come.
“I'm glad you're not living alone, even if it is just with a friend. I worried about you, when you first came back. That solitude wasn't good for you.”
“Well, I hope it will suffice tomorrow as well. I have to go into work, and I don't want you running all over London alone. So stay in, play your violin, and try not to set anything on fire.” John stood and said, “Oh, by the way, Mrs. Hudson wants to know if you want the upstairs bedroom? Have you slept at all since you got here?”
The empty branches of trees cut at his face as he rushed through the woods, his heart pounding in his ears, only barely overshadowed by the distant booming of cannons, tally marks of the dead.
John scoffed, smiling a little. He stared at the ground for a minute and said quietly, “Fine. What are binary stars, anyway?” John had once told Sherlock that oftentimes, when people asked a question, they were actually asking something else entirely. Sherlock had a feeling this was one of those times.
“Can't reveal all the mysteries, now can I?” As always, such remarks were universally beloved by his over-eager fans. Cleverness was a low bar for most of them.
John let out a somewhat frustrated sigh and shrugged as he crossed the room to take a seat in the second chair. “He sounded...desperate.”
He was so well-practiced that I hardly felt the twinge of the needle through my skin. His eyes took on a languid quality of concentration.
Sherlock heard the split second pause, the author waiting for the next question. And although there were people sheepishly raising their hands, gearing themselves up to speak, he ignored them and stole their moment from them.
Three in the morning, and Sherlock was walking around one of his greenhouses after making rounds to check on John. He continued to be baffled at the lack of illness or injury, but was all the same grateful for it.
“You're never in here this early unless you're on a case. And if it's a case, you're here with John.” Sherlock said nothing, though he tried to speak, and failed. “So you must be avoiding him.” Sherlock gave her a small tilt of his head. “Oh, Sherlock, you –”
Irene turned to John. “Oh, he's just being moody. From what I understand, he's like that even on the best of days.”
John set down his fork, pasta still hanging from it, and sighed. “Did you just look up all the dedications in all my books?”
John had more or less ceased using his own ability, because he didn't need to. He didn't want the world to freeze when he was with Sherlock. Sherlock was a creature of nearly constant motion, and John never wanted that to stop. The longer he lived at Baker Street, the more his panics faded, the more at home he felt. He was still saving people, just in a different way.
Sherlock ran his bare hands over the plants, sighing and feeling incredibly weighted down. So many things that shouldn't be poisonous, but were. Just like him. He wanted to hate the plants for their poison, even though he created them, but every time he tried to muster that rage, the desire to smash every pot in the greenhouse, he was reminded of the fact that they were the only things like him in the world. And he couldn't destroy exceptions to the rule.
All day though, John would ask Sherlock questions here or there, about what he remembered of the night, Sherlock always giving him predetermined answers. Once, after one such remark, John said, “Are you sure? I could have sworn...” Sherlock waited tensely, watching John try to work through the night. Finally, he conceded, and Sherlock was flooded with relief. There was no reason John should go into a marriage with a guilty conscience.
“I don't know. I thought I'd be in a better place by now. And what the fuck am I going to do about Mary?” He rested his forehead on his open palm.
He shut the office door behind him and cast a distasteful glance at his brother, who stood across the room wearing an absolutely atrocious dark blue suit textured to look like snakeskin.
Two faces appeared above him. One was a soldier, trying to talk to him. When he didn't respond, the man yelled for help. The other face was a pale man with dark hair. He wasn't in the familiar army fatigues. Instead he was wearing a black suit, minus the tie. John thought he was hallucinating, that the dessert and the blood loss were playing tricks on him. He shut his eyes for a moment, but when he reopened them, the man was still there. He had a strange look in his eyes. Concern, yes, but also...irritation?
Sholto had gone around turning all the lights on, especially in the living room, which he lit up brightly enough that it felt like daytime despite the encroaching night outside. Before he'd even bothered with that, though, he handed John a glass and a bottle, without question. It had been so long since John had come to see him, back before Rome, and part of him felt guilty for showing up now for such a selfish reason. But Sholto didn't seem to notice. He acted like he'd seen John yesterday.
John looked around the dirty little room, eyes lingering on the cracks running through the window. The wind seeped through them. They would have to be fixed before winter. There was only the faintest hint of sunlight forcing its way through the dirt and grime on the glass. John pushed himself up and reached for his bag. He would have to hurry if he wanted to get past the fences unseen.
Sherlock waited, waited to be struck down. The Capitol would never kill a fan favorite like John. Just as well. That's who Sherlock would have chosen to go home too. Would their death blow come from another hound? No, too tricky, too unpredictable. Might kill John too. Same went for a flash flood in the river. Lightning? Even that was imprecise at best.
John stood there for a moment, hand on the door frame, an unconscious block. He had to force himself to step aside and let her in.
Mary nodded. “Of course. I'll do whatever I can.” She gave him a kiss on his cheek and said, “As long as you promise me that you'll try to win.”
Pause. John felt slightly smug that he was able to leave Sherlock unsure what to say. "Yes, I suppose you're right."
John expected him to begin looking up local papers to see what sort of murders were being investigated, anything of interest, but instead, he just turned it off entirely, something he had never intentionally done in all the time John had known him.
A few minutes later, I felt a hand on my arm. "Sherlock?" Victor had a look on his face that mice usually reserve for cats.
John stayed in bed for a while after he left, lying on his back and staring at the ceiling. A sense of the surreal crept over him, and he smiled to himself, the happy ache still deep in his chest and the comforting fact that Sherlock would come back, not vanish into death, made him nearly sigh in relief.
He hated the cemetery. He hated the birds that still managed to sing despite all the suffering that surrounded them. He hated the people who had told him how sorry they were. He hated the people who had made less than kind remarks about the "freak detective."
“Naturally. The company must be equally tedious, or you wouldn't be talking to me. Aren't people supposed to mingle at these things? Go out for nice dinners and drinks and pretend to be interested in each other's work?”
Sherlock knew John was at Harry's, and he arrived just as the doctor was leaving. He didn't look well. When Harriet Watson's face shows concern, then it's a given that the situation is bad.
John felt fine, but he had absolutely no clue what to do. He'd asked himself the same question multiple times during the night. He couldn't stay here forever. Eventually, there wouldn't be enough tributes in the arena to keep people entertained. Something would ruin the quiet safe haven. He had considered leaving as soon as she woke up, but couldn't.
"One moment, and I'll get some menus for you and your date," he said to John. Sherlock waited for the inevitable rebuttal. But it never came. When he looked at John, he was picking at a loose thread on the tablecloth. He was trying to keep his face blank.
Who in their right mind, when provided a perfect opportunity, uses it to bring up someone being set on fire? Of all time periods, he had to be playing a
I felt my back slammed against the bricks of the alley wall, hands running over me, grabbing my wrists. There were lips tracing my jaw, feverish kisses planted all over my neck and face.
“It won't even take that long. I don't really know how to say this, though. But I feel like I should just go ahead and apologize now.”
After being told who the poet was, John had hated how silent his phone had been. No additional messages or information.
"The music is about me, isn't it?" John had let the words slip out before he could stop them. He had grown steadily more convinced that this was the case, and he decided if it wasn't that he could blame the enormous amount of drugs in his system. He waited for a response, and when it came, the voice was much closer, standing by his bedside.
Speeches like these always allowed one to say things that under any other circumstances would draw attention and be the precursor to a serious conversation. People expected sentimentality at a wedding. They expected heartfelt speeches. No one would think anything of it. Including John, who, as always, remained delightfully oblivious to all that
Sherlock reached up to the top of John's shirt and undid the top button. He pushed the material to one side and John saw his eyes suddenly grow pensive. The detective ran his hand along John's shoulder, right below his collarbone, and then John understood. He looked down and saw the familiar long fingers tracing the remnants of the gunshot wound, like someone reading braille for the first time after going blind.
"Sure, John. Go home, get some rest. We'll talk later. Or rather, you'll talk to whoever they fill my place with." John stood to leave, and as he did, he glanced over Lestrade's desk at the evidence bags.
“You don't have to involve yourself in all this, you know. If it makes things unnecessarily complicated for you.” John looked up from the carpet and saw Sherlock absently fidgeting with a loose string on the curtain.
John slowly rose to his feet, the hound forgotten. Sherlock saw him glance down at his gun, a fleeting glance.
Sherlock expected John to look away, to roll his eyes and go on with his night, but he didn't. It felt like forever before he let his eyes be drawn back to the storm outside their window, but Sherlock was flooded with relief when he wasn't under that gaze anymore. Part of him hoped that John would get up and leave entirely, but he didn't.
“Normally, I wouldn't bother you with this,” he said as he walked Sherlock and John over to the body. “But honest to God, we just don't have the time to devote to it. We're way too busy.”
Sherlock remained frozen in place for the longest time. Finally he walked to his own tombstone, laying his hand where John's had been only minutes ago. And he decided to stop in the coffee shop across the street to gather his thoughts. For one of the few times in his life, Sherlock Holmes had no idea how to proceed.
John could hardly argue with that logic, and since Sherlock was already heading down the stairs, he thought it best to follow.
When I was finishing writing the part in the Pantheon, I was sending Clem messages about how preoccupied I was with the rain still being able to come in through the oculus, and naturally she understood this preoccupation and had a perfect response about how she saw these children dancing in the rain inside the Pantheon. Clem is too much, but I'm glad she's in some of the same preoccupation hells as me.
"Yeah well, if you need it back so badly, you can take it up with your brother, because I'm certainly not going to help you retrieve Irene Adler's phone. Not after what he's been through because of her." Mycroft made a face, not pleased by the prospect of fighting through the issue with Sherlock.
The kiss was never supposed to happen. There had been so many long glances, so many times eyes had flitted to mouths and hands. There had been the steadily lessening space between them. There had been more than one instance of breath catching, but still, it wasn't supposed to have happened. But it had, and so easily.
He locked eyes with me again, a slight furrow across his brow, as if he were deliberating something with himself. No doubt it had something to do with one of my injuries. He reached a hand up toward my face. I expected it to land across the bandaged cut, but instead it snaked its way around and cupped the back of my neck, gently pulling me closer to him.
Standing in the lab at Bart's, Sherlock flipped through a very thick forensics file while John sat at another bench, watching him, wondering what the hell was going through his head this time. John had attempted to talk to him more once they reached the hospital, but Sherlock wouldn't be distracted, not even by John.
John sat down on the sofa and knocked back a whiskey in one gulp, and poured another. Eventually, Sholto sat down in the chair opposite him, not speaking, just watching him carefully like he was a human trip wire.
. What all have you done in the Games? Because I bet it can't hold a candle to the things I've done. So calculated, so well-executed, if you'll pardon my word choice. What would you say the highlight will be? I'm going to say it was that girl. That little thing I gutted. They'll be talking about that for a long time, I think.”
“You don't have to. It's not a secret, John. You were never good at keeping secrets, it's just not in your nature. You wear everything you're thinking on your face. I knew the why as soon as I walked into Baker Street the other day.”
seem tonally different from all your other work? Why was it published during the off season with little publicity and marketing? Why does it seem to me that that is the only book you're thinking about while you answer questions about your newest release? Why was there such a massive time gap on either side of that particular novel?”
John pulled his phone out of his pocket, staring at it in his hand for a minute before typing out a message to one of his friends, an excuse about not feeling well. He hit “send.”
John sat quietly on the train, staring out the window without really seeing anything. The fact that he had no car of his own to drive had been one of his favorite excuses for not seeing his family more regularly, but this time it was unavoidable. He may have a loving but strained relationship with his mother, ambivalence toward his father, and a sense of exhausted pity for his sister, but they needed help.
“He's been traumatized, Sherlock. We don't want to risk pushing him over the edge by making him think he's hallucinating again.”
“As teams scour the Hickman site in desperate attempts to recover some of the paintings, the crown jewel of the gallery, a newly discovered Vermeer, remains missing, presumed destroyed.”
He was about halfway through his drink, the world already dark outside the windows, when he heard the familiar footsteps on the stairs, and he cursed to himself that his peace was so soon shattered.
John kept to himself, working with the spears, when he heard voices nearby. He paused, spear still in hand, and slowly he made his way around the corner, and saw the man from District 1 towering over the girl from District 8. He had her backed up against the wall, and she was trying to hold her own, but every time she attempted to get away from him, he would push her back, just gently enough to not draw attention.
He felt anger begin to bubble back to the surface. “Excuse me?” They continued to carry on as if he wasn't there.
The front cover of the book was a portrait of a girl's face, maybe thirteen, with her features partially obscured by the artistic equivalent of a camera blur.
He jumped up, whirling around at the sound of the voice. He stared at the rock face of the cliff, his brow furrowing in confusion. Residual hallucinations? No, the drug should have been long gone from his system. Was this it, then? Had the arena simply broken him?
She smiled. “He was a bit of a flirt, to tell you the truth. He would talk about buying me jewelry if he ever had that kind of income. And sometimes when he would talk like that he would say things like, 'Since I might not ever have that kind of money, I should just give you this.' ” She picked the ring up, turning it around in her hand. “It became a sort of joke with us, about this ring. It was the only article of jewelry he owned as far as I know. I'll check and see if his family wants it.”
Her face, usually a mix of playfulness and scheming, was suddenly very dark and sad. But it only lasted a second, and just as quickly, she glanced at Mycroft as she rose from her seat. She said to him, putting on a hollow version of her usual closed-lip smile, “What do you think we should all wear when we get back to the district, Mr. Holmes? I'm leaning toward my battle dress.” She turned and winked at John and Sherlock before walking out of the room.
, Sarah?” a voice asked. John glanced to the side, seeing a baffled looking man standing next to a pretty woman, her brown hair pulled up into a ponytail. John had seen the look on the man's face before, someone who didn't understand the appeal of art, and likely never would. But he couldn't crush the woman's enthusiasm. She smiled more fondly at the painting than she probably ever did at the man.
John laughed, and Sherlock glanced at him for a second, surprised by the reaction. “So you're going to London for uni? That's what Mike said.”
“So, what? You think threatening me will force me into some emotional baring of the heart? I regret to inform you that it will not.”
“Sherlock. What the hell is going on?” He forced himself to speak calmly, tried not to devolve into shouting.
John disregarded the various messages he had gotten from Ella while he was out with Sherlock. He was sure she'd be livid whenever he finally reconnected, but periodically, there had to be evenings that weren't consumed with work, with deadlines and tour schedules, and offers from movie producers who would beg for film rights and then butcher the adaptation entirely. There were some nights where he just needed to be a regular person again, like he was before he ever set pen to paper.
Suddenly the prospect of beating Moriarty was not nearly so enticing. It would rattle their still world, and potentially put them both in danger again. Sherlock's smile faded to a frown as soon as John turned away, standing and going to the kitchen to make tea. Sherlock dreaded the shattering of the calm created by this steady little army doctor, and then, finally, he understood.
“And you couldn't even begin to solve all of the issues within your own family, no matter how vocal you had been. Things that are destined to fall apart will, whether you intervene or not.”
Suddenly Sherlock was filled with a panic. He had not foreseen this defeated confession. And now he was struck with a rare insecurity and doubt. Maybe Mycroft was right. Maybe tonight was a bad choice.
One such day, he came home to find Sherlock standing in their living room staring at the wall above the gray sofa. John followed his line of sight as Sherlock said, “It is rather nice looking, isn't it?”
“Precisely. So you can quite easily turn around and walk out it.” He gave a wave of his hand. She remained seated, unimpressed.
John paused, waiting to see if he would say more, but he didn't. “So Rome was what? In case you died or never saw me again or something?” Sherlock only shrugged, a familiar gesture that translated most closely to
Sherlock's face simultaneously wore both fear and elation, and had he been anyone else there would have been tears in his eyes. John was suddenly aware of how Sherlock's life had really just been one long lonely night after the next; no wonder he had no idea what to make of happy endings like the stories promised to every child except him. Sherlock kept glancing at John's lips, awestruck that anyone would do something like cross a room to kiss him and knowing that those lips were on his and could be for years to come. Unprecedented, all of this. It was no wonder that so many people went around going on and on about love and happy endings and all the things that Sherlock always disdainfully called cliches.
John and Sherlock shifted, standing back to back, rotating as they heard the growls, the vicious snaps of unseen teeth. John held the gun out, aiming at nothing. It never stayed in view long enough to get a lock on it, always vanishing from sight.
Sherlock only said, “There was no sense in telling you till it became an actual issue. It would have only had you walking around upset. You know that.”
Sometime – the minutes all blurred together – Sherlock reached for John's hand, holding it between the two of them, flattening out their fingers so their hands were palm to palm. He kept them like that for a while, John never once moving, and finally he slid their fingers together, running his thumb along John's hand.
The cab finally came to a stop near a car park, cordoned off with tape. There were multiple police cars and what looked like hoards of law enforcement and forensics officials wandering around. Everything seemed to be a shade of gray, the sky fading into the asphalt, even the police officers' clothes bled into the puddles of standing water. The only spot of true color came from the bright blue shirt of the dead man lying in the middle of the car park. John watched as Sherlock got out of the cab, his coat becoming another point of gray in the monochrome sea. This time he didn't wait to see if John followed; he knew damn well he would.
.” Sherlock pushed himself away from the wall, taking one or two steps and grabbing the edge of the bannister. He sat down on the stairs, leaning against the railing beside him, eyes closed.
“Solving crimes. And currently my brother is inside trying to talk me into assisting him with some foreign affair.”
"There are few intelligent people in the world. It would be a disservice to let one of them get killed."
Sherlock sat in his chair, reading and mostly ignoring the other guests. There weren't too many, of course. Molly, Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, Mike. Sherlock couldn't help but notice the lack of John's most recent girlfriend. Another woman, left in John Watson's wake.
Sherlock's hand shifted from John's shoulder to the back of his neck, John's expression shifting to confusion for one second before Sherlock kissed him.
John woke up to the deafening blare of the television. He jumped out of bed, running into the living room. Sherlock stood holding the remote, his head cocked to the side as he watched the action movie that dominated the screen. John reached out and grabbed the remote out of his hands and shut the television off.
He had been unable to make himself move from the sofa, the remote still sitting on it next to him. Every tiny sound was amplified, every minor irritation a thousand times more glaring.
“Then there isn't really any sense in me telling them, is there? If I told them, all that would do is make them take up your time, and since you work with me, that would be most inconvenient in the grand scheme of things. Imagine, you always getting called away for questioning and picking people out of lineups when we're trying to work.”
With a roll of his eyes, he pulled into the restaurant's lot and parked, following John sullenly inside, hands in his pockets. It was a quiet little place, the kind that had homey menus and old music piped in over the speakers. There was a dinner crowd, a whole slew of what looked like terribly ordinary people.
The sadness he'd been able to handle – mostly. But he'd had no idea how to deal with the anger that had slowly risen in him more and more with every passing week, the cold rage that made him want to scream at the world. He wanted to hit someone, anyone would do, even a stranger who just pushed past him on the street. There had to be
Sherlock gave a small nod, the pensive veil lifting from his face, a smile creeping into his expression for the first time that day, like a sunrise.
“Of course most of the Careers are dead, so the competition is blessedly –” John had stopped in his place and was staring at something on the ground. “John?”
John couldn't believe the line. It was risky, reminding everyone there about what they would all be doing in a few days. But it also made John look good to the people, more so than it did Sherlock. Which begged the question of why someone so self-serving would say anything that might benefit someone who was technically his opponent.
Sherlock thought it was irrational, and yet, he was doing it anyway. It was a few days later, and he had spent many hours loitering around the Tesco, on the off chance that he would run into the same man again. He just couldn't shake the feeling that something about him was important. That was irrational, too. After all, the man was not very tall or striking, walked with a cane, and wore the blandest clothing. And yet...
Sherlock jerked his head around, glaring. But he saw John looking at his shaking hands, and scoffed. “Body's betraying me.”
what to do with you.” She gave him a pursed-lip smile and, electronics still in hand, said, “Let's get started.”
John finally let go of Sherlock's hand, staring off into the woods. No flocks of birds, no sound from the forest at all.
"Despite the fact that a part of me really wants to punch you in the face again, there isn't anyone else I've wanted to see so badly in years." Sherlock could hear a tiny trace of John's usual self in his voice. He allowed himself a small smile.
. It was a weak answer, and he knew it, but his times of greatest anxiety had been when he wasn't near the painting, like that first night when he'd gone to the pharmacy, or the fleeting seconds in the hallway picking up the newspaper. The more distance between himself and the Vermeer, the worse the entire situation made him feel.
When Sherlock broke back into the hollow, it was chaos. The tributes stood raving, the two men at each other, the woman at nothing. She was on her knees, her hands clapped over her ears. They were surrounded by morning fog.
John wrapped the last of the lights around the top of the tree. "You really are the paragon of holiday cheer. You have a case?"
“What about Rome?” Sherlock repeated. John only nodded. Sherlock cut his eyes away, tracing a finger along the arm rest of his chair. “While I was relatively certain that I wouldn't end up actually dying while closing Moriarty's network, I wasn't one hundred percent sure. That kind of certainty is never smart, and I'm not one for absolutes.”
Sherlock came to an old house, one long since abandoned. It had belonged to a tribute's family, and when their child had not returned, neither parent had been able to cope. The memories in the house had only made them hurt worse. Sherlock had only been a child when it happened, his mother skirting around the word “hanged” like it was poison on her lips. All the children regarded the house with a sort of morbid fascination, which grew into a reverent respect as they aged. The house had never been filled with another family. Instead, it was allowed to fall to ruin. Sherlock had come to it before, even though everyone else steered clear of it. Even the neighbors would have nothing to do with it, letting the wood rot and the grass grow too tall.
John's ears perked up. The tone of the music was all he'd been able to think about. "Well, it's structured in four parts. I could hear the differences."
“Of course.” She grinned before she turned and walked away. She stopped at her own door and turned back to John. “For what it's worth, I rather like him.”
Looking down into it he could see the fountain, the soft bubbling of the running water audible even on their balcony, and the scattered wrought iron tables and chairs. There were only a few people taking advantage, sitting around talking softly to each other, one group whispering over a carafe of red wine, everyone seeming to respect the hushed nature of the location. The interior nature of the courtyard blocked most of the noise from the city; only occasionally would a lone car horn or shouting tourist be loud enough for anyone to hear. The exterior balcony would surely be louder, but this one turned the city from a roar to a whisper, and the sense of being lost in the silence of a place surrounded by life and vivacity was oddly soothing.
The tone in his voice set off all the warning alarms in Sherlock's head. But all he said was, “Fine. If you insist.”
The train ride cooled him down some, at least, enough for him to put his head in his hands and feel pathetic for even getting on the train in the first place. But he couldn't go back to Mary, and he couldn't bear the silence of the empty flat tonight. The train ride had been an impulse, one he was sure to pay for later, but he had no idea where else he could go where no one would ask him prying questions or tell him how sorry they were.
Now and then there would be a noise, rustling in the leaves or a twig breaking, and it would set them off a bit, even though it always turned out to be something innocuous.
“It's trying, isn't it? Every year when they bring you all in, it makes my heart ache seeing how tired and scared some of you are.” John was surprised. He had never heard a Capitol resident talk that way before. “But we do what we can to make it a little easier.”
“Well, they arrested her. That's all I know right now. Maybe I'll luck out and someone will kill her.”
The search for information about John Watson had been equally futile. He had hoped that the internet would be able to provide more information than the blurb on the dust jacket had, but details about the author were notably sparse no matter where he looked. No details about his early days except the same note of him being from Somerset. There was a fair bit about his military service, but nothing about his family or personal life. Yet somehow, this man had cultivated his public image in such a way that his fans viewed him as family and felt like they knew him. He had an easy charm in his interviews that made him seem so personable, but Sherlock noticed that mostly his answers seemed designed to keep everyone safely at arm's length. Certain topics he avoided more than others. Any questions about his youth were immediately and skillfully redirected into another avenue of discussion, so expertly that the interviewers didn't seem to realize they'd been played. Questions about the military he answered, unless they were questions about the actual people he served with. Unlike most military men he seemed reluctant to talk about other soldiers he knew, giving no sentimental tales of brothers in arms and rescues and miracles. But he talked very casually about some of the terrible things he saw, as if the deaths and bombings didn't seem nearly as emotionally demanding as simple questions about his favorite movie or whether he was married or whether he came from a large family or – god forbid – questions about why he chose the subject matter he chose.
And then the texts came, one after another on Sherlock's phone, all signed with JM. Names. Names of every last person in the building. Names of their children. Names of all the priceless pieces collected under the museum's roof. And the riddles, the taunts, they had sent Sherlock into a frenzy. The threats he didn't mind, but the riddles drove him mad, especially when punctuated by the numerical countdown texts, the occasional message of, “Tick tock, Mr. Holmes.”
The man was still alive, but only barely, his skin clammy and his hands shaking, his eyes wide and wild and terrified. The look was familiar. The man knew damn well how this was going to end. He reached out a hand, grabbing John by the arm, panicked and insistent, leaving a bloody hand print on the dark cloth of John's jacket. But he did this to get John's attention, not John's comfort, and once John looked down at him he drew his hand away. Both of his hands held out in front of him, the man shakily twisted a ring off one of his fingers, pushing it toward John, the blood-smeared gold giving off the faintest glint in the dim light.
One night, John almost went back to the church, perhaps wanting to somehow recreate that moment of peace and silence they had achieved just a few nights before. But he lost his nerve. Sherlock would see through something like that.
The atmosphere grew steadily more awkward, and was blessedly broken by Molly's return. She had her mobile phone in her hand, which she held out toward the both of them.
While he sat on the edge of his bed, wondering how much longer he could stay in his room before John noticed how long he'd been gone, he replayed the afternoon over and over in his head. The way John had said the word
The New Year's Eve party was at a rather fancy hotel along the river. Everyone was there. Most of the Yard, most of the people from Bart's, even a few journalists that they were all on relatively good terms with.
John and Mary met up on the way to the Reaping later that day. Harry trailed behind them, hands trembling from nerves and withdrawal. She had that spacey look in her eyes that told John she wasn't truly all there.
“What did you want me to do, Mary? I wasn't going to send in a sad alcoholic like Harry. I stand a better chance than she does.”
Sherlock spared one glance to John before standing from the bench and taking the phone from Molly, his face flooded with relief. He paced around the room, asking a question here or there, occasionally with a tense clench of his jaw. The look was familiar, that moment where his brain took over, kicking everything else, all the petty things that most people found so important, out of his head until further notice. John would have been lying if he said he wasn't grateful for the intrusion, especially with the worried looks Molly kept giving them.
He rounded some rocks, his hand grabbing them for balance, and then jerking away when he saw his hand covered in blood. He spun around, trying to figure out where to go, when he saw the body.
The days were short, and it seemed John only blinked and it was late in the afternoon. Had he fallen asleep? He felt hungover and miserable, and his arm still protested at the slightest provocation.
John turned to see Sherlock standing beside him, hands clasped behind his back, staring off at the street.
“So you didn't say anything to me for days because Sherlock Holmes is alive. Why did you wait to tell me that your best friend was back from the dead? Didn't you think that was information worth sharing?”
One of them was particularly vitriolic. So John stopped the world and twisted his arm behind his back, not enough to dislocate his shoulder, but enough so that when he started the world again, the man cringed at the sudden and unexplained pain.
John was nearly deafened by the cheers. The stadium was filled to the brim with Capitol citizens, all hollering and screaming as the tributes made their way through. John could see the tributes from District 8 a few chariots ahead of them. As they emerged into the stadium, they both waved to all the Capitol citizens, and the man wrapped his arm around the woman protectively like an older brother would. They would no doubt be fan favorites.
“No, I mean you are out of hers. At best she'll be a teacher to a hoard of annoying six year olds, with a plain, boring little flat somewhere. You have more potential. So why are you wasting your time with her?”
"People go on and on about first sights.  The reality is that it's the second meeting, the third, the fourth, whichever one turns lamplight into starlight, that actually matters."
John and Sherlock stood backstage with Irene, Mycroft, and the stylists. Irene gazed longingly at a passing tray of drinks. She had finally forced herself to get dressed in real clothes and was wearing an oddly textured black dress and heels so sharp that John thought they could be used as weapons in the arena. She had on the deepest shade of red lipstick he'd ever seen and had her hair piled high up on her head. She looked like she was going to be the one paraded in front of thousands.
“Seriously?” Donovan looked between Sherlock and Lestrade. “You don't know what we've been working on?”
.” He wasn't speaking authoritatively anymore. He was all desperation and quiet words, no longer wild, but begging.
had done, until it happened time after time, always at his bidding. And while many young men would have panicked, Sherlock instead instantly recognized the potential of such an ability. He seized every opportunity. At first he took joy in some simple pleasures, mostly involving causing minor and humorous injuries to Mycroft. Occasionally he would only read for hours on end. Then he realized he could do whatever he wanted. There were no rules anymore.
But abruptly, Sherlock jerked away, realizing what he had done. John had never seen eyes so filled with fear, and for a moment, Sherlock seemed incapable of even the slightest movement, frozen like someone who had stumbled across a vicious predator.
But no number of pieces would erase the image from his brain, and no number of nights would wipe The Man from his dreams.
“You're very lucky,” a voice said. “The neighbors saw you go in, so they went looking for you when they heard the house collapse.”
John smiled a little. He heard Sherlock's footsteps stop in an annoyed huff for a minute before resuming, ignoring Molly's request at stillness. Whether Sherlock would admit it or not, he was just as concerned as John was. Concern would be the only thing that would make him show his trust in Molly Hooper.
“Admittedly, I will likely be bored as well. I've grown rather fond of your technology,” he said, finally looking up from his puzzle. But if his face was any indication, John was just as much of a puzzle as the Rubik's cub had been.
Lestrade looked at the phone. As far as the records were concerned, this phone didn't exist as evidence. And Lestrade decided he was already in trouble anyway. How much more damage to his career could he cause at this point? He picked up the phone, turning it over in his hands for a minute like it held the answer to why Sherlock had done it. But the screen stayed black and gave him no closure. He held it out to John, who took it and put it in the evidence bag, tucking it away inside his coat.
"You asked me to be nice," he said matter-of-factly. Sherlock paused, picked up his bow. "And although it's unfortunate that the dull nurse won't be able to join you, I'm sure you'll find someone to go with."
John stared blankly at him for a moment before turning the television on, quickly muting it. He began clicking through the different channels. Sherlock watched in amazement. Finally, John stopped on a documentary about bees. He turned the volume on low. “Look, see?” He drew Sherlock's attention to the buttons on the remote. “This lets you go between channels, and
“Nothing, nothing.” Sherlock followed him into Baker Street, stepping out of the way so John could lock the door. He leaned against the wall at the bottom of the stairs, looking like he was barely able to remain standing. John held out his keys, and Sherlock stared at them in confusion for a second before holding out his hand, palm-up. John almost let them drop into his open palm, but instead placed them there carefully, and folded Sherlock's fingers back over them.
rise in his head, but John silenced it with a kiss, gentle and easy, his hand holding onto Sherlock's arm. “I am perfectly content being your companion star.”
“I heard you.” He continued to stare straight ahead, but never did speak again. John didn't much appreciate being ignored so blatantly, but he wasn't going to keep making an effort if Sherlock was going to be like that. John looked away from him, feeling himself settling into a bad mood as they called Sherlock's name. He left without even glancing at John, completely caught up in his own head.
don't. People can't be friends, really. Human beings are naturally self-serving, and that is not conducive to friendship. Eventually, everyone turns on each other. You may have business associates or acquaintances, but
“John, you idiot, you are going to get yourself killed.” She stood a few feet in front of him, arms crossed.
“You do. Everyone knows. Even Mary Morstan knows it isn't an act, so I wish the two of you would just quit pretending that it is. Especially you.”
“You know.” He gave a little wave of his hand. “He's one of those people who thinks emotions are a waste of time. So I don't think he feels things that way.” He tried to shrug, to brush it all off, and from the look on Sholto's face, he knew he had failed miserably. John waited, expecting a joke or a quick retort, an old-fashioned army jab, but Sholto just watched him quietly, slowly nodding his head. He wasn't even looking at John when he finally decided to speak.
When John shut his sister's bedroom door behind him, he saw her sitting on the floor by her bed, her liquid courage beside her. She was trembling, her arms wrapped around her knees, and after all the years of verbal outbursts and her mouth getting her in trouble, it seemed that speech had been taken from her entirely. She blinked back tears, not very successfully, and wiped them away with the back of her hand. No matter what John said to her, she wouldn't speak, and eventually he had to settle for sitting next to her with his arm around her, letting her rest her head on his shoulder, in perfect silence for hours.
Behind him, he saw Kitty gaining speed, planning to jump the water too, and he pushed himself a few feet back away from the water's edge, trying to force himself again and again to stand, but tripping over cracks and stones in his rush.
JW: Yes and no. There's a certain catharsis, in fictionalizing things. I think it's one of the ways human beings cope with all the horrible things we have to see and hear. But the real world gets exhausting, even when it's your version of it. I needed a break from all that. It was time to get back to my roots, I suppose.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow at him. “Really, though John. Suicide over sentiment. How very human of you.”
But the first week or so he was back, he enjoyed it. He had seen so many terrible things in Afghanistan, things that would be burned on his memory forever. So he would stop his world when he felt the panic rise in him, and would go walk through Hyde Park, or along the Thames, and remind himself that there was goodness and beauty in this world. He felt like he had to keep reminding himself of this one fact. Not everything was blood and death. There were children playing in the park with their parents. There were gardens and beautiful homes. There was an entire world of art and music. And there was more goodness than evil.
“I had to consider its properties, its color, shape, had to think seriously about including something about the immunity in the name, but of course that would be hard to explain to anyone else. Even thought about being simplistic, naming it after its place of origin, or something along those lines. In the end I decided to name it something else entirely, having really nothing to do with the bloom itself.” He fell silent, and John was about to ask again, to try and draw words out of him, when he said, “
John's hand slid down to his wrist. “What the hell are you doing?” He grinned, amused. Sherlock's face was just slightly flushed from all the drinks, and so close to John's that he thought he could feel the heat radiate off him.
Sherlock, of course, was just irritated with them. He remained upstairs, sulking on the sofa, reading through his stack of scientific journals. Every few minutes, his concentration would be broken by that infernal pounding on the door.
Perhaps pointedly, Mary never mentioned Sherlock. Surely she knew, since Sherlock had become such a public figure near the end of his life, since she was an avid reader of the news and had likely seen all the stories about the end in Rome. But she never spoke up, never asked John all those questions that any girlfriend would want to ask. For a while, he was grateful, but when Mary finally broke her silence and asked about it one night, John hated her months of silence, feeling like they'd only been a steady buildup to what devolved into a cold and distant conversation.
John listened to the cheers erupt from the spectators, smiling and waving at them. The stylists had put together an amazing display. Even Sherlock seemed mildly impressed. John locked eyes with the man, who had been staring at the trail of glowing fire following John. And underneath the awe, John could see the smallest hint of fear. It felt so much more final now that they were here in front of the world. John watched as Sherlock corrected himself, faced forward, and wiped all trace of expression from his face.
John was silent, but his clenched jaw slowly relaxed. He took a deep breath, his voice calmer when he spoke.
He spun around, trying to find the person who he had, in a way, silently communicated with since he was in Afghanistan. And finally he saw a figure near the trees, an unmistakable silhouette in a dark coat.
, someone who existed only to give the reader some sort of emotional closure. Mycroft said dedications humanized writers, made them feel more accessible to the public. But Sherlock had never liked that philosophy. And he had never liked being accessible. “They tend to lack sincerity or exist only for factual purposes. For instance, Ella getting a dedication since she was the reason the book was published in the first place. You can quantify her worth. Or the people who dedicate things to their parents out of some sense of familial obligation.”
"I lost my best friend," John snapped. He knew Lestrade was sad, having lost Sherlock and his job, but he couldn't make himself be sympathetic. John sighed and rubbed his eyes, taking a deep breath to calm himself. He looked back up at Lestrade, who was watching him intently, brow knit with concern.
He instantly recognized the phone, and when he laid eyes on it, it was as if the floor went out from under him. He put a hand on the edge of the desk to keep the room from spinning. When he looked up, Lestrade was staring at him, a terrified look on his face. He'd forgotten he'd had the phone, and he hadn't even considered the effect something like it would have on John.
“You say that as if it's unexpected.” Before John could speak, he added, “Though I suppose in all fairness, it probably is. But then again, so is immunity to poison.”
“London. You'll be there a while. We've assigned you to one person permanently. So you will be with him until he dies.” Sherlock groaned. “You will show yourself as human.”
One day soon after arriving, John called for a cab to take him back home from across town – no way he could walk that far with the ache in his leg – and the driver, a large jovial man, insisted on giving him a ride around the city, free of charge. New residents were so rare that the locals had been discussing John's arrival since they first laid eyes on him, the man told him. John smiled, accepting the impromptu tour, but was too distracted to listen to much of what the man was saying. He sat back in his seat, staring out at the scenery and trying to relax.
John gave a frustrated sigh. “Sherlock, soon we're going to be paraded around the entire country. If you can't manage to leave the house how are you going to manage that?”
"Why do you find it so hard, I wonder? To say what you're thinking. You like to dance around things." She crossed her legs and her eyes bore into me. "What did you tell your doctor, when you left? I doubt you casually said you were going to Karachi."
John was staring down at the tabletop, fiddling aimlessly with the silverware, when Sherlock said, “Why the dull education major?”
, which led to me meeting my agent, which led to years and years of sending out books. Most of them lost their heart, though.”
It was adrenaline. That was all. Just adrenaline and timing. Or, that's what John told himself. But when Sherlock looked back at him, trying to slow his breathing back to normal, he found that excuse harder and harder to believe.
“I really wouldn't.” Moriarty jerked his head toward John. “It's poetic justice, don't you think? Involving him in all this dramatic lost art business?”
He left his room, pacing around their floor, rubbing his hands over his eyes. When he walked into the living room, he stopped, staring at the figure in the window. Sherlock was sitting in the window seat, his back leaning against the wall and his arms resting on his knees. He was silhouetted by the lights of the Capitol, which he stared at with a blank indifference.
Nothing killed him more than standing there, watching them at the altar, and no words stung more than, “I now pronounce you husband and wife.”
John stopped walking, forcing Sherlock to stop as well. You would have thought Sherlock had just told him someone had died. “You asked what I was humming.” Sherlock watched as the memories crept back from their alcohol-induced amnesiac prison.
John was a healer, but there were limits to those skills. He couldn't heal Sherlock, and he couldn't heal himself. Things would never be all right, not really. These nights wouldn't last forever. Eventually, they would have to be public figures again, over and over for the rest of their lives. But at least they wouldn't have to face it all alone.
John didn't know what he expected his first encounter with the bystander to be like, but it wasn't this. The man was no bystander, was nothing close to an ordinary, average human. He was waiting for John and Henry when they'd come inside, dressed in an expensive suit and sporting a Kubrickian smile.
It was wonderful having John in Baker Street. Sherlock always had someone to go with him to crime scenes, someone to handle the day to day things that he found so tedious, someone to laugh with, someone who called him "extraordinary" and "fantastic," but also someone who didn't fear criticizing him. All those years, people had told him that no one would ever want to spend time with someone as blunt and difficult as him, but here was living proof to the contrary.
Closer, closer. “John...” His face was less than a foot from his. The eyes were still all wrong. Not John. The face flickered in and out, distorting as it did.
“Then why are you concerned with what she'll think?” John just shook his head. Sholto clapped him on the shoulder. “Go home, Watson. Keep in mind: if things can work out for someone like me, then certainly things will work out for you.”
John turned to Mike, dumbfounded for reasons he couldn't share with his friend. And all Mike could offer him in the way of explanation was, “Yeah. He's always like that.”
Sherlock stared at his outstretched hand, grabbing it with his own, holding it up in the weak light. As he reached for his other hand, doing the same, he said, “The weapons you have, there's too many to just be from the tributes you've killed, and I highly doubt you risked running into the cornucopia, so where did they come from?”
"John felt like he could see the entire world from this hotel room, and really, between Rome and Sherlock Holmes, how much more of the world could one really need?"
He was just raising his hand to lift the door knocker when the door swung open. John took a startled step back and glanced up at the tall, wiry looking man in front of him. He'd clearly been on his way out, his coat on and an umbrella hooked over his arm. He looked down at John with an amused quirk of his mouth.
"I never act without thinking." John knew that was true, but he was still surprised when he felt a pair of lips against his own. John mentally cursed the heart monitor. There was no way to hide the increase in his pulse.
“It's bad for you.” The only thing that had made him look more horrified than the illegality of cocaine had been when he'd stumbled across a children's television show earlier that day.
John filed away a bit of information: Sherlock Holmes is a sentimental drunk. And yet, it didn't entirely ring true. Sherlock may have been drinking, but his eyes had become clear, and his face looked as it always did. He likely wasn't completely drunk. But the softly spoken words only made John put up his mental defenses. He cursed himself for being just as emotionally useless as his sister.
John seemed relieved. Did he have faint memories of the night before that he had just explained away as a dream in his head? Sherlock hoped so. It was for the best in the long run.
And why couldn't John leave it behind, or return it, or at the very least allow it to rest for the night instead of letting it keep him awake?
Sholto tilted his head back just a few inches, but those few inches spoke volumes. “Oh, all right, that makes sense.”
As Sherlock left the planetarium, stepping out into the high contrast hell of the London night, he turned his head to the sky. In between the city lights, he could see one or two stubborn stars fighting their way through.
That night, John made an offhanded remark to Sherlock about how he had been nearly sociable all evening.
So Sherlock waited out the few days working in the lab at Bart's. He had his orders. There was a certain restaurant he was supposed to be at that Friday to try and befriend his charge. But until then he was content to work in peace.
John froze the world without another thought. It had been so long since he felt true panic, but now his vision was practically clouded by it. He stared at the man, his predatory smile unwavering in the stillness, like a figure in a wax museum.
She smiled. “The great Sherlock Holmes. Where's your pet? You two are very close, aren't you? Platonic?” She laughed. “How did you two get separated? Lose your way?” She made a face, a false expression of pity. “You know Jim? The man from my district? He's a big fan of you, too. You and your pet. He wanted you all to himself, Jim. He was hoping he'd...stumble across you in the arena.” She dragged the tip of the spear across his cheek. “Too bad. But at least if I see him again, I'll have one hell of a story for him. And if I get back to District 1, it will be the story of a
After what felt like an eternity, John reached into his pockets, fishing around for a scrap of paper and a pen, the two things a writer was never without. He scribbled something down and tucked the pen behind his ear as he closed the distance of the few feet between them. Seemingly without nervousness, John reached out for Sherlock's hand and put the piece of paper in it with no additional explanation, folding his fingers over it. Sherlock opened it and saw a line of numerical text. A phone number.
“This is the first time I've ever been in your place, and you seem really reluctant to show me any of it.”
“Yes.” He frowned at a single bloom that had had the nerve to die in the cool English weather. He reached out to inspect another section, but winced and jerked his hand back.
Their suite was upstairs, an elegant and lavish place with an enormous sitting room. Everything looked breakable, and it made John almost nostalgic for the simplicity and domesticity of Baker Street. But the suite was beautiful, and the view from their windows and balcony just as enchanting as every other facet of the city had been.
After the fact he would feel a little guilty for getting so much blood on the passenger's seat of Lestrade's car, but at the moment he wanted to paint the entire world in blood, a shouting proclamation of rage. Lestrade followed the distant lights of the ambulance far ahead of them, his own siren blaring. Over the high-pitched scream, Lestrade still attempted to talk, and said, “It's going to be okay, John.”
“Just because I'm a recluse doesn't mean I've lost my ability to read between the lines. I could always read you like a book, John.” The rare and casual use of his first name, something that Sholto only did when making it clear how serious he was about something, made John painfully aware of just how obvious it must seem to everyone. Except perhaps Sherlock.
her anything, without having to deal with that seemingly inevitable confrontation, without having to deal with her reaction. He wasn't sure what that reaction would even be. All he knew was that he wanted to avoid it. There was no need to answer questions, no need to get into a long conversation that had no chance of changing his mind, no need to deal with whatever cheap shots she might come up with as they fought.
“There's always that one District that thinks they're god's gift to the universe.” Sherlock looked down and saw John standing beside him. He smirked a bit before he could stop himself.
To their right was a table of twenty-somethings, likely university kids who already considered themselves literary scholars. Sherlock caught the sudden furrow to John's brow, irritated by the unwitting interruption. They listened in on the conversation as the students threw lines back and forth at each other out of what was presumably some sort of intellectual masochism. Drawn to painful poetry. Sherlock couldn't blame them. That sort of poetry had the ability to sublimate the human heart's darkest corners and wrap it up in a handful of lines. Even if you weren't a soldier, a victim of a crime, you had surely been affected by love, one way or another, whether you wanted to be or not. The universal language of people in pain.
John stared at him, wide eyed and terrified. There was someone standing there who looked like Sherlock, but that was impossible, wasn't it? This person's skin seemed to glow, and he had wings. John thought surely he was hallucinating, finally. Maybe the vision of The Man in Afghanistan had been a subconscious thing, like he'd seen Sherlock in passing once and projected the image of him as an angel in response to his imminent death. Maybe this was why he saw him now. But when he looked down, the gun was indeed gone from his hand.
The driver met his eyes in the mirror. “That place? That's the Holmes estate. Been there for well over a hundred years.”
Every night carried with it a sort of soft, bleary quality, the two of them so tired from the whole saga that they were more than content to just sleep curled close to one another, setting no alarms and taking no cases. The public asked when they would resume their work, but no one was pushy about it, everyone being polite enough to keep their distance. Now and then a well-wisher would leave flowers outside the building, and there was a nearly constant stream of cards and letters in their mail, but no one actively tried to draw them out, for which John was grateful.
“Perhaps. I would be more inclined to say that poets understand the stars far more than artists. Artists are only recording what they see, but poets are recording the
Things began to blur. John began losing any sense of time or place. Instead everything was one long single moment, all smashed together by a human memory that couldn't keep up. In a way, it felt unreal, like such a thing could never happen to them. But John remembered that it was unreal that he had ever even met Sherlock Holmes in the first place.
John listened to the mumbling from across the room. John wondered if he was slipping into one of his sullen moods, the relative mental inactivity finally getting to him. John knew that cold cases would only keep him occupied for so long. And he realized he wasn't really sure what to ask Sherlock, at least, not anything he would answer.
“You're smart and attractive, and you still manage to draw in people like the boring education major. Attributes are no guarantee of a suitable partner.”
It was hours since he'd stopped caring where he was. It was all the arena, so what did it really matter? He's just walked and walked. He'd tried to sleep a little the night before, which failed miserably. So as soon as there was enough light to safely move through the woods, he'd started walking again.
Sherlock's eyes were a little glassy. He'd drunk too much too quickly, and John wondered if he'd ever really drunk at all. “This and that. Mostly it was a good way to put my skills to use without getting in trouble for doing so. It's easy to be angry with a bratty child, but much less so when the child exposes theft or infidelity or even murder.”
“In all seriousness,” she continued, her smile still on her lips, “I hope you made good use of the day.”
She lunged at him, making her leap across the water. But Sherlock had half a foot on her in height, and he watched the change in her eyes as she realized her mistake. She hit the edge of the rocks on his side of the river, and though she scrambled, her hands clawing for a grip on the slick stone around her, she failed. The current was too strong, and soon she disappeared from view, falling into the river.
I have no doubts that people do not see me as a romantic person. Many have believed over the years that I am incapable of love. I wish that were true.
It was a crisp, cold night. The streets were fairly empty, most of the usual crowds either out of town or safely tucked away in their homes. There was a coating of snow over the ground. Sherlock always preferred the aftermath of snow more than the actual snowfall itself. After the fact, snow left everything calm and empty, always providing a sharp contrast to the conditions inside his brain.
“I need to go over a few schedules with you before we go home for the night. I'll be out of my office the rest of the week, so if you have a moment.” She glanced between the two of them, waiting to see if the man unknown to her would dare to speak. Instead Sherlock only held his hand out to John for the book, John's finger sliding out from its place as he gave it back.
She visibly lost the urge to throw around curse words and have shouting matches for a moment. Instead, she was stilled and gaping at him in disbelief. When she finally broke the silence, she said quietly, “Are you kidding me?”
"Because, when I last saw her in person, she said that even though I helped save her that if I was ever in a situation where it was her or you, that I would choose you without hesitation. She wasn't offended by it, just stating a fact. In fact, she accurately stated that I would choose you over anyone. It would appear the women in our lives are more observant than we are."
But there is no good or subtle way to ask someone if they'll leave you too like everyone else has. No way to beg someone to stay with you without coming off as an emotional manipulator. Instead, there were moments like this, where he could pretend it would be this way forever, that the seemingly inevitable fallout wasn't just around the corner, that somehow, miraculously, someone found his flaws endearing and decided to stay.
“I don't know why I'm surprised. You of all people would have a collection of carnivorous plants.” John shoved his hands into his pockets. Sometimes it was the only way to remind himself not to touch any of the plants. “What are the others?”
Her brow furrowed, confused when he didn't say anything back to her. “You're one of the new doctors, yeah?” she asked.
John kept waiting for the logical part of Sherlock to kick in, to question all of this, but it never did; Sherlock was far too undone for that. And John thought that this was what people meant when they talked about something being a masterpiece, this skin on skin and lips and hands shaking as they reached out for you, and the rest of the world melting away where all you could think about was the body flush with yours, and gasps and sighs and the feeling that it never had to end. There was no better taste than his skin, no better stars than his eyes, and no better art than his hands on John's back, holding them close to each other.
The man could feel Sherlock's eyes on him, and glancing over at him, smiled and said, "I wasn't away all that long, but it looks like they managed to come up with even more types of milk since I've been gone. Ridiculous, isn't it?"
In the harsh glare of the bathroom light, he looked himself over, finding cut after cut, including a very impressive one at his temple that made him wince when he brought a finger to it. But he supposed that he was untouched compared to a lot of people.
“Still awake?” The doors to the car whooshed closed behind John. The lights had been turned down, and Sherlock hadn't bothered to turn them back up. He sat on the sofa as he had earlier. The only indication that he had even moved was the change from his sleek clothes into cotton pajamas and a sweeping robe.
Sherlock had never minded Heaven before, but now it might as well have been hell. He was sent on a couple of small assignments, very tedious ones. Boring cases were always Mycroft's way of punishing him. He hadn't heard of anyone being assigned to John's case. And then Mycroft told him the case had been closed entirely.
Sherlock stared at him, glassy-eyed. John thought he saw his eyes glance at his lips, at which point he determined that yes, he was far drunker than he thought. Must be seeing things. Sherlock Holmes wouldn't stare at someone's lips.
The Neruda sonnet ran on loop in his brain to the point of obsession. He somehow answered another half hour of questions while thinking only about the third stanza. Was this what living felt like? He was approaching a manic energy he hadn't felt in years, an inexplicable high. Could the audience members tell, like Ella surely could? Did it matter if they could?
It took precisely five minutes for him to regret it. The Tesco was full of people. They packed the aisles and got in his way as he attempted to navigate the store. He couldn't even remember the last time he'd set foot in a place like this. By the time he reached the dairy section, he was already annoyed with everyone and everything around him. And then he saw the hundreds of different types of milk available and wondered why people felt they had to needlessly complicate such a simple dietary staple.
There rest of the house appeared to be blissfully unconscious, with the exception of one other insomniac traveler he came across on the room at the back of the building. Whoever occupied it had the curtains closed, but clearly was hell-bent on maxing out the power grid, light bleeding through the fabric onto the pavement at Sherlock's feet.
debuted, he shut the world out. He was sick of being the one who stayed, sick of being the person used but never loved by others. Of course he had his family and his small circle of acquaintances in his life, but would any of them choose him over someone else? Unlikely. So what was John's angle? What was in it for him?
Sherlock had stopped mid-sentence when he'd walked through their front door and saw John sitting on the sofa, a bomb strapped to his chest.
So he walked slowly through the woods, as quietly as he could manage. He stuck to sections of woods heavy with evergreens, fewer leaves to crunch beneath his feet and more cover should another tribute appear.
One night a few weeks later, John came home to find Sherlock sitting at his microscope in the kitchen, a James Bond movie playing on the television in the next room. He grinned as he walked up to the table, setting his keys down and pulling out a chair.
Instead, he ran a hand over it, thinking only of John and Michelangelo: “I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.”
“If you didn't believe me you likely would have called in law enforcement at least fifteen minutes ago. Or you would have guaranteed some sort of defense for yourself, but instead you sat down and talked to me. I don't believe you have any doubt in your mind.”
The entire ride to his childhood home was spent reading it to avoid having to see reminders of his life fly by him. He knew if he looked up at any point he would recognize the shops, the restaurants, the streets, and the somehow ever-visible specter of the Tor in the distance.
John watched as the bird took off again, flying off into the woods till John could no longer see it.
The worst dreams weren't the ones of violence, though. At least he had seen enough violence that he knew what to expect from those. No, the worst ones were about skin on skin and hesitant fingers and brick-walled alleyways and shared breaths. Those were the ones that would wake him up and reduce him to a bitter, boiling rage and a sadness so heavy that it felt like an excavation in his chest.
Sometimes it is better to let a disease eat away at you inside than to chance killing another person with it.
“No!” Sherlock looked up and saw that John was no longer yelling at him. He glared up at the night sky, pointing at it accusingly. “You want your victor? Strike one of us down! I know you can! If you want it that badly, then
John raced to her side, falling to the ground beside her, his gun dropping to the dirt. This wasn't a slow bleed. At least one artery had been hit. There were so many open tears, so many wounds. Molly's breathing was rapid as she stared up at him, unable to speak. The blood was even in her hair, and, dammit, he was so sick of blood.
Outside, they heard the sound of the ambulance doors slamming shut, of the siren cutting on and tearing through the otherwise silent street. John cast one look at Mary and turned to Lestrade, saying in little more than a hoarse growl, “Keep me away from her or I
John took a single step back, Sherlock finally turning his head toward him. No matter how long it took for John to look him up and down, to shake his head, to go through a hundred false starts, Sherlock remained silent, waiting on him.
When they were about halfway to the stage, Sherlock saw a change come over John's face. The panic had vanished. And he called out, “I volunteer!”
John stopped a few feet away from him, growing serious all of a sudden. “The speech.” He paused, visibly debating what else to say, like he'd expected Sherlock to fill in the blanks for him like he usually did. “It was very good.” Sherlock shrugged. “No, seriously. I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't that.”
He mentally filled in the rest of the sentence that he couldn't bring himself to say out loud: something unfeeling like me.
The stairs were narrower than John remembered. When Sherlock sat up straight, they were shoulder to shoulder. Really not wide enough.
Mary overstayed her welcome very quickly, chatting with Sherlock as if they were old friends, and Sherlock was either genuinely happy to meet her or played the part well enough that she believed it. John mostly tried to stay out of the way and prayed to god that she didn't ask any questions they couldn't answer. Perhaps ironically, Mary seemed quite fond of Sherlock, and certainly looked on him with more generosity than she had with John all morning. John couldn't help but wonder if Mary was aware of the elephant in the room, the great unspoken from behind closed doors, and the more he thought about it the more he agonized over what he would eventually have to tell Mary.
KR: Over the past years you've built a reputation for yourself in the book world, and it all started with –
help a little. When asked how his day was, John just shook his head, and the owner seemed to understand the evasion, and unlike his father, did not press further.
Lestrade's face flooded with pity. He couldn't make himself look John in the eyes, so he stared at his desktop, trying to think of what he could say that wouldn't make it worse.
Sherlock stood and walked away, somehow knowing John would follow. He made his way through the shelves like it was pure muscle memory, passing by general fiction, self-help, humor, all the familiar signposts, weaving between various patrons. Poetry was in a back corner, an aisle partially hidden from the rest of the shop. It was one of Sherlock's favorite things about this particular store. Even though he could hear the other shoppers, the background noises of keys rattling in someone's purse, the whispered conversations, he felt isolated here, invisible.
“Now and then one stumbles upon a human being worthy of such a comparison. Not often. But sometimes.”
“Everything is just, well, dull by comparison after living with him so long. I don't know if I'm capable of a regular life. People talk about how extraordinary he was, and they're right. He really was extraordinary. His world wasn't like Mary's world, like everyone else's. I want
Sherlock watched him from behind his laptop across the room. He liked these calm evenings in Baker Street. True, it lacked the adrenaline and speed of the work, but now and again, he preferred this slice of domesticity.
Sherlock approached the cemetery after he was confident most of the people were gone, and so when he arrived, it was only John and Mrs. Hudson who remained. He let the world continue to move until Mrs. Hudson walked away. When it was only John left, talking to a tombstone, he stopped it.
She shrugged. “You suit each other. You make a good team. If any two people could have pulled off the impossible, it would be you. They wanted a good show and you provided.”
By the time he returned to his room, he was a nervous wreck, on the verge of a full panic, and it took nearly fifteen minutes for him to calm down.
"Yes, I am." I huffed out a sigh of frustration. "Many times, I have ignored other people's concern for me. Perhaps I shouldn't. Albeit, it is more difficult to ignore your concern."
"Yes," Sherlock said. "This sort of weather is wonderful. It always empties the streets of a large percentage of people, and therefore, a large percentage of stupid people." Sherlock saw John smile out of the corner of his eye. "So where are you dragging me to?"
Sherlock let out a little huff of a sigh. The Holmes equivalent of an eye roll. “Well it didn't seem worth discussing until there was actually something we could do. Art museum bombings aren't nearly as interesting as you would think. Since now it looks as if we'll actually be able to do something for this hopeless case, now you know. I didn't see any reason to mention it till now.”
The door opened and a Peacekeeper let Harry slink in. Her eyes were red from crying, and when John stood up, she rushed to him and collapsed against him, holding on to him like she had no intention of letting him go. He put his arms around her and tried to calm her down, to no avail.
Sherlock burst through the door as he always did, never considering that someone might want things quieter. John watched in silence as he went through his usual steps – gloves, scarf, coat – his irritation vanishing almost instantly. As much as he liked the idea of an empty flat, the simple fact of the matter was that Sherlock made everything feel so much more alive.
The next morning, I woke up, blessedly alone, in my own bed, wondering foggily how much of my sense of propriety I had lost the night before. I felt relief wash over me when I saw I had passed out fully clothed.
“I never asked for this. None of us did. I just want to go home and pretend this never happened. I want to go home, take care of my sister, and quietly live my life. The district is miserable some days, but it's better than this. And you're right, we'll both probably end up dead. And I'm glad Mary will look after Harry when the time comes, but she shouldn't have to. It shouldn't be like this.”
Sherlock couldn't manage a single act of productivity that night, although truthfully he felt as if he hadn't been genuinely productive in years. But all he had managed was a cursory search of the thriller novelist online and a great deal of staring at the ceiling agonizing over the forgotten book. Had he left it behind in the shop? Had he dropped it somewhere on the way home? He almost wanted to call Mike and wake him up just to ask him if he had seen it lying around anywhere, but showed – he thought – remarkable restraint in not doing so.
There had been many nights where John had sat in the same spot, debating whether or not he should take the painting out to look at it. He always ended up leaving it hidden. The chances that Sherlock would venture up to his room were slim; it wasn't a common occurrence, but it was
The museum he finally settled on was so untouched, so pristine and calm that he had to remind himself that not
They both jerked their heads toward the ballroom when they heard the shouting, an enthusiastic countdown ending with cheers and “Auld Lang Syne.” Everyone was pouring drinks and singing along, hugging and kissing people, all traditions Sherlock had never understood. Lestrade kissed Molly, who turned bright red before kissing him back. Typical. They were all so preoccupied they probably hadn't even realized that neither John nor Sherlock were even in the room anymore.
The man's head snapped up, looking terrified that he'd been seen for a split second before covering his face with his usual expression, a self-deprecating sort of smile. "Afraid so. Out of milk already?"
Black on black on black. John kept swinging the gun in the direction of the growls, praying they would stay in one place long enough for him to shoot. But then what if the noise was tricking him and he wasn't even aiming in the right direction?
“Well, it's still a new variety, right? Even if it isn't the one you were hoping for. Don't people name these things?”
As the night dragged on, his thoughts landed on Sherlock more than once, no matter how many times he told himself to quit worrying about someone who was no longer his friend, but his competition.
He ran into Sherlock in the hallway at the bottom of the stairs, Sherlock evidently on his way to check in himself. He looked miserable, still in yesterday's clothes, with dark circles under his eyes.
The world fell out from under him, but he forced himself to keep walking, grateful that Sherlock had slowed down. He shoved his hands in his pockets and stared at the ground in front of him. “It's a city at night, I think.” When he finally mustered the nerve to look back at Sherlock, he realized that he probably hadn't ever taken his eyes off the sky.
They were all questions he had heard in some form or another posed to various novelists who had come through Mike's shop. On the rare occasion a poet was the center of the night, the questions were always markedly different, always about existential dread and catharsis.
Sherlock pulled his phone out and placed a call, talking quietly into it, and John sighed, resigning himself to the fact that they would be here a while.
He held pressure on his shoulder, waiting for the bleeding to stop. John had always wondered what it felt like to be shot, and now he was confident he had a good idea. The pain wouldn't subside, even after he had controlled the bleeding. It came at him with a vengeance, sharper and stronger every time he tried to move. Until now, his panic had been kept it at bay, long enough for him to get to safety. But now that he sat alone, half-concealed on his ledge, his body gave up, no longer able to pretend he hadn't had his shoulder torn apart. He teased away the ripped pieces of fabric to get a better look at the wound. Best-case scenario, he would have a bright star burst of a scar. But he was alive.
“Ideally, I suppose, you would find someone just as strange or broken as you. Unfortunately, the world doesn't seem to have many people like that around.”
As the fog cleared from his head he heard the rushed and panting breathing from a few feet away. The girl from eight, Molly, backed up against a nearby boulder, a knife held out in front of her. She tried to steel herself, but her hands trembled. As John looked around the little clearing, surrounded by thick brush, supplies and weapons scattered around, he finally pieced it all together. He propped himself up with one hand and held the other out, palm to Molly, a silent
When they wheeled his body away, John remained rooted to his place on the street, a single frozen person in a moving world.
A deathbed act, an admission that should have been whispered in a hotel room with the night breeze coming through the curtains. A moment that should have only been touched by early morning calm. A point of no return that should have been passed that first night in the church.
“I told you I knew what they liked.” Irene flashed them a pleased smirk. “Thank god for good stylists.” Hudson gave a dismissive wave of her hand. Anthea was too preoccupied with her gadget to notice. Irene looked between John and Sherlock. “Whose idea was the hand thing? Oh, don't tell me, it must have been you, John. Not really Sherlock's style, is it? It was a good move.”
Sherlock eyed the bottles and vials, his gaze lingering far too long on the syringe. He saw the boy out of the corner of his eye, following his line of sight before turning back to Sherlock, his expression tinged with disapproval.
Sherlock stopped at the table of bright cut flowers and took off his gloves, shoving them into his pocket before brushing the flowers to the side of the table.
When he searched for information about the oleander shrubs, he found that they shouldn't have even been able to grow in England at all. They were native to far off places like the Arabian peninsula and Portugal. It was tropical and subtropical, certainly not meant for the cool rainy climes in England. So why had it been flourishing? How?
John stood there for a few agonizing seconds, trying to make sense of too many things at once. He looked around the alley, hating his inability to focus on anything important, anything
“This may be worse than usual. I wouldn't blame you for staying out of it. In fact it may be a good idea.”
“Just stopping by for a visit. I don't see you at the clinic anymore, since you quit there. Thought it might be nice to say hello. Sorry Sherlock isn't here too. He amuses me.” She never sat down, always making rounds, her eyes falling on all the little details of their daily lives. “I came by last week, actually, to see you two. But Mrs. Hudson told me you were in Rome.” She halted her steps for a moment to turn and look at him over her shoulder. “I never could get you to go to Rome with me.” She didn't say this with the veiled malice she had had earlier, but instead faced this truth with a sort of affectionate chagrin. The tone of voice didn't match well with her posture, but John was grateful even for the attempted pleasantry. “It's a wonderful place, isn't it? When your loved ones aren't dying there?”
Both John and Sherlock closely watched the tributes from District 1, Jim and Kitty. They'd both been dressed like royalty again. A crown seemed to be Jim's token accessory. Whenever he spoke, the crowds fell in love with him a little bit more. And while he was superficially charming much in the way that Sherlock could be, he made John uneasy. There was something in the way he moved that wasn't quite right, and sometimes his sarcasm didn't sound quite so sarcastic. Kitty wasn't all that better, but her true self was more poorly concealed, and it was clear that that was what she intended. There was a sort of ruthlessness in her eyes that made John think she'd willingly chase down any one of them, and lose no sleep over doing so.
He hid successfully for a while, skulking around outside with his drink or wandering through the small tight rooms of the house, even resorting to sitting in his childhood room for a while with the door shut, pretending to not exist. But the room itself didn't allow for quite enough hiding, so for some time, he sat alone inside his closet, door shut in the oddly peaceful darkness, staring at his phone, willing Sherlock's name to appear on it, but unable to hasten that result by reaching out himself. He'd felt foolish, the way he'd talked last night, and he couldn't help but wonder what Sherlock must be thinking of him. Until now he had appeared relatively in control of his own emotions, but this business with his family had stripped away everything but the rawest parts of him. He should have kept his goddamn mouth shut. If there was one thing his father had taught him, it was that.
He'd never really been clear on what Mycroft did. He'd said once that he occupied a minor position in the government, and Sherlock had quickly refuted him, saying he
He looked downright pathetic then, so insecure, yet so hateful. I threw him a disdainful scowl and left the room.
“Prose or verse?” He stared at the bright light of the phone screen, glancing around the otherwise dimly lit room. Too harsh for the setting, and too harsh for John.
Sherlock actually spoke at dinner that night, but only to John. He ignored Mycroft entirely, and only communicated with Irene through a series of nods and occasional glares. Even to John, he only said a few words, but it was certainly a dramatic improvement.
Sherlock spent the rest of the night watching out the window as children came and went, always monitoring John's reactions. Mrs. Hudson came by at one point, but Sherlock didn't know what she'd wanted. He couldn't be bothered to pay attention to her tonight.
After the confrontation at the pool, we sat in Baker Street, John making tea, as always, no doubt in an effort to calm us both down.
This kiss was supposed to happen. No cameras, no ulterior motives, impossible to ever explain away with excuses about acts. No way to misinterpret, no way to pretend. The entire country had seen so much of them, but no one could see them now, finally. The world might as well have been only this room.
It was one of the announcements over the intercom that drew him back to the present, a calm but serious voice saying, “Code blue, OR 3. Code blue, OR 3.” When the message clicked off with a crushing sense of finality, John looked to Lestrade, knowing full well they were thinking the same thing.
John wasn't sure why he'd decided it was a good idea to go to Sherlock's room that night, drink in hand. It was very late, so late that it was almost pointless to even try to sleep, and he had been sitting up in their living room all night (he still found himself saying
“Is he past my time? He must be quite a man of note to have an entire production made to chronicle his life.”
“It wouldn't have been my first risky, stupid decision,” John said, pulling off his own gloves and shoving them in his pockets.
John finally started coming down once he was backstage where it was safe and he didn't have to smile for cameras or cheerily answer questions. The audience had loved him, or so said Mycroft and Irene, but he barely heard them. It was all becoming too real.
A new set of hands pulled at him, more strong and insistent than the Romans and the tourists. He saw the black car out of the corner of his eye – Mycroft's people, fucking of course – and the men, Mycroft's hired hands, grabbed at his arms and physically dragged him away despite his fighting.
They walked together through the terminal, Sherlock with his hands in his coat pockets, laughing at something John had said. When John stopped to go his own way to board his next flight, Sherlock paused beside him.
Sherlock didn't stop the world when John was home. He didn't feel he could risk it. John was not the most observant man, but he was certainly smart enough to notice if the layout of Sherlock's experiment in the kitchen had changed, or if Sherlock himself randomly disappeared from his place on the sofa. No, it was much too great a risk. John would either think he had something wrong with himself or would insist on an explanation from Sherlock.
Shortly after the incident with Lestrade, John determined he would attempt to live a bit of a normal life. He would still work cases with Sherlock, of course, but he thought it would do him good to do at least a little part time work in a clinic, just to stay in practice. Sherlock seemed less than thrilled with the idea, but then, Sherlock seemed less than thrilled with most things that regular people did.
He'd walked to this headstone so many times that he didn't even need to pay conscious attention to get there. It was just as much ingrained in his brain as the replays of the fall.
“I was planning on telling Mycroft once the news about Mary died down. I was going to get rid of it, I swear.”
They were deep in the woods when he finally said, “Sherlock, is there a point to all this?” The man was standing in the middle of the path, turning in circles, scanning the trees while he held his thumb over the puncture wound. His eyes finally settled on a patch of wildflowers, and he began to pick them like a child gathering a bouquet for a parent. When he held them out at arm's length toward John, he saw them wilt and die in his hands. Sherlock loosened his grip, letting the dead flowers fall to the ground. He turned around, glaring at the forest. He stepped off the path, laying his uninjured hand against the trunk of a large tree. When he drew away, there was a hand print left behind, the tree's wood rotting in that one place. Sherlock repeated the demonstration with other trees, sliding his hands over them and leaving marks behind like bloody hand prints at a crime scene. He tore leaves from thin branches, watched them all turn brown as they dropped to the forest floor.
Sherlock noticed the world stopped less after a while. Whoever had discovered their new power clearly didn't enjoy it or felt no reason to use it as he did. He was sure he annoyed the other person with his frequency of use, but he was also sure they wouldn't mind if they knew he was using it to catch murderers.
“Look, I don't need this, not from you. What's done is done. They could have just killed one of us if that's what they wanted so badly.”
“The man from my district is still alive too. Mike. I don't think there's many more where both of the people are still alive. I'm glad Sherlock's okay, as far as we know.”
Time passes differently when you're in a panic and are powerless to do anything. It passes quickly and slowly at the same time. Look at the clock, and an hour has passed. Spend an eternity pacing and wringing your hands, and it's been ten seconds. John briefly wondered if it was just as infuriating to Lestrade, but despite the ever-increasing time they spent in the waiting room together, John never opened his mouth to ask him anything, to comment on anything. And Lestrade blessedly allowed him his silence.
When he brought the food into the living room, handing Sherlock a plate, he noticed what he was watching. “Why are you watching that?”
Sherlock pulled his gloves off, dropping them on the table. He sighed as he rubbed his hands over his face.
“Where's Lila?” John asked from his usual chair, country sun cutting through the windows. “The woman who was cooking?”
When John woke up the next morning, Sherlock was still there, sleeping beside him, his fingers still loosely holding his wrist.
“Get right to the point, do you? She will be along shortly. She was rather, how shall we say, indisposed.”
“You give me too much credit. I'm difficult. The running after serial killers alone is a bit problematic.”
What was even more impressive was how Sherlock reached these results. His deductive process was astounding, the way he reasoned through things was just extraordinary.
“The worst day of my life was shortly after I got back from Afghanistan. I looked at my gun in my desk drawer, and it looked inviting.” Sherlock paused, cigarette halfway to his lips. Not quite pity, but something in that area. “Do you know what that's like?”
But there was no time for sentimental farewells. John had one passing thought that at least Sherlock would be able to cope easily with these final goodbyes, since he deplored sentiment so much.
So if this performance could speak for him, he prayed it would. There was no way to verbally convey desperation. No way to explain who Sherlock Holmes was.
In a very calm voice that belied how upset he was, he answered, “If statistics are to be believed, then my judgment is irrelevant. There's a reason you're the only victor our district has to offer, Miss Adler. The odds have never been in our favor, and I don't believe there's any hope of that changing any time soon.”
He felt like a poet cliché, potentially loving someone far more than the other person would ever be able to manage. And so once again, Auden and the stars were there to taunt him.
John nodded, running his hands over himself, not feeling the gun anywhere. He felt his heart start pounding when Molly handed it to him. The cold metal felt heavy in his hands, but at least it looked like it belonged there. It had only looked horrible in her hands.
