“I mean it’s a bit problematic to be totally objective even for me. John is my dearest friend and it’s upsetting hearing about how much he suffered as a child and teenager.”
Laughing so hard the coffee nearly drips from his mug, John answers with a teasing, “Wait and see, love!”
Waiting on decision on what will be his punishment for fighting being drunk.
It doesn’t take long before the  feeling overtakes John too.
John is totally shocked and Peter thinks Sherlock is very perceptive  and brave to ask. The question is how will John react?
1969 December 4, Hamish comes home on recovery leave. He is at first staying at military hospital for 4 months.
“Oh!” A little sound that contains so many questions and relief at the same time.
John’s first reaction was fear, fear what other people would say--or was that his father’s voice?
“Well, I think you’ve diagnosed yourself with a little help from Janine. I was wondering about one thing: Why did Janine do the things she did when John visited your flat? Making a pretense of being your lover, coming out of your bedroom very scantily clothed, specially choosing to wear your shirt?”
“Yes.” Sherlock waits for him to ask more questions.
1 April 1876. Hamish Montgomery Watson is born in Buckie.
Peter looks at Sherlock and nods.
Stopping the moment, I showed even a little discomfort?
John opens the door and Sherlock immediately asks.
Silently he had went for a glass and picked up John’s half-full whiskey bottle.
“Okay. Good to know.” John’s left hand is twitching with emotion. Richard looks on with a worried expression.
John is already lying on his stomach in the middle of the bed when he returns, having only his pants on. Sherlock shows the lotion and gets an approving nod.
August 2021
That we ended up in bed, that's not so surprising, but you taking the lead?
Thinking the question over, Sherlock changes positions in the armchair, slightly moving his body to close down and away from Peter’s direct gaze.
His own hand is on a long thin cook, so like the rest of the body of Sherlock.
John glances over his shoulder with a rueful look before asking, “Are you afraid I’ll react badly because of what happened earlier tonight?”
John’s dream that morning.
Some links to see how they travel.
“Lover.” That was what he was now. This tender and loving man. The most caring of all his partners he had in all his life. This wasn’t anything to feel ashamed or bad about. Wonder what Marcus would say if I told him?
“Yes, we did see the looks between you.” The other man smiles broadly and shakes John’s hand.
“That’s the first time anyone had ever told me about demisexuality. The more we talked, the more I realized that’s what I am. She was wrong about one thing though. I’m gay.”
“So, it wasn’t only in my mind?”
Rosie isn’t impressed, she’s screaming and letting everyone know that she doesn’t like the situation she’s in at all.
Monty tells John about his father and family. They are both surprised over how many life experience in their both families have been very much alike: how much of family life involved religion, keeping up the appearance of being manly for the men and boys. Religious rules made family dynamics hard sometimes for some in the family.
After one more heated discussion where Sherlock, frustration clear in voice and body language, explained his thoughts about the whole thing:
I accept all things you have suggested in your letter. Maybe a massage would be a good starting point?
This fic would probably be a sleep and me hiding in a corner for not writing it.
Sherlock’s grip tightens around John’s fingers.
After a quick look at his watch he goes to the bathroom to shower and shave.
Sherlock’s Friday before the anniversary weekend
“Should we relieve you of some of your clothes?” Sherlock asks.
The two men had done everything they could to surprise the brothers, which wasn't the easiest thing to do! John smiles smugly, thinking how they had used their friends to put out red herrings for the Holmes brothers to find.
Feeling ashamed in the bathroom with Mary and Rosie only a door or two away, with his hand on his prick. Not being able to fantasize about another woman or Sherlock. Always feeling so guilty, not for Mary’s sake but for--Sherlock’s.
I usually don’t ask for a comment but this time it’s intriguing to know what you feel?
Again John gives him a cheeky question.
John can’t sit still while waiting for previous client to be finished with Peter.
2002                Marcus meets Eric and they start a relationship.
After the call they decided to change clothes and meet in the entrance hall in an hour. Sherlock let John have the shower first because, he said, John had been renovating the flat all day. Even that thoughtfulness from Sherlock was still a bit confusing for John.
It becomes dark, the only light coming from the little window.
Peter hears the last words and interrupts him.
John is really nervous now, but also determined to go through with his plan for the evening.
John left for work at the same time Harry came to collect Rosie for a weekend visit at her and her girlfriend’s place.
“You haven’t had any sexual inclination for over a year.” John flinch when he hears that.
John is throwing out his left arm and stirring in his nightstand drawer. Getting the lube out and opening the tubecap with one hand and pouring into both his and Sherlock’s hands at the same time.
“Alright, but that doesn’t mean I’m happy about stopping now!”
“Yes, but only if we use safe words. If it feels right we go on, but if you ever feel overwhelmed or if it--”
She shakes her head and looks very sad. “I missed Ossian for a very long time after he died. You know, my old father could be hard to deal with sometimes. Especially if he’d had something to drink. At such times it was better to get Ossian than call for the police. He lifted my father and took him to his cottage so he could sleep it off. Sometimes old Mr W helped him carry him.”
“Ah, and that’s when you saw them in a intim situation?” Peter is trying to hide a little smile with a hand over his mouth.
In that time period it wasn't common to get the children a grief counselling or psychological support after a parent died."
“You mean that we both did something wrong and that must change if we’re going to live together again?”
Giles shakes both John’s and Sherlock’s hands before looking at the little girl in the stroller. “And who’s this little beauty?”
Suddenly he heard a moan!
“I more or less told him that he can’t stay in the closet if he wants to have a relationship with me. Friendship or a partnership?”
“No problem, I’ll be back soon.”
He’s received a love letter!
But neither I nor you will take J. H’s place in his heart!
Marcus goes to a bookshelves at the door. There is a carved wooden box, very beautiful.
“Why? Hamish loves frogs, and he’s my froggy!”
“Not before both men were carefully interrogated. Hamish didn’t say anything about the reason behind the fight and the other man didn’t say anything either.
“Yes. He started to study as a doctor in the military after a *friend* of his became injured. John Henry Doyle.”
That evening they talked about how uncertain and upset John had been.
Now the mould and damp were removed and the renovation had been going on for a couple of weeks. He wanted to be active in renovating this flat that Rosie would get to own when she became twenty-one.
Sherlock had looked deep into his eyes, searching for fear or resentment.
“Sherlock and Richard are on it, with photos and on page three, an interview with Sherlock.”
Monty comes back and stands beside his husband. Looking at John he starts to speak, “The Scandal in St Gregory Church, the family curse.”
“Yes! Right now! I’m going to ask the bartender if we can borrow a quiet room for a moment. I won’t take no for an answer.” John is glaring at Sherlock with both anger and frustration.
Hearing Sherlock at night fighting and screaming in his dreams. Some nights he could hear him wander around in the little room he slept in or in the living room downstairs.
When I am stressed or on a case that takes all my thought process, makes me not interested. If you touch me in such a situation I can react very badly--sorry, but that’s how I would react. Not because I don’t love you, it’s just a bodily reaction.”
“No, it’s okay. I can maybe hold you lightly and play with your hair?”
He stops talking and looks for Sherlock’s reaction to what he’s said.
The problem is that John is looking determently down on his hands in his lap with a stiff look and clenching jaws. Sherlock decides to keep on talking. Telling what’s he wants to say to his friend.
“Yes, but it’s important that the students gets a insight on how things works and if it's something they want to do in the future.”
John has found his voice now and flashes the woman a smile.
“I’m so sorry that you had to live through that, John.” Marcus voice penetrating John’s thoughts.
Time passes without either of them really noticing, the air in the bedroom is full of soft moans and words, John’s soft voice.
Nodding, Monty agrees. “Yes, I know what you mean, doesn’t matter if I hate every minute of it. It has given me a life with Giles and a wonderful child.”
He’s a grown man who can’t handle being thrown on the bed and having Sherlock above him? Again he wonders if it’s his father’s voice that made him panic.
Please, if you’re a person that can’t read something with grammatical problems or misspellings. Don’t read this!
Next chapter will be the last chapter!
Sherlock shyly looks down at the tube in his hand, biting his lower lip before answering, “It’s been very tense between us for a long time now. Living together and at the same time therapy and working on our relationship?” His voice is uncertain.
“I saw you with Adam.” James spoke with a controlled voice.
“Maybe we both need time and therapy to understand what we want and what we really feel.”
A visible shudder goes through his body. “I liked prostate stimulation and the release that stimulation can give me. Why shouldn’t I use a toy when I want to? It’s not that I use it every time, but when I’m relaxed and it feels right.”
Removing himself from the close observation from Peter and John.
Sherlock thinks it over for a long time.
“Your mother! Jean Leekey, what do you know about her?”
John goes to Sherlock to say hi.“Sherlock, is everything okay?” John eyes the man next to Sherlock at the same time as John puts his right hand on Sherlock’s nearest arm and squeezes his arm a little.
If someone feels that they would like to beta read this fic, please contact me here or on Tumblr. Maybe then this fic would be a bit faster written? Tildathings.
“What could Monty tell you about Hamish Montgomery?”
Therefore the only remorse I have now is that I will be leaving my daughter. She and her brother are the only good thing to come from my second marriage.
The journey goes well, with two short breaks. The first one because nature calls for John. Sherlock finds very interesting flowers that some bees really like. Rosie is as much fascinated as her godfather, looking at the bees.
“Ah, good. I didn’t know I was hungry.”
“Yes. John Henry and my Father were officer recruits at the same time and trained together at Sandhurst in Surrey. Hamish, that’s my Father, was 18 years old in 1965 and soon to be a father for the first time.” He looks at Richard, the man is steadily meeting his eyes. John then looks at Sherlock and continues answering his questions.
He can’t get a handle on all the feelings floating around in his brain.
“Upstairs now!”
Sherlock’s response comes quickly now.
John remembers how happily Sherlock had smiled when he read the card before registering John’s confused face.
In response to that, John smiles fondly at the man in front of him.
“Alright, plan the trip and we talk later tonight how we can do it.
“Yes, He was a Captain, but never became anything more because of problems with alcohol.”
“Do you know why Hamish’s punishment was so hard when his children showed interest in a person with the same sex as their own?” The question is made rather briskly by Sherlock.
They found a little restaurant that neither of them had been to before. The food was a fusion restaurant, European/ Japanese.
“No, we don’t need the light, Sherlock!” He protests with a soft voice.
Sherlock reacts immediately to Peter’s harsh words.
When John comes back he sees how close Sherlock is standing again.
He’s slowly starting to understand that his cousin is some years before him in the journey to accepting himself, and is really trying to help him.
“So you wouldn’t be offended if I have’d a sex dream about you with maybe a happy ending?”
“Soooo, you won’t start anything because you could lose me?!”
All right, time to tell the whole story. He grumbles to himself, steeling his nerves.
“John, I’ll just clean you up a little bit.”
John stands up from where he’s sitting and turns to him. When Sherlock stops in front of him he lays his arms around him and hugs him. A hug that’s mimic the hug he gave him after the speech at his wedding.
My safe words are;
Rosie, his little darling, was spending the weekend with her aunt.
“It's not right for me to dream about him! He’s with Richard now!”
“Father didn’t want us to meet.” It's a quiet acknowledgment of what the older man meant. “You may want to meet Rosie, Hamish grandchild?
He takes the place John had stood many years ago, as he glances at the man besides him. John smiles at him and winks.
30 September 1925. The priest found out about Hamish and Ossian, notes from the priest’s own diary of the years 1920-1927.
“Yes.”
“John, again, Sherlock and Richard’s relationship isn’t anything that you have anything to do with.”
“He already knows this, we have talked about it. Richard has also a had past relationship that influences him even today. His husband was killed in a accident nearly two years ago. He will never love me as he loves Alexander.”
When Monty comes back with the teapot he refills his mug and John’s. He sits down in his armchair and looks at his cousin, and starts by asking a question.
It’s Friday evening, one day short of John and Sherlock's anniversary of finally getting together as a couple.
John still remembers how fearful that look had made him.
For John, standing beside the double bed it looks like his daughter is trying to hear and understand what Sherlock is saying. Looking into her godfather’s eyes.
From Sherlock’s notes from documents shown by the church.
After some time, and after Sherlock has eaten half of his breakfast, he lays down his cutlery on the plate and looks up on John.
Dear Sherlock
He plucks the mobile from the pocket and goes to the bedroom, “John, your mobile is ringing!” He drops the phone on the bed beside John.
A little fear creeps up on John, “Earlier this evening when we walked to the hotel when I took your hand, how did that feel?”
“John, take a breath. What are you angry about? That Sherlock wants to save your friendship or some other reason?” Peter’s question is asked with a very soft voice.
“Do you think you can massage my neck and shoulders now, if I lie down?”
Sherlock realizes he’s talking about the day he was on his way to him.
They had met for lunch after Sherlock left Peter’s office.
Sherlock closes the fridge door and goes back to his bed. Sitting down in the bed drinking the water his thoughts go to John’s reaction to Peter's explanation of controlling behaviour.
“Yes.”
John goes after him and quickly embraces him. He whispers in Sherlock’s right ear.
He can’t get out the three little words that he desperately wants to say. Then Sherlock rumbles out, “Love you too.”
Peter flips his notebook closed and says,
Sherlock opens his mouth a little and lets his breath caress John´s lips. John inhales through his nose and lets his tongue follow Sherlock’s lower lip, then pulls away and asks, “Is that answer enough, or do I need to tell you that I love you more than anyone in this world?”
**********************
“You don't like pants!”
“He isn’t outing anyone other than himself. When he’s asked about you he answers truthfully that you two are friends, nothing more and nothing less than that. You two have never been anything more to each other than best friends. He even goes so far that he says that you’re straight but his best friend.”
Hamish Montgomery Watson
“Sherlock Holmes is on a date with a man!” Peter gasps in mock-horror.
“I came out to Sherlock Saturday evening--” he takes some sips of water and a deep breath before he starts talking again.“--and I told him that he’s the love of my life.”
The two children liked each other immediately, especially after John let Rosie loose from the stroller and they could run around in the garden. That made it easy for the children to really play, and for the two cousins to talk.
“You had time to talk to a ghost when you were on a mission, but you didn’t have time to phone me or text me.”
“Especially when it’s nowhere written in the New Testament that love between two men is forbidden. It’s only written in the Old Testament and today the Catholic Church doesn’t follow that Testament. If we did, why do you have on clothes in different fibers?” Giles asks with a lifted eyebrow, inspecting the Father’s clothes.
Sherlock nods and takes Rosie from his arms. John goes around the car and into the other side's backseat door.
“I think you’re making Richard to be a bigger obstacle than he is. You’re not competing about anything. Richard already knows and understand this. He’s not jealous of you. I think he is relieved that we will try and save our relationship.”
“We’re a couple and should only be doing things with each other,” he thought. A quick wank in the shower made him feel guilty enough.
Sherlock hadn’t trusted him!
Buckie is a very small town with many older people who have lived here all their lives. People like to gossip, and a scandal in the church, especially one involving one or two of the church employees, will have been memorable.” He shrugs. “Come, let’s start the investigation immediately. John, can you and Monty contact—”
Rosie is sleeping against him and John holding their combined hands lying above her little body.
The guy had whispered to him if they could leave and go somewhere private? Somehow John found that to be a very good idea.
2003 1 Feb.     Hamish leaves for rehab.
“His first long time lover?” Sherlock asks quietly.
********************************************************
Happiness, because he made John want him.
Slowly he sips on his now pretty cold tea, thinks about how much work both he and Sherlock had put into therapy, on different areas of their lives.
The photo showed a man, not conventionally good-looking but with a face you immediately trusted.
“She loves pancakes with strawberry jam.”
“You said it was alright for me to touch you!” John argues loudly and throws his hands in the air.
John haven’t had any sex for a long time, even getting in the mod have been none existent.
“There was my Father with two gay kids. A doctor and active in the local church. His family had been active in the church for four generations!”
His thoughts had raged on.
1979 February 2, Hamish begins his deployment to Ireland as a Doctor.
What’s important are Rosie and Sherlock.
Silence falls over the room, none of the two men are saying anything. John’s mind is like a tumbler. His feelings are so hard for him to understand.
“Because, you want this relationship to be healthy?”
Darin’s first response had been to invite Sherlock to sit down in an armchair and then answer the question. “Yes, I'm gay and you’ve already met my life partner Peter Morse.” His smile had been warm and relaxed.
Giles starts talking to John and Sherlock.
His normal black Calvin Klein pants weren't revealing in any way he thought. He had put them on for to shock John or any other man in the changing room by going commando. He normally thought pants weren’t especially necessary, and were very constricting when he bothered to put them on; he didn´t like that feeling.
Sherlock only stands in front of him, watching John be overwhelmed for a long time. Then he decides to sit down on the bed with John’s hand still in his own, slowly caressing that hand between both of his.
Well, two weeks of editing I have decided to post it anyway.
Peter interrupts John’s question.
*************
many times before.
“No, I haven’t.”
“Have something happened, Sherlock?”
People had always found something wrong with him or that he wasn’t good enough. At the pair session the second week after the boxing club incident, he had tried to explain it.
“I wouldn’t mind being glued to you,” he hears the sleepy response.
1984                 New Year’s Day Hamish and Marcus start their sexual relationship
The tears falls and he can’t stop them. It’s takes many hours and a diaper change on Rosie before he at last falls asleep.
“You mean, you don’t hate me?”
He only hugged him and asked something about dinner or something else totally ordinary.
“I want to talk about something I’m not proud of.”
“You didn’t hear what I said when you were between my legs?” Breathing hard he pushes out, “That I said, ‘Anytime!’”
“Isn’t that why you wanted a family room?” John’s remark has thrown Sherlock a bit. Why would they in other cases not go with a double for the Watson’s and a single room for him?  If it wasn’t for the kitchenette and a bigger bathroom?
“If that is your final word, Father Holstii, then Giles and I must investigate on our own. You can probably imagine that Criminal Inspector Watson Merivale and I are used to finding the truth? He is a master interrogator, and as the world’s only consulting detective I have solved many difficult cases, cases thought to be insoluble.
After only a couple of alone and paired sessions, John said he had realized something big about himself.
“I can understand that.” Mike nods and looks like he agrees with what Sherlock said.
*****************************
“Marcus, the lover of John's father, told us about a big scandal in the family that made him petrified of being open about his sexual orientation.”
A bit surprised, Sherlock answered that he'd had coffee with her the last time they met that week. John had smiled and said that she maybe could be a new friend he could do things with.
Sherlock tries to talk to John, who whispers back, “We’ll talk on the train, I promise.” He lets John go and instead starts speaking with Giles about interesting cases Giles may have had as a criminal detective.
Sherlock leans away from him to catch his eye. “Does that bother you?”
While Sherlock made breakfast and packed her bag, John grumpily ate his breakfast, thinking that Sherlock was trying to get into his good books again. He’d grimly tried to keep his anger from bubbling over.
A quick look at his watch--Sherlock won’t be back for at least twenty minutes. He leans back into the armchair. Letting the memory of the time when he met James Sholto.
“Yes, and I can’t find the reason for why he did that. Not by doing a internet search. I must go to Buckie and St. Gregory and see if there are any information to find in church paper’s.”
“Stupid? No, I’m here. Please! No more drugs or falling from rooftops!”
“I’ll go and put our order for breakfast on the door handle and stretch my legs for a bit, shall I? Give Rosie some time to really fall to sleep in your arms?” *lucky girl* goes through his brain.
“Well, she is 18 months now and starting to realize that you’re a separate person from her. I think if she can hear us and we’re not far away it wouldn’t be a problem.”
Cleaning himself before leaving for a quick visit to the toilet.
The years that followed before starting his military and surgery education were-- dull.
Not saying anything John only nods, takes his pajamas and goes to the bathroom. His stride is fast and determined.
“Why?”
A knock at the door between their two compartments makes him turn around at the same time as John opens the door.
Not adult stories about how Sherlock and John have sex, but: what makes them grow as people?
“Yes! It’s thicker than the other pages in the book, clever John!”
****************
Sherlock mocks him by playing hurt, and why should he remember a thing that he could Google?
John goes back to his chair and sits down.
John hastily takes the phone and looks at it before saying, “It’s Greg!”
Sherlock seems to understand. He lifts his head and whispers, “You're hundred percent man, John, and you will always be. From the first day we met, you’ve been my protector, my soldier!” He leans forward and steals another sweet kiss.
On the highest shelf, high enough for John not to easily see what’s on it, are many different lotions, creams, and--as far back on the shelf as possible--lubricants of many different kinds.
“Do you know about the intercrural position? I was thinking about our different heights and you wanting me close this time.”
“Yes, Thank you. Take care of yourself, Marcus.”
If you live with suicide thoughts, please seek help.
Irritated, John changed his reading material to a new book he’d bought the week before. He tried to concentrate on the book, not on listening to what Sherlock was doing.
Smiling, John follows his cousin.
“Yes, Of course. I know this isn’t something you normally ever do, Sherlock.”
“You had a new relationship at that time?” The question is said very softly from Sherlock.
Slowly, the solutions to the problems that interrupted their lives started to work for them.
“Thank you, will you help me put her in the car seat?”
The question didn’t really sound surprised, as though Sherlock expected he had two wives.
He looks swiftly up at Peter, who gives him a nod to keep talking. With his eyes back on the carpet it’s easier for him to say what he wants to say.
He goes to the doorway into the next room and sees Sherlock and Richard sitting there both drinking a cup of something and waiting for him and Rosie to come.
Often Sherlock would sit up in the bed and demand a real goodbye kiss. That made John smile.
************************
He frowns and opens his mouth to respond but the words don’t want to come out. Peter looks at him and realizes how upset he is over the question.
Sherlock works for some time, concentrating on the knots in the shoulder.
Still a bit embarrassed and not finding the right words the room falls silent again.
“It’s only so bloody hard and frustrating sometimes, doing therapy.” John’s face is starting to become a bit red. Specially after what Sherlock says next.
Sherlock comes out from the bathroom after washing his teeth and doing a wash. He holds up a tube with emollient cream, so John can see the name on it.
John starts to giggle then, because the banter is too ridiculous.
“Let us know if you find something more interesting that we need to see,” John says with a questioning look at Sherlock.
“I’ve dreamt about this, your hands in my hair and caressing my back,” John whispers into his chest.
It’s so damned hard finding the right words, Sherlock sighs and looks for words that can explain his feelings.
John turns and looks at the man on the bed, eyes burning with tears. That was the last thing he ever expected to hear Sherlock say to him.
“How about talking with John one night on your journey, as I suggested before?”
Peter looks Sherlock straight in the eye and asks, “I have a question: how often do you stimulate yourself?”
“It's very good to get a confirmation that you love me. We’ve both struggled with using our words. Isn't that why we've had to work so hard at therapy?”
Sherlock waited for Harry and Miriam to leave before he again started to talk about the evening with Richard.
Like when John had become sick with influenza the second week after Dad had come home from Ireland the first time.
“Didn’t he react negatively to you changing what you called him?”
“Sorry for the mess, but it’s a bachelors home!”
The four man goes into battle with Father Holstii.
When he got his breath he sits up and puts his face in is hands feeling shameful over what just happened.
He didn’t get to the end of the explanation before attacking the tree as hard as he could. Anger running high in his veins.
He puts his hands on his face and sits down on the toilets seat.
Sherlock didn’t answer.
The only request he made was that Sherlock would tell him when he had a meeting planned with Richard.
With determination John answers his silent question.
“Yeah, some days you need the caffeine to get through the day.” The younger man smiles back at him.
He thinks to himself he must ask John where they should eat next morning.
“‘Thou shall not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together,’ 5 of Moses 22:11 in the Old Testament! Yet you’re standing in front of us in black linen trousers, white cotton shirt and white wool sweater!” Father cringes when he hears Sherlock’s words.
“Yes, obviously!” Sherlock sounds so offended. “You’re a very sexy man!”
“The more people to cook for the happier I am! Richard laughs.
The signal for a new message comes only a moment later.
For some time John is occupied with helping Rosie eat and drinking some coffee himself. He’s a bit surprised over how good both the food and coffee taste.
“I was thinking we could change clothes and lie in the double bed.
That´s why he hadn’t been prepared for violent dreams that night. He dreamt about his time in Serbia. Being in a cage in a freezing cold room with only pants on. He’d thought he would die that night of hypothermia.
“Go on!”
“He’s giving up on John. That’s what he’s doing. Enough is enough, even for Sherlock.”
Sherlock´s neck.
Maybe eating in the lounge would be easier with Rosie, instead of in their cramped compartment. Suddenly he hears a baby crying from next door.
Silently John is listening to the other man. Than the reaction comes without him thinking about what his about to say.
Harry and her new girlfriend had invited Rosie for a visit. Slowly the siblings had started building up a relationship again after the breakdown many years ago.
With a sigh Sherlock stops trying to not talk about the reason for choosing this model of car. In record speed he ratheles out.
“Yes, and Hamish was a very private person. I feel blessed that he let me know him as good as I did. But sometimes- “
John couldn’t meet Mike’s eyes for a week and they didn’t talk about it. Mike only talked about that night when mentioning meeting a girl.
“Oh, I thought you would stay with the Watsons as long as the renovations of the two flats were going on.”
Hastily he sits up and reaches after him, “Sherlock! Never ever ask me again if you’re good enough! You’re perfect.”
“So to summarize; Sherlock and Richard are on a date. They’re at a store selecting a film to see at home. A reporter or photographer from the paper Evening Standard sees them and takes photos of them. After visiting the store they stroll through Regents Park arm in arm having fun. Like thousands of people do on a date.”
“No.”
1965 April 2, Hamish and Jean Leekey wedding day.
“You said something just now but I wasn’t listening.”
That view gives John a really exciting reaction. Sherlock’s hand goes nearly around them both!
Secretly Sherlock was very pleased with his brother’s new relationship. Asking Greg to take care of his brother after the incident at Musgrave had been an ingenious move, though he’d kept up the preteens that he disliked the pair of them together.
“As soon as we can?”
“I haven’t thought about it really. We have only been dating for four weeks. It’s too early to say one way or another? He sounds onshore.
Silently he accepts John’s hand in his, and smiles back.
He reaches down and lifts the searching hand up.
“Alright.”
Together they try not to wake up Rosie and get under the two blankets. They’re both relieved when Rosie keeps on sleeping, sighing in her sleep and turning to John. Holding a steady grip on his shirt that he’s sleeping in.
“Of course I’m happy that you’re eating.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock glances up into John’s eyes with a bashful look.
John is shaking his head thinking if he really should tell Peter, then he decides to tell him before he changes his mind.
“No, but I like him and I want to see if it can work between us. It’s only our third date, and you’ve been a massive cockblocker! I don’t think he wants to go home and do the dirty after this evening.”
I love this story so much but is so afraid to messing it up.
With one glance at him, Sherlock had understood what he had been thinking about. “I know I've been rejecting your cuddles, John. That doesn’t mean I’ll do that once the case is solved.”
“--longing!”
Just then Sherlock looks up and sees them in the doorway.
“Do you feel the same now as after your experience with your first boyfriend? And does that feeling feel differently from with Wilkes?”
“I don’t know.”
“You said before that you’re demisexual? How come you think that’s your orientation?” Peter is trying to help him move along with the discussion.
Hurriedly he picks up the glasses of wine and goes to open their flat door.
“Do you have any contact with Janine now?”
But he didn’t know how Sherlock’s hands would feel like on his body!
Could he ask for something else that he really wanted?
How could this memory still hurt so much after so many years?
“So you didn’t love Mary in the end?”
“And then you stumble over me, a man who could be a representative of your family? You really didn’t want to meet me!”
“My head hurts thinking about it!” Sherlock lets go of his hand and slowly caresses his right cheek. Feeling the stubble under his fingers, an enjoyable shudder goes through Sherlock’s body.
In this story Sherlock is demisexual and has started to understand himself and how his sexuality works. I am demisexual myself and it has taken me a long time to understand and make it work. For a long time I thought that I was asexual but it didn’t feel right.
“I need the connection with my lover, to be able to let go in sex. My mind can’t be occupied with other things. Lazy days at home and something making my body react positively from stimulation, have made me take care of it myself nearly all my life.”
He’s thoughts are interrupted when he feels a long, warm and skillfully hand moving over his left shoulder, down to the nipple. Sherlock raises his hand and kisses his fingers one after the the other letting the tip of the fingers become wet, holding John’s eyes at the same time he’s wetting his long lovely fingers.
Then carried on explaining what he thought. “We decide what the rules are and what’s morally acceptable in our relationship. I promise you that whatever toy you use, it will never upset me. What will upset me is if you cheat with another person. It doesn’t matter if it’s a he, she or they!”
“The tea’s ready, do you want some biscuits?” Is the question that meets him when he enters the hallway.
“If they had been together from when they were teenagers, then hearing what Father Chaney thought about Ossian--must have been overwhelmingly hard to hear.” Sherlock shakes his head.
“The first left me when I was too clever and deduced that his father had embezzled money from his employer many years ago. Being afraid of being outed was an extra reason to drop our relationship, the reason he decided to use when he ended it.”
She is quiet for a moment before she says.
Steadily Sherlock holds the priest's eyes, maintaining eye contact.
“Sherlock! What! I need--the toilet”He rushes out to the toilet in the reception.
Seeing Sherlock high as a kite and knowing he been nearly killed by drug overdose, still trying to solve a case and flipping out at a suspect-
First his left hand starts searching, then when he’s located a torso, his body moves in search of contact.
“You know that Rosie’s with my sister? They’ll not bring her back until Sunday.” A bit impressed with his own boldness, John waits nervously on the answer.
A buzzing sound alerts him to John’s jacket and his mobile in the pocket.
Determinedly Sherlock stares at the people across the street, trying to calm his feelings of wanting to run away from this discussion.
Sherlock thinks the question over for some time. Peter remains quiet, waiting for him to answer.
“You see body parts that you can relate to a character in your mind that you like and love? But now seeing an image that can make those fictions more vivid?”
“Do we have the same experience? Have you lost parents or siblings when you came out?”
He wakes up and Rosie is screaming from the baby monitor. His breathing is hard and the orgasm is still rippling through his body.
“It’s funny that your sister is named Anna. I mean, Mary was our ancestor’s name on your father’s side, wasn’t she?”
“Yes, I’m trying to become an adult. With an adult’s responsibilities, both for my own sake and for yours and for Watson’s. After living alone for many years, it’s one of the things I’ve realized it’s important for me to learn.”
“Of course.” A soft moan interrupts the discussion.
Somehow it had been natural that John had talked with Monty, and Sherlock with Giles.
“You met my daughter?” Now John is staring at Sherlock with steel in his eyes that are so dark blue they look brown.
“Of course I don’t hate you! I love you! But I don’t want to start a relationship with you and lose you after three months or a year or after however long it takes you to leave. That’s something I can’t stand to even think about!”
This answer gives Peter a real shiver through his body. Poor man, if he only knew how valuable he is.
When John sees the car he whistles loudly and turns to look at his friend.
“Oh, she’ll becomes Queen Bee, of course!”
All through this Angelo is standing in the doorway looking at them with a fond smile and a champagne bottle in his hands.
“He’s said nothing, we are only dating, John. I don’t know how I feel about it either. How did you feel when you started dating Mary?”
Monty nods his agreement.
“Yeah, you’re right, it’s chilly.”
Sherlock grip on his hand gets a bit harder and he looks on John with sympathy in his eyes.
******************************
John snorts and replies quickly, “Yes, I mean so much to him, he kills himself before my eyes and doesn’t return until two years later as a waiter!”
Sherlock lifts himself up on his arms, afraid of getting the same reaction as earlier in the evening.
Sherlock sits down on his single bed and jumps up and down a bit.
“It isn’t, I was only thinking about a case Sherlock and I worked on, and he said to me ‘It’s never twins!’”
PTSD: the hardest topic of them all, both in relation to himself and what he now knew impacted John’s life.
Sherlock changes position and takes them both in hand.
……………………………………………………………………………
Richard goes to a table next to  Greg and Mike’s. John takes a chair and sits down beside Mike, not saying anything in response to Sherlock. Only glaring back at him when he goes to sit down besides Richard.
John explodes, angrily screaming.
John stands up and starts putting on his black jacket.
John isn’t happy about it but he says very quietly,“I will not see or talk to Sherlock and I won’t interfere in his new relationship.”
With a sigh John gives in and explains.
That evening was as romantic as John ever wished for, but never thought he would experience in real life. He had definitely never thought it would be with a male lover.
Silently Greg leaves the room. Sherlock stands there blinking, holding hard to John’s waist. Trying desperately to say anything.
“This is Mike and John, two old friends, and these are two co-workers of mine. Eve works as a policewoman and Maud is a secretary at my department.”
Tiredly Sherlock sinks down in the bed and the warmth of the blanket.
“I’m so sorry that I did that to you.”
“How did my behavior hurt you so much?”
Quickly Monty starts walking to the little group.
Peter realized that and at next session he took both of them on a walk to a nearby park. He exhorted John to hit some trees when they come to a secluded area of the park. Peter then instructed him to name why he wanted to do those hit the trees before doing it.
That was the start of John’s introduction to using toys.
“That is all the time we have today. Good luck with traveling and a solution to the Watson mystery.
Again Sherlock stops speaking. The room is so silent that if a pin dropped it would be too loud. Peter doesn’t say a word. He first looks for John’s reaction, then Sherlock’s.
“Yes, Sherlock and I had big problem last night to get her to sleep. It was good that we booked family tickets.”
That evening James had suggested beers instead of tea.
*******************************************************
When John arrives at the Two Broken Hearts, he sees Sherlock talking to a man.
“Can anyone control their feelings of desire?”
“How many siblings do you have?” John is intrigued with his new family relations.
“The priest at that time was looking for the Sexton in his little cottage that interrupts them in their--”
“Because you never think he will leave you when you start hitting him. You only feel betrayed over him leaving you or putting his life at risk doing stupid things that can end in him dying. I don’t say that it’s not understandable that you got angry, but hitting him isn’t acceptable!”
“Your fool! Why are you standing here when you have that man in the kitchen?” He is startled when he realizes he was talking out loud.
Sherlock didn’t know how to handle the situation. He couldn’t understand why John resented his suggestion so much, which made John even more upset.
It had been a surprise when he realized  that Greg and Mycroft were a couple! A big flower arrangement was waiting on the kitchen table when they came back from their visit to John’s family home a year ago.
You could leave me both by choice and by someone killing you. That’s the reason for my anger at the morgue: drugs. It was better to leave you by my own choice then to wait for it to happen for some reason.”
“Yes, or some other subject. It’s easier because you wouldn’t be able to scrutinize each other’s faces or body language.”
Nothing had changed his mind even after Sebastian Wilkes claimed that they did the dirty. Mycroft’s thought about that statement from Wilkes was that the man was ridiculous with his attempt to get endorsement into a profession in politics.
“I don’t think Richard would like this.” He whispers in Sherlock’s ear.
John looks at his lovely lover and feels a calm and happiness he hasn’t felt for a long time. His mind flows with the thought, “We did that together.”
At last he feels Sherlock's whole body on his back, a bulge between his hips just under his bollocks.
Then in the evenings after they left, the long nights had been so lonely. Feeling unsettled and having bad dreams nearly every time he tried to sleep.
“I like it when he touches my body when I’m fully clothed and when he is stroking my hair. He often plays with my hair and that feels really good.”
John stops moving his hands that now have glided very near the waistband of Sherlock’s pjs.
He gestures for Sherlock to lay down beside him.
“Please, John, don’t hurt him anymore. Move on. Be his friend.”
“Alright, I investigate how we can travel safely with a child. It’s time for you to leave if you don’t want to be late for work.”
“Alright, yes of course, I want to see your naked body too.” He looks pointedly at Sherlock.
“Alright, I hear what you’re saying. It’s something I need to think  about. In every relationship I been in-“
“Yes, of course.”
“She-“ He can’t find the words to explain what he mean, he tries again to answer Sherlock’s question.
Remembering the feelings and the joy of being loved makes Sherlock’s face so beautiful that Peter suddenly has difficulty breathing.
“John, don’t be so hard on yourself. You have been grieving.”
Now Peter intervene with a decisive reaction.
“Your grandfather was in the AMSC to?
Oh, don’t be afraid. He will never leave you and the children!
His head ends up on John’s chest. Sherlock sleeps on, sighing contentedly. John smiles, holding Sherlock lightly against himself.
John takes hold of his nearest hand and strokes it soothingly with his thumb.“He made it easier for you to stay clean by being there in the evenings?” His voice is calm and understanding, not even a hint of jealousy in the voice.
“Yes.”
He still can’t look into Sherlock's eyes. This is the biggest and most shameful secret he ever had. Or--is it his father’s rules making it shameful?
Soon Sherlock’s standing in front of him in only the black pants.
He seems so scared and small in the doorway. Peter goes to him at the door, talking with him in a calm, quiet voice. Peter turns and comes and stands before John.
John sees the look on his face, frightened and nervous. John almost expects him to stop talking and move away from the bed.
That was my legacy from my mother’s father, grandfather George. He was a teacher from a very conservative family.
Silently they starts walking in perfect harmony as they’ve done so
Yes, Sherlock had gotten it right, he’d panicked!
“I’ll call you back as soon as I know if he can or not.”
The whole day Sherlock thought about the last year and how different his and John’s life was now.
Thinking back on the times he’s been with male partners, it had nearly always been he who had been the instigator of everything that happened.
Well, if he was a Devil than I am much worse than he or any man or woman in this world.
A sound of something he couldn’t identify, but definitely also moans, interrupted his thought process again.
“I want to know. Your father’s abuse hurt you and your sister so much. Go on, John.” Sherlock’s voice is calm but it has a warmth to it.
“Then what happened? John is so bewildered.
“I need your help getting through all things that happened today. Both the meeting with Father Holstii and the letter but mostly my discussion with Monty.”
They had both worked on answering those questions in the following months.
John goes down and knocks on Mrs Hudson’s door.
…………………………………………………………………………………..
“Your favourite.” Sherlock is nodding in affirmation.
“When we met, he realizes pretty soon how hurt I was over everything that has happened between us.”
“Look at me! he moans to the man.
Yet another sip of water, and still the Father is very bothered.
“Do you want me take you on as a client?” Now Sherlock is very surprised.
The honeymoon period had gone fast and the months after had been hard. He had thought after a little more than a month that Sherlock wasn’t interested in him anymore, at least not sexually.
“Into battle!” Sherlock thinks  at the same time as Peter opens his office door and with a smile invites Sherlock in.
They end the conversation.
“I was angry at John. Treating me like a naughty schoolboy!” His voice is angry,  and to Peter it’s sounding like he still feels angry over the whole thing.
“I can’t pretend that it doesn’t hurt that you´re with Adam. But I am your commanding officer and can’t start any relationship in any form with you on this tour.”
Challenging sometimes. To understand each other’s points of view, and the baggage they both had from previous relationships, and how differently they experience things. Those things were mainly: sex.
“I’m  so sorry.”
“Yes, can he meet me?”
“Yeah, is it alright if I leave Rosie here for a moment and go out in the backyard. I need some air.”
“He then says, and I quote,*two men can be friends with each other when one of them is gay and the other is straight,* end quote.”
“My sexuality and–”  he takes a deep breath and says hesitantly. “Sex.”
John, Sherlock and Rosie have a lovely dinner.
Sherlock lets go of John.
I also wanted to write about how a demisexual person can experience sex and sexuality. Remember though that sexuality can feel different for different people, even if they see themselves as demisexual.
**********************************
John is thinking about his marriage, and how difficult it had been after Mary shot Sherlock. The emptiness and the scary nights with the thought of living that life until the day Rosie left home.
They stand there a long time, swaying slightly and holding on to each other.
“What did she do?”
“When I told Mr Watson what had happened he didn’t move and he didn’t say anything. He only looked straight ahead as if he didn’t hear me or see anything. I did try to talk to him and told him that *he was free now from the Devil in human form.* When I uttered those words he stood up and walked past me without saying a word. He didn’t look at me either, it was like I didn’t exist. That’s the last time I saw him. The next day his daughter came to me asking where her father was.”
He quickly brushes his teeth with bottled water without saying anything, only staring out of the window above the sink.
“When did you meet Hamish for the first time?
“The journalists asked if they were on a date. Sherlock said, yes!”
“Rosamund Watson, mostly called Rosie.” A very proud father answers before Sherlock can do anything to upset the friendly receptionist.
After a very long time John remembers that Sherlock obviously wanted something when he entered the flat and said those three important little words.
Even Rosie had been upset and more rebellious than John had ever seen her.
Sherlock holds the letter in his hand and the hand is trembling.
“Of course I was! You’re the love of my life.”
“I haven’t had a sexual partner for many years, John! Didn’t want to. Didn’t want to feel those feelings I’d felt with Seb Wilkes.”
“You named him Hamish?” Surprise is obvious in John’s voice.
John turns to Sherlock, “Do you think he can be a relative of mine?”
“I didn’t know you work on some weekends?”
“Was that the time you strolled around the flat with only a sheet around you?” He can’t stop looking at Sherlock, who  tries desperately not to look back.
“It’s good that you’ve realized that your jealousy is hurting both me and you. You’ve sometimes, in a very subtle way, controlled me, and I will not accept that any more. If that doesn’t change, I won’t get involved in anything more than friendship with you. A friendship with clear lines of what’s acceptable or not. If we start a relationship and you begin behave like that again I will leave you, no matter how much it will hurt me” —John tries to interrupt his monologue, but he holds up a hand in a signal to stop— “Yes, I know I also have things to work on when it comes to manipulation. A relationship goes both ways? At least that’s what Peter and Darin have explained and taught us at our many sessions. Maybe it’s time we talk with them about helping us to write down some rules about what each of us should do and things we shouldn’t do.”
“Not gay! How many times have we both heard him say that? You know, if it wasn’t so stupid it would be funny!”
Then he asked if Sherlock had any contact with Maud, the police secretary who worked with Greg at Scotland Yard.
John and Rosie comes in too the restaurant, he looks around for Sherlock. One member of the staff, that knows who he is and who’s his meeting nods to the next room.
“You’re right! Plenty of time later. In your message, you wanted to meet because you had questions?”
With little giggles and soft words they get John cleaned up.
He knows that Sherlock could close down at any minute, running away from the discussion.
It’s because he had been my lover. My new lover didn’t like that I still loved Hamish.
Peter stops to take a breath and give John a chance to say something.
Sherlock says something to Richard before he smoothly stands and goes over to John and Maud.“What are you two arguing about?”
Something about the topic of mental connection is nagging at John.
Agitated he stands up and moves to the window, looking out. Trying to get as far from Peter and his own feelings.
How can the man look so calm and collected? Irritated John gives the man in the other armchair a glare.
“No, but if we take the night train to Scotland it would be easier to travel with her. Baby’s like the feeling of moving and sleeps better in a car or stroller when it moves.”
“Did he have relationships with men or was it only in his mind?”
“This town is really old,” John says thoughtfully. “All the houses in this lane must be hundreds of years old at least.”
“Welcome! Nice to meet you Mr Holmes.”
Warning: this chapter talks about homophobia and suicide. Nothing specific. Abuse of a child by hitting.
“1981 in November Hamish was deployed a second time to the same place. Roger is there and they started to hook up again but Hamish didn’t love him. He said to me that it was like *scratching a itch*.”
“He’d been in a fight at the pub, I helped him get washed up and took care of him. I was five or maybe six at the time. After washing and getting some of the cuts bandaged, he put me on his knee and talked to me. It’s one of the few good memories I have of him.”
Suddenly John has problems breathing. “Breathe, John!” Monty encourages him.
“Do you want your sandwich?”
“How about you take your time and start with how you and Janine talked about the subject?”
Mycroft told him that John had asked for a secure psychiatrist before he started going to Peter.
“Yes.”
The look said, “Clever John!”
“Is that alright with you, John?” Sherlock asks John looking a bit nervous.
“Hey, sleepyhead, it’s time to change to a car instead.” Rosie starts protesting as soon as she wakes up.
“Yes, I know. We will take a day at time but I want you to know you don’t need to mollycoddling me for me to love you. It’s time for me to realize that I am a man in my forties, not a child!”
“Maud told me about the assassins that had the order to shoot Mrs Hudson, Greg and me that hateful day when you jumped?”
Then belittling him in front of John?
“I realized that you would never accept being a openly bisexual man. Irene told you she saw right through your bullshit about not being gay. Even then you couldn’t say, “yes I am.”
“I love you!” Comes over his lips the same moment his orgasm hits his body.
Tilda
Yesterday, he had even talked about his feelings for his commanding officer, James Sholto.
So Sherlock, being Sherlock, did what he thought would work, instead of talking with John!
With a sorrowful face John  presses out though stiff lips “I hurt Sherlock even more by saying those words on so many occasions, both before my marriage and after.”
“It’s a bit cold. Maybe if we slip under the blankets?”
“John, it’s alright. Dinner is already cooked and I would really want to know how the investigation is going.”
“Why are you smiling?” Sherlock, asks, sounding a bit frustrated.
“What? Monty asks.
A very interesting color on a pair of eyes, he thinks at the same time as he’s shaking the man’s hand.
“Sorry to interrupt, but it’s time to get Hamish and Rosie from my sister.” Giles does sound really contrite interrupting their discussion.
He’s a tall man, the same height as Sherlock and Giles. Around sixty years old, with salt and pepper hair and very black eyebrows.
*******************************************************
And so stupidly proud of snagging that beautiful man that night.
“Is that why you prefer to masturbate instead of having a partner?”
“Shhhh, little Bee, we’ll be on the road soon, so you can relax.” Quickly Sherlock strokes her cheek with his fingers. Rosie looks up at him with tears in her eyes and looks very upset.
John frowns at the message and thinks that’s a pub all sorts of people go to. Harry has told him that if she had to go to a straight pub she would choose this pub. He thought it was stupid of her to talk about a pub visit because of her sobriety problem. She has been sober for 14 months now and found a new woman to date a month ago. He was happy, but still a bit worried about her new relationship in case it didn’t work out.
His voice was a silky rumble of baritone. Sherlock remembers how shaky he had felt at that moment. Before that first meeting his other psychiatrist, Peter, hadn’t told him much about Darin.
John is very surprised over Sherlock’s car choice, a Mercedes E class I6!
“No, it isn’t funny but we can’t do much about it. They have to be the ones that work themselves out. We can only be here, supporting them both and praying that neither of them do something they both will regret.”
Only to realize he hurt John badly with that question.
“I said, our friendship is important to me and I will fight for it. I want our relationship to be healthy. Do you want to work on it together with your therapist Peter?”
All four men are sitting there, thinking and feeling with no thought about the world outside.
He sees in Sherlock’s face how hesitant he is to give an answer. After a short silence Sherlock starts to explain.
I could find some girls interesting and I really wanted to become a father. We decided that I should court and later marry Anna Buckels. Ossian has never found girls or women attractive.
Laughter, because he’s been so busy answering the question and moving his hands all over John’s body. Without hesitation or freaking himself out for being too keen.
************
“Because I was so ashamed of myself and even afraid. My therapist, Peter Morse, said I must organize both my brain and my living space and understand why I behave the way I do. When that is done I could think of moving back in with you.”
John has been reduced to a shaking mess, he can’t hear what Sherlock is saying. He is standing there screaming, inside himself.
Peter opens his office door.
The sessions after, both individually and in pairs, had been confusing, embarrassing and healing.
Sherlock ask when they stand on the pathway.
My safe words are:
“Yes.”
“How long time was Hamish at Sandhurst?
***********************
Alright, she’s a boring lawyer and mother, a typical John date.
After all he is trying to help both of these men who have so much difficulty talking about feelings. It will be hard for all three of them to get any results on this matter. How many years has John had therapy, with little result?
I’m wondering now, do either you or I have the right in God’s eyes to throw stones?
“Do you remember your bachelor night? For a moment I thought you would take my hand and pull me into your arms.” He says with a low voice.
Rosie is now very cautious about her daddy leaving her, and very determined that he shouldn’t do that.
Because that night with James he had lost a future that never began.
John moves so close to Sherlock’s back. His right hand goes to Sherlock’s heart and his left hand to his stomach, near the hole Mary’s bullet put there. His nose goes into Sherlock’s neck. He breathes in Sherlock’s scent.
Sherlock needed intimacy to flourish in a relationship, and to feel the need of touches and sex. John needed stability and sex or human touch, or at least contact with skin against skin.
When Richard and Rosie have left them to eat. John feels more ready to ask Sherlock some questions that he was afraid to ask when Richard was nearby.
“Yes! What about it? He didn’t want me to come with him!”
He pulls a little more on the pjs and marvels at the beautiful view.
Sherlock reaches out and kisses his forehead, sighing he takes John’s hand again.
Anna Steel, Hanna Bell and Violet Hammer--should I go on?
John had tried desperately to stop laughing.
It’s a bit easier now to retain eye contact with Peter. It’s still a nerve-racking subject to talk about, but at least his interactions with Janine have been told.
He’s about as tall as John, broad shoulders and blond hair. He thinks the man is about 35 years old. He snaps out of his inspection of the man and answers Greg’s questions.
John turns and goes into the other compartment and lifts Rosie from the bed into his arms. She had gone to sleep immediately after they returned from breakfast, tired after eating.
I thank my mother in heaven that she was so open minded and let me and my siblings know and have Alf and his partner Werner as babysitters, growing up.
Sorry for the long wait. Tilda
“I can make some bolognese sauce with pasta? All the ingredients are in the kitchen and it’s more than enough for all of us.”
John is sitting on the bed, looking at a phone message from Harry.
He needed time alone without Sherlock or Rosie around.
Rosie that was on her way to start protesting begins to squeal when she hears about the swings. John and Sherlock waves at them.
Sherlock looks down at the carpet, not wanting to have eye contact when he talks about what’s bothering him.
With feigned indifference he removes a hair from his left jacket arm.
John is collecting his thoughts inside a toilet cubicle. The only thing he wants to do is cry his heart out but he swallows down his feelings.
After all the open talk and big secrets revealed they both only want to lie there together.
“My name is Lisa Douglas, glad to meet you, Mr Holmes, and you too, Dr Watson.”
Richard had suggested that they could eat at the lunch restaurant not far away from his work. It was the architecture firm’s document with a building plan for a government building that had brought him to Sherlock.
The server appears with Sherlock’s breakfast and he gives up on trying to talk with the woman, only thinking of trying to eat something to not upset John more by not eating. He’ll be upset enough that someone thought they were on their way to be married.
Sighing, John flips onto his back, looking lazily through his eyelashes at Sherlock. Smiling softly, Sherlock starts cleaning John’s stomach.
“How do you feel about sharing a room?”
“No! He bites his lip before he decides to say something more.
“After the break Sherlock will do something that requires courage. You said before when you talked about his two years away that he was on an adventure?”
“How easily she forgets me.” John wrinkles his eyebrows and continues then to talk. “Richard is good with her.”
That had made John laugh, it was such a Sherlockian way of thinking.
John turns around and starts into the bathroom to check it out, answering softly, “Yes, a family room was what I wanted.”
…………………………………………………………………………………..
A very calm and collected voice asks him.
“But Richard-“
Nervously John looks at Sherlock, seeking support and asking for what to do with his eyes.
“As I told you yesterday we’ve interviewed my Father’s last lover Marcus. It was very hard for me personally to talk about my mother and her suicide.”
“John, I ha--”
“Safe words? Iiii- haven’t been in a sub/dom situation before!”
“My father was a closeted homosexual. He lived in fear all his life. I really can’t understand why he wrote down anything and left the diaries behind after his death.”
“I—” he swallows and starts again, “I have used some marijuana that Mrs Hudson had lying around about a month ago, just before I started dating Richard.”
Somebody is knocking on the door and Monty goes to open it.
Sherlock stands up and leans into John instead, “Did that wink mean you want a kiss?” He purrs.
“No, tea’s good. Had so much for dinner.”
“If it’s alright with you.”
After a year James became something more for John, but only a few weeks later James ended the *affair*.  “For a real boyfriend”, as James put it. James had understood that John didn’t want to do anything more adventure, some in the explicit part of their experience together, or go out openly on dates.
John has difficulty getting out the question burning on his tongue. “How do you know about that?” He feels like angst will take over his body, feels feverish, his stomach knotting up.
In a very Sherlockian way he had shown John how to use the dildo on him;  blushing furiously, John remembers his first experience with a fleshlight.
With a very low voice and not looking at the other men in the room John starts to tell them his Father’s history.
“Whatever you want, sweetheart. Is it the thing you've been curious about for a long time? Would you like to top or--”
John had immediately started to protest, “it is immoral--”
He follows Nate to the librarian’s desk to get the book.
Anger over his father’s ghost, that still made him stay in the closet.
Rosie is lifting her head, looking at Sherlock in the dark before lying down again.
……………………………………………………………………………..
For months Father tried to change John’s mind and make him move back home. The only thing that kept that from happening was John’s eagerness to study at all hours of the day.
That was the last straw that nearly broke John, and the thoughts of suicide started to come daily. Who knows what would have happened if he hadn’t stumbled on Mike Stamford. Meeting Sherlock-
Sherlock’s wooing started there on the sofa with the phone call. In front of John he had told Angelo that he wanted to take his date on their real first date at the restaurant. He ordered a table set with tablecloth, candles and a bouquet of roses.
“What happened at your stag party? You were trying to get us drunk and--then what?”
After some time, when no reaction has come from Peter in any way, shape, or form, he starts talking again with his back to Peter, making it possible for him to tell the story.
“But sweetheart, both your daddy and I are here and it’s late in the evening. Little girls and boys, like you, should be asleep this time in the evening.” Sherlock sits down on the bed with his back to the wall, cradling Rosie in his arms. Rosie is still crying, but a with considerably lower volume. Just letting them know she isn’t happy.
First Richard had wanted to leave directly after saying those words, but Sherlock had insisted that they talk. They had argued and really had it out, Richard shouting his anger and frustration.
“Yes, I want you to know that I had a breakdown yesterday. I called Peter after I so the paper on my way to work. He kindly gave me a time in the afternoon.”
“It’s okay for you if we share such a room?
Sherlock lets the psychiatrist’s words sink in for a moment, then asks,
"How would you feel if one day Alex showed up with a stupid moustache and just said 'Tada!', spread his arms and gave you a goofy smile?"
When John returns he has a tray with tea and sandwiches with him.
Sherlock hadn’t thought much about it. When John was in the shower he was on duty for taking care of Rosie.
“Careful, Richard can hear you.” Chides John, glancing through the leaves of the ivy at Richard.
“Next question was if Sherlock was gay!” John yells.
A little embarrassed, his face colors when he thinks of those products.
“We recognize each other in our similarities. I’m usually a very private person, but he’s one of few people I think of as a friend.”
Sighing, John stops pretending to work and gets ready to leave the clinic.
Sherlock lifts one eyebrow at that.
Your righteousness gives you the right to condemn a love that lasted from the time Ossian was sixteen and I seventeen years old? I have never been with another man than Ossian and he hasn’t been with another man than me!
The problem is that Hamish can’t forget the love of his life J.H.
With a grown he hears Sherlock say, “Sorry, didn’t mean to-“
Sherlock is a bit surprised over this shift in the interaction, he thought that they would be kissing right now. Sighing, he realizes that John needs this right now, him holding John and caressing him calmly.
Falling down on the bed, laughing and looking into each other's eyes, Sherlock asks, “Can we try this?”
Started reading it because I had read another fic by this author that was so lovely.
John leaves with a spring in his steps. Feeling more happy than his been in a long time.
The man was so right: who was living his life? Him, or all other people in the world?
He feels all warm inside just from looking at him.
Sherlock waits for John to talk. It’s his story to tell.
“No, he’s afraid of himself. He knows he wouldn’t stop you if you tried to hit him again. John, you’re not in a healthy relationship! Even if it’s an *only friendship* relationship, as you said last time.”
“My anger came from the same place as my father’s. Frightened to accept my true self. We were both hurt as children and teenagers for the same reason. Homophobia.”
He takes more cream and starts massaging both sides of the spine. It takes only seconds for Sherlock to start moving, following John’s moving hands.
“Sherlock, can I ask for something? Something I want to do in bed tonight?” John is nervous but if he has read Sherlock’s signals right this evening he thinks the man wouldn’t be against making love.
Greg and Mike wanted Sherlock to come with them on a pub night. Sherlock was afraid that left himself he would do something wrong socially, so could John come with him?
John gets hold of Sherlock’s dressing gown sash and pulls.
To the relief of both John and Sherlock it seemed like Molly now really loved Ian.
“I didn’t know children could make so much noise when they sleep.” Sherlock's voice sounds thoughtful.
“Because without you I would be much more hurt and maybe do something stupid!”
The only thing I need is your love.
Monty takes over the reading when they come to the news of Ossian’s suicide: “I stood at the door to the church bidding farewell to the evening’s parishioners. A telegraph boy came running up to church. “Father Chaney! It’s a telegram for you, it was sent urgently!”
“How long is it before we’re in Buckie?” John asks from behind him.
“I have one more question.” Sherlock looks at him questioningly but responds with a, “Go on!”
He is silent for a second before he decide how to proceed.
“Time to go to bed?” He asks and John nods silently.
Sherlock collects himself and answers with irritation and frustration in his voice.
“Good, she needs some older people in her life. Maybe you can tell Rosie about her grandfather when she gets older?
“Yep! You’re insufferable when you’re hungry, or tired or sexually unsatisfied.”

“Yes, you’re right. She’s always thought we were together, hasn’t she?”
Thousands of thoughts flow through his brain. Should he leave and give John the chance to chat her up? Maybe get her phone number?
“So if you dream about the cashier at Tesco in a sexual way and get a *happy ending*, you think you done something bad? When you looking on a porn movie, do you think everyone of the actors are singles? Hastily John turn around and looks at him. Glaring at him.
Satisfied John puts his head back on the pillow, glancing after the other man’s backside. “What a lovely arse that is!” he thinks before shutting his eyes.
“I can understand that. I felt the same way when we had our interaction with your sister. Knowing how you feel about being cuddled I didn’t know how to support you? At Sherrinford you were badly emotional hurt and the only thing I wanted was to hold you close and hug you, sorry.”
Rosie doesn’t notice that her daddy is leaving. She’s tired and safe where she is.
Maybe he should treat himself to a full English breakfast?
“The hotel looks very comfortable so far, and the restaurant? Do we need to book a table for this evening?”
Thank you for beta reading Silver. This chapter wouldn’t be posted without your support. Tilda
“How would I know if you or anyone else’s have touched anything if it wouldn’t be for the dust? Hmmm!
With a sigh Sherlock nods, biting his bottom lip. John is on a roll with deductions of his own now. “That happened when you had slept for at least 15 hours after a successful case or you knew I wouldn’t be in the flat for hours?”
“I have the same feeling and he was my Father!”
*******************
“I was just afraid that I had hurt you again in some way.”
John stars to chuckle, “I think that’s a family trait, Rosie can be a handful too!”
Marcus sits down at the other corner of the sofa, half way between the two men.
But he’s thinking about the old quotation about a scorned woman.
“Yes, but I wanted much more! More than a hand on my back or seeing you in a bathrobe at eight in the morning, with Rosie at the table!”
He smiles a nearly true smile but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
Toys had been Sherlock’s choice of sex life for so many years. He couldn’t understand why John believed it was a way of cheating.
“Yes?” It’s a question in that one word.
When John heard the news of James’ misfortune, he tried desperately to contact him. Nothing worked. No answer for weeks!
“Welcome to Cullen Bay Hotel. What a cute little one you have there, what’s her name?”
Sherlock looks at the other man, really trying to see if Darin isn’t telling him everything he thinks. Darin meet his stare calmly and with a smile.
“Yes, I read that he abandoned Sarah and his wife when he left Buckie,” Sherlock agrees.
“Yeah, that was a bit awkward, wasn’t it?” They look at each other and start to laugh. Sherlock gets out after a moment, “It’s not good, getting into a particular *state* with a child at the table!”
“It’s the reason why we’re here, getting to know the history.”
Richard had made him watch the film last night. It was good to have company again. Sherlock thought that Richard was quite good company in small doses. “He talks a bit too much, he doesn't like to sit silent without saying a word now and then. No, he isn’t like John--”
“Every evening before I went out we ate dinner and she kept telling me how she would be there in the morning to see that I hadn’t been taking too many drugs. I didn’t want her to leave and make it impossible to get to Magnussen, if I needed that solution.”
He is looking at the birth certificate.
A question appears in Sherlock’s brain that he must ask.
The funny thing was now when he thought back how frightened he’d been about talking about Serbia, when the real problem was his childhood and university years. His mad family and family life. Finding and losing Scott, and not the least Sebastian Wilkes’ abuse of him.
“Yes, he loves children. He’s already told me he wants to adopt or maybe try surrogate method to become a father.” Sherlock’s voices is calm and collected. He makes it sounds like that issue hasn’t got anything to do with him.
John's eyes start with his nipples that are fully erect and begging for kisses. Without thinking John’s tongue slips out and wet his lips.
“Do you like bottoming?” The words from John are startling for both of them. John is very surprised at himself. A little embarrassed Sherlock answers, “With the right partner or the right toy?”
He then puts his fingers back to John’s left nipple, the long finger circle as near as he can the nipple two times before he shimmies over it with his thumb. John can’t understand that’s his body is reacting with a hot waves.
A fucking love letter!
John sinks into silence and Sherlock only holds his hand and slowly caresses it with his thumb.
“I will go and get us a table, see you two later.” He gives Rosie a kiss on her forehead. At the same time a waitress comes with two plates with food to Rosie and Richard.
“Hello, you´re looking miserable today, what´s up?” Darin ask with a calm voice, searching with his eyes all over his client for clues to what´s the problem.
1966 late January Hamish Watson deployment starts in Dahfor.
*******************
Not even Mycroft knew anything about it, even if he had tried many times to get that information. A satisfied smile appears on Sherlock’s face. He has truly fooled his big brother.
“Stop calling the children frogs!” Monty grumbles.
“I’ve loved every second of it, I think this is the most we’ve ever talked about feelings and how we feel about each other. Thank you for letting me in.”
Sherlock takes then hold on his own dressing gowns sashes and pulls the gown open. He shrugs out of the gown, the gown falls to the floor. Just like that he’s standing before John naked.
After a while he pulls John to the bathroom.
“Did it hurt you that he thought you were asexual?”
“I will be there half past six, thank you.”
John seems to have something to say, but doesn’t know how. After a moment he finally finds the words.
The man had looked at him and with an exhalation said, “I see, you can’t give up on John?”
“He—it was easier to think of other things than how my skin was crawling and my mind racing.”
“Can we sit down on the couch?” John asks before very slowly pulling away. He takes Sherlock's hand and pulls him to the couch. They sit down, Sherlock on John’s right.
In that state of mind of worry and sorrow he was sent on a mission and got shot himself. He’d often wondered if it wouldn’t have happened, if he’d been in his right mind.
That made John stop and think why he was putting such energy into hating a retold memory.  When he said that out loud Peter answered him with a low-voiced
“Yes, it must have been dramatic when Harry come out as lesbian.” Sherlock makes eye contact with Greg when he says that.
“He was trying to tell me that he will fight for our friendship. He wants us to go to therapy together. Maybe you would take us on?”
A sequel comes from Rosie when she sees Sherlock in the kitchen. She is sitting on the floor in the living room banging with a wooden spoon at a saucepan.
He pulls on Sherlock’s neck so he nearly falls down on his body, halfway on and halfway on the bed. It’s a very good place for John to move against Sherlock’s leg.
“Why?” He can’t understand why Peter isn’t upset over what his done.
In a strong voice, only slightly trembling, he responded, “It would be an honour to hold your hand, love.”
“I couldn’t let her touch me after what she did,  she was tired. Nine months pregnant and later a new baby to take care of. But she screamed the house down the first time I tried something in the shower when I had returned home.”
“To us! Hope our love will be for the rest of our lives.” Sherlock looks deep into John’s eyes before clinking their glasses together.
When Sherlock stops reading everyone in the room keeps silent.
When the bathroom was clean, it was time to put the week’s used towels in the washer and then take a short break for a sandwich.
Sherlock nearly falls down on the sofa. His eyes are so big and gray in color, like wolf eyes.
The room was empty.
She was happy because the pancakes are very good and Richard is making faces and laughing with her.
That evening Peter starts off by sitting quietly and deducing John for a minute.
Not to forget the romantic gesture that seemed to come naturally for Sherlock when it related to one John Hamish Watson.
Again John had tried to read the first chapter in the book.
“Yeah.” The only word comes out in an exhale, like a long awaited question being answered. Sherlock stands up and explains, “I’ll just get some lotion, be back in a moment.”
John gets up from the chair and walks around the room breathing hard.
“You mean that we’ll never be together as a couple?”
They take a sip of the wine, looking into each other’s eyes.
“It’s me moving this along a bit. I know that you’re not used to this. Do you want safe words?” Sherlock is absolutely still above him.
[See you there when Watson decides to wake up.] sent 09.42
“No idea. I have never seen him before.” Mike looks at Sherlock and the man with a sour look on his face.
“How did you feel when Sebastian touched you?”
John had become frustrated and after realizing that the man wouldn’t appear that evening, he had changed from drinking beer to whiskey.
“Yeah. I had time to think. My internalized homophobia got to me. I was going to marry a woman. Nobody needed to know how a dreadful man I was. Decision was made and every feeling put in place with labels put on every feeling. Sherlock Holmes- Best Friend. Full. Stop.”
“And a little bit more.” John tries to get his hand free from Sherlock’s grip, but Sherlock holds on tightly.
“Did you hear?” A rumbling comes from the bed. “Daddy wants to eat breakfast in the lounge, what do you think?”
“I thought he was asexual and married to his work?”
“Sweetheart, you’re so hard for me. Do you have any lube?
Sherlock shuffles his feet and makes a glance at John.
At last John and Monty gets to know what the scandal was about.
“Do you remember what happened shortly before your mother died, John?
Can you say the same about yourself? Behaving like you do, with young girls who are nearly children? Will you condemn yourself, Father, or will you wait until your Last Judgement Day?
“I could be friends with him if he accepted that I would never again hide that I’m gay.”
John realizes for the first time that Sherlock really has a sexual history. A history that takes his breath away, why is this making him so jealous?
His first real male partner. The jealousy he’d felt over James when he left him for another man.
The only one who was grumpy over the whole thing was, surprisingly, Sherlock.
Both John and Sherlock are both blushing but at the same time it feels really good that Angelo is happy for their sake.
That was the beginning of an event that happened every week after that. Seven weeks of gruelling therapy both alone and in pair with Sherlock. The only difference now was that Sherlock was also doing the same thing: letting out his frustration and letting John know what was bothering him.
Later at Baker Street, John puts down a sleeping Rosie on Sherlock’s bed. After eating pancakes and playing with Richard at the swings she fell asleep in the cab on their way to Baker Street. She looks so little, lying in the middle of Sherlock’s big bed. He pulls up the duvet over her and caresses her cheeks. She sighs in her sleep contentedly but doesn’t wake up.
“Of course, their coffee is also not bad.”
Monty starts laughing, and nudges John’s shoulder.
“I liked John from the first time we met, but I didn’t want another experience like Sebastian.” In visible frustration he pulls his fingers through his hair, sighs deeply and explains.
“Nice to meet you too.” They shake hands and Peter shows him into his office.
“Why are you more willing to show affection this evening?”
Sherlock doesn’t look at John, he looks down on the floor before his feet.
“My grandmother’s name on my mother’s side was Anna. My mother hated the name Mary. When my Father started to court her, he had also his eye on a girl named Mary. My mother couldn’t forgive either him or her for that!” Monty shakes his head again.
“Hold your horses, why this car?”
Even Mycroft had said a month ago that their partners were planning something. He asked his little brother what it could be.
The first two months of that therapy had been gruelling. At that time he had lived alone, the Watsons with him in the daytime, John helping him renovate the flat.
A sting of sympathy goes through his body even if he knows that this man has hurt his daughter and son badly.
He didn’t really have any family members left who were important for him in his regular life.
“Yes, Captain!” The answer comes from lips burrowed into his neck.
“Yes! His response is an exclamation. Then he rapidly explains.
He really hopes, but he’s pretty sure that’s the case, that John is content too.
“John, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it as a sub/dom situation. It was for your protection. This is new to you and with your experience with internalized homophobia it could be a good thing to use.”
Writing love notes to each other?
“Yes, it will be a hard thing to do. But you are too valuable for me not to fight for it.”
Peter looks up on him and smiles reassuringly.
“I have a question? Can we as friends talk about it?” Hesitation is obvious in Sherlock’s voice.
John looks at the time of the watch. Where have the time gone?
“I have been searching for your grandfather’s and great grandfather’s history. Did you know that your great grandfather, Hamish Montgomery Watson, was born in Buckie? And that the family were parishioners in the Catholic Church St. Gregory at Preshome near Buckie?
John looks at Sherlock and asks him. “What do you think about dinner at seven?”
Sherlock moves his hand steadily over John’s whole erection with the moves he usually uses on himself.
1967 November,  Harry is conceived.
Clever John! is Sherlock’s first reaction.
“We have some things to deal with the coming months, haven’t we?”
“No, don’t stop, it’s only that I’m very sensitive  just above my buttocks. An erogenous zone, on the ridge where the spine ends. If you touch that place I might moan or move, or something like that. I didn’t want to startle you by just reacting to your touch.” His voice is again a little uncertain.
“It’s about two and a half hours, by car. We should be in Buckie around one in the afternoon.”
“The first ten years that we were together he mostly drunk at weekends. Yes, he could be drunk from Friday evening to Monday morning but he didn’t drink on a work day.”
The local John nods at Sherlock and starts to speak.
Trying to get a firm answer, Sherlock prompts the man, “He said he would be in today?”
“Do you get therapy alone too?”
Sherlock had looked so horrified and quickly tried to explain himself.
The second week had started with Christmas day at Monday. They decided to stay at the Watsons’, and invite Molly and her boyfriend Ian.
Father Holstii just shook their hands goodbye without a word.
Richard hadn’t pushed the subject but asked about his journey to Scotland. At the same time he didn’t really eat, only taking small bites and looking intensely at Sherlock’s face. As if he was trying to see if his expression would tell him something Sherlock’s words didn’t.
“Tea!” John says to really get Sherlock’s attention.
“Yes, and take care of your daughter.”
“No one cares, John. All the pedestrians on the street are on their way home or to a restaurant,” Sherlock whispered and smiled at him.
“What do you know?” His voice is very low when John asks the question.
I also want to thank Shiplocks-of-love that read through this chapter and made me realize that the reader doesn’t live in my head and need background information.
They started to mail each other, at least a couple of mails each week.
“Goodnight, sweetheart.”
This is one of the changes in their relationship that happened over their year together. Sometimes Sherlock took care of John’s needs of food and relaxation.
That evening after Rosie was put to bed and they were sitting on the couch talking about the case. John felt restless and uncertain if he should try to touch Sherlock or if the other man would reject him again.
“You knew how I would react?”
The silence that follows after the question is like a wet blanket.
Sherlock tries not to look at them, but feels a sting in his heart that he can’t do the same as Giles, hugging the man he loves most in the world.
“We’ve both grown up quite a bit. We’ve both been willing to go to therapy. We know so much more about each other and we’ve realized how easy it is to lose each other, don’t you think?”
All for sex when he wanted to?
“Yes, of course it is, John.”
“I want you to see for yourself how much *fun* Sherlock had on his adventure.”
“Your old house will stand where it is for a later time, John. Let’s go home.”
“Those big hands of Sherlock moving so gently over the man’s body, how would it feel to be that man he’s caressing?” A shiver goes through John’s body at that thought. A longing blossoming in his heart and mind. What wouldn’t he have done for it to be him in Sherlock’s arms?
“If you get a good price for the flats then you could maybe buy a more central apartment? If I have understood you correctly Mary had bought the flat and you inherited it from her?”
After some time had James started to send e-mails again, but he didn’t want to meet up in real life.
“I don’t know. Do you know, Mike?”
With a carefree laugh Sherlock takes his hand and pulls him up the stairs and into his bedroom. Still holding John’s hand, he turns on the bedside lamp that gives the room a soft light.
A smile that’s so soft appear on Sherlock’s face, his eyes are blown wide with big black pupils so John can’t see which color they have besides the black pupils. Holding John’s eyes and caressing the now shirtless shoulders and arms.
The problem is, John wants more! He rolls over and comes very close to being out of bed, pulling Sherlock with and over himself.
When he said that, something clicked for John.
Frustrated, he drops Sherlock’s hand and his tight fists hit his thighs in agitation.
John’s mind jumps between different subjects, such as sexuality and how different it could be for different people. Feeling sad for his--father? Dad? Then a thought hits him, how different would John and Harry’s childhood had been if their father had accepted himself?
“London!” He hears John gasping out and pulling him down.
They lie in silence, both letting their minds wander.
Determined, Sherlock resumes speaking.
Sherlock takes out his phone and calls to reserve.
After walking to the Watson Merivale home they make the children a light snack. While John feeds and talk calmly to Rosie, Hamish asks many questions about his daddy’s visit to the church. Even at age five he had realized this morning how nervous both his parents were before going there.
“You’re a stunning man!”
“Yes, thank you.”
James was happy and in love with his new boyfriend and soon moved out of the flat.
Blushing and not meeting his eyes again, he replies, “Yes, specially the first time. I haven’t had a orgasm for years.”
“I´ve not felt comfortable in that house where Mary lived with John. Had the feeling of being a intruder in her place even if she´s dead.”
Just above the left kidney his fingers find a deeper scar that makes him worry whether Sherlock has any lasting problems with that kidney. Softly he glides his fingers over the scar.
*********************************
It’s like a mantra in his head in Peter Morse’s voice.
Thoughtful, Sherlock responds with a question.
“Yes, because if I think about my grandparents the thoughts of my mum is inevitably there!” both Sherlock and Peter hears the sorrow and anger in his voice.
Getting answers from Sherlock about this episode in John’s life could be important for later sessions with John.
“I know it’s hard to break now, but the time is up and I think you need some rest.”
“You say that, in the morgue, was that the reason you hit me?”
1968 July Hamish leaves on second deployment.
“Oh, you like that.” Sherlock’s whispers with a chocolatey voice.
At last John is sighing and putting down the pen and paper, rising from the armchair and walking over to Sherlock.
Soon they’re both breathless again, John pumping with his thighs to give Sherlock as much pleasure he can.
“That’s fine, take the time you need to tell me what’s bothering you.”
“Excuse me, I will be right back! He stumbles up on his feets and goes out of the room.
“Oh, you want to run?” Sherlock asks at the same time John turns around and starts running, yelling back, “See you at home, old man!”
“You think Thomas and Hamish will try to deny its existence?” Monty’s face expresses his unsettled feelings.
“Alright, we’re almost at the Fort William station.”
“It’s practically with the room being childproof and having a cot. Then it can be some more beds than two for grown ups in a family room. You can check how many beds there are before deciding to book the room?”
“Now I know that your mother's parents lived with you when you were a child and your paternal grandfather lived nearby, in his own house."
Sherlock’s day had been an active one, running around and making everything ready for the evening.
“If I could meet Marcus, your father’s last lover?” He meets John’s eyes when he asks the question.
“My parents had married the day after Hamish turned eighteen. As I told you before my mother was expecting a child, a boy that died only a week after he was born.”
Peter understands his mistake when he hears what Sherlock asks him. Alright, here we go, hope he will make a good decision for himself.
“We have so much to work on before that even becomes a problem. You’re right.”
“Yes, I had a student following me today. The question she had were endlessly!
Darin Wilkinson, his new psychiatrist, was kind but very direct, not taking any bullshit from Sherlock. His first meeting with the man had been a strange and at the same time a thrilling event.
His friend had given him a puzzled look. Like he couldn’t decide if Sherlock really meant it or—
“Why did you have a breakdown? I didn’t tell the reporter anything about you more than we’re friends?”
He talks with his most posh and upper class voice and wording.
“Right! Richard isn’t the problem!
faith, Father. You’ve told us your position in this matter and we’ve been clear about our standpoint. I don’t think any of us will change our minds, do you?” Silently Father and Sherlock look at each other, neither of them willing to lose the battle.
“Let me know when you want me to stop.”
1969 December 3 ,Hamish’s good “friend” J.H dies on a mission.
It had also made their sex life more active than John had ever thought it would be in the beginning.
The four men shake their heads and one or more swear words are heard from John and Monty especially.
******************************************************
Marcus eyes tears up when he answers John’s question.
“It’s against the Lord God’s Law!” Father shouts, rising from the armchair. When he takes two steps towards Sherlock, John quietly stands up and moves a step in front of his friend.
It’s so good! The right amount of suction and big hands gripping his butt cheeks at the same time, caressing them. He wants to see the face of the man.
“Yes, but at that time you guys hadn’t told each other about you being gay and him bisexual, right?”
“You said before at the session with Peter that you couldn’t find the reason that he left his family.”
“I don’t know when he left Buckie, but Sherlock,” he points at the man behind him, “has come to the conclusion that Hamish Montgomery Watson is my great-grandfather and he was born in Buckie--when, Sherlock?”
I've been searching for a long time for more adult stories to read.
An image comes into his mind, James Allan.
John and Monty took care of Hamish, Rosie, and the dog Dolly.
“You seems to be a bit irritated? calmly Peter looks back at him.
Sherlock had explained that he loved to bottom but he needed to really feel secure with his partner. He had also thought that John needed more time experimenting with anal play and maybe toys before being thrown into the deep end.
He nods to the face in the mirror and leaves the bathroom.
He turns and says to Sherlock,“Please, I’m so sorry that you have to do this but it’s the only way for John to fully understand what you had to go through.”
“Yes, John told me about his meeting with her in your flat. How did she influence you to learn about demisexuality?”
“Hello, sleeping prince.” Sherlock is totally smitten with this relaxed and happy man in his bed. “I’ll wash you before you get glued to the sheets or my skin.”
The little girl yawns and her eyes close. She falls asleep and doesn’t care what Sherlock and daddy are talking about, only that they’re here and that she’s safe in these strong arms, holding her.
“Yes, why’s that so funny?
“Well, Richard and I had decided to meet for lunch that day. So the three of us had lunch instead of only us.”
She immediately wakes up and starts to protest, yelling harder and harder with every second that passes.
“It feels so good!
“NO!”
1999                late that year, Marcus ends their sexual relationship.
Sherlock was laying on the bed naked and playing with a sex toy!
“Janine said after, when we talked after the debacle with Magnussen, that she wanted to see John’s reaction.”
“I’m sorry for that, but I couldn’t risk your life!”
“That’s not the same thing and you know it isn’t! I don’t know them or have feelings for them. They’re only a mastrubation material! I haven’t-“
Normally he doesn’t like to sleep in bunk beds, but this time there won’t be anyone sleeping above him.
“Yeah, not even masturbating in the shower. Mary got very upset if I did that after I moved back after Christmas.
The question is, how do partners handle different life experiences and biological / erotic differences? How do you accept that you might have to do things in a different way than you’ve done before?
John would like a good bath after a long day at the clinic, and if Sherlock then had an idea what they could do after the bath-- well, that thought had to wait until later.
“Your Father was a soldier?” He looks up with a questioning look at John.
“He wanted to hurt both Hamish and his wife in any way possible. Jean Leekey Watson was a good woman and Hamish did like her. He never wanted to hurt her. Time and time again he talked about it to me about how bad he felt over what happened. Hamish thought they would had been good friends if he hadn’t been forced to marry her. He really felt guilty for deceiving her into having sexual relationship with him. Then when she got pregnant they were both forced into marriage even though he knew that he didn’t love her the way he should.”
“Good, so maybe it’s best we have that discussion in the morning when we’re both sober?”
1982 3 November   Jean Leekey Watson is found dead in the bedroom.
“Oh, you haven’t met Richard? He came to me with a case about lost documents.”
Yes, it had been a bit amusing to find and order different pants, more revealing each week. Dreaming at night how John would react in the changing room.
“Poor Hamish, he’ll change his name if he ever reads the letter!” Monty starts to laugh; it’s a ridiculous thought that his brothers would ever accept the truth.
“Nothing specific, but Hamish said one time very drunk that your great grandfather was in a scandal. *you must do everything to not make a scandal, the family can’t take one more!* that’s what he said that night. We were arguing about us moving in together and I pushed for him to come out.”
When they talked later about how Sherlock had asked for Darin’s help, John had again been horrified.
When John doesn’t give a answer, and after a moment's waiting Sherlock says.
Mary Anna died 1 January 1901, and Watson remarried Mary McKerrow the same year.
The more the priest talks the angrier and louder he speaks.
“Oh!” John jerks awake at the same time as he ejakulates. He groans into the pillow.
Sherlock is thinking about his last discussion with Richard.
“Are we arguing about if we should have sex or not? Really?” Frustration is obvious in John’s voice.
“You’re horny?”
Sherlock took John to the Watsons’ home after that session.
John stares at Peter, his mind in a jumble. Sherlock hadn’t outed him. He had said to the reporter that he was straight.
He starts laughing, a high-pitched laughter.
“I was a Catholic who knew how conservative my family was. I didn't need an extra family member telling me how badly I lived my life. Only a month before that photo assignment, I had met Giles. We often had some Military Police escorting us, in specially bad regions when photographing. Giles had become the MP chief of our little group. I’d just realized that I loved him, me, the guy that never said no to a lovely woman and sometimes a guy.”
“She must have many things to go through in her mind after a very active day. Playing with Richard, he’s so natural with her. It’s obvious that he loves children.”
They kiss like there were no tomorrow. John is surprised over how sweet and hungry Sherlock kisses feels. Electric. Like the man himself, determine and curiosity in every kiss he’s giving. Sherlock is laying half over John’s body so that he feels a very hard cook against his right side leg.
Sherlock reaches down and dots light kisses all over John’s neck and shoulders, making John moan even more.
“If he hadn’t done that, Mrs Hudson, Lestrade and you would have been killed by three assassins. You and the other two would have been killed there and then.”
But this is a new situation, smearing the cream all over Sherlock’s skin. “Is this alright, not too light a touch?” He asks in a low voice. Sherlock promptly answers, “Honey!”
“John, I know it’s hard for you. I know!”  His voice is emphatic, he then sighs and tries to collect himself. He says with a low voice.
“I have Friday and Monday free because I’ll be working Saturday next weekend.”
But I want you to know that you will never be the woman he loves because you’re a woman. Someday a new man will cross his pathway, for a night, for some days or maybe for a longer relationship.
“Yes.”
John leaves Monty and Hamish alone and goes to put the kettle on.
“How’s it going with the little Madam?” Sherlock doesn’t notice at first that he’s returned. John realizes that is in his mind palace.
“How’s that going?” again Sherlock seems reluctant to answer the question looking at his hands on his knees instead. John decides to talk and try to help Sherlock and answers.
“Are you clean now?” The direct question takes Sherlock by surprise.
“Was it the meeting with Monty that started this line of thought?”
Sherlock slowly closes the phone case after talking with Richard. The man had sounded so happy, hearing from him. Richard had pelted him with questions how the ride had been.
Sherlock hears the telltale changein his lover’s breathing, and sees how John closes his eyes when chasing his release.
John starts to cry, his voice wobbling.
Sherlock smile broadly at John and with humor in his voice answers.
So many feelings had swirled around in John’s head.
John shakes his head and smile; he can’t understand that he missed seeing how caring his friend could be. Today he and some of the builders had set up a new ventilation system. For over six weeks Baker Street had been occupied by three blowing machines to extract the mould and damp from the rooms. Two of the blasted things in John’s flat and one in Mrs H bedroom had made it impossible for Mrs H and Sherlock to live in the house.
Sherlock remains silent,  searching for validation in John’s eyes. That it’s alright for him to talk about what’s his feelings is before he hesitantly starts to speak.
He hurries out to the bathroom and his well-stocked cabinet.
When the last word is said neither Sherlock or John knows what to say next. The silence stretches out in the compartment.
The little boy’s room has a second bed because of frequent visits from his cousins, on both on Monty’s and Giles’ sides of the family.
The hardest thing for John to accept was that Darin was right: he did need stability to feel safe.
J.H that died 3 of December 1969!
2003 2 Feb.     Eric moves in with Marcus.
“Get help from other people.” Monty lets the reply linger in the air before ending his line of thought.
Sherlock sits down in his armchair and takes a sip of his tea, and when John puts up his feet on Sherlock’s chair as usual, he looks down on them and smiles.
“I love you,” Sherlock murmurs in John´s ear and holds him tight, one hand in his hair and the other around his waist.
And everything went to hell.
It all started the night between Christmas and Boxing Day.
Monty makes a funny face before answering, “Police: funny to think that I married a policeman.”
Father gestures for them to sit down on the sofa or armchairs in the room. Giles and Monty sit down on the sofa, and John in an armchair beside Monty. Sherlock keeps on standing behind John’s armchair.
Sherlock had become even more confused when they entered the restaurant just a moment ago. He had carried Rosie in his arms and John had guided him with a hand on his back after the server showing them to their table.
When they met at the restaurant Richard had given him a kiss and asked how the session had gone.
His first thought when he saw the flowers was that Sherlock  had again made a romantic gesture. He had picked up the card to see if his lover had even written some poetic words. Totally prepared to tease Sherlock a little.
“Yes?”
“Obviously, John!”
John had hastily undressed and crawled into bed.
The thought hurts so much. Sherlock being a parent together with another man then him.
The room falls silent. Sherlock stares at nothing, then his mouth opens but no words come out.
“Too late!” He grumbles in response to John’s shushing of Rosie.
Sherlock had been happy to listen and seeing how invested Richard was in his new life.
“Good, now you’ve shown him that his thoughts about what *fun* you two would have had it if you had taken him with you is false.”
“Yes, but what will we do with her when we go to investigate when we’re in Buckie? I mean at the church or town house registry?”
She reaches up to cradle Monty’s left cheek before kissing his right one.
“John, please come in.” Standing in the doorway Peter holds up the door for him.
Peter feels so badly for this man. It can’t be easy, wanting a closeness with another person, but at the same time being afraid that that person would take much more than Sherlock is willing to give at that moment.
“It’s such a fucking hard thing to do!” It’s Sherlock’s harshest voice saying the words.
All those days had made John feel on the edge.
Somehow John had thought that a male lover would be rough and a bit on the violent side, not this tenderness Sherlock was showing. Then John realized that it was again his father’s voice in his mind, telling him these lies.
The reaction comes before Sherlock even thinks of what he’s saying.
“I couldn’t show you, didn’t know how to tell you-“
Monty and John sit down in the living room with a cup of tea.
“I hoped that we’re on the right road at last after Wednesday’s pair session”
His anger and recurring jealousy over Richard. The man who still remained a friend to Sherlock after their break-up! Going to dinner or concerts. Sherlock telling him that they loved the same classical music that John didn’t like. That man had had Sherlock in his arms like this so many times, but John had almost never had the opportunity to hold him this way.
“I need help. I need you to talk to and give me courage in meeting myself and my family history. Will you take me on as a client?”
“The reporter asked if Richard and I had met each other.” John’s voice has no emotion at all now.“Sherlock answered that we met each other on a pub night with mutual friends.”
“Of course it was! I can also understand why you was so angry and then married your wife. But isn’t it time you forgive him in your heart now?
Should he dare talk to him about what he should do when he felt horny? A snorting noise is sounding in the air, startling him before he realized that the outburst in the bedroom came from himself.
“A good session?”
“Thank you, that would be good.” John answers calmly.
“Yes! I’m not a pervert, I didn’t try to stalk them!
Peter nods and starts to write in his notebook.
John had been sitting there silently listening to the two other men. His face had become more darkened every minute the discussion lasted, as though he realized that his behaviour was dangerous for the relationship he desperately wanted to have with Sherlock.
John tells Sherlock that he is thinking about moving out of his apartment. He doesn’t like living in the home that he and Mary lived in together. Sherlock asks what sort of apartment he’s looking for?
“The nurse saved us. Remember, I said--Anytime!”
“Like many in the Watson family he married young. Hamish Montgomery was only eighteen years old when he married Mary Anna Buckles, they had three children together. When Mary Anna died in 1901, he remarried Mary McKerrow. Monty’s grandfather was born in 1903 and later Sarah in 1909.”
*****************
He never could forgive himself for what happened at that time.”
Sherlock turns around and returns to his armchair in front of Peter.
“What do you think, Sherlock?” John turns to Sherlock, letting him decide because this is a intimidating and unsettling situation.
“So you decided that I was not allowed to become anything more than your best friend?”
John is on his way home to Sherlock on the tube. It’s a Saturday evening and Sherlock had surprised him on Monday by asking if he wanted to go out with him to a pub this weekend. Sherlock had said that Greg and Mike had asked him to come, and he was afraid that he would mess things up if he went alone.
John seeing his dick?
Sherlock looks John in the eyes with a wrinkle in his forehead.
Monty cuddles into his husband's body and arms.
He sees a man in a garden lying on the lawn in front of a big yellow house, playing with a golden retriever and a small boy  about three years old, while Rosie sits in the stroller clapping her hands and squealing loudly at them.
John has been invited by Sherlock to a pub night?!
It’s a lovely but overwhelming evening for John.
A blush appears on John´s cheeks, “I thought about it. How would you’ve reacted if I had done that?”
The voice is still low and sad.
“Aren’t cousins supposed to help each other?” Surprised, John looks up at him with a questioning expression. Monty starts to explain what he meant.
Peter realizes his mistake in talking too harshly. He wants to hear what Sherlock feels at being sexual with his new boyfriend.
“This is fancy, Sherlock!”
At 9:30 exactly, Father Holstii opens the door to the reception room of the church.
John stops and stares at him on the last step before entering the floor landing. A smile appears on his face, his eyes shining with warmth.
“You’re right. Is it alright if John and I go and take care of the children?” Monty asks.
Memories of discussion. with former girlfriends, Mary’s anger when he had masturbated in the shower in the beginning of their relationship. Remarks from other soldiers how some men couldn’t get a woman so they had to resort to sex toys. Soldiers joking about how the best one of the soldiers could do was to order a sex doll, because he couldn’t get a woman interested in him.
John smiles back and silently goes into the room and to the cot. Sherlock follows him and puts the girl down.
John hears Sherlock whispering in a low rumble to his daughter.
“How do you mean?” Sherlock is mystified over John’s comment.
The poor librarian can’t really grasp what he's seeing.
“Yes, he was born the first of April 1947.”
Beginning notes:
“Hamish!” Comes a scream from Rosie.
“Go on, nothing you say can change what happened to mum?
But he wants to make it good for John too, he tries to find the right speed and motion to make John moan and gasp.
He doesn’t put more clothes on than necessary, since they will soon be taken off anyway. Black pants and a new dressing gown in a rich blue.
He and J.H were sent to the Dhofar province in Oman to the town Salalah, in January 1966. His first leave home wouldn’t be before one and half years later.”
“Old Mr W? I was only a little girl when he left, can’t say I remember him very well. Only that his friend Ossian made him give us children hard candy when we helped him sing in the children’s chorus at Christmas. Mr W was so happy and kind when Ossian was with him! It must have been a terrible shock for him when Ossian died in an accident visiting family in Edinburgh.”
“It’s good to know that I will see Sherlock again Monday afternoon.”
At the same time, John has a realization and the words rush out of him.
Hastily Sherlock interrupts Peter, the words burning on his tongue.
“Yes.” is Sherlock’s very short and raspy response to Peter’s question.
“We talked about Alex and losing loved ones, Sherlock, come here!
Both Sherlock and Peter are looking at him but don’t saying anything.
John struggles to get the words out with a stuffy nose and tears still falling.
“No? What do you mean?
John comes back into the room and goes quietly behind Sherlock and asks,“Can I please hold you?”
“Yes.”
She’s pointing and talking loudly whenever she finds interesting new things to point out.
The kiss becomes many kisses and the sound coming from them is the only one to be heard in the hallway. That’s the thought that makes John break the activities and say, “It’s good Mrs Hudson’s on vacation in America.”
Hastily the words flow out.
“Maud! St--” Sherlock is trying to interrupt Maud.
With a quick glance at his cousin and Sherlock, Monty goes down in his lap without a word. John and Sherlock don’t even look at them.
Always these but’s: his need to be close with Sherlock is nearly breaking him.
Sherlock frowns before he answers. Oh, he thinks both of us might be in trouble, sharing a room? He tries to calm Peter with a simple explanation.
“Me too, because if she wakes up she’ll scream the train down!”
“It’s a bit hectic, we’re going to Scotland with the night train.”
1965 April ?  Hamish meets J.H for the first time.  He wrote in his diary
The other man hadn’t been specially happy over them going to Buckie, but understood why it was necessary.
“It’s always nervewracking to meet new people,” John says to her in a low voice.
“You’ll have it.”
Sherlock takes a breath and starts explaining what he meant with the question.
Shaking his head, John is thinking of Sherlock’s words long ago at the first night together eating dinner: “I think of myself as married to my work.” That had been a warning, and John had realized that and never really tried hard enough to change Sherlock’s mind.
He looks down and sees John spurting on his stomach.
Shyly John turns to Sherlock, silently his dearest puts his arms around him and John hides his head in the other man’s neck. Sighing and holding on to Sherlock for dear life, John feels like coming home for the first time in his life. “People can think whatever they want,” he murmurs into Sherlock’s neck.
“Put out the light, will you,” John says in a low voice.
Sherlock helped him into the coat and gave him the gloves that he had given John as a Christmas present. Then he asked in a low voice, “Is it alright if I hold your hand?”
Greg stands looking at Sherlock.
“Good, very good!”
He told Peter about what he had realized that night, that the anger he had been carrying around was an old enemy and a burden. Beginning with his mother’s suicide and father’s abuse in the following years.
Bill, as usual would never understand that! The berk would only see mates and he liked them both, so why shouldn’t he be there?
Specially the time when two men had slept in the bunk bed above him. His hand comes up and moves over his face subconsciously taking away the images from that time.
He’d been so drunk!
“Yes, Mycroft has confirmed that to me!” The answer comes instantly from Greg.
At the end of John’s explanation, both Peter and Sherlock felt very sorry for the man.
Sherlock takes a breath to respond but John interrupts him.
An even bigger surprise awaited John when he came down to the entrance hall nearly an hour later. Sherlock was standing with John’s best winter coat in his hands looking up at the stairs when he walked down. Looking at John with an admiring gaze and a happy smile.
As his body reacts to his thoughts, he tries to hide the fact from his daughter, who is sitting at the table and eating her lunch.
“John, I think you have to prepare yourself to hear something upsetting.” Sherlock’s voice is low and uncertain, as if he didn’t know if he should say anything.
“I accept your apology. You and Peter must have worked hard for you to accept your bisexuality?”
“I’m not engaging in any activities with you, damn it!”
Little more than a half an hour later they're at the car they will travel into Buckie.
Maybe the scandal had something to do with him working at the church as organist and choir leader?
At night, sitting on the couch, one of them would lean into the other on the couch, give a cuddle or just play with his hair.
“And here we are! My deepest congratulations, gentlemen. I’m really happy for you!”
“That was the point of turning on the light, to show you that I’m all in, in this relationship.”
John was devastated, even if in front of Mike he laughed it off as a young man’s foolishness. Mike didn’t say anything, only nodded his agreement.
John blushes but holds eye contact when he answers.
How his hands would feel touching him, making him feel good!
“Yes, definitely!” Laughing, Sherlock sits up and relaxes back into the armchair.
*****************************************************
From the day Sherlock had moved into the Watsons’ household to that night when John held him, it was like the thermostat in his body had been pushed up several degrees. After Boxing Day morning, it had started to be a problem, trying to hide his dilemma from John.
“Didn´t Mary want you to say it more often?”
“You don’t remember?”
“I realize that I have much work to do yet before I can do that. To come out of the closet. Harry’s right, I have many scars in my mind to heal. One thing you maybe can help me with is to find the answer why my family is so homophobic?”
“Sorry, that I have made you open that Pandora’s box again.”
That was the starting point of six months that had been challenging all the way to now. But Darin had been relentless in always being clear in what he thought they should talk about and never ever giving up on a topic.
“Anne Elisabeth Watson. I don’t remember what she was called before she married my grandfather.”
When he came closer to Sherlock. Sherlock took hold of the punching bag and said,” Tell me what made you angry at our last session, why did you hit the trees so hard?”
Sherlock had asked if he remembers their safe words.
“Kiss my neck!” Bossy as usual John growls out.
How do I feel about that? Realizing that’s him hearing Peter’s voice in his head, the man is influencing his thought processes.  He buries his face in his hands.
“No, I will not disappear. You know you have to tell him about your university years.This is an abscess in your relationship that we have to clear up for your friendship to survive.”
“Only that John is stupid and doesn’t see what is right before his eyes.”
The story starts ten years after series 3. John, Mary and Rosie left London and left Sherlock behind. No contact for all those years.
Sherlock feels his cheeks flush; he looks down on his hands in his lap.
Sherlock looks into Peter’s eyes and says, with apparent  honesty,
“What do you think about that statement coming from a friend?”
Then making his wife pregnant again as soon as possible when he was home from deployment.
Surprise appears on Monty’s face. “You told me yesterday what happened at Marcus,?? about the letter to your mother.”
“Little over five years, is wasn’t easy for me to come out as bisexual. My friends and family thought I was a womanizer, a new woman in every country I worked in.”
It’s obvious for the two other men that Sherlock doesn’t want to talk about this.
“Still nothing that has anything to do with you.”
Shaking his head, Darin chuckles, “it´s not a law, Sherlock! You´re grown men and we’ve come very far with your therapy, for both of you. You’ve both worked very hard and you know now where the pitfalls in your relationship are. Maybe you two, shouldn’t start with the hard-core sex.”
“My sister Anna, you met her yesterday, is my oldest sibling and then I have three brothers: Thomas, Montgomery and Hamish. I’m the youngest. Our family haven’t got a lot of imagination when it comes to choosing baby names.” Monty wiggles a brow in amusement.
…………………………………………………………………………………….
“Scott--you remember, my first partner--had more experience than I did. He suggested safe words, but we definitely did not have a sub/dom relationship. It’s a good thing when a couple really want to have a consensual relationship. I don’t want to do anything to you that you don’t want. I hope you feel the same when it comes to me?”
It takes John a long time, just staring at the man playing, before he looks for a pen and paper and starts writing a note of his own.
Sherlock has now taken out a little penknife and is poking in between the thicker sheets, making a little gap between two pages. He murmurs to the other men as he is concentrating on his work of freeing the paper, hidden in the page. “You’re right, it’s a paper between two pages glued together in the book, John.”
Sherlock had started the morning cleaning the flat after the other two members of the family had left the flat.
Entering the bathroom John remembers the time he saw Janine go in this door, hearing Sherlock greet her with a laugh.
“Yes, a last try to see if you were interested.”
He’s been spending the day working on flat 221C that he bought for little more than two months ago. Mycroft had resolutely intervened after becoming rather frustrated over John’s dithering over what flat he could manage to buy near Baker Street. After three months he had not found anything in his income bracket or suitable for him and Rosie.
“Because of that you threw yourself from a building?”
John registers every bigger scar and wonders what tools the abuser had used to make it. He struggles to keep his breathing slow, and fight back tears.
He had never felt total love and acceptance from anyone in his life, besides sometimes from Sherlock. When he realized that Sherlock hadn’t trusted him when deciding to fall from Bart’s, that had made him furious.
“Every touch is like fire on my skin, but in a bad way. It’s like the hand or leg touching me is too warm. Like when you get too close to the steam from the oven or something very hot. You know I don’t like being hugged by many people. That’s the reason.”
“Yes, that would be lovely.”
If you had asked me this morning what would happen this day and then retold all the twists and turns, I wouldn't have believed you.
“You hurt yourself listening to the demons in your head saying ’I’m not gay.’” Shaking his head he grumbles out, “been there myself, mate!”
They’d discussed so much about sex, not finding anything that worked. John was petrified that Sherlock would give up on him, but he couldn’t do what Sherlock asked of him. It wasn’t right!
“Stupid homophobia!” Giles squeezes the words out between clenched lips.
“Did you know our great-grandfather, Hamish Montgomery?”
John Montgomery whistles loudly and then says, “I was born here in Buckie, 3rd of April 1969. Are you related to Hamish Montgomery Watson, who left Buckie in autumn 1925?”
For the first time after starting to talk about his sex life Sherlock looks at him and smiles, “No, not that time. I'd been fighting an assassin that had a sword.”
He had never talked about that voluntarily with anyone.
“Eat John, I take care of Rosie. You- “ he points at Sherlock with a finger when he passes him on his way out to the living room.
Many girlfriends were coming and going. Mike started to joke about how he never could go out of his room unless he was totally clothed. Going to the bathroom or the kitchen at any hour could end up being a new meeting, with a stranger!
You have the good fortune to claim him in public, we both occupy the same place in his heart - that is to say, we are not in it.
Giles and Sherlock leave the room to see to the children.
Sherlock doesn’t look on the man, his eyes is instead on the man he’s holding in his arms.
Sherlock sighs before he starts rattling off his deduction.
They’re silent for a moment, soaking in the warmth from the water and each other’s bodies.
The food was good and the atmosphere eclectic. A bit like being in the movie Moulin Rouge with a jazz band playing softly in the middle of the room. A varied assortment of guests, from the old couple in their finest clothes to the young group of people in casual clothing. They’d had a fun night out and had no problems finding topics to discuss.
Minutes pass but the atmosphere is calm and they both feel safe, just being there together on the bed.
It had taken some days before Sherlock calmed down from that evening’s discussion.
“No, it’s a lie!
“Yes? You mean that’s different from when we lived together before?”
He looks stunning in a dark red shirt and a black suit. His hair falls down over his forehead in soft curls.
“Later when Hamish looked at how much money his Father had put in his pocket, it was a big surprise. 2 pounds! At that time it was a lot of money.
“Good thinking. I’m hungry!
I want us to bond by touching each other and making each other know how our bodies feel. I want to know how many scars or moles you have.
“A Mercedes! That’s probably the last car I would have thought you should choose!” He laughs and goes around the black car to check it out.
His frustration and irritability started to show after some time.
Sherlock responds with a bump of his head on John’s shoulder, and says, “You started it, with your hands on my shoulders, a hand on my back when you put down a cup of tea beside me!”
“When haven’t you taking care of it yourself? In what situation?”
Sherlock quickly answers, “Pyjama bottoms?”
An icy chill goes down his body, he's been too obsessed with his own misery to realize what Sherlock was going through.
Wordlessly taking care of his hands. Cleaning them up and putting bandages on the knuckles. After doing that he had held on to John’s hands and said, “Next time you’re going with me to a boxing ring. I go there once a week; we’ll use boxing gloves instead. I think that would be beneficial for you. Especially if you do the exercises of naming your feelings.”
Peter sees the man is shuddering in front of him, and wonders at the response.
Somehow knowing that Rosie would travel with them made Richard calmer and less nervous over what could happen between John and him on the journey.
I will not take my life because I made a vow to Ossian. It was one time just after my marriage to Mary when he stopped me from ending my life. Mary and my marriage was the most unhappy marriage you can think of in this world.
“Come here! No need to get all-” John silences him with a kiss. Standing between Sherlock’s legs and holding his face between his hands.
They ordered a typical Scottish meal just for the fun of “being cultural,” as John puts it.
“This is something I never thought would happen between us.” John sounds so confused but at the same time happy.
After a moment Monty says with a sympathetic voice, “That must be rough, losing the man you love just when you realize you love him.”
“It must have been around lunch time? I met Richard and had lunch with him. Think I ate something then.”
The next day, Sherlock and Peter are sitting in the office looking at each other. Peter is waiting for Sherlock to start the session when he feels ready to talk. Sherlock doesn’t want to talk or even be there, in this office with a man that he thinks can read his mind as well as he can read Peter’s.
Sherlock turns and takes his lover’s hand, pulling him into the bedroom.
“What do you say about going to your therapist and discussing our relationship?”
………………………………………………………………..
Looking up at John from under his eyelashes, he gives a shy response, “Yes, of course we can.”
“We meet at a grieving group after his wife committed suicide and my boy was killed in a car accident at the end of 1982”
“We will be visiting very closely to the place where I grown up. Haven’t been there after I left for my first employment. Don’t know what to feel about it?”
“She used to tell me and Harry that he was so good looking and manly and that she had to get him to ask her out on a date. She tried everything to get him interested.”
“I don’t want to lose him as a friend either.”
“It was- “ he stops speaking and rethinks what to say.
That was the last time Sherlock had tried to discuss the matter before asking for help from Darin again. It was definitely one time too many in John’s opinion.
Monty lifts his feet onto a footstool and sighs when he leans back. “I think these armchairs are Giles’ best pick of furniture for this room.”  Monty sips his tea. “They’re really comfy.”
“John, this is in your head. You’re not hurting anyone, not Sherlock, not Richard. Yes, maybe you would hurt either of them if you would tell them about the dreams. But if I look at it from the point of view of you and your health?  That you could get a erection and release is good for you and your body. Yes, definitely it’s good for you.”
Sighing, John turns on the taps in the sink and rinses his face with water. Still embarrassed by the memory.
“The funny thing is that when I was away I forgot that I thought you would find a woman and marry her. I talked to you daily in my Mind Palace, I told you all the things I wanted us to do when I came home. In reality it’s a hard thing to remain sane when you’re on the hunt and are being hunted back. I didn’t realize that you’d moved out of Baker Street and met a woman before Mycroft told me.”
“Yes, we’re talking and have been cuddling for a long time now.”
“I took a long way home thinking about what to do. Thinking over my options before seeing you again. Start a secret whatever or move away from you, leave the flat?”
It’s Friday afternoon about six months from they returned from their journey to Buckie. John is sitting in the 221B sitting room waiting for Sherlock to come back from his therapy season with his new psychiatrist Darin.
But it isn’t enough, he wants to see and feel Sherlock’s penis too.
Those words relaxed John immediately, because it was true.
“My thought exactly!”
Rapidly Sherlock answers with what Janine said.
******************************************************
Standing there and looking out the window he remembers how terrified he’d been at that moment that she would tell John or Mary.
“You’re right. That would have left us with nothing but regret.
“You will try to understand Hamish?”
“If you have a fight with your lover and don’t feel the mental connection, what happens that makes you want to get the hell out of that situation?”
………………………………………………………………………….
Marcus had sent a message with times when they could meet and after they had discussed the suggestions, John and Sherlock answers him back that Monday at four o'clock was a good time to meet.
“Yes, I agree with that. I think it’s time for us to try and sleep? I don’t want you to try and leave again for the night. Can we all sleep here or is it too crowded for you?”
He had never talked about that voluntarily with anyone.
Even if Sherlock was still in bed and only felt John’s kiss on his cheek and whispered, “goodbye love, see you later.”
That would be a different thing. How does he make Sherlock realize the same thing? Sherlock is nervously wringing his hands that’s lying in his lap. Nervously Sherlock is wringing his hands in his lap.
Sorry for the long wait on this chapter.
“You’re scaring me now!”
“So you’re accepting the price of not being alone by paying with sex?”
England
Then he starts running after the man who really is taking this run as a serious matter.
“They've been together for a year now.”
I must also mention one other fic:
Seeing the man in the kitchen strolling around in only a bathrobe, with not even a shirt under the robe! Maybe not even pants?
The client before him comes out from Peter’s office. She looks down at the carpet and passes John without looking at him.
John nods and replies, “Yes, but I'll sleep in my pants.”
He told John that Darin wanted him to start building up friendships with other people besides John, and why that was so important for Sherlock´s wellbeing and making it easier for him to not start using again.
“Your daughter is a lovely little girl. I was just over there with some homemade jam. The children were playing in the garden. It’s lovely to see a new generation of Watsons growing up.”
He and Rosie goes to Baker Street to leave Rosie in Richard and Mrs Hudson’s care in the meantime Sherlock and him are visiting Marcus.
********************
Darin had asked a second question: who would be hurt if John repeated the same behaviour as he did before, when becoming jealous?
“Yeah, it’s high time we did, or my bollocks will burst.”
“Sheerl” She squill!
********************************************************
He´d pointed at the blankets and then his lips and made it clear what he wanted. Sherlock had shaken his head in a no gesture. After some moments of waiting the man then left the cage and kicked the blankets into the corner of the room.
Feeling a bit silly standing in front of a window talking about sex,
November 1926. Hamish Montgomery is listed as married and working in a church in Pancras, London.
Still looking at the search results Sherlock asks John,
Sherlock wasn’t like other lovers he’d had, female and male.
Richard answers him calmly.
John stops in front of the window with his back to Monty, “It’s a problem that he loves me too much?”
“He has to move on after an unhappy love affair, obviously!”
“It’s a note for me to remember to ask John what he felt, seeing Janine walking out of your bedroom. He has mentioned the incident before, but put an end to the topic very quickly.”
“Please, read for me? He’s begin him.
Sherlock had been a bit surprised at that; normally Harry would invite Rosie over for a Saturday to Sunday visit. “Three days with the little monkey was a long time,” Harry had said many times before.
Peter had taken over the discussion. He had started by saying he would come back to Sherlock’s behaviour at Bart’s, but just now they had to talk about John’s mother.
Hugs Tilda
“Do you think she’s out for the night?” Still a little anxiousness in Sherlock’s voice.
“They’re lovely when they’re happy, children I mean.”
But if  he pushes in one direction, he thinks Sherlock would go in another direction just to prove that nobody decides for him.
“Call me when you have time to talk. I’ll book a car with a car seat for Rosie.”
He looks silently at John before he leans over and coping his left cheek and let’s his thumb caressing the cheek. He then moves in slowly and starts kissing John’s lips with kitten kisses. John try to sit up in the bed and Sherlock helps him. Sherlock lays his right arm around his shoulder and pulls on John’s left shoulder.
“Did he agree to help you? Peter is lifting a eyebrow when he asks the question.
That he couldn’t make things better for John all the time, without thinking about what will happen next time John stands in front of a similar problem.
They towel each other off with caresses and laughter. Sherlock is a bit ticklish and John can’t stop smiling. Sherlock’s hair is standing in all directions. Sherlock happily smiles back without a thought about his unruly hair.
Gleefully Sherlock had messaged Mycroft that their partners probably wanted to celebrate their first and second anniversaries together at the restaurant.
1970 July, John is conceived.
“We have two sleep compartments . I booked us with family tickets as you suggested. They have a door between the two sleeping compartments and a cot for Rosie in the one with the double bed. I’ll take the other one.”
Sherlock quickly moves to John and takes the book.
“Is that why you’ve given Richard a chance, by dating him?”
“I don’t know?he frowns thinking about how to answer the question. Than he answers calmly.
John quietly turns and goes into the bathroom. He turns onthe taps in the sink so the other men won’t hear him if he makes any sounds.
“Yes.”
Because without thinking about it, John starts talking about how long it's been since he last touched anyone like this.
(See the end of the chapter for
Later that day he asked Jean Leekey out on a date for the following Saturday.”
“Yes, in a healthy relationship no one is the child or other one a parent.” Peter’s voice is clear and determined and he’s nodding his head for extra reinforcement of his response.
“No, no, no, I’m too late! He loves Richard, and he hates me! I have hurt him too much!”
“Call me when you have decided with Marcus too meet. I haven’t any case on at the moment only meetings with you and Peter.”
Peter is frowning, this doesn’t sound good. Is he giving too much of himself to Richard because he’s afraid to be alone? He thinks back on what John had seen happening between the two of them.
He gives Sherlock a smile and a node.
John is dreaming. A man is going down on him. He knows it’s a man’s big mouth and John is trailing his fingers through the man’s dark hair.
Then John decides that the woman is interesting enough to ask some questions. She’s a pretty, dark-haired woman in her mid-forties.
The first time Sherlock made that effort John had been startled at being at the receiving end of a good homemade meal, a dance in the living room and later in the evening a movie with little nibbles and wine.
On the group’s first mission they were ambushed by Taliban rebels. A brief battle broke out, during which Sholto's face was badly mutilated by an explosive blast. In addition, his ability to use his left arm became highly limited and he was forced to perform most functions one-handed. All the new recruits died and James was the only survivor from the ambush.
Then the sneaky bastard had seduced him with kisses, caresses and-- toys!
“No? Have never heard that before? How come my grandfather Monty was born in St Pancras, London then?
“Why was my last remark so startling for you, Peter?”
“Alright, I really don’t want to talk about this but I have realized that it’s important for me, for my life, to come to grips with this.” Nervously he glances at Peter, who seems very calm.
“You were afraid I’d be a homophobic and conservative asshole?”
“I don´t think John is ready for anal sex? He hasn´t done that with any man.” He growls out between clenched teeth.
John is coughing and humming a bit before he decides to talk.
“So, I haven’t any right to be upset?”
John had been content with not seeing Sherlock’s face, and had hesitantly asked, “why did you do that?”
Slowly Sherlock is trying to put Rosie down on the bed.
“Oh, so many things.” Abruptly Sherlock stops speaking. Seeking support from Peter with a look.
Again silence follows, both men thinking what could have happened that night. Sherlock sighs and starts talking.
Peter sighs and looks at John with a look that says, “come on man, don’t be ridiculous!”
-Scott abandoning Sherlock after he tried to help his father; a big punch to the tree.
“No, I didn’t mean I don’t want to talk about this with you and Sherlock. I only meant that maybe we could do it at our home, over dinner?” He bites his lips and looks a bit nervous.
*like a ton of bricks fell over me*
Peter had said that Darin was his partner and had specialized in PTSD and helping people work through traumatic experiences. In Peter´s assessment, Darin had an expert knowledge that Sherlock needed at this point in his therapy.
I love feeling your body move against mine, your beautiful sturdy and strong body, feeling your strong arms holding me safely.
*****************************************************
“In his diary Hamish wrote that Montgomery one Friday morning cornered him in the kitchen. Montgomery asked him if he couldn’t ask some nice girl out on a date Saturday evening, maybe to a movie and dinner? He pointed out that he was seventeen and had never asked any girl on a date. Then he silently put some money in Hamish’s breast pocket.”
In the last months, Sherlock has become more reluctant to talk about things that don’t revolve around Rosie or cases. He’s cold and analytical towards John but obviously loves Rosie, or “Watson”, as he keeps calling her.
Know what makes you moan and breathe quickly in delight. Therefore, safe words are important.
From the start of moving in together, he and James Allen had been low-key flirting.
Sherlock is looking quietly at the older man, trying to understand if he’s against him being near Rosie. Worrying if it’s his drug problem that makes the psychiatrist not want him near her.
“I’m in a relationship with another man and John has his daughter with him, in the same room. I don’t think we’ll be specially sexual or occupying our brains with sex.”
Sherlock wants to work on their friendship by going to therapy together.
1968 August 28, Harry is born.
“It started two days before John visited Baker Street. Janine and I had been dating for a little over three weeks. She had been sleeping over on and off for a week. Mostly I had been working the case and had been in different doss houses every night that week.”
It’s also the second time in my life that I written a sex scene.
You taking the first steps into a love relationship with me?
“You think that would help us?”
“John, breathe and take a moment. Sherlock will need you to see and understand why he did what he did. This will be hard for both of you, so be as brave as you can for Sherlock’s sake. I’m afraid he might break down, doing this. Abscesses must be cleaned out, John!”
“Mrs Hudson and I made a roast beef and potatoes salad. We thought it would be good to make something that you could eat both warm and cold. We didn’t know when you two would return.”
No, I was out of the closet for many years at that time, couldn’t stand it anymore, having a partner in the closet.”
“Come on, John! Let’s go and have a drink with our friends.”
“Hi, sugarnuts! What a sight to come home to!”
“To my surprise I didn’t understand what she was asking me. The only thing I could say was, “Sorry, what?”
John is quiet, trying to understand and process what Peter is saying.
“I understand what you’re saying, but you must understand that Sherlock isn’t doing this to save a partner relationship between you two. He’s doing this to save your friendship.”
“Everything.”
“Suicide?” Giles asks.
Marcus laugh at them.
John felt discarded, thrown away, not good enough to be waited for. Not worth giving him a chance to get his head around a sexual relationship with a man. He spent hours of thinking, what if I did that?
John pulls back and looks into his eyes, “Yes, we have. I’ve got some questions to ask and some clarifications to make myself ,but just now I’m too relaxed and tired. Only want to lie here with you.”
The only word John could get out was: “seriously?”
“Could it be, Richard who’s your true partner in life, but you can’t see it because John is always on your mind?”
Sherlock had to deflect the guilt he felt somehow and the only subject he could think of was John’s mother.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Sherlock was still upset that nobody told him what John did.
It feels fantastic and John moans witch makes the other man stop what’s his doing. He looks into John’s eyes and unbutton the last buttons. He then puts his hands on John’s shoulders and strokes of the garment from his body throwing it on the floor.
“Richard is a very good listener and we have only cuddled and slept in the same bed nearly naked. Yesterday I realized that he’s starting to be restless about it. He asked if we could do things in the same room. Not touching each other, but maybe- masturbate?”
He loves you for you’re the mother of his children and that you’re *a good person*. His words not mine.
Richard answer with a nod and a look that says *Go on!*
Sherlock sighs and thinks for himself before answering, “It’s started to become a problem, with me feeling like a teenager again. It´s not good going around with a boner all day and having a curious two-year-old around you.” His words come out a bit explicit, then he goes on with. “Even John isn´t that oblivious to my body’s reactions. I can´t shower three times a day.”
John swallows down his jealousy as best he can before meeting a worried Sherlock’s eyes.
John thinks silently for a moment before he says,
****************************************************************
“You think this has something to do with Sherlock?”
He smiles for himself and thinking. “Dad and John and their movie nights.”
A short time later Monty and John have left and the other two men are looking at the church books. They both suspect they will probably not find anything important left, but it’s time to leave the two cousins alone for a bit.
“Days before Hamish died he gave me this letter. He asked me to save it and if you or your sister ever asked me about Ireland or your mums death I would then give you this letter and tell you the story behind it being written.”
He stands up with his back straight and thinks. “Into battle.”
Then she smiles at John. “It was lovely to meet you, John. Hope you and your young man and daughter will visit us again soon. It would be wonderful to get to know you all three.”
Sherlock stands silently outside the door for a moment before he hears the taps close and John is coughing inside the bathroom. He then leaves the door and goes into the living room and sits down on the couch besides Richard.
A laugh escapes Sherlock. He seems a bit embarrassed but happy that Peter is treating him like the adult he is.
The explosion that detonated John’s feelings the next day at the boxing club, was both terrifying and enlightening as to John’s feelings.
“It’s best if we talk tonight in the dark, if that’s alright with you?”
For a moment they’re lying there smiling to each other in the dark.
I don’t care what you think of me or what happens to me in this life on earth or in heaven.
“Hi, no we have seen each other before and you will be nearby, anyway.”
When they come up to the room it’s Sherlock who changes her diaper and puts her into a onesie for the night. John is standing in the doorway to the bathroom looking fondly at them.
Rosie looks at her before starting in to chatting and throwing her hand up. Apparently discussing something very important.
“Yes, it’s very much because of me, I’m afraid. Before she was two years old, her mother had left her. I’ve tossed her around to many people and left her. It isn’t strange that she doesn’t truly trust me.”
“Yeah, sorry. I didn’t think about that. I only wished you’d known I would have helped you. Come on, then.”
“And before 1968 homosexuality was illegal. When your father was young, it was still illegal.”
“It depends, anything from a month between each self-gratification to every day for two weeks.”
Again he looks quickly up at the other man. It feels unsettling to talk about this with Peter. The other man looks totally serious and actively listening.
Peter suggested that John should invite her to a therapy session; it ended up becoming three sessions. It had been much easier to talk with each other having a mediator, and someone reminding them that they were grown-ups now. They couldn’t keep on blaming each other for everything. That had been a hard pill for him and Harry to swallow.
“We interviewed the man he had a long relationship with because I couldn’t understand the homophobia in the Watson family.”
John looks at her and whispers, “You’re right, she is tired tonight.”
“It would be an honor, John!
Hastily Sherlock puts down their suitcases on the bed.
“Of course you can. I would like to know what it was that influenced Hamish so badly in his life. It must have been something terrible.”
(See the end of the chapter for
With a gasp that’s nearly a sniffle John answers, “Thank heavens you can read my mind, love!”
“Oh, hi John. Has something happened?”
She never gazed longingly on Sherlock anymore.
Decision made about what to do after they eaten. John starts talking about another matter that’s occupying his mind.
Thank you Silvergirl, for your story was the shooting star for “What have you done?”
Sherlock decide to eat pancakes with Nutella and John’s pancakes are with raspberries and blueberries and cream.
“What did you get for information to your upcoming investigation and what made the meeting make you feel?
When they leave the Watson-Merivale household his mind is full of thoughts and impressions. He is very happy walking besides Sherlock and Rosie, letting them talk by themselves.
They couldn’t say anything explicit or do anything with each other.  For John it was a memory of closeness and a hope in his belly for something that could happen in the future.
He and Father Holstii decide that the next morning, Saturday at 9.30, they will all meet and talk about John’s great-grandfather.
“I think that’s good that you told him your limits and what you need from him.He can accept your limits or lose you from his life, that’s his decision to make.What would you feel and do if he couldn’t leave the closet?”
“It started two weeks after your dad's deployment in Northern Ireland in late February 1979. He met a man working as a nurse at the hospital he was stationed in. After a while Hamish realizes that the man, Roger was interested in him.They flirted but nothing happens before one evening after they both drunk to much and- Marcus looks a bit embarrassed out. Searching for words.
Sherlock helps John with his and Rosie’s luggage into the sleeper car.
“Cheers! I’ll hold you to it or I will haunt you down, and carry you to Peter and Darin for a new round of therapy!”
“Go on, the second boyfriend? Again Peter urges him to tell his past.
That what happened tonight, you didn't do anything wrong. Somehow my father got into my head and made me believe that a man can never be a gentle lover.
1 May 1894. Watson married Mary Anna Buckels.
“On his and J.H’s second tour, from July 1968 to the 4th of December 1969 something tragic happened in his life. J.H was killed on a mission and Hamish was injured in his right leg. Both were shot but J.H. was instantly killed. Head shot.”
*****************************************************
A more trustworthy heart than that is hard to find, and you have silenced it forever!
How Richard had helped Sherlock before just by being there.
Squeezing John’s hand he starts to talk. “With my first lover, Scott. He would get my interest with cuddles, like what we’re doing now. Not holding me in a tight grip. That can make me want to escape even if I want to have sex. Connecting mentally, with words and by looking into each other’s eyes, light caresses and kisses. All that turns me on. Establishing a connection, is that understandable?”
With Rosie is in his arms he immediately starts comforting her.
A train journey and a discussion in the dark.
Again he curses his blindness and his total misunderstanding of what Sherlock had been through hunting down Moriarty’s many different crime cells.
John hugs him close, one hand in Sherlock’s hair and the other holding on to his neck. Pulling Sherlock down with his legs around him. John’s kisses deepen but not hurriedly, he’s tasting and exploring sweetly with his tongue.
Sherlock hasn’t ended his question before John determinedly interrupts him. “You told me before that you’ve done both, yeah? I’ve used toys as you know and I’d like to try--” nervously he swallows down the last word but seeks out his lover’s eyes before ending his request, “--bottoming.”
After three days he told John that an inspector from a Historic Preservation society would come and inspect the house and meet John and Mrs Hudson.
The hurt in his eyes tells John that he’s still struggling.
“Janine said she wanted to see his reaction after he had written me off as asexual. Mary had told her that’s what he believed was my nature.” It’s a sad tone to his voice now, but still anger as well.
Giles and Sherlock enter the room and immediately see how upset John is, so Giles starts telling them what happened when they were leaving the church. They met Father Holstii at the church door.
“Maybe when I was a child, I haven’t called him that after the incident when he broke my arm.”
The sound of Sherlock plunging into the bath makes him look at him.
1982 August 23,  Hamish comes home after being drunk and fighting.
……………………………………………………………………………
John and Monty talked in subdued voices, not letting the other four really hear what they talked about.
Peter suggested that Sherlock assist in finding the best way to battle the damp and mould before the renovation started, maybe looking for some subsidy or fund for the renovation of a listed house.
Giles sits down in one of the big armchairs and pulls Monty down on his lap.
Breathing hard and clasping and unclasping his fingers John desperately tries to stay calm.
This afternoon he’d moved back home to Baker Street.
The thought of John’s reaction to that evening with Richard entered into his thoughts at the same time he opened the fridge door.
Roger Hammer
“Hi! Don’t rough up Uncle Sherlock, kids!” He yells at them. Dolly turns and comes running to him.
Sherlock is talking with a representative for the church where John’s great-grandfather Hamish Montgomery worked.
He reaches for Sherlock and tumbles back on the bed taking the man down with him.
“People can always surprise you even after a long time together.”
“John told me that you had things to tell him that you didn’t know how to say.What is it you want to tell John in therapy?”
Rosie is so tired she nearly falls asleep at the table. Calmly Sherlock lifts her up in his arms and holds her close
“Depending whether John is nearby and how deep your connection is mentally at the moment?” There’s a bite of humor in that question.
“We’re not together because of my own stupidity. He’s been with another fellow for some weeks now, but he’s helping me understand why the Watson family are so homophobic.”
“He remained at the house John grow up in?
1965 April 1, Hamish becomes 18 years old.
The words are pouring out of him. Words about his feelings after knowing what Mary did to Sherlock. Fighting with the grief over a lost image of a picture-perfect normal family life. Being angry over wanting something he couldn’t have with Sherlock as his partner.
After saying the last word John seems extremely upset. Sherlock looks at Richard, searching for support. Sherlock’s eyebrows raise slightly and scrunch just a little in the middle.
“Do you want someone to come with us?”
He sighs and shakes his head before returning to talking. “These days it’s a big difference: as soon as someone comes to close to Giles, that ugly feeling comes over me. The problem is that he’s never given me any reason to be jealous, it’s all in my head!”
“He told me something about myself that’s hard to accept—”
“Of course I will!” John’s eyes are shining; at last they have gotten it right. With a light-sounding question Sherlock decides to go all in.
John realized that Sherlock felt unsure but was trying desperately to be romantic. A sting of real delight hit him: this man was trying to do better, just for him.
“Please, try to talk a bit quieter!” John is trying to make him talk more softly.
What a beautiful man he is. The thought is already there before he can stop it. It’s nothing a man in his profession should think working with a client.
Shaking his head in mirth, Sherlock had understood John’s attempt at steering him in a direction of a less dangerous friendship in John’s point of view.
“No, Rosie inherits it but I have the right to do what I want with it until the day  she turns twenty-one. Then I must pay her the amount I get if I sell the apartment plus three percent interest.”
Sherlock realizes that John has gone back to sleep.
“Hi, Sweetheart, are you having a good breakfast? John, we have a meeting at the church tomorrow at 9.30 with Father Holstii.”
“I didn’t think you got aroused by a photo or a body?”
Marcus have more information to give about Hamish.
“Marcus told us that he and my Father were together for fifteen years and friends for nearly six before he died. They broke up because my Father couldn’t bring himself to come out from the closet. Everyone that could have had anything against it was dead besides my Aunt Peggy. I don’t want to make the same mistake and lose my chance to love!”
“John, to the next time we meet I want you to think over today’s discussion. How do you change your behavior when interacting with Sherlock? He doesn’t want you to get away with behaving like a brat or having a childish behavior. You can help him with that by not letting him push you to do things for him that he can do himself.”
It took some time for him to stumble out the words but the other two men waited patiently.
“My father was a very hard man, often letting his fists talk in every situation that didn’t please him. He wasn’t especially interested in us children, it was almost as if he ignored us. Mum was the parent who was there and gave us all the things a child needs. Father appeared at the breakfast table, hiding behind the newspaper and shouting if it got too noisy around the table. When my siblings and I were younger we didn’t see him in the evening, he always worked late. At least that’s what mum said.”
The priest had been restrained, waiting pensively for how they would react to seeing him again. Sherlock had thanked him for the information and told him about the document John had found in the diary. He also told the priest that they had photographed the letter for the Watson family archives but it would not be shown to anyone else than family members.
He tried to talk about what happened inside of him when he saw Sherlock again when he came back.
“Oh, she’s really delightful.” Giles sits down in a hunch in front of the stroller, saying hi to Rosie.
“It’s scares me but he’s right. We need to talk about things that aren't easy to talk about.” He goes over and lies down on the bed.
“Then I’ll give the restaurant an order for two people and a child that needs a child’s chair, what name should I put on the rese?”
“We never lived together.” The voice that answers Sherlock is so low and sad and Sherlock and John can hears the hurt feelings in the old man’s voice.
“He can definitely talk, even about--!” He quiets down and makes a crude hand movement.
Sherlock is shaking and tears fall down his cheeks, angrily he wipes the tears away.
“Yes, sorry to say, it didn’t work any longer between us. It’s worst for Mark, one week with each parent. At least it’s starting to work now after nearly two years.”
“Yes.”
“Then I’ll start with your neck and shoulders, sweetheart. You’re looking so wonderful.”
Sharply John looks Sherlock in his eyes, shaking his head.
Sherlock had asked him if he was upset with him for not remembering to give a hug or a kiss when they had seen each other as long as the case lasted.
Before answering Sherlock puts himself into his normal *thinking pose* with his hands together in front of his lips and closes his eyes.
Hesitantly John asks, “Was that one of the reasons you started using again? I already know the other reasons were me not being there for you and the case with Magnussen.”
Trying to breathe steadily and calmly, he sees John starting to talk with the woman.
Smiling, he reaches for Sherlock’s hand.
“It takes time to put her to sleep again?”
When John tried to talk about it, Sherlock shut him down. Told him to please wait with his questions for now. With a shaky voice Sherlock had told John that he and Darin were working through his experience with torture and he couldn’t take more about it just now, not even with John.
