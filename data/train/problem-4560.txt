They shut their office door behind them, stepping out into the hallway and making their way down to the conservation laboratory where all of the artifacts and artwork still being cataloged and prepped for exhibition were being held. Half a dozen other curators and staff milled around the room, intent on one task or another, but Castiel didn’t see any unfamiliar faces yet.
“There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man, and bring him to the ground,” they sang, and Dean strutted his way to the opposite side of the stage, Castiel taking the cue and passing him in the middle. They played off each other like they’d rehearsed it, jaunty and as slick as two idiots could make it, and the end of the song came all too soon.
My mother has the patience of a saint (although this phrase has been tainted forever, thanks), and she has loved having me here. But I know I can’t stay forever. With touring off the table and the museum long gone, I truly don’t know what to do with my life. I’ve been thinking about you and Sam, the way you just let the wind carry you. I don’t know if I could ever live like that, but there’s something exhilarating about the prospect of it. Maybe you’ve lived it too long to see it that way, and I wouldn’t blame you. Do you ever stop and smell the roses, as they say? To step back and take a moment to think how incredibly extraordinary your life is?
“Of course,” she replied in her best customer service voice. “If you follow the crowd down this hall, the main ballroom will be on the right; you can’t miss it.”
The whole tableau struck Castiel as odd, and he could feel his defenses rising. It didn’t help that they were all on edge already, but something didn’t feel right. Still, he took a breath and put a hand on Anna’s back, leading them forward. “Agents?” he said as they approached. “We were told you were coming.”
Dean, to his credit, took the news in stride, nodding thoughtfully like they were discussing opinions on a new gallery installation. “Oh, that’s—congrats.”
“Dean, trust me when I say, if we eat at Biggerson’s again, I
“Demons,” Dean said. “Thought we’d catch a panel or two. Never hurts to broaden your horizons.”
“Uh—Dr. Novak, I think. The ghost saint at the museum.”
Castiel searched Dean’s face for any sign of facetiousness, waiting for the punchline. He realized all at once that Dean was serious. He ducked his head with a laugh. “You know, I think there’s a certain allure to never knowing for sure.”
“Yeah, great!” As Castiel retreated to his desk once again, Sam turned back to Dean. “If it is angelic in origin, that only makes this all the more confusing.”
“Alright, everyone,” the woman said, “it’s Karaoke Thursday! We’ll get started here in about five minutes once we get the monitor hooked up. If you’re interested, come talk to me and we’ll get you in the lineup!” She clicked off the microphone and tucked it under her arm, stepping off stage to direct the men setting up the equipment.
Agent May drew his lips into a line, reading back over the sheet. “Dr. Novak, do you know how Thomas died? I have a bad feeling I can make a guess.”
“No, that was…it’s from
They worked in silence for over an hour, the only sound the tapping of a keyboard or the scratching of a pen above the museum’s industrial ambience. Dean checked his watch when the hallways echoed with locking doors and fading footsteps, most employees heading home for the evening. He looked up at Castiel, who either ignored the departure of his colleagues or was too invested in his work to notice.
“What? Why? What’s going—” Castiel cut himself off as Dean gave him one more imploring look and let his hand slip down off his arm before turning on his heel and following after Sam.
He startled when balled up foil hit him in the face, and he looked up to find Sam staring at him with one eyebrow raised. Dean fished the wrapper off the floor and threw it back. “What?”
A reluctant smile worked its way on to Dean’s mouth, and he let the statement go uncontested. He gathered his snacks and dumped them on Anna’s desk, plopping down in her chair to tackle the work he promised Sam.
P.S. I won’t invoke it yet, but know that I haven’t forgotten about karaoke.
“And that means doing karaoke in a hotel bar?”
his brain finally recognized. The images came flashing back: the smoke, the knife, the ambulance, bright lights. Dean. He gingerly placed a hand on his stomach, feeling the thick bandages, but he winced in pain again.
“This one’s for you Mr. Bulsara,” he said into the mic.
“Five kids, huh? And I thought looking out for Sammy was hard.”
“Oh, for god’s sake,” he cursed at himself, dropping his arms to his sides. He forced himself to walk away, to be content with whatever combination of indecision he ended up with. Grabbing his wallet and room key, he shut his door behind him and took the elevator up to the roof level.
Does this mean you’re backing out of our karaoke date?
Alex wouldn’t look him in the eye, staring at the floor and visibly fighting back tears. The muscles in his forearms tensed as he clutched his book tighter. “I can’t afford to fall behind,” he said in a small voice.
Dean scanned through the short bio, forcing his brain not to process the name of the university. Not yet. Everything sounded just like Cas had described it, of course it was: adjunct position teaching a literature course focusing on the Bible, previous experience curating religious artifacts, currently devoting his time to researching a book on angelic iconography.
His eyes widened. “FBI? Here?”
“This oughta be good,” Dean said, but he went along with it, ears straining for the first notes to find out what Cas’s idea of a joke was. When it kicked in, he shook his head but couldn’t fight the smile as the unmistakable bass line of “Another One Bites the Dust” thumped through the room. He looked at Cas who was bobbing his head to the beat.
Anna’s voice was strained. “He texted me this morning to say he was dropping out, but I haven’t heard from him since, and he won’t answer his phone. He’s the only one I haven’t been able to reach.”
“EMF?”
You asked me when we first met if I turned everything into a poem. Maybe you’ll indulge me in waxing a little poetic about a thought I had the other day. Isn’t it strange to think how everyone we know was a stranger to us once? But how magnificent is it that the universe curates these moments that we seize upon, deciding in one way or another that a stranger is now a friend, a lover, an enemy even? Billions of people in the world and fate decided that it would put me in your path. It staggers me to think about the odds of us meeting versus living in a world where we never intersect. If you never picked up on the museum case, would we have met another way? I think I like the idea of destiny, but it’s too big for me to understand.
“Don’t you?”
“Died not too long ago,” Dean said. “Which you would think would
The woman looked up, eyes searching the fray until she noticed him waving. She wobbled to her feet, and Castiel took the acknowledging grunt from the officer as permission to slink through the barrier. He ran forward to meet her, and she collapsed into his arms.
Castiel stood up and went around to put a hand on Alex’s shoulder. “Whatever happened, nothing good will come from you blaming yourself. It’s normal to feel guilt tangled up with the grief, especially if things were tenuous. But trust me when I say that holding on to that blame will only make you sick.”
The Impala sputtered off, Dean pulling the keys from the ignition. “I’ll take the win,” he agreed. “Maybe we can grab a full night’s sleep for once.”
Dean felt the bubbling frustration again, and he fought against snapping at Sam. “I don’t know, man,” he said, even if he wanted to believe he did. “But it’s not about Cas, not really.”
Students packed up their belongings and filed out, but Castiel called out to one of them before he could take his leave. “Alex? Do you mind taking a moment to speak to me?”
“If this was some kind of crucifixion thing, maybe we’re looking at witches instead?”
“We spend so much time on the road; it’s not really in the cards for me.” He folded his arms on the counter, dropping his eyes.
But Dean recovered, clearing his throat and rotating on the stool to face forward. A waiter dropped off a menu for him and he spent a few minutes reading it over. Castiel tried to surreptitiously watch him as he did so, studying the slope of his nose, the little pinch and protrusion of his brow, the chiseled cut of his jaw. And god, his eyelashes. What a beautiful subject he would make.
Sam eventually caught back up to him as they made their way out to the car, the mood between them tense and heavy again. They went through the motions, the routine so second-nature to them both that they barely had to exchange words. Motel, dinner, gear check, research, sleep. Rinse and repeat. Dean had the unsettling thought that he could live the rest of his life on autopilot, just wind him up and set him loose. Maybe the demon deal was a little above his paygrade, but he had no doubt he could take down his fair share of things that go bump in the night before his time was up. Whether his heart was in it or not.
“Oh, hi, cherub. I didn’t even look at the caller ID; I’ve been catching up on Hell’s Kitchen. The season finale is tomorrow.”
But the prospect of digging up Alex’s dead father wasn’t lost on him, and he prayed he could find a way to ensure it didn’t come to that. There became the matter of figuring out where to begin. He sat up and fetched his laptop. If there was one aspect of hunting, he knew he could tackle, it was research.
“I’m thinking about it,” Cas replied, his voice weak. He blinked back the tears forming, feeling stupid for them.
“I’m your big brother. It’s my job to protect you, always has been. If I can’t save you, what does anything else matter?”
The agents muttered quietly to each other at Anna’s desk; they were combing through the list he’d made, crossing off names and circling others. Castiel didn’t hear the criteria they were searching for, but it gave him hope that they seemed to be on to something.
She squeezed his hand back. “You and your siblings were always the worldly types—I knew you would fly the coop eventually. But it wouldn’t hurt you to call every now and then,” she scolded him with a teasing glare.
“You’re the one who taught me all the reasons we
“Well, technically if the spirit has some kind of unfinished business, helping it resolve that could lead to them moving on. But that’s not an exact science, and if Alex’s dad is newly dead, there’s no telling what he has unfinished. Spirits don’t just wake up as ghosts with all the knowledge of how to pierce the veil. That’s probably why his appearances are so spotty. Burning the bones is straight forward and the most foolproof option, especially if you’re worried that the kid is in danger.”
“Do you know if either of them reported anything unusual about the scene? Aside from, you know…” He gestured vaguely at the wall.
“Let’s just say Anna and I are incompatible on a much deeper level than that,” Castiel said. But he watched the puzzlement run rampant in Dean’s expression, so he took pity on him and clarified: “I’m—I’m gay.”
A stupid smile worked its way onto his face as he stacked the flimsy motel pillows on top of each other and climbed into bed. It diminished all too quickly though, as the remorse seeped back into his thoughts. The burst of pride in his chest that he felt when he found out Cas was tackling a case on his own was devoured by the guilt that Dean had opened that door for him. A door that was impossible to close once someone had peeked through it. Dean survived on a haggard four hours of sleep a night so he could fight to keep that door closed for as many people as possible. It was too late for him, but if he was fast enough, smart enough,
Once they were out of earshot, Sam fell back into step beside Dean. “It’s not that big of a deal to go change,” he said.
“How often do people give you a genuine answer to that?” Cas asked with a wry smile. He raised his eyebrows. “Because, call me crazy, I’m guessing you’ve done this before.”
“It’s late, I gotta get back.” Dean pushed himself off the couch and marched toward the door, and Castiel scrambled to follow him.
Castiel and Anna turned around to see a pair of suits push through the double doors. They struck Castiel as young for federal agents, one of them tall with shaggy brown hair that couldn’t be regulation, and the other with a bow-legged, self-confident gait that made up for the height difference between him and his partner. They stopped at the threshold, fishing in their pockets as they took stock of the room. The shorter one motioned to a painting with a half nude woman, whispering something under his breath and bumping his partner with his elbow, earning a disproving glare.
Cas turned back around in his seat, and the look on Dean’s face was full of trouble. “Oh no,” Cas protested, hunching down in his seat like Dean was going to physically drag him up there. “Absolutely not.”
“Sure…I can go print it out,” she said. Dean could hear the confusion in her voice, and he was reminded of the influence granted by the badge they carried around. She didn’t ask any questions, just trusted that they had some kind of rhyme or reason to the request. Lucky for the world, Dean thought, that they were trying to do some good.
“I appreciate that, but you don’t have to babysit me.” She smiled, contrasting the exhaustion in her eyes. “I know I can handle it, it’s just—"
“That’s code for ‘Dean, leave the room so Sam and I can talk about the elephant in the room.’”
The ghost’s face distorted, its mouth yawning open as its neck snapped sideways. Dean felt a hand clutch the front of his jacket, and he looked over to find Cas stricken, frozen in place as he beheld the ghost bearing down on Sam.
“Thanks,” Alex said weakly, taking the paper and slipping it in the front cover of his book. He stood up, but he didn’t move anywhere, looking like he was deciding on whether or not to say something. “Dr. Novak, can I ask you something kind of personal?”
“Fortunately, it’s a literature class—I don’t have to write sermons or anything. I’ll even get to talk a little about my research and religious artwork.”
“I wanted to apologize for how I was acting at the museum at first. It was callous and uncharacteristic of me,” he said.
He flushed, but he handed her the bowl, not about to argue. He gathered his bags and hauled them up the stairs to the guest bedroom, setting the suitcase aside to tackle tomorrow. From his carry on, he took out his laptop and set it on the bed. Dean’s slip of paper was right where he left it, and he situated himself against the headboard with it clutched in his hand.
“I’m not judging you for doing what needs to be done, but that just feels so disrespectful,” Cas said. “I don’t know if I can bring myself to that. There has to be another way.”
“And miss out on that roadside charm?” Sam quipped. He took off his jacket and draped it over the back of the chair in the dinette.
After thirty minutes, he started to lose hope, stirring a straw around the dregs of his drink but declining the bartender’s offer of another. Technically speaking, Dean didn’t actually commit to coming—they were probably busy after all. Castiel tried to ignore the terrifying implication that demons were another real threat to consider; he was still working on ghosts. Either way, Dean likely had better things to do than waste his evening in a gaudy hotel lounge with a guy he met once.
Dean yanked Conrad forward by the sleeve, swiveling his head for any sign of the ghost reappearing. “What the
Cas rolled his eyes. “Nevermind.” The doors pinged and slid open, and Castiel led him down the hall, lifting his shirt to pull his keycard out of his back pocket. “I might be surrounded by crazy people all day, but I can’t say they don’t compensate well.”
“Why am I your responsibility?” Sam said, his voice rising. He wasn’t yelling, but there was desperation there. “Because dad told you to look out for me? I’m a grown man now, Dean. If you believed everything dad said, you wouldn’t have just told me what you did about Cas. You have nothing to be ashamed of, and you matter just as much as anyone else.”
“Only one person in the whole world calls me that,” he said, grinning. He ducked out of the hold and turned around, welcomed by her genteel smile. “Hi, mom.”
“Agent May wants a list of all the human remains we have on display,” he answered, making a face. “I’m a little afraid to ask why.”
The obvious choice was to return home, and he knew he would have to eventually—everything he owned that wasn’t in his suitcase still sat in his place there. But without the museum job, it didn’t feel like home anymore. He winced at the thought of the phrase ‘ghosts of his past.’
“Cherub, I’ve seen you naked covered head to toe in honey to become one with the bees, I think everything is uphill from there.”
Rubbing his hands together, Dean seemed to think on it for a moment, finally looking up at Cas with something like an apology in his eyes. “Man, as grateful as I am for your help back there, I would give anything not to have you know what you know now.”
“It’s…not that simple,” Dean said. He turned to look out the window over the dimming landscape. The hulking silhouette of a low mountain swallowed the sun, and the spindly pines cast long shadows along the grass.
Dean didn’t laugh, didn’t even acknowledge him, just stood with his hands in his pockets and his eyes cast down. Sam at least pretended to be amused, and he tried to nudge Dean into speaking. When he didn’t, Sam cleared his throat and said, “We’re, uh, glad you’re doing alright. They told us about the procedure and everything.”
The concierge spared him a confused glance as he powered back into the hotel, slamming the call button again. He willed it to come quicker, losing his nerve with every tick of the lobby clock. When it finally opened, he pushed himself to step inside, clenching and unclenching his hands. The red numbers on the screen dialed up with agonizing slowness. “Come on…”
“I texted Anna earlier, and she was able to contact most of them. Now that I’ve finished this, I was going to try to call the others,” Cas said.
By the time they released him from the hospital, Castiel had to evaluate his life all over again. The conference board let him out of his contract, so he didn’t have to continue traveling around the country. Aside from the hit to his income, he was grateful for that. But that left him without a job, stuck in Utah with no one.
“What’d you learn from [slightly offensive term referencing how cute anna is]?” Dean pushed on. Sam took the bait and started talking about the case, but a shadow lingered over his face, and Dean pushed the burbling shame deep into a dark corner of his mind. He thought about the way Castiel had called him on his bluff just by looking at him—was he really fooling anyone? Least of all Sam. No one on the planet knew him better than his brother, so how long could he pretend everything was fine before the charade fell apart?
“Hey, in my defense, if you’re committing a crime, even if it’s for a good reason, it’s smart not to parade around with your real full name. And how many FBI agents are brothers, huh? Agents Winchester and Winchester? Like a damn sitcom.”
Cas pressed his fingers below his eyes, trying to keep the tears from falling. “I’m sure you weren’t planning on interrupting your Hell’s Kitchen marathon for a conversation like this,” he joked, trying to laugh.
Tossing the Impala’s keys over, Dean held up a finger in warning. “Not a scratch.”
The guard nodded, moving aside for them. Castiel flipped through his keys for the orange capped one, unlocking the double doors just long enough for them to slip inside. The lights were off in this section of the building, but enough sunlight streamed in through the high windows that it was easy to see. Still, that eerie feeling permeated the air, and Castiel resisted the urge to shiver in front of the agent.
“You’re gonna deny a man the opportunity to get some culture in his final days?”
I’m still healing, but the doctors said everything looks on track to making a full recovery. I’ll have a pretty gnarly scar though. I’ve been told that chicks dig that? I wouldn’t know.
“Problem?” Dean asked.
Resisting the urge to throw himself on the bed like a teenager, Castiel instead pushed open the door to his balcony and stepped out into the summer air. His room faced the enclosed courtyard, and he preoccupied himself with people watching for a while, thinking about all the winding paths each of them walked to bring them to this spot. Which paths were predetermined? Which were forged? Maybe you never really knew. Maybe it was enough to enjoy the journey.
Hazy memories of his brothers and sisters chasing each other through the rows of vines and getting in trouble for trampling the family heritage flitted before his eyes. He imagined being that young and carefree again, the dirt on his knees and tangles in his hair, laughter echoing through the open sky. But he turned back to his mother, seeing the driveway from the same perspective where he watched his father drive away for the last time. Cas remembered why it took him so long to visit home again—for all the happy memories that lived here, this was also where he was abandoned, and that emptiness soaked into everything.
Castiel picked up his bowl and pushed out his chair, leaning over to kiss his mother on the forehead. “I love you.”
“I don’t mean to sound sour, Cassie,” Elizabeth said. “I’m proud of you, and I’m so happy you decided to stay in town longer. But…well, you know I’ve had enough sermons to last me a lifetime.”
Take care of yourself,
“You shoulda seen the kid after those lectures,” Dean said. “He’s back at our motel probably making color coded binder tabs for all his notes.”
“I need you to figure out who he is,” Dean continued, pointing back toward the gallery. “There’s not time to explain, you just gotta pull through for me. Can you do that?”
A flash of headlights swept through the room as another car left the parking lot. There were only a handful left, most of them probably belonging to the security night shift. With the size of the museum and the various staff, they would never be truly alone in the building, but that didn’t prevent the tingle from running down his spine.
Dean looked at his hands clasped between his propped up knees, and Castiel thought he might actually look embarrassed. “Yeah, maybe a couple times,” Dean said.
Another retreating pair of headlights flooded the room, and Dean looked over at the parked cars. “Is this the staff lot?” Cas nodded. “If your guy did show up, is this where he would come?”
“Of course,” she told him. “We’ll take it slow, but I’ll have something brought up for you. And if you feel well enough, I’m sure your cousins are anxious to see you.”
It shouldn’t feel dirty. It shouldn’t feel wrong. He shouldn’t still feel the heat of the flames fanning his shame from eleven years ago.
is going on?” Conrad squeaked as they emerged into the great room.
“Shut up.” Dean finished his drink and picked up his third. “You’re definitely drinking this time though.” He narrowed his eyes and stared hard at Cas, trying to get a read on him. “I assume you vote in local elections.”
Dean typed out a reply and hit send without spending too much time second guessing his words. Despite his anxiety already spiking in anticipation of Castiel’s response, it was the most at peace he’d felt in a long time. It was small, but it was the first steps he’d taken in that direction of his life since John had burned it all away.
“I can show you.” Castiel led Dean down the hall toward the new installation: a sunken amphitheatre. The stage at its center was taped off too, and Dean bounced down the shallow steps to reach it. Castiel followed and took a seat on a bench a few yards away.
For a moment, it looked like Castiel wanted to argue, but he just nodded as they loaded him onto a stretcher. Dean moved out of the way, watching him go. He’d made his promises, but he saw them wound into a cord connecting them both—the farther he let Castiel get, the tighter the cord stretched. Too far, and it would snap.
“Is that an order, agent?”
“I don’t know, but this whole business has me freaking out. I just know I won’t be able to calm down until I know he’s safe.”
“I don’t need a documentary, Cas, I just need—fuck!” He ran off at the sound of glass breaking, leaving Cas alone.
The waiter delivered Dean’s food, and the look on his face reminded Castiel of a kid on Christmas. Castiel watched, fascinated, as approached the appetizer like a science experiment: each variety of cheese curd on its own as a control, then systematically tasting and combining each sauce.
Of course, that was only the first of the problems plaguing him. But he had to start somewhere. “I…fuck,” he whispered, rubbing his eyes. “I didn’t bring us to Salt Lake City for the stupid panel, alright?” It came out angrier than he intended, but Sam kept a cool head.
But Dean only raised his eyebrows in acknowledgement, and an awkward hush fell over them. After a minute, Castiel looked sidelong at Dean and took a deep breath, and like a wall coming down between them, he set his article aside and angled his body to face Dean. “Can I…say something?”
“I promise; from here on out, you’ll be sick of me.”
It sounded silly for some reason to say it out loud, but Castiel told him, “Anna and I always come here the cheese curd flight. There’re two different batters and four dipping sauces.”
“What happened with the surveillance?” Dean traced his fingers along the wall, drawing a line from hole to hole in the shape of the cross. When he pulled away, he rubbed his fingers together then brushed them off on his pants.
Dean’s green eyes held a pool of murky despair, but it was barricaded, and Castiel could tell that whatever was fueling that sorrow wasn’t for him to know. Instead, he lifted his head so he could reach out toward Dean. “Well,
Dean blinked at him in disbelief. “And you speak angel-ese?”
He unlocked the door and stepped inside, and Dean followed, trying not to gape at the digs. With a king size bed, plush carpets, and glittering chandelier, it was easily the most expensive hotel room Dean had ever been in. Castiel walked past the bed into a lounge area that was sectioned off by a folding glass divider. “Damn,” Dean said, joining him and collapsing onto one of the champagne-colored sofas, “most of the motels we stay at still have body shaped tape on the carpet.”
Dean let the question go unanswered, dropping his gaze as he stepped around Sam to walk down the hospital hallway. The Maple Springs case didn’t turn out at all like they suspected, with fairy tale murders and comatose ghost children. It was a ridiculous premise, but the aftermath hit him harder than he expected it to.
And Dean had just about enough of those.
He slid to a stop not far from Cas, grimacing from the impact on the hard marble. Castiel ran over to him, falling to his knees and gingerly setting a hand on his shoulder. “Are you okay?”
The question made Dean laugh, and Castiel couldn’t decide if that made him feel better or worse. “If they are, they ain’t talking to me,” Dean said.
to put some of that behind you, otherwise you would never be able to make it to tomorrow.”
Castiel rolled his eyes but took a seat with her at the kitchen table. They sipped their wine and talked well into the evening, only getting up to cook something simple together. He’d almost forgotten that his mother liked to sing when she cooked, and he followed her directions, just smiling to himself as her voice filled the room.
Dean’s hands clenched. “Man, I…I’m so sorry. I even made a stupid joke about leaving you to clean up our mess. That’s not fair, we should’ve—”
As much of a Romantic as Castiel was at heart, he tried his best to keep himself from being carried away by his imagination. The wing of the museum where Jonah was killed was roped off to visitors, of course, but despite having clearance to pass that way, Castiel took the long way around to his office. He jumped through as many mental hoops as it took to prevent himself from thinking the word ‘haunted,’ but he would be lying to deny that there was some kind of miasma lingering in the halls.
“I know, but—”
Dean let the fiendish little thoughts chase each other in circles in his head for a minute before he muttered “fuck it” under his breath. He typed
“Dr. Novak?” he said. “Do you have time to talk, like you said before?”
Dean spotted a diner on the corner and swerved into the parking lot, shutting off the radio with a shaky breath. The powerful aroma of greasy fried food wafted through the open window, setting his stomach to rumble. Grateful for the distraction, he honed in on the feeling, shutting out thoughts of anything but the bacon cheeseburger he was hoping to find inside.
While I was at the gallery, I met someone. We got to talking about art, and it turns out he got an art degree from the same college I did. He’s older than me, so we never crossed paths while we were there, but what a moment for the universe’s curatorship. He invited me to the theater tonight, and I said yes. I’m not sure if it’s a date, but I’m nervous either way. I know you’ll be absolutely shocked to hear this, but I don’t make friends easily. It’s nice to have someone to connect to.
“I was beginning to think you were a no show,” Cas said. “And no Sam?”
“Keep me in the loop, cherub. Talk to you later.”
Rubbing his forehead, Castiel dodged the question for the time being. “Just wanted to call and check in. Needed a break from lesson planning.”
Castiel tried to unpack that sentence piece by piece, but he got more and more lost the further he went. He gawped, struggling to find something to say in response to that. Perhaps most puzzling was the fact that Dean hardly appeared bothered by it, like any one of those things was just another day in the life of a Winchester. Maybe it was. And Castiel thought a vengeful saint was a lot to process.
I know you intended for this email to be emergency only, so I just want to assure you that I’m not in any danger. If you respond back telling me to stop, I will, but I know I would regret it if I didn’t try to reach you. I’ve known you only a brief time, but it’s not an exaggeration to say that you changed my life. You’re something special, Dean. I get the impression that even if people tell you that often, you don’t believe it. I believe it.
“You didn’t see him, Cas,” Anna said, her voice haunted. “He wasn’t just killed, he was crucified.”
On anyone else it might have looked stupid, but the wings suited him. Unlike the hard black lines in most angel wing tattoos, Castiel’s were soft, like brush strokes, with feathers in bold rainbow colors. They spread out from between his shoulder blades, curving up and spilling out on to his shoulders, as if they could unfurl when he raised his arms. Spanning the entire top half of his back, it looked like Castiel had turned his body into a canvas for an oil painting.
“We exorcised it,” Dean interrupted. “The demon that did this. So you’re safe now, but…”
For all that he complained to Dean about lesson planning and lethargic college kids, Castiel paraded through his days like he was walking on sunshine. The literature class was more rewarding than he’d anticipated, and he enjoyed fostering relationships with students who shared his passion for the genre. He’d never considered teaching before, and this was only supposed to be a temporary gig while he worked on his book. But mentoring the young artists and scholars turned out to be more fulfilling than anything he worked on at the museum.
“You and your brother saved my life. You made it possible for me to worry about being strong for myself; give us a little credit, yeah?”
Sam took the photos back and inspected the marking again. “’False witness,’” he repeated. “Like the Ten Commandments?”
He cracked his knuckles and dove in.
“Hey, uh…Cas,” Dean said. Castiel didn’t miss the quick sideways glance from Sam at the nickname, but the disbelief of seeing them here overruled any social analysis.
“Mind if we ask you a couple of questions? I’m sure you’ve spoken with the police already, but we’d like to follow up on a few things,” the shorter one said. His bright green eyes swept over Anna, and Castiel instinctively took a step closer to her.
The look on Cas’s face made Dean think no one had ever done him a favor before, which he figured couldn’t be true—a cushy lifestyle and a face like that? Surely he was accustomed to being showered in acts of kindness, and he struck him as the kind of guy who had a lot of good karma stored up for a rainy day. “Thank you,” Castiel said, his gravelly voice a touch softer. “A coffee would actually be incredible.”
He could read Sam like a book, and he was sure it went both ways. Sam eyed him, probably certain something was up, but he couldn’t put his finger on what. So he just said, “Yeah, pretty crazy…” He let the moment drift away before he slipped into the bathroom and the shut the door behind him.
Wheezing, the demon coughed out a laugh. “I’ll save you the trouble.
Dean dipped under the police tape and paced around the perimeter of the area. “You said Dr. Milton…Anna, was the one who found this one?”
“For your sake, I hope that’s true.”
He ran a hand through his hair, walking back over to the table to grab his glass of water. Dean’s empty shooters felt like salt in the wound. Taking a long drink, he tried to decide what he was meant to do now.
But this was about more than just Cas calling for kicks; he thought about Alex and pressed ‘call.’ The line rang a few times before a deep, gruff voice answered, “Hello?”
The room around him was stark and unfamiliar. He couldn’t remember anything about how he got there, and he struggled to parse through his memories when an overwhelming pain swept like a wave over his body.
“You gonna make it harder for me?” Dean asked, a hint of his usual humor returning. It would have been comforting if it didn’t feel like armor.
“You think he would come here?”
Finally, he said, “It’s…hard to explain. But you can trust us.”
“It might surprise you then to hear that I’m not?” He paused and reevaluated, cocking his head. “Well, I guess you could say faith and I have a complicated relationship. I suppose I believe in God, but…” He laughed. “Maybe that’s a bit of a heavy conversation for a guy you just met this morning.”
Dean stared at him. “You were fired?”
“You sure about that? ‘Cuz now you owe me twice,” Dean joked, swallowing back the lump in his throat. He didn’t mean it—the thought of holding this over Castiel’s head made him sick, especially since Cas wouldn’t have needed saving if it weren’t for him.
“I’m sure you are excited, College Boy,” Dean said, making Sam laugh and roll his eyes.
“It might be for the best to keep that question to yourself then,” Dean told him, and Castiel took the ominous hint.
Sam waited to see if he was going to continue, but when Dean continued gazing at his unfinished burger, he said, “Dean, if that’s it, there’s noth—”
The ambulance doors shut, Castiel now out of view. Dean set his shoulders. “Our damn job.”
“I’m not sure, but definitely something weird,” Sam said. He flipped open the folder and pulled out two photos, taken of each of the victims. Dean noticed the symbol immediately, but it wasn’t one he recognized either.
“I’m okay. Physically anyway.” She shook her head. “But Jonah…Cas, it was awful.”
It took them another two days to reach Salt Lake City, and they stopped by Bobby’s place to check in on their way. With the Colt still a work in progress, Bobby kept pretty holed up, but he made sure to let them know he was only ever a phone call away.
“Sam, you got the list?” Dean asked. Sam pulled the crumpled paper out of his jacket and handed it to Dean, but he immediately thrust it into Cas’s arms. “Look at the ones we marked. Any of them bite the dust early?”
“Not for another couple weeks,” he answered, “but I’ve never taught a full semester course like this. The summer class was just an intense few weeks, but now I have to stretch enough material to cover through December.”
Dean looked at Sam, but his brother didn’t seem to have any input for him; he just kept his hands in his pockets, smiling down at Dean. When it was clear he wasn’t going to say anything, Dean cleared his throat. “Uh, yeah, sure. We’ll see if we can make it.”
The cool evening air helped to calm his wired nerves. Sat on the front steps of the museum as they waited for an ambulance, he pressed a makeshift icepack to the back of his head. He was lucky: aside from some lingering dizziness, all they could find were surface scraps from the broken glass. Still, better safe than sorry, he figured.
“Was your father buried? Or cremated?”
Guilt gripped his insides. Cas must feel like he did something wrong, or worse, that Dean couldn’t tolerate part of who he was. Dean could still feel the ash inside of him, what the fire left behind. Castiel hadn’t let anything or anyone smother his heart like that. Dean envied that about him, but he left Cas with little other choice than to assume that Dean was just one more person to put him out.
As the second verse came around, Cas bowed in his direction as if to say “take it away.” Dean snatched the microphone from the stand and gave it everything he had. Maybe he was no Freddie, but he wasn’t thinking about being good or bad, he just wanted to let loose. “Are you happy? Are you satisfied? How long can you stand the heat?”
When he ran out of text to read, Dean finally let his attention fixate on the name of the college. Or rather, the location of the college.
“I think…I think I prefer ghosts to demons,” Castiel said, even managing the tiniest glimmer of a smile.
Dean’s smile hurt him more than the probable concussion.  “I know you have, like, five degrees and are smart as hell, but…try and let this one lie? The world just got a whole lot bigger for you, be careful not to get lost in it.”
He’d hoped it might be easier when he finally reached the door, like some sort of clarity would take hold and the path ahead would be lined with yellow bricks. Instead, he felt like he was going to throw up. Shuffling his feet, he steeled his nerves, closing his eyes with one final breath.
“Seemed like the right thing to do, when I did have a hand in everything. I couldn’t let someone like Anna face those kinds of consequences.”
Dean took a long drink of his beer to buy himself time, working up to saying his piece. Why was the word itself so intimidating? It made him feel like a fraud--even if he knew how he felt, it was like he hadn’t
Dean followed Dr. Novak through the museum hallways, keeping pace with the man’s brisk walk. With his white shirt sleeves rolled up to his forearms, tailored vest, and blue plaid tie, Dr. Novak had a professorial look to him that Dean did his best to not study too hard. Instead, he cast his gaze to the art that lined the walls, the glass cases full of history.
“Cas, have you been able to reach Conrad?”
Castiel thought when it was just him left alone in the diner,
“Two grisly deaths at a museum. No suspects, no alarms tripped, no leads.” Dean slapped the newspaper down on the table, keeping his eyes on his brother to watch his reaction.
He slipped on a t-shirt over his briefs and carried his clothes out to the room. Sam stood up from his bed, eager to wash all trace of ghost from his body too. But Dean called his name, back to him as he folded his suit back into his bag. “Do you remember that hunt dad sent me out on when I turned seventeen?” he asked. “First time he ever let me hunt on my own.”
That made Castiel’s smile widen, but it diminished as soon as the next song crashed in. Dean flinched too at the dynamic intro to “Crank That,” and the two of them shared a distasteful look. But then Cas leaned forward. “Hey, I’ve got some shooters in the mini fridge of my room. I can at least vouch for it being quieter than this.”
“So like, the Nativity, Last Supper, Easter…all that?”
He considered bringing up what happened in his latest email to Dean, but he thought about what Dean had said about his own father, and Cas decided to keep it to himself. Dean had become a regular chatterbox, and he hated to say something that might cause him to clam up again. The latest message from him included a raunchy anecdote of a sexual encounter gone wrong when Dean was eighteen, and it gave Cas the laugh he needed to shed the gray thoughts.
He missed his trusty boots and worn-in denim, the suit stifling as he ran. He tugged loose the tie while he searched for any sign of Conrad or the spirit. Heading in the direction of the stage, he passed through the hallway of reliquaries. They’d narrowed down the massive list to sixteen names, but that was still too wide a net to cast. Right now, the priority had to be taking the target out of the picture—if the spirit had nothing to draw its attention, it might buy them enough time to take sixteen down to one.
The question seemed to take Alex aback, and the reaction only intensified the dread rooting in Castiel’s bones. “Yeah…how did--?”
Castiel said his goodbyes and hung up, turning all his attention to the laptop screen.
Even with his face buried in his hands, Castiel couldn’t fight the smile blooming on his face. “I love you, mom,” he finally said.
“Tell me a little about the exhibit?” Dean asked, squinting through the dim light at all the pieces already on display. “I read it’s called Footsteps of Faith?”
The officer, whose daunting eyebrows cut him an intimidating expression, peered behind him at the shivering woman huddled on the steps. When he didn’t immediately respond, Castiel called out “Anna!”
“Thanks, doctor.”
He turned back to her, playfully backhanding her shoulder. “Mom, I’m in my thirties, not in high school.” She didn’t even have to say anything before he added, softer, “Is it that obvious?”
“He does, but I don’t push him,” she said, swirling her wine. “Ever since he got married, he’s kept to himself.” She shook her head, putting a smile back on and laying a hand on his arm. “But you’re here, my love, and I’m so happy to have you. Why don’t you tell me a little more about this fella of yours that’s such a mystery?”
Ice flooded Castiel’s veins. Dean’s voice pounded in his ears, but all he could focus on was the grotesque sight of the
Anna sighed, tucking her hair behind her ear. “Neil. He’s another one of the actors for the interactive exhibit, and he just told me he quit. Not the first, either. And I can’t blame them, can I?”
Alex stayed another half hour as Cas tried to ease his mind and subtly pry for more information. When he finally left and Cas packed up his work to go home, he could only think of one solution.
The long hours in close quarters did little to help the situation, and as they careened down the highway in the dark they had it out again. Dean managed to redirect Sam’s focus toward the case, but it was obvious the conversation was far from over. In the tense silence following their fight, Dean’s cellphone rang. Sam fished it out of the glovebox for him and handed it over, but Dean glanced down from the road to see the number was ‘Unknown.’
Dean eyed a few women in high heels and sleek professional dresses, and a group of men all wearing ties and shiny black Oxfords. “Damn, how dressed up do you need to be to hear about the devil being a dick?”
He finished buttoning his shirt, watching the way Dean avoided his eyes. It was his turn, but he couldn’t bring himself to voice the thoughts in his head. Instead, he scrambled to think of something that would break the fragile tension. “Let’s see, we’ve established that you have a thing for cars, frequent strip clubs, and trouble maintaining romantic partners…I’m going to assume you have a complicated relationship with your father.” It was supposed to a joke, but the way Dean recoiled at the statement made Castiel physically hurt. He shot forward. “I’m sorry, you don’t have to answer that, I didn’t mean—”
Castiel watched as Dean took the sheet of paper and glanced it over, but it didn’t seem to mean much to him. He stood off to the side as Anna cleared off her desk and gathered her things; Cas was probably imagining things, but it felt like Dean was looking anywhere but in his direction. Before he could dwell too much on the thought, he turned back to his binder.
stay in places like this,” Sam said, unable to keep from mimicking Dean’s smile.
“But seriously, Cassie, it’s embarrassing, sure, but shouldn’t you be happy about this instead? You got him talking to you, and there’s some arguably non-heterosexual subtext in there. Sounds like a win/win to me.”
If Castiel thought he had a complicated relationship with faith before, he wasn’t sure that English had an appropriate word to describe the way he felt now. Like a trap door had opened in his soul, and everything he thought he knew fell through.
Castiel inhaled shakily, scrubbing his jaw. Some indecipherable look passed between the agents, and Cas felt out of his depth. But another thought occurred to him, digging the pit deeper. “Agent May—”
“Oh, I know that pregnant pause,” his mother said. “You always did have this needling curiosity and a habit of not leaving well enough alone.” She smiled, reaching out to tap his nose. “But you got that from me, so I can hardly blame you.”
By the time the seminars were done for the day, Castiel hadn’t accomplished much on his own, spending most of the hours being nervous about heading downstairs. Being nervous was ridiculous, he knew, but that didn’t stop him from standing in front of the mirror and third-guessing his outfit. He’d changed into a pair of dark wash jeans, and while he removed his tie, he’d kept his white button up. He untucked the shirt and let it hang, scowled, then tucked it again. He buttoned and unbuttoned the top of the shirt over and over, mussed and straightened his hair, and rolled and unrolled his sleeves.
“Still think I’d make a good hunter?”
Cas raised his eyebrows, drinking like he was supposed to, but then he asked: “Is that it?”
Dean’s throat constricted. “What?”
Castiel opened the door with a disarming smile. “Hello, Dean.”
It was a fair enough observation, but Dean still pursed his lips at being read so plainly from the gate. “Alright, but an easy bet considering you know I spend most of life in motel rooms.” He chugged half the little bottle, making a show of it. “Me next. I assume…you’ve never been to a strip club.”
Alex held his book close to his chest and wove through the desks to the front of the room. The meek behavior was a stark contrast to his normally sunny optimism. Cas was never as perpetually cheery as that, but the kid’s dedication and fascination with his craft reminded him of his own college days. Maybe that’s why seeing Alex so broken hurt so much.
“The cross!”
Dean pressed the towels to Cas’s stomach, careful not to jostle the knife. But he shook his head, allowing a hint of a laugh. “Wait ‘til you take on werewolves.”
Alex kept fidgeting, now chewing on his nails. Castiel let him sit in silence as long as he wanted, letting him come around to the question when he was ready. “What…” He took a deep breath. “What do you believe happens to people after they die?”
“Maybe you did, I wouldn’t know.” Dean looked down at his whiskey, licking his lips as the lightness faded from his voice again. “I really am sorry about the museum gig. I guess Sam and I don’t think enough about what happens to people after they’ve been ‘saved.’”
He might not have guessed it without Dean saying so, but as he looked over at Sam, it made sense. Maybe they didn’t look exactly alike, but he could see the family resemblance in the way they carried themselves. Both of them shouldered this enormous weight with a staggering dignity even if it was rough around the edges. Castiel had only learned the big secret less than an hour ago, and he could feel it threatening to tear him apart. Who knew how long Dean had held that secret like a sickness inside of him?
Once he got started, the rest of his story poured out, and Castiel sat dutifully quiet, listening intently. “I’ve always been close to my dad, but I don’t think he ever really accepted me. I came out after high school, and we had this huge fight. I didn’t talk to him for almost two years when I left for college. Then I went home over summer break this year, and I thought we were patching things up.” He swiped at his eyes again. “But we got into another argument right before the semester started, and I came back to school before we had a chance to smooth it over. He kept calling me and calling me, but I didn’t want to talk to him. Eventually he stopped calling, and I put it in the back of my mind. But not long after I got the word that he was dead, and now—” His voice gave out, and he buried his face in his hands.
Dean clenched his jaw so hard that his teeth hurt. How was he supposed to say no as Castiel bled out on a hotel floor? But if he said yes…that set him on a path he wasn’t sure he could walk. But Castiel’s pleading blue eyes tore at him. “Name the time and place.”
“Enochian,” Cas repeated. “It’s a…celestial language, allegedly the language of angels.”
“I love you, too. Even when you’re embarrassing.”
“Bobby, can I—”
Castiel nodded, extending an arm to direct him toward the right through the gallery. “Yes, it’s been a huge effort that Anna and I have been working on for years. The idea was to showcase art and relics that allowed the viewer to follow the life of Christ from His conception to His ascension, and all the lives He touched while he walked the earth. We’ve petitioned churches and other museums for hundreds of artifacts. God only knows how many letters I’ve written the Vatican.”
The grin burned through him, to where he almost missed the wink and the gun salute that accompanied it.
Dean heard Sam sprinting through the laboratory not far ahead. When he emerged into the wide open room, he saw his brother’s silhouette scrambling around in the dark. The exit toward the museum exhibits was to the left, but Sam disappeared to the right.
“Not checking out this early, are you?”
“Even Nick?” Cas asked. “Doesn’t he still live around here?”
had some shady hotel sex.”
the security footage that must show us all being thrown around like rag dolls. I don’t suppose the fake FBI has any plans about that?” The deadpan humor of the words contrasted the sincerity of the gesture, and that seemed to put Dean more at ease.
Since I’m sure you were in unbearable suspense since my last email, I must inform you that things did not work out with Art Gallery Man. We went on a few dates, but we just have a few irreconcilable differences. Namely, he’s an insufferable vainglorious narcissist and I’m not him, so I just don’t think I could ever live up to his standards. Aside from being grateful for being rid of him, I’m relieved it didn’t work out. Even before his true colors started to bleed through, I found myself hoping something would go wrong. Maybe I should talk to my therapist about why I’m engaging in self-sabotage.
Out in the night, Dean took a few gulps of the fresh air. The lights of the city hardly allowed it to feel dark, but he drowned in the neon lights like it was an abyss. Sam was only a call away, but his hands wouldn’t pick up the phone. As terrified as he was of turning around, he knew that if he didn’t go back, Castiel would be one more regret to take the grave.
“Well, now you’ve gone and jinxed it.” Dean threw up his hands in mock exasperation. “I’ll start looking into the history of the other disciples, see if there’s any pattern to the deaths.”
“We’re just working a couple of leads at the moments. Everything helps.”
“More than likely.”
Anna has sent me a few job applications with some connections of hers. I’ve just let them sit unopened in my email for days. Part of me knows that it’s irresponsible, but another part knows that I won’t ever be able to return to a life like that. Sitting at the same desk, day in and day out, for years? You’ve ruined mundanity for me.
“I won’t lie to you, it can be pretty ripe,” Dean said. “But that’s the game: salt and burn the bones.”
“Cas, do you hear me?” Dean yelled over the gathering wind. He jostled him again and Castiel finally blinked his shock away, concentrating instead on Dean’s intense stare.
There will always be a little part of mind that hopes that you are okay out there, but I think this is a good time to admit to myself that this is enough. Best of luck, Dean.
Cas chewed on his thumbnail, letting his own thoughts percolate. His gut said the same as Anna, but the alternative motives were far more unsettling to ponder.
They hovered around New England for the next few days, scouring the papers and the news for any hints of another case. Sam still managed to leave his laptop open and unattended every now and again. He took lengthy walks to the vending machine or spent an uncharacteristically long time in the shower, giving Dean the opportunity and privacy to check his email without either of them having to say a word.
century occultists and mathematicians, Enochian provides us a lens through which we’re able to deliberate symbolic, cultural influence. Rather than argue over the authenticity of their claims, to debate angels and demons or man, I encourage you to instead approach Enochian as theoretical, linguistic artwork. Beauty, as they say, is in the eye of the beholder—perhaps truth lies within the mind of the interpreter. Thank you.”
“I’m feeling pretty confident in my twenty bucks, but there’s all kinds of old shit in there. How are we gonna figure out which old shit has a bone to pick with actors?”
“Well, not an angel itself, assuming that’s even a thing. But there were tons of saints and other religious figures that claimed angels talked to them, gave them orders or guidance,” Sam said.
The seats squeaked as Sam shifted forward, resting his elbows on the back of the front seat. “I don’t understand why this is literally the hill you’re willing to die on,” Sam said, the hint of an edge in his voice. “As long as it’s been you and me, we always fight to do the right thing. To find the way that saves people. I can’t believe that there’s a world where saving you isn’t the right thing.”
“Not to make you feel un-special, but this line of work gives us lots of ‘cousins,’” Sam said with a half-smile. He looked over at his brother, but Dean was looking at the floor, the wall, the monitors—anywhere but at Cas.
He knocked.
“Nice plants,” Dean said after a few silent minutes had elapsed.
Castiel let the silence stretch on, aching for Dean to meet him halfway. Him showing up at the hotel again, now here, it renewed the hope that had been quashed when he walked out the door. He hoped it meant something, but even standing at the foot of his bed, Dean felt too far away.
“Come on, dude, these past few days have been…weird. I can tell something’s up.” Sam wiped his hands on his napkin before cocking one knee and resting his arm on it. Dean had to give him credit for trying to bring it up as casually as possible. Sam was a smart guy; the chances that he hadn’t at least made an educated guess on what was happening were slim.
The end of October rolled around, and Sam came to him with a case in Maple Springs, New York. Things with Sam were tense lately now that they’d fixed the Colt. Bobby did his best not to take sides, and he knew better than to jump the gun without a fully idealized plan, but Dean knew that he was working with Sam to try and find a way to terminate the contract. Messing around with the deal and losing Sam again as a result terrified Dean, so he did what he did best and put up a wall. Sam did everything in his power to tear it down, but Dean was too practiced to let it go that easily. Instead, they set off to New York with the mood between them prickly and ready to blow.
A nurse hurried into his room, making note of his vitals on one of the screens. “Mr. Novak, glad to see you awake,” she said. She messed with some of the equipment, though Castiel could only guess its purpose. “How are you feeling?”
With a sniff, Dean swiped his hand across his nose and finally turned around, forcing his expression neutral. “It’s nothing,” he said. “Just all this religious crap made me think of it. For a people that preach peace and love, they can do some pretty messed up shit, huh?”
His blood running cold, Castiel scrambled for something to say. “I don’t think you’re crazy, Alex,” he finally said. “Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Even if they sound strange.”
Dean flopped his limbs across the couch. “Ugh, we haven’t been on a case in weeks. I’m bored.”
“Don’t worry,” Castiel assured her. “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll do most of the talking if you want, as much as I can anyway.”
“Cousins, huh?” he joked, making a brief attempt to sit up, but he quickly abandoned the idea.
“You’ll see; we’re up second,” Castiel told him. He grabbed his drink and swiveled around so he could watch the show, crossing one knee over the other.
“Are we even allowed to do that?” Sam joked, unfolding his frame from the car.
“Man, don’t jinx it.” The car doors creaked shut, and Dean plodded into the motel room, yanking off his tie. He called dibs on the shower and finally shed his suit, dropping it into a heap on the floor. The water ran scalding hot, but he stepped in anyway, letting it run like cleansing fire over his skin. He scrubbed at his face, closing his eyes and facing up into the stream.
When they sat down in Castiel’s office, Alex bounced his knee, still avoiding eye contact. Cas kicked the door stop, propping it open before he made his way to his desk. “So, what can I do for you, Alex?” he asked, keeping his tone light.
“Some of those pieces are incredibly valuable, but nothing’s been stolen so far. Do you think this is about money?” He flipped the binder open, trailing a finger down the page until he found what he was looking for, then he clicked open a blank document on the computer.
, which took Dean on a tangent for fifteen minutes, intrigued.
“That must be your guys there,” Hester said, her gaze now fixed somewhere over his shoulder.
“Oh, well yeah, some, but that’s just grunt work mostly, you know? Compared to the, what? Twelve years of grind you had to go through.” He sniffed, brushing his nose with the pad of his thumb.
“What, you want all the juicy details?” Dean deflected.
Absently, Castiel thought about Dean acting in the stead of a guardian angel. The idea almost made him laugh, but he pushed it down and returned to his work. Flipping through his notes, it felt like he had all the pieces, he just had to fit them together in order to understand the picture they were creating.
“Because I think I like the guy, okay? Because I like…guys. Happy?” Dean closed his eyes, regretting his tone as soon as it escaped him. Sam didn’t do anything to deserve being bitched at.
“Not if we can help it. Do you have their numbers? It would be best for them all to avoid the museum for a while,” Sam said.
Then he was gone, the door shut behind him.
In spite of the grim situation, Cas sat down on his bed with a smile, his stomach fluttering. “I’m sorry to call so late,” he said. “I hope you know I wouldn’t bother you if it wasn’t for a good reason.”
The wheezing of the printer interrupted their quiet symphony, and Castiel rolled over to fetch the contents, several pages long. When he stood to staple them together, Dean hastily clicked out of the tab and turned his attention over to the documents as Castiel set them on the desk before him.
Cas bit his lip, shaking his head. “Cute, but we haven’t started yet.” He plucked one of the shooters from the pile and cracked it open, Dean following suit. “Okay…so despite your snide comment, I assume you have
“Then this might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship?” Castiel supplied with a sly smile.
“Hey,” he said, brushing a stray tear from his cheek. “Any chance you’ve got space in the guest room this week?”
Once he spoke it, once he made it real, there would be no more rationalizing it away. And Dean didn’t know if he was ready for that. Admitting to one thing meant owning it all, and the tangled web he was stuck in wasn’t going to make that an easy task. The booming rock pumping from the radio pushed the sticky thoughts from his mind.
“Friend of yours?” Dean asked.
They sat down with the finished casserole, and Castiel was warmed through by the smell of the garlic and creamy egg noodles. The old favorite recipe kept the emptiness of the house at bay, and he shoveled it down, filling his bowl with seconds.
“You did everything you could,” he assured her. He waited a beat. “You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to, but I’m here for you.”
Cas fidgeted while Dean seemed intent on staring a hole through the table. “Is he, um, still around?”
He’d stood over the graves of those two nuns, watching their bones burn, feeling a part of himself go up in flames with them.
“Well, I’m honored to join the family,” Castiel returned, “but just as a suggestion, I feel like the initiation should include a little less bodily harm.”
“I need you back at the hotel,” he said sharply.
Cas wrung his hands, wanting desperately to be able to lay his burdens at their feet and forget about it, but his initial misgivings came back to him. Something about this didn’t feel right.
“Move, move, move!” Sam bellowed, charging to the front to meet the spirit head on.
At last, he cleared his throat, rising to his feet with the pictures clutched in his hands. The boys looked up, all ears. “So, Enochian’s tricky,” he began, coming out from behind his desk to approach their side of the room, “it’s not exactly a direct translation, but my best interpretation would be that it means ‘false witness.’ But sort of like a label? A scarlet letter, you could say.”
It’s crossed my mind that you might find these emails annoying, pathetic even. Perhaps they do highlight my loneliness a little more than I’d like to admit, but I confess that it’s cathartic to write these to you. It’s like keeping a journal, or writing a newspaper column for an audience of one.
Castiel did his best to look mad, but he was far from successful. “You might as well keep drinking, because I assume you’re the type of guy who refers to his car as a ‘she.’”
“Dr. Milton is getting us a list of all the actors you’re employing; until we can look at that, do you mind getting us a copy of all the names of people whose remains are on display as part of the new exhibit?” Sam asked. Dean had to give him credit for no-bullshit way he framed questions like that. Again, the badge gave them a lot of leeway, but sometimes they had to ask some insane favors.
“Let’s get it down to one,” Dean said. “Sammy!” Out of breath and harried, Sam looked over from where he was hauling Conrad up. “Buy us a couple minutes, we’ve almost got him!” He dropped the crowbar on the floor and gave it a hard kick in Sam’s direction.
“Nothing, nevermind. It’s my turn, isn’t it?”
The question took him off guard, and he fought the urge to react with incredulity. Of the two of them, Anna had always been the more grounded one—sometimes literally with her archaeology background. For her to wonder about something as implausible as magical influence, whatever she’d seen must have really shaken her.
“Is that a brand, or?”
As much as he loved reading Cas’s poetic musings and daily commentary, the drunk email at two in the morning was by far his favorite. Something about it was pure in its unfiltered glory, typos and all. He’d be lying though if he said part of it wasn’t the validation that Cas wanted him over some other guy. Because he couldn’t deny to himself the flare of jealousy when he read about the dates they went on. Then to hear that Cas was relieved they broke up because he wished he could have Dean? Dean’s masculinity flinched at the term ‘butterflies’ but there was no other way to describe it.
The silence stretched between them, but finally Castiel cracked a grin, just the corner of his mouth quirking up. “That was almost a poem,” he said. “Maybe I’m not the only with a rambling soul.”
“I’m sorry if I don’t find the exploitation of women to be attractive,” Castiel said drily. “And having learned that you apparently do, I assume you’ve never had a relationship last longer than…let’s say six months.”
“You know I love you, but you emailed this man incessantly for months with no reply, but one drunk message with the vaguest hint of romance has you embarrassed now?” she said.
“The what?”
Sam blinked up at him at the mention of ‘bone.’ “Did Dr. Novak show you the reliquaries?” he asked.
“Cool,” Dean said flatly, rolling his shoulders. “Stoning.”
“I think I always knew,” he continued, turning the wrapper over in his hands, “but once dad sort of caught on, well…” He didn’t say anymore, and he knew he didn’t have to.
Sam waited in the courtyard, and he jogged over to meet Dean when he finally made his way out of the hotel. “What’s going on?”
“Time is never on our side, Sam. It’s always running out.”
It was much shorter than Cas’s other messages, but Dean figured he deserved that. It’d taken him hours to compose that one sentence, though. He’d trashed a full-length essay, workshopped ten different versions of ‘please don’t give up on me,’ and spent twenty minutes on thesaurus.com looking for alternatives for the word ‘date’ before he decided to throw caution to wind.
Cold sweat pricked the back of his neck, and he knew at once what Sam had done. But his brother slept, sprawled out on the other bed, still breathing. A reckless hope sprang to mind before he quashed it down, terrified to give it life. Instead, he let his observation go unspoken, waiting for Sam to bring it up, to confess, to confide. But their irascible silence stretched on, and as glaringly obvious as the missing bullet was, neither of them seemed intent on being the one to bring it up first.
Dean finally spun around to join in on the chorus, feeling freer than he had since Cold Oak. As much fun as he had with Sam in Atlantic City, that felt like a countdown, ticking off final moments before he would have to leave his brother for good. But this was just something to do because he felt like doing it—Cas had no idea he was living on borrowed time so Dean didn’t have to feel like every second had to mean something deeper.
to the sound of the beat.”
“Cousins…?” he wondered. He had quite a few, but who would have told them about his accident this fast? And they all lived in places far from Salt Lake City at least.
Dean fished around in his pocket until he pulled out a scrap of paper. He tapped it against his fingers a few times, walking slowly over to set it on Castiel’s side table. “That’s my emergency number, and an email. If you ever need anything.” He emphasized ‘emergency’ just a little too strong, but Castiel got the message all the same.
He clicked ‘reply.’ “Not on your life, Dean Winchester.”
As Castiel watched him go, he wondered how it was that every time Dean walked out the door, it felt like the final time.
He drew blanks on the others, and whatever Dean needed an answer for, he figured he wanted more than a thirty-three percent shot. But without his computer, he didn’t know how he was going to figure it out.
“Alright,” Dean said with a bob of his head. “Anyone shows up, we’ll have eyes on ‘em, no worries.” As if to demonstrate his point, Dean adjusted his chair so he had a better view of the window.
“Not off the top of my head, but…” He turned back to his computer and punched in a quick search. He scrolled through a few results, scanning the information quickly as a pit formed in his stomach. “It’s not historically certain,” he concluded, “but there are theories that he was attacked and impaled with spears.”
Castiel waved to the security guard posted outside the closed wing of the museum. “I’m going to show the agent around the exhibit; we shouldn’t be long.”
“I look forward to it,” Cas said. He gave them a nod before stepping around and continuing toward the elevator.
you’d like to go first?” Dean asked.
Under any other circumstances, Castiel would be thrilled at the idea of putting his hobby to practical use. But the idea that someone was using angels to justify murder made him sick to his stomach. The rune burned onto the flesh of Ezekiel and Jonah had all the hallmarks of Enochian, but it wasn’t a particular word he could name. He pulled out two different notebooks from a drawer in his desk and flattened them open.
Cas opened the door wider, and Dean crossed the threshold, hands in his pockets. With the door shut, Castiel slipped around Dean and into the kitchenette. “I’m glad you’re here,” he said, splaying his hands on the counter.
The ghost stared straight past him, still intent on Conrad like Dean wasn’t even there. It reached out a hand, tilting its head in a sickly motion. “You are not deserving to walk the path of the holy, deceiver.”
He looked over to where Sam was sitting with Conrad several yards away. Conrad had taken a heavier beating, tossed around and battered, but he would be alright too. The memories of the night would scar far worse than any physical injury.
“Dean,” Castiel said sharply, dipping his head until he caught Dean’s eye. “I can’t imagine the burden you and brother carry. You give so much of yourself to this job, and you’re only one person. You
“I think I should have figured this out when you told me you were an FBI impersonating ghost hunter, but... you’re insane.”
The two men stood straighter as they were addressed, and they both flashed their badges with a practiced flourish. The tall one spoke first: “Yes, we’re looking for Anna Milton? I’m Agent May, this is my partner, Agent Bulsara.”
When the door shut behind him, Castiel let out a breath and ran his hands through his hair. “You met him yesterday, Cas,” he said to himself. “And you thought he was a tool, get a hold of yourself.” He turned back to his task, flipping to the next page in the binder.
“I never saw anything personally, but they said none of the alarms were tripped, and the video itself just goes to static right before they’re killed. Which is perplexing since the museum spends a lot of money on the security system.” Castiel hugged his arms around himself, the creeping dread settling in his stomach the longer they stood around.
As if on cue, the side doors to the museum crashed open as the EMTs guided a stretcher covered in a white sheet toward the waiting ambulance. They watched them load it in and shut the doors with an alarming finality. Castiel kept his arm around Anna’s shoulders, and she sniffled, wiping her eyes.
“That’s a good start,” Castiel said. He extended his hand. “Nice to re-meet you, Dean Bulsara.”
Cas folded his hands on his desk, looking over to the window where most of the potted sprouts reached for the sun. “Thank you. Anna thinks it’s silly, but I feel…comforted knowing I’m keeping something alive in a place surrounded by things that are dead. Art and history are beautiful, timeless in a manner of speaking…and when you work in a place like this it’s all too easy to forget that life keeps going all around you. Taking care of them helps me remember that.”
“St. John, St. Isidore, St. Gerard, Paschal, Hamon, Stanislaus, Francisco…” he read under his breath, squeezing his eyes shut as he tried to recall what he knew about them. “Francisco is too young, he died as a child from the flu epidemic. Um, John Bosco died in the late 1800’s, well into his old age I think.”
Castiel pulled his keys out of his pocket. “Would some cheese curds possibly help?”
“Well, surely you have some experience if you qualify as a special agent for the FBI,” Castiel said.
Dean let the word knock around in his head freely instead of stamping it down. This was how he began to clear the ash and finally let things grow again. One email at a time.
“Except what?”
“What?!” Conrad wheezed. “I—James, but—”
But Cas, even with the distance Dean put between them, was now faced with this world a third time, and Dean couldn’t ignore the sinking feeling that it wouldn’t be the last time either. He finally fell into a restless sleep, plagued with thoughts turned to dreams of Castiel plummeting into darkness.
“There’s plenty for you to do around here,” Bobby reminded him, gesturing out the window with his thumb. “Grab a wrench and take your pick.”
“Dean, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to make y—”
Castiel took his hand back, cupping both of them around his glass. “You think I earned that art degree with crayons?”
Dean could tell Castiel was wavering, but he braced himself for the disappointment of being turned down. But Cas took a deep breath and scrubbed his face. “Fine,” he said at last, “but I get to pick the song.”
“Nothing looked out of the ordinary. And there’s so many, who knows where to start?”
It felt like he missed the punchline of some macabre joke. Enochian brands, human remains, murdered thespians? It must add up to something, but Cas definitely wasn’t getting the math. Did they think the killer was already here in the building? That was a sobering thought, but he didn’t understand how they could have known. Or what Conrad’s arrival tipped them off about. He stood rooted to the spot, doubts and worries coursing through his brain.
In spite of himself, Castiel found himself smiling at that, thinking it would be a lot easier to keep up a hard front if the man wasn’t so damn handsome. He’d tried not to notice it before, when he was sticking up for Anna, when they were talking about murder, but Dean had a face that artists dreamed about. “They, um, don’t sell alcohol here,” he said.
“Keeps things interesting,” Dean agreed. “Most nights it’s a toss up between sleeping in a bed someone died in or had shady sex in.”
“Can I ask you something?” Cas said.
The demon spoke with Castiel’s mouth, but it was so distinctly not Cas that Dean berated himself for not noticing sooner. “You’re here, aren’t you?” it mocked, bobbing its head. “He’s involved with
From the opposite side of the gallery, Conrad’s scream cut through the night. “What the FUCK just happened!?”
Before he could stop himself, Castiel reached out and wrapped his hand around Dean’s wrist. Dean didn’t pull away, but the touch put him on edge; Castiel could feel how taut his body was, on the edge of flight. “I know you won’t listen if I ask you to stay,” he said, “but just…don’t close the door when you leave, okay?” He squeezed gently, hoping that Dean understood.
“Tell that to your brothers,” she said. “They have a little too much of their father in them for their own good. Your sisters make a point to visit at least once a year, but I don’t see much of the boys anymore.”
But he did.
“Shut up.”
Castiel scoffed, sitting back up. “What made you assume that? The gay or the art degree?”
“What’d you find out?” Dean asked, closing the office door behind him. The hallway was empty, but he and Sam still kept their voices down.
Winchester.”
But he blinked back his surprise, tempering his voice to its usual gentle timbre. “None of this is your fault—or
Thumping his head back against the window rather than acknowledge the tears forming at the corners of his eyes, Dean tried to find a way to put it into words. “I’ve got a matter of months left, Sammy,” he said, “and I know--
When he realized he actually sent the garbled mess of drunken babbling that morning, he was ready to disappear into the ether. It took every ounce of willpower to send the follow up without pulverizing the whole computer before or after. And now he had Dean’s reply to process too? The great unending beyond looked more and more appealing by the minute.
“I don’t blame you for what happened,” Castiel said slowly. He meant it. Despite their friendship’s incredibly short tenure, Cas couldn’t bring himself to believe Dean had a malicious bone in his body. Misguided, angry, hurting maybe. But at his core, he knew Dean wanted to help people, to save them. And Cas knew enough to see that when Dean failed to do that, it ate away at him, piece by piece.
“Part of the process, I guess?”
“Give me some time, but I’ll get it to you as soon as I can.” He turned to go, meeting Dean’s eyes first and giving him a nod. “Dean.”
“Dean,” Castiel called after him, turning around in his seat. Dean paused at the door. “It’s Cas.”
This time, Dean started to look away, but he brought himself back, and Castiel tried to immortalize that expression in his mind: some unbearable softness choking underneath a hardened shell, but reaching for the light all the same. If he had to make a guess, it would be that Dean hardly ever let himself feel anything, and maybe some days in this life he led that was for the better, but there was a part of him deep down screaming to heard.
Dean cracked his knuckles one at a time, taking a few extra seconds to think of a response as he just reveled in hearing that voice again. “Not great stats there, no. Does that mean you have good news for me?”
Castiel thought. Plain brown robes. “Hamon!” he shouted. “It’s Hamon!” He and Dean read frantically, every second passing feeling a little more like failure. The sinking feeling that Hamon was one of the few displays they hadn’t prepped yet, therefore still sitting back in the labs, started weighing on him.
“Leave him alone; he’s got nothing to do with this,” Dean said slowly, a hand held out like he was trying to calm a wild animal. His mind raced for options: exorcism, holy water, salt. Time consuming, painful, not enough.
“No, it’s not—” Dean ripped the door open and clenched his jaw, steeling himself to look up at Cas. When he did, Castiel saw the sorrow spilling over, its flood masking the fear underneath. “I just can’t.”
Castiel creased his eyebrows. “Certainly.”
“Does he not like you?”
“Damn it,” he said aloud, the adrenaline starting to flood his veins. He shook out his hands, rolling his neck. “No risk, no reward.” He took off to the left.
“Sure, sure…drink up, nerd.”
“So…we came for…?”
“Is everything okay?” Anna asked when they were out of earshot. “You’re suddenly being very cagey.”
“What makes my happiness more important than yours? Why don’t you deserve those things too?”
Sam was still tapping away at his computer when Dean answered the call of his pillow. The tension in the room was still palpable, and Dean didn’t think that would make Sam amenable to letting him check his email. Cas hadn’t called back since they had driven into New York, and Dean took that as a sign that his case was going well.
“Please, Sam.”
Careful to keep his papers in hand, he stepped in and gave Dean a hug. It seemed to take him by surprise, but after a second he returned the hug with two quick thumps on the back. Cas pulled away, shifting his things so he could offer a handshake to Sam. “It’s good to see you guys; what brings you all the way out here?”
Dean didn’t answer, but the sudden cut of the music caught them both off guard. A voice on a microphone spoke out, and Castiel searched the room until he noticed a woman on a small stage at the opposite end of the lounge.
“Holding up?” Dean asked, lowering himself to sit on the step beside him.
“Yeah,” Dean leaned into it, clasping his hands behind his back and casting a cursory glance at the clock on the wall, “we’re looking for the ballroom. I believe the panel we’re interested in begins in about half an hour.” He smiled.
There was a beat of silence on the other end, like Castiel hadn’t anticipated an answer. But then Dean’s cheeks burned at the sound of a soft laugh. “I suppose I shouldn’t blame you for expecting the worst,” Cas said. “I guess you probably don’t get a lot of good news from phone calls like this.”
“You’re not really selling me on this.”
people have died, Castiel,” she said, fingers tightening around her glass. “No, they’ve been
“Yeah,” Castiel answered, “you too.”
“I am not nearly intoxicated enough to make a fool of myself like that—” Castiel stopped talking as Dean fished out some cash and slapped it on the bar.
“Anything you need,” Dean assured him, an almost tender tone to his voice before he cleared his throat and the gruffness was back. “I’ll talk to you later.”
“Sleep in the car, I got twenty bucks on ghost, come on.”
“That’s Agent Bulsara to you,” Dean retorted, starting to tap his heel to the count.
“Yeah, hopefully that just means we can get to the bottom of this sooner. We’ll all be able to rest easier once they figure out who did this.”
A crawl of headlights in the window diverted his attention. This time, the light was turning into the lot. The sun had dipped too far below the horizon for him to make out the driver’s face, but a part of him just knew all the same. “Conrad.”
“Finding out the guy was murdered instead of dying by suicide is still a pretty big deal,” Dean said. “Maybe it wasn’t enough to send him into the great beyond, but don’t let yourself think it was nothing.”
There was another creak as Sam settled back into the bench, irritated that they were going in circles. “Right now we still have time on our side; we should use it.”
…any truth to that?”
“Reliquaries. Dr. Milton mentioned that a big part of the new exhibit was a bunch of pieces, literally: bones of the apostles, teeth from saints, hair and clothes. All kinds of human remains.”
Dean’s hand froze halfway to his open mouth, the tone in Castiel’s voice striking some long undisturbed chord in him. He looked down at the man, who stared back at him with rigid determination despite the fear still evident behind his eyes. “No, it’s not,” he said, the answer coming out sounding something like regret.
“I’m literally on it right now, Dean,” Sam said from the dining room table.
“You know what he said? Some good advice.”
As he climbed out of the shower and toweled off, he stared down his reflection in the mirror. The face looking back at him seemed too young and too old all at once, the eyes having seen more than should but not enough. He heard his dad’s voice in his head: “I put too much on your shoulders. I made you grow up too fast.” And yet, those words from the same man that sent him to Riverton, Wyoming all on his own.
“What about the first victim? Was he found in this wing as well?” Dean asked, joining Castiel on the other side of the tape.
Pressing a hand to the glass, Castiel let out a breath. The silver reliquary was modest compared to some of the ornate gold and jeweled boxes or painted busts. Shaped like a cross and engraved with various religious symbols, it could fit in the palm of his hand. “Dean,” he said, “I found h—”
“Shoot.”
But Sam let it slide off, just nodding slowly. “Have you always—I mean, did you ever…you know, before Cas?”
They tossed their meager belongings in the Impala and Dean pulled around front while Sam took care of check out. Dean watched his brother trudge back to the car and couldn’t help feeling like Sam’s shoulders slumped with an unseen burden. They’d go on pretending like everything was okay until they couldn’t anymore—that was their way. And Sam was right: Dean had made a selfish call, but it was one he was ready to live with.
Shifting in his seat, he squeezed her free hand. “I promise I came back for more than boy advice,” he said. “I know it’s been too long since I’ve come to visit.”
Hello, Dean,
“Don’t do that to yourself,” Castiel chided her softly. He spared a polite smile for the waiter as they dropped off the cheese curds. “You couldn’t have known—”
He fiddled with a button on his vest as he strode past the spotty groups of attendees who didn’t spare him a glance. It was a grim twist of fate that museum attendance had actually spiked since the murders; Castiel supposed it only proved that there was no such thing as bad press. A guilty knot tightened in his stomach for even considering an up side to all of this. But the fact remained that with the new exhibit on hold while the investigations panned out, Castiel’s career could use any saving grace it could manage.
Dean raised an eyebrow at the terse reply. “Of course. Gotta get the show back on the road.”
For a moment, a fond smile broke through the cloudy skies of Anna’s expression. “You’re sweet, Cas. But your protective side is bordering on smothering—I didn’t get a word in out there, and I can look after myself.”
Cas, it seemed, had turned into quite the Sherlock Holmes, his emails recounting his work on the case with Alex reading like a serial. What the police had ruled a suicide, Castiel surmised to be coercion. He dug up information on the father’s job, part of their family-owned business. He collected old gossip about the souring of the relationship between Alex’s father and his siblings. He pieced together news reports and rumors of his death, comparing it to stories he had coaxed out of the family. While it may not have been enough admissible evidence to bring the matter to court, Castiel appeared to have drawn his own conclusions. But what stuck with Dean the most was that he’d done all of it on his own--without fake badges, called in connections, or an arsenal of weaponry. With just his wit, resourcefulness, and a healthy dose of charisma, Castiel had taken an open and shut case and at least given everyone a reason to second guess.
“On my way.”
Castiel shook his head. “The inverted cross is actually called ‘the Cross of St. Peter.’ When he was sentenced to death, Peter asked to be crucified upside down because he didn’t think he was worthy to die in the same way that Jesus did. The occult connotation is more of a modern association, but—” He shook his head again, this time to gather his thoughts. “Why would—do you think someone is killing people based on their characters?”
“Don’t say that like it’s a negative trait,” he said, “as if being loud and boisterous is fundamentally superior.”
Dean didn’t buy for a second that Sam was going to let the situation lie, but he’d cross that bridge when they came to it. For the time being, it was enough to let the familiar routine take over. The motels, roadside diners, long stretches of open road, the rush of the hunt, the wash of relief when the job was done. It was a song Dean had memorized, and he could carry the tune without much of a second thought. It was the kind of autopilot he needed to keep from thinking about how terrified he was.
“It’s kind of complicated?” Cas shrugged. “Just like the other times, the security footage was ruined, so they didn’t have anyone they could implicate with direct proof. But without an arrest made for the killings, there wasn’t anyone to pin the damage on either. And with all the broken displays and the destruction of the relic, the museum had to make some kind of statement.”
“Thank you,” Castiel said with an amused squint. “And you, agent? Anyone at home waiting for you to come back with another successful case?” He asked mostly out of polite courtesy, but he was surprised at how relieved he was when Dean answered in the negative.
“That’s the thing—I don’t know. He’s…a mystery,” Castiel said, propping his chin in his hands as he watched the trees whiz by.
“It’s okay, mom. If I’m honest, it’s a little strange coming back to the text itself again. Working the curator job for so many years, I was just surrounded by what it inspired. It was easy enough to keep things separated in my mind that way, only having to deal with the relics and the paintings and the artifacts. But…reading the book now, yeah, it’s hard not to think of dad.” Cas brought his fist to his mouth, not expecting to confront those feelings in his attempts to avoid feelings about Dean, but a very poignant sadness washed over him anyway.
“Well…no. I mean, I’m alright, but I think—I’m worried I might have another case on my hands.” He quickly explained what happened with Alex, telling him about the signs and similarities to the ghost back at the museum.
“No.”
I’m trying not to count the days since I emailed you first, always reminding myself that there’s a chance you’ll never respond. And that’s okay—but I like to think you’re reading these wherever you are.
Sam chewed the inside of his cheek, then turned and grabbed his jacket again. “I’m gonna see if I can find a library.”
He opened the door and put a hand to his forehead, then swept his fingers through his dark hair. “I’m so sorry. I know I just said I wouldn’t leave you alone, but something feels off about them. Especially Agent Bulsara. I didn’t like the way he was looking at you.”
“What?”
The dark, mussed hair, the guileless blue eyes, the awkward smile.
Propping one arm on the back of the chair, Cas leaned over to point at the sections of the list. “So, the first part is the individual’s name, then their designation, followed by the type of remains we have, and lastly the method of display or containment,” he explained. “I know where most things are if you need to look at something, but if you need ID numbers or anything, just let me know.”
Thank you so much for reading!
Castiel thought back to the museum, to all the telltale signs that the Winchesters looked for. “In those moments where you think you see him, does the room feel…colder?”
“You’d think that would be good for your business,” Castiel joked. He knelt down at the mini fridge and loaded up with as many shooters as he could fit in his palms. He dumped them all on the coffee table, and he and Dean both set to standing them back up.
This wing of the building with all the labs and storage had a distinctly industrial atmosphere, and he and Anna had done their best to counteract that, making the office feel as much like home as they could. Of course, they had their diplomas and awards featured over their desks, but they also hung replicas of some of their favorite pieces: Castiel’s soft, sweeping landscapes and billowing robed angels, and Anna’s bright abstracts and muted Impressionists. Each of them displayed pictures of their family, and Castiel tended to a host of plants on his side of the office. They draped table runners over the sideboards, spruced the shelves with statuettes and little framed sayings or jokes they’d printed out, and stuck kitschy magnets all over the side of the filing cabinets.
Dean already had his phone out to call 911, but he took Castiel’s reaching hand as he pushed himself to his knees. “Don’t move,” he told him. “I’m gonna get you help.” When the operator answered, he gave the information, then hung up and dialed Sam.
“Feels like longer sometimes,” Castiel acquiesced with a long-suffering sigh. “My Bachelor’s is in Fine Arts, and I studied painting mostly. But I always loved art as a culture—I enjoy making art, but what I’m passionate about is seeing how it affects people, inspires them, brings them together. It’s so fundamentally…human, the way we are driven to express ourselves and grapple with concepts beyond our understanding through art.” He caught up to himself, suddenly shy, and he rubbed the back of his neck. “Which is just a flowery way of saying I went to get my Master’s in Art History, which is how I found my way into museums. From there, I pursued my doctorate in religious iconography, and my thesis was mostly to do with Biblical studies.” He felt his cheeks further redden when he realized Dean had listened with rapt attention, taking in every word.
“You should.” Dean’s reply was abrupt, sharp. Any slivers of light that had slipped through his walls the night before were shored back up, and Castiel closed out.
There was silence on the other end, and for a few terrible seconds Cas was afraid he was going to hang up. But then, softer: “Cas…hey.”
His stomach churned as it dialed, but then a voice answered, “Cassie?” and he immediately felt peace wash over him.
He peeled a few bills from his wallet and tossed them down on the counter. “Thanks for the recommendation, doc,” he said. “I’ll be seeing you tomorrow.” He clapped Castiel on the shoulder as he stood.
“Let’s get to safety before we start asking the hard-hitting questions,” Dean told him.
When Dean returned with two disposable coffee cups and an armful of vending machine snacks, Castiel was still plugging away at his list. His dark hair appeared more unruly, but it suited him in a way. It gave the rest of his crisp, put-together image a wild edge, like there was an untamed spirit just waiting to break free of its vessel.
Getting drunk again to distract himself from the torrent of emotions swirling inside him was only a little appealing, but the headache convinced him to reach for a glass of water instead. As he drank deeply, a tiny voice in the back of his head wanted to celebrate—
“Yeah, I mean I’m pretty sure ‘thou shalt not kill’ is one of God’s big rules. Why would an angel go around killing people?”
He held the words on his tongue, felt the static in the air between them, and let the suggestion die on his lips.
Dean ran his tongue over his teeth, staring down into his lap. “I knew Cas was going to be here,” he managed, the next part sticking in his throat, but he pushed on. “And I wanted to see him.”
“Castiel,” Dean said, rolling the name around on his tongue like he was tasting a new food. “Do you mind if I call you Cas?”
Sam furrowed his brow as he rolled up the paper and tucked it under his arm. “Listen, I agreed to the whole ‘one last ride’ thing, but you don’t gotta bring it up every five minutes.”
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel said, dropping his shoulders like that was the saddest thing he’d ever heard. “You’re lucky the Queen song I picked was ‘Another One Bites the Dust’ and not ‘I’m in Love With My Car.’”
The hotel bar was lit like a nightclub lounge, the walls cast in vibrant blue hues, and the bar lit up from underneath in gold. Instead of blaring music though, ambient soft rock played over the speakers. Castiel scanned the tables and rich leather armchairs for any sign of the Winchesters, but most were occupied by larger groups, probably more conference attendees. When he didn’t spot them at the bar either, he claimed a stool for himself and ordered something fruity while he waited.
“Almost exactly,” he said, voice rough. He walked over and wrapped an arm around his mother’s shoulders, letting her lead him inside.
“Hey, that’s not fair.” Dean held up his hand, then shrugged. “Well, the relationship part is true, but I respect women.”
“Of course. How can I help?”
“I’ll see about setting up a place for us to work. Meet back here in thirty?”
They found seats at the counter and ordered a large platter of the locally famous curds to share, and Anna stared down into her glass of water like she was trying to drown her thoughts in it. Castiel struggled to find something to say, but he was spared any further agonizing when she finally spoke, soft as a whisper: “Do you think we’re cursed?”
