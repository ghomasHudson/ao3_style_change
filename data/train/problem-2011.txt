“I don’t, much. But you do need more iron in your diet.” Sherlock informed him over the rim of his water glass.
Sherlock just flashed him an infuriatingly knowing smile. As if he’d just told a joke and didn't even know it yet. The brilliant green of his eyes seemed to whisper ‘slap me, you know want to’.”You’re a soldier recently discharged due to an injury. You’re living in a bedsit which you can barely afford and as a consequence feel cornered enough to sell your life’s blood to keep it, even though you hate it so much you often consider just sleeping on the street. You have nothing to live for, no one to miss you but no reason to die. As far as I'm concerned, we've been talking about nothing but flatmates." Sherlock grinned viciously, his eyes gleaming green under the sterile hospital light. John sucked in a breath and held it. He was angry. Seething. Furious. He felt like putting a bullet through the man's laughing eyes or slitting his throat and letting him drown in his own arterial spray.
Google speech to text pinged. “Inform the criminals of London that I’m taking a sick day,” Sherlock told it before hitting the send button.
"I'll keep that in mind." John gave her the polite smile he reserved specifically for the elderly. "Well. This has been lovely. But I've got to go."
“Wow. That sounds almost like a compliment. I must be dreaming.” John yawned, pushing himself out of bed. He paused when he heard the crinkle of paper under his feet. “So I assume you went over the files last night?”
It was only the size of a small letter opener, but it was sharp as a razor and a work of art. It was engraved to the point where it was no longer a solid piece of metal, but a kind of swirling, silver lace with fat, blue bumblebees set in enamel scattered across the length. This was no brutish tool for hacking apart meat or cutting rope. This was a delicate instrument, made with care and respect and to be used as such.
“This way,” She commanded quietly without even glancing at John. She floated towards a door that was entirely identical to the others.
“You can’t seriously expect me to believe that you care, do you?” Sherlock spat angrily, his face contorting into a sarcastic grimace. He pivoted in John’s direction. John opened his mouth to speak, but his brain hadn't yet .
“Like this,” Sherlock announced before cradling John’s jaw and leaning in close. For a single terrifying moment, it seemed as if he might pull away. But the moment passed.
Sherlock made an attempt to snatch the paper out of his hand but John pulled away too quickly. “See, they must mean the wrong John Watson, there are so many of yo-.”
The golden man scoffed, the hard line of his mouth twisting into a cruel smirk. “Oh, don’t be ridiculous. Yes, I do own the flowers. I planted- ok, well I didn’t plant them. -but I’m the one who cares for them. I water them in the hot seasons, I shelter them in the cold, I do the weeding and the fertilizing and last spring the bees were particularly lazy so I had to pollinate them.” His emotions flashed across his face in rapid succession. Sherlock wished briefly that he could slow time to a crawl to give him the chance to study them more closely. Then they came to a halt at confused bafflement. “What do you even want deadly nightshade for, anyways?”
This chapter was pretty fun for me so I hope you get some giggles out of it too. There's a vague lesson in vampiric law in there that you will not be tested on, but would do well to keep in mind as it might come up later.
“Yes, well. I’ve got a sister who’d sell me for six pack and half a tuna sandwich.” John chuckled, only half joking. “Why’ve you been avoiding me lately? Is it just because I asked about the skull?”
“Nothing for your… uhm friend, then?” Her big brown eyes darted to the detective who could only be described as scrawny, her eyes tinged with worry.
"Of course," John rolled his eyes, almost amused by Sherlock's determination to be moody. "Isn't it a little warm for that?" John asked, gesturing to his flatmate's heavy coat.
And John felt more like family than any human he’d ever known. It had only known the strange fae boy for a few weeks, yet already he felt like a brother to him. Like a real brother who cared about him, not the overbearing, prying, yet woefully oblivious brother that Mycroft pretends to be.
Please note that if I’m found dead under mysterious circumstances, makeup and beauty challenges are to blame.
“Was that really necessary?” Sherlock asked over the hand clutching his nose. It wasn’t bleeding, but it surely didn’t feel great.
John nodded, standing from his armchair to make himself a proper cup of tea. “Well, now that we’ve established that I will continue babysitting for you, are we finished? I can practically feel Sherlock making faces at you through the wall.”
"Sherlock, calm down. I'm not angry with you." John tried diffusing the froth Sherlock was working himself into. Luckily, he deflated pretty quickly. "Actually, I'm glad you did... whatever you did. I'm just saying, next time try knocking."
John tried not to be too horrified. Mark told him these people had a few... cultural quirks.“...I think I’ll stick with the money, thank you very much.”
John laughed again. "I don't think so. Now, if you don't mind, I was in the middle of catching a murderer when you kidnapped me. And I’d very much like to get back to it.”
“Oh god.” Sherlock groaned upon entering the room, glaring at a bowl of potpourri. “Now three of my senses are offended.”
"Yes." John mumbled something that sound almost like 'do what you like'. Sherlock hummed, deep and low. It filled the room like a finger circling a wineglass. John winced as something wet swiped across his wound. He felt himself begin to drift off when the vampire began to speak again in between licks. "It's not exactly good manners, this. Taking your blood from the flesh so soon after we've met." The stinging pain of the wound faded quickly until it felt as fuzzy as his head did. It occurred to him that he should be remembering something important. Something about danger. But it drifted away as he fell further asleep. "But your flesh is already broken. And it's less polite to let it fester."
“No. No, it’s much more literal than that. It’s basically the late stages of starvation. When a vampire goes without blood for too long, the body starts cannibalizing itself by digesting it’s own blood supply.”
I didn't know how to end this, but I needed to get something posted tonight. So... I'm letting the title be the punchline.
It was a good minute before Sherlock regained consciousness. This time, though, he seemed more lucid. “John. Please tell me you didn’t throw out all the morphine.”
At first, John wasn't terribly worried as it fell within the parameters of caseless moodiness. Even when hours stretched into days, he considered it better than him going on a boredom-fueled destructive rampage. Besides, he was out of the apartment for a significant amount of time. So it was likely that Sherlock could have been up and about while John was out. Or in his room. Or sleeping. There was really no way to know for certain that he hadn't.
“That is your name, isn't it?” He smiled condescendingly, looking down his finely sculpted nose at the doctor. Most people would’ve said that to make sure they’ve remembered correctly or pronounced it right. The man said it as though he was afraid John had forgotten.
Then John came from work to the distinct, unmistakable smell of urine emanating from the sofa. Now Sherlock was quite blasé when it came to many aspects of cleanliness. It was in no way uncommon to find urine samples in the refrigerator, in his favorite mug or filling the bathtub with the help of an antique bear rug. But he was fairly meticulous when it came to his personal hygiene. There were only so many circumstances involving bodily fluids and his clothing that he tolerated for extended for significant amounts of time. And even then, not happily. So, when John found that his friend lying on the sofa had soiled himself and done nothing to remedy the matter, his first instinct was to call an ambulance. Then he got a grip and called Lestrade.
“Oh. It had to be that you should really pack your own bags instead of assuming I packed mine with you in mind.”
Lestrade pretended to consider that possibility before dismissing him. Sherlock made a show of biting his tongue and not saying anything.
“Why not? You’ve let literally everyone else come through. Honestly, I’m surprised you’re not serving cocktails. Then it’d be a real party.” Sherlock smirked mockingly, trying and failing to maneuver around the human barricade.
John enjoyed the Sherlock-free quiet in the time it took for the kettle to boil. Then he made the mistake of looking up as he poured the water into a fresh mug to find Sherlock lighting the fireplace. With his the contents of his letter crumpled in his hand.
Sherlock’s eyes gleamed, just like the edge of a knife before sliding with such ease through his shoulder. Just like the first spark of what could be a wildfire. “Prove it to me.”
He considered the strange man and his warnings/threats/accusations. His well-manicured words drifting through John’s mind as he glanced up at the skull grinning down at him from the mantelpiece. It suddenly occurred to him that the odd piece of decor was a bit… small. “Sherlock.”
“No, I didn’t.” John turned to face Sherlock, beaming. A fat bird fell from the tree. “Thank you Sherlock. It’s an excellent gift. I’ll never go hungry again.”
Sherlock scoffed, gesturing towards the kidnapper. “Look at the bastard. Shaking, hiding behind a toy gun. He only did all this because his girlfriend broke up with him. Ending his life would be a mercy he does not deserve.”
“One of the small animals killed was someone’s pet dog. Rabbits and sparrows are one thing, but it takes a special sort of sick to kill a dog. Humans have been genetically engineering dogs to be lovable and since before history itself. Anyone to knowingly brutalize one clearly has a serious empathy problem.” Sherlock grimaced at the mirror. He turned away from his reflection and pinned John with an intense, searching stare. The sort of stare that left the person on the wrong end of it feeling insignificant and trapped. It really didn’t help that Sherlock had yet to draw his eyebrows back in. “I’m missing something. Mascara?”
He ignored how the girl’s eyes did not lose their suspicion and, through perhaps one of his finest performances ever, managed to keep his elation undetectable for the next two hours. While they told him about their week and all the trouble they’d gotten into within various social circles, he regaled them with a thrilling tale of a missing naval document and how the shallow cut on his arm got there in his retrieval of it. They teased him for being too slow when the villain had pulled the knife, and he halfheartedly defended himself while the fire crackled and the tea got cold. When he sat down again after brewing a fresh pot, he looked first to see Jessie’s cup entirely empty where she was sitting on the carpet next to his chair.
Sherlock did gasp at that, because he could see that John was being completely honest possibly for the first time since they’d met, and he could hardly believe he deserved such a statement after some of the things he’d done.
Half-falling across the threshold of his front door, this time not from the aftereffects of alcohol or opium but because the eerie echoes of literal Purgatory were still bouncing around in his head, Sherlock Holmes was startled to find the place empty of more than just life (namely, John, who had almost always been there when he’d returned before). Eerily, the house was empty of his doctor’s belongings as well. Craving sleep after his three-year foray into a nightmare world, but craving answers about the doctor’s absence more, he dizzily made it across the street and subsequently frightened all four of their young friends with a dramatic return from the dead and dead-faint tumble down their cellar stairs. He only just barely heard Bea shouting, her unmistakably feminine but powerful voice echoing distantly in his ears over the lingering washes of Purgatory; she was shouting at the others to fetch the doctor, and he only barely remembered hoping they meant John before darkness claimed him.
The rest of John’s words were lost on Sherlock, with only that one statement repeating in his mind, and his instincts were screaming at him that there was a deeper meaning behind it—
John looked up with a start again, but there was more startlement than offense in his expression this time.
“Come in,” he called, pausing his aimless plucking at his violin strings but not bothering to set the instrument aside.
He’d thought his sincerity was convincing enough, but doubt still waged against the hope in John’s gaze, and the man only looked all the wearier when he replied impatiently,
John’s little huff of a laugh and the gleam in his eyes and the flush of his cheeks were all only partly due to Sherlock’s good humor, and more to do with the last hour as a whole. He nodded and took in a deep breath to steady himself before finally letting go of Sherlock. (The detective tried, and failed, to ignore how he missed being cradled by that muscled, trustworthy arm almost immediately.)
Sherlock considered the question as he brushed just a hint of blue eyeshadow in the places where his veins would normally peek through in the corner of his eyes. “Mostly red and itchy. But after a while, the flaking skin does sort of look like ash.”
Sherlock looked over his shoulder to make certain, sighing with relief when he saw John was speaking the truth. He shrugged off his cloak and drew the crossbow from its sling, presenting it to John.
“I felt heat. The soft ash at the bottom of the pit. The charred wood.” John answered, giggling as Sherlock pulled at a bit of loose skin. He pulled the strange boy’s hand closer to his face, squinting as he contorted the fingers in different ways.
“You'll be ok, someone's on their way right now.” John, deciding to play along with Sherlock's delusion, put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “You’ll make it through this.”
John snickered as Mrs. Hudson quietly materialized into the room with breakfast. "Finished another case so soon, Sherlock? I was sure you'd be taking it easy." She chattered pleasantly as she laid out a plate of bacon and eggs.
“Wait wait wait. No. Stop.” John interjected, interrupting the bout of childish squabbling. “He kidnapped me. Threatened me. Threatened you. And now he’s having tea on our sofa…. Excuse me if I feel like I’m missing something.”
"I was kidnapped." He explained simply, as if there was anything simple about it. "... Why are you on top of me?"
“Yeah… yeah sure.” John answered, swinging his legs over the edge of the bed where he was reading the book he brought with him. He pulled his jacket off the hook, quickly making sure his key card was in the pocket before heading out after Sherlock who always seemed to be three steps ahead of him.
John rolled his eyes audibly as he ducked back into the ground. “Just, give me a second. I’ll build one.”
“Four, five days? He's… entirely unresponsive. Eyes open, but glazed over.” John listed as he examined Sherlock. “He’s barely reacting to physical stimuli. Occasional muscle twitches. What is this, an overdose?”
“So, I guess what I’ve learned from this letter is that you have a family who love you and not just in the creepy Mycroft way. None of them have even the vaguest idea of who you are. And your mother thinks we’re in a relationship and should… mate.”
John followed Sherlock without a word, just a ravenous curiosity, into his bedroom. He’d never seen the inside of Sherlock’s bedroom before, as the vampire had made it very clear that even the space in front of his door was Off Limits. John liked to speculate, to himself and his blog readers, exactly what Sherlock was hiding in there. The most popular possibilities were 1) His secret massive stuffed animal collection, 2) Mirrors. Just so many mirrors, or (the inevitable) 3) A personal porn collection that you could make a museum out of.
The third was that his vampire flatmate spent a suspicious amount of time with the police detective named Lestrade. Every few weeks or so, he'd come by and visit. Sometimes he'd have a file for Sherlock to puzzle over, but usually he didn't. Every time, they'd both disappear into Sherlock's bedroom for hours. After which Lestrade would stumble out with rumpled clothing and strangely bright eyes and Sherlock would spend the rest of the day in a hazy cloud of self-satisfaction.
Pain vibrated through his very bones. Old pain. The kind of pain that would sell for thousands these days, if only he’d had the foresight to keep a journal on the nightstand by his death bed. It traveled in waves, like the unassuming start of a tsunami. The symptoms of a shift in very structure of the earth.
John took up his place a few inches behind Sherlock's left shoulder to peek at the sheets of canvas and paper Sherlock was arranging on the wood surface.
John wondered drowsily how Sherlock could see anything in the utter darkness of the room. But the matter immediately resolved itself as a weird vampire thing. "If I do, will you let me sleep?"
“Sherlock.” John stepped in his path, forcing him to stop and look up. “If he didn’t know they were vampires, then why would he steal them?”
As the day stretched on, Sherlock found about fifteen new reasons to outlaw the police force and let anarchy rule the streets. In seven briefings with overly-friendly officers, six instances of ‘It’s a small town, things like that just don’t happen here’, five of ‘well, I didn’t think anything of it at the time’ and a whopping thirteen adorable small town anecdotes and not a single sentence of useful information.
John gave a bittersweet sigh at the mention of his (former) lover; even though it had been Michael’s insightful suggestion in the first place, and he’d been nothing but understanding about it all, they really had been happy together while it had lasted. Admitting to Michael that he had been right, that John unfortunately could not stay anymore, would not be easy to do without hurting him in a way he wouldn’t deserve.
Sherlock squinted a bit as her shadow moved down the staircase wall before the front door shut with a slam, but John offered no explanation for the bizarre exchange and so he asked for none. Let it be their little secret, he supposed.
The mantle clock had just struck six, an hour before the children were due to bring fish and chips for their customary Friday dinner, when the doctor’s unmistakable heavy footstep creaked on the main staircase.
But he knew how. It was the same reason he’d never seen any of the other, lesser men who might’ve shown him attention if he’d demonstrated any interest. He had never been attracted to any of them, never to a man, had never even considered it. Could he be? He didn’t even know. He wasn’t sure now, of anything.
John’s mouth twitched in amusement, for when they’d moved in together all those years ago it had been because both men were abjectly poor; now, Sherlock Holmes had been paid more money by grateful monarchs and politicians and celebrities than he could ever spend on himself in a lifetime, and yet the only time any of his fortune had been spent was when he’d been thought dead and John (being the beneficiary) had offered large portions of it to the girls for their wellbeing. John himself had spent not a penny, despite that he’d owned everything of Sherlock’s, and so when the detective had returned from the grave most of his wealth had still been waiting for him.
, perhaps more than the average British gentleman; he still tended to be a little too abrupt at times and needlessly authoritative, but not as much as he used to be, before. He smiled more easily now, and laughed rather often even if it was just a small chuckle, and ate regularly, and even stroked Bea’s and Jessie’s hair sometimes with carefully affectionate fingers. Once or twice Sherlock saw him place quick kisses to their foreheads, hug them tightly (if still the smallest bit stiffly), and pat Billy’s or Spike’s shoulders with uncharacteristic warmth. Equally as surprising was that none of the four seemed to find his wary, mindful closeness uncomfortable or unwanted. With Sherlock absent for three years, John had evidently had the time and energy to take responsibility for other things; the doctor had always been a caregiver, despite his sometimes-ominous and often-harsh aura, but in the last few years this aspect of his nature had flourished on behalf of the daughters they’d both cruelly neglected, as well as their two friends who were equally in need of a parental figure.
Then they both found themselves smiling softly at one another, for no reason that either of them could really explain.
John’s breath was increasingly unsteady, his heartbeat faster where Sherlock still hadn’t moved his hand from his chest, and he was still waging that internal war he’d been fighting for over a decade now; he shook his head, but even as he did he bent forward just slightly, just enough so that Sherlock could lean up and press their foreheads together, and then hope won at last, it seemed. John tilted his head and, with his eyes squeezed shut still, he pressed his mouth to Sherlock’s fiercely, like he was trying to get his fill before he would be shoved away.
“I suppose,” he said, pushing himself up just slightly, “this is our home, yours and mine. Even in the worst times it’s where we belonged. I never even thought about leaving you after the First Rip, John. And I wouldn’t have left you in the second one either if I’d had the choice. You must always remember that.”
He’d almost forgotten what their relationship had been before the First Rip and Alice and everything else. But now it was nearly the same as those first five years, as if the rest had been wiped away. Sherlock and John bickered and laughed and shared jokes and pots of tea and drinks at the pub without any of the awful tension that had characterized all those years. In response to Sherlock’s subtle efforts to include and uplift him, John had seemed to shed that layer of caution and distance that had cloaked him for ten of those years and which Sherlock was only just now recognizing as his own fault. They were what they’d been before, what they always should have been—partners in both profession and personal life, coparents to two daughters and their two friends, inseparable.
Sherlock realized abruptly that the edges of his vision were getting a little unclear, and forced himself to take in a breath where he’d been taking none for several moments.
“Behold, John,” he declared, “the most beautiful woman in existence, according to stage critics the world over.”
Sherlock shook himself from his unusual reverie, wondering where in the hell any of that had come from, and clapped his friend on the shoulder.
“He wanted me to tell you you’re free to stop by his house any time you like,” John told her, refusing to take the bait. “He said you’re always welcome.”
“No,” Sherlock assured him, putting some seriousness back into his tone for John’s sake. “That’s not what I’m offering. I’m sorry for what I’ve done to you. I’m sorry I didn’t start to fix it until now. But I’m telling you that you don’t need to fear me, John Watson. I’m going to do my very best to be good to you and good
“I'm glad he made it easier on you,” he said honestly, and after another moment of comfortable quiet, he glanced to the mess that had been made of the coffee table. “I should clean up.”
“I’m not the man I was,” he said, as if John didn’t know that, as if he hadn’t been the only one there to watch Sherlock Holmes’s tumultuous downfall and help him keep his head above water.
…or how horrified he’d been, how helpless, when John had been screaming his name, clawing at his arm, trying so desperately to pull him back from the Second Rip while Sherlock’s very mind had been hijacked by Alice’s desires and he had no freedom to stay.
He also realized abruptly that he’d been staring dumbly into John’s eyes for rather longer than was necessary, and that John’s smile had faded to a look much like the one he’d worn constantly before—emotionless, guarded, as though if he showed anything it would be used against him somehow. But his eyes were softer and wider than usual too, as though he were also asking a question of Sherlock that he couldn’t decipher, and Sherlock Holmes could decipher anything.
While John fetched his hat and coat from off the sofa, Sherlock turned away as well to start cleaning up the mess of papers before they’d be inevitably trampled by four pairs of careless, grimy street boots.
“Is part of the house okay?” Spike piped up from the sitting area. “Like, just the kitchen maybe? Or the bath?”
Upon first hearing this, Sherlock felt a thrill of celebration he could not control, which he quickly stifled as he recognized such a reaction was unfair to John, who looked positively miserable in the soft sunlight that was just starting to fade into night.
“He’ll be back soon,” Sherlock replied neutrally. “I told him I’d save him some, and make some tea. Would you like any?”
The others might not have cared enough to notice, but Sherlock knew their short-kept secret was out when Bea’s eyes went straight to the old suitcase carried in one of John’s hands. While Jessie, Spike, and Billy argued over the last chip on the coffee table, Bea turned back around on the settee to look at Sherlock, who blinked dumbly at the calculated look on her face, and then she looked back at John.
Though they both tended to be rather capable speakers, by the time the moment settled and they knew someone should say something, neither seemed to be able to find the vocabulary. As it happened there was no need, because the silence was shattered by the mantle clock’s brief seven-o’clock chime. Sherlock stepped back only slightly to look at the time, and found the room to be much darker than when he’d noticed last.
“He said that you’re a great man, Sherlock, and that he felt like he was there just in time to…to look after things for you, in your absence. He said he was proud to have done it, and that he didn’t regret our time together, but now that you’re back he knows this is the right thing.”
“You’re working so very hard,” John said quietly, “to do good to everyone around you. You’ve become a father to the girls, and a hero to so many people in need. You’re kind, Sherlock; you always have been, but once it was shrouded in your quest for fame and glory. Now it’s all that motivates you, and it’s made you so much better than you ever were before. You’ve come out of all that pain and suffering and only let it make you wiser and gentler here on the other side. I have never once stopped being proud of you—”
“Cock!” Jessie shouted from nearby, inducing a chorus of uncivilized chortling from the four friends.
The ire was darkening those intense brown eyes, and John replied in a low, but still rough, voice, as his hand came down to smack onto the sofa in vexation.
John had left the room nearly seven minutes ago now, and Sherlock had been staring after him all the while, dumb and wide-eyed like the fool he was.
“Besides,” he added, because his mission wasn’t just to be more thankful these days, but to uplift those around him too, “your eyes are positively sparkling. They’re always captivating, really, but when you get good rest they’re even more so than normal. And that cravat brings them out. You should wear that dark bronze color more often. It really suits you.”
He raised questioning brows, but John seemed to be looking at something worthwhile, despite the scars and ugliness in him now.
After John had gone to have his final talk with Michael, Sherlock spent the next twenty minutes straightening the sitting room in something of a daze, because for the very first time in his life he felt that absolutely everything in his little world was perfect. He had a warm and welcoming home, the resources to keep it running for as long as he lived there, his work which was only getting more enjoyable by the day, and most importantly of all he had a family. He had never even dreamed of having one in his younger, more foolish days; then he'd thought it would be him, Alice, and the girls and even that unexpected dream had slipped through his fingers so that he never dreamed of a family again. But now he couldn't imagine having a more worthwhile little family than the one he possessed. Sherlock Holmes, John Watson, Bea, Jessie, Billy, and Spike—an odd little bunch to be sure, but together they somehow made a perfectly matched set, he thought.
Where he’d spent the first six months frustrated without knowing why, Sherlock spent the next few agonizingly aware of every new moment between John and Michael as he added to his count of kisses and compliments, and adding new categories as well—for instance, the number of times John waived spending time on a case to spend it with Michael instead (too many), and the number of times Sherlock walked into the sitting room late in the evenings and found himself wishing intently for John’s steady voice to fill the silence (
“She was wrong,” Sherlock said finally, meaning it with all his soul as he continued to stare at the perfectly pressed pinstripe shirt under his fingers, “that day, the day we closed the First Rip, Alice wanted us to leave, remember? She wanted me to take her and the girls to Suffolk. She said we didn’t belong anymore, that we needed to leave London.”
“Put your coat back on, John,” he instructed merrily, moving to the hatstand to do the same. “We must stop in Southwark and speak first to our client, then to Scotland Yard to pry some information out of the inspector on the case, and then who knows? Perhaps great adventure awaits us today, my friend.”
, so now every time I wake I look at him, but all I can think about is you, wondering what you’re doing in that moment, if you’ll need my help today, if you’ll
He readjusted so that the blankets were less tangled and emphasized with a gesture the empty left side of the bed.
and to no one else. You were wrong about another thing though; I did see you. I always did. Just not well enough, not the way I should have. But I want to change that now if you’ll let me try.”
John looked away once again, and Sherlock decided there was an entirely different part of this discussion he wished to explore.
As the voice drew closer, the man stepped through the doorway; his cheery brown eyes lit upon John and saw no one else, which was evidently quite normal for Michael Morstan. Not noticing that there was now an additional person besides the four usual in the background, Michael reached for John with both hands and looked as though he were going to kiss or at least embrace him with the upmost affection, and that was the first moment in which, like a lightening strike, Sherlock Holmes realized John Watson was homosexual.
he’d missed something now, because all the irritation left John’s demeanor in an instant as he, too, visibly tried not to grin while he rolled his eyes.
In the three years that Sherlock had been gone, John had moved out of Baker Street. He’d moved out of their home and into one that was only a couple of blocks away, yes, but despite how spoiled and selfish it sounded, Sherlock Holmes had come to realize that a couple of blocks away was a couple of blocks too far. This was particularly a problem because the house in which John now lived had another occupant who took up much of his time these days—a primly handsome, well-tailored, well-educated barrister with smooth olive skin and round brown eyes that gleamed at John whenever he was in view like John Watson was the only man he could see at all. And though he did not understand why, these days when John's gaze left Sherlock to shine right back at Michael, Sherlock was
“Surely you didn’t think I would disapprove of you for it,” he said, insistently. “We had male friends who felt the same. You could have chosen any one of them and they probably would have fallen all over themselves trying to win your hand.”
This last he said with a softly teasing smile, which John returned along with a deep sigh and a forced release of tension from his shoulders. Sherlock could surely never know how difficult it was going to be for him, summoning up the courage to be vulnerable and ask for the things he wanted at last. All the daydreams and ideas and wants were flooding to the front of his mind where he’d never allowed them before, forming a thousand requests on the tip of his tongue. He had never expected to be given the chance to ask for any of them, but Sherlock had surprised him completely today by granting him that permission. As thrilling as it was, the unexpectedness of it meant he now had no idea how the man was going to react to
. I always have. And you were wrong when you said you don’t belong anywhere, because you belong here too. Don’t you see that, John?”
Next chapter will be posted next Sunday night. In the meantime I hope you all have a great first week of May. :)
She nodded and he poured, and he would probably never get used to seeing her smile at him so freely because he knew he didn’t deserve it, not at all. But he was lucky. He was the world’s most fortunate man, in fact—not Michael, nor even John—because he’d gotten a second chance at life, quite literally, and the people he’d hurt the most the first time around saw fit to forgive him for it and let him build them a little home despite his faults and follies.
“They’re immaculate,” Sherlock explained, then continued at the inevitable rise of a questioning brow. “I know you’ve been taking on patients again here and there during the week, and you told me yourself you make house calls on Wednesdays. Those boots are your most comfortable pair that are still nice enough to be professional, so you always wear them when you think you’re going to be doing a lot of walking but are still going to be seen in a professional light, like yesterday, Wednesday, when you were making house calls. You’re wearing them today because you aren’t sure what to expect during the investigation, but they’re perfectly clean even though it rained nearly all of yesterday. You wouldn’t have cleaned them last night because it’s
Sherlock’s eyes widened, but John did not give him any time to form a response before he went on, looking away again to the floor and turning so he was almost faced completely away from Sherlock, uselessly smoothing the sleeve of the coat he’d just tossed over the sofa back.
“Incredible,” he said simply, but Sherlock knew they were both proud that the detective was in his right enough mind these days to accomplish even so easy a deduction.
“Because I wanted you there.” He leaned low over John’s head. Rationally, he knew he could get out of this easier than he could get out of bed in the morning. Sherlock wasn’t physically holding him down with anything but the long, thin legs wrapped around his waist. But despite that, he didn’t dare move.
“Oh, you’ll find it is very much my business.” His smile dropped. John found himself actually missing it. “All creatures such as him are my business. In fact, the reason I brought you here today was to make a sort of… proposal. I’m not asking for anything too strenuous, nothing you’d be uncomfortable with. Just some information. His habits, hobbies, routines. And of course a little discretion.”
“Oh Sherlock. For God’s sake.” Lestrade groaned as entered, wrinkling his nose at the sudden smell of urine. He seemed much less haggard than he usually did when he visited Baker street, seeking assistance on a case. It seemed as if some of the load was taken out of the bags under his eyes and his hair was combed by something other than fingers.
“Are you ok?” John asked as they walked up to the quaint town inn. Sherlock had been pulling faces and making small noises of distress since the moment they left the crime scene.
From the second he walked into the flat, he could feel the tension. It was like the air was stretched tight like a thousand bowstrings. John opened the door slowly, gently. As if doing otherwise would end with an arrow through his eye socket.
“It’s alright. I’m right here, I’m not going anywhere.” John reassured the delirious vampire, placing his free hand against his back to calm him. “Can you tell me where it hurts?”
"Her mother's boyfriend 'who seems a bit off' no less. Teenage girls have a sort of sixth sense about these things. If sweet old ladies are the security cameras of the world, teenage girls are it's sniffer dogs." Sherlock said proudly as he flagged down a cab.
Sherlock hadn't meant to actually kiss him. The preliminary transfer of saliva to facilitate feeding may be mechanically similar to a kiss, but could never really be mistaken for one. But John started it. And once he initiated the kissing it was impossible not to reciprocate. God, he kissed like he meant it. He kissed thoroughly, with determination. As though he had every intention of twisting Sherlock in a knot like a cherry stem. And it was working. Holy hell, was it working.
A flood of thoughts wrote themselves into Michael’s unassumingly handsome features, but his eyes were clear and intelligent, his step easy and self-confident, and so he ended up doing the wisest thing possible in the moment. He introduced himself and offered Sherlock his hand.
Michael, who had only heard secondhand about all the shit Sherlock and John had endured together for fifteen years, who knew nothing about the tentative and endearing weeks in the beginning when they’d first become housemates and started to understand and connect with one another, or all the hours the two had spent in these very rooms discussing cases and books and history and science and life and death, or how many fights between them during that decade after the First Rip had resulted in bruises not just from one another’s hands but from the hurtful words as well, or how many times Sherlock might have faded away in a drug den if John hadn’t found him in time and brought him home, or how Sherlock had made John endless cups of his favorite tea those following days as apologies…
John processed the flow of logic for a short moment, and then the corner of his mouth twitched into a smile and he looked down at his boots again.
Sherlock was at a bit of a loss as to where to go from there. Before the First Rip, on the rare occasions when a woman attracted his attention and he knew she was interested too, he would have made a show of asking her over to his house with flirtatious jokes and the showing off of his conversational skills and some of his infamous charisma. With Alice, she more often than not invited herself into his space, prompting little to no need for initiation on his part. But all that had been before, when he was something of a different man, and certainly never
see me. And so if I move back here, if I go back to those days, I’ll have to watch it all happen again—you might meet some other woman, some day, and I’ll have to sit here in these rooms and try to survive that torment without it killing me, and I can’t, not again. I’m too old now for that; I’ll never live through it without going madder than I did the first time, and then I’ll just hurt us both, just like before. But I can’t stay with Michael now, either, can I? Because you’re alive. You’re fucking
“It might just be that Michael needs some time to resolve whatever it is in his own mind,” he suggested. “Rather than renting a whole other room, you could just move back into your old one here, until you resolve the problem between you. I won’t even ask you to pay half the rent this time.”
hating on Alice because she’s in the way of my ship—I also thought it would be an interesting layer to Season 1 to find out she was actually manipulating Sherlock with her powers, whether on purpose or not.
“Ever since then,” John was saying, “I’ve thought about those hours and just wanted to feel you, asleep against me like that again.”
“Not your pity,” John snapped, still not willing to trust his smile, trying to protect himself from further hurt.
The other man turned to face him fully again, an expression of almost-offense written plainly on his hardened demeanor, for despite the way they’d grown and healed in the past year, they both knew that John Watson was a liar. He had lied, over and over again, during those ten years after the First Rip, and Sherlock had always known it but was too afraid to find out why. Now he wouldn’t be pacified any longer. John would tell him the truth when he asked, or this conversation would stop here, for both their sakes.
For all his ability to keep count of everything, he had no clue how long it was before they broke apart; it could have been only a couple of minutes, or it could have been over a half-hour. All he knew was that when they did pull back, pressing their foreheads together again for a long moment while they caught their breaths, he was dazed at the reality of it. He had kissed John,
“Where’s John?” Billy asked as they set up the food in the usual spot on the coffee table before the fireplace.
“Yes, please!” called out Jessie (whose love for the stuff was just as immense as her father’s, evidently).
“John!” he hissed scandalously, snatching the photograph and adding it back to the pile. “Do be still; there are children present.”
“It’s just,” he explained hastily, “I’ve been thinking about it, for so long, you know. Do you remember just after the case of the crooked church steeple, when you’d been using those damned drugs to keep yourself awake for so long they gave you nightmares when you’d finally solved the thing and allowed yourself to sleep? It was the middle of the night when you came crawling into my bed, half-out of your mind from the cocaine, and you just mumbled something about a nightmare before you went straight back to sleep.”
He would have liked to say he knew exactly what John’s answer would be, but he’d been so intent on ignoring it in case he was wrong, and so distracted with the idea John could possibly be coming home, he didn’t understand the context until John actually said the words aloud, turning his head to look directly into Sherlock’s eyes for the first time.
“I know,” he said softly, holding the other man’s gaze, “that I have not ever been the friend you deserve, but I want nothing more than to spend the rest of my life righting all my wrongs, and that includes towards you, if you’ll give me the opportunity. Tell me what’s wrong, John. I don’t like seeing you troubled.”
Sherlock watched the man’s face, simply committing it to memory in this new light, as the last flickers of pent-up emotion passed over the solemn features. He decided that, in a strange swapping of roles, he would have to be the sensible one returning them to normalcy, even if it was a different normalcy than an hour ago.
John started to shake his head, but seemingly to himself rather than to Sherlock, as though he were refusing to let his own mouth answer. That frustrated Sherlock more than he would have anticipated, but he supposed it was because John had apparently been telling nothing but the truth to dear precious Michael since they’d met, while to Sherlock he still withheld and told lies, as if Sherlock wasn’t important enough to receive the same truth.
thought either,” came the low, unhappy reply. “According to him, he still cares about me and wants to be friends, and yet he wishes me to move out within the next week.”
“D’you know what I think?” Bea’s voice, always with a peculiar musical quality despite the darkness she’d endured in her life, broke his long silence.
from you and I’m at your side again without question, and of course Michael knows. He knew from that first time he saw us together that no matter how hard I try to love him more, he will always be the second man in my life.”
“I hadn’t noticed,” he said, and then immediately recognized how foolish he sounded, as he fumbled with the jacket trying to get his arm in.
In answer, John’s left hand moved to cup his jaw, tilting Sherlock’s head so that he could deepen the kiss, while his other arm encircled Sherlock’s back and yanked him close, and Sherlock found he didn’t mind being manhandled, not in the slightest, because he could trust these hands, he knew. These hands were safe.
Sherlock was certain in the next instant that, despite his confessions and implications, John had never expected such forwardness so soon. The clear jolt of shock stiffened his back and made his mouth fall slightly open just before the pretty and unfamiliar blush got deeper across his sculpted cheekbones. This was all such a new experience for them both, and so he shouldn’t be surprised at anything anymore, but Sherlock couldn’t help thinking that on his stoic and secretive friend this uncharacteristic shyness was one of the sweetest things he’d ever seen.
In the end, it was John himself who presented the solution to the issue, thereby creating the very lightning strike revelation Sherlock had been tiptoeing around for weeks.
bother him. He knew it, and he pondered over it relentlessly, but each time he couldn’t find a reasonable excuse for his soul-deep frustration. It was the one and only real problem he had with life now.
“Will you tell me about it?” he asked anyway, taking another few steps closer until he was right next to John and could read his profile more accurately.
“Sherlock,” he called, annoyed by his own hesitancy but not wishing to alarm the other man by revealing too much of his pent-up passion too quickly.
The words were uttered in a desperate fury, as a mask of utter heartbroken defeat cut over his friend’s face so intensely it made Sherlock’s own heart clench for him. His knuckles grasped at the couch back behind him so tightly they paled to match the loss of color suddenly turning his perfect dark skin into a sickly shade.
“Why ever not?” Sherlock pressed, fueled by his suddenly overwhelming desire to see his friend in his old place again. “Your bed is still there, and your chair, and I believe you left a couple of your books on the side table in the hall,
“Well?” came John’s world-weary, immensely bitter voice from behind him. “Are you satisfied then, Sherlock? Do you have all the truth you want?”
“You see,” he said, feeling some of that old fire of adventure in his soul that he’d always felt around John, “I thought it might have been an invitation, of a sort.”
“You said it yourself,” he reminded him, “that day. Do you remember? You said she was changing me. I’m just not sure if how much of it was my choice and how much was possibly because she touched me and got into my head.”
Over the next several months, Sherlock had seen Michael Morstan twenty-nine times, had seen him touch John one hundred and twelve times, had seen him kiss him fifty-two times, and had listened to him compliment and glorify John's courage, his strength, and whatever else he could think to compliment and glorify eighty-four times. Part of having a mind as precise, and currently sober, as Sherlock Holmes’s was the curse of keeping count of everything.
He noticed after several ticks of the mantle clock that the room was oddly quiet, and he turned to find four pairs of eyes on him. Of them, Bea’s, who was standing next to him still, were the only pair not to look instantly away in false disinterest; instead hers danced with some unspoken private joke which she refused to share, as she turned away from him and back to her friends.
“So…” she trailed off and kept her entertained look fixed on John, “…you’re not living with Michael anymore, then.”
. It didn’t matter to him that John was a man, or that he was a liar, or a jealous fool, not even the slightest bit. Because he’d said
“Will you finally be getting a tattoo now, then? I mean, I think it’s only right since the rest of this family’s got one.”
for the past as well. As another little step in accomplishing this, he pulled the heavy blanket off the back of his own chair and tossed it over Bea’s shoulders, as she was the only one of the four wearing no jacket over her long sleeves and the room was growing chillier.
Sherlock wanted to set a good example, and really, they were all old enough now that they ought to be more grown up, but considering the state he’d been in when they’d met he supposed he didn’t have any right to scold her for anything. And in any case, after a bit of criticism clouded his face, John met her eyes and ended up laughing along with her, albeit more subdued, his own eyes glowing warmly. When his gaze slipped back to Sherlock’s, the detective realized very abruptly that this was the happiest he’d been not just in the last fifteen years, but in possibly his entire life. He’d once believed that he would never be happy again without Alice, but since Purgatory, since he’d broken free of it and had become something of a real father with his career and his closest friend intact, he’d found he’d been wrong about that too.
“What?” he asked, pushing away his dizzying thoughts to refocus on the photographs, gathering them up from the desk.
“I’m sorry,” John murmured, then, more insistently, “but it’s not something I can control, Sherlock. The way I feel—”
As much as Sherlock had loved Alice (or thought he had, or whatever), all at once her lithe, feminine form and pretty delicate features were gone from his mind once and for all. He’d been slowly releasing her, ever since that day of the Second Rip, when she’d abruptly seemed much different from the way he’d remembered her as she'd smiled beatifically about bringing literal purgatory into the living world. Perhaps she wasn’t the woman he’d thought she’d been, even before that. Perhaps he’d been holding onto some idealized memory after all, like a porcelain statue carved to smooth out the flaws of the real subject and easily shattered at a wrong touch. Perhaps his grief was never quite justified and he really had simply been mad for a decade.
“He had something to discuss with Michael,” he replied without turning around. “He’ll be here in a little while.”
But as he should have expected, his attempt to distract them from asking anything more was unsuccessful on Bea. Her eyes narrowed on Sherlock as she pulled out a serving of chips wrapped in brown parchment paper and she questioned,
John sighed again, this time one of relief, as if he were still expecting harmful repercussions at such a request. He crossed to the other side of the bed and climbed under the disorderly blankets, trembling just slightly from the cold in the room, while Sherlock stretched up to turn down the gaslight on the wall.
“No, it wasn’t like that,” he answered, his own voice now soft with sorrow and awe at how very tangled it all was. “I ran to her because…because she told me to. She forced me to.”
me—we belong to each other, yes? That’s it, isn’t it? That’s what I haven’t been able to see all these years, like the damned fool that I am. It turns out I’m not the brilliant one in this partnership at all, am I? It was you all along—you saw it when I couldn’t.
Sherlock watched as he made his way to the end of the dim hall and up the winding carpeted stairs to the third-story bedrooms. It was some thirty minutes afterward that he was finished straightening up the sitting room, and by then the house was silent; when he passed John’s room at the top of the stairs, the door was open (which was a change from his routine before) but no light or sound came from within. And so Sherlock simply went to his own room, comfortable and confident that the next day would be the start of the best part of his life, if he were clever and kind enough to make it so.
When he stepped back through the rift and it sealed itself up again behind him, leaving no sign that its eerie blue glow had ever existed there at all, Sherlock Holmes’ mind was so overwhelmed—swirling with so many vivid thoughts and feelings and voices, most of which he strongly suspected were not his own—he wasn’t even sure how long it was before he actually left the chamber. All he knew was that when his head was finally clear enough for him to walk, he was on his knees and the icy cavern floor had turned his legs numb. Barely able to recall what had happened, but knowing beyond all doubt that he was immeasurably, miraculously lucky to be on the ground of a living world again, he checked over his shoulder for only long enough to assure himself the rip was truly gone forever now, before finally stumbling from those filthy, eerie tunnels back into the topside light of his beloved London.
John made a show of studying the photograph for a long moment, just to entertain Sherlock, he knew, and then shrugged blandly with one shoulder and held it back to him dismissively.
“No,” John agreed, obviously also recalling that young, brash, self-important consulting detective that no longer lived in these rooms. “You’re better now.”
And there it was, the third or fourth lightening-strike realization in the past year. No one knew John Watson like he did,
“Yes?” the other man looked up and, seeing that John was lingering in the doorway looking contemplative again, set aside the crumpled newspaper in his hands. “What is it?”
“Taught myself, mostly.” Sherlock shrugged with false modesty, but John caught the slightest shift of Sherlock’s eye in his direction to gauge his reaction.
Deadly nightshade. A small garden’s worth, all nestled between the tangled roots of a half dead oak tree. Surely, this is what his brother meant to keep from him. Their pretty violet heads bowed at the end of their stems, as if bowing to him in greeting. For pure folly’s sake, he returned the gesture before kneeling to examine them more closely.
John nearly choked on a piece of overcooked chicken. "You're pulling my leg. I mean, hormonal disorders and alternative dietary preferences are one thing. But-"
The next few days passed by with ease. They announced to the police that there didn’t seem to be much point in investigating further, but no one was expecting them back in London for another week so they might as well stay and see the sights.
Sherlock erupted into thunderous laughter. The kind that made his ribcage heave and the air swirl around the room in whirlpools and waves and left them both breathless. “True. Maybe I should take it easy in these, my sunset years.”
He smiled. A grim thing with a little flash of teeth suggesting he definitely could, but probably won’t. Probably. “I feel like you’d make a better weasel than a rat anyways.”
John fell into his chair in relief, melting into the overstuffed piece of furniture as he toed off his shoes. “Is all your family like that?”
For now, this chapter comes with a lot of feels. Based vaguely off of the canon 'the dying detective' story. But, surprisingly, is not a case fic.
It was then that he realized exactly how early it was and John didn’t seem like much of a morning person. Sherlock doubted the fae boy would react well to being rudely awakened at sunrise.
Sherlock’s phone binged. Then a few minutes later it binged again. He checked it with all the urgency of a sedated sloth, reaching over to the coffee table and flicking the screen with his thumb in slow motion, one hand still combing through his slightly damp curls and one eye half closed. He huffed in acknowledgment after reading what was probably a text.
“I haven’t brought these out in years.” He muttered reverently as he hauled out a small trunk from the bottom of the impeccably organized closet. He eased the lid open slowly, carefully. “But if this arrangement is going to work, you need to understand.”
"Mmm. Tired now," Sherlock mumbled, his speech slightly slurred. The now empty blood bag fell from his mouth to the table. "Tell you in an hour or so..."He pulled himself to his feet with some effort and swayed like a drunk to the couch, where he collapsed into a blue satin heap.
“Not sure. Do humans consider 1:15 to be morning? I’ve always wondered.” Sherlock replied as he kept a careful eye on the eggs. “Also, do you like your eggs runny?”
John wondered briefly if Sherlock truly wasn’t making sense, or if it was his thoroughly addled mind that couldn’t make sense of what otherwise would be a perfectly logical sentence. “Sorry, what?”
The door opened and John stepped quietly inside. He was sweating. Nervous? What a strange thing for John to be.
“I prefer more natural scents. The forest after a rain. Fertile soil. A man after a run. Tobacco smoke. Not dead plants and man-made chemicals.” Sherlock grumbled, checking under the pillows and inside dresser drawers for other sachets and such to get rid of.
“No. I can’t ask that of you.” Sherlock replied in the tone of someone who would very much like to. “You’re too new. You don’t understand-.”
“Then maybe you should’ve tried more… traditional methods.” John suggested with a pointed smirk. Sherlock only rolled his eyes in response.
This was a day he wouldn’t share with anyone. Partly because there wasn’t anyone remotely tolerable in a hundred mile radius to share it with. But mostly because what he was doing was slightly unsavory, less than moral and probably at least a little life-threatening and if anyone knew, they’d prevent him from doing it.
Slowly, the tension in John’s form relaxed. His breathing evened out from strained huffs to long, deep gasps. The acrid stench of fear faded to something old and dusty and unimportant. Fear and confusion gave way to a deep sadness. But sadness was alright. Sadness was safe.
Sherlock glared. “She was just being nice, she didn’t actually mean you were free to break into her house while she’s away and harass me.”
Sherlock laughed euphorically as he passed over the river that marked the edge of their territory. Mycroft was probably discovering his absence at that very moment. Oh, he wished he could see his uptight brother’s face turn red when discovering he’d been fooled by some farmer’s son.
She looked… surprisingly normal. Considering she had just killed a girl a few hours ago. She wore a bulky, oversized navy blue sweater with the hood pulled low over her face. From here, you could almost mistake the crusty, rust colored stains on her battered old jeans for paint.
“I’m sorry. Old habits. I… ” Sherlock turned a rather flattering shade of pink and looked down at his hands. “No one stays this long.”
"You can't be serious." Sherlock groaned, turning back with all the insolence of a teenager. "look at the amount of detail. The precision. Do you think she was just born with that kind of talent? This killer's had practice. A lot of it." He pivoted away again, flipping his collar up as he began the trip down the stairs.
She tried to charge past John. He caught her around the neck at the last moment. She squirmed like an eel, but he wouldn’t relent. For awhile, it almost seemed that he’d caught her. Then she pulled out a knife as sharp as a scalpel with a handle crusted with old blood. John didn’t notice it until it sliced through his jumper. He drew back in shock and she was off like an arrow.
Lestrade sighed, the way people do when they've answered a question too many times and still don’t know the correct answer. “Different people have different experiences. Some say it’s almost religious, others say it’s like drugs. There’s a whole cult of freaks who see it as erotic. And of course, every vampire is different too. But mainly it’s like being drunk.”
John shut his eyes for a second and took a deep breath. He wondered if maybe he should just get his own room. “Then buy some.”
Realization spread across Sherlock’s face. “Oh. You’ve been reading those idiotic stories.” He smirked, lifting his glass. “Do yourself a favor and don’t assume to know anything about us. Vampirism isn’t a virus, so much as a subspecies. All of those stories are ju-” He froze mid-sentence
He landed, almost by sheer luck, back in his chair. The detective brandished one of their better forks, stabbing at a generous pile of eggs and holding it about mouth level in front of John’s face. His eyebrow twitched expectantly.
Sherlock hummed his approval. Then, after a half second's pause, tipped the vial back over his mouth to shake out the last few drops. When it was clear there was nothing left, he began licking the rim of the receptacle for whatever traces were left over. Even Molly seemed to be shocked.
“I’m going to my room!” Sherlock announced after shooting his flatmate an incredulous and scandalized glance. “And no one is welcome in!”
“You…” He began again, speaking quietly to his knees. “You’re a soldier. Accustomed to packing quickly. Take anything you need. My account’s fairly dry, but the chemistry equipment should sell well.”
He snickered. "Sherlock's a big boy. He can handle it." John didn't look entirely convinced. "Look, I've been around their kind for awhile. They consider it rude to go about killing randomly."
"Jesus, Sherlock." John slurred as his head lolled back. Thankfully, the vampire wasn't the only one affected. "Shit, did you drug me?"
"Very well. Woke up badly." He grunted as he sipped at his tea. A little cold, but still excellent. The taste of it sunk into his system like an internal massage. He took a seat at the kitchen table. "Are you one of those people who own fifteen of the same outfit? Because there's no way you slept in that."
When the clock chimed eleven and the conversation had dwindled into sleepy, contented yawns, the boys waved their goodnights, Jessie smiled at Sherlock and John with equal fondness, but it was Bea who waited for a moment while the others went downstairs.
Sherlock smiled, nodded indulgently, and let his eyes shine at him until the tall, broad-shouldered figure was out of sight down the staircase. And even when John's step had faded and the front door had closed audibly into silence, Sherlock kept smiling at nothing and everything as he bent down to start cleaning up the floor again.
? he wondered in a flash, before he was distracted by the continued outpouring of his friend’s trembling baritone.
“I-I left it open,” he rasped when he awoke the next afternoon in 221B’s dust-covered sitting room to find Bea, Billy, Jessie, Spike, and John all five looking at him as though he were impossible, which he supposed was fair. “It was like I had…access to-to parts of myself I can’t find while in this life, parts that gave me power over the world similar to an ipsissimus. I…I left it open so I could try to get back.”
John, who looked no less overcome, eyes wide and disbelieving as they searched Sherlock’s face for his reaction.
“Aren’t you meant to be…rather far from here?” he finished his introduction with a question that was both polite and direct, which was oddly reminiscent of Sherlock's own methods, and
“It’s just a small quarrel I’m having with Michael,” he confirmed. “I’m sure I can resolve it. It’s not important, Sherlock.”
. Because in the same way that 221B had become a meeting point for the children, it had become that for John as well—just a meeting point.
A slice of his own guilty pain cut through him when he tried to brush the fingertips of the other hand along John’s jaw, and the man shut his eyes again as though it burned and leaned slightly away.
He also knew how many times John had done the same in return, how many times he’d flushed at the candid praises despite his somber demeanor, how often his back had straightened and his eyes brightened because Michael had said something to him, or touched him, or kissed him.
He turned on his heel and offered her a disgruntled look as reward for her attempt to be annoying, then he recalled that he’d lived with John for fifteen years but it had taken a trip to Purgatory and a handsome new suitor for him to realize his best friend was interested in men, and even longer to realize why this particular man had him so enraptured.
Sherlock gave a visible start, for no matter what he might’ve been when he was young, age and addiction had surely taken away anything beautiful about him, hadn’t they? What could John possibly be seeing
As he’d worked to improve his character, to be a better man for his children and his clients and his friends (well, just the one friend he had, anyway), Sherlock’s world had become better than he could’ve imagined. After nearly a year since his miraculous return from the grave, his fame had soared to fantastic heights so that kings and commoners alike sailed the oceans to consult him; his daughters had lost most of their hesitancy regarding him and were entirely relaxed in his home, even opening their arms for his embrace when he reached for them these days (although he would be the first to admit he had a long way to go still in proving himself to them); and John? Equal with his newfound fatherhood, John was perhaps Sherlock’s most dramatic success.
He was half-grinning—he couldn’t help it—almost playful despite the gravity of it, because at that question, John’s gaze fell automatically to his lips, then to the low cut of his old undershirt, then forcibly back up again. And Sherlock knew in that moment that this, their relationship, the rest of their lives, flirting with John and getting him riled up like this…it was going to be
Not once in all the years they’d lived together before had he heard his friend mention children or fatherhood in any personal context (apart from when he’d gotten uncharacteristically drunk once in their younger days and had let it slip that his own widower father had beaten him frequently until he’d left home to join the Army). But now, with no previous indication, John Watson had apparently proffered himself for single parenthood. The children—Bea, Jessie, Billy, and Spike—might have lived officially still in their cozy cellar, but apparently John's own place had become an unlikely second home for them all after everything. Before Sherlock’s unprecedented return from the dead, most every weekend the four of them had apparently been piling into the doctor's sitting room and had drunk tea and eaten candies and more often that not fallen asleep where they’d been on the settee or sprawled across the carpet. And apparently there had been John Watson, Sherlock’s distant, solemn, stone-faced John, right in the middle of them, or sitting somewhere nearby doing work (and yes, he still consulted for the police, and didn’t do too poorly for himself as a lone detective, either).
John said nothing, just continued to stare at him with baleful eyes, heart thundering under Sherlock’s palm.
But before he moved to put his things back in his old room, John met Bea’s eyes deliberately. She must have been pleased with whatever she saw there, because when he was gone from the doorway, she looked back at Sherlock once again and hid a grin in the teacup she held with both hands. Her eyes fluttered from the fire to him and back to the fire again, dancing with delight which she finally focused on Sherlock’s face knowingly.
John’s breath seemed to stop for a fraction of a second, but when his eyes met Sherlock’s again a great part of that infamous stone wall had crumbled. Sherlock counted this as his sign of victory for the last few months’ effort.
John looked sidelong at him and he could understand why; they had never actually discussed those dark days their friendship had endured, and so he supposed this was as good a time as any to broach the subject.
“Look at you,” John told him, seeing his doubt and uncertainty, as always, raising a hand to gesture at what Sherlock could only imagine was the pitiful sight of his gaunt, worn-out body in his frayed undershirt and ill-fitting trousers and bare feet.
He turned on his heel just in time to watch the flicker of emotions chase each other in John’s eyes—the grief chased away by confusion and then the confusion by disbelieving annoyance at the lack of decent reaction to his torturous confession.
“There is nothing else special about Michael Morstan than that,” the doctor went on, his voice trembling like Sherlock had never known, his brows clenched as though he were in some great agony. “I was never interested in those other men because how could I be? While you were alive, how could I look at anyone else? How could I even see any other man while you were in the same room?”
Now that he’d returned and inserted himself into their little dynamic, Sherlock tried very hard not to feel overwhelmingly guilty about his neglect, which was surprisingly easy to accomplish, because in the last few years the five of them had all agreed on something else too: forgiveness. They’d said so, back at this start of this odd new life, when he’d first returned….
They were at Baker Street again, working on an case Gregson had handed over to them—something to do with a stolen necklace and the whiny-voiced prima donna it had been stolen from—with the children hovering at their elbows and offering advice that more often than not was shrouded in jokes. The case was going to be an easy one; that much had been clear to all of them since they’d gotten it that morning.
“It wasn’t so much a choice,” came the predictably matter-of-fact response. “I told you—you had me within the first week.”
Bea whispered with covert urgency the first time he met the new housemate, one Michael Morstan, a week and a half after his return.
“I could’ve pointed them your way easily,” Sherlock told him. “So why? Why didn’t you give any of them a chance?”
He looked back to John, who nodded with his own eyes on the clock; even so, however, the doctor’s strong arm did not unwind from around Sherlock’s slender back, keeping him so close their bodies nearly touched.
“Apparently not,” he muttered, then shook himself a bit and shoved the photographs into his jacket pocket. “I’m going to the Yard to give this evidence to Gregson. Please don’t burn down the whole house while I’m away.”
“John, why did you ask me to pick you up here?” a bright, articulate voice echoed up the staircase into the sitting room. “You could have asked me to come with you, you know. I know how hard it is for you to come back to this house when you need something. I really don’t mind tagging along for the support.”
such praise before, never been the recipient of anyone’s admiration and wonder. Everyone had always been too preoccupied with Sherlock, because John had arranged it that way; John had built him up, believed in his crime-solving abilities before anyone else would, let him stand in the light he helped create while John himself kept to the shadowed background despite his own greatness.
“Please don’t,” came the pleading whisper. “I can’t move back here, Sherlock, no matter how much either of us wishes it. You-you don’t know what it’s like, being here with you, but
was taking, so that was where he usually cut off his circling thoughts. And Sherlock stayed silent and ignored the way his stomach flipped when Michael kissed John and how his heart felt heavy with melancholy at the empty breakfast table.
I'm so sorry to anyone who might've been waiting for this chapter. I always try to post on time, but let's just say some shit happened yesterday and leave it at that. x) BUT this chapter is the longest and I THINK you'll like where it goes. :) So I hope that makes up for being a day late!
Sherlock hadn’t been famous then, but he’d certainly been confident in his own ability to build his reputation into something marvelous. He’d been quick, and cunning, and outgoing, and eloquent, and—he wasn’t too shy to say—somewhat attractive at least, with his careless smile and his long dark hair often tied up in a thoughtlessly windswept fashion and his well-fitting wardrobe in colors just bold enough to be eye-catching. One woman, he recalled, had once told him (rather flirtatiously) that he looked like the wild, debauched adventurer from a seafaring novel but with the poise and acuity of a prince. He’d laughed, and raised his glass of deep red wine, said that she would have to guess which he actually was, and everyone in the room had chuckled at his relaxed humor but had seemed to agree with her assessment nonetheless. Perhaps it might have been easy to love him then, when he was full of promise and youth and vivid genius.
Bea, along with the others, saw the exchange clearly but didn’t bother with a reaction, and so the other three followed her guidance and gave none themselves.
—like how when he fluttered out the door and down the stairs, Bea watched him go with a brightening smile of satisfaction, as though she had just seen something that she’d been hoping to see for a long time. The boys weren’t paying attention, of course, but she glanced to her sister, and sure enough Jessie was also looking toward where their father (slow-growing as their relationship was) had just departed looking so unnaturally agitated. The sisters raised their eyebrows at each other, a silent conversation passing between them, and then Jessie gave a little shrug that was more optimistic than uncertain.
He realized a second later why she’d sounded so urgent. Michael was evidently a common fixture in their lives now, a sort of kindly uncle figure to the unsure fatherly one John had donned. John had met him a year and a half ago, he’d learned later, when a case had led him to interview at the courthouse, and Michael had spent the entire interview struggling to stay on the proper topic whilst simultaneously praising Watson’s abilities as a writer, a detective, a gentleman, and an interviewer. And evidently he’d uttered all these praises with complete sincerity, because six months later John had packed up all his things and left 221B for the last time. Sherlock wasn’t sure precisely why that idea sent an uncomfortable jab into his chest.
Sherlock let her go, gave both girls the time and distance they needed to process it—that their mother had not only knowingly instigated the slaughter of hundreds by reopening the Rip from the other side, that she’d planned to turn the world into a never-ending purgatory for both the living and the dead, but that after all that, she’d ended it by stepping back through…but on her own condition that Sherlock Holmes go with her, even if it was against his will and through the force of her overwhelming mind powers. She had touched him, kissed him goodbye, and in the process had used his grief as a door to implant her own desire that he run to join her at the last second, when no one would expect it, when John Watson wouldn’t be prepared to grab him in time. Even the words he’d spoken to John in those last seconds had been prompted, motivated by her. And the only reason Sherlock hadn’t been lost forever was because his brain was thankfully not as slow as he’d feared it’d become, and had been just quick enough with its newfound connections to darkness to hold the Rip in place—open not wide enough to let anything out, but just enough so that he could have a chance to find a way back, like a sewn-up hole that could be pulled apart again with the right strain and then closed back.
So, if you had any particular part you liked, please feel more than free to tell me. If you're confused by something, go on and shout it out. If you want to know what's happening next, then please just ask! I won't give you an answer, but ask anyways. It's fun being a tease.
As much as the vampire loved to complain about everything from the bright sunshine to the rustic cobblestones, John could sense that the change in environment was doing him good as well. There was a color in his cheeks and a light in his eyes that the human hadn’t seen there since they met.
John grumbled, as grumpy as he had been since he got up. Although, the vampire couldn’t blame him. The dungeon was rather cold for a human’s delicate sensibilities, the silence was rather infuriating and the place smelled awfully moldy. There was quite a lot for him to be grumpy about. “Time we should be using to Get Out.”
“Sorry. You didn't need to hear that... -it's the vampire saliva. Effects everyone differently, but it makes me a soppy idiot."
I struggled a lot with this chapter. I re-wrote half of it like seven times. But I'm... sort of alright with the final product. Any feedback would be great.
Yes, this story takes place in some mythical universe where Sherlock actually talks about his feelings. It's probably the blood loss talking.
“Sherlock Holmes. From Holmes manor.” He replied with as much dignity as one could from the flat of one’s back. Which turned out to be quite a bit. “I wasn’t aware this land was inhabited.”
“Are you aware that you have the typing skills of a dyslexic pidgeon?” Sherlock groaned as he sprawled across the couch. Unfortunately, that particular mystery had turned out to be too boring to please Sherlock. John didn’t understand how a break-in followed by a missing person’s case which actually turned out to be a case of long-term burglary could be boring. But he didn’t understand many things these days.

Sherlock nearly fell flat on his face in his haste to get out of bed. After metaphorically stepping back and judging exactly how much strain his underused and undernourished body was willing to take, he shuffled to the closet, making a point of staying close to the wall.
“What’s it… like? I mean, if it’s not too much information. I assume it’s not quite like getting your blood drawn.”
John sighed his relief, leaned back in his chair and watched Sherlock’s fingers fly over the touchscreen of his phone. “So… How did I solve the case? I’m afraid it rather slipped by me.”
"Duty, of course. How could I have forgotten your unconditional devotion to saving your fat arse from mummy's wra-" Sherlock's jaw snapped shut and his dramatically sarcastic flourishes came to a sudden halt. It was then that he noticed John standing at the door.
John thought to himself, wondering exactly which shoe was to drop after the vampire’s rather unexpected declaration. John took another sip of what was possibly the worst tea he’d ever had, even though his cup and run dry about three sips earlier. “Frankly, I have no idea how you know that or how it’s any of your business.”
The trail ended in a stretch of forest that looked like all of the rest he’d passed through. Although he couldn’t help but note that, whether due to the setting of the sun or his own excitement of having found it, the place seemed to have a glow about it. He swung out of his saddle in one swift movement, noting how the thick grass seemed to welcome the presence of his boots. He grinned without really knowing why and reached into his saddlebag for an apple to feed his horse.
Slowly, John’s eyes adjusted to the dim light. He began to make out the shape of the man. Large and firmly built. Big boned. Like he had pillars and beams where his femurs and rib bones should be. His head stood on his shoulders like a strangely handsome gargoyle and his nose looked like it should’ve had a bird perched on it.
John glanced quickly behind them. There was a flash of navy blue behind a dumpster. “About… two yards.”
"A species of hyper intelligent insect, not entirely unlike bees. They all went extinct a century ago. But I saw a colony once, as a kid. From a distance they actually do look almost humanoid."
Sherlock sat, with half his coat still hanging off his shoulder. He stared intently, obviously fighting the urge to bite his lip and shrink away like a scolded child.
John waved him off, feeling a little better about the wank he would have to have in a bit. Can’t blame the man for having to eat after about a week of just tea and water. Just before Sherlock could disappear down the stairs, something nagged at his mind. John called out “That’s not seriously your idea of seduction, is it?”
Sherlock made a noise like he very much wanted to say ‘dear lord no’ but nodded. “I will be eventually. The taste of bad blood sticks to the tongue like tar.”
“You’re right. Wouldn’t want to end up with them. I sympathize with the professionals tasked with sorting out the mess in their heads.” The genuine vampire ran his fingers through his hair slowly, indulgently, and purred.
The Irene chapters do still exist and will be re-posted, I just realized they need to come later in the story.
“It isn’t, but I’m grateful all the same.” He admitted, laying his umbrella across his knees like a sword atop some great tomb monument. There was silence. The only sound John could hear was his own breathing. The only thing that moved was the dust that slowly settled over them.
"Fine." Lestrade conceded, stepping out of the way. "But if you're wrong and one of them dies I'll-... you'll never feel my warmth again."
Sherlock shook his head, stopping his mind from wandering too far. He had less time than he’d originally estimated. Better skip the pants.
He did. Just in time to see Sherlock, half slung over Lestrade’s shoulder, glare hard enough to give himself an aneurism.
"Perfect." Sherlock replayed the segment for the third time. The light of the screen cast a cold light across his face, shifting his eye color from pale to lifeless. John shivered as the gravelly artificial voice echoed through the hollow space as he knew it'd echo through his skull for months afterward. "Check the father's background. Try to track him down. It's not uncommon for the children of the wealthy to be left to the care of a nanny. But in cases such as these, inside jobs are always most likely. Investigate the staff too. Just tutors and nannies, the rest would be a waste of time."
Sherlock stopped under the shadow of a small grove of trees. He turned to John, his eyes shining like the edge of a razor in the moonlight. “This one is much more complex than it seems. Oh, I knew we were in for a treat when we came to this town.”
"This." He lifted the narrow wooden box to the light, allowing John to wonder about it for just a moment before lifting the lid. "Is a knife."
"Oh for god's sake!" Mycroft exclaimed in frustration. A pair of fangs, like twin cathedral spires, jutted out from his grimace. "I occupy a minor position in the british government. One of the many duties of which is to monitor the black market.”
Also, the knife mentioned in this story was based off the badass work of a dude named montejano. Specifically, the piece linked below. I would literally be 100000% ok with someone stabbing me with it. I love my life and everything, but I would honestly be perfectly happy dying by that knife. it's that pretty.
He could feel Sherlock’s cool breath against his face, like first gust of fall at the end of summer. It came stronger, closer. Sherlock’s eyes filled his vision turning the entire world misty green and grey. Fingers drifted over his shirt and hands clutched at Sherlock’s bare shoulder blades. Their mouths met.
“So be it. Anthea.” A woman slipped silently out of the door nearest to him. She moved with a quiet grace. Like a shark, drifting silently through the depths of the ocean.
“That good, is it?” John smirks, ready to grab a stray scalpel should the vampire forget the formalities and lunge for him. Sherlock pursed his lips, sucking them clean.
John felt like he should ask something before he left. About the deal. About this flatmate business. About him in general. But before he could catch hold of a thought and pin it down, Sherlock was gone. “Yeah, he’s always like that.” Molly chirped apologetically.
Hey guys! Sorry about being so late. But I will be finding myself stuck on a plane headed for England in just under 2 weeks, so the next one might be just around the corner!
Mycroft shook his head. “I’ve heard only whispers so far. But whoever it is, they have eyes all over the city and every one of them is fixed on Sherlock.”
Sherlock turned to him. Any expression his face might have had were completely erased by the stuff on his skin, giving off the frightening impression that he was wearing a mask of his own face, but his actions signified a hint of surprise. “Industrial grade sunscreen. It’s basically paint, to be honest. The forecast says it’ll be sunny today and I plan on spending quite a bit of time outside. This is the most effective way to keep my face from burning.” As he spoke, he fastened the jar and picked up a flesh-toned bottle, applying its contents with the same efficiency.
Sometimes, you don’t need someone to pull you into the light but to step into the darkness with you.
Sherlock realized, slower than he might be willing to admit, that this was impossible and frankly ridiculous.
Because he was tired and didn’t feel like having an argument with Sherlock’s ass, John let the issue go. With a sigh, he dropped his bag onto the bed and began unpacking.
“Ok.” John sighed, hitting the end button. He looked down at the twisted, crumpled body sprawled facedown across the sofa. “…ok.”
I hope this chapter was what you've all anticipated. If not, I'm planning on making some... juicier feeding scenes to follow. This one is their first, after all.
"You're the bastard who kidnapped me." Mycroft eyelids fluttered innocently, as though he were merely caught in a some silly misunderstanding, rather than accused of a kidnapping
John shook his head and focused on easting as much as possible before Sherlock did all the research he needed and dragged him out of the restaurant.
The violin let out an ungodly shriek as Sherlock pulled the bow in a harsh down stroke. He set them both aside and stood with a growl, his face pulled into a grimace of severe distaste. “I need to make a call.”
“I am perfectly capable of lighting a fire, thank you very much. But not with crude sticks as you do. I’m not entirely convinced you’re not using some strange magic to conjure up sparks at will.” Sherlock huffed, sitting in the grass by the fire pit as John fiddled with a branch. He pulled his cloak back on while he watched John work.
"Yes he is. Tell him it’s Sherlock Holmes. I’ll be waiting.” The vampire stated definitively, leaving no room for further questions.
When John next awoke, he was alone, the vampire-shaped weight on his body mysteriously absent. The saliva pooled in his clavicle was fast on its way to drying, so he guessed that Sherlock had been away for at least fifteen minutes.
The weight of the silence became too much for Lestrade. His gaze dropped to the floor. “I’m sorry, I-“
After an athletic bout of haggling, involving a not entirely insignificant amount thinly veiled insults, Sherlock swept out of the store counting a stack of cash so thick he having some difficulty wrapping his hand around it. “Of course it’s all in ones, the self-indulgent, greedy old relic.”
After that, it had been a very short time indeed before the final lightning strike shocked Sherlock Holmes’s mind. He would’ve liked to think it was without warning, but the facts were that he’d been dodging this particular revelation for weeks.
“What?” he bit out harshly, as if disbelieving that Sherlock could be so callous as to ignore every word he’d just said to bear his soul.
He couldn’t help a tiny huff of amused surrender, aware that denying what she’d already deduced would be both foolish and pointless. So when John reentered the room and settled down on the carpet on other side of Sherlock’s chair rather than in his own, which was still vacant in expectation of his arrival, neither Sherlock nor John himself commented on the change in setting.
He watched a shadow of confusion dim Michael’s charmingly angular face when John stopped his imminent display with a hand on his chest, but his eyes flickered to where John pointed and he flushed with embarrassment, which turned almost instantly to astonishment at John’s low, ever-calm voice.
“Your bedroom door,” he clarified. “When I came up the stairs a little while ago, it was open. You never left it open when you lived here before.”
She let out a small but definite laugh at his expense, but then they seemed to share another silent, serious conversation which Sherlock understood even less than the first. Abruptly, Bea closed the distance between herself and John and wrapped her arms around the man; if John was startled, he did not show it, but pressed his hand against the thick, silken locks of her hair and held her in return. The embrace lasted only a heartbeat, and then she was bidding them a hasty goodnight before rushing out to catch up with her friends.
“She was wrong,” the detective said conclusively. “And I was wrong to listen. Sometimes I wonder if—”
When I started writing this I was planning to make it quick and simple—like 5,000 words at the most. By the time I finished it yesterday it was at 17,000+ words because these two just make everything ridiculously complicated, don’t they? It’s like their defining feature as a Sherlock/Watson duo. So I had to do that idiocy justice by making this fic unnecessarily long and full of miscommunication…or, you know, no communication at all since that’s apparently a defining feature of their relationship too. But they get there in the end, bless their hearts.
