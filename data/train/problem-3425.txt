They made quick work of tying Sam to the bed, using restraints that Dean only knew from movies about insane asylums. “Why are these here?” He asked, distracting himself from the far more urgent problem spooking around in his head.
“Ok, Dean, listen up.” Charlie stopped Dean outside of the cafeteria, eyeing him seriously. She was too nice to actually look threatening but her expression was definitely serious. “Castiel cares about you very much. If you so much as think about breaking his heart, I promise you they will find data on your laptop that will send you to jail for the rest of your life.” She said seriously before smiling brightly, contradicting her serious threat. From what Dean knew about her, he was convinced that she was not bluffing and could in fact make her threat reality.
“I… Uh…” Castiel stammered, trying to free his hand from Dean’s grip but Dean wouldn’t let him. Castiel realized he did not really want him to let go anyway, if Dean was still touching him it might mean he was not totally grossed out by him. They held eye contact for a few seconds and Castiel was relieved that what he saw in Dean’s eyes was not fear or disgust, it was genuine concern and wonder. “I… You-“
Dean frowned at that, glancing over at Castiel. The name rang a bell, but he couldn’t quite place it. “Who is that Chuck guy? Why would he be able to tell you what to do?” “He’s the headmaster. He has been, ever since this place was founded. His word is law.” Castiel said, closing his eyes, enjoying the warm sun on his face. “But why?” Dean insisted, not understanding. He didn’t want to believe that Castiel was stuck on this island forever. He didn’t want to believe that they would have to part soon. If Castiel could leave the island, they could have more time together. Castiel opened his eyes again, pushing himself up on one arm, turning to look at Dean. “Almost a hundred years ago, the first Gifted were created. They were treated like objects rather than people, sent into battle against their will, tested on. Chuck was the leader of the group that finally managed to convince the civilians that Gifted are just people, special, but people nonetheless. He was there when they signed the contract that ensures we get to live our life with the human rights we deserve. His body ages very slowly, trapping him on this island ever since the Institute was built. There is nothing we could say to convince him to risk violating the contract.” Dean frowned and shook his head. “That might be true but why does it matter? You’re a grown man, he can’t force you to stay.”
Dean frowns and takes a step towards him. “You can’t force us to stay here.” He challenges him, towering over Chuck who is calmly sitting at his desk. “Actually, I can.” Chuck says, closing his laptop and leaning back in his chair as he looks up at Dean, unimpressed. “It was hard enough to cover up Gabriel’s little stunt, I will not risk you two exposing all of us. You have developed numerous gifts that still are unaccounted for, and Castiel did not have any control over his gift until a few hours ago. Last time I saw him he was entirely incapable of even hiding his wings any longer.” Chuck gets up as he speaks, still considerably shorter than Dean but trying to counteract the way Dean is towering over him.
Coming to the conclusion that, however much Castiel willed him to, Dean was not going to suddenly disappear, Cas tried to get up, intending to at least make breakfast. Behind him, Dean stirred, still half asleep but unwilling to let Castiel go. He pulled Castiel back against him and pressed gentle lips against the back of his neck. “Morning.” Dean’s voice was soft and deep, sleepy as he was just waking up. “Morning.” Castiel replied, relaxing into Dean’s embrace, closing his eyes, a soft shudder running down his back. Maybe it wasn’t so bad at all that Dean had stayed over. Castiel definitely enjoyed the feeling of being held like that. They stayed in bed for a few more minutes, eyes closed, relaxing. Castiel almost believed Dean had fallen asleep again, but when he wound his way out of Dean’s arms Dean raised his head, pouting. “No, come back.” He said, rolling onto his back and holding his arms open for a hug. Castiel had not thought it possible, but Dean looked even more adorable when he was half asleep. His hair was messy and his eyes were sleepy. It didn’t hurt that he was not wearing a shirt, either.
They eventually leave the safety and comfort of the bathtub, but only because the water got cold. Castiel walks into his bedroom stark naked and, lacking fresh clothes, Dean follows him. They both get dressed, Dean borrowing some of Castiel’s loose sweatpants as he does not have any of his own. “We should tell Chuck about this. I want to leave as soon as possible.” Dean says once they are dressed and Castiel nods reluctantly, not ready to share Dean just yet. So instead of following him out of the room, Cas grabs Dean by the hand and pulls him back into the bedroom, stepping against him as he does. “Cas-“, Dean starts, but Castiel silences him quickly, pressing his lips against Deans. The kiss is more violent, more urgent than Castiel had intended, but he rolls with it, burying his hands in Dean’s hair and stepping even closer as Dean wraps his arms around his waist. It isn’t until then that Castiel notices how much his body needs this. The familiar taste in his mouth that is so very Dean, the familiar feeling of Dean’s hands on his body. It takes a lot of willpower to pull away. “Let’s go?” Dean asks slightly breathless and leans his forehead against Castiel's for a moment before they leave the room hand in hand.
“Okay. But why?”
“Dean!” Castiel shouted, figuring out Cain's intentions too late. He watched, eyes wide with horror, as Cain's skin made contact with Dean's, who almost immediately slapped Cain's hand away. “What the fuck, man?!” Dean exclaimed, ready to fight Cain further, but the older male only stepped back, looking at him calmly. Dean looked at Castiel as if to ask him what the hell was going on, when suddenly he felt it.
“I know. I got him.” That was not his words. It was clearly his voice, but it was not what he had meant to say, not at all. Why was he talking to Dean anyway? Dean didn't have to know what was going on in his head, he had to die. Sam wanted to wipe that relieved smile right off his face.
Then it just ended. The cramps and the pain were gone as quickly as they came and Dean exhaled relieved. Everything had lasted less than a minute, but it had been a lot more intense than what he remembered from his first breakout. This whole day had been so much more intense than any other day Dean remembered and he sat up gingerly, afraid he might start hurting again. “Is this normal?” Dean asked, his voice sounding strange in his own ears, somehow wrecked, strained.
You're important to me too. Dean thought, smiling at Castiel's little confession. He couldn't bring himself to say it. He had never said that to anyone that was not family, that was not Sam. He had never felt it before either, not like this and it scared him. He didn't want these feelings, either. Loving someone, getting attached to them meant being vulnerable in a way that Dean was not ready to face. He had seen what the loss of his mother had done to his father and he was not prepared to go through the same. He was determined to push these feelings away, because he would most certainly lose Castiel eventually. He would go back to his old life and Castiel would stay here.
The way she flinched at every movement had Dean aching with guilt and he placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. “Don't worry about this stuff, Meg, I can pick it up for you. You sit down, relax.”
“Time for breakfast.” He decided and they walked downstairs together. Apparently Gabriel had had the audacity to leave behind a mess, so Dean washed the used pots while Castiel prepared the breakfast. They talked about everything and nothing while they ate, Dean telling Castiel about his job at the Roadhouse, Sam’s scholarship, and his car, a 67 Chevy Impala. Dean seemed even more exited about his car than he had been about the movie they watched the day before. Castiel’s cheeks almost hurt from all the smiling he did as he listened to Dean’s stories. That is, until Dean pushed away his plate and looked at Castiel seriously. “I know you will not want to hear this, but I feel that we have to talk about what happened yesterday. You don’t even have to say anything, just hear me out.” Dean said and Castiel’s heart sunk. Dean had been so sweet all morning, Castiel had hoped Dean would overlook Castiel’s embarrassing behavior. He stared at his plate, unable to look Dean in the eye.
“Dean.” Sam sounded surprised to see his brother when he opened his eyes. “How long have you been here?”
Originally had other plans for this chapter, but then this sort of happened. Thus the delay, sorry about that.
Well, there it is. Again, I apologize for putting you through the pain of Dean's loss. I hope this made up for it. I also hope you didn't mind the change of tense in this one, somehow I felt like writing present tense made more sense. Let's just pretend like everything that happened before was in the past and this is now. Real time or something.
Even as he fell he still tried to reach for his son, trying to take him down with him, or maybe just to hold onto something. Either way, Dean felt no guilt as he watched his old man tumble down the stairs. Not even when he heard the loud crack that accompanied his father’s head hitting the floor. The guilt would come later that day, but in this moment Dean only felt relieved to have saved Sammy from his father’s wrath.
“What was that all about?” Gabriel asked as Meg patched up Castiel’s hand and Castiel looked at him surprised. With all the unusual things that Castiel had done and said over the course of the past few weeks, Gabriel had never questioned him, never pushed him to talk about it.
The next time Dean woke up he was in severe pain. Light surrounded him again, but Dean couldn't focus enough to realize it was Castiel's gift, developed during one of his previous deaths. The pain was too much, almost consuming all of his conscious mind. It was a breakout, another one. He should have been used to them by now, they were as numerous as his deaths. But much like every death, the breakouts were unbearable and Dean finally broke, crying out in pain as he punched the casket lid above him once, putting all of his new-found energy in it while he still could, struggling to stay conscious. His lungs felt as if they were about to burst and he couldn't even begin to breathe anymore, there was nothing left.
When Dean finally arrived, the knock at the door was hesitant, not like Dean's usual short and enthusiastic knock. At least he felt sorry for being late Castiel thought and felt some of his anger melt away already. He couldn't stay mad with Dean, he loved him too much.
“Off to shag his boyfriend. Come on, let's get you out of this room, you don't want to be right next door while your brother is getting laid.” Meg said and approached the bed. Panicked, Sam tightened his grip on the scissors. If he got up she would see them and would want to know what he was doing with them. “I don't think I can get up.” He said quickly, hoping she would not force him to go. She was right, Sam had not liked the sounds coming from his brothers room the night before, but this was more important.
Castiel smiled and shook his head as well. “No. And I might not know what a real meadow looks like, but I sure do live right at the beach. From what I gather that’s where you normal people go on vacation.” Castiel had meant it as a joke, but Dean frowned a bit. “You’re not abnormal, Cas.”
“I’m sorry, Cas. He just ran out on me, didn’t even give me time to talk to him.” Dean hadn’t noticed the boy that was standing in the door. He was about Sam’s age, had black hair and looked even more disheveled than Sam. “Don’t worry about it, Kevin. It seems like bringing him to his brother was the best way to calm him down anyway.”
Castiel took the glasses, knowing Dean was right. “I don't know how well developed his gift is. He might not be able to get into your head while controlling Sam, we can use that as our advantage. When we find them, we have to try to get close and knock him out. He can't do mind tricks when unconscious.”
Chuck listened patiently and then looked at Dean, waiting for any input of his, but Dean stayed silent, still determined not to like this idea.
Well, there it is. Major Character Death. This was the only reason I started this fic as the aftermath of Dean's death is the first chapter I ever wrote. Even though I have been thinking about it ever since I have not worked on it again and I will have to try to finish it by next week, I cannot promise a specific date though, only that this will not be the last chapter. I expect at least 2 more, possibly three as I have a lot of things I still want to mention and to wrap up.
Even though Dean did not consider himself a selfish lover, his own thought process surprised him. He cared enough for Castiel that he would be perfectly fine with jerking off in the shower later, even though his cock was screaming at him for attention right now. He slowly got up onto his feet, wincing a bit as his knees cracked, sore from kneeling on the hard ground for so long. Castiel opened his eyes and looked at Dean, looking so wrecked and satisfied, Dean felt a surge of pride. He loved knowing how good he had made Castiel feel. Castiel‘s gaze dropped down to Dean’s lips and he placed a hand on Dean’s cheek, his thumb slowly wiping off the stray come that had trickled down to his chin. Dean watched mesmerized as Castiel took his own thumb into his mouth and sucked the cum off of it.
“The sole advantage of having rich parents that feel bad for giving me away. They made a huge donation and made this possible for me. Don’t mention it in front of Gabriel though, he is still pissed that he didn’t get a second floor.” Castiel said with a modest smile, offering Dean one of the soda cans he was holding. “Thanks.” Dean took it with a smile and looked around the kitchen, sipping at his soda as he did not know what to reply.
Dean’s voice reached him through the fog that was still numbing his brain and he tried to focus his eyes on the blurred person that was his brother. “Dean.” He lifted his head and tried to move, but immediately Dean's hand was there, pushing him down. “Don't speak. Just focus. You need to focus on pushing him away. Azazel can't control you if you don't let him.”
Castiel felt her weight on the bed behind him and in no time there was a body pressed up against his wings from behind. Charlie wrapped one leg around his waist and placed one arm on top of his wing, running her fingers through the long feathers soothingly. It was the first time someone other than Dean touched his wings in such an intentional way and Cas couldn’t help but tense at the initial contact. There was no spark though, no overwhelmingly strong emotions. It was just slender fingers, stroking through his feathers like they would through his hair and Castiel relaxed into the touch. Before he knew it he slipped into a restless sleep, haunted by dreams of green eyes and apple pie.
They simply stood like this, the room quiet apart from their now labored breathing. Dean watched mesmerized as the tiny dots of light moved away from his hand now, forming rings that quickly grew bigger, spreading out across the whole wing.
“There are only 34 people on this island?”
“I am sorry, Sam. I am so sorry you had to see that.” Dean said, and Sam smiled softly, pulling back from their embrace. “Don’t be. I am sorry you had to live with this all by yourself. You’re not a horrible brother. You’re my hero, always have been.” He smiled even more, watching Dean blush.
Luckily enough, the shirt still was where Dean had left it and they made it back to Dean’s room without any more incidents.
“Language, Sammy.” Dean said, raising an eyebrow at his brother’s crude choice of words. Usually it was Sam who had to tell Dean to stop swearing. This new tone of his only proved how frustrated he was. “The sooner you learn control, the sooner you can get out of here.”
“Sam!” She called out to him, hoping to snap him out of whatever control he was under.
“The fork, Dean. Cain stabbed himself with the fork that we left in the cells. I need to go tell Chuck, he will know how else to proceed. You need to alert as many people as possible, get everyone to go to their rooms.”
“Come on in, Dean.” Dean followed Castiel‘s voice past some cantilevered steps to his left and found him in a white, modern kitchen. “Nice room you got here.” Dean said, looking around, amazed as he did not expect anything like this.
He had passed out in his kitchen, only to wake up in a strange place filled with his own things. His brother had also been taken, both of them heavily sedated. Dean hated the thought that Sam had woken up alone and scared.
He woke up the next morning, the sun shining through his window, and for a moment he did not remember what had happened the day before. He was lying atop of his blanket, but for some reason he was not cold. On the contrary, a warm body behind him kept him warm, and Castiel internally cringed as the memories from the day before washed through him. He had not expected Dean to stay the night, and he wasn’t sure if he could face him like this.
They used Dean’s flannel shirt to clean the cum off their hands and bodies before looking for their clothes and getting dressed. Castiel was buttoning up his pants as he felt Dean’s arms snake around him from behind. “You really were great, you know.” Castiel smiled and practically melted into Dean’s body as Dean’s soft lips were pressed against the crook of his neck.
Dean was still waiting for an answer as the door suddenly flew open with a gush of wind and Sam stormed in. The temperature dropped even more and Dean shivered slightly as the room was suddenly too cold to be only wearing a t-shirt and pajama pants.
“But you can. You never lose control, you can hide your gift just as well as I can. Better even. Come with me. Please.” Dean insisted, taking Castiel's hand across the table. “We can talk to Chuck again. He will understand. He has to.” Dean said and Castiel looked at him, eyes tired and shook his head. “He won't. I can't come.” Castiel replied decidedly and pulled his hand from Dean's grip. “Maybe you should go. Pack your bags.” Castiel said coolly and stood up, turning to put his uneaten pie in the trash.
Dean looked at him for a long time, trying to work out which of his many questions about this place was most important. “Can you just tell me about this place? I don’t really know where to begin.” He said as he failed to come up with anything better.
Charlie was pale, and her eyes were red and watery as she clearly had cried. Gabriel, who was standing right behind her looked no better, and Castiel's smile dropped as he noticed the blood on Gabriel's hands and clothes. “What happened?” He asked and stepped aside, letting the two of them in.
Sam focused on the presence he felt in the back of his mind and sent the words, thinking them over and over again, just to be sure.
“Dean.” Sam started, seeing his brother’s internal struggle. “I’m sure you’ll be fine.” Dean sighed at that and waved a hand at Sam, motioning him to stop talking.
my TV? Not happening.”
“As you can see, he’s fine now. I am not staying here, and if I have to swim. You can't say or do anything that would stop me.” Dean says, practically shaking with barely contained anger and Cas steps up against him, trying to calm him down by hugging him around the waist. Touching Dean, he can feel it, the energy beneath Dean’s skin, crackling like electricity just waiting to break free and wreak havoc. Castiel is impressed by the control Dean is displaying. He does not know how many gifts exactly Dean is keeping at bay right now, but feeling what he is feeling, Castiel can imagine how much will it must take.
Dean shook his head in response and she sighed softly. “Too bad. I would have loved to be the first to see it. You're really special, you know. Never before has anyone developed three gifts. It's quite fitting actually.” She added with a smile, eyes flicking past Dean, looking at Cas who came towards them, up the long corridor.
“Thanks Sammy, this is great.” Dean seemed genuinely happy with the present and Sam smiled, walking over to his brother and pulling him into a tight hug. Dean seemed startled at the sudden show of affection but quickly recovered from the initial confusion and wrapped his strong arms around his brother. “You alright?” Dean sounded genuinely concerned as Sam was usually not one to show his feelings so openly. “I’m just happy to have you Dean. Thank you for taking care of me all those years.” Sam could feel his brother laughing, even though he never let out more than a chuckle. “Don’t get all sappy on me, kiddo. You should go to bed, it’s really late.” He finally let go of his older sibling and stepped back. “Fine. Jerk.” “Bitch.” Dean countered with a smile.
Dean was on the verge of tears, hating to see his brother like this, hating that he could not do anything to help. Except that he could. His hands were shaking as he started undoing the restraints that were tying his brother down. As soon as the last bind fell, Sam's body sat up, grabbing Dean by the throat as he finally breathed again. Dean was taken by surprise, but managed to free himself as Sam was still weak with lack of oxygen.
Castiel moved a hand through his wet hair and closed his eyes, water steam rising from his wings as he used his energy to vaporize the rain with heat. Dean watched it happen, still amazed at how stunningly beautiful Castiel’s wings were. They were still casting rainbows all over the place and Dean looked around. All the way across the sky above them there was a bright, colorful rainbow, most likely caused by Dean’s rain shower. “This is so cool.” He said, taking Castiel’s hand and entwining their fingers. Even though it was incredibly cheesy, Dean liked the idea that Castiel could make him so happy that literal rainbows appeared.
“Whatever, bitch. I’m just glad you’re learning so quickly. I might have to stay here a while longer.” Dean said, leaning against Sam’s desk. “What do you mean? I thought you wouldn’t have to learn to control your healing ability.” Sam looked confused and a little worried, eliciting a sigh from Dean.
. Nothing exciting ever happens in them.”
the freak?
Dean was surprised to find himself getting hard already and he was sure Castiel could feel it too as he placed one leg between Dean’s, pushing his thigh up against Dean’s crotch. Dean returned the favor, rubbing his leg against Castiel, feeling the other man’s length hardening against him.
of all people? Finding out that some people have special abilities is one thing, but I just got thrown smack in the middle of it because apparently I am one of them. I still didn’t even have time to wrap my head around that whole thing and now I am a special kind of freak? With not only one gift, but two? It’s too much. I’ll get Sam and then we’re the hell out of here.”
?” Dean said, accusingly pointing to the spot where he had been lying mere minutes ago. “I almost died earlier! My own brother almost killed me. The only reason why he didn’t kill me is that I have some magic healing abilities.” Dean spit out the words, glaring at Castiel as if he was blaming him personally.
Dean remembered the way he had felt when thinking about somebody else touching Castiel’s wings and tried to imagine how he would react to Castiel saying what he had just said. He reached out and placed one hand on Castiel’s knee, searching physical contact, smiling even wider when Castiel shimmied a little closer, his leg brushing against Dean’s now.
A cold chill ran down Castiel's spine as he realized what the white object was that Cain had stabbed himself with. It was the broken off and sharpened end of a plastic fork. The same fork that they gave to the prisoners in their meals.
Now he was mentor for the older brother, who had not shown any signs of a gift yet. He couldn’t help but notice how attractive the other man was, and again, he cursed Chuck for giving him this task. Castiel had already been nervous to begin with, but now he was full on terrified of embarrassing himself.
He finds Dean kneeling in his bathtub, still clothed, frantically cleaning his hands and face. He's kneeling with his back to the door and Castiel stands in the door for a few moments before he realizes that Dean is crying. Immediately he is at Dean's side, hugging him over the side of the tub, much like they did earlier today. This time Castiel is the one comforting Dean, and Dean hides his face in Castiel's neck. Castiel runs his hand though Dean's hair and watches the slightly pink water run down his wrist. Neither of them say anything and they sit like that for a long time, the hot water from the faucet fogging up the room. “I killed someone.” Dean says eventually and Castiel looks at him as he finally pulls back from the hug. “Well, they did kill you first.” It's the only thing Castiel can come up with and apparently it's the right reply as Dean manages a smile. “I love you.” he says, and Castiel places a hand on his cheek, smiling back. “Let's get you home, Dean Winchester.”
Dean stood up as well and followed Castiel’s lead as he put away his tray.
He stepped into the kitchen and the first thing he saw was his brother’s favorite beer, spilling out onto the tiled floor. “What the…?” Sam did not get to finish his sentence before he spotted his brother, lying on the floor, passed out. “Oh fuck, Dean?!” Sam ran over to his brother, pressing two fingers against his main artery to look for a pulse. Fear flooded through him as he could not find one and he picked up his phone to call 911. He gave them his address and described the situation, trying to stay as calm as possible. After he hung up he tried to turn Dean onto his back but his brother was heavier than he looked and Sam started to panic as he still could not find a pulse. “Dean? Oh god Dean, please wake up!” He tried shaking his brother before picking up his phone again and calling Bobby. “Bobby? You need to come quick, Dean is passed out, I think he…” Sam couldn’t finish his sentence as a sharp pain pierced right through his chest. He clutched his hand over his heart and dropped the phone, gasping in pain. His vision started getting blurry as the pain seemed to spread throughout his entire body. The last thing he heard before everything went black was Bobby at the other end of the line, asking him what was going on.
Dean swallowed hard, looking for something, anything, to say. How could Sam remember what had happened almost ten years ago and never talk about it? Sure, Dean had shut him down every time Sam mentioned their father, but Sam had never told anybody else either, otherwise Dean would have gotten in trouble for murdering someone.
He couldn’t even begin to comprehend what Castiel had tried to tell him. He had seen things today that were absolutely impossible. His own brother seemed to somehow have control over the weather and, according to Castiel, Dean also had some hidden talent that was yet to be determined. It was impossible, yet Dean even felt different. His whole body felt strange. It was like all his muscles were straining and it might have just been the sedatives but Dean could feel the change that his body had gone through. His breakout, or whatever Castiel had called it.
The feathers of Castiel’s wings rustled again as he pulled them closer to his body as an involuntary response to the question. Not once in 28 years had anyone touched his wings. They were extremely sensitive and in a way Castiel felt that letting Dean touch them would be more intimate than even the sex they’d had earlier. At the same time he trusted Dean to be gentle and a small part of him had even hoped Dean would want to touch them.
Castiel shut him up with a kiss, wrapping his arms around Dean who nudged his side in return but didn't move, even when Castiel loosened his grip. Instead he leaned against him, soaking up the much needed physical contact. A month ago Dean would have never allowed himself to have this, would not have admitted how much he needed it. He closed his eyes, head leaning against Castiel's shoulder and before he knew it he drifted off, not really sleeping but not entirely awake either. He was exhausted from the earlier sex, but mostly from being faced with this problem. Worrying so much was mentally tiring. Time passed faster like this and seemingly mere minutes later Castiel nudged him gently, startling him to full consciousness.
The look on Deans face made Castiel feel self-conscious again, clearly he had overdone it. It was not his intention to intimidate the other, he imagined that mentoring him would be much easier if Dean was not afraid of him. He let the flow of energy cease and it was a relief to hide his wings away again.
“Cas.” He said, low, warning. The voice in his head was horrible. Sleek and mocking as it continued.
Again, I am sorry for the following Angst, but like... not really ;)
It was Gabriel who finally broke the silence that was only interrupted by the sound of Castiel's broken sobs. “Cas, you need to get up please. Let's get you into your bed.”
With Castiel's support, Dean actually manages to make it to the bathroom without his legs giving in even once. Castiel even has to help Dean undress, not because Dean is too weak, but because the blood that soaked into Dean’s clothing is all dried up now, making the fabric stick to his skin in the most unpleasant way.
Sam, who had been looking at his own hands, still shocked about what he had almost done, looked up surprised. “You’re studying already? I thought you said you were 18.”
“Huh. He has to show me that some time.” Dean said, again feeling like everyone else had way better powers than him.
Castiel collapsed onto the bed, Dean's heavy weight making it nearly impossible to breathe. Luckily, Dean rolled off of him, lying on his bed next to Castiel, panting just as hard.
Sam simply did as he was told, he had no idea what was going on, but he knew his brother well enough to know that this was serious. He kept his eyes glued to the floor as he was dragged along the corridor. He did not see the man that stepped in front of him until it was too late and he had already bumped into him. “Sam, no!” Dean's shout came too late, he looked up into the face of a stranger. The man had dark hair and apart from his unnaturally fair skin, there was nothing special about his appearance. His smile could have seemed friendly if it hadn't been for the cruel look in his eyes. It wasn't until those eyes flashed yellow that Sam realized his mistake. “You are mine now, Samuel.” The man’s voice was cold and ran shivers down Sam's spine. “Why don’t you come with me? We’re gonna have so much fun together.” Sam did not want to, it was the last thing he wanted to do but he couldn't help himself. His feet followed the man's orders before his mind could decide not to.
“Look, Cas.” Dean said, extending his hand to Castiel and smiling warmly as the other man locked fingers with him. “I don’t know what I saw earlier, but I definitely saw something. It looked like… Wings, maybe?” Castiel’s smile immediately vanished and the instant fear and shame in the other man’s eyes made Dean regret bringing it up.
. Dean thought to himself as Castiel failed to respond.
“Fuck off.”
Sam stumbles to a halt, missing the last step and if Dean hadn't been there to catch him he would have fallen. Sam's hands immediately reach for his brother, even as his brain fails to process the situation.
“No.” Chuck says simply when they finish their story and ask him to organize their departure, seemingly unfazed by the fact that Dean came back from the dead.
“A little water would be nice. A bath, maybe.” Dean says and hesitantly sits up, revelling in how happy this simple movement makes him. The last time he was able to sit up this easily seems ages ago. Almost immediately, Cas is up to get him a glass of water, somehow managing to go into the kitchen without really taking his eye off Dean. “Don't worry, angel. I'm okay.” Dean says as he gets up, muscles still weakened and exhausted. With his healing abilities he would have thought his muscles would take less time to recover. Then again, he has just repeatedly come back from the dead, maybe he should slow it down a bit.
“Whoa.” Dean didn’t know what to say, everything about this place was still very surreal to him. Finding out there were two serial killers here with him was just the tip of the iceberg.
Dean flinched at the sensation of a hand on his shoulder, only to realize it was Castiel, trying to get his attention. “Dean, I need you to focus. He is locked up in here, all alone, only his brother to talk to through the link you just felt. He is bored and will make your visit here a living hell if you let him. You can block him out though, you just need to focus on me.” “Okay, I think I can do that.” Dean said and watched Castiel as he slid the food through two of the slots near the floor. “Now we wait.” Castiel said, but Dean didn’t even hear him, all he could hear was that awful voice inside of his head.
“Bullshit.” Dean blurted out, way more heated than he had intended. Castiel flinched at his harsh tone, frowning softly. “It is not my choice, Dean. It is too big of a risk.”
Castiel watched Dean’s reaction intently, tasting his own cum. Dean’s eyes dropped to watch and Castiel could see the need in his eyes. He realized he had totally neglected Dean’s cock and felt impressed by the self control Dean was displaying. Castiel leaned forward and licked a thin line up Dean’s chin, cleaning up the last of his spilled seed. He gripped Dean’s crotch and swallowed Dean’s gasp, pressing his mouth against Dean’s. “We need to get these off of you.” Castiel said against Dean’s lips, tugging at Dean’s pants. Dean was happy to comply, undoing his pants and pushing down both boxers and jeans in one swift movement. Castiel watched as he stepped out of them and pulled Dean close again.
Castiel smiled and shook his head. “I think something did happen. Look around.” Dean looked around but couldn’t make out what Castiel was talking about. Behind him was the back of the gym building, beneath him was the dried out grass, in front of him was Castiel, smiling warmly, bright sunlight giving him a somewhat angelic glow. Dean couldn’t even begin to look up, the light was already making his eyes water from just looking around without sunglasses.
“I don’t know.” Castiel said reluctantly, knowing full well that Dean did not like his brother. “I could go with you. To the shift.” Dean offered, looking at Castiel. He had been wondering about the cells ever since Castiel first mentioned them and was dying to learn more about the psychopaths they held. He had a feeling Castiel would not willingly give him much more information than he already had. This could be his chance to satisfy his curiosity. Castiel looked less than thrilled at the idea, and opened his mouth, most likely to say no, but Gabriel was faster. “Great, thanks guys. You gotta be there in half an hour. See you later.” He said and quickly scampered off back to his table, leaving a frowning Castiel and an excited Dean.
a horrible person.” Castiel said softly against Dean’s lips before closing the small gap between them. The kiss was soft and chaste, and Castiel could feel Dean relax into it.
Once again he sat up, more carefully this time, purposefully ignoring the searing pain in his abdomen. Meg had not even bothered to give him anything against the pain, but the clarity of his mind was working to his advantage now that he spotted what he was looking for. For a moment he considered reaching for the knife that was still stained with his own blood, but chances were that people would notice it missing. He stifled a pained groan as he leaned forward, reaching for the pair of scissors that was lying at his bedside. He pushed it under his pillow and lay back down, relaxing as the pressure on his wound lessened.
Kicking off his shoes, Castiel assisted Dean in taking off his pants. He huffed out a laugh as Dean pushed him to sit of the bed. “Eager much?” He asked, looking up at Dean who just looked back at him with lust filled eyes. Dean took off his own pants and, never breaking eye contact, straddled Castiel's lap.
“It's me, Dean. Please open up.”
Finally, Dean cleared his throat and got up from his chair, letting go of Castiel’s hand in the process. “Okay, oh mentor of mine, what is the plan for today? How do we figure out what I can do?” The playful sparkle in Dean’s eyes was back and Castiel smiled at Dean, both men placing their dirty dishes in the sink. “Depends. Did you notice anything different? Strange feelings? Anything to indicate your Gift?”
“I can and I will. I imagine it is hard to control someone when you have been beaten into a coma.” Castiel said and Dean turned to him, taking one look before deciding that yes. Castiel would totally do that. Even Azazel's cockiness seemed to be put to a halt as he did not even care to reply. Instead, he seemed to withdraw himself from the conversation completely as the expression of hate was replaced by fear.
“Of course.” Cas said and stepped aside. He helped Adam put everything where it belonged and after Adam was gone, finished his table with a single candle in a glass, right in the middle. It was all the decoration he had left, most of his stuff was already packed in boxes and had been brought away for transport.
„Clarence?“ There was a soft knock at the door and just as Charlie sat up in the bed, Meg walked in, armed with a bottle of water and a single banana. She was surprised at the sight of Castiel standing beside his bed but didn't comment on it, not wanting to ruin this progress.
“Yes, mom.” Dean mumbled to himself as he walked along the corridor, now more excited than ever. He honestly hadn’t thought about it before, but now he couldn’t help but wonder if he’d get lucky tonight. He even considered going back to his room to see if they had also moved the lube and condoms from his bedside drawer into his new room. Before he could come to a decision, he already arrived at Castiel’s room, so he figured he’d just have to wait and see if Castiel would be prepared. Given the other man’s sexual history it wasn’t very likely. Dean was perfectly fine with just watching a movie though, so he knocked shortly before entering, remembering what Castiel had said.
“Oh no, no. You cannot get up by yourself, you're gonna pull out your stitches.” She said and was by his side immediately, inspecting the bandage covering his wound, soaking up the fresh blood oozing from it. “Looks like you already did. Lie back.” She said decidedly, pushing him down again and removing the bandage. “You're lucky you didn't die today, Sam. If you want away from this island, you should heal up as quickly as possible. You do that by resting and not moving.”
Nobody said anything as Castiel cried. Nobody said anything as his dark wings appeared behind him, drooping and dull as Castiel no longer had the energy to use his gift to make the feathers shine. Nobody said anything when Castiel's body finally grew too heavy for Charlie and he slid to the floor, unable to keep himself up.
“That was…” Castiel started once he had rediscovered his ability to speak, but trailed off in lack of a sufficient word.
“One day the government just sent some people and had it built. At first I assumed they just wanted to create another way to scare people into keeping this secret, but then they brought two new Gifted in. I’m not even sure if those are their real names, but they call themselves Alistair and Azazel. I think they are brothers. Apparently they killed 27 people together before they were caught and imprisoned. They then had their breakout in prison and had to be brought here. Their Gifts made it impossible for them to stay locked up in a regular prison.”
. Sam thought, pulling his restraints in a useless attempt to break free. He pushed Azazel away from him, keeping control for a moment, fighting to remove Azazel from his mind completely. He almost succeeded but then Castiel stepped up behind Dean and Sam felt pure hate flare up inside of him, stronger than any emotion he had ever experienced. Luckily he had never been good at hiding his feelings and Dean’s eyes widened as he was taken aback by the hostility in his younger brothers face.
“Spit it out, Kevin.” Castiel said with a smile, it was quite obvious to him what the boy had on his mind. “Sorry, Cas. I was just wondering if you already found out what Dean’s gift is? Sam seems to confirm all the rumors, he is quite strong and now I’m just really wondering what his older brother can do.”
“Dean!” Castiel dropped to his knees next to Dean who was lying on the floor, body shaking with the electric currency flowing through him. The rain and lightning immediately stopped as Sam stood in shock, watching his brother clutching one hand to his chest, fighting to breathe. “Oh my god, Dean!” Sam took Dean’s hand and watched in horror as Dean’s body suddenly went limp, eyes closed and head rolling to the side.
“Oh my god, you two are so sweet!” A female voice exclaimed behind them and Castiel stood up straight, turning to smile at Charlie who walked towards them quickly and pulled Cas into a tight, warm hug. “It's nice to see you, Charlie.”
They nearly didn't hear the knock at the door. Dean seriously considered ignoring it, but Castiel pulled back with a frown on his face. “What?” He said loud enough to be heard outside of the door, even from under their cocoon.
“As I said, every gift is different. The light that you saw, that is part of my gift. I can feel the energy inside me, flowing through my blood. I had to train not to let some out at all times. After I had my breakout, I was a walking light bulb for almost 2 weeks. Now I don’t even have to focus anymore, I have trained my body to channel it elsewhere. Other people have to focus in order to conjure their gift, I think it is most likely that this will be the case with you, otherwise you would have released your powers already. Sometimes it takes time until you stumble upon your gift by accident. Right now, the only things I can recommend are yoga and meditation to help you find your balance and help you focus.”
Kevin looked at his face, finally tearing his eyes from Dean’s naked chest, suddenly feeling weird for looking at it since there was nothing to see anymore. “It is a bit complicated. Basically, whenever I read or hear a language, any language at all, I can understand it. I can’t speak it myself, I just intuitively know what other people are saying and I can read texts in every language without ever having to learn the language itself.”
“How is it not my fault?” Dean asked as calmly as he could manage.
“Dean, oh god no, Dean.” Castiel snapped free from his shock as soon as Dean's knees hit the sand. He dropped to his own knees in front of him, holding him upright as Dean stopped breathing, and his body went limp. “No, no, come on, Dean. Dean breathe. Please no.” Castiel felt his throat tightening as tears stung in his eyes. This couldn't be happening. Cas shook Dean gently, trying to force him to regain consciousness, but Dean's head only rolled back, eyes closed.
“You're really important to me, you know.” Castiel mumbled against the soft skin, trusting that Dean heard him and pretending like it didn't hurt that he did not get a reply. He would still have to get used to this whole thing and he could not blame Dean for not feeling the same after this short amount of time. He briefly considered getting up from his position, but then Dean started drawing little circles and squiggles on Castiel's back with his short fingernails and soon Cas found himself relaxing, any feeling of rejection pushed away and forgotten.
Castiel’s mind was already spinning, trying to come up with a way to calm Dean down. He did not realize that he had not upset the man until he processed Deans words. “Alright then, how do we find out what I can do?”
Meg cleared her throat and Dean’s eyes flew open. He couldn't recall closing them, but then again, Castiel's actions had left his head a little blood deprived. He could feel Castiel's erection pressing against his ass, and even though Castiel's hands were only resting on his lower stomach, his touch was sending tingly pleasure right to Dean's dick.
Cas' other hand slipped under Dean's shirt and started toying with his nipple. Dean whimpered, needy, rubbing his ass against Castiel's erection. His head rolled to one side, exposing the long line of his neck as he went totally compliant under Castiel's touch. Castiel immediately took advantage of that, kissing and sucking at Dean's skin, reveling in the taste and the scent of his lover.
Dean scanned the room for his brother, but neither Sam nor Kevin were anywhere to be found. The few people that were here sat scattered across the room in groups of two or three, taking silently amongst themselves. “Looks like they are not serving yet. Let’s go sit while we wait.” Before Dean could reply, Castiel had already started walking to one of the occupied tables.
Castiel had tried to keep the conversation as matter-of-factly as possible as though not to show his nerves, but he knew he could not let Dean leave this room yet. Even though some gifts could not even be confined by the walls of a room, it was safer this way if Dean got angry and his gift slashed out.
The shirt hung loosely from his body and for the first time in a long time Castiel felt somewhat safe and at home. It was a similar feeling to what being with Dean had felt like and Castiel sobbed in frustration at the thought. The next few minutes were a blur. Frustrated, angry and despaired Castiel punched the wall repeatedly, finally relieving some of the pain, replacing it with physical pain as the final, hard blow to the wall was accompanied by an ugly cracking noise coming right from the centre of his hand.
“What?” Sam frowned, but stopped pulling his ties, resigning as they didn't give in. “Dean, I don't know what you're talking about. What happened?”
Castiel entwined their fingers, smiling softly. “Where have you been all my life?” Castiel said under his breath, looking into Dean’s eyes. Dean knew the question did not require answering, because he felt the same. All his life he had been perfectly content with occasional hook-ups, he’d even had a few longer relationships, but never had he felt like this. This man in front of him was technically still a stranger, but being with him felt like coming home. Dean never thought he believed in it, but meeting Castiel, he was sure he had found his soulmate. He tore his eyes from Castiel’s and looked at the shiny black wings again. “Can I touch them?”
Lost in thought he went upstairs. Now that he was done in the kitchen he could take his time to get ready. In preparation of this evening he had kept some nicer clothes. Black jeans that, according to Dean, made his ass look ‘super hot’ and a blue button up shirt that Castiel thought brought out his eyes. Dean had mentioned on several occasions how beautiful he thought Castiel's eyes were, and Castiel liked these compliments. Couldn't get enough of the warmth they made him feel.
“It’s okay, Dean. You’re okay.” He says simply, pulling Dean into a tight hug, holding him even as Chuck walks closer. “It is not okay! You killed someone, you took human lives! You’re insane if you think I can still let you leave this island.” Castiel can feel Dean’s body tense and holds him tighter, unsure what Dean is capable of anymore. Chuck takes a cautionary step back, and Dean frees himself of Castiel's grip with ease. He doesn't say anything though, just walks past Chuck, ignoring all of them asking him to stop and listen. Castiel agrees with Dean. Nobody is going to miss Azazel or Alistair, and if he is entirely honest he doesn't really care. He wants to leave the island more than anything, wants to be a real person in a real city just once in his life. He wants to be with Dean. He also understands Chuck though. If Dean is dangerous he cannot leave. The thought pains him, so he decides to ignore it. Dean deserves to see Sam again.
“Doesn’t it get quite lonely here? I mean, I assume that if the people constantly change it is hard to build friendships and stuff.”
“Gee, Samantha, I am sorry if I hurt your delicate feelings. I happen to like Cas, I’m not playing.” Dean said and even though he was mocking Sam, his face was serious. Sam’s judgmental expression softened and was replaced by something else, almost pitiful. He stayed silent and Dean sighed. “I’ll go get Cas.” He said, done with the conversation and turned to leave the room.
Dean slowly raised a hand, watching Castiel‘s reaction as he edged his fingers closer to the dark wings. Castiel was practically quivering with anticipation, but the look in his eyes ensured Dean this was okay. Castiel’s breath hitched as Dean touched him, but he didn’t shy away so Dean continued. Gently he ran his fingertips along the soft, silky feathers and a pleasant feeling spread through his entire body. It started where his fingers touched Castiel’s wing, and ran up his arm; tingling, strange and unlike anything he’d ever felt before. Amazed he watched as tiny specks of light appeared in his fingers’ wake, disappearing after a moment. He placed his whole hand flat against the wing and stroked with a bit of pressure, feeling the strong muscles moving under his hand as Castiel shifted under his touch. Castiel’s head fell back slightly with a deep sigh and his eyes fluttered shut as he bit back a moan threatening to escape his lips.
The two of them sat like that for what felt like forever, both of them deeply in thought, wrapped up in each others arms. Dean had successfully distracted himself from worrying about his most imminent problem, when said problem suddenly stirred, weakly pulling at the ties that bound him to the bed.
“She could have died today.” Gabriel said, placing a possessive arm around Meg who in turn leaned against him on the couch.
“Come with me, Cas. Let's leave here together.” Dean repeated, suddenly sure that this was the only possible way for them to stay together. He himself had considered staying on the island but that would mean giving up his entire life and everything that he had worked for. Possibly never seeing Sam again. And as much as he loved Castiel, and he did love him, he could not spend his entire life on a secluded island. He had only been here about two weeks and he already didn't know what to do with himself anymore. Castiel was the best company he could ask for but there was so much they were both missing out on.
He woke up and for a second, just a second he was fine. The only person that had ever held him in his sleep was Dean, so his body simply assumed that his weight behind him, this arm around him must be Dean's. It was too light though, the body was too small, too soft and suddenly Castiel remembered. He remembered that Dean was gone forever, that he would never again wake up to the feeling of Dean's arms around him. Remembering hurt as much as hearing the news for the first time, but Castiel was used to the pain. It followed him into his sleep, it stuck with him every waking moment. Charlie's embrace was somewhat soothing, but Castiel couldn't stand it for another second. He wanted the pain, needed it like he needed air, more than he needed human contact, more than he needed friends. It reminded him that his time with Dean had been real, that it had been meaningful. The pillows had stopped smelling of Dean some time ago, and the moment that Castiel had realized this had been the worst moment of his life. Well, not the worst but close second. If the pillows stopped smelling of Dean, he feared he might forget what Dean had smelled like altogether. And if he forgot what Dean smelled like he would eventually forget what he looked like, what it felt like to be with him. Nothing could be worse than that. He pushed Charlie from him and jumped out of the bed, stabilizing himself with a hand to the wall as it was the first time that he stood since he had heard the news.
They continued moving like this, wrapped up in each other’s arms, panting into each other’s mouths. The change of angle had Castiel's cock nailing Dean's prostate with every upstroke, and before long Dean was moaning loudly, unable to keep his voice down. “Cas. God, fuck.. Fuck yes. Cas.” The words that were pouring from his lips were nothing more than a mix of swearing and Cas' name and he had to rest his head on Castiel's shoulder, only held up by the other man's incredible strength.
“This is not what I imagined when I asked you to join me.” Dean grumbles when they finally managed to strip him down and Cas has him sit in the bathtub alone.
It had been a while since he last bottomed, but ever since he had first lain eyes on Castiel's perfect cock, Dean had wanted it inside of him. He was stretching himself too quickly and it burned as he pushed the third finger inside. Castiel must have picked up on the pained expression on Dean's face, his eyes widened and he placed a gentle hand on Dean's cheek. “We don't have to do this. I don't want to hurt you.” And it was so genuine and sweet, Dean moaned softly, leaning forward to kiss Cas again, panting into the other man's mouth as his own fingers worked in and out of his hole. “I want to.” Dean said quietly, wrapping his free hand around Castiel's length.
“Dean.” Cas called out, but didn't get any reaction, Dean simply walked into the hospital room and slammed the door in Castiel's face.
Castiel sighed in defeat. “Fine. You’re right. Wait here.” He said and strode through the cafeteria, disappearing through a door that most likely led to the kitchen. He came back out a few minutes later, carrying two white boxes. “It is our job to bring them their food, make sure to take everything back out of their cells when they are done and then it is time for their shower. We will let them out of their cells one at a time and supervise them so that they don’t get any wrong ideas.” Castiel explained as he arrived back next to Dean and Dean frowned. He didn’t like the though of having to watch someone shower. Castiel reached Dean one of the boxes and a syringe that Dean had not noticed Castiel was carrying. “This is the sedative that we use in case one of them needs to be knocked out quickly. Your safety is the most important thing today so do not hesitate to use it. There are tasers in the cell block, we will equip them before letting them out for shower time.” Dean nodded slowly, suddenly unsure if he really wanted to do this. “I am quite good with my gift, if everything else fails I am very capable of taking them out. You don’t need to worry. They know the rules and it is very unlikely that they act up, they don’t want to lose any of the privileges they are granted.”
“If the situation was reversed, what would you do?” Castiel asked, looking Dean straight in the eyes. There was something in his gaze, a sort of confidence and determination that made it clear he was not going to back off from this. “Fine.” Dean agreed reluctantly, handing Castiel the glasses. “You take these. You know your way around better, I will keep my head down.”
“Of course. I’m sorry.” Dean said, leaning back against one of the pillows, slouching into the sofa crease again. Castiel stood up to get the TV remote and turned on the movie before walking into the kitchen to get more soda for him and Dean. He came back and found Dean sprawled out across the whole couch, shoes placed neatly on the floor. He grinned slightly at that, placing the cans on the table before dropping into the armchair. “You’re keeping me off my own couch.”
“I'm coming with you.” Castiel stepped next to him and Dean shook his head decidedly. “Not gonna happen. You said it yourself, it's too dangerous. I won't risk loosing two people in one day.”
They stood in silence for several minutes before Dean announced he was getting hungry again. Castiel couldn’t help but smile at that, remembering how much Dean had eaten not more than two hours ago.
“For the exact reason that we are using them right now. After Gordon Walker got controlled and killed himself, these were a precaution in case somebody looked Azazel in the eye again. I'll leave you to it.” Meg said and pulled Gabriel out of the room, unwilling to spend one more minute risking him unleashing his powers on Dean. Even though he only used them for harmless pranks or his own amusement, Meg knew that he was also very capable of conjuring up horrible images. If Dean provoked him any further, Gabriel might just make his life a waking nightmare.
“Sammy.” Sam blinked at the bright neon light above him, immediately taken back to the first time he had woken up after being sedated. Just like last time, he was tied to the bed. Just like last time his head was swimming and his muscles were weak. He wasn't alone though. “You're okay, Sammy. You just have to stay strong.”
Dean and Castiel fail to have dinner.
Castiel didn't reply, and Gabriel sighed softly, blinking his own tears away. It pained him to see his brother like this, but unlike Charlie who had started crying again as well, he had the strength to keep it together. For Cas. And for Dean. He wouldn't have wanted this.
“I just thought you’d have more class than that, Dean. Did you ever care to ask why he is still a virgin? Maybe he’s waiting for a reason?” Sam sounded so genuinely offended by the thought that Dean couldn’t help but grin. “Do I have to have a talk with Jessica? She taking advantage of you?” He said, grinning even more at the look Sam gave him.
“I'm not leaving you.”
Castiel woke up and for the first time in what seemed like forever, he was alone. Every morning after Dean´s passing he had been woken up by one of his closest friends. Not today though, as he had not spent the night in his own bed. He looked around in the empty room and his eyes lingered on a single box, stowed away in the corner of the room. Most of Dean’s and all of Sam’s things had been brought away when Sam left, so there were not supposed to be any personal things left in this room. Nevertheless, the box was there and now that Castiel had noticed it, he needed to know what was inside.
“He has been with me all my life. He was the only constant caretaker I had growing up here. I guess in a way he is like a father to me.” Castiel explained and Dean’s expression softened. If there was one thing he understood it was the need to obey your father. Even though John had always been a total asshole, Dean had feared him enough to try and obey his every command. The punishment for disobedience was too unpredictable, too painful. “I just want you to be happy.” Dean said and Cas smiled, leaning down and kissing him gently. “I am happy, Dean. Right now I am happy.”
Castiel hummed to himself as he set the table. It was one of those old rock songs that Dean made him listen to over and over again, insisting that this was the only acceptable music to listen to. Castiel smiled to himself as he set down two glasses. He didn't much care for classic rock, but like with everything that Dean was enthusiastic about, he enjoyed watching Dean listen to it. This particular one had been stuck in his head for days now as Dean had played it several times after Castiel had admitted he kind of liked it.
Meg looked at him as if about to protest, but then smiled weakly and nodded. “Fine.”
“You still must have many questions.” Castiel offered, hoping that explaining everything would make it easier for Dean to stay relaxed.
Dean raised an eyebrow at what clearly was meant as a joke, and Castiel’s face immediately hardened. “And you won’t. Come on, Dean.” Before Dean knew it, Castiel had grabbed his hand and was pulling him up the stairs towards an open door. “What are you doing, Cas?” Dean asked, not liking the way this was going. Without giving an answer, Castiel shoved Dean into the room - clearly Castiel’s bedroom - and pulled the door closed behind them, locking it before turning back to Dean. “He does not get to interrupt us like that. Maybe this will teach him a lesson. Being downstairs while we fuck.” He said firmly and pulled off his shirt, dropping it on the floor before looking at Dean expectantly. Clearly he didn’t notice the reluctant look in Dean’s face because he proceeded to open his pants, all the while looking at Dean. “Go on, undress.” He said almost impatiently and Dean shook his head, opening his mouth to protest, but Castiel gripped his shirt and pushed him against the wall. All the shy behavior from before seemed to be gone, and Dean let himself forget the circumstances as Castiel’s lips smashed against his own, kissing him urgently. They made out like this, Dean pushed against the wall, Castiel’s hands fumbling to undress both of them. Dean was not much of a help, too overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events, but Castiel soon had stripped them both down to their boxers.
“Dean.” He said, grinning at the younger man. “Not so fast.” Dean replied and pressed one last chaste kiss on Castiel's lips before letting him go and getting up with him. “Good night, bitch.” Dean said and Sam rolled his eyes as Castiel got dragged out of the room by a very enthusiastic looking Dean
“When was the last time you slipped, then? The last time you unintentionally revealed your powers.” Dean asked challengingly and Castiel pulled his hand from Dean's grip. He didn't understand where the sudden hostility came from and felt that Dean had no right to treat him like this.
“Of course. I could show you everything in less than two hours, it’s a rather small island. In fact, there is only four buildings. This building is the main building. It has living-rooms on two floors, this cafeteria, a hospital wing and a library. Then there is a gym and pool building, a convenience store and the cells. The door down this hallway leads right to the beach, which is quite nice because it is always hot on this island. There also is a whole lot of nature and a mountain that you should climb some time, it has the most amazing view.”
Castiel had noticed the vomit on the floor the second he walked in. He had seen many people be brought in during his time here. Whatever sedatives they used, they were strong and they knocked some people out for up to three days. Therefore he was very surprised when he found Dean up and about in his room.
“Don’t you think it’s time to start continuing your life? It has been weeks. You’ve had your time to grieve and I understand that you loved him, but it’s like you don’t even want to get better. You can’t be sad forever, Cas.” Gabriel said and Meg stood up, done with Castiel’s hand and unwilling to witness what was about to be an emotional moment for both brothers. She had talked to Gabriel about his plan, and though she did not fully agree with him, she had agreed to at least let him try.
“Dean, listen to me.”
Both men moaned deeply at the surge of hot pleasure running through them. Castiel’s hands found Dean’s ass and he pulled their crotches together, thrusting almost desperately. He needed release right now, but at the same time he did not want this to end. Ever. Dean could barely believe that he was already this turned on, before anything even touched his cock. Now the slide of Castiel’s erection against his own had him on the verge of cumming, even through too many layers of clothing. Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean, holding him as Dean lowered his head onto Castiel’s shoulder, simply resting it there, breathing hard against the bare side of his neck.
Dean eased down Castiel's length slowly, slower than both he and Cas wanted, but he did gain anything from hurting himself. Castiel's hands gripped Dean's hips, hard enough to bruise as the older man struggled to hold still, trying to give Dean the time he needed. Both of them let out a choked gasp as Dean's ass finally hit Castiel's thighs. Dean stilled for a moment, getting used to the stretch and the fullness and Castiel tried, but failed not to squirm beneath him. Dean ran his hands along Castiel's torso, touching, feeling the incredible man beneath him. Dean moaned deeply and rolled his hips once, watching Castiel's face as he teased him.
They got dressed in record time and walked to Sam's room together. Dean walked in without knocking, immediately wishing that he had as Meg stood shirtless. Her back was turned to the door and Gabriel was inspecting what looked like painful red marks. Sam was lying on the floor near the bed, clearly passed out. All the items from Sam's bedside table had fallen to the floor, but aside from a broken picture frame, everything seemed intact. Meg turned to look at them, seemingly uncaring of her state of undress and Dean's eyes widened at the sight of her face. Her left eye was swollen and her cheekbone was red and showing first signs of bad bruising. Dean knew that Sam worked out, but he had had no idea how strong his little brother actually was.
This one is a bit shorter and purely smut, sorry about that. Next week will further the plot, I promise.
“How would you know?” Sam inquired and Dean frowned, thinking. He hadn’t even thought about that before, he had just assumed he had inherited all the family gifts. “Well, I mean it makes sense, right? I have the gifts of everyone in my family?” Sam nodded and picked up the blanket, throwing it on the couch. “Yeah, but we would also be the first Gifted you ever came in contact with. How do you know you won’t start developing more gifts because you are meeting more people now?” Dean’s eyes widened a bit at the thought and he shook his head, unwilling to accept that his brother might be right. “That can’t be true. It’s crazy.” “Crazier than controlling the weather or healing third degree burns in just a few minutes?” Dean had no reply to that and simply frowned at Sam, hating the idea more the longer he thought about it. Even though they always were very short, Dean was entirely sure he could not go through another breakout.
mark for the next few days. He realized it had kind of been a dick move to leave it above the neckline of Castiel’s shirt, but deep down he wanted everyone to know that Castiel was his. His? Dean pushed the thought away, it was ridiculous. He barely even knew the man, he had no right to be possessive.
Every other person would have made Dean uncomfortable , staring at him so intensely. Not Castiel though. Dean held the eye contact and found himself admiring how blue the other man’s eyes were. There was no denying that Castiel was an attractive man and Dean had to force himself to look away in order to remember the conversation they were having.
“How did you do that?” Cas asks, eyes wide as he painlessly moves his perfectly healed hand.
“Uh. Yeah. Would you mind getting me a shirt from my closet?” He asked, proud of his quick thinking. He could hide the scissors while she was distracted. Meg smiled at him and nodded, turning her back to him as she looked through his closet for a shirt. Quickly and without thinking about it, Sam pulled the scissors from under his pillow and sat up. Ignoring the tearing feeling in his stomach wound, he pulled up his legs and stuffed the scissors in his sock, pulling the leg of his pants to hide them just in time, placing his feet on the floor as Meg turned around.
“I'm sorry, I…” Dean started but Castiel didn't let him finish.
“Don’t be such a drama queen, Sammy. Everything is fine now.” Sam crossed his arms in front of his chest and looked out the window where the last clouds were slowly disappearing. Even though Sam was no longer looking at him, Dean could practically feel his bitch face.
Let me know what you think in the comments or by leaving Kudos, it really helps make my day. Either way, thank you for reading, I hope you liked it. Have a great weekend. <3
And Dean was right, it really wasn't. They spent the rest of the day in Sam's room, sitting on the couch, each of them testing or showing what their gift could do. Sam made progress very quickly and Castiel explained how hard it had been for him to learn to control his gift, causing Sam to beam with pride. Dean, who was sitting right next to Castiel with an arm wrapped around his shoulders, demanded Castiel should show them everything his gift could do and so Castiel did. He only ever released a little energy at once, making sure not to accidentally reveal his wings to Sam. He started off with light, holding up the palm of his hand and illuminating the room, smiling at the way Sam's eyes widened. He had already forgotten that Sam and Dean had not grown up in this world. Most gifted grew up knowing what their fathers could do and used to casual displays of the supernatural. Sam and Dean on the other hand had never known their father's gift, everything here was still very new to them.
Chuck was already expecting them, he was sitting at a table with Meg, Gabriel, Charlie and an older guy that Dean didn't recognize. Apparently they had filled him in on everything short of only the beating that Dean had taken. Dean didn't miss the pitiful look Meg gave him as Castiel mentioned it. He didn't deserve it, he was all healed up already whereas Meg’s eye looked worse as it darkened already.
“It’s late, Sammy. You should try to get some sleep if you want to keep learning tomorrow.”
? He mouthed at him and Castiel stood up, looking towards where Gabriel had disappeared into the kitchen. “What do you want, Gabriel?”
“No, I… Does that happen a lot? How many breakouts did you have?” To Castiel’s surprise, Dean sounded less than thrilled. He had expected Dean to be happy about it as Dean seemed to like the whole idea of having a gift. “It only ever happened once. Your grandfather Samuel Campbell was the only known person who ever developed two gifts. Your bloodlines, both maternal and paternal, have impressive history. You inherited the same gift that your father had, and now you are also showing traits of the other side of your family. Having two breakouts this powerful is truly remarkable. Right now we need to focus on figuring out what this new gift of yours is so that you can- Dean.”
They were just about to open a small slot in the wall to push the food through when Dean heard it. He froze, unable to make out where the voice came from. It seemed to be everywhere, resonating from the walls, but at the same time it came from nowhere at all. A cold shiver ran down his spine and he realized it was only in his head and Castiel probably couldn’t even hear it.
“I thought you were dead. We… Oh my god, Dean we buried you. I’m so sorry. I missed you so much.” She babbles, taking his face in her hands and he smiles at her weakly. “I missed you too, kiddo.”
“If we go around the side there is a path leading up top. Getting up there takes quite long though, I usually just fly.” Castiel said casually, still looking up.
In which we find out what the boys can do.
“You're not Sam.” Dean said simply, and in a way it was true. It might be Sam's body that was tied up in the bed before him, but Azazel had taken control of his mind, his actions. “Leave him alone.”
“What did he say to you in there?” Castiel asked, still very concerned, but also a little curious as to what could make Dean loose his cool this quickly. As expected, Dean’s face hardened, loosing the relieved smile that had snuck onto his face. “Don’t.” He said, looking at Castiel pleadingly. “Please don’t make me talk about it.” Castiel nodded, understanding. He did not have much experience with family, but he could imagine how harrowing Dean’s childhood must have been, having an abusive, alcoholic father. He was almost certain that that was what it was all about, some event in Dean’s childhood. Maybe the time that he got the scar that Dean had mourned the day before. It was hard for Castiel, trying to figure out what was going on in Dean’s head, but he could feel that Dean was withdrawing himself. The connection Castiel felt to Dean was still there and still strong, but it was as if Dean tried to push him out. It probably all came back to the fact that Castiel didn’t know Dean well enough. He could pick up the non-verbal signals Dean was sending, but he did not know what to say to help. Afraid of saying the wrong thing, Castiel decided not to say anything at all. He followed Dean, falling a few steps behind, trying to give him space. Dean didn’t turn to look at him until they reached Dean’s room. “Do we have anything else planned for today?” Dean asked, changing the subject and faking a smile, not wanting Castiel to worry about him any longer.
“That was great, Sam. Every time you feel your gift trying to work it’s way through you, you have to fight it like you just did.”
Castiel scanned his hand right after and the heavy metal door opened quietly.
Sam shook his head and Castiel watched through the window as dark clouds rolled closer, darkening the sky. “It’s not okay, Dean. The school's anniversary dance is in three weeks, I’m really looking forward to it and Jess will hate me if we can’t go.”
he can do.” Azazel sounded genuinely excited and Dean swallowed hard, suddenly wanting to throw up.
Whatever will to fight he had left in him died with the realization and he didn't even raise his hands anymore when Sam punched him again. He stumbled backwards upon impact and fell to the floor. Sam towered above him, smiling like a maniac as his face mirrored the joy Azazel felt at witnessing this scene, knowing he was the one who caused it.
“I apologize for nothing.” Castiel said with a playful smile. Dean rolled his eyes at him but couldn’t stop himself from smiling back.
Castiel let Dean drag him along, waving goodbye to Sam before the door fell shut behind them. He willingly followed Dean into the room next door, laughing as Dean turned to look at him with the biggest smile on his face. “What’s that smile all about?” He asked, and Dean leaned forward, shutting the door behind Cas and pushing him up against it in the process. “This.” He said simply, placing both hands on Castiel's hips and kissing him once more. Dean could feel Castiel's smile against his lips as Cas placed a hand on the small of Dean's back, pulling him to stand closer. His other hand moved up Dean's neck, long fingers tangling with slightly too short hair. Dean gently nipped at Castiel's bottom lip, tugging it before backing away altogether.
“How is he? Is he doing alright?” Sam asked hurriedly.
Raphael stared curiously at their own banjo and gave it a experimental pluck.
But then his angel appeared in the open door, bathed in the light of the hallway—holding a tall glass of water with a couple of pain pills just as promised.
Castiel barely had a chance to shoot a death-glare at the archangel before Lucifer too vanished with a wave of Jack’s hand.
"Cas," Sam interjected cautiously, "couldn't you just continue with the plan to return to your old vessel today?"
"I'm so happy for you both," Mary said taking a bite. "Oh, the cake tastes really good, Dean."
“Cas? Babe? Hey, you’re bleeding, you need to heal yourself. Cas? Cas!”
“Close your eyes, Dean,” Castiel ordered.
Once they were alone, the room emptied, Castiel asked Jack tentatively, “What about Michael?”
A few seconds into the hug, Dean realized that he—Dean—smelled like ass—and whiskey—but mostly ass. He had not been practicing much in the way of self care lately, unless whiskey counts—
The hunter scoffed, "I don't think I'm the best role model, kid."
"I'll help shower the baby!" Jack added, entering the room.
They kissed right there in the middle of the kitchen, no longer caring that the others were staring.
Castiel nodded and snuggled up closer, pressing his face into Dean's neck.
Dean sighed into the kiss as the angel leaned up into him.
“Dean needs you, Cas.”
"Hello, Dean," unfamiliar brown eyes said softly, as Castiel reached out and touched his old vessel, pleased to find that it still had a faint heartbeat.
"Sure, I'll get her all set up," Mary replied, waving for Castiel to follow.
Mary shrugged. "He seemed less than impressed that I'm going to be a grandmother and more concerned that I canceled the plans we made three months ago."
“Dean?”
“But I put this plate of food together for you—”
And without his help, Dean may die.
Cas gasped, eyes flying open to meet Dean's terrified, tear-stained eyes.
A few nodded eagerly and moved towards the room’s exit, presumably to pick up their duties where they left off.
"What happened to Castiel?" Jody demanded.
"Jacob? Too bible-y," Dean scanned the pages, "John? Oh hell no. Jeff? Meh."
Dean carried the pale angel over the threshold and gently set the petite form on the bed right next to the other Cas.
. “Yes.”
"The most important thing I think we need to ask is—do you want this baby?" Mary said with a comforting smile.
"Did you hear anything I just said?" Sam asked with some exasperation. "Where were you just now?"
"It's a tradition, thing, I don't know, whatever," the hunter replied, waving his free hand around. "Anyway, me and Sam are going to go pick up some parts I bought so that we can properly install the car seat that I am pretty sure Jody is going to give you."
After Castiel has been gone for a few minutes, Dean began to think he may have hallucinated the whole thing. The pounding in his head was relentless. Maybe he overdid it on the whiskey.
It was only a matter of time.
So he called Sam. The younger Winchester picked up almost immediately.
“Dean?” Castiel asked again, sliding off of the bed to sit with the other man on the floor.
"Yes," the angel replied simply, starting to open it. "I believe Rowena is aware that if any harm came to me her life would be instantly forfeit.”
"Dean, I wanted to assure you that you can't hurt me," Castiel replied gently.
"So, Castiel," Garth's wife asked, "do you know if you are having a boy or a girl?"
"Noisy neighbors," Sam accused with a raised eyebrow.
"Cas," Dean said yawning as he spotted the angel curled up in a chair with a laptop. "You weren't in bed."
Cas closed his eyes in resignation, ready for the end, at the same time a desperate Dean finally laid hands on the angel blade.
By some miracle the hunter managed to strip off his flannel and jeans—down to just his t-shirt and boxers—with only minor help from the blushing former angel.
A few months ago, before he gave up on everything, Dean had all sorts of plans for what he would say to Cas once he was rescued and safe. How he would confess his feelings, tell him to stay, and so on.
Dean oofed as his brother suddenly attacked him with a hug.
“I’ve got this, Sam,” Castiel responded intensely, gently brushing some hair from Dean’s sleeping face.
"Then she asked where Cas's husband was—"
, Sammy?”
“Was there a slide from Hell also?” Castiel asked curiously.
“What?”
"But the tiny flannel looks exactly like what I usually wear," Dean replied.
Meanwhile, in a certain farmer human’s heaven room—that no longer even contained its original occupant who had stopped reliving the same moment and was now in the new communal Heaven Jack had fixed up, making new memories with the souls of family members—
Castiel’s eyes darted from the vial to the slide and back.
The Winchesters barely managed to close their eyes before the room was engulfed in a bright light which then faded moments later towards the ceiling, leaving Castiel's body motionless on the floor.
"Just a minute, Cas," Dean said in apology, heading towards the door, pausing briefly to pull the blanket up the rest of the way to cover the angel’s breasts which were still exposed to the whole world.
“Oh, Jack.” Castiel stretched his huge black wings out, eyes glowing, and felt of the full and healthy, dark feathers.
"I am an angel of the lord," Castiel growled, eyes suddenly flaring with a blue glow, "I will not be held here."
"What are you talking about?" Cas questioned, running the small towel through his wet hair. "Should I get the EMF?"
“What was it you wanted to show me?” Castiel asked as they traveled to some hidden corner of Heaven and Jack removed his hand from his father’s shoulder.
, you won't be going anywhere anytime soon," the witch gloated as she stepped close enough to be visible in the light emanating from the spell.
“Dean—”
“Cas—”
The hunter opened his mouth to reply, but no words came. He finally nodded slowly.
“Don’t be afraid, Dean,” Castiel said softly, leaning into his lips for a gentle kiss.
"Oh. Yes. I am."
"I got distracted."
"You were saying?" the hunter smirked.
"I know that it will be a long while before the signs are visible to humans, but if I focus hard enough, I can sense just a tiny sliver of grace that is separate from my own."
are somehow to blame for all of this. You always are.”
The proud father rushed over and kissed his angel, as the rest of the family knocked at the door, roused by the baby’s cries.
And then there was only one gift left. They all turned to stare at Rowena skeptically who was visibly struggling at her promise to be quiet.
Dean moaned at length into the other man’s shoulder as it hit him, shuddering hard. Cas was still desperately thrusting into the hunters hand, but Dean’s knees suddenly went weak and he lost his grip, slowly sliding down to the tiled shower floor.
“Jack figured out how to dissolve The Empty,” Castiel explained, voice filled with pride. “Every angel and demon who ever lived returned to Heaven and Hell. And both realms are now permanently sealed. No more angels on earth.”
Dean never thought he'd find himself in this situation again—once again digging through the lore books on nephilim.
Dean snapped his head around, and yelped—the shock sending him falling off of the side of the bed, dinging his head on the corner of the bedside table pretty hard on the way down.
The bunker door swung open as Dean and Sam entered, carefully navigating down the stairs while hauling Castiel's empty shell in-between them.
“I met your boy, Jack by the way,” Crowley said, gesturing to Dean and Castiel. “I must say I am curious as to the logistics of how you two managed to make—”
The room cleared further.
"I don't think I'm hungry anymore," Sam mumbled under his breath.
Sam glared. "Really, Dean?"
After several tries and a few dozen expletives, Dean had finally managed to successfully install the car seat in the Impala.
"Son of a bitch!" Dean yelped, scrambling to get his robe, as his brother averted his eyes.
In a far corner of Heaven, a human soul was enjoying a relaxing day on the water fishing—the same day as every day before and after—when suddenly a thousand blades rained down from the sky around his small canoe.
"Um," the angel admitted, "I don't know that yet."
"Dean?" He managed weakly, eyes fluttering, as he felt the hunter's hands at his neck, putting pressure to attempt to keep his human blood in.
“Wait a minute,” Balthazar pulled back, “you stabbed me!”
Lucifer frowned thoughtfully for a moment before pointing accusingly at Naomi.
"I appreciate the ride to Jody's, Dean, but why won't you two be attending the baby shower with me?"
“See, I figure that if you hadn’t lobotomized Castiel’s brain so bad maybe he wouldn’t have become such a
Mary scoffed lightly, "I guess I just don't think of myself that way, usually grandmothers are older gray haired ladies that get called
"If she invited you to her coven, what's your beef?" Sam asked.
"Little oh me? I'm just out for some revenge," she cackled. "I'm out for the blood of that bitch Rowena. I had hoped that she would show up herself, but torturing some friends of hers is just as sweet."
, where are you—”
Cas tilted his head. “That is far less logical.”
“It’s late,” Sam added from behind. “You should get some rest, Cas. I can deal with—”
"Cas?" Dean watched as the angel's eyes glowed with enough power that he was able to move in spite of the spell to pull up his sleeves to reveal that runes from the floor had migrated to his arms.
“Well, I don’t want to interrupt the happy family reunion,” Crowley said,  “so I’ll be on my way.”
Dean's eye twitched.
“Earth?
After his lips met the milk, the baby quickly quieted.
"What about James?" The angel suggested.
“You didn’t know?”
Jack threw open the door to the room where Castiel’s previous vessel had been stored for the last many months.
"I see no reason why a baby couldn't wear this all the time."
Dean stared at Cas intensely, until finally something snapped inside of him. He could no longer ignore the calling of his heart.
“Wait—” Dean mumbled, “is this a
have been Cas, and unfortunately, Sam knew enough Enochian to roughly understand what was being shouted halfway across the bunker.
"Whoa, Dean," Sam interrupted, moving to restrain his brother. "Calm down."
"What neighbors?" Jack asked, visibly confused.
”Our child’s needs come first,” the angel said, pulling back, “I’ll return shortly.”
As soon as they were alone, Dean bent down over the former angel, gripping onto him in a tight hug.
Jack wide-eyed, promptly obeyed.
"I love you," Castiel replied, kissing his lover goodnight.
“But first—” Jack reached out with two fingers and touched the broken angel’s forehead. Suddenly energy flowed through Castiel, and he could feel his weakened grace soar, his wings mend, his power restored to a place it had not been in over a decade of life.
Sam breathed a sigh of relief as soon as they were able to move again, quickly checking his and his brother's skin for any remaining marks to confirm it was all gone.
dream?”
Now he swears he saw the two walk right past his door in nothing but boxers holding towels presumably for the shower.
Dean nodded, taking all of this in stride, before reaching for his gun in his pants, whipping it out and cocking it. "Now, where is this old bitch?"
"I know this is different," the angel said unsurely, "but I hope this body will still please you."
“This is all your fault you know,” he mused.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Time passes differently for me, now, even more so than it does in Heaven.” The young God looked pained. “At first, Dean prayed regularly, often, but now, recently the prayers have stopped. He is alive as he is not here. But the details are lost to me now.”
Jack sighed in disappointment as Raphael—sans angel blade—still chose to lunge at Castiel—earning a one way trip to
Dean blinked. Castiel looked over at Dean questioningly.
"Tell me what you need, Cas—mmm," Dean moaned, eyes shut tight, instinctively reaching over with one hand to grip Castiel's cock like he usually would to help finish him off—but finding only air.
At that, Castiel completely collapsed to the ground.
"Anyway," Castiel shrugged. "It's not the first time I've been called a whore."
Jack nodded in excited agreement.
"You died."
"Hey, no chick-flick moments," Dean grumbled, patting Sam awkwardly on the back.
A loud boom interrupted the witch as a side door near the back of the warehouse was blasted off its hinges, letting light pour in from the street.
Cas shut his eyes tightly and listened with nervous energy as hurried footsteps came barreling down the hallway, throwing open the bedroom door.
The former angel tensed for a moment before letting his arm relax, draped around the other man’s stomach. He sighed into Dean’s neck, hair tickling at his nose.
Enveloped in each other’s warmth, a peaceful sleep soon took them.
Castiel was waiting patiently on one of the playground benches when Sam pulled up in the Impala. At this point the sun had set and his stomach had started to growl painfully. The once angel began to think he should have mentioned to Sam that he was human now and would be needing something to eat.
“Hopefully,” Jack said optimistically, “they will make better decisions this time around.”
but in the bunker right now. He wasn’t going to presume anything, but he also didn’t want to chance it.
"Cas," Dean said seriously, "I love you for you, not for what meat-suit you happen to be wearing."
And then Castiel was at his side again, handing him a mug of coffee and a placing a plate on the table with a large helping of bacon and eggs, before taking the seat across from him.
“Jack?” Castiel asked, wide-eyed, looking up at the young man.
“Dean,” the angel replied, worried eyes meeting his own, “it’s started.”
Castiel just gaped at that, tilting his head at his old friend.
"Just what do you want?" Sam asked the witch quickly.
The hunter left his own shower space to invade the other man’s, taking the former angel’s face in his hands, and pressing a kiss to his lips under the spray of the hot water. And it was
In response Naomi threw her hands into the air angrily.
The hunter obeyed, sitting back in his chair, watching in awe as Castiel—panting and grunting—started actively trying to push out their baby.
His heart fluttered in the darkness of the room.
The first thing he became aware of was how warm and content he felt. He had said his piece to Dean, and now he could rest.
Donna rolled her eyes, "I'll get the shotgun.”
"I love you."
stares of the others.
back?” Castiel asked with concern.
This time it’s Dean’s turn to stare at Cas while he eats, the former angel seeming to marvel at the taste of every bite.
The hunter blinked a few times before sitting up with a start, eyes wide, hand flying up to his side, feeling for a phantom injury that wasn't there.
"Yes," Castiel replied without hesitation. "Very much."
“Should I get the others?” Dean asked, wide-eyed.
“Cas?” His heart felt stuck in his throat.
“No,” Castiel grunted. “I—I think I’d prefer if the next part was just us.”
Just as soon as it started, it had stopped. He felt mild concern for a moment, before several fish startled by the impact of the water jumped right up into his boat.
“Cassie!” a friendly voice called out.
“See,” Rowena scoffed, “nothing nefarious.”
"Good—good," Dean mumbled quickly as they broke the kiss. "I just—I know we usually—and I don't want you to do anything you aren't comfortable with—being in a different—and—"
"Six whole months," the sheriff repeated, "and you didn't think to mention it to your friends this whole time?"
But then he understood.
Starting to feel a slight chill at his feet, Dean leaned down for a moment to grab at the blanket to pull up around them.
"Come now, come now, no need for violence," the witch said, eyeing the sheriff sharpening a machete. "Can't I join in for this joyous occasion?"
He tried to move and found his body unusually heavy and weak.
Behind them The Empty bubbled and boiled, another tendril from the dark preparing it's final strike, readying to take its final victim.
“You’re human,” he said slowly in realization. “What happened?”
The roar of the void was heading right for them as Dean sliced open the angel's throat, his grace spilling violently into the air.
"It never came up," Dean shrugged.
Dean shrugged in his dead-guy robe and padded back down the hallway.
“The last of my grace. My wings. I’m human now.”
As Sam took another bite of egg, Jack suddenly winced, bringing a hand up to his head.
"Hmm," Castiel hummed appreciatively, obviously amused. "I don't think experiencing sex once in this body has provided enough information yet to accurately answer that."
"Goddamn it Rowena," Dean grumbled.
“Oh, don’t worry, she is fine,” Jack explained. “She was being mean so I sent her to time out.”
“If you’ll let me help you,” Cas responded, moving to pull Dean’s arm up around his shoulder.
"Sammy, this is all your fault," Dean sighed, pacing back and forth in the main bunker room as Castiel sat next to Mary at the table, showing her various Facebook memes.
"An old woman called Cas a whore." Jack stated matter-of-factly.
Dean tossed and turned in his bed, unable to quiet his mind, but he must have fallen asleep at some point because the next thing he was aware of was startling awake to Jack calling his name.
Wild-eyed, Dean hurriedly started feeling though Cas's trenchcoat, searching, hoping.
"Ew, Dean," Sam put his head in his hands in exasperation. "Too much information."
"But," Castiel continued, "I thought I should mention that, as an angel, there is no disease you can give me—not to imply that you have any such ailment—if you did it would have been erased the last time I healed you anyway—not to say that-"
"He set me up with an account on something called a
"Not exactly," Jack puzzled, "more like the static of a new station—but nothing was there—and then it was gone."
"Apparently," Sam nodded, "some sort of family squabble in their pack. He wants us to help track down the kid before he hurts himself or someone else or—"
"Hi, Jody," Castiel mumbled, smacking his honey covered lips.
a good dream—” Dean mumbled, snuggling closer.
“I love you.”
“This was one of the experiences I appreciated the most the first time I was human,” Cas said, sighing into the shower, suddenly breaking the silence outside of the water falling. “The way the hot water hits the skin is like almost nothing else.”
here, the chain-smoker's wing of the hospital?"
“At this rate,” Castiel muttered, meeting the eyes of his brothers and sisters in the crowd, “everyone is going to end up in ‘Time Out’.”
"The molecules taste better this way," Castiel explained matter-of-factly.
“Time. Out?” Castiel puzzled, tilting his head.
"What?" Dean startled suddenly, a piece of burger meat falling out of his buns.
"No."
"That is true—ah, oh Dean I can feel that in my—mmm."
It was then that Dean opened his eyes and looked at Cas—
As the hunter started to move away, the former angel looked up at him, eyes shining.
Dean stuffed another couple of pieces of bacon into his mouth before he put his foot in it instead.
At the mention of Rowena, they couldn't help but roll their eyes, even Castiel—who was currently in an unusual amount of pain.
Sam frowned slightly at his salad plate of burger toppings which Dean liked to refer to as rabbit food—he had forgotten to pick up any veggie burgers the last time they went grocery shopping.
"Now that you mention it," Castiel paused, tilting his head, "I may have felt something briefly, but I would have just dismissed it as background noise if you had not brought it to my attention. My grace is not what it used to be in contrast to you, Jack, who have the greatest angelic power of any living being."
A piercing cry erupted in the air, bringing things to a screeching halt.
“I love you—”
"May cause hallucinations?" The hunter snorted as he read the fine print, muttering, "That's the last time I take any of this sinus crap. I'd rather sneeze my brains out."
“Yes, I suppose I should explain—”
”You are a good big brother, but I’m pretty sure he’s just hungry,” the angel explained, picking up the small babe and offering a bottle.
"I will admit though," the Winchester said playfully, in-between kisses planted on his angel, "that I do miss those blue eyes of yours."
bacon.
“Jack didn’t mention how much time had passed, but—”
Dean grinned and gripped them both tightly, flipping them around so that Castiel was now spread on top of him.
"Um," the angel mumbled, eyes darting away.
“According to our new God," Crowley explained,  "a demon that chooses to go to Earth as a human, and makes better choices, gets shuffled up to the pearly gates—but if not, poof, oblivion—your essence returns to the universe or some bollocks.”
“So, get this,” Sam added to the side, “he’s just a regular human now, so if he gives us trouble he’ll be very easy to kill.”
“Oh all right,” Gabriel relented after a moment of mulling it over. “But until you call for me, I know a guy—I’m flying off to hang in this one particular human’s Heaven. It’s got a hot tub and multiple scantily clad people of various genders and dispositions—
Dinner that evening was the much the same as any other recent Thursday night dinner in the bunker—Dean cooked burgers, Jack attempted to help, and Castiel set the table. It would be Sam and Mary's turn with the dishes and cleanup afterwards.
"Thanks so much for bringing young Zackie home!" Garth exclaimed, heading to pull each Winchester and Castiel in for a huge hug one after the other. "Puberty is extra tough on a werewolf you know, and Zackie, he took a hard turn into this emo phase and oh—"
"The inside is blue," Jack pointed out. "I love the taste of blue."
He didn't even realize he had been holding his breath until he felt Dean's hands frantically feeling at his neck for a pulse.
And one of the extra bedrooms had been stripped down and prepared for the big event itself.
Jack was at Dean’s shoulder, peeking at the baby, making funny faces.
"I miss my cock," the angel said after a moment, staring at Dean hungrily, "because I'd really like to fuck you right now."
"Thank you, Kaia," the angel smiled.
"Huh?" Dean was really puzzled now.
“No, it was a flight of stairs. Told the young lad he might as well have installed a stripper pole.”
“Jack—
Baby's engine roared into life as the passenger door opened. Dean glared at his brother as he started to take a seat.
With a wave of his hand, Naomi suddenly vanished—the surrounding crowd collectively flinching and taking a step back from their supposed new God.
“Turkey bacon?” Castiel puzzled aloud, mouth full of eggs. “But a turkey is an avian, how does one turn a turkey into a product usually sourced from—”
"Nephilim," Castiel swallowed hard before looking over at the older Winchester. "Dean, I think I may be pregnant."
"That is still uncertain," the angel replied, bouncing the small boy in his arms.
As Castiel's light passed by the hospital a couple of blocks from the warehouse, the hope of a third possibility presented itself to him.
"Why would you be looking up names when we don't even know the—wait—do you know?" Dean's eyes widened.
The hunter smiled and brushed some of the long hair from the angel's peaceful face before turning his attention back to his phone. He was currently scrolling through car parts on eBay trying to figure out how the hell he was going to install a car seat in a 67 Impala.
"Cas?"
"It looks like," Sam began, eyes scanning the information on the computer in his lap, "the strange occurrences were reported a couple of blocks from that hospital over on our left, so we should be able to see it soon."
“Harder, Cas, harder!” Dean moaned, gripping at the sheets as the bed shook more violently.
"Don't worry, kid," Dean reassured as he and Sam put the angel’s old body down in a nearby chair, "Cas is going to be just fine."
"Hi, Sam," the angel greeted, completely unfazed, yet having enough modesty to partially pull the blanket over himself.
For a few minutes Cas gently fought with Dean to try and get him up out of the chair and to somewhere else better to rest before realizing his coat was quite warm now inside the bunker. The former angel paused to shrug off his trench-coat and place it on a nearby chair when he turned to find Dean staring at him through blurry eyes.
"Tell me you'll never leave me," Dean said suddenly, grabbing Cas's hand. "Don't ever leave me."
Dean looked at the angel skeptically as Castiel grinned, holding up the new outfit.
Dean and Sam watched as an angry-looking, thirties-ish, dark-haired woman stepped into the room. Without any pause, she walked over and picked up the metal door that had been blown inward, hurling it directly at the witch.
“But what of us,” one angel asked, “my garrison carried out the orders of archangels, where are they?”
The bunker did have a bit of a communal shower situation going on. Dean pondered as he and Cas walked down the hallway—
"You know," Jody began thoughtfully, "if you want, we could probably host it at my place."
Garth paused a moment after he finished hugging Castiel.
Before he even had a chance to stand up, the crowd of angels around Castiel began to part like the sea for an approaching familiar figure.
The once angel nodded, with a soft smile.
"No! You-" the hunter jumped up pacing again, unable to stand still. "Oh, Cas, it was awful-"
"Don't do this."
“What is that?” Dean questioned.
"I'm alive," the former angel replied weakly, managing half a smile.
Castiel grunted and fell to his knees with a pained expression—his eyes still glowing.
Time slowed to a crawl for Dean Winchester. He would only have seconds to act.
Dean turned another page then glanced up from his book to study the woman-shaped form of Castiel. The Winchester was still dumbstruck by their situation, a look of shame passing over his face.
Castiel wanted to ask why Jack didn’t just go down there and check.
- DEAN
"It's nothing, Cas," the Winchester shrugged, "I just had the sudden feeling that I had forgotten something important."
Castiel titled his head at the other man who was slightly drooling onto the map-table.
"I know this—new thing—we have going on between us hasn't been going on very long but," Dean swallowed. "I wondered if you were still coming by my room tonight like usual?"
"Whatcha up to, babe?" The hunter asked, leaning over to peak at the computer screen.
drunk last night,” Castiel began, moving to stand. “You need water and medicine.”
Dean nodded, eyelids heavy, and managed to stand up on shaky legs, leaning his weight into Castiel’s side.
Jack held out the empty vial again, and the angel nodded, putting away his wings and closing his eyes.
The older Winchester opened his mouth to interrupt, but the angel continued.
,” Castiel began slowly, “what happened on Earth after The Empty took me?”
The freshly formed God frowned at the way this angry, lady-shaped angel was speaking to his favorite dad. He wasn’t going to allow that.
"—or runs into hunters that aren't us." Dean said.
"Oh," Dean replied softly, giving the angel's hand a soft squeeze. "It's a good name."
Jack watched as a strange expression he could not read crossed Mary's face.
But he had never dreamed
"So—good?"
Next to him Dean stood, carefully cradling their son, James T. Winchester, who was hungrily suckling at a bottle.
Crowley frowned, glancing about the room, “What did she say?”
"Cas, at some point doesn't everyone end up named after a fictional character?"
beewatcher had been sending Dean lyrics from Christmas songs every day along with a clip of the full song. As much as Dean complained about them to Charlie and Sam, he had listened to them. He glanced back at the couple in the street and couldn’t help but wonder what festive jingle he’d be subjected to today.
Cas guided him to the bed before he sat down and looked up at Dean who was still standing. The space beside Cas appeared too large and daunting but a quick look back at Cas and Dean’s twisting stomach settled. His blue eyes were wide and understanding, a gentle smile softening his face and without thinking Dean sat down next to him.
“That’s why you left so quickly,” Cas said, and Dean nodded. He looked over when he heard Cas sigh and was surprised to see a look of relief cross Cas’s face. “I thought you weren’t out and I had pushed too much,” he explained after Dean looked at him curiously, and Dean couldn’t help but feel a burst of affection for Cas who had clearly been worried about scaring Dean.
8 Dec
The couch cushion hit Sam in the back, and he whirled around, indignation causing his face to flush. Serves him right, Dean thought savagely as he reached for the second cushion.
“Very good,” Dean replied and the man seemed to smile even brighter.
“Yeah?”
“Do I dare ask?”
“Yeah, but that was more than just watching me and a kid play an amateur game,” he said, gesturing at the table. Cas’s smile widened at Dean’s words and Dean found himself leaning a little bit closer.
“Okay then, Friday night,” he repeated. His own lips curved up into a small smile as he stared at Cas. A sudden clunk caused Dean to whirl around only to find Jo wearing a shit-eating grin as she stared at him.
“Let’s go,” he said, and abruptly turned away and led them into the maze of video games and arcade tables. Jack was bouncing along next to him and Dean could hear Cas following him but he didn’t turn to look at him. His fingers felt like they were tingling, and he clenched his hand around his own arcade card.
“Do you want a flower, Sam?” Jack asked, holding out another weed which Sam accepted gleefully. Jack seemed pleased when Sam followed suit and tucked it behind his ear, and Dean shoved down his slight disappointment at not being singled out. It was ridiculous. It was a weed and one he hadn’t really wanted to touch, let alone put behind his ear. There was no reason, at all, to be feeling let down.
He went to bed early that night, dreading the party the next day, but found he couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t quiet his thoughts and there was a loud banging out in the hallway. He considered getting up to investigate but it passed after a couple of minutes and soon everything was silent once more. He lay there for a long time, staring sightlessly in the dark. His chest ached, and he refused to think on why. It was bad enough how empty the bed felt beside him.
“I’m Dean, by the way,” he said to the young woman. “Sam’s brother.”
“It’s amazing,” Cas repeated. “You said before that you baked but this is beyond what I expected.”
“Are you volunteering to taste test?” he asked, and Dean choked on his coffee. He looked around in time to see the amused smirk on Cas’s face.
“Shut up,” Dean said quietly so Jack wouldn’t hear.
“I –” Dean’s throat was too dry, even if he could find the words he doubted he’d be able to actually spit them out. Something along those lines must have registered in his face because Cas’s expression softened with sympathy and then, slowly, he lifted his hand until his fingers were brushing the back of Dean’s hand.
Dean won the next goal and he caught himself about to do his victory dance the second time but forced himself to stay still. Cas’s face fell for a moment as though he were disappointed, but Dean didn’t have time to linger on that as he hit the puck down the table at Dean.
Dean looked up after a while and was shocked to see almost an hour had passed as he’d perused beewatcher’s account. He’d long since finished his dinner and he quickly closed twitter and put his phone down. What did he care if one person couldn’t appreciate a joke – one that Dean hadn’t even started. That was on them.
He pasted on a smile that he doubted would do much to allay Cas’s concern. He grabbed his jacket from where he’d thrown it over the back of the couch at some point and patted down his pockets to ensure he had everything else.
“I should be getting this one down for a nap,” he said, stepping away from Dean. They stood there for a moment longer, staring at each other, before Dean forced himself to turn away, calling out a quick goodbye before he slammed the apartment door shut behind him. He allowed himself a moment to close his eyes and breathe to try and get himself under control before he looked around the living room.
“Garage?” Cas frowned.
“I’ll see you again?” Cas’s voice rose at the end and he sounded nervous. Dean forced himself to look at him and found Cas with a small, shy smile twisting his lips as he gazed at Dean. Jack was in his arms, his head resting on Cas’s shoulder, but even that very obvious reminder didn’t quell Dean’s desire to kiss Cas.
“Will you be alright? You don’t have to come help if it’ll make you unwell.”
“That’s not what Alex said.”
Dean looked down to find Jack, holding onto Cas’s hand and beaming up at him.
“Thank you, Dean. For everything,” Cas added as he casted a glance over at the television. “I had a wonderful night.”
“He should still be in the building, right?” Dean asked as they crossed the street and Cas nodded.
He didn’t bother to answer Sam and instead focused on drinking his coffee, clearly not bothered by the scalding liquid as he downed half of it in only a couple of mouthfuls. Dean went slower and by the time Dean was a third of the way through his coffee Cas had finished his, refused any food Sam offered and had left the room to take a shower.
Twice, but he must have snuck out.”
Dean instantly regretted this decision as he took note of the hopeful look on Cas’s face that smoothed out the lines that stress had carved into his face earlier. His blue eyes were wide and bright as they gazed across the apartment at Dean. Dean barely took note of what Sam was actually saying and as such it took him a moment to process what was being asked of him.
“You mean after she tricked me into thinking she couldn't bake? Yeah.” Cas smiled, and Dean finally felt himself relax completely for the first time since Kelly had knocked on his door earlier.
I hope you enjoy this story!
He jumped behind the wheel of his impala and drove over to the café. The roads were empty and the streets reminded him of a ghost town. He saw no one as he drove through the centre of town and when he pulled up at the café, there was not a single soul in sight. He checked the time and saw that he was early and decided to wait in the car where it was at least warm.
He quietly laughed to himself when he found him recognising more songs than he’d expected to. beewatcher had certainly taught him something. And speaking of beewatcher, Dean glanced over at the coffee machine. He had been prepared to see Duma or the angry blonde standing there but was shocked to see Cas pouring out lattes. He had a red Santa hat sitting crookedly on top of his head which left Dean smiling.
“So… Cassie?” Dean asked and Cas groaned.
He waved as he left and Dean raised his hand, still holding the spatula, to respond but Cas was already gone and now there was pancake batter on the floor.
Dean took a long pull of his beer to try and buy himself some time but Jody’s gaze didn’t waver.
“He must like you,” Cas said. He was leaning against the couch and watching the cat wind his way around Dean’s legs.
“Wait.” Dean stared at him incredulously. “That early on?”
It didn’t occur to him that Cas might have been asleep until after he’d rushed out of his room and knocked on Cas’s door. He waited for a moment, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, wondering if he should just go back to his room and wait until morning when the door opened slowly in front of him.
Dean entered the service area and found the two of them yelling at each other. Or rather Benny was yelling, his face steadily getting redder, while Gordon smirked at him. Dean felt his own hackles rise but forced himself to calm down.
“Yeah, your dad’s not half bad,” Dean admitted as Cas picked Jack up.
“That’s life, I suppose,” he muttered. It was quiet for a long moment as Dean forced himself to finish off the pie that now tasted like ash. Cas’s hand squeezed his shoulder once more before it slowly slid down Dean’s arm until it stopped just above Jack’s head which rested in the crook of Dean’s elbow. Dean’s plate was empty now and he stared down at it to stop himself from staring at Cas’s hand. Instead, he focused on the warmth that bled into his skin from Cas’s hand.
“Uh,” he began but Jack waved the weed out to him with a rather imperious expression on his face.
“I’m Dean, by the way,” he said, hoping he came across as smooth, though he wasn’t too sure he actually managed it judging by the small smirk that settled on the man’s face.
“Well, that’s gonna change now,” Dean said seriously. “From here on out, you’re gonna get a proper education.”
“Eileen,” she said with a smile.
A quiet rustle from behind him caused him to look over his shoulder. He regretted it immediately. Cas was standing there with all the empty pizza boxes in his arms. Behind him Dean could see everyone else clearing out. Charlie caught his eye and waved to him as she and Stevie left. Jo waggled her eyebrows at him and even Benny shot him a smirk.
Cas grumbled as he pulled out their dinner, and Jack laughed.
The Italian waitress took his order and he glanced over at the coffee machine as he was walking away. The red head was at the counter, collecting two tall mugs from the barista and when she saw Dean she smiled. She said something to the barista who looked up and flashed a grin at Dean before turning back to his work.
He glanced over at the counter and caught the eye of the red headed waitress. She grinned and winked at him and he smiled at her, watching as she spun away to help an elderly man and his granddaughter find seats.
“So, this is Jack,” Dean stepped forward though he didn’t reach out to pat him. Cas was smiling softly at the cat and Dean felt something lurch in his chest. He quickly looked down while he fumbled for his phone. There was a message from Bobby, gruffly accepting Dean’s excuses.
“Uh, I’m actually throwing Sam a birthday party. On Saturday, at the Roadhouse,” he stuttered out. A brief look of confusion crossed Cas’s face before it went blank. Dean winced as guilt like acid burned in his stomach. He knew he should stick to his original plan, but he found that he couldn’t stand seeing that expression on Cas’s face, let alone being the one responsible for putting it there. Cas’s frown was something that Dean didn’t want to be the cause of even though, deep down, he knew that nothing could come of this. Nothing should come of this. “You wanna come along? I’m sure Sam would love it if you were there.”
Sam blinked. Eileen thought she might’ve misread his lips, and Cas was still frozen, still processing.
“Don’t worry about it,” She said, “It’s nice to meet you, too.”
Crowley smiled without teeth, “You go first this time.”
Dean was still staring at him as their laughter trailed off. Cas looked at him and seemed to remember something. He cleared his throat.
Cas spotted him instantly and lead Dean and Jack to the table. Jack seemed eager to see what this surprise was all about. Dean tried not to drag his feet.
“What the hell are you doing here?”
Dean closed the refrigerator. He sort of laughed, but trailed off when he glanced back at Cas’ strained expression.
“Sammy and I are meeting at the unemployment agency right now. Wish me luck?”
“What’s your sweetest drink?” Jack finally asked.
Logan, Malia, and Kelly headed back to the bunker around 10, but Sam stayed to help with the dishes. He also wanted to set up his Christmas present for Henry, which was a tire swing in the backyard. He insisted Shannon didn’t have to free her ass off to keep him company, but she bundled up anyway and they debated which Christmas song was the sexiest.
He heard a chair creak, then pages flipping. Sounded like they were getting back to work. He waited.
He looked over at Cas, smiling in the fluorescent kitchen lights, and it hit him. He could talk to Cas about Stanford, and they could figure out what their future looked like together. No matter what shit hit the fan, or champagne hit the cake, they could find a way to laugh. They could try to be happy together.
“Yesterday,” Cas said. “Did he ask you to come here? If he wants his things, he can pick them up anytime.”
As soon as the door shut, Dean turned to him.
“I don’t know what to do with myself. This past year, it’s been all about finding you and Cas. I’ve helped some other hunters, researched stuff. I fell in love. Now I just don’t know what to do.”
“Of course you did,” Cas said.
Michael won custody and Cas was rushed off to a celebratory family dinner. Afterwards when there was a knock on the door, he knew who it would be.
“I need to crash here for a while,” Dean said then quickly circled back to, “Goddamn, did you pack your entire brick collection in that thing?”
, Dean thought before he could think better of it. He felt a sick twist in his stomach.
“That was the most beautiful speech I’ve ever heard,” Kelly said, crying.
“What’s wrong with a little flirting, Cas? I thought we were
Charlie hesitated. Maybe she should still go after them. But maybe Cas wanted to talk to him alone. She had some choice words for Dean after that display, but there would be time for that later.
“Are you okay?”
Dean stood in front of the mirror in a tux, pulling down his sleeve. He looked himself up and down, doing a last-minute check for cocktail sauce. There were appetizers in the house before the backyard ceremony, so he grabbed a few. Sue him.
And now, Cas stood alone in their living room. He let his head drop to his hands.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “I’m not good at this type of stuff.”
She laughed, but Sam wasn’t going to let him change the subject that easily.
“Cas, you had a fight. Okay? It was just a fight. Families fight. Jack needs time to cool down, but that’s no excuse for you to go out for a pack of cigarettes and never come back. You were just trying to help. That’s not so bad. I don’t think anyone needs to call CPS.”
“Right.” It almost felt like Cas was watching them from another table, watching himself screwing up this extremely important conversation between father and son. He knew he needed to support Jack through this, he remembers statements like that from the books, but how? What was he supposed to say? When did Jack even realize he was gay? Was that something Cas was allowed to ask?
“No.”
Cas was stunned. Sam and Eileen were equally taken back.
He got hung up on the word home. They’d called the bunker home for a while but it was still freshly weird to see it written, to know Cas was the one who typed it. It was their home, and Cas wanted him there by 5. He was so hung up it took him a while to register the rest of the text.
is it too late now to say sorry?
Dean turned toward the table, but Cas was standing right behind him.
“I can tell you the secret ingredient,” he leaned toward her and lowered his voice, “if you want.”
Cas stepped forward, “I know. I’m sorry. I should’ve been honest from the beginning. I was trying to help but—”
Dean’s eyes widened with delighted shock.
“I didn’t ask you to do that.”
Dean grabbed the eggshells and took them to the trashcan.
“I applied for their English Ph.D. program last winter and I heard back in March. I didn’t tell anyone I applied because I wasn’t sure I’d get in. And I didn’t.”
“I’m sorry, alright? I forgot that we’d organized the renovations to start this week, otherwise I would’ve given you a heads up.”
“It’s his day off,” the server said and Dean looked up to see the red headed waitress smiling at him.
“Where from?”
“Who is it?” Jack asked just as Han Solo was revealed on screen.
Cas’s confused frown eased and was quickly swallowed up by a rather sweet smile.
“Night then,” he said and moved forward, meaning to go around Cas and to his own room but Cas was still standing in the doorway. Dean gave him a look, his eyebrows raised and Cas slowly moved out of the way. He turned as Dean moved around him and for a second Dean considered staying, something feeling different, but he was too tired. It was probably just his imagination anyway.
“I – yes,” he managed to say before Cas’s answering smile blinded him. He stumbled forward as Cas tugged him into his room, the door closing behind them with a gentle click. The air suddenly seemed heavier, the room smaller and Dean couldn’t meet Cas’s eyes anymore. He felt as if he couldn’t breathe and he tightened his grip on Cas’s hand, trusting Cas to not let him go.
Sudden movement from Charlie’s bedroom caught Dean’s attention and he forced himself upright and into the kitchen. Breakfast was the least he could do for letting him crash on the couch. Soon enough he had the coffee pot on and bacon sizzling on the stove. He finished cracking open eggs into a bowl that he had pushed to the side before he reached for his phone again.
“I’m glad you thought so…” his voice trailed away and it took a moment for Dean to catch on but when he did he grinned and almost knocked over his mug in his rush to respond.
“I understand if you don’t want to. I can take him with me to the library. I’m sure they won’t mind too much,” he rambled even as he started to turn away. Sam shot Dean a classic bitchface and Dean quickly called out to Cas before he could leave.
Now that Cas was missing his coats, the layers Dean was wearing caused him to grumble until Dean reluctantly let go of Cas to return the favour, stripping his jacket and plaid shirt off but Cas’s hands were at the hem of shirt before he could pull him back in. He pulled the shirt up, his hands skimming Dean’s stomach which caused him to laugh. Cas glanced up, his hands pausing for a moment and looked at Dean. His hair was a mess and his lips were a dark red and swollen. His cheeks were flushed and he was smiling at Cas warmly causing Cas’s stomach to flip. He pushed at the shirt once more but Dean grabbed hold of his wrists with another laugh.
For the next week Dean managed to avoid Cas and Jack. He would rush from the staircase (the elevator was still broken) on tiptoes and unlock his apartment door as quietly as he could. He worked so much that it honestly wasn’t that difficult to avoid them during the week, but he’d had to beg Charlie to host game night Tuesday, much to her displeasure, and he was already dreading what favor she would pull out of him in return.
“Mostly westerns, but I also like Vonnegut.” Castiel nodded encouragingly and Dean could feel his embarrassment leech away. In its place a small, warm kernel of pride took up residence in his chest and he sat up a bit straighter. “I also tried Tolstoy. Took me ages but I eventually got there.”
“Oh, this just gets better and better,” Dean muttered. He looked around just as Jo arrived with his burger and a raised eyebrow.
“Great,” she said. “He owes me big time.”
“Now we match,” Jack said cheerfully and then proceeded to grab Dean’s hand and begin leading him over to Sam.
for helping me polish my story. And a huge thank you to my artist
“My heart’s fine,” he said through a mouthful of egg and shallots. Sam raised his eyebrow but Dean chose to ignore him.
“Take that back,” Dean said harshly. Charlie stuck her tongue at him as she dumped several bags on the couch. One glance revealed them to be full of decorations.
“All good, brother?” Benny asked quietly as everyone began to descend upon the pizza. Dean glanced over at Benny, who was frowning at him in clear concern which Dean hastened to wipe away.
“What?”
Unable to resist and eager to move away from Cas’s side before he did something monumentally stupid, Dean stepped forward and called out to Sam.
. Dean felt something sink in his chest and he turned back to his phone with determination. He opened it up and saw a twitter notification waiting for him. It had only been posted 30 minutes before and Dean wondered, for the first time, whether he should follow beewatcher. It was ridiculous. What had started as an argument about a straw goat had somehow wandered into Christmas music and teasing one another. If Dean didn’t know better he’d think it was flirting but that was ridiculous. beewatcher was a grad student. Why would they consider flirting with a nerdy mechanic? One look at his twitter page would be enough to show Dean’s sense of humour and intelligence. Not like beewatcher’s page at all.
“You too,” he said, smiling briefly at them. He saw something yellow on the man’s jacket and for a moment he stared at the tiny cartoon bee that was pinned there. The couple turned away and Dean watched them walk up the street, arm in arm. The bee had reminded him of his twitter pen pal, or so Charlie called him.
‘We’re getting a sofa,’ he said and Dean nodded as he reached out for Cas who went willingly. A quick kiss and then Dean pulled back to rest his forehead against Cas’s.
“There’s also this for you.” He hurried back into his bedroom, ignoring Sam’s protests as he grabbed a roughly wrapped present from the top of his dresser. He tossed it onto the counter beside their half-eaten breakfast and poured himself another mug of coffee. “Happy birthday, bitch.”
Wait. What?
“Can I ask you something?” Cas suddenly asked. Dean put his mug down and nodded, overcome with nerves once more. “Why did you leave so suddenly the other day? I know you had work but you ran out like you were scared.”
“Eileen and I share some classes,” Sam explained, and Dean bit back a laugh at how obviously uncomfortable his brother was. There was a long awkward pause before Dean realized Cas was still standing next to him and Eileen’s gaze was now drifting towards him.
“Hey Anna, large black coffee please,” he ordered.
“—to Dean!”
Dean could only stare at him even as they continued down the stairs. There was nothing he could say in response to that. And, sure, Dean knew exactly what Cas meant because that was the predicament Dean had found himself in all week, but it was one thing to acknowledge it to himself and a completely different thing to say it out loud.
“Do you like to read?”
“You’re forgiven,” he said slyly. “And I’m sorry for trying to lure you out of your non-existent closet.”
“Yeah, Jack was great,” Sam said, and Cas turned away from Dean to meet Sam’s eyes. Dean took a deep breath and pushed himself off the couch. The strange heaviness seemed to have evaporated though Cas’s gaze still weighed on him when he looked back.
“I thought… I thought you remembered and were wanting me to say it too,” Cas said and Dean hesitated. The air around them suddenly felt thick and heavy. One wrong word would ruin this with no chance of fixing it, so Dean took his time thinking. He nodded slightly to let Cas know he’d heard before he frowned, unable to think of anything to say.
He scowled at his phone and, without thinking, he began to reply.
The door to the café opened, allowing a gust of chilly air to enter the room. Dean watched as several patrons grumbled and cast scowls at the young man who entered. He was wearing a thick coat over a vee-necked sweater. He sauntered over to the coffee machine where he leaned over to talk to the barista. The barista froze and turned to stare at the other man, a growing look of horror on his face. In his hands was a tin in which he was steaming milk that he had apparently forgotten about.
“Oh, that movie. I’ve never actually seen it.”
“Yeah,” he whispered before clearing his throat. “Yeah, you will.”
“Yes,” he said slowly. She nodded from her position at the counter.
“His fairly small for a cat, we think he was the runt of the litter. He’s a tabby,” Cas explained as he followed Dean.
‘Definitely.’
“Sorry,” Cas whispered and Dean looked over at him quickly. He couldn’t read the expression on Cas’s face but Dean shook his head silently.
He’d just pulled out his mixing bowls while singing along with Robert Plant when there someone began banging on his door.
It was a graduation picture in which Cas was easily recognizable. His hair was just as messy under a graduation cap as it was now. He was smiling at the camera, squinting in the bright sunshine. Next to him was a woman with brown hair that fell around her pretty face. She was shorter than Cas and was smiling brightly at the camera. Cas had his arm around her as they held up their certificates.
It's here!!! My fic for this year's Pinefest. I had so much fun finally bringing this story to life out of the murky recesses of my to-be-written list. A big thank you to my beta reader
“Don’t what? I didn’t say anything,” Dean said, raising his hands in surrender.
“Sam would?” Cas asked, and Dean swallowed. Cas seemed to already know what Dean was thinking as he stared intently at Dean.
“Ah, yes?” Dean winced when his voice rose at the end, twisting his answer into a question. The barista raised an eyebrow but mercifully didn’t say anything. Instead he placed the plate down next to Dean’s coffee.
“Yes?”
“No,” he said softly. “I lived there my whole life but… I no longer fit there.”
Can you guess what song from Evermore I listened to on repeat while writing this? (Hint: your hometown skeptics call it)
“It was torn up,” Dean continued, “Into tiny pieces, so I know you were mad when you did it. And the night before, Gabriel told me you turned down Brown to follow me. Which ended up being a big mistake because I screwed up and left after a year. So when I found your Stanford thing, I figured you decided not to apply so you could stay here. With me.”
“What did you say after he told you?”
Cas let go of his burger, and it splattered on the floor.
“Hey!”
“Well…thank you, Laura,” Dean looked Lisa up and down, slowly, then smiled like he liked what he saw. Lisa flushed, but she was smiling, too.
“You can’t,” she said, “but that’s because many people on Earth suck shit. Jack’s got us, and you, and I think he knows we all care about him. You can show him you support him, but you can’t protect him from everything.”
“Cas sounded really worried on the phone.”
“Come on. Let’s just grab him and go, we still need to find the plate,” Dean said.
“Not if you had a hot vampire husband to keep you company.”
“I wouldn’t shoot them somewhere bad. I just— this is important Sammy, it’s the last piece. And it’s better to go in prepared for the worst-case scenario. I don’t need this right now.”
“Speaking of real estate,” Sam said, very casual, “Dean says he’s getting his own place.”
“Then what did you mean?” Cas asked sharply.
“I’m coming too?”
“I’m glad,” Cas forced himself to respond.
“You paid that man. . . to date me?” He didn’t raise his voice. It was an icy sort of anger.
Gabriel grinned, “I think I speak for everyone when I say, we’re so happy for you crazy kids. Well, maybe I don’t speak for Lisa.”
“I don’t want to hear it,” Jack said, “and I never, ever, want to see you again.”
He slept most of the day, exhausted but safe in the bunker. They’d just killed Chuck and saved the world, hopefully for the last time, and he deserved some solid shut eye. So did Sam, who Dean assumed was also holed up in his room.
Sam stood, “My brother and I are collectors. He’s really passionate about the Joyous Discus. We appreciate you tracking us down.”
“Dean?”
“Dean, just tell us what happened. It’s probably not as bad as you think,” Sam said.
“Hey, man,” Chad held the phone up to his ear, “mission’s over.”
“But then on my birthday, he sent me on my first solo hunt. It was a salt and burn, pretty basic, but, uh. It was at an abbey. Two nuns fell in love, and everyone found out, and they killed themselves. I got what he was trying to say. Like, look what happens to people like that. When you do shit like that, you get caught, and then this is the ending you get. And these ghosts, I mean, I’d been hunting for years, but these ghosts were ugly.”
“Will Dean be back tonight?”
“Maybe he doesn’t want to talk to you because he doesn’t think you feel the same.”
“Well, it’s not.”
He had no idea what to do.
“Maybe I should call him,” Anna said glancing at her phone.
“I don’t work out,” Jack said, trying his best to follow the conversation.
“You need to relax, man. Let’s grab a shot of liquid courage.”
Cas took a long drink.
“Thank you, Jack. And if you don’t like the drink, let me know. You could always try something else,” she looked at Jack through her eyelashes, “on the house.”
“Guys,” Sam said, “C’mon. I don’t think Cas wants to—”
“Technically the first time we met was in Hell.”
The world was in black and white.
He cracked four eggs into the pan and turned up the heat.
Dean laughed a little.
“Dean, hi. I don’t know if you remember me. I’m Shannon Blight. My son, Henry, told me you needed this. You took the one from our living room, but the real piece was in storage.”
That didn’t make sense. Not at all. And if Sam knew
“I meant embarrassing. Most of the stories involve copious amounts of blood and guts.”
Ed’s was decently crowded. One booth was crowded by a family of tourists, a few others occupied by couples, one with a young man sitting alone. Two people sat alone at the counter. The décor in this diner hadn’t been touched since ’52, but the smell of fries was too strong to care about things like dusty old juke boxes.
Already Dean could feel himself scowling as opened up twitter. Immediately he felt himself stop glaring and stare at what CBee had written.
‘Yeah, I definitely believe Alex now,” she said before walking away.
Dean nodded and just watched Cas for a moment. It was a relief to know that he could watch Cas now without having to feel guilty, though, even as he thought that, his insides twisted as he thought over the implications of his own actions from the past few weeks.
“So am I,” he said, and Cas smiled before turning away to the coffee machine.
“Dean, this is my son, Jack. Jack, Dean’s our new neighbor.”
Before he could say anything, however, Cas was already speaking, a small smile gracing his lips as he stared at Dean.
“Goodnight sweetheart.”
“My babysitter.” Cas headed over to the door and Dean drifted after him, helpless but to follow him.
Cas was crossing the floor when Dean turned back to him and got a good look at him. Cas was wearing a pair of dark jeans that hugged his legs and a dark blue button up that perfectly matched his eyes. Dean felt his mouth dry at the sight of his bare forearms.
“Who’s that?” Jack asked with wide eyes as Princess Leia ducked away from R2D2, and Dean grinned. While he himself had always been partial to Han Solo he understood the fascination with Leia. The chick was a badass, as Charlie liked to say. Mostly in defense of her drunken tattoo choices, but it was true nonetheless.
He poured himself a mug of coffee and watched as his tweet loaded. He glanced back at beewatcher’s post and his scowl deepened. Before he could talk himself out of it, he’d already opened a new post.
“DEAN!”
Eventually they pulled apart to breathe and Dean panted, leaning forward to rub his nose against Cas’s. He laughed when he felt Cas smile again though his laugh quickly turned into a yawn which caused Cas to laugh in turn.
But now, as he bent down and picked all the fruit up, he felt as if his shoulders were slumping under the weight once more.
“Eleven,” Cas repeated. “Thank you both again.”
“Uh, fine,” he muttered, glancing down at the box in his hands to avoid that intense gaze. “Sorry.” He held out the box in question and the man took it though he didn’t look away from Dean.
‘How well do you know this guy?” he asked.
“Off you go, then,” he said and Cas rolled his eyes at him before returning to the counter. Dean watched him go, his chest almost uncomfortably warm and his cheeks starting to ache from his smile.
