“Oh,” said John, as the swelling popped with a satisfying wet
“What’s a contract?”
It occurred to him, a bright pearl of a thought in the cloying fog of lust:
“John, where are you going?” Mike asked.
The poor animal had been split open from throat to belly.  Like how Mike’s dad had shown them how to gut a fish.
The entire time he spoke, Sherlock paid rapt, unblinking attention to him. “Fascinating!” he declared. “Negative and positives and they have acid inside. And they can explode. You must get me some batteries.”
“You’re going to get yourself killed one day,” Mycroft had said, on both occasions.
“I think he likes you,” John said, still laughing as Sherlock attempted to disengage the slug as it stubbornly clung to his leg. It was a rather cute slug, as far as slugs went, patterned with spots - so that it was like a slimy little legless leopard. John wondered if there were any slugs that came with zebra stripes, but so far he had not seen any.
“Right,” said John. “Same here, I guess.” He tries not to stare, but Sherlock had said that he didn’t have any friends. And here they are, two strangers, come to his grave bearing flowers, in every breath mourning him.
“I wouldn’t get it. I know,” she shrugs. “Look, I’m not going to pretend I am.” She peers into his face. “I think I stopped getting you a long time ago, little brother. Well, ever since you up and moved in with a mad detective to play Ginger to his Fred.”
“I’m not...I wasn’t…” John sighs. It’s too late to debate this. He just wants to go to bed.
“Yes, yes, John H. Watson,” Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes.
“He’s sorry, John!” Mike interjected quickly. “He didn’t mean it!”
These lovely photos provided by the adorable
out there, in the dark night? And why wasn’t Sherlock afraid?
“There’s some part of you that enjoys being scared,” Sherlock said - and John’s mouth ran dry. When had Sherlock come so close? His movements were so fluid, he poured like ink over the leather seats and suddenly the distance between them was nonexistent. “I can hear your heart pounding from here,” Sherlock said, and his face was so close, and he placed his hand upon the center of John’s chest. “I can feel it.”
The reality of John’s skin was warm and soft in a way underneath Sherlock’s hands. The muscles in John’s arms were tense still, battle-ready. How Sherlock wanted to unfold him.
“Wow! Did you deduce that, too?”
“Tom!” she said, shaking Mr. Watson. He was sound asleep next to her. “Thomas, wake up, I heard something at the door.”
“Oh, god.” John’s nose wrinkled up at the sight of the photo. “What’re you doing with that? You said the angle was wrong to see anything useful.”
The first time Sherlock kisses him, it’s up against the lockers in warm, hazy afternoon and John watches it happen in slow motion, the way they say that your life slows before your eyes right when you’re about to die.
"You're very observant," Sherlock said.
It was such a relief, then, to see Bill and Mike wave him over, although the moment he sat down, there was a noticeable shuffling noise as students shifted down the table, away from him.
John shuddered, and tried not to think about it. Which, of course, it meant he pictured an undead army of love-hungry zombies who all very much wanted to kiss the Necro-Romancer.
“Like this?”
Nausea overwhelmed him in rolling waves, as certain and as inevitable as the tide. He retched once and vomited what little was in his stomach - half a sandwich: prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, bitter greens on croissant - eaten earlier that day, mostly water. He retched again and heaved dry, and shook, and could not stop his shaking.
Hazel began to feel better when they hit the M27, and the feeling only improved the longer that they drove. Highway in front of her, the ocean further and further behind her.
John exhales slowly. “No.”
“I know!” Victor laughs. “For a whole week that dickhead had me believing he was an American student from L.A., right up until I heard him talk to the professor after our Biology class.”
“John!” Hazel shouted, as if her little boy was only hiding, playing a game. Her voice was loud in the night; large in the small, dark room. She could fill up every corner with it.
The first years were ushered into the Great Hall, and there was so much to stare at, the floating candles and the ceiling that looked like a night sky. The Sorting Ceremony was about to begin, and John felt his heart do a thing where it was apparently trying to escape his body in any way possible. Oh, he knew Sherlock had said Gryffindor, and Sherlock was amazing. He believed Sherlock, really he did. But what if he was wrong? What if John was sorted Hufflepuff, or worse, Slytherin? Harry had told him all about Slytherin - that was where all the Dark wizards came from. Mum didn’t like to talk about Dark wizards or Dark times, but Harry had come home brimming full of gruesome information, with John her eager little sponge.
Or John might say, “Jeanette’s been telling me about this book she’s reading called ‘The Second Sex’, it sounds fascinating.”
He remembers not remembering his own name.
” John said, puffed out in a little breath of desire, “of course.”
Logically, Sherlock figured, the sooner he gave John what he wanted, the sooner he could get what
"What does she mean to you?" John wants to know.
She kissed like she danced, leading him. As if she were saving him the trouble. Other girls expected John to be gentle with them, but Jeanette was not gentle with him. She crawled over him easily in the back of his momma’s car, she put her hands wherever she wanted them without asking if it was all right. It was more than all right. He was amazed at her daring; he found her amazing.
“I wish I could say it was an interesting fabrication,” said Sherlock, in that fancy way he had. “But Powers’ story is predictable at best. Completely lacking in creativity. Troll-level, even.”
John was nodding, begging, “Please, Sherlock, please,” agreeing “yes, yes,” over and over again as Sherlock stroked him and his cock rubbed inside of him. He was sultry with heat, fevered with need, mouth open panting hot, insides squeezing, and oh, how he needed to be fucked, good and hard and
"You live at least 5 miles away from the school."
Then again, that might have been his concussion talking.
As John launched into yet another tirade about people who did not finish their course of antibiotics and how the human race would all be wiped out by an epidemic of superviruses that we ourselves created, Sherlock picked up his violin and
They place their flowers down on the grave, side by side.
“He was an idiot,” says Sherlock. “That’s why he’s dead.”
“Do you believe in God, John?”
"Oops," said Sherlock blandly.
Sherlock pulled back once more and shoved his cock back in hard, claiming, taking what was his. John cried out, pushing back against him. The bed shifted and rocked with the rough movements, headboard knocking against the wall with rhythmic thudding, chain sliding and clinking against his back in quick percussion as he fucked John the way he had been wanting to, yearning and craving and simply
(pls message me on tumbls if you did not get your pdf!! traumachu.tumblr.com )
In truth it had taken 96, and Sherlock let him. He had expected this, and he knew there was a high possibility that John would attempt to throw a punch. He’d seen John fight, in the first week of school, after hours out on the football field where some of the jocks’ dull idea of entertainment was to test the mettle of the new kid. In the end, John had tested them.
That wasn’t possible.

But Sherlock was

native to southern Mexico, grown best in tropic or sub tropic areas. Commonly used for keeping bales of hay together.”
John found himself staring up at the Head Boy, a Slytherin, tall and imposing. His eyes widened for a moment, wondering if he was in trouble, before he considered the fact that he had every right to be here. It was a free hallway, after all.
“Who was it?” John asked, reaching out to smooth a hand over the cranium. It was so surreal, so disturbing and yet so cool at the same time that it was a real human skull.
His legs pumping. He had to keep running. He had to. He was dodging amongst the trees. But not once did it occur to him to hide. There was no time. There was no place to hide. He would surely be found out.
He had not come to school with an innate hatred of Gryffindors, really, the way that they had seemed to all come to school with anti-Slytherin prejudice. It was as if they had all been read bedtime stories of the Big, Bad Dark Wizards and how that they had all come from Slytherin and there had been Dark Times.
“It’s something doctors do to sew up a big cut,” John explained. “Like one time I fell out of a tree and I hurt my leg  and I needed stitches. They give you an injection with a needle so you don’t feel it and then they take a special needle with a special thread and they sew you up. It’s really cool. Want to see my scar?”
“John,” Sherlock said again, reaching up for him now, tugging him back down onto the bed. He began to tug at his clothes, unbuttoning his shirt frantically, running his hands over John’s skin as if he were searching him for gunshot wounds.
On Jeanette, however, Sherlock had no witticisms or snarky observations to share.  John might say, “I’m thinking of taking Jeanette down to the roller rink. What do you think? Is that all right?”
The thought makes him desperate, like a drowning man grappling for the pier. His hands grab for whatever he can reach; his hands sliding up Sherlock’s chest, on Sherlock’s shoulders, fingers curling on the back of Sherlock’s neck, reaching down between them to palm the hardness pressing against him, making himself feel hot and making Sherlock curse suddenly in his ear.
. And I certainly don’t see why not. It’s not like they don’t get
John narrowed his eyes at him. It wasn’t
, flashing red, this man might be looking to hurt him, looking for a fight and not a f-- the other thing, the word that still makes John feel hot and flush a little, even inside the privacy of his own mind.
Instead he looked at himself in the mirror, once again. His hair had stayed neat, where he’d combed it down. He looked astonishingly well for someone who had been missing as much sleep as he had; there was even a healthy pink flush in his cheeks. Behind him, in the mirror, was his bedroom. Comforting, familiar, everything in its place: the perfectly made bed, the lamp, his bookcase, the record player, the locked door, the closed window.
“Your  Wand-Light Charm is really good,” John said, interrupting Sherlock’s thoughts.
He could practically see John’s hackles go back up. “No!” John snapped. “Last I checked, molesting their significant other with a camera was
“Sheriff Lestrade wouldn’t actually do that. Not
In 1939, Julius Robert Oppenheimer, who would one day father the atomic bomb, wrote that a star that has exhausted all its useful nuclear fuel can no longer support itself against the inward pull of its own gravity.
It sounded just as dumb aloud as his mother always said, and he fidgeted in his seat, looked down at his scabbed-over palms. His knees stung. Surely he should be nearing home by now? The ride seemed to be going on for longer than he remembered, even though the road was familiar.
“What are you doing to him now?” Sherlock demanded. “And what, exactly, are your accreditations?”
didn’t know anything about, but kind of wanted to.
and his fifth time around
"Obviously, I'm taking pictures of you." He danced back another step, holding the camera high so John couldn’t reach it. He snapped another photo, just in case it got something interesting. “So you can have a better photo than that catastrophe of a blog avatar you’ve been using.”
"Nonsense," Sherlock replied brusquely, and gave a pustule a vicious squeeze.
John spluttered. "That doesn't even make any sense! That's not even possible!"
"Sherlock," John moans out low, scratching hard down the flesh of his back. "I wanna...can I?"
Thomas was speaking to the lifeguard on duty, who had not seen anything either.
“Hey!” John protested.
She reached over and ruffled his hair, something which she knew that he hated.
“Any way is fine.” John hasn’t slept that long in...forever, it seems. The last time was after a case, catching up on three days of lost sleep. A lifetime ago. “So you can’t make tea, but you can cook.”
They stop for dinner in Baxter Springs, Kansas. They walk into the restaurant with both of them still covered in dirt with little clouds of dust nearly puffing off of them. Sherlock introduces them to an uncaring waitress as Al and Lucky, a pair of good boys “just passin’ through, not lookin’ for no trouble.”
Victor shakes his head. “I’m shocked that he never told me about you. I mean, we didn’t talk much, anymore, and it wasn’t as if I expected an official announcement, but a text would have been nice.”
. I observe. I deduce. The information is all there for anyone to access, it’s not my fault that the rest of the world is composed of blind imbeciles content to walk around in the imbecility of their awful, pointless lives.”
“For He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day-”
"But it doesn't hurt," Sherlock said.
“Oh! That’s right! I suppose Bill has something to say,” Mike said.
There had been a time when John had stopped Sherlock from touching him anywhere below the waist. There had been a time when John had reminded Sherlock “just kissing.” Now here he was, standing practically naked in Sherlock’s garage, being fondled and clutching at Sherlock’s shoulders, moaning for it. Wanting more than just touching.
John shuddered, made another sweet sound for him, and tried, bless him, how he tried. Sherlock watched, enraptured, as John strained to lick with his mouth already stuffed full of cock. He hissed at the feeling of the flat warmth of John’s tongue fluttering lightly against the underside of his cock, attempting to lick and only managing the tiniest of laps, almost tickling the base of his cock.
He told John about fish, all the different, wonderful kinds of fish, their colours and shapes and sizes, and the way they moved through water. How you could get lost in a school of them and all around you would be thousands of flashes of moving silver. His fingers traced careful patterns on John’s collarbones, and he told John how they could have tea in the skeleton of a whale. They could chase each other and play hide and seek, darting in and out of the massive white columns of its ribcage. He told John about how he swam with dolphins, leaping as they leapt, swimming underneath them, and how a dolphin would let you hold onto its fin for a breathtaking ride.
"Oh," says John again, softly, a world of realization in the sound. He scoots himself closer, close enough so that their thighs are pressing together.
Out there, beyond them both, was the quiet, empty street - devoid of life because of curfew. John thought of how he knew all the neighbors’ names and how they all knew each other’s business, how he knew everybody at school and everybody knew him, and how small it all was. It had been that way for as far back as he could remember, and would continue to be that way for as far as he could see.

And there, again. It was only a blur, a- a wrongness.
He wanted to turn away but he couldn’t. He wanted to hear what else Sherlock had to say, but he knew he shouldn’t.
Sherlock’s voice in his ear:
“The only thing that could make you even more handsome is a top hat,” said Bill.
And no matter how quickly he ran, how hard he pushed himself, the forest never changed around him. The same trees, over and over again. Was he running in circles? He wasn’t going anywhere. He wasn’t making any ground. If anything, he was
Sherlock smiled up at him, gracious, and then he peered inside, his damp curls brushing against John’s tummy. “Wow!” he said.
and began to study The Draught of Sleeping Death. It seemed like it could prove useful.
“What do you want in return?” John asked, suspiciously. It was the first bribe offer he’d ever gotten, and people generally did not bribe someone because they wanted wholesome things, like help walking their dog.
Victor starts, then he laughs.
“I think I’ll be okay,” he said.
John stared at him, frozen, the spoon sagging forgotten to the table where it left sticky little puddles of honey.  He looked a bit shell-shocked, but his pupils were blown so wide Sherlock thought he could probably see John’s retinas if he just looked closely enough.
” Sherlock said, and the melodic thrum of his name made John want to, really want to. He wanted to say ‘
” John protested, as if that was a reasonable excuse for anything.
“Still in your uniform,” Sherlock remarked, and traced one finger delicately over John’s bared collarbone where his shirt was open, trailed it down to his chest. “Ought to change before it gets dirty.” His hands were stained with grease; grease turning his palms into roadmaps, turning his nails into dark half-moons, striking against the close-to-God cleanliness of John’s white shirt.
But it felt good; deliriously good. The scrape of his teeth, followed by the wet, soothing touch of his tongue on the smooth sensitive skin of John’s inner thigh.
“I’ve been to school,” said Sherlock airily. “I didn’t find much use for it. Do you know there’s people out there - a committee - who select all the textbooks that everybody’s meant to read and then all the schools buy them up, and then the teachers teach you these books that might just be completely wrong. Your history book was written in 1911. What you’re actually being taught is how to follow rules. Not to think for yourself. And they never want you to ask the real questions, do they?”
“Yes,” Sherlock confirmed. “They are slug-bullies.”
“Hmm,” John said, considering it for a moment. “Well, okay. Just a little peek.”
“Rough day, huh?” Greg said, surprisingly sympathetic.
The first time they’d had penetrative sex, Sherlock had been careful and slow with him like this, lighting him up nerve by nerve till John’s entire body was a single yearning vibration of greed. Now his stare was setting John on fire too, penetrating him as thoroughly as his touch, dissecting every breath, every twitch of his cock, the flex and flutter of his stomach muscles as John fought to swallow his moans.
Occasionally there were advertisements in the Lost and Found section of the Classifieds for missing pets, but they only ran for four, maybe five days at the most.
“You thought you were drugging me for an experiment!” John rebuked.
"I can still walk!" said John, and he slid off the stool to prove it and nearly broke his nose in the process. Lestrade stumbled forward and caught him, just in time.
"Yes!" said John, excitement fizzing  up inside of him, like bubbles rising to the surface. "Can I bring Harry?" Harry would love to see these things, he was sure. They always went on adventures together.
John had the most unreasonable objections sometimes. (There was quite a noticeable body in the photo, of course, but it was not the one that John was thinking of. ) Sherlock frowned. “What
“So he’s like an Umgubular Slashkilter?”
Not far to go now. He was as cool as a mountain stream. Like a deer with the safety of the forest in sight. He wasn’t bothered. His stalker didn’t need to know that he could feel his clothes being peeled away inside that insidious imagination. That he could imagine the soft wool against his face as it cleared his body, the tug of buttons pushed through holes and undone till his shift unfurled around him and left him exposed... He rolled his shoulder and cleared his throat.
“Oh gosh, I just don’t know,” John said, all big baby blues and innocence. “Somebody must be setting a bad example.” He slid his hand down between them and cupped Sherlock through his jeans.
bat-man,
“I saw something, Tom,” she said, after a moment. She shuddered to remember it. “There was...something in the water with him.”
“John!” Sherlock said, scandalised. “Leave that alone. Firstly, that’s evidence. Secondly, that’s what
Brain must be working again.
He’d always imagined a girl, soft and fragrant, holding hands and going steady. Vague ideas of sharing milkshakes and dances, eventually white dress and chapel bells. He’d never imagined this, lips wet with another boy’s saliva and wanting to try it some more, hard body against his, stomach clenching and flipping when he thinks about it. The impossible feeling of his heart flipping like it’s been turned upside down and is now trying to right itself, over and over again until it doesn’t know which way is up. Sherlock’s hand underneath his chin, leaning in to brush their lips together and John’s whole body gone warm and tingling, trying to come alive, and he’s not quite sure which way is up.
“Bill nearly lit his wand on fire the other day because he wasn’t concentrating enough. I wish I’d known  how to do it a few years ago, it’s really useful and it’s heaps better than a night-light.”
While they talked, Sherlock held the dressing to John’s wound with one hand and a mirror with the other.  When he got tired they switched off. The mirror was so that John could watch his own wound heal, which had been John’s idea. He hadn’t even worried when he’d made his request - both his mother and Harry could not stand the sight of blood, and most people told him it wasn’t right to want to look at gross stuff like that.  Sherlock, instead, had acted like it was the most normal thing in the world to want to watch one’s own head wound slowly knit itself together (and really, why wouldn’t you?) and had been pleased that John had taken an interest as well.
“Jesus,” Sherlock hissed.
"Promise," John insists, pulling just slightly away.
No one noticed.
When she lifted her head up to look, however, it was gone.
“Don’t talk about him like that,” said John.
One and half. John was now one and a half drinks away from dancing on the bar.
“Have you ever thought about what you want, John?” A siren call of a question, a silken trap.
John was certain that anyone who cast an eyeball at him could see the glow in his cheeks and the absolute perversion in his mind. His sin was written all over his face. The evidence of his crimes was tattooed all over his skin, everywhere he’d been kissed.
Sherlock shoves his jeans down halfway, too frantic and hormone-suffused to be graceful about it, to take them off properly. His dick throbs with fresh near-pain when he has it out in his hand and he looks at John panting beneath him, eyes wide and half-stunned, watching Sherlock with both nerves and anticipation.
Red juice dripping. He was lost, he was losing himself. This was sin, he’d given himself over to the licking flames of hellfire, his sins had found him out, and there was a cold scrape of sharpness over his skin like the dull edge of a knife.
Sherlock slid his hands up John’s neck by way of answer, tilting the man’s head up to the ceiling, baring his throat. Much more room to suck and kiss John to distraction. John stopped protesting the moment Sherlock’s mouth latched onto his jugular, leaving a trail of wet, shining marks down his throat.
“Sherlock,” John breathed, and looked up at him. “Is it really you?”
Flash.
His smile was so sweet, sharp little white teeth showing.
John is sitting cross-legged on Sherlock’s bed, cold beer in his lap, held in place by his legs. Victor is lolling about on the other side of the bed, long limbs half-dangling over the edge, and not particularly caring, three sheets to the wind already. He’s humming a tune to himself that’s very familiar, but John has trouble placing it.

“You should not worry about anything at all, because I will not allow you to be expelled,” Bill said. “I will testify for you on the stand, even under oath!”
being broken? The only real difference between the innocent and the guilty is that they can
Sherlock was happy to oblige. He grabbed John firmly by the hips and turned him over. There was a certain amount of force but no violence in Sherlock's touch. John thought that he might not have minded if there had been.
There had been a gun in his hand tonight, and a gun held against John’s temple. There had been a man who was no longer, nothing where a man used to be, and a blank nothingness inside Sherlock where sickness used to be. The scent of hot fresh blood and the heat of intestines was familiar but right now there was only summer rain heat flooding his nostrils, the sound of John moaning in sheer pleasure beneath him and John’s insides around him, hot and tight and perfect, and Sherlock's limbic system was lighting up in all of its complexity, all the axons firing electrical signals like stars flaring in the dark.
“What’s your name?” John asked, as he took the boy’s hand in one of his.
“Bill was just joking,” said Mike.
“That doesn’t even make sense,” Sherlock said, although he was appalled at his own slightly petulant tone.
“Don’t call me that,” said John, face scrunching up in distaste.
It’s just that he likes the other thing, too, and that’s a bit less good and not at all right.
Greg shrugged. “Ah, well. Like we say every year, there will always be next year.” He grinned. “And we’d have much better chances, you know, if we have an unbeatable winning team.”
should both be expelled!”
He thought he ought to apologise, because surely stalking was a rude thing to do. He thought he ought to explain himself, because it was Sherlock’s character and reputation and possibly immortal soul that were at stake.
,” John said, because Sherlock was, all of him, a mer- well, boy, with a tail, with everything. Sherlock preened, twisting his tail so that all his scales gleamed handsomely in the sun. His smile was sharp and white.
“Yes,” said Sally grimly. “But that’s not all. He did - and still does - perform experiments on people. That’s not a rumour. Kids have lost hair and teeth! I’m surprised no one’s lost an eye!
John didn’t see anything in the bedroom other than the dark curtain of Jeanette’s hair falling around him as she pushed him onto the bed. The sheets were alarmingly, surprisingly pink. He saw the grey of her eyes and the sweeping shadow of her lashes and then he closed his eyes as well.  He felt her body surge against him and his own surged in response. It was happening. His first time with a girl. It was really happening.
Sherlock’s tongue, his cock, plunging into him at the same time. His tongue was sliding in, slippery, caressing the soft pink velvet of John’s tongue, exploring his mouth. And then more of it, and still more, it was completely filling up his mouth, it seemed to lick the back of his throat. It slithered in like a    black     serpent, it seemed to push in, all the way down his throat, sliding down,   down,    to his insides, to lap at his organs, and John couldn’t breathe,     he couldn’t breathe
“Come, let’s get you back into bed,” she said, and took him by the hand.
John didn’t know. He didn’t know how a person could be like that, talk like that, live and breathe like that. And he would have gone on fine not knowing, lived his whole life not knowing, but the problem was, Sherlock had seen him too.
"You could be like Batman," John whispered.
John huffs. "I don't need a ride home today. I'll walk."
“We’ll practise flying together, John,” said Mike warmly.
The moans fell out of John’s mouth like golden coins, rich, tumbling, unrestrained.  Press of Sherlock’s hand on his wrist, reminder to stay, and then hands on his thighs, spreading him open, keeping him open, exposed.
“Isn’t it obvious?” Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes. John didn’t mind.
It takes time, and patience, but Sherlock is nothing if not methodical. One by one he could catalogue all of John Watson's responses, stimuli and response, cause and effect.
It was the first time that John had ever used the word
“He’s out there with Harry. I’m sure he’s just swimming in the water.”
“Yes,” said Sherlock, nodding slowly. “Yes, that is a sound.”
"Sherlock!" John said, unable to help smiling - his second smile of that day - despite the fact that he was in very real danger of being kicked out of Hogwarts forever.
“Don’t tell me what to do,” John said.
"What’s a Darth Vader?" Bill demanded. "Is it some sort of Muggle-esque Dark Wizard type thing?"
“Hurry up! I want to show you something!”
“Only
He reached into his pocket, now that he was alone, and gently fingered the soft ear of the small stuffed puppy toy that he’d carried onto the train with him. It was embarrassing, he knew, to still have a stuffed animal at eleven, but he’d had Gladstone ever since he was a baby and he didn’t know how he could possibly sleep without him. Especially since he’d be so far from home…
Downstairs, right now, Mrs. Watson will be making herself a coffee that is four parts Irish whiskey.
Sherlock collapses beside John, panting still, the beat of his own heart loud in his ears, eyes wide but unable to focus. Saturn is above them. The whole solar system is above them. The mobile that hangs above John’s bed sways lazily in the breeze, the planets waltzing in slow circles, suspended from string.
“Oh!” Sherlock said, and did not make fun of John for still having a doll at eleven years old. Instead he turned the puppy over and over in his hands, very carefully, as if he were made of glass instead of soft fibres.
John, after a moment, noticed himself being watched. He turned slightly towards Sherlock and the artificial lights of nighttime London lit half his face, the other half in shadow. His hand brushed against Sherlock’s as he turned.
Head of House,” said Sherlock, who was being appalling again.

And Suzy had an intense affection for an inarguably ridiculous little dog.
But now, right here, right now, in this space, there is only the sound of John’s panting breath and the warmth of John’s body pressed against him, shivering with the fervor of tiny earthquakes.
“I’m closing the window now,” John said, definitively. “And... you shouldn’t come back here.”
“Well, If I’m really
“Well, it’s not every day that one comes back to her office to find a Mexican standoff awaiting her,” said Professor Hudson as she arrived.
“Don’t make me do that again,” said John, burying his face into Sherlock’s neck. He hugged back, holding on as hard as he dared. “I felt so awful. And it wasn’t right.”
Sherlock watched John sit down, laughing again now, cheerful again, and he knew that he was right. He should have felt very happy and pleased with himself.
Sherlock abruptly stops.
Sherlock rested both his hands on the waistband of John’s red swimming trunks. “This comes off, right?” he asked. “Can I see?” He was curious, like a cat.
Sherlock has been bored of Kansas since Missouri, and he is sick of corn - or so John gathers, as these have been the main sources of complaint for the past hour or so. John likes Kansas. It reminds him of a home that he had, once. The farmlands roll on forever in waves of green and gold, the air rich with the smell of cornfields and sorghum in the sun. At the next place they stop John buys a placard that declares, “There’s No Place Like Home!” bordered with sunny-yellow stalks of corn.

I was prompted: drinking/drunk headcanon/fic. Have a little preslash with it, with a smattering of angst.
John looked into the water, feeling a horrible sadness welling up in chest that he’d chased Sherlock away. He hadn’t wanted to be rude, he hadn’t wanted to be mean, but he’d offended Sherlock something awful, and now the magical boy was gone. Probably forever. He looked back at the cave, just a great big hole in a rock, really, no longer promising now that Sherlock was no longer here. Maybe he would try and find Harry, who would refuse to play with him because she’d found a pretty girl to play with instead. Or maybe he’d go back up the beach to sit with Mummy and Daddy, and be told to play quietly, that it was too hot to run around, and why didn’t he find Harry if he wanted to splash in the water?
“If that’s a new pet name I’m havin none of it,” he finally decides, after a moment. “Also, yes, judging by the sign you are standing next to, we have crossed state lines and are now, officially, in Oklahoma.”
Typical Gryffindor.
He has a nice voice; a golden tenor. “Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly…”
John had thus far believed in Sherlock, but Bill and Mike were genuinely concerned for him. It wouldn’t do to make them worry unnecessarily, especially over something so unduly frightening.  So for the next week, John watched Sherlock closely, to look for possible signs of him being a Reincarnation of Pure Evil.
Out in the middle of a grove, splattered and splotched with shadows, there sat a familiar little table set out underneath a large tree. John recognised it as the kitchen table that they - he - had had at Baker Street, that had been far too damaged from acid burns and scratch marks to sell. He had left it behind in the flat when he moved out, the same way that he’d left most of the things there. They had never belonged to him in the first place, but at some point during his time at 221B he had stopped thinking of them as
And Sherlock would answer, “Who?”
“Of course wizards have comics,” Sherlock sniffed disdainfully. “But I do not waste my time reading said comics, because they are puerile and childish.”
“And sweets,” John added helpfully.
It was Sherlock who surged forward then, wanting to hear a different sort of

“A dickhead,” Victor supplies helpfully.
“I’ll tell everybody about that
John made a small sound that vibrated straight up Sherlock’s cock and into his balls. Sherlock fought the urge to shove in, the urge to thrust, and only barely managed to contain himself. Instead he rocked gently, back and forth, on John’s tongue.
“I...I suppose not…”
“What a trap. What kind of idiot pays 25 cents for a penny’s worth of twine?” Sherlock asks rhetorically.
name? Who is the one that you call Master?”
“You obviously don’t know what you’re doing and you do need my help.” Sherlock rested his hands lightly on John’s thighs, rubbing small circular patterns into his jeans with his thumbs that John barely felt. Just barely. “I am more experienced than you.”
“I haven’t-” he tried to deny. I couldn’t help it, any of it, he wanted to say.
House points!” Bill bemoaned, and looked wretchedly down at his bowl. “I could just
"There are so many things in the ocean," Sherlock said. "Things you can't even imagine."
He was driving Sherlock
“You don’t have gills,” he said, and he stroked, very gently, along the sides of John’s neck. His fingers were slippery like little fish. John giggled at the tickle of them sliding, smooth against his skin.
The Wiltshire countryside boasted rolling green hills, dotted with trees. Hazel had never been so happy to see trees and hills in her life.
. And not just on grown-ups, he experimented on
John whimpered as he felt Sherlock’s fingers pull back, and then thrust in again, sending an electric shock of stimulation through his whole body. Fluid spurted from his dick in response, hard and completely untouched.
“Well, it can’t be forever,” said Mike. “Once we graduate we won’t be able to keep people from messing with it.”
John, for all his supposed idiocy, was fairly certain that you really oughtn’t to shake people with concussions like this.
“Nobody bullies my friend,” John said, decisively.
John comes in his trousers, hot and easy, groaning against Sherlock’s mouth. Thinks about the other times he’s come in his pants, just like this, with Sherlock’s voice in his ear whispering obscenity or Sherlock’s mouth on his or Sherlock’s long fingers lightly tracing the crease of his thigh, shudders against the second wave of pleasure that ripples through him. He feels Sherlock keep rocking and then gasp and moan and go still. His chest feels filled with the light of the sun; he’s absorbed the warmth of the earth into him.
"He just needs to meet a nice girl, that's all, and he'll settle right down."
"Come off it, Adler," Sherlock says, taking out a cigarette and lighting it.
to clean the wound! And then put fresh Dittany on it.”
“Oh,” Mrs. Hudson says, the suspicion melting away. She wraps Victor up in a hug as well. “Why didn’t you say so? Any friend of Sherlock’s is a good boy.”
The Drifters crooning on the radio,
This one thing they both understood: Anywhere But Here.
He opened his mouth again, but nothing came out. He probably looked like an idiot, damn it all to hell.
John turned away from Sherlock, looking out into the night. Why wasn’t he home yet? The houses looked familiar, almost exactly like the ones in his neighborhood, but for some reason he couldn’t think of the name of the street.
“Oh,” said John. “I guess we should ask him or her if he or she wants to be a him or her.”
And so he ran.
“Please,” Kamanev gasped. “Mercy.”
“I don’t think Sherlock’s going to come after your skull,” John said.
A breach.  Something firmer, slender - fingers. At first just one, slippery with something, pushing into him, inside of him, entering him, opening a place that John didn’t think could open, he didn’t know you could enter.
The entire room reeked of cigarettes and alcohol. That immediately recognizable smell of stale whiskey, layered in with the damp, rotting odor of mildew. Mold experiments grew in petri dishes covering the desk - rich cherrywood with the corners all chipped.
It was only a movie, but the rising terror in John’s throat was real. Fear washed over him like black water, bubbles rising up to the surface; he imagined his own mouth open in a silent scream. His heart pounded-
“You,” John said, after a moment, the word pressed against the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, “are
He held out his hand.
Sherlock opened his mouth and shut it again. He hadn’t exactly predicted this and wasn’t quite sure how to respond.
April 1586 passed, and there was no sign of Grenville’s relief fleet. In 1587, Sir Walter Raleigh dispatched a  new group of 115 colonists to establish a colony in Chesapeake Bay. They were ordered to travel to Roanoke to check on the settlers, but when they arrived on July 22, 1587, they found nothing except a single human skeleton that may have been the remains of one of the original men.
It's hard to explain
” Bill insisted.
The cab reeked of mango-sherbert scent air deodoriser (Tropical Breeze, on the label), layered on top of the stale scent of cigarette smoke in attempt to cloak it. Sherlock closed his eyes and recalled the Rorschach-blot-pattern of blood and brain on the wall, thought about the surety of the gun in his hand, and he felt nothing.
as John, with
“I told you not to worry about expulsion,” Sherlock said impatiently. He pressed on the dressing a little harder than necessary for emphasis on each syllable of
“John,” Hazel said over breakfast one morning, after Mr. Watson had left for work. She kept her voice casual as she slathered raspberry jam on his toast. “Do you know what ‘sure lock’ means?”
“Well, then. Another transgression like this, and you’ll be suspended from Quidditch.”
“No top hats, Bill,” said John, decisively.
be messes.” She tosses his jacket onto the side of the sofa. “So, what were you up to?”
“Gryffindor, that’s you,” the boy clarified, opening his eyes to give John the onceover. His eyes were startlingly blue.
John laughed.
“I wasn’t going to,” said Sherlock. “But then I remembered something we could do.”  He tapped his fingertips, three times, against John’s closed fist.
“Right here,” Sherlock said, “is where I would cut them for you.”
Instead John had said, "I've never been kissed before," which Sherlock knew to be true, although he had seen the junior paper shakers' admiring glances at him during football practice. And then John had reached out, curled one hand in the lapel of Sherlock's leather and said, all in a rush, "Do that again," which Sherlock had not expected, but was well prepared for.
John stopped, stunned, as he often was, by the usage of the saccharine relationship term. Success. Sherlock took a picture.
The wind was the unexpected factor, carrying the fire, roaring down the canyon where the men had sat down to eat their dinner; all of them unaware and placid until it was far too late.
“Yeah, of course,” John says. He puts the phone face-down on the table.
“What are you doing here?” John asked.
He headed for the cave.
They had spread out the map on the table, looking at the tiny capillaries of blue and red and green and black, the beige shapes of states, the wide, light blue of ocean. John had never traveled farther than the neighboring farm until he was eleven, when Dad left. After that they traveled a lot - first to his aunt’s and then (when his mother got sick of fighting with his uncle) to his grandmother’s, staying in motels and sometimes sleeping in the car in the times in between. He and Harry had loved it; every day an adventure, every night a new bed, or the car parked in the unknown quiet of someplace new.
John had proven himself, again and again, to be wonderful at that.
John’s cheeks pinkened slightly. “Go cut up a corpse or something, you're bothering me."
“No, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed. “Slug in the Common Room, no experiments in the dormitories. That’s final.”
and -
“He did
In the movie the violins came to a shrieking crescendo and then it occurred to John that someone was shrieking as well, it sounded like him, it was him.
“I’m not hungry anymore,” John replied, gathering up his books as well as a few pumpkin pasties. “And I need to study.”
- and awfuler things than that, even.
“Good,” said Sherlock, smiling with all his sharp little teeth showing. His tail slapped the water with a happy little splash, and when it swished it created waves around both of them.
“Vain bastard,” Victor corrects. “Held on to those wigs for months afterwards after I told him I thought he made a fetching blond. Used it again when we went to Dr. Rao’s Symposium and told everyone he was a visiting Professor by the name of Sylvester Hennypen.”
“They’re just really shit at summoning,” Bill reassured him.
“‘Course I do.”
Mercy.
“You should try it,” Sherlock suggested. “It might help you get to sleep at night.”
His smile wilts at the edges. “Well, I guess that’s one thing she doesn’t have to worry about any more…”
“It’s plastic bubble paper,” said John. “Don’t ask me what plastic is, I don’t know, only that it makes up loads of stuff, like trays and furniture and toothbrushes and probably even some people. But the bubble wrap is like this stuff you wrap stuff in so it doesn’t get damaged when you send it in the post. Because we don’t use owls. Or Muggles don’t use owls.”
John, feeling a tight squeeze in his chest, forgot how to breathe. He could feel the grey mesh of the screen underneath his fingers, and could not recall when he had reached out to touch it. He was captivated by Sherlock - made captive by his words, his voice, his gaze. He supposed had always been captivated by him, ever since the very start.
“This is Billy. Billy, John,” Sherlock introduced.
“Yeah!” Mike chimed in.
Sherlock played slowly, coaxingly, breathing in and out in time with John’s breaths until he could feel the fatigue pulling at his own limbs. Initially John watched him intently, but soon his eyes drifted closed, as if to listen more closely in private bliss. Sherlock let him pretend to listen, and every now and then John let out a soft “mm” in agreement to a question never asked.
Sherlock’s mouth on his was uncharacteristically soft - warm lips, gentle pressure. John’s heart clenched unexpectedly in his chest.  There was something longing about it. It wasn’t nearly long enough.  The kiss lingered on John’s lips for a while afterwards, like the last few drops of sweet wine upon the tongue. And John wondered, could this ever be enough?
John forced a grin. “Sorry, Harry.”
“No!” Well. Yes. But it wasn’t the way Sherlock made it sound. “I just…” John deflated a bit. It wasn’t that he had a problem dating a man; he wouldn’t give Sherlock up for anything. It was just...different. A kind of different that caught him at unexpected moments and pulled him out of the moment, made him notice and think when he wanted to be sinking down into the joy of being with Sherlock. “Sorry. I suppose I’m still adjusting to this ‘dating a bloke’ thing. It’s not
“Oh,” John said, and proceeded to be very bad at kissing indeed.
Sherlock stops in the middle of the field, a dark outline against the sky, black leather jacket and hair aglow with the orange light of the dying sun behind him.
John could barely even meet his eyes. When he looked, a moment later, he saw that the clerk’s eyes and hair were the same medium sort of brown.
John dropped his head back on the cushion and stared at the ceiling, unable to actually look Sherlock in the eyes with what he was about to say. “Sherlock, either stick another finger in or fuck me, because I’m losing my mind here, and I really can’t wait.”
Every compartment John looked in seemed full of people by now; either with older kids who knew each other or new first-years chatting amiably, making friends. Already twice John had had his life threatened, almost getting run over by a girl chasing a cat down the hall, shouting, “Toby, Toby, you get back here this instant!” as if it would make a difference. The second time he’d almost gotten squashed by a Hufflepuff boy’s runaway trunk as it barrelled down the hall, having somehow sprouted legs. There was an older Slytherin boy who smiled at him and offered to help him with his trunk, but Harry had always said Slytherins were cheaters and liars and just the worst, so John politely told him thank you but no thank you, he could manage. Besides, while that boy had seemed nice enough, the large, silent company he kept terrified John, and he was all too happy to be on his way.
Sherlock stared back defiantly, slug in his hands. Very slowly, he dragged the slug across his robes again.
On Sarah’s inoffensive blandness: “She’s like oatmeal,” Sherlock had decreed.
He follows Sherlock all the way down to the bottom.
Sherlock felt so real: the solidness of his chest, the strength of his arms. John thought there was no place in the world that he’d rather be. Sherlock’s arms tightened around him, natural and possessive. John was imbued with a sense of belonging: this was where he belonged, this was who he belonged to.
And so Sherlock told him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "And don't try to make a pun, they're never half as clever as you think." John typed. "No, that sounds stupid. And that doesn't even make sense.” He pointed. “You spelled it wrong."
“Look at you,” Sherlock purred. “Look at how desperate you are, fucking yourself on my cock.”
In the darkness of the night, in the privacy of his bed, the moments replayed themselves in full-on technicolor, vivid and bright.  The warmth of the square of sun that fell upon them, the dust motes that swirled lazily in the light. The hard surface of the desk against his thighs, while Sherlock cradled his face in both of his hands and kissed him. The press of Sherlock’s mouth against his. Feeling the strange, intimate wetness of another person’s mouth for the first time. Sherlock saying against his lips, “open your mouth a bit more,” his breath hot, so close, and John obliging, dizzy with newfound knowledge, burning up.
They were starting a turnip garden, her mother said.
John adds hastily, “Oh no, not like that. He’s an old friend of Sherlock’s. We had a lot to talk about.”
One time John found a dog in the bushes behind the Stamfords’ backyard.
Flash. One after another. Sherlock stalked closer, blithely ignoring John’s free arm waving in impotent rage. He was as bad as the paparazzi that hounded them on a regular basis. He was as bad as that Milton Lester, Kitty Riley’s personal photographer, who lay in wait for them in the alley beside Angelo’s and hid in the bins outside of Tesco’s.
Hogwarts had a library that was so grand that John thought he’d only be able to find the proper word to describe it if he looked it up in one of the books found there. Walls upon walls of books stretched, seemingly, to the heavens, all of it lit by both candlelight and the sunlight filtering through the intricate glass windows. At a certain time of day, depending upon the season, the sunlight struck the glass just right, so that it scattered little diamonds of rainbows all over one’s books and scrolls. In the summer this happened in late afternoon. In the winter the snow piled up in the corners of the windows, and the fires burned in their fireplaces, and the room held a certain rosy light that reflected the sky outside.
“Have you lost your mind?"
Sherlock’s words filled John with a sudden rush of feeling, like the night wind that rose to the window to greet him. His pulse quickened with excitement. He’d never dared give voice to his questions before, and to hear the words from someone else and not just in his own head made them more real, dangerous. He wanted to keep talking, Sherlock seemed like he was full of stories, maybe he’d even have answers. It would be so easy to open the window. An invitation. Down the tree branches, and then onto the street below. On that silent street Sherlock’s car would be waiting. He’d drive faster than anyone John ever knew, they’d could go faster than John had ever dreamed of, he’d
Deeper into the cave, it was quite dark, only getting darker and darker where the sunlight couldn’t reach. It made John feel like he was standing at the entrance of a long tunnel that went on forever. Or maybe it went deep, deep into the earth, into a world where no sunlight shone, and entire cities sprung up like clusters of mushrooms, flourishing by lamplight and fireflies and glow worms alone. There was no real way of knowing.
“You promised,” he reminds him.
“Thanks for fixing my bike,” John tried to recover. “I really owe you one,” and laughed a little, to show that all was cool (even when he was feeling decidedly uncool).
“Do you know what I want to do to you right now?” he asked, pitching his voice to a low, authoritative rumble.  “Right now, I want to pick you up out of that chair and kiss you breathless.  Then, I want to put you on your back, spread out across the table with me standing between your legs while I tug each article of clothing off you, one by one.
“Not even I could have guessed you would turn out to be such a little cockslut,” Sherlock said. He was wickedly amused and shamelessly aroused.  “Imagine what your girlfriends would say if they could see you like this. Letting yourself be used for my pleasure. Your tight little hole hungry for my cock. You’re positively greedy for my cock inside of you, all tied up and gagged and still begging me to fuck you until you come.”
John looked at him in disbelief. “Bill...not this again. We’ve been over this.”
To which Sherlock stares at him blankly.
“Open the window, John,” Sherlock coaxed. “I promise I won’t come in.”
John opened his eyes and he was standing in a forest. Trees all around him, so tall that they blocked out light. A voice whispered to him with great urgency,
Sherlock has turned away. He is spectacularly irritated at a world that allows him to run out of smokes. He flicks open his lighter and snaps the wheel with his thumb, running his other fingers through the flame. He can feel John’s eyes on him.
“I hear Bolivia is lovely this time of year,” Sherlock said.
“What, me, make friends with that nasty, bigoted bunch?” said Bill, shocked.
Sherlock had eyes like the pale blue fire that flared when you first lit a stove. He had eyes like frost on metal pipes in winter.  And when he looked at you, he really looked at you, straight through you, straight to the core of you, down to everything that you were and up to everything that you are. Sherlock made John feel like his outsides were glass and his insides were a museum. He made him feel like the plastic anatomy model in Bio lab. He made him feel on display.
“Sherlock!” John said, gasped it even, and then, because he was in shock: “You look
“I suppose it’s adequate enough,” Sherlock said. He was eying John’s mouth, and the indecent way John was currently running his tongue over his top lip. “May I one day, with any hope, recover fully from the retinal damage.”
John dreams of falling. He wakes up before he hits the ground.
Happy Valentine's Day!
- but then there was talk of guns, and trapping people in cars, of leaving the stove on to suffocate people in their sleep and people putting their heads in ovens and causing explosions. Sherlock, in turn, told him a particularly fantastic story about how a man had been found dead in his cottage ripped open, and everybody thought it had been his wife, only it had turned out to be his goat, and then the goat turned out to be his wife, and his wife had turned out to actually be a goat. In turn, John shared his theory about how if he had to dispose of a body, he would chop it up and put it in a blender and make a human slurry - and then he’d spent another fifteen minutes explaining blenders to an especially inquisitive Sherlock.
“You are a very confusing boy, John Watson,” Bill said. “You make me very emotionally conflicted. On one hand, I am very
“Like what?” Sherlock mumbled.
John was missing, too engrossed in debating the particulars of whether one was supposed to ground or pound the snake fangs, and what would happen if one accidentally (or intentionally) inhaled the dust.
“You don’t pray,” said John.
The fins on Sherlock’s ears reminded John a bit of butterfly wings, the way they were so pretty and delicate, and especially the way they flickered under his fingers. The action sprinkled John with droplets of water, making them both giggle as Sherlock shook his head.
, and she doesn't have nearly enough followers! If you enjoy this, please go follow her!
“Still,” said Sherlock, with just a hint of a smile. “I do believe that counts.”
The neurons in his nervous system light up with electrical impulses in the dark; each axon firing off the same message: pure need.
“Yep,” said Bill. “Nobody likes to talk about it, because the Holmes family is all rich and powerful, and they do important stuff, and I think their dad’s in the Ministry and
“You’ll put her hand on her waist, like this. Just relax and feel the sway of the music.”
“Well,” John considers, “I do like Thai.”
“A part of you that you can’t help or control. You don’t get that from your momma, now do you?”
And then his gaze turned to John. John could feel it sweep over him - the heavy caress of it over his skin, taking in his ruffled hair, his nice shirt, his casual slacks, and then up his body again, and the sweep of heat that followed. In his cheeks and in his chest and low in his stomach and in places even more intimate.
, and you want it so badly it goes straight down to your bones.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, and lifted one hand away to start unbuttoning his shirt. Yeah, all right, hesitation could sod off. John reached greedily for that creamy white skin and let Sherlock do whatever the hell he had in mind.
John closed the window firmly.
John right underneath him, clinging; this is the exact way he will look when he finally fucks him. The way his whole body shifts on the bed, the sound of the bed creaking quietly beneath them. John, his body trembling, his mouth hanging open, panting hot, humid breaths between them. His mouth. The inside of it red and wet, scrap of tongue peeking just slightly out. How it would feel, sweet lips wrapped tightly around Sherlock’s cock with his tongue pressing just right, rubbing against the glans and John hasn’t even learned any of this yet.
“Have a seat. Let me put the kettle on, and then I’ll tell you some things about what you don’t know.”
John snorted. “In what? Sex or photography?”
“So am I.”
The lights had all gone out.
The pads of John's fingers dig into his shoulder, into the back of his neck. John's blunt nails bite half-moon crescents into his flesh. Let him. Let John mark him with the smudges of his fingerprints, uniquely John, unlike any other set of prints in the world. He wants John to dirty him up with his prints, press them in all over while Sherlock claims him, pushes inside deep where no one has ever been before.
“Oh, God, I shouldn’t have had so much to drink,” John bemoaned as the cab lurched forward.
And John began to laugh, exhilarated, wild. Because, of course, it had been a game, all in good fun, the same way he and Harry used to chase each other through the trees when they were small.
Sherlock promised himself.
John was not alone.
John stared at him for a moment, then shrugged and got back to work as well. He had a lot of catching up to do.
“Would so,” John insisted.
” she called out into the night. The front door banged on its hinges behind her.
Normally John would have protested this with the fact that his mum constantly reassured him that he was still growing, but now he only sighed. “Are you going to ask about my Liz-Bean parents?”
Sherlock found his hips thrusting, himself moaning, panting with excitement. He let out a low, soft grunt, surprised - John was dangerously good at sucking. If he wasn’t careful he’d come down his throat in no time at all, and with a deep shudder and a low moan, he pushed John off.
John makes Sherlock stand next to the twine ball for a picture. Sherlock makes a face like one would expect Sherlock Holmes to make when standing next to an enormous ball of twine.
Saturday night. John lay in bed, eyes squeezed shut, muscles tense and trembling. Like every part of him was a glass bottle with a bluebottle fly trapped inside, buzzing, buzzing about.
, but that is what people under evil enchantments
Carl noticed this as well. “What are you going to do now? Curse me? Dare you. I dare you to do it,” he taunted. “Why don’t you go ahead and show everyone your true evil self?”
John lands on his bottom with a thud, calls Sherlock a jerk, rolls them over in the same breath; Sherlock is laughing, not caring about the dirt on his precious jacket, rubbing onto the seat of his jeans. His hands are on John, palms open and fingers squeezing, rubbing hot on his shoulders, his spine, the small of his back, burning through the thin fabric of John’s plaid shirt.
“Anyway,” said Molly, “I always keep Toby in at night. “
And then emptiness. John gasped with loss, the feeling of fingers slipping out.  Sherlock’s hands turning him over onto his stomach. Those same hands running down his back, gripping him possessively. Fingers painting slick trails down his skin, burn of shame at knowing what that slickness was. Sherlock’s hands upon his buttocks, the pressure of his thumbs, kneading him, then spreading him open. The night air cool on the wetness of that open, vulnerable place, his...his hole. John whimpered, buried his face into the pillow out of embarrassment at being so exposed.  Deep inside of him, an ache, an itch he didn’t understand.
