“They are appreciated. Make yourself at home.” She looked at Jack again. “Charlie is going to start some games with the kids if you want to join.”
“I could care less as long as I am not the one consuming it,” he joked, following her with the leftovers in the kitchen. “Are the kids upstairs?”
Castiel looked up to see Meg in the doorway. The two of them are not as awkward anymore and Meg has obviously come to speak about work, indicated by the file folder in her hand. “Just a little horrified.” He held out his phone to show the picture of Jack.
“You made that assumption. I actually informed you of contrary facts,” Castiel teased. “But it is getting late, I told Anna I would be back before 10.”
“Luke had a way of getting into all sorts of trouble. While Jack is one of the best things that has happened to me, how it happened with Kelly was awful. He just stopped speaking with her after she told him she pregnant. To this day I have no idea why she was in the car with him that night.” Castiel reached for the mug again, trying to get any warmth from the mostly cooled hot chocolate.
“I shouldn’t have pushed you about going on a date. Besides I don’t think Donna could handle your sarcasm.” She handed him the bowl of ice cream. “I’m preaching to the choir anyway. I haven’t been on a date since Sean died and that was seven years ago.”
“And dinner. With the move you have no idea how hard cooking has been. I’m pretty sure even Jack is fed up with microwave meals and pizza.”
“You know I covered for Ellen at the Roadhouse last night. Everyone was asking me where Dean was. Unless you changed your hunting ground you haven’t even had a one-night stand—”
Summer was coming to a close rather quickly. For whatever reason, Dean’s business started to pick up and he had not spent that much time together. The two had not yet been able to spend the night at Dean’s place. Mainly because it was proving next to impossible to find someone to watch Jack overnight.
“And why is that?” Castiel received his client assignments already and as far as he knew there were no new clients that had come in.
“You’re the first person I’ve ever really had around Jack,” Castiel said as he began to walk around the kitchen getting him the supplies necessary for cooking: cutting board, bowl, knife. “The first person that I’ve been involved with.”
“I’m not trying to get you to feel sorry for me or something. I’m just saying that I get it Cas. Don’t try to explain to me or feel embarrassed or anything. From my point of view, you’re doing a hell of a better job than my father did.”
She spoke with him all through the night and Castiel just listened. This women who at one point he thought he loved, who he had gotten into fights with Luke over. She was his friend first after all, before she had even met Luke. Kelly could see past the charming smile and manipulative words that Luke spoke. This beautiful, kind women who saw the best in everyone. The woman that had so much hope.
Castiel saw a woman with short cropped hair wearing a police uniform holding out a tissue. “How can you tell?” He took it from her and dabbed at his eyes. There was little to wipe up but it was still a kind gesture.
His skin is all creamy porcelain, his figure long and lithe. He gets turned on when Alfie lets his work pants fall to the ground revealing a pair of blue boxer briefs that hug his ass so well. “Don’t get too excited, dinner and cookies first.”
“Don’t bury it in whipped cream, have roughly the same as the berries and the cake,” Dean said, but then he leaned in close. “The whipped cream is my favorite part too, but I bet your daddy made the shortcake really good.”
“It happens to the best of us.” He came up beside Dean as he gently nudged him out of the way. “Can you handle coffee?”
Castiel throat tightened. “Of course, they would be. I would never let anyone into my life that wasn’t nice to you.” He opened his arm and Jack gave him a hug. When they pulled away, he decided the topic wasn’t finished. “What would you think if daddy’s special friend was a boy?”
“It’s good your excited, but they will eat you alive. Don’t seem too over eager even if you’re excited.”
“Castiel.” He shook both of their hands in turn. “My son Jack is currently being occupied by Charlie or I would introduce him as well.” He paused only because Eileen came back with a beer for everyone. When she held one out to him, he shook his head. Jo said nothing, but quickly pulled it towards herself with a cheeky smile.
“I know, but your…” Sam gestured at him. “I just know my brother. I think the two of you would get along….” He rubbed the back of his neck as he met Castiel’s firm gaze. “I don’t want to tell you anything that he wouldn’t be comfortable with, but he could use a friend. And quite frankly Cas you need to socialize more with people that are over the age of ten.” Sam held a hand up when Castiel opened his mouth. “That aren’t your siblings or Jody. Besides all you talk about with Jody is your kids.”
Castiel watched as Dean climbed in his truck and drove away. He stood there for a few seconds before Jack called him over into the backyard, tearing him out of his thoughts.
Castiel did not say anything but narrowed his eyes and set the potatoes on the counter. “I will get the children to wash up. That will be the more difficult task compared to what needs to be finished.”
He couldn’t really tell Jack the truth yet. Castiel did the best of not hiding it, of keeping a photo with Luke and Kelly with the rest of the photos of his family. He tried to see if he could recognize his brother’s features in Jack, but he was all Kelly. He saw her in Jacks smile and his eyes and his hair.
“I can’t bear to part with it. My dad bought it to teach us how to drive and it made my mom so mad to have that piece of junk sitting in the driveway. It was passed down Luke to Michael to Gabriel and then me. Anna refused to drive it so it stayed with me.”
“Doubt that, but thanks for the ego boost.” Dean’s hand went to Castiel’s back, rubbing a small circle in center.
“I never came to the beach much when I was younger. My dad loved it, could spend hours just talking about nature. My mom and siblings and I thought it was just wet and cold.” Castiel let his body relax, leaning into Dean’s warm side. “It was one of the things I missed the most. I guess spending months in a desert can do that to you.” Castiel turned his body and his face was inches from Dean. He’d never been this close to him. He could see the light freckles dusted across his face and make out the different flecks of green in his eyes. “But I have a feeling we’re not just here for the view.”
He slid onto the bench across from the women as Sam greeted someone else that had come into the yard. Eileen greeted him warmly, but Jo just surveyed him as she drank a beer. “Where’d you meet Sam?”
“Yes, I believe I overestimated my abilities.” He gave him a warm smile, though, and a quick peck on the cheek. This earned a round of giggles from the three children. “I need to finish getting the children ready. Could you handle breakfast? I was going to make oatmeal.”
“I had a nice time tonight. However, I was wondering if you would like to do it again accept alone and perhaps not at my house.” Castiel rubbed the back of his neck and looked up from where he was staring at his feet to see Dean. The man’s face had a smirk across it as one armed leaned on his truck.
Castiel sighed as he looked down at his son. His carefully planned schedule had been thrown off kilter with Gabriel’s spontaneous trip. Anna was a doctoral student and had the most flexible schedule of all his family. Well, except for his father, but he had gone to a cabin while he finished edits on his latest novel.
“Huh, no offense Eileen but Sam’s work friends are usually dorks.” She elbowed the woman as she leaned forward. “What branch?”
“Dean Winchester?” she whispered with a smile on her face. When he whipped around to scowl at her she held her hands up in surrender. “I promise to stay out of it, but I approve.”
The two of them sat on a blanket not far from the shore as they ate the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that Jack insisted on making. By now they were silent as they ate. Castiel finished his and wiped off his hands. “I wanted to talk to you about something.”
The three children eat quickly, and as soon as every last crumb is consumed, they dart to the play structure. Castiel moves from his spot across from Dean to next to him so he can keep them in sight. “I really do appreciate you coming.”
“Thanks…” He watched as the men went back into the house. Dean was puzzled as he gets to work on the roof inspection. After poking around, he discovered the news that was good for his wallet, but not what Castiel will want to here. Someone like him will probably chew him out. This will be the last time he took one of his brother’s friends.
“Luke?” Castiel practically dropped the spoon mid bite. His limbs froze, but his heart beat faster. It took a bit to stave off the awful memory from floating to the surface. “What did Luke tell you?”
“I think I would like Dean to come,” Castiel replied quietly. This just earns him a side hug from Jody before the pair sit down enjoying a few peaceful minutes before the children realized that he had arrived.
It took several days of back-and-forth text messages before they agreed on a plan for their date. Saturday night worked the best as Dean never worked weekends. For Castiel he didn’t have to worry about work the next day and his siblings were typically available.  He knew that Jack was a little disappointed because he was going to stay with Anna. Though he thought he and his sister were most similar, to a child she must have been extremely boring. Currently she was finishing up her doctoral degree in some obscure subset of history while teaching undergraduate courses. Her apartment was lined with thick academic books and obscure fiction novels. She didn't have TV in the living room, and her board games were limited to a few trivia games and a chess set. Castiel always had to pack some sort of entertainment for Jack.
“I have a leak in my roof,” Castiel said as he dumped sugar into his coffee. “How does one even go about fixing that?”
Before Castiel got a chance to respond two other people walked up to the couple. A blonde, broad-shoulder man and small woman next to him. “Darling, I didn’t know you would be here.”
“No, they’re very polite. I was just sitting on the bench over there when I saw you two. I just want to compliment the two of you for spending time with your kids. I should tell my husband that he should go on a dad date with your friends.”
Castiel held his phone as Jack posed in front of the apartment door. The small child took a lot of coaxing to get a smile on his serious face, but Castiel couldn’t resist. It was his first day of preschool and he looked so precious in his uniform. He wore navy pants with a pale blue button down underneath a red trimmed navy sweater.
Dean would be lying if he said that he was disappointed the next time he showed up at Castiel’s house to work on the roof he was gone. He supposed that meant he kept regular hours because he would show up at nine and the shiny Prius would be gone. He supposed it would be for the best. It wasn’t like he could hide anything from Benny, and Garth was surprisingly perceptive.
“And protective and loyal and caring…” Castiel said. “You know the only reason she got into that fight was because of Jack.” As he watched the child play it was clear that he had not inherited any of the traits of Luke. Luke had a quick temper, and an even quicker tongue. Jack was quiet and gentle, sometime misinterpreted as being shy.
When he first meets with clients, they typically speak about goals. He gets to know if they have specific goals or rather just things they need help working on. Fergus is a bit different. He found a job that he seems to be particularly good at, a salesman of some sort. Castiel frequently works with veterans that have just come home, ones that have trouble adjusting. By the end of the session, Castiel nearly had a headache just from listening to him speak and sheer volume of information that he had given him.
“Luke and his girlfriend were involved in a car accident. It was just over five years ago.” Castiel stared straight ahead, his blue eyes seeming dark as the scanned the night sky. “Luke was pronounced dead at the scene. Kelly was taken to the hospital. I was close to her; I’d met her my freshman year of college. I stayed with her the whole night and…and I thought she would be alright.”
“So, what are your plans? You were surprisingly vague,” Anna said as Castiel stepped inside. “Is it a date?”
He was envious that he can fall asleep for bed that easily. His routine is slow and calculated: he tidied up the house—specifically his bedroom and the downstairs; then he took a long shower; brushed his teeth; steeped a cup of chamomile tea thick with honey; and selected a biography off of his bookshelf. The book was his company in the low light of his bedroom as he drained the cup of tea. He tucked the book into his nightstand drawer before he washed out the honey residue in his cup, then filled it with water.
“I’m so sorry,” he muttered, wanting nothing more than to hold him close. Suddenly Castiel feels so very cold even with the fire burning hot. “Luke can you give us some fucking privacy?”
“I want to leave well enough alone, but when I looked at those pictures, I couldn’t help but wonder where Jack’s mom was.”
“Thank you, we should hurry along.” Castiel rushed after them until he caught up with Jack. He let himself be distracted by their wonderment at the large creatures. Claire was particularly enamored by the lions. Jody’s nickname for her was her little lion cub. Partially because of her wild curls, and partially because of her feisty personality. They had walked through most of the outdoor exhibits when they got hungry. They found a picnic table near some large plastic animals the kids could climb on. “You three are in for a treat, I make the
“I’m so sorry,” he muttered to Alfie whose sweet face is distorted into something of horror. “What are you even doing here?” he asked, turning to face his brother.
“Understandable, I can’t wait to have a little one myself.” Andrea smiled brightly even though Jo snorted at that.
Come Friday, Castiel left work late. Partly because Jack is with Gabriel for the night and he had no motivation to get off early; and partly because it is his first with his new client. Fergus Crowley. An army veteran that spoke with a slight accent that he said came from his Scottish mother.
“Well I never say no to a home cooked meal. I was going to grab takeout and your food is probably better.”
“That was my plan.” He finished the task at hand as Jody scooped their ice cream into bowls. “I apologize if I’m not very personable tonight.”
Castiel begged again while Luke just sauntered around the apartment. He took a seat at the table with his feet propped up as he lit up a cigarette as if it’s a live performance he’s watching. Alfie doesn’t stop once he comes out of the bathroom dressed in his own clothing. When Castiel goes to kiss him goodbye, Alfie just reached over and gave his arm a squeeze. He just said that he would see him around, and not to worry, his sister had an apartment in town he could crash at.
. Gabriel’s busy and I can’t leave Jack with Michael…” Currently Castiel was trying to put a diaper on a squirming Jack while the phone was between his ear and neck.
“Now that school’s out for summer I’ve been crashing here when, I get off a few days from work,” Jo responded with a wide grin.
“So, is it just you?” Andrea asked. Her smile was genuine and curiosity polite. It still made him stiffen a bit. Eileen gave him a sympathetic look, mainly because he’d had the conversation with her before.
“I’ve never seen you this angry, must have pushed a few buttons. But still I wouldn’t threaten me.” He had a smirk on his face. “You wouldn’t want me to let slip what I found out tonight.”
He didn't respond. Instead, he flipped his phone over and attempted to concentrate on the monthly goals that are being laid out for them. He didn't look at his phone until after lunch when he received a text from his brother.
“Daddy?” Jack asked. He’s dressed himself in a striped shirt and shorts that have little lobsters embroidered all over them. He looks horrendous, but he doesn’t have time to care.
The two walked to the backyard like instructed and he was surprised at how much room there and just how many people fit into the backyard. He blinked a few times before he saw Sam talking to an older woman. “Cas!” he saw him wave with a goofy grin on his face. “Castiel, Jack, this is Ellen. She’s practically my second mom.”
“It’s perfectly alright for tonight Jack. Now, Dean wants to make us dinner. Why don’t you go play until it’s ready?”
“Of course, smart ass, who boils milk this early anyway?” The words are quiet as he sneaked past him to go to the coffee machine.
“No, when we go grocery shopping, we can stop by the hardware store to get some paint samples. You can help me choose.”
“No. I can finish.” The words came out with great effort. “The hospital called the local law school clinic to send someone to draft a will. She said if anything happened that I was to raise Jack.” He laughed. It was full of bitterness, an odd sound that he forced out. “Because for some reason she looked at me and thought I would be a good father.” Castiel looked out distantly. “At that point I was three months stateside struggling to become a civilian again. Drinking heavily, begrudgingly going to therapy, working a dead-end job in grocery store.”
“Alone from me?” Jack frowned as went to sit down Castiel’s bed. It was humorous as he sat at the edge, his feet dangling due to the height.
“Yes,” Jack said. Castiel was sure he saw an eye roll and he knew that was a habit that he picked up from Claire.
“In a way, I’m his paternal uncle.  His father was Luke, if you recall I told you that he had passed.”
“With all the staff changes I’m going to have to have to work Saturday. School is in session next week, and with everything going I don’ know when I’ll be able to take them.”
Sunday night is typically family dinner. Typically, he shows up to Bobby and Ellen’s around 4. He’s a little late since he swung by Castiel’s and it took longer than he thought. When he pulls his car into the driveway, he smiles seeing Jo’s truck. In a split-second decision, he grabbed the pie Castiel made him. Partially because if he took it home, he wouldn’t have the self-control to not eat the entire thing for breakfast.
“I assume that you have trouble with the word ‘convey’ it means to let someone know something, to communicate. Displease is to make unhappy.” Castiel picked up his fork and knife to eat his chicken. He looked around the table as Claire and Alex had bored looks across their face, Jody was trying to hold back a laugh. “It seems my conversational skills are not appreciated once more.”
The man took Jack from him easily. He even smiled when he went to grab a fistful of his long hair that brushed against the collar of his shirt. “Sam Winchester.”
“If something happens, I want you to take care of him. You would be such a good father Castiel.” She squeezed his hand tightly. “I know it’s a lot to ask, but you were always there for me. Even when you were overseas you still kept in contact. Still listened to me complain about my job and Luke.” She set the phone down and reached for his hand to squeeze. “The only other option is my parents. Maybe they’ll want to meet Jack someday, but Cas…I trust you.” Tears flowed down her cheeks. “Besides if he lived with my parents, he wouldn’t have your dad or Gabriel or Anna looking out for him.”
“There are baby books you can read, we all will be happy to help you, we all know you can afford a better place. I’m not touching the therapy because we all know you need it.”
“Not exactly being the single father to an infant took up most of my time. I did have a brief involvement with one of the woman I work with.” Castiel reached for the lettuce to begin washing it. Talking about Meg was never something he liked to do. “She knew about Jack, but wasn’t interested in being around him.”
Castiel sighed. At that point a kitchen timer when off and he grabbed an oven mitt to pull out a tray of cookies. “My brother Michael warned me that I would probably need a roof when I bought the house…” He picked up a spatula and began to move them onto a cooling rack. “If you’re Sam’s brother I trust you. I was hoping that it could be completed this weekend, but I understand.”
Once in bed, the sheets felt cool against his skin despite the fact the temperature has not yet dropped tonight. His bed was large, the only person that has ever been in it was Jack during a particularly nasty storm that cut out the power. Sleep did not come so he is left with his thoughts. He thought of Meg. Witty and bold and affectionate. His only real relationship since he came home, since Jack was born. Even with her sex was at her place and he never stayed the night.
Jack’s face lit up as he asked all sorts of questions. Everything else seemed to fade away as Castiel talked to him. For the both of them words didn’t necessarily come easy. Honestly Jack’s preschool teacher was worried until he got closer to Claire and became more emboldened. He was so slow to trust, but once he did, he seemed to blossom. Perhaps Castiel was the same way. He just knew that there was nothing he had to worry about with Jack.
“One of juniors that lives on my floor owed me. I didn’t know if you drank, but I thought it would be fun together.”
“Why would I do a thing like that?” Castiel shook his head and then gestured for him to follow him in.
“Live action role play. It’s like acting out the Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. She made Sam and I play once, but you’d have to ask her any questions.” Dean continued to shovel the pasta in his mouth. “This is good. I don’t even like eating vegetables usually.” He paused and turned to Jack. “Forget I said that. Vegetables are great. They’re so good, it’s all rabbits eat.”
After Jack is tucked into bed for the night, Castiel responded to Dean’s text message. He ignores the excitement he felt when Dean immediately responded:
“Well sometimes grown-ups don’t think before they say something. But don’t you worry, I’m going to patch this up to make it safe. In a few days it will be good as new.” Dean gave her a wink as he pulled out safety glasses and gloves. “One time I was messing around with my brother and we dented our dad’s car. I’ve never seen him angrier.” He chuckled at the memory.
“It doesn’t have to be a date, but friends…” He gestured in the air for a bit. “Hanging out? You know I don’t drink, but being at a bar doesn’t bother me. We could watch sports or—”
“I keep the towels in the closet next to the spare room,” he said. “And I will not be ashamed for entertaining my son.” The smirk on his face seemed to indicate that he was not angry as placed a warm hand on Dean’s back and followed him closely down the stairs. “They are just to the left, the narrow door.”
Castiel couldn’t be mad at the statement. He pulled the snickerdoodle out of the bag and gave it to Jack. The group was thankfully fairly light in tone. There was a lot of talk of job interviews and relationship trouble. When it came to Castiel he smiled and not only because Jack was quietly entertained by his picture book.
As a law student (at least at my school) often times you can join a clinic where you provide free legal help under supervision of a professor. One of those clinics is wills and trusts. Our law school is like five blocks from a hospital so sometimes the clinic does receive phone calls from the hospital wanting to help people with wills.
The night was still young, dusk hadn’t even settled yet. Castiel suspected that Dean wanted him to go for a ride to show off his car, his Baby as he had called it. It was a sleek Black Impala that had clearly been restored with a lot of love. “Now this is a car, not that sorry excuse that you drive.”
“I won’t hold it against you. My dad was a marine, Sam’s dad was too. It’s how we know each other.” She took a drink of her beer as she leaned back and studied him. “I guess I should have had you pegged as an army guy. All serious and stuff.”
“I have good news. I have started the training for peer support specialist. That means before Jack starts preschool I can hopefully quit working at the super market.” They asked him some questions, but the mood turned congratulatory.
“I believe in being an active parent. I’ve already signed up for room parent next week and am looking forward to the upcoming PTA meetings.”
Castiel walked into the group meeting where only a handful of people had arrived. He hated bringing Jack to these but it was more a support group than therapy. No one was bothered by it, but sometimes he worried about the things that Jack would overhear. All of these men had served in combat roles, had seen the worsts that war had to offer. Most everything now was about adjusting to this life.
“You know how it is. I spend all day here and then I go home to the girls.” She looked him over and then lit up. “The girls have been wanting to do something before school starts. Camping would be my go-to, but you know Alex…” She pulled out her phone and slid it over. “Do you want to come to the zoo with us? We’d have to drive to Seattle so I could use some adult company and Jack would love it.”
“Why don’t you get dressed and we can drive you?” The officer in front of the TV looked at the whiskey on the table. Castiel didn’t argue that he was sober. Instead he went to his bedroom and mechanically reached for a clean t-shirt, button down, and a pair of jeans. He grabbed sneakers that still felt rather strange to him compared to the combat boots he’d gotten used to.
“I will accept your apology for the accident, but you need to know that you’re not responsible for how I reacted. I’m sorry if I scared you.” The girls seemed to relax a bit. “Do you want me to call your mom?”
“The doctors don’t know if I’ll make it, Cas. Right now, Jack is safe, but they said that as soon as I’m stable, they want to perform a c-section. I wanted to make a video for you to show him.”
“Cas you said that…” Alfie looked miserable as he tried to hide his body while slipping back on the pajama pants.
Note: There are mentions of homophobia in this chapter, I will put details in the note below if you would like to skip but it does contain spoilers.
“I know…” Jody has a smirk on her face as she leaned against the counter, and taking a drink of her beer. “So…”
“I can appreciate the male specimen!” he objected. “And that’s all that happened, he came to fix your roof and then he slipped you his number?”
It took a little less than an hour before Dean showed up, toolbox in hand. He briefly wondered what he'd been doing on his day off with some black smudges on his jeans and arms, but what looked to be a clean work shirt. He would have smiled if he had the presence of mind to realize Dean had cleaned up to come over. “Did you really break a window to see me again?”
“We had dinner a week or two ago. She told me that like over a month ago she watched Jack on a Friday night. You came to the door with your hair combed and wearing your nice khakis and had on cologne, but all you said is that you were hanging with a work friend.”
Castiel almost interrupted, but when he turned around with a bowl of whisked eggs, he saw Dean cross the kitchen to ruffle his son’s hair and let out a deep, hearty laugh. The man then side tracked him by asking him to help set the table.
“You have Sam. I have Jody and three nosy siblings. Well two nosy siblings and one that’s indifferent that can’t stand the idea of me raising Jack without a mother.” Castiel looked down realizing the words that came out of his mouth. If it bothered Dean, he wouldn’t know. They take a few minutes to eat in silence, other than Castiel commenting on the food.
“A skill you pick up on an Army base,” he said. “I became quite good even if my men said that they let me win.”
“It’s good for them.” Jody then turned the conversation to the kids, doing a much better job at coaxing them to talk. She was good even with Jack. Soon the room was filled with stories from school. Castiel did his best to listen, but he only caught bits and pieces as he planned what needed to be done with his house.
Castiel didn’t make him finish. Instead, he grabbed a paper towel and handed Dean two of the cookies. He promised he would pay him for the time he spent today evaluating the roof. Dean told him he would call him with an estimate and a time frame. Even if he wanted to call Castiel for entirely unprofessional reasons.
After they wrapped up the game, they sat around the living room just talking. Well Charlie did most of the talking. Gilda kept Ash from going to sleep on the kitchen table (no one else seemed to think that was strange). When Charlie proposed turning on a movie, Castiel glanced down at his watch. “I have to get to my brother’s place.” He looked at Dean who at this point was nursing a glass of whiskey while sitting on the couch, offering no input on Gilda’s movie selection. He walked over, placing a hand on his arm. “Want a ride home?”
“Rough morning?” It’s Sam. The young attorney who comes to the resource center and spends the whole day there the second Thursday of every month. He has been since the day that Castiel had met him.
“Oh…” Her mouth fell into a frown, but she quickly fixed her smile as she greeted Jack and handed him a name tag in the shape of a car. Castiel felt his throat tighten as he knelt down to say goodbye.
As soon as Dean unpacked the groceries, Jack bolted in the house to study the man carefully. “Burgers?”
So, they do. They pick an attractive sage green that compliments the cedar shingles well, and Castiel calls Dean. The man seems surprised that he called him again, but agrees to do it. Again, the price is deceptively low. He starts work on a Monday and unfortunately, he misses him that day and the next few days. The final day he’s working he arranges his schedule so he can pick up Jack and get there when Dean is still there.
The year prior he had lived in the dorms, but his mother promised to pay for a nice off campus apartment if he agreed to live with Luke who attended law school at the same university. The two had not gotten along as children and it was even worse as adults. Luke had strings of women that he brought home even though he claimed to be dating Kelly. Not only that but his study habits were lazy, and a few times Castiel had caught him in the act of what had to be cheating. “Did he tell you what this dirt was?”
He furrowed his eyebrows and looks her over. “Just because I am a father doesn’t mean I give off ‘dad vibes’.”
“You know that I’ll be fine,” Castiel finally said, crossing the distance between the two of them. Putting a hand on her arm.
“I know that Claire and Alex will be there, but Sam didn’t say anything about other children,” Castiel told his son as he packed up the car. He noticed his son eyeing the two pies he put on the seat beside him. “You need to eat lunch before any pie, okay?”
Castiel hadn’t realized he had driven on almost auto-pilot to the Y. He got out and gave his son a hug. “I finished early; I hope you’re not too disappointed not to see your Uncle Gabe.”
“You didn’t need to do that,” Castiel said, frowning at Dean before shifting his body to watch the children as they appeared to be playing a game of tag.
“It would.” Castiel smiled, his clothes swallowed Alfie. He’s not a large man—and their height is only off by a couple inches—but the other man’s figure is so petite he almost looks more like a child with the pants puddling around his feet and sleeves covering his hand.
There was a lot more to the story. Castiel could tell from the evasiveness of his gaze and the body language that show discomfort. “Did you ever go to college?”
“Perhaps it’s for the best.” Castiel said goodbye and sighed as he hung up. Jack had given up on getting his attention and was doing his best to skip stones. He quickly typed a text to Dean before running to join Jack.
Castiel got out of the car and led Jack by the hand. As he neared the front door, the emotions he felt were strange. How weird it felt to leave Jack with perfect strangers. Everyone had told him the child would benefit from starting preschool so soon, but Castiel had never left him with anyone that wasn’t family. Thankfully he was not the only teary-eyed guardian there as it was only kindergarten and preschool coming today.
Castiel looked to Jody for help. Thankfully she got a hint. “Sometimes it can be hard. You know how I don’t always like to talk about my day at work?”
“You’re adorable.” Charlie wrapped him in a hug after he got through a door, carefully avoiding what he carried. “Cookies are always welcome in my house. I’m glad you didn’t listen to Dean, total lack of manners sometime.”
“Thank you, but…” Dean will never turn down a pie, especially not one that looks like this. There’s a lattice work of crust and it’s sprinkled with sugar, pieces of cinnamon apple peek out.
“Arrow to the heart.” He clutched his chest as he dramatically collapsed in the chair. “Can’t two brothers spend some quality time together? I brought you lunch, real food. No peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.”
seemed to be the unsaid words Gabriel said. His brother gave him a comforting smile, Castiel knew when they got up, he would sweep him up into one of his warm, bone-crushing hug. “Tell me about this guy.”
“After you told me the roof needed replaced, I asked my brother for some advice—he works in real estate. He told me an approximate cost for how much the contractor he works with charges his clients and yours was significantly less. It seemed as if giving you a tip for the difference may be an insult since you were so kind, so I made a pie.”
Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose. The food in front of him smelled delightful, but Gabriel was triggering a headache that would cause nausea soon enough. “Fine, but you better keep this to yourself, is that clear? I better not hear of you disclosing information to Dad or Anna.”
“Kids thrive on that stuff.” Jody led him into the kitchen as she poured out a glass of iced tea for him, taking a beer for herself. “Besides I should thank you. I swear Jack is the only kid that’s not terrified of Claire.”
After he grabs some glasses with ice, they sit next to each other on the couch. It’s the start to what should be the perfect evening as they laugh and drink probably a bit too much of the cheap whiskey. The food is devoured, and much appreciated. Alfie gets a steep discount so they are stuffed full of fries and burgers and other various heart disease inducing sides. “I think you promised me cookies.”
“Oh…” Castiel let out a hearty sigh before he took a sip. “It’s normal to wonder. She was up there. The woman with short brown hair.”
A few minutes later the pair sat with their legs dangling off the edge of the small porch. They were close with a soft, loosely knitted blanket over their legs. “Jack may be an early riser, but he’s probably sound asleep right now so you can speak freely.” Castiel blew on the hot chocolate, steam rose from his honeybee mug.
Castiel had to bite back a laugh as he gave his sister a hug goodbye. He and Dean had agreed upon Benny’s food cart because to Dean it was a crime to not have tried his cooking. Anna lived surprisingly close so he waited in his car for some time. Honestly, he couldn’t have been more nervous for a first date. Never mind that this had been the first one in literal years, and it was the first
“Dean.” He held out a hand for the kid to shake. Even though he was much smaller, Dean could tell he was trying to shake it firmly.
“Yeah. Good call on the paint, but being this close to the water will probably beat it up again.” Dean walked around to the back of his truck and secured things like the ladder and his tool box before slamming the tail gate shut. He stared at Castiel for a few moments and Castiel realized he was just staring at him.
There were a few food carts in an empty lot. They were surrounded in a semi-circle around tables, some covered, some in the open. In the center was a fire pit. “This is nice.”
“He’s one of Sammy’s friends.” Dean set a pizza down on the table. “Now I do believe that someone promised me poker.”
Castiel didn’t know when the contractions started, but he saw the fear in the doctor’s eyes as they decided it would be best to deliver naturally if the baby was coming. He stayed by her side in the delivery room. It was there he witnessed what had to be a true act of God as Kelly held her newborn son to her chest. She cried tears of joy and told him how much she loved him. Castiel pressed a kiss to her forehead. For a brief second, he thought that Kelly was wrong, that she would live. The miracle, though, was the few moments she had with her son before he saw her eyes flutter shut. There was beeping and commotion all around him as one nurse took the baby and another took him out of the room.
“Why don’t we let Dean work? You three continue watching the movie and I’ll see about dinner. We can eat outside tonight.” He watched as they reluctantly went away. Dean had started getting to work at patching it up. “I apologize for that you didn’t—”
“The kids have all met him before, and I trust Dean. I’ve known him for a long time.” Jody shrugged. “It’s up to you. I know part of me is just being a mother hen.”
Jody seemed to drop the subject as he rounded up the three of them and stewarded them towards the bathroom to scrub away the layer of dirt on their hands. By the time he convinced Claire, Alex had set the table and Jody laid out the food.
Dean found himself standing in the butter yellow kitchen watching as the man poured him a glass of water from a frosty pitcher.
Castiel sighed and rubbed his temples. He remembered the text from earlier today. “Yes, you have made it perfectly clear I need to work on my humor.” Castiel ran a hand though his hair.
“Daddy says that cheese is only a few chemicals away from plastic.” He pointed at the blue and yellow package of American cheese. “Bacon
A few hours later, the kids are darting around the park zoo Castiel and Dean call out to them stay within sight. Well, Dean ends up being the one to call out. He’s much louder and for whatever reason Claire seems to pay more mind to it than Castiel’s voice. He suspects it’s because Dean is naturally louder so it doesn’t come off as angry.
“You can. I don’t think my cholesterol levels could handle it.” Castiel took the final bite on his plate, then met Dean’s eyes. “However, one time one hurt me.” He got to his feet and looked at the table. “If you are done, I will take your plates.”
“It’s a mythical creature, said to be extremely large. Think of a grizzly bear walking on two feet. It is otherwise referred to as bigfoot,” Castiel explained.
“He’s met Jack?” Gabriel’s eyes widened when a nod was given, he let out a low whistle. “Well, I’m glad for you little bro. You always put Jack first. I’m glad that you finally started dating someone.”
“I will keep that in mind.” Castiel moved to pin the card on a bulletin board. A few moments passed before he turned around again. “I may need my house painted soon. Would that be something you could do?”
It was then he heard: “Mr. Novak I’m sorry!”  and “It was my fault!” and “Daddy.” Like a reflex he shouted: “Get down! Away from the window!” That was before his eyes landed on Jack. Suddenly he realized where he was and tried to regulate his breathing. After a few stable breaths, he then repeated quietly for himself: “I feel stressed because I am remembering when Balthazar was injured. But that is not what is happening. I am home. I am not in danger.”
“I get it. Wrong place for the convo. I’ll grab his bag. You grab your son. He’s getting heavy, would totally throw out my back…”
Dean pulled away quickly, turning around to lean against the counter. A smile crossed Castiel’s face as he turned around. “Fifteen more minutes and then we’ll have food.” He looked to the egg carton he pulled out and began to crack it into a bowl.
“Pro bono legal services.” A wide grin crossed his face as he dug in his pocket to dig out his card.
It was Anna who found him sitting on the floor in the hallway of the hospital. His knees were pressed to his chest with his arms wrapped around him. “The doctors were looking for you,” she whispered. Somehow, she pried his arms loose and got him off the ground as she led him to the nursery. “Jack is healthy even if he is a few weeks early.”
There wasn’t any time to think, before they knew what hit them Luke strutted through the door. “Baby Cassie, I’m hooo
“Fuck,” he whispered. He doesn’t often curse but he’s already running behind and he has to drop Jack off at the summer day camp which is at the YMCA across town from the resource center.
“Jody, my siblings are already trying to locate the perfect spouse. It’s been their mission ever since Gabriel started dating Kali.”
“You didn’t know,” Cas said simply as he held his arms out to take the child back. “What are you doing as a volunteer?”
“Oh, no, I’m actually volunteering…” He leaned his head back, likely trying to get Jack to let go. “Does he do this with his mother?” Sam asked as he innocently laughed.
“Of course, the only hurdle will be coordinating our schedules.” He looked down at his watch. “I should really be going if I want to be on time.” After getting up he waited to give Jody a hug before heading out.
They finished in three days’ time, and Castiel was there for none of it. He started to think that the check would just be mailed for him. Instead, he is surprised to receive a text message from Castiel asking him if he would come over to pick up the check on Sunday. Since he wasn’t working, he took his Impala and drives to the quaint little lake house.
“I thank you for the offer, but I am more than capable of the minor repairs that are required.” He grabbed a fork to poke potatoes that were boiling. They were soft, so he grabbed them to dump out the water. Jody no longer told him he was a guest. The two had grown close rather quickly and had dinner together at least once a week. Unlike what the other parents at school thought—he and Jody were often the topic of rumors as the only single parents in the class—it was nice to have someone to lean on. Someone that knew what you were going through.
“No, he does not.” Cas reached for a cookie and wrapped it in a napkin before placing it in the front pocket of his backpack. “His mother is dead.”
This was enough of a head start as he added the onions and the ham to the pan. By the time he added the eggs, Dean and Jack were getting out bread for toast. It was so much easier with just a bit more help. By the time he sat down Dean was making Jack bubble with laughter. Castiel looked between the two of them and was hit with a stunning realization. He was falling in love with Dean Winchester.
The one who took in two little girls with no families. The one who let Castiel and Jack into her heart with no questions asked. But he also knew that when his PTSD got bad, she worried too much, even long after the episode had passed.
The person who she was before her husband and young son were ripped away from her so tragically. He just knew the Jody
“One more…” Castiel ran forward and knelt down beside him as he took a selfie. While he found them distasteful on most occasions, being a single parent sometimes called for it.
“I already paid Benny for everything. Do you want to go out to a lookout in my car? If you still have time.”
“On paper I was good enough for the court. But I lived with my parents for six months, I had no clue how to care for a newborn. I don’t think I would have survived without them or my siblings.” He shrugged. “They helped me get a two-bedroom apartment here, and then about a year ago my parents insisted that I started putting down roots.”
graphic or he would have to deal with the repurcussions which would most likely be an extra chapter in the book and Jack wanting him to stay until he fell asleep.
“Are you doing alright? The two of us haven’t gotten a chance to talk. After what happened when the girls spent the night, I thought you’d be upset.” She took a bite of the sandwich, looking him over. To anyone else it would seem innocent, but Jody was good at picking up any minimal body language. “I would be pissed if Jack broke my window. I am paying for it.”
Castiel ate with vigor. It was grocery shopping day so he and Jack had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch. He then thinks at how much Jack would love this, knowing at best he would be having frozen cheese pizza. Anna was vegetarian—which his son would typically have no problem with—but that combined with the fact that microwave popcorn was advanced cooking for her left little option.
Dean instead got out of his work truck and walks to the door where he knocks. He waited a few moments but he heard a lot of voices from inside. When the door swung open, he saw about the handsomest man he’s laid his eyes on in a while. He’s about his age with dark hair standing on end and bright blue eyes. For a Saturday at home, he’s dressed in khaki’s and blue button down. Definitely one of Sam’s lawyer friends.
“He said he walked in on you with another man.” Gabriel shook his head. “I told him to fuck off, but he seemed giddy that he could turn you in to your ROTC leader.”
“Blue shirt,” Castiel said as he saw his son across the yard catch a ball thrown by Charlie. “Charlie certainly has a way with them. He’s never like that unless his friend, Claire is around.” He shook his head a bit to tear his attention away and focus on the adult conversation. “Sorry, just caught in my thoughts.”
Laughter made him stop studying the photos. He walked away and went to what must be Jack’s room. Inside Castiel had changed into sleep pants and a t-shirt—the most casual he had ever seen him. He had pulled a chair close to the bed where Jack was tucked in. He couldn’t tell what he was reading, but he listened as his voice changed for each character along with flowing hand moments. Not wanting to interrupt the moment he leaned against the doorframe, allowing himself to listen. After what had to be at least a good twenty minutes Cas gave him a kiss on the forehead and smoothed out Jack’s damp hair.
A loud knock caught him in the middle of creating a fire. Castiel wiped his hands on his pants before going to the door. “You look nearly drowned,” he said. Washington hardly every snowed where they were, but it made up from it with the rain. Outside it must have been pouring, Alfie was soaked to the bone, cheeks and nose all pink.
Castiel ignored him and continued: “He also painted my house, and was nice enough to work on the weekend when Claire and Alex broke my window.” He shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know what you want to know. He is a kind man that is very understanding, and has a good sense of humor. He is not bothered by Jack. In fact, when you cancelled, he volunteered to come over and cook us dinner.”
Castiel is practically exhausted by the time the car is loaded up and the children are strapped into their seats into the Prius. He supposed Jody was right, having another adult on his side would be a good thing.
He smiled that response. Surprisingly Gabriel was the best at grounding him if anything ever happened. The two of them were the closest out of any of his siblings. He was so familiar and distinctly home in his mind that he was able to bring him back from even the worst episodes.  As he scrubbed up the sauce and saw that though the knife and cutting board fell in, it was fine. He looked to the side of the cabinet and saw Dean’s card. After the glass was cleaned up, he reached for his phone, and clicked on Dean's name.
“Hello!” The person who greeted him at the door was a young woman wearing a conservative floral print dress, a cross pendant hanging from her neck. “And you are?”
“Considering we have our clothes on, that’s probably a no,” Jo teased, punching his shoulder as he sat down beside her. “And where were you? I wanted to surprise you, usually you spend all day here.”
Castiel thought back to Dean saying that family isn’t blood, but still he replied: “I wouldn’t want to intrude but thank you for the invitation.”
Dean shrugged, and rubbed the back of his neck. “You know I practically raised Sammy. I haven’t been around someone their age since he was that old.” He let out a laugh.
He had no idea how long it had actually been when he went to the living room. Alex comforted her sister as Jack sat in the arm chair looking on with worried eyes. He pulled the coffee table closer so he could sit on the edge as he talked to the girls.
Castiel froze he stepped forward to herd the children away from Dean. Then he could pull Jack aside. He’d had a similar conversation with him before, but it had been a year ago and in even simpler terms.
“Yes. Come in.” His one-bedroom apartment didn’t have a lot of options so he was forced to lead them into living room. The living room that was scattered with glasses that once held whiskey and take-out containers. “I apologize for the mess.” He sat down and one of them sat beside him as the other sat beside him. Castiel between them until one of the spoke:
“I haven’t had a ten o’clock curfew since—I never had one. Are you sure?” He leaned back into Castiel’s space, pressing a kiss on his jaw and working his way down his neck.
Dean watched as the kid simply nodded along to the words. He seemed like he understood what Castiel was saying. The kid had to be like what, five at the very most? When he was a kid, he wouldn’t have understood half of what came out of Castiel’s mouth.
“I was a Captain.” Castiel felt the eyes on him as he got to his feet. “While poker does sound fun, I’m sure that there are games that would be more enjoyable.”
The homophobia mentioned is a past event. Castiel alludes to the fact that Luke did something. Gabriel mentioned that Luke told him he found out he was gay. There is a flash back to when Castiel is in college, approximately 19 or 20. He thinks he's going to have the apartment alone to have a date with a guy he's been seeing, they are about to have sex when Luke comes home unexpectedly. Luke uses a slur when talking to Castiel and threatens to out him to his ROTC leader (at this time Don't Ask Don't Tell would have been in effect so Castiel could be kicked out of the military if Luke followed through).
Castiel slowly followed him out, but Dean charged ahead to where his brother stood. He watched them interact playfully before he waved to Jack so he could help him plate up. As he stood around the table gathering food, he saw Jody come up behind him.
“Coffee is terrible, but at least it’s free.” Jody set a mug of coffee on her desk along with a few packets of sugar.
They all sit down at the table and take terms dishing up the pasta. Castiel and Jack eat in amicable silence while Dean looks between the two of them curiously. “I’m sorry, maybe you can do silent dinners, but can we talk about something? This is killing me.”
“Yeah, it can be a lot. I saw you talking with Andrea. She’s real nice, but gets friendly pretty quick. Probably started a lot of questions about Jack?”
“I haven’t seen you around before. I’m Benny. And this is my wife, Andrea.” He held out a hand to shake.
Alfie grabbed the drink from Castiel’s hand, and practically ends up in his laps. Their mouths meet and the kiss is far from innocent. It’s long and hard, tongue probing inside as Alfie grabs a fistful of Castiel’s sweater. Castiel groaned, grinding his hips against Alfie in the attempt to get some sort of stimulation. “Bedroom?” the smaller man asked.
This is basically just a fic of the tropes that I love (not all of them, but quite a few). First things first, make sure to read the tags, I've added what I think are important starting out to know but I will try to update as I post. Additionally in the notes at the end of the chapter I will post anything that may be a content/trigger warning. Also after the warnings I may post fun facts/additional information.
Time passed quickly as they struggle in the small space to get contact. Or at least Castiel does as he’s not been with someone in a car since high school. Dean seemed to know the vehicle like the back of his hand. After some time, they pulled apart, Dean breathed heavy as he settled back down. “I thought you didn’t have sex on the first date.”
He didn’t check his phone until an hour later. Even though he thought the news would brighten Jack’s mood, Castiel knew that he was perceptive and had picked up on his father’s disappointment. Still, he went to play in the backyard while Castiel tidied the kitchen, looking at the large bank of windows the entire time. After a while his phone rang again.
“But you did.” He didn’t know how to convey to Dean how much it really did mean to him. Other than his family, Jody had been the only other person that was truly there for him. But they were there for each other. Dean did it with seemingly no agenda. There didn’t seem to be pity or worry in his actions.
After breakfast is made, it felt strangely domestic. Dean has eaten, so he offers to make the sandwiches for lunch while Castiel is at the table, trying to fix the girls’ hair. Another thing that he is not used. Alex’s hair is pin straight, but pins it away from her face with a butterfly clip. For Claire he coaxes her curls into clumsy twin braids, a skill he learned from all the years he was forced to play with Anna.
Castiel did not respond. He put down his pen and went to his email. Sam sighed and got up to walk out. At the last minute he called out: “I will accept your invitation. Please tell Ellen that I will be making a pie.”
There’s a crash followed by some shouting and a giggling then a: “Mr. Novak!” The man’s shoulders drop as he ran back into the house. Dean tried to peek his head in through the doorway, resisting the urge to go inside. The house was clean and organized, the only sign of kids is the sound he heard and the swings out front.
“Here is the check,” Castiel slid a check across the counter, but he also set a pie down in front of him. “I asked Sam. He said that pie was your favorite.”
“Your mannerisms and you told me at pick-up a few days ago that she broke up with that man she was dating.”
“Better than the vending machine,” Jody said as she grabbed it. “Things have been crazy with Alex’s soccer and Claire’s baseball. It’s not like they are training for the major leagues.” She unwrapped the sandwich. “But I have a feeling that you didn’t ask to meet me for lunch to listen to me complain about kids.”
Dean did. When it seemed like they were going to drive until they ran out of road, Dean pulled into a small pullout on the edge of a cliff. The cold, angry water whipped down below. Without a warning, Dean slid across the bench seat and put an arm around his shoulder. “I like to come out here and think. Sam and I used to come out with a cooler full of beers and just watch the ocean.”
“Right. I will try to keep the children out of your hair. Feel free to come inside to use the bathroom or get water.”
“I dunno. I don’t normally work weekends.” There was teasing in his voice, even Castiel could recognize that.
He was glad that Anna installed a mount for his phone, even though he said he wouldn’t use it. Bobby’s was on the other side of town. He supposed it made sense, if he remembered right Sam said he owned his own mechanic shop that was on the property. The shop was what he saw first but he turned a little further down the road and large house came into view. There were quite a few cars out front. Castiel took a deep breath, never that great with large groups of people.
Jody’s eyes widened. “I knew it. I saw it at the barbeque.” She put her hand on her face as her elbow went to the desk. “Given that you let me know about the date that you went on, I take that you aren’t here to give me a play by play.”
“I know. The glass is single pane, I could probably do it if I had the tools.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “Would you care to stay for dinner?”
“No rush,” Castiel said, trying to force his voice to sound casual and breezy. “I actually wanted to know if you would want to stay for dinner.”
“Gabe drop the ball again?” It was Hannah. She was the only woman in their small group and she was always happy to see Jack.
Castiel had to let the sauce simmer and had nothing to do but wait. He went to the couch and was met with Jack. His son grabbed his arm and held it tightly as Alex and Claire scooted closer to him. On screen was the classic Mary Poppins. The movie he’d seen countless times as Jack loved it, the music was familiar enough to ground him.
“Not unless it’s a scheduling impossibility.” She got up and walked out without saying anything else.
Doing things one handed was not a parental super power he had acquired. As he went to grab sugar for his coffee, Jack reached towards the cookie plate setting off his balance. The only thing keeping him from cursing was the child in his arms that was quickly developing his verbal skills.
“Yes.” Castiel followed him as he walked into the dark house, it took a minute for his eyes to adjust as Dean led him to the kitchen where he pulled out a bottle of water. “Thanks. Do you think Ellen will mind if I take a few moments?”
While the children began the walk ahead, Dean put the backpack on. Castiel reached for his hand and then gave him a short, chaste kiss. Not caring who saw. It felt good to have Dean’s rough hand in his own as they walked. In the butterfly exhibit the children were delighted as they looked around the humid room filed with wild vegetation and flittering butterflies in every color of the rainbow.
In the kitchen he dried the counter of the water and hung the towel on the small rack on the side of one of the cabinets. When he turned around, he saw Castiel leaning against the counter with his arms crossed over his chest. “You know many think that my social skills are lacking, but I like to think that I am perceptive enough to notice when something is amiss. It seemed as though you wanted to ask me something.”
He knocked on the door again, but this time it is not Castiel but a girl that looked vaguely familiar instead. She couldn’t be more than seven with straight dark hair and brown eyes. She looked nothing like the man. “Can I talk with Mr. Novak?” Instead of saying anything she nodded and ran back inside the house. He saw two other children standing further back. They look to be the same age a little boy with neat brown hair and a little girl with wild blonde curls.
“I will not meddle.” She put her bowl in the kitchen sink and looked outside. “However, I think we should interfere in that.” She gestured to the children who looked to be up to mischief.
“It’ll be an hour,” Dean responded, and arranged things in a neat order on the counter. He didn’t speak again until Jack has bolted upstairs to retrieve a toy. “Good thing he didn’t seen the buns, they’re made with white flour.” He walked over to wrap Castiel in a hug planting a kiss on his cheek. “These are okay, right? I forgot you’re a health nut.”
Castiel set down the mug, holding himself as if he is cold. Dean throws an arm around him. He always forgets just how strong Castiel is until he’s in his arms. He looks smaller than Dean, but he knows it’s all lean muscle there. “Let’s just forget this and watch a movie.”
It is his turn to be caught off guard. “Do it all the time. Especially if part of my pay comes in baked goods.” He laughed. “At least if your pie is half as good as the cookies you made me.”
“I was hoping you came for other reasons.” Castiel laid a hand on his thigh with a smile. “But sure.”
“What?” Castiel didn’t think he had heard her right. Since he had eaten lunch with her a few weeks ago they hadn’t talked about Dean much other than him offering an update when prompted. That was essentially just telling her he came over for dinner.
After that they were refocused on finishing their food. Jody was in charge of ice cream as he cleaned off the table. By the time he was pouring food in Tupperware containers she sighed as she leaned against the counter. “You distracted them for a while.”
“Let’s go skip some rocks,” Castiel said, trying to shift the mood.  Still, he couldn’t push the thought out of his mind of Jack being worried that whoever he brought into their life wouldn’t be nice. For a brief moment Castiel was glad that his brother was not here. It was wrong to think so badly of the dead, but honestly it was better for Jack not to be raised by Luke. And nothing would stand in the way of Castiel making sure that Jack was safe.
“I haven’t had an apple pie life. Didn’t know if I would ever want one.” Dean shrugged and then crossed his arms over his chest as he leaned against the counter, his hips dangerously close to Castiel. “But I don’t mind it.” A hand went to Castiel’s lower back as Dean leaned in. “And I would be stupid to not give you a try because of Jack.”
After the door shut, Castiel wrapped him in his arms—rain be damned—despite the fact he was carrying to large bags of food and had a backpack. “The fireplace actually works. Sit in front of it while I grab you some dry clothes.”
“Sorry, force of habit. My siblings and I’s nickname for him. My brother was not the most agreeable person. The details of which I may tell you at some point, but…”
“Yes, you will. I promise.” Castiel probably hugged him too tight and too long, but he couldn’t help himself. Before long he was forced to let go and watched as one of the class assistants helped him put away his backpack.
Castiel saw the women who had fixed his computer carrying a box with children following her. “Go right ahead.” He watched as he ran away and surveyed the yard. “What now?” he asked Sam. The taller man clapped him on the back and led him over to a table where he at least recognized Eileen.
The drive to the veteran’s resource center from his apartment was less than 10 minutes. As he drove, he looked at Jack tucked in his car seat in the back. Life with him was not better, but not worse. It was different. A part of him was thankful for the child. He gave his life purpose and direction. One that he had been sorely lacking when he reentered civilian life.
“Just come inside when you’re finished.” Castiel walked away feeling like a weight lifted from his shoulder. Jack looked at him curiously, but he distracted the boy by asking him to help. He decided that dinner with him and Jack would be the best way to get to know Dean. While he wanted to see if they could be more than friends, he wasn’t quite sure how he really was with Jack.
“Okay.” A wide smile is spread across his face. “Is eating on the couch okay or is Mr. Manners going to insist on the table?”
“Is that a question?” Dean rolled his eyes. “Of course, Charlie’s my friend after all. I think you met her at the barbeque, bright red hair.”
“You know part of the reason Jody and I got so close is because she wants them to have positive male role models. They aren’t around a lot of men, other than Jody’s deputies.” Castiel shrugged, but before he could say more, Dean called out:
“Born and raised in Kansas. We moved around a lot after my mom passed away. Sam and I visited a lot because of Ellen and Bobby. I moved here about ten years ago and Sam eventually followed when he was done with school.”
“Kind of boring,” Dean said with a smirk across his face. Castiel held back an eyeroll, sensing he was trying to get a rise out of him. “We just talked.”
Once they were settled on the couch with Snickerdoodles he went back into the kitchen. He texted Jody to let her know what happened.
“Can someone watch Jack overnight sometime?” Dean asked jokingly. “Just wondering…you know for the future.”
Castiel held his hand tightly as they went to the parking garage. He made sure Jack was secure in booster seat before slid into the driver’s side. The way there he had to force himself to keep his eyes on the road. As he pulled up to the Catholic school, he couldn’t help but feel out of place with his old Lincoln Continental among all the SUVs and hybrids. “Now before we go in do you know the plan?”
Castiel let his hands curl up into fists, but he couldn’t bring himself to do anything to his brother. He walked into the kitchen for a glass of water, and about broke down when he saw all the carefully decorated cookies laid across the kitchen counter. Tonight, should have been perfect. He wanted to make love. He was tired of the rushed, secretive sex, but it seemed like he would never get anything more than that. Luke ruined it. Like he ruined everything.
It turns out that Dean was thrilled to be invited to the zoo. He admitted to Castiel that he didn’t give a damn about the zoo, but was excited to spend the day together even if it involved three children. He hoped that sentiment was still true, because Castiel was worn thin by the time he woke up Saturday morning. Jody was pulling a twelve-hour shift, 5am-5pm so Castiel insisted that the girls spend the night so they didn’t have to coordinate mornings.
“Yeah, thanks.” Dean downed the water, trying not to look at the man in front of him. “Listen, I’m mainly just a handyman. You are going to need a whole new roof. I have some guys I know that would be more than happy to help do it. It’ll just cost a little more.”
“Not quite ready to go,” he muttered gesturing for Dean to follow. The man had a small leather knapsack and was dressed in jeans with a tight black t-shirt.
“I’m seeing a friend. I believe I told you about Sam Winchester and his fiancé Eileen Leahy.” The lie came easily to him, but he had hung out with Sam a handful of times so it seemed like a better cover than saying he was spending time with Jody.
Castiel looked up and saw Dean. He looked just as attractive as the two times he had seen him at his house, but looked more casual in a pair of worn jeans with a black t-shirt. “Is there anything non-alcoholic?”
“The last man I was with was my sophomore year of college.” That fact just fell out even if it wasn’t quite true. There had been others in the military. Balthazar came to mind, but it felt so wrong to admit it out loud even if it didn’t have to be a secret anymore. Castiel carded a hand through his hair as Dean’s face registered confusion. Didn’t seem to understand. “Don’t ask, don’t tell was still in effect when I joined. I never… I like women too, so I never
“Are you like an accountant or something?” She narrowed her eyes as she looked him over. Most everyone was in shorts and t-shirts. He had worn a pair of khaki’s and a short sleeve button down not knowing how informal it would be.
“It is fuel efficient and has a high safety rating,” Castiel replied as he slid into it. “I had a Lincoln Continental before it and car seats were a nightmare to install.”
“Those are Mrs. Mills kids. Claire is my best friend,” Jack said and looked up at Dean. “My name is Jack.”
Castiel does just that. Typically, Jack is a light sleeper. Sleeping was a fight when he was younger. If he was his biological son he would question if insomnia was genetic. However tonight he is out cold. Summer camp combined with a movie marathon and a crash from whatever sugar Gabriel gave him seemed to be the perfect sleeping aid. By the time he gets home, Jack has woken up enough to brush his teeth and put on his pajamas. Castiel tucked him into bed and went to leave.
“Well, I brought tomatoes and lettuce.” He points to the head of iceberg. “And the patties will be made from scratch.” At that he slapped the paper wrapped package of meat. “You have pickles, right?”
“Come on. That whole dad vibe you have going on works great for some of the clients. A lot of them have some major unresolved father issues.”
The kids have seemed to have either forgotten or been sufficiently distracted by Dean and they race off. Castiel waited until they were out of ear shot and turned towards the other man. “Thank you, for coming to fix my window and helping with the kids.”
Dean waited for him to hand him one. The dish towel wasn’t one of the cheap terry cloth ones he had, but one of the thin towels with embroidered flowers on it. “I looked at the pictures upstairs.”
“Coming…” he shouted as he shoved his feet into a pair of slippers before answering the door. He should have checked the peep hole because he felt himself freeze as he saw the policeman standing in the dimly lit hallway of his apartment. “Can I help you officers?” He stood up straighter as he met their eyes. Before they said anything Castiel knew the nature of the conversation he was about to have. It was a conversation his own family had dreaded having while he was overseas.
“I am a veteran peer support specialist,” he answered quickly. When he received blank looks, he thought briefly how to rephrase it. “I help out other soldiers who have come home.”
“What do you think about getting the house painted?” Castiel asked Jack, when he finished their discussion on pollination.
“The best.” Alfie pressed a sweet kiss to his lip. “Oh! Just one second.” He walked away and came back with a small bundle. “Not the best at wrapping.”
“Would that be so bad?” Dean questioned, he looked to Castiel then immediately amended the statement: “Don’t get me wrong, parents hate me. Always have. Sam was the charmer.” Dean cleared his throat sat up straighter. “I just thought you would like that.”
It clicked into place for Castiel then. He had always known that Jody tried to fiercely protect the ones that she loved. He hadn’t known the Jody
Dinner Friday night had been a bit early, but at least Jody was there to help him cook. Even though she wanted to help clean up, he ordered her to go home and sleep, sending her on her way with a container full of leftovers. That was just after six, which meant he had to last two hours with the children.
The food in Castiel’s mouth turned to ash. He only had an hour for lunch he couldn’t afford to spend the time talking about one of the worst days of his life. But that didn’t mean it didn’t stop the memories from swirling around in his head.
“I do have a secret to admit.” Castiel reached across the table, wanting to touch Dean’s hands. He liked how they felt under his own, they were worn from all the hard work he did, but they felt comfortable in his own. “I didn’t really need my house painted right away. I just wanted an excuse to see you again after the barbeque.”
“I need some water, please excuse me.” He walked up to the first cooler he saw and opened it. It was full of ice and beer. He stared at it probably way too long, fingers itching to grab one. Then he slammed it with probably too much force.
“Unfortunately, my skills in the kitchen are better suited to baking, but Jack finds my food passable.”
Castiel fixed Dean with a look typically reserved for Claire’s sass. “We will agree to disagree. Now, let’s try to wrangle the children. I am very interested in the butterfly exhibit even if the children seem to be in opposition.” Castiel got off the bench before Dean can reach for him. As he goes to speak with the children, he looked at Dean. He’s packing up everything back into Castiel’s back pack. A part of him knew it was not right to criticize Dean’s actions. They weren’t that bad. He knew the real criticism came from the fact that this was unknown territory for him. Dean—the man who never wanted to talk about “feelings and shit”—certainly enjoyed physical contact. He had no care in the world as he held hands or casually touched Castiel’s back or arm. It was the approach of a man that had no shame or fear.
