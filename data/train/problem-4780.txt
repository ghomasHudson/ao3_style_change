A beat passes.
The words hang in the air like a guillotine above their necks before Dean even realizes they’re out of his mouth. Cas stares, that same even look as always, but Dean can see fear buried underneath. Like he didn’t expect Dean’s reaction to his goading, and has suddenly found himself in the deep end without a life vest. Cas bites his lip, and with the flush of pink across his cheekbones and at the tips of his ears, it strikes Dean how
The Angel is stronger than Alastair. It seems to have infinite stamina and power, while towering three feet above the demon. Its bright glow never once falters with the clang of weapon on weapon, and Dean can tell it’s making Alastair angrier the longer the fight lasts. He gets the sense that ordinarily, this would hardly be a fair match at all.
He opens his eyes and has to blink twice to make sure he isn’t dreaming.
Jack nods. “And while I want him out of that place as much as you do, I know the depth of his feelings and I know the potential pain that lies between you should you not...reciprocate them the same way. We may not approve of his decision, but he did find some form of happiness, Dean, and he deserves happiness. So I’ll repeat my question.” Jack straightens his shoulders. “What are your intentions towards Castiel?”
That’s a sound Dean will happily listen to for the rest of his life.
Sam sighs. It’s been a long week for them. The demon they were after managed to capture a 9-year-old boy, and even though they were able to exorcise the thing and save the host, it had been too late for the child. Dean had stood tall as the mother cried into his arms earlier that evening, but Sam knew it had seriously rattled them both. No one likes losing a kid.
As he watches Dean’s chest rise and fall, he ponders his gradual descent from Heaven. Lucifer’s plummet was violent, lightning fast, full of fire and brimstone. There was no doubt as to what was occurring. Any angel close enough to smell the sulfur knew to drop to their knees and mourn their lost brother.
It’s not the first time the angel has gone all mother hen on him, but it might be the first time Dean notices how comforting it feels. Warmth flutters in his stomach at the thought that he’s got someone he knows, someone he really trusts, watching his six in this hellscape.
before Dean lets out a muffled snore from the backseat.
"I don't think the light will hurt you, Dean." Cas reaches up and pinches the air, like he could hold the color between his fingers if he wanted to. And how like him that would be, to use his great and terrible power for something so small and lovely. Something like catching a rainbow to give to a friend on a rainy day.
He grabs a bottle of bourbon. On second thought, he stops, and grabs another.
Whatever scant hope for actual freedom Dean had been nursing drains away. “Work? What work?”
The last thing he remembers is Alastair’s hand extended towards him, and a brilliant flash of light.
“Hey, Dean, wake up.”
for this kind of work spread quickly through the ranks of Hell when he first picked up that knife. To this day Alastair brings him special prisoners, those who’ve done horrible things in life and have earned horrible things in death.
For tonight, Dean holds a former angel in his arms and listens to him breathe. He presses a hand over Cas’s heart, feels its steady drumbeat. Cas shudders at Dean's warm exhale on the back of his neck, and revels in the way the curves of their bodies seem to align so perfectly.
When Cas tentatively lifts his hand, Dean can see the wound is gone.
Dean wades into the dark and blinks as his pupils dilate at the drop in brightness. He hears the whisper of skin on rock and can just make out how Cas is sliding his fingers along the stone walls. He silently walks the perimeter, testing its borders. Dean's warning to avoid the crystals dies on his lips as Cas starts weaving his palm through the spaces between them. Right. Angel. He can probably sense creepy magic better than Dean can. Aside from the faint glow of the gems, there’s ambient light from the entrance. Day and night do cycle here, but there's a chronic dusk to purgatory; a hazy, cool-toned fog that absorbs all warmth and never dissipates. As evening falls outside, that telltale purplish tint illuminates Cas’s profile, angled away.
Sam and Jack turn to look at him.
“I don’t know, man!” Dean sputters. “Once upon a time I thought you were totally invincible, and now you’re bleeding on me. I can’t tell anymore what qualifies as a stupid question!”
“Fuck, Sammy!” Dean jumps up, liquor splashed across his jeans and glass shards crunching under his boots. “That was Woodford!” He strides to the closet to retrieve the broom.
“Fuck, Sammy.” He drops his head onto the table with a loud
“-ean. Dean! Listen to me, open your eyes.”
“So what, no Mozart up there? Amy Winehouse? The Beatles?”
It all rushes back in one fell swoop. The abandoned warehouse. The coven of witches occupying it, trying to summon Lucifer and offer their services. Their massive altar under cracking cement ceilings and rusty I-beams. The defensive spell one had cast that succeeded only in crumbling the roof on top of them.
Dean wouldn’t even blame him. Sometimes he doesn’t want to stick around in his own life either.
Once Cas's feet are steady enough beneath him, Sam slides into the driver’s seat and shuts the door. Cas leans his elbows on the window frame and peers in through the opening.
Weeks ago, after Dean had viciously beheaded a ghoul who had no information on Cas’s whereabouts, Benny had asked him, “You sweet on that angel, cher?”
“I can’t.” Says Jack, scanning the pages. “The Empty, Heaven, Hell, even Purgatory...they’re all separate entities, like sovereign nations. Since I am...what I am now, I cannot simply cross into the boundaries of another’s domain without warning, especially not to steal one of their souls.”
“I get it.” Dean croaks out. “I wish I didn’t, cause I’m still pissed as hell, but I do. And y'know, if the tables were turned...I probably would've done the same thing.”
“Sideways, Cas, sideways. His nose is broken, we don’t want him choking on his own blood.” Cas nods, and shifts Dean’s head. He is perched delicately on the edge of the seat, with his feet on the sidewalk and Dean’s temple braced against his hip.
“You wake up screaming his name.”
Dean sucks his teeth. "You're only human, buddy."
"No, Dean, look," Cas says, pulling away and gesturing to the cave walls around them.
How one of Dean’s primary reasons for maintaining self control and not climbing Cas like a tree all these years has vanished into thin air.
My eyes should be turning black any second now, so I sure as fuck do not deserve to be resurrected like some righteous hero.”
Dean gapes at him. "Abso-
Dean closes his eyes, grips Cas tight, and steps backwards into what he hopes is the rift, just as the tinny sound of the watch alarm goes off and The Empty shrieks into the nothingness.
He angles Cas’s chin up with one hand on his jaw, and takes a deep breath before slicing a thin but deep cut under his Adam's apple.
or whatever.” Dean weakly imitates that croaky voice from The Princess Bride, and then remembers at Cas’s blank look that he never gets the pop culture stuff. Damn, he’s gotta put that one at the top of their list. Cas would like it.
“No, you're right," Cas admits. "I should've told you. I just didn't know how, because I didn't want it to be true.”
Dean is so stuck inside his own head that he doesn’t register what Alastair is saying to him.
He can see his own body, dimly, and feels his way down his torso and legs to make sure everything’s where it needs to be. He can see as far as his own boots as he makes his way to standing, but there is absolutely nothing else around him. No light, no horizon. The sound of his feet on the not quite ground echoes widely above him, like he’s under a giant dome.
Dean puffs out a breath of gratitude, feels his mouth quirk up in a smile without his permission. “Thanks. I guess this damsel in distress habit of mine is keeping you in business.”
“Angels shouldn’t hurt.”
and lays a hand on Cas’s jaw. Blue eyes meet his own, finally lighting up in awareness at the tender touch.
“No!” Dean huffs a laugh. “No, it...that feels nice.”
Every inch of Dean’s body is caked in blood.
Dean bites back a cry, and yells “I
the ravine was right there. If he’d known the ghost would shove Cas like a rag doll, tumbling into the dark of a thirty foot drop to a stone outcropping.
Dean jerks, fists flying before his eyes are even open. Sam blocks it easily, since Dean’s balance is so off. “Whoa! Whoa, Dean, stop it! It’s me, slow down.” Sam holds Dean’s fist still and shakes his shoulder until the light comes back into Dean’s eyes. He blinks twice, hard, and slumps back into his chair.
“It would get him through the rift with me,” says Dean, snapping his fingers as he realizes another problem that can be crossed off the list, “and it would rip up his contract. The Empty only wants angels, right? If he’s human, it can’t come for him again, even if he’s happy.” God, Dean hopes he’ll be happy.
“Cas?
Cas weakly bats a hand at Dean. “Ge’ off me.”
Cas is shifting to say something else when Dean’s stomach rebels again. He scrambles for the toilet, but very little comes out. After a prolonged spell of dry heaving, he’s left whimpering into the bowl, which is when he remembers that he collapsed here two hours ago in nothing more than a T-shirt and boxer briefs. And now a literal angel is standing here watching him upchuck in his underwear, as if the universe couldn’t pack enough humiliation into one evening. Can't a man have a complete physical breakdown in peace?
Dean glances down at himself, having forgotten about his post explosion appearance. “Oh, yeah.”
He speaks aloud into the darkness, striding forward purposefully. “I am going to find Cas.” The ping of sound hits higher in his ear, closer to his left side. He adjusts course. “I am going to find Cas!” He’s running now, the sound bouncing right in his face, high pitched and strong. “I am going to find Ca-!”
Cas goes on anyway. “When you were in distress, I heard you calling for me. It doesn’t matter that you couldn’t invoke my name. Your subconscious likely associates me with your rescue from Hell. That part of you knew to...reach out to me to extricate you from the nightmare. So I heard you, and I came.”
Cas shakes his head with flinch. “Not you. Jude. Saint Jude, I only just recalled. He was...the patr’n saint of lost causes.” Dean's jaw drops at the irony. "Ah, so you didn't know. I wasn't sure if you were trying to tell me something in that horribly covno...convoluted way of yours."
Dean kneels on the ground, his knees grumbling in protest. He tentatively folds his hands over his chest. Then, he bows his head. He isn’t sure if he’s supposed to do any of it.
Dean has to clear his throat half a dozen times before he can make real words come out. “Where’s Sam?”
“Lucky for us, I’ve got some other moves that’ll sweep you off your feet.”
So yeah, when Dean sees an honest-to-god cave over the crest of the hill, with only one entrance and a roof to protect their heads, on the day he finally tracked down Cas? It feels like an olive branch from the universe. God knows he’s more than earned one.
Sam and Dean both become horrifyingly domestic in the months that follow. Sam buys dog toys that quickly find themselves scattered across the bunker floor, chewed to bits by Mira, as they now call her. Dean goes a whole week without putting on real clothes, opting strictly to lounge in his robe and slippers, no longer fearing that he’ll wake up to a monstrous attack. Sam starts reading for fun again, dense science fiction novels and obscure biographies. Dean cooks them food every single day. Burgers, pasta, sandwiches, even that veggie bacon Sam had requested. He earned it, Dean thought.
He tries to place this image in his head. Yellowed pages of mythology and lore flutter to the forefront. Where has he seen this creature? Wings. Hundreds of eyes. Blinding light.
Dean stumbles. Cas steadies him with an amused glance. Oh, fuck, this is a
As swirls of black and white energy pulse through both of them, their eyes meet. The Angel’s voice turns low and pleading, cutting through the din.
“Cas, hey,
He senses the wetness on his face. Even though he understands how tears work, he’s never produced them himself. He wishes for a spare hand so he could wipe them away.
Cas pulls a face, squinting upwards like he can’t quite find Dean’s face. “Forgive my...current lack of reasoning skills, but I assume you're bein’ facetious?"
The cut does sting when Sam pokes at it with his tongue, but he can feel the way Cas’s weight is sagging under his hands. “No, don’t worry about me. I’ll heal on my own.” Cas braces himself to argue the point, but seems to lose an internal battle, and instead just tilts his head back against the car to breathe.
So of course shit hits the fan as soon as Dean dares to
Cas swallows nervously. “I can’t move us, why can’t I move us?”
Should.
Sam paces back and forth across the library, his heels striking the floor rhythmically. Jack sits in the armchair, flipping through a book of runes, carefully turning ancient pages. Dean listens from his seat at the table.
As sleep begins to pull at him like the tide, Dean jerks minutely, fearful of returning to the bloody chamber.
He talks Cas through swallowing the pills. He only chokes briefly, which Dean takes as a win. Shining a flashlight into Cas's eyes earns him a growl, but does confirm that the pupils are dilated to wildly different sizes. Definitely concussed. Then he tapes a temporary gauze patch over Cas’s forehead, which is bleeding more sluggishly now but will need stitches later.
you don't."
Dean bites down on the declaration that it’d be worth it. He’d be with Cas, forever, somewhere. Something tells him that would be okay, even there.
No one has touched Cas there since the stitches six months ago. There's no pain, but he jerks away in surprise, and finds himself twisting over the edge of the bed. With a gasp, he pulls his arms in to protect his body from the fall, and shuts his eyes.
Dean purses his lips in thought. “‘Require’ is a strong word. Honestly, I’m not sure. We can’t quite tell how time passes, and I don’t really get hungry or thirsty. A nap here or there doesn’t hurt.”
“I could at least put you to sleep.” He's taken an awkward step back now, appearing almost self conscious. “It takes very little energy, and the grace-induced rest should ease your discomfort.”
“Our Father has a task for you, Castiel.”
Castiel’s white wings flair, and he lets himself fall.
God, this is a bad idea.
So in daylight, Dean is safe. Relatively.
Cas pulls away a few inches, just enough to catch one of Dean’s palms between his own. He arranges Dean’s hand into a two-fingered salute, the kind he’d use for healing and transport if they weren’t stuck in Wonderland. Cas tilts his chin upwards and presses Dean’s fingers to the pulse point below his jaw. Dean holds his breath until he feels the heartbeat there, strong and steady. Blood and grace rushing through his veins as one.
Dean would say more, but instead he pukes for the fourth time that night.
Dean has been thinking about that post-nightmare visit when Cas stayed all night long. How he woke up the next morning and their arms were tangled together, and Cas had still been fast asleep. He's been slowly and steadily losing power, and Dean has refused to notice. An angel doesn’t just crash beside you on a shitty motel mattress for sleepover funsies. He does it because he’s tired.
The charge in the air breaks.
Since Cas fell, he’s been exploring the wonders of the internet in order to brush up on his music history. Dean was slightly offended at first that his own classic rock collection wasn’t enough to satisfy Cas’s curiosity, but the change has actually been pretty nice. He may be an old dog who knows every word of his favorite records by heart (and stubbornly listens to nothing else), but he’s not dead. He can appreciate talent and artistry. A delicious guitar lick here, a brilliant lyric there, a pounding bass thumping through his chest like a second heartbeat.
Something dark flutters in Dean’s chest at the sight. In offering to clean his ass up, the angel literally got his hands dirty. That feels damningly poetic, and deeply sad.
The relentless shiver under Dean’s skin deadens for the first time in forty years.
“Hey,” Dean says, a little sharper than he intends. He feels like they're sliding back towards the 'mud monkey' metaphor and it's making him bristle. He crouches down before Cas again so they're face to face. “I’m human. You don’t think I’m useless, do you?”
“...What?” He manages to whisper.
Cas swallows away the apprehension, mutters “Never,” and takes his hand.
And he’s never getting out.
Dean feels like he’s taken a crowbar to the back of the head.
“What do you mean, and?” Dean snaps. “He told me he loved me, Sam.”
A tiny voice in the back of his mind chimes in, praying to a God in whom Dean does not believe.
“Just hold onto me, Dean. Now.” He demands.
Cas’s gaze flicks past his face for a moment. Sam follows his eyeline, and finds the little silver angel Dean had hung from the rearview a couple months back. His brother had refused to explain it at the time, but Sam had his suspicions about where it came from. Now he feels even more sure.
Dean immediately thinks of the times he’s grinded against scantily clad women in bars, but those aren’t the kinds of stories he’s too keen on sharing. It’s also probably not what Cas means. He casts his mind back further. He and Sam have been bouncing their heads to music in the Impala all their lives. Dean has grooved alone to Led Zeppelin in many a motel room, playing air guitar. And there was that time when-
He sits up and tries to get his eyes to focus on the creature before him. He has to squint through his lashes to see any contrast in the light, for any form to become evident. As the thing steps closer, more details shift into focus. Eventually Dean makes sense of a vaguely bipedal shape. There is a torso, two legs, and two arms, one holding a viciously sharp silver blade. But that is where any humanoid resemblance ends.
Cas pulls Dean’s chin so they’re directly eye to eye, and then mutters with iron in his voice. “Dean Winchester, I swear to you that I will never leave your side again, in this lifetime or the next.”
He goes to thank Cas again, and notices how close their faces are. Cas’s expression is carefully flat. Dean opens his mouth-
“So what are you gonna do about it?”
Which, fair.
buddy, it’s not mine.” Dean reassures him, pressing a palm against his chest to try and stop the advance. A terrier holding back a mastiff. Castiel looks at him, disbelieving, and does not drop his hands. “Sam and I fought some vamps tonight, I just haven’t washed up yet.” He can feel how close the angel’s thumb is to touching that handprint on his shoulder, and he gulps. “I’m not hurt, I promise.”
With a quirk of his eyebrows, Cas states proudly, “Yes, I am.”
He does snort at that one. “Well, Sam kinda called shotgun for life. God, leave it to you to attempt words like ‘relegated’ when you’re concussed.”
“Practice.” Dean gives him a wry smile. “And booze.”
Castiel steadies himself, reaches out with his grace to locate his charge, and flies to him.
Cas brushes past them both and strides into the cave.
Dean steels himself against the programmed flush of shame. He is not embarrassed by this. He’s just so used to pushing down his own desires. But wants this, and he’s gotta say it. “I want to tell him I love him, Jack. I need to. He’s gotta hear it. And I want to get him out of that turbo hell void of bullshit and hold him in my arms and know that he’s safe and okay and alive.”
He doesn’t know what else to do.
Dean can hear the hitch in Cas’s rough voice, and realizes with a start that he has let his eyes sink closed. “Why?”
Sam holds him and aches for his brother. His poor, oblivious, bereaved brother. Mira whines a bit and lays her head on Dean’s lap. His hand finds her nose and it seems to ground him.
“Alastair had me on his rack.” Dean continues, wringing his hands over his stomach to hide their shaking. “He told me...he said I had never left. And that I never would.”
turn.”
No one has asked him about his ‘intentions’ since he was 16 and got dragged home to meet a girl’s parents after three dates. He feels equally as equipped to answer it now as he did back then.
Sending love and gratitude to
He feels Cas’s labored breathing against his collarbone and wonders if this accident could be the thing that breaks him. If this is the last straw that sends him fleeing from their batshit crazy life. If he’ll run screaming without saying goodbye, or if he'll bother to shake Dean's hand with a
Dean stops short. “What?”
The Angel struggles to its feet, still radiating grace and power even as it lurches upright.
Through the fog of his rattled skull, Castiel is aware this is not the solution to all their problems. A blow
May we all one day know a love like that of these two idiots. But hopefully with less blood loss and betrayal.
-living in these...tissue paper bodies? It’s beyond overwhelming.”
Cas clenches his jaw. “Don’t thank me yet. I couldn’t cover all of you.”
Gently, like he's handling something precious, Dean presses his chest against Cas’s back. The heat of the contact between them simmers, and Cas melts into it.
“You’re laughing?” Dean glares at Sam incredulously. “What are you laughing at? Shut up! This is not a joke!”
“Because I’m gonna pass out from blood loss soon, and I’m trying to stay awake as long as I can.” Dean focuses again on the warmth of the body above him, how stark a difference it is to the leeching cold of the stone at his back.
Dean barely notices as Sam takes Jack by the arm and mutters “Let’s give them a minute, okay?” He’s too busy sliding an arm under Cas’s shoulders and propping him up, one hand flat against his chest so he can keep feeling that heartbeat.
Dean sputters.
“No, Cas,” Dean breathes, and suddenly he’s kneeling between Cas’s feet, chest to chest, gently wrapping his arms around shoulders wracked with sobs. He tucks his nose into Cas’s neck and feels two hands twist into the fabric over his shoulder blades. Tears dampen his shirt where Cas presses his face. “You deserve better than this. I’m sorry.”
“Don’t blaspheme,” Cas bites out.
“Well? Take my hand, sweetheart, what are you waiting for?” Alastairs sneers.
Tonight, the room is filled with fuzzy-sounding jazz standards. Cas had informed him earlier that evening that the playlist consisted of radio hits from the 1930s. Dean had thought privately that neither of them would be able to pin a date to the crooning voices without Google’s assistance. Sometimes entire decades of music sound the same to him.
His words may slur, but Dean feels them warm his skin like sunlight breaking through the clouds.
“Please save me.”
Dean grumbles. “Yeah, Sam told me. Apparently it was obvious.”
Jack turns to look at him with that playful glint again. “We placed a bet on you two. I was sure you would never find the courage to confess your feelings to Cas.”
Dean hums his assent. “That’s the plan.” Another thought strikes him. “Can’t you just mojo me?”
Cas continues. “I’m becoming more human with every passing moment. It’s been happening for months, and this must be the culmination.”
Tonight he wakes up sweating profusely, and sees flashes of Cas pulling his hand away from Dean’s while they stand in the storm of the Purgatory portal. His words ghost an echo in Dean’s ears, fading as consciousness claims him.
They kiss a lot, and cry a lot more, and hold each other until it feels real.
A shadow crosses Cas's face. “I can’t.”
He gets it, now.
But weirdly, muscle memory flips an old switch behind his ribs. His pulse slows and his hands steady. Alastair might be nightmare fuel for Dean, but he doesn’t have time to indulge in that. If this shapeshifting dick is the only thing between them and the life they want, Dean will not back down. He doesn’t have to work to keep his voice low and steady and dangerous when he says, “You will never touch him again.”
He walks back into the bar to a cacophony of yelling. The tattooed man has a hand fisted in Dean’s henley while the other is smashing blows across his face. Behind them, four of his buddies are crowding the brawling pair, shouting insults. The entire bar roils with violent energy, and smaller fights begin to erupt.
Dean steels himself.
"Thanks, man. Hey, will you watch over my car too if I hang it from the rearview mirror?"
Another careless step has Cas gripping Dean’s jacket with a gasp. “I told you...th-this wouldn’t go well.” His words slur together.
Alastair’s face morphs at the sight. It grows and ripples, furious, oil slick, grotesque features popping in and out of sight. His body bubbles, growing from his sprawled position on the ground. “What did you do?” A thousand deafening voices seem to roar at once, the figure swelling until it towers above them.
“Damn, am I glad you heard me,” he's saying, but Cas is already turning away. He’s got his hands on the man pummeling Dean, and for a second Sam thinks he’s about to burn his eyes out.
Tomorrow morning, Sam will arrive with the rare book he has been tracking down. He’ll walk in and see Dean cradling Cas’s bruised body, spooning him with an arm around his waist and lips pressed to the top of his spine. Sam will tease his brother mercilessly, whisper-chanting
“What’s your name?” Dean demands.
Genuine concern wipes his face of sarcasm. Cas crosses the space quickly, like Dean might actually be stroking out. Once he’s close enough, Dean closes fingers around the dirty lapels and pulls.
Anael nods to him before stabbing through a hellhound. This plan has been thoroughly discussed. He entrusts the fight to his siblings and prays the garrison is able to maintain their position here, so Castiel can proceed to find the Righteous Man alone. Once Dean Winchester’s soul is in hand, he will send his siblings a telepathic message and they will all fly skyward as one.
to make that sound manlier, but the darkness takes him before he can find the breath.
An even worse notion intrudes. Maybe the Winchesters will both perish as a direct result of his failure. He’s a fugitive of Heaven now, with a cosmic target on his back. His weakness of mind and spirit is a vulnerability that any of their enemies could exploit. The brothers consider him an ally, but perhaps they shouldn’t. Perhaps his presence in this lessened state is nothing more than a liability that will get them killed.
It’s not there. All he sees is rock.
gets the angel’s attention. Cas cocks his head to peer across the cave, concerned eyes sweeping up Dean's form to check for injuries before they land on his face. The shock of blue sends Dean tumbling into memories of a barn alight with sparks and gunfire. That first night feels like a lifetime ago, and still the déjà vu hits him like a semi. They always end up here - piercing eye contact anchoring them to one another while the world spins too quickly around them. Centrifugal motion pulling at Dean's solar plexus, even as he stands perfectly still. He wonders absently if being the subject of Cas’s intense focus will ever fail to send his heart fluttering into his throat.
Sam has never seen Dean look so flummoxed. It’s like a demon has come up behind him and solidly connected a crowbar to the back of his head. If he looks really closely he can imagine the gears turning behind Dean eyes, which are beginning to mist.
~~~~~
“Oh yeah?” Dean asks. “Well he didn’t.”
In the last few minutes, purgatory's mock sun has well and truly set. The loss of haze from the entrance has left them in near darkness - except for the patches of crystal growing between the stones. Their subtle glow has brightened into a magnificent shine. Every edge and face splinters outward in a kaleidoscope of colors. The ceiling above them is illuminated too, clusters glittering like stars above their heads. The cave has transformed into a cocoon of prisms.
“Okay, don’t want that.” Dean’s eyes skim over the body braced above his own, but he doesn’t know where to put his hand. He's ambushed by the memory of his awkward teenage self asking Sally Perkins to slow dance at the freshman formal. He settles for resting his palm loosely on Cas’s chest, the seams of his tie fraying under Dean’s fingers. “Is this good?”
So given their luck, it stands to reason that the moment Sam excuses himself to use the bathroom, all hell breaks loose.
Dean curses their universally shitty timing. He looks around them once again, as if there might suddenly be a glowing exit sign beside their heads. Moving his neck brings on a rush of dizziness so intense, it could only be blood loss. The crushed arm must be practically hemorrhaging by now, especially if the rocks around them have shifted. “Okay, well, no way a human could do what you’re doing right now. They’d be squashed like a bug. Besides, you teleported to our motel, what, yesterday? You’re definitely still rocking the angel mojo. Now why don’t you prove it by stowing the existential crisis and zapping us out of here. Capiche?”
“So you can’t get him out,” he mutters, misery seeping in like a winter chill through the warm spring air.
Cas pulls him to his feet. Dean wobbles a bit with vertigo, but is able to brace himself with one hand on the wall and one on Cas’s shoulder. The guy feels surprisingly solid under the baggy trench coat, so Dean dares to drop more of his weight there. Cas compensates easily, positioning an arm around Dean’s waist. The steady pressure of his hand warms the skin of Dean’s hip, currently clad in nothing but thin shorts. Cas supports him into the bedroom, having to turn nearly sideways to drag them through the narrow door frame. Then he flips back the covers and deposits Dean into bed.
“Shit, Cas, you’re bleeding.” Sam gingerly tucks a hand over Cas’s shoulder and presses so he leans forward on the bench, presenting his back. “You’re, like. Really bleeding. Fuck. Hang on.”
Dean jumps backward, and he turns to see Sam leaning against the bathroom door jamb with wet hair dripping on his forehead. His arms are crossed over his chest and he’s smirking at the intimate scene before him.
“Cas, look at me, right now.” Dean demands, glancing back and forth from his bloody face to the road before them.
Dean feels a little giddy. “Here, you can learn the next part. It goes like this.
Dean sits up, sliding backwards til their shoulders bump and the headboard creaks against their combined weight. “What is it?” It hits him that the handprint scar is now nearly pressed up against its maker, separated only by a thin cotton shirt and the dense weave of a trench coat.
Cas blows out a careful breath. “The concrete is still settling. Somewhere above us, rocks just shifted. I felt it.”
Cas’s eyebrows quirk up. “I’m aware. I just didn’t think dancing would be the kind of thing you’d participate in, let alone admit to so readily. It doesn’t seem like your style.” He looks Dean’s slumped figure up and down. “I don’t know that I believe it.”
"What is this?" Cas asks.
When Cas opens his eyes, they’re flat and unseeing. “I can’t reach my grace. It’s like it’s locked away, or boarded up. Hidden from me.” He looks straight through Dean, as if he’s entirely alone in the world. Then, his eyes widen.
He panics.
But maybe Cas still has some mind-reading powers, because he takes the words right out of Dean's mouth. “I hate this. Iss...not fair. My entire existence, I b’lieved that God was just. But...was my sin so unforgivable that
When he focuses back in, Cas is staring at him. His lip is quivering, his mask of calm about to break and take a piece of Dean’s heart with it.
Dean pulls back and tucks a finger under Cas's chin, tilting his face up so he can catch Cas’s gaze. His cornflower blue eyes are bright in the warm glow of the room, and he is so beautiful it makes Dean ache.
Cas goes quiet, and Dean worries he’s drifting again. That is until he breathes out, “Would you keep singing?”
Dean takes the opportunity to stare some more.
A vicious right hook splits his lip open. He gathers his wits enough to see that Dean’s strikes against his own attacker are getting weaker and the blood down his front is getting heavier. One final hit to Dean's temple and Sam watches his eyes rolls back. “Dean needs you, Cas, please!”
“Of course I do.” Dean says fiercely. Then, weaker. “Did.”
A slimy voice crawls into his ear.
Castiel forces Dean to lower the weapon by pressing a single finger to it and pushing it to the floor.
Cas releases a breath Sam hadn’t noticed he’d been holding. A moment later, he topples sideways out of the car.
“Aw, baby.” Alastair’s sweaty fingers pinch his chin, bringing them eye to eye. “We’re already here.”
Castiel has always marveled at how powerful a beating heart can be. The gorgeous, vivid muscle has always been his favorite of his Father’s bodily inventions. There is a hypnotic draw to its constant motion, powered by a spark of divine electricity. It is a strong enough symbol that humans have replicated it in their clocks, their music, and their stories for generations, all with one unifying message: what miraculous tales a simple pulse can tell.
human. He doesn’t always need food, though Sam encourages him to eat at least one meal a day to be safe. They learn when he accidentally pulls a door off its hinges that he’s still stronger than an average man his size. He can also go a couple days without sleeping. More than once Dean has woken in the night to find the other side of the bed empty, with Cas sitting by the window of their motel room, watching the neon signs flicker outside. (He and Cas share most of the time, only because Sam sprawls like a felled Sasquatch. Even though they staunchly keep to their own sides, his not-so-little brother is uncharacteristically thrilled about Dean’s strange new bedfellow. He won’t stop teasing them about it.) But regardless of Cas’s nocturnal episodes and freaky metabolism, very few of his party tricks remain. No fluttering around, no healing, no telekinesis, and definitely no angel radio. Once, Sam asks if he can still hear the Host, and Cas responds that his head has never been so silent and yet so loud.
Dean sighs. They’ve all been avoiding the A-word for months. Of course, a gushing head wound functions a bit like alcohol - a drunken mind speaks a sober truth. “No, Cas, they shouldn’t.”
It’s only at night when the slimy hands claw at him in his sleep.
“No,” Cas says, almost horrified, like the realization has surprised him as well.
to be here. It will mean accepting that Cas is only a temporary addition to the team, and will eventually realize there are better options out there. Dean can’t handle that thought right now, so he doesn’t try.
“Have I what?”
Dean swallows. “How?”
Cas’s lips are pink, his breath comes out short, and his eyes are a deep sky blue. Dean has never loved a sight more in his entire life.
Over time, Dean watches Cas develop human-adjacent habits and opinions. He prefers being barefoot to wearing the thrift store boots they found him, though Dean will only allow it in motel rooms, because "Gross, man, there's bugs and shit out there." He devours the dime store novels Sam hands him, and gets so invested in the love lives of the characters that he recounts entire scenes to the boys from the back of the car. He smitingly glares at a waitress in Alabama when she accidentally brings him decaf, which leaves Dean choking on his eggs. Cas is funny, in that too earnest off-beat way of his, and Dean finds himself laughing a lot more often than he used to.
“Y’know, you’re cute when you babble.” Dean doesn’t mean to say it out loud, and yet out loud it is said.
Cas drops his head. His breath goes shaky against Dean’s collarbone, and his weight stutters at the wrong time. “I...I can’t hear it, the beat…” He sounds genuinely worried, like the stakes are higher than they should be.
He tucks his head back into the crook of Cas’s neck, and sleeps soundly.
“Cas, if you’d just shut up and let me talk, I am trying to tell you th-”
"In English, Sunshine."
“I never…” Dean sniffs hard, wipes his shirt sleeve under his nose. “I never let myself think that it might be possible he felt that way.” He pulls away to bring his face level with Sam’s. “How did you all know?”
“Fine!" Cas shouts, voice cracking. "I don’t know how to be human! I am not equipped to handle the...the sensations, especially not here and now. I cannot take the physical pain, or the fear. This weight will literally and figuratively overwhelm me any minute. I am nearly powerless, you're in danger because of it, and I don’t know
He has been here all along.
“You are an adult, Dean, you no longer participate in organized education.”
Cas moves when Dean nudges him, but can’t quite find the rhythm himself. He’s leaning too far side to side, like he’s bumping shoulders with invisible neighbors. Dean rearranges their feet to accommodate. “Okay, um...try to move more in the hips than the torso. Keep your center of gravity lower, that'll help wi-...yes, like that. And keep your chest level, don’t...arc so much.” Cas, ever the brilliant student, adjusts immediately. “Yeah, that’s it, good. Now really listen to the music, you’ll feel the rhythm. Like a heartbeat.”
“Dean Winchester. If it’re up to me, I would nnever. Choose. To be anywhere but by your side.”
Cas’s mouth twists. “I was beside you when that horrible witch blew the ceiling to pieces.” A grim satisfaction fills Dean’s stomach. Damn right, even the angel is gonna know how much witches suck. “Thankfully, I was able to block the worst of the falling stones. But then the floor collapsed beneath us as well.” He won't meet Dean’s eye, guilt swarming his features. “It was all I could do to shield your head and torso.”
He and Sam follow in the Impala. The ambulance clears the road for them, and Sam practically tailgates their bumper. They’ve been told the hospital is a mere sixteen minutes away. All the same, the silence in the space of the front seat feels heavy and oppressive, dragging on for miles. Neither dares reach for the radio.
Dean has had this whole thing backwards.
Cas heaves a sigh of relief. “Thank goodness you’re awake.” He gives Dean an exasperated look, like he chose an inconvenient moment to be knocked out. “You’ve been unconscious for nearly ten minutes.”
“Oh. Fuck.” Dean snatches his hand away from Cas’s ribs. He lifts the fabric from his forehead to check the gash. The blood is beginning to get tacky.
Then Dean feels a drop of something land on his chest. He sees that it’s blood, and realizes he hasn’t ascertained certain crucial information. “Wait, are you hurt?” He runs his free hand up Cas’s side, squinting through the dark to where the twin pillars of his arms are braced astride Dean’s ears.
than Sam does. They settle into a routine - Cas helps Dean shave, Sam picks up the takeout, Dean plays literal backseat driver while they teach Cas how to use the Impala's gearshift. But once the cast comes off two months later, leaving behind abstract swirling scars like a tattoo sleeve, Dean notices he’s surprisingly nervous. Now that he has two functioning hands and can’t reasonably ask the guy to stick around to button his shirt for him anymore, what if Cas decides to up and disappear?
“Um, yeah, Cas. I have. Most humans have.”
A hand smooths over his hair.
~~~~~
“So thass why my mouth...is not cooperatinn’.”
“Oh.” It might be his fever-addled brain, but Dean swears he can see a faint blush across Cas’s cheekbones.
“Oh but I do.” Empty Castiel is suddenly in Dean’s face. It takes more effort than he’d care to admit not to flinch. “You see, the best part of my day is playing with your little angel here. Just...like...this.”
Dean’s eyes close and Sam can practically see the horrible pictures projected onto the inside of his brother’s eyelids.
Dean whispers, “C’mon, man, don’t make me do this alone.”
There’s a smudge of mud on Cas’s temple, and a hole ripped through the knee of his scrubs. His sharp nose and high cheekbones are highlighted by the facial hair, carving shadows into the hollows of his face like he's been sculpted from marble. Honestly, it’s a good look on him. Dean’s never seen Cas in anything other than the Holy Tax Accountant getup, but this works. The rugged visage makes him look more like a hunter than anything else. The thought makes Dean’s chest tighten.
Dean hits the timer on his watch, and steps into the rift.
~~~~~
Its-his?-three heads all tilt slightly to the side, as if confused by the question.
Cas pulls away after a dizzying moment. The gentle smile on his face is small and blinding. “We're terrible dancers, Dean.”
“So you had quite a party last night, huh?” Sam asks, trying to sound casual.
He's a pro at manipulating his own dreams from the inside, especially once he knows that’s what they are. On any given Tuesday night when a Big Bad has him running through a dark forest, he can warp the fabric of his subconscious to more pleasant things. But the trouble with Hell dreams is that he can’t tell whether or not they’re real.
“No, I’m not buying whatever you’re selling today, thanks.” Dean keeps one hand cradled behind Cas’s head, pressing the slack face into his own shoulder, and rotates the other hand to look at his watch. Shit. Only five minutes remain. “And would you look at that! I’ve got a previous engagement, so if you don’t mind?”
The only problem is, it’s designed for humans.
“Shit.” Dean says, louder, cupping his hands around his mouth like a megaphone. “Shit!” He hears that same reverb of his own voice from one direction, and aims towards it. If cursing is what makes this work, the universe has a great sense of humor, he thinks.
The vehemence of the word surprises Dean even as it flies from his mouth. He attempts to dull the desperation in his voice and manages to croak, “Just...sit with me. For a minute.”
In all his centuries, he has never prayed to anyone but his Father. Today, he prays to Sam Winchester.
Eventually he has to drop his hand to the ground, weakness seeping through the rest of his limbs. Cas bites back something suspiciously like a sob at the loss of contact.
“Cas is not one of theirs.” Dean doesn’t mean to raise his voice.
Sam can’t. He’d dreamt about Eileen’s mother’s claddagh ring sitting on her dresser last night. Maybe not now, but someday.
“No!” Dean yells at the same time, dread swelling in his chest.
“Whoa!” Sam snags him around the shoulders before he can hit the ground. “Shit, Cas, are you okay?”
“Slow down, Dean,” Jack stops him. “We must talk first.”
Tonight Dean wakes on a rusty rack, chains around his wrists and ankles, with more blood than a Red Cross donation center coating his chest. Alastair is in his face, all rank breath and greasy hair and sickening sing-song.
my brain feelsso muddled, it’s infuriating. And the emotions, the pain, they’re all too much, it's like I'm...drowning.” Cas goes to bury his face in his hands, but Dean grabs his wrists to stop him from pulling at the stitches. Cas rips away. “I don’t want to be some tragic obligation of yours. I don't want your pity, or your help, I don’ want it! I don’t want
“I…” He trails off.
As quickly as it began, Cas’s shaking stops and the rock above Dean’s hand stops vibrating. Cas rolls his shoulders back a few millimeters and steadies his arms. Dean sees for the first time, maybe ever, there is pain in the lines of the angel’s face.
all because Dean asked him to rebel. And doesn’t it just make sense? Grim, twisted sense? That the man Cas seeks comfort from now may as well have dealt the blow that nearly killed him? It all began with Dean. He broke the first seal. Everything that follows will always be his fault, somehow.
“Dammit, Cas,
"Humans are miraculous. I know that firsthand now because of you. But you were born with a soul, and were raised into your humanity. Iss who you are at your core.” Cas gestures at his bloody form. “I’m as soulless as I was as an angel. Just some celesel...cel...
But if there’s anything Dean knows about his master, it’s that he fights dirty, especially when standing on his own home turf.
He considers Dean’s words.
Cas, the bastard, certainly seems angel-ed up enough to still be reading his mind. Either that, or Dean isn’t quite as smooth as he always claims to be. “Are you quite sure you’re qualified to be the instructor of such a skill, Dean?” He’s clearly fighting a smile.
“And then I’m gonna kiss him.” Dean has never said that part out loud, but he’s dreamed about it plenty. He realizes as the words take shape in his mouth that he wants this so desperately it aches. “And I’m gonna find us a little house with a big kitchen, and I’m gonna, I don’t know, build him a fucking treehouse. I’m gonna do whatever I can to make him happy, for as long as he’ll let me, because I love him. And there’s no life for me here without him. So will you help?”
Dean chuckles. “We’ve got plenty of time for that, don’t you worry.” He wraps an arm around Cas’s shoulder and begins to lead him out of the room to partake in a more family oriented celebration.
Dean rolls his eyes, then curses when it causes the throbbing in his temple to spike. “He’s just a wimp who doesn’t wanna catch whatever I’ve got. That doesn’t mean I need an angelic babysitter.”
“He told me...he loved me.”
Silence sets in, as it does with them. It’s comfortable, until it isn’t.
The moment Castiel’s hand connects with his shoulder instead, the world around them explodes in light.
“Yeah? Thanks for that.” With fury and distrust on his face, Dean rears back and stabs a dagger carved with sigils directly into Castiel’s heart.
Eventually, they pull away long enough for Dean to strip out of his jeans and set a concussion-check alarm for two hours. Then he slides under the covers behind Cas, sets a pillow under the injured ankle, and rolls Cas onto his side so the gash on his forehead isn’t rubbing against the sheets.
“Good find. Uh...does he have an on switch?” Benny mumbles, low enough for only Dean to hear. He turns to see Cas trailing behind them dutifully without a word. His face is extraordinarily blank. Dean wants to shake him by the shoulders and scream
It's been a few months since they said goodbye to Jack. That had been bittersweet, Dean remembers, driving back to the bunker with two fewer passengers than planned, despite the addition of Miracle dozing on Sam’s lap. He couldn’t deny the relief he felt knowing the Chuck ordeal was over, and that they were, for the first time since he was 4 years old, free. No more fate puppeteering their lives, no more shitty writers calling the shots. He had felt especially grateful looking over at Sam, whole and healthy, peacefully stroking the dog. But without the steady humming of energy from the backseat, Dean couldn’t help but feel like something was missing. Even now, he tried not to look at that thought too directly. He’d only glance at it peripherally, and then quickly away to other things. If he faced it head on...well, that just isn't an option.
. Man, they are smashed.
“Of course I have, man,” Dean reassures him. It’s a lie - he’s reduced dislocated shoulders plenty. Ankles, not so much, but he figures the technique is similar enough. No need to worry Cas any more than necessary.
It’s all Dean can do to keep his face blank as he nearly throws up in his mouth.
The cave feels Heaven-sent. The irony of that isn’t lost on Dean. He just knows that if he considers it for another nanosecond on this colossally weird day, he’ll run headfirst into a tree. So instead he eyes the thick copse of trees surrounding it, and imagines the visibility it offers on such high ground. It isn’t a perfect shelter, but it’ll do for the night. Granted, he thinks, looking over his shoulder to the vampire and angel at his flank, anything besides an open clearing would do.
Dean looks at the disoriented angel in his lap, and doesn’t have to reach for the lyrics at all. They come easy.
“Look, it’s all well and good that you’ve finally admitted to wanting something for the first time in your entire life,” Sam says. “And I’m proud of you for that. But I’ve never known you to give up on those you love before.” A glint appears in Dean’s eyes, like his soul rising to the surface when it hears the call of a challenge.
Dean never did learn how to love gently.
He presses a kiss to Cas’s temple, and the breathy sigh Cas releases against his neck hits Dean like a high. “We’re family now. Over my dead body am I ever letting you walk away from me again thinkin’ that I don’t care. Understand?” Cas’s eyes have never been bigger. In lieu of responding, he tugs on Dean’s shirt and slots their mouths together once more. It’s desperate this time, hungrier, and
Dean nods. “How did you land on top of me?”
Dean makes eye contact with the Angel.
Speaking of which.
Dean gulps.
With Sam away tracking down an ancient book that might help them get a leg up on Lucifer, Dean finally convinces Cas to join him on this hunt. It’s been six months since their stint in the hospital, and it's clear he's getting antsy. It’s a straightforward ghost situation, practically a milk run, and it should be simple enough to ease him into fighting without his powers.
“Are you kidding me? You’re, like, a billion years old. You’ve never even tapped your foot?”
He passes out.
“I’ve always loved your optimistic attitude.”
Dean is reaching for the last whiskey bottle before Sam can stop him. “Anyway, he’s probably being tortured in The Empty right now, because of me.”
“Shut up, Angel.” Dean tugs on Cas’s hand abruptly, bringing their chests crashing together and Cas exhaling against his neck. He can smell the bourbon on them both, woody and full of smoke. “Can’t believe your wacky professor vocab isn’t affected by booze.”
Dean feels shame blooming. Firstly at the truth of the statement, but then at the realization that he’s instilled his own messed up baggage into this divine being, now lying beside him in a by-the-hour motel.
He pockets the phone and picks at the dirt beneath his fingernails. Minutes later, a flutter of wings sounds behind him.
"Hey!" Cas glares. “If you were crammed into a body far too small for you, you wouldn’t have the greatest fine-motor control either.”
“I didn’t think…you never...” Sam trails off, unsure how to say it.
Cas had remained unconscious for most of the treacherous climb out of the ravine, draped over Dean’s shoulder. They should both be grateful for that, since his multiple bruised ribs had violently opposed the position as soon as he awoke. Once Dean had reached level ground, he’d shifted him into a bridal carry, but that’s not much better. It only means the wide gash on Cas’s hairline is gushing blood onto Dean’s shoulder, and his dislocated ankle is dangling tremulously with every step. The head injury has left him wobbly and confused in a way he’s never been before, which ratchets Dean’s worry up a few thousand notches.
“No, Dean. Please stay with me.” Cas bites out.
“No, I’ve been reliably informed I’m bad at that.” Cas blinks owlishly.
Dean’s voice is rough. It wobbles on the high notes, and his pitch swerves sideways on the low ones. A quick glance down to Cas’s warm gaze tells him that it doesn’t matter. He leaves the flannel pressed to Cas’s head and slides his hand down to rest lightly on his chest.
He nods, and they fall into formation behind him. On his count, they draw their blades in unison.
“So you can’t just fly in, grab him, and fly out?” Dean asks Jack again. He isn’t getting this.
Dean smooths a tentative hand over his hip. “Sorry, did that hurt? I didn’t mean to scare you.”
“Everybody leaves me, eventually. Especially when I don’t want ‘em to. I assumed it was only a matter of time before you did, too.”
Cas glares at him with those big concussed eyes, and still manages to look offended. “Of course not, Dean. You’re special, and you always have been.” He groans. “You are so annoying when you miscoms-
His eyes snap to Cas's face, which bears an unreadable expression. Dean is about to backtrack, or apologize, or say
Jack grins up at him, and the rush of affection that swirls in Dean’s chest threatens to send the tears flowing for the third time that day. He ruffles Jack’s hair instead, and gently pushes him down the hall.
Beside him, Sam is ripping off a piece of his jacket and tying it above Dean’s bicep. Castiel watches helplessly and curses his own forgetfulness of human first aid. A tourniquet, of course. Why hadn't he thought of such a simple treatment before?
Rosemary, sandalwood, Dead Sea brine, holy oil, yarrow root, and the blood of the summoner.
Cas shifts a bit, wincing at the pull of his ribs, and tilts his head against Dean’s stomach so he can look up at him more fully. “I’d like to hear that.”
Cas instantly moans in pain, shifts restlessly under Dean’s hands to escape the blade. “Oh, fuck, Cas, are you awake in there?” He squeezes Cas’s shoulder to try and rouse him, but gets no answer. A small whine escapes the angel’s throat as a rush of blood from the cut reminds Dean what he’s doing. “I know the angel blade stings like a bitch, I know. I’m sorry, Cas.”
But that doesn’t mean he has to indulge his brother’s self destructive behavior. Especially since the angels threatened them with life as prophesied vessels, Sam feels loath to let Dean out of his sight.
“Thank you, I get it!”
“Well,” Cas mutters, looking a bit embarrassed, “I can hardly be blamed for my eidetic memory, now can I?”
Cas nods his chin towards the laptop and bluetooth speaker warbling piano and brass. “Why do you think I’ve been so determined to consume Earth’s music? Humanity has created many remarkable things, but I must admit, Youtube and Spotify are currently at the top of my favorites list.”
The demon hisses in his ear. “There is no waking up from reality, boy. You’re mine, and no one is coming to save you.”
Dean’s heart sinks to somewhere in the vicinity of his kidneys.
Castiel reigns in his focus to the angry green eyes boring into his own. The Righteous Man has been saved. That was his mission, and that mission is complete.
They’ve stopped moving, Dean realizes. Cas’s fingers are moving through the hair at the nape of his neck. They are quite literally pressed cheek to cheek like a vintage romance film. A huff of laughter fills the negligible space between them, and Dean isn’t sure who it comes from. But the irony does hit his drunk brain: all his prayers literally begin with
Dean supposes he’s lucky to have woken up at all.
Dean’s eyes shine. With a deep breath and a single tear rolling down his cheek, he performs the noblest display of courage Castiel has ever seen.
“What happened before Cas died, Dean?”
“I’m fine, don’t...” Cas trails off as Dean’s hand reaches his shoulder and slides past a hot rush of blood to hit concrete.
Sam does glance over after a few minutes, and seems finally to drop into the world around him in real time. He does a double take between his passenger and the road.
“I was congratulating you. It’s been forty years to the day since my hellhounds dragged you kicking and screaming to my humble abode.” Dean clenches his jaw as Alastair gestures at the bloodstained dungeon. “And nearly a decade since you joined the staff. Do you know what that means?” Dean doesn’t trust himself to speak. “That means it’s basically your tenth birthday, little boy.”
“Absolutely not, Dean!” Sam yells. “You are not going to run a suicide mission that will cage you and Cas in The Empty, there’s gotta be another way.”
The bed creaks under Cas’s knees.
“Yeah, like you’ve never died on me.” Dean throws back at him. “And be honest with me Sam, I am not your ideal life partner. I know you love Eileen, and I know you’re thinking about a future with her. I know you’re dreaming about a white picket fence in the suburbs and a law practice and little Irish babies running around your front lawn. Don’t deny it.”
“Hey, Jack,” Dean mutters, his voice suddenly thick.
“Cas, you...you didn’t say anything.”
The resounding silence feels like answer enough.
They meet for the first time in Hell.
Dean must resign himself to the fact that this is his true self. He is hellspawn, created solely to cause pain and suffering to others. No matter who he tried to be on earth, the truth of the corruption at his core is obvious now. He deserves to be here in this frigid place for all eternity.
Dean may know how to calm a civilian experiencing their first supernatural encounter, or how to talk someone through shock, but he suddenly feels beyond out of his depth. Cas’s words have rattled the aphorisms right out of him. What the hell kind of pithy self help nonsense could Dean possibly offer him at this moment?
“Thanks,” he mumbles softly, not meeting the eyes he can feel boring into his own. He chuckles lightly to relieve some of the tension building between them, and gestures to his red clothing. “You couldn’t have wiped away the blood too?”
Cas closes his eyes, and light passes from his hand into the injury. Dean winces at the heat of it. Sometimes angel healing mojo wraps around him like a blanket, warm and comforting. Right now, it feels more like a static shock.
A sad silence settles over them.
But someone’s gotta try, and god knows Cas is too stubborn a motherfucker to man up and do it himself.
“Are you okay?” Sam asks him, absently. Cas can tell his mind isn’t really functioning beyond the
When he comes to, he is flat on his back. Whatever is beneath him feels solid enough to hold his weight, but certainly not tangible like the earth would be.
Instead, Dean rotates and lets his tired head sink to Cas’s shoulder, who freezes in surprise. After a charged beat, he tugs the coat smooth under Dean’s cheek and tentatively pillows his own head on Dean’s crown.
“I can't, you’re losing blood.”
Cas’s already fuzzy expression grows impossibly softer with a smile. It gives Dean the courage to say what comes next.
The angel appears directly in front of him and presses his fingers to the heads of the goons holding Sam down. They drop like sacks of potatoes, leaving Sam to catch himself against the sticky bar floor.
The Angel lands a slash across Alastair’s abdomen, who screams, but the victory is short-lived. The demon uses his own collapse to redirect a hidden blade upwards into the Angel’s core, and finishes with a ruthless twist. The Angel cries out, and the sound pierces Dean's skull.
“This is gonna work, y’know how I know?” Dean babbles at the unconscious Cas while he uncorks the vial around his neck. “Because I really fucking need it to.”
It’s a small angel charm hanging on a thin chain, the kind you’d find on a rack in a gas station. A royal blue gem sits in the center of the angel’s chest, heart shaped. It glitters in the morning sun, throwing tiny rainbows across his hand.
Cas angles his head into the crook of Dean's neck, nuzzling his nose against the pulse point there. "I am also, in your own words, a 'stubborn son-of-a-bitch.' I promise, you drop me and I
And Dean, well. Dean will be going in.
They stare at each other for a few beats as Dean’s lungs try to catch up with his pounding heart. He huffs out a breath and flops backward into the sweaty, tangled sheets. “Fuck.”
“Danced.”
The angel is crumpled on his side, face slack, trench coat wrinkled, and he is the most beautiful thing Dean has ever seen.
"Lucky for
Cas resumes moving his fingers across Dean’s scalp. As time passes, the pressure in his stomach eases and his eyelids droop. Despite the chill of the bathroom floor and the smell of his own stomach acid lingering, he could probably rest here for hours as long as Cas kept playing with his hair like that.
Then he grabs Sam’s arm and the world dissolves around them.
Dean grabs his face again. “Cas. Cas!” He pulls Cas into sitting, and tilts him sideways so he’s leaning against Dean’s torso. His body is entirely limp, and feels lighter than it should be. “Cas, this is the part where you wake up. We’ve gotta go!”
When they do finally reach the Impala, Dean has to pop open the passenger door with his foot. He lays Cas down with his head nearly under the steering wheel. Then he strips off his own jacket and flannel, the shirt underneath darkened with sweat. He pillows Cas’s injured ankle on the rolled up jacket to keep it from moving on the drive. Once he’s settled in the driver’s seat, he props Cas’s head on his right thigh and folds the flannel against the gash above his eyebrow. The sheet of red down his cheekbone makes him look positively ghoulish.
A sad beat passes. “Everybody leaves me, Sammy.”
An ugly defensive part of his heart makes him say “And if he doesn’t like it, he can take back that grace, power up, and go poof.”
Sam barely has time to think,
of it!”
When he doesn’t continue, Dean squints at him. “But?”
Today, Alastair wears a gaunt, stubbled face with yellowing teeth. Here in Hell where the demon wields such power, his form changes daily. Sometimes mid sentence. Only inches from Dean’s nose, today’s horror show twitches with mercurial energy, features morphing from one disturbing face to another. Dean stares unblinking at the one trademark that remains unchanged - the pitch black stygian eyes.
The hand stops moving. “Am I hurting you?”
If there’s anything that might prompt Castiel to move faster, it’s the head of that demon rolling back towards his decapitated body.
Next he reaches for the hem of Cas’s shirt, and helps him remove it slowly so they can get at his ribs. Dean expects the swath of bruising, the shallow breathing, the way Cas is holding his torso stiffly for fear of aggravating the injuries.
“Damn.” Dean whistles. “You’re a lot stronger than I gave you credit for.”
“Dean,” Cas looks confused, and his eyes are a little glassy. He sways a bit like he’s dizzy, and Dean holds him tighter. “What...what happened?”
Dean closes the distance and then they’re kissing, sweet and chaste. He moves his lips against Cas’s and tastes blood at the corner of his mouth. Dean presses in deeper, like he can say what he needs to say without any talking at all. He’s always been better at gesture than conversation.
Dean rolls his eyes so hard Sam thinks he might pass out, but he doesn’t object. They trudge to the Impala in silence.
okay.” Cas declares fiercely, eyes flashing wild and panicked. “You are losing blood at a dangerous pace, and I’m clearly not enough of an angel anymore to withstand this weight for much longer.”
and the demon’s head goes flying across the room.
“This ain’t Heaven, Angel.”
The confrontation by the riverbank that afternoon left everyone a bit tense. Hardly a word has been spoken in the hours they’ve been walking since. The only verbal communication exchanged was an hour ago, when Cas shouted a warning for Dean to duck. He did, just in time to feel a claw swipe past where his ear had been a moment earlier. They handled the werewolves quickly, sliding into their joint fighting style with ease. Back to back. On speaking terms or not, Dean and Cas know how to move as one on the battlefield.
Then Sam begins spending more nights at Eileen’s. He leaves the dog with Dean, for which Dean is quietly grateful. If Sam sees the vaguely glassy look in Dean’s eyes when he says goodbye for the night, he doesn’t mention it.
But it’s still too quiet.
But now, they’re buried.
His grimace tells Dean all he needs to know about the musical merits of those songs.
As soon as the words are out of his mouth, Dean wants to swallow them back down. A deep sadness rises in Cas’s face, along with a shade of embarrassment.
That brings Dean up short. “Stop helping you?”
"For what it's worth, I would listen to you on repeat if I could. Your prayers are far more inspiring to me than any podcast Sam has ever sent my way."
Empty Castiel waves a hand absentmindedly, and Cas nearly arches out of Dean’s grasp. He screams, so loud the echoes ring through the space, and Dean has to scrabble at the shaking body to keep him from rolling away.
Dean brings his lips to Cas’s pulse point, breath puffing against the shell of his ear.
Dean bristles. “Is that a challenge?”
“So we take out his grace.”
“Alright,” Dean mutters, and tunes his ears into the song beginning to play. A finger-plucked banjo starts to arpeggio some basic chords, followed by a few piano riffs. The tempo is nice and easy, with a swing of syncopation. The sound quality is so crackly, Dean is sure if he turns to look at the speaker it will have transformed into a hand-cranked radio.
But then it’s gone. Cas pulls his hand away from the vial, and tilts his chin upward so they’re face to face. His eyes are wide, and his lip trembles.
Dean squints at his brother, waiting for an explosive response that doesn’t come.
“Yup.”
“I'm washable. Don't worry about it. Besides, I owe you one, or a hundred.” He waves a hand in front of Cas’s eyes and they barely track his movement. “We gotta stitch up your noggin.” The expression Cas pulls is pure middle schooler being handed a chore list, and Dean wonders if he picked it up from Sam.
“Okay, shh...” Dean tilts his face down just so, and his lips brush Cas’s temple. His brain shrieks, tells him to pull back, step away,
He bursts like a dam.
Sam pulls on his boots. “Okay, but you’re not going alone.”
So no, he doesn’t need to see his own back to understand Sam’s pitying look. He could feel the contour of the doctor's hands as he worked. He already knows that with the blood wiped away and the stitches knotted, he now has two massive rips arching from the skin of his shoulder blades down to the back of his waist.
Cas looks much the same as the last time they saw each other. Dark hair sticking up in all directions, trench coat wrinkled, blue tie facing the wrong direction. The purple circles under his eyes are a little more pronounced, but otherwise, he looks comfortingly familiar.
“Dean. That is a highly unlikely sequence of events. Either my strength will fail and we’ll both be crushed, or you’ll bleed out long before he reaches us.”
“What was that?” Dean demands.
A hard expression drops over Dean’s features, wiping the twinkle of hope from his eyes. “But since when do we get what we want, right?”
“Good girl,” he says, staring at the clock on the wall. The second hand ticks past the 12, once, twice, three times…
“Cas!”
Dean scans the parking lot before moving inside, since they both look like extras in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and he'd prefer not to draw attention to it. Their motel room is painted an ugly lime green that had nearly triggered Dean’s gag reflex upon first glance, but it has decent enough water pressure and is relatively clean. Or it will be until he and Sam inevitably stain it with the gruesome vampire blood dripping from their bodies.
. With greying temples and scars where his wings used to be, Cas is sticking around this time. Once and for all. Even that night with Lisa, that Billie Holiday dance, Dean had only wished it wouldn’t end because he was afraid of what he would become when it inevitably did.
Cas squeezes their tangled fingers lying across his chest. “Wise words.”
A scream forces its way between his clenched teeth as his ribs and pelvis and skull bend under the weight of the collapsed building. Blood seeps from the gouges along his back, and the sheer pressure threatens to flatten him like an ant. He hangs onto whatever strength kept him alive this long to keep his body intact now, if only to protect Dean’s. Cas notices in a detached way that he is roaring directly into Dean’s ear, which would be unpleasant for the hunter were he awake. However, as he is currently unconscious and Castiel has never experienced such exquisite pain in his millenia of existence, he figures Dean would understand.
gracelessly. It hits him in the gut again that Cas is a real boy now. Drunk, safe, human, and
Dean blushes. "Yeah, that sounds like me. Sorry, it's probably distracting to have me yelling inside your head when you're trying to gank some monster."
“Dude, not helping!” Sam hollers back.
“Whoa!” Dean calls out, unsure what’s happening. He instinctively reaches to help steady the concrete Cas is supporting (as if his single human hand could make a goddamn difference). Through that contact, he feels a tremor in the stone. Tiny bits of rubble plink down around their heads. Cas’s elbows quake and a quiet keen escapes his throat. “Hey, Cas, talk to me, what’s happening?”
An inexplicable laugh bursts from Castiel’s chest. "You caught me." He whispers to the quiet space between them.
“Yeah?” Dean asks. “Tell me again. Keep talking.”
“It’s time for you to officially join us. You’ve done the legwork,” he gestures to the rack, “and now all that’s left is to sign the contract. One more touch from me and you get your very own black eyes, along with the welcome packet and the campus map.”
did this to the creature once powerful enough to rescue him from Hell. There cannot possibly be a God running things around here if He lets this kind of bullshit fly.
“I’m so sorry, Cas, it was the only way we could think to get you out of there, and I-I just couldn’t live with myself knowing you were there because of me, so-”
Sam sits back and watches his brother work.
Jack smiles broadly, and nods.
“Dean, are you...are you trying to tell me this was a surprise?”
“Have you...done th’ss before?” Cas bites out between his teeth.
This means he’ll have scars in the shape of wings. The irony does not escape him.
Castiel instantly feels a modicum of pain in his chest. In a nanosecond, he sends his grace sweeping through the vessel’s torso to examine the superficial injuries. None of Dean’s bullets have pierced his true self, and the body’s damage should hardly register to him.
Could it be...disappointment? Grief, even? Castiel had heard tell of human emotion manifesting as physical pain, but had never experienced it for himself. So why now? He supposes a small part of him had expected Dean to remember their introduction. It was a rather dramatic affair, after all, and not one Castiel expects he’ll forget anytime soon. It does make sense for the human psyche to repress traumatic events of cosmic interference, for the simple purpose of maintaining sanity. But he did not anticipate Dean’s forgetting would cause him pain. Strange.
Hang on.
Dean pulls back enough just to whisper against Cas’s lips, their foreheads touching and their breaths mingling. “Let me make this crystal clear. I want you here, Cas. All the time. And if Heaven doesn’t, then that’s their loss, but
didn’t you at least let me know you were alright before taking off? This place is a goddamn nightmare already, and you vanishing like that scared the shit out of me. It’s been...well, I can’t tell time here, but it’s definitely been months. You heard me, every single night, you knew what I was thinking. And you just...why?”
The hope that has been swelling like a balloon in Dean’s chest pops when Jack points out this rather significant caveat.
“Don’t count.”
“Our favorite was
Cas meets his steady gaze, and all jocular tone drops from his voice. “I stand corrected. They are
Dean pulls the angel blade from his inside coat pocket.
What’s done is done.
They break apart after what feels like a lifetime.
Cas rasps, “He passed out just a few minutes ago.”
Sam gives him a sad smile, and briefly considers lying. Instead he says kindly, “We all knew.”
“If you ever, and I do mean
No, it wouldn’t, Dean thinks. Holding anyone else in his arms while three sheets to the wind and severely touch-starved would just feel like feeding some careless physical urge. It wouldn’t feel like...
Cas looks so miserable when he finally admits, “My humanity. Dean, I feel so lost. I cannot stand to be this weak, this...pathetic without my grace. My purpose has been forced outta me and now I’m an empty shell, a useless
Because there's something wrong.
Dean can’t remember a single instance when Alastair’s slimy voice hasn’t made his skin crawl. The sickening sing-song sound slithers into his head and rattles there like a snake. He's been training and torturing under this demon for years, but even as Dean drags a rusty scalpel through the tattered mess of a soul on his rack, he still feels on edge about Alastair observing from behind. Frankly, he’s expecting a blow to the back of the head at any moment. His master is, after all, quick to criticize technique, and despite his petrifying hushed timbre, his preferred method of correction is not one of gentle verbal reminders.
Months after the Great Collapsing Witch Warehouse, there is still no sign of Cas’s grace returning to him. It’s an adjustment.
A while later, Dean’s breathing calms down a bit. He keeps his head pressed against Sam’s shoulder, but tilts his chin so he can look at the ‘Castiel’ carving. Sam rubs a hand up and down his back a bit.
~~~~~
“Aw, man, I just cleaned you up, c’mon...” Dean grabs another towel and wipes at the hand.
“I heard your prayer." Cas’s lips twist in amusement. "On this particular evening, it went something like, and I’m paraphrasing, ‘You’d better not be dead, you son of a bitch, or I swear I will kill you myself.’" He looks like he's holding in laughter.
Dean tries not to think about Hell most days. He and Sam have plenty else to worry about. Vamps, werewolves, obscure mythological creatures. A recent salt and burn gone wrong had them running from the cops for a few days, and that kind of distraction doesn’t even scratch the surface of the angels and demons on their tail.
And the low comforting hum is back.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence, kid.”
“Alright, if it’s so easy, Fred Astaire, show me what you got.”
“Thank Jack you’re here.”
It feels wrong to stand this far apart, on either ends of the cave. Their invisible tether usually has less slack, leaving them floating well within one another’s personal space no matter the circumstances. But ever since the river, Dean feels like if he takes a step closer, something between them will shatter. The tension in the air is so thick, a meat cleaver wouldn’t cut it. Dean reckons he’d need an industrial strength chainsaw to even make a dent.
“Alright,” Dean says, returning to his co-pilots. “You two head inside and get some rest. It’s my turn to keep watch.”
Sam’s been waiting for this.
Cas raises his hands in surrender and steps back to lean against the wall, marking the end of the conversation. Dean immediately steps forward to compensate, itching to close the space entirely.
Dean holds Cas tighter in his arms.
It’s unclear whether Cas is actively avoiding Dean’s attention, or if he’s just oblivious enough to not notice. Another glaring irony for Dean to ignore: Castiel, Olympic-caliber Starer of the Lord, won't make eye contact with him. Benny, however, catches Dean’s elbow when he stumbles and quirks a brow his way.
Sam covers his mouth with a hand. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to, that just-” He sighs. “It was just so obvious.” Dean kept looking at him expectantly. “He pulled you out of hell. He rebelled against his superiors. An angel believed in you enough to turn his back on heaven, Dean, time and time again. And things have been tough between you, sure, but even when you were fighting, beating each other bloody or sassing each other over some hunt or spell, you bickered like an old married couple. Angels weren't programmed to do stuff like that, but he did, for you. Of course I knew.”
And then the pressure is gone. Light bursts into his field of view and he gasps loudly, ribs expanding once more.
Dean glares at the phone screen and drops his forehead to the coolness of the plastic toilet seat. Sam sympathy-texting him from the adjacent motel room is not nearly as comforting as either would like it to be. Dean has been knocked out of commission by a nasty stomach bug, and his brother sheepishly insisted on getting his own room to avoid contagion. He musters up the energy in his shaking fingers to type out a snarky reply.
Dean swings a mean right hook and knocks the Empty Alastair on his ass. He slides an arm under Cas’s knees and gets to his feet, the vial of grace now visibly dangling from his neck.
“That’s it?” Cas pulls back just enough to look at Dean dubiously. Their faces are close, closer than usual, and Dean self-consciously worries his lower lip. “That doesn’t sound complicated.”
He heads to the door, opening it quickly and rushing down the hall. Mira barks and follows Jack, trotting at his heels like it’s playtime.
Cas tags along from motel to motel. He dresses in the brother’s hand-me-downs, picks at diner sandwiches, and researches things that go bump in the night with the same unsettling focus that used to set a room alight with crackling energy. It takes a while to find the sea legs of their new trio, but with Dean’s arm out of commission, it’s nice to have an extra set of hands around. The first time Cas digs the remote control from under Sam’s sleeping form and changes the channel to
They spend many grueling hours in the hospital; falsifying insurance forms, pacing in waiting rooms, agonizing over the worst possible outcome while Dean is in surgery. Cas has to sit through seventy four truly hellish stitches for the twin gouges down his back. Such a small but persistent pain, clearly designed to induce insanity in the patient, could only have been invented by a demon. Castiel is sure of it.
Cas squeezes his eyes shut and mumbles, “I don’t like decaf, Dean. It...shouldn’ be ‘llowed.”
Dean checks his watch and curses. Ten minutes until the rift closes. He grabs the bandage from his pocket and quickly covers the oozing slice in Cas’s neck. There’s no light anymore, only normal, seeping, human blood. Jack said being human would wake him up in this realm, but Dean gets no reaction from the still unconscious Cas. He’s limp even as Dean presses on the cut harder, which ratchets up his anxiety a few thousand notches.
Cas shuts his eyes and watches the red and blue lights flash behind his lids. His mind inexplicably wanders towards Heaven. “Yes. I suppose I was.”
Sam’s eyes widen. “Can we even do that?”
It takes Cas a moment to realize he’s not being attacked, but rather, embraced. Dean feels the instant he figures it out, because his hands set firmly against Dean’s spine and he hums against Dean’s ear. Dean clings harder, reveling in the slide of Cas’s palm up the nape of his neck. “I know.”
Dean blows out slowly, tries to soothe the rush of hysteria coursing through his veins. The clamminess of his skin is likely part shock and part blood loss. He focuses on Cas’s warmth where their legs lie tangled, his hot breath against Dean’s lips. He grounds himself in their closeness. It feels good to not be stuck down here alone. Comforting, even. Crush injuries notwithstanding, that is.
“Shut your fanged mouth,” Dean had hissed in return. From the look on Benny’s face, that had been answer enough. Now that they’re all together and Dean can’t seem to pull his focus away from said angel, Benny’s knowing glance feels sharp enough to sting.
Not that he’d ever admit out loud that he enjoyed the Donna Summer phase. Some things are too embarrassing to put to words.
Cas displays his first emotion since the riverbank and glares at Benny with righteous fury, and a healthy twist of Sam's patented bitchface.
“If there were ever an appropriate time, buddy.”
Sam will be sitting by the spell bowl, tending the ingredients; replenishing burnt herbs and flowers as they disintegrate. Jack will be standing behind the huge Enochian sigil painted in blood on the floor, using a spark of his own remaining angel grace to hold the rift open.
“Hey, Jack,” he starts. “It’s Dean. Winchester. Obviously, um...you got your ears on? I hope you can hear me. I really need you to hear me. And I hope you’re...well, I hope you’re safe, and happy, wherever you are. God knows you deserve it. Or, shit,
Jack had told him that much like all other realms but Earth, The Empty’s appearance is influenced by how you anticipate it. Dean couldn’t really grasp the vastness of the nothing that awaited earlier. So, that’s all that surrounds him now.
“Are you sure about that?” Alastair lands a kick to Dean’s shin, shattering the bone. He can barely gather enough breath to scream. “So what, you’re dreaming? I don’t think dreams are supposed to hurt this much.” One more well placed slice has Dean gargling his own blood. “You never got out, boy. You’ve been here with me all along.”
can jus' get rid of me like Heav’n did.”
The thing has three massive heads, each a different configuration of eyes and horns, like mystical animals Dean cannot place. Every iota of the thing glows brighter than anything in Hell. And lastly, Dean sees two, four,
“But Cas has gotta be your exception.” Dean whispers fiercely. “We are this close to a chick flick happy ending, but none of it means a damn thing without him by my side.”
"It's called a hug, moron."
“Did he say why?” Dean asked, frustration boiling under his skin.
Look at me." Cas tilts his head down, forcing eye contact. “Breathe. Your arm is still attached. It’s broken, and crushed beneath the stone. You’re likely losing blood, but I can sense that it’s still there and still connected to the rest of you. I promise.”
He's distracted by another rush of nausea, so he doesn’t notice Cas shifting nervously and refusing to meet his eye. “It’s...possible I could ease the symptoms.”
It’s too quiet in the bunker.
Dean sighs gratefully and dry swallows a few pills, ignoring the water until Sam glares at him pointedly. He rolls his eyes, winces again, and downs it all. Sam sits in the chair opposite Dean.
Alastair and the Angel battle it out while Dean watches, too shocked to move. He realizes with a start that he isn’t even sure who he’s rooting for in this fight. The Angel may be heaven sent, but Dean doesn’t want to get any closer to it than he has to. The thing radiates powerful energy, makes the stale air in the room vibrate with electricity. It hums, shaking grime and blood from the stone walls. He knows with unearned certainty that this creature could blow him to pieces with a mere thought, and he is terrified.
Dean trips.
But it is too
The non-sequitur bumps worry directly into first place. Dean walks faster.
He scoops an arm under Cas’s knees and another behind his back. The lift and move to the bed only takes a few seconds, but Cas's head is rolling on his neck by the time Dean is propping him against the headboard. A blue-eyed bobblehead, dizzy with the altitude change. His wide eyes aren’t focusing, and Dean wonders what would actually pop up if he Googled treatment options for concussed former angels. Probably some sports medicine blog about that L.A. football team.
Any semblance of comfort earned vanishes once Dean has to pick Cas up again to get him inside their motel room. He’s shaking in pain by the time Dean sets him down in the chair beside the dinette table. His hands float shakily over his ribs, wanting to press into where it hurts but knowing it would only make it worse. Dean takes one of those hands briefly to give him something to ground himself to, and Cas squeezes so hard Dean winces.
It’s still too quiet, but they’re getting closer.
Dean’s heart is trying to kill him. It pounds against the inside of his sternum with a vengeance, like it wants to jump straight out of his chest and fall to the ground at Cas’s feet. He’s damn certain Cas can feel it in the pulse of their joined hands, or where they’re connected from mid-thigh to chest. Dean focuses instead on maintaining his frame, guiding them in a slow circle. Cas can’t seem to take his cues, though, and their knees bump together. It’s strange, after so many years of fighting back to back, moving in sync on the battlefield, that Dean can barely shepherd him in what could only be qualified as a geriatric shuffle. It feels like they should just fit together by now, but it’s not that easy.
