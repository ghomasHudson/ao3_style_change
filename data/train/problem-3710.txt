“Just the usual. He gets up at seven o’clock and gets our daughter ready for school. Our driver takes him to the school to drop her off and brings him back.”
Castiel guided Dean to sit down. “Shut up, it’s been five years. I can be sappy.” He pulled his shirt off over his head and tossed it aside.
Dean’s eyes widened with realization. “Oh...Oh!” He swallowed. When did it get so hot in here? “Should I keep going?”
Castiel thinks for a moment. “I guess I never really considered it before now. I’ve never been interested in hook-ups or anything like that, and I’ve never been in a serious relationship, so I guess I wouldn’t have known until now. Huh. I learned something new about myself.”
Dean came home from work one evening and laid down on the couch, curling up slightly. He had been thinking about Castiel all day. He knew how he felt about the situation, and it scared him.
Dean finds himself nearly drooling at the sight of Cas. He’s all lean muscle with smooth, tan skin and sharp hipbones. If the sight didn’t paralyze him, he would have his hands all over him.
“Yeah, but your annoyed look is too funny to pass up.” Luke grinned and pinched Castiel’s ass, making the omega yelp and slap his hand.
He takes one more survey of the wings before slowly reaching out to touch them. But right as he’s about to sink his fingers into the messy plumage, a thought stops him. “This isn’t going to burn my eyes out or anything, right?”
Castiel hopes he doesn’t have to walk into Meg’s apartment but his hopes are dashed. Meg invites him up so up he goes. The building is much smaller than the one Gabriel lives in. The apartments are quaint and small with just enough room for the two people living there.
“I can, because I love you. You’re right, you’re an asshole for doing it, but I do understand why. Truthfully, I need some space of my own as well. You’re also right about us not spending a single day apart since we got together. When we argue, we’re stuck together. It forces us to work it out quickly, but it can be tiring. Maybe you should go see Sam and Bobby for a few days. That might be nice. I’ll be fine on my own.”
Castiel hears Dean’s voice, but he doesn’t have the courage to face him. He cries harder, pulling on his own hair. He feels hands on his own, untangling his fingers from his hair. He grabs the hands and holds them tightly instead of pulling his hair. The voices continue to shout at him. “Please! Leave me alone! Shut up!”
“I’m still not filled in. Tell me: why did you kiss Dean last night? He kissed you back and seemed very okay with it.” Meg crosses her arms as she sits down on the edge of her bed.
Castiel sighs and gets in, sitting in the passenger seat. He looks around the interior of the car. “It’s nice. It’s really well-kept.”
Castiel smiles softly and nods. He walks back to his bedroom and leaves the door open while he changes quickly into a soft t-shirt and pajama pants. He fluffs up his second pillow and waits for Dean.
The pair quickly scuttled up the stairs, locking Castiel’s bedroom door behind them. Dean didn’t have time to mention how this was the first time he had seen Castiel’s room, because the omega was on him in a flash.
“Sure. There’s a bunch of classics.” He sticks his hands in his pocket. “I’m going to go back to my room for the night and look over my syllabi. See you in the morning, Dean.”
Castiel wiped his eyes and sighed. He blinked and squinted slightly. “You said you got sick right after the honeymoon. That’s really fast for morning sickness, only a few days?”
Michael scowled a little at that. “I don’t know. I don’t like the idea of someone else having sex with him every month.”
“I waited five years, wishing and dreaming that I could have you. It’s finally here and I want it now.” Castiel kissed Dean again.
Castiel nodded a bit. “I was really scared. I had no idea where you were, and I thought we were over. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep. I cried for most of the night. I started to wonder if you drove back to Sioux Falls, but you left all of your things behind, so I wasn’t even sure about that. I was about to text Charlie when you got home. I was going to have her call you to make sure you were okay. I hoped that you would answer her if not me.”
Dean nodded and walked back towards the crowd to find Michael. He saw where he had gone, so he simply weaved through a few people before spotting him. Before he could even speak, Michael had an arm around his waist and was introducing him to someone.
Castiel frowned, looking at Dean, then back at Jody. He looked visibly anxious as he returned to his office.
“Quit thinking with your dick. He’s Dean’s little brother, not a threat to your fragile masculinity.”
Castiel sighs. “I’m sorry. It just makes me nervous. I want to do more, I promise I do, I’m just...I don’t know. I can’t explain it.”
Dean grabbed Castiel’s shoulders, watching him with wide eyes as he pushed in. Castiel was big, and everything felt glorious. Castiel was slow and gentle, making the entire ordeal so much sweeter. It was such a relief. Finally, they were here. They were connected and free.
After two episodes of Masterchef, Castiel’s mother calls him downstairs for a movie. Castiel tells Dean goodbye and joins his parents in the living room.
When Michael returned that night, Dean was still in his room. He moved over to Michael’s room and didn’t mention what he and Castiel had spent the day doing. Instead, they planned a trip for Sam to come visit for a couple of days the following week. Dean thought they would be booking a first-class ticket, like he got, but Michael insisted that they send the private jet instead, which he didn’t send for Dean to prevent further culture shock.
When Dean returned downstairs, he could hear Sam going rapid-fire with questions for Cas. He turned the corner and stepped in to save the other omega.
Michael picked up his phone. “I think Gabriel gave me his cold. I’m going to take some cold medicine and go in an hour late. I just need to call my assistant and let him know that I’ll be late.”
The ceremony wasn’t very long, but long enough that Dean’s feet hurt in his shoes. They were custom, but not broken in, so some of the leather hugged the widest part of his foot. He knew he’d have blisters tonight.
Castiel huffed and took it upon himself to make sure Dean was alright. When he did, he realized this heat would be trickier than he thought. He had heard of PCOS before, but didn’t know enough about it or how severe Dean’s case was.
After a few minutes of deep breaths and rehearsing in his head, Castiel feels ready. He’s still anxious but his heart isn’t pounding as hard and he feels okay. He drives out of the parking lot and back to the house, staring up at it like a kid staring up at the dentist’s office in terror.
Once everyone has left, Castiel walks to the front of the classroom and stops at the desk Dr. Adler is sitting at. “Yes?”
Dean dragged his hand over his face. After a long heat, the feeling of slick just starting to leak was a very unwelcome surprise. This was inappropriate to say the least. His future husband was at work and here he was, leaking over the scent of his soon-to-be brother-in-law’s omega. With an annoyed sigh, Dean stripped his pants off and walked to the bed. He laid back and pulled his shirt up to his chest, running his hand down his stomach. God, how he wished Castiel’s miracle fingers were here right now.
“No. Emotional abuse is just as bad as physical abuse. Both tear you down and take away control. I’m glad he hasn’t hurt you physically, but you can’t excuse his behavior that way.”
Upstairs, there were a few bedrooms. Two of them looked lived in. The first looked like a child’s bedroom. There were toys and books scattered around, and the sheets were pulled off the twin sized bed.
Castiel thought for a moment. “Let me take you to this cute diner. It’s very local and the burgers and milkshakes are delicious.”
“Thanks.” Dean slipped the pants on and was surprised at how comfortable they were. He never minded silk (not that he ever owned it) but he hadn’t ever imagined wearing it like this until now. Dean followed Michael to the bed and climbed in beside him. The bed was still just as luxuriously soft. When Dean laid down, he shifted a bit in discomfort at a knot in his back. He rolled his shoulders a couple of times to no avail.
Dean blinked and grinned, his hand moving slowly up and down Cas’s shaft. A laugh rumbled softly in his chest.
Dean stared blankly for a moment. “Sam’s in law school now. He graduated with a 4.0 from undergrad. Claire goes to kindergarten at this really fancy private school. She likes it a lot.”
“I don’t think you’re insane. I have a theory. Sometimes ghosts get in people’s heads like that. I’m thinking our poltergeist is doing this to you. It may not be completely gone. There’s things we can do to get rid of it, and maybe that will make the voices stop.”
“That’s good.” Michael hummed and stretched. His back tended to hurt after spending all day at a desk. “Would it be okay if you stopped your suppressants tomorrow?”
Dean’s breath came in gasps as he grew closer. His eyes were locked on Castiel, and he was barely able to blink. There was a deep need to see the other omega and feel their connection burn between them in a glorious flame.
Dean’s eyes were watering, and all he could do was nod. “Okay. I guess I’ll see you here Monday. Same time.”
They leave the library together, bumping shoulders a few times from how close they are. Castiel boards his bike and waits for Dean to get on his own, which he had purchased recently. They bike back to the house together and return to their rooms briefly to put away their bikes.
“It’s not like I could just leave. I have nowhere to go, and I never want to end up back on the streets. He won’t divorce me because of his family, so if we were to split, I’d have to be the one to leave. It’s too much to do just to get out and stay alive. I can put up with Luke. I have a roof over my head, a few good friends, three meals a day, and I never have to worry about finances ever again. The only downside is an asshole husband. I’ll take that deal as long as it’s there.”
“Mmm, you do too.” Castiel sank down all the way and hummed, taking a minute to adjust. “This is perfect.” He lifted himself up and dropped back down, a growl rising from his chest.
“I’ll dress myself.” Castiel reached out and took the clothes, putting them on slowly. He rubbed his face. “I have to text my boss.”
For a few minutes, they both sit there and hold each other. The silence doesn’t feel awkward or tense. It’s a calming blanket that makes both of them feel safe and secure. Once they both start to feel chills from sitting there, still naked, they get up to shower. Dean puts the gun back under his pillow and follows Castiel to the bathroom. They shower together in silence, taking turns bathing one another. It’s incredibly intimate, more so than they thought it would be.
“Is it okay if I visit Jack every once in a while? It’s not safe to transport him back and forth, so I can just come to you. Is that okay?”
Castiel sniffs and starts crying even harder. All the fear comes bubbling to the surface and he hangs on to Dean for dear life to keep from going under. “T-The voices…”
“So you sign yourself up with all of this information. You have to include pictures, a personality summary, things you like and dislike, and your city of residence. I think they try to get people in the same city. I had a bunch of offers when I put my profile up. You can’t see the other person’s picture or name, just the information they put down about their looks and personality. It’s a protection thing. A lot of the people on there are super high-profile, like Michael is. To keep the element of choice, you pick the offer you like the most. Chicago was the closest one I got. The others were all over the place. Atlanta, Austin, New York, Boston…you get the idea.”
There was a pause. The last time Castiel said those three words, he disappeared. This time was different. This time, when Dean looked at Castiel, he knew he would get to have him forever.
“Oh, Castiel, you’ve even kept your rebellious spirit. You were an obedient soldier for eons, but you always had this little bit of disobedience within you. When you finally embraced it and fought back, we did what we had to. This was a lesson.”
Dean swallows, taking in the question and trying to think it through. “B-Both.” His face goes bright red as he admits it. In Cas’s room, he feels safe. He’s never felt this safe around anyone before.
“My dad. She was his, and she was his dad’s before him. I had to fix her up a little after I bought her off my dad, but now she’s in great shape.” Dean came up to a red light. “Straight?”
Castiel stripped out of the rest of his clothes, tossing them all to the hamper. He reached into the bedside table and grabbed a bottle of lube. “It’s going to be hard during your classes on Monday. You’re going to feel me and remember what we did. Maybe I’ll have to cage you so you don’t get hard in class, hm?”
Castiel nodded and closed his eyes. He relaxed when Dean started brushing his fingers through his hair, gently scratching his scalp. Within minutes, he was asleep.
By the time the car pulled up to take Dean to the school and subsequently, the park, he was a wreck. He composed himself with a few deep breaths before walking through the front door for what was hopefully the last time. He got into the car and tapped his fingers on his thigh as the driver took him to the school. Dean rolled down his window in the carpool line and watched for Claire, smiling when he saw her being walked to the car. He got out of the car to help her into her carseat, thanked the teacher, and got back in.
There was a moment of silence before Castiel spoke. “Jimmy, he ran away after I was kicked out. Anna saw him again recently, and he’s not doing well. He’s using drugs. She tried to send him to rehab, but he left. She doesn’t know where he is anymore, but she’s been texting him, so we might be able to get a phone number.”
They went slow, despite how desperate they were. Everything felt bigger and more intense the longer Castiel slowly rolled against Dean’s hips. Dean’s world felt smaller and smaller, reduced down to only to himself and Cas.
He followed Michael upstairs and helped him unpack most of their stuff. They didn’t pack super heavy, so it didn’t take long.
“Good. Then lay down here.” Castiel guided Dean to the bench and bent him over it. He fastened the straps around Dean’s waist, chest, and thighs. He skipped the ones that bound Dean’s arms to the sides of his body, remembering that Dean had a poor reaction to being bound like that before. Instead, he took a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket, the ones he had kept there just in case, and handcuffed Dean’s hands behind his back.
“I do hope that you get to live as open as me. Take your time in doing so, please. I want you to be safe.”
A few hours later, with a lunch break at noon, the bushes are all trimmed and the lawn is looking much nicer. The weeds are gone, and the grass is mowed perfectly. There’s still some work to be done, but the hardest parts are over.
Castiel nods and looks down. Part of him knows that this isn’t something that will just suddenly go away. It certainly doesn’t feel like that. Maybe he’ll learn to deal with it and it’ll just be his new normal.
Dean laid out his letters and hummed. He spelled out ‘mesquite’. “Alright, so that puts the Q on the double letter, so 29 points, but as you can see, the M is on the triple word tile, so that’s…”
Castiel sighed. “If we do end up looking for this Nephilim, you have to promise not to be an ass the whole time.”
Dean started to wonder where Castiel was when they moved to another room to sit down for dinner. He spotted him with Luke once everyone was seated.
After dinner, Dean took Claire upstairs to get her bathed and ready for bed. The bathtub in the bathroom attached to this bedroom was big and perfect for bathing Claire. Dean had packed a few bath toys from Chicago, so he filled the tub with a few rubber ducks and little boats.
No. No way. Castiel barely showed any signs of arousal for the entire duration of Dean’s heat. He just woke up, calmed Dean down, got him off, cleaned him up, and went back to sleep. He never felt a need to pleasure himself. Surely that meant that there was zero attraction on his end.
Castiel watched the birds for a minute before leading the way back to the sunroom. He looked around. “Everyone looks pretty thirsty.” He walked up to a long, rectangular planter that was sitting in a glass tray. The plant in it…well, it looked dead. It was flat, the leaves all drooping down the sides of the planter.
Dean retreated into the kitchen to start cooking. What had his life become? It used to be so simple. As he was working, his phone rang. Sure enough, it was Sam.
By the time Dean set the table, Luke and Castiel were making their way downstairs. They must have been able to smell the food.
“I don’t talk to him anymore. He raised me and Sam, but not in the last three years. I sent Sammy to live with Bobby when I went off to college.”
“Not originally.” Castiel went quiet and curled on wings around himself, brushing his fingers through the feathers and plucking out the dead ones.
Gabriel smiled proudly. “Damn, look at you kids go. I couldn’t be prouder of you guys. This all sounds amazing.”
Dean gulps, shuddering at the thought of what’s to come. “Shit, Cas…” he breathes out, closing his eyes again. It’s too much.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry…” Luke was drunk. He got like this after a few drinks. Castiel resisted the affectionate touches and whispered apologies at first, but then he gave in. He was so touch-starved at times he couldn’t help but just accept it. He knew he was being manipulated, but right now it didn’t matter. He just needed that affection and softness.
The backyard is now rid of weeds, and the dirt surrounding the back patio has been raked with a hoe to break it up from the dried mass that it once was.
“Yes, I have,” Cas says, a small smile returning to his face. “I went to Gay-Straight alliance at my high school. I wasn’t out to my family at the time. Once I moved out and got away from my hyper-religious parents, I came out to my brothers. Gabriel, who you met earlier, is pansexual. My other brothers are straight, but they are accepting, even my twin, Jimmy, who is still very religious.”
It took about half an hour for everyone to arrive. Michael and Dean chatted while they waited, pausing only when one of the servers came to fetch them. Instead of staying away from the reception until cocktail hour was over, Michael and Dean had decided to join the cocktail hour. They didn’t get to see these people all together very often, so they wanted as much time with them as possible.
Dean whined, all the embarrassment from begging was long gone. “C’mon, I’ve been waiting for so long!”
Dean visibly relaxed. “Oh my god, thank you. I was just thinking about what I was going to take and how to pack it discreetly.”
Dean nodded and sat down. He should have known that Castiel understood what he was going through. The guy left the other asshole Milton brother just a few years ago. But, Dean still couldn’t shake the feeling that something was being left unsaid. If that was cleared, then why was the tension still there?
“Okay, that’s fine.” Dean opens the bag and hands Castiel a burger wrapped in paper. “I’ve got fries too.”
“Anything and everything. I trust you. I’m sick of spending my heats miserable and wishing you were here. I know you’re not going to hurt me.” Castiel kissed Dean softly, cupping his cheek.
Dean’s face heated up just at the thought of Castiel in heat. Picturing his face all flushed red and those gorgeous lips parted...fuck. Dean shifted and dug his teeth into his lower lip as he watched Castiel move. He almost heard himself whine, and it wasn’t until Castiel was staring at him that he realized that he actually whined out loud.
Luke tormented Castiel while they were alone for the next two months. Luke was never physical or extremely aggressive with Castiel, who knew it was probably because he had a couple inches on the alpha. He was all lean muscle and could probably take the alpha down if necessary. Still, every day Luke would have some new comment about how Castiel was desperate for Dean. It got worse when Castiel accidentally blurted out the other omega’s name during sex one evening.
Dean held the back of Castiel’s neck to pull him closer. This didn’t feel like kissing an old lover, it felt like a first kiss. Everything felt new and exciting. There wasn’t an element of fear. He no longer had to think about someone else finding out about them. Instead, he was just excited to be with Castiel and to feel that spark burst into flames.
“That was a good idea, but if you want, you can transfer them to your new phone.” Castiel took a brand-new smartphone out of his pocket and held it out to Dean.
Dean nodded. “I’ll give the address to Jody.” He scribbled it down on a piece of paper and took it to Jody’s office.
Dean nodded quickly. “Definitely keep that idea on the back burner, because I’m going to lose my mind just wearing this one.”
Dean slowed down a little, right to where it felt the best. He tried to slow down his breathing and let his body loosen and relax. It took him a minute, but he managed with Castiel’s presence. He thought about what Castiel said and tried to be patient, to just let his orgasm slowly build. He panted hard, sweat soaking his hair and the room feeling ungodly hot. This wasn’t working. “Please, please...I can’t-”
Michael puts the vial of grace in his pocket. “If that’s it, then I’ll be on my way.” He turns to Gabriel. “You stay out of trouble or I will put a bounty on your head.”
He walks up to his childhood bedroom and sets his bag down. The walls are painted white, which goes well with his brown bedspread. There’s a small TV and entertainment center on the wall opposite from the bed. A massive wooden bookshelf covers half of one wall and a large window covers the other wall. The floors are hardwood with a fluffy rug beside the bed.
Dean sets Castiel down and smiles tiredly. “As much as I’d like to stay up and chat, I’m exhausted from the drive. You want to come sleep in my room?”
Dean scrambled to get his own shirt off, desperate for the skin to skin contact that he had craved for months.
Castiel turns onto the highway and settles in for the drive, enjoying the road before it gets trafficky. “I’m going to have a lot of loans. My parents are paying for my bachelor’s, but I’m planning on going to grad school and getting my PhD. It’s going to be very expensive. I don’t mind, though. I like school and I want to earn the highest degree possible.”
Castiel hummed with a grin. “I wouldn’t underestimate Dean’s Scrabble skills if I were you. He pulls out some long, high scoring words when he’s under pressure.”
“I know. It’s scary how fast she grows.” Dean watched Claire for a few seconds before turning back to Gabriel. “So, why did you come?”
Castiel peers at Gabriel from over his own laptop screen. He usually hates when people try to talk to him while he works, and this is mildly annoying, but in fairness he needs more friends. Meg had been pretty much it until he moved in with Dean. Now he can say with confidence that he has two friends. Maybe having someone else would be nice. “English. You?”
Dean turned quickly at the familiar voice, his stomach going tight at the sight of Luke. “What are you doing here? Are you following me?”
A paternity test proved that Claire was Castiel’s daughter. It was an emotional day when those results came in. They already knew, but the concrete evidence was enough to bring Castiel to tears.
“It’s not, but I do all the labor myself, so I can subtract the cost of that. It does cost me time, but it’s time well spent to me.” As he speaks, he has to get progressively louder. The music and crowd are growing in volume.
“I didn’t, though. It’s another long story. Look, you can’t say that you saw me here today, alright? You’ll put yourself at risk if you do.”
“I know. When we’re married, I promise I’ll be there during the nights of your heats to help you through them.” Michael kissed Dean’s forehead.
The feeling was maximized at the club, where everyone was looking at him. He laid across the couch next to Castiel, seductively posed. He relished in every long stare he got, his stomach warming up at the idea. He longed for the day that Castiel would want to do a public scene. He promised that they would soon, so hopefully that time would come shortly.
Dean pauses. “How are you going to call Gabriel? They’re probably not going to let you get to your phone.”
After his shower, he sits out in the living room to wait for Dean. He’s pretty sure Dean will be okay with it, but it’s good roommate etiquette to ask.
The feeling takes over Dean’s entire body, and the urge to move up into Cas becomes much stronger. He wants to be good, so he stays perfectly still, save for his body moving with the bounce of the mattress as Cas moves.
“We can’t say anything about it to anyone else in our friend group. They’ll freak out,” Castiel says, a concerned look on his face.
Dean set his phone aside and sighed softly. He wondered if Michael would be back anytime soon. It would be nice if he could get to know the man he was supposed to marry within the year. He drummed his fingers on the table and tried not to use his phone too much. It just felt rude in a place this fancy.
The rest of the day was peaceful. Castiel brought out some board games and the three of them chatted and kept themselves busy. Gabriel and Michael got home at the same time for the first time since Dean had lived there.
Dean put on a polite smile, but he couldn’t shake the weird feeling about Michael telling his coworkers about him. The man in front of him was much older than them. He looked like he was about John’s age.
Dean scooted a little closer to Castiel. “I’m sorry I scared you.” He was approaching the twelve-hour mark since the night before when he received his last dose of the suppressant. He found himself staring at Castiel’s neck, his body leaning forward slightly. When he caught himself, he sat up with a blush. “Sorry.”
“A little bit. I can still tell what you’re feeling.” He pauses. “You’re torn, I know. I can’t imagine how hard it must be for you.”
Michael took Dean’s bag from Castiel once he pulled back. “Follow me, I’ll show you to your room.” He turned and started up the stairs, leading Dean down a hallway to a door.
“I wouldn’t go that far but yes, I’m very scared of the water.” Castiel kisses the back of Dean’s neck. “I think I know what you’re scared of.”
Dean turns around. “Cas, you just admitted that you’re considering breaking up with me to go be a monster! Of fucking course I’m upset!”
Finally, they arrive at a tall building. Cas takes them inside, up the elevator, and down a hallway. He digs a key out of his backpack and unlocks the door.
The only words spoken during the car ride are Castiel’s directions back to the house. Once they arrive, they part ways to go to their separate bedrooms without a word about the kiss.
Castiel sighs. Dean is right, a lot has happened in the eighteen months since “the angel incident” as they had dubbed it. Today they moved into their new apartment in downtown Atlanta. Dean has landed an internship in the same city as Castiel is getting his masters degree at, Georgia State University. “We need to unpack within a week. My parents come next weekend.”
“I know you haven’t been sleeping lately. You look exhausted. Just lie still with me and see what happens.” Dean lays down in bed and waits for Castiel to lay down as well.
Dean takes a few seconds to process that information. This all feels very sudden, and not what Dean expected to happen at all. As he thinks about everything, the feelings he had bottled up for years start coming to the surface. All of the staring, the touches, and the longing had built up into something big and terrifying. It’s a pool that Dean stands at the edge of. He knows that if he dives into it, there will be no return.
Dean squeezed Castiel’s hand. “Man...I’m so sorry. I’m really not good with words, so I don’t really know what to say except I’m sorry.”
Dean lasted about an hour before he got too antsy to stay in bed for much longer. He carefully slid out of Michael’s arms and walked out of the bedroom. He thought he heard someone downstairs, so he quietly made his way down to see who was there. When he rounded the corner into the kitchen, he saw Castiel looking in the cabinets for something. He was in a large t-shirt and pajama pants. His hair was disheveled and Dean could smell Luke’s rut on him from ten feet away.
Dean awkwardly sits on the bed and sips his water. He tries to think of something to say, but all he can think of is how he honestly feels. “Why is it weird now?”
Cas runs his hands down his own body until he reaches his thighs. He finds one of Dean’s hands and laces their fingers together. “Tell me how it feels.”
Gabriel snaps his fingers and the storm above them dissipates. The water calms and it’s much quieter now. “This island is hidden. I only bought us a little time. They’ll figure out that we’re here. Also I thought it would be dramatic.”
“We’re going home soon. This will turn into a party soon, and I’m not a fan. Luke and Castiel are already outside, as far as I know. They said their goodbyes.”
“I thought I heard voices out here.” Dean looks at Sam and Castiel with a slight smile. “Whatcha talking about?”
Castiel put one hand on Luke’s chest and stopped him dead in his tracks. “That’s enough. Get your food and go upstairs.” There was a growl behind his voice, and he looked powerful in that moment, holding the territorial alpha back with one hand. Luke huffed and grabbed his plate from the counter before retreating upstairs.
Dean nodded. “I planned on ditching it at the park, that way I look like I am where I’m supposed to be up until the last minute.”
Dean was overstimulated already, but it still felt good. He was starting to come back from that intense orgasm, so he felt ready. He let out a shout when Castiel pulled back and thrusted into him hard again. The pace was just as hard and fast as before. Dean’s cheek got pushed hard into the mattress, and he felt utterly used.
Dean smiled and gently clinked his glass against Michael’s before drinking. He wasn’t the biggest champagne person, but hey, it was a drink. He leaned back against the couch and sipped his champagne.
Dean shook his head in disbelief. “He’s asleep in your room, isn’t he? You’re just messing with me.”
Dean took his time cleaning up. He didn’t really feel like moving quickly when he was worried like this. By the time he had washed all of the dishes and cleaned the counters, nearly twenty minutes had passed and a strong scent punched Dean in the face. It was obviously Castiel, but it reeked of sadness and rejection. When Dean turned around, he saw the omega sulking over to the table. He was limping slightly, presumably from his activities with Luke. His usual confident stance was reduced to sagging shoulders and a dropped head.
Castiel spends the rest of the night looking over syllabi, watching youtube, and texting his mom to let her know that he’s moved in nicely.
“Yeah. I’m 100% sure, I wouldn’t be saying it if I wasn’t. Michael doesn’t pay enough attention to notice the two week discrepancy. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier.”
Castiel tries to pull Dean back down. “It’s an older house. It makes noises sometimes. It’s nothing. Go back to sleep.” He glances at the clock. “It’s three am.”
“I think so too. You seem really well-adjusted and way more laid back than before. It’s nice to see you like that.”
The first few booths he sees are full of rainbow apparel. If he was more sure of himself, he might buy some. His little crochet flag is enough for now. Maybe next year, he’ll be out of the closet, and he can actually dress up.
“I called him as soon as you told me to leave. He left the office and I called 911 right before he got back. Without rush hour traffic, the commute wasn’t very long, maybe twenty minutes. He was really worried about you. I don’t know what happened after you left in the ambulance.”
Dean breathes a small sigh of relief that comes out as a happy sigh. Another thought does come to mind. “You don’t mind that I’m like...still in the closet, right?”
“Oh, right.” Castiel walked over to the wall and placed his hand on it. He closed his eyes, brows knitted together in concentration. After a few seconds, his eyes opened, blue light shining from them.
“Everything’s fine. Luke is taking him home. He shouldn’t have been here. He was supposed to wait for me to get home.” Michael shot a look at Gabriel, who rolled his eyes.
Castiel turns around and one of his ceramic bowls hits him in the stomach. He runs back to the circle and stands in it, trying not to think about how bad that hurt. As ridiculous as the salt circle sounds, he’s scared and nothing makes sense.
He dragged me and Sammy all over the country. We lived in motels and the back of his car. When I was fifteen, my uncle Bobby took us in. Dad would come back every couple months and try to convince me to come back with him, but I stayed with Sam. I could shoot a gun when I was seven, just to be able to defend myself and Sam in case of an emergency. The only reason I don’t know where my dad is right now is because I haven’t bothered to look. I learned to track people down from security camera footage, tracking license plates, and using websites that hopefully aren’t too illegal.
“No, it’s not. Just breathe. We’ll be okay. There’s no way that he knows yet. He shouldn’t even be home yet.”
“Thank you for helping me do this. I know there’s not much of a chance of getting a response, but I can hope.” Castiel handed the laptop back to Dean after sending the email.
Dean was breathless with every kiss. As much of a relief as it was to have this last heat together, this was a hundred times better. No heat clouding his mind, just the two of them. They didn’t have to rush for Dean’s safety and sanity, they could go slow and drag it out. Heat sex wasn’t bliss, this was bliss.
“Harder? Oh, you greedy little thing. Even this isn’t enough for you? You need it so hard that you won’t be able to walk straight tomorrow?”
Castiel found himself back in Chicago for a weekend to visit Meg. He was on break from school, in between his undergrad and starting nursing school. He had gotten into the nursing program at Missouri State University. Jack was two years old. He resembled his mom greatly, but every once in awhile, he’d make a face that looked like Luke. He was still precious and Castiel loved him with his whole heart.
Dean looked at his own hand and ran his thumb over the ring with a soft smile. “Thanks.” He walked over to the fridge. “Any requests for breakfast?”
“I think she would too. You need a support system here. Meg is a good friend. She’ll help you too.” Dean squeezes Castiel’s hands. “Do you want to come to my room? You can stay in there until we get this figured out. I feel bad that you’re in your room by yourself trying to deal with this.”
“I’m sure.” Dean followed Castiel to the couch and sat down beside him. They chatted about TV shows for a little while. Dean brought up Dr. Sexy M.D., which Cas found hilarious. Turns out Dr. Sexy was one of Castiel’s guilty pleasures too.
“You were his best friend. Surely you knew he was miserable here. He was only staying to support you until you were married and he knew Michael would take over.”
“Now, you’re not getting back up until you explain what happened between you and Dean last night. I think you’re leaving me out of some juicy details and I’m hurt.”
“Don’t remind me.” Castiel wrapped his arms around himself. “He’ll thank me later. Dean could have died if we waited three more hours for him to be home.”
Dean’s head shot up when he heard a loud thud against the ceiling. He turned his head and saw Castiel sitting shirtless on the bed, two massive, black wings spread out behind him. “Dude, why am I able to see those?”
“You said that you would have known about a Nephilim being born, since they’re so powerful. Why do you think you didn’t sense it?”
Castiel watches Dean get out of bed and slowly open the bedroom door. He creeps out into the hallway and out of Castiel’s sight.
Dean smiles. “Actually, we could sleep in my room if you want. I have a really big quilt I sleep under that I think you’ll like.”
Castiel shakes his head and climbs into bed. “You have no reason to apologize. Everyone’s scared of something or has something to have a nightmare about.”
Castiel walks back to his room and puts himself to bed with a smile on his face, hopeful about everything to come.
For the rest of the weekend, Castiel spends most of his time hiding away in his room. He goes for a bike ride Sunday evening, which he always enjoys. It’s fun to ride around campus while it is empty. There was an actual breeze instead of the usual still and humid air.
The next day, Dean went into work more warily than usual. He wasn’t sure what the exact process was going to be for this investigation.
Castiel sighs. “Atlanta.” He doesn’t even know why he gives a specific city to anyone who isn’t from the Atlanta area. No one outside of that area knows Dunwoody, a city just north of Atlanta.
Dean looked up at Castiel. It was very angelic of him to be sympathetic towards a human. ‘Yeah...Let’s give this to Jody so they can send some officers out there.”
Cas hums with a soft grin. “I’ll let you take the reins, then. I’m open, so just do what feels right.”
“Um, I like cars. I have...had a classic car. She’s a 1967 Chevy Impala. She belongs to my little brother now, until he moves in a few weeks.”
“You’re doing so good for me. Do you think you could stay here a little longer for me? The spanking is over, you’ve had enough.”
Once he was dressed, he walked down the stairs and rounded the corner into the kitchen. He just about jumped out of his skin when he saw Castiel standing in there.
Dean squints at the menu and looks over it. “Huh. Interesting.” He sits back and sighs. “This is an interesting little place.”
Castiel drums his fingers against his thigh. “Knowing Gabriel, there is probably going to be a lot of alcohol.”
Dean was still an hour away from Lawrence at nine o’clock. His phone started ringing, and he glanced at it to see that it was Castiel. He thought about answering, then declined the call. He still had an hour of alone time, and he wanted to take it.
Castiel is still reeling from all the memories that have flooded back. He remembers who he was for eons before his human life. It makes everything in his life feel like drops in the ocean. “I-I...I remember everything.”
Castiel looked up at Dean and seemed genuinely surprised by his reaction. “It’s not that bad...he’s just in rut. He can’t help it.”
After he takes the condom off, ties it off, and tosses it into the trash can, Dean stares at the ceiling for a while, trying to catch his breath. His brain slowly starts to work through what just happened. The entire day goes through his mind like a movie.
Dean smiled softly and nodded. “Of course.” He took his daughter’s hand and led her to the bathroom. She still didn’t really like the bath, but she didn’t put up a big fight anymore.
“Yeah, great to see you too, bitch.” Dean punched Sam in the shoulder as he pulled back from the hug, grinning at the eye-roll he got in return.
Castiel stepped back and gave a soft smile. “Micheal is probably waiting for you downstairs. If you ever need anything, my room is on the other end of the hall, on the right.”
“He wrote this whole letter for me to read and it had a bunch of advice for your heat, like things to look out for to make sure you were safe. I thought it was really nice. I’ve never been with an omega in heat before, so I definitely needed the help.”
Castiel smiles to himself. Dean always had a way of showing this tender side of himself that usually stayed hidden. It was gone when they were in the library together or with friends. He wasn’t cold by any means, but he wasn’t nearly as invested in other people like he was with Castiel, enough so that it was noticeable. “What else do you want to know?”
Dean had never been an anxious person until recent years. It just kept building over time with everything going on. So much had happened and he never got a chance to really process it.
Before she does anything, Gabriel appears out of nowhere behind her and puts a hand on the back of her head. A cloud of black smoke comes billowing out of her mouth. Castiel finds that he’s not pinned anymore, but he’s too scared to move. He watches as his friend falls to the floor and then meets Gabriel’s eyes.
Dean heard the DJ announce their arrival as he walked through the door, hand-in-hand with Michael. Once they were in the crowd, Michael patted Dean on the back. “Go see Sam and Bobby, I know you’re dying to spend time with them.”
Castiel and Dean’s relationship was stronger than ever before, which meant it was getting harder to hide. They had to shower more and more to get their scents off of one another. They smelled too much like potential mates sometimes. When they were home alone, they never did anything sexual. It was too risky. Luke and Gabriel came home early sometimes, and if they smelled sex when Dean wasn’t in heat, it could turn ugly. That didn’t stop them from exchanging gentle touches, brushes of their hands, a hand on the other’s back, or staring. They stared at each other too much. It would be too much even if they were a couple.
Castiel didn’t respond except for a nod. He had been through this time and time again. It was always the same. Luke would make a big show about Castiel’s behavior and once they were there, it was almost like he didn’t care anymore. Castiel had bigger things on his mind today. Michael had mentioned in passing that he would be proposing to Dean tonight. Castiel already warned the other omega about it, just to prepare him. It ruined the surprise, but given their situation, the surprise would have been too much.
The next day was incredibly awkward. Michael went into work late, so he was there for breakfast. Dean was grateful to have him to hide behind while Castiel was around for breakfast. They had leftover waffles, so Dean was relieved that he didn’t have to cook.
“I wish he didn’t do that to you. It looks like it hurts.” Dean frowned, brushing his thumb over one of the spots on Castiel’s chest.
It has to be one of the happiest moments of Dean’s life. Surrounded by people like him, he feels free. He’s holding hands and dancing with a man, and no one cares. People might actually like it. He’s never felt so welcome anywhere in his life. Before he came, he wasn’t sure if he belonged. But now, he’s starting to feel at home.
Castiel wrapped an arm around Dean. “As for our relationship, we’re just letting it progress naturally. Between school and the kids, we’re pretty busy, so we take any time we can get together.”
“Nervous. I kinda wished I could stay on these forever. It’s so nice to not have to worry about my heat killing me or being painful. I only had two mini-heats, and now I have to have a real one.”
Dean nodded, taking a deep breath. “I’m sorry I kissed you. I don’t really know what’s happening with me. I’ve never been attracted to another omega.”
Castiel gave Dean a few seconds to breathe before pulling again. “It’s a game of power and trust, isn’t it? I take control over the very thing that keeps you alive, and the power imbalance is arousing. You also have to trust me to know when to let go, and I’ll trust you to tell me if I’m going too long.” He let go, and Dean drew in a sharp breath.
Castiel was watching as well with a smile. He didn’t look at Dean, still trying to give him space. Dean felt more guilty now that Castiel was avoiding him, but he really needed the space right now. He sat down in the living room to watch the kids play together.
Dean nodded, letting out a deep sigh. He knew he would feel much better with nothing on, so he got fully undressed. When he glanced back to Castiel, the other omega wasn’t looking, giving Dean a little bit of privacy. “I don’t care if you look at me.”
Dean chewed his lip. He didn’t want Sam to worry about him. The kid had enough on his plate. “Well, I’m on a bit of a short time frame to marry Michael. I want to spend as much time with him as I can so we can get to know each other and stuff. If I flew down there, it would be a few days away from Michael, and with the time zone difference, we’d probably barely get to talk.”
“I can bring them into this plane of existence. I don’t often. I had them out while I was fighting. They had theirs out, so I would have been at a severe disadvantage if I had kept them away.” He looks back over his shoulder at the wings, spreading them a little further. “They got several good hits on me. It’s nothing severe, but my wings are in such a desperate need of grooming from the fight that I can’t fly.”
Castiel wakes up first the next morning. He looks down and sees Dean still under his arm. His face is fully relaxed and his mouth is hanging open. Castiel smiles at him and kisses his forehead. Looking at him makes Castiel’s heart feel full. Just knowing that Dean was his made everyday life so much sweeter.
He could go home, but the parade isn’t the only part of Pride. There’s an entire market to explore. Dean wants to walk around and check out what people have. He knows there’s art, apparel, and food.
During breakfast, Castiel knew his heat was starting. He felt it coming and tried to act normal, but Dean had caught on. All the memories of Dean during his heat only yesterday made Castiel unable to focus properly. He caught himself growling as he retreated to his bedroom to hide. He hoped that this one would pass quickly like usual, but it felt so much more intense, like a fire had been lit under him.
Sunday was slow. They slept in late and spent the afternoon in the living room. Gabriel was still moping around from his cold, and Castiel and Luke were mostly closed off in Luke’s room.
He parked at the park near Claire’s school to get some fresh air, noticing out of the corner of his eye that a car had followed him in here and parked nearby. He got out of the car and locked it, stepping out into the grass.
Castiel smiles. “I had to. It’s part of the culture here.” The waitress returns to ask them how the check is split, and Castiel answers that it’s separate. She writes down a few things on her notepad and leaves two yellow slips of paper on the table.
Castiel closes the door and lets out a heavy sigh. He hears movement and turns around to see Dean poking his head out of the door, a concerned look on his face.
Dean stared up at Castiel, the sound of his voice fading from his hearing. The world was blurry and all he could see was the outline of Castiel’s body. He saw him moving, but he couldn’t tell what was happening. He barely registered being pulled out of the bathtub and wrapped in a bathrobe. He heard shouting, and then another figure was in the room. The other person helped Castiel lift Dean off the floor and carry him out of the bathroom.
Dean thought for a moment. It was already weird having a human in his house, now an angel? But, Jack looked pretty freaked out unless he was with Castiel. “Uh, sure.” Dean pulled out his phone. “What’s your number? I’ll send you my address.”
Michael set Dean’s bag on the bed. “I’ll give you some time to settle in before dinner tonight. I’ll have Castiel bring your suit to change into when the time comes. Feel free to explore the house. The opposite end of the hall is Luke and Castiel’s rooms, and Luke is little possessive of his things, so I’d recommend steering clear. Gabriel lives in the basement suite. I wouldn’t recommend going there either, it looks like a tornado went through it. Other than that, feel free to look around and make yourself at home. I’ll see you at dinner.”
Thinking back to that morning, he still couldn’t really figure out why he was so angry. He felt much better out of the house, driving around. Then it hit him: he felt better because he was alone. For the past seven months, he had spent most of his time around his boyfriend. They didn’t have a period where they were together, but living separately. They were roommates first, and then boyfriends. They immediately started sleeping in the same bedroom.
After a few minutes of peace in the sunroom, Dean wandered around some more. The formal dining room was big and mildly terrifying. There was a guest suite complete with its own little living space. Dean found the door to the basement and debated going down there briefly, before deciding against it. He felt weird invading Gabriel’s space.
Gabriel pats Castiel on the shoulder. “Call me when they come for you, okay? You can’t face them alone, you’ll lose.”
Dean shakes his head. “No it’s not! You don’t directly remember anything, but you can spit out obscure history facts without even trying!”
“Mr. Novak, could you stay after to talk with me?” Dr. Adler makes eye contact with Castiel. His stern face doesn’t look very forgiving and Castiel wonders if he’s in trouble.
Castiel lets out a sigh of relief. “I’m going to get out of these wet clothes.” He quickly changes in his room before returning to the living room. He sees that Dean has also changed clothes. Castiel walks around to the couch. He falls back on it and wraps an arm around Dean once he joins. Everyone sits there quietly, recovering from their harrowing afternoon. Castiel closes his eyes, a small smile on his face. All of this made his relationship with Dean feel stronger. They definitely have stuff to talk about, but they made it through all of this. Their relationship survived Heaven trying to break them up. If they could make it through that, nothing could faze them.
“No problem.” Castiel sat down on the bed. “We should talk about what exactly we’re going to be doing, because we both know you won’t be thinking clearly once your heat starts.”
“What? No! I’m not a prisoner. I could leave if I really wanted to. Like if I called Michael right now and told him I wanted to go home, he would let me.”
“Thanks.” Dean takes it and gives an awkward smile. How was this so easy in a crowd, but so hard alone?
Dean’s eyes are drawn away from Castiel’s chest to the big, black mass emerging from his back. The mass unfurls into a pair of massive black wings. “Holy shit. How am I seeing those?”
Castiel looked startled, eyebrows raised. “How did you...right. I’m sorry. I guess I’m just a little touchy after a heat.”
Dean knew Cas was close when one of his hands shot up to Dean’s face, cupping his cheek and looking right into his eyes. It was shockingly intimate, for a handjob. Castiel’s eyes squeezed shut and he let out a long groan as he came. Dean felt pride swell up in his chest when Castiel not only came, but popped a knot as well. He gently squeezed the large knot, milking Cas dry.
The walk to Cas’s apartment is quiet. Dean is surprised with himself for holding Cas’s hand the whole way. Other gay and lesbian couples pass them as they walk, so he doesn’t feel out of place.
When the dinner ended, Luke and Castiel were out of the building quickly, Castiel being pulled along by Luke.
Dean blinked in realization. “Shit, I didn’t even think about that.” He sighed and nodded. “Okay, don’t do that then. You’re right. That’s not worth the risk...What about the other way around?”
“I’m going to Stanford in two weeks. I’m a political science major with a history minor. I want to go to law school.”
“Our parents didn’t want to deal with us. That’s another story. I don’t want you to change who you are. I just think maybe you’d be happier. Look, I’m not too far away from you. In a car, Alton is about four hours away from Chicago. I could-”
Zachariah stumbles back, far enough that Castiel is able to step over Dean and stand in front of him protectively. “You know what? You were right. You’re not worth all of this trouble.” He raises his blade, but Castiel grabs his wrist and shoves him back.
“Good boy.” Castiel stepped away from behind Dean and moved in front of his face. He gently wiped away his tears. “Color?”
They didn’t spend the entire day doing kinky things, but they did do something every day. At first, Dean loved it. He loved exploring their kinks and finding new things that they enjoyed doing. But, the last few times they had scened, Dean wasn’t feeling it.
“House purification ritual. I packed the bags for the ritual when I moved here just in case I encountered a poltergeist here. You put the bags in the wall in the north, south, east, and west corners of the house. This one wasn’t too powerful yet.”
The other bedroom door opens with a soft creak and out comes Dean. He rubs a hand over his face and looks at the coffee maker on the counter. Before he can even say anything, Castiel speaks.
Dean sighed. “I don’t know if I could do that. Michael can’t leave work to come with me, so I don’t know when I’d be able to.”
Cas fully seats himself in Dean’s lap, breathing heavily. “Give me a moment to adjust.” His voice is quiet, almost a whisper.
Dean breathed a sigh of relief when they were finally off the subject of being stuck in the house. “Well, on a usual day, it’s just me and Cas here. Gabriel has a bakery in town, and he’s really present there. He says it runs by itself with his staff, but he wants to be there to work with them, which is cool, I guess. Luke and Michael go to work at the same time, but take different cars because they can’t stand each other.”
“A bad one.” There it was, Castiel’s usual sarcastic tone. “They were rogue angels working for hell. I won, but at a cost.”
“I’m not sure I’ll be able to. My parents keep me busy and I’m flying to see my extended family on the twenty first. I will go visit one day, I promise.”
Castiel had picked up on how Dean didn’t like to talk about his dad much. He got tense every time the topic came up, so Castiel always tried to veer off of it. “So, what’s Sam like?”
Dean spread his knees apart a bit and scanned the room again. He spotted someone and grinned, sticking his ass out as much as he could from where he was sitting.
“Yeah, I’m good. It just feels weird, you know? Going back to my fiance after that? I guess it’s harder for you, since you have to go back to your husband.” Dean sighed. “If things are so bad with him, why do you stay?”
He sits on the couch and just before he turns the TV on, he hears Dean’s car starting, and then stopping. Something makes a clicking noise and the engine doesn’t start. Castiel gets up and steps outside to see what’s happening. He sees Dean hit his steering wheel and turn the key again. The engine clicks a few times and Dean sighs, getting out of the car.
Dean had been around omegas in heat before. It happened all the time in high school, when everyone’s cycles were irregular and omegas randomly went into heat during class. Dean could recognize the scent of heat anywhere, but it usually wasn’t very pleasant. It was almost like walking into a Bath and Body Works and having the employees spray you in the face with every flowery or fruity perfume at once.
Dean took a long swig of the water before picking up his phone and texting Cas to let him know he was awake. His hairline was slightly damp from sweat, which already made him feel gross. It sucked that he had to go through another heat so soon. Hopefully, this one wouldn’t include another hospital visit.
Castiel smiled back. “They said there was no actual evidence to support that I had kidnapped you, so they didn’t have enough grounds for arrest. Michael threw a huge fit and got escorted out.”
Castiel watched as Luke left, his crossword long forgotten. It was obvious what he had to do now, but he didn’t want to. It hurt to even think about it, but he had no choice. Protecting Dean came first.
When Cas returned, Dean melted at just the hands on his shoulders, guiding him to stand up on shaky legs and walk to the bathroom, all the way to the tub. Dean carefully stepped over the sides and found the water cold. When he whined, he was simply guided to sit down. Dean didn’t even think about the fact that he was completely naked around Cas, and the other omega didn’t seem to care.
They arrived at the dinner at 7:30. The event was being held in a large banquet hall in a country club. Limos were lined up to drop off their passengers at the door. Dean didn’t understand why they didn’t just walk, but he didn’t complain. Michael took Dean’s hand and guided him out of the limo. Once they were out, he linked their elbows.
Dean nodded quickly. “Of course.” He held the door open and closed it behind Gabriel. “What are you doing here? Not that I’m not happy to see you.”
The puffed up feathers along the ridge of Castiel’s wing refuse to go down when Dean runs his hand over them. He tries several times before huffing. “These just won’t go back into place.”
When he first came to Pride, he wasn’t really sure what he wanted. Here he is, lying in bed with someone he wants to see a future with, someone he knows will guide him through every step of the coming out process. For the first time in his life, he’s proud to be who he is, and it sure does feel good.
Dean stood up and walked to the kitchen, opening the fridge to find the plate Cas was talking about. He uncovered it to find a delicious looking beef stroganoff. He licked his lips and put the plate in the microwave. He stared at it as it heated up until he realized he needed a fork. He searched the countless drawers for one and finally found the elegant silverware. He grabbed a fork and took the plate out of the microwave, digging in immediately. When the flavor hit his tongue, he moaned and took another bite. The dish was seasoned perfectly and even delicious after being nuked in the microwave. Dean practically licked his plate clean and turned to see Castiel watching him from the doorway.
“I’ll just start with the big one, you’re out of here after the wedding. We’ll frame it as if you’re the one who left. I’ll give you enough so you don’t starve, but don’t expect any favors. You betrayed me, Castiel.”
Dean washed the dishes and stuck them in the dishwasher before grabbing his work bag. “Alright, I’m heading to work. Follow Cas’s advice. Don’t go outside. My neighbors are nice and all, but they’d probably sink their teeth into you and Jody would kill me if that happened.”
Sure enough, when Castiel gets set up in his usual spot, Dean appears. He sits down across from him without a word about the tension Castiel was feeling. He starts working on his schoolwork, only giving Castiel a brief glance and a smile.
Dean nearly jumps out of his skin when he hears a deep voice rumble next to him. He turns to see who’s there and freezes.
“I’m so sorry, Dean. I should have been there with you. I can’t imagine how scary that was all by yourself.”
Michael shrugged, moving to massage the back of Dean’s neck with his fingers. “He hates these kinds of events, and he’s very vocal about it. We don’t make him go anymore. It’s hard to get him to family holidays at times.”
Dean leans over and kisses Castiel’s forehead. “I don’t know where I’d be without you. I’d be lonely. Hell, I might have gone back to hunting. I was considering it briefly when I first came here. Then you happened. You are my reason to stay away from hunting. I could never expose you to that life. You’ve seen enough, been through enough. Both of us have.”
They order in a pizza for dinner and sit around the living room, chatting about classes and school in general. Gabriel is watching Castiel the whole time. It makes Castiel feel like Gabriel knows something, and it’s off-putting to say the least.
“Yeah, I’m pretty tired.” Dean stood up and walked over to the drawer that he now knew contained pajamas that fit him. He took out a set and walked to the bathroom to change. Peeling each part of his suit off brought a new sense of relief. He put on the pajamas and looked at the ring on his finger. It was foreign against his skin, the metal heavy on his finger. He knew he’d get used to having it on soon enough.
“Just like I predicted. You’re sweet.” He grinned and leaned in, lapping up the slick from Dean’s perineum and dragging his tongue over his hole.
Sam nodded, his brows scrunched slightly in skepticism. “Okay.” He looked back out the window at the airport. The car pulled up to the drop off for departures and stopped. He looked back at Dean before getting out of the car as the driver was getting his bag out of the trunk.
Dean sighed. “This isn’t a conversation to have with me. It’s not my call. Talk to Jody tomorrow and see what she says.”
Dean left the office once Jack was sitting, returning to his own space, which felt much better without another presence. He would have felt bad about dumping Jack on Castiel, but the angel seemed to want this.
“It was a while back, after about a month of living with Dean. I was craving Waffle House and I told him I was going. He said he had never tried it so I took him with me. Well, he took me. He won’t ride in my car. He insists on driving his own.”
Castiel shook his head, taking Dean’s hand. “I’ve been dodging questions. You have every right to be curious.”
Dean stares at Castiel for a few seconds without moving. He looks like a predator assessing its prey. Suddenly, he makes a move. He ducks down and grabs Castiel around the middle, throwing him over his shoulder.
Dean was moping around the entire day they spent travelling back to Chicago. He didn’t want to leave the pretty beach house and the delicious seafood behind. On the other hand, he was really excited to see Castiel.
“Here, let’s get you out of this.” Castiel popped open the cuffs and let Dean’s arms hang. He undid every strap and rubbed the skin underneath each one.
“Alright. Thanks for calling. I’m really happy that you’re finally out of there. Call Bobby. He’ll want to know too.”
“I’ve never seen one and no hunter I’ve talked to has ever seen one either.” Dean stands up slowly. “Either way, we’re safe now. Let’s go back to bed.”
“So we tell another station that there’s a human and a Nephilim on the loose? I thought we were trying to keep this from getting out.”
Gabriel seemed to find Dean’s reaction funny, laughing as he stuck another lollipop in his mouth. “You’re cute, Dean-o.” He looked out the window. “We’re almost there.”
Dean nodded a bit. “Yeah, it’s nice. Why’d you become a detective? Seems like a big jump from warrior, to guardian, to detective.”
The next morning was tense. Michael was still around, so Castiel had to stay quiet. He ached to talk to Dean about what happened, but he had to stay patient. Michael would leave soon.
Rejection does things to a person. It isn’t just a feeling of sadness. Rejection has a way of eating at someone and making them think that everything is their fault. Suddenly, they’re analyzing every single one of their own flaws to find a reason for the rejection. It makes a person look at themselves under a microscope, and not in a good way.
Gabriel tilted his head in confusion. “Okay, one: why does he want another kid? Two: how could he be sterile if you had Claire just a few years ago?”
Castiel pushed Dean up against the wall and kissed him hard, hands sliding all over his body. “I missed you, I missed you so much.”
“I do.” Castiel pulled out his phone and showed Dean the picture. It was simple, front-facing, and Jack had a slight smile.
Dean looks at Cas, and when he meets his eyes, everything feels a little more okay. “No. You’re one of the best people I’ve ever met.” That last part comes out of nowhere. It’s his sex-stupid brain...maybe.
Castiel was watching the birds at the feeders outside, sipping from a mug of hot coffee. “It’s really pretty out. It’ll be a good day to work in the garden.”
Castiel smiled softly. “I try not to do it too often. It can get toxic fast. You’re still supposed to be autonomous and free to do whatever you want, even though I do consider you to be mine. As long as it’s consensual, I think it’s okay.”
Castiel stares at his own hands in his lap, pondering their conversation. “So what do I do? He’s not ready and I shouldn’t force him.”
“It’s our week of paradise.” Dean hummed and finished washing himself. He stepped out of the shower and grabbed a towel, drying himself off. “I never thought we would have this either. I wish it was longer, but as long as I get to have you, I don’t care how long it is.”
Castiel stands up. “Come on, let’s put some actual pajamas on and go to bed. I’ll lay with you until you fall back asleep. You can even sleep in my room if you want.”
Despite everything, Castiel stayed positive around Dean. He wanted so badly to enjoy the time they had left. Castiel found himself staring at Dean, his heart aching when he thought about leaving him. Even though he was being forced out, it still felt like he was abandoning Dean.
The reception was at a country club about fifteen minutes away from the church. The entrance was decorated with white tulle and black and white balloons. It was extremely formal, but Dean thought it was kind of pretty. It looked exactly how he expected traditional wedding stuff to look.
Castiel nods with a smile. “He could do that with an English degree. There’s several different majors he can choose from and all of them will get him into law school.”
Castiel kisses the top of Dean’s head. “I think we’re safe. Besides, I have an archangel that’s going to follow me around for the rest of my life.”
Once everything was inside, Dean took Claire into the backyard to let her play. He sat in one of the lawn chairs and made multiple phone calls to try and get Claire set up in school. He went with the elementary school Castiel had recommended in the car. It took some back and forth work, but now he had a meeting set up to get Claire registered, so all was settled.
“In a perfect world, I’d be an author and I’d live off those earnings. But, writing novels isn’t a steady job for most people. There’s no guaranteed income. If I spend a year on a book and it flops, I’m screwed. Most authors have other jobs. Some work for publishing companies, and some are academics. I’m going into the academic realm. I can see myself as a professor, so that’s my goal right now.”
“Is Claire adjusting alright? Jack likes playing with her.” Castiel idly wrote down some notes while he spoke.
He was able to find Zachariah, Castiel’s father. He worked for a large corporation called Sandover, in an upper management position. Through that, he found that Anna Novak was also employed at Sandover in IT.
When Dean came from his own hand, he pictured bright blue eyes, and they weren’t his future husband’s.
The weather in Georgia is more like a very long summer, a short winter, and then summer again. Spring and Fall are almost nonexistent. As the days move into October, the weather is still hot. It had cooled down to the mid-80’s during the day, but it got chilly at night, dipping down into the 50’s.
Castiel shook his head. “Not the knotting part, I meant to do that. I mean the condom broke. I felt it. It happened after we were locked. I didn’t want to hurt you so I didn’t try to pull out but-god! I’m an idiot!”
Castiel shook his head. “No, I understand. It’s a lot of information.” He took a deep breath. “It’s funny, I thought she looked a little like my mom. I guess I know why now.”
“Um, probably anything you could think of. If not we can wait for Gabriel to get back. He’ll be back the earliest.”
Castiel finally met Dean’s eyes. “No, I’m still going to do that. I promised. I just can’t do the rest. The intimacy, the closeness, I can’t. We have to stop.”
Michael nodded. “Thank you for letting me know. I’ll be sure to purchase any accommodations you might need to help yourself through it.”
“Good morning.” Castiel’s voice was even more gravelly than usual. It always sounded like he just woke up, but now it sounded like he had been gargling rocks all night.
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Well, I don’t have a shady past. Not at all. My life has been pretty boring. What about you? Do you have a shady past?” Castiel teases.
As he stares at his flag, music starts playing over the speakers lining the streets. His gaze finally breaks from the flag to look out at the street. He cranes his neck to look up the road at the oncoming parade.
Castiel drops to the floor and covers his head. He hears the cabinets opening and slamming shut. Glass shatters and more objects from their kitchen go flying around the room. He looks up in time to see Dean running out of the house, so he gets up and follows him. Just as he makes it to the door, it slams shut in front of him. He grabs the doorknob and tries to open it, but it’s stuck. “Dean!” He yanks on the door as hard as he can, but it doesn’t budge.
“God, Mikey, I don’t think you realize how ridiculous you sound half of the time. A fucking parfait? I eat a damn muffin and I feel like a god. You and your froufrou parfaits. You wanna know what he eats for lunch, Dean? He orders food from restaurants, nice-ass restaurants!” Gabriel threw his arms in the air.
Dean got out of the car and walked up to the door, blushing slightly as he approached the man, who reached out to take his bag.
“They’re not out of place.” Castiel seems to be having a hard time speaking. “My wings are...reactive to touch.”
“He’s in rut, so he’s closed up in his room. I’m just down here for a food break,” Castiel explained. “Speaking of which, what was it you made, Dean?”
Castiel frowned. “Humans were supposed to be the dominant species on Earth. That will probably never happen again, but we shouldn’t force them into extinction. Humans are amazing. They gave so much to this world.”
Dean blinked and glanced at Michael before speaking. “Thank you very much. I’m sure he’ll be ecstatic to hear about all of this.”
After another hour of walking, they exited the National Forest and came across a little cabin next to a pond. The tire tracks led right up to an ATV parked outside. The cabin looked run down and empty.
Michael rolls his eyes and turns back to Castiel. “Goodbye, Castiel. I wish you a good life.” There’s a sound of rustling feathers and Michael is gone.
The movie ends later in the evening, and they separate to go to their own rooms. Castiel gets ready for bed while thinking about how grateful he is that he gets along with his roommate.
“I’m just teasing.” Castiel let go of the loop and straddled Dean’s thighs. “I’m going to fuck you so hard, you’ll have no choice but to think about me every time you sit down. How does that sound?”
Michael nodded. “Be sure to keep a record of your payments for his school. Since you are going to be part of the family, we’ll want to cover those kinds of expenses for you. I wouldn’t want something like that coming out of the personal funds you’ll receive to spend for yourself.”
“Don’t be sorry. Everyone goes through rough patches. Let’s just get you taken care of, okay?” Dean sits on the bed and wraps the quilt around Castiel’s shoulders. “You’ve got to let someone help you, okay? Whatever you’re fighting, you don’t have to do it alone. If you’d rather talk to Meg, I’ll call her and give you some space.”
“Can you sit up to drink? You’re going to sweat out a lot of water, and you need to stay hydrated. How hot are you right now?”
“This is one of our favorites.” Castiel put Jack in a chair with a booster seat and sat down next to him to cut up his waffle for him.
“Look, I have an explanation. It’s a shitty one and it doesn’t justify what I did, but I need to take care of you first. What was the last meal you ate?”
“Why did you do this for me? Why are you helping me? Are you just some kind of gay saint that helps guys figure out that they like dudes?” Dean asks, his brows scrunched.
Dean tried to focus on his work, but it was getting increasingly difficult. He sighed and ran his hands through his hair, trying to shake out the thoughts of the human. He needed to focus. There were other files and cases that needed his attention.
Sam nodded. His body was tight from embarrassment as he sat down. “Sorry I growled back. I wasn’t really thinking about it.”
Dean nods. “Yeah, I do. It’s a pretty nifty service. I’ve noticed that you ride a bike every day. Is that easier?”
Castiel watched Dean with a smile. “I never thought we would have this, even if only for a little while.”
Dean nods. “Yup. It’ll be a good trip. I’ll probably take Sammy on a short road trip around the area before Christmas. I’m coming back the day before New Years Eve for Gabriel’s party.”
Dean laid back down against the pillows, letting out a breath that turned into a whine. “I just-fuck… I, I need…”
Moving from the dorms into a house was a massive upgrade. Castiel had stayed in a dorm for his freshman year, was an RA his second year, and now he was living off-campus in a little house. It was a good progression.
Gabriel was sitting on the couch, playing on his phone. He turned when he heard Dean. “Hey. You ready?”
“So, tell me about yourself, Dean. I’ve read what you put on your description, but that all feels a little impersonal.”
Dean placed himself on the couch and relaxed, trying to focus on the TV. He picked out Once Upon a Time in the West, one of his favorite western movies. He truly tried to focus on the movie, but all he could think about was how Castiel’s scent changed when he started going into heat. Just the thought alone riled Dean up a little like he was in heat again.
“Brush your fingers through the feathers, take out any damaged feathers, and pull the debris out. I can feel the sticks and leaves in there.”
“Alright, I’ll get your discharge papers in order so you can leave first thing in the morning. You’re doing good now, but the other doctors just want to keep an eye on you for a night so that they can make sure you’re okay.”
When Dean pulls back from the kiss, they’re enveloped in a feathery cocoon. Dean brushes his fingers over the feathers and smiles softly. “This...This is easier than I thought it would be.”
Meg worked during the day on Friday, so Castiel took Jack to the playground at the local park. He remembered driving by this park a few times while he was still with Luke. Jack always liked the swings the best, so Castiel placed him in one of the toddler swings and pushed him gently. Nothing gave him more joy than hearing Jack laugh.
Dean gets Sam started on a conversation about school and the car is filled with a buzz of conversation between Sam and Dean. Castiel focuses on the road and smiles as he listens to the brothers.
“I guess we did. But, I didn’t get to say all that I wanted to say and I’ve been thinking about our situation.”
Castiel brings in a few more armfuls of things from his car. He puts his sheets and comforter on the bed, curtains on the curtain rod, and spreads out his toiletries in the bathroom. He sets out a few of his trinkets on his desk and plugs in his laptop.
Zachariah tilts his head. “I know what you’re doing. You know, this is the one place your little friend can’t find you. He knows you’re here, but Heaven is big. It’ll take him hours, maybe even days to find you.”
Castiel raises a brow at just how much there is and at how the alcohol isn’t bottom shelf alcohol like he usually drank. The vodka is Grey Goose, the Jack Daniels is pretty nice, and the beer isn’t Natural Light, for once. Dean always bought Bud Light, but Gabriel has some brand that Castiel only recognizes as the expensive beers. They are drinking good tonight.
Dean reached down and took Castiel’s cock into his hand, stroking it in time with his thrusts. With that added pleasure, Castiel only lasted a few more seconds, crying out Dean’s name as he came and popped a knot.
The door opened and a familiar head of golden hair poked in. “Hey, kiddo. Just wanted to ask how tonight went. Mostly because I could smell your distress from the hall.”
“We’d still have a day. At least until tonight, when they get home. Luke never comes to this side, he won’t know. Michael stays at work as late as he possibly can while you’re in heat, he hates the temptation of the smell. It’ll be a long time before he’s back, and he’ll run straight to his room to get away if he smells anything. If we time it right, we could get another 24 hours. No pressure to conform to your heat. We can go slow, do whatever we want. As long as I get you really worked up right around the time Michael gets home, he won’t suspect a thing.” Castiel took Dean’s hand and squeezed it gently. “Worst case scenario, he wonders why it isn’t as intense, and we say it was the last wave finishing up. He won’t walk in here. I’m sure of it.”
He lets his head fall back and stares up at the ceiling of his car. He goes over what he wants to say in his head over and over. This can’t be that bad. Even if he gets turned down, it won’t mean that he will never be with Dean. There’s no way he could screw it up so bad that Dean will never want to be with him, right?
“Then we go from there, but I’m not sure that’s the case. Let’s try this: no sex or kink for a week. Let’s focus on the non-sexual side of our relationship and see what happens, okay? No need to jump to the worst case scenario.”
Dean finds Castiel’s hand and holds it tightly. “I think that sounds perfect. It’s a little scary, thinking about eternity, but eternity sounds nice when it’s spent with you.”
Dean tries to tell Gabriel how thankful he is with his eyes before turning back to the group. “I’ll play beer pong with someone.”
Once everything was packed, Gabriel hugged Dean. “Good luck. Call me if you need anything at all. If you ever need a place to stay in Chicago, my doors are open.”
“There was a silver lining. I became a guardian angel. I loved it. I watched over many different humans in my time doing it. They were all so special, and I loved them so much. I couldn't directly interfere with them, which was hard, but I still gave them whispers and signs, pointing them in the right direction. The worst part was the war, and my last human. She was killed by demons in her own home, hiding away.”
Castiel climbs into bed and slides under the covers, holding his arms out to Dean. “That’s alright, I’m ready to sleep too.” He wraps an arm around Dean once he’s close enough and holds him close. Feeling the warm body of his boyfriend against his chest again is just what he needs to fall asleep.
Sam crosses his arm. “Fine, jerk.” He meets Castiel’s eyes in the rearview mirror. “Uh, hi. I’m Sam.”
Dean looked at the bed and saw that his bedspread was gone, and all that was left was white sheets and a simple grey blanket. “Oh, thanks. That’s really nice of you.” Dean paused. “Before we even talk about this, you had a choice about this, right? No one is making you help me?”
Castiel took his sweet time with Dean. He kissed all over his body and really took the time to learn how he ticked. He never got the chance before this to discover how sensitive Dean’s nipples were.
Castiel swallowed and balled up a fistful of the sheets in one hand. He was in a corner now. There was no way he’d let Luke tell Michael what was going on and get Dean kicked out of here. Things were finally good, and Dean was happy. How could Castiel take that away from him? “Okay.”
“Your knot, duh. Speaking of, you should use a condom. I just started suppressants, but I am not getting pregnant again. Not after how bad it was last time. I can’t do it again.”
They stepped into the shower and scrubbed themselves clean of the sweat and grime. It was refreshing, and exactly what they needed to calm down. Dean shoved away every nagging thought about what just happened and replaced them with how happy he was to be with Castiel. There was no point in freaking out or moping. It was done and there was nothing they could do.
“Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!” He shouts, gripping his own hair in his hands. Tears slip from his eyes and roll down his cheeks, wetting the blankets still covering his lower half. “Leave me alone! Please, please just shut up! Shut up!”
Castiel carried Dean to the bathroom and set him down on the edge of the tub. He turned the water on and waited for it to heat up.
Castiel huffs. There were times when Meg’s pushy nature was too much. There were times when he wished she knew how to back off. He forced himself to make eye contact with her. “I’m not lying. He’s not ready.” He holds eye contact afterwards, willing his face to stay sincere.
Castiel starts to say something else, but then Dean is parking the car in the lot outside Gabriel’s apartment. It’s one of the nicest apartment buildings in downtown Athens. Athens didn’t have big high rises or massive complexes, but this was as close as they got. The building was about five stories tall and the apartments had massive windows and balconies.
Castiel felt for Kelly and promised to help her in any way he could. She had a hard pregnancy, and she lived alone. Castiel went to her house after class and work just to keep her company. They became good friends, and Castiel grew attached to her unborn son. Kelly even asked Castiel to be his godfather.
Luke huffed. “You don’t care that I’m about to expose the secret that Castiel has tried desperately to keep?”
Castiel looks at Jo. “We weren’t ready.” The last thing he wants is for the blame of the secret relationship to fall on Dean.
For Christmas, Sam flew to Chicago for a few days, the 22nd and 23rd of December. Dean used some of his personal funds on gifts for Sam, which included a brand new laptop, a new backpack, new shoes, and a new smartphone. It was nice to be able to give Sam such nice things. All of them had a purpose, so it didn’t feel too much like spoiling him. The laptop and backpack would be godsends for school. The kid desperately needed new shoes that weren’t falling apart, and his phone was on the verge of death as well.
“That you could be a little more down-to-earth. You can still enjoy all of that, but be humble. Accept a nice home-cooked breakfast from your fiancé and do normal things for lunch, like packing a salad or bringing in leftovers every once in a while.”
Castiel rolled his eyes with a grin. “I’m getting there.” He rolled his hips slowly, getting a feel for Dean and building up steadily. From weeks of using his fingers, he had a pretty good idea of where Dean’s sweet spot was. He shifted his angle slightly, smirking when Dean went limp and moaned. “That’s it.”
Castiel stands up and gently pushes the desk chair back into its place. “Right, that is what I came here for, isn’t it?”
Castiel frowns. “Where did you live? You’ve said you moved around a lot, but never where you lived when you moved. What kind of neighborhoods were you living in where a ten-year-old needed a gun under his pillow?”
Dean rolled up his window and leaned back in his seat, his eyes slipping closed. A nap during the ride home sounded great right now.
“Hm, well, I don’t use labels often. But if I were to label myself, I would be grey-asexual and gay.”
Castiel smiles a little at that as he closes his eyes. Sleep comes back to him in no time, and he’s out.
“I didn’t want to. I had a stupid deal with Crowley. I screwed with him a lot, and one day I pissed him off so bad that he was going to have me killed. But, he’s a businessman, so I was able to make a deal with him. Thirty years of torturing souls in exchange for not dying.”
Even after a fight, Luke and Castiel put on a good show as a couple. They walked into the company dinner like every other couple did. Castiel had mastered his polite smile and knew exactly what to say to every question.
Dean’s face flushes. “I’ve had a lot of sex, but only with women, not men. I’ve never even watched gay porn. I think I was afraid to.”
Dean finished the pack of crackers and washed it down with the water. He took a deep breath and let it out in a long sigh. “So, what do you do to entertain yourself around here?”
Castiel smiles softly and nods. “Dahlonega is nice. I’ve been up there for hiking trips a few times. I know Jo will kill me if I don’t go soon, so let’s make it a trip sometime soon.”
“No, but Michael takes me out to dinner sometimes, so I’ve seen some of the city from the car window as we were taken to restaurants. It’s not a big deal, Cas doesn’t leave either.”
Dean found the glasses in a cabinet and filled it with ice and water. He wanted to just walk back upstairs, but he felt compelled to stay. “Whatcha doing?”
“God no!” Castiel rested his elbows on his legs and put his face in his hands. He was still wearing his clothes from the day before.
“Speaking of ‘we’, where’s your friend? I thought there were two of you,” Castiel says, holding his ground now.
Dean nodded and held Michael’s arm, attempting to look affectionate. He saw Luke and Castiel exit the car and start walking inside, looking like a perfect, happy couple.
On the thirtieth, Castiel packs his bag and drives back to Athens in the evening, at seven pm. His mother had insisted he stay for dinner to miss the rush hour traffic. It ends up working out for the better, since Dean isn’t due to arrive in Athens until about ten.
“The only ones that would take that news well are Jo and Ash. The Roadhouse is a hunter hub and they know about that stuff. Hell, Jo wanted to be a hunter at one point. Her mom shut that down quickly.”
Dean nods and sets his burger down. “How long have you two been together? Y’know, you could have just said she was your girlfriend, I wouldn’t have cared-”
It was far unlike the sex they had while Dean was in heat. Castiel was so nurturing while Dean was in heat. It was slow and sometimes methodical, as there was an element of fear with Dean’s situation. Here, Castiel was more chaotic and sex-crazed. Little growls escaped his lips every time his cock brushed over Dean’s stomach. He didn’t even wait for Dean to start. He reached behind himself and started prepping himself for Dean’s cock.
