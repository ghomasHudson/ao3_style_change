Which of the various Mafia figures who claimed to have stolen the painting had really done it? Did it survive its (doubtless violent) removal from its frame? Where it was hidden, did it survive the earthquake of 1980? Did it survive careless treatment or storage by its captors? Did it survive at all?
I was learning not to keep pushing when I’d mostly carried my point—not to exact an acknowledgment that I was right, especially when I was actually wrong. I’d promised John not to condescend to him, and I hadn’t lasted a day before I was doing it again. So I said simply,
Figured it couldn’t hurt to tell him. “God, I want you,” I growled, knowing the words were redundant but determined to say them anyway. If he smirked, at least it would be a happy smirk.
He slipped out the cabin door, assuming that the duvet covering the sofa contained a sleeping fiddler. Not even a consulting fiddler: settled here for good now.
The light increased exponentially inside the temple as the moon sailed slowly into the oculus and illuminated the faces below. It was solemn, this combination of the timeless and the natural on the one hand, of the ancient and the architectural on the other. Our ancestors built a receptacle for the gifts of their gods—water, light, air—and eighteen hundred years later a thousand fortunate descendants gathered them in. I memorised the flawless arc of the moonlight moving around the coffered ceiling of the dome, to keep it in my mind palace for permanent recall.
The evening was serene, the meal all comfort food; butter chicken, garlic naan, and vegetarian korma made a cheerful mess of the table as they ate and talked. Ash caught them up on all the Caherdaniel news, family and band and village. She gave them facemasks with the band’s logo, and said they had to wear them at the concert.
And Sherlock wasn’t being driven insane by all these people, at all. Indeed, he was thinking better for the varied input and task types. The shifts in focus. The dialogue. He still wasn’t polite, he knew that from John’s occasional wince or flash of annoyance. But he didn't feel like being contemptuous or cruel, either.
For the record, Mycroft called them Asmodeus and Mephistopheles until the end of his days. Indiscriminately, of course. To him the Hellhounds were a unit.
We came back from Italy relieved and reconciled, but not in agreement. Well, that we’d both made stupid and futile mistakes, and then compounded them by not talking—on that we were in perfect agreement. Anyone would think we’d have learned permanently over the course of nine turbulent years to
It’d taken me years after Sherlock left me to come back to life, under Valentina’s gentle impetus. He'd left my heart a torched wasteland, no use to anyone else. It wasn’t until I met Rosie that I realised how thoroughly he’d moved on,
“Could I give you a rain check on that one too? It’s all part of the... suicide, and after. It may be the most important thing we have to talk about, but there’s so much in the more recent past that we need to clear up.”
This is a hermetic universe, which for a few minutes a day has only two inhabitants. They don’t even need names.
This is nothing like sharing a bed with Roberto, nothing at all. Here I feel like a box perfectly latched, a ribbon neatly tied. Every part of me in comfortable stasis. And though I’m trying not to wake John, I’m not tense or claustrophobic. I only want to stay here, right here, until he wakes, holding him and breathing him in. If this is what Roberto had felt—
safety, Rosie’s and mine, and hers; but she’d never meant to come back to us, the evidence was incontrovertible, and in the end she’d died in Morocco in a stupidly banal mishap.
The title and chapter titles are all from Graham Nash’s song “Teach Your Children Well.” And I’ve shamelessly pinched one of my favorite lines from Georgette Heyer: fellow Heyer fans will recognize it from
“Yes. Yes, I would.” Sherlock’s voice was defiant, which meant he was feeling sheepish. “She’s a friend.”
He reaches out to the instrument without the reticence he feels about reaching for Roberto. Perhaps he was not meant, after all, to be a complete human being. Perhaps he was meant to be as he is: an observer, an analyst, someone who helps when complete human beings run aground and bring him their puzzles and problems. Is that so unworthy? He listens to the patterns that he and the violin make, the logic and the beauty, the rigour and the poignancy, and thinks that perhaps John didn’t understand that Sherlock was in his own way already complete. And as always when John enters his mind, he shuts this thought down and buries it deep.
2. Are you thinking of your favorite Reichenfixits to recommend? I hope so. Put them in the comments box on any chapter! A URL is a kindness.  (Ahem: I added a sixth chapter for some stress release, so this fic will conclude on August 23rd: Sunday evening at 6 p.m. Sorry to fall short of truth in advertising! )
Typically, he already knew what it was. “No. It wasn’t your radio messages that let them know that Sherlock was alive. Morstan planted herself in your surgery on a chance, a suspicion—she had noticed the singular run of bad luck afflicting the leaders of various crime syndicates in her orbit. You didn’t endanger him. On the contrary: your warning probably saved him.”
In a loopy, cheerful script the sandwich boards outside the pub announced, “Tonight: ‘Caherdaniel,’ fresh from last week’s live concert in the Glasgow Festival. BROADCAST INTERNATIONALLY!”
But every year since that first time she couldn’t make it home for Christmas, we have a habit—it may even be a ritual—in December. After the tree arrives and sometime before Rosie does, we settle in with a whisky and one of us says,
I started haunting the shelters, and interviewing possible matches. A senior dog, maybe. Or one with an injury. Something that demanded attention and care.
Now Sherlock looks even more miserable. “Don’t remind me. But I couldn’t risk having her turn up in something like that yellow thing she wore last summer, with a floppy rag in her hair. I couldn’t have danced with her no matter what she bid. —The thing is, Molly's
“Well, yes, I love to dance. I’ve always loved it.” But that’s no reason to subject himself to another two months of organisation, anxiety, rehearsal, and ...
coffee. A fine distinction he’d finally mastered.) They met at the luxurious pastry-shop Molly favoured and he bought her a rainbow of macaroons.
“Still, you tried to love someone different. I understand why, and I’m sorry I drove you to it. But—well, when did you realise you weren’t going to be able to love him?” I felt Sherlock’s heartbeat speed up under my ear, and my own heart sank. He must be emotionally attached, then. Certainly he was silent for a long time. When he spoke, his voice seemed to have dropped an octave.
He would be blaming himself savagely when he looked back at the losses of life, and his own eighteen months on the run, that had resulted from believing Moriarty implicitly. I wanted privacy for Sherlock so he could process all of this.
I had no plan, and that seemed to be the right approach. Sherlock was open to every idea I broached for our days, whether a stay in a hilltop town strangely frozen in time with its seven (
When I came out, still ruffled but wearing my most off-putting suit and my most composed mask, John was showered and dressed, eating toast and reading the newspaper.
, John,” he murmured urgently, and I had to agree, I wanted him in my arms and considerably less clothed, so I could touch and kiss every part of him I could reach. I took a last swallow of cappuccino and stood up gingerly, painfully hard and relieved that the lift was only a few metres off. Sherlock looked wrecked, and so must I; but the little German family that stepped out of the lift looked oblivious and indifferent, and I remembered that indeed
How is it that I’m so much less self-conscious at saying such things out loud, and in the moment, than John is—John, who can talk to almost anyone, who’s so at ease in the world? But he does write a beautiful love letter. And I can’t put anything I really want to say into writing, so.
I kissed, sucked, and nipped my way along his jawline and then found his beautiful mouth again—and began to plunder it as though we were alone in the world rather than sitting at a tiny, rather uncomfortable, breakfast table with two scandalised but sympathetic hotel staff smiling uncertainly a few metres away.
Sherlock’s parents left their home looking appropriately festive before they left for Florida. I’m sure they were delighted to be there in the warmth; the snow was unpleasant to navigate, and the house a challenge to heat once the power went out.
In high summer Sneem hosted ceilidhs and sessions and concerts almost every night. But Saturday still had pride of place, and Caherdaniel was booked at the best venue in town.
Another longish silence. “I thought we’d got quite good at being candid with each other, at not letting things build and fester. Are you under the impression I’ve been chafing?”
Suddenly impatient for Mycroft to leave, I snapped, “What are you going to do about Morstan? Will you actually do a deal, even it if means letting her walk free?”
“Good luck with your case, Zanardi.” John was as collected as he’d been throughout, despite having changed our travel plans with lightning speed in response to the outside chance of our running into Roberto again in Venice. Curious.
in the room, so I’ll just go collect Sally and try to keep up with her.” Molly colours with pleasure and shakes her head
“Oh, I saw you. Sometimes, I swear, you were all I saw. I just didn’t see you... clearly.” His voice was low and rough.
When there was no more to lose, that’s when we dared. Not exactly the height of courage or honesty. But it worked, despite or because of how long we delayed and disguised. What we won by risking was no less than everything.
Sherlock could cry or laugh as John dances him into the bathroom and turns on the shower. While the water heats John scatters kisses all over, between the lines of his laughing serenade, and Sherlock thinks that all this, only twenty-four hours ago unthinkable, is now indispensable.
magnificent. Unique. But there’s so much more, and so much to see that not many tourists visit. In the winter, Sicily is nicer, of course. But spring or fall—go to Milano.”
When I finally saw him in the morgue at Bart’s, it was to consult on one of his cases that I wasn’t in on. Well, I wasn’t in on any of his work at the moment; there hadn’t been that much of it yet, after the Culverton Smith fiasco and the long aftermath of recovery. After I’d given Lestrade the go ahead I knew of just one major, clamorous case, which I hadn’t been involved with. So when I’d got the garbled message at work to turn up at Bart’s “quite quickly please,” I was out the door before the nurse had finished talking—in such a hurry I left my phone, where I imagined a series of increasingly irritated messages must be accumulating.
This is manipulative, a bit, but he has to know where John stands on Sherlock’s present status. Several weeks into recovery he hasn’t had a slip, or not one he’d let anyone see—and even then he didn’t use, just thought about it, made a half-hearted plan and then abandoned it. (Even that slip may have been a Pavlovian response to the irksome presence of Wiggins, after all.)
But when I saw John’s face so stricken I was almost sorry, and I backtracked. “I mean, Zanardi certainly looks like he’s in deep. But I’m sure it’s just a passing thing.” As if Sherlock ever did passing things.
daughter, not mine, followed hard on another first. We were at a crime scene in the early evening; we’d been there for what felt like hours, it was colder than October has any right to be, and Sherlock was drenched to the bone and depleted. He was half-kneeling, half-squatting by the body, surrounded by Klieg lights to make it easier for him to see the injuries to the neck, and as his back straightened I saw him sway. His other knee hit the ground in an effort to keep from keeling over altogether. A second later I was behind him, putting my hand on his left shoulder.
This is a hermetic universe, which for a few minutes a day has only two inhabitants. They don’t even need names.
He had a look he was comfortable with, speech patterns and a gait that had come to feel natural, but were as little like his own—no, his previous—image as could reasonably be imagined.
Walking through the tall rain-soaked grass he might have been wading through the surf; within half a mile his feet were drenched. And he didn’t give a damn. After circling the globe he was finally walking toward Sherlock. Whatever the meeting held, at this moment life was good.
“What. Happened.” Bending words to my purpose was still surprisingly difficult, and my voice didn’t sound at all like me.
“I’m sorry, sorry, I’ll tell you about it later, for now just let me look at you. —No, never mind, kiss me again.” Minutes go by and Sherlock can hear the next fast train coming into the station beneath them, a cacophony of whistle and brakes and echoing loudspeaker announcements. Still they stand there suspended over the station, as though being together will not survive coming back to earth, leaving this bubble and going—
Clearly I was supposed to fill in the blank, and I did: I groaned and covered my face with one hand. “For theorising in advance of the data.”
There was a significant delay before he answered. So the British Government didn’t like this any better than I did.
He’s still enchanted with the play of light and darkness in her dress, and watches that instead of his own feet or her face. They’re not silent for long, because she clears her throat and seems intent on saying something.
“Nothing terribly intimate, really. Please... trust me.” He captured my hands. “In one, you were sitting on a park bench, looking down at your hands. Thinking, by the look of it. I stopped after the third, told him you wouldn’t expect or want me to see any of them at all.”
against each other could reduce me to panting incoherence; it was hardly the height of erotic technique, after all. But the longer we did it, the more my focus narrowed to only that contact and that motion, that push and pull, as though what we were doing was kissing, just not with our mouths.
His own arousal grew almost distracting, and John positioned himself to get some drag along his cock from the smooth, soft duvet cover as he guided Sherlock’s hips to position him higher up on the bed. He chased down tantalising textures, his lips trailing along the pale skin of upper thigh and the darker, rougher skin of scrotum, the tightly curled pubic hair—how did a man so sparse in body hair in general end up with this delicious tangle?
I made her sit in a straight-backed chair which I’d positioned in front of the fireplace, directly aligned with the window. The chair was facing the fire, but I made her sit on it wrong way round, facing into the room. I tossed her a pair of handcuffs and told her to put her hands through the slats at the back of the chair and cuff them, or I would shoot her.
Sherlock knew he wasn’t really needed for the sting at all. After he’d solved the copycat murder, and Roberto had been called in because of the ongoing Interpol investigation, he’d expected to back out of the case and stay out. The players in the ring had been identified, and sweeping them up in the net had required not Sherlock’s skill set but rather three weeks of massive surveillance and coordination among a set of agencies with different stakes in the outcome. But Roberto, his motive all too clear, had asked him to be there at the dénouement.
, not even leaving him the freedom to choose with whom, and when, and why he would be unfaithful to me.)
“As soon as he contacts me, of course. I’ve left a message in two secure locations—virtual locations—but he hasn’t picked them up. He’s gone much longer than this without being in touch; I’m not worried. Yet. And there’s been some activity in Serbia that might have his signature on it.”
Still, it was terrifying. He was about to whisper “May I?” when John surged up and kissed him, and all of Sherlock’s senses were flung wide open. He’d never known he could burn in every inch of him, hear John’s breath and his murmur, his own heart pounding louder than the wind in the stovepipe. If he had known, he’d never have left, not ever.
Thank you all for reccing fics, your own and others'. How generous you are to stock the larder with new things to read! There's never a shortage in this fandom, quite the opposite. But I'm assuming from your comments on
Some have been lost already, sadly. Mike Stamford, gone before his time in the pandemic of 2020. Mrs Hudson, at least a timely loss. Our own parents gradually failing, probably on their last visit to warmer climes in winter. It all brought me and my brother a bit closer, despite still sniping and bickering.
“Hullo? I’m sorry to bother you. It’s John Watson again. Yes, from London. Listen, I’ve spent hours trying to track down these musicians, and I can’t find any hint of a singer or a group called Clare Daniel.”
He huffed as though I was saying nothing he didn’t know; but I know him, I saw from his glances that he hadn’t thought of his paralysis in quite those terms. Well, how could he have done, shaken as he was?
John’s bark of laughter was abrupt enough to startle even himself. “You know, years ago I’d have said no. Now I’m going to say yes, thank you, and hallelujah, because I
On instinct he pocketed the mobile, took out his own, and called Lestrade. It was Donovan who answered.
True to his word, on the Thursday Mycroft called my burner phone. Said he couldn’t tell me everything, but that I was right about my steel magnolia admirer, and that I should give her some very minimal encouragement to keep her in place and trying. Before I could object that I could hardly
If it hadn’t been for the tension, taut almost to the snapping point, it would have been anticlimactic. Correction: it decidedly was anticlimactic. My next step was a stumble, and John reached me in time to steady me. I felt his hands on my biceps, then on my shoulders, then on my back as he pulled me stiffly to him.
If I haven't said lately how much I love comments, here I am saying it again: anything from emojis to secret code! But also: 2020 is a steep challenge for almost everyone, and no one should add "must ... comment ... on ... fic" to their to-do list. To quote a wise man, "it's all fine."
He spent the day in a dressing-gown and a haze of boredom, his fingertips too sore to play again. Keeping out of trouble was his only accomplishment of the day. But it was something, given the emptiness of a holiday on his own. And when had
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and said, “I just said. My own preference would be to not spend another night apart, John. Returning to 221B without you would be a very grey homecoming. But you decide. Watson’s our priority.”
—is as good as mine. It certainly turned a knife in the wound. But somehow it didn’t feel ill-intentioned. Maybe he meant it to be motivational. If so, it worked.”
“I have little time for or interest in emotions. I have, moreover, limited—experience with a sexual partner. I have a longstanding difficulty with human interaction: I find people easy to read but impossible to deal with. And I’m afraid that my heart, such as it is, belongs to someone else—and has done for so long that I don’t know if I can change that habit. Nor do I really want to enter into any consuming relationship. My work benefits most from stable routines and predictable patterns. And my work has been everything to me.”
Slowly, doggedly, I settled on a method. I’d proceed in chronological order from the death itself. Assemble all the sources and facts I could—excluding Sherlock’s family, especially Mycroft. If anything was being concealed about his death, Mycroft already knew it and hadn’t told me. That meant that he wasn’t going to, and
In the dimness I could just make out his smile. “But I met his mother out in the wilds of Lazio. I think he’d been waiting to see how things went with her before springing me on his family, or putting the pressure of
As I talked about this part I was wrapped around John, touching every part of him that I could reach, my ear pressed over his chest, listening as I always did to his breath and his heartbeat. He was utterly still. I think he knew much of it. Perhaps he had asked Mycroft at some point; I didn’t inquire. But when I related my return to London, retrieving my identity and my appearance, setting out to the restaurant to find him, he grew agitated again, shifting and taking jerky breaths. He cut off my account, saying roughly,
I went downstairs to ask Mrs H, while Sherlock exchanged texts with Donovan. When I came back up he handed me his phone, gesturing for me to read through the text conversation.
The rest is history. John Watson and the little general have been the making of Sherlock, and the foundation of a community that comes very close to being a family. Certainly the three of them have expanded my own circle of people I must at all costs keep safe, on the grounds that they are too dear to lose.
To me, he explained that his phone was set to silent for all numbers but mine, which vibrated. (Trust Sherlock to find a way to triage his calls and messages.) I was somewhat flattered but nowhere near mollified to be the one person who could reach him when he was
In the event, though, the crowd and the roar made for a comfortable kind of complicity, hunched over their small table to hear each other. He made it through nearly an hour of conversation without either boredom, or untoward deductions; Zanardi was
I’ve been staring at this blank page for a long time now. Don’t know where to go next. You might not read this for weeks and maybe it isn’t fair to try to make you read it at all. You’ve moved on.
The Friday afternoon Ash was due to arrive Sherlock found he couldn’t settle. With John at the surgery he could take it out on the fiddle without scruple; he’d been overdoing it for even the most devoted partner and fan. He went down to tuck the key to the street door where Ash was to look for it.
“What did you tell him, that man you spoke to?” Meanwhile Sherlock turned his own body at a ninety-degree angle to Roberto’s, to give himself more cover from the others and more leverage for the novel and completely ill-timed stroking he couldn’t seem to stop.
She’d clearly noticed that John had stopped coming by; whenever she wanted to, then, she picked up the phone and demanded he bring Watson over for a visit. On the one hand, Sherlock had been glad of any occasion to see them; on the other, her constant interventions blurred the signal, making it hard to know at what intervals John
He might sound languid, but Sherlock wanted intel: he never could stand loose ends. Neither of us had any idea that Morstan’s story would turn everything we knew upside-down.
The next few days were subdued but not troubled. Sherlock was thinking things through, but without apparent distress or self-blame. He was so tired, so much in need of restoration, that it was easier than I’d expected to distract him from obsessing too much. Not to mention, I had a secret weapon—as did he.
I rang off and went back inside the bar to Valentina, who was looking more hopeful than when she’d accosted me so tentatively outside of headquarters. Perhaps she’d just needed a listening ear—or an ear she thought was listening, since I wasn’t entirely sure I’d caught even a rough outline of her case and its details. I’d retained only the call I needed to make the next morning, to press a lab director who owed me a favour to fast-track a blood sample analysis for Valentina, to save her precious time and pointless floundering.
John’s third request, another four weeks on, had been a song from the first world war. It was strangely intimate for the scenario it was supposed to narrate: a soldier missing his dead friend. The melody, too, was a bit saccharine.
“Does it change anything? Knowing that?” He wasn’t going to let this go, and perhaps he was right to pursue the point.
“Well, you locked us in. All those dates, the ‘I’m not gay.’ I thought my only hope was to batter you with serial brilliance.”
it. Almost the first moment I saw him, heard him. But he left me, and I’d been angry at him for so long that I hadn’t even known anymore how to love him without hating him too.
Something was hovering at the outer limit of his attention, but he couldn’t put his finger on what it was. Ash was directing quizzical glances his way—what was that about? What was he missing?
As I thought of a solitary life in London, Robert began to stir beside me, making the pleased, affectionate noises that I could not make and would not feign. Instead I ran my hand over the arm pushing in on my breastbone, let it drop down to his (beautiful) hip, and looked back to meet his eyes, sleepy but desirous and fond. I knew I should want to, but it felt like an effort. I pushed down the thought that in fact I’d already decided. Ten days to go. I couldn’t have John, I couldn’t want Roberto, and this interlude was now almost certainly a formality. I was marking time.
He’s touched that he himself has been bid for—as number 221b, no less, just like Sherlock's sense of humour. When he tells the two young PCs handling the bids, "My mad flatmate signed me up," he learns that Sherlock isn't just here for the dancing, but has virtually engineered the entire event. And oh, John has questions.
He looked the opposite of sleepy. In the years since we’d come back to 221B together we had never got this tangled up in unspoken anger and hurt (and where had that even
I still couldn’t be sure that it was him, but my heart nearly stopped when the message he sent back was
“I ... knew that, after you left in November. But I needed to hear it all the same. And it isn’t unforgivable, you know. You aren’t unforgivable. I forgave you a long time ago. Somewhere in Nepal.”
He stared out down the dewy green slope toward the bay, now dull and just barely visible through the trees. Yesterday, the evening sun had burnished it.
For years our daily hour was sacrosanct. Even once Watson no longer napped, by mutual consent we prolonged the ritual for about 12 years longer than we’d have had any right to hope.
Just touching the border was almost unendurably arousing; what would happen if he actually breached it? Combustion, he could only imagine.
That melted something in me I hadn’t been aware had been frozen. He’d had been ready to make them pay. (If Mycroft hadn’t already eliminated them, John might have forgiven me sooner. Food for thought.)
Fair enough. When I was dating I didn’t announce it to him, either. Never needed to, for that matter. He’d always beat me to it. “Date shirt, I see.” “For pity’s sake, John, with
I regretted leaving my black glass infatuation, but Venice was indeed too crowded now: walking to our airport transport took twice as long as it should have, for the crowds.
I didn’t contact Sherlock again that evening, not even to explain why we hadn’t come. Day after day I got Rosie up and fed and dressed, and got her to daycare. I went to work, practised the dullest kind of medicine as conscientiously as my fractured concentration would allow, picked Rosie up, took her home. And thought about what I’d seen.
But when I got to Baker Street no light showed in the windows. I should’ve texted first, but this was far too important for a text. Gritting my teeth against the idea of finding Zanardi there, I let myself in—quietly, to avoid an encounter with Mrs Hudson. Though I knew what I wanted to say to Sherlock, I didn’t know what to say to her at this point; and I wasn’t sure I wanted to hear what she might say to me.
I missed him with a pain as caustic and searing as the day it happened. Whatever I thought about the Incident, what I
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday passed in the most bone-deep satisfying way a honeymoon could possibly offer. Love, art, laughter, music, intimacy, architecture, complicity, food, rest, walking, the idlest of light shopping, sleep, waking, lust, satiation, talking, silence, all in the company of the most companionable of men. Every day marked by the reflected shimmer of the green water on the walls and ceilings of the city, and the absurdly labyrinthine layout of its streets.
“Clearly. I haven’t been this relaxed since I left London,” he answered. Well, it wasn’t going to be me telling him that his baritone didn’t just sound relaxed, it sounded languorous. Sated. Any idiot could have deduced our changed status from that voice.
of Sherlock, his scent of exertion, of arousal, has John almost helpless as he buries his nose in Sherlock’s chest.
The first time I tried, I had to abort. It wasn’t a full-on panic attack, but returning to the scene put my whole body and brain into adrenal overdrive. I turned back to the cab and got back in before I could scream, or hyperventilate, or faint.
John doesn’t know Mary’s past the way Sherlock does; he’s never seen even the whole file on the data stick, let alone Mycroft’s cache of evidence. But then John doesn’t know Sherlock’s past, either. The two and half years away. Every enemy he’d tracked and eliminated in pursuit of Moriarty’s underlings, to keep his own people alive back in London. The mistakes he’d made and the innocents he’d harmed. Failed. Killed.
Without any experience in seducing a man I was less hesitant than I had expected to be: everything about him made me hungry to touch, and when I alternated a tight grip and soft strokes up and down, he almost collapsed against me. By then he was pulling my clothes off too, nuzzling me wherever my skin appeared, so that I was groaning again with pleasure and desire.
They all started, looking a little sheepish. Sherlock came to draw me over and kiss me, a bit unsteadily, under the mistletoe, while Mrs Hudson braced the ladder and Rosie sang out, “Deck the halls, Da!
—put him in a new light altogether. Sherlock could see Roberto’s mind working as fast and as fluidly as his body, which was sheer muscle laced with grace. Dead sexy, indeed.
a stab in the heart: it had been so hideously, painfully long. He released John and turned away, feeling exposed himself now. Which was ridiculous.
So when he muttered something about not being “emotional,” something idiotic like “you know that’s not part of my makeup, John,” well, I snapped. I was in the kitchen making tea and slammed the kettle down with a bang.
It had taken weeks and weeks of talking with Ella, endless talking (she might say endless silences), before he was ready to broach it with Sherlock. All those hours with Ella, fighting himself and fighting her. Even though he was there of his own accord he’d tried to deflect, evade, and lock her out, but she was calmly implacable. Eventually he’d had to look certain truths in the eye: some truths about Mary, certainly, but mostly about himself.
“I –” Sherlock closes his eyes, opens them again. “I never meant to hurt you, John. I was selfish, I thought only of myself when I injected. You have Mary now, I didn’t think my being gone would – affect your life, very much.”
No response comes from Sherlock beyond a telling hitch in his breath and the erratic rise and fall of his shoulders.
“… Pyeterson’s body or, well, what was left of it anyway,” Lestrade is saying in a hushed voice to Sherlock that nonetheless carries if one strained (and John was certainly straining). John startles so much at the confirmation of his hunch he almost drops the bag of coffee beans.

,” Holmes gasps, when they finally break apart. One of his hands has made their way into Watson’s hair; the other around the back of his neck. “
The bomb on the train carriage safely switched off, Sherlock straightens to face John on his knees, because if he doesn’t say it now, doesn’t get it off his chest, he doesn’t know how he ever will.
to get us caught?” Sherlock hissed, tugging John back as his frenetic pacing threatened to blow their tenuous tree-cover.
Sherlock huffed and pretended to be duly offended. The tea was made and drunk without incident (although Sherlock had had to throw out his milk-curdling experiment because John protested that it was ‘stinking up the fridge,
!) takes a sip of the drink. The appreciative groan that emerges from his mouth is positively orgasmic. John not-so-guiltily files it away mentally; he’ll revisit that noise whenever he’s feeling especially lonely, he decides.
(He wasn’t really. There was a trumpeting fanfare marching around his Mind Palace. He felt the same rush of exhilaration he’d felt that first night, standing by an ambulance with a shock blanket around his shoulders, looking across the sea of swarming police officers and medics to meet John’s steady gaze, and knowing in his heart that John had just shot the cabbie to save him.)
John takes a seat next to him, grimacing at the metal slates pressing against his legs, the cold seeping through his jeans. He glances over at his companion, the question
Mary purses her lips, expression tight, and doesn't say anything, though the gun at John's throat does dig in a little harder. Sherlock winces in sympathy.
John rolled his eyes, a fond grin on his face that made the edges of his eyes crinkle. “Dinner as in a date, Sherlock. C’mon, I’ll tell Angelo to bring out every candle he owns and –” John’s face fell. “Sher – Sherlock, are you okay?”
It was obviously painful for him to admit that John had other priorities now. John’s replaced him, I thought, but he hasn’t replaced John.
For perhaps the thousandth time since Bologna, I put my jealousy in cold storage. I looked to see where the fuck I actually was: seven minutes from the hospital and forty-five from Baker Street. I could shower and change into scrubs at the hospital, so I turned that way.
Before the last word was out Sherlock was kissing my mouth, answering the question without speaking, for a very long time. His kiss was both tender and firm, and his tongue caressed mine with a meaning I couldn’t mistake. For a long time this chased all thought from my mind: for so long I’d thought we’d never have this, ever. So we kissed, held each other, kissed again.
And finally, lying here in the pale expanse of this alien bed, I realised why: I’d been trying to choose Roberto. Tried to put him in John’s place, the place John vacated when he returned to Mary, pushed me away, pushed me at Irene. But I was never going to be able to replace John, because I’d never deliberately chosen him. When I met him, he overpowered me without any conscious thought or choice on my part. He’d walked undramatically, unequivocally, and implacably into my head and my heart, and simply never left. More than a meeting, it was than a recognition.
over?” He’s asked something similar, earlier, so I thought this was a fair question, even though we weren't meant to be discussing Mary tonight. (My voice was still not quite my own.)
. It’d always been obvious she did aerobic dance, fitness, Pilates, all that gym rot, but I hadn’t seen that she was an actual dancer. Well, there’s always something.
The clapping and cheering went on forever. It wasn’t an athletic dance but I was still breathless at the end of it, and the roar of applause let me calm my breathing and look round for my usual target. Who was right there, staring at me. With stars in his eyes.
I take his left hand and bring it to my mouth, leaving soft kisses all along the back of it, turning it over, kissing his palm. I hear him sigh. Not desire, though. Confusion, maybe. Disbelief.
My head pillowed on his thigh, my hands wandering, I felt my cheeks wet and my heart pounding as we came down from what felt like, again, the first time.
Needless to say, reading the detailed report listing the visual inventory of the injuries was a surreal experience that flattened me again. Stomach-turning and soul-destroying. What hadn’t been broken in Sherlock’s fall would make a shorter list than what had.
John gave a headshake and a sigh. “I’ve come to think that who we are—is our set of relationships. The ones that last, I mean. You and Ciaran can make it, Ash. It’s hard now, I know.”
“Have at it, I’ve better things to look at,” he said, kneeling at the bedside and instantly absorbed in the sight of Sherlock’s lovely, lovely cock tucked sweetly between his long, lean thighs.
misrepresenting his real motivations: John, who can’t even admit that what he’s angry about is not being excluded but being supplanted. John, who’s so very not-gay that he can’t even acknowledge that he’s not afraid for Sherlock, he’s
“When you came back alive from being dead, this is all I wanted. I couldn’t admit it then. Who gets that miracle, a return from the dead? I thought I was furious. How could I misunderstand my own feelings that badly?”
“I know. You’ve said.” John shifted again, turning his head again into my chest, into my shoulder. His voice was bitter, as it always was when he talked about my supposed suicide. I couldn’t blame him; I’d admitted that by saving his life I’d caused him the kind of pain I was too cowardly to risk for myself.
—it was refreshing and we were both so thirsty. Sherlock, distractingly appealing in pajama bottoms, lounged in the doorway, then detached himself from the doorframe and went to peer at one of the photographs on the wall. It was a standard-issue Happy Families shot, Giulia and I in the middle, Luca and Chiara on either side, Luca holding the leash of our (mostly) German shepherd Maia. Ben Nevis was in the background, and we were all wearing rain gear.
He doesn’t seem to need any further reassurance, lowering his head to thrust his face between my thighs so that his freshly shaven chin and jaw glide smoothly up and then down along my bollocks. When he takes one between his teeth, then into his mouth, and then the other, I hear myself make a startled sound that I absolutely cannot control. It’s ... perfect. I’ve always known that with John it would be. It’s far better than my longstanding fantasy.
John quizzed Sherlock on the planets they passed, gave him news of Mrs Hudson and Molly and Lestrade, and stiffly practised saying “Will.” It sounded absurd.
John was delighted with the one she’d chosen. I spent a few moments wondering whether “all” meant “wishing all three of you the best,” or “wishing the two of you all the best,” and if the latter, was it sarcastic. John reminded me that she wouldn’t have gone to the trouble and expense solely to be sarcastic. He was probably right, and it was just an unexpectedly kind gesture.
more lavishly endowed than he’d deduced. John’s cock was—not to put too fine a point upon it—tantalising. Literally succulent.
He pulled away from me and went over to his chair, slumped down into it. His brows were drawn together, mouth twisted. I hate it when John’s unhappy. Hate it a thousand times more when it’s on my account. I tried to think how to salvage this evening without either making light of his distress, or making it seem justified.
In your letter you wrote that you only realised you'd been hoping I would stay, when I left you to go back to Mary. Just a few hours afterwards you shot Magnussen in the head. Is that why you shot him? I wonder now if it was. What you said that night always sounded so stilted to me. “Give Mary my love. Tell her she’s safe now.” Rehearsed. God knows I’ve heard your voice saying those words in my head a thousand times, no matter what the doctored recordings say now. Did you commit murder (suicide?) because I went back to her?
Everything had exploded into noise and blinding lights and the amplified boom of an officious DCC intoning that the building was surrounded and that everyone was to freeze and drop their weapons. Did criminals ever actually do that? Did the police expect them to? These didn’t, at any rate; shooting wildly they scattered for the exits, each hoping to escape while the others got stopped. Not really a rational hope when there were literally dozens of agents inside and outside the warehouse.
We arranged to meet at her favourite restaurant outside Cassino—I never miss an opportunity to eat there either—and to drive to the house afterwards, in two cars. Sherlock seemed fine with the arrangement, if not enthusiastic.
“What kind of arrest were you making last night? We didn’t mean to stumble into the thick of it.” I kept my voice neutral.
As it happened, after mid-February, it was impossible for me to check the playlist of the radio programme until well into March. I was deep undercover in a human trafficking operation being run out of Peshawar. But I kept worrying at the problem, gnawing at it whenever I could afford to be less than hypervigilant. When I re-surfaced in Delhi, my first priority after debriefing was to catch up with John’s songs. The Sunrise Cyber Café on Connaught Place seemed a suitable venue; it was full of backpacker tourists.
When I glanced over he looked so pinched and wretched that it was suddenly obvious that this was not only his own unfailing compassion; this was something he’d known himself. When had he ever—oh.
John expected this to trigger one of Sherlock’s dismissals of surface attractiveness, but instead he just sounded curious: “Why?”
When we returned to Baker Street later in March, he’d had my old room upstairs redone as a nursery. A little cocoon of orderly heaven, just right for the baby she was and the little girl she would become. And when he walked her round the sitting-room, pointing at things and saying their names for her, I realised they were all B’s: bat, books, bison, Billy the skull. So. Ba.
“But I love it, John. I love the way you smell. I always have. And I’ve missed it so much. You’ll just have to get used to it.”
Some are deliberately murky, at least enough that if they should be deciphered you’d be shocked but thrilled. “Sherlock is really a girl’s name.”
One last bit: 5 years and 2 months ago today I left burnt offerings in the comments box of "Last Call," but never remembered to hit the kudos button until today. Because downloaded as a pdf, etc. 😶 🙄 😬
. I never meant to take anything away from you. I’ll bring it back. I will. Sooner than you can imagine.
“Not much sense, no. But it’s a nice thought, that you weren’t afraid I was turning Watson into a mini-me.”
My solitary mission was useless now, unsustainable, and even more dangerous for John than my open re-appearance. I raced back to London, to Baker Street, without even stopping to see my brother. Panicked that I’d find John already gone—in one way or another.
Rosie had gone to daycare until she was three, then hit a patch where she took against it. Didn’t want to go. Wailed when we dressed her to leave, howled when we dropped her off, rocketed out the door into our arms when we picked her up. Whatever was going on—a phase in her development, or something wrong at the daycare that she couldn’t express to us—it wasn’t worth making her miserable, I thought, and Sherlock agreed.
Two days later I left my letter with Mrs Hudson, directing her to put it into John’s hands if he should come to Baker Street, or to mail it to him in a week if he didn’t. When she took it I felt something odd in my chest, a phantom ache, but I jolted my attention back from what I was leaving to what I was going toward: a trip to Heathrow, a flight to Rome. I was packed and 221B locked up; somehow I had to be ready mentally and physically as well.
He spent the next hour or so scowling thunderously at the three or four photos that the British government sent along. Afterwards, while I was wrapping Christmas presents, I could see him deep in thought: not Mind Palace maintenance, but ordinary extraordinary-mortal thought. I set tea by his elbow and he ignored it until it went cold and was replaced by another cup.
She pronounced “amateur” in French. Mycroft’s face: I've not seen anything like it since I was a child.
Sherlock’s Monday is free, like all the days. Unstructured time has always made him unproductive, but this month has been chosen for this: free of contacts, commitments, cases. The effect is different than when Sherlock was in London between cases, abroad between missions. He’s never had this: empty time he can fill as he chooses, without feeling the desperate need for stimulation or distraction. For a challenge or cocaine.
I kept an eye out in case Moran had left anyone keeping watch, but saw no one. I didn’t take the quickest way back out to Baker Street. If any neighbours had heard the shots they were keeping their heads down, but very possibly calling the police; so I headed down the street, showing no hurry at all. I’d give things some time to calm down—there were supplies to get at the Tesco twenty minutes away. Having no way to text Sherlock, I texted that to Mycroft.
He actually shivers, but pretends to sigh and roll his eyes. He sets the temperature and water pressure the way we like it, then turns to pull off my dressing gown, my shirt, my trousers and pants. When John undresses me I go weak in the knees every time. He pushes me under the hot water and a moment later steps in. He was right: the hot water is heavenly, warming me right through, but I need John.
“You’re the one, all right. You’re the one for me. You’re the one I’ve been dying to do this with, wake up next to. And now I am. That’s me ecstatic, then.”
Some years ago, in 2034, Sherlock’s daughter was stranded in Rome on Christmas Eve, when all the flights out of central and northern Italy were canceled.
, how do I keep forgetting, he always knows the right thing to do to keep us both at the same fever pitch, at the same pace. My focus blurred at the sensation of the hot wet of his mouth around my bollocks, his firm hand around my shaft. I don’t know how long, it might have been seconds or minutes before I came with a sob of gratitude echoed by the sounds I heard from Sherlock.
“I wondered whether Julian would stay for dinner. You get along very well.” He was rather pleased at how serene he sounded.
different, and how glad I was of that. I’d fallen in love with him as he was, after all; the things I’ve always relished about him—his brilliance, his asperity, his impatient sense of humour, his core of unbending decency, his sheer eye-watering beauty—they’re all still there.
So I contacted the headmistress of Rosedale School (who makes up these names, anyway? Not a rose or a dale anywhere near the place) and asked to meet with her. It was a few streets south of 221B, well into the genteel-ish area that always annoys Harry when she comes. She likes to play up our very different upbringing, hers and mine, from Sherlock’s; but he’s on to her now, never rises to the bait. They’re finally on good terms, after all.
I hurried to clarify. “No, no, I mean, you’d no one to share the leg work, talk things through with you. You had to do it all on your own. I’ve learned how hard that is.”
.” I seemed to hear him say it from a long way off; my ears were ringing, our breathing was loud, and he may have had to repeat himself before I registered that he wanted me to stop. Very reluctantly I did stop, and looked a question at him.
Self-serving: not so fast. Sherlock Holmes brought a mass of observation and detail to the case, including quite a bit that I’d missed. He laid it all out in an accessible sequence, not making Lestrade or his team (or me, hunched unobtrusively in a corner) guess or press for clarification or information. He was clearly on Lestrade’s side, not a rival, and he seemed to take the gravity and scope of the crisis to heart. Not that self-serving, then. And for that matter, not an amateur, either.
I've got a brother, and I don’t need another one. But having a brother meant I also had a tone, a pattern, ready to move into when we got better acquainted: a kind of teasing that was brisk but not mean. It worked, anyway. Talking got more comfortable the longer we danced together; and dancing got more comfortable the more we talked or texted.
I took him by the shoulders and kissed him until I felt his shoulders start to relax. He had a little smile by the time he hung up his coat and started for the sitting room. Then:
Oh, for Christ’s sake. Of course he’s still spying on Sherlock all the hours God sends. No wonder his version of caring makes Sherlock grind his teeth. But still. It could be the most discreet way to find out what the fuck is going on.
After a moment he answered: “It isn’t only the cold. There’s a specific kind of exhaustion that comes of never being sure you’ll be allowed to stay where you are. Of thinking someone’s coming presently to move you along.”
And that was that. Within minutes his breathing had slowed and deepened into sleep, while I lay awake a bit longer and thought about our two intense moments of communion that day. Strangely bipartite: lovemaking, and talking. I wondered how much of both was down to our encounter with Roberto.
His sharp intake of breath made John’s head snap up, and just like that, each was staring wide-eyed at the visible evidence of the other’s desire with no pretense of looking at anything or anyone else. Sherlock straightened slowly, John took a step toward him and reached for him, murmuring, “beautiful, so beautiful, I’ve...” but unable to finish the thought. “John, you...” was as far as Sherlock got before he simply reached out and grasped.
“Listen. It’s not about attraction. I can find people beautiful without wanting to ... you know. And someone can ... flirt at me, if they want, but unless I flirt back, you shouldn’t spend a second being uncomfortable about it.”
My own heartbeat wasn’t exactly steady either as I let my fingers wander over the trim curve of his waist, slipping my fingers under his waistband, eliciting something between a gasp and a sigh.
to leave John and Watson. Our commitment could hardly be more public. And I didn’t intend to sabotage our life together by trying to leave some escape hatch discreetly open in the back. By every standard we value she is my daughter, and he is everything to me. So I said yes.
He found what he’d been looking for in pretty short order, in a flour canister out in plain sight, and Lestrade was placated. I certainly wasn’t.
Driving south from Rome with Sherlock, I felt my spirits and hopes lifting again. Just a few days earlier, I’d begun to feel defeated. But perhaps it
A little stretching grunting noise, and John’s nose appeared above the blanket, his eyes still squeezed shut. My chest registered an odd sort of lurch.
Sherlock looked my way, and something in my expression made him flush and look away again. What he saw, I was sure, was precisely what I was feeling: desperate love.
And in a way, it wasn’t entirely fair on Rosie either. After leaving daycare she’d settled quickly, didn’t seem to have any residual trauma; she was a “get over it and be happy” kind of child. But if she didn’t start having more contact with kids her age, she would shoot right past them developmentally—and have a pretty hard time integrating with them when she started her compulsory schooling at age six.
But he didn’t answer, though he thrust his arse back into me, clenching around my aching cock in a way that seemed at least to encourage me to do more of what I was doing. I felt incandescent, ready to explode. I’d never felt anything so transcendently erotic; my physical desire and my emotional yearning were beyond anything I’d ever known.
Her complete physical control wars with her tentative verbal delivery, and John sighs as she turns them.
The second I did it I felt him freeze and I felt disconcerted and defensive. We hadn’t told anyone at the Met about our—about us; but surely a steadying hand wasn’t too intimate, or indiscreet? I’d touched him in public a hundred times before, when we weren’t a couple; now I shouldn’t?
We have DNA samples from the other victims. I can afford to interrupt this without ruining a future Crown case, and even if I couldn’t, it would be beyond me to watch a rape in progress and do nothing.
What were the odds that such a body, such a face, would have stunned him into unconsciousness if they hadn’t been accompanied with all the emotional intensity that trembled between them like static electricity before a storm? Thanks to Julian Ashford-Warrington—so like John to look at, but so unlike John—he had the answer to that: none.
, while he stays chained at home playing househusband and perfect dad. And it’s not true, he wasn’t interesting, he wasn’t even free, it only happened once and I regretted it before it was properly over, and it was just—just the novelty, and I
“Eeeee—there was more.” He bumped Sherlock’s arm with his shoulder, stopped him. Turned to face him, then moved in for a completely unexpected full-body hug.
John’s voice has dropped, low and shaking. He’s looking at Sherlock as though he can’t believe this is happening again.
, I insisted, just the classic metal. John had wanted something cheerful. He was quiet now as I poured in the water and spooned in the coffee. There was so much he might be brooding about, I decided to simply ask.
, and I'm glad we went through my childhood with just the stockings. But since I've only three days in London this year, we'll gather everyone together on Christmas Eve and open gifts like normal people.
By now they’re at the edge of the dance floor and John decides to draw her off the floor altogether. His arms fall and they stand and look at each other for a moment. John lifts his brows, daring her to finish her thought.
John and Donovan were exchanging puzzled glances, and Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Heather was her real name; the heather plant is a member of the family
“I won’t have to try: she looks perfect. That dress shows Molly off better than anything I’ve seen her wear since our Christmas party, when you deduced her gift.”
He had to see John. The week apart had been grating. Not quite like cocaine withdrawal; he had the bees, the music, plenty of distractions, and John’s texts were reassuringly fond and frequent. But there was so much to discover, so much to do and say to each other, a thousand times more than could be said or done in a text.
you decided about Zanardi: you’d said goodbye, and I couldn’t count on you contacting me ever again. So I got busy.”
It went a bit against the grain to look into Sherlock’s will. As though I were hoping to be a legatee or something. But I reminded myself that I cared much more about finding out the truth, than about what anyone might think of me for asking. I knew wills are public documents, but not much about acquiring them. Why are internet searches always so much more cumbersome whenever the government or the law is involved?
While I registered the fact that the glass in the window was intact, a thunder of footsteps stampeded down from John’s bedroom upstairs. Two agents burst into the room and trained their weapons on Morstan while the other two pounded down the stairs and out the front door.
John had said he didn’t ever want to see him again, but then he’d set out to find him. Months ago. For weeks on end. So his resentment had faded since that night.
Not only hard now but incoherent, babbling, I bundled Valentina into a taxi that would take her out to her God-forsaken suburb. Courtesy didn’t extend to driving her there myself, flesh and blood couldn’t stand it. I was already drowning in the confluence of
The British Government helped curate the media reveal that disgraced and rehabilitated suicide Sherlock Holmes was alive and well, and since it was all so long ago it was an eight-days’ wonder that petered out after five. Sherlock’s short press release emphasised that his focus was now on beekeeping and increasing the urban bee population, and that might have had something to do with it: no casework, no interviews, so no sensationalism.
He walks through the neighbourhoods he’s chosen as his sample set, walks through them at different times of the day, watches the changing light and crowds and traffic, talks with shopkeepers and residents and loiterers and petty criminals. Sometimes, even, with the tourists. He avoids the northern district where Roberto’s office is located; the thought of seeming to cling makes him shudder. He concentrates on Trastevere, the Testaccio, the Esquilino.
“When did you get my letter? I mean, when did you read it?” I had to know whether he’d sacked Zanardi the moment he’d read it, or whether he’d sat for days and days on everything I’d written him, to finish out his month in Rome. Jealousy is indeed the cruelest emotion I’ve ever experienced, and I was so sickeningly sorry for all the times Sherlock had felt it on my account.
I got Greg to tell me where Sherlock had been meant to turn up, and I texted him myself, jabbing at the letters as though they’d done me a personal injury and were going to
“I love how they work with the topography here,” he said. “The buildings and the landscape enhance each other. Venice and the water. Cefalù and that hunk of rock.”
“I think she needs time with other kids. She’s got well out in front of the percentile for her age, and, well, it’d be good to have her more acclimated to where the other kids are before putting her in school with them.” I was trying not to make her developmental precociousness sound like a disadvantage, as indeed it wasn’t.
It took so little to overwhelm me: the scent of him, being able to touch him everywhere, seeing his expression shuttle between aching desire and bliss. I'd never imagined that basically
The air got even thicker with hostility and suspicion. I was behaving with ostentatious ease and good humour, making small talk, handing him a glass of wine, listening for the water to stop running. Apparently Watson was listening too, because when it did, he put down his glass carefully and stood up. He took a step toward me and pitched his voice low:
He feels unsteady. No — he revises — sick. It isn’t enough, then, to love someone unconditionally, to live and die for them. It isn’t enough to wait, and sacrifice, to be brilliant or charismatic, to try to live up to someone’s expectations. To their illusions. There was something missing—there always had been. He was incomplete.
“I wasn’t even that aware how frightened she was. She never talked about it. I mean, she’d tried to put away this other identity, and be the Mary I knew. (Well. The Mary I thought I knew.) So she couldn’t always be looking over her shoulder: she didn’t want to be reminding me of it, after all.
“You honestly expect me to believe this ‘high-functioning sociopath’ bullshit? I live with you! I work with you! I get to see you angry, elated, bored, and even jealous. You think those aren’t
But something I've glimpsed out of my half-closed eyes pulls me out of the trance: finally, what I’ve come for. The man with the floppy blond hair is manhandling
Sherlock has one more dance before the end, and John reluctantly relinquishes him, turning to the bar to get them each a of glass of
“Mr Holmes. I don’t mean to make you the villain of the piece. Clearly you are a kind man and an intelligent one, or Robbie would never have brought you home—to Italy, or to me. I only ask you to be very sure of what it is you want. If you want Robbie, if you love him, then have him: I will literally rejoice.”
"And you were just going to - what, bugger off to your death without even leaving me a note?" John snaps, ire rising. He jabs a finger at Sherlock's chest. "At least when you walked off St. Barts' roof you had the decency to call and leave me a note."
“Oh?” Sherlock says, peering intently into his microscope. John glances over his shoulder as he walks past on the way to the fridge; it appears to be yet another of Sherlock’s bacteria cultures.
“Mary and I –” he said hoarsely, as Sherlock’s traitorous heart began pounding in his chest. (It was obvious from John’s face that their engagement was off, that they’d just had a blazing row and that John wouldn’t be going back to her anytime soon, but why was John
John grins, making his way to Sherlock’s recently-vacated table. He doesn’t know what he’s expecting to find, but there, propped against the empty cup, is a business card on which is printed in elegant, flowing script:
John grins, his heart fuller than it has been in a long time. “Only if it means you’re not the one making it. I’ve seen the ungodly amounts of sugar you add to all your drinks.”
Because at least then he wouldn’t have to live with the knowledge that he’s caused John Watson so much pain.
The pressure eased as John lifted his head and took a step back, leaving Sherlock feeling incredibly bereft all of a sudden.
be the cold, as his tongue darts out to wet slightly chapped lips and his right hand makes an abortive gesture, as if to reach for John’s arm.
,” Holmes says on-screen, lip curling suggestively, and John’s brain short-circuits as it supplies him with the many possible ways in which that particular phrase could be taken. Besides him, Sherlock chokes on the sip of tea he’s just taken.
“Right, okay. Enjoy,” John says, making his way back to the counter, and hoping the heat rising in his face and on the back of his neck isn’t
Although, Sherlock has to admit, forcing himself out of his Mind Palace, option 3 doesn’t seem terribly likely, given what he knows (and has observed) of John over the years.
“Because you are utterly brilliant as the world’s only consulting detective, Sherlock, but also the world’s most unobservant person when it comes to reading body language.”
John flushes brighter than all of Santa’s reindeer’s noses combined. “I – don’t,” he says, making a swipe for the card that Molly easily evades, “Give that back!”
John glances at his watch, then up at the sleek brass knocker with ‘221’ stamped in neat gold lettering above it. He squares his shoulders, raises a hand to knock, and pauses, struck by a sudden swooping feeling in his stomach that has absolutely nothing to do with the cold. Is he too early? Too eager, perhaps?
“Is that what you think, or is that what people’ve told you?” John asks gently, reaching out and placing a hand on Sherlock’s forearm.
Sherlock spent the meal as he always did whenever they were at Angelo’s: staring out the window across the street, thinking about the first not-a-date they’d had while waiting for the cabbie.
Sherlock wakes to find John leaning over his prone form. John’s face has gone pale and the hand he places on Sherlock’s shoulder to help him sit up is noticeably shaking. Sherlock winces and leans back against the headrest; his insides feel liquefied and it’s like his chest has been caught in an iron, vice-like grip. He glances round; Mary is conspicuously absent. It’s just the two of them and Mycroft in the room.
It takes Sherlock perhaps three seconds to realise John isn’t talking about the Thames or the city lights. John watches, amused, as the consulting detective turns sharply to meet his gaze.
Donovan sighs, the most put-upon John’s ever heard her. “Come on, John – don’t ruin it for everyone! Say it, say the line.” She clears her throat ceremoniously. “
Sherlock twitches, but doesn’t move away. “In this case, possibly both. And they’re right, John,” Sherlock says, twisting his hands together in his lap, “They’re right.”
“Molly?” John abandons the latte, making his way out from behind the counter, because Molly’s wringing her apron tie and looks near tears. Right. John steels his face into his fakest, politest smile and turns to their regular, whose attractive qualities certainly appeared to be dwindling at the moment. “Everything alright, sir?”
"You're responsible for this," Smith hisses wildly now, all composure gone, his fingers drumming out a ceaseless rhythm next to Sherlock's head, "You - take a look around, Mr Holmes - this is all you, no one else. How does it feel, hm? To know you could've prevented this, if only you'd kept your goddamn mouth shut those years ago."
Sherlock shakes his head to clear it, turning his attention back to the case at hand. So the only way the murderer could have gotten into the room
John raises an eyebrow, lips quirking into a grin as he glances down at his own rumpled, blood-spattered clothes, the bandaging on his forearm, and back up at Sherlock. "You mean you haven't already worked that out?"
At exactly 7:45 that night, a black cab deposits John onto the pavement outside 221B Baker Street. It’s a crisp December night, and he shivers, breath fogging as he pockets his change and makes his way up the building’s front steps.
“I’m really not,” he lies, and tries again, because he’s apparently a masochist. “Look, John – this is all my fault –”
Sherlock stops, breathing hard, the ache in his chest a constant reminder of his failings, of the many reasons he doesn’t deserve John. He shifts, turning so he’s sitting with his back to John. “You should go,” he says flatly, emotionlessly. He feels hollow, like there’s a cavity in the centre of his chest, eating away at him. “You and Mary are better off without me.”
Angelo beams at the sight of them and ushers them in, booting a pair of customers unceremoniously from their seats so he can show John and Sherlock to their usual table. (“Sorry,” John mouths at them. They don’t seem very impressed.)
He must have been counting on Mycroft to alert me, since he knew me better than to think I would listen to such a programme, alive or dead. I went back into the programme’s archives and listened.
But the night Lestrade texted me with a terse “where the fuck is Sherlock,” I got... I don’t know. Nervous. Sick with it. Angry with it. Yeah, I thought, where the fuck
Ten minutes later we had tickets from Catania to Gatwick. We wouldn’t be comfortable until we’d got back to Watson, and could work out how to shield her from whatever this was. If an epidemic was going to burn through London, we were going to need all the planning time and information we could get. Neither of us slept more than a couple of hours that night.
I didn’t make a big deal about it; it was what it was. Sometimes I went out dancing, mostly just on dates; I didn’t make much of an effort to stay in practice or anything. Until one day Sherlock Holmes, of all people, asked me to.
in my hand. Sherlock was loosening the bow, putting away the instrument, looking as I’d imagined him, though the shirt that framed his throat was white, not the aubergine colour of my erotic vision. He looked passive, expectant but not particularly energised by my arrival, and suddenly I decided that I was going to take him out after all. I didn’t want him to feel like a live-in convenience, waiting for me to finish my real life and come home to take possession of him, whether he would or no. I was going to show him Rome after all. By an almost full moon.
“We’ve had our differences. I found you very limited when we met, aiming dangerously low. You found me freakish and arrogant and mentally unbalanced. We’ve both learned something since then, I hope.”
I watched him play the violin for her for a solid hour one day, playing every possible variation on some short Bach piece until he had her perfectly blissed out. He would talk to me very seriously about which toys best promoted cognitive development, and which ones she liked. The word sequences he made up for her were the lullaby of my grateful naps in my chair at Baker Street. He probably didn’t think I was paying attention, sleep-deprived as I was, but I was listening as he introduced Rosie to his world.
Before I at least was ready, the outside world was calling to threaten us with a post-interview debriefing. Morstan had, apparently, disclosed quite a few features of interest.
we’re getting somewhere,” or “ah, another maximum bid from the amazingly generous, if clearly anonymous, PC Plod.” The dancers are eager, and even the non-dancers—spouses, partners, friends, flatmates who’ve come along for company—enjoy watching.
After a while, I gave up looking. Sat some more. Drank some more. When I slept, there were always nightmares. Sherlock on the pavement. I didn’t have photographs to study, but in the ones in my mind—something was off.
Sherlock told me once he’s learned not to press his point when he’s mostly carried it. In a fashion I’d almost call chivalrous, he didn’t rub my nose in my admission just then. But of course he did ask what he would call a clarifying question.
one of the three snipers Moriarty was threatening Sherlock with in 2011. It’s even likely she was with you at the pool in 2010. So it’s entirely possible that she’s a valuable asset.”
We were also rock meeting rock. Each of us had jutting outcrops that would wear down under repeated contact. But mostly we were symbiotic balances, strengths evening out weaknesses, coming together with a click as audible as the latch of a door. And a faith in each other that never, or almost never, flagged.
“Sweetheart, you’re starting to worry me. I’ll be home soon. I thought you were going to love this birthday surprise, but it seems to be more of a birthday surprise-attack.”
Ash was serving, and asked if he was still up for a bit of music in the evening. Probably as much a debrief on the previous night; he learned a great deal from those.
up. I don’t suppose either of them will have any more free dances this evening, they’ll be all bid for.”
I didn’t surprise him, though; he came in silently and carefully. Had I left a trace, or was he always this vigilant? He didn’t go about armed, not usually, but this strange month might be an exception. I said his name—conscious of my own shortened breath and pounding heart, and suddenly self-conscious about my uncharacteristic mane and dubious hygiene.
Mycroft was flustered enough to look away. “Well, it’s been a volatile time, hasn’t it. Being away from—London—has never been particularly healthy for him, these past years. I worried that the dislocation might ... interrupt his recovery. ”
He stopped, drew breath. They had so little time, and the point was not to fight. He snapped his mouth shut and turned away to stare at the evening light, softening as mist rolled in from the bay.
“One thing at a time. I try to pick and choose; build a sequence. Can’t cover everything in one go.” He picked up his fork again and didn’t seem to want to take it further, so I let it go with relief.
The immensity of so much touch, craved for so long, was shattering. John stepped back a few inches, afraid he was going to embarrass himself spectacularly before they ever got any further. Sherlock’s growl was unmistakably disapproving; he moved forward to bring them flush against each other again, and somehow managed to wet his hand and seize both of their cocks between them, tightly joined as they were.
“I got that impression. He heard the festival concert, called to see if we were playing anywhere this weekend. Seemed dead keen to get here. Just before we hung up he asked about the fiddler, only he said ‘the violinist,’ said you sounded just like someone he used to know. I told him your name, and he said it was as common as his own, but it had to be you. What a coincidence, yeah?”
She was working herself up again, poor girl, her voice trembling, her breath stuttering, and he took her tea mug before it could slosh on her jeans and the sofa.
Shower sex is effortful, in the average bathroom. It can be cramped, messy, and for one partner at least, a chilly drowning hazard. Not in the Sala Noire shower. Sprawling, heated, equipped with every possible design of shower spray from every angle. Several hand-held nozzles with different pressures and pulses. A bench and a stool at different heights. A frankly delicious light almond oil that tasted more like dessert than like skin care. Bars to grip for stability when legs trembled.
It wasn’t a problem that Sherlock didn’t write “I love you” back. It wasn’t something they’d said to each other in person, and perhaps it’d been tactless to toss it into a text as though he hadn’t meant anything by it, or thought it wouldn’t be welcome.
find a shop open once the holiday begins, but there’s something so nice about not having to—and when I came back from Bristol on Boxing Day it would be lovely to find some provisions already in.
“I want the full experience, canals and palaces and twisting streets and gondolas and mysterious costumed figures lounging on stone bridges. I don’t even care if the city’s underwater and we have to walk around on wooden duckboards, I want to see Venice in the fog and kiss you when no one’s looking.”
about me being dead; his investigations had created reasonable doubt. Could anyone be watching him, and come to the same conclusion?
On Friday evening I left work a little later than usual, eager to get home to Sherlock. Got ambushed on my way out by a colleague who had no pressure of time, apparently, and self-evidently no Sherlock to hurry home to. Yet her case was important to her, and I owed her a favour, to be called in from a petty bureaucrat whose purpose in life seemed to be to hold up an investigation until his importance had been acknowledged and venerated.
But John looked up at the clock, gathered his things and went to the door without saying anything of consequence. Disappointing. Not surprising, though; John’s m.o. is one step forward, three back. It might take us months to get anywhere near as close as we were last night.
, all right. Shouted down the line that he’d betrayed his brother, sold him out for his own convenience. Two or three times he tried to interrupt. I just roared louder, didn’t stop to draw breath, told him what he could do with his fake grief and fake solicitude, then ended the call. Fuck him, too. Twice.
Mrs Hudson was going to her sister in Bristol, as always. Before she left we exchanged gifts in front of the fire in 221B, and she teared up when I gave her an album of photographs of Rosie signed “for Nana.” She gave us
“Odd, she seemed so sensible. She should’ve asked me. I’d have told her all about your merits as a ... flatmate.”
Sherlock smiles, a little upward curve of the left side of his mouth that has nothing of the smirk about it. “You weren’t supposed to look away. Did I see you go bid on a dance?”
There’s a literal bullet dangling innocuously from a thin gold cord, and I’m to understand it’s in honour of both my fathers’ scars. To me it just looks like an homage to their—our—weirdly casual attitude toward carnage.
On the one hand I had my work, with the real consequences of the joint operation successfully concluded in London: new leads at this end, criminal trials pending or in progress to modify with new evidence. New work teams to form and train, which always required more diplomacy than the U.N. Endless paperwork: forms, reports, requests. If I’d stayed at work fourteen hours a day it wouldn’t have been enough, so I didn’t.
But that wouldn’t do; half of my seduction plan turned on dazzling the whole room, not just August. Nothing turned uncertainty into fascination faster than seeing a couple of hundred people gaping in admiration—Holmes had been counting on that the first time, and now so was I.
I didn’t want to snoop. Didn’t want to see, for example, if he had Grindr (or, given that waft of perfume, Tinder) installed on his phone. Didn’t want to check his text messages. Go through his mail to see if he was receiving bills from some ... spa or service. He trusted me with all his devices and data, and I wasn’t going to abuse that trust to spy on him. Though it’s what he would immediately have done in my place.
He wasn’t very loquacious, and I thought I should let him make the first overture. Perhaps he wanted to pore over his kilo of new reading matter first. We had an hour before Sami had to leave, so I whisked him into a coffee shop for some time alone and a hot drink. Technically it was almost spring, but in London that meant less than nothing. We settled in at a small round table with a decided list to it.
All the while pursuing Moriarty’s accomplices, throwing a wrench into the works of his criminal machine, using the law when I could and violence when I had to.
“Listen, love. Let’s go together to take a look at the local primary school. There’s an Open Day on Monday. We’ll go without Rosie, just check things out, maybe see a class and meet a couple of staff. I’ve got a few names of Reception teachers.”
His lean grace, his blend of scents, the dark hair tickling behind my ear, the incredible taste of his mouth. The way we pursued and evaded each other in the dance. It was so natural, so easy. I stepped in closer and pushed my erection against his, pulling him to me by his hips, growling that I needed him now,
” I kept my voice gentle, then lipped along his neck and jaw, feeling his heart under my hand and against my chest.
For some months after we met, John thought it was “a posh thing” (this was years before I made him banish that word from his lexicon, at least in connection with me). As time went on he realised it was a fact of neurological processing, not a preference or an affectation. By the time I returned from the dead he had stopped scoffing at my affinity for merino wool, or high-thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets.
men.” His game attempt at humour even came with a little patented John-giggle. It broke my heart a bit.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
“Are you friends outside of work? Do you two socialise with your” (nodding at John’s ring) “wife, for example?”
, Sherlock, and I don’t think I’ll get jaded soon, if ever, at having you. Or do you mean, will you stop wanting me? That one I can’t venture a guess on.”
), taking fewer cases. It’s been some time since I stopped operating, but we’ve been winding down the detective consultancy by raising the minimum interest factor. Now, it would take something like a 12 to get our professional attention (meaning that a prospective case must include three of these five: twins; aliens (provable); ghosts (ditto); newly discovered poisons or weapons; imminent danger to family or friends).
I did, indeed. What if the bliss of lovemaking, of being together, didn’t last, simply because there was no longer an obstacle to it? In the middle of the night I’d asked him, “What’s more fatal to desire than satisfaction?”
.” Putting his arm around Sherlock’s waist, he picks up a small case in his right hand and steers Sherlock toward the escalator. They hold each other as they descend onto the platform and follow the tunnel to the station exit.
The morning passed with us only vaguely aware, and very little concerned, that somewhere else an interrogation was in progress. There was such intensity to the thrill of discovering Sherlock in this dimension that I wished the outside world well away.
Strength can only get you so far. At a certain point you also have to accept to be vulnerable. Self-protection can only get you so far; at a certain point you also have to decide to risk. And pride can only get you so far; at a certain point you also have to resolve to be humble.
Sherlock’s lips pressed together, refusing to return John’s grin. “You do borrow from the best, don’t you.”
“She would. She’s that honest. When?” His finger went looking for a soft curl to twine around, but those were gone for the nonce.
“Well, the hints have been so subtle I could hardly say. Perhaps the silence. The icy chill. The long absences. Perhaps the
Well, didn’t that just take the cake. We’d been summoned to the Holmes’ house—Sherlock, Rosie, and me—and it would be my first time there since the catastrophic Christmas of 2014. The one with the druggings, the national security data theft, and oh yes, the premeditated murder that nearly got Sherlock exiled for the rest of an artificially shortened life. And damned if he hadn’t found the only possible way to make this visit an even
He barely looked back as he shouted, “Obviously! Look at the footprints, for God’s sake! Do I have to do
“Mad wanker,” he muttered. I feel relieved laughter bubbling up and I clear my throat, trying to suppress it, but without the smallest success. I start to laugh full out, my chest heaving and gasping, tears actually sliding out the corners of my eyes from the absurdity of his exaggerated truculence. It must have something to do with the heightened emotion, because instead of subsiding my laughter becomes more and more uncontrollable, until John too is reluctantly grinning and starting to chuckle. He leans down and licks the tears away from my eyes, so it’s my turn to protest.
Had there been a post mortem, I asked? She said the coroner had not asked for one, given the cause of death was obviously the fall; there'd only been a visual inventory of injuries. She brought me a photocopy of the medical certificate and the supporting report not five minutes after I asked. I couldn’t read it there and then, but I asked her how the Coroner had decided whether it was an accident or suicide?
Then I realised. Constantine wasn’t staring at Sherlock; he was staring at me. And Sherlock didn’t like it, seemingly. Not one bit, in fact, to judge by those narrowed eyes, which gave his usually impassive face an acid expression. My eyebrows lifted and I smiled at him affectionately.
“Of course, by all means. Let me know how you go on. I should warn you, though, I’m a terrible correspondent. Don’t take it amiss if you don’t hear back.”
Sherlock still isn’t back to his proper weight, John thinks, but then again he never really is. He’s always a bit undernourished, whipcord thin even when he hasn’t been abusing his body and brain like a demon. (
“Ba. Da. Father Christmas left this in the wrong room.” I turned on the light and gently emptied the laundry basket onto the bed. To the end of my days I will never forget the
After lunch, though, Sherlock’s dad marched me to his potting shed cum wood shop, and showed me a little wooden rocking chair he was finishing for Rosie. White or natural pine, he asked. I thought of the nursery upstairs; white, I said. “And thank you. You’re both so very kind to me and Rosie.”
Finally I decided we couldn’t live in this stalemate anymore: him like an ice sculpture, me like a great bloody coward waiting for it to melt. Exactly four weeks after that Monday visit to the Rosedale School I put our girl to bed for the night, came downstairs to stand in front of his chair and said,
“You alerted Big Brother the moment you left London. Don’t worry. He’ll behave, keep his word. He has to. I’ll contact him, tell him to put five thousand in your chequing account.”
Just then Zanardi stuck his head in the door and said, “We done here, Sherlock?” the way John used to. And Sherlock stiffened up and ducked his head, awkwardly but still regally.
Sherlock glanced up blankly, clearly hearing only sounds without words. When the sense did penetrate, however, he still looked blank. “An expert informant on tobacco-ash?”
His breath hissed inward as my hand again strayed close to his flies, and I was fascinated, eager to explore what might come of having many fewer layers of clothing between us. He smelled good, he felt good—firm but flexible, taut, not brawny—and he looked frankly good enough to eat. I meant to. I whispered that to him for the pleasure of seeing him gasp and swallow.
His sleepy sea-green eyes widened and so did his sleepy grin. “Yes, Captain,” he said again, and pulled himself over me as he pressed me down on my back. He laced our fingers together and bent down to kiss me with an intensity I recognised: sometimes Sherlock’s kisses were an end in themselves, not a prologue, going on for minutes without any end in view. His lips nipping tenderly, his tongue wandering hot and curious, our breath shared, our wordless vocalisations deepening. Oh, I could kiss Sherlock for hours.
The Sherlock in front of me was restrained and reasonable, acknowledging the potential drawbacks and listing the advantages of moving ahead. In the end, with his hand in my hair, his lush voice murmuring in my ear, all he had to say was, “What if I sleep at your flat, then, until you decide. I’d rather not sleep without you—ever again, actually.”
“I swear, if Lestrade’s people were any more incompetent they'd have to be rounded up and put in the
Once again: my most grateful thanks to beta and britpicker, who save me from myself so often they really deserve titles more like guardian angel.
Day after day he went to work with Mary and came home with Mary, who tried to bring Sherlock up in conversation. Neutrally, at dinner or in front of the telly.
“Mrs Hudson can probably take her in the morning, John. She’d cancel breakfast with the Queen, for Watson.”
They reach the house after ten, too late to light a fire, and it’s cold and damp enough that the sitting-room is unwelcoming. They turn on heat in the bedrooms, using electric mattress-warmers to dry and warm the beds, and have a last
Christmas in Oxford Street is enough to turn me full Scrooge (pre-conversion, obviously). It’s hard enough to maintain a decent walking pace the rest of the year—let alone when shoppers and window-shoppers choke it, and the street is cleared for that ridiculous “Santas on rollerskates” event. The only redeeming feature is that Christmas brings in its train a reliable uptick in murders.
Patrick finished singing a song he told the audience was “one of Scotty’s,” and stepped back to his place, leaving Sherlock staring across the crowd into the face of John Watson. Looking tired, and thinner, but beaming.
be an escalation, but then again it might be an anomaly. He might regret it in the morning and I might never have the chance to be here again, feel all this again.
“So you weren’t expected at the surgery today.” He didn’t look like he’d spent a restful day at the flat, but it was obvious he hadn’t gone out, either.
you are,” but glanced away, a bit awkward. Clearly he’d got uncomfortable somehow; was seeing Sherlock’s real eyes thrusting him back into self-consciousness?
to be equilibrium. I wondered too if Sherlock had felt as precarious, as peripheral, when I was dating, as I was feeling now. Maybe I’d kept him feeling off-balance, on the verge of losing a treasured, easy, symbiotic living situation with a uniquely compatible—friend. I felt melancholy, both on my own account now, and on his, then.
I hadn’t seen Harry in months. Since before Bologna, for certain. And even then she wasn’t well, or kind, or happy. But now—she was radiant. And Clara was with her. I stepped over to the door and took Harry in my arms in a silent, motionless hug. She wound her arms around my neck in that way she’s always had. In a moment Clara joined in, too, whispering, "Don't be angry with Sherlock for not telling you. Harry asked him not to."
— People. Their suffering. Doing the right thing. You taught me I could care about it even if I couldn’t fix it. SH
?” Not once but twice: it was clear now, why. He’d imagined a scenario where—no, best get it out in the open.
He was clearly excellent at prior planning, as he’d come into the bedroom equipped with everything needed for rigorously hygienic and indescribably pleasurable rimming.
to survive being without him. Beyond the instantaneous allegiance, attraction, acceptance, there was a bond of understanding that I thought would never fail us. Bound in mind and heart, sharing a living space and indeed a living, we weren’t even really separate people, but rather two sides of the same coin: opposites, sure, but also identical, coextensive, in so many ways. Brave enough to face a world we didn’t fit into anymore, or ever. Bright enough to know when people were humouring us but were wrong to feel superior. Burdened by tenacious desires we weren’t comfortable acknowledging even to ourselves, let alone to anyone else. But we were opposites, too: one brilliant, one industrious; one bored, one stoic; one mercurial, one stolid.
“Nothing very specific. Just... a tendency to be secretive, sometimes. Perhaps to manipulate. To isolate.”
He doesn’t. “Why would I be bored? Neither of us had to go to work today. You’re not boring. Watson’s not boring. 221B’s not boring.” As he counts all these not-boring things he kisses a different finger of the hand I’ve been stroking his cheek with.
“In my experience nobody’s squeaky-clean. Have you never done anything you’d need Ash’s forgiveness for? If she knew?”
together—every sense, every nerve ending, every thought and desire were fixed on him. He was everything I found beautiful and desirable: brilliance, grace, control, self-sufficiency, wrapped up in a gorgeous physical form I could never touch or taste enough.
Then I went into the kitchen to turn last night's shopping into a breakfast as nourishing as the night's exertions.
But he was ready to work now, if ruffled and out of breath and perhaps with a case of uncomfortable sexual frustration, oh fuck call it what it is, blue balls.
Thank you all, gentle readers, for reading this, and Anyawen, whose inspiration it is. Thank you Anyawen for "winning" this, prompting it, betaing it, improving it.
I look around the dim room as John steps back to pull me up and out of the chair. My limbs are stiff and my back aches.
“Oh, God, love. You planned our wedding, I still can’t believe it. You put more into it than we did. Into the marriage, too, for that matter. I only realised it when it was finally over.” His voice was as shaky as mine.
When I looked up he was giving the crooked smile that’s always made my heart jerk sideways, the one where he knows exactly what I mean. I pulled him close and kissed it right off his face. His rough fingertips running up and down my tricep again raised gooseflesh: waves of delight, both soothing and arousing.
It seemed a gushy thing to say, but I had exactly zero adult experience with primary school teachers, and perhaps this was part of making parents eager to send their kids there. It was certainly a very different style from Doctor Rossiter, whom I was relieved not to see that afternoon lest she mention my visit the week prior.
Suddenly very tired, he starts making a list of steps to get to this completeness. He’d thought he’d be able to rest from the terror and frenzy and danger of the past hallucinatory weeks, and instead he has a whole new obstacle course to run.
feel the same. I spent the week wondering how you do it, arranging complex information so cleanly, with such energy, keeping the reader feeling like they understand. I wanted to let you help when you offered, but it would have been a waste of your time.”
He’d always loved the sea with its endlessly changing weather, its endlessly changing light. And he’d always loved the extravagant beauty of this place, from the green-soaked landscape to the beautiful language that gilded even the English he heard here.
Suddenly it was over, or almost. The man I loved, who loved me, who loved my daughter (our daughter), was worried about me, and I felt sorry. I’d punished him, frightened him, in a complicated knot of resentment at him and Zanardi and myself, and that wasn’t fair. Not trusting myself to ring yet, I texted back.
They’d had a gratifying time in bed the night before, Roberto touching him in ways and in places that Sherlock had never imagined he could find so pleasurable. And as always, he stayed in Roberto’s arms after, for at least half an hour; it was only polite. But it was a night he felt both jangled and in need of solitude, and Roberto had fallen heavily asleep with his hand possessing Sherlock’s wrist. It made it impossible to slip away, or even to shift into a more comfortable position until he could leave altogether. He concentrated on relaxing. He could do this. It was only for a little while.
“You can’t imagine how many hours I’ve spent thinking about your wrist bone, John.” He lifts my hand cautiously, brings it to his mouth, slides his lower lip along my wrist. And just like that, my wrist is an erogenous zone to the power of ten. I try to keep focused, keep my voice calm.
By definition, the cold provokes unpromising bodily reactions: muscles tense up, teeth chatter, gooseflesh stipples the skin. Genitals run for cover, so to speak. None of that seems propitious even for caresses, let alone full-on congress. But it does focus the mind, wonderfully.
“I gave him money to give to members of the network who were sleeping rough that night. Not to buy cocaine, for God’s sake. And anyway, as for motivation to get clean—the stakes were always high enough, from the beginning. The drugs were only ever for a case. Magnussen. And afterwards, for ... a precaution.”
This is a hermetic universe, which for a few minutes a day has only two inhabitants. They don't even need names.
“Yeah. You remember Sarah Sawyer. She and her partner have been seeing a lot of Rosie. They’ve been trying to get pregnant, and Sarah calls Rosie her practice baby.” He murmured this while nuzzling into my hair, still forcing himself to breathe deeply and regularly.
The door closes and Sherlock’s back hits the wall again, both impacts making a bit more noise than John would’ve liked, but needs must, he supposes. His hands land on Sherlock’s waist to steady them both, but he doesn’t squander the chance to explore, down Sherlock’s hips and back to his arse, just as lush as he’s always suspected. Pulling Sherlock to himself John whispers “Take it off, take it off, take it
I sighed, set the laptop on the floor in a vertical V, unfolded my crossed legs and walked over to the sofa. I looked quizzically down at John.
But mostly I had loved her for pulling John back from the brink, putting him back together. Even if she had created for him a new identity that had—quite rightly, I thought—no room in it for me. A family man, with a wife and daughter who would always, would have to, come first. And that identity would have lasted until the end of his life, had it not shattered with the end of hers.
They gathered up papers and went to the table (Spink-Bottle in John’s chair there, too). He seemed to be answering a question from Sherlock.
If I’d known, though, would I have had the courage to open up to him? Probably not. If I hadn’t loved him, I could have told him I wanted him. If I hadn’t wanted him, I could have told him I loved him. Both together—it was just too overwhelming a risk of rejection.
I turn my face up for a kiss and it’s the same as every day and it’s brand new all over again, knocking me sideways, the seventh wave in the surf. His mouth. His lips. They close over mine as though this were all he had been thinking about all day, as though I were all he’d been thinking about. As though we were only half ourselves until we were together again.
With his stiffest demeanour Mycroft said, “Before I begin I must emphasise that all information shared in this meeting, including what has already
The crossroads of the Mediterranean for almost three millennia, Palermo is a layered record of its waves of cultures, and religions, and the many languages that flowed into modern Sicilian—a language in its own right. Palermo’s names, from Cuba to Kalsa to Vucciria to Ziza, immortalise its centuries as a city of Arabic language and Muslim faith. In the Vucciria food market unintelligible sounds floated around us like snow, bright and varied and mostly empty of the semantic weight that would pull them to earth.
For years, for so long, when I’d dreamed of holding him, talking to him, loving him and making love to him, I’d always suspected I was being unrealistic. Ridiculously optimistic. As though I had a Sherlock doll in my head I could position any way I wanted, make say or do anything I wanted—all the while expecting the real Sherlock to disappoint me.
I wasn’t too articulate myself, just then. I knew I should say say it was only infatuation, one-sided at that. (It wasn’t; by then Sherlock had told me he was flattered, and tempted.) But I also really wanted him to regret what he’d thrown away when he married Mary: a man who’d sacrificed
In the event Lestrade does come, an overcoat thrown over his pyjamas, accompanied by the police. They take Donovan to hospital for blood tests, to see what the assailant drugged her with, and I go with Lestrade to give him the short version of the evening. He’ll still make me go in to give a statement the next morning, I know.
The notion that if I chose the wrong song line it would cause him to pull back—it haunted me week after week, until I hesitated to say anything at all beyond the blandest reassurances. And then, reading the exchange yet again, I realized: if I was granting John plausible deniability on the basis of the pre-formed song lines, then I had it as well.
This is a hermetic universe, which for a few minutes a day has only two inhabitants. They don't even need names.
” Nothing that hadn’t happened before. And Sherlock had managed to distract him with a deliberate touch, a suggestive kiss. Tonight—what was different?
“I’m not leaving either. Promise. Being here wrapped around you is just too distracting, and you’ve given me something to think about. That means I have to actually
and that, it appeared, was the outer limit of his tolerance for John’s absence from this brand new world.
Sherlock was happy to weigh in on the wardrobe, but declined to attend the meeting: it wouldn’t be advantageous for her in the long run, he said, to think she needed propping up. He’d accompany her there, wait outside the building, and scoop her up after, take her for something either celebratory or consoling.
Well, we didn’t talk for some time after that. I couldn’t find words strong enough to tell him how sorry I was to have made him think that, how wrong he was that I wished him to be different. I had tears on my face that he kissed away. He didn’t; I suspected the hurt went too deep for an easy release. It seemed a good idea to spend the rest of my days making it clear to him that I love, without reservation, who he really is.
,” he hissed—and the penny dropped. I’d not considered that Roberto’s considerable experience of sex had probably been primarily or even entirely in Italian. I decided that would to be the language we would share. The language that would take me outside of myself, outside of my inexperience of sex and arousal and intimacy. I exaggerated the erotic effect of his profanity, leaning into his ear and whispering, “
The song broke off in a loud dispute between the siblings, each calling the other tone-deaf. When they took up again, the fiddle came in: poignant, sweet, and then too, that piercing ornament that made John’s breath hitch, his eyes swim.
The third photo: a room at night, a bed seen from ceiling height. Sherlock lying on his back, staring up nearly into the camera’s eye; Zanardi stretched out on his side, head tucked over Sherlock’s shoulder, left arm over Sherlock’s bare chest, left leg resting on Sherlock's thigh. I wish I hadn’t seen Sherlock’s stare: the illusion of his eyes looking straight at me, sombre and expressionless.
I felt miserable. John knows, but doesn’t seem to understand, that my “subset of possible sex interests” is vanishingly small. It is practically only him. That’s one reason I can barely endure to remember the month with Roberto, though at the time there was very little objectionable about it. I didn’t know how to articulate this for John any better than I already had. So I just nodded.
John, he said, was mostly immured in Baker Street: “He goes out rarely, every week or ten days. When he does, it’s either to go to his therapist’s office, where he says virtually nothing; or to visit your grave; or to try to dig up information about your death. Your
“To you the calendar year may be an arbitrary construct, but to me? 2016 is the year I was the most wretched and the most ecstatic I’ve ever been in my life. And while I don’t give a toss about lists of its ten best films and whatnot, I am quite up for listing the best moments of 2016.”
I said, “It’s a big move, Sherlock. Are you sure you don’t want to wait a few weeks? let us settle in together? before we set up a nursery, and a schedule, and try to integrate us, with Rosie.”
“I asked you for one more miracle. I asked you to stop being dead.” At the time it had seemed so ridiculous, such a sign of impending madness, to ask even the cleverest man in London to pull that off.
I close the room door firmly so he’ll hear me, asleep or awake. He hasn’t moved, apparently, in the hour or so since I left, and the bedside lamp is still on, low.
The rest of her was ... not untouched. He couldn’t begin to assess the damage, the broken bones, almost certain internal injuries. It was overwhelming and he dared not move any part of her. He hadn’t the competence to do so, in any case. He raised his head and roared “Ambulance!”, saw the nearest pedestrian nodding furiously, already manipulating a mobile phone with shaking hands.
I didn’t mention it that day, because I knew what Sherlock would say: “A second language also enhances cognitive development, John. It’s basic brain science.”
“Tell me, love. When we went to the school’s Open Day—what got you so very angry, that evening? When I came back down from putting Rosie to sleep you literally weren’t speaking to me anymore.”
Julian burst out laughing, evidently neither shocked nor repelled by the deadpan dark humour. Still laughing, he said, “I’d have to do it quite cleverly, I gather, so the local police would have to call you in.”
Oh, I’d never stopped practicing medicine, obviously. And Sherlock with his ridiculous round of risks and injuries even let me keep my hand in on minor surgery and fine wound stitching. He would never let anyone but me work on him if he had a say in the matter, which was as much as to say, if he was conscious. But that was a long, long way from trauma surgery, combat surgery, or even the major surgeries I used to do outside of the war zone.
How much of what came after could have been avoided if I’d just gone to him and said: I loved you, how could you do that to me? How could you let me hurt like that for two and half
I lay down on my back and pulled him over me this time, then started thrusting lightly and slowly between us. I loved the way my cock felt, gliding over the loose and silky skin of his balls, and sometimes I pushed between his legs, wanting to feel the tip slide just barely into the crack of his arse; I wanted to go so slow that we could keep going for hours. He gasped and understood, slowing down too. But it was torturous, delirious, and I couldn’t control myself.
His voice shifts again, darkens, deepens. “Oh, I will. I will. That’s all I want. As long as you want it too.”
I turned to her beside me on the bed and hugged her shoulders tight. “Thank you, Gran. That’s so generous. I should let you give it to Da, instead of taking the credit.”
it with these foreign euphemisms?) to get him to give her at least some lead on where he wanted those dots connected.
I sounded like an informant, and again, I hated it. But nowhere near as much as I hated Wiggins and what he’d helped Sherlock to do to himself.
Whenever I could turn my attention to them, I listened to those songs from every point of view; I wrote the lyrics down, trying to see if there was some hidden code, to understand what John meant in dedicating them to me. Most immediately, whether they could alert anyone to my survival.
Somehow this was all much harder than I expected. Like pouring alcohol on an abrasion. I didn’t want Zanardi in my head the first night I had Sherlock in my arms. But there he was.
I begin to rein in the frenzy of my movements. I seize John’s hand and remove it from his cock, at which point he moans in desperate disapproval.
, of course), and he imagines I’ll be good partner material for the women, always more numerous on a weeknight than the men. God knows why. Not my area. But I don’t mind female partners, it gives me a chance to keep in practice with the strange flirting ritual that sometimes gets me what I need faster than interrogation.
But John seemed to have gone unexpectedly placid while I’d been sluicing the filth of days off my skin and down the drain. He handed me sweet milky tea with one hand, flapping vaguely at my head with the other.
The thing is, Watson is an amazingly consoling little armful. And she smells like John. Like apricots—John smells like dried apricots, I don’t know why. I’d never been able to track that scent down to a soap or shampoo or shaving product. It was a simple, faint aura crossed with the smell of mown grass in the summer, a hayloft in winter. And Watson smells faintly of the same thing. Shared genetic material? Or something more proximate, like shared laundry detergent?
But it was unrealistic to imagine that we would be blissfully reunited, or constantly exchanging meaningful glances, or even familiarly at ease in each other’s orbit. There was too much at stake to lose focus.
don’t care about seeing him, and you don’t care about seeing him, there’s no need to wish we were in Sicily, is there? I’ve been enjoying every minute of Venice until just then, and we can keep on enjoying it. Can’t we?”
The next episode in this series will be the wedding as Sherlock remembers it, and the honeymoon--in Venice and in Sicily--as he experiences it. (*fans self*) If you’re on board for this, you might subscribe to the series or to me.
It was an old conundrum they’d discussed many times by now, and they didn’t have to hash it out every time. It’d been a jolt when he’d got to Ireland to meet the man Sherlock had become. But from the time they’d left Ireland for London, he’d watched Will slowly retreat and Sherlock slowly return.
He was silent for half a minute, then sighed, “It’s a more than fair question. I’d occasionally been idly curious about some bloke or another” (aha, I knew it, I knew there was a reason John was so touchy about his
What he said instead was, “Thank you for telling me that. I do feel that he’s the love of my life. I’m
Sherlock hurtles himself onto his other side in the bed, tucking his head down. He doesn’t move while I dress. His expression, both thunderous and uncertain, comes with me as I close the door, take the slow elevator down, and finally pull the street door closed behind me.
you git! I’ve been playing the devastated friend for so long my back’s gone permanently curved and I barely remember how to smile. I couldn’t let anyone see I was investigating your suicide, could I? I had to keep a low profile, emphasis on the low.”
“But be good to him. Be loving to him, because he deserves that and God knows he’s had little enough of it, of late. But if you’re not sure, or you already know that he’s not what you want, then for God’s sake let him go. He’ll recover faster from a clean break than from the slow death of a love affair like this one.”
From day one Zanardi was ready to collabourate. He brought information about the Italian situation, about the boats crammed with victims who’d given every penny they could scrape together to get to Italy—only to die on the way or end up in slavery, as workers or criminals or prostitutes. He had a huge mental database of dates, names, numbers, arrests, trials, convictions, acquittals, organised crime connections. He never had to look anything up; he had it all in his head. In that he was like Sherlock.
It seemed much longer than an hour before John came back, carrying, of all things, an armful of groceries. He was as unruffled as the night he shot Jeff Hope; I was not. In all these months I had been doing the impossible and the insane to protect John, forgetting that he was infinitely happier—safer—saner—protecting, than being protected. This lesson I swore not to forget.
Monday morning had brought the unexpected gift of John’s presence for the week. They’d the luxury of time now, not that it would ever be enough.
he’d feared the worst, feared that he’d be too late, that Shan would realize she had the wrong man, and John’s body would be all he found.)
“Hm,” Sherlock says non-committally, refusing to give John the satisfaction. He turns his attention back to the cadaver.
“Oh.” Sherlock glances down at the carton he’s still holding, then slowly makes his way to the bin. “Sorry?” he offers, once the toes are safely discarded in the bin, and no longer mingling with John’s food.
?” The expression on Sherlock’s face must hold certain comic potential, because John laughs, a helpless chuckle that exposes the line of his throat and Sherlock
“So sorry,” Sherlock says loudly, over the sounds of John’s stifled giggling and Lestrade’s cursing. “Thank you for the drink, John,” he says, setting the cup back in its saucer and shooting John a lilting, if distracted, grin.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Sherlock murmurs, after a beat, eyes fixed on the glimmering lights across the river.
John was the last person Sherlock expected to see sitting at their (his) kitchen table when he ambled out of his bedroom on Christmas morning. John so rarely visited now; he and Mary were living the life of perfect domestic bliss.
Mycroft clears his throat, brushing invisible lint off his trousers as he collects his umbrella and turns back to look at them. "Sherlock," he says, and when Sherlock refuses to meet his gaze he sighs, continues, "Remember that I did what I had to to save your life. I had a very good reas-"
John’s wandering mind is recalled to the present as Sherlock says, matter-of-factly, “You’re here to help me work the case, of course.”
just don’t seem appropriate. “You might want to put the tea down,” is what he eventually settles on.
The man standing over John laughs, a sharp, biting sound, and re-adjusts his grip to point one of the guns at John, directly over his heart. He turns back to sneer at Sherlock. “What is he, your boyfriend or something?”
“Y – yes, two.” Sherlock simply stands and watches as John does the same with the second sugar packet.
“It was worth a try,” he grins, even though he hasn’t tried at all. (The muscles in his face hurt; smiling isn’t something he’s done in a while.)
,” Sherlock says with austerity, then ruining it when he giggles at the end of the sentence. “You’re –
“Excellent,” Sherlock rubs his hands together, sounding positively gleeful as he turns his attention back to the men on the dock, one of whom has just pulled out a phone to check something. “Let’s see what happens now, shall we?”
He twists sideways to glance at John with what limited mobility he has, and sees the flames of the crematorium reflected in the blues of his eyes.
“Excellent, John, I see you’ve met Mrs Hudson,” Sherlock says, an air of palpable excitement about him as he takes John by the shoulders and spins him firmly around to face the stairs he’s just come up, “We should really get going – we wouldn’t want to be late now, would we?”
There’s an oddly weighted quality to the way Sherlock says this that has John thinking his answer matters a lot more to the man than he’s letting on.
John raises his eyebrows. “Would you like another?” he asks, but he’s already pushed off the counter and is en route to the machine.
Their regular – curly hair, piercing eyes, cheekbones sharp enough to cut glass – approaches the counter and runs a cursory eye over the list of available options on their drinks list. He’s done this every single morning, and has invariably settled on americano every day for the past a hundred and forty, to the effect that Molly’s already grabbed a cup and has her finger on the espresso button when his words – “Cappuccino for me, please,” – register.
“Sherlock, for the love of – this is a crime scene!” Lestrade squawks, flapping his arms ineffectually (Sherlock and John remain glued at the mouth), “Don’t you have anything better to do?”
In the span of an hour, Sherlock has determined that John:  a) adores egg rolls and spring rolls and also bread rolls but that’s beside the point  b) doesn’t like talking about his family  c) is an inherently GOOD person in block letters and  d) is entirely too GOOD for Sherlock.
“Since this is likely the last conversation I’ll have with John Watson,” Sherlock says, then stops. The words scrape painfully against his throat. He grits his teeth; there’s a pity in Mycroft’s expression that Sherlock can’t stand.
“Really, John,” Sherlock sighs, rolling his eyes, “If I wanted what I said parroted back at me, I’d go to Lestrade.
Molly turns her back to him, though not before John catches sight of her smile, and of the flush rising high on her cheeks. “He only has americano, and he only ever takes it black, at that. Well,” she concedes, sprinkling cocoa powder over the foam-penis now, “Black with at least two sugars.”
He was let out of the precinct and given a rather hefty sum of cash (courtesy of Mycroft) along with a formal pardon from the Lebanese police. He bought a navy blue scarf at the first shop he came across, wound it around his neck despite the heat, and tried to imagine that it was John’s scarf (John’s touch) resting against his skin.
“Oh,” John says sheepishly, presumably when he looks down and realizes he’s still holding the pot. “Ow,” he says a moment later, presumably when he realizes it’s still hot.
“Sod this,” John says, his body a line of tension and his fists clenched in anger. (Sherlock wishes John would hit him. It would hurt less.) “
With that he brushed past John, leaving behind him a chaotic tableau of forensic analysis reports, old case files and sheet music scattered on the kitchen floor. John sighed, wondering if things were ever going back to the way they were, or if they were stuck in perpetual awkward limbo, their lives ruined by a film starring the fictional, Victorian versions of themselves.
, indeed,” Sherlock says stiffly. He stands so quickly he collides with the coffee table, and makes his escape through the kitchen door before John can get another word out.
have a plan that will (hopefully) resolve their current situation and alleviate any of the lingering awkwardness.
“Better,” John sighs. He abandons his quest for milk and instead heads to the counter, intent on making a cup of tea and spending the rest of the night in front of the telly.
“Oh, John, but you said such nice things,” Sherlock says, still chuckling, “We could’ve carried on, you know. If I hadn’t turned the bomb off, we might well have just
Sherlock clears his throat, feeling the need to address a Serious Matter before they both descend into hysteria. "John,
"And what of Mary?" Sherlock says, a gentle reminder. "You wouldn't - couldn't - have left her. She needed you more than I did."
“On the house,” John cajoles, unhooking a clean cup from the draining board. “C’mon, just one. And take your time about it. When was the last time you took more than thirty seconds to finish a coffee, mm?”
“I can keep my mouth shut, you know,” John says, tapping an irate finger against the hardwood counter, “There wasn’t any need to threaten me with jail-time.”
“Surely Scotland Yard haven’t deteriorated so far that they haven’t taught you alibis can be manufactured,” Sherlock says archly. (The cops, John’s mind grounds him, rather mournfully, back to reality. Nothing half as exciting as covert MI-6 ops.) He watches, still behind the coffee machine, as Sherlock plucks Lestrade’s pen from his hand and scratches something on the page in front of them. “Michaels has a long history of a gambling addiction and an equally long history of being an upstanding, reputable business man. It wouldn’t have been a hardship for Pyeterson to coerce him into helping with the cover-up.”
“Please, John – forgive me,” he says, plaintive and sincere. John’s eyes snap to his in shock and resignation. “For all the hurt that I caused you.”
“Hm?” John turns from where he’s toeing off his shoes, movements made hazy and lethargic by exhaustion and lack of sleep.
Holmes and Moriarty grapple with each other on-screen, although it’s clear by Holmes’ strained expression that Moriarty’s gaining ground. John looks away from the fight to glance sideways at Sherlock, wondering how an accurate a depiction of Sherlock’s Mind Palace this director’s construction is. (Judging from how hard the hand Sherlock has wrapped around his mug is shaking, John would hazard a guess at ‘disturbingly accurate’.)
John frowns down at the drink, a slight break in the foamy dick indicating where Sherlock had taken a sip (just the one) before condemning it. Then, before his professional and better judgement can stop him, he raises the cup to his lips and takes a cautious sip, and then another. He’s expecting, perhaps, too much espresso and not enough milk, but to his surprise the coffee tastes exactly as it’s supposed to, with just the right hint of cocoa powder.
Sherlock gave me that same smile again as the lift doors closed, agreeing only somewhat breathlessly, “Correct, John. They did not observe.”
Christmas at my parents’ house makes that uptick quite understandable. It’s a blend of the familiar and the uncomfortable—in fact, the second comes from the first. There’s laughter and warmth, candlelight with curtains drawn against the early dark, and everyone mostly of good cheer. But underneath are the layers of years past, bubbling with the sorrows and resentments that I’m to understand saturate all families, and certainly didn’t spare a family of eccentric geniuses.
They wouldn't want to live always in such isolation, but in the winter light, when time cracks open, there are always—only—two of them.
An indignant yelp from the mobile. “Sorry, Mummy.” Eyeroll. “I didn’t mean to curse, Mummy.” Further squawking and squeaking. “Yes, Mummy. Yes. Yes, we’ll be there.”
he managed to make shattering by singing the line twice in a lower octave, the third time with searing intensity an octave higher.
Roberto’s dinner was fine. The rice wasn’t spoiled, and the peas were a bright, sweet green in which taste and scent and colour blended in a vivid memory that I hadn’t even been aware I was harbouring. As we ate we talked in a desultory fashion, Roberto periodically touching my wrist, my fingers, caressing my neck, leaning over and kissing me. I realised I did none of this to him. What we did together was sex, and dancing.
Sherlock never used baby talk with Rosie, whether or not she understood him. He said it would just be background noise until one word after another came clear to her. But she seemed to understand “stay on your blanket” well enough, and when her lip began to wobble, he picked up the violin and began to play: “Smile Though Your Heart is Aching.”
Donovan was going to want to know all of this, exactly what he’d seen, why he’d called her. Lestrade. Whatever.
Everything that I am responded to everything that he is: compact, controlled, composed—and at the same time tired, despondent, perhaps at the end of his hope. All this I saw before I let my gaze run over his posture, his cane, phone, haircut, tan lines. From the moment I looked up from the microscope and saw him standing there, I knew him for my own.
Dissonance. Unsettled, jagged. The pieces of our mutual and multiple deceptions colliding with a jarring clang. What had I meant to tell John? Why had I aborted? I must tell him everything, now, I just had to remember what—ah. of course.
It must have been a coincidence that John’s fifth song wished me sleep, and comfort, in the arms of an angel. (In his second song, the absent friend had been angel, and brother.)
“It sounds ridiculous, but I was terrified. I tried to shout your name, but the wind blew sand into my throat and I knew I was going to die without seeing you again. Ridiculous.”
I hadn’t believed that sex really could compete with cocaine in terms of bliss. He was a tender and attentive lover.
“Don’t worry about Mycroft. I’m not. I’m more concerned about being noticed by anyone in the media. I don’t want to drag the corpse of my old life over here and wear it, explain it.”
John had the image of his corpse seared into his memory; now he saw it from behind, as it were. Moriarty pulling the strings, Mycroft facilitating the simulation, Sherlock sacrificing everything for his friends. For their survival.
The questioning wasn’t working as well, now. Her eyes were half-closed and her breathing was accelerating. He knew this stage: she was beginning to feel the pain, he was sure.
John met a woman in the pub in Grasmere and chatted her up half-heartedly, on auto-flirt. She was close to his age, blonde and fit but not showing anything off except a yin / yang tattoo on her wrist. He was enjoying their conversation; she was intelligent and amusing, and the familiar ritual hovered somewhere between distraction and relaxation. Soon enough Sherlock lifted himself carefully from his chair, announced cordially that he was going to “er—turn in,” and bade them goodnight.
Thank you to the artists who accepted my commissions and whose work inspired me more than I even knew at the time. For example, the ominous "rec" mark on Mycroft's surveillance photos--that was all Procoffeinating, and I ran with it.
For my first ten months away, I had run insane risks. I’d nothing to lose; I’d lost everything I valued. If I did get killed, I wouldn’t be any more dead for John than I already was.
He reached into the shower, turned on the water. A hot shower would help, then the rooftop and the violin. Not the bow; too late, now. Pizzicato. The city lights, the black sky tinged with orange from the street lamps. The glass walls of the bedroom. He could think, there. Think about this worrying ... episode. Would this have happened with John? If he’d ever slept with John, would this aversion have followed?
The bitterness in John’s voice was understandable, but it still stung. He was jealous of a rival for my attention for practically the first time. (I discounted the implausible Adler, and Janine.) I, by contrast, had lived with that feeling practically since we met.
It was six months after my swan dive off the roof that Mycroft told me: someone identified only as John was dedicating songs to “an absent friend,” via a Sunday evening radio programme.
room—at the same hotel on the canal. To my surprise they remembered us. (Then again, I suppose we had put on quite a show in the breakfast room that first morning.)
“Hmm?” John looks up and asks, noncommittally. If she wants to speak she’ll have to take her courage in both hands—he’s not going to make it easy for her.
All I needed was to find a will, or proof that there wasn’t one (and it would be so like Sherlock to consider it
We stop a bit short of the summit; I pointed out that the wind will be at its worst at the most exposed point, and we won’t be able to settle in and survey the blue-white winter fields and hillsides if our eyelashes are frozen shut. That had prompted an eyeroll but reluctant concession.
He woke the next morning with Sherlock’s head on his shoulder, hair in his nose, and body taking up about 90% of the bed. After "I don't sprawl, I huddle," it was a bit rich. Or maybe he’d misheard “cuddle.” It hardly mattered; the perfect statue sound asleep almost on top of him made this unquestionably the best morning of his life.
Now there's half an hour or so before they will dance together, and he can freshen his drink (still sparkling water—he won't be making
“Listen, got to go, patient waiting. Thanks, Greg. Let’s get together soon, yeah? Come over and see the rug rat.” My proposal was as sincere as his acceptance, though God only knew when we’d get around to it.
Sherlock himself was badly compromised by what he’d suffered, what he’d done. I half-expected him to plunge back into his normal / abnormal mode of frenetic activity, but if he was ever tempted to try, he wasn’t up to it. He was unusually subdued. In anyone else I’d have called it depression. Most days Rosie brought him to life much better and faster than I could.
We made our way out of that dark time, nonetheless. With the entirely unexpected help of a compelling rival for my “affections.” I haven’t said so to John—it would have been picking a pointless fight—but he would never have decided to choose me, to pursue me, to take me into his life and Watson’s, had it not been for Roberto Zanardi’s own pursuit. And after, my month in Rome had shown John two things: both that I could be a partner in all senses, and that I was not waiting, quiescent, for him to make a move.
for bidding on me. And for such a good song, too. It really works.” He colours as if he’s made a gaffe. Sherlock doesn’t let him back down.
This attempt at a neutral summary did no justice to the sharp agony of finding that through my own neglect I had lost my wife, my family.
I put on a leather jacket he’s never seen, and decide, since he’s being disingenuous, that I will be too. “Yes,” I say airily, “might be dawn. I might see you as you’re heading off to work.”
They’d met at the only other Italian restaurant besides Angelo's that Sherlock regularly frequented. His host had been as flustered as a—what did Molly always say? a
I wake up on my back with John plastered to my side. Our hands clasped loosely. His face buried in my neck. His cock pressing against my hip. (If I were to turn to face him it would be pressed into my belly; mine, just as hard, would be between his thighs.) The scent of his hair and his breath, the sound of his quiet breathing. He’s warm, always so warm. His left knee is bent over mine, and the sole of his foot is flat against my calf. There isn’t another centimetre of us that could be touching and still it isn’t enough.
They’d haunted him until he confessed how they were eating away at him, and I’d made a Christmas project of restaging them: John in my place, and myself in Roberto’s. To replace them. Evict them.
“Of course. Not an infinite number, though. Twenty is the canonical number. And there are some I won’t answer.”
If Sherlock's had any illusions about being the motive force in this elaborately staged seduction they’re gone now, dissolved and discarded as John's hands slide up under the tailcoat and flatten out on his shoulder blades, holding him up and in place. For his part Sherlock can only hold on, clutching John and murmuring (
anyone else’s blood. Only John’s. But that wasn’t the point, so I just smiled and said, “if you say so.” His insistence on my universal appeal was contradicted by my own experience, but that wasn’t germane to the moment either, so.
“Well, you’re still arrogant.” But it was a backhanded compliment: she felt on firm enough ground to tease.
“Today, while you two were … doing whatever it was that you were doing, I spent six very productive hours interrogating Mary Morstan.” Yet again, knowing Mycroft made me glad that I never had a brother.
“Body and mind, heart and soul.” All those dimensions I used to think were separable components, John knew to be inextricable. And he loved them inextricably; and I was learning to.
separate us instantly, and I was careful, we both were. That fear has retreated. What we have now—what we always should have had—feels unbreakable, though we still have a long road ahead of us.
Mine was never a theological faith, in any case. I placed my faith in reason; in empirical science; in a rule-governed universe. Never in a god, and only occasionally, and selectively, in a human being.
At the sight of his brother Sherlock pulled up short and felt his brows lower in displeasure before he could assume his mask of indifference and chill his voice to sub-freezing.
“Is that a problem? Have I embarrassed you? If so, I’m truly sorry. I never meant to make you feel ill at ease.”
If Mary was surprised to see him come back from Baker Street so early, she was too tactful to mention it. He decided against going to Mycroft first and admitting that he had literally no information about Sherlock. So he rang Lestrade and Molly Hooper, and from them got the same story: Sherlock had called in, apologised for everything, and said he was going away indefinitely, left no forwarding address.
“That you, Scotty?” He couldn’t see Ash, but reckoned she was behind the row of Montbretia and needed leave to stay there, needed him to confirm he wasn’t a customer wanting help.
“You look wonderful. How do you not age a day, you witch? Your kids are what, thirteen and fifteen? And here you are still all Audrey Hepburn with a brogue?”
“I confess I’m more interested in publication as a mode of dissemination.” He noted with annoyance his own professorial tone; the problem with being a chameleon was the tendency to parrot those around him. He tried again. “That way, it’s on the audience to keep up or catch up, and I don’t have to wait around while they do.”
I wanted that night out with him, wanted to see him marvel at my city that was ancient when London was young, wanted to see his eyes open wide and register the magnetic mystery that was Rome. But somehow every single evening that desire was outpaced by the shivering want that took over the minute I saw him. The minute I let myself think of him. Remember him. Remember our last night of lovemaking, and the taste of him.
In mid-December the Kensington case closed, with a fair amount of media coverage and several quite dramatic photographs of Sherlock above the fold. The press was driven by the prominence more of the victim than of the consulting detective, but it was a plain and strategic fact that Sherlock’s face was more photogenic than the victim’s, by a good cut.
He never looked back. From that moment on the plane Roberto spoke only Italian to me, maybe thinking he could draw me out of other memories and hopes I might have had. We would learn each other’s ways—in and out of bed—entirely in that musical language that could become quite raw with sensation and emotion. And for that night, at least, it worked. I wanted to give him that, something of me untouched by fantasies of John’s expressions or by any words at all that belonged to John. To replace those with words like
he had set for John’s texts. His stomach lurched and he felt faintly dizzy, off-balance. So much for “out of sight, out of mind;” replacing John hadn’t worked, at all. Sherlock had known that for weeks, but the letter—was from a week ago. Faced with real-time contact from John he felt his heart begin to thud. He opened the text with a hand now far more unsteady than when he'd opened the letter.
It was real. Against all odds, it was real. I eased my thigh between his, and started to stroke his chest as gently as I could, wanting to touch but not wake him. He was solid and still, so silent I wanted to check his heartbeat again, but his skin was warm and soft to the touch. My hand wandered over the muscles of his chest, his nipples, his collarbones. When I heard him draw a sharp breath I hesitated, then whispered, “This all right?”
Sherlock took longer than usual in the shower, and that’s a high bar. I was about to go up and check when he came down, his embarrassingly ill-fitting outfit covered with a wool blanket he’d taken from the guest bed. He’s—well, I can’t help it, he’s endearing in the way he has to curate his appearance, even in private, even with me.
be the jealous, possessive sod you have to walk on eggshells around. Want you not to have to avoid Italian ice cream, or coffee, or dinner at Angelo’s. I want you to be completely at ease with me on, well, any topic.” If I’d been standing I’d have shuffled, I was that ill at ease myself.
In early December, nearly six months after Sherlock flew out of my world and left me all but dead in it, I had the radio programme play him a song that came out of the embryonic hope germinating in my brain: “We’ll Meet Again.”
Nothing that night either, or the next day. Mary could tell he was increasingly anxious, and finally made him spill the fact that he’d reached out to Sherlock and received no response.
Sherlock went rigid with surprise, then remembered there was a protocol for this kind of thing. Fighting off  the sensation, the scent, of John, he hugged back, then patted John gingerly on the shoulder.
He opens the phone. Roberto. No text, just a link to an mp3 file. A song by Paolo Conte: “Via con me.”
Sherlock sat up eagerly, told Mycroft to come at once, and rang off. Mycroft had ordered us to “take care to be decent, for pity’s sake.”
I’d met Lestrade’s team—and Sherlock—at NSY the day I arrived from Italy, and three weeks of complete turmoil followed. Multiple teams of different organizations were working on the joint operation, and I was busy relaying information between all of them and my own department back in Rome. But whenever I could manage it I shadowed Lestrade, because that was the way to see Sherlock, at least at first. I wanted to either confirm this infatuation or get over it. To my uneasiness but also delight, my fascination with him only grew.
My insides roil when I hurt John. I’ve done it so many times, and I never meant to, and I don’t want to let it happen again. My voice as gentle as I can make it I tell him,
) And in Italy I always longed for English order, cooperation, patience. “Mustn’t grumble.” Italy and England pulled at me like the steps of two very different dances, and I danced each one like a man wishing and waiting to start the other.
He didn’t answer, but his hand settled over mine, and his breathing slowed down. Ages later, as we were drifting back into sleep, I heard him whisper “Okay.”
Still, I wanted to see him so badly that it actually hurt. I thought about inviting ourselves over to Baker Street for Christmas, spending the holiday with him. Even drafted a text proposing it. Well, I drafted various versions of that text, each one more transparently needy than the last.
I’d never experienced anything like this in all my life, and I whispered that to him, “only you, Sherlock,” “and “yes, like that,” and “I’m yours, only yours,” and, gritted out desperately, "
A year ago today I posted the last chapter of this fic, but promised to return with an epilogue. To everyone who's read and / or boosted this fic, to Khorazir and Bluebellofbakerstreet who
I went upstairs and pulled out the baby bathtub insert, rubber ducks and other bath toys, and grabbed  some clean towels and adult shampoo. In the hall closet there were some jogging pants and a hoodie, if not quite in his size.
Once he’d said it I couldn’t unhear it. I thought about it day and night. Oh, it wasn’t all I thought about. I had Sherlock back, and he filled the screen, all right. And Rosie. But I did some internet searches about retraining for surgery after a hiatus. And it was one of those electronic trails that he’d followed, nosy bastard that he still is, and signed me up on a course without my knowledge or permission. That I’d been so furious with him was just proof of how much the possibility meant to me.
Sherlock, I wanted to say, didn’t do “passing things.” I’d never seen him look at another man in ... ever. There was Irene Adler, but whatever the hell that was, it wasn’t a passing thing; there was Janine, but that had turned to be a sham. I hadn’t ever seen Sherlock sincerely admire, or encourage admiration in, another man. I thought I might throw up.
“It loves you, too. You were the most gorgeous thing on the floor.” The proximity of John, and the dearth of substantial layers between them, are far more interesting than this post-mortem of the dance the evening before, a million years ago.
Since the date of my first communication would be April 1st, I had the relative advantage of using a first line. Naturally I couldn’t think of a single one. Or rather, a single suitable one.
“What, did he make me laugh on purpose? Not always. He’s a mix of the English and the Italian, and sometimes that made me laugh, but it was rather one-sided. He’s more often funny accidentally than on purpose, perhaps. Paradoxically it brought you to mind: you’ve never asked me ‘what do you mean?’ or ‘what’s so funny?’ And for the record, though you should
Was I supposed to use the London A–Z again, as in Sebastian Wilkes’ case? Apply it to the song itself? Was the A–Z online?
, holding John’s hips so hard he’d leave bruises as they both came with a hoarse grunt and collapsed together to kiss, again and again.
“Now I just have to live through that damned anniversary.” Why was that a burden, now that he knew Sherlock was alive?
. When I finally called Lestrade back, after weeks of shouting at the phone whenever his name showed on it—he just sighed and said
The voice coming from the phone was weeping, trying to conceal it but undoubtedly weeping. “I love you. Heather, I love you. I’ll be there soon.
Sherlock told me once that the frailty of genius is that it needs an audience; I never could tell whether there was any self-aware irony to that sentence, the great show-off. But perhaps the frailty of genius is not even ego, but hyper-subtlety: it projects its own complexity on the world around it.
“I wish I knew. I fell in love—well, at first sight, really, but it’s taken me years to realize it. To accept it. I fell in love with someone I never, ever, would have imagined I could have desired. And now—yeah, it’s basically all I think about. I want us to be together, all the time. Preferably
Staring up at Sherlock now, Greg seems to smile as though proud of him for figuring something out. He murmurs, “Good man. Sometimes you just have to dare, don’t you? Sometimes you just have to take a chance.”
Thanks to every one of you reading this, for going dancing with Sally and the boys. Thank you for sharing my love for the music they danced to—give me your favorite songs and versions of them, and I'll be forever in your debt.
After spending our Christmas under the radar, we had an intense moment when Mrs Hudson came back from her sister’s. It had been an unwontedly long visit, in part because she’d been too bowed by prolonged mourning to take any pleasure in Christmas in Baker Street. We heard her arrive on Friday the 28
to make a will). Did he have an estate? An executor? Heirs? After filling out a twelve-page form, submitting it and waiting for the results, the response came back: no will had been registered for probate purposes. Internet research then showed me that either there was a will that had not needed probate, or there was no will at all.
on him, at any rate. And he doesn’t even know if he wants a relationship at all, let alone one with me.”
“No, and no. I never felt any urgent need to follow up on it. Until you, Mister Married-to-my-work.”
I walked in and turned on the light by the sofa. But it wasn’t our sofa. It was ... new. Much larger, too. Large enough to make Sherlock, with Rosie asleep on his chest, look endearingly small in it.
? This couldn’t be the sitting room of 221B, a terrain carefully mapped out with boundaries and barriers, the space sectioned off into
Getting out of that indeterminate vehicle was pure terror, yet I couldn’t find the words to say so, or why.
For the past week Sherlock had been trying to impress a bloke who looked (but only looked) quite like John himself. Dressing to kill. Tidying the flat. Writing with this stranger, and excluding John. What did it all mean, anyway?
Surprisingly he doesn't seem to have heard me. Lost in concentration. Me too, after awhile. Admiring his gleaming black hair, his lean but muscled frame. His confidence, his independence. And I think what it's always done for me to have him in my corner. He's more than in my corner, of course. He's the ground beneath my feet, the air inside my lungs. The light in my head.
“I swear, Sherlock, if this is some kind of a lark, or a hoax, or an experiment—” Now John was getting agitated, but it still wasn’t out of repulsion.
I was thrilled when he said yes: exhilarated and terrified at the same time. I’d never had a reason to care whether a man was receptive to me or not.
Hilltowns are different in Sicily; they don’t dominate the height, but cling limpet-like to the slopes. We stopped to photograph several, their terraced layers stepping gingerly down the hillside like the cascading open drawers of Mummy’s tiered jewel-box that always lured me as a child.
“Damned hard, in fact. But we’re—we’re not just a couple. We’re a family, and a life, and a business, even. We’ll have to figure it out, or we’ll have to go our own ways.”
They seem to move automatically in sync, John competent if not effortless, coordinated if not smooth, and Sherlock’s overcome with tenderness at kind, caring John stepping outside of his comfort zone like this. He bends down and discreetly breathes in John’s hair, his slight sweat from the slight exertion of their slow, swaying dance. This alone could almost, almost, be enough.
John stared: the waxwork occupying Sherlock’s chair was deep in the Mind Palace and apparently had been for some time. It was a bit creepy, he knew, to take advantage of this absorption to stare unseen. Like watching someone sleep without their knowledge or permission. But the temptation was irresistible.
His voice was surprisingly normal, but I was braced for an uncomfortable conversation once we did get indoors. This was hardly the ending I’d been imagining, to our stimulating day.
He didn’t look up. “I didn’t want to hear you lie to me. About where you’d been, and with whom. Yes. I’ve been thinking the worst. I’m sorry not to have trusted you even enough to ask you about this.”
He grimaced, knowing exactly which night I meant. Before answering he dipped his head down and kissed both my collarbones. It felt surprisingly... good. I’d never thought of them as particularly sensitive, but his smooth lips and his stubble made a distracting contrast. Because it was John the sensation was overwhelming.
Those chaotic minutes presented the only real danger, of being shot more by accident or by ricochet than by design. When the dust settled and the lights went up, fifteen men and two women were each in the grip of two agents. Sherlock saw Roberto stride over to one still-struggling man and bend down to say something in his ear. The man jerked his head upward when he heard it, whatever it was, and his look of panic was quite gratifying.
“The way you talked with that poor man, Sherlock. The way you cared about his wife. You always ... wanted me to think you couldn’t care about people that way. Why did you hide that part of yourself away?”
The arcades I walk down feel even colder than the streets and piazzas; they channel an icy draft of wind, and the darkness hides the mellow colours that lent the city warmth by day. It’s hard to believe it’ll be spring in a couple of weeks. It’s going to be our best spring ever. His, and mine, and Rosie’s.
My stomach was sour with outrage that Mycroft had shown John photographs of me and Roberto together. Doing God knows what. It was utterly unfair to John, to imprint images in his mind that would likely be indelible. To Roberto, to expose him to the gaze of total strangers. But none of this was John’s fault, so I tried to compose myself and save my fury for my hellbeast of a brother.
worse than tedium. But I never feel tedium, so that’s not it, either. I’m never bored with you, John. Or with Watson, either. You’re both fascinating.”
When it was time to get out again and resume investigating, I started with the Camden Council’s Registry Office, the nearest one to Barts Hospital where the death would have been registered. It turned out the registration had been delayed beyond the usual five-day deadline, because there’d been an inquest. Sherlock’s death certificate had been registered by Mycroft almost a month after the Incident, and it showed that the form certifying the cause of death had been signed by Molly Hooper.
