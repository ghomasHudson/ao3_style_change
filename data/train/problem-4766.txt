“It’s a fine line,” Dean said shrugging. “Anyway, show me your outfit properly, you know you want to.”
“Bitch,” he said without heat and shoved Sam’s shoulder.
This is sort of a stand alone story but since Dean's emotions and motivations are closely tied to what happened in the previous story, I decided to post it as a second chapter rather than separately.
“Do you have any idea how horny I am since you've been gone?”
It had taken leaving home for Cas to become comfortable in his own skin. Castiel’s friends within the Church weren’t people he could truly be himself with, if there had even really been a himself for him to be. He had never felt like a fully realised person while he was under his father’s roof. He was more like an automaton, simply carrying out the tasks his father had programmed into him.
“I love you, sweetheart.”
Wiping cocoa off his chin, Dean said, “Shit, Cas, I’m so sorry. What... what happened?”
Cas clung to Dean for a long moment before he realised what he was doing and pulled away. Dean didn’t need to see him like this.
Cas snorted at the silly double entendre. Shaking his head, he dug into his own pizza, which had some actual vegetables on it. They ate and drank beer and chatted as they watched TV. It was simple and easy, and it felt like they’d been doing it for years. Dean wanted to keep doing it for years to come. He didn’t know why he felt so much for Cas so quickly. It just seemed like they had formed a connection almost instantly. He couldn’t explain it and as much as he relished it, it scared him a little.
Dean snickered and then said, “I got asked to do the honey trap thing once. The whole thing was fucked up. This woman was worried that her husband was secretly gay, and I mean, I felt bad for her. She was pretty upset. But, c’mon, if you think your husband is lying to you, your first port of call should really be to try having an actual honest conversation with him, not to hire someone to set him up!”
Turning away a touch regretfully, Dean went to the bathroom. He emptied his bladder and then stood for what was definitely too long with his hand on the flush, wondering whether to push it or not. Cas had looked so peaceful and he didn’t want to wake him. But he also didn’t want Cas to get up later, use the bathroom and think Dean was the kind of hippy who just let it mellow if it was yellow. In the end, he flushed the damn toilet. He wasn’t an animal.
“If I'm stuck here, can I at least have some real pants?” he asked and tried not to wince when it came out sounding like whining.
Questions had no place in the Church. Doubt was a sure sign that the Devil was leading you astray. And if it seemed a little too convenient that anything but blind faith was unacceptable, unforgivable, well, that was just a coincidence, not a deliberate design built into the foundations of the Church itself.
“What’s up, Sammy, what’s up? I’m stuck in the middle of nowhere with a sketchy angel who keeps telling me we’re married!” Dean blurted with a rising edge of panic.
“You’re such a drama queen,” Sam said, entirely without sympathy for Dean’s suffering.
Cas looked over at Dean and found him already looking back at him. Dean was looking at him like
“This is very thoughtful, thank you.”
“What is it you want with me,
“Poor Cas,” Sam continued. “I hope you didn't leave him to fend for himself.”
Cas nodded and reached up to cup his cheek. “I want you,” he said, looking into Dean’s eyes.
He couldn’t... but it was what Cas wanted...
“Only if
“I can’t believe you quoted Titanic. I was just starting to like you.” Meg looked at him sternly and pointed a finger in his face. “Bad Dean, no, no,” she said to him like he was a dog who’d pissed on the rug.
Dean looked down at his outfit, a pair of black jeans—so far, so normal—and a sleeveless, lavender leather jacket over a lilac mesh t-shirt, which admittedly weren’t as butch as his usual clothing choices.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Richard?”
“It’s the nature of the spell. A spell like this, it’s complicated. It’s best to go the slow, gentle route. I’ve set the healing in motion. The root problem is fixed but your brain needs to take its own time to remember things. It’s a process. It might take a few days. I know it’s frustrating and I don’t like it eith-”
Cas was hunched down at the table, folded into himself, like he wanted to get as small as he could and disappear. Dean had done this, to this freaking force of nature, this angel, he’d made him small and sad. This was so wrong. Dean felt suddenly sure he was meant to be the one protecting him, not hurting him. The strength of that feeling scared him, so he shrugged it off. This was just a guy, a friend of Sam’s, and he should behave better because that was the decent thing to do. That was all.
“Sure.”
“I’m Castiel, but you call me Cas.”
“You’re my what now?” Dean yelped, jumping up and looking stunned, before pacing away.
“I can’t believe you added more meat to a meat lover’s pizza,” Cas said when their food arrived.
Cas knew that Dean appreciated his tattoos, but the man also loved his food and probably wouldn't eat ramen for months just to get some ink. Perhaps it was a little silly in hindsight. Or maybe not silly, it had been important to him at the time and still meant a lot to him now. But it was rather cliché.
“Not weird, Dean,
Dean laughed so hard that his back arched and his dick slipped out of Cas's grasp. Somehow, the joke didn't break the mood. It just shifted it from hot and heavy to sweet and playful and helped to dissipate the last of Dean’s nerves.
"Don’t humans normally use terms of endearment for each other in these sorts of situations?" Cas asked, looking a little embarrassed.
It had been a long time since Dean had woken up next to someone he cared about. A long time since he’d woken up next to anyone at all. His head was still foggy with sleep and his eyes were still closed but he could feel Cas’s presence next to him, radiating warmth and comfort. Waking up next to Cas was somehow simultaneously an absolute surprise and the most natural thing in the world. Dean snuggled in closer to the pliant body beside him and felt Cas’s arm tighten slightly around his waist.
Dean respected his need to let the subject of their shitty childhoods drop and jumped on the new topic. “Order in? I don’t know about you, but I don’t have the energy to cook tonight. We could get Chinese. Or did you have your fill of that at Christmas?”
“You sure?”
But Cas looked disappointed, so Dean relented and put his hands up. He hoped Sam wasn’t looked in their direction or he’d never hear the end of this. Cas rewarded him with a smile so bright that he found he didn’t care even if Sam did see him dancing to Single Ladies. Maybe Beyoncé had a point, Dean thought as he looked over at Cas, he did like it and he should put a ring in it. Terrible taste in music notwithstanding, Cas was a keeper.
Dean had loved Lisa, he really had, but that was different. The man he was when he was with Lisa was at most half of himself. He could be his whole self with Cas, love with his whole self and have someone who could love his whole self in return. The love he shared with Cas was orders of magnitude above anything he’d had with anyone else. He brushed his lips across Cas’s in a tender caress before drawing back.
Cas didn’t want to sit there on the phone answering the kind of stupid questions that people inevitably called with while alternately staring out the window at the passersby and turning his back to the view as he tried to forget what he’d seen—
“Use humour to put up walls.” He stroked Dean's cheek softly. “Don't hide from me.”
“I ordered it over a month ago!” Sam said, sounding defensive, as well he might.
He headed down the corridor to the Dean Cave and rooted around in the hamper of hot sauces he’d given Cas earlier. He picked out the one made with ghost peppers since it was the spiciest. Honestly, it was hotter than anything Dean himself could handle, not that he'd ever admit that given he prided himself on his very manly taste buds. He presented it to Cas with a flourish when he returned to the kitchen.
“Hurry up. I want you inside me.”
“She's still sleeping—I wore her out,” she said, winking exaggeratedly.
One kiss led to another and it soon became a full on make out session. Dean was never going to feel the same way about the library again. He was sure he was going to get a flashback to this moment the next time he was sitting at the table and caught sight of this chair. There were probably going to be a lot of inappropriate hard-ons while trying to do research in the future.
“You haven't undressed me.”
Dean thought. Though it occurred to him that the couple thing wasn’t really a unilateral decision. Perhaps, he should check Cas was on the same page. Jesus, asking someone if he could be their boyfriend made him feel fifteen again. He paid for their drinks and went back over to Cas. Dean was pretty sure he couldn’t dance with the appletini without throwing syrupy green liquid over half the dancefloor, so he suggested they go back to the table. At some point, the number of chairs at their table had dwindled, so Sam ceded the seats to them and went to dance with his new friend. The music changed shortly after he got up. Dean smiled when he recognised the song as Baby One More Time. Sam started to dance dorkily to Britney Spears, so he wouldn’t have a leg to stand on later if he wanted to give Dean a hard time about dancing to Beyoncé. He was still smiling when he looked over at Cas.
“I love you too,” Dean said. Cas glowed at that and went a little blurry. It took Dean a moment to realise Cas was blurry because Dean had gone all teary eyed. He cleared his throat self-consciously. “What would you call it then?” he asked, just for something to say, so he could focus on talking instead of crying.
Cas glanced around the bedroom, likely looking for his underwear.
“It’s a very nice gesture, Dean,” Cas reassured him, sitting up. “It’s not the same as when I was human but I have been eating a bit more food lately. I’ve found that I can taste it more if the flavours are strong, something sweet or spicy.”
“Don't get me wrong, I’m sure they’re good and all, I just thought there’d be more cowboys in an exhibit on the Old West.”
“How are you dressed right now?” he asked.
“Dean said that you like sweet things too. I got it at the farmer's market. They said it’s made by local bees, so, who knows, maybe some of them got nectar from flowers out front.”
“It’s like she’s the living embodiment of all my Slave Leia and Xena Warrior Princess fantasies!”
Cas was sitting across the room in his uncomfortable armchair when Dean woke up. He stretched and looked over at him appreciatively. Cas had put on Dean’s t-shirt from the day before, an old grey tee with AC/DC emblazoned on it in red. The shirt was a little loose on him, but he looked perfect in it. Dean didn't know why Cas was wearing his t-shirt when they were at Cas's apartment with plenty of his own clothes to choose from, but he liked it. He liked it very much. Cas wasn't the only one who could be possessive.
Growing up in motel rooms more often than not, Dean was used to no privacy. So, he knew how to hide his damn porn (they hadn’t had a computer, so it meant hiding actual magazines rather than just clearing the browser history). More importantly than that, Dean knew how to hide his money. Maybe he’d done the latter too well because John had found his porn stash while looking for booze money. It would have been better if John had found the money.
It wasn’t just that he was devastatingly handsome, which—
“Er, no reason. I know a lotta things about a lotta things...” Dean mumbled evasively.
“Not helping, Sam,” Dean and Charlie said at the same time.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Only for a fee? Since when are you gay for pay?” she asked as she swept through the door, graceful even though the actual freaking ballgown she was wearing looked too wide to fit through the entrance.
He had left home just before he turned eighteen and arrived in San Francisco damaged, socially awkward and utterly alone in the world. It had surprised no one more than Meg herself when she’d taken Cas under her wing shortly thereafter. On the surface, they seemed to be opposites, but dig only a little deeper and they were kindred spirits.
“Yes, but these jeans are part of my costume!”
“Woah, I don’t think so buddy! I’m leaving-”
Even the two cups of coffee he’d already had this morning hadn’t woken him up sufficiently. Perhaps that should be expected. He was emotionally exhausted in a way caffeine just couldn’t touch. Cas actually felt better than he had all week, but he was still tired. The persistent racing of his thoughts had slowed. The niggling sense that something bad was about to happen seemed to have finally vacated the home it had made for itself in the back of his mind. He was calm but drained.
What if he was wearing the wrong clothes? Cas didn’t know what you were supposed to wear for a date. He’d just thrown on black jeans and an old
“Excuse me?” he asked in a dangerously low tone and let go of Cas’s hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Since when?” Cas repeated, narrowing his eyes at her.
“Wanna tell me why this place has no weapons but an orgy’s worth of lube?”
“But then they fixed it! They exhumed the gay! Nobody ever exhumes the gay!”
“Whatever. Not important. How about you explain how I can I have amnesia when I remember literally everything else but you?”
“Of course not. Modern art isn’t something that appeals to everyone. I won’t think less of you if you don’t like it or it doesn’t make sense to you. I don’t think I understood any of the art when I first came here. I hadn’t been exposed to anything like it before. And of course, plenty of the paintings don't really mean anything—”
“Look, if you’re uncomfortable, you don’t have to act like his husband. No renewing your vows or screwing him till you remember, okay? Just be civil. Cas won’t push you for anything.”
“There’s my favourite twink!” she called out loudly after the shop bell tinkled.
An issue of Busty Asian Beauties was kind of an awkward gift to open sitting next to your new boyfriend. Sam was going to pay for this. When he realised it was a magazine, Dean had naively thought it would be a car magazine, or maybe Guns & Ammo. But nope, his little brother had brought him a skin mag. Worse, it was the first magazine in a subscription, so he got to feel this awkward eleven more times this year. Dean didn’t know how to act with Cas sitting right there. Sure, people who had partners still looked at porn, but it didn’t seem right to flaunt it in your partner’s face. Not unless it was something you were deliberately looking at together. And he had no idea if Cas would want to do that. Moreover, he wasn’t sure of the etiquette of looking at straight porn when you were in a relationship with a man. God, was porn etiquette even a thing? Dean didn’t want to make Cas insecure. He didn’t want him thinking that Dean would prefer to be with a woman. Dean still liked women of course. Women were great and dating a guy hadn’t switched off his appreciation of them. But he was perfectly content with Cas. He didn’t need anyone else, man or woman. He wasn’t secretly missing straight sex when the gay sex he was having was more than enough to keep him satisfied. Dean had come to realise that sex was just sex, regardless of the gender of the person he was with. And sex was even better with someone you cared about, which meant sex with Cas was the best sex he’d ever had.
“We can say what we’re thankful for today too if you want, Cas,” Dean said, smiling at him.
Cas had a sketchbook in his lap. He’d look up at Dean, then down again at the paper and scratch a few lines with his pencil. There was a look of intense concentration on his face, a slight frown to his brow as he bit his lower lip. Dean was pretty sure Cas was drawing him.
“Client’s here,” Alfie called through the open door to the back of the shop.
“How long do you think I could tease you before you came?” Cas asked, but he didn’t seem to expect an answer outside of the moan Dean gave him. “I love watching you come undone. I want to see you lose it. I want to hear you cry out. I want to feel your whole body shudder against me.”
Cas nodded and let Dean manoeuvre his hand to grasp his cock more firmly. Dean placed his own hand over Cas’s and showed him how to touch him, a bit harder, fast strokes up and down with a little twist at the top so his palm brushed over the head of Dean’s cock in a way that made his breath catch in his throat.
Dean glared at him as he slid into the booth next to Cas. He switched his glare to Sam when he saw that he was grinning too.
“It’s an installation by Miroslaw Balka.”
He pulled Dean into a hug and stroked his hair, murmuring soothing words to him. Dean seemed confused as to why he was suddenly the one being offered comfort, but he hugged Cas back tightly. After a while, they drew apart, finished the rest of their quickly cooling cocoa in silence and went back to bed.
“That might not be enough. I’m very hurt. You might need to fuck it better,” Cas told him dryly.
“Just a sec,” he said and reached across Dean to get the lube out of the bedside table.
“Don't worry Bobby, hard as I try, I just can’t seem to get the dude I’m seeing pregnant.” Dean sighed. “Maybe I’m doing something wrong.”
“It’s the entirety of it. I didn’t want to wear a costume, so my friend practically held me down and drew it on me,” Cas told him, rolling his eyes.
“It could never be too much, Dean. I’ll take anything you give me.”
not just an empty apartment.
Dean led a slightly bemused Cas over to the dancefloor. He had no idea when the last time he danced was, it felt like years ago. He was pretty sure Cas had never danced at all. Dean started moving and nodded at Cas encouragingly for him to do the same. He’d definitely never danced before. Cas was, well, he was terrible. He was an absolute fucking disaster. But he was a beautiful disaster and something in Dean’s chest went all gooey from watching him. Cas danced awkwardly, his movements uncertain and stilted, but with a hesitant smile on his face. Every so often he’d look at Dean enquiringly, as if to ask, ‘am I do this right?’ He really wasn’t, but Dean enjoyed watching him try.
Humming softly, he got out a mixing bowl and started making breakfast as quietly as he could. The smell of bacon would wake Cas or Dean would take him breakfast in bed. That was a thing one-night stands did, right? It wasn’t weird. Either way, he didn’t want to wake Cas by clattering around the kitchen like an asshole.
“Hey, Titanic didn’t suck that bad.”
“Good for you, boy.”
“Put your hands up,” Cas said, nudging him when the lyrics instructed those up in the club to do so.
you’re not listening. I don’t want a woman.”
“I can’t believe you guys aren’t wearing costumes!” Charlie shouted at them after a round of hugs and backslapping.
“I’m going to fuck you so hard when you get home.”
“Yes, Dean?”
Dean lay there and let himself be held, let himself be loved.
“Whatever,” Charlie said, waving off Dean’s comment like anyone reasonable would see that a character in
the pretty ones get distracted by me,” he assured Cas, winking.
“It’s alright. You don’t have to say anything. I never expected you to love me back.”
“Cas,” the man said. He was smiling rather indulgently at Dean, like he was an amusing child or an excitable puppy.
The bar was pretty busy, but Dean spotted a few guys vacating a table to head over to the dancefloor, where there were actually people dancing tonight instead of just loitering around drinking. He led Cas over to the newly empty table and they took a seat. He glanced over to see if Sam had their drinks yet and realised that he was busy getting chatted up at the bar by a short blond guy- well he looked short, but who wouldn’t next to that sasquatch. Sam looked mildly awkward, like he was trying to figure out how to say he was straight without looking like he was panicking just because he was getting hit on by a dude. He must have figured out some tactful way to say it though, because they smiled at each other, and Sam nodded over to Dean and Cas, as if to say, ‘I’m just here with those idiots.’ The blond guy said something that made him laugh and then Sam was headed over to them carrying three beers and trying not to bump into too many people.
“I’m stuck with a preachy angel. Awesome,” Dean muttered to himself.
“I want to be inside you,” Dean said hesitantly, feeling unsure of his welcome and unworthy of being granted entrance to Cas’s body. Afraid to ask for something instead of just offering.
“Don’t be smart with me boy, you still gotta use protection with guys.” Bobby gave him the gimlet eye before turning to Sam. “And what about you?”
Dean was pretty sure the mouthful he had taken was at least eighty percent syrup, but he still liked seeing Cas enjoy his cooking. He dug into his own breakfast a little smugly, savouring the sweetness of the syrup contrasting with the saltiness of the bacon.
He’d had friends back home, but they were few and far between and their friendships were all within the strictures of the Church. Spending time with your friends was more likely to be hanging out at Bible study than hanging out watching TV. There was always adult supervision and only approved activities were allowed. Approved activities often involved tasks done in service to the Church.
Cas flowed to his feet and smiled at Dean. He had a drop of come hugging his full lower lip. Dean reached up to brush it away with his thumb. Cas caught his hand before he could wipe it off on his jeans as he’d intended. Instead, Cas leant in to lick the come from Dean’s thumb. He moaned blissfully like it tasted of goddamn honey and sunshine or something. Dean wondered if that was what spunk tasted like to angels and they didn’t get the same salty stuff everyone else was stuck with. Maybe it was just what Dean tasted like to Cas. Or he tasted like molecules but Cas liked Dean’s molecules best. Either way, it warmed something inside him. Dean kissed him and tasted himself. He definitely didn’t taste like honey. But that was fine because Cas was still sunshine, bright and pure, warm and nourishing, the wellspring that made life itself possible.
“It’s part of the experience,” Dean told him, so Cas accepted the hotdog and nibbled on it dutifully.
“You are adorable... also annoying,” Cas said with a shrug.
“Bathroom?”
“Sometimes.” Maybe it didn’t increase his serotonin, but it did make him smile. The tattoo had become something of a talisman. Cas had a tendency to reach for it in times of stress, gripping his left forearm with his right hand when he was anxious, or running his fingers over the inked lines to soothe himself, tracing the patterns as if he was counting beads on a rosary. It always brought him comfort. The tattoo was like a reassurance from his best friend that everything was going to be okay. “Most months,” Cas continued, “I managed to scrape together enough for my meds. They helped a bit until I could afford therapy, which was much more useful.”
“Yes,” Cas said. He really didn’t care who was inside who as long as he was with Dean.
That wasn’t totally inaccurate. It did look almost exactly like a giant, black shipping container, except it was up on stilts so you could go underneath it and there was a ramp leading up to it so you could walk inside it. It might not seem like art if you compared it to Monet’s
“Yeah, better listen to your
Sam glanced up from his laptop.
You might think you don’t know him, but if someone said, ‘think of those vintage drawings of muscley gay men’, his drawings are the ones you’d picture!
“Aw come on, Clarence. That’s just short-sighted. Feed me and my mouth will be too full to mock you.”
“Fuck, Cas, your cock is gorgeous, you know that?”
Charlie started fiddling with her phone. It was already set up so it was linked to his Amazon Echo and she could override his music choices at will. A catchy guitar riff came out of his Alexa connected speakers. Dean recognised it as the beginning of ‘How Do Girls Even Do It’ by Childbirth.
he decided, and grabbed the eggs, milk and butter because—screw pancake mix—he made this shit from scratch.
conversation.
“Just... uh... just give us a sec,” Dean told Cas, before walking down the hallway with Sam.
“Haha.”
Dean looked intrigued by this, but his expression fell slightly when they reached the atrium.
he’d seen—last week. He stayed in the back room until he heard Meg greeting Alfie.
Dean’s nerves were strung tight and Sam was getting on his last one with his stupid hippy just-breath-through-your-fear attitude. When the seatbelt sign went off, Sam got up to go hit the head. Dean took the opportunity to lean over and fiddle with the headrest TV in front of Sam’s seat. He found the movie he wanted, fast-forwarded it to the right point and paused it. Then hit play when he saw his brother coming out of the restroom. Sam looked at the kids on the screen and frowned curiously as he sat down and then nearly jumped right out of his seat again when IT suddenly appeared on screen.
“Yeah, cheating spouses are kind of your bread and butter as a PI,” Dean agreed. “I know they can be annoying, but they pay well. And they keep the lights on while you’re waiting for the more interesting cases to come across your desk. You’re gonna make a great PI kid. And it’s cute that you wanna follow in your big brother’s footsteps.”
“What?”
“I can’t tell if you’re making fun of me or not,” Dean said, sounding suspicious.
“I’m surprised you recognise it as my work. How long was Alfie showing you pictures of my tattoos the other day?”
“Tempting, but I'm more of an open-faced sandwich kind of girl.”
If anyone doesn’t know, Tricia Helfer is the actress who played a cylon on Battlestar Galactica and a ghost on Supernatural. I definitely think Charlie would have a crush on her.
“Not my usual speed but it's kinda catchy,” Dean said of the music filling the car. He pointed at Cas and winked before he started to loudly, if somewhat inaccurately, sing along. “Cas, I wanna take you to a gay bar, I wanna take you to a gay bar, I wanna take you to a gay bar, gay bar, gay bar!" He enthusiastically drummed his hands on the steering wheel along to the upbeat tune. “I've got something to put in you,” Dean continued to sing, making Cas squirm.
“I’m not sure horns constitute a costume for you, Pazuzu. It’s more like an aspect of your true form has broken through the veil.”
Cas, still fully clothed, was lying on his side curled into Dean. His hand was tracing swirling patterns on Dean’s naked chest, which was moving up and down rather rapidly. Dean, who’d been looking up at the ceiling in a daze, turned to Cas.
Apart from being unable to stop herself from making the same joke
with a cock ring. It’s not on my cock, so I don’t think this technically counts as me
“Off. I want you naked.” Dean wanted no barriers between them, not even clothes.
“Of course, there's only one bed,” Dean jeered back at him childishly.
“Alright, just let me go change,” Sam said, walking down the corridor to his room.
He pulled Cas’s head down to kiss him as he thrust frantically into his hand. Dean fisted both his hands in Cas’s hair. His movements grew more erratic as Cas’s touch become more sure. Dean was unravelling. Partly it was the feel of Cas’s clever fingers on him and partly it was the sheer pleasure of knowing that it was
Dean stopped at the next Gas-N-Sip for road food. He got some chilli lime jerky to snack on and Cas chewed slowly on a single piece for the rest of the journey. Food still tasted mostly of molecules to him but he’d come to appreciate the nuances more. And he liked the ritual of sharing food with those close to him.
“Cas-”
He knew Sam was worried about the court case, no matter how prepared he already was, and the service there really was terrible. They’d finished their food a while ago and there was no sign of the bill. They got up to exchange a round of hugs before Sam and Gabriel left. Cas seemed a little confused by Sam hugging him, though not as confused as Dean felt when Gabriel hugged him.
“I'm not crying, you're crying!”
"Dammit, I'm not talking to the car, Cas! I'm talking to you. The car’s been here the whole time. Where were
Dean glared at the bed over Cas’s shoulder, looking like he’d just been struck by something.
“He said he was too close to the witch to come now. He... uh... also had some choice words for me. He pointed out that I may have been a dick-”
“Are you my boyfriend?” he blurted out.
Dean wasn’t crying, not really, he was just a little misty eyed. It was no one’s business but his if Cas baking him pie was a secret fantasy of Dean’s. There was just something about the man he loved taking care of him, making something he knew Dean loved just for him, that warmed Dean right the way through. The pie was apple and had a perfect flaky lattice top sprinkled with sugar. It was sweet and tart and so obviously made with love that Dean might have teared up again when he took his first bite.
“What you’re wearing is fine- you don’t have to change into assless leather chaps just because we’re going to a gay bar!” Dean called after him and laughed when Sam flipped him the bird over his shoulder and muttered something about having been to a gay bar before.
He didn’t. Cas never talked about it. Well, he’d gotten drunk and told Meg years ago. And then later, he’d told his therapist, when he could afford one. But Cas was still muzzy from sleep. His defences probably weren’t as high as they usually were, so he ended up telling Dean the truth, or at least some of the truth, some of the darkest parts of the truth even.
“Right?!” Dean said, throwing his hands up emphatically and sloshing his beer about. “I mean, come on! That's pretty gay. They have to know what they're doing!”
“You’ll stay?” he asked Cas.
“You never said what’s up with the honeycomb?”
“And so Ellen jumps up and yells, ‘You stop that right now, Joanna Beth!’ And then turns to us all mad and says, ‘Which one of you boys wrote down the name of a porno for charades?’” Dean said.
They broke apart suddenly when someone bumped into them.
“God,
“How do you know so much about this?”
“Us?” Dean asked. Cas had never mentioned having siblings.
“Alright
By the baffled expression on Cas’s face, he hadn’t known that. Dean hadn’t known cocks could be gorgeous either, had thought of them more in functional terms rather than aesthetic. But Cas’s cock looked good in his hand, long and thick, curving upwards in an intriguing away, the flushed head peeking out from the top of his fist. Dean couldn’t help wondering what it tasted like. He wasn’t quite sure if he was ready to find out or not, so he went back to kissing Cas. Dean pressed soft kisses along his throat, relishing the gasp Cas gave as he sucked a tender spot beneath his jaw. He went lower to kiss across his chest. His tongue flicked out to give Cas’s nipple a light lick, eliciting a groan. He drew the nub into his mouth and, very carefully, bit down. Cas’s hands clenched convulsively in his hair and he made a noise that Dean wasn’t sure whether to interpret as pained or pleased. He didn’t think Cas knew either since his hands couldn’t seem to decide if they were pulling Dean’s head closer or pushing it away. The sensitivity of Cas’s nipples definitely warranted further investigation another time, right now though, he was going somewhere.  He moved his mouth across Cas’s stomach, giving him a gentle nip there. The noise Cas made was definitely appreciative that time.
Dean made him an omelette for breakfast, even though he hadn’t really had time to cook. Then he insisted on giving Cas a lift to work in his sleek vintage car. Cas wasn’t convinced that driving would get him to the shop any quicker, driving not always being the most efficient way to get where you were going in the city, but Dean seemed to want to show off his car, so Cas indulged him. It was clear that Dean was very proud of his ‘Baby’. Cas thought his devotion to his car was rather endearing. He’d arrived at work slightly late but happy.
Cas had gone to Dean’s that night, though they hadn’t watched
Cas frowned at Dean like he was the one who was being the unreasonable.
Cas lay with his head on Dean's shoulder for a long time. Dean gently rubbed his back before falling asleep with his arm slung loosely around him. It was comforting, but Cas was restless after lying there for so long. He lifted Dean's arm, carefully so as not to wake him, and placed it next to Dean's torso. Then he rolled onto his side and wriggled over slightly until he could feel Dean's side against his back. That way they were still touching even if they were no longer entwined.
All those wants just tumbled around inside him till he wasn’t sure where to start. In the end he just laid down on Cas and thrust against him. He could feel Cas’s dick pushing up against his hip and the skin of Cas’s pelvis against his own hard cock felt amazing but it wasn’t quite what he wanted. He shifted slightly and lined them up so Cas’s dick was pressed against his own and that felt even better. Dean wrapped his hand around both of them, then took Cas’s hand and wrapped it around the other side. He let out a contented sound as he began to move. The pressure of Cas’s cock against his own, the feel of their palms, the closeness was exquisite. The rest could wait, right now, this was perfect. He just needed to feel Cas's skin against his and he needed them to come together. The latter didn’t take long at all. The whole thing was quick, dirty and wonderful.
“I'm trying too- trying to get Cas laid!”
and decided that perhaps Dean kinda likes Corey after all.
Apparently, this was the kind of ‘marriage’ where your other half had access to your phone. Dean couldn’t decide if that was cute or co-dependent. Or maybe just practical if you needed to make an emergency call and your emergencies weren’t the kind you dialled 911 for. Instead of clicking on ‘Sam’ in the phonebook, he entered his number from memory. It still rang through without an answer. He tried a couple of Sam’s backup numbers, just in case, but got nothing.
Cas laughed, and Dean’s heart squeezed. He loved that sound.
Castiel sat down woodenly at the table. Dean shovelled a mountain of slightly singed scrambled eggs onto plate in front of him while he tried to figure out what to say.
is still one of my favourite things on the internet!
They both stood there for a moment, smooshing their fingers into Charlie's petticoats, like the weirdos they were, until Charlie dropped her hand and raised her gaze to run it over Dean’s outfit.
They hadn't had sex since their fight. They’d held hands, they’d hugged, they’d snuggled on the sofa watching TV, they’d slept in the same bed, they’d kissed, but they hadn’t fucked. Dean thought Cas had been keeping his distance because he was still reluctant to trust him. As much as the idea of fooling around with Cas was exciting, more than that, Dean hoped that Cas wanting to get naked with him meant that Cas felt safe with him again, that intimacy meant trust in this case.
“Sweetheart, you gotta relax.” Dean put his hands on Cas’s hips and rubbed soothingly. “Loosen up.  It’s supposed to feel good- like sex,” he told him winking. Though as he watched Cas, he thought whoever had come up with that whole sex is analogous to dancing got it wrong, at least when it came to Cas, because Cas was an atrocious dancer, but he was amazing in bed. “Just let your body move to the music.”
The sight warmed something in Dean. It didn't feel like there was a stranger sitting in his kitchen. It felt like Cas was someone who should always be there on lazy Sunday mornings, eating his pancakes, drinking his coffee and smiling at him across the counter.
the light. They were offered salvation and willfully turned their backs on it. Mocked those who tried to offer them a place in the Kingdom of Heaven. They judged you. They corrupted you. You were better off staying within the Church, where it was safe, where people were good and knew the truth. And did not question that truth.
“There they are.” Dean pointed to the corner where Jesse and Cesar were.
“I look forward to seeing that.”
“Fuck!” he gasped. “That was... fuck... that was awesome, Cas. Just give me a minute and then I’m gonna return the favour.”
“Either she’s one hundred percent serious or it’s a long con and I won’t find out until she’s on her deathbed.” Cas lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper, “Cas, Cas, come closer.” He grabbed Dean’s shoulder when he leaned in. “I can’t believe you wore that stupid sweater, you big nerd!” Then, he coughed pitifully and closed his eyes, letting out a long, slow breath like it was his last.
Dean kissed him until his already plush lips were swollen, then he rolled Cas over and moved on to trailing kisses down his neck and chest. Dean looked up from tonguing a nipple to say, “I want to be inside you.”
“Cas, Cas, wake up! It’s a dream. You’re dreaming.”
Dean had only meant for them to have a drink at the bar when he suggested it. But Cas looked so damn cute. All Dean wanted to do was drag him into a dark corner and have his way with him. He knew he shouldn’t. They had a nice, comfortable hotel room to go to after the bar. Dean hadn’t felt like driving back the same night, so he’d found someplace close online. Well, technically, Sam had found it for him because Sam was a good brother like that. The hotel was nicer than the usual no-tell motels they stayed at on the road. It was the sort of joint that put mints on the pillows instead of somewhere that probably didn’t even put clean cases on the pillows. The problem was that the hotel suddenly seemed so far away. Dean wasn’t 22 anymore. He was probably too old to be doing this, but, damn, he needed to get his mouth on this man.
“Yes, if I have to...” the guy said, rolling his eyes.
“Ok, so you know my name. Wanna tell me yours?” he asked the guy watching him with wounded eyes.
“You’re wearing jeans,” Cas argued.
“Understand what?”
Cas smiled and ripped off the paper with all the enthusiasm of a kid on Christmas morning. He unveiled a smallish wicker hamper full of a variety of fancy hot sauces.
“Shut up, we’re younger than you are!”
He wanted to listen to Cas talk passionately about random topics, and curl up on the sofa with him as Cas made little frowny faces at what they were watching on TV because he thought the plot didn’t sense and he wanted to listen to Cas laugh and watch him sleep and just be there with him and enjoy the way his mind worked.
“But Abby wanted—”
They didn’t have time at the moment for a proper road trip. When they next had a vacation, Dean thought he would take Cas to see the Niagara Falls. He’d like that. He could imagine Cas watching the falls with solemn appreciation and summing them up with an understated, ‘So much water, impressive’. Now though, Sam was back at the bunker researching their next case. He could spare them for the weekend but that was it. Dean thought it would be a good opportunity to introduce Cas to America’s National Pastime. Sometimes doing something special for Cas was about doing the most ordinary thing he could think of. That was how they found themselves in Baby driving east up Route 24.
“—Abby will understand.” She raised her eyebrows suggestively. “And I have ways of making it up to her if she’s upset.”
“Damn right I am!” Meg held up her hand for a high five.
“Shut up, Sam!”
“How old were you when you first got a tattoo?”
Dean was lucky he was married to an angel because no mere mortal would be able to tolerate his bullcrap. Cas had been forced to put up with more than normal lately. The amnesia incident, aka the most recent time Dean had been a total dick, had only been a few weeks ago and Dean was still mired in guilt. It wasn’t entirely his fault. You’re not technically responsible for the things you did under the influence of an evil witch’s spell, right? The problem was that even if someone had taken a few scoops out of his melon, well, it was still his melon. He might not have had all his memories but he still had his asshole personality. So yeah, the shitty behaviour, that was all him, only the circumstances were the witch’s fault.
“Yeah?
By the time he set needle to skin, the atmosphere was surprisingly relaxed and Cas was deep in a very interesting conversation about bees with Cain. That lasted a while before they lapsed into a comfortable silence for the rest of the appointment.
It’s inspired by the American West.”
Apparently, a young woman killed herself in nineteenth-century Italy and some anatomist used her body to practise a preservation technique.”
Cas was so close and Dean just held him there, on the edge or pleasure, refusing to nudge him over. He was fucking him a little too gently. He wasn’t touching him except for where they were joined and a hand on Castiel’s hip. The hand kept Cas still when he tried to thrust back against Dean harder. It took Cas a while to realise what Dean wanted.
Cain looked surprised and then gave a deep rumbling laugh.
“You do?”
Dean’s own nerves dissolved under the confidence he got from knowing that Cas wanted him. So, he sounded a little cocky when he said, “I know, Cas, I know what you need.” And damned if he didn’t want to give it to him right here but he didn't want to fuck Cas in a bar bathroom. Well, ok, he
Dean ran a hand down Cas’s spine and made an appreciative noise when he rocked back impatiently, so maybe he was watching him after all.  He was gentle when he entered him. Cas felt full, all the way down to the very core of his being. Dean paused, luxuriating in the feeling of connection while giving Cas a moment to adjust. When he moved, he set just the right pace, and hit that angle that made Cas moan and let go of his worries. He had been overthinking things. They’d been together for years now, Dean didn’t need to carefully study his reactions anymore to know how to please him. It wasn’t long before he was clawing at the sheets mewling.
“Oh, shut up,
“Don’t you boys keep Bobby up too late. He needs his rest. You know how he is, working all hours and not taking care of himself,” Ellen said as she got up from the kitchen table and kissed the top of Bobby’s head.
“Kalinda?”
“I’m not withholding your pants, Dean. You could have put on pants at any time.”
So, Bobby couldn’t call to check up on them like he obviously wanted to. Dean called him from a payphone occasionally, if he managed to find one, but the constant moving was an excuse to not call because it was hard to locate a working payphone in a new town.
“Um, bedroom?” Dean reminded him, ducking his head down.
“Well, I never knew my mother, and it was my father who started the Church, so there was never really a question of whether or not to raise us in it.”
Cas broke the kiss and looked down at him curiously, cautiously. The morning sunshine had limned his head with a golden glow and the sight made Dean’s breath catch in his throat.
“I suppose so.”
Cas smiled in the darkness. Dean liked it. Maybe this did qualify as a good idea for a date. He pulled Dean closer by his hand and gave him a quick peck on the lips.
Cas looked both anxious and expectant. He sat down on the edge of the seat, legs still outside the car, before Dean pushed him back, further inside and then down until his head hit the leather. He climbed in after, insinuating himself between Cas’s legs, one hand on his chest, stroking over his heart. He was still for a moment, just looking down at him, as if deciding where to start. Then he just dove for his mouth and kissed him hard, hands going to the buttons of that damn dress shirt he always wore, frantically undoing them, the last few ripping off in his haste, the buttons pinging into the corners of the car. Dean pulled back to watch his face before he moved onto Cas’s pants and undid them with equal speed. Cas shifted his hips up slightly so Dean could pull both pants and underwear down to his thighs. Dean took him in his hand and then he just froze for a moment, stared at the wonder of his hand on Cas’s cock. His hand. Cas’s cock.
Dean knelt at his husband’s feet and ran his hands up his thighs before going for his fly again. He shoved his boxers down slightly and drew out Cas’s hard cock. Holding the base, he licked him lovingly. Who’s to say that a quick and dirty blowjob in a bar bathroom can’t also be an act of love? A quick act of love admittedly. If they were back home, he’d take his time, but, right now, he just wanted to make Cas come as fast as he could. Still, he gave the head a few slow, teasing licks before taking it in his mouth and beginning to work in earnest. If there was one job that Dean truly applied himself to, it was a blowjob. He loved having his mouth on Cas. Doing this made Dean so fucking hard. He was torn between the urge to touch himself and the need to focus entirely on Cas, on his body, on his pleasure. Concentrating on Cas won out, as it usually did. So, he put his free hand on Cas’s hip instead of palming his own dick. He began working his fist together with his mouth, licking and sucking for all he was worth. Cas’s gasps filled the stall and spurred him on. He sucked hard in a way he knew was on the edge of too much but that Cas loved. Removing his hand, he swallowed Cas as far as he could until the head of his cock was butting up against the back of his throat. Cas’s hands were in his hair again, grabbing and pulling. The noises he was making were becoming more desperate, Dean’s name interspersed with incoherent moans. Cas’s hips surged forward. Come poured into Dean’s mouth and he swallowed it down.
“Not that I’m objecting, but I didn’t know you were an exhibitionist, Cas,” Dean teased when they came up for air.
“What? I’m secure in myself!” he said defensively. “I'm comfortable going to a gay bar. Hell, I'm practically a friend of Dorothy... Well, I met her that one time when she was dating Charlie anyway.”
“Shiny! Kaylee from the ‘Shindig’ episode?”
a favour.
“Yes!” he snarled.
“I’m really sorry. Can we just start over? I’ll try to do better and be less of a suspicious asshole. I don’t want us to be at odds. You seem like a nice guy, and hey, you’re dynamite in the sack!” Dean finished jokingly, trying to break the tension.
“Just try to relax,” Sam said unhelpfully from the aisle seat next to him.
He didn’t know how to answer, Cas’s words or his feelings. He got up and said, “I’m going to go to bed. Will you come?”
“I’m not a single lady, Cas,” Dean told him firmly.
Dean was sitting on the end of the bed with his head in his hands when Castiel returned. He rushed over to his husband, panicked. Was he hurt? Had the spell had unforeseen side effects?
Dean turned Travelling Riverside Blues down a few notches before saying, “I’m taking you to see the Wildcats.”
“Dean, when will you realise, there is no ‘better’? Being with you is perfect. I love you and I want you as much as you want me.” He pressed his growing hardness against Dean in case his body was more persuasive than his words. "You worry too much, my love,” Cas told him gently, carding his fingers through his hair.
“Against me,” Bobby piped up. “I could seduce husbands if I wanted to. I’m excellent at my job.”
“Jesus Christ!”
That normally only lasted a few minutes before his usual cocky persona kicked in. Admittedly, his brash confidence was ninety percent manufactured, regardless of whether he was talking to a man or a woman, but he felt better when the self-assured front was in place. He might still feel like a bumbling idiot on the inside, but it was so much better if he, at least, wasn't a bumbling idiot on the outside.
Maybe they had just been stationed somewhere out of the way. Kept busy so they wouldn’t bother Chuck.
The installation was about ten meters long and wide enough for them to walk through side by side with a high ceiling that arched over them. It looked like a strange crystalline ice cave, made of triangles of colourful acrylic glass and mirrors. The uniform shards looked almost like they glowed with iridescence. Luminous purple dominated the structure, but there was also blue with hints of green and pink turning to orange like a vibrant sunset.
He rubbed his arm and glared at her. Though, given he hadn’t even realised she’d sat down on the couch right next to him, perhaps the blow had been necessary to get his attention.
The new cool Ken had ended up wearing an outfit that would have been entirely at home in a gay rave, right down to the sex toy accessories. Wearing cock rings, either as necklaces or attached to clothes, had been a big trend in the gay scene at the time. Clueless toy designers just thought that the cock rings were innocent circular charms.
“Hey,” Gabriel piped up, “if we’re going to make it a regular thing, Cas and I should get turns to pick too.”
“Never heard of him.”
magazine had been a problem. John hadn’t even gotten mad straight away. He’d held the magazine distastefully between his thumb and forefinger, arm extended as far away from his body as possible, like he thought the magazine might detonate at any moment, which was sort of the truth. That magazine had blown the three remaining members of the Winchester family apart.
Cas was pretty sure he knew what was coming. He wasn't the most trusting person, but he did tend to believe that the people who came to them to cover up hateful tattoos did so because they were truly reformed. Meg was always suspicious of them, though. She had a tendency to test them, particularly if it had been Cas who'd done the consultation. And he wasn't going to tell her not to because she had a point. An upbeat punk song started playing over the speakers. Cain didn’t pay it much attention until it got to the chorus.
“I got it back when I was still working at the Gas-N-Sip. My mental health wasn’t great for a while after I left home... well, it wasn’t great before I left home, what with everything that happened with Bal and my father.” Dean tightened his arms around Cas protectively, as if he could go back and retroactively shield Cas from all the pain in his past. Cas snuggled closer to his side before he continued, “I couldn’t afford therapy, but I’d managed to see a doctor at a free clinic and been put on medication. I was struggling to afford that too. How anyone’s supposed to actually live on minimum wage, I don’t know.”
Cas passed Sam a present wrapped in Rudolph paper he’d purloined from Dean. It turned out to be a book by an author that Dean had never heard of, on a subject he didn’t understand. The book seemed to make Sam’s little nerd heart happy though, which pleased Cas, which in turn pleased Dean, so they all sat around grinning stupidly for a bit before Cas cleared his throat.
Dean was happy, after spending so much of his life as a nomad, to have the stability of not just a real home, but of a partner who shared it with him. Even more than the bunker, Cas was home to Dean. He knew that Cas was happy too. He'd smiled more in the past month than in all the years Dean had known him. Cas had become so much more than that cold, marble statue of an angel he’d been when they first met. Dean felt privileged that a relationship with him was how Cas wanted to exercise the free will that he’d fought so hard for. Cas was still pretty new to the whole human emotion thing. So, it meant a lot to Dean that caring for him, maybe even loving him, was what Cas was doing with his new found ability to feel things deeper than the average angel. Perhaps Dean was getting ahead of himself, they hadn't even been together a whole month yet. It was just, he'd already been feeling so much for Cas before they got together and he couldn't help hoping that Cas felt the same. As scared as he was to even think the word ‘love’, he wanted it so badly.
After another couple of songs, Dean put on some Metallica to cleanse Baby of the taint of Taylor Swift. He felt much better once he was singing along to Whisky in the Jar and they drove the rest of the way to Duke’s with acceptable music playing.
Dean leant down to kiss Cas because that, at least, he had figured out. He continued until Cas was shifting restlessly beneath him, then he wrapped his hand around Cas’s cock. Dean felt the same slight sense of unreality when he touched Cas as he had the first time, like this just too good to be true. He stopped kissing Cas for a minute so he could look down at his hand stroking him.
“Pretty sure that's not how the saying goes, dude."
Dean smiled at the implication that they’d be watching another three seasons together.
“It’s seasonal. I’m going for an ambience here.”
“Spike definitely is,” Dean said laughing. “Do you know, he was only supposed to be in a few episodes before getting killed off? But the character ended up being so popular that they had to keep him. Gotta love a fan favourite.” He shifted to sit back up and yawned. “I think I need more caffeine. You want another coffee?”
“On your knees,” Dean commanded.
“No, this is fine,” Dean told Cas, resting his head on his shoulder as he thrust against his hip.
“You guys are such an old married couple!”
“We’ve got pie.”
Dean liked the sound of that, not just the being fucked hard part, the home part, like he was going home to
“So, are you in costume?” Cas asked, looking him up and down and taking a sip of his beer.
“Cute guy like you, Cas, you'd clean up. Not that I know what gay guys are into,” Dean added quickly. “But I'm pretty sure you'd be up anyone's alley... Or they'd be up yours if you'd prefer to bottom!" Dean smirks at Cas. “Yeah, they'd be into you.” He elbows Sam. “Into him, get it?!”
“You, uh, really gave the liquid dimension in that drop of drool.” Dean pouted. “You're very talented, but it’s not exactly flattering.”
“That does sound like something Meg would think was funny,” he said with a long-suffering sigh. “This ‘costume’”—Cas did actual air quotes around the word. Dean didn’t think he’d ever seen someone so hot be so dorky, it was kind of endearing—“was a lot cooler when I thought it was inspired by Bowie and not Puddles the bloody Clown.”
Dean read the caption underneath. “They call them water bears and moss piglets? Okay, that’s adorable.”
“This is not honey.” He squinted angrily at the bee bottle which, above the large lettering that said ‘honey’, declared itself to be ‘bee free’.
Dean didn’t need to hear about anything his brother got up to in the bedroom, but he couldn’t help laughing at Sam’s face. He looked as affronted as Gabriel was pretending to be.
Also, I’m pretty sure they can’t travel the length and breadth of space using the mycelial network,” Cas said wryly.
Dean could tell he was on the cusp of losing it now. He smiled down at Cas affectionately, taking in his heightened colour and his quickened breathing. He was so grateful that Cas could weather the storms of his temper and still give himself so freely to Dean, even after all he’d said and done. Cas nudged his calf impatiently with a foot.
They broke apart to go to the bed and tumbled down on it. Dean crawled over Cas’s body and made a move to take off his t-shirt and then froze with the hem raised only a few scant inches.
“We have a tally at the shop for how many times people quote ‘draw me like one of your French girls’ at us, or ‘draw
“Sam, I need you to come. As soon as you can. I’ll hunt the witch. You need to look after Dean. I can’t-” He didn’t know how to finish that sentence, so he just hung up. Sam would come. He just hoped he would hurry. Cas had to get out of here soon or he was going to smite his own damn husband.
The room wasn't really big enough to flatter the dark shade, but it did suit Meg. Cas thought the darkness would look cosy rather than oppressive by the time they were done. And if not, he was sure Meg would rope him into painting it another colour.
They spent the meal talking and laughing. Cas dug into his food with more gusto once he’d slathered it in hot sauce. Dean wolfed down the meat with hardly any hesitation. And Sam finished his turducken under Dean’s watchful eye (and maybe a couple of subtle kicks under the table when it looked like he might be going to leave food on his plate). Once they were finished, Cas got up and bustled around the kitchen. He fetched more beers and plates before getting something out of the warming drawer beneath the oven.
“Can you...I want to...” Cas didn't seem to be able to express himself verbally at the moment. But that was fine, his hands were eloquent enough. They were gently tugging Dean’s shirt down over his shoulders, then raising his t-shirt over his head and ushering him to the bed. At Cas’s urging, Dean lay and Cas followed him down. He knelt above Dean’s prone form, hands stroking across his chest and stomach, eyes following their path. His touch was reverent and his gaze adoring. Dean’s pants weren’t even off and this felt like the most intense sexual encounter of his life. The way Cas was looking at him made it kind of hard to breathe.
“Yes, Meg, I got ‘some’,” he said, shaking his head. “Where's Abby?" he asked, trying to change the topic. As open as Meg was about sex, Cas had never developed the same comfort in discussing his sex life with her.
“That’s fine, dude, more dicks up my ass, I guess.”
Cain started laughing again.
“You know that's just a character, right? He’s not a real person,” Sam said.
“I- I’m sorry-” Cas shifted, as if to roll away but Dean stilled him with a squeeze of his shoulder.
The question represented such a fundamental misunderstanding of gay sex and such ridiculous levels of heteronormativity that Dean couldn’t believe people were still asking it in the twenty-first century. Not just because it was offensive, but because they could just google that shit. There were places to learn about queer sex online that weren’t just porn websites. You could learn stuff from porn too, but, as Charlie had pointed out earlier, it wasn’t necessarily a very realistic portrayal of sex.
When Dean pulled back, Sam was eyeing the kitchen door speakingly and motioning with his whole head that they should step outside.
Cas smiled at him. He wiped his hand on a tissue from the box beside the bed and reached for the condoms. Cas sat back on his knees for a moment and Dean’s gaze wandered down the length of his body and then settled on his hands as he rolled one of the condoms down over his erection. He covered Dean’s body with his own again and gave him a quick kiss before drawing back slightly and shifting between Dean’s thighs. Cas looked down at his face as he entered Dean, thrusting gently inside him.
“They are practical—I went with the 3-inch heels instead of the 5-inch,” Abby said. “These are my fighting boots.”
He appreciated Christmas all the more since he hadn’t made it back home for Thanksgiving that year. Dean had wanted to, but Sam hadn’t wanted to take any time off when he was so new to the firm and there was no way Dean was letting Sam spend Thanksgiving alone. So, Dean had stayed and had Thanksgiving in California. He’d cooked a whole turkey with all the trimmings even though it was just him, Sam and Charlie. It had been great and there’d been turkey sandwiches for days after. The turkey had run out before Dean had gotten sick of them.
Dean took the head of Cas’s cock in his mouth. He ran his tongue around it cautiously before sliding his lips a little further down the length. It felt a bit awkward at first. He had no idea dicks were so unwieldly. He wasn’t sure how he was supposed to fit this thing in his mouth without choking. Dean did his best to relax his racing heart and, perhaps just as importantly, relax his throat. Cas was still making those incredibly flattering noises and knowing that he was enjoying it made Dean feel more confident. After a while, he realised he was enjoying too, the weight and feel of Cas’s cock in his mouth, the soft skin under his tongue, the salty hint of precome that Dean had coaxed from him, the way the girth stretched his lips and, god, the noises, the beautiful helpless noises that Cas made under his ministrations. He wanted to spend the rest of his life finding all the different ways he could entice Cas to make those noises. At some point, Dean registered that he was moaning almost as loud as Cas was. A little to his surprise, he was loving this. How had Dean never known that doing this to someone you.... How had he never known that doing this was amazing?
happy, and that was what Cas wanted. He let himself be shepherded inside by Dean’s hand on his lower back.
Cas was in a good mood after a lunch spent laughing and joking with his friends. His afternoon appointments all went well and he hardly spent any time suspiciously staring out the large window at the front of the shop. Hardly any wasn’t the same as none though and Meg obviously noticed. She made it her mission to keep Cas distracted, staying close and chatting to him as they worked. At the end of the day, she dragged Cas to Home Depot.
“Sarcasm, ever heard of it?!”
that was kinda funny, but “Hey, I’m not the one that needs irony explained to me, buddy!”
“You’re not wearing a costume,” he insisted.
Cas stood and walked to the mirror on the other side of the room when she was done. Meg had drawn what he thought was supposed to be a teardrop under his right eye. The pencil she’d grabbed was red. Presumably, Meg had had it handy because she’d been planning on her makeup complimenting her horns before she’d decided to opt for classic black kohl for herself.
“And the weapons?” Dean forged on. “Or is this holy lube? I just squirt it in a demon’s eye and it burns ‘em?”
“Maybe...”
Cas kissed his laughter away. Dean let himself be pressed back into the wall. The solid line of Cas’s body was warm and hard against his own. The small, illicit thrill of kissing somewhere they shouldn’t be made both their breaths come faster. Even if they were just kissing, even if no one could see them, it felt somehow risque... which was ridiculous, but there you were.
What an idiot Cas was, thinking he’d gotten his husband back just because Dean hadn’t pushed him away when they’d woken up twined together. That wasn’t his husband, that was just good old fashioned horny Dean. Always ready and willing to have a quick roll in the hay if he had an enthusiastic partner, and Cas had been enthusiastic, not Dean’s fault he’d thought it meant something else. Well, somewhat Dean’s fault for not saying anything, because of course if you sleep with someone who’s told you they’re your husband, that person is going to think it means something. But Dean probably hadn’t considered that, given he hadn’t been thinking with his upstairs brain.
as a trope and other shows that are so quick to kill off their queer characters will bring them back.”
Not to mention some of the DIY stick and pokes he’d seen when people occasionally tried to cover their own tattoos.
Dean kissed Cas desperately and he returned the kiss with equal fervour. He drew back slightly and watched Cas as he thrust inside him. Cas held his gaze and eagerly canted his hips up to meet him. Dean broke the eye contact only to kiss Cas again. He kissed his mouth, his cheek, his neck, while he moved gently inside him, murmured his name and caressed his body with careful hands. They rocked together leisurely for a long time before Dean’s measured thrusts took on a more frenetic quality. Cas wasn’t the only one who tended to lose control when they fucked. He made a happy little noise at Dean’s change of pace and gripped him tighter. His blunt nails were digging into Dean’s back in a way that he knew from experience would leave a mark. The little points of pressure spurred him on. He grunted and fucked Cas harder. He shifted his hold from Cas’s hip to move his hand between them. Dean was close and he wanted Cas to come before he did, while he was still inside him. It only took a few strokes before Cas was clinging to him and shouting his name as he came. Then Cas wrapped his legs around him and held on while Dean chased his own orgasm. He thrust hard, burying himself deep in his lover’s body and spilling inside him.
(See the end of the chapter for
how come you want a tardigrade tattoo?”
Cas did as he asked, thrusting even harder, over and over at that perfect angle. Dean cried out and came untouched for the first time. He gasped and slumped back on the pillow. Cas watched as expressions of desperation, followed by bliss, then sleepy satisfaction played over Dean's face. Then, he buried his head in the crook of Dean’s neck and moaned as his own orgasm overtook him after a few more thrusts.
“I don’t know. Maybe if mummification makes a comeback as a viable funereal option, there’ll be a mummy in a museum wearing your art in a few centuries,” Dean joked.
“I would have watched

Cas grinned and unzipped his sweater, shrugging it off to reveal a Billy Idol t-shirt underneath. “Of course I like it. It’s a genre of music about rebellion. Plus, guys in eyeliner are kind of hot.”
“If you're jerking your cocks when you frot”—Dean picked up two of Cas’s pencils from the coffee table and held them next to each other while working a fist over them suggestively—“you’re kind of bundling your dicks together?” Dean raised his eyebrows.
“I miss you,” Dean said quietly.
Cas frowned down at the screen before sitting down on one of the wheeled chairs in the studio and typing out a reply.
“Huh, not your usual style,” Dean said, reaching out to run a hand over the soft wool of the sleeve.
After a while, Dean drew back slightly. As much as Sam had been supportive of his sexuality, he really didn’t need to see Dean grinding up against his boyfriend in their shared living space. And that was definitely where this was headed if he didn't slow down.
They went into the living room and Dean turned on the lamp in the corner, which gave the room a soft glow that was more relaxing than the harsh light of the kitchen. Dean put his own cocoa on the coffee table as they sat down on the couch. He turned to face Cas, looking at him intently and putting a hand on his knee. Cas held his mug in both hands and stared down at it rather than meet Dean’s concerned gaze.
Standing in front of the mirror in his living room, Dean shrugged a leather jacket over the jeans and t-shirt combo he was wearing. The outfit was perfect for tonight. He grinned and shot his reflection a wink.
“Ah, so you do watch
Sam was overreacting- the turducken hadn’t nearly killed Dean, only almost turned him into a mindless drone ripe for the slaughter. Anyway, it wasn’t Sam who’d almost been zombified, so he should shut up about it.
“Yeah, yeah, he told me about the witch and the amnesia or whatever. But, c’mon Sam, are you seriously telling me I married a dude and that dude’s an angel?! I mean, the former sure. Maybe I’m a little surprised; just percentage-wise, with relationships, wouldn’t have figured I’d settle down with a guy.” While Dean had fucked plenty of men, maybe even more than he’d fucked women, he’d never had a relationship with one that went past a couple of casual hook-ups. It wasn’t like he’d had a lot of actual relationships with women either. It was just that if he were to settle down- which had always seemed an impossibility in itself- he’d always assumed it would be with a woman. “But whatever. An angel, though? I call bullshit. I know I did not marry one of those dicks with wings willingly!”
“I find it hard to imagine you thinking you thinking were stupid either, Dean.”
Cas raised an eyebrow and stood there trying to wait her out until it became clear that Meg wasn’t going to drop her hand until she got what she wanted. He sighed and leant over to smack her palm before sitting down at the table.
Meg smirked, not remotely offended. Cas had been teasing her about being a demon almost as long as she’d been teasing him about his stupid angelic name and choir boy past.
“Yeah, like Madonna says,” he replied with a sigh.
“So,” Cas said with the emphasis of someone about to change the subject. “What should we do for dinner?”
Sam leaned over to Dean while Cas and Gabriel were distracted ordering and said quietly, “Sorry I didn’t tell you our boyfriends are brothers. I really did only find out about it the day you met Richard. I would have mentioned it, but pulling one over on you was the only thing that cheered him up while he was waiting for Cas to contact him. Richard was really worried that Cas would decide he didn’t want to see him after all.”
Dean kissed him with smiling lips and said, “You're such a dork!”
Cas agreed. He didn’t believe in violence, but at the same time, he wasn’t going to feel bad about it if a Nazi got punched. The answer seemed to satisfy Meg.
“What on earth have you got to be sorry for?” Dean snorted and shifted his weight so he wasn’t lying quite so heavily on Cas. “I think you could do whatever you want for the rest of eternity and you'd still never need to apologise to me!"
“Hunting cabin?”
“You sure?”
“Dean,” Cas panted.
“Pfft, I don’t run. And the added height gives me a more commanding presence, so foot soldiers know they should fear me. Right, Cas?”
“Funny, people normally complain about my smart mouth. You can call me anytime, you know, Cas? I could talk to you all night.”
Dean made a vulnerable little noise of pained pleasure at Cas’s use of the endearment. He’d called him that a few times since their reconciliation and every time the word had touched something inside Dean. It was an expression of the affection he was so hungry for. Dean wanted to be Cas’s so badly. He wanted Cas to want him, to want to keep him, and he was starting to hope that Cas might want that too. Dean let himself believe that as he leant in to slant his mouth over Cas’s and delve his tongue inside.
Dean looked down at his plate and screwed up his courage.
Cas showed him how to open the hidden compartment, which was set into a hollow in the wall behind the bed. There was holy oil and an angel blade in there, which was what finally made Dean shut his damn mouth, because this guy must be on the level if he was willing to show Dean things that could actually trap and harm him.
“You want eggs? I think I’m going to make eggs,” he said, striding toward the kitchen without waiting for an answer.
Dean had something else for Cas but he figured he’d give it to him later. He’d brought him a ridiculous pair of boxer shorts with mistletoe on them, because they’d made him smile when he saw them in the store. Sammy had probably been scarred enough by the original mistletoe incident though, so Dean thought he’d spare him the reminder.
“Right, right. I’m cool,” Charlie assured him and gulped in air. “Ooh, I wonder if she'd cosplay as the actual Amy Pond too? I bet we’d have so much fun at comic-con!”
“Against you or him?”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
Dean looked self-conscious, as if he felt awkward about being caught doing something so tender.
“I got them at a Spirit Halloween, ergo, they’re a costume.” She poked her tongue out at him. “What have you got?”
“It wasn’t like he did it all the time or anything. But I guess it was kinda like water torture, you know? Eroding our confidence one drop at a time. I started thinking I was stupid and Sam started thinking he was some kind of weakling. You’ve seen the photo of us on the fridge, right?” Cas nodded. “I mean, really, can you imagine that Gigantor thinking he's a weakling?”
“It is, but I like tattoo as a medium. Some art lasts for centuries, but that's the minority. No matter how talented you are, so much is luck and a myriad of other factors, most artists aren't ever going to be Van Gogh or da Vinci. Art can be ephemeral rather than eternal. What I do, it's not going to last for centuries—”
“She was the bisexual badass who investigated crimes to help build a case for the defence lawyers. At least, she was a badass for six seasons, and then they ended up replacing her with that douche Jason in the last season. Fucking travesty!”
“Strap-on fairy?” Dean suggested as he walked over to the kitchen counter to grab their beers.
Dean sighed and looked at Cas out of the corner of his eye. Cas was still leafing through the magazine with a studious expression on his face. At least he wasn’t traumatised, only curious, so Dean probably didn’t need to murder Sam for exposing Cas to this. Perhaps Cas was less innocent than he’d thought anyway. Dean was reminded of the time that Cas had actually brought him a copy of Busty Asian Beauties when he went on a supply run. He wondered what Cas had been thinking. Had he thought about Dean masturbating, had he wanted to be the cause of that, had he wanted to insert himself in some small, indirect way into the act of Dean jerking off because Dean would be touching himself to something Cas had given him? Or had he just brought everything he normally saw Dean buy, beer and porno mag and all. He hoped it was the former because the idea of Cas fantasising about Dean touching himself was really hot. Okay, he needed to get off this train of thought before things got awkward. Dean gave Sam one last glare, then he gently took the magazine from Cas’s hands and replaced it with a gift wrapped in gold paper and topped with shiny red ribbon.
molecular structures incorporated into his honeycomb tattoo. They’re the neurotransmitters typically affected by antidepressants.
“You’re the hottest thing in the bunker,” Cas returned with a look on his face like he couldn't decide if he should be proud or ashamed of that line. He doubled down though and winked at Dean. It was an honest to goodness flirty wink and it was fucking precious. Cas's lines weren’t getting any less cheesy, but they still warmed Dean’s heart and made his pulse race. And yeah, maybe he had called the hot sauce the hottest thing in the bunker just to see if Cas would tell him he was hotter than the sauce, just like he’d told him he was sweeter than the syrup. But, so what, didn’t he deserve someone who said nice things to him? Cas clearly thought he was worthy of compliments and affection, so Dean was trying to let himself be comfortable receiving those. He was slowly getting better at it.
someone, it would have to be someone I cared about, someone I trusted... someone like you...”
“Give yourself some credit. You could have any woman you wanted,” Dean said consolingly.
Once play began, Cas didn’t say anything or look away from the field for a long time. Dean found himself ignoring the action in favour of feasting his eyes on his husband. Cas was a riot of cheerful colour today. He’d left off his trench coat in favour of a dark pink hoodie, which he had declared was his ‘weekend wear’ when Dean had mentioned it earlier. He wondered if Cas had been watching Tan France on Queer Eye talking about the difference between casual and business attire again. The hoodie went nicely with his purple baseball cap and blue foam finger. Cas looking freaking adorable. Come Monday, Dean was sure he’d be back in his old trench, for now though, it was wonderful to see Cas looking this relaxed. They were off duty for the weekend and they got to be just 2 regular guys at a baseball game. Well, one guy, one multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent crammed inside a guy, whatever. They sat like that, Cas watching the game, Dean watching Cas, until a hotdog seller came through their section of the stands.
“Dammit Dean, why did Cas just call me practically in tears and tell me I had to come out there and take over Dean duty? What did you do?” Sam asked irritably.
“Why are you determined to be such an asshole?” Sam huffed a sigh down the line and Dean could imagine him on the other end, rubbing his forehead and wearing his long-suffering martyr expression.
“That, and ‘You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor tattoo any marks on you: I am the Lord.’”
“Says the man wearing a cock ring!”
“Soon,” he soothed. “We’ll get there.”
“I’m not hungry,” Dean said, and he did not sound like a teenager sulking over being grounded, dammit, he did not! “But thanks,” he managed to force out, trying to sound less petulant.
That’s stupid.
“You know that’s the name of one of her songs, right?” he asked, laughing.
The copy of
“What, ever?” Dean asked, from where he was lying beneath Cas on his couch.
I was trying to be cool.
“Was that okay?” Dean asked. He was pretty sure he knew the answer, but he still needed to check.
Cas kissed him as soon as he shut the door behind them, his mouth hot and hard on Dean’s hesitant lips. Cas drew back slightly and looked at him. Dean was pretty sure Cas noticed the nervous energy tightening every muscle in his body.
Late on Christmas Day, Dean stripped to his boxers and flopped out on the single bed in his childhood—or he supposed teenagehood—bedroom. It was exactly as he’d left it when he moved to San Francisco. The walls were plastered with posters of Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Metallica and other old-school rock bands. It looked more like it had belonged to a teenager from the eighties rather than one from the twenty-first century. Dean didn’t need his own room at Bobby’s anymore, but he thought that Bobby and Ellen knew how much it meant to him to have a home to come back to and he appreciated it.
“I’d offer to make you some nice soothing tea, but I don't have any because I'm not someone's grandma. I think I only have coffee or whisky. Coffee’s not exactly gonna help you get back to sleep and, well, given my dad was a drunk, I don’t really recommend drinking away your feelings, so maybe whiskey’s not the best idea right now. Oh, wait,” Dean said, going to another cupboard. “I have cocoa for baking. We can have hot chocolate.”
“Okay, so this was several years ago, I saw this YouTube video by Caitlin Doughty. Have you heard of her?” Dean shook his head, so Cas continued, “She has a channel called
“At least, she didn’t tease you about filing your nails between answering the phones this time, did she? So that’s progress.”
“I’m glad.”
“Actually, Billy Idol stole his look from Spike.”
Dean smiled back at his boyfriend and it took him a moment to remember that they were supposed to be going somewhere, not just sitting in the car staring at each other. He shook his head before turning back to face the road. He cranked the music up and grinned as he pulled away from the curb. Driving in Baby, Zepp on the stereo, the man he loved beside him, on their way to see Sam—things couldn't be more perfect.
The guy’s eyes were blue, he could see now, so blue they almost glowed. And there was a shining teardrop beneath the right one.
“Right?! People are fucking crazy. And you wanna know why this chick thought her husband was gay?”
Dean emerged from the bathroom in a cheerful cloud of steam.
“This beautiful belly.” Meg skirted her fingers over the exposed skin. “They wouldn't dare.”
“C’mon, Sammy, it’s New Year’s Eve- we gotta celebrate!
“Maybe, he can’t hurt me physically, but something like that, it leaves scars.” Cas paused uncertainly before saying, “I’ve been struggling lately. I thought I was better because I had therapy for a while, but it’s not that simple. That stuff, it still affects me. I’m better than I was, but I'm not 'fixed'. I'm still a work in progress.”
Cas didn’t actually know if teenagers still used the word ‘gay’ as a generic insult, but it seemed likely. They certainly had when he was at school and he was pretty sure teenagers would continue being assholes for the foreseeable future.
“You don’t like them?” Cas asked about the pair of thirty-foot canvases that dominated the space.
“Fuck, yes!” Dean groaned at a particularly well-placed thrust. “Right there, Cas, please, more.”
“C’mon, bitches, let’s dance! Clear a path, the queen is coming through.” She looked at Dean. “Or should I say queens?”
“Best Christmas ever!” Dean declared.
Dean sent him a picture of a plastic doll wearing an adorable miniature Muir cap, a leather harness under a black vest and leather pants that were undone to show a big, veiny, plastic penis.
And before he could even respond, he felt the darkness take him.
Castiel is carefully folding up the plastic drop-cloth, like it’s not just a giant wad of trash.
“It’s a gift,” Cas says.
Yoga Guy doesn’t blink, though. Just sticks out his hand and says “Your brother’s going to be fine.”
“And they became close, ” Castiel goes on, half-lidding at the goof. “She was an omega, as God intended all women to be–”

Break-ins aren’t really an issue on a dead end in the boonies, so before Dad gave up and just perma-loaned Dean the car, he’d lock the garage door at half-mast and toss on a military grade car cover.

“Welp,” Dean had said, holstering his gun and wiping his hands on his jeans. “We’re all clear. Let’s head back upstairs, salt the shit out of everything, and then we can pick up some groceries.”
Though looking back, he realised that he was a person who wasn’t happy with who he was. Someone who would rather sacrifice himself than let himself be in pain. It was simple to see as he reflected on the scene through the eyes of this version of himself and felt the hate he had for his own being. The hatred that caused him to ask why he… of all people… deserved redemption. Why he of all people, was chosen by God… or as “God commanded it.”

He gets there just in time to find Cas climbing out of the hot, ticking, slush-crusted Continental. Cas is looking about the same, and his expression doesn’t change when he finally spots Dean, standing frozen in the doorway. He shuts the car door behind him with a frankly adorable degree of care given how pissed he looks
Cas looks vaguely offended, straightens and folds his arms like he just remembered he’s giving a deposition. “No, of course not. Michael assigned sixty-six angels in eleven groups of six, each escorted to the field by a seraph. We struck simultaneously at six different areas in perdition. From there we dispersed to individual targets –– to cause as much chaos as possible in order to help obscure the object of our mission, and to increase the odds that one of us would actually find you.”

“Dude, either you blow off some steam here, or you start running with me,” Sam says, popping the passenger side door. “You need your walkies.”
Two days later, Dean’s back at Dad’s house, peeling up linoleum bathroom tiles so old they probably qualify for Social Security. It turns out to be a pretty gnarly job, because some midcentury psychopath cemented them to a layer of actual tile underneath, and that night his hip starts filling out the paperwork for legal emancipation from the rest of his body.
This seems like a
“Oh. I don’t want to get in the way.”
Dean remembered waking up from hell, feeling claustrophobic and scared as he realised he was trapped in a small wooden box. He remembered the soreness of his throat as he attempted to scream for help. He remembered the taste of dirt as it got in his mouth. He remembered suffocating as he attempted to climb his way through the thick brown soil and the feeling of relief as he breathed in fresh air.
Dean and Sam’s heads slowly swivel back towards the skeleton, like two little pizzas on the same Lazy Susan.
The guy squints at him, like a pissed-off Siamese.“On what planet?”
“Lookin’ fine. Just give yourself a couple days before you try to drive further than the mailbox, read the ingredient list on your Cocoa Puffs, or speedrun Castlevania.”
Then the light dies down; the wings fade into regular-grade shadows. Instead of a terrifying unearthly avatar of Oh Shit, Dean’s looking at a buck naked thirty-something math teacher. Who happens to be an unearthly avatar of Oh Shit. And has nice eyes.
Dean isn’t worried that Castiel has left. Not that he’s ever actually experienced the note-on-the-pillow thing or the don’t-call-me-I’ll-call-you – but Dean usually tries to beat people to it, to save everybody a half hour of awkwardness over freezer-burned Eggos. Dean would choke down a thousand awkward prehistoric Eggos with this weirdo, just to find out how he holds a fork.
The skeleton looks a little embarrassed, which is kind of impressive when you think about it. “You’ve…heard that one before?” he asks.

This is followed by some disturbingly tasty-looking red sheets of muscle that swiftly sheathe over all the whole scene, and then the muscles start sweating out fat and cartilage and this is the point where Dean decides that looking away is actually definitely one hundred percent for the best. Even then, the

halfway through a beer. He mentally cusses himself out for being a fucking alcoholic and pours the rest out to prove he isn’t.
Heaven’s patio is pretty nice; twenty square feet, some scattered picnic tables, fences covered in ivy and string lights. It still smells like fresh pine boards. There’s even a fire pit, which seems kinda bougie for the Roadhouse, but hell with it, it’s warm and pretty, and since when did pretentious people get to lay claim to “a hole with a fire in it”? There’s no moon overhead, and so the Milky Way is giving them the full monty — the runnelled spine of it, the ribcage packed with galaxies.
There’s clearly some kind of Preggo Meet-up in the offing, because she’s swiftly joined by three more people growing personal watermelons in-house. One is a guy, and Dean tells himself that he’s bailing to the weights area to give them extra room on the mats and to check his form in the mirrors. It is not at all because he finds pregant dudes deeply,
Yep. Super gay. ...queer?

Castiel frowns at the joint. “Hm. You weren’t supposed to know that. This strain’s a little disinhibiting.”
So before he can piece together exactly how his life led him to this point, Dean is crammed into the back seat of a car designed by and for the cartoon ladybug demographic, driven by a manic pixie dream nurse he’s known for forty minutes, rubbing elbows (and shoulders, and hips, and thighs, and knees) with a sweaty nutcase yoga teacher who’s wearing a dog towel like it’s a James Brown cape. Castiel konks out after two freeway exits, head thrown back but somehow keeping his mouth closed, so instead of snoring or drooling he looks like some kind of saint – you know, one of the hot ones who look like they were martyred by a blowjob and that all the monks probably whacked off to in Olden Times.

When Dean wakes up the next morning, the first thing he sees is Castiel’s face.
“Oh, my god.” Cas rolls his eyes and fakes like he’s about to get up until Dean grabs his wrist and pulls him back down.

“What’s a pity-fuck?” Bones asks, all mildewy innocence. Dean’s pretty sure the grunge in his eyeball sockets is dried eyeball.
Dean settles back into the couch, realizes that he’s in the exact position he was on that holy night when Dad was off on some big job in KC and Sammy was at the Special Mathlympics or something, so he and Rhonda got blitzed on Kahlua and whippets, traded underwear, and she sat on his face so he could eat her out through his own boxers.

Maybe just the way he veers into grouchy asshole territory whenever the world takes a dump on his shoes, which is kind of the definition of mornings. Whatever: Cas just seems like the kind of guy who’d need forty minutes of silence and three cups of coffee before he’d count as human.
Dean coughs up a bit of Wonder Bread. “I respect the hustle, but what’s it doing on an ankle cuff in a dungeon younger than Mickey Mouse?”
Bones grunts and rattles his leg chain. “Do you speak Spanish, Crowley? Because you look like the

Castiel sighs in exaggerated disgust. “Why am I always attracted to avoidant men,” he says, then takes another hit. It’s a short hit but it’s long enough that Dean
” Dean huffs, blind, his fingers clenching in the salty seaweed mess of Cas’s hair. Tongue and stubble lathe an invisible pathway up his midline.
“Okay, the rules say you’re not supposed to agree with me.”
“Well, shit,” Dean says.
That thin, acidic feelings starts to rise up in Dean’s chest again. “Do you…” A dry swallow reflex grabs his throat. “Hm. Fuck.”
“Wow, that’s like the QE2 of supps. You can actually take off the big ole mask.”

Dean frowns and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Jesus, no, I can drive myself,” he mutters.
Dean stopped pouting and started blushing instead. Cas smirked at him again and then went back over to get the coffee. He poured a cup for Dean and himself then grabbed another empty mug and put it on the table, presumably for Meg who they’d heard get home late last night. Cas dug into the fridge for a carton of eggs. His kitchen wasn’t as well-stocked as Dean’s, but he did have eggs and there was bread for toast.
“Oh, cool, thanks for telling me.”
“Sweetheart, you can call me whatever you like,” Dean said, grinning.
“Do we though?” Sam asked sceptically. “Since when do we celebrate New Year? And since when do you actually care about celebrating it?”
that she’d gotten from Etsy. It was strange and creepy and very Meg.
“Because you love me and you want to make all my boyhood dreams of a gorgeous guy proposing to me in a hot air balloon come true,” he joked, rubbing his hand over Jesse’s shaved head.
Okay, that was a little creepy but kind of sweet. And didn't that just sum up so much of Cas. He was endearingly weird. Dean smiled fondly at him and ran his hand up the soft skin of Cas’s side because, apparently, he got to do that now. He got to touch the nearly naked angel in his bed. He smiled wider and Cas smiled back, that little quirk of his lips and crinkling of his eyes that was his version of a full-on grin. Dean closed the gap between them to gently kiss those smiling lips.
Dean may not have grown up in a cult, but Cas was aware that he wasn’t the only one who had survived a cold, uncaring and sometimes cruel father. Dean had a tendency to downplay what he had been through himself, but Cas knew his childhood had been difficult. And Dean wasn’t the only one who wished he could protect those he cared about against all the hurts of their past. Cas wished that he could have been there for Dean when his father was busy crushing his self-esteem underfoot.
“Well you don’t remember me,” Cas said in a small voice. “I’ll call Sam, maybe he can convince you that you’re here for your own good.” He stormed off to the other side of the cabin, which wasn’t really far enough to get a good storm going. He yanked open a drawer in the kitchenette, which was apparently where he’d been keeping a cell, and then slammed the drawer shut for good measure. He mashed his finger to the power button and scowled while he waited for Face ID to unlock the phone. Dean thought it was a wonder that facial recognition could work at all while he was pulling that face, but perhaps he always frowned like that. Cas jabbed at the touchscreen a few times, then handed him the phone. Dean stared at the screen that promised it was calling Sam until the ringing fell silent. He was debating whether it had been Sam’s real number the angel had dialled when screen went black. Raising an expectant eyebrow, Dean held the phone out for Castiel to wake it up again.
"Nonsense, I'm an angel. You weigh nothing to me. Besides, this is exactly where you’re supposed to be,” Cas told him in a deep voice that sent shivers down his spine.
They ate in silence for a few minutes before falling into easy conversation. Cas polished off his pancakes and accepted a second cup of coffee, doctoring it with copious amounts of cream and sugar. He sipped it slowly as they talked.
Hopefully I'll be uploading more Christmassy goodness soon- the next chapter will probably go up on Christmas eve.

The babbling was back.
“My relationships with my brothers were nothing like you and Sam. It didn’t feel like we were family, we were just opponents competing for the prize of our father’s love. Luke was his most beloved son for a time, but he was never very good at following the rules. He had his own opinions, questioned our father’s choices, how he ran the Church. Funny thing is, I really think Luke was trying to help father. He wanted what was best for the Church. But father just saw it as dissent. So, he moved his attention to Michael. And Michael was always so eager to please him. It worked for a while. And he certainly looked good compared to Luke, who was too opinionated, and Gabriel, who just didn’t want anything to do with the Church, even before he left. But Michael could never do enough to keep father happy. He was so loyal, and he tried so hard and it still wasn’t enough to make father love him. Instead of turning against him as Luke did, Michael just tried harder and harder. But there was no pleasing father. Eventually, as I got older, he turned his attention to me and I was the chosen one until I disappointed him too.”
“’Tis the season, Cas. You should get out there, have some fun. Drink, bang and be merry!”
“Handy,” Cas said.
Cas paused in the doorway. “Are you coming, Dean?”
“So, do these come off too?” Dean asked, licking his thumb and rubbing it across an inked bicep.
Dean wasn’t sure how to make that happen though. He was fucking great at one-night stands, if he did say so himself, and he thought he was okay at dating—when that was what he'd actually started out doing. He was less good at working out how to transition from one to the other.
“Sorry,” Dean said, hand massaging at Cas’s neck. “I’m barely hanging onto control here. Too much?”
“Come on, Cas, tardigrades aren't real,” Dean scoffed.
Dean choked on his drink. Choked in a totally sexy way. Choking can be sexy, right? Well, maybe choking on a big, fat cock, choking on your beer less so.
It felt so good to have Cas touch him like this again. So good. Cas gave Dean a smoldering look and bent down to his ear. His hot breath panted against Dean's neck and he gave their cocks a squeeze as whispered in a sultry voice, “Together we form a mighty faggot.”
“Just shut up and stay out of the way, okay?” Dean said grumpily, not waiting for an answer before he stomped back to the kitchen to check on Cas.
“These aren’t nearly as good as yours,” he said.
?” Dean glanced down at the guy’s crotch meaningfully, as if to say ‘I could feel what you wanted with me, you perv’.
“Aw, you love me,” he teased.
“Shhh, I have you,” he assured Dean.
“So, what are you making?” Dean said, cutting off whatever tactless thing Sam might be going to say. He’d been happy to let dinner be a surprise- he didn’t mind what Cas made, turkey, ham, hell, he’d eat a damn nut roast if Cas served it to him- but asking about the meal seemed a good way stop Sam talking.
Wouldn’t say no to a repeat performance if you’re free sometime this week
“Why did you want a tattoo so bad?” Dean asked.
Dean steered him into a stall with a hand on his back. He locked the door behind them and shoved Cas up against the wall to kiss him hungrily. Cas, who apparently hadn’t figured out what they were there for yet, took a moment to respond. But he was happy to follow Dean’s lead in this too. He put his arms around Dean and pulled him closer.
“I can’t believe you remembered that, it was years ago,” Dean whispered, feeling touched.
“All holidays are made up,” she reasoned. “Don't be such a killjoy.”
“I'm charming professionally,” Dean said with a wink.
“Amnesia though?” Dean said doubtfully. “What are we living in a freaking Mills and Boon novel? Are you going to tell me that we’re in a love triangle with a billionaire next?!”
Dean didn’t think the scenario was particularly unbelievable. Not given the fact that the only other time he’d been to a gay bar he had picked a girl up. He definitely hadn’t been trying to prove something or anything. She’d just caught his eye was all. Charlie had taken him along to a gay bar one night and they’d ending up playing rock paper scissors to see who got to try their luck with the hot bi chick they’d met. He’d won but Charlie had still gone home with another equally gorgeous woman herself.
“Dreamy,” said a voice right in his ear.
“Oh please, I’m following in Bobby’s footsteps and you know it.”
“You don't have to say that every damn time we leave, Charlie!”
Despite his words, Dean didn't normally let one-night stands fuck him either. In a relationship, he was a pretty solid switch, but when it came to one-night stands, bottoming just made him feel more vulnerable than topping and he didn’t want to be vulnerable with a virtual stranger. But Cas? Somehow, he didn’t feel like a stranger and Dean wanted whatever Cas would give him. Dean wanted to be close to him. He wanted to be joined with him. He

Cas sighed. “It was a present from Meg.”
“Okay, not the for a fee bit. It’s strictly pro bono backdooring!”
Dean tugged Cas closer to kiss him. Cas let that continue for a few minutes before he pulled away. He worked his way down Dean’s body, licking and kissing. When he reached Dean’s waist, Cas stroked his hands down his thighs as he gently spread Dean’s legs apart. He knelt in the space he’d made between them. Dean watched him, breathing shallowly in anticipation. Cas coated his fingers in lube. His slick fingertips circled Dean’s entrance slowly. Dean whined and pushed his hips into the touch, but Cas wouldn’t let himself be rushed. He placed his other hand on Dean’s hip, holding him still.
He grabbed Cas’s hand and pulled him in the direction of the bar. Dean wasn’t normally much one for holding hands. He wasn’t sure if that was because he wasn’t into casual PDA, apart from the occasional kiss when he just couldn’t help himself, or when he was drunk, which amounted to the same thing really. Or perhaps, after years of hunting, it was natural circumspection that made him want to keep his hands free. Today though, he was feeling warm and relaxed and he wanted to be close to Cas. He wove his fingers through his husband’s and they walked hand in hand for two peaceful blocks.
Maybe he was not cut out for this. What if he couldn't do this? He wasn't good at this. At feelings, at communicating his desires. For too long his world turned around saving his father, his brother, the world. His mind oscilating between where is my gun and which way is the monster under the bed. His heart being constantly crushed, his mind in shambles, everyone he's ever touched kept dying on him.
And then it fully hit him.
"It's stupid," he got out dismissively.
It felt like his heart was chanting: Cas, Cas, Cas with every beat.
Sam nodded. "Dean," he sniffed. "He has green eyes like you, he looks like dad, but is more like his mum."
They've never talked about this. Sam knew but he never would have thought his brother would ever admit it, not to himself and especially not to the world. Dean glanced at him and it pricked Sam's heart, the knowing that Dean was a bit wary of his reaction. "He wouldn't stop nagging," Dean said jokingly into the mirror.
"So... where is he..." he asked matter of factly, but he could see it on Bobby's face: he understood.
Something is wrong with his human. Heaven or not, Dean hasn't gotten out of bed for the past twenty-five hours and it wasn't Cas keeping him there.
Dean glanced into the back mirror and Sam watched his eyes meet Castiel's in a tender and warm stare. Dean's eyes returned to the road, but Sam's fell on the ring on his finger. He looked between Dean and Cas with a corresponding one on his hand. "You didn't!" he exclaimed.
"So how have you all been? What is this heaven like?" inquired Sam trying to pass the time.
"Sammy," Mary got out first with Dean's help, placed a hand on Sam's cheek and smiled. "Welcome home." He hugged her first, then his father, who joined their foreheads and smiled. "Son," he got out emotionally.
But he felt the angel tense beneath his arms.
Cas sighed. "I'll give him time then," he turned to leave."Thank you, Robert."
"I am tired, Cas," he said gruffly. "Can we not do this?"
Suddenly they were all hugging, even Dean who protested the
"Hello," he smiled and melted. This was Dean when no one was around, his affection was shy but passionate at once. He was quite physical and sexual but any sign of intimate affection and suddenly it was an unknown and scary territory for Dean.
"Must have been amazing," Sam said wiping the tears that appeared from laughing as the car sped on the road to their destination. His heart was overflowing with happiness for this family he had here. They could rest now, all was well.
All life just left him. His mind was full and empty at the same time. It was like coming through a fog. The only clear thing was the realization that his brain finally registered standing in Cas's arms. The full truth of what being here with Cas truly meant.
Dean snorted. "You'll have to wait for Bobby, he has proclaimed himself the official 'Gatekeeper to the Heavenly Bliss'. Got brochures and everything."
He remarked on the quality of the shitty beer but his heart wasn't in it. His whole body was waiting for the next chance to speak.
"No, Sam, Dean is exaggerating as always," Cas said in his typical 'it's just Dean being silly' deep voice.
"Dean and I do not partake in any sexual activity if that's what you mean," Cas explained bluntly.
Bobby nodded: "Well, Cas helped-"
"Dean..." Cas started into the side of Dean's neck, taking a deep breath. "The last time we-"
Everything seemed perfect until Dean exclaimed he was tired. They were sitting on the porch silently watching the sunset, Cas was mindlessly playing with Deans fingers as they rested next to him on the steps. Cas felt his eyebrows rise. They were in heaven, they never had to sleep if they didn't want to. But Cas could see Dean getting further and further inside his own head as the time passed on. His fingers were becoming unrestful and even Cas's gentle touch could not soothe them. Dean wasn't looking at him, his eyes gradually becoming unrestful and shiny as well.
Cas got out of bed before noon and made some coffee and toast to maybe get him out by the smell of it. Nothing. He even brought it to the room but without a reaction. Dean woke up later in the afternoon, sleep heavy in his eyes, Cas was sitting in the armchair with a small frown. He has been watching him for hours, pondering about what was happening.
Dean's stare fell on him, he grimaced. "What time is it?" Weird, the normal Dean's reaction should be something along the lines of: "Cas, you are staring. Cut it out."
Everything was somehow brighter, the colors were radiant, the air was warm and smelled different, like he was not breathing properly until now, as if he's suddenly put on glasses or something.
Just as Castiel's eyes landed on him, the beer collided with the wooden floor of the porch spilling over his shoes, but he seemed to pay no attention to it.
They reunited, they kissed and they they kept on kissing because, all of a sudden, staying too far from Cas appeared to be an unfeasible concept. His heart felt like it could not take any more, the endorphines bombarding his system made him light in the head. But even that did not stop him from overthinking, it just meant it was less coherent. He wanted to be close to him, the pull he has been ignoring all these years was stronger than ever. He spent years believing angels could not feel such things, that it was just their "more profound bond" acting up everytime they have interacted. That Cas had this effect on everyone. Everyone must feel that electricity right? Because he was an angel, because that's how he was, awkward and intense and touchy-feely, everything that Dean was not. So, yes, he was a moron. That's what he was.
Dean was crying like he's never seen him crying. Like he would never stop. Sobs tugging at his body and forcefully escaping his lips.
But Dean just took off his shoes and the flannel shirt and lied on his side facing the wall, Cas wasn't sure what to do. He slowly approached the bed, took of his shoes as well and climbed up to him, carefully as if approaching a wounded animal.
Set before the Winchester brothers reunite in my last scene. Filling some necessary development before we can move to the domestic bliss and the exploration of feelings.
"So Jack did all that..."
"So you've got a son, you old sap," Dean remarked as he finally let go and slapped his back.
"It's selfish and greedy. How can I ask for anything more than this? I should be happy. You and my friends and heaven, right? You built it for me. Why am I not happy, Cas? What's wrong with me?!"
He placed a warm hand on Dean's shoulder. "Dean," he whispered. "What happened?"
Dean's heart skipped a beat.
Then Dean came to Heaven, effectively shocking Cas to his core. That was not supposed to happen. He made sure of it. He was not supposed to die now. As much as the hole inside his heart ached and he selfishly longed to have Dean by his side and as much Cas following his confession feared Dean's reaction upon their meeting in 40 someting years, Cas also loved Dean with his whole being (which was a lot let's be honest - the intensity of his love could overwhelm most people, never mind this broken lovely being he fell in love with). So he would rather die than wish him anything less than a happy long life, even if it had to be with someone else.
So he got scared.
It started out great actually, everything was perfect. He and Jack laid the finishing touches to the new Heaven. Everyone was starting to get settled and quite satisfied. Except for Mary who was still giving hell to John. But oh well, there was some controversy among the residents whether John was even supposed to be here in the first place, so Cas left them to it. Served him right to get some cold shoulder after his A+ parenting. Cas was getting settled too, keeping himself busy with repairs, and his bees and the house, trying to keep his mind occupied, all the while ignoring the nagging feeling in his chest, that hole inside it that he knew would not be filled anytime soon. But that was his fault anyway, right?
That's when Sam finally noticed that while the shotgun seat remained empty, the backseat was pretty crowded. In this order, Mary, Cas and John were sitting crammed there, none of them exactly rejoicing over the seating arrangement. Dad was looking the other way with mock grumpiness, mum was rolling her eyes with a fond smirk, Cas was the one awkwardly sitting there with hands in his lap looking out of the car.
He still did not feel deserving, he still struggled accepting the fact that Cas could really love his emotionally dense ass. And even as he softened the kiss and pulled Castiel toward the inside of the house, he still could not believe that he is allowed to have it. That he is allowed to have a second chance with this man or angel or whatever came out of the Empty. That he will be allowed to explore his feelings whatever they are. So what if he can't say it yet, so what if he doesn't feel deserving? He will guard this piece of happiness with everything he has, hold on tight and never let go again.
"Hey, Cas," he smiled and embraced him too. "I've always wondered where you ended up. You were my biggest regret until Jack finally fessed up. You good?"
He got up and turned back to Bobby. He raised the beer and nodded back to him. He'll catch up later.
"Yeah it is, well- I was stupid, because I thought, for just a moment," Dean fell silent his eyes rapidly blinking, "that the universe kinda owed me something, you know. How stupid is that, right? " he pushed out wetly. "I thought I got out finally, I got away from Chuck, my dad was gone, no apocalypse, no Lucifer, I could you know, get out. Find you," Cas's arms pulled him tighter. "Get you back. Live-" The last word barely a whisper. The next sentence escaped in a hearwrenching sob. "I didn't want to die."
"He keeps sleeping and not eating, something is wrong with him."
The sun was starting to set again. How long was it since he came here? Two days? Three? He pulled the blanket tightly around his shoulders but it was of no help. The chill was coming from inside him. He firmly shut his eyes and tried to imagine what warmth looked like: Sun flickering across closed eyelids. Cas. Warm hood of the Imapala. Cas. A cup of coffee. And Cas. His icy blues kept invading his thoughts, but instead of cold they made him hot all over, Castiel's soft but warm body a distant memory (or was it a memory?) Cas's hands burning a path along his jaw, whispering: "Dean, Dean." He shuddered.
But then Dean confessed his feelings, well in a way, in his own "Dean" way, but Cas did not care for the form. He was overjoyed. After believing for so long that his feelings were unrequited, after unsucessfully hiding them for almost a decade, it turned out Dean didn't consider him only a brother or a best friend. It was strange, trying to convince yourself that your instincts were not that far off, that the affection radiating from Dean's eyes was not a figment of your imagination after all, that those were genuine romantic feelings. It felt surreal even to Cas and surreal was his second nature.
"Charlie was the best man... well woman," Castiel added.
"Four," Cas said patiently. Dean nodded. He got up, Cas silently watched him go to the loo, come back and get into bed again.
Dean didn't wake up the next morning, he didn't wake up at noon either.
Cas was standing by the open door smiling at them softly, when Sam finally got out of the tooth-achingly sweet family reunion.
"Dean, what's wrong? You can tell me," Cas repeated.
THE END
He kept clinging to Dean even as they came up for air and Dean kept pressing soft kisses in his mouth. Cas felt drunk, his lips and lungs burning. They parted for a few seconds again and Cas cupped Dean's jaw before he could kiss him again and just held him in place. He wanted to just look at him, it felt like he had to make sure. That he could see the change, the newly acquired feelings on his face. They were both breathing pretty hard, Dean's lips wet and plump from kisses: a vision Cas had never seen before and had to hold himself not to devour him right this moment- so he just kept devouring him with his eyes until Dean's ears and neck turned a lovely shade of pink.
Castiel opened his mouth again, just as Dean finally closed the distance and crashed into him, hugging him tightly. "It's so good to see you, man." There were wood shavings in his hair and on his shirt, and he was warm and smelled of wood and of Cas and... it felt like home. Dean knew he was crushing him, but that didn't stop him from pulling him in even tighter. Castiel's hands tentatively circled his back and he began leaning into him. Head on his shoulder, chest slowly rising and falling. Dean knew the hug lasted long enough for a greeting, but he was not ready to let go. That would mean he would have to speak. He would have to address the angel's last confession.
Bobby passed him a beer. It was cold. Definitely not something he did expect.
And while they all understandingly granted them this private reunion, as soon as it was obvious the conversation turned to them, they began to promptly spill out of the car with a loud commentary. Sam half expected them to start pushing each other like little siblings do.
He looked well. Jeans and a dark t-shirt, hair a mess and his skin kissed by sunlight.
They parted and Cas just kept staring at him. He did not know what to do, he felt shy, no-one has ever looked at him like this. He has dated women before, he was even in one relationship that lasted longer than a month, but he wasn't used to this. He was starting to realize the full weight behind Castiel's stare and he couldn't even begin to comprehend the amount of love in those blue eyes.
* * *
And Cas let him, he let him cry for what seemed like forever, he was crying too, tears dripping down his chin and his neck pooling on Dean's shirt and hair. He understood now. Dean was grieving. He was grieving the life he could've had. The life he allowed himself to wish for for a fleeting moment. And Cas mourned too, he mourned for the man he was holding in his arms, who he pulled out of the Hell broken at a time he was lost himself. They pieced themselves together and somewhere in between they fell in love with each other. And in some way or the other, it was over now. Cas understood. Dean needed to grieve before he could move on.
It seemed unreal. Maybe because he had never truly felt he deserved to go to heaven, he had never really allowed himself to even hope for a happy ending, or for any resemblance of peace after everything was said and done. Dean was still processing everything that has happened, but it felt like his whole system was just... buffering...  Maybe because just a moment ago he felt terrified and betrayed even angry at the world and fate and everything. And now? He was seeing Bobby, his Bobby, happy and content, telling him that mom and dad live just over there. He almost expected Bobby to start shouting at him, something along the lines of: "Of all the stupid ways to die..." But maybe he knew it would be pointless anyway now.
Dean kept sleeping for the whole afternoon, then Dean just resigned and let Cas get a piece of toast into him. He slept the whole night. It really seemed like he was dead tired. Done, lifeless, dead.
Beer still in hand, he headed along the lake. The air was buzzing around him, in sync with his own head. Every day since the Empty took him away, he prayed to Cas, to Jack, to anything really, to help him make it right, to get
Sam laughed. "Really?"
"He's not getting up from bed," he started exasperated.
time. They all knew there was a lot left unsaid between them, even some bad blood, but what they knew was that there was finally time for them to maybe try and fix it, to be a family, with nothing hanging over their heads.
And now? There was no one there but Cas. There was no one there. The thought sent shivers down his spine. He hasn't been truly alone in forever. He has always been with Sam or dad, and when he was not with them he was searching for them, or trying to get them back, or resurrect them. There was the one time he was with Lisa, the short time he was allowed to try for a family, but even that did not work out, even that was a promise to his brother- a futile attempt to try and forget. But now... Now he was truly alone for this. He was alone in his head for this. He was scared actually, of being just this, just himself - no hunting, just him living his life, just being with Cas. They were alone here. No one to keep him in check, no threat over his head, no Sam to interrupt the moment. Sure there were his parents somewhere across the lake, and the friends he had lost along the way, and Bobby. But they were not here. They were alone.
"Hello," Dean said, the sentence so familiar, yet belonging to the lips of the other man. His footsteps heavy, he walked the short distance to the porch, attempting to set his own beer on the steps, but audibly failing as the bottle toppled and landed in the grass with a soft 'clink'. He was however already on the porch, eyes locked on the unmoving man before him.
Dean pulled the Impala by the bridge. The sun was about to set, coloring everything in its golden red, the river catching its light and reflecting it back. The car was silent in anticipation, it was almost time. He was almost here. Nobody uttered a word as Dean stepped out of the car, leaning on the railing. Jack said today was the day. When they would reunite once more.
"Just give him time," he said gently and patted his shoulder. "It's been a lot for him."
He died. He died like he always thought he would, he died hunting, he died where he began: with his brother, with Sammy, traumatising him for life, leaving him alone. He felt cold, freezing ice circulating inside his bloodstream. He started shaking and opened his eyes. Cas wasn't there. He was alone. How fitting... Was he even really here or was he just a wishful hallucination?
"Nothing," came a lie. "I am tired, Cas. Can we just sleep?"
It pierced through him and left him gasping on the floor of his mind.
back. Was this their twisted sense of a fix? Was it really Cas at the end of the road? His heart felt constricted and it made it a little bit too hard to breathe despite the lovely air. He had no earthly idea what he would say should he really see him. The days after he was gone, they all brought him things he should have said, was supposed to say, the normal reactions, but none of it felt possible, he couldn't even utter those words to himself. He shook his head. What mattered was that he was here and the angel was somewhere close.
