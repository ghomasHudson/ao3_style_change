Cas nods, stepping forwards to hug Gabe again. He’s always been closest to Gabe above everyone else. Gabe has always been there for him in his life through thick and thin and their relationship has always been stronger than those with their brothers. They tell each other stuff, trust each other and sure, they tease each other all the time but…Gabe is his best friend. He doesn’t know what he would have done without him.
He doesn’t wipe it on his shirt though, he does (what seems like, right now) the hottest thing ever and licks it off his fingers along with some that he got on them before.
The thought of food does make Dean hungry and he decides he has enough appetite for a second helping from the buffet.
When he pulls back, I move my arm from around his waist up to his bicep and rub it so he doesn’t get too cold. I brush some of the flakes of ice out of his hair before they can melt and then we start up again.
“Fair enough.” Dean shrugs. He sees that most people have cleared away from the buffet tables by now. “Wanna go get some food?”
did anything wrong. I obeyed her every rule even though I started to absolutely despise her as much as she did me. You don’t even want to know what she did when she found out I was gay. Jesus that was a bad night. That was when I was fourteen and had just started my freshman year in high school.”
Sam does the same and heads for the door while I head for the window, which is thankfully open. There are no traps in sight, so I decide to go ahead with the plan. Climb inside and then unlock the back door for Sam so he can get in too.
She rolls her eyes disapprovingly and leaves. Sam must have watched the whole thing and is now shaking his head. “That was kind of harsh, Dean.”
clicks and he just gets up and puts on a brave face.” Gabriel shrugs. “And since I’m giving him all of these compliments, I better go the other way and warn you about Cas and Mexican food. Stay far away, the gas is suffocating.”
Dean snorts. “Sure.” He straightens up and pulls Cas’ blanket down so he can swing his legs out of bed. “Do you wanna do this like we did it last night? I’ll try and lift you more gently this time.”
“Yeah.” Jimmy agrees, letting go of their hands to wander over to the bed, climbing up to sit next to his teddy. He looks up at them.
When we get into town, Sam goes to the local grocery store to pick up a couple of bottles of water while I stroll back over to the area around the crime scene. I know there will be nothing here, but that thought doesn’t really cross my mind because of thoughts of Cas. Since he didn’t answer our prayers last night, he is the top priority. We
and I’m happy to be sharing this with you. I’m not going anywhere. Ever.” I finish, finding that I am now fully inside the angel and my balls are pressing against his ass.
My lip trembles and Omandriel pulls back, examining my face. “Oh, don’t be like that, Castiel. Besides, there’s more where that came from.” He murmurs.
“Oh my god, I have to get a picture of this.” I laugh, knowing that someone is also giggling behind me too at the scene before us.
“I need to know specifically everything that happened before I perform a professional exam. Eddie, would you mind telling me exactly what happened? I know it’s hard, really hard. Can you try for me?” Cas fidgets and grips my hand harder and she notices. “Alright. Actually, Mr Winchester, would you mind just having a quick chat outside?”
“No, no. I’m all right. Just a bit uncomfortable.” Cas says in reassurance. When he looks at Dean, he notices that Dean’s knee is bouncing and the sales reports he’s looking through seem to be making him uneasy. “Are
My stomach flips again and tingle runs up and down my spine. If this is love, it’s terrifying, but I like it.
After doing this, I let go of his wrist and snake my arm around his front on his waist, and the angel immediately rests his whole weight on me, obviously exhausted from trying to stand so long when that stab wound was probably killing him.
“He told you about it, hmm? Well, honestly, thank you for looking out for him, Dean. Really. I knew something was wrong and I had to ask.” She smiles softly. “I need to make sure my son’s okay, I’m sure you understand.”
“Didn’t you say earlier that he thought I was going to kick him out if he embarrasses himself again?”
“Oh, Cas.” I say pitifully and let the angel pull me closer. I wrap my arms around his shaking frame and he tightens his grip on my shirt with one hand, and hugs me back with the other. Cas just cries into my shoulder with violent sobs, soaking my shirt with tears, but I don’t mind one bit. I don’t think this crying is just about what recently happened, I think this has been building up for weeks. Cas always feels like he can’t talk to anyone, which I am determined to change.
Cas props himself up on his arm and avoids eye contact with me, looking in the other direction. “Cas, I’m sorry, I took it too far.” I admit, suddenly hating myself. It was too soon. I notice that the sun is now hidden by a dark cloud. How fitting.
“Hey.” Dean whispers, getting his attention. Cas feels Dean’s thumb rubbing across his cheekbone slowly. “You don’t have to do this.”
Guyyyyssss I'm so sorry this took so long. I just started college and my laptop broke and ugh. But yeah, I won't bore you with any more excuses :s
Dean speaks slowly. “You don’t have to be scared, Cas.” He risks moving a hand to Castiel’s hair, stroking the back of his head. He feels Cas relax in his arms. “No one’s going to stop you tomorrow, and before you know it, you’ll be asleep. You’ll be in a peaceful, permanent sleep and nothing will be able to bother you anymore. You’ll be happy. And just because you want that doesn’t mean it has to be scary. You can leave this place and save hundreds or even thousands of people from Lucifer. That’s a massive thing you’re doing and sure, maybe it can feel a little scary when you feel yourself slipping away – trust me, I know the feeling – but when it happens, you feel so peaceful for those few moments. You see happy things. No matter how much pain there is, you see happy things. Okay?”
“Papa found these in a little beach store. We got them for you for being brave the last couple of days.” Cas explains and Jimmy bounces excitedly.
“-and I just don’t know what to do or how to make it up to him. I feel guilty enough as it is.” I finally finish. I’ve been telling her all of this for a good half an hour. Well, I suppose I did warn her.
“Really? Whoah, I had no idea. Honestly.” Gabe shrugs. “Is that what you’re preparing for with those?” Gabe gestures to the downturned box of condoms.
I’m assuming Sam got a brief glance at a very upset Cas because he’s now glaring at me with his bitch face. But this time? This time it’s not funny.
Cas isn’t hungry and Sam is sticking to a smoothie. I don’t care though, that’s their problem. I’m going to enjoy my breakfast.
Ever since he’d become sexually active with Dean, he’d come to realise he was extremely sensitive to foreign touch, as in, basically anything Dean did with his dick had him gasping in a matter of minutes. Dean loved it. He loved teasing Cas to the point he’d absolutely
Before he gets the chance to think about it, an underlying thought he’s tried to ignore his whole life surfaces, and somehow makes its way into a question that leaves his mouth. “Why have you always hated me?”
“I woke up at six for some reason so I got up. Decided to work on my dissertation because I’ve had an email from my lecturer. She said she stayed up ‘til two in the morning reading my work because she couldn’t put it down.”
I help him into them before we approach the door and leave the room, finding that everyone is indeed eating around the breakfast bar where Jody is cooking up pancakes.
He felt Dean’s presence next to him as another wave of nausea hit him. He side glanced the other man between silent retches and heard Dean say “it’s okay, I’m not squeamish.”
of soup, a few different bits of fruit, some snacks and some diaper bag supplies. Oh, and a couple magazines. She really went all out.”
“I don’t know, I just feel kinda guilty. I was convinced she was going to try and take Jimmy from us or something. She’s just as nice as she used to be and I feel like a dick for assuming that she’d try to do that.” Cas huffs while he places some pull ups for Jimmy into the shopping cart.
“Dunno…just…wondering how it happened, I guess.” Dean’s genuinely curious. He isn’t repulsed by it in the slightest.
I look between the brothers. They’re waiting for my answer. They don’t look like they want to do anything other than that.
I nod nonetheless and Sam takes out his phone, scrolling through some photos before turning it around for me to see. It is of me and Cas kissing on the ice when we fell over. Sweet.
He lets his eyes close and sinks into the couch cushions. Cas feels a dull ache in his ribs but if he falls asleep, he won’t need to take any painkillers just yet. Today has been extremely strange for him. He just can’t stop sleeping – his limbs feel like human jello and he feels like he doesn’t have enough puff to do anything more than walk to the bathroom and back.
Cas leans forward and presses his mouth to mine softly, our lips sliding together smoothly as I reach up and card my fingers through his soft, fluffy sex hair. I’ll never get tired of that.
Cas pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs. “I don’t know dad. I…she…I cut her out of my life ten years ago. You know that.”
“It’s gonna be alright. Omandriel and his guys are gone now. I’ve got you. You’re safe. Nothing like that is gonna happen
“You’re like some kind of cat, I swear. How the hell do you do that?” Dean carries on watching Cas – absolutely
“No problem.” Dean gives him a soft smile and turns to everyone. “Right, we’re gonna head off if that’s cool.” He tells the people at their table.
Jimmy doesn’t seem capable of stringing a sentence together at the minute, so Gabe holds his arms open for Jack to come and sit on his knee.
He looks down in to his lap in defeat and swallows. “Excuse me.” He mutters and slips out of the booth, heading for the fire exit door to go outside.
figure it out eventually. It’s the reason I decided to move away to Scranton – away from my memories of home - because I finally realized why he wanted nothing to do with me. Why he used to call me the runt of the family.”
, Dean can tell that much. He’s got nothing left apart from the angels’ orders to follow. He has other-Dean, of course, but this Cas is lost. He’s had enough.
Cas nods. Gabe stands up and pulls his phone out. “I’ll book the tickets, okay Cas? We’ll fly out in the morning.”
“She said we can stay as long as we need and she also says hi.” I repeat, which seems to satisfy Sam because he turns his attention back to the road.
He had known Dean for a year. They met at work, became good friends, and often did Night-Shift-A together. He’d been working with Dean that night, and his friend always called to make sure he was home safe.
in general. Y’know, he was the one who signed field trip letters and paid for school stuff. He’d celebrate my birthday while Naomi deliberately made sure she was working so she wouldn’t see me. Still, I never
He scans the room and appreciates the bustling, warm family vibe. Dean has never known what it’s like to be surrounded by family with it usually just being him, Sam and his mom – and maybe Bobby. The Christmas music playing and the people chatting and laughing and the overall feeling is just…something which is really special to him right now. It makes him feel whole and happy.
He makes his way through his own orgasm with a few grunts and pants, breathing heavily until the high starts to come down. He just settles with holding Cas close, running his thumb along his angel’s shoulders where is hand is positioned.
Dean starts walking towards one of the bodies, being cautious in case it’s alive or something. It’s a human body, but in Dean’s line of work, he knows full-well that it could be a
has, he’s nearly always able to recall some mental images. For that reason, not dreaming is weird. However, he forgets his dream-thinking when he hears movement at the other side of the room.
“Ok buddy, get away from me. I don’t have time for this.” He snaps, hiding the effect the conversation had on him.
Cas nods, accepting his answer. “I…it’s okay. She was gonna find out sometime. I know she likes to ask questions.” He huffs in amusement. “I’m surprised she hasn’t grilled you even more than that to be honest.”
I crawl on to the bed and place my hand on his back to make him at least stir. “Cas.” I whisper gently. “We need to get going.”
So, decision made, Dean heads for the bedroom. He works on getting Jimmy dressed first, including putting a pull up on him since Jimmy apparently doesn’t want to go without one. Understandably, of course. He clearly doesn’t want to worry about anything too much tonight.
Cas pressed more firmly to Dean’s mouth at the second endearment which sounded wonderful through his boyfriend’s accent. He moved his hand to the back of Dean’s head, carding his fingers through the shorter hairs there. He pulled Dean closer, humming as they exchanged such strong feelings.
Cas shrugs and looks down at Jimmy who’s a little more awake now. “What kind of food do you feel like? You can have anything you want.” Cas tilts his head in question, wanting Jimmy to pick so he will actually eat something. They’ve only just managed to get him off eating oatmeal and being as small as he is, Cas needs him to get back to eating full meals.
Cas slides the deck door open, stepping outside before too much cold air drifts into the house. It clicks shut and he turns around to go to the edge, hanging his legs over the side. The sea is in the distance, lapping at the shore with gushing waves. The weather is stirring the water. It’s not a warm day by any means; there’s a bitter tinge to the air that Cas knows is most commonly felt along the coast. The feel of it on his cheeks reminds him of when they used to come here when he was little.
“No, not really. A little a first, but not any more.” Dean replies. “I haven’t really bothered with it.”
Everything's going to be okay, and now I have relieved my stress, I can go back to helping other people.
“Ok, plan B.” I mutter, going back over to the door to get a blanket out of our bag then sling the strap of it over my head to carry it on my shoulder.
proud of you, you know.” He says as he hauls Jimmy up high. He squeals with a high pitched giggle. “You slept in your own bed! You’re so brave!” He blows a raspberry against Jimmy’s exposed tummy which just makes him giggle even more.
“That’s right, you don’t gotta be sorry.” He smiles, pleased that Cas is finally realizing that he can not be okay and not need to apologize for it. He lets go of Cas’ hand and wraps an arm around him to hold him close. “We’re gonna get out of here and go back to the house. And then you can get some sleep and rest all right?”
?” Dean smiles sympathetically, peppering Cas’ cheek with kisses. “You’re not considering what if he
Dean squints in front of him and sees a used, capless, crushed up plastic bottle sitting amongst the stones ahead of them. It’s just about in reasonable throwing distance.
Cas takes it with a slightly shaky hand and holds it to his ear. Since Cas is resting half on Dean’s chest, he can hear Rachel through the phone where Cas has it pressed to his ear.
. I can’t help but remember Cas sounding exactly the same on that night that got very heated not too long ago.
of the field. Internally. It must be held within a body.” Brunette tells them and all of the people in the room start yapping.
“Oh, that’s sweet Dean.” Rachel beams at them, holding onto her necklace with a moved look on her face. “It sounds like you both had a good day yesterday. With a nice proposal mixed in of course.” She adds. They just told people the engagement story.
“Yep. He wants to say thank you to everyone for taking care of him, so he said he wanted to make us breakfast.” Alex sounds thoughtful as she says it. They both get on quite well, and she sounds like she’s already grateful for what Cas is attempting to do – the waffles haven’t even been made yet. Although, it’s probably impossible to not find Cas funny when trying to cook something. I’ll have to try it myself sometime.
"Women like it." He shrugs. "But I guess everyone likes it don't they? After all, it's still hair which everyone has."
about feelings for once. Just seeing all of these sides of Cas is really opening Dean’s eyes about how he truly feels about the angel. It’s weird and it hasn’t been long, but he’s kind of accepted that he loves Cas. He just
He never really answered Dean’s question stroke proposal about pretending to be other-Dean, so Dean has decided not to pry – he’s still getting the sense that something’s bothering Cas. And it’s not something small; it seems like something that’s always there,
Naomi goes silent, taking his words in slower this time, allowing them to truly sink in. One would think she isn’t
“Hello Dean.” He said as normally as he could. It was hard though. He was getting colder and his coworker was clever; he’d be able to tell. Cas attempted to steel himself. He didn’t want his friend to know what was going on. He didn’t want to bother him.
“Stop walking.” Mystery voice says after another five minutes or so, give or take. Dean’s watch is gone just like his cell, so he doesn’t really have a clue what time it is by now.
It’s hard for Dean to see Cas like this because it feels like Cas is at rock bottom. He’s crying not just because of the pain. Because of
interested. Him and Cas are extremely familiar with one another, but there’s still a lot of stuff they don’t know about each other’s lives.
I strip down out of my pyjamas and get into some jeans and a t-shirt before quickly packing up everything I can, including clothes (that have once again found their way on to the floor) and the medical kit from the bathroom.
“Well, no not really. We need those anyway. I’m still a bottom at the minute, after all.” Cas laughs quietly.
. “The thoughts won’t go away. They just won’t, and…well, I just want them to be gone. I want to rest, even if it’s in the empty. As long as these people get saved by what I do…I’ll be okay. I’ll no longer feel worthless. There will be no more voice in my head telling me I’m not worth
“Okay.” Dean huffs a small laugh. “Maybe if I try and lift you to sit up without you tensing? Put all your weight on me and then get your legs out of bed then we can work on standing you up?”
“He can’t get in here with his clothes still on. I think I saw another stab wound on his leg so we need to clear that up too.”
Castiel secures Nicky’s blanket around the boy more securely when a chilly breeze drifts across the churchyard. He looks around for Dean who managed to get out of the church ahead of the crowd of people.
“Yeah.” Cas nods and begins to collect the sheets from around them into a tidy pile. “Dean?” He turns to his fiancé and looks him in the eyes.
“Was it the car ride?” Dean asks, keeping his voice quiet in case Cas has a headache on top of all this.
“Yeah, he was asking about ways he could make a good first impression. I said he should talk about pie.” Cas explains as he watches a smile break across Dean’s face.
Dean nods and smiles back. The whole time he’s known Rachel, she’s been lovely. She seems like a good person and from what he’s heard, she’s been a great mom to everyone, especially Cas. He just can’t get his head around
The angel blushes and it’s really cute. “Yes, I’d like to have sex with you Dean.” His voice is kind of quiet and it’s just too adorable.
Cas’ leg has been healing up pretty well. Yes, he can walk on steady, flat ground, but I’m guessing that stairs are still a problem. The wound has nearly closed up on the surface but heck, it’s still going to be a bitch for a very long time. The dagger was shoved through front to back, twisted several times and kicked out again. Of course it’s going to be painful.
Dean cuts him off and squeezes his hand, voice calm. “I know. I know. It’s okay Cas.” He leans in close. “Just rest on me, all right? It’s all okay, I know you would have said. I know. You’ve been doing so good.”
When I wake, I feel slightly disorientated, as if my body doesn’t know whether it’s up or down or anything.
Slowly so he doesn’t accidentally kneel on Cas, Dean lifts himself up and positions himself so he’s hovering over Cas, straddling his thighs under the covers which Dean somehow manages to keep in place. He originally changed position for better kiss positioning, but he feels something else starting to form in the atmosphere. Something along the lines of…
too. Knowing about the relationship is one thing. Knowing what happens in the relationship is another.
We sit in comfortable silence for a while but the question of my mental state still lingers in the air.
“I don’t mind helping Cas.” Gabe shrugs. “I’ve helped him before so there’s nothing I haven’t seen.”
He took hold of Dean’s shoulders and yanked him down so he could kiss him. Dean pressed down, meeting him with a messy, open-mouthed meeting of lips. “Mmmph.” Cas made a noise when Dean pulled away just a few centimetres.
“I used to do this all the time when I was younger. I won medals.” She laughs, looking quite happy considering that was something she did before her family got screwed up. Maybe she really has started to move on. If she is, hats off to her to be honest. That's some tough crap to recover from.
I hug him closer and put my hand on the side of his head, pulling it back into my chest. He seems so small like this, so vulnerable.
“Nice. What about you Eileen? Got anything interesting going on?” I smile, gripping Cas’ shoulder when he moves a little in his sleep.
But an overpowering thought hits him, and once it surfaces, it’s like it’s been sitting there at the back of his head all this time. All this time since he befriended Cas.
knives. Your trunk is absolutely packed. Heck forbid the cops find your stash somehow, you’d be so in for it...then I’d have to bust you both out.” Jody laughs.
“No, no I was fine.” Cas places a hand against Dean’s chest in reassurance. “And how could I forget to say
that he couldn’t hold it back. Dean’s comforting presence was too much for him to handle, and his control over how he was feeling slipped.
Jimmy glances between the two of them, biting his lip with a smile. When he looks at Dean, Cas catches him nodding his head encouragingly to Jimmy. Dean realises Cas is watching and his face turns neutral again.
Soon, we are in dry and comfortable clothes and are all fucked out, but our friends don’t need to know that. It’s our little secret.
“No, no, it’s okay. Rest for a while. As long as you need. We’re good here in shoulder, I don’t need to move the car.”
“I feel like you two have been conspiring while I was asleep.” Cas takes a small bite of the grilled tuna sandwich.
that he needs a doctor. Dean feels sorry for Cas, but he feels proud that Cas isn’t downplaying what he needs.
He places his hand over Cas’ forearm, squeezing gently in support. Cas shares a happy smile with him.
“Hey, I’ll just be right outside okay? Dr. Clarke just wants to help, she’s not going to hurt you. It’s only a few questions, there’s nothing to worry about.”
Cas dips his head to the side “okay yeah, it might have been a good idea to stay closer but still. Just don’t worry about it. It’s okay.” He reassures, placing a hand on Gabe’s shoulder. “Looking after kids is hard. Even if you rule out everything you think could go wrong, shit still goes wrong.” Cas jokes and Gabe smiles at that.
“You’ll know.” She smiles, standing up. “Why don’t you two go out into the forest tomorrow or something? It’s supposed to be really sunny.”
“Is it really you?” She attempts to sit up and doesn’t succeed, so she ends up working hard to shove a pillow behind her back to prop herself up.
close that it provides an indescribable feeling of calm, and warmth. They should sit like this more often.
Thankful that we got through that without any major awkwardness, I help Castiel out of the bathroom and get him back to bed. Also, as if on cue, Sam bursts through the door with like, three shopping bags.
My stomach growls and I look at the door, debating whether or not I should leave Cas in here to get more sleep. But no, he needs to eat and drink too. We need to keep him hydrated.
planning on wetting yourself in the car? What, were you gonna piss in the Impala because you fucking
You know what, if any other hunters found us ice skating like this, I wouldn’t even care. We’re having fun after months of hard work with god and Amara and mom and everything. We deserve this little day of stupid fun. It’s that, or Cas has made me go soft. I’m gonna tell myself it’s not the latter even though I know it fully well
His friend was still in front of him when he felt the need to be sick. It happened so fast and he had to shove Dean to the side with all the strength he had so he could run to the bathroom. He barely heard Dean’s ‘oof’ as he buried his head into the toilet bowl.
“You wanna go first orrr?” I ask, Still nervous, but less nervous than before because I’m sure that Cas will love it.
With his free hand, Dean reaches for the bowl sitting beside the coffee table. “Here.” He murmurs, passing Cas the bowl. Dean helps him hold it with his spare hand and the hand which is circled around Cas’ back. It feels good actually, having his arms all the way around Cas while he helps him out. Protectiveness starts to bubble up inside Dean again.
I frown, “Don’t worry Cas, you can’t help it, you’re sick.” I assure, but realise that he didn’t hear me because he’s already fast asleep in my embrace.
There is another long stretch of silence in which nobody even moves. Dean is about to speak when one of the angels beats him to it.
"It's not gonna take long to get clean, you should be ok." Dean smiles and this time I smile back, leaning forwards and enclosing him in a hug under the spray of the water.
“C’mere.” He holds his arm out and pulls Cas to rest against him like on the stairs. “How are you feeling?”
I get a bit closer and now I am able to see the angel’s frantic eyes. Whatever happened, it really shook ‘m up.
“Don’t give me ideas.” Cas pointed his finger at him, cursing the hypothetical images which flowed into his head.
“N-No!” I decide, holding the blankets more in place to hide what happened. If they find out that I wet the bed, they’ll never forgive me. Dean will be so disappointed in me. “Just a nightmare.”
“Cas?” I say loudly, finding I said it too soon. The guy is standing in between me and Sammy holding up one of my brother’s granola bars to eye level, the top of the bar unwrapped.
“Yeah.” Dean sighs deeply. “I don’t know how it happened, but you’re maxed out.” He studies Cas’ face and tries to figure out what he’s thinking. “You okay?”
He felt a lingering kiss get pressed to the top of his head. Afterwards, Dean’s fingers returned to his hair. “Why me, Cas? How can you find me so inspiring?” Dean questioned honestly, as if he had doubts why Cas wanted to be there with him in his life.
After they got home last night, everything was fine. Him, Cas and Jimmy slept all through the night with absolutely no one waking up. It’s been hard to come by a night like that recently. But this morning, Cas slept in. Dean left him for an extra hour to give him time to come to, but no, he stayed asleep. Dean and Jimmy were both up fairly early, but even after the clock hit twelve, Cas was still fast asleep.
Cas makes eye contact with a nurse on her way past, and she smiles at him, looking a little confused because he’s literally just standing there. Cas doesn’t want her to comment, but to his disappointment she stops and tries to make conversation.
“Cas, can I ask you a question?” I place my hand on his back and pull the covers up a little further to keep us warm on this cool-ish night.
Cas sighs. “He told me that Luke called him a retard. He didn’t understand what it meant and wanted me to explain it to him, which I did.”
Gabe nods with a sigh, trying to think of how he can explain what happened to Cas after he told him so confidently everything would go smoothly.
They leave the house and start walking down the path together. It’s pretty dark out even though it’s early evening. The temperature is dropping fast too.
“I’m listening.” He muses while I take hold of his hand, pressing light kisses to each of his fingertips.
“Two birds with one stone, hell yeah!” Charlie laughs too and me and Cas finally start working together.
Cas lets out one last loud, filthy moan and comes hard down my throat. His dick twitches and jerks in my mouth and I love it. I swallow it all down, waiting until he stops pulsing before pulling off him. I place a couple of gentle kisses to his softening cock then when I look up at him, I see that his eyes are closed and his lips are parted as he rides the bliss of post orgasmic awesomeness.
“You don’t know? Uh, well…he said to her that he wants to spend the rest of his life with you. I’m pretty sure that means you’re doing something right.” Gabe snorts. “Wish I was that lucky.”
“Dean, where are we going?” Cas asks me from the passenger seat, looking at me confusedly. I haven’t told him anything yet. I woke him up back at the bunker and persuaded him to come with me.
He turns around quickly, staring daggers at each and every one of the poncey-ass tree toppers. “What did you do to him?” He snaps.
I lean against the counter when a new conversation starts, “Jody, have you seen my white chucks, I can’t find them.” Alex asks.
Dean sees that Jimmy’s eyes are flooded with tears and some are already streaming down his face. He shares a look with Cas who holds on to Jimmy tighter, whispering comforting things.
I stroll across the room and pick up my suit jacket from the chair so I can pack that too. Sam’s is here too from earlier. I completely forgot it was there but I suppose I can just dump that by the door along with our other things.
“I guess so. I did it because I was planning on telling you everything and I might have needed to refer back to the session in case I missed something.” He completely relaxed against Dean. “I’ll play it to you because I was calmer at the therapy session and I got the whole story out. I think just listening will be easier for the both of us right now.”
job here? Forgive me for being blunt but…I don’t deserve this.” He decides, knowing that David is being incredibly patient and generous about all of this. He doesn’t understand.
say he wouldn’t keep his eyes off Jimmy, but Cas doesn’t blame him if something went wrong. Sometimes shit just happens. It’s happened to everyone.
“I’m astonished it lasted this long without you and Jimmy giving in and eating it.” Cas claims with an amused yet disbelieving tone.
Dean shakes his head dismissively. “Just nervous about this sale. It’s the biggest one I’ve ever pitched by far. Even David is relying on me and Michael to close it.” He shoots a small smile at Cas.
A powerful cry of pain leaves Cas then he is silent for a long moment. Dean watches him in those few long seconds until Cas starts to push himself up, a sea of mud sticking to his clothes from the ground.
My fingers lace through his thick, raven black hair and I pull it a bit which forces a small moan out of the man in front of me. Looks like I’m not the only one that’s craving this now.
“Okay.” The nurse helps Cas wash his mouth out then offers him a mint to suck on. “Someone will come back to check on you in a while, okay?”
More fics will be posted in this series at some point (weddings/real dads etc...) lol - but for now? I've gotta get my GISH on :)
He gets a nod from Jimmy who spots Jack across the room, squirming to be put down so he can play with his friend.
“The first time I experienced it, I had no idea what was happening. I thought it was my stomach. I knew I was desperate for something, but I didn’t know what. I stuck it out for a little while, hoping the pain would go away. That was until I found that my pants were wet, and the pain had gone. People gave me some strange looks but never said anything. I had no idea what to do. Some of the people who gave me strange looks gave me a little money so I could wash my clothes. After that, I was very careful. You might call it paranoid, I don’t know. It happened a few times. Sometimes I was awake, sometimes sleeping. When I got a job at the gas-n-sip with Nora, I slept in the store room the whole time I worked there. That’s when you came to see me and we worked that case, but not long a after you left – a few days maybe – I had another accident, and Nora knew. She
Gabe pulls the door open. He knows Cas too well, clearly. “I know that voice, you S.O.B.” Gabe laughs and pulls Cas into a hug.
At this moment, the light in the bathroom shuts off and Cas steps out, making his way over to the bed.
“Alright. Okay.” He gently moves the bucket away from Cas after giving him water to wash his mouth out.
“Ah, my voice of reason. Nice to see it has returned.” Cas jokes lightly, amusement tickling his voice as Dean grabs a blanket.
Sam throws one back at him and it is so forceful, it actually knocks Cas over on the slippery ground, but he’s still laughing his ass off on the floor.
Dean rolled his eyes fondly before focusing his attention back on Cas’ lower half. The skin of his inner thighs quivered when Dean’s hands moved across it and before long his boyfriend was fumbling to undo his belt, the distinctive clanking sound of the metal making Cas squeeze his eyes shut at the connotation of that sound;
“Love you too.” Dean reaches up and holds Cas’ face, the tips of his fingers sliding into the hair at the back of Cas’ head. “Bye.”
“Yes.” He admitted. “But Dean, trust me, anything she said may have hurt, but I didn’t take it seriously and…I think…I think maybe I should play you the recording.”
Jody moves over to a still crying Claire and hugs her tightly, stroking her hair and whispering comforting words.
“Nah, we’ve seen that like a thousand times.” Whines Alex. “What about Thor? We haven’t seen that for a while and there are hot guys in it.”
“So, Cas, what’s the deal?” I ask, glancing back at the body of a man lying down on the floor. There is a stab wound to abdomen but there are also faint burn marks across his chest in the shape of a skeleton.
“Come on, buddy. Here, sit up.” I encourage him best I can, but it ends up being me turning him over and grabbing hold of his shoulders and pulling him upright slowly. His eyes are still firmly closed and I wonder whether he’s actually sleeping while sitting up like this, and his limp body is in fact telling me
“It’s cool.” Cas nods from his position. He shifts under the blankets then goes still, before flatly coming out with. “We had sex.”
“We’ll see you at the diner in a bit? If you’re not there by eleven, we’ll be heading back to get the car anyway so you can tag on then.” Dean explains. “Jimmy’s okay by the way. He’s fine.”
“Okay.” Cas murmurs, standing up before lifting Jimmy into his arms. He moves Jimmy’s pillow against the headboard and sits down on the bed with his back resting against the pillow, holding Jimmy close. “Me and Dean are right here.” He says. “We’re not going anywhere, I promise.”
“I was joking. I just mean that they’re making friends really fast.” He smiles down to Jimmy. “Are you excited to see your cousins?”
“Awesome.” Dean chuckles, suddenly realizing how his questioning sounded. “No rush though, Cas. I wasn’t asking to, like, hint or anything. I was just curious.”
Dean bites his lip while he waits for Jimmy to reply. If worst comes to the worst, Dean can try and look after him tonight. It’s just not ideal given that Cas is going to be in pain and it’s not something they want Jimmy to be around for. Cas isn’t going to be screaming or anything, it’s just…Jimmy will get upset if he sees Cas unwell in bed.
he will burst out laughing. Him and Cas can be terrible in serious moments – one glance in each other’s eyes and they’re beside themselves giggling.
“Oh hey, you never told me where to go, I’m just kind of improvising here buddy.” Dean realises, turning onto the main road.
“Thanks, it’ll be ready in just a minute.” He smiled, handed the receipt to the man and turned to help Jo, skillfully making up the milk for the drink alongside her preparing the coffee grounds.
It was four o’clock in the morning. He didn’t care. The neighbours were listening through the thin walls? What a surprise! They probably did that every night. Cas
“Maybe it’s the sea breeze.” Dean looks out across the ocean. It’s quite a foggy day. There’s a white mist hanging over the sea on the distance and it feels like rain is coming at some point today. “Maybe we should have brought an umbrella.”
Cas is vaguely aware when the door of the bedroom opens. He can tell by the footsteps that it’s Dean. Even though he’s half asleep, he smiles when he hears Dean walk into the bedframe, cursing
I rub his back until he finishes, and Claire returns with the washcloth, handing it to me. I wipe it across Cas’ mouth after a couple of minutes, sure that he’s completely done. “Okay, looks like we’re back on the ginger ale, buddy.” I decide, folding the cloth in half before wiping the beads of sweat from his forehead.
Cas watches as his family walk out of the boat center, all talking and laughing. Dean told him about Gabe’s texts. His brother
“Better than being in agony though, yeah?” Dean scoots across the floor so he’s closer to Cas, handing him the glass of water. “Here.” He says before Cas feels Dean’s fingers return to his hair.
“You’re never gonna lie to me, are you.” Cas smiles down at the kitten. “You’re too cute to do anything wrong.” The kitten starts purring, nudging his head into Cas’ hand. Cas tilts his own head to the side, leaning down to be closer to the small animal. “Well, apart from when you peed on the floor when we first got home, but I’ll forgive you for that.” He laughs quietly.
hated talking about his personal life. “I’m sorry to have been so erratic with my work. The corporate job helped a lot but I…” Cas takes a moment to breathe. “I did get to a point where I really wasn’t able to work for a while. Dean had to call corporate and tell them to fill the position.”
A sob leaves his mouth and he does try to wipe some tears from his eyes with the sleeve of his hoodie, but they keep falling. He doesn’t know what he’s supposed to think or do. Naomi just watches him silently. She lets him come to terms with her truths.
His heart is hammering in his chest and he risks a glance downwards, seeing Dean’s strong hand frantically jerking their leaking cocks together. Cas bites his lip and scrunches his eyes and tries not to let out the loud moan trying to fight its way out of him. His stomach is tingly with pleasure and he feels his balls start tightening, the pressure within him building.
“Yeah. I’m glad it’s done but half of me wants to go back to writing more.” He admitted, shifting in the chair. He was more than comfortable there but the pending subject of Naomi was hanging over him. “Sorry, I’ve just got a lot on my mind at the minute.” He said to justify his fidgeting.
As I am falling asleep, my mind wanders to when Cas was human before; when I told him to leave the bunker and when he spent a long while between sleeping areas and locations. What did he do about his problems then?
At least he has these footprints to follow, so maybe whoever this was, they will be able to give him more answers than the disgruntled vampire.
“Yes.” He admits. “You weren’t eating enough before we came on this vacation. And now you’re eating even less than before. Barely anything.”
I pull back and look at Cas. His face is pale and his eyes are closed. He looks peaceful, but it doesn’t make things any easier. He looks
He thinks as he slowly untangles his arms from around Jimmy. Does Cas take five-minute showers all the time or something? Dean finds himself genuinely curious about that because he’s never actually asked Cas what he does. Huh.
“About ten minutes I reckon…” Gabriel goes silent for a moment. The connection isn’t great because Gabe must be using his hands free in his car. “Maybe longer; these roads are a fucking maze.”
I open the door to our room and Sam places Cas down on my bed gently (because I had time to make mine this morning and he didn’t).
“Whatever it is, it’s good enough for me buddy.” I breathe in his scent and feel the warmth of his body, finally calming down form that absolute shit fest. “Think you can stand Cas?”
We slowly make our way over to join Sammy, Claire, Jody and Alex who have all gathered around him to help him up. He claims he’s fine, and everyone’s attention is turned on to me and Cas when we approach our friends.
Being done with the conversation, Dean nods and turns around, scanning the rooms as he walks down the corridor to see they’re all labelled with G. Ground floor, right? And that means if he’s on the ground floor, he needs to get all the way up the stairs to floor D.
They use chess pieces to show friendly and enemy ranks moving forwards, and where the worst of the battle will occur. Dean watches intently, keeping his hand resting comfortably on Cas’ thigh.
Dean nods in understanding, slowly letting his fingers ghost over the bruising. Only two thoughts run through his head. The first being admiration in how well Cas is coping with this. The second is the fact that Dean still thinks he’s beautiful, despite all the bruises. It makes him feel more in love with Cas, knowing he will be always be by Cas’ side through difficult times like these.
The thought made Dean happy inside. He pressed closer to Cas and clung to the other man with everything he had.
“You have no idea how hard this is!” Cas screamed at his mother. The breaking feeling inside him forced the words out of him. It was as if his words were just…empty space. They were falling on deaf ears, even though his mother could hear perfectly fine.
Cas swallows audibly, looking away. “Sam is gone, Dean.” He says, his voice barely above a whisper. Dean still hears it, though.
Cas doesn’t seem to care apart from flinching a bit when Sam pushes the needle into his leg. It is soon done, and Sam lets his pants twang back into place. Advantages of an elasticated waistband I guess.
to hear it again. He rubs a little more firmly, slowly pulling away from the kiss so he can shift down a little more.
“No, no, he just…well, he was just confused. He asked me if you were going to die and I felt like I needed to talk to him about it there and then to sort it out. You- you don’t think I did the wrong thing, do you?”
“Cas!” Dean says his name loudly, kneeling down to gauge what state Cas is in. By the looks of it, not a good one. He’s getting worse.
“Hey Buddy, you not feeling too good?” I ask, risking touching his forehead to find it is burning hot. I don’t care if I’m treating him like a five year old, he needs it. Now this is happening, there is
“Dean.” Cas says his name quietly. Dean had been so far in his head that he hadn’t noticed Cas wake up.
After showering, me and Cas went back into the living room where I noticed Claire giving Cas a curious look. He seemed to ignore her by putting his head down, and I saw a small hue of red appear on his face. I’m guessing Claire knows something about this because she was the one that brought up the conversation at the table during dinner. We just talked about where we went. The kiss was not revealed at all.
“No, no, not that bit Cas. Remember when you woke up last night and I told you you’re safe? Well, you are, dude. Nothing’s going to happen to you.”
“Yeah, that’s right.” Dean nods. “And now he takes this special medicine which makes the broken rib feel less painful while it heals.”
Dean stroked his hair and he’d never felt so good even though he was crying. Dean was his rock. Without him, he’d drift away to nothing.
“What’s wrong?” My brother asks, going over to the table to take some beers from a pack before putting them in our fridge.
Cas knows that Dean is nervous too. He hasn’t actually said anything but there’s just something about the way Dean acts. It’s tiny subtleties, but it’s there. Cas can’t even put his finger on it, but he can definitely tell. It must just be something he’s used to seeing after having Dean around for a good few months now.
It is of Sam, who is finally standing up, but he is wearing his signature bitch face because he has noticed I took photos of him. There are flakes of ice clinging to his long hair, and I zoom in on his pissed-off looking face. Cas laughs a little harder and I screenshot the close up of my brother’s face. This could be considered childish but this is too funny to ignore. I’ll have to remember to set it as my brother’s phone's lock screen when he’s not looking.
still try and show his face at the Christmas party. After all, they rearranged it just for him, but he doesn’t think he can manage to be there for long. His head feels like it’s gone to mush and he just…can’t think. He feels like his energy has never been so low. It’s horrible and as much as he wants to push through it and stay with Dean – god, he
Dean smiled, moving back to his position opposite Cas at the other side of the counter. “And how I love you too – yes?”
Dean reminds himself this place is dangerous and snaps back into alert-mode, away from the mindless wandering he’d been doing before. None of this makes a lick of sense, and he doesn’t like it. He needs to find these people soon or find shelter. Oh, and try not to get killed. That would help, even if the angels
Cas nods. He’s nearly half way down the glass which is pretty good since he’s only been taking small sips.
My eyes bolt open quickly as I think about it, and I glance around at everyone else, who have all also fallen asleep. What if Cas needed me and I was asleep? What if my dream was partly real?
There's that, and I'm also doing GISHWHES so Misha Collins will basically be controlling me all week xD
I hold his gaze and realise he is really being genuine. He wasn’t like this when we saw him with Amara. He’s
It felt like hours until his friend turned up and found him under the climbing frame, muttering “oh Cas” as he pulled him out and walked him to the car.
“You deserve each other. You care too - I can tell. I think you two are going to very happy together; I look forward to the wedding, bro.” Gabe give a small smile and pats his shoulder before standing up to walk across the beach to where Jimmy and Cas are kneeling by the rock pools.
Dean waves, sad to have to let go of his hand. Cas waves back and before Dean knows it, the taxi has driven off and he is standing on the doorstep alone.
“Okay, look, stop.” Cas says and Dean comes to a halt. Cas points at a large, flat pebble in front of Dean. “Step on that one.” He giggles. Dean steps on it and
Jody smiles reassuringly at him, and I realise that everyone is now watching us, wondering what in the hell we got each other.
I find the pie and smile warmly at it. Cherry. My favourite. Maybe I can get Cas to eat some. If I was sick and there was one food I could eat? Yep, you know it. Pie.
“Just to be clear, I planned on asking you for your blessing much more formally.” He feels he needs to add, his voice quiet.
Eager, he made his way over and carefully climbed into Dean’s lap, keeping himself elevated so he didn’t lower down too far yet.
Groaning, he goes into the en suite, falling to his knees in front of the toilet “for god’s sake” he mutters before groaning once more in discomfort.
I finally glance up from the screen and meet Cas’ eyes. He’s saying this himself, not me. Now there’s an improvement! Yes!
Cas huffs a laugh in disbelief and shakes his head. “That has to be a mistake, I- surely it wasn’t because of me.”
“DON’T SPEAK TO ME. I’M FED UP OF ALL OF THE BULLSHIT. MAKE YOUR DAMN MIND UP, DEAN! DO YOU REALLY WANT ME GONE??” He punches the wooden beam hard.
“Yeah, course you can!” Cas smiles. “You can take Husky and your favourite blanket and sleep next to your friends. You’ll have a lot of fun, I promise.”
Jimmy helps Cas calm Bailey until he sits back down and starts purring again. Bailey curls his paws, kneading on Jimmy’s leg which makes him giggle.
Dean laughs. “Yeah, he asked me if he could dress himself and I said he could. You might walk in there to see him wearing his t-shirt as pants. I have no idea what he was planning.”
Castiel begins shivering and I remove the washcloth from his forehead. He’s cooled down considerably so I decide it’s time to get him out.
“But aside from that…it would make you feel like you did the right thing, even though you didn’t want to?”
Cas says nothing. It’s like he shuts down for a minute or two which feels like hours, but Dean waits for him to form words. He’d wait for years if that’s how long Cas needed.
Cas continues. “Since then, we’ve been here for each other. All the way through the fighting and the surviving
Castiel spots Dean across the yard chatting to Alfie and Gabriel, laughing and joking about something. Cas rolls his eyes when Dean’s laugh carries across the yard. His husband and his brothers share a similar sense of humour.
Honestly, I think he’s still recovering from what happened. His leg, as I said, isn’t completely healed, so he really does get tired easily, even though it’s been a few months since all of that crap happened.
Sam climbs out of the back seats to go get the weapons, “meet you outside the car, Dean.” He decides.”See ya in a bit, Cas.”
The first thing I hear is the chirping of the birds outside. Apart from that, there is absolute silence; you could hear a pin drop. I can hear the slow breathing of Cas, who is still positioned comfortably on my chest. He is smiling in his sleep, and his hair is absolutely everywhere, even more so than usual.  There are strands poking out in every direction and it just makes me want to run my hands through the soft locks.
He walks alongside his mom, making light conversation despite the heavy topic hanging over them. “Did they tell you which ward?”
Cas nods, trying to take Dean’s advice and not stop himself from crying this time. He moves forwards and presses his face into Dean’s chest again, letting himself relax and get out the pent-up emotions.
Cas starts to toe his shoes off, completely ignoring the tied laces. He kicks them to the side of the room and sighs, looking down at his pants.
He hisses through a quiet laugh, reaching around to pull Dean’s hand back up to his waist. He looks over into Dean’s eyes. “What if Gabe had heard that?”
They sat in silence for a while, watching Naomi getting more impatient by the minute until Cas threw his phone a couple of feet across the bed. It landed face down with a soft thud when it hit the soft bedclothes.
“Yeah. She helped me process it.” He explains, pushing the shopping cart absentmindedly. He’s starting to get tired. “I’ve never topped Dean before.” He just comes out and says it. “Y’know, because of some stuff I had in my head about what happened with Greg, but now…I think I’m ready.”
Cas looks down to see that Jimmy is captivated with the little toy ‘penwin’. The way he pronounces it is super cute.
Dean picks it up and slings it over his arm with his own. “Give this to me instead of the floor next time bud, okay?” He asks.
In fact, from other close-by bodies, Dean decides this whole thing seems to have been some kind of sheesh-kebab fest between all kinds of
“Yep, that’s us.” I confirm, and we approach the woman. Cas seems to be dragging his feet more than usual. He
I’ve always liked Cas. The only problem has been me not admitting to myself that I wanted this to happen. All of the crap we’ve been through together has bonded us in ways like no other. All of the mistakes, bad decisions, good decisions, everything. Only now am I beginning to realise that maybe, just maybe, the little light in my life that keeps me going is this angel. And only now am I realising how much I’ve wanted to do this for so long. I can’t see my life without Cas anymore. This little blue-eyed, high frequency wave is who I have fallen for, and I couldn’t be more happy. I don’t have a proper home, but I have my car, my brother and my angel, and that is more than I could possibly ask for.
After a few moments of turning around and squinting into the darkness around him, he feels something cold pressing against the back of his neck. It makes him jump at first, and he is about to swing around and gank whatever it is before a woman’s voice travels calmly through the otherwise silent clearing. “Drop the blade.” She commands, her voice orotund. Despite the steadiness in her voice, Dean can hear the threatening demeanor gnawing at the edges of the mystery woman, so he chooses not to try and fight.
“Uh…yeah, of course.” I say hesitantly, pressing my fingers to my lips where they met Deans just moments ago.
I swallow a few times, searching for something to say. How do I feel about what Omandriel did to me? “Betrayed.”
Due to the dead silence in the room, we can hear what Sam is saying. Just the usual things like names and stuff, but he does make a good move when he politely requests for a female doctor. Clearly Cas wouldn’t feel as comfortable with a man after what happened. Especially if he’s getting everywhere checked out.
Cas takes in a deep breath, bringing himself to a little more before pushing himself up. He feels better after getting some sleep.
Cas looks like he considers it but doesn’t really react to it, continuing to breathe heavily. I’ve never seen him so scared.
.” He laughed softly. “I think that’s where my sense of humour came from. People at school used to think I was funny because I’d make jokes about her existence being stupid. Thinking back on it, making fun of it all was my coping method.”
Cas leans over towards Jimmy’s face, cupping his cheek with a soft smile. His hand looks so big – it reminds him when Jimmy was a tiny baby and his whole head fit in Cas’ hand. Time flies.
Dean leans forward to look into Cas’ eyes directly, knowing his face is serious. “Cas, are you sure?”
As he can support himself now, I let go of Cas and slip out of bed, feeling kind of bad for forcing him to wake up.
Cas watches Dean walk out of the kitchen before stepping outside and pulling the door closed behind him.
“Alright, cool! You’re going to enjoy it, I know you will.” Cas smiles, feeling proud because Jimmy’s getting so brave now.
part of it, but Dean had to admit that Cas’ resume was very good. Castiel had told him that his parents had encouraged him do loads of respectable stuff when he was younger so that explained the list of achievements.
We kiss for a few moments until another snowball comes flying over to us and hits the both of us in the face.
“Yeah.” He sighs. “I’ll wrap it back up and save it. See if I want it later.” Cas decides. Dean nods, leaning across the table, tilting Cas’ chin up to press a short, soft kiss to his lips. They smile at each other before Dean collects the food wrappers to take to the trash.
Jimmy walks forwards cautiously towards him, seeing that his eyes are closed. “Daddy?” He asks, searching his face to see if he’s awake “…daddy?”
“Nah, it’s okay. I’m sure you are. He wouldn’t mind.” Jody pushes Alex’s bag into another room. “So...Sam has a girlfriend?”
I nod and smile warmly at him, “please, if you want to stop – it doesn’t matter how far along we are with things or what we’re doing – we
guy in the world, but he sure made it tough for Cas. Dad was fine with the rest of us, but he never warmed to Cas. He never admitted why either, and poor, innocent little Cas, tried so
Dean licks his lips, knowing that this is, however, still Cas’ reality right now; he’s clearly upset about it. “What happened?” He puts gently.
“Whatever.” Dean shakes his head and stabs some more meat with his fork with a splodge of mashed potato. “I’m hungry.”
“It’s settled. Castiel will be the carrier. Meet us here at seven am tomorrow. No earlier, no later. We will explain your task in detail during that time.” The brunette says. “As for today – and this applies to all of you – make sure you get recruits prepared and equipped. We leave at nine am tomorrow for battle.”
“Morning, sweetheart. You okay?” Cas asks and Jimmy gives a big nod before walking over to climb up onto the bed.
“Okay. Well, we have that water I bought earlier, so if he does wake up, make him drink something. Also, considering the fact he’s really sick, it’s probably best he didn’t eat solid food.”
As me and Sam are squished together on the couch, I shift to get more comfortable, noticing that there is good looking bowl full of popcorn on the coffee table.
Luckily, he packed a random towel for Cas earlier (one of the many random things he packed) so he uses it to dry the immediate wetness from his hair before throwing it in the back of the car.
With that, he left the restroom with confidence and a slight spring in his step. He had this. Naomi wasn’t going to hold him back any longer.
The case is in Indiana and at the minute we’re in Michigan so it shouldn’t take too long to get there. If we get going soon, we should make it for around twelve.
“This.” Dean says as he takes Cas by surprise when he – carefully, to not hurt him - lifts his fiancé over onto his knee. “There.”
“Cas, Dean, I’m so sorry. I had no idea he even knew words like that.” Michael shakes his head in apology.
Gabe is staying with Cas and Dean tonight and Daniel is coming tomorrow afternoon to drive Gabe’s car to the house where him, Alfie, Anna and Rachel are staying.
He immediately basked in the warmth when Dean pulled the blankets up over them and let his head rest on his friend’s chest, listening to the grounding heart beat while Dean’s fingers found their way into his mop of dark chestnut hair.
Cas’ eyes close again. Dean kisses his hand before standing up. “I’m gonna go pick Jimmy up. I’ll be back in twenty, give or take.”
Dean slides his hands under Cas’ back and starts to lift him as carefully as possible. Cas pants and clearly suppresses a grunt of pain.
“My dad. I know.” He sighs, pulling away so he can make eye contact. “I will. I just need a little more time.”
“Yeah? Okay, come on, let’s show you what we did to your room.” Cas is glad Jimmy agreed. They’ll be able to give him lots of praise tomorrow. Shameless,
Cas kneels down and accepts Jimmy into his arms tightly. He doesn’t let go and strokes his boy’s hair for a good while. Jimmy starts to sniffle.
“How much longer we got on the road, Sam?” I ask, smiling at the waitress as she quickly places our orders on the table and clears off.
He goes back to Jimmy and takes the boy into his arms again before walking outside alongside the paramedics with the stretcher.
The sun is catching the water of the lake, and birds are chirping overhead. Castiel looks up at the sky, the sunlight catching his eyes and making them even bluer. They are filled with wonder and it just takes my breath straight away.
“Coward.” Roan chuckles and this is when Cas snaps, standing up and throwing a hard punch at the guy’s face.
Dean watches the light start to leave Cas eyes. His labored breathing begins to slow and Dean can’t help but bury his head into Cas’ shoulder. “I love you. I love you so much. I love you.”
Cas goes quite comatose after all of that. It’s only for a few minutes while he regains the little strength he has, but Dean strokes his hair comfortingly over and over under he comes to again.
“Uh, hey, buddy.” I call to the guy that is emptying the van’s waste. He looks up questioningly and waits for me to speak. “You haven’t happened to have seen a guy in like a, a beige trench coat have you? Dark, scruffy hair, about yay high? Kinda hot?” I ask, holding my hand up in an estimate of Castiel’s height. I just said hot, didn't I? Dammit.
I drain the last of my coffee and pick up my phone to open the photo Alex sent. I smile when I look at it. Yep, ‘that one’s a keeper’ as an apple pie family would put it.
“There’s nothing Dean hasn’t seen before either.” Cas mumbles, just loud enough for everyone to hear. It’s the first time he’s spoken since the restaurant. The fact that he’s making little jokes right now makes Dean love him a little more.
When he finishes, he sighs, obviously in relief. His head tilts back to rest on my shoulder for extra support while he tucks himself back in. His hair brushes against my cheek and I can’t help but notice that it smells like watermelon.
Dean presses small kisses to Cas’ head, not sure how to comfort him when the subject is so serious and raw. This is a
He felt his dick continuously twitch as each spurt came, and with Dean’s hands still massaging his tightened balls, he felt insanely good.
It’s not like the last time he passed out. He’s not panicking or trying to move, he’s just staring at Anna with a blank, tired expression.
“You think I don’t already know that? I feel crappy enough for treating him like a piece of shit before, and now this? He thinks I hate him and want him gone? I have never felt so proud of myself.” I finish, the sarcasm in my voice so thick you could cut it with a knife.
“Sam, his grace!” I shout and my brother kneels down next to me and lifts Cas’ head while I unscrew the cap on the tube.
I can hear voices coming from the kitchen so I make my way there, noting that around half of us are awake at the minute.
I increase the speed of the car as we move on to the highway, not failing to notice that Cas’ eyes are closed and he is resting his head on Sam’s shoulder, still exhausted from using up his energy last night.
Dean can tell that Gabe is used to being more of a father figure to Cas. They treat each other like normal brothers, but there’s that extra bit of protectiveness there that Dean can see in Gabe. It’s sweet.
When they got there, they ordered the food and sat down opposite each other on the bench. Cas admired Dean’s eyes when his boyfriend looked over at him. The green of the forest highlighted the colour of his irises and Cas could look at Dean all day.
“Just stupid stuff.” I smile back, setting Cas down in the armchair in front of the TV. I grab the remote and turn it on before flipping through the channels until we get something. A documentary on honey bees - Cas’ favourite. I hand him the remote and smack him on the shoulder in a bro kind of way.
He leaves the bathroom and reaches the top of the stairs before stopping. He looks down at each individual step, eyes drifting over each one before he spots a bottle of shampoo, knocked over in the middle of the step. How he didn’t notice it yesterday, he doesn’t know, but…is this what Cas tripped over? A stupid, misplaced bottle of shampoo? Something so small caused all of this damage?
He feels like his emotions have overflowed and it’s all just coming out now. There’s no stopping it.
Dean snakes an arm across his shoulders and holds him close, pressing his other hand against Cas’ forehead again.
“I’ll throw up.” He says truthfully, shifting uncomfortably at the thought of it. “I know I need to eat...I do. Just...since this has been going on for a while now I can kind of tell when I’m not feeling good. And right now...I- I really can’t face eating anything else.”
“I feel sick.” He admits, one of his hands clutching his stomach. I’m not surprised really. All of that shouting and crying must have shaken him up so much. Not to mention the pain from his leg.
We wanted to celebrate Christmas properly this year, so yeah, we’ve invited our family, because one wise, drunk, gruff, friend once said: family don’t end with blood.
He stays still with Jimmy for a minute or two before lifting him up and heading for the stairs. Cas is on the floor, his shirt half ridden up his stomach and bruises starting to form.
He continues to cry loudly as the vicious sobs wrack his body, and I feel tears pricking at my own eyes from watching my best friend go through this.
Cas rolls his eyes and takes Dean’s hand. “He’s mine.” He sees Dean raise an eyebrow from the corner of his eye.
Cas places his hand on Jimmy’s back. The boy nods and closely watches the assistant carefully lift the lone kitten out.
Much to my relief, there is a fresh pot made and I pour myself some into a white mug. It’s tastes freaking amazing – much better than the crappy stuff we have back at the bunker.
We sit in silence for a few minutes, all of us thinking about what will go down tomorrow. Surely she can’t be that much of a threat right? I mean, she’s clearly doing this to spite Cas like Omandriel did, but the angels who still hate Cas are a very small minority, so it’s not like she’ll have an army of back up. Well, I hope so anyway. It should be easy enough. Whatever goes down tomorrow, we’ll get through it. We always do.
There is something heavy pressing on my shoulder, pushing my left side deeper into the bed. It takes me a while to hear the person’s voice, but I eventually notice it’s Sam waking me up.
?! That’s an understatement.” Gabe scoffs. “But whatever, they’re Michael’s problem. Lucky for us we just have this little monkey to deal with.” Gabe points at Jimmy.
“Your eyes are beautiful though...” Cas presses a small kiss to Dean’s cheek. “You’re beautiful as you are, Dean.”
I walk around the bed and help him up, and he looks around the room as if he’s looking for something.
“Jimmy’s okay, isn’t he.” Cas decides. His voice is still quiet and a little shaky but he seems confident in what he said.
Also, I realised I haven't actually told you about when I update soooo: Every three days max. - It's only ever longer than that if I'm on holiday :D
“Well, we don’t have much food in so him and Claire went to the grocery store. He offered to look after Cas while I went but Castiel said he wanted me to stay so here we are.”
After staying silent for a moment, Dean speaks. “Nah, it’s fine. Honestly, some random guys on a screen don’t do anything for me. Not anymore.”
He peered down the path where Dean would be appearing from. It went right through a forest park until the campus ended and it popped out back in town. They were meeting for lunch then Cas was going to go to therapy while Dean went back to work.
I reach around Cas and place my hand on the small of his back, liking how I can feel his warm body through his thin shirt.
He cries more, his breathing out of control, and flinches away from me. It’s as if he’s detached from everything. Nothing he’s seeing or feeling makes sense to him. All he knows is that he’s scared and he
“Oh, okay. We’ll see you all tomorrow then.” His mom says as they stand up and start putting their coats on to walk back.
It’s only been a week, but Cas is more than ready to leave. Dean knows that Cas just wants to be in his own bed and use his own bathroom and relax in his own living room. Dean understands.
“So, me and Cas were talking earlier.” Claire begins, and I notice Cas look up at her in horror. “It would be cool if he could get some proper fresh air, like go out or something. You up for that, Dean?”
Cas let the words turn in his head. What a proposition. He had no qualms about living with Dean. They’d fit well together, he knew that. And that was in terms of their personalities
I think that overall, this is just another bad string of events that have happened way too close together.
Cas finishes in the bathroom and switches the light off, walking out. He smiles and approaches Dean who is now sitting on the edge of the bed. “Me too.”
I pull into a space facing the water in the mostly empty parking area. There aren’t as many people around as I was expecting so it’s nice and quiet.
He takes Jimmy from Dean and sets on getting his son ready for bed. Jimmy stays asleep while Cas changes him into his pyjamas, so he guesses that Jimmy is in a really deep sleep. It must be because he was playing with Jack for a while, Bartholomew and Kelly’s youngest at 4 years old.
Dean’s best friend soon becomes involved in a fight, which everyone in the cafeteria become involved in until one of the angels comes over and breaks it up, yelling “ENOUGH!”
Cas laughs with him. “Thanks.” He takes Dean’s hand and squeezes it, looking into his apple green eyes with gratitude.
Should he go for a shower now? It would leave a decent amount of time to have breakfast, get Jimmy ready and call the hospital before it gets too late in the morning. He’d have extra time to sort things with mom too, since he’s planning on going to the hospital with her and Sam so there will be someone else around to take care of Jimmy if needs be. Yeah, he’d do that.
The door clicks shut and I sit silently on the bed. Dean promised he wouldn’t leave me again. He just outside, it’s fine.
After (what may as well be hiking) for a little longer, I decide that where I am standing is pretty good. There are trees completely surrounding me that are blocking the sky out of view apart from a tiny hole directly above me.
“Okay.” Cas stands up straight and leads Jimmy to the cats which are hypoallergenic. “These ones won’t make papa sneeze, all right?”
“Excuse me.” Michael says to them all with a forced smile. Cas can see the annoyance and stress behind his eyes. Something along the lines of
“Some sigils back in Indiana are making Cas sick. Find them and destroy them. All the angels that put them there are gone. It’s an easy in an’ out.”
it’s just…I’m tired father. I’m tired of pushing. Apart from my life, Sam, Dean and my friends, I have nothing left to lose.”
I set him down on top of the covers. The thing is, if I tuck him in he’ll get too warm, and that won’t be good for his fever, so being on top of the covers with the blanket is ideal.
Dean ignores it though, letting Cas make the decisions even though Dean’s the one who’s been leading so far. Cas gently pulls him down to kiss him more, so Dean happily complies, bracketing Cas’ head with his forearms. He returns to running the tips of his fingers through Castiel’s hair, keeping their lips locked as they get lost in the kiss.
“There was some urgent business we had to tend to.” I smile. She glances up and down Cas and notices his arm slung over my shoulders first, then she looks down and sees that he is partially leaning on me, and then moves her eyes further down and notices that his left leg is bent very slightly so not too much weight is on it.
“I’m sorry.” I choke out, my breaths stuttering more and more as each second passes. There is nothing Dean can do.
His boyfriend moved his reddened lips up and down his shaft with determined vigour, hollowing his cheeks causing an incredible suction feeling.
Mom heads down the metal steps first, then me and Cas follow. The angel goes down a couple and suddenly yelps in what must be pain, “ah!”
“No, I know. It’s fine. He needs to recover and I would’ve been a beacon for the angels. I understand.” I look down at my hands, wondering what we’ll have to clear up next.
I squeeze Cas’ hand and he grips back. Maybe he likes me as more than a friend too? It would explain a lot, but what if that’s just Cas being Cas? He’s always been closer to me than he needs to be. I just don’t know anymore.
They look up to the sky and see the dingy gray colour it holds. “Oh well.” Cas tilts his head to the side in thought. “One of my university professors used to say that rain is good for the soul.” There’s nostalgia mixed into Cas’ voice.
The whole plot of the epilogue was inspired by 'Heaven in Your Eyes' by Loverboy (as you can see form the title), so maybe you'd like to listen to it by clicking below (I really hope the link works ahaha) v v v
“Was he okay? I was across the field at the time.” Dean lies. He has no idea what other-him was doing, but it seems a good answer because no one bats an eyelid.
since he saw her last. In ten years, she’s gained several wrinkles and looks very gaunt with all of her hair scraped back off her face. It’s like she’s deteriorated after he left. Sure, she could be a piece of decomposing fruit in a compost bin for all Cas cares, but…yeah, she looks pretty awful.
“Sshh, it’s okay. Breathe.” Dean whispers, calm as ever. Cas nods and does as he says, only realizing that he’s gripping the blankets uncomfortably tight when his hands start cramping up. He lets go, stretching out his fingers before leaning forwards a little to bury his face in his hands.
“Will you be free at approximately,” the angel starts. He grabs my wrist and looks down at my watch before looking back up at Claire, “7:27pm tonight?”
He nods. “Yeah, and the room. I’m thinking of going there myself first and see what state he’s in before taking Jimmy to him. Do you think that’s the right thing to do?”
“Didn’t you say you think that he allowed you to be part human and part angel or something?” I ask through a mouthful of fries.
Cas glances at Dean who is also not saying anything. He assumes that Gabriel told the full story while they were chatting outside the boat center doors.
“Look at the pair of them.” Gabe laughs quietly. They both watch Cas and Jimmy lying flat on the couch together, fast asleep. “Tired themselves out playing with the water.”
Jimmy makes another little noise and Dean feels guilty, but it’s best to be safe than sorry. “I know, bud. I know. I’m sorry.”
Of course, he has that special grace, but it still makes him susceptible to human harm. He’s much more cautious and quiet and, well, childish?
“It’s okay, just keep breathing.” Dean says from next to him, rubbing Cas’ back up and down. He listens to Dean and tries his best to match his breathing to Dean’s hand on his back. It’s a small thing, but it starts to help. The nauseous feeling starts to recede first.
“Well, the word retard actually means someone with a mental disability, not necessarily stupid. But even so, it’s really not a very nice word to say to someone. Horrible, actually.”
Claire walks up to Cas and also gives him a tight hug. “Thanks again.” She tells him genuinely. “I’ll see you round?”
It seems like he’s completely calm. His eyes are open and his breathing is normal, but he’s looking down, fiddling with his fingers and not speaking a word. The crying has also stopped, but there are still tears staining his cheeks.
“Cas, Cas, baby, breathe. It’s okay, breathe.” He hears Dean next to him and feels arms under his back before he’s hoisted into a sitting position on the mattress.
him I’d go with him but it was like he was testing my patience because he kept pushing the door further open. I mean, it’s
“I’m gonna get him in to bed.” He hauls Cas up. The angel’s eyes flicker open and closed a few times, but it is brief and he’s barely conscious.
“You mean so much to me, and to know that you’ve been through that, well, it-it just breaks my heart.”
Naomi went purple, her beady eyes stabbing into him like daggers. “Now you listen to me, you ungrateful
the pain he felt. It’s as if there are tiny needles pricking my skin, each one of them allowing me to feel the pain of the slice of a knife, or the pain of a punch to the head. I can
“Really? Wow.” Cas’ words and sentences are slow and he really does sound exhausted. His grip tightens on Dean’s hand, regaining his attention.
“Sit.” Blonde-hair tells him with the same tone that mystery voice used. Dean sits down but disregards the firmness in his voice and is about to start firing questions, but somehow blonde-hair’s gaze keeps him quiet. Dean looks him up and down, seeing from his body language that he’s definitely an angel. He’s staring at Dean stoic-faced, and is standing straight as a board, his arms hanging limply but neatly by his sides. Yep. Angel.
Going dead still, he grips the angel blade tightly, staring around, trying to make out any shapes in the increasing darkness. He’s very tense now; shoulders tight, fingers clenched, jaw clenched – ready for a fight. He knows something’s watching him. He can feel the familiar prickle at the back of his neck when he has that gut feeling. Whatever it is, it’s well hidden, aided by the vile, thick air mixed with the impending gloom of nighttime.
yet still, all you care about is your pride.” He takes another deep breath. “But this isn’t about that. This isn’t about the past, this is about now. Who I am
It was never my intention to make hurt him this bad, but apparently it hit him one hundred times harder than expected.
We start to leave but Dr. Clarke grabs my wrist and leans close to my ear so Cas can’t hear what she’s saying, “Mr Winchester, if the shyness and fear continues, you might want to consider getting him a therapist. He’s been through an awful lot. If you ever need to see exactly what happened, you can put in a request for my report that is also being sent to the cops.” When she finishes speaking to me, she leans away. “Eddie, take care ok? You’re in good hands.”
“Oh Cas.” Dean whispers softly when he sees the huge wet patch on my grey sweatpants that has spread across most of me from the waist down. I assume Sam sees too, because he leaves the room, muttering something about getting a washing basket.
“Yeah. But the thing is Cas, you have nothing to be embarrassed about because everyone needs help sometimes, and if that means holding you steady while you take a leak, or helping in the shower, or even helping you walk, then I’m perfectly happy to get you through it.”
Dean nods, eyes trailing to the floor. “Y’know, when I woke him and he was half asleep, he was just…” Dean shakes his head “he was like a rag doll. Tired out of his mind and I could see in his eyes that he just wanted to go home.” He pinches the bridge of his nose. “I think he tried to convince himself that he wants to stay here another week but I
The next half hour went slowly but sort of comfortably as Cas changed and got ready for bed in the bathroom. Dean had got ready for bed too and had tended to Cas’ busted knuckles while Cas sat on the closed toilet seat and Dean on the edge of the bath.
With a deep breath, he waits for the doorbell to ring and when it does, he takes a moment to compose himself before open the door.
Naomi watches him collect himself. She watches him stand from the chair slowly. He stands and stares at her for a few moments before, very slowly and reluctantly, leaning down, arms open.
I take a bite of my pancakes, not bothering to try and start a conversation. We’ve all gone kind of quiet because of the anticipation for what’s going to happen.
He watches Gabe pull a spare plastic bag from his duffel and stuff the sweatshirt inside. He then pulls off his own sweater and holds it out to Cas. “Here, put this on. I’m warm anyway.”
“Okay.” Cas says and they take a while to slip out of their t-shirts and boxers. He accepts Dean back on top of him, pulling at the back of his neck so their lips can reconnect. He sighs at the feeling of Dean’s hot dick pressed against his own. Part of him still can’t believe this is happening.
“We’re not giving up on him, Dean. We’re letting him do what he needs to do to be happy. All we can do is support him, and not take for granted this last day we have. Because by tomorrow…it’ll be over. And he’ll be in a much happier place.” Gus adds.
“Afraid not.” Dean chuckles, voice turning serious when he looks into Cas’ beautiful eyes. “Cas, you’re my world.”
He regrets poking some of the bodies when he disturbs an injured vampire. He doesn’t see the teeth while it’s just lying there, but the moment his blade touches it, it starts thrashing and snarling at him, the grass around it glazed in its blood that’s slowly seeping from an abdominal wound it seems to have. It nearly manages to scrape Dean’s leg with its unnaturally long nails – even though it’s basically floor-bound – so Dean finishes it off with the angel blade (“son of a bitch!”), shoving the sharp metal into the vampire’s neck. It gurgles when blood fills its mouth before going still and limp just like everything else.
After cleaning up his fingers and his dick along with any other evidence of what we did, I gently put Cas’ now limp cock back in his pants for him before lifting the sleeping angel up and carrying him to bed. After all, he’ll be much more comfortable there.
Dean chooses not to say anything sarcastic, instead helping Cas stand. Cas is wobbly on his feet at first but powers through and builds up enough energy until he can just about walk on his own. Dean admires his endurance.
“Man, am I hungry. Big night.” Dean says, walking alongside me as we stroll into a diner. There are people chatting and eating, but no one looks suspicious so we sit down at a table. “This is the best diner, they have the best cheeseburgers, it’s awesome.”
“I think we might have a night in tonight, right Cas? Jimmy’s tired and we could use a quiet evening.”
Cas takes a breath to reply, hesitating for a second before saying “that’s the plan.” Dean nods to agree, finishing his food and placing his knife and fork on his empty plate. Damn, he enjoyed that. It tasted so good.
They both take one of Jimmy’s hands and walk with him to his room, pushing the door open slowly, revealing the inside of the room.
“Oh yes. The enemy. Of course.” Dean nods. Damnit, he’s being weird. He’s gonna have to up his game if he’s gonna pretend to be himself. Well, another version of himself. “Soooo, what’s going on with all the bodies…I must have been knocked out, and when I woke up and there were dead things everywhere.”
Dean stands up first then helps Cas stand slowly. Cas grimaces and takes a sharp intake of breath when he straightens up.
His mom raises an eyebrow at Cas. “Okay, I may have dipped his toes in a little too long…” he smiles sheepishly.
“Thanks, Dean.” Cas hums. He tilts his head up to kiss Dean softly. “Do you want some coffee, I’m gonna make some.”
I smile back at him but remember how we’re still working things out between us, “wouldn’t have blamed you if you did though.” I mumble, looking down at the floor. His smile falls too. “I really
“Alright. Okay.” I soothe to make him stop shaking. He’s obviously got himself kind of worked up about this. It’s obvious, so I’m glad we were able to resolve it before it got too out of hand.
“I have this.” He says to himself again, and this is all it takes to get him to leave the safety of the bathroom and return to Dean and Nicky with a sudden boost in confidence.
With a satisfying deep inhale, he steadily hauls himself up into a sitting position, wondering what Dean and Jimmy are up to. Eating maybe? Mingling with his relatives? He hopes they’re having a good time.
My assumptions are confirmed when he starts to stress out a bit, holding onto me so tightly I actually think he might bruise my skin.
. But having Cas in in his arms, knowing he’s bringing some calm to him, is something he loves to do.
alone and helpless. Dean squeezes my hand back. I’ve actually never seen him so mellow before. He’s been here for me the whole time, I couldn’t be more grateful. This is the side of Dean that should come out more often. He can really make you feel better just by being there for you.
“Since I love you…yeah? What do you want?” He smiles softly, letting his head rest against Castiel’s, closing his eyes. He’s really coming to terms with these feelings he has. Any normal person wouldn’t discover they love someone so soon but…it’s like Dean’s just slipped right into place. Being this close to Cas has made him realise just how strong this is.
“You think?” Dean snaps sarcastically. He is about to start shouting at them for dragging them all this way for nothing when a much more eerie silence settles over them.
“I won’t bore you. It’s ok, I can walk back to the store from here.” I unbuckle my seatbelt and go to pull the handle on the door.
Dean smiles, knowing they’ll have to clean the sticky mess from between them, but for now? They’re just going to sit there. Sit there with each other; in each other’s presence; enjoying the time they have; just being
I shoot the hinges on the front door of the house before whacking the door down with the grip of the gun. My breaths are heavy, and it feels like anything at all can and will make me more angry.
He buries his nose against Cas again, whispering comfort with a hope that Cas can somehow hear it. “I got you. It’s gonna be okay.” He repeatedly strokes Cas’ hair, holding him close to his chest. He’s feeling a huge wave of protectiveness gushing through him, and he just feels like he has to be as close to Cas as possible to make sure he’s okay. “Don’t you worry about me when you wake up. You just focus on getting better.” He murmurs. Even though Cas is still unconscious, Dean finds comfort in talking to him. He cradles the back of Cas’ head. “You’re gonna be just fine, Cas. It’s okay.”
He never actually asked Cas, but he always imagined Castiel’s wings to be majestic and magnificent – stretching tall above him with those blue eyes shining with grace. He likes to think that Cas’ wings are a deep navy colour – near black – but they take on a shiny blue tinge in sunlight. He’s thought about how silky they’d be, damaged or not, and how…how beautiful they would be. Just like Cas.
“Well…I guess she just put me on the spot and said that she wants to meet him. She called him her son at one point and he’s just
They walked further around the lake, smiling at other walkers and saying hello as they crossed paths.
He scrunched his face and pressed it into the mattress, trying to suppress his crying. He bet Dean thought he was the biggest baby of the century. He felt like it.
sex hair. Castiel’s normal mess of a hairstyle is nothing compared to this. Dean finds it hot and cute at the same time. God help him.
Cas pauses, thinking until he comes up with his answer. “You wait.” He shrugs, going over to his bed and slipping his jacket off his shoulders.
I smile without shame at my own thoughts before hopping into the driver’s seat of Baby. Sam slips into the passenger seat and I start the engine before pulling out of the parking lot. It’s still quite early so we should have a good drive through.
He made a quick job of it and since he’d taken all of his clothes off to do it, he decided to slip just his boxers back on.
“Cas?” I whisper, but he just sits still. I can’t imagine what state of mind he’s in right now. Things have been going so well, and then
“Ok.” I agree, reaching over and taking the sandwich from Cas’ plate. Thankfully he ate most of the lettuce so there’s less healthy stuff on it.
I slowly place my hand on his shoulder, and the angel flinches hard. He stiffens underneath my touch so I turn him around so he is lying on his back. His eyes are watery and there are a few tear streaks along his face. He looks up at me with his bright blue eyes as I stare in shock.
is fighting their own battles. This is yours, and it really hasn’t been easy for you. I can see that, and everyone else can see that too. Think: you just saw something happen to your
“…Cas, just serious for a second - forget about it, yeah? Don’t go worrying about it all day. I don’t care about what happened and you shouldn’t either, okay?”
Walking over slowly, Dean squints at the spindly man, stopping three feet away from him, stance firm. “How’s it going. You here for some extra help, tough guy?”
He helps Cas through the door and closes it before guiding Cas to sit on their bed carefully. “There.” He says as he lets go of Cas to go close a window. It’s been letting cool air in all morning so it’s pretty chilly in the room.
With there being enough room for the three of them, Dean decides to take Cas’ hand as they start down the stairs.
Laughing again, I shake my head and place my right hand, which is under the table, on Castiel’s left knee. I see him smile to himself out of the corner of my eye. His left arm is also under the table, and soon I feel his hand on top of mine. His right hand is still above the table so he can hold his fork, but underneath, his other hand is now interlocking fingers with mine.
“-so we’re going to start heading out eastwards where we assume the lesser part of the army is. Creatures like werewolves and vampires rather than leviathans and demons.”
The angel’s eyes flutter closed as I slip my finger inside slowly, wiggling it around to let him get used to the strange feeling.
“Yeah, alright.” I close my door and start the engine after watching our friends walk into the woods chatting heartily.
“Right in between those, there is another galaxy – not unlike Andromeda - that the humans haven’t discovered yet. It won’t be seen for a long time yet since the the light is still travelling through vacuum. It’s interesting don’t you think?”
Dean is encouraged to start walking again by the firearm pressing at him. It’s gonna make a red ring on his neck, but he doesn’t really care. He’s too bothered about the man standing in front of him, stone faced and tall. He’s around Sam’s height and has well-kept blonde hair. Dean would make a joke about grooming but decides against it, not wanting to piss anyone off within five minutes of arriving at the bleach hotel.
“Me neither.” Jody laughs, watching him and Claire skate side by side, flying around the rink in fast ovals.
The angel’s hips buck forwards, enough so that our dicks slide against each other and fuck if I don’t just come right here right now just listening to the sounds he is making. He moans again when I give his balls a small tug before he moves to the side and nibbles at my jaw with pleasured grunts.
Cas goes into the bag and pulls out our food. He just has crackers again and I have a BLT. Well, BBLT according to Cas.
